The team currently competes in EFL League One, the third level of the English football league system. The club has played at Home Park since 1901.\nThe club takes its nickname, \"The Pilgrims\", from the Pilgrim Fathers, an English religious group, that left Plymouth for the New World in 1620. The club crest features the \"Mayflower\", the ship that carried the pilgrims to Massachusetts. The club has predominantly played in green and white throughout its history, with a few exceptions in the late 1960s and early 1970s when white was the colour of choice. A darker shade of green, described (by some) as \"Argyle green\", was adopted in the 2001\u201302 season, and has been used ever since. The club has yet to compete in the Premier League or the Football League First Division that preceded it, the city of Plymouth being the largest in England to have never hosted a top-flight men's football team. Plymouth Argyle is the most southerly and westerly League club in England and the nation's only professional club named Argyle.\nOriginally founded simply as Argyle in 1886, the club turned professional and entered both the Southern League and Western League as Plymouth Argyle in 1903. The team won the Western League title in 1904\u201305 and the Southern League title in 1912\u201313, before winning election into the Football League Third Division in 1920. Finishing as runners-up on six consecutive occasions, Argyle eventually won promotion as Third Division South champions under the long-serving management of Bob Jack in 1929\u201330. A 20-year stay in the Second Division ended in 1950, though the club returned again as Third Division South champions in 1951\u201352. After another relegation in 1956 Argyle again proved too strong for the third tier, winning the Third Division title not long after in 1958\u201359.\nArgyle were relegated from the Second Division in 1968, 1977 and 1992, having won promotion out of the Third Division as runners-up in 1974\u201375 and 1985\u201386. The club was relegated to the fourth tier for the first time in 1995, and though it would win immediate promotion in 1995\u201396, was relegated again in 1998. Promoted as champions under Paul Sturrock with 102 points in 2001\u201302, Argyle secured a record fourth third-tier league title in 2003\u201304, and would remain in the Championship for six seasons until administration and two successive relegations left the club in League Two by 2011. In 2016\u201317, Argyle won promotion to League One, and again in 2019\u201320 following relegation the previous season. In the 2022\u201323 season, Argyle returned to the Championship as champions, winning the third-tier league title for a record fifth time.\nHistory.\nFormation and early years (1886\u20131937).\nThe club was founded in 1886 as Argyle Football Club, the first match taking place on 16 October 1886 against Caxton, a team from Cornwall and in which the Pilgrims lost 2\u20130. Later that week Argyle won for the first time, beating Dunheved College (now Launceston College) in Launceston (where many of the club's first members had been educated) 2\u20131. The club played several friendlies against Plymouth United, but poor performances on the pitch led to it going out of existence in 1894 before being resurrected in 1897 as one part of a general sports club, the Argyle Athletic Club. In 1898, Argyle F.C. produced its first rulebook. The club's ground was given as Marsh Mills, an area on the edge of the city of Plymouth.\nMuch speculation surrounds the origin of the name \"Argyle\". One explanation is that the club was named after the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, an army regiment with a strong football side of its own. Another theory is given by the local geography\u2013suggesting the name comes either from the nearby public house, \"The Argyle Tavern\", where the founder members may have met, or from a local street \"Argyle Terrace\". The club adopted its current name when it became fully professional in 1903, joining the Southern League, under the management of Bob Jack. Argyle's first professional game was on 1 September 1903 against West Ham United resulting in a 2\u20130 win for Argyle. The first home game as a fully professional club was on 5 September 1903 when Argyle beat Northampton Town 2\u20130 in front of a crowd of 4,438. Argyle won the Southern League in 1913, then in 1920 entered the Football League Third Division as a founder member, finishing 11th in its first season.\nIn the summer of 1924, a Plymouth Argyle team visited South America to play some exhibition football in Argentina and Uruguay. Argyle thrashed Uruguay 4\u20130 in the first game (the team which went on to win the first ever World Cup just six years later), before pulling off another shock by beating Argentina 1\u20130. Argyle then held Argentine giants Boca Juniors to a creditable 1\u20131 draw. Moses Russell captained the side and played in all nine matches. Russell's style of play caught the attention of the Argentine press; at the end of the tour 'The Standard of Buenos Aires' commented: \"The visit of Plymouth Argyle will be best remembered by the outstanding personality and genius of Moses Russell. His effective style, precise judgement, accurate and timely clearances, powerful kicking and no less useful work with his head...one of the most wonderful backs and one of the brainiest players ever seen on the football field.\"\nIn the match against Boca Juniors on 9 July 1924, the Boca Juniors supporters invaded the pitch after their team had scored the opening goal and carried all eleven home players shoulder high around the stadium. After a half-hour delay, the referee restarted the match, but a further invasion was sparked when the referee awarded a penalty against the home side. When the match was again restarted, the Argyle players had agreed that Patsy Corcoran would take the spot-kick and miss, to prevent another pitch invasion. However, the ultra-competitive Russell was not prepared to accept this, and just before Corcoran was about to take the penalty he was pushed aside by Russell, who took it himself and scored. This prompted a further pitch invasion by the Boca fans and this time the match was abandoned.\nBack in England, uniquely, between 1921\u201322 and 1926\u201327, Argyle finished second in the Third Division South six seasons in a row, thereby missing promotion. Argyle eventually won promotion to Football League Division Two in 1929\u201330, when the club topped the Third Division South, with attendances that season regularly reaching 20,000. Manager Bob Jack resigned in 1937, having spent 27 years in charge of the Pilgrims. Eleven years earlier in 1928, David Jack, who began his career with Argyle in 1919 but left in 1920, joined Arsenal F.C. from Bolton Wanderers for a fee of \u00a310,890 \u2013 which made him the most expensive player in the world at the time. He was also the first player to score at Wembley Stadium.\n1937\u20131986.\nAfter the Second World War, Argyle's 20-year stay in Division Two came to an end in 1950\u2013despite the efforts of inspirational captain Jack Chisholm. However, the club was back in Division Two before long, after winning the Third Division South in 1952. The closest the club has ever come to playing in the Football League First Division (top tier) was in 1952\u201353, when reaching fourth place in the Football League Second Division, the highest finish to date. In the 1954\u20131955 season floodlights arrived at Home Park, but in 1956 Argyle went down again. The Pilgrims' reputation as a 'yo-yo club' continued after winning Division Three\u2013by now a national league\u2013in 1959.\nThe 1960s started with one of the most bizarre events in Argyle's history. It came in the spring of 1963, when the club went on a mini-tour of Poland\u2014the Pilgrims were invited to play a game as a warm-up to an international cycle race. Amazingly, 100,000 saw Argyle that day\u2014the biggest crowd ever to attend a Plymouth match. In 1965 Argyle reached the Football League Cup semi-final, as a 2nd division team, for the first time in its history, but lost to Leicester City. But the decade ended disappointingly as Argyle returned to Division Three after relegation in 1968.\nIn March 1973 a memorable moment in Argyle's history was witnessed by 37,639 people at Home Park. Argyle played a friendly match against Brazilian giants Santos FC, who at the time were one of the best teams in the world. That day Santos also had arguably the best footballer of all time in their starting line-up \u2013Pel\u00e9. However, Argyle, then a Third Division side, shocked the world with a 3\u20132 win. The Greens were actually 3\u20130 up at one stage (thanks to goals from Mike Dowling, Derek Rickard and Jimmy Hinch) but a penalty scored at the Barn Park End by Pel\u00e9 helped a Santos fightback. However, in the end Santos came up short and were defeated. There was a huge pitch invasion at the final whistle after a win for The Pilgrims.\nIn 1974 \u2013 with future England striker and Argyle manager Paul Mariner now playing for the team \u2013 Argyle again reached the League Cup semi-final, this time as a Third Division side. Argyle drew the first leg at home against Manchester City 1\u20131, but lost the Maine Road encounter 2\u20130. After spending six years in Division Three, Argyle finally returned to Division Two in 1974\u201375, under the management of Tony Waiters. This was mainly thanks to strike partners Paul Mariner and Billy Rafferty, who scored a very impressive 46 goals between them. However, the club was back down again in 1977. Although the decade did end on a high note\u2013in 1978\u201379 Kevin Hodges made his Argyle debut, and he went on to play 620 games for the club\u2013more than any other player.\nIn 1984 Plymouth reached the FA Cup semi-final despite being in the Third Division. After a successful cup run in which Argyle beat West Bromwich Albion away, a top division team at the time (1\u20130 courtesy of a Tommy Tynan goal after 58 minutes), and Derby County (the first game at Home Park ended 0\u20130, but Argyle won the replay 0\u20131 at the Baseball Ground), they lost 1\u20130 to Watford in the semi-final at Villa Park courtesy of a George Reilly goal. However, manager John Hore was sacked during the following campaign and was replaced by Dave Smith. In 1985\u201386, Smith's first full season in charge, Argyle finished as runners-up in Division Three, resulting in promotion. The following season, despite being a newly promoted team, Argyle finished a respectable 7th place in Division Two, thereby narrowly missing the division's new play-off zone and the chance to move to the First Division (now the Premier League). In 1988 Smith surprisingly left to take charge of Dundee, making way for Ken Brown to become manager.\nSuccess and into the Championship (1986\u20132008).\nIn the 1990s a new face took over the club: Businessman Dan McCauley became chairman, and his first major decision was to sack Dave Kemp and appoint England's record cap holder Peter Shilton as player-manager in the 1991\u201392 season. But Shilton was unable to prevent relegation as Argyle finished 22nd in Division Two. Ahead of the 1992\u201393 season, English football had a revamp. The First Division (top tier) became the Premiership, Division Two (second tier) became Division One, Division Three (third tier) was now Division Two and so on. As a result, Argyle was still in Division Two, but it was now the third tier instead of the second.\nIn 1992\u201393 Argyle finished in mid-table in the third tier, but Peter Shilton's side finished third the following campaign (as a result of playing some excellent football), thereby qualifying for the play-offs. But Argyle lost in the semi-final against Burnley, which saw the start of a fierce rivalry between the two clubs. The Pilgrims suffered even more disappointment in 1994\u201395 as Shilton parted company with the club, which was eventually relegated to Division Three (fourth tier) for the first time in its history. Player Steve McCall became the club's manager on a short-term deal after Shilton's departure, but at the end of the season his contract was not renewed and Neil Warnock stepped in as his successor.\nAt the end of the 1995\u201396 season, Warnock took Plymouth to Division Three play-off glory in his first campaign as manager. The semi-final was a memorable affair. Argyle played Colchester United and although 1\u20130 down from the 1st leg, won 3\u20131 at Home Park in the 2nd, meaning that the Pilgrims were going to Wembley for the first time in their history. Argyle beat Darlington 1\u20130 in the play-off final to gain third-tier football once more.\nBut Warnock was sacked within a year as the club narrowly avoided being relegated back to the fourth tier. Mick Jones became his successor, and, that season, in February 1997 Argyle participated in 'The Battle of Saltergate' \u2013 in a 1\u20132 win at Chesterfield. The following season Argyle went down under Jones, and his successor Kevin Hodges (the club's record appearance holder) lasted three years before a failure to attain promotion (or even a play-off place) cost him his job. At this point Argyle was in danger of insolvency, and it was the lowest point in its history.\nThe appointment of Paul Sturrock as manager in November 2000 marked a turning point in Argyle's history. He saved the club from relegation out of the Football League (the club was fourth from bottom of the league when he became manager), and finished 12th in his first season. The following campaign proved to be the most successful in the club's history. Argyle defeated Cheltenham Town 2\u20130 in the final game of the season to achieve a club and league record of 102 points and clinch the Division Three title.\nArgyle was one of the favourites to win the Division Two title going into the 2003\u201304 season, and proved everyone right as the club earned its second promotion in three years. In March 2004 Bobby Williamson was appointed manager. Argyle's first game in the newly re-branded 'Championship' (second tier) saw them draw 0\u20130 at home to Millwall, who were FA Cup finalists the season before. Argyle's strong start continued, and the club briefly reached the top of the table \u2013 its highest ever position \u2013 after a 0\u20131 win at Cardiff City, before plummeting down the table and finishing 17th. The 2005\u201306 season included some memorable results for the Green Army including the 2\u20130 win against high-flying Wolverhampton Wanderers and a 0\u20130 draw at Leeds United, who went on to reach the play-off final at the Millennium Stadium before losing 3\u20130 to Watford. The Pilgrims finished 14th that season, in the end well clear of the relegation zone.\nIn summer 2006, in one of Ian Holloway's first games in charge of the club, Argyle played a pre-season friendly against Real Madrid in Austria, as both clubs were training in the country at the time. Holloway's first competitive game in charge was a 1\u20131 draw at home to Wolves. The team made significantly better progress than in recent seasons in the FA Cup, reaching the quarter-finals. They beat League Two Peterborough United. They beat Championship league leaders Derby County 2\u20130 in the next, but in the quarter finals, faced Premier League strugglers Watford at home and lost. Argyle finished the 2006\u201307 in 11th place, the highest league finish for 20 years.\nBefore the start of the 2007\u201308 season, manager Ian Holloway said that Plymouth was capable of earning promotion to the Premier League for the first time in its history, and the team made a good start to the new season with a 2\u20133 win at Hull City. The club's good start continued as they stayed near the play-off places for the first few months. However, on 21 November 2007 Ian Holloway controversially resigned to take charge of Leicester City.\nDecline and financial issues (2008\u20132018).\nThe club finished 2008 in 15th place\u2013now 8 points adrift of the play-offs. On 3 January 2009, Argyle travelled to the recently built Emirates Stadium to play against Premier League giants Arsenal in the FA Cup third round. Striker Robin Van Persie scored his second of the game five minutes from time to give Arsenal a 3\u20131 win. The club finished 21st in the league table, five points and one place clear of the relegation places\u2013Argyle's first season which didn't improve its league position for eight years.\nPaul Sturrock's second stint in charge came to an end on 10 December 2009, when a press conference confirmed he was relieved of his managerial duties due to two years of poor results and fan unrest. However, Mariner lost his first two games\u2013his first fixture resulted in a 2\u20130 loss at Preston North End and then Argyle was defeated 1\u20130 at home to Coventry, leaving the Pilgrims bottom of the table and six points adrift of safety. Argyle ended the season as the second lowest-scoring team in the division. The club's six-year stay in the second tier of the Football League was over. On 20 November, following a 1\u20132 home defeat to Brentford, newly relegated Argyle was 20th in League One, just one place and three points above the relegation zone.\nOn 23 November, Argyle came from 0\u20131 down to beat fellow strugglers Dagenham &amp; Redbridge 2\u20131 at Home Park, lifting them up to 15th. However, just 4,960 were present at the game. That was Argyle's lowest league attendance since playing in the bottom tier. Not long after, the Pilgrims were presented with a winding-up order by HMRC and appeared in court on 8 December, only to earn a 63-day adjournment so they could pay the taxes they owed. Relegation was later confirmed on 2 May, following a 3\u20131 home defeat against Southampton.\nJames Brent's Akkeron Group agreed to a deal with the Administrators to buy the club with Peter Ridsdale also confirming that he would leave the club when the deal had been completed. Further problems occurred with the Administrators threatening to quit the club. Argyle agreed to a deal to sell Home Park back to Plymouth council on 14 October for \u00a31.6m and had to pay \u00a3135,000 a year in rent. The team's form greatly improved after the takeover, and while the eventual League finish of 21st was the lowest in the club's history, the club still secured survival with three games to spare, which was quite an achievement considering it had been well adrift at the bottom for the first half of the campaign. In the following season, the club was again narrowly saved from relegation, and finished 21st for a consecutive season. Sheridan then agreed a three-year contract to continue as Argyle manager, and in his first full season in charge, the club finished 10th. Argyle had a far stronger start to its fourth consecutive season in League 2, winning 4 games consecutively for the first time since 2008.\nThe team had the chance to go up as champions. But the title was handed to Portsmouth via goal difference. The Pilgrims got off to an appalling start to their League One campaign, gaining only 5 points in their first 11 games and sitting rock bottom, already 4 points from safety after only 11 games. And a 2\u20131 defeat at home to Fleetwood added to Argyle's woes, extending the winless run to 10 games and earning just 2 points from a possible 30 in that time. Some fans disputed the board sacking Derek Adams even after taking them up in the previous season, due to poor tactics and game management. From December 2017, through 2018 saw Argyle record 16 wins, 6 draws and only 5 losses to escape relegation and finish 7th, only missing out on a play-off spot by 3 points.\nHallett takes over (2018\u2013present).\nIn August 2018, Hallett became the majority shareholder of the club, with James Brent reducing his stake, as well as stepping down as chairman. Hallett had originally appointed David Felwick CBE as Argyle's chairman-elect, but he cited \"personal reasons\" for being unable to takeover, so Hallett took over as chairman on 1 November 2018. At the end of the 2018\u201319 season, Argyle was relegated to League Two.\nAhead of the 2019\u201320 season, Hallett appointed Ryan Lowe as Derek Adams's successor, signing the then 40-year-old Liverpudlian and his assistant manager Steven Schumacher from Bury. The change in management was a success as that season, Argyle finished in third place, gaining promotion back to League One. Albeit, the next season the team struggled to find their footing in the third tier, and finished 18th on 53 points. The following season was an improvement, and in December 2021 Ryan Lowe was replaced by his assistant, Steven Schumacher leading the club into 7th place for the 2021\u201322 season.\nArgyle enjoyed its best season since 2008 in 2022\u201323, with the new Mayflower stand fully built, the capacity of Home Park rose to 17,900, and the club regularly saw 16,000 fans turning up to support the team. The club won the EFL League One title, clinching it in an away win at Port Vale, and finishing the season on 101 points. In their first season back in the second tier in thirteen years, Plymouth finished in 21st position, avoiding relegation on the final day of the season.\nIn the 2024\u201325 season, Plymouth, who were sitting at the bottom of the league table, defeated Premier League leaders Liverpool 1\u20130 at Home Park in the fourth round of the FA Cup with a goal from Ryan Hardie, having previously defeated Premier League Brentford in the third round at the Gtech Community Stadium.They then went on to lose 3-1 at Manchester City in the 5th round despite taking a shock 1-0 lead. 8,000 Argyle fans made the trip.\nSponsorship.\nThe club's current sportswear manufacturer is Puma. The club's main sponsor is currently Beacon Electrical. (https://www.pafc.co.uk/club/club-partners/beacon-electrical) Shirt sponsorship was first introduced by the club in 1983. Beacon Electrical was the first company to have its name on the shirt of Plymouth Argyle, but it lasted just one season. Ivor Jones Insurance was the next sponsor and their agreement with the club lasted for two seasons. National &amp; Provincial (now merged with Abbey National) were sponsors for the 1986\u201387 season before the club signed an agreement with the \"Sunday Independent\" which would last for five seasons. Rotolok Holdings plc became the club's major sponsor in 1992, which was owned by then Pilgrims chairman Dan McCauley. This lasted for six seasons before the club linked up with local newspaper the \"Evening Herald\". Between 2002 and 2011 the club was sponsored by Cornish pasty-makers Ginsters.\nIn 2011 with the club still in administration, local timber merchant WH Bond Timber sponsored Argyle's kits at first for the 2011\u201312 season and until the end of the 2013\u201314 season. Local construction access company LTC Group87 then sponsored Argyle from the start of the 2014\u201315 season, having their LTC Powered Access branch's logo on the shirts. Cornwall-based company Ginsters then came back for a second spell as main sponsor in the 2016\u201317 season.\nStadium.\nThe original ground of the professional club at Home Park was destroyed by German bombers during the Blitz on Plymouth in World War II. Having been rebuilt after the war, Home Park was largely demolished as part of an extensive process of renovation, and the first phase of a new stadium built by Barrs plc was completed in May 2002. The new Devonport End was opened for the 2001 Boxing Day fixture with Torquay United. The other end, the Barn Park End, opened on the same day. The Lyndhurst stand reopened on 26 January 2002 for the game against Oxford United. Plans are currently under discussion regarding the completion of the refurbishment of the ground with the replacement of the Mayflower stand. The ground is situated in Central Park, very near to the residential area of Peverell. Towards the end of the 2005\u201306 Championship season, the club decided to buy the stadium for \u00a32.7\u00a0million from Plymouth City Council, releasing the ground from a 125-year lease. This purchase was concluded in December 2006.\nIn the summer of 2007, the club, having failed to persuade the UK authorities of the case for retaining a standing terrace, decided to add 3,500 temporary seats to the Mayflower enclosure, dropping the capacity to 19,888 from 20,922. In December 2009 it was announced that the stadium was to be one of 12 chosen to host matches during the World Cup 2018, should England's bid be successful. The then Argyle chairman Paul Stapleton stated that work on a new South Stand at Home Park would start in 2010. However, England failed to be chosen for the 2018 tournament, and Plymouth Argyle entered administration in March 2011. After selling the stadium back to the council on 14 October 2011 for \u00a31.6 million, this project was in serious doubt.\nThe club was then taken over by local business owner James Brent, who submitted fresh plans to build a new Mayflower Grandstand with a 5,000 seating capacity, and an associated leisure complex. The plans include an ice rink with 1,500 spectator seats, a 10 screen cinema complex with an iMax screen, a 120 bedroom hotel and 4,200m sq retail units. Planning permission for the project was granted on 15 August 2013. The development was due to commence in September 2013, with the demolition of the old stand planned for late October 2013 after the Portsmouth home match. As of June 2015, the plans have been withdrawn, though planning permission still remains.\nThe family section of the stadium was moved from block 1 of the Devonport End to the 'Zoo corner' between the Lyndhurst Stand and the Barn Park End, with a kids activities zone in the concourse. In January 2017, director Simon Hallett invested \u00a35,000,000 into the club, along with all other directors exchanging previous loans into equity, with the intention on using the money for renovating the Mayflower Grandstand. No immediate timeframe was put on the renovations, but chairman James Brent indicated work is planned to start in 2018, finishing in 2020 ahead of the Plymouth 2020 Mayflower celebrations.\nLater that month, temporary seating was once again put in place on the Grandstand, this time as a one-off for an FA Cup 3rd round replay vs Liverpool. The seating was kept in place for the next home match, a League 2 game vs Devon rivals Exeter City, but tickets were not on sale to the general public. Shortly after this game, the seating was removed. In 2021 the redevelopment of the Mayflower stand was completed, expanding the ground's capacity to 17,900 and making it an all seater stadium.\nSupport.\nPlymouth Argyle fans are known collectively as the Green Army. The No.12 shirt has been reserved for the Green Army as the 12th man for many seasons.\nArgyle fans are often referred to as \"Janners\", the unofficial nickname used to describe residents of Plymouth. The 1940s saw the club attract the highest average attendances, with the largest ever being recorded in the 1946\u201347 season, when an average of 23,290 fans watched each game. Attendances remained fairly strong until the start of the 1980s, when, in the 1984\u201385, an average of just 537 attended each game, the lowest in the club's entire history. Albeit, the decline in attendances was notable throughout the entirety of English football during this period as they were some of the foremost decades of Football hooliganism.\nDuring this period, a hooligan firm named The Central Element emerged as a gang in the mid-1980s. It was set up by a group of 16-to-18-year-old friends from Plymouth who used to frequent pubs in Stonehouse and the city centre. The name was decided by founding members and makes reference to Central Park, where many encounters with rival firms took place. At the time, there was already an established hooligan element attached to Argyle, older men who later became known as the A38s. TCE had an all-male membership, aged 15 to 45, who followed Argyle home and away. Many held season tickets, but their interests were more about what happened off the pitch than on it. The group attempted to gain a reputation amongst larger firms whose teams were much, much higher up the football violence league, including Millwall's Bushwackers, Cardiff's Soul Crew and West Ham United's Inter City Firm.\nToday, the club's main base of supporters are those from the city of Plymouth but also from Cornwall to the west, and Devon (of which Plymouth is a historical part). The \"Devonport End\" is where the most vocal supporters watch the game.\nSince the 2021\u201322 season, The Janner Song has been played before every home game. A survey conducted by Football Fans Census in 2003 confirmed that Plymouth Argyle supporters consider their main rival to be Exeter City.

Although Mutley Plain is the main street of the dense suburb called Mutley, the term is often applied to the whole area. The road is now a busy dual-carriageway, the B3250, with eight sets of traffic lights/pelican crossings. It was built as a smart tree-lined avenue in late Victorian times and improved over the next half century as a local shopping place for its neighbourhood and the affluent area to the north.\nHistory.\nMutley Plain lies on the route of an ancient road linking Bilburgh, a Bronze Age settlement on the coast at Sutton Pool which later formed the nucleus of the city of Plymouth, to the north. Mutley was originally the name of two parishes to the west of this road in the valley of the Houndiscombe Brook, the land to the east being part of the parish of Lipson.\nBefore the Norman invasion in 1066, the parish of Higher Mutley was owned by a man named Alwin of Tamerton, and Lower Mutley by another man called Goodwin, but at the time of the Domesday Book (1086) both were owned by Odo, whose feudal overlord was Juhel of Totnes. In the Domesday Book the two parishes were said to be worth five shillings each. Lower Mutley had two farms while Higher Mutley consisted of ten sheep, one farm and two smallholdings.\nRailway.\nA tunnel was driven beneath Mutley Plain by the South Devon Railway Company and was opened to traffic on 2 April 1849. Formerly this was the site of Mutley Station, opened 1 August 1871 and known as the 'Station of the Gentry'. It was closed 2 March 1939. The Plymouth-bound platform can still be just made out to the south of Apsley Road. The cutting to the east of the station has been covered over by a car park. Plymouth Railway Station is on the boundary between Mutley Plain and Plymouth City Centre.\nPresent day.\nOwing to its proximity to the expanding Plymouth University and the city centre, large numbers of students now live in the area. There are many pubs, bars, restaurants, takeaways and cafes as well as three small supermarkets. There are also more than a dozen barbers and beauty salons along with a good few estate agents. There are secondary schools very close by at Ford Park and at the brow of North Hill.\nMutley Baptist Church is a notable architectural feature. The area is mostly built up except for a small park on Moor View Terrace however Central Park and Ford Park Cemetery are nearby."}

{"id": "23862", "revid": "50404235", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23862", "title": "Python (programming language)", "text": "General-purpose programming language\nPython is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation. Python is dynamically type-checked and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional programming.\nGuido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC programming language. Python\u00a03.0, released in 2008, was a major revision and not completely backward-compatible with earlier versions. Beginning with Python 3.5, capabilities and keywords for typing were added to the language, allowing optional static typing. Currently only versions in the 3.x series are supported. \nPython has gained widespread use in the machine learning community. It is widely taught as an introductory programming language. Since 2003, Python has consistently ranked in the top ten of the most popular programming languages in the TIOBE Programming Community Index, which ranks based on searches in 24 platforms.\nHistory.\nPython was conceived in the late 1980s by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde &amp; Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands. It was designed as a successor to the ABC programming language, which was inspired by SETL, capable of exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system. Python implementation began in December\u00a01989. Van Rossum first released it in 1991 as Python\u00a00.9.0. Van Rossum assumed sole responsibility for the project, as the lead developer, until 12 July 2018, when he announced his \"permanent vacation\" from responsibilities as Python's \"benevolent dictator for life\" (BDFL); this title was bestowed on him by the Python community to reflect his long-term commitment as the project's chief decision-maker. (He has since come out of retirement and is self-titled \"BDFL-emeritus\".) In January\u00a02019, active Python core developers elected a five-member Steering Council to lead the project.\nThe name \"Python\" derives from the British comedy series Monty Python's Flying Circus. (See .)\nPython 2.0 was released on 16 October 2000, featuring many new features such as list comprehensions, cycle-detecting garbage collection, reference counting, and Unicode support. Python 2.7's end-of-life was initially set for 2015, and then postponed to 2020 out of concern that a large body of existing code could not easily be forward-ported to Python\u00a03. It no longer receives security patches or updates. While Python 2.7 and older versions are officially unsupported, a different unofficial Python implementation, PyPy, continues to support Python 2, i.e., \"2.7.18+\" (plus 3.11), with the plus signifying (at least some) \"backported security updates\".\nPython\u00a03.0 was released on 3 December 2008, and was a major revision and not completely backward-compatible with earlier versions, with some new semantics and changed syntax. Python\u00a02.7.18, released in 2020, was the last release of Python\u00a02. Several releases in the Python 3.x series have added new syntax to the language, and made a few (considered very minor) backward-incompatible changes.\nAs of \u00a02025[ [update]], Python 3.14.0 is the latest stable release, and Python 3.13.9 was released a week later, all older 3.x versions had a security update down to Python 3.9.24 then again with 3.9.25, the final version in 3.9 series. Python 3.10 is, since November 2025, the oldest supported branch. Python 3.15 has an alpha released, and Android has a official downloadable executable available for Python 3.14. Releases receive two years of full support followed by three years of security support.\nDesign philosophy and features.\nPython is a multi-paradigm programming language. Object-oriented programming and structured programming are fully supported, and many of their features support functional programming and aspect-oriented programming \u2013 including metaprogramming and metaobjects. Many other paradigms are supported via extensions, including design by contract and logic programming. Python is often referred to as a \"'glue language\"' because it is purposely designed to be able to integrate components written in other languages.\nPython uses dynamic typing and a combination of reference counting and a cycle-detecting garbage collector for memory management. It uses dynamic name resolution (late binding), which binds method and variable names during program execution.\nPython's design offers some support for functional programming in the \"Lisp tradition\". It has , , and functions; list comprehensions, dictionaries, sets, and generator expressions. The standard library has two modules (codice_1 and codice_1) that implement functional tools borrowed from Haskell and Standard ML.\nPython's core philosophy is summarized in the Zen of Python (PEP 20) written by Tim Peters, which includes aphorisms such as these:\nHowever, Python has received criticism for violating these principles and adding unnecessary language bloat. Responses to these criticisms note that the Zen of Python is a guideline rather than a rule. The addition of some new features had been controversial: Guido van Rossum resigned as \"Benevolent Dictator for Life\" after conflict about adding the assignment expression operator in Python 3.8\u2009.\nNevertheless, rather than building all functionality into its core, Python was designed to be highly extensible via modules. This compact modularity has made it particularly popular as a means of adding programmable interfaces to existing applications. Van Rossum's vision of a small core language with a large standard library and easily extensible interpreter stemmed from his frustrations with ABC, which represented the opposite approach.\nPython claims to strive for a simpler, less-cluttered syntax and grammar, while giving developers a choice in their coding methodology. Python lacks do while loops, which Rossum considered harmful. In contrast to Perl's motto \"there is more than one way to do it\", Python advocates an approach where \"there should be one \u2013 and preferably only one \u2013 obvious way to do it\". In practice, however, Python provides many ways to achieve a given goal. There are at least three ways to format a string literal, with no certainty as to which one a programmer should use. Alex Martelli is a Fellow at the Python Software Foundation and Python book author; he wrote that \"To describe something as 'clever' is \"not\" considered a compliment in the Python culture.\"\nPython's developers typically prioritise readability over performance. For example, they reject patches to non-critical parts of the CPython reference implementation that would offer increases in speed that do not justify the cost of clarity and readability. Execution speed can be improved by moving speed-critical functions to extension modules written in languages such as C, or by using a just-in-time compiler like PyPy. Also, it is possible to transpile to other languages. However, this approach either fails to achieve the expected speed-up, since Python is a very dynamic language, or only a restricted subset of Python is compiled (with potential minor semantic changes).\nPython is meant to be a fun language to use. This goal is reflected in the name \u2013 a tribute to the British comedy group Monty Python \u2013 and in playful approaches to some tutorials and reference materials. For instance, some code examples use the terms \"spam\" and \"eggs\" (in reference to a Monty Python sketch), rather than the typical terms \"foo\" and \"bar\".\nA common neologism in the Python community is \"pythonic\", which has a broad range of meanings related to program style: Pythonic code may use Python idioms well; be natural or show fluency in the language; or conform with Python's minimalist philosophy and emphasis on readability.\nSyntax and semantics.\nPython is meant to be an easily readable language. Its formatting is visually uncluttered and often uses English keywords where other languages use punctuation. Unlike many other languages, it does not use curly brackets to delimit blocks, and semicolons after statements are allowed but rarely used. It has fewer syntactic exceptions and special cases than C or Pascal.\nIndentation.\nPython uses whitespace indentation, rather than curly brackets or keywords, to delimit blocks. An increase in indentation comes after certain statements; a decrease in indentation signifies the end of the current block. Thus, the program's visual structure accurately represents its semantic structure. This feature is sometimes termed the off-side rule. Some other languages use indentation this way; but in most, indentation has no semantic meaning. The recommended indent size is four spaces.\nStatements and control flow.\nPython's statements include the following:\nThe assignment statement (codice_3) binds a name as a reference to a separate, dynamically allocated object. Variables may subsequently be rebound at any time to any object. In Python, a variable name is a generic reference holder without a fixed data type; however, it always refers to \"some\" object with a type. This is called dynamic typing\u2014in contrast to statically-typed languages, where each variable may contain only a value of a certain type.\nPython does not support tail call optimization or first-class continuations; according to Van Rossum, the language never will. However, better support for coroutine-like functionality is provided by extending Python's generators. Before 2.5, generators were lazy iterators; data was passed unidirectionally out of the generator. From Python\u00a02.5 on, it is possible to pass data back into a generator function; and from version 3.3, data can be passed through multiple stack levels.\nExpressions.\nPython's expressions include the following:\nIn Python, a distinction between expressions and statements is rigidly enforced, in contrast to languages such as Common Lisp, Scheme, or Ruby. This distinction leads to duplicating some functionality, for example:\nA statement cannot be part of an expression; because of this restriction, expressions such as list and codice_67 comprehensions (and lambda expressions) cannot contain statements. As a particular case, an assignment statement such as cannot be part of the conditional expression of a conditional statement.\nTyping.\nPython uses duck typing, and it has typed objects but untyped variable names. Type constraints are not checked at definition time; rather, operations on an object may fail at usage time, indicating that the object is not of an appropriate type. Despite being dynamically typed, Python is strongly typed, forbidding operations that are poorly defined (e.g., adding a number and a string) rather than quietly attempting to interpret them.\nPython allows programmers to define their own types using classes, most often for object-oriented programming. New instances of classes are constructed by calling the class, for example, or ); the classes are instances of the metaclass codice_68 (which is an instance of itself), thereby allowing metaprogramming and reflection.\nBefore version 3.0, Python had two kinds of classes, both using the same syntax: \"old-style\" and \"new-style\". Current Python versions support the semantics of only the new style.\nPython supports optional type annotations. These annotations are not enforced by the language, but may be used by external tools such as mypy to catch errors. Python includes a module codice_69 including several type names for type annotations. Also, Mypy supports a Python compiler called mypyc, which leverages type annotations for optimization.\nArithmetic operations.\nPython includes conventional symbols for arithmetic operators (codice_31, codice_32, codice_33, codice_35), the floor-division operator codice_34, and the modulo operator codice_51. (With the modulo operator, a remainder can be negative, e.g., codice_76.) Also, Python offers the codice_36 symbol for exponentiation, e.g. codice_78 and codice_79. Also, it offers the matrix\u2011multiplication operator codice_39 . These operators work as in traditional mathematics; with the same precedence rules, the infix operators codice_31 and codice_32 can also be unary, to represent positive and negative numbers respectively.\nDivision between integers produces floating-point results. The behavior of division has changed significantly over time:\nIn Python terms, the codice_35 operator represents \"true division\" (or simply \"division\"), while the codice_34 operator represents \"floor division.\" Before version 3.0, the codice_35 operator represents \"classic division\".\nRounding towards negative infinity, though a different method than in most languages, adds consistency to Python. For instance, this rounding implies that the equation is always true. Also, the rounding implies that the equation is valid for both positive and negative values of codice_92. As expected, the result of codice_93 lies in the half-open interval [0, \"b\"), where codice_94 is a positive integer; however, maintaining the validity of the equation requires that the result must lie in the interval (\"b\", 0] when codice_94 is negative.\nPython provides a codice_96 function for rounding a float to the nearest integer. For tie-breaking, Python\u00a03 uses the \"round to even\" method: codice_97 and codice_98 both produce codice_99. Python versions before 3 used the round-away-from-zero method: codice_100 is codice_101, and codice_102 is codice_103.\nPython allows Boolean expressions that contain multiple equality relations to be consistent with general usage in mathematics. For example, the expression codice_104 tests whether codice_92 is less than codice_94 and codice_94 is less than codice_108. C-derived languages interpret this expression differently: in C, the expression would first evaluate codice_109, resulting in 0 or 1, and that result would then be compared with codice_108.\nPython uses arbitrary-precision arithmetic for all integer operations. The codice_111 type/class in the codice_112 module provides decimal floating-point numbers to a pre-defined arbitrary precision with several rounding modes. The codice_113 class in the codice_114 module provides arbitrary precision for rational numbers.\nDue to Python's extensive mathematics library and the third-party library NumPy, the language is frequently used for scientific scripting in tasks such as numerical data processing and manipulation.\nFunction syntax.\nFunctions are created in Python by using the codice_17 keyword. A function is defined similarly to how it is called, by first providing the function name and then the required parameters. Here is an example of a function that prints its inputs:\ndef printer(input1, input2 = \"already there\"):\n print(input1)\n print(input2)\nprinter(\"hello\")\nTo assign a default value to a function parameter in case no actual value is provided at run time, variable-definition syntax can be used inside the function header.\nCode examples.\n\"Hello, World!\" program:\nprint('Hello, World!')\nProgram to calculate the factorial of a non-negative integer:\ntext = input('Type a number, and its factorial will be printed: ')\nn = int(text)\nif n &lt; 0:\n raise ValueError('You must enter a non-negative integer')\nfactorial = 1\nfor i in range(2, n + 1):\n factorial *= i\nprint(factorial)\nLibraries.\nPython's large standard library is commonly cited as one of its greatest strengths. For Internet-facing applications, many standard formats and protocols such as MIME and HTTP are supported. The language includes modules for creating graphical user interfaces, connecting to relational databases, generating pseudorandom numbers, arithmetic with arbitrary-precision decimals, manipulating regular expressions, and unit testing.\nSome parts of the standard library are covered by specifications\u2014for example, the Web Server Gateway Interface (WSGI) implementation codice_116 follows PEP 333\u2014but most parts are specified by their code, internal documentation, and test suites. However, because most of the standard library is cross-platform Python code, only a few modules must be altered or rewritten for variant implementations.\nAs of 2025,[ [update]] the Python Package Index (PyPI), the official repository for third-party Python software, contains over 614,339 packages.\nDevelopment environments.\nMost Python implementations (including CPython) include a read\u2013eval\u2013print loop (REPL); this permits the environment to function as a command line interpreter, with which users enter statements sequentially and receive results immediately.\nAlso, CPython is bundled with an integrated development environment (IDE) called IDLE, which is oriented toward beginners.\nOther shells, including IDLE and IPython, add additional capabilities such as improved auto-completion, session-state retention, and syntax highlighting.\nStandard desktop IDEs include PyCharm, Spyder, and Visual Studio Code;there are web browser-based IDEs, such as the following environments:\nImplementations.\nReference implementation.\nCPython is the reference implementation of Python. This implementation is written in C, meeting the C11 standard since version 3.11. Older versions use the C89 standard with several select C99 features, but third-party extensions are not limited to older C versions\u2014e.g., they can be implemented using C11 or C++. CPython compiles Python programs into an intermediate bytecode, which is then executed by a virtual machine. CPython is distributed with a large standard library written in a combination of C and native Python.\nCPython is available for many platforms, including Windows and most modern Unix-like systems, including macOS (and Apple M1 Macs, since Python\u00a03.9.1, using an experimental installer). Starting with Python\u00a03.9, the Python installer intentionally fails to install on Windows 7 and 8; Windows XP was supported until Python\u00a03.5, with unofficial support for VMS. Platform portability was one of Python's earliest priorities. During development of Python\u00a01 and 2, even OS/2 and Solaris were supported; since that time, support has been dropped for many platforms.\nAll current Python versions (since 3.7) support only operating systems that feature multithreading, by now supporting not nearly as many operating systems (dropping many outdated) than in the past.\nOther implementations.\nAll alternative implementations have at least slightly different semantics. For example, an alternative may include unordered dictionaries, in contrast to other current Python versions. As another example in the larger Python ecosystem, PyPy does not support the full C Python API.\nCreating an executable with Python often is done by bundling an entire Python interpreter into the executable, which causes binary sizes to be massive for small programs, yet there exist implementations that are capable of truly compiling Python. Alternative implementations include the following:\nUnsupported implementations.\nStackless Python is a significant fork of CPython that implements microthreads. This implementation uses the call stack differently, thus allowing massively concurrent programs. PyPy also offers a stackless version.\nJust-in-time Python compilers have been developed, but are now unsupported:\nTranspilers to other languages.\nThere are several compilers/transpilers to high-level object languages; the source language is unrestricted Python, a subset of Python, or a language similar to Python:\nThere are also specialized compilers:\nSome older projects existed, as well as compilers not designed for use with Python 3.x and related syntax:\nPerformance.\nA performance comparison among various Python implementations, using a non-numerical (combinatorial) workload, was presented at EuroSciPy '13. In addition, Python's performance relative to other programming languages is benchmarked by The Computer Language Benchmarks Game.\nThere are several approaches to optimizing Python performance, despite the inherent slowness of an interpreted language. These approaches include the following strategies or tools:\nLanguage Development.\nPython's development is conducted mostly through the \"Python Enhancement Proposal\" (PEP) process; this process is the primary mechanism for proposing major new features, collecting community input on issues, and documenting Python design decisions. Python coding style is covered in PEP\u00a08. Outstanding PEPs are reviewed and commented on by the Python community and the steering council.\nEnhancement of the language corresponds with development of the CPython reference implementation. The mailing list python-dev is the primary forum for the language's development. Specific issues were originally discussed in the Roundup bug tracker hosted by the foundation. In 2022, all issues and discussions were migrated to GitHub. Development originally took place on a self-hosted source-code repository running Mercurial, until Python moved to GitHub in January 2017.\nCPython's public releases have three types, distinguished by which part of the version number is incremented:\nMany alpha, beta, and release-candidates are also released as previews and for testing before final releases. Although there is a rough schedule for releases, they are often delayed if the code is not ready yet. Python's development team monitors the state of the code by running a large unit test suite during development.\nThe major academic conference on Python is PyCon. Also, there are special Python mentoring programs, such as PyLadies.\nNaming.\nPython's name is inspired by the British comedy group Monty Python, whom Python creator Guido van Rossum enjoyed while developing the language. Monty Python references appear frequently in Python code and culture; for example, the metasyntactic variables often used in Python literature are \"spam\" and \"eggs\", rather than the traditional \"foo\" and \"bar\". Also, the official Python documentation contains various references to Monty Python routines. Python users are sometimes referred to as \"Pythonistas\".\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is structurally related to benzene, with one methine group replaced by a nitrogen atom . It is a highly flammable, weakly alkaline, water-miscible liquid with a distinctive, unpleasant fish-like smell. Pyridine is colorless, but older or impure samples can appear yellow. The pyridine ring occurs in many commercial compounds, including agrochemicals, pharmaceuticals, and vitamins. Historically, pyridine was produced from coal tar. As of 2016, it is synthesized on the scale of about 20,000 tons per year worldwide.\nProperties.\nPhysical properties.\nPyridine is diamagnetic. Its critical parameters are: pressure 5.63\u00a0MPa, temperature 619\u00a0K and volume 248\u00a0cm3/mol. In the temperature range 340\u2013426\u00a0K its vapor pressure \"p\" can be described with the Antoine equation\nformula_1\nwhere \"T\" is temperature, \"A\"\u00a0=\u00a04.16272, \"B\"\u00a0=\u00a01371.358\u00a0K and \"C\"\u00a0=\u00a0\u221258.496\u00a0K.\nStructure.\nPyridine ring forms a hexagon. Slight variations of the and distances as well as the bond angles are observed.\nPyridine crystallizes in an orthorhombic crystal system with space group \"Pna21\" and lattice parameters \"a\"\u00a0=\u00a01752\u00a0pm, \"b\"\u00a0=\u00a0897\u00a0pm, \"c\"\u00a0=\u00a01135\u00a0pm, and 16 formula units per unit cell (measured at 153\u00a0K). For comparison, crystalline benzene is also orthorhombic, with space group \"Pbca\", \"a\"\u00a0=\u00a0729.2\u00a0pm, \"b\"\u00a0=\u00a0947.1\u00a0pm, \"c\"\u00a0=\u00a0674.2\u00a0pm (at 78\u00a0K), but the number of molecules per cell is only 4. This difference is partly related to the lower symmetry of the individual pyridine molecule (C2v vs D6h for benzene). A trihydrate (pyridine\u00b73H2O) is known; it also crystallizes in an orthorhombic system in the space group \"Pbca\", lattice parameters \"a\"\u00a0=\u00a01244\u00a0pm, \"b\"\u00a0=\u00a01783\u00a0pm, \"c\"\u00a0=\u00a0679\u00a0pm and eight formula units per unit cell (measured at 223\u00a0K).\nSpectroscopy.\nThe optical absorption spectrum of pyridine in hexane consists of bands at the wavelengths of 195, 251, and 270\u00a0nm. With respective extinction coefficients (\"\u03b5\") of 7500, 2000, and 450\u00a0L\u00b7mol\u22121\u00b7cm\u22121, these bands are assigned to \u03c0\u00a0\u2192\u00a0\u03c0*, \u03c0\u00a0\u2192\u00a0\u03c0*, and n\u00a0\u2192\u00a0\u03c0* transitions. The compound displays very low fluorescence.\nThe 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrum shows signals for \u03b1-(\u03b4 8.5), \u03b3-(\u03b47.5) and \u03b2-protons (\u03b47). By contrast, the proton signal for benzene is found at \u03b47.27. The larger chemical shifts of the \u03b1- and \u03b3-protons in comparison to benzene result from the lower electron density in the \u03b1- and \u03b3-positions, which can be derived from the resonance structures. The situation is rather similar for the 13C\u00a0NMR spectra of pyridine and benzene: pyridine shows a triplet at \"\u03b4\"(\u03b1-C)\u00a0=\u00a0150\u00a0ppm, \u03b4(\u03b2-C)\u00a0=\u00a0124\u00a0ppm and \u03b4(\u03b3-C)\u00a0=\u00a0136\u00a0ppm, whereas benzene has a single line at 129\u00a0ppm. All shifts are quoted for the solvent-free substances. Pyridine is conventionally detected by the gas chromatography and mass spectrometry methods.\nBonding.\nPyridine has a conjugated system of six \u03c0 electrons that are delocalized over the ring. The molecule is planar and, thus, follows the H\u00fcckel criteria for aromatic systems. In contrast to benzene, the electron density is not evenly distributed over the ring, reflecting the negative inductive effect of the nitrogen atom. For this reason, pyridine has a dipole moment and a weaker resonant stabilization than benzene (resonance energy 117\u00a0kJ/mol in pyridine vs. 150\u00a0kJ/mol in benzene).\nThe ring atoms in the pyridine molecule are sp2-hybridized. The nitrogen is involved in the \u03c0-bonding aromatic system using its unhybridized p orbital. The lone pair is in an sp2 orbital, projecting outward from the ring in the same plane as the \u03c3 bonds. As a result, the lone pair does not contribute to the aromatic system but importantly influences the chemical properties of pyridine, as it easily supports bond formation via an electrophilic attack. However, because of the separation of the lone pair from the aromatic ring system, the nitrogen atom cannot exhibit a positive mesomeric effect.\nMany analogues of pyridine are known where N is replaced by other heteroatoms from the same column of the Periodic Table of Elements (see figure below). Substitution of one C\u2013H in pyridine with a second N gives rise to the diazine heterocycles (C4H4N2), with the names pyridazine, pyrimidine, and pyrazine.\nHistory.\nImpure pyridine was undoubtedly prepared by early alchemists by heating animal bones and other organic matter, but the earliest documented reference is attributed to the Scottish scientist Thomas Anderson. In 1849, Anderson examined the contents of the oil obtained through high-temperature heating of animal bones. Among other substances, he separated from the oil a colorless liquid with unpleasant odor, from which he isolated pure pyridine two years later. He described it as highly soluble in water, readily soluble in concentrated acids and salts upon heating, and only slightly soluble in oils.\nOwing to its flammability, Anderson named the new substance \"pyridine\", after (pyr) meaning \"fire\". The suffix \"idine\" was added in compliance with the chemical nomenclature, as in \"toluidine\", to indicate a cyclic compound containing a nitrogen atom.\nThe chemical structure of pyridine was determined decades after its discovery. Wilhelm K\u00f6rner (1869) and James Dewar (1871) suggested that, in analogy between quinoline and naphthalene, the structure of pyridine is derived from benzene by substituting one C\u2013H unit with a nitrogen atom. The suggestion by K\u00f6rner and Dewar was later confirmed in an experiment where pyridine was reduced to piperidine with sodium in ethanol. In 1876, William Ramsay combined acetylene and hydrogen cyanide into pyridine in a red-hot iron-tube furnace. This was the first synthesis of a heteroaromatic compound.\nThe first major synthesis of pyridine derivatives was described in 1881 by Arthur Rudolf Hantzsch. The Hantzsch pyridine synthesis typically uses a 2:1:1 mixture of a \u03b2-keto acid (often acetoacetate), an aldehyde (often formaldehyde), and ammonia or its salt as the nitrogen donor. First, a double hydrogenated pyridine is obtained, which is then oxidized to the corresponding pyridine derivative. Emil Knoevenagel showed that asymmetrically substituted pyridine derivatives can be produced with this process.\nThe contemporary methods of pyridine production had a low yield, and the increasing demand for the new compound urged to search for more efficient routes. A breakthrough came in 1924 when the Russian chemist Aleksei Chichibabin invented a pyridine synthesis reaction, which was based on inexpensive reagents. This method is still used for the industrial production of pyridine.\nOccurrence.\nPyridine is not abundant in nature, except for the leaves and roots of belladonna (\"Atropa belladonna\") and in marshmallow (\"Althaea officinalis\"). Pyridine derivatives, however, are often part of biomolecules such as alkaloids.\nIn daily life, trace amounts of pyridine are components of the volatile organic compounds that are produced in roasting and canning processes, e.g. in fried chicken, sukiyaki, roasted coffee, potato chips, and fried bacon. Traces of pyridine can be found in Beaufort cheese, vaginal secretions, black tea, saliva of those suffering from gingivitis, and sunflower honey.\nTrace amounts of up to 16\u00a0\u03bcg/m3 have been detected in tobacco smoke. Minor amounts of pyridine are released into environment from some industrial processes such as steel manufacture, processing of oil shale, coal gasification, coking plants and incinerators. The atmosphere at oil shale processing plants can contain pyridine concentrations of up to 13\u00a0\u03bcg/m3, and 53\u00a0\u03bcg/m3 levels were measured in the groundwater in the vicinity of a coal gasification plant. According to a study by the US National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, about 43,000 Americans work in contact with pyridine.\nIn foods.\nPyridine has historically been added to foods to give them a bitter flavour, although this practise is now banned in the U.S. It may still be added to ethanol to make it unsuitable for drinking.\nProduction.\nHistorically, pyridine was extracted from coal tar or obtained as a byproduct of coal gasification. The process is labor-consuming and inefficient: coal tar contains only about 0.1% pyridine, and therefore a multi-stage purification was required, which further reduced the output. Nowadays, most pyridines are synthesized from ammonia, aldehydes, and nitriles, a few combinations of which are suited for pyridine itself. Various name reactions are also known, but they are not practiced on scale.\nIn 1989, 26,000 tonnes of pyridine was produced worldwide. Other major derivatives are 2-, 3-, 4-methylpyridines and 5-ethyl-2-methylpyridine. The combined scale of these alkylpyridines matches that of pyridine itself. Among the largest 25 production sites for pyridine, eleven are located in Europe (as of 1999). The major producers of pyridine include Evonik Industries, R\u00fctgers Chemicals, Jubilant Life Sciences, Imperial Chemical Industries, and Koei Chemical. Pyridine production significantly increased in the early 2000s, with an annual production capacity of 30,000 tonnes in mainland China alone. The US\u2013Chinese joint venture Vertellus is currently the world leader in pyridine production.\nChichibabin synthesis.\nThe Chichibabin pyridine synthesis was reported in 1924 and the basic approach underpins several industrial routes. In its general form, the reaction involves the condensation reaction of aldehydes, ketones, \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated carbonyl compounds, or any combination of the above, in ammonia or ammonia derivatives. Application of the Chichibabin pyridine synthesis suffer from low yields, often about 30%, however the precursors are inexpensive. In particular, unsubstituted pyridine is produced from formaldehyde and acetaldehyde. First, acrolein is formed in a Knoevenagel condensation from the acetaldehyde and formaldehyde. The acrolein then condenses with acetaldehyde and ammonia to give dihydropyridine, which is oxidized to pyridine. This process is carried out in a gas phase at 400\u2013450\u00a0\u00b0C. Typical catalysts are modified forms of alumina and silica. The reaction has been tailored to produce various methylpyridines.\nDealkylation and decarboxylation of substituted pyridines.\nPyridine can be prepared by dealkylation of alkylated pyridines, which are obtained as byproducts in the syntheses of other pyridines. The oxidative dealkylation is carried out either using air over vanadium(V) oxide catalyst, by vapor-dealkylation on nickel-based catalyst, or hydrodealkylation with a silver- or platinum-based catalyst. Yields of pyridine up to be 93% can be achieved with the nickel-based catalyst. Pyridine can also be produced by the decarboxylation of nicotinic acid with copper chromite.\nB\u00f6nnemann cyclization.\nThe trimerization of a part of a nitrile molecule and two parts of acetylene into pyridine is called B\u00f6nnemann cyclization. This modification of the Reppe synthesis can be activated either by heat or by light. While the thermal activation requires high pressures and temperatures, the photoinduced cycloaddition proceeds at ambient conditions with CoCp2(cod) (Cp = cyclopentadienyl, cod = 1,5-cyclooctadiene) as a catalyst, and can be performed even in water. A series of pyridine derivatives can be produced in this way. When using acetonitrile as the nitrile, 2-methylpyridine is obtained, which can be dealkylated to pyridine.\nOther methods.\nThe Kr\u00f6hnke pyridine synthesis provides a fairly general method for generating substituted pyridines using pyridine itself as a reagent which does not become incorporated into the final product. The reaction of pyridine with bromomethyl ketones gives the related pyridinium salt, wherein the methylene group is highly acidic. This species undergoes a Michael-like addition to \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated carbonyls in the presence of ammonium acetate to undergo ring closure and formation of the targeted substituted pyridine as well as pyridinium bromide.\nThe Ciamician\u2013Dennstedt rearrangement entails the ring-expansion of pyrrole with dichlorocarbene to 3-chloropyridine.\nIn the Gattermann\u2013Skita synthesis, a malonate ester salt reacts with dichloromethylamine.\nOther methods include the Boger pyridine synthesis and Diels\u2013Alder reaction of an alkene and an oxazole.\nBiosynthesis.\nSeveral pyridine derivatives play important roles in biological systems. While its biosynthesis is not fully understood, nicotinic acid (vitamin B3) occurs in some bacteria, fungi, and mammals. Mammals synthesize nicotinic acid through oxidation of the amino acid tryptophan, where an intermediate product, the aniline derivative kynurenine, creates a pyridine derivative, quinolinate and then nicotinic acid. On the contrary, the bacteria \"Mycobacterium tuberculosis\" and \"Escherichia coli\" produce nicotinic acid by condensation of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate and aspartic acid.\nReactions.\nThe reactivity of pyridine can be distinguished for three chemical groups. With electrophiles, electrophilic substitution takes place where pyridine expresses aromatic properties. With nucleophiles, pyridine reacts at positions 2 and 4 and thus behaves similar to imines and carbonyls. The reaction with many Lewis acids results in the addition to the nitrogen atom of pyridine, which is similar to the reactivity of tertiary amines. The ability of pyridine and its derivatives to oxidize, forming amine oxides (\"N\"-oxides), is also a feature of tertiary amines.\nBecause of the electronegative nitrogen in the pyridine ring, pyridine enters less readily into electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions than benzene derivatives. Instead, in terms of its reactivity, pyridine resembles nitrobenzene. That is, pyridine reacts most easily in nucleophilic substitution, as evidenced by the ease of metalation by strong organometallic bases. \nThe nitrogen center of pyridine features a basic lone pair of electrons. This lone pair does not overlap with the aromatic \u03c0-system ring, consequently pyridine is basic, having chemical properties similar to those of tertiary amines. Protonation gives the conjugate acid, a pyridinium cation, C5H5NH+. The p\"K\"a of pyridinium is 5.25. The structures of pyridine and pyridinium are almost identical, but the latter is isoelectronic with benzene. Pyridinium \"p\"-toluenesulfonate (PPTS) is an illustrative pyridinium salt; it is produced by treating pyridine with \"p\"-toluenesulfonic acid. \nIn addition to protonation, pyridine undergoes N-centred alkylation, acylation, and \"N\"-oxidation.\nElectrophilic substitutions.\nOwing to the decreased electron density in the aromatic system, electrophilic substitutions are suppressed in pyridine and its derivatives. Friedel\u2013Crafts alkylation or acylation, usually fail for pyridine because they lead only to the addition at the nitrogen atom. Substitutions usually occur at the 3-position, which is the most electron-rich carbon atom in the ring and is, therefore, more susceptible to an electrophilic addition.\nDirect nitration of pyridine is sluggish. Pyridine derivatives wherein the nitrogen atom is screened sterically and/or electronically can be obtained by nitration with nitronium tetrafluoroborate (NO2BF4). In this way, 3-nitropyridine can be obtained via the synthesis of 2,6-dibromopyridine followed by nitration and debromination.\nSulfonation of pyridine is even more difficult than nitration. However, pyridine-3-sulfonic acid can be obtained. Reaction with the SO3 group also facilitates addition of sulfur to the nitrogen atom, especially in the presence of a mercury(II) sulfate catalyst.\nIn contrast to the sluggish nitrations and sulfonations, the bromination and chlorination of pyridine proceed well.\nSome electrophilic substitutions on the pyridine are usefully effected using pyridine \"N\"-oxide followed by deoxygenation. Addition of oxygen suppresses further reactions at nitrogen atom and promotes substitution at the 2- and 4-carbons. The oxygen atom can then be removed, e.g., using zinc dust.\nNucleophilic substitutions.\nIn contrast to benzene ring, pyridine efficiently supports several nucleophilic substitutions. The reason for this is relatively lower electron density of the carbon atoms of the ring. These reactions include substitutions with elimination of a hydride ion and elimination-additions with formation of an intermediate aryne configuration, and usually proceed at the 2- or 4-position.\nThe hydride ion is a poor leaving group and direct substitution on the bare pyridine ring occurs in only a few heterocyclic reactions. They include the Chichibabin reaction, which yields pyridine derivatives aminated at the 2-position. Here, sodium amide is used as the nucleophile yielding 2-aminopyridine. The hydride ion released in this reaction combines with a proton of an available amino group, forming a hydrogen molecule.\nSubstitutions occur more easily not with bare pyridine but with pyridine modified with bromine, chlorine, fluorine, or sulfonic acid fragments that then become a leaving group. Fluorine is the best leaving group for the substitution with organolithium compounds. The nucleophilic attack compounds may be alkoxides, thiolates, amines, and ammonia (at elevated pressures).\nAnalogous to benzene, nucleophilic substitutions to pyridine can result in the formation of pyridyne intermediates as heteroaryne. For this purpose, pyridine derivatives can be eliminated with good leaving groups using strong bases such as sodium and potassium tert-butoxide. The subsequent addition of a nucleophile to the triple bond has low selectivity, and the result is a mixture of the two possible adducts.\nRadical reactions.\nPyridine supports a series of radical reactions, which is used in its dimerization to bipyridines. Radical dimerization of pyridine with elemental sodium or Raney nickel selectively yields 4,4'-bipyridine, or 2,2'-bipyridine, which are important precursor reagents in the chemical industry. One of the name reactions involving free radicals is the Minisci reaction. It can produce 2-\"tert\"-butylpyridine upon reacting pyridine with pivalic acid, silver nitrate and ammonium in sulfuric acid with a yield of 97%.\nReactions on the nitrogen atom.\nLewis acids easily add to the nitrogen atom of pyridine, forming pyridinium salts. The reaction with alkyl halides leads to alkylation of the nitrogen atom. This creates a positive charge in the ring that increases the reactivity of pyridine to both oxidation and reduction. The Zincke reaction is used for the selective introduction of radicals in pyridinium compounds (it has no relation to the chemical element zinc).\nOxidation of pyridine occurs at nitrogen to give pyridine \"N\"-oxide. The oxidation can be achieved with peracids:\nC5H5N + RCO3H \u2192 C5H5NO + RCO2H\nHydrogenation and reduction.\nPiperidine is produced by hydrogenation of pyridine with a nickel-, cobalt-, or ruthenium-based catalyst at elevated temperatures. The hydrogenation of pyridine to piperidine releases 193.8\u00a0kJ/mol, which is slightly less than the energy of the hydrogenation of benzene (205.3\u00a0kJ/mol).\nPartially hydrogenated derivatives are obtained under milder conditions. For example, reduction with lithium aluminium hydride yields a mixture of 1,4-dihydropyridine, 1,2-dihydropyridine, and 2,5-dihydropyridine. Selective synthesis of 1,4-dihydropyridine is achieved in the presence of organometallic complexes of magnesium and zinc, and (\u03943,4)-tetrahydropyridine is obtained by electrochemical reduction of pyridine. Birch reduction converts pyridine to dihydropyridines.\nLewis basicity and coordination compounds.\nPyridine is a Lewis base, donating its pair of electrons to a Lewis acid. Its Lewis base properties are discussed in the ECW model. Its relative donor strength toward a series of acids, versus other Lewis bases, can be illustrated by C-B plots. One example is the sulfur trioxide pyridine complex (melting point 175\u00a0\u00b0C), which is a sulfation agent used to convert alcohols to sulfate esters. Pyridine-borane (, melting point 10\u201311\u00a0\u00b0C) is a mild reducing agent.\nTransition metal pyridine complexes are numerous. \nTypical octahedral complexes have the stoichiometry and . Octahedral homoleptic complexes of the type are rare or tend to dissociate pyridine. Numerous square planar complexes are known, such as Crabtree's catalyst. The pyridine ligand replaced during the reaction is restored after its completion.\nThe \"\u03b7\"6 coordination mode, as occurs in \"\u03b7\"6 benzene complexes, is observed only in sterically encumbered derivatives that block the nitrogen center.\nApplications.\nPesticides and pharmaceuticals.\nThe main use of pyridine is as a precursor to the herbicides paraquat and diquat. The first synthesis step of insecticide chlorpyrifos consists of the chlorination of pyridine. Pyridine is also the starting compound for the preparation of pyrithione-based fungicides. Cetylpyridinium and laurylpyridinium, which can be produced from pyridine with a Zincke reaction, are used as antiseptic in oral and dental care products. Pyridine is easily attacked by alkylating agents to give \"N\"-alkylpyridinium salts. One example is cetylpyridinium chloride.\nIt is also used in the textile industry to improve network capacity of cotton.\nLaboratory use.\nPyridine is used as a polar, basic, low-reactive solvent, for example in Knoevenagel condensations. It is especially suitable for the dehalogenation, where it acts as the base for the elimination reaction. In esterifications and acylations, pyridine activates the carboxylic acid chlorides and anhydrides. Even more active in these reactions are the derivatives 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) and 4-(1-pyrrolidinyl) pyridine. Pyridine is also used as a base in some condensation reactions.\nReagents.\nAs a base, pyridine can be used as the Karl Fischer reagent, but it is usually replaced by alternatives with a more pleasant odor, such as imidazole.\nPyridinium chlorochromate, pyridinium dichromate, and the Collins reagent (the complex of chromium(VI) oxide) are used for the oxidation of alcohols.\nHazards.\nPyridine is a toxic, flammable liquid with a strong and unpleasant fishy odour. Its odour threshold of 0.04 to 20 ppm is close to its threshold limit of 5\u00a0ppm for adverse effects, thus most (but not all) adults will be able to tell when it is present at harmful levels. Pyridine easily dissolves in water and harms both animals and plants in aquatic systems.\nFire.\nPyridine has a flash point of 20\u00a0\u00b0C and is therefore highly flammable. Combustion produces toxic fumes which can include bipyridines, nitrogen oxides, and carbon monoxide.\nShort-term exposure.\nPyridine can cause chemical burns on contact with the skin and its fumes may be irritating to the eyes or upon inhalation. Pyridine depresses the nervous system giving symptoms similar to intoxication with vapor concentrations of above 3600\u00a0ppm posing a greater health risk. The effects may have a delayed onset of several hours and include dizziness, headache, lack of coordination, nausea, salivation, and loss of appetite. They may progress into abdominal pain, pulmonary congestion and unconsciousness. The lowest known lethal dose (LDLo) for the ingestion of pyridine in humans is 500\u00a0mg/kg.\nLong-term exposure.\nProlonged exposure to pyridine may result in liver, heart and kidney damage. Evaluations as a possible carcinogenic agent showed that there is inadequate evidence in humans for the carcinogenicity of pyridine, although there is sufficient evidence in experimental animals. Therefore, IARC considers pyridine as possibly carcinogenic to humans (Group 2B).\nMetabolism.\nExposure to pyridine would normally lead to its inhalation and absorption in the lungs and gastrointestinal tract, where it either remains unchanged or is metabolized. The major products of pyridine metabolism are \"N\"-methylpyridiniumhydroxide, which are formed by \"N\"-methyltransferases (e.g., pyridine \"N\"-methyltransferase), as well as pyridine \"N\"-oxide, and 2-, 3-, and 4-hydroxypyridine, which are generated by the action of monooxygenase. In humans, pyridine is metabolized only into \"N\"-methylpyridiniumhydroxide.\nEnvironmental fate.\nPyridine is readily degraded by bacteria to ammonia and carbon dioxide. The unsubstituted pyridine ring degrades more rapidly than picoline, lutidine, chloropyridine, or aminopyridines, and a number of pyridine degraders have been shown to overproduce riboflavin in the presence of pyridine. Ionizable \"N\"-heterocyclic compounds, including pyridine, interact with environmental surfaces (such as soils and sediments) via multiple pH-dependent mechanisms, including partitioning to soil organic matter, cation exchange, and surface complexation. Such adsorption to surfaces reduces bioavailability of pyridines for microbial degraders and other organisms, thus slowing degradation rates and reducing ecotoxicity.\nNomenclature.\nThe systematic name of pyridine, within the Hantzsch\u2013Widman nomenclature recommended by the IUPAC, is \"azinine\". However, systematic names for simple compounds are used very rarely; instead, heterocyclic nomenclature follows historically established common names. IUPAC discourages the use of azinine\"/\"azine in favor of \"pyridine\". The numbering of the ring atoms in pyridine starts at the nitrogen (see infobox). An allocation of positions by letter of the Greek alphabet (\u03b1-\u03b3) and the substitution pattern nomenclature common for homoaromatic systems (\"ortho\", \"meta\", \"para\") are used sometimes. Here \u03b1 (\"ortho\"), \u03b2 (\"meta\"), and \u03b3 (\"para\") refer to the 2, 3, and 4 position, respectively. The systematic name for the pyridine derivatives is \"pyridinyl\", wherein the position of the substituted atom is preceded by a number. However, the historical name \"pyridyl\" is encouraged by the IUPAC and used instead of the systematic name. The cationic derivative formed by the addition of an electrophile to the nitrogen atom is called \"pyridinium\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

These cars were typically procured directly from dealerships, with minimal alterations made to meet the demands of the racetrack. The affordability and accessibility of stock cars allowed racing enthusiasts from all walks of life to participate, contributing to the growth and popularity of the sport. \nAs the sport evolved, so did the modifications made to the stock cars. Drivers started customizing their vehicles by enhancing performance and safety features, such as reinforcing chassis frames, installing roll cages, and improving engines and suspension systems. These modifications allowed the stock cars to withstand the intense demands of racing, turning them into formidable competitive machines.\nThese modifications increased the cost to compete, and in order to attract new competitors, race promotors responded by adding new divisions for \"lesser modified\" passenger cars.\nRequirements for these introductory divisions can vary greatly, but all are based on a full-bodied passenger vehicle and an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) production engine. Roll cages must be welded into the frame, and all glass, vinyl, upholstery and lights must be removed from the vehicle. \nIn various regions, they may be known as hobby stocks, street stocks, pure stocks, bombers, factory stocks or stingers. In British oval racing, the term \"production car racing\" has been used as an alternative for hot rods, as run in the West Country during the late 1960s to the mid-1970s, and a production car world championships. The West Country production cars were later reclassified as hot rods to come in line with the country's other promoters although this causes some confusion with the history of the West country racing as there was another class called hot rods that ran on those tracks. \nThe major U.S. sanctioning organizations \u2013 International Motor Contest Association (IMCA), DIRTcar, NASCAR, and Championship Racing Association (CRA/ASA) -- generally promote these classes as one of three levels: entry, intermediate, or advanced.\nEntry-level.\nThe Sport Compact (IMCA, DIRTcar) or Pure Stock (NASCAR) or Mini-Stock or Bomber divisions are the lowest entry-level racing class. Four-passenger vehicles with a four-cylinder or limited six-cylinder engines, the rules for these race cars mandate a stock body and a stock suspension. The vehicles can be made race ready for $500 to $2,000, and involve merely gutting the interior and adding a racing seat and roll cage. \nIntermediate.\nThe Hobby Stock (IMCA) or Factory Stock (DIRTcar) or Thunder Car (NASCAR) are also divisions designed to give new competitors the chance to go racing. The body and frame must match, and very few alterations are allowed to the stock frame and suspension. The engines produce roughly 300 horsepower and must reflect the correct pairing to the model. Racers can generally build competitive cars for between $3,500 and $10,000. \nAdvanced.\nThe Stock (IMCA, DIRTcar) or Street Stock (NASCAR, CRA/ASA) or Pro Stock (DIRTcar Northeast) divisions characteristically have bigger engines that produce roughly 360 horsepower, yet still require an OEM passenger vehicle production block. The rules also allow for some changes to the suspension, including the addition of screw jacks. While a used race car can be purchased for around $6,500, competitive stock cars can cost upwards of $25,000.\nTouring car racing.\nMany production racing categories are based on particular makes of cars. There are many Porsche and Audi racing series around the world. These are also called \"one make series\". Some series use a handicapped start, where the smaller cars are released up to 45 seconds ahead of the larger cars, and are slowly caught, the idea being that all the cars are together at the finish of the race. Many series follow the group N regulation with a few exceptions. There are several different series that have run all over the world, most notably, Japan's Super Taikyu and IMSA's Firehawk Series which ran between the 1980s to 1990s all over the United States.\nCars usually have a protective roll cage and run race tires (either slicks or radials). Some freedoms are allowed, like gearbox coolers, giving the cars increased performance and components longevity. Production car racing, known in the US as \"showroom stock\", is an economical and rules restricted version of touring car racing.\nMajor races include the Bathurst 6 Hour, Bahrain 24 Hour, Dubai 24 Hour and Malaysian 12 Hour and sanctioned by organisations such as the FIA and SCCA. Normally using an entry-level formula, it has grown into a stand-alone series, with national, state and club events and championships. The first NASCAR \"strictly stock\" race was held at Charlotte Speedway, on June 19, 1949. Where a racing class requires that the cars raced be production vehicles only slightly adapted for racing, manufacturers typically produce a limited run of such vehicles for public sale so that they can legitimately race them in the class. These cars are commonly called \"homologation specials\".\nDrag racing.\nThe World Drag Alliances (WDRA), which operates in the U.S., Canada, and Aruba provides a \"Factory Street\" class for factory produced vehicles to race legally and safely on a drag strip. The regulations for Factory Street vehicles rely on the manufacturers unaltered standard safety features of the vehicle to. All the vehicle\u2019s original and unaltered OEM safety equipment is mandatory and must be fully functional.\nThe National Hot Rod Association (NHRA) promotes a \"Stock \" class in the U.S. and Canada where virtually any car is eligible to compete, and entries are classified using a system that divides factory shipping weight by a horsepower factor. Bodies must be unaltered and retain a full factory interior. Engines must be correct for the make and model vehicle and must retain stock cylinder heads, intake manifold, and carburetor. The NHRA has developed a Stock Car Classification Guide to position a vehicle in its proper class.\nThe International Hot Rod Association (IHRA) has included a \"Sportsman\" class which is open to door cars only. Electronics, pneumatics, hydraulics, throttle timers, staging controllers and counters prohibited, as are or any other device which may way affect the throttle operation.\nIn Australia, the IHRA promotes a \"Real Street\" class, which requires the vehicles be legally registered and licensed.\nEvery September at Mid-Michigan Raceway in Stanton, hosts the Pure Stock Muscle Car Drag Race. The event hosts classic drag racing with stock (or nearly stock) U.S. muscle cars factory built between 1955 and 1979.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The simplest is phenol, C6H5OH. Phenolic compounds are classified as simple phenols or polyphenols based on the number of phenol units in the molecule.\nPhenols are both synthesized industrially and produced by plants and microorganisms.\nProperties.\nAcidity.\nPhenols are more acidic than typical alcohols. The acidity of the hydroxyl group in phenols is commonly intermediate between that of aliphatic alcohols and carboxylic acids (their pKa is usually between 10 and 12). Deprotonation of a phenol forms a corresponding negative phenolate ion or phenoxide ion, and the corresponding salts are called phenolates or phenoxides (aryloxides, according to the IUPAC Gold Book).\nCondensation with aldehydes and ketones.\nPhenols are susceptible to electrophilic aromatic substitutions. Condensation with formaldehyde gives resinous materials, famously Bakelite.\nAnother industrial-scale electrophilic aromatic substitution is the production of bisphenol A, which is produced by the condensation with acetone.\nC-Alkylation with alkenes.\nPhenol is readily alkylated at the ortho positions using alkenes in the presence of a Lewis acid such as aluminium phenoxide:\n CH2=CR2 + C6H5OH \u2192 R2CHCH2-2-C6H4OH\nMore than 100,000 tons of tert-butyl phenols are produced annually (year: 2000) in this way, using isobutylene (CH2=CMe2) as the alkylating agent. Especially important is 2,6-ditert-butylphenol, a versatile antioxidant.\nOther reactions.\nPhenols undergo esterification. Phenol esters are active esters, being prone to hydrolysis. Phenols are reactive species toward oxidation. Oxidative cleavage, for instance cleavage of 1,2-dihydroxybenzene to the monomethylester of 2,4-hexadienedioic acid with oxygen, copper chloride in pyridine. Oxidative de-aromatization to quinones also known as the Teuber reaction. Oxidizing reagents are Fremy's salt and oxone. In reaction depicted below 3,4,5-trimethylphenol reacts with singlet oxygen generated from oxone/sodium carbonate in an acetonitrile/water mixture to a para-peroxyquinole. This hydroperoxide is reduced to the quinole with sodium thiosulfate.\nPhenols are oxidized to hydroquinones in the Elbs persulfate oxidation.\nReaction of naphtols and hydrazines and sodium bisulfite in the Bucherer carbazole synthesis.\nSynthesis.\nMany phenols of commercial interest are prepared by elaboration of phenol or cresols. They are typically produced by the alkylation of benzene/toluene with propylene to form cumene then O2 is added with H2SO4 to form phenol (Hock process). In addition to the reactions above, many other more specialized reactions produce phenols:\nClassification.\nThere are various classification schemes. A commonly used scheme is based on the number of carbons and was devised by Jeffrey Harborne and Simmonds in 1964 and published in 1980:\nDrugs and bioactive natural products.\nMore than 371 drugs approved by the FDA between the years of 1951 and 2020 contain either a phenol or a phenolic ether (a phenol with an alkyl), with nearly every class of small molecule drugs being represented, and natural products making up a large portion of this list.\nAnalysis.\nIn chemical analysis, phenols can be detected using 2,6\u2011dibromoquinonechlorimide. It reacts with phenols to form indophenols, resulting in a color change."}

As a young man, he was a partisan and prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of the dictator Sulla, after whose death he achieved much military and political success himself. \nA member of the senatorial nobility, Pompey entered into a military career while still young. He rose to prominence serving Sulla as a commander in the civil war of 83\u201381 BC. Pompey's success as a general while young enabled him to advance directly to his first consulship without following the traditional \"cursus honorum\" (the required steps to advance in a political career). He was elected as consul on three occasions (70, 55, 52 BC). He celebrated three triumphs, served as a commander in the Sertorian War, the Third Servile War, the Third Mithridatic War, and in various other military campaigns. Pompey's early success led dictator Sulla to give him the cognomen \"Magnus\" \u2013 \"the Great\" \u2013 after his boyhood hero Alexander the Great. His adversaries gave him the nickname \"adulescentulus carnifex\" (\"teenage butcher\") for his ruthlessness.\nIn 60\u00a0BC, Pompey joined Crassus and Caesar in the informal political alliance known as the First Triumvirate, cemented by Pompey's marriage with Caesar's daughter, Julia. After the deaths of Julia and Crassus (in 54 and 53 BC), Pompey switched to the political faction known as the \"optimates\"\u2014a conservative faction of the Roman Senate. Pompey and Caesar then began contending for leadership of the Roman state in its entirety, eventually leading to Caesar's civil war. Pompey was defeated at the Battle of Pharsalus in 48\u00a0BC, and he sought refuge in Ptolemaic Egypt, where he was assassinated by the courtiers of Ptolemy XIII.\nEarly life and career.\nGnaeus Pompeius Magnus was born in Picenum on 29 September 106 BC, eldest son of a provincial noble called Gnaeus Pompeius Strabo. Although the dominant family in Picenum, Strabo was the first of his branch to achieve senatorial status in Rome; he completed the traditional \"cursus honorum\", becoming consul in 89 BC, and acquired a reputation for greed, political duplicity, and military ruthlessness. Pompey began his career serving with his father in the Social War (91\u201387 BC).\nStrabo died in 87 BC during the short-lived civil war known as the , although sources differ on whether he succumbed to disease, or was murdered by his own soldiers. Prior to his death, Strabo was accused of embezzlement; as his legal heir, Pompey was held responsible for the alleged crime and put on trial. He was acquitted, supposedly after agreeing to marry the judge's daughter, Antistia.\nOne of the main issues at stake in 87 BC was the appointment of the consul Sulla as commander of the Roman army in the ongoing First Mithridatic War, an opportunity to amass enormous wealth. During his absence in the East, his political rivals led by Lucius Cornelius Cinna, Gnaeus Papirius Carbo and Gaius Marius the Younger regained control of the Roman Senate. Sulla's return in 83 BC sparked a civil war within the Roman world.\nPompey during Sulla's civil war.\nIn the year prior to Sulla's return Pompey had raised and equipped a full legion from amongst his father's old clients and veterans in Picenum. In the spring of 83 Sulla landed in Brundisium. As he marched north-west towards Campania, Pompey led his own legion south to join him. The government in Rome sent out three separate armies in an attempt to prevent the union between Pompey's and Sulla's army. Pompey attacked one of these armies and routed it. The three enemy commanders, unable to agree on a course of action, withdrew. Soon after Pompey arrived at Sulla's camp. He was greeted by Sulla with the title (an appellation meaning \"victorious general\").\nAt some point in 83 BC, it is not clear when but definitely before the onset of winter, Sulla sent Pompey back to Picenum to raise more troops. When fighting broke out once more in 82 Sulla advanced towards Rome, while Metellus (one of his lieutenants), supported by Pompey, campaigned against the consul Gaius Papirius Carbo in Cisalpine Gaul. During this campaign Pompey acted as Metellus's cavalry commander.\nMetellus and Pompey defeated Carbo's lieutenant, the praetor Gaius Carrinas, in a six-hour battle at the river Aesis, only to be blockaded by Carbo himself. When word of Sulla's victory at the Battle of Sacriportus reached them, Carbo retreated to his base at Ariminium, severely harassed by Pompey's cavalry. Some time later Metellus defeated Gaius Marcius Censorinus, another of Carbo's lieutenants, Pompey's cavalry caught Censorinus's fleeing troops outside their base at Sena Gallica, defeating them and plundering the town. While Metellus remained in the north-west, Pompey seems to have transferred to Sulla's command in the south.\nPompey advanced south-west along the Via Flaminia towards Spoletium, where he joined Marcus Licinius Crassus, together they defeated Carrinas once again. Pompey laid siege to Carrinas in Spoletium but the latter managed to escape. Pompey resumed his march to join Sulla's command. Not long afterwards Pompey successfully ambushed another large force under Censorinus, which was trying to get through to Praeneste where Carbo's consular colleague, Marius the Younger (who was the figurehead of the struggle against Sulla), was blockaded. It was the failure of these attempts to get through the Sullan blockade in Umbria and Etruria, added to Metellus's success in winning control of the north, which broke the back of the government's resistance. \nAt the end of the campaigning season of 82, the government forces made one final effort to march to the relief of Praeneste. They mustered 10,000 legionaries and marched to join forces with the Samnites and the Lucanians, fierce enemies of Sulla, who had campaigned against them in the Social War. Pursued by Pompey they united their forces and made for Praeneste. Unable to break through Sulla's blockade, they marched for undefended Rome, only to be caught just in time and defeated by Sulla at the Battle of the Colline Gate. Pompey, who was pursuing the government forces, arrived just after the battle.\nBy the end of 82 BC, Sulla had expelled his opponents from Italy, and had himself made dictator by passage of an enabling law, the . Either through admiration of his abilities, or concern at his ambition, Sulla sought to consolidate his alliance with Pompey by persuading him to divorce Antistia, and marry his stepdaughter Aemilia. Plutarch claims she was already pregnant by her former husband, and died in childbirth soon after.\nSicily, Africa and Lepidus' rebellion.\nThe surviving Marians escaped to Sicily, where their ally Marcus Perperna was propraetor. They were supported by a fleet under Carbo, while Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus occupied the Roman province of Africa. Perperna abandoned Sicily after Pompey landed on the island with a large force, while Carbo was captured and later executed. Pompey claimed this was justified by Carbo's alleged crimes against Roman citizens, but his opponents nicknamed him \"adulescentulus carnifex\", or \"young butcher\", as a result. \nPompey now sailed for Africa, leaving Sicily in the hands of his brother-in-law, Gaius Memmius. After defeating and killing Ahenobarbus at the Battle of Utica, Pompey subdued Numidia and executed its king Hiarbas, a Marian ally. He restored the deposed Hiempsal to the Numidian throne. Around this time, his troops began referring to him as \"Magnus\", or \"the Great\", after Alexander the Great, a figure much admired by the Romans. Shortly thereafter, Pompey formally made this part of his name.\nOn returning to Rome, he asked for a triumph to celebrate his victories, an unprecedented demand for someone so young. Pompey refused to disband his army until Sulla agreed, although the latter tried to offset the impact by awarding simultaneous triumphs to Lucius Licinius Murena and Gaius Valerius Flaccus. Sometime during this period, Pompey married Mucia Tertia, a member of the powerful Metellus family. They had three children before their divorce in 61 BC; Pompey the younger, usually known as Gnaeus, a daughter, Pompeia Magna, and a younger son, Sextus.\nPompey supported Marcus Aemilius Lepidus as consul for 78 BC; Plutarch claims he did so against Sulla's advice, but some modern historians reject the idea. When Sulla died in 78 BC, Lepidus sought to block his state funeral and roll back some of Sulla's laws, then became proconsul of Cisalpine and Transalpine Gaul in January 77 BC. When the Senate ordered him back to Rome, Lepidus refused to comply unless granted another term as consul, a proposal that was rapidly rejected. Assembling an army, he began marching on Rome; the Senate responded with a series of measures, one of which was to appoint Pompey to a military command.\nWhile Lepidus continued south, Pompey raised troops from among his veterans in Picenum, and moved north to besiege Mutina, capital of Cisalpine Gaul. The town was held by Lepidus' ally Marcus Junius Brutus, who surrendered after a lengthy siege, and was assassinated next day, allegedly on Pompey's orders. Catulus then defeated Lepidus outside Rome, while Pompey marched against his rear, catching him near Cosa. Lepidus and the remnants of his army retreated to Sardinia, where he died.\nSertorian War.\nThe Sertorian War began in 80\u00a0BC when Quintus Sertorius, a prominent proscribed Marian general, initiated a rebellion in Hispania, where he was joined by other Roman exiles like Perperna. Supported by local Iberian tribes, he took control of Hispania Ulterior and repeatedly defeated Quintus Caecilius Metellus Pius through skillful use of guerrilla warfare. Sertorius defeated other Roman generals sent to oust him and soon conquered Hispania Citerior as well. Backed by his allies in the Senate, Pompey was appointed military commander in Spain with proconsular authority in order to defeat Sertorius. This act was technically illegal as he had yet to hold public office, illustrating Pompey's preference for military glory, and disregard for traditional political constraints.\nPompey recruited 30,000 infantry and 1,000 cavalry, evidence of the threat posed by Sertorius. En route to Hispania, he subdued a rebellion in Gallia Narbonensis, after which his army entered winter quarters near Narbo Martius. In early 76\u00a0BC, he crossed the Col de Portet and entered the Iberian peninsula, where he would remain for the next five years. His arrival boosted the morale of Metellus' troops, while some rebels changed sides, but soon after he was defeated by Sertorius at the Battle of Lauron, losing one third of his army while inflicting next to no losses on Sertorius' army. This was a serious blow to Pompey's prestige, who spent the rest of the year re-organising his army. Metellus' failure to dislodge Sertorius and Pompey's defeat meant the senatorial generals made no progress in the year.\nIn 75\u00a0BC, Sertorius led the campaign against Metellus, while Pompey defeated his subordinates Perperna and Gaius Herennius outside Valencia. When Sertorius took over operations against Pompey, Metellus defeated his deputy Lucius Hirtuleius at the Battle of Italica. Pompey faced Sertorius in the indecisive Battle of Sucro, in which Sertorius defeated Pompey's right flank and nearly captured Pompey himself, but his legate Lucius Afranius defeated the Sertorian right. Sertorius withdrew inland, then turned to fight at Saguntum, where Pompey lost 6,000 men, including his brother-in-law Memmius, reputedly his most effective subordinate. Sertorius himself suffered 3,000 casualties, one of whom was Hirtuleius.\nAlthough Metellus defeated Perperna in a separate battle, Sertorius was able to withdraw to Clunia late in the year, where he repaired the walls to lure his opponents into a siege, while forming garrisons from other towns into a new field army. Once this was ready, he escaped from Clunia and used it to disrupt Roman logistics on land and by sea. Lack of supplies forced Metellus to quarter his troops in Gaul, while Pompey wintered among the Vaccaei. Dire straits caused by this stretch of the campaign and Sertorius' guerrilla warfare led Pompey to write a letter to the Senate asking for funds and men, and scolding their lack of support for him and Metellus.\nPompey's letter had the effect of galvanizing the Senate into sending him more men and funds. Reinforced by two more legions, in 74\u00a0BC he and Metellus began a war of attrition against their enemy. As his chief opponent had lost most of his Roman legionaries and could no longer match him in the field, Pompey, along with Metellus, gained the upper hand, conquering more and more Sertorian cities, slowly grinding down Sertorius' revolt. By now, Sertorius was being undermined by internal divisions. Discontent in Sertorius' coalition of Iberian and Roman forces came to a head in 72 or 73\u00a0BC when Perperna, leading a conspiracy with other prominent Sertorians, had Sertorius assassinated and assumed control of the rebel army.\nPompey engaged Perperna in battle and defeated him swiftly at the Battle near Osca. Perperna was captured and attempted to persuade Pompey to spare him by giving over Sertorius' correspondence, allegedly containing proof of communications between the rebel leader and leading men in Rome. Pompey burned the letters unread and executed Perperna, and then spent some time restructuring the local Roman administration, showing a lack of animosity towards his former opponents, which extended his patronage throughout Hispania and into southern Gaul. Pompey and his army remained in Hispania for a few years conquering the Sertorian remnants, and then marched back to Rome.\nFirst consulship.\nDuring Pompey's absence, Marcus Licinius Crassus was charged with suppressing the slave rebellion led by Spartacus known as the Third Servile War. Pompey returned to Italy just before Crassus defeated the main rebel army in 71 BC, arriving in time to massacre 6,000 fugitives from the battle. His claim to have ended the war by doing so was a long-standing source of resentment for Crassus.\nPompey was granted a second triumph for his victory in Hispania and also stood for the consulship. Since he was both too young and technically ineligible according to the minimum ages for offices set in place by Sulla in the \"Lex Cornelia Annalis\", this required a special senatorial decree. Plutarch suggests Pompey supported Crassus as his co-consul in order to put him under an obligation. The two men were elected consuls for 70\u00a0BC, but allegedly differed on almost every measure, rendering their term \"politically barren and without achievement.\"\nHowever, their consulship did see the plebeian tribune recover powers removed by Sulla. One of the most significant was the ability to veto Senatorial bills, an act often seen as a turning point in the politics of the late Republic. Although popular with the people, the measure must have been opposed by the \"optimates\", and thus passing it required support from both consuls, although most extant sources barely mention Crassus.\nCampaign against the pirates.\nPirates operated throughout the Mediterranean, while their fleets often formed temporary alliances with enemies of Rome, including Sertorius and Mithridates. Their power and range had increased over the past fifty years, partly because of the decline of traditional naval powers like Rhodes, while previous attempts to subdue them had been unsuccessful. However, Romans routinely referred to their opponents as \"pirates\" or \"brigands\", and some historians argue it is more accurate to see them as a conventional enemy, rather than disorganised outlaws.\nPrincipally based in Cilicia, in 68 BC they raided as far as Ostia, Rome's port, and kidnapped two senators, to general outrage. Prompted by Pompey, Aulus Gabinius, tribune of the plebs in 67 BC, proposed the \"Lex Gabinia de piratis persequendis\", giving him a mandate for their suppression. It granted him proconsular authority for three years in any province within 50 miles of the Mediterranean, along with the power to appoint legates and significant financial resources. Concerned by one man holding such wide-ranging powers, the Senate opposed the law but it was passed by the people. Most of the difficulties Pompey faced came from officials who resented his authority. In Gaul, Piso hampered his recruitment efforts, while in Crete, Quintus Metellus refused to comply with his instructions.\nPompey spread his forces throughout the Mediterranean to prevent the pirates escaping a Roman fleet by moving elsewhere. Fifteen legates were given specific areas to patrol, while he secured the grain route to Rome. These measures won him control of the western Mediterranean in just 40 days, after which his fleets moved to the east, forcing the pirates back to their bases in Cilicia. Pompey led the decisive assault on their stronghold in Coracaesium, winning the Battle of Korakesion and concluding the war in only three months.\nMost of his opponents surrendered without fighting, thanks to Pompey's reputation for clemency. They were granted lands in cities devastated during the Mithridatic War, notably Soli, renamed Pompeiopolis, and Dyme in Greece, with others sent to towns in Libya and Calabria. These communities retained a strong attachment to both Rome and Pompey.\nThird Mithridatic War and re-organisation of the east.\nThird Mithridatic War.\nIn 73 BC, Lucius Licinius Lucullus, formerly one of Sulla's chief lieutenants, was made proconsul of Cilicia, and commander in the Third Mithridatic War. The war began in 74 BC, when the last ruler of Bithynia died and left his kingdom to Rome, sparking an invasion by Mithridates VI of Pontus, and Tigranes the Great of Armenia. Lucullus was a skilled general who won numerous victories, but claims he was protracting the war for \"power and wealth\" led to a Senate investigation, while by 69 BC his troops were weary and mutinous.\nIn 68\u00a0BC, Quintus Marcius Rex replaced Lucullus in Cicilia, while Manius Acilius Glabrio received Bithynia. He also assumed leadership of the war against Mithridates, but failed to respond decisively when the latter re-occupied much of Pontus in 67 BC, then attacked Cappadocia, a Roman ally. Seeing an opportunity, in 66 BC Pompey used the tribunate to pass the \"lex Manilia\", giving him extensive powers throughout Asia Minor in order to defeat Mithridates, in addition to those granted by the \"lex Gabinia\". The \"optimates\" were privately horrified that one man should hold so much influence, but fearful of his popularity allowed the measure to pass.\nIncensed at being replaced, Lucullus called Pompey a \"vulture\" who profited from the work of others, a reference both to his new command and claim to have finished the war against Spartacus. Pompey agreed an alliance with Phraates III, king of Parthia, whom he persuaded to invade Armenia. When Mithridates offered a truce, Lucullus argued the war was over, but Pompey demanded concessions which could not be accepted. Outnumbered, Mithridates withdrew into Armenia, followed by Pompey, who defeated him at Lycus near the end of 66 BC.\nAccording to contemporary sources, Mithridates and a small contingent escaped the battle, outstripped their pursuers, and reached Colchis on the Black Sea. While there, he took control of the Cimmerian Bosporus from its Roman-backed ruler, his son Machares, who later committed suicide. Meanwhile, Pompey invaded Armenia supported by Tigranes the Younger, whose father quickly came to terms; in return for the restoration of Armenian territories taken by Lucullus, he paid a substantial cash indemnity and allowed Roman troops to be based on his territory.\nIn 65 BC, Pompey set out to take Colchis, but to do so had first to subdue various local tribes and allies of Mithridrates. After winning a series of battles, he reached Phasis and linked up with Servilius, admiral of his Euxine fleet, before a fresh revolt in Caucasian Albania forced him to retrace his steps. Victory at the Abas enabled him to impose terms on the Albanians and agree truces with other tribes on the northern side of the Caucasus. Pompey then wintered in Armenia, settling minor border contests and raids between his allies Phraates and Tigranes.\nRelying on his naval blockade to wear down Mithridates, Pompey spent 64 BC annexing the independent and wealthy cities of Syria, which were incorporated into a new Roman province. In the process, he acquired large amounts of money and prestige, as well as criticism from his opponents in Rome, who argued doing so exceeded his authority. Meanwhile, an ageing Mithridates had been cornered in Panticapaeum by another of his sons, Pharnaces II of Pontus. An attempt to commit suicide by taking poison allegedly failed due to his habit of taking \"precautionary antidotes\", and he was killed by the rebels. Pharnaces sent his embalmed body to Pompey, in return for which he was granted the Bosporan Kingdom and made an ally of Rome.\nRe-organisation of the East.\nThe final collapse of the Seleucid Empire allowed Pompey to annex Syria in 64 BC, but its dissolution destabilised the region, while many of its cities had used the power vacuum to achieve independence. In early 63 BC, Pompey left Antioch and marched south, occupying coastal cities like Apamea, before crossing the Anti-Lebanon Mountains and capturing Pella (in today's Jordan), and Damascus.\nPompey's incursion further south, into Judea, was occasioned on account of its inhabitants, under the leadership of Hyrcanus II and Aristobulus II, having ravaged Phoenicia and Pompey wanting to bring a stop to it. The initial onslaught was disrupted by the Hasmonean Civil War, in which Pompey backed Hyrcanus\u00a0II over his brother Aristobulus\u00a0II. When he compelled the latter to surrender Jerusalem, its defenders took refuge in the Temple, which the Romans first stormed, then looted. Judea became a client kingdom ruled by Hyrcanus, while its northern section was incorporated into the Decapolis, a league of semi-autonomous cities (see map). Both Judea and the League were made subordinate to the new province of Syria.\nOther organisational changes included creating the province of Bithynia and Pontus, with the rest of Mithridates' territories distributed among Roman allies. Elsewhere, Ariobarzanes I of Cappadocia was restored to his throne, while Lesser Armenia was taken from Tigranes and incorporated into Galatia, with Pompey's client Deiotarus becoming ruler of the new kingdom. Finally, Cilicia received the coastal region of Pamphylia, previously a centre of piracy, along with other inland areas and reorganised into six parts. These actions significantly increased Roman state income and presented Pompey with multiple opportunities to increase his personal wealth and patronage base.\nReturn to Rome and the First Triumvirate.\nBefore his return to Italy in 62 BC, Pompey paid his troops bonuses totalling around 16,000 talents, but despite fears he intended to follow Sulla's example, they were dismissed upon arrival at Brundisium. His journey to Rome drew huge crowds wherever he stopped, showing that although opinion in the Senate was divided, Pompey remained as popular as ever with the masses. He was awarded a third triumph for his achievements in Asia Minor, celebrated on his 45th birthday in 61\u00a0BC.\nPompey claimed the new provinces established in the East had increased annual state income from 200 million to 340 million sesterces, plus an additional payment of 480 million sesterces to the treasury. He refused to provide details of his personal fortune, but given the amounts declared publicly, this must have been enormous. Some of it was used to build one of the most famous structures of Ancient Rome, the Theatre of Pompey.\nHowever, the Senate then refused to ratify the treaties agreed by Pompey as part of his settlement of the East. Opposition was led by the \"optimates\" Cato the Younger and Metellus Celer, whose sister Mucia had recently been divorced by Pompey, for reasons still disputed. They also defeated a bill to distribute farmland to his veterans, and landless members of the urban poor. A similar measure had been rejected in 63 BC, which arguably made the Senate over confident in their ability to control popular unrest.\nAlthough Pompey could not overcome \"optimate\" opposition on his own, the situation changed when Marius' nephew Julius Caesar sought his endorsement for the consulship in 59 BC. A skilled, unscrupulous, and ambitious politician, Caesar used this alliance to harness Pompey's influence with the urban electorate. With additional support from Crassus, Caesar became one of the two consuls for 59\u00a0BC, the other being the \"optimate\" Marcus Calpurnius Bibulus. This meant Caesar could help pass legislation sponsored by Pompey and Crassus, while it was in his interest to keep them aligned, an important factor given the rivalry between his two patrons.\nDespite appearing to be the most junior, Caesar thus became central to the First Triumvirate, an informal political alliance designed to counter-balance the \"optimates\". Pompey's influence was based on his reputation as a military commander, and popularity with the Roman people. Crassus' wealth allowed him to construct extensive patronage networks, but he lacked the military clout essential for political success in the late Republican era.\nOnce elected, Caesar secured the passage of a new agrarian bill, helped by Pompey's veterans, who filled the streets of Rome and allegedly intimidated the Senate. When Bibulus opposed the measure, he was attacked in the forum, and spent the rest of his consulship under virtual house arrest. Caesar then ensured ratification of Pompey's settlements in the east, while the \"Lex Vatinia\" made him governor of Gallia Cisalpina and Illyricum. He was also assigned Gallia Transalpina after its governor died in office, before leaving Rome to launch the Gallic Wars in 58 BC. His alliance with Pompey was strengthened when the latter married Caesar's daughter Julia.\nSenatorial opposition to the triumvirate was led by Cicero, a long-standing Pompeian ally. Despite this, the latter supported the populist politician Publius Clodius Pulcher in an attack on Cicero for executing Roman citizens without trial during the Catilinarian conspiracy. Although Clodius succeeded in having Cicero exiled, he was recalled to Rome by Pompey eighteen months later in 57 BC. As a result, when shortages of grain caused popular unrest later that year, a grateful Cicero backed Pompey's appointment as \"praefectus annonae\", a temporary position set up for such occasions.\nPompey and Crassus were competing for command of a new expedition to Asia Minor, and in 56 BC they met with Caesar to resolve these issues. Although Crassus was a long-standing rival, there are also indications Pompey felt his status as the foremost soldier of the Republic was threatened by Caesar's success in Gaul. With this in mind, Pompey set aside his differences with Crassus to promote their joint candidature as consuls for 55\u00a0BC. With Caesar's support, they were duly elected after prolonged periods of the violence which had become a feature of Roman political campaigns. \nOnce in office, they ensured passage of a law giving Crassus the province of Syria and command of a punitive expedition against Parthia, providing him opportunities for both military glory and loot. Pompey was assigned the restive provinces of Hispania, along with Africa, while Caesar's governorships in Gaul were extended. All three men were given these positions for a period of five years, as well as the right to levy troops and \"make peace and war with whomsoever they pleased.\"\nFrom confrontation to civil war.\nIn 54 BC, Caesar continued his conquest of Gaul, Crassus opened his campaign against the Parthians, and Pompey remained in Rome, where his wife Julia died in child birth in September. Contemporary sources suggest that combined with the death of Crassus and his son Publius at Carrhae in May 53 BC, this removed any obstacle to direct confrontation between Caesar and Pompey.\nConsular elections in 52 BC had to be suspended due to widespread violence. Seeking to end his alliance with Caesar, the \"optimate\" Bibulus proposed Pompey be elected sole consul, an unprecedented act backed by both Cato and the tribunate. Having restored order, Pompey married Cornelia, widow of Publius Crassus and daughter of Metellus Scipio Nasica, whom he appointed as his colleague for the last five months of the year. \nAs consul, Pompey helped enact legislation which some historians view as crucial to understanding the drift to war in 49 BC. Accused of using violence during his consulship in 59 BC, Caesar had previously been shielded by his proconsular immunity. With private support from Pompey, new laws made such prosecutions retrospective, which meant Caesar would probably be put on trial the moment he left Gaul and lost his \"Imperium\". To avoid this, he had secured approval to stand for the consulship in 48 BC while still in Gaul, but another law backed by Pompey required electoral candidates to be physically present in Rome. \nAlthough the two continued to co-operate in public, Pompey clearly viewed his colleague as a threat, as did much of the Senate. Both consuls for 50 BC, Paullus and Gaius Claudius, were opponents of Caesar, as was Curio, a plebeian tribune. They initiated legislation to remove Caesar from his command in Gaul, who allegedly bypassed this by bribing Paullus and Curio. For whatever reason, Curio came up with an alternative proposal; Caesar and Pompey should disarm at the same time, or be declared enemies of the state.\nThis was a clever move, since it was popular with those who wanted to avoid war, but unacceptable to the \"optimates\" who saw Caesar as a danger that had to be eliminated. Rejection made open conflict more likely, and the Senate agreed to fund a consular army, organised by Pompey. When he fell ill while recruiting in Naples, the celebrations that followed his recovery allegedly convinced Pompey his popularity was sufficient to see off any opponent. In December, Caesar crossed the Alps with a single veteran legion and arrived at Ravenna, close to the border with the Roman Republic.\nA significant number of senators opposed any concessions to Caesar, but many also mistrusted Pompey, who has been criticised for \"weak and ineffectual leadership\" in this period. On 1 January 49 BC, Caesar sent an ultimatum demanding acceptance of his compromise, failing which he would march on Rome \"to avenge his country's wrongs\". Confident their forces significantly outnumbered those available to Caesar, on 7 January the Senate declared him a public enemy; four days later, he crossed the Rubicon into Italy.\nThe Road to Pharsalus.\nWhen the war began, Caesar was a rebel with no navy and three understrength legions, while Pompey was backed by all the resources of the Roman state and his clients in the East. However, his position was weaker than it seemed, since he was simply an advisor to the Senate, many of whose members either preferred a negotiated solution, or regarded him with as much suspicion as Caesar. His military strategy had to be approved by the consuls, and he could only issue recommendations, which were not always followed. For example, Cicero rejected a request to help him with recruitment, and Cato refused to take command of Sicily, vital for control of Rome's grain supply.\nPlans to defend Italy were undone by the speed with which Caesar moved, advancing directly on Rome with minimal resistance. Although outnumbered, his troops were experienced veterans, while many of Pompey's were new recruits, a weakness made worse by lack of co-ordination. Cato's brother-in-law, the \"optimate\" leader Lucius Domitius, was cut off and captured in a hopeless defence of Corfinium, and his 13,000 men incorporated into Caesar's army. Led by Asinius Pollio, they were later used to occupy Sicily.\nPompey had abandoned Rome, ordering all senators and public officials to accompany him as he withdrew south to Brundisium. From there, he transported his troops across the Adriatic to Dyrrhachium in Thessaly, an operation performed with almost complete success. Lacking ships to pursue him, Caesar first secured his rear by subduing Pompeian forces in Hispania, before returning to Rome in December 49 BC. This gave Pompey time to build an army nearly twice the size of his opponents', while his navy destroyed two fleets being built for Caesar, ensuring the Pompeians retained control of the sea lanes.\nDespite this, in January 48 BC Caesar managed to cross the Adriatic with seven legions and land in southern Albania. After capturing Oricum and Apollonia, he advanced on Pompey's main supply base at Dyrrhachium. The latter arrived in time to block the attempt, and establish a fortified camp on the other side of the River Apus, where the two armies remained until spring. Neither commander was anxious to begin hostilities, since Caesar was too weak militarily, while as with Mithridates, Pompey preferred to starve his opponent into submission. \nIn late March the stalemate was broken when Mark Antony finally managed to cross the Adriatic with four more legions and land at Nymphaeum, some 57 kilometres north of Dyrrachium. Pompey tried to prevent the two Caesarian armies from linking up, by marching north-east and laying an ambush for Antony. The ambush, however, was revealed to Antony by some local Caesarian sympathisers, and he stayed in camp until Caesar approached. Unwilling to be caught between the two Caesarian forces, Pompey withdrew.\nCaesar, his army now united with Antony's force, redeployed his forces by sending one-and-a-half legion to win support and gather supplies in Aetolia and Thessaly, and a further two legions under Domitius Calvinus to intercept Metellus Scipio in Macedonia. Meanwhile, Gnaeus, Pompey's oldest son, managed to destroy Caesar's fleet at Oricum and Lissus, making sure no more reinforcements and supplies would reach Caesar from Italy. Caesar tried to lure Pompey into a pitched battle at Asparagium, but the latter refused. The next day Caesar outmaneuvred Pompey and marched for Dyrrachium again. When Pompey arrived at the city Caesar had already set up camp.\nCaesar lacked the siege equipment needed to take Dyrrhachium, and could not risk leaving Pompey to threaten his rear. He solved this by besieging Pompey in his camp. Although the latter had enough food, water was scarce because Caesar had dammed the local rivers, and the Pompeian cavalry lacked forage for their horses. Ending the stalemate became a matter of urgency, and in late July Pompey finally managed to break through part of Caesar's defensive lines. Since this made the blockade pointless, Caesar cut his losses and withdrew to Apollonia.\nAt this point Metellus Scipio arrived in Thessaly. Caesar moved south to confront this threat and link up with Domitius Calvinus, allowing his men to sack Gomphi en route. Pursued by Pompey, he then withdrew to the area near Pharsalus, but failed to tempt Pompey into giving battle. Although it was later claimed Pompey only did so after being pressured by his subordinates, the delay may simply have been a reflection of his natural caution.\nRegardless, in the ensuing Battle of Pharsalus Pompey's army of around 38,000 outnumbered the 22,000 men commanded by Caesar, with 7,000 cavalry to 1,000. On 9 August he deployed his men in battle formation, planning to use his superior cavalry to outflank his opponent on his left. Caesar had anticipated this, and repulsed the cavalry which fled in confusion, exposing the infantry behind them. Under pressure from the left and in front, the Pompeian army collapsed.\nDeath.\nPompey escaped from the battlefield and made his way to Mytilene, where he was reunited with his wife Cornelia. Most of his Eastern allies were present at Pharsalus and had either been killed or captured. The main absentee was 14-year-old Ptolemy XIII, ruler of the wealthy and strategically important kingdom of Egypt, making it an obvious destination. Cato announced his intention to continue the war from Africa, although most of his senatorial colleagues, including Cicero and Marcus Junius Brutus, made their peace with Caesar and returned to Rome.\nPompey sailed from Cyprus with a small fleet, and on 28 September 48 BC arrived at Pelusium in Egypt, where Ptolemy was engaged in a bitter civil war with his co-ruler and elder sister, Cleopatra VII. When he went ashore to greet an official delegation, Pompey was killed by Lucius Septimius, a Roman officer and former colleague serving in the Egyptian army. His body was cremated by two servants, while the head was kept as evidence. \nOne suggestion is that Ptolemy and his advisors feared Pompey planned to seize control of Egypt, especially since many Egyptian army officers were Roman mercenaries like Septimius who had previously served with him. At the same time, it seemed an easy way to win Caesar's support against Cleopatra, although ultimately this proved not to be the case. Pompey's head was later returned to Cornelia for burial at his villa in the Alban Hills, while his ignominious death prompted Cicero to write \"his life outlasted his power\".\nMarriages and issue.\nPompey had five wives:\nGeneralship.\nPompey's military glory was second to none for two decades, yet his decisions were occasionally criticized by some of his contemporaries. Sertorius or Lucullus, for instance, were especially critical. Pompey's tactics were usually efficient, albeit not particularly innovative or imaginative, and they could prove insufficient against greater tacticians. However, Pharsalus was his only decisive defeat. At times, he was reluctant to risk an open battle. While not extremely charismatic, Pompey could display tremendous bravery and fighting skills on the battlefield, which inspired his men. While being a superb commander, Pompey also earned a reputation for stealing other generals' victories.\nOn the other hand, Pompey is usually considered an outstanding strategist and organizer, who could win campaigns without displaying genius on the battlefield, but simply by constantly outmaneuvering his opponents and gradually pushing them into a desperate situation. Pompey was a great planner, and had tremendous organizational skill, which allowed him to devise grand strategies and operate effectively with large armies. During his campaigns in the east, he relentlessly pursued his enemies, choosing the ground for his battles.\nAbove all, he was often able to adapt to his enemies and showed determination. On many occasions, he acted very swiftly and decisively, as he did during his campaigns in Sicily and Africa, or against the Cilician pirates. During the Sertorian war, on the other hand, Pompey was beaten several times by Sertorius. Despite an abysmal first year of the war for Pompey in 76\u00a0BC, he continued to campaign vigorously and as a result defeated many of Sertorius' subordinates. After Sertorius' army was greatly diminished, Pompey then decided to conduct a war of attrition, in which he would avoid open battles against his chief opponent but instead tried to gradually regain the strategic advantage by capturing his fortresses and cities and defeating his junior officers. This strategy was unspectacular, but it led to constant territorial gains and did much to demoralize the Sertorian forces. By 73 or 72\u00a0BC, when he was assassinated, Sertorius was already in a desperate situation and his troops were deserting. Against Perperna, a tactician far inferior to his former commander-in-chief, Pompey decided to revert to a more aggressive strategy and he scored a decisive victory that effectively ended the war.\nAgainst Caesar too, his strategy was sound. During the campaign in Greece, he managed to regain the initiative, join his forces to those of Metellus Scipio (something that Caesar wanted to avoid) and trap his enemy. His strategic position was therefore much better than that of Caesar and he could have starved Caesar's army to death. However, he was finally compelled to fight an open battle by his allies, and his conventional tactics proved no match to those of Caesar (who also commanded the more experienced troops).\nLiterary heritage.\nPompey was so striking a figure, and his fall so dramatic, that his story became the subject of frequent literary treatment. In the century after his death, the civil war between himself and Caesar was retold in Lucan's epic \"De Bello Civili\", now known as the \"Pharsalia\" after the culminating battle. In the poem's final sections, however, Pompey's vengeful ghost returns to possess those responsible for his murder in Egypt and bring about their death.\nIn Renaissance Britain, too, several plays returned to the subject of \"Caesar and Pompey\", including George Chapman's \"The Wars of Pompey and Caesar\" (c. 1604). Another contemporary treatment by Thomas Kyd, \"Cornelia, or Pompey the Great, his faire Cornelia's tragedy\" (1594), was a translation from the French of Robert Garnier. Later in France, Pompey's story was told without the character appearing onstage in Pierre Corneille's \"La Mort de Pomp\u00e9e\" (1643) and this too had English adaptations: as \"Pompey\" (1663) by Catherine Philips, as \"Pompey the Great\" by Edmund Waller and others in 1664, and later as \"The Death of Pompey\" (1724) by Colley Cibber.\nLater in the 18th century, Pompey is made the recipient of a 'heroical epistle' in rhyming couplets from a supposed former lover in John Hervey's \"Flora to Pompey\". He also figures in narrative poems of the 19th century. John Edmund Reade's \"The Vale of Tempe\" records the fugitive's desperate appearance as glimpsed by a bystander in the Greek valley; his arrival in Egypt is related by Alaric Watts in \"The Death of Pompey the Great\", and the ruined column raised to mark the site of his killing outside Alexandria is described by Nicholas Michell in \"Ruins of Many Lands\". These were followed by John Masefield's prose drama \"The Tragedy of Pompey the Great\" of 1910, covering the period from his decision to fight Caesar to his assassination in Egypt. The play was later filmed for television in 1950 for the \"BBC Sunday Night Theatre\".\nPompey's career is recapitulated a century later in series of historical novels. In Colleen McCullough's \"Masters of Rome\", Pompey is mainly featured in Books III-V, covering his rise to prominence through to his betrayal and murder in Egypt. Pompey is also a recurring character in Steven Saylor's \"Roma Sub Rosa\" crime fiction novels, where he brushes shoulders with Gordianus, the main protagonist of the series. Another fiction series in which Pompey plays a part in the historical background is Robert Harris's trilogy of the life of Cicero.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "23871", "revid": "32068386", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23871", "title": "Pasta", "text": "Cooked dough food in Italian cuisine\nPasta (, ; ) is a type of food typically made from an unleavened dough of wheat flour mixed with water or eggs, and formed into sheets or other shapes, then cooked by boiling or baking. Pasta was originally only made with durum, although the definition has been expanded to include alternatives for a gluten-free diet, such as rice flour, or legumes such as beans or lentils. Pasta is believed to have developed independently in Italy and is a staple food of Italian cuisine, with evidence of Etruscans making pasta as early as 400 BCE in Italy.\nPastas are divided into two broad categories: dried () and fresh (Italian: ). Most dried pasta is produced commercially via an extrusion process, although it can be produced at home. Fresh pasta is traditionally produced by hand, sometimes with the aid of simple machines. Fresh pastas available in grocery stores are produced commercially by large-scale machines.\nBoth dried and fresh pastas come in a number of shapes and varieties, with 310 specific forms known by over 1,300 documented names. In Italy, the names of specific pasta shapes or types often vary by locale. For example, the pasta form is known by 28 different names depending upon the town and region. Common forms of pasta include long and short shapes, tubes, flat shapes or sheets, miniature shapes for soup, those meant to be filled or stuffed, and specialty or decorative shapes.\nAs a category in Italian cuisine, both fresh and dried pastas are classically used in one of three kinds of prepared dishes: as (or ), cooked pasta is plated and served with a complementary sauce or condiment; a second classification of pasta dishes is , in which the pasta is part of a soup-type dish. A third category is , in which the pasta is incorporated into a dish that is subsequently baked in the oven. Pasta dishes are generally simple, but individual dishes vary in preparation. Some pasta dishes are served as a small first course or for light lunches, such as pasta salads. Other dishes may be portioned larger and used for dinner. Pasta sauces similarly may vary in taste, color and texture.\nIn terms of nutrition, cooked plain pasta is 31% carbohydrates (mostly starch), 6% protein and is low in fat, with moderate amounts of manganese, but pasta generally has low micronutrient content. Pasta may be enriched or fortified, or made from whole grains.\nEtymology.\nEarliest appearances in the English language are in the 1830s; the word \"pasta\" comes from Italian , in turn from Latin , latinisation of the .\nHistory.\nEvidence of Etruscans making pasta dates back to 400 BCE. The first concrete information on pasta products in Italy dates to the 13th or 14th centuries. In the 1st-century writings of Horace, (sg.: ) were fine sheets of fried dough and were an everyday foodstuff. Writing in the 2nd century, Athenaeus of Naucratis provides a recipe for which he attributes to the 1st-century Chrysippus of Tyana: sheets of dough made of wheat flour and the juice of crushed lettuce, then flavored with spices and deep-fried in oil. An early 5th-century cookbook describes a dish called that consisted of layers of dough with meat stuffing, an ancestor of modern-day lasagna. However, the method of cooking these sheets of dough does not correspond to the modern definition of either a fresh or dry pasta product, which only had similar basic ingredients and perhaps the shape.\nHistorians have noted several lexical milestones relevant to pasta, none of which changes these basic characteristics. For example, the works of the 2nd-century Greek physician Galen mention , homogeneous compounds made of flour and water. The Jerusalem Talmud records that , a kind of boiled dough, was common in Palestine from the 3rd to 5th centuries. A dictionary compiled by the 9th-century Arab physician and lexicographer Isho bar Ali defines , the Arabic cognate, as string-like shapes made of semolina and dried before cooking. \nThe geographical text of Muhammad al-Idrisi, compiled for the Norman king of Sicily Roger II in 1154, mentions manufactured and exported from Norman Sicily:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;West of Termini there is a delightful settlement called Trabia [along the Sicilian coast east of Palermo]. Its ever-flowing streams propel a number of mills. Here there are huge buildings in the countryside where they make vast quantities of which is exported everywhere: to Calabria, to Muslim and Christian countries. Very many shiploads are sent.\nOne form of with a long history is , which in Latin refers to thin sheets of dough, and gave rise to the Italian .\nThere is a legend of Marco Polo importing pasta from China which originated with the \"Macaroni Journal\", published by an association of food industries with the goal of promoting pasta in the United States. Rustichello da Pisa writes in his \"Travels\" that Marco Polo described a food similar to . The way pasta reached Europe is unknown, however there are many theories, Jeffrey Steingarten asserts that Moors introduced pasta in the Emirate of Sicily in the 9th century, mentioning also that traces of pasta have been found in ancient Greece and that Jane Grigson believed the Marco Polo story to have originated in the 1920s or 1930s in an advertisement for a Canadian spaghetti company.\nFood historians estimate that the dish probably took hold in Italy as a result of extensive Mediterranean trading in the Middle Ages. From the 13th century, references to pasta dishes crop up with increasing frequency across the Italian peninsula. In the 14th-century writer Boccaccio's collection of earthy tales, \"The Decameron\", he recounts a mouthwatering fantasy concerning a mountain of Parmesan cheese down which pasta chefs roll macaroni and ravioli to gluttons waiting below.\nIn the 14th and 15th centuries, dried pasta became popular for its easy storage. This allowed people to store pasta on ships when exploring the New World. A century later, pasta was present around the globe during the voyages of discovery.\nAlthough tomatoes were introduced to Italy in the 16th century and incorporated in Italian cuisine in the 17th century, description of the first Italian tomato sauces dates from the late 18th century: the first written record of pasta with tomato sauce can be found in the 1790 cookbook by Roman chef Francesco Leonardi. Before tomato sauce was introduced, pasta was eaten dry with the fingers; the liquid sauce demanded the use of a fork.\nHistory of manufacturing.\nAt the beginning of the 17th century, Naples had rudimentary machines for producing pasta, later establishing the kneading machine and press, making pasta manufacturing cost-effective. In 1740, a license for the first pasta factory was issued in Venice. During the 1800s, watermills and stone grinders were used to separate semolina from the bran, initiating expansion of the pasta market. In 1859, Joseph Topits (1824\u22121876) founded Hungary's first pasta factory, in the city of Pest, which worked with steam machines; it was one of the first pasta factories in Central Europe. By 1867, Buitoni Company in Sansepolcro, Tuscany, was an established pasta manufacturer. During the early 1900s, artificial drying and extrusion processes enabled greater variety of pasta preparation and larger volumes for export, beginning a period called \"The Industry of Pasta\". In 1884, the Z\u00e1tka Brothers's plant in Bor\u0161ov nad Vltavou was founded, making it Bohemia's first pasta factory.\nIn modern times.\nThe art of pasta making and the devotion to the food as a whole has evolved since pasta was first conceptualized. In 2008, it was estimated that Italians ate over of pasta per person, per year, easily beating Americans, who ate about per person. Pasta is so beloved in Italy that individual consumption exceeds the average production of wheat of the country; thus, Italy frequently imports wheat for pasta making. In contemporary society, pasta is ubiquitous and there is a variety of types in local supermarkets, in many countries. With the worldwide demand for this staple food, pasta is now largely mass-produced in factories and only a tiny proportion is crafted by hand.\nIngredients and preparation.\nSince at least the time of Cato's , basic pasta dough has been made mostly of wheat flour or semolina, with durum wheat used predominantly in the south and soft wheat in the north of Italy. Regionally other grains have been used, including those from barley, buckwheat, rye, rice and maize, as well as chestnut and chickpea flours. Liquid, often in the form of eggs, is used to turn the flour into a dough.\nTo address the needs of people affected by gluten-related disorders (such as coeliac disease, non-celiac gluten sensitivity and wheat allergy sufferers), some recipes use rice or maize for making pasta. Grain flours may also be supplemented with cooked potatoes.\nOther additions to the basic flour-liquid mixture may include vegetable purees such as spinach or tomato, mushrooms, cheeses, herbs, spices and other seasonings. While pastas are, most typically, made from unleavened doughs, at least nine different pasta forms are known to use yeast-raised doughs.\nAdditives in dried, commercially sold pasta include vitamins and minerals that are lost from the durum wheat endosperm during milling. They are added back to the semolina flour once it is ground, creating enriched flour. Micronutrients added may include niacin (vitamin B3), riboflavin (vitamin B2), folate, thiamine (vitamin B1) and ferrous iron.\nVarieties.\nFresh.\nFresh pasta is usually locally made with fresh ingredients unless it is destined to be shipped, in which case consideration is given to the spoilage rates of the desired ingredients such as eggs or herbs. Furthermore, fresh pasta is usually made with a mixture of eggs and all-purpose flour or \"00\" low-gluten flour. Since it contains eggs, it is more tender compared to dried pasta and only takes about half the time to cook. Delicate sauces are preferred for fresh pasta in order to let the pasta take front stage.\nFresh pastas do not expand in size after cooking; therefore, of pasta are needed to serve four people generously. Fresh egg pasta is generally cut into strands of various widths and thicknesses depending on which pasta is to be made (e.g., fettuccine, pappardelle and lasagne). It is best served with meat, cheese or vegetables to create filled pastas such as ravioli, tortellini and cannelloni. Fresh egg pasta is well known in the Piedmont and Emilia-Romagna regions of northern Italy. In this area, dough is only made out of egg yolk and flour resulting in a very refined flavor and texture. This pasta is often served simply with butter sauce and thinly sliced truffles that are native to this region. In other areas, such as Apulia, fresh pasta can be made without eggs. The only ingredients needed to make the pasta dough are semolina flour and water, which is often shaped into orecchiette or . Fresh pasta for is also popular in other places including Sicily. However, the dough is prepared differently: it is made of flour and ricotta cheese instead.\nDried.\nDried pasta can also be defined as factory-made pasta because it is usually produced in large amounts that require large machines with superior processing capabilities to manufacture. Dried pasta can be shipped farther and has a longer shelf life. The ingredients required to make dried pasta include semolina flour and water. Eggs can be added for flavor and richness, but are not needed to make dried pasta. In contrast to fresh pasta, dried pasta needs to be dried at a low temperature for several days to evaporate all the moisture allowing it to be stored for a longer period. Dried pastas are best served in hearty dishes, such as rag\u00f9 sauces, soups and casseroles. Once it is cooked, the dried pasta will usually grow to twice its original size. Therefore, approximately of dried pasta serves up to four people.\nCulinary uses.\nCooking.\nPasta, whether dry or fresh, is eaten after cooking it in hot water. For Italian pasta, which is unsalted, salt is added to the cooking water. This is not the case for Asian wheat noodles, such as udon and lo mein, which are made from salty dough.\nIn Italy, pasta is often cooked to be al dente, such that it is still firm to the bite. This is because it is then often cooked in the sauce for a short time, which makes it soften further.\nThere are a number of urban myths about how pasta should be cooked. In fact, it does not generally matter whether pasta is cooked at a lower or a higher temperature, although lower temperatures require more stirring to avoid sticking, and certain stuffed pasta, such as tortellini, break up in higher temperatures. It also does not matter whether salt is added before or after bringing the water to a boil. The amount of salt has no influence on cooking speed.\nSauce.\nPasta is generally served with some type of sauce; the sauce and the type of pasta are usually matched based on consistency and ease of eating. Northern Italian cooking uses less tomato sauce, garlic and herbs, and b\u00e9chamel sauce is more common. However, Italian cuisine is best identified by individual regions. Pasta dishes with lighter use of tomato are found in Trentino-Alto Adige and Emilia-Romagna regions of northern Italy. In Bologna, the meat-based Bolognese sauce incorporates a small amount of tomato concentrate and a green sauce called pesto originates from Genoa. In central Italy, there are sauces such as tomato sauce, , and carbonara.\nTomato sauces are also present in southern Italian cuisine, where they originated. In southern Italy more complex variations include pasta paired with fresh vegetables, olives, capers or seafood. Varieties include , , , (lit.\u2009'spaghetti with garlic, [olive] oil and peperoncino') and .\nPasta can be served also in broth (pastina, or stuffed pasta, such as tortellini, and ) or in vegetable soup, typically minestrone or bean soup ().\nProcessing.\nFresh.\nIngredients to make pasta dough include semolina flour, egg, salt and water. Flour is first mounded on a flat surface and then a well in the pile of flour is created. Egg is then poured into the well and a fork is used to mix the egg and flour. There are a variety of ways to shape the sheets of pasta depending on the type required. The most popular types include penne, spaghetti and macaroni.\nKitchen pasta machines, also called pasta makers, are popular with cooks who make large amounts of fresh pasta. The cook feeds sheets of pasta dough into the machine by hand and, by turning a hand crank, rolls the pasta to thin it incrementally. On the final pass through the pasta machine, the pasta may be directed through a machine 'comb' to shape of the pasta as it emerges.\nMatrix and extrusion.\nSemolina flour consists of a protein matrix with entrapped starch granules. Upon the addition of water, during mixing, intermolecular forces allow the protein to form a more ordered structure in preparation for cooking.\nDurum wheat is ground into semolina flour which is sorted by optical scanners and cleaned. Pipes allow the flour to move to a mixing machine where it is mixed with warm water by rotating blades. When the mixture is of a lumpy consistency, the mixture is pressed into sheets or extruded. Varieties of pasta such as spaghetti and linguine are cut by rotating blades, while pasta such as penne and fusilli are extruded. The size and shape of the dies in the extruder through which the pasta is pushed determine the shape that results. The pasta is then dried at a high temperature.\nFactory-manufactured.\nThe ingredients to make dried pasta usually include water and semolina flour; egg for color and richness (in some types of pasta), and possibly vegetable juice (such as spinach, beet, tomato, carrot), herbs or spices for color and flavor. After mixing semolina flour with warm water the dough is kneaded mechanically until it becomes firm and dry. If pasta is to be flavored, eggs, vegetable juices and herbs are added at this stage. The dough is then passed into the laminator to be flattened into sheets, then compressed by a vacuum mixer-machine to clear out air bubbles and excess water from the dough until the moisture content is reduced to 12%. Next, the dough is processed in a steamer to kill any bacteria it may contain.\nThe dough is then ready to be shaped into different types of pasta. Depending on the type of pasta to be made, the dough can either be cut or extruded through dies. The pasta is set in a drying tank under specific conditions of heat, moisture and time depending on the type of pasta. The dried pasta is then packaged: fresh pasta is sealed in a clear, airtight plastic container with a mixture of carbon dioxide and nitrogen that inhibits microbial growth and prolongs the product's shelf life; dried pastas are sealed in clear plastic or cardboard packages.\nGluten-free.\nGluten, the protein found in grains such as wheat, rye, spelt and barley, contributes to protein aggregation and firm texture of a normally cooked pasta. Gluten-free pasta is produced with wheat flour substitutes, such as vegetable powders, rice, corn, quinoa, amaranth, oats and buckwheat flours. Other possible gluten-free pasta ingredients may include hydrocolloids to improve cooking pasta with high heat resistance, xanthan gum to retain moisture during storage, or hydrothermally-treated polysaccharide mixtures to produce textures similar to those of wheat pasta.\nStorage.\nThe storage of pasta depends on its processing and extent of drying. Uncooked pasta is kept dry and can sit in the cupboard for a year if airtight and stored in a cool, dry area. Cooked pasta is stored in the refrigerator for a maximum of five days in an airtight container. Adding a couple teaspoons of oil helps keep the food from sticking to itself and the container. Cooked pasta may be frozen for up to two or three months. Should the pasta be dried completely, it can be placed back in the cupboard.\nScience.\nMolecular and physical composition.\nPasta exhibits a random molecular order rather than a crystalline structure. The moisture content of dried pasta is typically around 12%, indicating that dried pasta will remain a brittle solid until it is cooked and becomes malleable. The cooked product is, as a result, softer, more flexible and chewy.\nSemolina flour is the ground endosperm of durum wheat, producing granules that absorb water during heating and an increase in viscosity due to semi-reordering of starch molecules.\nAnother major component of durum wheat is protein which plays a large role in pasta dough rheology. Gluten proteins, which include monomeric gliadins and polymeric glutenin, make up the major protein component of durum wheat (about 75\u201380%). As more water is added and shear stress is applied, gluten proteins take on an elastic characteristic and begin to form strands and sheets. The gluten matrix that results during forming of the dough becomes irreversibly associated during drying as the moisture content is lowered to form the dried pasta product.\nImpact of processing on physical structure.\nBefore the mixing process takes place, semolina particles are irregularly shaped and present in different sizes. Semolina particles become hydrated during mixing. The amount of water added to the semolina is determined based on the initial moisture content of the flour and the desired shape of the pasta. The desired moisture content of the dough is around 32% wet basis and will vary depending on the shape of pasta being produced.\nThe forming process involves the dough entering an extruder in which the rotation of a single or double screw system pushes the dough toward a die set to a specific shape. As the starch granules swell slightly in the presence of water and a low amount of thermal energy, they become embedded within the protein matrix and align along the direction of the shear caused by the extrusion process.\nStarch gelatinization and protein coagulation are the major changes that take place when pasta is cooked in boiling water. Protein and starch competing for water within the pasta cause a constant change in structure as the pasta cooks.\nProduction and market.\nIn 2015\u201316, the largest producers of dried pasta were Italy (3.2 million tonnes), the United States (2 million tonnes), Turkey (1.3 million tons), Brazil (1.2 million tonnes) and Russia (1 million tons). In 2018, Italy was the world's largest exporter of pasta, with $2.9 billion sold, followed by China with $0.9 billion.\nThe largest per capita consumers of pasta in 2015 were Italy (23.5kg/person), Tunisia (16.0kg/person), Venezuela (12.0kg/person) and Greece (11.2kg/person). In 2017, the United States was the largest consumer of pasta with 2.7 million tons.\nNutrition.\nWhen cooked, plain pasta is composed of 62% water, 31% carbohydrates (26% starch), 6% protein and 1% fat. A portion of unenriched cooked pasta provides of food energy and a moderate level of manganese (15% of the Daily Value), but few other micronutrients.\nPasta has a lower glycemic index than many other staple foods in Western culture, such as bread, potatoes and rice.\nInternational adaptations.\nAs pasta was introduced elsewhere in the world, it became incorporated into a number of local cuisines, which often have significantly different ways of preparation from those of Italy. When pasta was introduced to different nations, each culture would adopt a different style of preparation. In the past, ancient Romans cooked pasta-like foods by frying rather than boiling. It was also sweetened with honey or tossed with garum.\nAfrica.\nCountries such as Somalia, Ethiopia and Eritrea were introduced to pasta from colonization and occupation through the Italian Empire, in the 19th and 20th centuries. Southern Somalia has a dish called which has a meat sauce, typically beef based, with their local spice mix. In Ethiopia, pasta can also be served over , where it is also eaten with hands instead of cutlery. A dollop of bolognese with spice blend can be served on the side.\nAsia.\nIn Hong Kong, the local Chinese have adopted pasta, primarily spaghetti and macaroni, as an ingredient in the Hong Kong\u2013style Western cuisine. In , macaroni is cooked in water and served in broth with ham or frankfurter sausages, peas, black mushrooms and optionally eggs, reminiscent of noodle soup dishes. This is often a course for breakfast or light lunch fare.\nIn Nepal, macaroni has been adopted and cooked in a Nepalese way. Boiled macaroni is saut\u00e9ed along with cumin, turmeric, finely chopped green chillies, onions and cabbage.\nEurope.\nIn Armenia, a popular traditional pasta called arishta is first dry pan toasted so as slightly golden, and then boiled to make the pasta dish which is often topped with yogurt, butter and garlic.\nTwice a year, hundreds of people in Sardinia make a nighttime pilgrimage from the city of Nuoro to the village of Lula for the biannual Feast of San Francesco, where they eat what is possibly the world's rarest pasta. (lit.\u2009'threads of God' in the Sardinian language) is an incredibly intricate semolina pasta made by just three women who only make the pasta for the festival.\nSouth America.\nPasta is also widespread in the Southern Cone, as well most of the rest of Brazil, mostly pervasive in the areas with mild to strong Italian roots, such as Central Argentina, and the eight southernmost Brazilian states (where macaroni is called , and more general pasta is known under the umbrella term (lit.\u2009'dough'), together with some Japanese noodles, such as \"bifum\" rice vermicelli and \"yakisoba\", which also entered general taste). The local names for the pasta are many times varieties of the Italian names, such as for gnocchi, for ravioli or for tagliatelle, although some of the most popular pasta in Brazil, such as the ('screw', 'bolt'), a specialty of the country's pasta salads, are also way different both in name and format from its closest Italian relatives, in this case the fusilli.\nNorth America.\nIn the United States, fettuccine Alfredo is a popular Italian-style dish.\nOceania.\nIn Australia, boscaiola sauce, based on bacon and mushrooms, is popular.\nRegulations.\nItaly.\nAlthough numerous variations of ingredients for different pasta products are known, in Italy the commercial manufacturing and labeling of pasta for sale as a food product within the country is highly regulated. Italian regulations recognize three categories of commercially manufactured dried pasta as well as manufactured fresh and stabilized pasta:\nThe Italian regulations under Presidential Decree No. 187 apply only to the commercial manufacturing of pastas both made and sold within Italy. They are not applicable either to pasta made for export from Italy or to pastas imported into Italy from other countries. They also do not apply to pastas made in restaurants.\nUnited States.\nIn the US, regulations for commercial pasta products occur both at the federal and state levels. At the Federal level, consistent with Section 341 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has defined standards of identity for what are broadly termed \"macaroni products\". These standards appear in 21 \"CFR\" Part 139. Those regulations state the requirements for standardized \"macaroni products\" of 15 specific types of dried pastas, including the ingredients and product-specific labeling for conforming products sold in the US, including imports:\nState mandates.\nThe federal regulations under 21 \"CFR\" Part 139 are standards for the products noted, not mandates. Following the FDA's standards, a number of states have, at various times, enacted their own statutes that serve as mandates for various forms of macaroni and noodle products that may be produced or sold within their borders. Many of these specifically require that the products sold within those states be of the enriched form. According to a report released by the Connecticut Office of Legislative Research, when Connecticut's law was adopted in 1972 that mandated certain grain products, including macaroni products, sold within the state to be enriched it joined 38 to 40 other states in adopting the federal standards as mandates.\nUSDA school nutrition.\nBeyond the FDA's standards and state statutes, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), which regulates federal school nutrition programs, broadly requires grain and bread products served under these programs either be enriched or whole grain (see 7 \"CFR\" 210.10 (k) (5)). This includes macaroni and noodle products that are served as part the category grains/breads requirements within those programs. The USDA also allows that enriched macaroni products fortified with protein may be used and counted to meet either a grains/breads or meat/alternative meat requirement, but not as both components within the same meal.\n2025 tariffs.\nIn November 2025, the U.S. Commerce Department imposed a 92% antidumping duty on pasta produced by 13 Italian companies, including La Molisana, in addition to an existing 15% tariff on European Union imports. The combined duties, among the steepest enacted under the Trump administration, prompted major Italian exporters to consider withdrawing their pasta brands from U.S. markets due to high costs. The decision has sparked diplomatic tensions between Washington and Rome, with Italy contesting the tariffs as harmful to one of its most iconic industries.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

There are many forms of polymerization and different systems exist to categorize them.\nIn chemical compounds, polymerization can occur via a variety of reaction mechanisms that vary in complexity due to the functional groups present in the reactants and their inherent steric effects. In more straightforward polymerizations, alkenes form polymers through relatively simple radical reactions; in contrast, reactions involving substitution at a carbonyl group require more complex synthesis due to the way in which reactants polymerize.\nAs alkenes can polymerize in somewhat straightforward radical reactions, they form useful compounds such as polyethylene and polyvinyl chloride (PVC), which are produced in high tonnages each year due to their usefulness in manufacturing processes of commercial products, such as piping, insulation and packaging. In general, polymers such as PVC are referred to as \"homopolymers\", as they consist of repeated long chains or structures of the same monomer unit, whereas polymers that consist of more than one monomer unit are referred to as copolymers (or co-polymers).\nformula_1\nformula_2formula_3formula_4\nOther monomer units, such as formaldehyde hydrates or simple aldehydes, are able to polymerize themselves at quite low temperatures (ca. \u221280\u00a0\u00b0C) to form trimers; molecules consisting of 3 monomer units, which can cyclize to form ring cyclic structures, or undergo further reactions to form tetramers, or 4 monomer-unit compounds. Such small polymers are referred to as oligomers. Generally, because formaldehyde is an exceptionally reactive electrophile it allows nucleophilic addition of hemiacetal intermediates, which are in general short-lived and relatively unstable \"mid-stage\" compounds that react with other non-polar molecules present to form more stable polymeric compounds.\nPolymerization that is not sufficiently moderated and proceeds at a fast rate can be very dangerous. This phenomenon is known as autoacceleration, and can cause fires and explosions.\nStep-growth vs. chain-growth polymerization.\nStep-growth and chain-growth are the main classes of polymerization reaction mechanisms. The former is often easier to implement but requires precise control of stoichiometry. The latter more reliably affords high molecular-weight polymers, but only applies to certain monomers.\nStep-growth.\nIn step-growth (or step) polymerization, pairs of reactants, of any lengths, combine at each step to form a longer polymer molecule. The average molar mass increases slowly. Long chains form only late in the reaction.\nStep-growth polymers are formed by independent reaction steps between functional groups of monomer units, usually containing heteroatoms such as nitrogen or oxygen. Most step-growth polymers are also classified as condensation polymers, since a small molecule such as water is lost when the polymer chain is lengthened. For example, polyester chains grow by reaction of alcohol and carboxylic acid groups to form ester links with loss of water. However, there are exceptions; for example polyurethanes are step-growth polymers formed from isocyanate and alcohol bifunctional monomers) without loss of water or other volatile molecules, and are classified as addition polymers rather than condensation polymers.\nStep-growth polymers increase in molecular weight at a very slow rate at lower conversions and reach moderately high molecular weights only at very high conversion (i.e., &gt;95%). Solid state polymerization to afford polyamides (e.g., nylons) is an example of step-growth polymerization.\nChain-growth.\nIn chain-growth (or chain) polymerization, the only chain-extension reaction step is the addition of a monomer to a growing chain with an active center such as a free radical, cation, or anion. Once the growth of a chain is initiated by formation of an active center, chain propagation is usually rapid by addition of a sequence of monomers. Long chains are formed from the beginning of the reaction.\nChain-growth polymerization (or addition polymerization) involves the linking together of unsaturated monomers, especially containing carbon-carbon double bonds. The pi-bond is lost by formation of a new sigma bond. Chain-growth polymerization is involved in the manufacture of polymers such as polyethylene, polypropylene, polyvinyl chloride (PVC), and acrylate. In these cases, the alkenes RCH=CH2 are converted to high molecular weight alkanes (-RCHCH2-)n (R = H, CH3, Cl, CO2CH3).\nOther forms of chain growth polymerization include cationic addition polymerization and anionic addition polymerization. A special case of chain-growth polymerization leads to living polymerization. Ziegler\u2013Natta polymerization allows considerable control of polymer branching.\nDiverse methods are employed to manipulate the initiation, propagation, and termination rates during chain polymerization. A related issue is temperature control, also called heat management, during these reactions, which are often highly exothermic. For example, for the polymerization of ethylene, 93.6 kJ of energy are released per mole of monomer.\nThe manner in which polymerization is conducted is a highly evolved technology. Methods include emulsion polymerization, solution polymerization, suspension polymerization, and precipitation polymerization. Although the polymer dispersity and molecular weight may be improved, these methods may introduce additional processing requirements to isolate the product from a solvent.\nPhotopolymerization.\nMost photopolymerization reactions are chain-growth polymerizations which are initiated by the absorption of visible or ultraviolet light. Photopolymerization can also be a step-growth polymerization. The light may be absorbed either directly by the reactant monomer (\"direct\" photopolymerization), or else by a \"photosensitizer\" which absorbs the light and then transfers energy to the monomer. In general, only the initiation step differs from that of the ordinary thermal polymerization of the same monomer; subsequent propagation, termination, and chain-transfer steps are unchanged.\nIn step-growth photopolymerization, absorption of light triggers an addition (or condensation) reaction between two comonomers that do not react without light. A propagation cycle is not initiated because each growth step requires the assistance of light.\nPhotopolymerization can be used as a photographic or printing process because polymerization only occurs in regions which have been exposed to light. Unreacted monomer can be removed from unexposed regions, leaving a relief polymeric image. Several forms of 3D printing\u2014including layer-by-layer stereolithography and two-photon absorption 3D photopolymerization\u2014use photopolymerization.\nMultiphoton polymerization using single pulses have also been demonstrated for fabrication of complex structures using a digital micromirror device.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Her novels and short stories often explore the relationship between the human mind and technology. Her debut novel, \"Mindplayers\", was nominated for the Philip K. Dick Award in 1988.\nEarly years.\nCadigan was born in Schenectady, New York, and grew up in Fitchburg, Massachusetts.\nIn the 1960s Cadigan and a childhood friend \"invented a whole secret life in which we were twins from the planet Venus\", she told National Public Radio. \"The Beatles \"came to us for advice about their songs and how to deal with fame and other important matters.\" She goes on to say: \"On occasion, they would ask us to use our highly developed shape-shifting ability to become them, and finish recording sessions and concert tours when they were too tired to go on themselves.\" The Venusian twins had other superpowers, that they would sometimes use to help out Superman, Wonder Woman and other heroes, she said.\nCadigan was educated in theater at the University of Massachusetts Amherst and studied science fiction and science fiction writing at the University of Kansas (KU) under science fiction author and editor James Gunn.\nCadigan met her first husband, Rufus Cadigan, while in college; they divorced shortly after she graduated from KU in 1975. That same year, Cadigan joined the convention committee for MidAmeriCon, the 34th World Science Fiction Convention being held in Kansas City, Missouri, over the 1976 Labor Day weekend; she served on the committee as the convention's guest liaison to writer guest of honor Robert A. Heinlein, as well as helped to develop programming for the convention. At the same time, she also worked for fantasy writer Tom Reamy at his Nickelodeon Graphics Arts Service studio, where she daily typset various jobs. She also prepared the type galleys for MidAmeriCon's various publications, including the convention's hardcover program book. Following Reamy's death on 4 November 1977, Cadigan went to work as a writer for Kansas City, MO's Hallmark Cards company. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, she also edited the small press fantasy and science fiction magazines \"Chacal\" and later \"Shayol\" with her second husband, Arnie Fenner. Her and Fenner\u2019s son, Robert, was born in 1985.\nCadigan emigrated to London in 1996, where she is married to her third husband, Christopher Fowler (not to be confused with the author of the same name). She became a UK citizen in late 2014.\nWriting career.\nCadigan sold her first professional science fiction story in 1980. Her success as an author encouraged her to become a full-time writer in 1987.\nCadigan's first novel, \"Mindplayers\", introduces what becomes the common theme to all her works: her stories blur the line between reality and perception by making the human mind a real, explorable place. Her second novel, \"Synners\", expands upon the same theme; both feature a future where direct access to the mind via technology is possible. While her stories include many of the gritty, unvarnished characteristics of the cyberpunk genre, she further specializes in this exploration of the speculative relationship between technology and the perceptions of the human mind.\nCadigan has won a number of awards, including the 2013 Hugo Award for \"The Girl-Thing Who Went Out for Sushi\" in the Best Novelette category, and the Arthur C. Clarke Award in 1992 and 1995 for her novels \"Synners\" and \"Fools\".\nRobert A.

{"id": "23878", "revid": "1233313", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23878", "title": "Penguin", "text": "Family of aquatic flightless birds\nPenguins are a group of flightless, semi-aquatic, sea birds which live almost exclusively in the Southern Hemisphere. Only one species, the Gal\u00e1pagos penguin, lives at, and slightly north of, the equator. Highly adapted for life in the ocean water, penguins have countershaded dark and white plumage and flippers for swimming. Most penguins feed on krill, fish, squid and other forms of sea life which they catch with their bills and swallow whole while swimming. A penguin has a spiny tongue and powerful jaws to grip slippery prey.\nThey spend about half of their lives on land and the other half in the sea. The largest living species is the emperor penguin (\"Aptenodytes forsteri\"): on average, adults are about tall and weigh . The smallest penguin species is the little blue penguin (\"Eudyptula minor\"), also known as the fairy penguin, which stands around tall and weighs . Today, larger penguins generally inhabit colder regions, and smaller penguins inhabit regions with temperate or tropical climates. Some prehistoric penguin species were enormous: as tall or heavy as an adult human. There was a great diversity of species in subantarctic regions, and at least one giant species in a region around 2,000\u00a0km south of the equator 35\u00a0mya, during the Late Eocene, a climate decidedly warmer than today.\nEtymology.\nThe word \"penguin\" first appears in literature at the end of the 16th century as a synonym for the great auk. When European explorers discovered what are today known as penguins in the Southern Hemisphere, they noticed their similar appearance to the great auk of the Northern Hemisphere and named them after this bird, although they are not closely related.\nThe etymology of the word \"penguin\" is still debated. The English word is not apparently of French, Breton or Spanish origin (the latter two are attributed to the French word ), but first appears in English or Dutch.\nSome dictionaries suggest a derivation from Welsh , 'head' and , 'white', including the \"Oxford English Dictionary\", the \"American Heritage Dictionary\", the \"Century Dictionary\" and \"Merriam-Webster\", on the basis that the name was originally applied to the great auk, either because it was found on White Head Island () in Newfoundland, or because it had white circles around its eyes (though the head was black). However, the Welsh word can also be used to mean 'end' and, in a maritime context, means 'front end or part, bow (of a ship), prow'.\nAn alternative etymology links the word to Latin , which means 'fat' or 'oil'. Support for this etymology can be found in the alternative Germanic word for penguin, or 'fat-goose', and the related Dutch word .\nA group of penguins in the water is sometimes called a \"raft\".\nPinguinus.\nSince 1871, the Latin word \"Pinguinus\" has been used in scientific classification to name the genus of the great auk (\"Pinguinus impennis\", meaning \"plump or fat without flight feathers\"), which became extinct in the mid-19th century. As confirmed by a 2004 genetic study, the genus \"Pinguinus\" belongs in the family of the auks (Alcidae), within the order of the Charadriiformes.\nThe birds currently known as penguins were discovered later and were so named by sailors because of their physical resemblance to the great auk. Despite this resemblance, however, they are not auks, and are not closely related to the great auk. They do not belong in the genus \"Pinguinus\", and are not classified in the same family and order as the great auk. They were classified in 1831 by Charles Lucien Bonaparte in several distinct genera within the family Spheniscidae and order Sphenisciformes.\nSystematics and evolution.\nTaxonomy.\nThe family name of Spheniscidae was given by Charles Lucien Bonaparte from the genus Spheniscus, the name of that genus comes from the Greek word \"sph\u0113n\" \"wedge\" used for the shape of an African penguin's swimming flippers.\nSome recent sources apply the phylogenetic taxon Spheniscidae to what here is referred to as Spheniscinae. Furthermore, they restrict the phylogenetic taxon Sphenisciformes to flightless taxa, and establish the phylogenetic taxon Pansphenisciformes as equivalent to the Linnean taxon Sphenisciformes, i.e., including any flying basal \"proto-penguins\" to be discovered eventually. Given that neither the relationships of the penguin subfamilies to each other nor the placement of the penguins in the avian phylogeny is presently resolved, this is confusing, so the established Linnean system is followed here.\nThe number of penguin species is typically listed as between seventeen and nineteen. The International Ornithologists' Union recognizes six genera and eighteen species:\nEvolution.\nAlthough the evolutionary and biogeographic history of Sphenisciformes is well-researched, many prehistoric forms are not fully described. Some seminal articles about the evolutionary history of penguins have been published since 2005.\nThe basal penguins lived around the time of the Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction event in the general area of southern New Zealand and Byrd Land, Antarctica. Due to plate tectonics, these areas were at that time less than apart rather than . The most recent common ancestor of penguins and Procellariiformes can be roughly dated to the Campanian\u2013Maastrichtian boundary, around 70\u201368 mya.\nBasal fossils.\nThe oldest known fossil penguin species are known from the Waipara Greensand of New Zealand, which spans the late Danian to early Thanetian stages (~62.5\u201358 Ma) of the Paleocene epoch. Several genera have been named from these outcrops, including \"Archaeodyptes\", \"Daniadyptes\", \"Muriwaimanu\", \"Sequiwaimanu\", \"Waimanu\", \"Waimanutaha\", and \"Waiparadyptes\". While they were not as well-adapted to aquatic life as modern penguins, they were still flightless, with short wings adapted for deep diving. They swam on the surface using mainly their feet, but the wings were\u2014as opposed to most other diving birds (both living and extinct)\u2014already adapting to underwater locomotion.\n\"Perudyptes\" from northern Peru was dated to 42 mya. An unnamed fossil from Argentina proves that, by the Bartonian (Middle Eocene), some 39\u201338 mya, primitive penguins had spread to South America and were in the process of expanding into Atlantic waters.\nPalaeeudyptines.\nDuring the Late Eocene and the Early Oligocene (40\u201330 mya), some lineages of gigantic penguins existed. Nordenskjoeld's giant penguin was the tallest, growing nearly tall. The New Zealand giant penguin was probably the heaviest, weighing or more. Both were found on New Zealand, the former also in the Antarctic farther eastwards.\nTraditionally, most extinct species of penguins, giant or small, had been placed in the paraphyletic subfamily called Palaeeudyptinae. More recently, with new taxa being discovered and placed in the phylogeny if possible, it is becoming accepted that there were at least two major extinct lineages. One or two closely related ones occurred in Patagonia, and at least one other\u2014which is or includes the paleeudyptines as recognized today \u2013 occurred on most Antarctic and Subantarctic coasts.\nSize plasticity was significant at this initial stage of radiation: on Seymour Island, Antarctica, for example, around 10 known species of penguins ranging in size from medium to large apparently coexisted some 35 mya during the Priabonian (Late Eocene). It is not known whether the palaeeudyptines constitute a monophyletic lineage, or whether gigantism was evolved independently in a restricted Palaeeudyptinae and the Anthropornithinae \u2013 whether they were considered valid, or whether there was a wide size range present in the Palaeeudyptinae as delimited (i.e., including \"Anthropornis nordenskjoeldi\"). The oldest well-described giant penguin, the -tall \"Icadyptes salasi\", existed as far north as northern Peru about 36 mya.\nGigantic penguins had disappeared by the end of the Paleogene, around 25 mya. Their decline and disappearance coincided with the spread of the Squalodontidae and other primitive, fish-eating toothed whales, which competed with them for food and were ultimately more successful. A new lineage, the Paraptenodytes, which includes smaller and stout-legged forms, had already arisen in southernmost South America by that time. The early Neogene saw the emergence of another morphotype in the same area, the similarly sized but more gracile Palaeospheniscinae, as well as the radiation that gave rise to the current biodiversity of penguins.\nOrigin and systematics of modern penguins.\nModern penguins constitute two undisputed clades and another two more basal genera with more ambiguous relationships. To help resolve the evolution of this order, 19 high-coverage genomes that, together with two previously published genomes, encompass all extant penguin species have been sequenced. The origin of the Spheniscinae lies probably in the latest Paleogene and, geographically, it must have been much the same as the general area in which the order evolved: the oceans between the Australia-New Zealand region and the Antarctic. Presumably diverging from other penguins around 40 mya, it seems that the Spheniscinae were for quite some time limited to their ancestral area, as the well-researched deposits of the Antarctic Peninsula and Patagonia have not yielded Paleogene fossils of the subfamily. Also, the earliest spheniscine lineages are those with the most southern distribution.\nThe genus \"Aptenodytes\" appears to be the basalmost divergence among living penguins. They have bright yellow-orange neck, breast, and bill patches; incubate by placing their eggs on their feet, and when they hatch the chicks are almost naked. This genus has a distribution centred on the Antarctic coasts and barely extends to some Subantarctic islands today.\n\"Pygoscelis\" contains species with a fairly simple black-and-white head pattern; their distribution is intermediate, centred on Antarctic coasts but extending somewhat northwards from there. In external morphology, these apparently still resemble the common ancestor of the Spheniscinae, as \"Aptenodytes\"' autapomorphies are, in most cases, fairly pronounced adaptations related to that genus' extreme habitat conditions. As the former genus, \"Pygoscelis\" seems to have diverged during the Bartonian, but the range expansion and radiation that led to the present-day diversity probably did not occur until much later; around the Burdigalian stage of the Early Miocene, roughly 20\u201315 mya.\nThe genera \"Spheniscus\" and \"Eudyptula\" contain species with a mostly Subantarctic distribution centred on South America; some, however, range quite far northwards. They all lack carotenoid colouration and the former genus has a conspicuous banded head pattern; they are unique among living penguins by nesting in burrows. This group probably radiated eastwards with the Antarctic Circumpolar Current out of the ancestral range of modern penguins throughout the Chattian (Late Oligocene), starting approximately 28 mya. While the two genera separated during this time, the present-day diversity is the result of a Pliocene radiation, taking place some 4\u20132 mya.\nThe \"Megadyptes\"\u2013\"Eudyptes\" clade occurs at similar latitudes (though not as far north as the Gal\u00e1pagos penguin), has its highest diversity in the New Zealand region, and represents a westward dispersal. They are characterized by hairy yellow ornamental head feathers; their bills are at least partly red. These two genera diverged apparently in the Middle Miocene (Langhian, roughly 15\u201314 mya), although the living species of \"Eudyptes\" are the product of a later radiation, stretching from about the late Tortonian (Late Miocene, 8 mya) to the end of the Pliocene.\nGeography.\nThe geographical and temporal pattern of spheniscine evolution corresponds closely to two episodes of global cooling documented in the paleoclimatic record. The emergence of the Subantarctic lineage at the end of the Bartonian corresponds with the onset of the slow period of cooling that eventually led to the ice ages some 35 million years later. With habitat on the Antarctic coasts declining, by the Priabonian more hospitable conditions for most penguins existed in the Subantarctic regions rather than in Antarctica itself. Notably, the cold Antarctic Circumpolar Current also started as a continuous circumpolar flow only around 30 mya, on the one hand forcing the Antarctic cooling, and on the other facilitating the eastward expansion of \"Spheniscus\" to South America and eventually beyond. Despite this, there is no fossil evidence to support the idea of crown radiation from the Antarctic continent in the Paleogene, although DNA study favors such a radiation.\nLater, an interspersed period of slight warming was ended by the Middle Miocene Climate Transition, a sharp drop in global average temperature from 14 to 12 mya, and similar abrupt cooling events followed at 8 mya and 4 mya; by the end of the Tortonian, the Antarctic ice sheet was already much like today in volume and extent. The emergence of most of today's Subantarctic penguin species almost certainly was caused by this sequence of Neogene climate shifts.\nRelationship to other bird orders.\nPenguin ancestry beyond \"Waimanu\" remains unknown and not well-resolved by molecular or morphological analyses. The latter tend to be confounded by the strong adaptive autapomorphies of the Sphenisciformes; a sometimes perceived fairly close relationship between penguins and grebes is almost certainly an error based on both groups' strong diving adaptations, which are homoplasies. On the other hand, different DNA sequence datasets do not agree in detail with each other either.\nWhat seems clear is that penguins belong to a clade of Neoaves (living birds except for paleognaths and fowl) that comprises what is sometimes called \"higher waterbirds\" to distinguish them from the more ancient waterfowl. This group contains such birds as storks, rails, and the seabirds, with the possible exception of the Charadriiformes.\nInside this group, penguin relationships are far less clear. Depending on the analysis and dataset, a close relationship to Ciconiiformes or to Procellariiformes has been suggested. Some think the penguin-like plotopterids (usually considered relatives of cormorants and anhingas) may actually be a sister group of the penguins and those penguins may have ultimately shared a common ancestor with the Pelecaniformes and consequently would have to be included in that order, or that the plotopterids were not as close to other pelecaniforms as generally assumed, which would necessitate splitting the traditional Pelecaniformes into three.\nA 2014 analysis of whole genomes of 48 representative bird species has concluded that penguins are the sister group of Procellariiformes, from which they diverged about 60 million years ago (95% CI, 56.8\u201362.7).\nThe distantly related Charadriiform puffins, which live in the North Pacific and North Atlantic, developed similar characteristics to survive in the Arctic and sub-Arctic environments. Like the penguins, puffins have a white chest, black back and short stubby wings providing excellent swimming ability in icy water. But, unlike penguins, puffins can fly, as flightless birds would not survive alongside land-based predators such as polar bears and foxes; there are no such predators in the Antarctic. Their similarities indicate that similar environments in different parts of the world can result in similar evolutionary developments, i.e. convergent evolution. Puffins are auks (Alcidae), akin to the aforementioned great auk, which have a greater resemblance to \"true\" penguins after converging on more features of their anatomy.\nAnatomy and physiology.\nPenguins are superbly adapted to aquatic life. Their wings have evolved to become flippers, useless for flight in the air. In the water, however, penguins are astonishingly agile. Penguins' swimming looks very similar to birds' flight in the air. Within the smooth plumage a layer of air is preserved, ensuring buoyancy. The air layer also helps insulate the birds in cold waters. On land, penguins use their tails and wings to maintain balance for their upright stance.\nAll penguins are countershaded for camouflage \u2013 that is, they have black backs and wings with white fronts. A predator looking up from below (such as an orca or a leopard seal) has difficulty distinguishing between a white penguin belly and the reflective water surface. The dark plumage on their backs camouflages them from above.\nGentoo penguins are the fastest underwater birds in the world. They are capable of reaching speeds up to 36\u00a0km (about 22 miles) per hour while searching for food or escaping from predators. They are also able to dive to depths of 170\u2013200 meters (about 560\u2013660 feet). The small penguins do not usually dive deep; they catch their prey near the surface in dives that normally last only one or two minutes. Larger penguins can dive deep in case of need. Emperor penguins are the world's deepest-diving birds. They can dive to depths of approximately while searching for food.\nPenguins either waddle on their feet or slide on their bellies across the snow while using their feet to propel and steer themselves, a movement called \"tobogganing\", which conserves energy while moving quickly. They also jump with both feet together if they want to move more quickly or cross steep or rocky terrain.\nPenguins have an average sense of hearing for birds; this is used by parents and chicks to locate one another in crowded colonies. Their eyes are adapted for underwater vision and are their primary means of locating prey and avoiding predators; in air it has been suggested that they are nearsighted, although research has not supported this hypothesis.\nPenguins have a thick layer of insulating feathers that keeps them warm in water (heat loss in water is much greater than in air). The emperor penguin has a maximum feather density of about nine feathers per square centimeter which is actually much lower than other birds that live in Antarctic environments. However, they have been identified as having at least four different \"types\" of feather: in addition to the traditional feather, the emperor has afterfeathers, plumules, and filoplumes. The afterfeathers are downy plumes that attach directly to the main feathers and were once thought to account for the bird's ability to conserve heat when under water; the plumules are small down feathers that attach directly to the skin, and are much more dense in penguins than other birds; lastly the filoplumes are small (less than 1\u00a0cm long) naked shafts that end in a splay of fibers\u2014 filoplumes were thought to give flying birds a sense of where their plumage was and whether or not it needed preening, so their presence in penguins may seem inconsistent, but penguins also preen extensively.\nThe emperor penguin has the largest body mass of all penguins, which further reduces relative surface area and heat loss. They also are able to control blood flow to their extremities, reducing the amount of blood that gets cold, but still keeping the extremities from freezing. In the extreme cold of the Antarctic winter, the females are at sea fishing for food, leaving the males to brave the weather by themselves. They often huddle together to keep warm and rotate positions to make sure that each penguin gets a turn in the centre of the heat pack.\nCalculations of the heat loss and retention ability of marine endotherms suggest that most extant penguins are too small to survive in such cold environments. In 2007, Thomas and Fordyce wrote about the \"heterothermic loophole\" that penguins utilize in order to survive in Antarctica. All extant penguins, even those that live in warmer climates, have a counter-current heat exchanger called the humeral plexus. The flippers of penguins have at least three branches of the axillary artery, which allows cold blood to be heated by blood that has already been warmed and limits heat loss from the flippers. This system allows penguins to efficiently use their body heat and explains why such small animals can survive in the extreme cold.\nThey can drink salt water because their supraorbital gland filters excess salt from the bloodstream. The salt is excreted in a concentrated fluid from the nasal passages.\nAround one in 50,000 penguins (of most species) are born with brown rather than black plumage. These are called isabelline penguins. Isabellinism is different from albinism. Isabelline penguins tend to live shorter lives than normal penguins, as they are not well-camouflaged against the deep and are often passed over as mates.\nBehaviour.\nBreeding.\n Gentoo penguin watching over a sleeping chick at Brown Bluff\nPenguins for the most part breed in large colonies, the exceptions being the yellow-eyed and Fiordland species; these colonies may range in size from as few as 100 pairs for gentoo penguins to several hundred thousand in the case of king, macaroni and chinstrap penguins. Living in colonies results in a high level of social interaction between birds, which has led to a large repertoire of visual as well as vocal displays in all penguin species. \"Agonistic\" displays are those intended to confront or drive off, or alternately appease and avoid conflict with, other individuals.\nPenguins form monogamous pairs for a breeding season, though the rate the same pair recouples varies drastically. Most penguins lay two eggs in a clutch, although the two largest species, the emperor and the king penguins, lay only one. With the exception of the emperor penguin, where the male does it all, all penguins share the incubation duties. These incubation shifts can last days and even weeks as one member of the pair feeds at sea.\nPenguins generally only lay one brood; the exception is the little penguin, which can raise two or three broods in a season.\nPenguin eggs are smaller than any other bird species when compared proportionally to the weight of the parent birds; at , the little penguin egg is 4.7% of its mothers' weight, and the emperor penguin egg is 2.3%. The relatively thick shell forms between 10 and 16% of the weight of a penguin egg, presumably to reduce the effects of dehydration and to minimize the risk of breakage in an adverse nesting environment. The yolk, too, is large and comprises 22\u201331% of the egg. Some yolk often remains when a chick is born, and is thought to help sustain the chick if the parents are delayed in returning with food.\nWhen emperor penguin mothers lose a chick, they sometimes attempt to \"steal\" another mother's chick, usually unsuccessfully as other females in the vicinity assist the defending mother in keeping her chick. In some species, such as emperor and king penguins, the chicks assemble in large groups called cr\u00e8ches.\nDistribution and habitat.\nAlthough almost all penguin species are native to the Southern Hemisphere, they are not found only in cold climates, such as Antarctica. In fact, only a few species of penguin actually live so far south. Several species live in the temperate zone; one, the Gal\u00e1pagos penguin, lives as far north as the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands, but this is only made possible by the cold, rich waters of the Antarctic Humboldt Current that flows around these islands. Also, though the climate of the Arctic and Antarctic regions is similar, there are no penguins found in the Arctic.\nSeveral authors have suggested that penguins are a good example of Bergmann's Rule where larger-bodied populations live at higher latitudes than smaller-bodied populations. There is some disagreement about this and several other authors have noted that there are fossil penguin species that contradict this hypothesis and that ocean currents and upwellings are likely to have had a greater effect on species diversity than latitude alone.\nMajor populations of penguins are found in Angola, Antarctica, Argentina, Australia, Chile, Namibia, New Zealand, and South Africa. Satellite images and photos released in 2018 show the population of 2 million in France's remote Ile aux Cochons has collapsed, with barely 200,000 remaining, according to a study published in Antarctic Science.\nConservation status.\nThe majority of living penguin species have declining populations. According to the IUCN Red List, their conservation statuses range from Least Concern through to Endangered.\nPenguins and humans.\nPenguins have no special fear of humans and will often approach groups of people. This is probably because penguins have no land predators in Antarctica or the nearby offshore islands. They are preyed upon by other birds like skuas, especially in eggs and as fledglings. Other birds like petrels, sheathbills, and gulls also eat the chicks. Dogs preyed upon penguins while they were allowed in Antarctica during the age of early human exploration as sled dogs, but dogs have long since been banned from Antarctica. Instead, adult penguins are at risk at sea from predators such as sharks, orcas, and leopard seals. Typically, penguins do not approach closer than around , at which point they appear to become nervous.\nIn June 2011, an emperor penguin came ashore on New Zealand's Peka Peka Beach, off course on its journey to Antarctica. Nicknamed Happy Feet, after the film of the same name, it was suffering from heat exhaustion and had to undergo a number of operations to remove objects like driftwood and sand from its stomach. Happy Feet was a media sensation, with extensive coverage on TV and the web, including a live stream that had thousands of views and a visit from English actor Stephen Fry. Once he had recovered, Happy Feet was released back into the water south of New Zealand.\nIn popular culture.\nPenguins are widely considered endearing for their unusually upright, waddling gait, swimming ability and (compared to other birds) lack of fear of humans. Their black-and-white plumage is often likened to a white tie suit. Some writers and artists have penguins based at the North Pole, but there are no wild penguins in the Arctic. The cartoon series \"Chilly Willy\" helped perpetuate this myth, as the title penguin would interact with Arctic or sub-Arctic species, such as polar bears and walruses.\nPenguins have been the subject of many books and films, such as \"Happy Feet\", \"Surf's Up\" and \"Penguins of Madagascar\", all CGI films; \"March of the Penguins\", a documentary based on the migration process of the emperor penguin; and \"Farce of the Penguins\", a parody of the documentary. \"Mr. Popper's Penguins\" is a children's book written by Richard and Florence Atwater; it was named a Newbery Honor Book in 1939. Penguins have also appeared in a number of cartoons and television dramas, including \"Pingu\", co-created by Otmar Gutmann and Erika Brueggemann in 1990 and covering more than 100 short episodes. At the end of 2009, \"Entertainment Weekly\" put it on its end-of-the-decade \"best-of\" list, saying, \"Whether they were walking (\"March of the Penguins\"), dancing (\"Happy Feet\"), or hanging ten (\"Surf's Up\"), these oddly adorable birds took flight at the box office all decade long.\"\nA video game called \"Pengo\" was released by Sega in 1982. Set in Antarctica, the player controls a penguin character who must navigate mazes of ice cubes. The player is rewarded with cut-scenes of animated penguins marching, dancing, saluting and playing peekaboo. Several remakes and enhanced editions have followed, most recently in 2012. Penguins are also sometimes depicted in music.\nIn 1941, DC Comics introduced the avian-themed character of the Penguin as a supervillain adversary of the superhero Batman (\"Detective Comics\" #58). He became one of the most enduring enemies in Batman's rogues gallery. In the 60s \"Batman\" TV series, as played by Burgess Meredith, he was one of the most popular characters, and in Tim Burton's reimagining of the story, the character played by Danny Devito in the 1992 film \"Batman Returns\", employed an actual army of penguins (mostly African penguins and king penguins).\nSeveral pro, minor, college and high school sport teams in the United States have named themselves after the species, including the Pittsburgh Penguins team in the National Hockey League and the Youngstown State Penguins in college athletics.\nPenguins featured regularly in the cartoons of U.K. cartoonist Steve Bell in his strip in \"The Guardian\" newspaper, particularly during and following the Falklands War. Opus the Penguin, from the cartoons of Berkeley Breathed, is also described as hailing from the Falklands. Opus was a comical, \"existentialist\" penguin character in the cartoons \"Bloom County\", \"Outland\" and \"Opus\". He was also the star in the animated Christmas TV special \"A Wish for Wings That Work\".\nIn the mid-2000s, penguins became one of the most publicized species of animals that form lasting homosexual couples. A children's book, \"And Tango Makes Three\", was written about one such penguin family in the New York Zoo.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The screenplay, written by Joseph Stefano, was based on the 1959 novel of the same name by Robert Bloch. The film stars Anthony Perkins, Janet Leigh, Vera Miles, John Gavin and Martin Balsam. The plot centers on an encounter between on-the-run embezzler Marion Crane (Leigh), shy motel proprietor Norman Bates (Perkins) and his disturbed mother. A private investigator (Balsam), Marion's lover Sam Loomis (Gavin) and her sister Lila (Miles) investigate her disappearance.\n\"Psycho\" was seen as a departure from Hitchcock's previous film, \"North by Northwest\" (1959), as it was filmed on a small budget in black-and-white by the crew of his television series \"Alfred Hitchcock Presents\". Initially, the film divided critics due to its controversial subject matter, but audience interest and outstanding box-office returns prompted a major critical re-evaluation. \"Psycho\" was a massive commercial success; from a budget of $806,947 ($6.2 million with 2025 inflation), the film gained $50 million ($384.5 million with 2025 inflation) at the box office, worldwide, not including the money made with rentals. \"Psycho\" was nominated for four Academy Awards, including Best Director for Hitchcock and Best Supporting Actress for Leigh.\n\"Psycho\" is now considered one of Hitchcock's best films, and is arguably his most famous and influential work. It has been hailed as a major work of cinematic art by international film critics and scholars who praise its slick direction, tense atmosphere, impressive camerawork, memorable score and iconic performances. Additionally, the shower scene has become one of the best-known in all of cinema. It is regarded as \"the most heavily analyzed film in the long career of the most investigated director in the history of American film\" and often ranked among the greatest films of all time. It set a new level of acceptability for violence, deviant behavior and sexuality in American films, and has been considered to be one of the earliest examples of the slasher film genre. After Hitchcock's death in 1980, Universal Pictures produced follow-ups: three sequels, a remake, a made-for-television spin-off and a television series. In 1992, the Library of Congress deemed the film \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" and selected it for preservation in the United States National Film Registry.\nPlot.\nMarion Crane, a real estate secretary in Phoenix, steals $40,000 in cash from her employer after hearing her boyfriend, Sam Loomis, complain that his debts are delaying their marriage. She sets off to drive to Sam's home in the town of Fairvale, California, switching cars in Bakersfield after an encounter with a suspicious policeman. A heavy rainstorm forces Marion to stop at the secluded Bates Motel just a few miles from Fairvale. Norman Bates, the proprietor, whose Second Empire style house overlooks the motel, registers Marion (who uses an alias) and invites her to dinner with him in the motel's office. When Norman returns to his house to retrieve the food, Marion overhears him arguing with his mother about his desire to dine with Marion. After he returns, he discusses his hobby as a taxidermist, his mother's \"illness\" and how people have a \"private trap\" they want to escape. When Marion suggests that Norman should have his mother institutionalized, he becomes greatly offended and insists that she's harmless. Marion decides to drive back to Phoenix in the morning to return the stolen money. As she showers, a shadowy figure enters the bathroom with a kitchen knife and stabs her to death. Shortly afterward, Norman is heard horrified at his mother's actions and rushes back to find Marion dead. He hurriedly cleans up the murder scene and places Marion's body, her belongings, and, unbeknownst to him, the hidden cash in her car, before sinking the vehicle in a swamp.\nMarion's sister, Lila, arrives in Fairvale a week later, tells Sam about the theft and demands information about Marion's whereabouts. He denies knowing anything about Marion's disappearance. A private investigator named Arbogast approaches them, stating that he has been hired to retrieve the money. He stops in at the Bates Motel and questions Norman, whose nervous conduct, stuttering, and inconsistent answers arouse his suspicion. Arbogast examines the guest register and discovers from some handwriting in it that Marion spent a night in the motel. When Arbogast infers from things Norman says that Marion had spoken to his mother, Arbogast asks to speak to her, but Norman refuses to allow it. Arbogast leaves, finds a pay phone, and calls Lila to tell her of his suspicions and that he will go back to the motel, speak to Norman's mother, and rejoin Lila in town later. When Arbogast returns and enters the Bates' house to search for Norman's mother, a shadowy figure at the top of the stairs ambushes him and slashes him around the head. He tumbles down the stairs as the figure stabs him repeatedly.\nWhen Sam and Lila do not hear back from Arbogast, Sam goes to the motel to look for him. Sam spots a silhouette in the house who he assumes is Norman's mother, who is unresponsive to Sam's calls. Lila and Sam alert the local sheriff, Al Chambers, who tells them Norman's mother died in a murder\u2013suicide by strychnine poisoning ten years before. Chambers suggests that Arbogast lied to Sam and Lila so he could pursue Marion and the money.\nConvinced that something happened to Arbogast, Lila and Sam drive to the motel and check in. Sam distracts Norman in the office while Lila sneaks into the Bates' house. Suspicious, Norman knocks Sam out. As Norman heads to the house, Lila hides in the fruit cellar, where she discovers the mummified body of Norman's mother. Lila screams in horror, and Norman, wearing women's clothes and a wig, enters the cellar and attempts to attack her, only to be subdued by a recovered Sam.\nAt the police station, a psychiatrist explains to Lila, Sam, and Chambers that Norman killed his mother and her lover out of jealousy. Unable to bear the guilt, he stole his mother's corpse and treated it as if she were still alive, then re-created his mother as an alternate personality, as jealous and possessive toward Norman as he felt about his mother. Whenever Norman was attracted to a woman, \"Mother\" would take over. Under the \"Mother\" personality, Norman killed two women before he killed Marion and Arbogast. The psychiatrist concludes that \"Mother\" has now completely submerged Norman's personality. Norman sits in a jail cell and hears his mother's voice stating the murders were his doing. Meanwhile, Marion's car, which contains her remains and the stolen money, is pulled from the swamp.\nCast.\nVirginia Gregg, Paul Jasmin and Jeanette Nolan make uncredited appearances as the voice of Norma \"Mother\" Bates. The three voices were used interchangeably, except for the speech in the final scene, which was performed entirely by Gregg.\nProduction.\nDevelopment.\n\"Psycho\" is based on Robert Bloch's 1959 novel of the same name, loosely inspired by the case of convicted Wisconsin murderer and grave robber Ed Gein. Both Gein and the story's protagonist were solitary murderers in isolated rural locations. Each had deceased, domineering mothers, had sealed off a room in their home as a shrine to them. While Bates dressed in women's clothes, Gein dressed in the skins of the women he dug up. Gein was apprehended after killing only twice.\nPeggy Robertson, Hitchcock's long-time assistant, read Anthony Boucher's positive review of the novel in his \"Criminals at Large\" column in \"The New York Times\" and decided to show the book to her employer; however, studio readers at Paramount Pictures had already rejected its premise for a film. Hitchcock acquired rights to the novel for $9,500 and reportedly ordered Robertson to buy all copies to preserve the novel's surprises. Hitchcock, who had come to face genre competitors whose works were critically compared to his own, was seeking new material to recover from two aborted projects with Paramount: \"Flamingo Feather\" and \"No Bail for the Judge\". He disliked stars' salary demands and trusted only a few people to choose prospective material, including Robertson.\nParamount executives balked at Hitchcock's proposal and refused to provide his usual budget. In response, Hitchcock offered to film \"Psycho\" quickly and cheaply in black and white using the crew from his television series \"Alfred Hitchcock Presents\". Paramount executives rejected this cost-conscious approach, claiming their soundstages were booked, but the industry was in a slump. Hitchcock countered that he personally would finance the project and film it at Universal-International using his Shamley Productions crew if Paramount would distribute. In lieu of his usual $250,000 director's fee, he proposed a 60% stake in the film negative. This combined offer was accepted, and Hitchcock went ahead in spite of naysaying from producer Herbert Coleman and Shamley Productions executive Joan Harrison.\nScreenplay.\nJames P. Cavanagh, a writer on \"Alfred Hitchcock Presents\", wrote the first draft of the screenplay. Hitchcock felt the script dragged and read like a television short horror story, an assessment shared by an assistant. Although Joseph Stefano had worked on only one film before, Hitchcock agreed to meet with him; despite Stefano's inexperience, the meeting went well and he was hired.\nThe screenplay is relatively faithful to the novel, with a few significant changes by Hitchcock and Stefano. Stefano found the character of Norman Bates unsympathetic\u2014in the book, he is middle-aged, overweight and more overtly unstable\u2014but became more intrigued when Hitchcock suggested casting Anthony Perkins. Stefano eliminated Bates' alcoholism, which necessitated removing Bates' \"becoming\" the mother personality when in a drunken stupor. Also removed was Bates' interest in spiritualism, the occult and pornography. Hitchcock and Stefano elected to open the film with scenes in Marion's life and not introduce Bates at all until the twenty-minute mark, rather than open with Bates reading a history book as Bloch does. Writer Joseph W. Smith observes that Marion's story \"occupies only two of the novel's 17 chapters. Hitchcock and Stefano expanded this to nearly half the narrative\".\nSmith likewise mentions the absence of a hotel tryst between Marion and Sam in the novel. For Stefano, the conversation between Marion and Norman in the hotel parlor in which she displays maternal sympathy towards him makes it possible for the audience to switch their sympathies towards Norman after Marion's murder. When Lila is looking through Norman's bedroom in the film, she opens a book with a blank cover whose contents are unseen; in the novel, these are \"pathologically pornographic\" illustrations. Stefano wanted to give the audience \"indications that something was quite wrong, but it could not be spelled out or overdone\". In his book of conversations with Hitchcock, Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut says the novel \"cheats\" by having extended conversations between Norman and \"Mother\" and stating what Mother is \"doing\" at various given moments.\nThe first name of the female protagonist was changed from Mary to Marion because a real Mary Crane lived in Phoenix. Also changed is the novel's budding romance between Sam and Lila. Hitchcock preferred to focus the audience's attention on the solution to the mystery, and Stefano thought such a relationship would make Sam seem cheap. Instead of having Sam explain Norman's pathology to Lila, the film uses a psychiatrist. Stefano was in therapy dealing with his relationship with his own mother while writing the script. The novel is more violent than the film: Marion is decapitated in the shower rather than being stabbed to death. Minor changes include changing Marion's telltale earring found after her death to a scrap of paper that failed to flush down the toilet. This provided some shock effect because toilets were almost never seen in American cinema at the time of the film's release. The location of Arbogast's death was moved from the house's foyer to the stairwell. Stefano thought this would make it easier to conceal the truth about \"Mother\" without tipping that something was being hidden. As Leigh put it, this gave Hitchcock more options for his camera.\nPre-production.\nParamount Pictures, whose contract guaranteed another film by Hitchcock, did not want Hitchcock to make \"Psycho\". Paramount was expecting \"No Bail for the Judge\", but Hitchcock scrapped the production after star Audrey Hepburn became pregnant and bowed out. The studio's official stance was that Bloch's book was \"too repulsive\" and \"impossible for films\", and nothing but another of Hitchcock's star-studded mystery thrillers would suffice. Paramount did not like \"anything about [the book] at all\" and denied Hitchcock his usual budget.\nIn response, Hitchcock financed the film's creation through his own Shamley Productions, shooting at Universal Studios under the Revue television unit. The original Bates Motel and Bates house set buildings, which were constructed on the same stage as Lon Chaney's \"The Phantom of the Opera\" (1925), are still standing at the Universal Studios backlot in Universal City near Hollywood and are a regular attraction on the studio's tour.\nAs a further result of cost-cutting, Hitchcock chose to film \"Psycho\" in black-and-white, keeping the budget under $1 million. Among other reasons for shooting in black-and-white were Hitchcock's desire to prevent the shower scene from being too gory.\nAs a further cost-cutting measure, and because he was most comfortable around them, Hitchcock took most of his crew from his television series \"Alfred Hitchcock Presents\", including cinematographer John L. Russell, art directors Robert Clatworthy and Joseph Hurley, set decorator George Milo, script supervisor Marshall Schlom and assistant director Hilton A. Green. He hired regular collaborators Bernard Herrmann as the music composer, George Tomasini as editor, and Saul Bass for the title design and storyboarding of the shower scene. In all, his crew cost $62,000.\nThrough the strength of his reputation, Hitchcock cast Leigh for a quarter of her usual fee, paying only $25,000 (in the 1967 book \"Hitchcock/Truffaut\", Hitchcock said that Leigh owed Paramount one final film on her seven-year contract which she had signed in 1953). His first choice, Leigh agreed having only read the novel and making no inquiry into her salary. Her co-star, Anthony Perkins, agreed to $40,000. Both stars were experienced and proven box-office draws.\nParamount distributed the film, but four years later Hitchcock sold his stock in Shamley to Universal's parent company, MCA, and his remaining six films were made at and distributed by Universal Pictures. After another four years, Paramount sold all rights to Universal.\nFilming.\n\"Psycho\", independently produced and financed by Hitchcock, was shot at Revue Studios, the same location as his television show. The film was shot on a tight budget of $807,000, beginning on November 11, 1959, and ending on February 1, 1960. Filming started in the morning and finished by six\u00a0p.m. or earlier on Thursdays (when Hitchcock and his wife would dine at Chasen's). Nearly the whole film was shot with 50\u00a0mm lenses on 35\u00a0mm cameras. This provided an angle of view similar to human vision, which helped to further involve the audience.\nBefore shooting began in November, Hitchcock dispatched Green to Phoenix to scout locations and shoot the opening scene. The shot was supposed to be an aerial shot of Phoenix that slowly zoomed into the hotel window of a passionate Marion and Sam. Ultimately, the helicopter footage proved too shaky and had to be spliced with footage from the studio. Another crew filmed day and night footage on Highway 99 between Gorman and Fresno, California, for projection when Marion drives from Phoenix. Footage of her driving into Bakersfield to trade her car is also shown. They also provided the location shots for the scene in which Marion is discovered sleeping in her car by the suspicious policeman. In one street scene shot in downtown Phoenix, Christmas decorations were discovered to be visible; rather than re-shoot the footage, Hitchcock chose to add onscreen text to the opening scene marking the date as \"Friday, December the Eleventh\".\nGreen also took photos of a prepared list of 140 locations for later reconstruction in the studio. These included many real estate offices and homes such as those belonging to Marion and her sister. He also found a girl who looked just as he imagined Marion and photographed her whole wardrobe, which would enable Hitchcock to demand realistic looks from Helen Colvig, the wardrobe supervisor. The look of the Bates house was modeled on Edward Hopper's painting \"House by the Railroad\", a fanciful portrait of the Second Empire Victorian home at 18 Conger Avenue in Haverstraw, New York.\nLead actors Perkins and Leigh were given the freedom to interpret their roles and improvise as long as it did not involve moving the camera. An example of Perkins' improvisation is Norman's habit of eating candy corn. Throughout filming, Hitchcock created and hid various versions of the \"Mother corpse\" prop in Leigh's dressing room closet. Leigh took the joke well, and wondered whether it was done to keep her in suspense or to judge which corpse would be scarier for the audience.\nHitchcock was forced uncharacteristically to do retakes for some scenes. The final shot in the shower scene, which starts with an extreme close-up on Marion's eye and zooms in and out, proved difficult for Leigh because the water splashing in her eyes made her want to blink, and the cameraman had trouble as well because he had to manually focus while moving the camera. Retakes were required for the opening scene because Hitchcock felt that Leigh and Gavin were not passionate enough. Leigh had trouble saying, \"Not inordinately\" for the real estate office scene, requiring additional retakes. Lastly, the scene in which \"Mother\" is discovered required complicated coordination of the chair turning around, Vera Miles (as Lila) hitting the light bulb and a lens flare, which proved to be difficult. Hitchcock forced retakes until all three elements were effected to his satisfaction.\nAccording to Hitchcock, a series of shots with Arbogast going up the stairs in the Bates house before he is stabbed were directed by Green based on Bass' storyboards while Hitchcock was incapacitated by the common cold. However, upon viewing the dailies of the shots, Hitchcock was forced to scrap them. He claimed they were \"no good\" because they did not portray \"an innocent person but a sinister man who was going up those stairs\". Hitchcock later re-shot the scene, though a little of the cut footage made its way into the film. Filming the murder of Arbogast proved problematic, owing to the overhead camera angle necessary to hide the film's twist. A camera track constructed on pulleys alongside the stairway together with a chair-like device had to be constructed and thoroughly tested over a period of weeks.\nAlfred Hitchcock's cameo is a signature occurrence in most of his films. In \"Psycho\", he can be seen through a window\u2014wearing a Stetson hat\u2014standing outside Marion's workplace. Wardrobe mistress Rita Riggs has said that Hitchcock chose this scene for his cameo so that he could be in a scene with his daughter, who played one of Marion's colleagues. Others have suggested that he chose this early appearance in the film to avoid distracting the audience.\nThe murder of Leigh's character in the shower is the film's pivotal scene and one of the best-known in all of cinema. As such, it spawned numerous myths and legends. The scene was shot from December 17\u201323, 1959, after Leigh had twice postponed the filming, first because of a cold and then because of her menstrual period. The finished scene runs some three minutes, and its production has resulted in several myths and stories. These include claims from Bass about credit and varying misconceptions about Leigh's filming experience.\nSoundtrack.\nScore.\nHitchcock insisted that Bernard Herrmann write the score for \"Psycho\" despite the composer's refusal to accept a reduced fee for the film's lower budget. The resulting score, according to Christopher Palmer in \"The Composer in Hollywood\" (1990) is \"perhaps Herrmann's most spectacular Hitchcock achievement\". Hitchcock was pleased with the tension and drama the score added to the film, later remarking \"33% of the effect of \"Psycho\" was due to the music\" and that \"\"Psycho\" depended heavily on Herrmann's music for its tension and sense of pervading doom\".\nHerrmann used the lowered music budget to his advantage by writing for a string orchestra rather than a full symphonic ensemble, contrary to Hitchcock's request for a jazz score. He thought of the single-tone color of the all-string soundtrack as a way of reflecting the black-and-white cinematography of the film. The strings play \"con sordini\" (muted) for all the music other than the shower scene, creating a darker and more intense effect. Film composer Fred Steiner, in an analysis of the score to \"Psycho\", points out that string instruments gave Herrmann access to a wider range in tone, dynamics, and instrumental special effects than any other single instrumental group would have.\nThe main title music, a tense, hurtling piece, sets the tone of impending violence and returns three times on the soundtrack. Though nothing shocking occurs during the first 15\u201320 minutes of the film, the title music remains in the audience's mind, lending tension to these early scenes. Herrmann also maintains tension through the slower moments in the film through the use of ostinato.\nIn 1968 Herrmann reworked his original score into a concert piece named \"Psycho: A Narrative for String Orchestra\", which he recorded with the London Philharmonic Orchestra the following year. Most of the suite, which included new music, subsequently went missing. In 1999, the conductor John Mauceri, with the help of Herrmann's widow, reconstructed the suite and edited it for publication. He produced a second edition in 2013 that restored Herrmann's notated string bowings.\nTo honor the fiftieth anniversary of \"Psycho\", in July 2010, the San Francisco Symphony had a print of the film created with the music removed from the soundtrack and projected it on a large screen in Davies Symphony Hall, while the orchestra performed the score live. This was previously mounted by the Seattle Symphony in October 2009 as well, performing at the Benaroya Hall for two consecutive evenings. There have subsequently been other screenings of the film with live orchestras playing the score, including three New York Philharmonic presentations in October/November 2025, with one screening/performance on Halloween night.\nRecordings.\nSeveral albums of the film score have been released, including:\nCensorship and taboos.\n\"Psycho\" is a prime example of the type of film that appeared in the United States during the 1960s after the erosion of the Production Code. It was unprecedented in its depiction of sexuality and violence, right from the opening scene in which Sam and Marion are shown as lovers sharing a bed, with Marion in a bra. In the Production Code standards of that time, unmarried couples shown in the same bed would have been taboo.\nAnother issue was the gender nonconformity. Perkins, who was allegedly homosexual, and Hitchcock, who previously made \"Rope\", were both experienced in the film's transgressive subject matter. The viewer is unaware of Bates's crossdressing until, at the end of the film, it is revealed during the attempted murder of Lila. At the station, Sam asks why Bates was dressed that way. The police officer, ignorant of Bates's split personality, announces his conclusion that Bates is a transvestite. The psychiatrist corrects him and explains that Bates believes that he is his own mother when he dresses in her clothes.\nThe shower scene was notably affected by the censorship. Another cause of concern for the censors was that Marion was shown flushing a toilet, with its contents (torn-up note paper) fully visible. No flushing toilet had appeared in mainstream film and television in the United States at that time. The British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) required cuts to stabbing sounds and visible nude shots, and in New Zealand the shot of Norman washing blood from his hands was seen as disgusting. In Singapore, though the shower scene was left untouched, the murder of Arbogast and a shot of Norman's mother's corpse were removed. In Ireland, censor Gerry O'Hara banned it upon his initial viewing in 1960. The next year, a highly edited version missing some 47 feet of film was submitted to the Irish censor. O'Hara ultimately requested that an additional seven cuts be made: the line where Marion tells Sam to put his shoes on (which implied that he had his pants or trousers off), two shots of Norman spying on Marion through the hole in the wall, Marion's undressing, the shots of Marion's blood flowing down the shower, the shots of Norman washing his hands when blood is visible, repeated incidents of stabbings (\"One stab is surely enough\", wrote O'Hara), the words \"in bed\" from the sheriff's wife's line, \"Norman found them dead together in bed\", and Arbogast's questions to Norman about whether he spent the night with Marion. In 1986, the uncut version of \"Psycho\" was accepted by the BBFC, which classified it at 15. \nIn 2020, Universal Pictures released the uncut version of the film on Blu-ray for the first time to coincide with its 60th anniversary.\nRelease.\nThe film was released on June 16, 1960, at the DeMille Theatre and the Baronet Theatre in New York City. It was the first film sold in the US on the basis that no one would be admitted to the theater after the film had started.\nHitchcock's \"no late admission\" policy for the film was unusual for the time. It was not an entirely original publicity strategy as Clouzot had done the same in France for \"Les Diaboliques\" (1955). Hitchcock believed people who entered the theater late and thus never saw the appearance of star actress Janet Leigh would feel cheated. At first theater owners opposed the idea, thinking they would lose business. However, after the first day, the owners enjoyed long lines of people waiting to see the film. Shortly before the release of \"Psycho\", Hitchcock promised a film in \"the \"Diabolique\" manner\".\nThe week after the New York premiere, the film opened at the Paramount Theatre, Boston; the Woods Theatre, Chicago, and the Arcadia Theatre, Philadelphia. After nine weeks of release at the DeMille and the Baronet, the film was released in neighborhood New York theaters, the first time a film had played on Broadway and the neighborhood theaters simultaneously.\nPromotion.\nHitchcock did most of the promotion himself, forbidding Leigh and Perkins to make the usual television, radio, and print interviews for fear of them revealing the plot. Even critics were not given private screenings but rather had to see the film with the general public, which may have affected their reviews.\nThe film's original trailer features a jovial Hitchcock taking the viewer on a tour of the set and almost giving away plot details before stopping himself. It is \"tracked\" with Herrmann's \"Psycho\" theme, but also jovial music from Hitchcock's comedy \"The Trouble with Harry\"; most of Hitchcock's dialogue is post-synchronized. The trailer features Vera Miles with a blonde wig in place of Leigh, as she was no longer available for filming at the time.\nRating.\n\"Psycho\" has been rated and re-rated several times over the years by the MPAA. Upon its initial release, the film received a certificate stating that it was \"Approved\" (certificate #19564) under the simple pass/fail system of the Production Code in use at that time. Later, when the MPAA switched to a voluntary letter ratings system in 1968, \"Psycho\" was one of a number of high-profile motion pictures to be retro-rated with an \"M\" (Suggested for mature audiences: Parental discretion advised) for further distribution. This remained the only rating the film would receive for 16 years, and according to the guidelines of the time \"M\" was the equivalent of a \"PG\" rating. In 1984, amidst a controversy surrounding the levels of violence depicted in \"PG\"-rated films in the VCR era, the film was re-classified to its current rating of \"R\".\nRe-release.\nThe film had another successful theatrical reissue in 1969. The film was re-released to cinemas on September 20 and 23, 2015, as part of the \"TCM Presents\" series by Turner Classic Movies and Fathom Events.\nTelevision.\nCBS purchased the television rights for $450,000. CBS planned to televise the film on September 23, 1966, as an installment of its new movie night \"The CBS Friday Night Movies\". Three days prior to the scheduled telecast, Valerie Percy, daughter of Illinois senate candidate Charles H. Percy, was murdered. As her parents slept mere feet away, she was stabbed a dozen times with a double-edged knife. In light of the murder, CBS agreed to postpone the broadcast. As a result of the Apollo 1 fire on January 27, 1967, the network again postponed the screening of \"Psycho\".\nShortly afterward Paramount included the film in its first syndicated package of post-1950 movies, \"Portfolio I\". WABC-TV in New York City was the first station in the country to air \"Psycho\" (with some scenes significantly edited), on its late-night movie series, \"The Best of Broadway\", on June 24, 1967.\nThe film finally made its way to general television broadcast in one of Universal's syndicated programming packages for local stations in 1970. \"Psycho\" was aired for 20 years in this format, then leased to cable for two years before returning to syndication as part of the \"List of a Lifetime\" package.\nHome media.\nThe film has been released several times on CED, VHS, LaserDisc, DVD and Blu-ray. DiscoVision first released \"Psycho\" on the LaserDisc format in \"standard play\" (five sides) in 1979, and \"extended play\" (two sides) in October 1981. MCA/Universal Home Video released a new LaserDisc version of \"Psycho\" in August 1988 (Catalog #: 11003). In May 1998, Universal Studios Home Video released a deluxe edition of \"Psycho\" as part of their Signature Collection. This THX-certified Widescreen (1.85:1) LaserDisc Deluxe Edition (Catalog #: 43105) is spread across four extended-play sides and one standard-play side, and includes a new documentary and isolated Bernard Herrmann score. A DVD edition was released at the same time as the LaserDisc.\nA version of the film with extended footage of Marion undressing (showing her taking off her bra), Norman cleaning up after the murder, and Arbogast's death (in which he is stabbed four times instead of two) has been shown on German TV, and was released there on Blu-ray in 2015. This footage may have been cut from the US version of the film in 1968 before the re-release of the movie after the ratings system was first established by the MPAA; these cuts were mandated by the National Legion of Decency.\nFor the DVD release, Laurent Bouzereau produced a documentary looking at the film's production and reception. Universal released a 50th anniversary edition on Blu-ray in the United Kingdom on August 9, 2010, with Australia making the same edition (with a different cover) available on September 1. To mark the film's 50th anniversary, a Blu-ray in the U.S. was released on October 19, 2010, featuring yet another cover. The film is also included on two different Alfred Hitchcock Blu-ray box-sets from Universal.\nThe film was released on 4K UHD Blu-Ray as part of The Alfred Hitchcock Classics Collection in September 2020, along with an individual \"60th anniversary\" Blu-Ray release as well. This release includes the extended footage from the German release, making it the first time that these scenes were presented to US home video audiences as Hitchcock intended.\nReception.\nCritical reception.\nImmediate reviews and reactions from critics were extremely polarized. Bosley Crowther of \"The New York Times\" wrote: \"There is not an abundance of subtlety or the lately familiar Hitchcock bent toward significant and colorful scenery in this obviously low-budget job\". Crowther called the \"slow buildups to sudden shocks\" reliably melodramatic but contested Hitchcock's psychological points, reminiscent of Krafft-Ebing's studies, as less effective. While the film did not conclude satisfactorily for the critic, he commended the cast's performances as \"fair\". British critic C. A. Lejeune was so offended that she not only walked out before the end, but permanently resigned her post as film critic for \"The Observer\". Other negative reviews stated, \"a blot on an honorable career\", \"plainly a gimmick movie\", and \"merely one of those television shows padded out to two hours\". The Catholic Legion of Decency gave the film a B rating, meaning \"morally objectionable in part\".\nCritics from other New York newspapers, such as the \"Daily News\", \"Daily Mirror\", and \"Village Voice\" were positive, writing: \"Anthony Perkins' performance is the best of his career\u00a0... Janet Leigh has never been better\", \"played out beautifully\", and \"first American movie since \"Touch of Evil\" (1958) to stand in the same creative rank as the great European films\", respectively. A mixed review from the \"New York Herald Tribune\" stated it was \"rather difficult to be amused at the forms insanity may take [but nonetheless] keeps your attention like a snake-charmer\". The \"Los Angeles Times\"' Philip K. Scheuer remarked, in another mixed review, that the film was \"one of his most brilliantly directed shockers and also his most disagreeable\". The film ranked ninth on \"Cahiers du Cin\u00e9ma\"'s Top 10 Films of the Year List in 1960.\nIt was also well received in Florida, where the \"Miami Herald\"'s Jack Anderson wrote that \"the pudgy master of suspense has dished up a real shocker. And I mean shocker. \"Psycho\" saws away at every nerve right from its first scene with Janet Leigh in her unmentionables to its last gruesome moment\". Robin Barrett of the \"St. Petersburg Times\" wrote that \"it's got all the ingredients of a typical Hitchcock if Hitchcock can be termed in any way \"typical\", and it's definitely his best effort to date, but it's unlike anything he's done in the past. Mr. H. has pledged us not to reveal the shocking ending or talk about the bizarre plot and shaking fear of diabolical Hitchcock reprisals \u2014 we won't\".\nThe film opened to a slightly more muted phrase in Washington, D.C.. Richard L. Coe of \"The Washington Post\" called it \"marvelously gruesome [...] the sort of eerie, creaky, gobby Snap-Apple-Night that will find many sharooshed and others liverish\". Harry MacArthur of Washington \"Evening Star\" wrote that \"Alfred Hitchcock lets his well-known glee with the gruesome romp all over the place in \"Psycho\", latest of his excursions in mayhem and suspense, at the Town Theater. This is a movie he might have made to prove the truth of his oft-quoted statement that he makes pictures for his own amusement. This does not mean, of course, that other moviegoers will not be amused\u2014or shocked or even scared out of their wit by \"Psycho\". It does mean that this is a somewhat transparent example of the master's work in that you can see him sitting there behind it fiendishly dreaming up shocking situations for the sake of shock alone\". Don Maclean of \"The Washington Daily News\" urged the reader to \"go see it if you like movies that shake you up. But if you're afraid to go in your house afterwards and keep watching behind you the rest of the night, don't blame me\".\nA critic who used the Mae Tinee pseudonym in the \"Chicago Daily Tribune\" wrote that \"the old pro really poured it on in this production. I'm sure the wily Mr. Hitchcock had fun making this one. He used his camera with a sharp skill to achieve shock value the staring eye, the flowing blood, the sudden plunge of a knife. Audiences react much as they do on a high ride, giggling with nerves and excitement\". In Buffalo, Jeanette Eichel of the \"Buffalo Evening News\" remarked that \"Alfred Hitchcock, master of mystery, fuses fear and suspense in his shiver-and-shock show \"Psycho\" in the Paramount Theater. His pride is that he does not let an audience down by misleading it. His clues are honest and few persons guess the outcome. He especially asked in an epilogue that patrons not betray the ending\".\nA more mixed review came courtesy of Marjory Adams of the \"Boston Daily Globe\", who wrote that it \"is far more macabre and mysterious than any of his previous full-length features. However, the settings are dreary and lack those magnificent backgrounds which Hitchcock employed so effectively in \"North by Northwest\", \"Vertigo\" and \"To Catch a Thief\". Perhaps the old mystery master has been more influenced in \"Psycho\" by his television programs than by his own classics such as \"39 Steps\" and \"Notorious\". However, he gives the audience its money's worth. You see two murders committed, with accompanying gore and grisly details. There are so many shocks the theater might be connected to an electric battery\".\nHelen Bower of the \"Detroit Free Press\" was appalled by the film, opening her article by writing: \"Gee, whiz, Mr. Hitchcock! Stick to making pictures like \"North by Northwest\", instead of one like \"Psycho\" at the Palms Theater, will you, huh? So okay, \"Psycho\" gets some nervous laughter and a couple of yips of shock from the audience. But when even the great Hitchcock tries to make visual the dark side of star Anthony Perkin's psychopathic personality, the effect is ridiculous. Perhaps the get-up would be the only thing a young man in Perkins' state of mind could produce. All the same, it makes this phase of Hitch's horror movie look laughably corny\". Glenn C. Pullen of the \"Cleveland Plain Dealer\" praised the performances of Leigh and Perkins, opening his review by writing that \"if the movie theater business has any ills, according to 'Doctor' Alfred Hitchcock's diagnosis, they can be cured promptly by some blood-letting horrors, a healthy shot of mystery juice, and a chilling bath in bizarre melodrama. This whimsical prescription by the old master of suspense films again proved to be eminently correct in the case of his long-heralded \"Psycho\"\". Francis Melrose of the \"Rocky Mountain News\" praised Leigh's and Perkins' performances and called the film \"a shocker that hits you like a pile driver. You most likely will be stunned and reeling as you come out of the theater\".\nIn the United Kingdom, the film broke attendance records at the London Plaza Cinema, but nearly all British film critics gave it poor reviews, questioning Hitchcock's taste and judgment and calling it his worst film ever. Reasons cited for this were the lack of preview screenings; the fact that they had to turn up at a set time as they would not be admitted after the film had started; their dislike of the gimmicky promotion; and Hitchcock's expatriate status. Alexander Walker of the London \"Evening Standard\" wrote that \"Alfred Hitchcock may at any time try to frighten me to death, and welcome to him. But I draw the line at being bored to death. There were moments in \"Psycho\" when I thought he had almost succeeded. Quite an achievement, when you consider the stomach-turning contents of this nasty essay into horror by the master of suspense. \"Psycho\" is the grisly story of multiple murders at a lonely motel on the edge of Arizona swamp land. Hitchcock has laid the film out like a morbid morgue attendant. His eye for corpses has never been as wide open, nor his sense of bizarre death sharper. But what nauseates one is his sick relish of anything in it that is perverted or blood-spattered. And much is\". Dick Richards of the \"Daily Mirror\" called it \"a fairly ordinary, sometimes ridiculous melodrama\".\nJack Bentley of the \"Sunday Mirror\" wrote that \"Alfred Hitchcock, the 'master of suspense', has sadly underestimated the intelligence of his audience in presenting this gory story about a homicidal maniac. For his publicity department's entreaties to cinemagoers not to reveal the ending is totally unnecessary. I soon tumbled to it\u2014and so will you. There are, however, excellent performances from Vera Miles, Janet Leigh and, in particular, Anthony Perkins\". Ernest Betts of the \"Sunday People\" called it a \"mad, morbid and monstrous film [in which] Hitchcock mixes old-fashioned hokum and the jargon of the psychiatrist to stretch your nerves to screaming point\". In a scathing observation, Frank Lewis of the \"Sunday Dispatch\" told viewers to \"ignore those pleas to keep the ending secret. Anyone above the mental age of 10 will know, only too well, what's coming\".\nA critic in \"The Daily Telegraph\" who only gave the initials of R.P.M.G. wrote that the film was \"for this director, a disappointing murder melodrama with more absurdities than thrills. It is out of the ordinary only in that it is a little unpleasant. The most rewarding feature is Anthony Perkins' study of the murderer suffering as the title foretells from psychological disorders. Janet Leigh also gives a pleasing performance as the girl he kills with a knife while she is under a shower\". A critic for the same newspaper, Patrick Gibbs, wrote that \"it almost seems as if the director were pulling our legs and by way of improving the joke he leads us up the garden path\u2014like Haydn in the 'Surprise Symphony'\u2014with some serious completely realistic opening passages typically full of tension and suspense\". C.A. Lejeune of \"The Observer\" wrote that \"the stupid air of mystery and portent surrounding \"Psycho\"'s presentation strikes me as a tremendous error. It makes the film automatically suspect\". However, an unidentified critic in \"The Guardian\", then based in Manchester, was somewhat more favorable in his reaction, saying that the film offered \"no more than quite a good sample of the old Hitchcock style, rich in suspense, tension, and the rest of it; and it is also typical in being brilliant in patches and, as a whole, quite implausible\".\nPauline Kael for \"The New Yorker\" wrote that it was one film that made her feel like it was \"borderline immoral\" because of what she saw as the \"director's cheerful complicity with the killer, he had a sadistic glee\" that she couldn't quite deal with. \nCritics later reassessed the film in a far more positive matter in the coming months after release. \"Time\" magazine switched its opinion from \"Hitchcock bears down too heavily in this one\" to \"superlative\" and \"masterly\", and Bosley Crowther changed his initial opinion and included it in his Top Ten list of 1960, deeming it a \"bold psychological mystery picture... [I]t represented expert and sophisticated command of emotional development with cinematic techniques\".\n\"Psycho\" was criticized for inspiring other filmmakers to show gory content; three years later, \"Blood Feast\", considered to be the first \"splatter film\", was released. Inspired by \"Psycho\", Hammer Film Productions launched a series of mystery thrillers including \"The Nanny\" (1965) starring Bette Davis and William Castle's \"Homicidal\" (1961) was followed by a slew of more than thirteen other splatter films.\nModern reviews have been overwhelmingly positive. On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, \"Psycho\" has an approval rating of 97% based on 118 reviews, with an average score of 9.3/10. The site's critical consensus reads: \"Infamous for its shower scene, but immortal for its contribution to the horror genre. Because \"Psycho\" was filmed with tact, grace, and art, Hitchcock didn't just create modern horror, he validated it\". On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 97 out of 100 based on 18 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\". In his 1998 review of \"Psycho\" film critic Roger Ebert summarised the film's enduring appeal, writing: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;What makes \"Psycho\" immortal, when so many films are already half-forgotten as we leave the theater, is that it connects directly with our fears: Our fears that we might impulsively commit a crime, our fears of the police, our fears of becoming the victim of a madman, and of course our fears of disappointing our mothers.\nBox office.\nIn its opening week, \"Psycho\" grossed $46,500 at the DeMille and a record $19,500 at the Baronet. Following its expansion the following week, it grossed $143,000 from 5 theaters. \"Psycho\" broke box-office records in Japan and the rest of Asia, France, Britain, South America, the United States, and Canada, and was a moderate success in Australia for a brief period.\nIt went on to become the second highest-grossing film of 1960, behind \"Spartacus\", earning a box office gross of $32\u00a0million, which generated approximately $9.1\u00a0million in North American theatrical rentals. \"Psycho\" remains the most commercially successful film of Hitchcock's career. Hitchcock personally earned in excess of $15\u00a0million from \"Psycho\". He then swapped his rights to \"Psycho\" and his TV anthology for 150,000 shares of MCA, making him the third largest shareholder in MCA Inc., and his own boss at Universal, in theory; this did not stop them from interfering with his later films.\nAccolades.\nIn 1992, the film was deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" by the United States Library of Congress and was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry. In 1998, \"TV Guide\" ranked it No. 8 on their list of the 50 Greatest Movies on TV (and Video).\n\"Psycho\" has appeared on a number of lists by websites, television channels, and magazines. The shower scene was featured as number four on the list of Bravo Network's 100 Scariest Movie Moments, while the finale was ranked number four on \"Premiere\"'s similar list. In the British Film Institute's 2012 \"Sight &amp; Sound\" polls of the greatest films ever made, \"Psycho\" was 35th among critics and 48th among directors.\nIn the earlier 2002 version of the list the film ranked 35th among critics and 19th among directors. In the 2022 edition of BFI's \"Greatest films of all time\" list the film ranked 31st in the critics poll and 46th in the director's poll. In 1998 \"Time Out\" conducted a reader's poll and \"Psycho\" was voted the 29th greatest film of all time. \"The Village Voice\" ranked \"Psycho\" at No. 19 in its Top 250 \"Best Films of the Century\" list in 1999, based on a poll of critics. The film was listed as one of TCM's top 15 most influential films of all-time list.\n\"Entertainment Weekly\" voted it the 11th Greatest film of all time in 1999. In January 2002, the film was included on the list of the \"Top 100 Essential Films of All Time\" by the National Society of Film Critics. The film was included in \"Time\"'s All-Time 100 best movies list in 2005. In 2005, \"Total Film\" magazine ranked \"Psycho\" as the 6th-greatest horror film of all time. In 2010, \"The Guardian\" newspaper ranked it as \"the best horror film of all time\". Director Martin Scorsese included \"Psycho\" in his list of the 11 scariest horror films of all time. The film was named as the third best horror movie of all time in a readers' poll by \"Rolling Stone\" magazine in 2014. In 2017 Empire magazine's reader's poll ranked \"Psycho\" at No. 53 on its list of \"The 100 Greatest Movies\". In an earlier poll held by the same magazine in 2008, it was voted 45th on the list of \"The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time\". In 2021, the film was ranked at No. 5 by Time Out on their list of \"The 100 best horror movies\".\nIn 2012, the Motion Picture Editors Guild listed the film as the twelfth best-edited film of all time based on a survey of its membership. \"Psycho\" was ranked 8th in BBC's 2015 list of the 100 greatest American films. In 2022, Variety named \"Psycho\" the greatest movie of all time, and in 2024 as the third greatest horror film.\nAmerican Film Institute has included \"Psycho\" in these lists:\nThemes and style.\nSubversion of romance through irony.\nIn \"Psycho\", Hitchcock subverts the romantic elements that are seen in most of his work. The film is instead ironic as it presents \"clarity and fulfillment\" of romance. The past is central to the film; the main characters \"struggle to understand and resolve destructive personal histories\" and ultimately fail. Lesley Brill writes: \"The inexorable forces of past sins and mistakes crush hopes for regeneration and present happiness\". The crushed hope is highlighted by the death of the protagonist, Marion Crane, halfway through the film. Marion is like Persephone of Greek mythology, who is abducted temporarily from the world of the living. The myth does not sustain Marion, who dies hopelessly in her room at the Bates Motel. The room is wallpapered with floral prints like Persephone's flowers, but they are only \"reflected in mirrors, as images of images\u2014twice removed from reality\". In the scene of Marion's death, Brill describes the transition from the bathroom drain to Marion's lifeless eye, \"like the eye of the amorphous sea creature at the end of Fellini's \"La Dolce Vita\", it marks the birth of death, an emblem of final hopelessness and corruption\".\nMarion is deprived of \"the humble treasures of love, marriage, home and family\", which Hitchcock considers elements of human happiness. There exists among \"Psycho\"'s secondary characters a lack of \"familial warmth and stability\", which demonstrates the unlikelihood of domestic fantasies. The film contains ironic jokes about domesticity, such as when Sam writes a letter to Marion, agreeing to marry her, only after the audience sees her buried in the swamp. Sam and Marion's sister Lila, in investigating Marion's disappearance, develop an \"increasingly connubial\" relationship, a development that Marion is denied. Norman also suffers a similarly perverse definition of domesticity. He has \"an infantile and divided personality\" and lives in a mansion whose past occupies the present. Norman displays stuffed birds that are \"frozen in time\" and keeps childhood toys and stuffed animals in his room. He is hostile toward suggestions to move from the past, such as with Marion's suggestion to put his mother \"someplace\" and as a result kills Marion to preserve his past. Brill explains: \"'Someplace' for Norman is where his delusions of love, home, and family are declared invalid and exposed\".\nLight and darkness feature prominently in \"Psycho\". The first shot after the intertitle is the sunny landscape of Phoenix before the camera enters a dark hotel room where Sam and Marion appear as bright figures. Marion is almost immediately cast in darkness; she is preceded by her shadow as she reenters the office to steal money and as she enters her bedroom. When she flees Phoenix, darkness descends on her drive. The following sunny morning is punctured by a watchful police officer with black sunglasses, and she finally arrives at the Bates Motel in near darkness. Bright lights are also \"the ironic equivalent of darkness\" in the film, blinding instead of illuminating. Examples of brightness include the opening window shades in Sam's and Marion's hotel room, vehicle headlights at night, the neon sign at the Bates Motel, \"the glaring white\" of the bathroom tiles where Marion dies, and the fruit cellar's exposed light bulb shining on the corpse of Norman's mother. Such bright lights typically characterize danger and violence in Hitchcock's films.\nMotifs.\nThe film often features shadows, mirrors, windows, and, less so, water. The shadows are present from the first scene where the blinds make bars on Marion and Sam as they peer out of the window. The stuffed birds' shadows loom over Marion as she eats, and Norman's mother is seen in only shadows until the end. More subtly, backlighting turns the rakes in the hardware store into talons above Lila's head.\nMirrors reflect Marion as she packs, her eyes as she checks the rear-view mirror, her face in the policeman's sunglasses, and her hands as she counts out the money in the car dealership's bathroom. A motel window serves as a mirror by reflecting Marion and Norman together. Hitchcock shoots through Marion's windshield and the telephone booth when Arbogast phones Sam and Lila. The heavy downpour can be seen as a foreshadowing of the shower, and its cessation can be seen as a symbol of Marion making up her mind to return to Phoenix.\nThere are a number of references to birds. Norman's hobby is stuffing birds. Marion's last name is Crane and she is from Phoenix. (In the novel, Norman's hobby is taxidermy but it is not focused on birds, and Marion is from Dallas, Texas.) Norman comments that she eats like a bird. The motel room has pictures of birds on the wall. Brigitte Peucker also suggests that Norman's hobby of stuffing birds literalizes the British slang expression for sex, \"stuffing birds\", \"bird\" being British slang for a desirable woman. Robert Allan suggests that Norman's mother is his original \"stuffed bird\", both in the sense of having preserved her body and the incestuous nature of Norman's emotional bond with her.\nPsychoanalytic interpretation.\n\"Psycho\" has been called \"the first psychoanalytical thriller\". The sex and violence in the film were unlike anything previously seen in a mainstream film. French film critic Serge Kaganski wrote: \"The shower scene is both feared and desired. Hitchcock may be scaring his female viewers out of their wits, but he is turning his male viewers into potential rapists because Janet Leigh has been turning men on ever since she appeared in her brassiere in the first scene\".\nIn his documentary \"The Pervert's Guide to Cinema\", Slavoj \u017di\u017eek remarks that Norman Bates' mansion has three floors, paralleling the three levels of the human mind that are postulated by Freudian psychoanalysis: the top floor would be the superego, where Bates' mother lives; the ground floor is then Bates' ego, where he functions as an apparently normal human being; and the basement would be Bates' id. \u017di\u017eek interprets Bates' moving his mother's corpse from top floor to basement as a symbol for the deep connection that psychoanalysis posits between superego and id.\nFar Out Magazine named Perkins' role one of the \"10 most accurate movie psychopaths according to the FBI\".\nLegacy.\n\"Psycho\" has become one of the most recognizable films in cinema history, and is arguably Hitchcock's best known film. In his novel, Bloch used an uncommon plot structure: he repeatedly introduced sympathetic protagonists, then killed them off. This played on his reader's expectations of traditional plots, leaving them uncertain and anxious. Hitchcock recognized the effect this approach could have on audiences, and used it in his adaptation, killing off Leigh's character at the end of the first act. This daring plot device, coupled with the fact that the character was played by the biggest box-office name in the film, was a shocking turn of events in 1960. The shower scene become a pop culture touchstone and is often regarded as one of the most iconic moments in cinematic history, as well as the most suspenseful scene ever filmed.\n\"Psycho\" is considered by some to be the first film in the slasher film genre, though some critics and film historians point to Michael Powell's \"Peeping Tom\", a lesser-known film with similar themes of voyeurism and sexualized violence, whose release happened to precede \"Psycho\"'s by a few months. However, due to \"Peeping Tom\"'s critical drubbing at the time and short lifespan at the box office, \"Psycho\" was the more widely known and influential film.\nIn 2018, Zachary Paul of Bloody Disgusting said \"Psycho\" inspired subsequent horror films that had gender bender reveals, citing \"Terror Train\" (1980), \"Sleepaway Camp\" (1983), and the \"Insidious\" franchise (2011-) as examples. Paul criticized all these films for equating queerness with derangement but noted the makers of these films did not intend to offend anyone. Paul added \"The days of gender reveals posing as a big twist come the third act of any mystery or hack n' slash flick are likely numbered. The trope has certainly had its day in the sun, and it's best we all move on\".\n\"Psycho\" has been referenced in other films numerous times: examples include the 1974 musical comedy horror film \"Phantom of the Paradise\"; the 1978 horror film \"Halloween\" (which starred Jamie Lee Curtis, Janet Leigh's daughter, and which featured a character named Sam Loomis); the 1977 Mel Brooks tribute to many of Hitchcock's thrillers, \"High Anxiety\"; the 1980 \"Fade to Black\"; the 1980 \"Dressed to Kill\"; and Wes Craven's 1996 horror satire \"Scream\". Bernard Herrmann's opening theme has been sampled by rapper Busta Rhymes on his song \"Gimme Some More\" (1998). Manuel Mu\u00f1oz's 2011 novel \"What You See in the Dark\" includes a sub-plot that fictionalizes elements of the filming of \"Psycho\", referring to Hitchcock and Leigh only as \"The Director\" and \"The Actress\". In the comic book stories of Jonni Future, the house inherited by the title character is patterned after the Bates Motel. The film was played alongside \"The Shining\" at the drive-in theater as part of the Night of Horrors combo in the 1996 film \"Twister\". In the 2003 animated film \"Finding Nemo\", the \"Psycho\" theme song is played in reference to Dr. Sherman's niece Darla, whose pet fish are known to have died in her possession.\nThe film boosted Perkins' career, but he soon began to suffer from typecasting. When Perkins was asked whether he would have still taken the role knowing that he would be typecast afterwards, he said, \"Yes\". As Perkins was in New York working on a Broadway stage show when the shower sequence was filmed, actresses Anne Dore and Margo Epper stepped in as his body doubles for that scene. Until her death in 2004, Leigh received strange and sometimes threatening calls, letters, and even tapes detailing what the caller would like to do to Marion Crane. One letter was so \"grotesque\" that she passed it to the FBI. Two agents visited Leigh and told her the culprits had been located and that she should notify the FBI if she received any more letters of that type.\nLeigh said: \"No other murder mystery in the history of the movies has inspired such merchandising\". A number of items emblazoned with \"Bates Motel\", stills, lobby cards, and highly valuable posters are available for purchase. In 1992 Innovation Comics published a three-issue, shot-for-shot comics miniseries adaptation of the film. In 2010, Taylor Swift starred in a TV concert-documentary special that aired on NBC on Thanksgiving to promote her album \"Speak Now\". In the special, Swift and her band perform her song \"Haunted\" at the Bates haunted house during Universal's Halloween Horror Nights. The film was mentioned and a trademark of its soundtrack was also used in Billy Joel's song \"We Didn't Start the Fire\".\nSequels and remake.\nThree sequels were produced after Hitchcock died: \"Psycho II\" (1983), \"Psycho III\" (1986), and \"\" (1990), the last being a part-prequel television movie written by the original screenplay author, Joseph Stefano. Anthony Perkins returned to his role of Norman Bates in all three sequels, and directed the third film. The voice of Norman Bates' mother was maintained by noted radio actress Virginia Gregg with the exception of \"Psycho IV\", where the role was played by Olivia Hussey. Vera Miles also reprised her role of Lila Crane in \"Psycho II\". The sequels received mixed reviews and were universally considered inferior to the original.\nIn 1998, Gus Van Sant made a nearly shot-for-shot remake (in color) starring Vince Vaughn, Julianne Moore, and Anne Heche. Van Sant said that his film was \"a huge kind of experimental project\", and that, though it did not do well commercially or critically, he may do it again, with more changes.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;"}

Some of these terms are used interchangeably but strictly speaking, the \"suite\" is the definition of the communication protocols, and the \"stack\" is the software implementation of them.\nIndividual protocols within a suite are often designed with a single purpose in mind. This modularization simplifies design and evaluation. Because each protocol module usually communicates with two others, they are commonly imagined as layers in a stack of protocols. The lowest protocol always deals with low-level interaction with the communications hardware. Each higher layer adds additional capabilities. User applications usually deal only with the topmost layers.\nGeneral protocol suite description.\n T ~ ~ ~ T\n [A] [B]_____[C]\nImagine three computers: \"A\", \"B\", and \"C\". \"A\" and \"B\" both have radio equipment and can communicate via the airwaves using a suitable network protocol (such as IEEE 802.11). \"B\" and \"C\" are connected via a cable, using it to exchange data (again, with the help of a protocol, for example Point-to-Point Protocol). However, neither of these two protocols will be able to transport information from \"A\" to \"C\", because these computers are conceptually on different networks. An inter-network protocol is required to connect them.\nOne could combine the two protocols to form a powerful third, mastering both cable and wireless transmission, but a different super-protocol would be needed for each possible combination of protocols. It is easier to leave the base protocols alone and design a protocol that can work on top of any of them (the Internet Protocol is an example). This will make two stacks of two protocols each. The inter-network protocol will communicate with each of the base protocols in their simpler language; the base protocols will not talk directly to each other.\nA request on computer \"A\" to send a chunk of data to \"C\" is taken by the upper protocol, which (through whatever means) knows that \"C\" is reachable through \"B\". It, therefore, instructs the wireless protocol to transmit the data packet to \"B\". On this computer, the lower layer handlers will pass the packet up to the inter-network protocol, which, on recognizing that \"B\" is not the final destination, will again invoke lower-level functions. This time, the cable protocol is used to send the data to \"C\". There, the received packet is again passed to the upper protocol, which (with \"C\" being the destination) will pass it on to a higher protocol or application on \"C\".\nIn practical implementation, protocol stacks are often divided into three major sections: media, transport, and applications. A particular operating system or platform will often have two well-defined software interfaces: one between the media and transport layers, and one between the transport layers and applications. The media-to-transport interface defines how transport protocol software makes use of particular media and hardware types and is associated with a device driver. For example, this interface level would define how TCP/IP transport software would talk to the network interface controller. Examples of these interfaces include ODI and NDIS in the Microsoft Windows and DOS environment. The application-to-transport interface defines how application programs make use of the transport layers. For example, this interface level would define how a web browser program would talk to TCP/IP transport software. Examples of these interfaces include Berkeley sockets and System V STREAMS in Unix-like environments, and Winsock for Microsoft Windows.\nSpanning layer.\nAn important feature of many communities of interoperability based on a common protocol stack is a spanning layer, a term coined by David Clark\nCertain protocols are designed with the specific purpose of bridging differences at the lower layers, so that common agreements are not required there. Instead, the layer provides the definitions that permit translation to occur between a range of services or technologies used below. Thus, in somewhat abstract terms, at and above such a layer common standards contribute to interoperation, while below the layer translation is used. Such a layer is called a \"spanning layer\" in this paper. As a practical matter, real interoperation is achieved by the definition and use of effective spanning layers. But there are many different ways that a spanning layer can be crafted.\nIn the Internet protocol stack, the Internet Protocol Suite constitutes a spanning layer that defines a best-effort service for global routing of datagrams at Layer 3. The Internet is the community of interoperation based on this spanning layer."}

It takes its name from the Bohemian city of Plze\u0148 (), where the world's first pale lager (now known as Pilsner Urquell) was produced in 1842 by Pilsner Urquell Brewery.\nHistory.\nOrigin.\nThe city of Plze\u0148 was granted brewing rights in 1307. Until the mid-1840s, most Bohemian beers were top-fermented. The Pilsner Urquell Brewery, originally called in (, ), is where Pilsen beer was first brewed.\nBrewers had begun aging beer made with cool fermenting yeasts in caves (lager, i.e., [stored]), which improved the beer's clarity and shelf-life. Part of this research benefited from the knowledge already expounded on in a book (printed in German in 1794, in Czech in 1799) written by Czech brewer () (1753\u20131805) from Brno.\nThe Plze\u0148 brewery recruited the Bavarian brewer Josef Groll (1813\u20131887) who, using the local ingredients, produced the first batch of pale lager on 5 October 1842. The combination of Plze\u0148's remarkably soft water, local Saaz noble hops from nearby \u017datec, low-protein Moravian barley malt prepared by indirectly heated kilning, and Bavarian-style lagering produced a clear, golden beer.\nBy 1853, the beer was available at 35 pubs in Prague. In 1856, it came to Vienna and in 1862 to Paris. In 1859, was registered as a brand name at the Chamber of Commerce and Trade in Plze\u0148. In 1898, the Pilsner Urquell trademark was created to put emphasis on being the original brewery (\"Urquell,\" meaning 'original source').\nSome beers are labeled \"Urtyp Pilsener\" (UP) meaning they are brewed according to the original process, although many breweries use this accolade for their top beer.\nModern developments.\nThe introduction of modern refrigeration to Germany by Carl von Linde in the late 19th century eliminated the need for caves for beer storage, enabling the brewing and storing of cool fermenting beer in many new locations.\nUntil 1993 the Pilsner Urquell brewery fermented its beer using open barrels in the cellars beneath their brewery. This changed in 1993 with the use of large cylindrical tanks. Small samples are still brewed in a traditional way for taste comparisons.\nA modern pale lager termed a \"pilsner\" may have a very light, clear colour from pale to golden yellow, with varying levels of hop aroma and flavour. The alcohol strength of beers termed pilsner vary but are typically around 4.5%\u20135% (by volume). There are categories such as \"European-Style Pilsner\" at beer competitions such as the World Beer Cup. Pilsner style lagers are marketed internationally by numerous small brewers and larger conglomerates.\n Modern iteration, light to golden color brewed with American or southern hemisphere hops, possibly dry-hopped. Developed on the West Coast of the United States. Clean and light, with more pronounced hop flavor and aroma.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "23886", "revid": "137678", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23886", "title": "Phlogiston theory", "text": "Superseded theory of combustion\nThe phlogiston theory, a superseded scientific theory, postulated the existence of a fire-like element dubbed phlogiston () contained within combustible bodies and released during combustion. The name comes from the Ancient Greek (\"burning up\"), from (\"flame\"). The idea of a phlogistic substance was first proposed in 1669 by Johann Joachim Becher and later put together more formally in 1697 by Georg Ernst Stahl. Phlogiston theory attempted to explain chemical processes such as combustion and rusting, now collectively known as oxidation. The theory was challenged by the concomitant mass increase and was abandoned before the end of the 18th century following experiments by Antoine Lavoisier in the 1770s and by other scientists. Phlogiston theory led to experiments that ultimately resulted in the identification (c.\u20091771), and naming (1777), of oxygen by Joseph Priestley and Antoine Lavoisier, respectively.\nTheory.\nPhlogiston theory states that \"phlogisticated\" substances contain phlogiston and that they \"dephlogisticate\" when burned, releasing stored phlogiston, which is absorbed by the air. Growing plants then absorb this phlogiston, which is why air does not spontaneously combust and also why plant matter burns. This method of accounting for combustion was inverse to the oxygen theory by Antoine Lavoisier.\nIn general, substances that burned in the air were said to be rich in phlogiston; the fact that combustion soon ceased in an enclosed space was taken as clear-cut evidence that air had the capacity to absorb only a finite amount of phlogiston. When the air had become completely phlogisticated it would no longer serve to support the combustion of any material, nor would a metal heated in it yield a calx; nor could phlogisticated air support life. Breathing was thought to take phlogiston out of the body.\nJoseph Black's Scottish student Daniel Rutherford discovered nitrogen in 1772, and the pair used the theory to explain his results. The residue of air left after burning, a mixture of nitrogen and carbon dioxide, was sometimes referred to as \"phlogisticated air,\" having taken up all of the phlogiston. Conversely, when Joseph Priestley discovered oxygen, he believed it to be \"dephlogisticated air,\" capable of combining with more phlogiston and thus supporting combustion for longer than ordinary air.\nHistory.\nEmpedocles had formulated the classical theory that there were four elements\u2014water, earth, fire, and air\u2014and Aristotle reinforced this idea by characterising them as moist, dry, hot, and cold. Fire was thus thought of as a substance, and burning was seen as a process of decomposition that applied only to compounds. Experience had shown that burning was not always accompanied by a loss of material, and a better theory was needed to account for this.\n\"Terra pinguis\".\nIn 1667, Johann Joachim Becher published his book , which contained the first instance of what would become the phlogiston theory. In his book, Becher eliminated fire and air from the classical element model and replaced them with three forms of the earth: , , and . was the element that imparted oily, sulfurous, or combustible properties. Becher believed that was a key feature of combustion and was released when combustible substances were burned. Becher did not have much to do with phlogiston theory as it is known now, but he had a large influence on his student Stahl. Becher's main contribution was the start of the theory itself, however much of it was changed after him. Becher's idea was that combustible substances contain an ignitable matter, the .\nGeorg Ernst Stahl.\nIn 1703, Georg Ernst Stahl, a professor of medicine and chemistry at Halle, proposed a variant of the theory in which he renamed Becher's to \"phlogiston\", and it was in this form that the theory probably had its greatest influence. The term 'phlogiston' itself was not something that Stahl invented. There is evidence that the word was used as early as 1606, and in a way that was very similar to what Stahl was using it for. The term was derived from a Greek word meaning inflame. The following paragraph describes Stahl's view of phlogiston:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nStahl's first definition of phlogiston first appeared in his , published in 1697. His most quoted definition was found in the treatise on chemistry entitled in 1723. According to Stahl, phlogiston was a substance that was not able to be put into a bottle but could be transferred nonetheless. To him, wood was just a combination of ash and phlogiston, and making a metal was as simple as getting a metal calx and adding phlogiston. Soot was almost pure phlogiston, which is why heating it with a metallic calx transforms the calx into the metal and Stahl attempted to prove that the phlogiston in soot and sulfur were identical by converting sulfates to liver of sulfur using charcoal. He did not account for the increase in mass on combustion of tin and lead that were known at the time.\nJ. H. Pott.\nJohann Heinrich Pott, a student of one of Stahl's students, expanded the theory and attempted to make it much more understandable to a general audience. He compared phlogiston to light or fire, saying that all three were substances whose natures were widely understood but not easily defined. He thought that phlogiston should not be considered as a particle but as an essence that permeates substances, arguing that in a pound of any substance, one could not simply pick out the particles of phlogiston. Pott also observed the fact that when certain substances are burned they increase in mass instead of losing the mass of the phlogiston as it escapes; according to him, phlogiston was the basic fire principle and could not be obtained by itself. Flames were considered to be a mix of phlogiston and water, while a phlogiston-and-earthy mixture could not burn properly. Phlogiston permeates everything in the universe, it could be released as heat when combined with an acid. Pott proposed the following properties:\nPott's formulations proposed little new theory; he merely supplied further details and rendered existing theory more approachable to the common man.\nOthers.\nJohann Juncker also created a very complete picture of phlogiston. When reading Stahl's work, he assumed that phlogiston was in fact very material. He, therefore, came to the conclusion that phlogiston has the property of levity, i.e., that it makes the compound that it is in much lighter than it would be without the phlogiston. He also showed that air was needed for combustion by putting substances in a sealed flask and trying to burn them.\nGuillaume-Fran\u00e7ois Rouelle brought the theory of phlogiston to France, where he was an influential scientist and teacher, popularizing the theory very quickly. Many of his students became influential scientists in their own right, Lavoisier included. The French viewed phlogiston as a very subtle principle that vanishes in all analysis, yet it is in all bodies. Essentially they followed straight from Stahl's theory.\nGiovanni Antonio Giobert introduced Lavoisier's work in Italy. Giobert won a prize competition from the Academy of Letters and Sciences of Mantua in 1792 for his work refuting phlogiston theory. He presented a paper at the of Turin on 18 March 1792, entitled (\"Chemical examination of the doctrine of phlogiston and the doctrine of pneumatists in relation to the nature of water\"), which is considered the most original defence of Lavoisier's theory of water composition to appear in Italy.\nChallenge and demise.\nEventually, quantitative experiments revealed problems, including the fact that some metals gained mass after they burned, even though they were supposed to have lost phlogiston.\nSome phlogiston proponents, like Robert Boyle, explained this by concluding that phlogiston has negative mass; others, such as Louis-Bernard Guyton de Morveau, gave the more conventional argument that it is lighter than air. However, a more detailed analysis based on Archimedes' principle, the densities of magnesium and its combustion product showed that just being lighter than air could not account for the increase in mass. Stahl himself did not address the problem of the metals that burn gaining mass, but those who followed his school of thought worked on this problem.\nDuring the eighteenth century, as it became clear that metals gained mass after they were oxidized, phlogiston was increasingly regarded as a \"principle\" rather than a material substance. By the end of the eighteenth century, for the few chemists who still used the term phlogiston, the concept was linked to hydrogen. Joseph Priestley, for example, in referring to the reaction of steam on iron, while fully acknowledging that the iron gains mass after it binds with oxygen to form a calx, iron oxide, iron also loses \"the basis of inflammable air (hydrogen), and this is the substance or principle, to which we give the name phlogiston\". Following Lavoisier's description of oxygen as the \"oxidizing principle\" (hence its name, from Ancient Greek: , \"sharp\"; , \"birth\" referring to oxygen's supposed role in the formation of acids), Priestley described phlogiston as the \"alkaline principle.\"\nPhlogiston remained the dominant theory until the 1770s when Antoine-Laurent de Lavoisier showed that combustion requires a gas that has mass (specifically, oxygen) and could be measured by means of weighing closed vessels. The use of closed vessels by Lavoisier and earlier by the Russian scientist Mikhail Lomonosov also negated the buoyancy that had disguised the mass of the gases of combustion, and culminated in the principle of mass conservation. These observations solved the mass paradox and set the stage for the new oxygen theory of combustion. The British chemist Elizabeth Fulhame demonstrated through experiment that many oxidation reactions occur only in the presence of water, that they directly involve water, and that water is regenerated and is detectable at the end of the reaction. Based on her experiments, she disagreed with some of the conclusions of Lavoisier as well as with the phlogiston theorists that he critiqued. Her book on the subject appeared in print soon after Lavoisier's execution for Farm-General membership during the French Revolution.\nExperienced chemists who supported Stahl's phlogiston theory attempted to respond to the challenges suggested by Lavoisier and the newer chemists. In doing so, the theory became more complicated and assumed too much, contributing to its overall demise. Many people tried to remodel their theories on phlogiston to have the theory work with what Lavoisier was doing in his experiments. Pierre Macquer reworded his theory many times, and even though he is said to have thought the theory of phlogiston was doomed, he stood by phlogiston and tried to make the theory work.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Most claims or fictional descriptions of poltergeists show them as being capable of pinching, biting, hitting, and tripping people. They are also depicted as capable of the movement or levitation of objects such as furniture and cutlery, or noises such as knocking on doors. Foul smells are also associated with poltergeist occurrences, as well as spontaneous fires and different electrical issues such as flickering lights.\nThese manifestations have been recorded in many cultures and countries, including Brazil, Australia, the United States, Japan and most European nations. The first recorded cases date back to the 1st century.\nSkeptics explain poltergeists as juvenile tricksters fooling credulous adults.\nEtymology.\nThe word \"poltergeist\" comes from the German language words 'to make sound, to rumble' and 'ghost, spirit' and the term itself translates as 'noisy ghost', 'rumble-ghost' or a 'loud spirit'.\nSuggested explanations.\nHoax.\nMany claims have been made that poltergeist activity explains strange events (including those by modern self-styled ghost hunters), however, their evidence has so far not stood up to scrutiny. Many claimed poltergeist events have been proven upon investigation to be hoaxes.\nPsychical researcher Frank Podmore proposed the 'naughty little girl' theory for poltergeist cases (many of which have seemed to centre on an adolescent, usually a girl). He found that the centre of the disturbance was often a child who was throwing objects around to fool or scare people for attention. Skeptical investigator Joe Nickell says that claimed poltergeist incidents typically originate from \"an individual who is motivated to cause mischief\". According to Nickell:\nIn the typical poltergeist outbreak, small objects are hurled through the air by unseen forces, furniture is overturned, or other disturbances occur\u2014usually just what could be accomplished by a juvenile trickster determined to plague credulous adults.\nNickell writes that reports are often exaggerated by credulous witnesses.\nTime and time again in other \"poltergeist\" outbreaks, witnesses have reported an object leaping from its resting place supposedly on its own, when it is likely that the perpetrator had secretly obtained the object sometime earlier and waited for an opportunity to fling it, even from outside the room\u2014thus supposedly proving he or she was innocent.\nUnsubstantiated claims:\nPsychological.\nA claim of activity at Caledonia Mills (1899\u20131922) was investigated by Walter Franklin Prince, research officer for the American Society for Psychical Research in 1922. Prince concluded that the mysterious fires and alleged poltergeist phenomena were because of a psychological state of dissociation.\nNandor Fodor investigated the Thornton Heath poltergeist claim (1938). His conclusion of the case was a psychoanalytical explanation and in a subsequent publication: \"The poltergeist is not a ghost. It is a bundle of projected repressions,\".\nAccording to research in anomalistic psychology, claims of poltergeist activity can be explained by psychological factors such as illusion, memory lapses, and wishful thinking. A study (by Lange and Houran, 1998) wrote that poltergeist experiences are delusions \"resulting from the affective and cognitive dynamics of percipients' interpretation of ambiguous stimuli\". Psychologist Donovan Rawcliffe has written that almost all poltergeist cases that have been investigated turned out to be based on trickery, whilst the rest are attributable to psychological factors such as hallucinations.\nPsychoanalyst Carl Gustav Jung was interested in the concept of poltergeists and the occult in general. Jung believed that a female cousin's trance states were responsible for a dining table splitting in two and his later discovery of a broken bread knife.\nJung also believed that when a bookcase gave an explosive cracking sound during a meeting with Sigmund Freud in 1909, he correctly predicted there would be a second sound, speculating that such phenomena were caused by the 'exteriorization' of his subconscious mind. Freud disagreed, and concluded there was some natural cause. Freud's biographers maintain the sounds were likely caused by the wood of the bookcase contracting as it dried out.\nUnverified natural phenomena.\nAttempts have also been made to scientifically explain poltergeist disturbances that have not been traced to fraud or psychological factors. Skeptic and magician Milbourne Christopher found that some cases of poltergeist activity can be attributed to unusual air currents, such as a 1957 case on Cape Cod where downdrafts from an uncovered chimney became strong enough to blow a mirror off a wall, overturn chairs and knock things off shelves.\nIn the 1950s, Guy William Lambert proposed that reported poltergeist phenomena could be explained by the movement of underground water causing stress on houses. He suggested that water turbulence could cause strange sounds or structural movement of the property, possibly causing the house to vibrate and move objects. Later researchers, such as Alan Gauld and Tony Cornell, tested Lambert's hypothesis by placing specific objects in different rooms and subjecting the house to strong mechanical vibrations. They discovered that although the structure of the building had been damaged, only a few of the objects moved a very short distance. The skeptic Trevor H. Hall criticized the hypothesis claiming if it was true \"the building would almost certainly fall into ruins.\" According to Richard Wiseman the hypothesis has not held up to scrutiny.\nMichael Persinger has theorized that seismic activity could cause poltergeist phenomena. However, Persinger's claims regarding the effects of environmental geomagnetic activity on paranormal experiences have not been independently replicated and, like his findings regarding the God helmet, may simply be explained by the suggestibility of participants.\nDavid Turner, a retired physical chemist, suggested that ball lightning might cause the \"spooky movement of objects blamed on poltergeists.\"\nParanormal.\nParapsychologists Nandor Fodor and William G. Roll suggested that poltergeist activity can be explained by psychokinesis.\nHistorically, actual malicious spirits were blamed for apparent poltergeist-type activity, such as objects moving seemingly of their own accord. According to Allan Kardec, the founder of Spiritism, poltergeists are manifestations of disembodied spirits of low level, belonging to the sixth class of the third order. Under this explanation, they are believed to be closely associated with the elements (fire, air, water, earth). In Finland, somewhat famous are the case of the \"M\u00e4kkyl\u00e4 Ghost\" in 1946, which received attention in the press at the time, and the \"Devils of Martin\" in Yl\u00f6j\u00e4rvi in the late 19th century, for which affidavits were obtained in court. Samuli Paulaharju has also recorded a memoir of a typical the case of \"Salkko-from the south of Lake Inari in his book \"Memoirs of Lapland\" (\"Lapin muisteluksia\"). The story has also been published in the collection of \"Mythical Stories\" (\"Myytillisi\u00e4 tarinoita\") edited by Lauri Simonsuuri.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt; \nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The drive element of a pulley system can be a rope, cable, belt, or chain.\nHistory.\nThe earliest evidence of pulleys dates back to Ancient Egypt in the Twelfth Dynasty (1991\u20131802 BC) and Mesopotamia in the early 2nd millennium BC. In Roman Egypt, Hero of Alexandria (c. 10\u201370 AD) identified the pulley as one of six simple machines used to lift weights. Pulleys are assembled to form a block and tackle in order to provide mechanical advantage to apply large forces. Pulleys are also assembled as part of belt and chain drives in order to transmit power from one rotating shaft to another. Plutarch's \"Parallel Lives\" recounts a scene where Archimedes proved the effectiveness of compound pulleys and the block-and-tackle system by using one to pull a fully laden ship towards him as if it was gliding through water. \nBlock and tackle.\nA block is a set of pulleys (wheels) assembled so that each pulley rotates independently from every other pulley. Two blocks with a rope attached to one of the blocks and threaded through the two sets of pulleys form a block and tackle.\nA block and tackle is assembled so one block is attached to the fixed mounting point and the other is attached to the moving load. The ideal mechanical advantage of the block and tackle is equal to the number of sections of the rope that support the moving block.\nIn the diagram on the right, the ideal mechanical advantage of each of the block-and-tackle assemblies shown is as follows:\nRope and pulley systems.\nA rope and pulley system\u2014that is, a block and tackle\u2014is characterised by the use of a single continuous rope to transmit a tension force around one or more pulleys to lift or move a load\u2014the rope may be a light line or a strong cable. This system is included in the list of simple machines identified by Renaissance scientists.\nIf the rope and pulley system does not dissipate or store energy, then its mechanical advantage is the number of parts of the rope that act on the load. This can be shown as follows.\nConsider the set of pulleys that form the moving block and the parts of the rope that support this block. If there are \"p\" of these parts of the rope supporting the load \"W,\" then a force balance on the moving block shows that the tension in each of the parts of the rope must be \"W/p.\" This means the input force on the rope is \"T\"=\"W/p.\" Thus, the block and tackle reduces the input force by the factor \"p.\"\nMethod of operation.\nThe simplest theory of operation for a pulley system assumes that the pulleys and lines are weightless and that there is no energy loss due to friction. It is also assumed that the lines do not stretch.\nIn equilibrium, the forces on the moving block must sum to zero. In addition the tension in the rope must be the same for each of its parts. This means that the two parts of the rope supporting the moving block must each support half the load.\nThese are different types of pulley systems:\nThe mechanical advantage of the gun tackle can be increased by interchanging the fixed and moving blocks so the rope is attached to the moving block and the rope is pulled in the direction of the lifted load. In this case the block and tackle is said to be \"rove to advantage.\" Diagram 3 shows that now three rope parts support the load \"W\" which means the tension in the rope is \"W/3\". Thus, the mechanical advantage is three.\nBy adding a pulley to the fixed block of a gun tackle the direction of the pulling force is reversed though the mechanical advantage remains the same, Diagram 3a. This is an example of the Luff tackle.\nFree body diagrams.\nThe mechanical advantage of a pulley system can be analysed using free body diagrams which balance the tension force in the rope with the force of gravity on the load. In an ideal system, the massless and frictionless pulleys do not dissipate energy and allow for a change of direction of a rope that does not stretch or wear. In this case, a force balance on a free body that includes the load, \"W\", and \"n\" supporting sections of a rope with tension \"T\", yields:\n formula_1\nThe ratio of the load to the input tension force is the mechanical advantage \"MA\" of the pulley system,\n formula_2\nThus, the mechanical advantage of the system is equal to the number of sections of rope supporting the load.\nBelt-and-pulley systems.\nA belt-and-pulley system is characterized by two or more pulleys in common to a belt. This allows for mechanical power, torque, and speed to be transmitted across axles. If the pulleys are of differing diameters, a mechanical advantage is realized.\nA belt drive is analogous to that of a chain drive; however, a belt sheave may be smooth (devoid of discrete interlocking members as would be found on a chain sprocket, spur gear, or timing belt) so that the mechanical advantage is approximately given by the ratio of the pitch diameter of the sheaves only, not fixed exactly by the ratio of teeth as with gears and sprockets.\nIn the case of a drum-style pulley, without a groove or flanges, the pulley often is slightly convex to keep the flat belt centered. It is referred to as a \"crowned\" pulley. Once widely used on factory line shafts, this type of pulley is still found driving the rotating brush in upright vacuum cleaners, belt sanders and bandsaws. Agricultural tractors built up to the early 1950s generally had a belt pulley for a flat belt (which is what \"Belt Pulley\" magazine was named after). It has been replaced by other mechanisms with more flexibility in methods of use, such as power take-off and hydraulics.\nJust as the diameters of gears (and, correspondingly, their number of teeth) determine a gear ratio and thus the speed increases or reductions and the mechanical advantage that they can deliver, the diameters of pulleys determine those same factors. and step pulleys (which operate on the same principle, although the names tend to be applied to flat-belt versions and V-belt versions, respectively) are a way to provide multiple drive ratios in a belt-and-pulley system that can be shifted as needed, just as a transmission provides this function with a gear train that can be shifted. V-belt step pulleys are the most common way that drill presses deliver a range of spindle speeds.\nWith belts and pulleys, friction is one of the most important factors. Some uses for belts and pulleys involve peculiar angles (leading to bad belt tracking and possibly slipping the belt off the pulley) or low\u2013belt-tension environments, causing unnecessary slippage of the belt and hence extra wear to the belt. To solve this, pulleys are sometimes lagged. \"Lagging\" is the term used to describe a coating, cover or wearing surface with various textured patterns applied to pulley shells, or the application thereof. Lagging is often used to extend the life of the shell by providing a replaceable wearing surface or to improve the friction between the belt and the pulley. Notably, drive pulleys are often rubber-lagged (coated with a rubber friction layer) for exactly this reason. Applying powdered rosin to the belt may increase the friction temporarily but may shorten the life of the belt.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It entered into force on 14 January 1998.\nThe Madrid Protocol designates Antarctica as a \"natural reserve, devoted to peace and science\" (Art. 2). It complements and reinforces the Antarctic Treaty in order to increase the protection of the Antarctic environment and dependent and associated ecosystems.\nSignatories.\nAs of 2024, the original 26 nations to sign the Madrid Protocol have been joined by a further 16 nations. Of the 42 total signatories, 29 are Consultative Parties to the Antarctic Treaty, and the other 13 are Non-Consultative Parties (see Appendix 1).\nMain provisions.\nThe Protocol consists of a preamble, a main body with 27 articles, an appendix on Arbitration (13 additional articles) and six annexes, the last of which has not yet entered into force. \u00a0\nThe Protocol's preamble describes the desire of the Antarctic Treaty Parties to develop a comprehensive regime for the protection of the Antarctic environment and dependent and associated ecosystems, in the interest of mankind as a whole.\nThe main body of the Protocol includes the following key provisions:\nAnnexes to the Protocol.\nThe Protocol has six annexes with practical provisions for the protection of the Antarctic ecosystem. Article 9 of the Protocol allows for the amendment or modification of Annexes and provides for the possibility that new annexes be added to the existing ones, in order to guarantee a permanent updating mechanism.\nThe annexes are:\nThe Protocol and its first four annexes entered into force on 14 January 1998, after being adopted by all the Consultative Parties to the Antarctic Treaty. Annex V was drafted after the first four annexes and entered into force on 24 May 2002. The sixth annex was agreed at the XXVIII Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting (Stockholm, 2005) and has not yet entered into force as it still awaits adoption by all Consultative Parties. As of 2024, 20 of the 29 Consultative Parties have adopted it. In 2009 an amendment to Annex II was adopted. \u00a0\nAnnex I: Environmental Impact Assessment.\nThis Annex establishes that all activities carried out in the Antarctic Treaty area must be preceded by an environmental impact assessment (EIA), to foresee the likely impacts that such activities might cause on the Antarctic environment. The EIA is a process that aims to provide information to decision-makers about the environmental consequences of a proposed activity. Such assessment allows the development and implementation of mitigation and restoration measures.\nAnnex II: Conservation of Antarctic flora and fauna.\nIn order to protect Antarctic fauna and flora and taking into account that human activity may represent a threat to their survival, Annex II establishes that the taking and harmful interference of Antarctic species, as well as the introduction of non-native species to the continent, are prohibited, except with a permit issued by an Antarctic Treaty Party.\nAccording to Annex II, the taking of Antarctic species means to kill, injure, capture, handle or molest a native mammal or bird, or to remove or damage such quantities of native plants or invertebrates that their local distribution or abundance would be significantly affected. Annex II also establishes that harmful interference to an Antarctic species can occur due to multiple reasons, among which are:\nAnnex II also prohibits the introduction onto land or ice shelves, or into water, in the Antarctic Treaty Area of any non-native species of living organisms, except in accordance with a permit. The prohibition of introducing non-native species is related to their potential to negatively affect native species. A non-native species may act as a competitor (for habitat and/or food) with the native species; as a vector of diseases to which native species are not accustomed; as a habitat-modifying agent, or as a predator of the native species. The only types of species allowed to enter Antarctica, after a permit has been issued, are cultivated plants and their reproductive propagules for controlled use and species of living organisms for controlled experimental use.\nFinally, Annex II allows for the designation as \"Specially Protected Antarctic Species\" those species of native mammals, birds, plants and invertebrates, whose survival or stability could be in a particularly compromised situation. \u00a0\nAnnex III: Waste Disposal and Treatment.\nPursuant to this Annex, Antarctic waste management includes the planning, classification, management, storage, transportation and final disposal of all waste generated south of 60\u00b0S. \u00a0\nAnnex III prohibits the open burning or disposal of waste onto ice-free areas or into freshwater systems. \u00a0\nIt also establishes that the amount of waste produced or disposed of in the Antarctic Treaty area shall be reduced as far as practicable so as to minimise impact on the Antarctic environment. \u00a0\nThe Protocol contemplates three methods for the final disposal of waste in Antarctica:\nThis Annex also proposes a classification system for waste generated in Antarctica, which serves as a basis for keeping a record of waste and to facilitate studies aimed at evaluating the impacts on the environment of scientific activities and associated logistical support. To this end, this Annex establishes that the waste generated must be classified into five groups:\n\u2022 Group 1: sewage and domestic liquid waste,\n\u2022 Group 2: other liquid wastes and chemicals, including fuels and lubricants,\n\u2022 Group 3: solids to be combusted,\n\u2022 Group 4: other solid wastes, and\n\u2022 Group 5: radioactive material.\nTo further reduce the impact of waste on the Antarctic environment, Annex III to the Protocol establishes that each National Programme* must prepare, review and periodically update waste treatment plans for bases, camps and vessels, specifying programmes for cleaning up existing waste disposal sites and abandoned work sites. \u00a0\nAnnex IV: Prevention of Marine Pollution.\nThis Annex establishes prohibitions and restrictions on the dumping of waste from ships, while operating in the Antarctic Treaty area. This Annex is part of the provisions of the convention to prevent Marine Pollution from ships, known internationally as MARPOL 73/78 (originally signed in 1973, with amendments in 1978), within the framework of which, in 1990, it was agreed to grant Antarctic waters the status of \"Special Zone\", where greater restrictions must be observed than in other international waters.\nThus, any discharge into the sea of oil or oily mixture, any noxious liquid substance, and any other chemical or other substances (in quantities or concentrations that are harmful to the marine environment), and all plastics (including but not limited to synthetic ropes, synthetic fishing nets, and plastic garbage bags) shall be prohibited. \u00a0\nThe Annex also regulates discharges into the sea of untreated sewage, as defined in Annex IV of MARPOL 73/78, and establishes that all ships, before entering the Antarctic Treaty area, are fitted with a tank or tanks of sufficient capacity on board for the retention of all sludge, dirty ballast, tank washing water and other oily residues and mixtures.\nFinally, Annex IV states that, to respond more effectively to marine pollution emergencies, the Parties shall develop contingency plans for marine pollution response in the Antarctic Treaty area. \u00a0\nAnnex V: Area Protection and Management.\nAnnex V to the Protocol establishes a new scheme of protected areas in Antarctica, made up of three categories: Antarctic Specially Protected Areas (ASPAs), Antarctic Specially Managed Areas (ASMAs), and Historic Sites and Monuments (HSMs).\nAn \"Antarctic Specially Protected Area\" (ASPA) is a terrestrial or marine area that has outstanding environmental, scientific, aesthetic, historic or wilderness values, or ongoing or planned scientific research, that the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting (ATCM), after any Party's proposal, designates as such to protect those values. Former \"Sites of Special Scientific Interest\" and former \"Specially Protected Areas\", designated as such by previous Consultative Meetings, were then reclassified as ASPAs.\nAnnex V prohibits entering an ASPA, except in accordance with a permit issued by any Party to the Antarctic Treaty. It also establishes that each ASPA shall have a Management Plan, a document that identifies the values to be protected and the measures to be taken to guarantee their proper management.\nAn \"Antarctic Specially Managed Area\" (ASMA) is an area where different types of human activities (logistics, scientific, conservation, tourism) concur and might pose risks of mutual interference or cumulative environmental impacts. They are designated as ASMAs to help plan and coordinate activities, avoid potential conflicts of interest, improve cooperation between Parties or minimise adverse environmental impacts. ASMAs can comprise marine or terrestrial sectors, and may contain ASPAs. Entry to ASMAs does not require a permit, but, if there is an ASPA within, entry to this does require it.\nFinally, certain sites, graves, objects, constructions or artifacts located on the Antarctic continent have a historical value that the Antarctic Treaty System recognises through their designation as \"Antarctic Historic Sites and Monuments\" (HSMs). HSMs can be part of ASPAs, ASMAs, or simply be listed as such. The elements that are part of a Historic Site and Monument must not be damaged, removed or destroyed.\nAs of 2024, there are 76 ASPAs, 6 ASMAs and 91 HSMs, although these numbers tend to increase gradually with advances in knowledge of the continent. The Antarctic Treaty Secretariat maintains a database and maps of all protected areas in Antarctica.\nAnnex VI: Responsibility arising from Environmental Emergencies.\nThis Annex outlines arrangements to prevent and respond to environmental emergencies in the Antarctic Treaty area arising from scientific research programmes, tourism and other governmental and non-governmental activities. It establishes the rules governing liability for environmental emergencies, and provides that compensation may be claimed from the polluter if that party has not taken prompt and effective response action.\nBackground of the Protocol.\nThe protection of the Antarctic environment was not one of the main original objectives of the Antarctic Treaty. The main engines of this agreement were the safeguarding of peace and freedom for the development of scientific research. However, some prohibitions and restrictions contained in the Treaty, especially those referring to nuclear activity, can be considered important from the environmental point of view. Once the Antarctic Treaty entered into force in 1961, a series of measures were agreed under the provisions of its article IX (which provides for the creation of measures aimed at \"the preservation and conservation of living resources in Antarctica\"), or in separate conventions, which focused on issues such as the protection of flora and fauna, the designation of protected areas, and waste and fuel management, among others.\nThe Madrid Protocol was negotiated by the Parties to the Antarctic Treaty between 1989 and 1991, following the failure to agree on an international regulatory instrument governing mining in Antarctica (the Convention on the Regulation of Antarctic Mineral Resource Activities, or CRAMRA).\nThe Protocol built on a range of environmental provisions agreed at several ATCMs since the signing of the Treaty including the 1964 Agreed Measures on the Conservation of Antarctic Fauna and Flora.\u00a0 It also picked up environmental management elements that had been developed during the CRAMRA negotiations (such as emergency response provisions), as well as previous work of the Scientific Committee of Antarctic Research (SCAR) and the International Maritime Organization (IMO), on waste management and marine pollution, respectively.\nThe agreement on the Madrid Protocol constituted the culmination of years of development of environmental standards and practices, which were synthesised and articulated into a single comprehensive agreement. The Protocol set out new rules on environmental protection, including new restrictions to human activity in Antarctica and a framework to incorporate new issues through the elaboration of additional annexes. \u00a0Through the Protocol, the protection of the Antarctic environment was established as the third pillar of the Antarctic Treaty, together with peaceful use and international scientific cooperation. \u00a0\nThe issue of minerals in the Protocol.\nArticle 7 of the Madrid Protocol expressly prohibits any activity related to the exploitation of Antarctic mineral resources, except for scientific research. In principle, this prohibition of exploration and exploitation of mineral resources is valid indefinitely, although Article 25 of the Protocol establishes the possibility that any Consultative Party may request a review of the application of its content, once 50 years have elapsed since the entry into force of the Protocol (in the year 2048). This provision applies by extension to Article 7. With particular reference to mineral resources, Article 25, in its first paragraph, establishes that, before proceeding with an amendment to Article 7, a series of circumstances and preconditions must be met. It is for this reason that some authors maintain that the Protocol establishes a 50-year moratorium on the exploration and exploitation of Antarctic minerals, although, in fact, a moratorium would imply the automatic fall of the provisions of Article 7, and this is not exactly the case raised by Article 25.\nAppendix 1: Countries that have signed the Madrid Protocol.\n\"*The Protocol entered into force on 14 January 1998.\"\nCampaign.\nThe treaty followed a lengthy campaign by Greenpeace to block the proposed Convention on the Regulation of Antarctic Mineral Resource Activities enabling mining, including the construction of an Antarctic base from 1987 to 1991. Greenpeace claims the protocol as a victory.\nHonours.\nMadrid Dome in Aristotle Mountains, Antarctica is named in connection with the Protocol.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Particle radiation is referred to as a particle beam if the particles are all moving in the same direction, similar to a light beam.\nDue to the wave\u2013particle duality, all moving particles also have wave character. Higher energy particles more easily exhibit particle characteristics, while lower energy particles more easily exhibit wave characteristics.\nTypes and production.\nParticles can be electrically charged or uncharged:\nParticle radiation can be emitted by an unstable atomic nucleus (via radioactive decay), or it can be produced from some other kind of nuclear reaction. Many types of particles may be emitted:\nMechanisms that produce particle radiation include:\nCharged particles (electrons, mesons, protons, alpha particles, heavier HZE ions, etc.) can be produced by particle accelerators. Ion irradiation is widely used in the semiconductor industry to introduce dopants into\nmaterials, a method known as ion implantation.\nParticle accelerators can also produce neutrino beams. Neutron beams are mostly produced by nuclear reactors.\nPassage through matter.\nIn radiation protection, radiation is often separated into two categories, \"ionizing\" and \"non-ionizing\", to denote the level of danger posed to humans. Ionization is the process of removing electrons from atoms, leaving two electrically charged particles (an electron and a positively charged ion) behind. The negatively charged electrons and positively charged ions created by ionizing radiation may cause damage in living tissue. Basically, a particle is ionizing if its energy is higher than the ionization energy of a typical substance, i.e., a few eV, and interacts with electrons significantly.\nAccording to the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection, electromagnetic radiations from ultraviolet to infrared, to radiofrequency (including microwave) radiation, static and time-varying electric and magnetic fields, and ultrasound belong to the non-ionizing radiations.\nThe charged particles mentioned above all belong to the ionizing radiations. When passing through matter, they ionize and thus lose energy in many small steps. The distance to the point where the charged particle has lost all its energy is called the range of the particle. The range depends upon the type of particle, its initial energy, and the material it traverses. Similarly, the energy loss per unit path length, the 'stopping power', depends on the type and energy of the charged particle and upon the material. The stopping power and hence, the density of ionization, usually increases toward the end of range and reaches a maximum, the Bragg peak, shortly before the energy drops to zero.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

This allows the calculation of per capita income for both the country as a whole and specific regions or demographic groups. However, comparing per capita income across different countries is often difficult, since methodologies, definitions and data quality can vary greatly. Since the 1990s, the OECD has conducted regular surveys among its 38 member countries using a standardized methodology and set of questions.\nPer capita income is often used to measure a sector's average income and compare the wealth of different populations. Per capita income is also often used to measure a country's standard of living. When used to compare income levels of different countries, it is usually expressed using a commonly used international currency, such as the euro or United States dollar.

The Patate flows south and in Tungurahua Province it is joined by the Chambo River just upstream from the town of Ba\u00f1os de Agua Santa just north of the volcano Mount Tungurahua and becomes the Pastaza. Seven kilometers east of Ba\u00f1os, it is dammed for the Agoy\u00e1n hydroelectric project, which has created a silty lagoon by the village of La Cieniga. The Agoy\u00e1n dam was placed in that location specifically to leave the famous Falls of Agoy\u00e1n, about 5\u00a0km further downstream, intact. After the waterfall the river enters a gorge where there is very fast whitewater with class-4 rapids; it is often used for whitewater rafting although it is not considered to be of the same quality as the Tena River and is therefore less popular for the sport.\nFrom the junction with the Chambo, the Pastaza flows almost due east for about where it then turns south-east, as it is joined by the Topo River. The Troncal Amazonas highway parallels the river from Ba\u00f1os to Puyo, passing through seven tunnels, and four major waterfalls that are touristic destinations for many Ecuadorians (Agoy\u00e1n and Pail\u00f3n del Diablo being the most popular.) Just past the town of Santa Inez, the Pastaza River crosses into the province of Pastaza, where it forms the boundary between that province and Morona-Santiago. At the town of Mera, shortly before reaching Puyo, the river exits the mountains and flows into a wide valley, becoming wider and shallower. After Shell the river becomes braided and meanders, leaving oxbows and sloughs along its route across the Amazonian floodplain.\nAfter cutting through Ecuador, the Pastaza passes into Peru at the village of Hito Zoilaluz on Isla Zoilaluz and flows south into the Mara\u00f1\u00f3n River near Puerto Industrial.\nTributaries.\nThe Pastaza has numerous tributaries, both above and below the hydroelectric dam. These contribute to its rapid flow and to its tendency to flood. On the highway side of the Pastaza, a tributary river occurs about every 3\u20134\u00a0km for a stretch of about 50\u00a0km; on the opposite bank, the number of tributaries is slightly lower. The major tributaries are the Chambo, Bobonaza, and Huasaga, also important are the Ambato, the Pindo, and the Puyo.\nEconomy.\nThere are no major fisheries on the Pastaza River - it is primarily used as a means of transport by canoe. Its rise and fall are rapid and uncertain, and it is shallow and full of sandbanks and snags. Flooding occurs seasonally.\nBridges.\nIn Ecuador, there are very few bridges across the Pastaza. The most significant ones are in Tungurahua province - namely a large span over the exact point of headwaters, just north of Ba\u00f1os, and the secondary span created by the Agoy\u00e1n dam. After this, bridges tend to be of the suspension type, suitable for foot or small vehicle passage only. However, it is notable that the Pastaza can be forded during the dry season in a 4x4 truck, going across the floodplains below the town of Mera.\nReferences and notes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

They are the three-dimensional analogs of polygonal compounds such as the hexagram.\nThe outer vertices of a compound can be connected to form a convex polyhedron called its convex hull. A compound is a faceting of its convex hull.\nAnother convex polyhedron is formed by the small central space common to all members of the compound. This polyhedron can be used as the core for a set of stellations.\nRegular compounds.\nA regular polyhedral compound can be defined as a compound which, like a regular polyhedron, is vertex-transitive, edge-transitive, and face-transitive. Unlike the case of polyhedra, this is not equivalent to the symmetry group acting transitively on its flags; the compound of two tetrahedra is the only regular compound with that property. There are five regular compounds of polyhedra:\nBest known is the regular compound of two tetrahedra, often called the stella octangula, a name given to it by Kepler. The vertices of the two tetrahedra define a cube, and the intersection of the two define a regular octahedron, which shares the same face-planes as the compound. Thus the compound of two tetrahedra is a stellation of the octahedron, and in fact, the only finite stellation thereof.\nThe regular compound of five tetrahedra comes in two enantiomorphic versions, which together make up the regular compound of ten tetrahedra. The regular compound of ten tetrahedra can also be seen as a compound of five stellae octangulae.\nEach of the regular tetrahedral compounds is self-dual or dual to its chiral twin; the regular compound of five cubes and the regular compound of five octahedra are dual to each other.\nHence, regular polyhedral compounds can also be regarded as dual-regular compounds.\nCoxeter's notation for regular compounds is given in the table above, incorporating Schl\u00e4fli symbols. The material inside the square brackets, [\"d\"{\"p\",\"q\"}], denotes the components of the compound: \"d\" separate {\"p\",\"q\"}'s. The material \"before\" the square brackets denotes the vertex arrangement of the compound: \"c\"{\"m\",\"n\"}[\"d\"{\"p\",\"q\"}] is a compound of \"d\" {\"p\",\"q\"}'s sharing the vertices of {\"m\",\"n\"} counted \"c\" times. The material \"after\" the square brackets denotes the facet arrangement of the compound: [\"d\"{\"p\",\"q\"}]\"e\"{\"s\",\"t\"} is a compound of \"d\" {\"p\",\"q\"}'s sharing the faces of {\"s\",\"t\"} counted \"e\" times. These may be combined: thus \"c\"{\"m\",\"n\"}[\"d\"{\"p\",\"q\"}]\"e\"{\"s\",\"t\"} is a compound of \"d\" {\"p\",\"q\"}'s sharing the vertices of {\"m\",\"n\"} counted \"c\" times \"and\" the faces of {\"s\",\"t\"} counted \"e\" times. This notation can be generalised to compounds in any number of dimensions.\nDual compounds.\nA dual compound is composed of a polyhedron and its dual, arranged reciprocally about a common midsphere, such that the edge of one polyhedron intersects the dual edge of the dual polyhedron. There are five dual compounds of the regular polyhedra.\nThe core is the rectification of both solids. The hull is the dual of this rectification, and its rhombic faces have the intersecting edges of the two solids as diagonals (and have their four alternate vertices). For the convex solids, this is the convex hull.\nThe tetrahedron is self-dual, so the dual compound of a tetrahedron with its dual is the regular stellated octahedron.\nThe octahedral and icosahedral dual compounds are the first stellations of the cuboctahedron and icosidodecahedron, respectively.\nThe small stellated dodecahedral (or great dodecahedral) dual compound has the great dodecahedron completely interior to the small stellated dodecahedron.\nUniform compounds.\nIn 1976 John Skilling published \"Uniform Compounds of Uniform Polyhedra\" which enumerated 75 compounds (including 6 as infinite prismatic sets of compounds, #20-#25) made from uniform polyhedra with rotational symmetry. (Every vertex is vertex-transitive and every vertex is transitive with every other vertex.) This list includes the five regular compounds above. https://\nThe 75 uniform compounds are listed in the Table below. Most are shown singularly colored by each polyhedron element. Some chiral pairs of face groups are colored by symmetry of the faces within each polyhedron.\nOther compounds.\nTwo polyhedra that are compounds but have their elements rigidly locked into place are the small complex icosidodecahedron (compound of icosahedron and great dodecahedron) and the great complex icosidodecahedron (compound of small stellated dodecahedron and great icosahedron). If the definition of a uniform polyhedron is generalised, they are uniform.\nThe section for enantiomorph pairs in Skilling's list does not contain the compound of two great snub dodecicosidodecahedra, as the pentagram faces would coincide. Removing the coincident faces results in the compound of twenty octahedra.\n4-polytope compounds.\nIn 4-dimensions, there are a large number of regular compounds of regular polytopes. Coxeter lists a few of these in his book Regular Polytopes. McMullen added six in his paper \"New Regular Compounds of 4-Polytopes\".\nSelf-duals:\nDual pairs:\nUniform compounds and duals with convex 4-polytopes:\nThe superscript (var) in the tables above indicates that the labeled compounds are distinct from the other compounds with the same number of constituents.\nCompounds with regular star 4-polytopes.\nSelf-dual star compounds:\nDual pairs of compound stars:\nUniform compound stars and duals:\nCompounds with duals.\nDual positions:\nGroup theory.\nIn terms of group theory, if \"G\" is the symmetry group of a polyhedral compound, and the group acts transitively on the polyhedra (so that each polyhedron can be sent to any of the others, as in uniform compounds), then if \"H\" is the stabilizer of a single chosen polyhedron, the polyhedra can be identified with the orbit space \"G\"/\"H\" \u2013 the coset \"gH\" corresponds to which polyhedron \"g\" sends the chosen polyhedron to.\nCompounds of tilings.\nThere are eighteen two-parameter families of regular compound tessellations of the Euclidean plane. In the hyperbolic plane, five one-parameter families and seventeen isolated cases are known, but the completeness of this listing has not been enumerated.\nThe Euclidean and hyperbolic compound families 2 {\"p\",\"p\"} (4 \u2264 \"p\" \u2264 \u221e, \"p\" an integer) are analogous to the spherical stella octangula, 2 {3,3}.\nA known family of regular Euclidean compound honeycombs in any number of dimensions is an infinite family of compounds of hypercubic honeycombs, all sharing vertices and faces with another hypercubic honeycomb. This compound can have any number of hypercubic honeycombs.\nThere are also \"dual-regular\" tiling compounds. A simple example is the E2 compound of a hexagonal tiling and its dual triangular tiling, which shares its edges with the deltoidal trihexagonal tiling. The Euclidean compounds of two hypercubic honeycombs are both regular and dual-regular.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Being a regular polyhedron means that the faces are congruent (identical in shape and size) regular polygons (all angles congruent and all edges congruent), and the same number of faces meet at each vertex. There are only five such polyhedra: a tetrahedron (four faces), a cube (six faces), an octahedron (eight faces), a dodecahedron (twelve faces), and an icosahedron (twenty faces).\nGeometers have studied the Platonic solids for thousands of years. They are named for the ancient Greek philosopher Plato, who hypothesized in one of his dialogues, the \"Timaeus\", that the classical elements were made of these regular solids.\nHistory.\nThe Platonic solids have been known since antiquity. It has been suggested that certain carved stone balls created by the late Neolithic people of Scotland represent these shapes; however, these balls have rounded knobs rather than being polyhedral, the numbers of knobs frequently differed from the numbers of vertices of the Platonic solids, there is no ball whose knobs match the 20 vertices of the dodecahedron, and the arrangement of the knobs was not always symmetrical.\nThe ancient Greeks studied the Platonic solids extensively. Some sources (such as Proclus) credit Pythagoras with their discovery. Other evidence suggests that he may have only been familiar with the tetrahedron, cube, and dodecahedron and that the discovery of the octahedron and icosahedron belong to Theaetetus, a contemporary of Plato. In any case, Theaetetus gave a mathematical description of all five and may have been responsible for the first known proof that no other convex regular polyhedra exist.\nThe Platonic solids are prominent in the philosophy of Plato, their namesake. Plato wrote about them in the dialogue \"Timaeus\" c. 360 B.C. in which he associated each of the four classical elements (earth, air, water, and fire) with a regular solid. Earth was associated with the cube, air with the octahedron, water with the icosahedron, and fire with the tetrahedron. Of the fifth Platonic solid, the dodecahedron, Plato obscurely remarked, \"...the god used [it] for arranging the constellations on the whole heaven\". Aristotle added a fifth element, aither (aether in Latin, \"ether\" in English) and postulated that the heavens were made of this element, but he had no interest in matching it with Plato's fifth solid.\nEuclid completely mathematically described the Platonic solids in the \"Elements\", the last book (Book XIII) of which is devoted to their properties. Propositions 13\u201317 in Book XIII describe the construction of the tetrahedron, octahedron, cube, icosahedron, and dodecahedron in that order. For each solid Euclid finds the ratio of the diameter of the circumscribed sphere to the edge length. In Proposition 18 he argues that there are no further convex regular polyhedra. Andreas Speiser has advocated the view that the construction of the five regular solids is the chief goal of the deductive system canonized in the \"Elements\". Much of the information in Book XIII is probably derived from the work of Theaetetus.\nIn the 16th century, the German astronomer Johannes Kepler attempted to relate the five extraterrestrial planets known at that time to the five Platonic solids. In \"Mysterium Cosmographicum\", published in 1596, Kepler proposed a model of the Solar System in which the five solids were set inside one another and separated by a series of inscribed and circumscribed spheres. Kepler proposed that the distance relationships between the six planets known at that time could be understood in terms of the five Platonic solids enclosed within a sphere that represented the orbit of Saturn. The six spheres each corresponded to one of the planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn). The solids were ordered with the innermost being the octahedron, followed by the icosahedron, dodecahedron, tetrahedron, and finally the cube, thereby dictating the structure of the solar system and the distance relationships between the planets by the Platonic solids. In the end, Kepler's original idea had to be abandoned, but out of his research came his three laws of orbital dynamics, the first of which was that the orbits of planets are ellipses rather than circles, changing the course of physics and astronomy. He also discovered the Kepler solids, which are two \"nonconvex\" regular polyhedra.\nCartesian coordinates.\nFor Platonic solids centered at the origin, simple Cartesian coordinates of the vertices are given below. The Greek letter formula_1 is used to represent the golden ratio formula_2.\nThe coordinates for the tetrahedron, dodecahedron, and icosahedron are given in two positions such that each can be deduced from the other: in the case of the tetrahedron, by changing all coordinates of sign (central symmetry), or, in the other cases, by exchanging two coordinates (reflection with respect to any of the three diagonal planes).\nThese coordinates reveal certain relationships between the Platonic solids: the vertices of the tetrahedron represent half of those of the cube, as {4,3} or , one of two sets of 4 vertices in dual positions, as h{4,3} or . Both tetrahedral positions make the compound stellated octahedron.\nThe coordinates of the icosahedron are related to two alternated sets of coordinates of a nonuniform truncated octahedron, t{3,4} or , also called a \"snub octahedron\", as s{3,4} or , and seen in the compound of two icosahedra.\nEight of the vertices of the dodecahedron are shared with the cube. Completing all orientations leads to the compound of five cubes.\nCombinatorial properties.\nA convex polyhedron is a Platonic solid if and only if all three of the following requirements are met.\nEach Platonic solid can therefore be assigned a pair {\"p\",\u00a0\"q\"} of integers, where \"p\" is the number of edges (or, equivalently, vertices) of each face, and \"q\" is the number of faces (or, equivalently, edges) that meet at each vertex. This pair {\"p\",\u00a0\"q\"}, called the Schl\u00e4fli symbol, gives a combinatorial description of the polyhedron. The Schl\u00e4fli symbols of the five Platonic solids are given in the table below.\nAll other combinatorial information about these solids, such as total number of vertices (\"V\"), edges (\"E\"), and faces (\"F\"), can be determined from \"p\" and \"q\". Since any edge joins two vertices and has two adjacent faces we must have:\nformula_3\nThe other relationship between these values is given by Euler's formula:\nformula_4\nThis can be proved in many ways. Together these three relationships completely determine \"V\", \"E\", and \"F\":\nformula_5\nSwapping \"p\" and \"q\" interchanges \"F\" and \"V\" while leaving \"E\" unchanged. For a geometric interpretation of this property, see .\nAs a configuration.\nThe elements of a polyhedron can be expressed in a configuration matrix. The rows and columns correspond to vertices, edges, and faces. The diagonal numbers say how many of each element occur in the whole polyhedron. The nondiagonal numbers say how many of the column's element occur in or at the row's element. Dual pairs of polyhedra have their configuration matrices rotated 180 degrees from each other.\nClassification.\nThe classical result is that only five convex regular polyhedra exist. Two common arguments below demonstrate no more than five Platonic solids can exist, but positively demonstrating the existence of any given solid is a separate question\u2014one that requires an explicit construction.\nGeometric proof.\nThe following geometric argument is very similar to the one given by Euclid in the \"Elements\":\nTopological proof.\nA purely topological proof can be made using only combinatorial information about the solids. The key is Euler's observation that \"V\"\u00a0\u2212\u00a0\"E\"\u00a0+\u00a0\"F\"\u00a0=\u00a02, and the fact that \"pF\"\u00a0=\u00a02\"E\"\u00a0=\u00a0\"qV\", where \"p\" stands for the number of edges of each face and \"q\" for the number of edges meeting at each vertex. Combining these equations one obtains the equation\nformula_6\nSimple algebraic manipulation then gives\nformula_7\nSince \"E\" is strictly positive we must have\nformula_8\nUsing the fact that \"p\" and \"q\" must both be at least 3, one can easily see that there are only five possibilities for {\"p\",\u00a0\"q\"}:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;{3,\u00a03}, {4,\u00a03}, {3,\u00a04}, {5,\u00a03}, {3,\u00a05}.\nGeometric properties.\nAngles.\nThere are a number of angles associated with each Platonic solid. The dihedral angle is the interior angle between any two face planes. The dihedral angle, \"\u03b8\", of the solid {\"p\",\"q\"} is given by the formula\nformula_9\nThis is sometimes more conveniently expressed in terms of the tangent by\nformula_10\nThe quantity \"h\" (called the Coxeter number) is 4, 6, 6, 10, and 10 for the tetrahedron, cube, octahedron, dodecahedron, and icosahedron respectively.\nThe angular deficiency at the vertex of a polyhedron is the difference between the sum of the face-angles at that vertex and 2\u03c0. The defect, \"\u03b4\", at any vertex of the Platonic solids {\"p\",\"q\"} is\nformula_11\nBy a theorem of Descartes, this is equal to 4\u03c0 divided by the number of vertices (i.e. the total defect at all vertices is 4\u03c0).\nThe three-dimensional analog of a plane angle is a solid angle. The solid angle, \"\u03a9\", at the vertex of a Platonic solid is given in terms of the dihedral angle by\nformula_12\nThis follows from the spherical excess formula for a spherical polygon and the fact that the vertex figure of the polyhedron {\"p\",\"q\"} is a regular \"q\"-gon.\nThe solid angle of a face subtended from the center of a platonic solid is equal to the solid angle of a full sphere (4\u03c0 steradians) divided by the number of faces. This is equal to the angular deficiency of its dual.\nThe various angles associated with the Platonic solids are tabulated below. The numerical values of the solid angles are given in steradians. The constant \"\u03c6\" = is the golden ratio.\nRadii, area, and volume.\nAnother virtue of regularity is that the Platonic solids all possess three concentric spheres:\nThe radii of these spheres are called the \"circumradius\", the \"midradius\", and the \"inradius\". These are the distances from the center of the polyhedron to the vertices, edge midpoints, and face centers respectively. The circumradius \"R\" and the inradius \"r\" of the solid {\"p\",\u00a0\"q\"} with edge length \"a\" are given by\nformula_13\nwhere \"\u03b8\" is the dihedral angle. The midradius \"\u03c1\" is given by\nformula_14\nwhere \"h\" is the quantity used above in the definition of the dihedral angle (\"h\" = 4, 6, 6, 10, or 10). The ratio of the circumradius to the inradius is symmetric in \"p\" and \"q\":\nformula_15\nThe surface area, \"A\", of a Platonic solid {\"p\",\u00a0\"q\"} is easily computed as area of a regular \"p\"-gon times the number of faces \"F\". This is:\nformula_16\nThe volume is computed as \"F\" times the volume of the pyramid whose base is a regular \"p\"-gon and whose height is the inradius \"r\". That is,\nformula_17\nThe following table lists the various radii of the Platonic solids together with their surface area and volume. The overall size is fixed by taking the edge length, \"a\", to be equal to 2.\nThe constants \"\u03c6\" and \"\u03be\" in the above are given by\nformula_18\nAmong the Platonic solids, either the dodecahedron or the icosahedron may be seen as the best approximation to the sphere. The icosahedron has the largest number of faces and the largest dihedral angle, it hugs its inscribed sphere the most tightly, and its surface area to volume ratio is closest to that of a sphere of the same size (i.e. either the same surface area or the same volume). The dodecahedron, on the other hand, has the smallest angular defect, the largest vertex solid angle, and it fills out its circumscribed sphere the most.\nPoint in space.\nFor an arbitrary point in the space of a Platonic solid with circumradius \"R\", whose distances to the centroid of the Platonic solid and its \"n\" vertices are \"L\" and \"di\" respectively, and\nformula_19,\nwe have\nformula_20\nFor all five Platonic solids, we have\nformula_21\nIf \"di\" are the distances from the \"n\" vertices of the Platonic solid to any point on its circumscribed sphere, then\nformula_22\nRupert property.\nA polyhedron \"P\" is said to have the Rupert property if a polyhedron of the same or larger size and the same shape as \"P\" can pass through a hole in \"P\".\nAll five Platonic solids have this property.\nSymmetry.\nDual polyhedra.\nEvery polyhedron has a dual (or \"polar\") polyhedron with faces and vertices interchanged. The dual of every Platonic solid is another Platonic solid, so that we can arrange the five solids into dual pairs.\nIf a polyhedron has Schl\u00e4fli symbol {\"p\",\u00a0\"q\"}, then its dual has the symbol {\"q\",\u00a0\"p\"}. Indeed, every combinatorial property of one Platonic solid can be interpreted as another combinatorial property of the dual.\nOne can construct the dual polyhedron by taking the vertices of the dual to be the centers of the faces of the original figure. Connecting the centers of adjacent faces in the original forms the edges of the dual and thereby interchanges the number of faces and vertices while maintaining the number of edges.\nMore generally, one can dualize a Platonic solid with respect to a sphere of radius \"d\" concentric with the solid. The radii (\"R\",\u00a0\"\u03c1\",\u00a0\"r\") of a solid and those of its dual (\"R\"*,\u00a0\"\u03c1\"*,\u00a0\"r\"*) are related by\nformula_23\nDualizing with respect to the midsphere (\"d\"\u00a0=\u00a0\"\u03c1\") is often convenient because the midsphere has the same relationship to both polyhedra. Taking \"d\"2\u00a0=\u00a0\"Rr\" yields a dual solid with the same circumradius and inradius (i.e. \"R\"*\u00a0=\u00a0\"R\" and \"r\"*\u00a0=\u00a0\"r\").\nSymmetry groups.\nIn mathematics, the concept of symmetry is studied with the notion of a mathematical group. Every polyhedron has an associated symmetry group, which is the set of all transformations (Euclidean isometries) which leave the polyhedron invariant. The order of the symmetry group is the number of symmetries of the polyhedron. One often distinguishes between the \"full symmetry group\", which includes reflections, and the \"proper symmetry group\", which includes only rotations.\nThe symmetry groups of the Platonic solids are a special class of three-dimensional point groups known as polyhedral groups. The high degree of symmetry of the Platonic solids can be interpreted in a number of ways. Most importantly, the vertices of each solid are all equivalent under the action of the symmetry group, as are the edges and faces. One says the action of the symmetry group is transitive on the vertices, edges, and faces. In fact, this is another way of defining regularity of a polyhedron: a polyhedron is \"regular\" if and only if it is vertex-uniform, edge-uniform, and face-uniform.\nThere are only three symmetry groups associated with the Platonic solids rather than five, since the symmetry group of any polyhedron coincides with that of its dual. This is easily seen by examining the construction of the dual polyhedron. Any symmetry of the original must be a symmetry of the dual and vice versa. The three polyhedral groups are:\nThe orders of the proper (rotation) groups are 12, 24, and 60 respectively \u2013 precisely twice the number of edges in the respective polyhedra. The orders of the full symmetry groups are twice as much again (24, 48, and 120). See (Coxeter 1973) for a derivation of these facts. All Platonic solids except the tetrahedron are \"centrally symmetric,\" meaning they are preserved under reflection through the origin.\nThe following table lists the various symmetry properties of the Platonic solids. The symmetry groups listed are the full groups with the rotation subgroups given in parentheses (likewise for the number of symmetries). Wythoff's kaleidoscope construction is a method for constructing polyhedra directly from their symmetry groups. They are listed for reference Wythoff's symbol for each of the Platonic solids.\nIn nature and technology.\nThe tetrahedron, cube, and octahedron all occur naturally in crystal structures. These by no means exhaust the numbers of possible forms of crystals. However, neither the regular icosahedron nor the regular dodecahedron are amongst them. One of the forms, called the pyritohedron (named for the group of minerals of which it is typical) has twelve pentagonal faces, arranged in the same pattern as the faces of the regular dodecahedron. The faces of the pyritohedron are, however, not regular, so the pyritohedron is also not regular. Allotropes of boron and many boron compounds, such as boron carbide, include discrete B12 icosahedra within their crystal structures. Carborane acids also have molecular structures approximating regular icosahedra.\nIn the early 20th century, Ernst Haeckel described a number of species of Radiolaria, some of whose skeletons are shaped like various regular polyhedra. Examples include \"Circoporus octahedrus\", \"Circogonia icosahedra\", \"Lithocubus geometricus\" and \"Circorrhegma dodecahedra\". The shapes of these creatures should be obvious from their names.\nMany viruses, such as the herpes virus, have the shape of a regular icosahedron. Viral structures are built of repeated identical protein subunits and the icosahedron is the easiest shape to assemble using these subunits. A regular polyhedron is used because it can be built from a single basic unit protein used over and over again; this saves space in the viral genome.\nIn meteorology and climatology, global numerical models of atmospheric flow are of increasing interest which employ geodesic grids that are based on an icosahedron (refined by triangulation) instead of the more commonly used longitude/latitude grid. This has the advantage of evenly distributed spatial resolution without singularities (i.e. the poles) at the expense of somewhat greater numerical difficulty.\nGeometry of space frames is often based on platonic solids. In the MERO system, Platonic solids are used for naming convention of various space frame configurations. For example, O+T refers to a configuration made of one half of octahedron and a tetrahedron.\nSeveral Platonic hydrocarbons have been synthesised, including cubane and dodecahedrane.\nLiquid crystals with symmetries of Platonic solids.\nFor the intermediate material phase called liquid crystals, the existence of such symmetries was first proposed in 1981 by H. Kleinert and K. Maki.\nIn aluminum the icosahedral structure was discovered three years after this by Dan Shechtman, which earned him the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2011.\nIn culture.\nPlatonic solids are often used to make dice, because dice of these shapes can be made fair. 6-sided dice are very common, but the other numbers are commonly used in role-playing games. Such dice are commonly referred to as d\"n\" where \"n\" is the number of faces (d8, d20, etc.); see dice notation for more details.\nThese shapes frequently show up in other games or puzzles. Puzzles similar to a Rubik's Cube come in all five shapes \u2013 see magic polyhedra.\nArchitecture.\nArchitects liked the idea of Plato's timeless forms that can be seen by the soul in the objects of the material world, but turned these shapes into more suitable for construction sphere, cylinder, cone, and square pyramid. In particular, one of the leaders of neoclassicism, \u00c9tienne-Louis Boull\u00e9e, was preoccupied with the architects' version of \"Platonic solids\".\nRelated polyhedra and polytopes.\nUniform polyhedra.\nThere exist four regular polyhedra that are not convex, called Kepler\u2013Poinsot polyhedra. These all have icosahedral symmetry and may be obtained as stellations of the dodecahedron and the icosahedron.\nThe next most regular convex polyhedra after the Platonic solids are the cuboctahedron, which is a rectification of the cube and the octahedron, and the icosidodecahedron, which is a rectification of the dodecahedron and the icosahedron (the rectification of the self-dual tetrahedron is a regular octahedron). These are both \"quasi-regular\", meaning that they are vertex- and edge-uniform and have regular faces, but the faces are not all congruent (coming in two different classes). They form two of the thirteen Archimedean solids, which are the convex uniform polyhedra with polyhedral symmetry. Their duals, the rhombic dodecahedron and rhombic triacontahedron, are edge- and face-transitive, but their faces are not regular and their vertices come in two types each; they are two of the thirteen Catalan solids.\nThe uniform polyhedra form a much broader class of polyhedra. These figures are vertex-uniform and have one or more types of regular or star polygons for faces. These include all the polyhedra mentioned above together with an infinite set of prisms, an infinite set of antiprisms, and 53 other non-convex forms.\nThe Johnson solids are convex polyhedra which have regular faces but are not uniform. Among them are five of the eight convex deltahedra, which have identical, regular faces (all equilateral triangles) but are not uniform. (The other three convex deltahedra are the Platonic tetrahedron, octahedron, and icosahedron.)\nRegular tessellations.\nThe three regular tessellations of the plane are closely related to the Platonic solids. Indeed, one can view the Platonic solids as regular tessellations of the sphere. This is done by projecting each solid onto a concentric sphere. The faces project onto regular spherical polygons which exactly cover the sphere. Spherical tilings provide two infinite additional sets of regular tilings, the hosohedra, {2,\"n\"} with 2 vertices at the poles, and lune faces, and the dual dihedra, {\"n\",2} with 2 hemispherical faces and regularly spaced vertices on the equator. Such tesselations would be degenerate in true 3D space as polyhedra.\nEvery regular tessellation of the sphere is characterized by a pair of integers {\"p\",\u00a0\"q\"} with \u00a0+\u00a0\u00a0&gt;\u00a0. Likewise, a regular tessellation of the plane is characterized by the condition \u00a0+\u00a0\u00a0=\u00a0. There are three possibilities:\nIn a similar manner, one can consider regular tessellations of the hyperbolic plane. These are characterized by the condition \u00a0+\u00a0\u00a0&lt;\u00a0. There is an infinite family of such tessellations.\nHigher dimensions.\nIn more than three dimensions, polyhedra generalize to polytopes, with higher-dimensional convex regular polytopes being the equivalents of the three-dimensional Platonic solids.\nIn the mid-19th century the Swiss mathematician Ludwig Schl\u00e4fli discovered the four-dimensional analogues of the Platonic solids, called convex regular 4-polytopes. There are exactly six of these figures; five are analogous to the Platonic solids : 5-cell as {3,3,3}, 16-cell as {3,3,4}, 600-cell as {3,3,5}, tesseract as {4,3,3}, and 120-cell as {5,3,3}, and a sixth one, the self-dual 24-cell, {3,4,3}.\nIn all dimensions higher than four, there are only three convex regular polytopes: the simplex as {3,3...,3}, the hypercube as {4,3...,3}, and the cross-polytope as {3,3...,4}. In three dimensions, these coincide with the tetrahedron as {3,3}, the cube as {4,3}, and the octahedron as {3,4}.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The city is north of London, on the River Nene. As of the 2021 census, Peterborough had a population of 192,178, while the population of the district was 215,673. \nHuman settlement in the area began before the Bronze Age, as can be seen at the Flag Fen archaeological site to the east of the city centre. There is evidence of Roman occupation. The Anglo-Saxon period saw the establishment of a monastery, Medeshamstede, which later became Peterborough Cathedral. In the 19th century, the population grew rapidly after the coming of the railway. The area became known for its brickworks and engineering. After the Second World War, industrial employment fell and growth was limited until Peterborough was designated a new town in the 1960s. The main economic sectors now are financial services and distribution. \nThe city was the administrative centre of the Soke of Peterborough in the historic county of Northamptonshire, until the Soke was abolished in 1965. From 1965 to 1974, it formed part of the short-lived county of Huntingdon and Peterborough and since then has been part of Cambridgeshire. \nThe cathedral city of Ely is east-southeast across the Fens and the university city of Cambridge is to the southeast. The local topography is flat, and in places, the land lies \nbelow sea level.\nHistory.\nToponymy.\nThe original name of the town was Medeshamstede. The town's name changed to \"Burgh\" from the late tenth century, possibly after Abbot Kenulf had built a defensive wall around the abbey which was dedicated to Saint Peter; eventually this developed into the form Peterborough. In the 12th century, the town was also known as \"Gildenburgh\", which is found in the Peterborough version of the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\" (see Peterborough Chronicle below) and a history of the abbey by the monk Hugh Candidus. The town does not appear to have been a borough until at least the 12th century.\nEarly history.\nPeterborough and its surrounding areas around have been inhabited for thousands of years because it is where permanently drained land in The Fens is created by the River Nene. Remains of Iron Age settlement and what is thought to be religious activity can be seen at the Flag Fen archaeological site to the east of the city centre. The Romans established a fortified garrison town at Durobrivae on Ermine Street, to the west in Water Newton, around the middle of the 1st century AD. Durobrivae's earliest appearance among surviving records is in the Antonine Itinerary of the late 2nd century. There was also a large 1st century Roman fort at Longthorpe, designed to house half a legion, or about 3,000 soldiers; it may have been established as early as around AD\u00a044\u201348. Peterborough was an important area of ceramic production in the Roman period, providing Nene Valley Ware that was traded as far away as Cornwall and the Antonine Wall, Caledonia.\nPeterborough is shown by its original name Medeshamstede to have possibly been an Anglian settlement before AD\u00a0655, when Sexwulf founded a monastery on land granted to him for that purpose by Peada of Mercia, who converted to Christianity and was briefly ruler of the smaller Middle Angles sub-group. His brother Wulfhere murdered his own sons, similarly converted and then finished the monastery by way of atonement.\nHereward the Wake rampaged through the town in 1069 or 1070. Outraged, Abbot Turold erected a fort or castle, which, from his name, was called Mont Turold: this mound, or hill, is on the outside of the deanery garden, now called Tout Hill, although in 1848 Tot-hill or Toot Hill. The abbey church was rebuilt and greatly enlarged in the 12th century. The Peterborough Chronicle, a version of the Anglo-Saxon one, contains unique information about the history of England after the Norman conquest, written here by monks in the 12th century. This is the only known prose history in English between the conquest and the later 14th century. The burgesses received their first charter from \"Abbot Robert\" \u2013 probably Robert of Sutton (1262\u20131273). The place suffered materially in the war between King John and the confederate barons, many of whom took refuge in the monastery here and in Crowland Abbey, from which sanctuaries they were forced by the king's soldiers, who plundered the religious houses and carried off great treasures. The abbey church became one of Henry VIII's retained, more secular, cathedrals in 1541, having been assessed at the Dissolution as having revenue of \u00a31,972.7s.0\u00bed per annum.\nWhen civil war broke out, Peterborough was divided between supporters of King Charles I and the Long Parliament. The city lay on the border of the Eastern Association of counties which sided with Parliament, and the war reached Peterborough in 1643 when soldiers arrived in the city to attack Royalist strongholds at Stamford and Crowland. The Royalist forces were defeated within a few weeks and retreated to Burghley House, where they were captured and sent to Cambridge. While the Parliamentary soldiers were in Peterborough, however, they ransacked the cathedral, destroying the Lady Chapel, chapter house, cloister, high altar and choir stalls, as well as mediaeval decoration and records.\nAmong the privileges claimed by the abbot as early as the 13th century was that of having a prison for felons taken in the Soke of Peterborough, a liberty within Northamptonshire. This afforded it administrative and judicial independence from the rest of the county, with it having a quarter sessions separate from the rest of Northamptonshire from 1349. In 1576 Bishop Edmund Scambler sold the lordship of the hundred of \"Nassaburgh\", which was coextensive with the Soke, to Queen Elizabeth I, who gave it to Lord Burghley, and from that time until the 19th century he and his descendants, the Earls and Marquesses of Exeter, had a separate gaol for prisoners arrested in the Soke. The abbot formerly held four fairs, of which two, St. Peter's Fair, granted in 1189 and later held on the second Tuesday and Wednesday in July, and the Brigge Fair, granted in 1439 and later held on the first Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday in October, were purchased by the corporation from the Ecclesiastical Commissioners in 1876. The Bridge Fair, as it is now known, granted to the abbey by King Henry VI, survives. Prayers for the opening of the fair were once said at the morning service in the cathedral, followed by a civic proclamation and a sausage lunch at the town hall which still takes place. The mayor traditionally leads a procession from the town hall to the fair where the proclamation is read, asking all persons to \"behave soberly and civilly, and to pay their just dues and demands according to the laws of the realm and the rights of the City of Peterborough\".\nSecond World War.\nThere were 50 raids on the city, with seven houses destroyed. On January 15 1941 at 11pm, 5 high explosives landed near Walpole Street, one man was killed. On May 10 1941 at 3.35am, 4 high explosives landed near Priestgate, with two men killed; RAF Wittering was also bombed at around 3.15am.\nModern history.\nRailway lines began operating locally during the 1840s, but it was the 1850 opening of the Great Northern Railway's line from London to York that transformed Peterborough from a market town to an industrial centre. Lord Exeter had opposed the railway passing through Stamford, so Peterborough, situated between two main terminals at London and Doncaster, increasingly developed as a regional hub.\nCoupled with vast local clay deposits, the railway enabled large scale brickmaking and distribution to take place. The area was the UK's leading producer of bricks for much of the twentieth century. Brick-making had been a small seasonal craft since the early nineteenth century, but during the 1890s successful experiments at Fletton using the harder clays from a lower level had resulted in a much more efficient process. The market dominance during this period of the London Brick Company, founded by the prolific Scottish builder and architect John Cathles Hill, gave rise to some of the country's most well-known landmarks, all built using the ubiquitous Fletton Brick. Perkins Engines was established in Peterborough in 1932 by Frank Perkins, creator of the Perkins diesel engine. Thirty years later it employed more than a tenth of the population of Peterborough, mainly at Eastfield. Baker Perkins had relocated from London to Westwood, now the site of HM Prison Peterborough, in 1903, followed by Peter Brotherhood to Walton in 1906; both manufacturers of industrial machinery, they too became major employers in the city. British Sugar has moved its headquarters to Hampton from Woodston, the beet sugar factory, which opened there in 1926, was closed in 1991.\nOn August 22, 1956, much of the old city centre was destroyed by the Great Fire of Peterborough. The blaze started in the Robert Sayle shop on the corner of Cowgate and King Street and spread to a shoe shop, furniture store and the local fire station. It caused over \u00a3250,000 worth of damage and was extinguished with assistance from the USAF at Alconbury.\nThe Norwich and Peterborough (N&amp;P) was formed by the merger of the Norwich Building Society and the Peterborough Building Society in 1986. It was the ninth largest building society at the time of its merger into the Yorkshire Group in 2011. N&amp;P continued to operate under its own brand administered at Lynch Wood until 2018. Prior to merger with the Midlands Co-op in 2013, Anglia Regional, the UK's fifth largest co-operative society, was also based in Peterborough, where it was established in 1876. The combined society began trading as Central England Co-operative in 2014.\nDesignated a New Town in 1967, Peterborough Development Corporation was formed in partnership with the city and county councils to house London's overspill population in new townships sited around the existing urban area. There were to be four townships, one each at Bretton (originally to be called Milton, a hamlet in the Middle Ages), Orton, Paston/ Werrington and Castor. The last of these was never built, but a fourth, called Hampton, is now taking shape south of the city. It was decided that the city should have a major indoor shopping centre at its heart. Planning permission was received in late summer 1976 and Queensgate, containing over 90 stores and including parking for 2,300 cars, was opened by Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands in 1982. of urban roads were planned and a network of high-speed landscaped thoroughfares, known as parkways, was constructed.\nPeterborough's population grew by 45.4% between 1971 and 1991. New service sector companies like Thomas Cook and Pearl Assurance were attracted to the city, ending the dominance of the manufacturing industry as employers. An urban regeneration company named Opportunity Peterborough, under the chairmanship of Lord Mawhinney, was set up by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister in 2005 to oversee Peterborough's future development. Between 2006 and 2012 a \u00a31\u00a0billion redevelopment of the city centre and surrounding areas was planned. The master plan provided guidelines on the physical shaping of the city centre over the next 15\u201320 years. Proposals are still progressing for the north of Westgate, the south bank and the station quarter, where Network Rail is preparing a major mixed use development. Whilst recognising that the reconfiguration of the relationship between the city and station was critical, English Heritage found the current plans for Westgate unconvincing and felt more thought should be given to the vitality of the historic core.\nIn recent years Peterborough has undergone significant changes with numerous developments underway, most notably are Fletton Quays, a project to construct 350 apartments, various office spaces as well as a new home for Peterborough City Council with other projects within the development to include a Hilton Garden Inn hotel with a sky bar, a new passport office and various leisure, restaurant and retail opportunities. Other projects within the city include the extension to Queensgate Shopping Centre, The Great Northern Hotel and more recently plans to extend the railway station and long stay car park to facilitate more office space in the city centre and further parking.\nGovernance.\nThere is one main tier of local government covering Peterborough, at unitary authority level, being Peterborough City Council, which meets at Peterborough Town Hall and has its main offices at Sand Martin House on Bittern Way. The city council is also a member of the Cambridgeshire and Peterborough Combined Authority, led by the directly elected Mayor of Cambridgeshire and Peterborough.\nThe area governed by the city council is the district of Peterborough, which extends beyond the urban area of Peterborough itself to include surrounding villages and rural areas, particularly to the north-west and north-east. Peterborough's city status is formally held by the local government district rather than the urban area. Much of the Peterborough urban area is unparished, but some of the suburbs are included in civil parishes, including Bretton, Hampton Hargate and Vale, Orton Longueville, and Orton Waterville.\nAdministrative history.\nPeterborough was an ancient parish, which was historically in the Nassaburgh hundred of Northamptonshire. The parish was divided into five hamlets or townships: Dogsthorpe, Eastfield, Longthorpe, Newark and a Peterborough township covering the central part of the parish including the town. Within the Peterborough township was an extra-parochial area known as the Minster Precincts, covering St Peter's Abbey and its close. When the former abbey church became Peterborough Cathedral in 1541, Peterborough was thereafter deemed to be a city. The area originally holding city status was the Peterborough township plus the Minster Precincts.\nAlthough made a city in 1541, at that time Peterborough was not a borough (despite including the word in its name). Prior to the dissolution of the abbey in 1539, the abbey had been the manorial owner of the town; that ownership passed to the new cathedral authorities. A Peterborough constituency was also created in 1541, covering the same area as the city.\nIn 1790, a body of improvement commissioners was established to provide public services in the city. In 1874 Peterborough was incorporated as a municipal borough, with the commissioners replaced by an elected council initially comprising a mayor, six aldermen and eighteen councillors.\nThe municipal borough was abolished in 1974 when the modern district was created, being a lower tier non-metropolitan district, with the area also being transferred to Cambridgeshire at the same time. In 1998 the Peterborough district was removed from the non-metropolitan county of Cambridgeshire (the area governed by Cambridgeshire County Council) to become a unitary authority, whilst remaining part of the ceremonial county of Cambridgeshire for the purposes of lieutenancy and shrievalty.\nEconomy.\nRegeneration.\nFigures plotting growth from 1995 to 2004, revealed that Peterborough had become the most successful economy among unitary authorities in the East of England. They also revealed that the city's economy had grown faster than the regional average and any other economy in the region. It has a strong economy in the environmental goods and services sector and has the largest cluster of environmental businesses in the UK.\nIn 1994, Peterborough designated itself one of four environment cities in the UK and began working to become the country's acknowledged environment capital. Peterborough Environment City Trust (PECT), an independent charity, was set up at the same time to work towards this goal, delivering projects promoting healthier and sustainable living in the city. Until 2017, PECT organised a yearly 'Green Festival' centered around Cathedral Square, Peterborough, which also benefited local artists and arts organisations through attracting Arts Council funding grants aided by arts facilitator organisation Metal. During the summer of 2018 the last Green Festival was held at Nene Park, in 2019 Peterborough's community environmental projects attracted ministerial attention from the environment secretary Michael Gove. During the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020\u201321 Peterborough's culture and leisure umbrella charity, \"Vivacity\" ceased operating.\nThe council and regional development agency have taken advice on regeneration issues from a number of internationally recognised experts, including Benjamin Barber (formerly an adviser to President Bill Clinton), Jan Gustav Strandenaes (United Nations adviser on environmental issues) and Patama Roorakwit (a Thai \"community architect\").\nEmployment.\nAccording to the 2001 census, the workplace population of 90,656 is divided into 60,118 people who live in Peterborough and 30,358 people who commute in. A further 13,161 residents commute out of the city to work. Earnings in Peterborough are lower than average. Median earnings for full-time workers were \u00a311.93 per hour in 2014, less than the regional median for the East of England of \u00a313.62 and the median hourly rate of \u00a313.15 for Great Britain as a whole. As part of the government's M11 corridor, Peterborough is committed to creating 17,500 jobs with the population growing to 200,000 by 2020.\nFuture employment will also be created through the plan for the city centre launched by the council in 2003. Predictions of the levels and types of employment created were published in 2005. These include 1,421 jobs created in retail; 1,067 created in a variety of leisure and cultural developments; 338 in three hotels; and a further 4,847 jobs created in offices and other workspaces. Recent relocations of large employers include both Tesco (1,070 employees) and Debenhams (850 employees) distribution centres. A further 2,500 jobs were to be created in the \u00a3140\u00a0million Gateway warehouse and distribution park. This was expected to compensate for the 6,000 job losses as a result of the decline in manufacturing, anticipated in a report cited by the cabinet member for economic growth and regeneration in 2006.\nWith traditionally low levels of unemployment, Peterborough is a popular destination for workers and has seen significant growth through migration since the postwar period. The leader of the council said in August 2006 that he believed that 80% of the 65,000 people who had arrived in East Anglia from the states that joined the European Union in 2004 were living in Peterborough. To help cope with this influx, the council put forward plans to construct an average of 1,300 homes each year until 2021. Peterborough Trades Council, formed in 1898, is affiliated to the Trades Union Congress.\nTransport.\nRail.\nPeterborough railway station is a principal stop on the East Coast Main Line, 45\u201350 minutes' journey time from central London, with high-speed intercity services from King's Cross to Edinburgh Waverley operated by the London North Eastern Railway at around a 20-minute frequency. It is the northern terminus of slower commuter services from Horsham, via Gatwick Airport and central London, operated by Govia Thameslink Railway.\nIt is a major railway junction where a number of cross-country routes converge:\nWater.\nThe River Nene, made navigable from the port at Wisbech to Northampton by 1761, passes through the city centre. The Nene Viaduct carries the railway over the river. It was built in 1847 by Sir William and Joseph Cubitt. William Cubitt was the chief engineer of Crystal Palace erected at Hyde Park in 1851. Apart from some minor repairs in 1910 and 1914 (the steel bands and cross braces around the fluted legs) the bridge remains as Cubitts built it. Now a Grade II* listed structure, it is the oldest surviving cast iron railway bridge in the UK. By the Town Bridge, the Customs House, built in the early eighteenth century, is a visible reminder of the city's past function as an inland port. The Environment Agency navigation starts at the junction with the Northampton arm of the Grand Union Canal and extends for ending at Bevis Hall just upstream of Wisbech. The tidal limit used to be Woodston Wharf until the Dog-in-a-Doublet lock was built downstream in 1937.\nRoad.\nThe A1/A1(M) primary route (part of European route E15) broadly follows the path of the historic Great North Road from St Paul's Cathedral in the heart of London, passing Peterborough (Junction 17), and continuing north a further to central Edinburgh. In 1899 the British Electric Traction Company sought permission for a tramway joining the northern suburbs with the city centre. The system, which operated under the name Peterborough Electric Traction Company, opened in 1903 and was abandoned in favour of motor buses in 1930, when it was merged into the Eastern Counties Omnibus Company. Today, bus services in the city are operated by several companies including Stagecoach (formerly Cambus and Viscount) and Delaine Buses. Despite its large-scale growth, Peterborough has the fastest peak and off-peak travel times for a city of its size in the UK, due to the construction of the parkways. The Local Transport Plan anticipated expenditure totalling around \u00a3180\u00a0million for the period up to 2010 on major road schemes to accommodate development.\nThe combination of rail connections to the Port of Felixstowe and to the East Coast Main Line as well as a road connection via the A1(M) has led to Peterborough being proposed as the site of a rail-road logistics and distribution centre to be known as Magna Park.\nGreen Wheel and City Cycling.\nThe Peterborough Millennium Green Wheel is a network of cycleways, footpaths and bridleways which provide safe, continuous routes around the city with radiating spokes connecting to the city centre. The project has also created a sculpture trail, which provides functional, landscape artworks along the Green Wheel route and a Living Landmarks project involving the local community in the creation of local landscape features such as mini woodlands, ponds and hedgerows. Another long-distance footpath, the Hereward Way, runs from Oakham in Rutland, through Peterborough, to East Harling in Norfolk. While cycling within the city received a boost during the COVID-19 pandemic with the introduction of new cycle lanes in busy streets, plans to connect the villages to the west of Peterborough with a new cycle track have been refused permission and some cycle lane decisions have been reversed in the city centre during easing of the corona virus lockdowns.\nDemography.\nPopulation.\nThe City of Peterborough local authority area has a population of 223,655 (2024). It is forecast to reach 230,000 in 2031 and 240,000 by around 2041.\nPeterborough's population growth was reportedly the second fastest of any British city over the ten years from 2004 to 2013, driven partly by immigration.\nEthnicity.\nAccording to the 2011 census, 82.5% of Peterborough's residents categorised themselves as white, 2.8% of mixed ethnic groups, 11.7% Asian, 2.3% black and 0.8% other. Amongst the white population, the largest categories were indigenous groups, those being English/Welsh/Scottish/Northern Irish/British (70.9%), and other white (10.6%). Those of Pakistani ethnicity accounted for 6.6% of the population and those of Indian ethnicity 2.5.%. The largest black group were those of African ethnicity (1.4%).\nPeterborough is home to one of the largest concentrations of Italian immigrants in the UK. This is mainly as a result of labour recruitment in the 1950s by the London Brick Company in the southern Italian regions of Apulia and Campania. By 1960, approximately 3,000 Italian men were employed by London Brick, mostly at the Fletton works. In 1962, the Scalabrini Fathers, who first arrived in 1956, purchased an old school and converted it into a mission church named after the patron saint of workers Saint Joseph (San Giuseppe). By 1991, over 3,000 christenings of second-generation Italians had been carried out there. In 1996, it was estimated that the Italian community of Peterborough numbered 7,000, making it the third largest in the UK after London and Bedford. The 2011 Census recorded 1,179 residents born in Italy.\nIn the late twentieth century the main source of immigration was from new Commonwealth countries. The 2011 Census showed that a total of 24,166 migrants moved to Peterborough between 2001 and 2011. The city has experienced significant immigration from the A8 countries that joined the European Union in 2004, and in 2011, 14,134 residents of the city were people born in Central and Eastern Europe.\nAccording to a report published by the police in 2007, recent migration had resulted in increased translation costs and a change in the nature of crime in the county, with an increase in drink driving offences, knife crime and an international dimension added to activities such as running cannabis factories and human trafficking. The number of foreign nationals arrested in the north of the county rose from 894 in 2003, to 2,435 in 2006, but the report also said that \"inappropriately negative\" community perceptions about migrant workers often complicate routine incidents, raising tensions and turning them \"critical\". It also noted there was \"little evidence that the increased numbers of migrant workers have caused significant or systematic problems in respect of community safety or cohesion\". In 2007, Julie Spence, the then Chief Constable emphasised that the fact that the demographic profile of Cambridgeshire had changed dramatically from one where 95% of teenagers were white four years previously to one of the country's fastest growing diverse populations, and said it had a positive impact on development and jobs. In 2008, the BBC broadcast \"The Poles are Coming!\", a documentary on the impact of Polish migration to Peterborough by Tim Samuels, as part of its \"White Season\".\nThe number of languages in use is growing where previously few languages other than English were spoken. As of 2006[ [update]], Peterborough offered classes in Italian, Urdu and Punjabi in its primary schools.\nReligion.\nChristianity has the largest following in Peterborough, in particular the Church of England, with a significant number of parish churches and a cathedral. 56.7% of Peterborough's residents classified themselves as Christian in the 2011 Census. It was reported in 2007 that recent immigration to the city had also seen the Roman Catholic population increase substantially. Other denominations are also in evidence; the latest church to be constructed is a \u00a37\u00a0million \"superchurch,\" KingsGate, formerly Peterborough Community Church, which can seat up to 1,800 worshippers. In comparison with the rest of England, Peterborough has a lower proportion of Christians, Buddhists, Hindus, Jews and Sikhs. The city has a higher percentage of Muslims than England as a whole (9.4% compared to 5% nationally). The majority of Muslims reside in the Millfield, West Town and New England areas of the city, where two large mosques (including the Faidhan-e-Madina Mosque and Husaini Islamic Center-Peterborough) are based. Peterborough also has both Hindu (Bharat Hindu Samaj) and Sikh (Singh Sabha Gurdwara) temples in these areas.\nThe Anglican Diocese of Peterborough covers roughly , including the whole of Northamptonshire, Rutland and the Soke of Peterborough. The parts of the city that lie south of the river, which were historically in Huntingdonshire, fall within the Diocese of Ely, which covers the remainder of Cambridgeshire and western Norfolk. The current Bishop of Peterborough has been appointed Assistant Bishop in the Diocese of Ely, with pastoral care for these parishes delegated to her by the Bishop of Ely. The city falls wholly within the Roman Catholic Diocese of East Anglia (which has its seat at the Cathedral Church of Saint John the Baptist, Norwich) and is served by Saint Peter and All Souls Church, built in 1896 and decorated in the Gothic style. The Greek Orthodox Community of Saint Cyril, Patriarch of Jerusalem was established in 1991 under the Orthodox Archdiocese of Thyateira and Great Britain.\nCulture.\nEducation.\nPeterborough has one independent boarding school: The Peterborough School at Westwood House, founded in 1895. The school caters for girls and now boys up to the age of 18. Peterborough's state schools have recently undergone significant change. Five of the city's fifteen secondary schools were closed in July 2007, to be demolished over the coming years. John Mansfield (now an adult learning centre), Hereward (formerly Eastholm, now City of Peterborough Academy, sponsored by the Greenwood Dale Foundation Trust) and Deacon's were replaced with the flagship Thomas Deacon Academy, designed by Lord Foster of Thames Bank which opened in September 2007.\nQueen Katharine Academy (previously The Voyager School), which has specialist media arts status, replaced Bretton Woods and Walton Community School. It is part of the Thomas Deacon Education Trust. The schools that remain have been extended and enlarged. Over \u00a3200\u00a0million was spent and the changes on-going to 2010. The King's School is one of seven schools established, or in some cases re-endowed and renamed, by King Henry VIII during the dissolution of the monasteries to pray for his soul. In 2006, 39.4% of Peterborough local education authority pupils attained five grades A* to C, including English and Mathematics, in the General Certificate of Secondary Education, lower than the national average of 45.8%.\nThe city has two colleges of further and higher education, Peterborough College (established in 1946 as Peterborough Technical College) and City College Peterborough (known as Peterborough College of Adult Education until 2010). By 2004, Peterborough College attracted over 15,000 students each year from the UK and abroad and was ranked in the top five per cent of colleges in the UK. Greater Peterborough University Technical College is a new education facility set to open in September 2015.\nIn 2020, planning permission was granted for a new university campus, ARU Peterborough, which subsequently opened its doors in September 2022 on Bishops Road, a five-minute walk from the City Centre. It is operated by Anglia Ruskin University with four faculties: Business, Innovation and Entrepreneurship; Creative and Digital Arts and Sciences; Agriculture, Environment and Sustainability; Health and Education. The new campus took its first cohort of students in 2022, expecting to recruit up to 12,500 by 2028. ARU Peterborough is not expected to receive independent degree awarding powers before 2030, when a review is to take place to determine its future as part of Anglia Ruskin University or whether it should become an independent entity. \nThe former public library on Broadway was funded by Scottish philanthropist Andrew Carnegie and opened in 1906; Carnegie was made first freeman of the city on the day of the opening ceremony.\nArts.\nPeterborough enjoys a wide range of events including the annual East of England Show, Peterborough Festival and CAMRA beer festival, which takes place on the river embankment in late August. The yearly festivals have attracted arts funding and enabled further community projects within the city. Nationally published cartoonist John Elson, from Peterborough, has provided imagery for many of the events.\nThe city acts as the central hub for the region's visual arts community, with the Peterborough Artists Open Studio organisation (PAOS), celebrating its 21st anniversary year as of 2021. A number of statues by the British sculptor Antony Gormley were re-installed in the city in 2018. Removed for repair works from their original setting on concrete pillars next to the rowing lake in Nene Park, they can now be seen on top of buildings surrounding Cathedral Square in the town centre.\nThe Key Theatre, built in 1973, is situated on the embankment, next to the River Nene. The theatre aims to provide entertainment, enlightenment and education by reflecting the rich culture Peterborough has to offer. The programme is made up of home-grown productions, national touring shows, local community productions and one-off concerts. There is disabled access, an infrared hearing system for the deaf and hard of hearing and there are also regular signed performances.\nIn 1937, the Odeon Cinema opened on Broadway, where it operated successfully for more than half a century. In 1991, the Odeon showed its last film to the public and was left to fall into a state of disrepair, until 1997, when a local entrepreneur purchased the building as part of a larger project, including a restaurant and art gallery. The Broadway, designed by Tim Foster Architects, was one of the largest theatres in the region and offered a selection of live entertainment, including music, comedy and films. In 2009, it was severely damaged by arsonists, resulting in closure when its insurers refused to pay the claim due to faulty fire detection systems.\nThe Embassy Theatre, a large Art Deco building designed by David Evelyn Nye, also opened on Broadway in 1937. Nye was usually a cinema architect, and this was his only theatre. The Embassy was converted into a cinema in 1953, becoming the ABC and later the Cannon Cinema, before it was closed in 1989. Since 1996, the premises have been occupied by the Edwards bar chain.\nThe John Clare Theatre within the new central library, again on Broadway, is home to the Peterborough Film Society. One of the region's leading venues, the Cresset in Bretton, provides a wide range of events for the residents of the city and beyond, including theatre, comedy, music and dance. Peterborough has a 13-screen Showcase Cinema, an ice rink and two indoor swimming pools open to the general public.\nA diverse range of restaurants can be found throughout the city, including Chinese, Indian, Thai and many Italian restaurants. Peterborough has recently been used as the setting in popular literature: \"A Short History of Tractors in Ukrainian\" by Marina Lewycka, \"A Spot of Bother\" by Mark Haddon and, the first in a projected series, \"Long Way Home\", a debut novel by Eva Doran.\nSport.\nPeterborough United Football Club, known as \"The Posh\", has been the local football team since 1934. They play their home matches at London Road on the south bank of the River Nene. Peterborough United have a history of cup giant-killings. They set the record for the highest number of league goals (134, Terry Bly alone scoring 52) in the 1960\u201361 season, when they won the Fourth Division title in their first season in the Football League. The club's highest finish position to date was 10th place in Division One, then the second tier of English football, in the 1992\u201393 season. Irish property developer Darragh MacAnthony was appointed chairman in 2006 and is now owner, having undertaken a lengthy purchase from Barry Fry who remains director of football, having also been manager of the club from 1996 to 2005. Peterborough also has a non-league club, Peterborough Sports, who play in the National League North.\nAs well as football, Peterborough has teams competing in rugby, cricket, hockey, ice hockey, rowing, athletics, American and Australian rules football. Although Cambridgeshire is not a first-class cricket county, Northamptonshire staged some home matches in the city between 1906 and 1974. Peterborough Town Cricket Club and the City of Peterborough Hockey Club compete at their shared ground in Westwood.\nAfter reforming in 2005, rugby union club Peterborough Lions RFC now compete in National League 3 Midlands. Meanwhile, the city's oldest rugby team, Peterborough RUFC, play at Second Drove (otherwise known as \"Fortress Fengate\"), and have struggled in recent seasons. Relegation in 2013\u201314 season, from Midlands 1 East, has been followed by a season in the lower-mid table of the Midlands 2 East (South).\nPeterborough City Rowing Club moved from its riverside setting to the current Thorpe Meadows location in 1983. The spring and summer regattas held there attract rowers and scullers from competing clubs all over the country. Every February the adjacent River Nene is host to the head of the river race, which again attracts hundreds of entries. Peterborough Athletic Club train and compete at the embankment athletics arena. In 2006, after 10 years, the Great Eastern Run returned to the racing calendar. Around 3,000 runners raced through the flat streets of Peterborough for the half-marathon, supported by thousands of spectators along the course.\nPeterborough Phantoms are the city's ice hockey team, playing in the NIHL at Planet Ice Peterborough, located on Mallard Way in Bretton. Motorcycle speedway is also a popular sport in Peterborough, with race meetings held at the East of England Showground. The team, known as the Peterborough Panthers, have operated regularly in the Elite League. The Showground hosts the annual British Motorcycle Federation Rally each May. In 2009, Peterborough hosted one of the first rounds of the Tour Series, a new series of televised town and city centre cycling races. As of 2015[ [update]], the city has hosted a round of the Tour Series each year since, with the exception of 2013.\nIn March 2017 the first bandy session in England for over a century was held in Peterborough, in the form of rink bandy.\nIn 2018 Peterborough Bandy Club was founded. At the 2022 Women's Bandy World Championship Great Britain made its debut in the tournament, represented by a Peterborough team.\nMedia.\nThere is a major radio transmitter at Morborne, approximately west of Peterborough, for national FM radio (BBC Radios 1\u20134 and Classic FM) and BBC Radio Cambridgeshire which is the BBC Local Radio station that covers the city. This facility includes a high guyed radio mast which collapsed in 2004 after a fire and has since been re-built. Another transmission site at Gunthorpe in the north east of the city transmits AM/MW and local FM radio. The site is only above sea level and has an high active insulated guyed mast situated on it. \nThe national commercial multiplex, Digital One, is also available in the city. \nPeterborough is covered by six local radio stations and one regional station, though only two community stations broadcast from the city. These are Salaam FM, catering for the local Muslim population, which started broadcasting on 106.2\u00a0MHz in 2016 and Peterborough Community Radio (PCR FM), a station formed as a result of a merger between former internet stations Peterborough FM and Radio Peterborough, which started broadcasting on 103.2\u00a0MHz in 2017.\nHeart Cambridgeshire (now Heart East), the original independent local radio station launched as Hereward Radio in 1980 and becoming Heart Peterborough in 2009, still holds a large section of the market on 102.7\u00a0MHz but relocated to Cambridge in 2012, where it began sharing the localised programming (of mainly national output) with Heart Cambridge. Hereward's sister station, WGMS, was launched on the old 1332\u00a0kHz (225 meters) frequency in 1992; known as Classic Gold from 1994 to 2007, it is now part of Heart's sister Gold Radio network, but has no programming made in Peterborough. Connect Radio (from 1999 to 2010, known as Lite FM), was the city's second commercial station on 106.8;MHz, but was sold and rebranded as Smooth East Midlands on 1 October 2019.\nLocal TV coverage is provided by \"BBC Look East\" and \"ITV News Anglia\". \nThe \"Peterborough Telegraph\" (established 1948) is the city's newspaper. The \"Telegraph\" is owned by National World Publishing Ltd. Its website, Peterborough Today, is updated six days a week. The \"PT's\" sister paper, the \"Peterborough Citizen\" (1898), was a weekly paper delivered free to many homes in the city. The \"Peterborough Herald and Post\" (1989, a replacement for the \"Peterborough Standard\", established 1872) ceased publication in 2008. The publisher Emap, which specialises in the production of magazines and the organisation of business events and conferences, traces its origins back to Peterborough in 1854. The 33rd Mayor of Peterborough, Sir Richard Winfrey , founder of what would become the East Midland Allied Press, was perhaps the last person to read the Riot Act in 1914.\nPeterborough has been used as a location for various television programmes and films. The 1982 BBC production of \"The Barchester Chronicles\" was filmed largely in and around Peterborough. In 1983 opening scenes for the 13th James Bond film, \"Octopussy\", starring Sir Roger Moore, were filmed at Orton Mere. A music video for the song \"BreakThru\" by the band Queen was also shot on the preserved Nene Valley Railway in 1989. In 1995 Pierce Brosnan filmed train crash sequences for the 17th Bond film, \"GoldenEye\", at the former sugar beet factory. A scene for the film \"The Da Vinci Code\" was filmed at Burghley House during five weeks' secret filming in 2006; and actor, Lee Marvin, found himself camping in Ferry Meadows during the filming of \"\" in 1985. In October 2008 Hollywood returned to Wansford for the filming of the musical \"Nine\", starring Pen\u00e9lope Cruz and Daniel Day-Lewis.\nLandmarks.\nPeterborough Cathedral, formally the Cathedral Church of Saint Peter, Saint Paul and Saint Andrew, whose statues look down from the three high gables of the West Front, was founded as a monastery in AD\u00a0655 and re-built in its present form between 1118 and 1238. It has been the seat of the Bishop of Peterborough since the diocese was created in 1541, when the last abbot was made the first bishop and the abbot's house was converted into the episcopal palace. Peterborough Cathedral is one of the most intact large Norman buildings in England and is renowned for its imposing early English Gothic West Front which, with its three enormous arches, is without architectural precedent and with no direct successor. The cathedral has the distinction of having had two queens buried beneath its paving: Catherine of Aragon and Mary, Queen of Scots. The remains of Queen Mary were removed to Westminster Abbey by her son James I when he became King of England.\nThe general layout of Peterborough is attributed to Martin de Vecti who, as abbot from 1133 to 1155, rebuilt the settlement on dry limestone to the west of the monastery, rather than the often-flooded marshlands to the east. Abbot Martin was responsible for laying out the market place and the wharf beside the river. Peterborough's 17th-century Guildhall was built in 1671 by John Lovin, who also restored the bishop's palace shortly after the restoration of King Charles II. It stands on columns, providing an open ground floor for the butter and poultry markets which used to be held there. The Market Place was renamed Cathedral Square and the adjacent Gates Memorial Fountain moved to Bishop's Road Gardens in 1963, when the (then weekly) market was transferred to the site of the old cattle market.\nPeterscourt on City Road was designed by Sir George Gilbert Scott in 1864, housing St. Peter's Teacher Training College for men until 1938. The building is mainly listed for the 18th century doorway, brought from the London Guildhall following war damage. Nearby Tout Hill, the site of a castle bailey, is a scheduled monument. The city has a large Victorian park containing formal gardens, children's play areas, an aviary, bowling green, tennis courts, pitch and putt course and tea rooms. The Park has been awarded the Green Flag Award, the national standard for parks and green spaces, by the Civic Trust. A Cross of Sacrifice was erected in Broadway cemetery by the Imperial War Graves Commission in the early 1920s. The Lido, a striking building with elements of art deco design, was opened in 1936 and is one of the few survivors of its type still in use.\nPeterborough Museum and Art Gallery, built in 1816, housed the city's first infirmary from 1857 to 1928. The museum has a collection of some 227,000 objects, including local archaeology and social history, from the products of the Roman pottery industry to Britain's oldest known murder victim; a collection of marine fossil remains from the Jurassic period of international importance; the manuscripts of John Clare, the \"Northamptonshire Peasant Poet\" as he was commonly known in his own time; and the Norman Cross collection of items made by French prisoners of war. These prisoners were kept at Norman Cross on the outskirts of Peterborough from 1797 to 1814, in what is believed to be the world's first purpose-built prisoner of war camp. The art collection contains an impressive variety of paintings, prints and drawings dating from the 1600s to the present day. Peterborough Museum also holds regular temporary exhibitions, weekend events and guided tours.\nBurghley House to the north of Peterborough, near Stamford, was built and mostly designed by Sir William Cecil, later 1st Baron Burghley, who was Lord High Treasurer to Queen Elizabeth I for most of her reign. The country house, with a park laid out by Lancelot 'Capability' Brown in the 18th century, is one of the principal examples of 16th-century English architecture. The estate, still home to his descendants, hosts the Burghley Horse Trials, an annual three-day event. Another Grade I listed building, Milton Hall near Castor, ancestral home of the Barons and later Earls Fitzwilliam, also dates from the same period. For two centuries following the restoration the city was a pocket borough of this family.\nThe John Clare Cottage in the village of Helpston was purchased by the John Clare Trust in 2005. The cottage, home of John Clare from his birth in 1793 until 1832, has been restored using traditional building methods to create a resource where visitors can learn about the poet, his works and how rural people lived in the early 19th century. The John Clare Cottage and Thorney Heritage Museum form part of the Greater Fens Museum Partnership, along with Peterborough Museum and Flag Fen.\nLongthorpe Tower, a 14th-century three-storey tower and fortified manor house in the care of English Heritage, is situated about west of the city centre. It is a scheduled monument, and contains the finest and most complete set of domestic paintings of their period in northern Europe. Nearby Thorpe Hall is one of the few mansions built in the Commonwealth period. A maternity hospital from 1943 to 1970, it was acquired by the Sue Ryder Foundation in 1986 and is currently in use as a hospice.\nFlag Fen, the Bronze Age archaeological site, was discovered in 1982, when a team led by Dr Francis Pryor carried out a survey of dykes in the area. Probably religious, it comprises a large number of poles arranged in five long rows, connecting Whittlesey with Peterborough across the wet fenland. The museum exhibits many of the artefacts found, including what is believed to be the oldest wheel in Britain. An exposed section of the Roman road known as the Fen Causeway also crosses the site.\nThe Nene Valley Railway, which is now a heritage railway, was one of the last passenger lines to fall under the Beeching Axe in 1966, although it remained open for freight traffic until 1972. In 1974, the former development corporation bought the line, which runs from the city centre to Yarwell Junction just west of Wansford via Orton Mere and the Ferry Meadows country park, and leased it to the Peterborough Railway Society. Railworld is a railway museum located beside Peterborough Nene Valley railway station.\nThe Nene Park, which opened in 1978, covers a site long, from slightly west of Castor to the centre of Peterborough. The park has three lakes, one of which houses a watersports centre. Ferry Meadows, one of the major destinations and attractions signposted on the Green Wheel, occupies a large portion of Nene Park. Orton Mere provides access to the east of the park.\nSouthey Wood, once included in the Royal Forest of Rockingham, is a mixed woodland maintained by the Forestry Commission between the villages of Upton and Ufford. Nearby, Castor Hanglands, Barnack Hills and Holes and Bedford Purlieus national nature reserves are each sites of special scientific interest. In 2002, the Hills and Holes, one of Natural England's 35 spotlight reserves, was designated a special area of conservation as part of the Natura 2000 network of sites throughout the European Union.\nBefore 1950.\nThe utilitarian philosopher, Dr Richard Cumberland, was 14th Lord Bishop of Peterborough from 1691 until his death in 1718; and Norfolk-born nurse and humanitarian, Edith Cavell, who received part of her education at Laurel Court in the Minster Precinct, is commemorated by a plaque in the cathedral and by the name of the hospital. A gravedigger called Old Scarlett, whose portrait can be seen above the west door of Peterborough Cathedral, is considered a folk hero. He died in 1594 at the age of 98, having spent much of his life as the sexton at Peterborough Cathedral; having buried two monarchs, he has also been suggested as the inspiration for the gravedigger in Shakespeare's \"Hamlet\". Two prominent historical figures were born locally, Hereward the Wake, an outlaw who led resistance to the Norman Conquest and now lends his name to several places and businesses in the city; and St. John Payne, one of the group of prominent Catholics martyred between 1535 and 1679 and later designated the Forty Martyrs of England and Wales, who was beatified by Pope Leo XIII in 1886 and canonised with the other 39 by Pope Paul VI in 1970.\nPeterborough is the birthplace of many notable people, the astronomer George Alcock, one of the most successful visual discoverers of novas and comets; John Clare, from Helpston, the nineteenth century poet; artist, Christopher Perkins \u2013 brother of Frank; and Sir Henry Royce, 1st Baronet of Seaton, engineer and co-founder of Rolls-Royce. Physician, actor and author, \"Sir\" John Hill, credited with 76 separate works in the \"Dictionary of National Biography\", the most valuable of which dealing with botany, is also said to have been born here. The socialist writer and illustrator, Frank Horrabin, who was born in the city, and was elected as the Labour Member of Parliament in 1929.\nAfter 1950.\nMusicians include Sir Thomas Armstrong, organist, conductor and former principal of the Royal Academy of Music; Andy Bell, lead vocalist of the electronic pop duo Erasure; Barrie Forgie, leader of the BBC Big Band; Don Lusher, trombonist and former professor of the Royal College of Music and the Royal Marines School of Music; Paul Nicholas, actor and singer; Maxim Reality and Gizz Butt of The Prodigy and Aston Merrygold of Brit Award-winning pop group JLS. Comedian Ernie Wise lived on Thorpe Avenue for many years, next door to Canadian baritone and actor Edmund Hockridge. Jimmy Savile also lived in the city in the early 1990s.\nOther media personalities include actors Simon Bamford, known for the 'Hellraiser' franchise, Adrian Lyne, director of \"Fatal Attraction\", Oscar Jacques, known for playing Tom Tupper in the CBBC Series \"M.I. High\", Luke Pasqualino, known for his roles in \"Skins\" and \"The Musketeers\"; television presenter, Sarah Cawood, who grew up in Maxey; BBC Formula One presenter, Jake Humphrey; football journalist and Talksport radio presenter, Adrian Durham; and the biologist, author and broadcaster, Prof. Brian J. Ford, who attended the King's School and still lives in Eastrea near Whittlesey. Local businessman, Peter Boizot, founder of the Pizza Express restaurant chain and Deputy Lieutenant of Cambridgeshire, has supported the cultural and sporting life of Peterborough and received its highest accolade, the freedom of the city. The thalidomide victim Terry Wiles, subject of the 1979 film \"On Giant's Shoulders\", was born in the city.\nIn the sporting world, former Tottenham Hotspur and England footballer, David Bentley, was born in the city, as was Louis Smith, who at the 2008 games became Great Britain's first gymnast to win an individual Olympic medal in a century. Chelsea Football player, currently on loan at Luton Town footballer Isaiah Brown, was born in Peterborough, before joining Leicester City and later West Bromwich Albion, becoming the second youngest player to play in the Premier League. Harry Wells, a rugby union player for Leicester Tigers in Premiership Rugby, was born in Peterborough and attended The King's (The Cathedral) School.\nGeography.\nClimate.\nAccording to the K\u00f6ppen classification the British Isles experience a maritime climate characterised by relatively cool summers and mild winters. Compared with other parts of the country, East Anglia is slightly warmer and sunnier in the summer and colder and frostier in the winter. Owing to its inland position, furthest from the landfall of most Atlantic depressions, Cambridgeshire is one of the driest counties in the UK, receiving, on average, around of rain per year. The Met Office weather station at Wittering, within the unitary authority of Peterborough, recorded a maximum temperature of on 19 July 2022. The lowest temperature in recent years was during February 2012.\nTopography.\nEast Anglia is most notable for being almost flat (it is mainly on a floodplain). During the Ice Age much of the region was covered by ice sheets and this has influenced the topography and nature of the soils. Much of Cambridgeshire is low-lying, in some places below present-day mean sea level. The lowest point on land is supposedly just to the south of the city at Holme Fen, which is below sea level. The largest of the many settlements along the Fen edge, Peterborough has been called the \"Gateway to the Fens\". Before they were drained the Fens were liable to periodic flooding so arable farming was limited to the higher areas of the Fen edge, with the rest of the Fenland dedicated to pastoral farming. In this way, the mediaeval and early modern Fens stood in contrast to the rest of southern England, which was primarily arable. Since the advent of modern drainage in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries the Fens have been radically transformed such that arable farming has almost entirely replaced pastoral. The unitary authority extends north west to the settlements of Wothorpe and Wittering and east beyond Thorney into the historic Isle of Ely and includes the Ortons, south of the River Nene. It borders Northamptonshire to the west, Lincolnshire to the north, and the Cambridgeshire districts of Fenland and Huntingdonshire to the south and east. The city centre is located at 52\u00b035'N latitude 0\u00b015'W longitude or Ordnance Survey national grid reference TL\u00a0185\u00a0998.\nUrban areas\n\"Townships are in bold type. In addition to the surrounding villages, Bretton, Orton Longueville and Orton Waterville are parished. The city council also works closely with Werrington neighbourhood association which operates on a similar basis to a parish council.\"\nBretton \u2013 Dogsthorpe \u2013 Eastfield \u2013 Eastgate \u2013 Fengate \u2013 Fletton \u2013 Gunthorpe \u2013 The Hamptons \u2013 Longthorpe \u2013 Millfield \u2013 Netherton \u2013 Newark \u2013 New England \u2013 The Ortons \u2013 Parnwell \u2013 Paston \u2013 Ravensthorpe \u2013 Stanground \u2013 Walton \u2013 Werrington \u2013 West Town \u2013 Westwood \u2013 Woodston\nRural areas\n\"Civil parishes do not cover the whole of England and mostly exist in rural hinterland.

The city falls just north of the A vowel isogloss and as such most native speakers will use the flat A, as found in \"cat\", in words such as \"last\". \"Yod\"-dropping is often heard from Peterborians, as in the rest of East Anglia, for example \"new\" as . However, the large number of newcomers has impacted greatly on the English spoken by the younger generation. Common so-called Estuary English features such as \"L\"-vocalisation, T glottalisation and \"Th\"-fronting give today's Peterborough accent a definite south-eastern sound.\nAffiliations.\nTown twinning started in Europe after the Second World War. Its purpose was to promote friendship and greater understanding between the people of different European cities. A twinning link is a formal, long-term friendship agreement involving co-operation between two communities in different countries and endorsed by both local authorities. The two communities organise projects and activities addressing a range of issues and develop an understanding of historical, cultural, lifestyle similarities and differences. Peterborough is twinned with the following municipalities:\nBourges and Forl\u00ec are also twinned with each other. The city also has more informal friendship links with Foggia, Italy; Kwe Kwe, Zimbabwe; P\u00e9cs, Hungary; and all Peterboroughs around the world. The county of Cambridgeshire has been twinned with Kreis Viersen, Germany since 1983.\nPaleontology.\nFossils of a hybodontiform fish \"Planohybodus\" were found in the Callovian (Middle Jurassic) deposits near Peterborough. The type species \"Planohybodus peterboroughensis\" was named after Peterborough in 2008.\nFreedom of the City.\nThe following people, military units and organisations and groups have received the Freedom of the City of Peterborough.\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "23914", "revid": "10202399", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23914", "title": "Polyphemus", "text": "Son of Poseidon and Thoosa in Greek mythology\nPolyphemus (; , ; ) is the one-eyed giant son of Poseidon and Thoosa in Greek mythology, one of the Cyclopes described in Homer's \"Odyssey\". His name means \"abounding in songs and legends\", \"many-voiced\" or \"very famous\". Polyphemus first appeared as a savage man-eating giant in the ninth book of the \"Odyssey\". The satyr play \"Cyclops\" by Euripides is dependent on this episode apart from one detail: Polyphemus is made a pederast in the play. Later Classical writers presented him in their poems as heterosexual and linked his name with the nymph Galatea. Often he was portrayed as unsuccessful in these, and as unaware of his disproportionate size and musical failings. In the work of even later authors, however, he is presented as both a successful lover and skilled musician. From the Renaissance on, art and literature reflect all of these interpretations of the giant.\nOdysseus and Polyphemus.\nAncient sources.\nIn Homer's epic, Odysseus lands on the island of the Cyclopes during his journey home from the Trojan War and, together with some of his men, enters a cave filled with provisions. When the giant Polyphemus returns home with his flocks, he blocks the entrance with a great stone and, scorning the usual custom of hospitality, eats two of the men. Next morning, the giant kills and eats two more and leaves the cave to graze his sheep.\nAfter the giant returns in the evening and eats two more of the men, Odysseus offers Polyphemus some strong and undiluted wine given to him earlier on his journey. Drunk and unwary, the giant asks Odysseus his name, promising him a guest-gift if he answers. Odysseus tells him \"\u039f\u1f56\u03c4\u03b9\u03c2\", which means \"nobody\" and Polyphemus promises to eat this \"Nobody\" last of all. With that, he falls into a drunken sleep. Odysseus takes a wooden stake he had earlier hardened in the fire, returns it to the fire until it is glowing hot, and drives it into Polyphemus's eye. When Polyphemus shouts for help from his fellow giants, saying that \"Nobody\" has hurt him, they think Polyphemus is being afflicted by divine power and recommend prayer as the answer.\nIn the morning, the blind Cyclops lets the sheep out to graze, feeling their backs to ensure that the men are not escaping. However, Odysseus and his men have tied themselves to the undersides of the animals and so get away. As he sails off with his men, Odysseus boastfully reveals his real name, an act of hubris that was to cause problems for him later. Polyphemus prays to his father, Poseidon, for revenge and casts huge rocks towards the ship, which Odysseus barely escapes.\nThe story reappears in later Classical literature. In \"Cyclops\", the 5th-century BC play by Euripides, a chorus of satyrs offers comic relief from the grisly story of how Polyphemus is punished for his impious behaviour in not respecting the rites of hospitality. In this play, Polyphemus claims to be a pederast, revealing to Odysseus that he takes more pleasure in boys than in women, and tries to take the satyr Silenus, whom he kept together with his sons as slaves on Mount Etna in Sicily, calling him \"my Ganymede\". The scene is infused with low comedy, specifically from the chorus, and Polyphemus is made to look silly: he is drunk when he explains his sexual desire, Silenus is too old to play the part of the young lover, and he himself will be subjected to penetration\u2014with the wooden spike.\nIn his Latin epic, Virgil describes how Aeneas observes blind Polyphemus as he leads his flocks down to the sea. They have encountered Achaemenides, who re-tells the story of how Odysseus and his men escaped, leaving him behind. The giant is described as descending to the shore, using a \"lopped pine tree\" as a walking staff. Once Polyphemus reaches the sea, he washes his oozing, bloody eye socket and groans painfully. Achaemenides is taken aboard Aeneas's vessel and they cast off with Polyphemus in chase. His great roar of frustration brings the rest of the Cyclopes down to the shore as Aeneas draws away in fear.\nArtistic representations.\nThe blinding of Polyphemus and the ruse by which Odysseus and his men escaped his cave are the only two scenes from the Odyssey shown on vases surviving from the seventh century BC (later pottery shows a much wider variety of scenes from the Odyssey). One such episode, on a vase featuring the hero carried beneath a sheep, was used on a 27 drachma Greek postage stamp in 1983. \nThe blinding was depicted in life-size sculpture, including a giant Polyphemus, in the Sperlonga sculptures probably made for the Emperor Tiberius. This may be an interpretation of an existing composition, and was apparently repeated in variations in later Imperial palaces by Claudius, Nero and at Hadrian's Villa.\nOf the European painters of the subject, the Flemish Jacob Jordaens depicted Odysseus escaping from the cave of Polyphemus in 1635 (see gallery below) and others chose the dramatic scene of the giant casting boulders at the escaping ship. In Guido Reni's painting of 1639/40 (see above), the furious giant is tugging a boulder from the cliff as Odysseus and his men row out to the ship far below. Polyphemus is portrayed, as it often happens, with two empty eye sockets and his damaged eye located in the middle on his forehead. This convention goes back to Greek statuary and painting, and is reproduced in Johann Heinrich Wilhelm Tischbein's 1802 head and shoulders portrait of the giant (see below).\nArnold B\u00f6cklin pictures the giant as standing on rocks onshore and swinging one of them back as the men row desperately over a surging wave (see below), while Polyphemus is standing at the top of a cliff in Jean-L\u00e9on G\u00e9r\u00f4me's painting of 1902. He stands poised, having already thrown one stone, which barely misses the ship. The reason for his rage is depicted in J. M. W. Turner's painting, \"Ulysses Deriding Polyphemus\" (1829). Here the ship sails forward as the sun breaks free of clouds low on the horizon. The giant himself is an indistinct shape barely distinguished from the woods and smoky atmosphere high above.\nPossible origins.\nFolktales similar to that of Homer's Polyphemus are a widespread phenomenon throughout the ancient world. In 1857, Wilhelm Grimm collected versions in Serbian, Romanian, Estonian, Finnish, Russian, German, and others; versions in Basque, S\u00e1mi, Lithuanian, Gascon, Syriac, and Celtic are also known. More than two hundred different versions have been identified, from around twenty five nations, covering a geographic region extending from Iceland, Ireland, England, Portugal and Africa to Arabia, Turkey, Russia, and Korea. The consensus of current modern scholarship is that these \"Polyphemus legends\" preserve traditions predating Homer.\nPolyphemus and Galatea.\nAncient sources.\nPhiloxenus of Cythera.\nWriting more than three centuries after the Odyssey is thought to have been composed, Philoxenus of Cythera took up the myth of Polyphemus in his poem \"Cyclops\" or \"Galatea\". The poem was written to be performed as a dithyramb, of which only fragments have survived, and was perhaps the first to provide a female love interest for the Cyclops. The object of Polyphemus's romantic desire is a sea nymph named Galatea. In the poem, Polyphemus is not a cave dwelling, monstrous brute, as in the \"Odyssey\", but instead he is rather like Odysseus himself in his vision of the world: He has weaknesses, he is adept at literary criticism, and he understands people.\nThe date of composition for the \"Cyclops\" is not precisely known, but it must be prior to 388 BC, when Aristophanes parodied it in his comedy \"Plutus\" (\"Wealth\"); and probably after 406 BC, when Dionysius I became tyrant of Syracuse. Philoxenus lived in that city and was the court poet of Dionysius I. According to ancient commentators, either because of his frankness regarding Dionysius's poetry, or because of a conflict with the tyrant over a female aulos player named Galatea, Philoxenus was imprisoned in the quarries and had there composed his \"Cyclops\" in the manner of a \"Roman \u00e0 clef\", where the poem's characters, Polyphemus, Odysseus and Galatea, were meant to represent Dionysius, Philoxenus, and the aulos-player. Philoxenus had his Polyphemus perform on the cithara, a professional lyre requiring great skill. The Cyclops playing such a sophisticated and fashionable instrument would have been quite a surprising juxtaposition for Philoxenus's audience.\nPhiloxenus's \"Cyclops\" is also referred to in Aristotle's \"Poetics\" in a section that discusses representations of people in tragedy and comedy, citing as comedic examples the \"Cyclops\" of both Timotheus and Philoxenus.\nAristophanes.\nThe text of Aristophanes's last extant play \"Plutus\" (\"Wealth\") has survived with almost all of its choral odes missing. What remains shows Aristophanes (as he does to some extent in all his plays) parodying a contemporary literary work \u2014 in this case Philoxenus's \"Cyclops\". While making fun of literary aspects of Philoxenus's dithyramb, Aristophanes is at the same time commenting on musical developments occurring in the fourth century BC, developing themes that run through the whole play. It also contains lines and phrases taken directly from the \"Cyclops\".\nThe slave Cario, tells the chorus that his master has brought home with him the god Wealth, and because of this they will all now be rich. The chorus wants to dance for joy, so Cario takes the lead by parodying Philoxenus's \"Cyclops\". As a solo performer leading a chorus that sings and dances, Cario recreates the form of a dithyramb. He first casts himself in the role of Polyphemus while assigning to the chorus the roles of sheep and goats, at the same time imitating the sound of a lyre: \"And now I wish \u2014 threttanello! \u2014 to imitate the Cyclops and, swinging my feet to and fro like this, to lead you in the dance. But come on, children, shout and shout again the songs of bleating sheep and smelly goats.\" The chorus, however, does not want to play sheep and goats, they would rather be Odysseus and his men, and they threaten to blind Cario (as had Odysseus the drunken Cyclops) with a wooden stake.\nHellenistic pastoral poets.\nThe romantic element, originated by Philoxenus, was revived by later Hellenistic poets, including Theocritus, Callimachus, Hermesianax, and Bion of Smyrna.\nTheocritus is credited with creating the genre of pastoral poetry. His works are titled \"Idylls\" and of these Idyll XI tells the story of the Cyclops' love for Galatea. Though the character of Polyphemus derives from Homer, there are notable differences. Where Homer's Cyclops was beastly and wicked, Theocritus's is absurd, lovesick and comic. Polyphemus loves the sea nymph Galatea, but she rejects him because of his ugliness. However, in a borrowing from Philoxenus's poem, Polyphemus has discovered that music will heal lovesickness, and so he plays the panpipes and sings of his woes, for \"I am skilled in piping as no other Cyclops here\". His longing is to overcome the antithetic elements that divide them, he of earth and she of water:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe love of the mismatched pair was later taken up by other pastoral poets. The same trope of music being the cure for love was introduced by Callimachus in his Epigram 47: \"How excellent was the charm that Polyphemus discovered for the lover. By Earth, the Cyclops was no fool!\" A fragment of a lost idyll by Bion also portrays Polyphemus declaring his undying love for Galatea. Referring back to this, an elegy on Bion's death that was once attributed to Moschus takes the theme further in a piece of hyperbole. Where Polyphemus had failed, the poet declares, Bion's greater artistry had won Galatea's heart, drawing her from the sea to tend his herds. This reflected the situation in Idyll VI of Theocritus. There two herdsmen engage in a musical competition, one of them playing the part of Polyphemus, who asserts that since he has adopted the ruse of ignoring Galatea, she has now become the one who pursues him.\nLatin poets.\nThe successful outcome of Polyphemus's love was also alluded to in the course of a 1st-century BC love elegy on the power of music by the Latin poet Propertius. Listed among the examples he mentions is that \"Even Galatea, it's true, below wild Etna, wheeled her brine-wet horses, Polyphemus, to your songs.\" The division of contrary elements between the land-based monster and the sea nymph, lamented in Theocritus's Idyll 11, is brought into harmony by this means.\nWhile Ovid's treatment of the story that he introduced into the \"Metamorphoses\" is reliant on the idylls of Theocritus, it is complicated by the introduction of Acis, who has now become the focus of Galatea's love.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThere is also a reversion to the Homeric vision of the hulking monster, whose attempt to play the tender shepherd singing love songs is made a source of humour by Galatea:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIn his own character, too, Polyphemus mentions the transgression of heavenly laws that once characterised his actions and is now overcome by Galatea: \"I, who scorn Jove and his heaven and his piercing lightning bolt, submit to you alone.\"\nGalatea listens to the love song of Polyphemus while she and Acis lie hidden by a rock. In his song, Polyphemus scolds her for not loving him in return, offers her rustic gifts and points out what he considers his best feature \u2014 the single eye that is, he boasts, the size of a great shield. But when Polyphemus discovers the hiding place of the lovers, he becomes enraged with jealousy. Galatea, terrified, dives into the ocean, while the Cyclops wrenches off a piece of the mountain and crushes Acis with it. But on her return, Galatea changes her dead lover into the spirit of the Sicilian river Acis.\nFirst-century AD art.\nThat the story sometimes had a more successful outcome for Polyphemus is also attested in the arts. In one of the murals rescued from the site of Pompeii, Polyphemus is pictured seated on a rock with a cithara (rather than a syrinx) by his side, holding out a hand to receive a love letter from Galatea, which is carried by a winged Cupid riding on a dolphin.\nIn another fresco, also dating from the 1st century AD, the two stand locked in a naked embrace (see below). From their union came the ancestors of various wild and war-like races. According to some accounts, the Celts (Galati in Latin, \u0393\u03ac\u03bb\u03bb\u03bfi in Greek) were descended from their son Galatos, while Appian credited them with three children, Celtus, Illyrius and Galas, from whom descend the Celts, the Illyrians and the Gauls respectively.\nLucian.\nThere are indications that Polyphemus's courtship also had a more successful outcome in one of the dialogues of Lucian of Samosata. There Doris, one of Galatea's sisters, spitefully congratulates her on her love conquest and she defends Polyphemus. From the conversation, one understands that Doris is chiefly jealous that her sister has a lover. Galatea admits that she does not love Polyphemus but is pleased to have been chosen by him in preference to all her companions.\nNonnus.\nThat their conjunction was fruitful is also implied in a later Greek epic from the turn of the 5th century AD. In the course of his \"Dionysiaca\", Nonnus gives an account of the wedding of Poseidon and Beroe, at which the Nereid \"Galatea twangled a marriage dance and restlessly twirled in capering step, and she sang the marriage verses, for she had learnt well how to sing, being taught by Polyphemos with a shepherd's syrinx.\"\nLater European interpretations.\nLiterature and music.\nDuring Renaissance and Baroque times Ovid's story emerged again as a popular theme. In Spain Luis de G\u00f3ngora y Argote wrote the much admired narrative poem, \"F\u00e1bula de Polifemo y Galatea\", published in 1627. It is particularly noted for its depiction of landscape and for the sensual description of the love of Acis and Galatea. It was written in homage to an earlier and rather shorter narrative with the same title by Luis Carillo y Sotomayor (1611). The story was also given operatic treatment in the very popular zarzuela of Antoni Lliteres Carri\u00f3 (1708). The atmosphere here is lighter and enlivened by the inclusion of the clowns Momo and Tisbe.\nIn France the story was condensed to the fourteen lines of Tristan L'Hermite's sonnet \"Polyph\u00e8me en furie\" (1641). In it the giant expresses his fury upon viewing the loving couple, ultimately throwing the huge rock that kills Acis and even injures Galatea. Later in the century, Jean-Baptiste Lully composed his opera \"Acis et Galat\u00e9e\" (1686) on the theme.\nIn Italy Giovanni Bononcini composed the one-act opera \"Polifemo\" (1703). Shortly afterwards George Frideric Handel worked in that country and composed the cantata \"Aci, Galatea e Polifemo\" (1708), laying as much emphasis on the part of Polifemo as on the lovers. Written in Italian, Polifemo's deep bass solo \"Fra l'ombre e gl'orrori\" (From horrid shades) establishes his character from the start. After Handel's move to England, he gave the story a new treatment in his pastoral opera \"Acis and Galatea\" with an English libretto provided by John Gay. Initially composed in 1718, the work went through many revisions and was later to be given updated orchestrations by both Mozart and Mendelssohn. As a pastoral work it is suffused with Theocritan atmosphere but largely centres on the two lovers. When Polyphemus declares his love in the lyric \"O ruddier than the cherry\", the effect is almost comic. Handel's rival for a while on the London scene, Nicola Porpora, also made the story the subject of his opera \"Polifemo\" (1735).\nLater in the century Joseph Haydn composed \"Acide e Galatea\" (1763) as his first opera while in Vienna. Designed for an imperial wedding, it was given a happy ending centred on the transformation scene after the murder of Acis as the pair declare their undying love. Johann Gottlieb Naumann was to turn the story into a comic opera, \"Aci e Galatea\", with the subtitle \"i ciclopi amanti\" (the amorous cyclops). The work was first performed in Dresden in 1801 and its plot was made more complicated by giving Polifemo a companion, Orgonte. There were also two other lovers, Dorinda and Lisia, with Orgonte Lisia's rival for Dorinda's love.\nAfter John Gay's libretto in Britain, it was not until the 19th century that the subject was given further poetical treatment. In 1819 appeared \"The Death of Acis\" by Bryan Procter, writing under the name of Barry Cornwall. A blank verse narrative with lyric episodes, it celebrates the musicianship of Polyphemus, which draws the lovers to expose themselves from their hiding place in a cave and thus brings about the death of Acis. At the other end of the century, there was Alfred Austin's dramatic poem \"Polyphemus\", which is set after the murder and transformation of the herdsman. The giant is tortured by hearing the happy voices of Galatea and Acis as they pursue their love duet. Shortly afterwards Albert Samain wrote the 2-act verse drama \"Polyph\u00e8me\" with the additional character of Lycas, Galatea's younger brother. In this the giant is humanised; sparing the lovers when he discovers them, he blinds himself and wades to his death in the sea. The play was first performed posthumously in 1904 with incidental music by Raymond Bonheur. On this the French composer Jean Cras based his operatic 'lyric tragedy' \"Polyph\u00e8me\", composed in 1914 and first performed in 1922. Cras took Samain's text almost unchanged, subdividing the play's two acts into four and cutting a few lines from Polyphemus's final speech.\nThere have also been two Spanish musical items that reference Polyphemus's name. Reginald Smith Brindle's four fragments for guitar, \"El Polifemo de Oro\" (1956), takes its title from Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca's poem, \"The riddle of the guitar\". That speaks of six dancing maidens (the guitar strings) entranced by 'a golden Polyphemus' (the one-eyed sound-hole). The Spanish composer Andres Valero Castells takes the inspiration for his \"Polifemo i Galatea\" from Gongora's work. Originally written for brass band in 2001, he rescored it for orchestra in 2006.\nPainting and sculpture.\nPaintings that include Polyphemus in the story of Acis and Galatea can be grouped according to their themes. Most notably the story takes place within a pastoral landscape in which the figures are almost incidental. This is particularly so in Nicolas Poussin's 1649 \"Landscape with Polyphemus\" (see gallery below) in which the lovers play a minor part in the foreground. To the right, Polyphemus merges with a distant mountain top on which he plays his pipes. In an earlier painting by Poussin from 1630 (now housed at the Dublin National Gallery) the couple are among several embracing figures in the foreground, shielded from view of Polyphemus, who is playing his flute higher up the slope. Another variation on the theme was painted by Pietro Dandini during this period.\nAn earlier fresco by Giulio Romano from 1528 seats Polyphemus against a rocky foreground with a lyre in his raised right hand. The lovers can just be viewed through a gap in the rock that gives onto the sea at the lower right. Corneille Van Cl\u00e8ve (1681) represents a seated Polyphemus in his sculpture, except that in his version it is pipes that the giant holds in his lowered hand. Otherwise he has a massive club held across his body and turns to the left to look over his shoulder.\nOther paintings take up the Theocritan theme of the pair divided by the elements with which they are identified, land and water. There are a series of paintings, often titled \"The Triumph of Galatea\", in which the nymph is carried through the sea by her Nereid sisters, while a minor figure of Polyphemus serenades her from the land. Typical examples of this were painted by Fran\u00e7ois Perrier, Giovanni Lanfranco and Jean-Baptiste van Loo.\nA whole series of paintings by Gustave Moreau make the same point in a variety of subtle ways. The giant spies on Galatea through the wall of a sea grotto or emerges from a cliff to adore her sleeping figure (see below). Again, Polyphemus merges with the cliff where he meditates in the same way that Galatea merges with her element within the grotto in the painting at Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay. The visionary interpretation of the story also finds its echo in Odilon Redon's 1913 painting \"The Cyclops\" in which the giant towers over the slope on which Galatea sleeps.\nFrench sculptors have also been responsible for some memorable versions. Auguste Ottin's separate figures are brought together in an 1866 fountain in the Luxembourg Garden. Above is crouched the figure of Polyphemus in weathered bronze, peering down at the white marble group of Acis and Galatea embracing below (see above). A little later Auguste Rodin made a series of statues, centred on Polyphemus. Originally modelled in clay around 1888 and later cast in bronze, they may have been inspired by Ottin's work.\nA final theme is the rage that succeeds the moment of discovery. That is portrayed in earlier paintings of Polyphemus casting a rock at the fleeing lovers, such as those by Annibale Carracci, Lucas Auger and Carle van Loo. Jean-Fran\u00e7ois de Troy's 18th-century version combines discovery with aftermath as the giant perched above the lovers turns to wrench up a rock.\nOther uses.\nPolyphemus is mentioned in the \"Apprentice\" chapter of Albert Pike's \"Morals and Dogma\" (1871), as, within Scottish Rite Freemasonry, Polyphemus is regarded as a symbol for a civilization that harms itself using ill directed blind force.\nThe Polyphemus moth is so named because of the large eyespots in the middle of the hind wings.\nA species of burrowing tortoise, \"Gopherus polyphemus\", is named after Polyphemus because of their both using subterranean retreats.\nIn folkloristics, the episode of the blinding of Polyphemus is also known as \"Polyphemsage\" and classified in the Aarne-Thompson-Uther Index as ATU 1137, \"The Ogre Blinded (Polyphemus)\".\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWorks cited.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nGeneral references.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nExternal links.\nSpecific artworks discussed above"}
{"id": "23915", "revid": "10202399", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23915", "title": "Portuguese language", "text": "Romance language\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Infobox/styles-images.css\" /&gt;\nPortuguese ( or ) is a Western Romance language of the Indo-European language family originating from the Iberian Peninsula of Europe. It is spoken chiefly in Brazil, Portugal, and several countries in Africa, as well as by immigrants in North America, Europe, and South America. With approximately 267 million speakers, it is listed as the fifth-most spoken native language. \nPortuguese-speaking people or nations are known as Lusophone (). As a result of expansion during colonial times, a cultural presence of Portuguese speakers is also found around the world. Portuguese is part of the Ibero-Romance group, which evolved from several dialects of Vulgar Latin in the medieval Kingdom of Galicia and the County of Portugal, and has retained some Celtic phonology.\nPortuguese language structure reflects its Latin roots and centuries of outside influences. These are seen in phonology, orthography, grammar, and vocabulary. Phonologically, Portuguese has a rich system of nasal vowels, complex consonant variations, and different types of guttural R and other sounds in European and Brazilian varieties. Its spelling, based like English on the Latin alphabet, is largely phonemic but is influenced by etymology and tradition. Recent spelling reforms attempted to create a unified spelling for the Portuguese language across all countries that use it. Portuguese grammar retains many Latin verb forms and has some unique features such as the future subjunctive and the personal infinitive. The vocabulary is derived mostly from Latin but also includes numerous loanwords from Celtic, Germanic, Arabic, African, Amerindian, and Asian languages, resulting from historical contact including wars, trade, and colonization.\nThere is significant variation in dialects of Portuguese worldwide, with two primary standardized varieties: European Portuguese and Brazilian Portuguese, each one having numerous regional accents and subdialects. African and Asian varieties generally follow the European written standard, though they often have different phonological, lexical, and sometimes syntactic features. While there is broad mutual intelligibility among varieties, variation is seen mostly in speech patterns and vocabulary, with some regional differences in grammar.\nHistory.\nOrigins.\nWhen the Romans arrived in the Iberian Peninsula in 216\u00a0BC, they brought with them the Latin language, from which all Romance languages are descended. The language was spread by Roman commoners, merchants, and soldiers, who built Roman cities mostly near the settlements of previous Celtic civilizations established long before the Roman arrivals. For that reason, the language has kept a relevant substratum of much older, Atlantic European Megalithic Culture and Celtic culture, part of the Hispano-Celtic group of ancient languages. In Latin, the Portuguese language is known as \"lusitana\" or \"(latina) lusitanica\", after the Lusitanians, a pre-Celtic tribe that lived in the territory of present-day Portugal and Spain that adopted the Latin language as Roman settlers moved in. This is also the origin of the \"luso-\" prefix, seen in terms like \"Lusophone\".\nGermanic Period.\nBetween AD 409 and AD 711, as the Roman Empire collapsed in Western Europe, the Iberian Peninsula was conquered by Germanic peoples of the Migration Period. The occupiers, most notably Suebi but also Visigoths and Buri originally spoke Germanic languages. Quickly, they adopted late Roman culture and the Vulgar Latin dialects of the peninsula and over the next 300 years totally integrated into the local population. Some Germanic words from that period are part of the Portuguese lexicon, together with place names, surnames, and first names.\nAfter the Arab Conquest.\nWith the Umayyad conquest beginning in 711, Arabic became the administrative and common language in the conquered regions, but most of the remaining Christian population continued to speak a form of Ibero-Romance called Mozarabic which introduced a few hundred words from Arabic, Persian, Turkish, and Berber. Like other Neo-Latin and European languages, Portuguese has adopted a significant number of loanwords from Greek, mainly in technical and scientific terminology. These borrowings occurred via Latin, and later during the Middle Ages and the Renaissance.\nPortuguese evolved from the medieval language spoken in the northwestern medieval Kingdom of Galicia, which the County of Portugal once formed part of. This variety has been retrospectively named Galician\u2013Portuguese, Old Portuguese, or Old Galician by linguists. It is in Latin administrative documents of the 9th century that written Galician\u2013Portuguese words and phrases are first recorded. This phase is known as Proto-Portuguese, which lasted from the 9th century until the 12th-century independence of the County of Portugal from the Kingdom of Le\u00f3n, which had by then assumed reign over Galicia.\nIn the first part of the Galician\u2013Portuguese period (from the 12th to the 14th century), the language was increasingly used for documents and other written forms. For some time, it was the language of preference for lyric poetry in Christian Hispania, much as Occitan was the language of the poetry of the troubadours in France. The Occitan digraphs \"lh\" and \"nh\", used in its classical orthography, were adopted by the orthography of Portuguese, presumably by Gerald of Braga, a monk from Moissac, who became bishop of Braga in Portugal in 1047, playing a major role in modernizing written Portuguese using classical Occitan norms. Portugal became an independent kingdom in 1139, under King Afonso I of Portugal. In 1290, King Denis of Portugal created the first Portuguese university in Lisbon (the \"Estudos Gerais\", which later moved to Coimbra) and decreed for Portuguese, then simply called the \"common language\", to be known as the Portuguese language and used officially.\nIn the second period of Old Portuguese, in the 15th and 16th centuries, with the Portuguese discoveries, the language was taken to many regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. By the mid-16th century, Portuguese had become a \"lingua franca\" in Asia and Africa, used not only for colonial administration and trade but also for communication between local officials and Europeans of all nationalities. The Portuguese expanded across South America, across Africa to the Pacific Ocean, taking their language with them.\nIts spread was helped by mixed marriages between Portuguese and local people and by its association with Roman Catholic missionary efforts, which led to the formation of creole languages such as that called Kristang in many parts of Asia (from the word \"crist\u00e3o\", \"Christian\"). The language continued to be popular in parts of Asia until the 19th century. Some Portuguese-speaking Christian communities in India, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, and Indonesia preserved their language even after they were isolated from Portugal.\nThe end of the Old Portuguese period was marked by the publication of the \"Cancioneiro Geral\" by Garcia de Resende, in 1516. The early times of Modern Portuguese, which spans the period from the 16th century to the present day, were characterized by an increase in the number of learned words borrowed from Classical Latin and Classical Greek because of the Renaissance (learned words borrowed from Latin also came from Renaissance Latin, the form of Latin during that time), which greatly enriched the lexicon. Most literate Portuguese speakers were also literate in Latin; and thus they easily adopted Latin words into their writing, and eventually speech, in Portuguese.\nSpanish author Miguel de Cervantes once called Portuguese \"the sweet and gracious language\", while the Brazilian poet Olavo Bilac described it as (\"the last flower of Latium, na\u00efve and beautiful\"). Portuguese is also termed \"the language of Cam\u00f5es\", after Lu\u00eds Vaz de Cam\u00f5es, one of the greatest literary figures in the Portuguese language and author of the Portuguese epic poem \"The Lusiads\".\nIn March 2006, the Museum of the Portuguese Language, an interactive museum about the Portuguese language, was founded in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, the city with the greatest number of Portuguese language speakers in the world. The museum is the first of its kind in the world. In 2015 the museum was partially destroyed in a fire, but restored and reopened in 2020.\nGeographic distribution.\nPortuguese is spoken by approximately 200 million people in South America, 30 million in Africa, 15 million in Europe, 5 million in North America and 0.33 million in Asia and Oceania. It is the native language of the vast majority of the people in Portugal, Brazil and S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe (95%). Around 45% of the population of urban Angola speaks Portuguese natively, with approximately 85% fluent; these rates are lower in the countryside. Just over 50% (and rapidly increasing) of the population of Mozambique are native speakers of Portuguese, and 70% are fluent, according to the 2007 census. Portuguese is also spoken natively by 30% of the population in Guinea-Bissau, and a Portuguese-based creole is understood by all. Almost 50% of the East Timorese are fluent in Portuguese. No data is available for Cape Verde, but almost all the population is bilingual, and the monolingual population speaks the Portuguese-based Cape Verdean Creole. Portuguese is mentioned in the Constitution of South Africa as one of the languages spoken by communities within the country for which the Pan South African Language Board was charged with promoting and ensuring respect.\nThere are also significant Portuguese-speaking immigrant communities in many territories including Andorra (17.1%), Bermuda, Canada (400,275 people in the 2006 census), France (1,625,000 people), Japan (400,000 people), Jersey, Luxembourg (about 25% of the population as of 2021), Namibia (about 4\u20135% of the population, mainly refugees from Angola in the north of the country), Paraguay (10.7% or 636,000 people), Switzerland (550,000 in 2019, learning + mother tongue), Venezuela (554,000), and the United States (0.35% of the population or 1,228,126 speakers according to the 2007 American Community Survey).\nIn some parts of former Portuguese India, namely Goa and Daman and Diu, the language is still spoken by about 10,000 people. In 2014, an estimated 1,500 students were learning Portuguese in Goa. Approximately 2% of the people of Macau, China are fluent speakers of Portuguese. Additionally, the language is being very actively studied in the Chinese school system right up to the doctorate level. The Kristang people in Malaysia speak Kristang, a Portuguese-Malay creole; however, the Portuguese language itself is not widely spoken in the country.\nOfficial status.\nThe Community of Portuguese Language Countries\n(in Portuguese \"Comunidade dos Pa\u00edses de L\u00edngua Portuguesa\", with the Portuguese acronym CPLP) consists of the nine independent countries that have Portuguese as an official language: Angola, Brazil, Cape Verde, East Timor, Equatorial Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Mozambique, Portugal and S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe.\nEquatorial Guinea made a formal application for full membership to the CPLP in June 2010, a status given only to states with Portuguese as an official language. Portuguese became its third official language (besides Spanish and French) in 2011, and in July 2014, the country was accepted as a member of the CPLP.\nPortuguese is also one of the official languages of the Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China of Macau (alongside Chinese) and of several international organizations, including Mercosul, the Organization of Ibero-American States, the Union of South American Nations, the Organization of American States, the African Union, the Economic Community of West African States, the Southern African Development Community and the European Union.\nLusophone countries.\nAccording to \"The World Factbook\"'s country population estimates for 2018, the population of each of the ten jurisdictions is as follows (by descending order):\nNotes:\nThe combined population of the entire Lusophone area was estimated at 300 million in January 2022. This number does not include the Lusophone diaspora, estimated at 10 million people (including 4.5 million Portuguese, 3 million Brazilians), although there are no official accurate figures for diasporic Portuguese speakers because a significant portion of these citizens are naturalized citizens born outside of Lusophone territory or are children of immigrants, and may have only a basic command of the language. Additionally, a large part of the diaspora is a part of the already-counted population of the Portuguese-speaking countries and territories, such as the high number of Brazilian and PALOP emigrant citizens in Portugal or the high number of Portuguese emigrant citizens in the PALOP and Brazil.\nThe Portuguese language therefore serves more than 250 million people daily, who have direct or indirect legal, juridical and social contact with it, varying from the only language used in any contact, to only education, contact with local or international administration, commerce and services or the simple sight of road signs, public information and advertising in Portuguese.\nPortuguese as a foreign language.\nPortuguese is a mandatory subject in the school curriculum in Uruguay. Other countries where Portuguese is commonly taught in schools or where it has been introduced as an option include Venezuela, Zambia, the Republic of the Congo, Senegal, Namibia, Eswatini, South Africa, Ivory Coast, and Mauritius. In 2017, a project was launched to introduce Portuguese as a school subject in Zimbabwe. Also, according to Portugal's Minister of Foreign Affairs, the language will be part of the school curriculum of a total of 32 countries by 2020. In such countries, Portuguese is spoken either as a native language by vast majorities due to their Portuguese colonial past or as a \"lingua franca\" in bordering and multilingual regions, such as on the Brazilian borders of Uruguay and Paraguay and in regions of Angola and Namibia. In many other countries, Portuguese is spoken by majorities as a second language. There remain communities of thousands of Portuguese (or Creole) first language speakers in Goa, Sri Lanka, Kuala Lumpur, Daman and Diu, and other areas due to Portuguese colonization. In East Timor, the number of Portuguese speakers is quickly increasing as Portuguese and Brazilian teachers are making great strides in teaching Portuguese in the schools all over the island. Additionally, there are many large Portuguese-speaking immigrant communities all over the world.\nFuture.\nAccording to estimates by UNESCO, Portuguese is the fastest-growing European language after English and the language has, according to the newspaper \"The Portugal News\" publishing data given from UNESCO, the highest potential for growth as an international language in southern Africa and South America. Portuguese is a globalized language spoken officially on five continents, and as a second language by millions worldwide.\nSince 1991, when Brazil signed into the economic community of Mercosul with other South American nations, namely Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay, Portuguese is either mandatory, or taught, in the schools of those South American countries.\nAlthough early in the 21st century, after Macau was returned to China and immigration of Brazilians of Japanese descent to Japan slowed down, the use of Portuguese was in decline in Asia, it is once again becoming a language of opportunity there, mostly because of increased diplomatic and financial ties with economically powerful Portuguese-speaking countries in the world.\nCurrent status and importance.\nPortuguese, being a language spread on all continents, has official status in several international organizations. It is one of twenty official languages of the European Union, an official language of NATO, the Organization of American States (alongside Spanish, French and English), and one of eighteen official languages of the European Space Agency.\nPortuguese is a working language in nonprofit organisations such as the Red Cross (alongside English, German, Spanish, French, Arabic and Russian), Amnesty International (alongside 32 other languages of which English is the most used, followed by Spanish, French, German, and Italian), and M\u00e9decins sans Fronti\u00e8res (used alongside English, Spanish, French and Arabic), in addition to being the official legal language in the African Court on Human and Peoples' Rights, also in Community of Portuguese Language Countries, an international organization formed essentially by lusophone countries.\nLinguistic demography.\nWith approximately 250 million native speakers and 17 million second language speakers, Portuguese has approximately 267 million total speakers. It is usually listed as the fifth-most spoken native language, the third-most spoken European language in the world in terms of native speakers and the second-most spoken Romance language in the world, surpassed only by Spanish. Being the first most widely spoken language in South America and the most-spoken language in the Southern Hemisphere, it is also the second-most spoken language, after Spanish, in Latin America, one of the 10 most spoken languages in Africa, and an official language of the European Union, Mercosul, the Organization of American States, the Economic Community of West African States, the African Union, and the Community of Portuguese Language Countries, an international organization made up of all of the world's officially Lusophone nations. In 1997, a comprehensive academic study ranked Portuguese as one of the 10 most influential languages in the world.\nClassification and related languages.\nPortuguese belongs to the West Iberian branch of the Romance languages, and it has special ties with the following members of this group:\nPortuguese and other Romance languages (namely French and Italian) share considerable similarities in both vocabulary and grammar. Portuguese speakers will usually need some formal study before attaining strong comprehension in those Romance languages, and vice versa. However, Portuguese and Galician are fully mutually intelligible. Spanish is relatively intelligible for lusophones, owing to their geographic proximity and history as West Iberian (Ibero-Romance languages), historical contact between speakers and mutual influence, shared areal features as well as modern lexical, structural, and grammatical similarity (over 85%) between them. Many young Portuguese speakers however, will often choose English as the lingua-franca of choice, with Spanish, French, Italian, other Europeans, and speakers of other languages. Over 97% of 18 to 24 year olds in Portugal speak a second language fluently, 95% of those have English as L2, some 33.7% speak French, 23% German, and 14% Spanish.\nPortu\u00f1ol/Portunhol, a form of code-switching, has a lively use and is mentioned in popular culture in South America. Said code-switching is not to be confused with the Portu\u00f1ol spoken on the borders of Brazil with Uruguay () and Paraguay (), and of Portugal with Spain (), that are Portuguese dialects spoken natively by thousands of people, which have been heavily influenced by Spanish.\nPortuguese and Spanish are the only Ibero-Romance languages, and perhaps the only Romance languages in Latin-America, with such thriving inter-language forms, in which visible and lively bilingual contact dialects and code-switching have formed, in which functional bilingual communication is achieved through attempting an approximation to the target foreign language (known as 'Portu\u00f1ol') without a learned acquisition process, but nevertheless facilitates communication. There is an emerging literature focused on such phenomena in South America (including informal attempts of standardization of the linguistic continua and their usage).\nGalician\u2013Portuguese in Spain.\nThe closest relative of Portuguese is Galician, which is spoken in the autonomous community and historical nationality of Galicia (Spain). The two were part of a common dialect continuum during the Middle Ages, known today as Galician\u2013Portuguese, but they have diverged especially in pronunciation and vocabulary due to the political separation of Portugal from Galicia. There is, however, still a linguistic continuity consisting of the variant of Galician referred to as \"galego-portugu\u00eas baixo-limiao\", which is spoken in several Galician and Portuguese villages within the transboundary biosphere reserve of Ger\u00eas-Xur\u00e9s. It is \"considered a rarity, a living vestige of the medieval language that ranged from Cantabria to Mondego [...]\".\nAs reported by UNESCO, due to the pressure of Spanish on the standard official version of Galician and centuries-old Castilianization, the Galician language was on the verge of disappearing.\nAccording to the UNESCO philologist Tapani Salminen, the proximity to Portuguese protects Galician. The core vocabulary and grammar of Galician are noticeably closer to Portuguese than to those of Spanish. Within the EU, Galician, while not being a European Parliament official language, can be used and is in fact used by some European Parliament constituents due to its similarity with Portuguese. Galician like Portuguese, uses the future subjunctive, the personal infinitive, and the synthetic pluperfect. Mutual intelligibility estimated at 85% is excellent between Galicians and Portuguese. Despite political efforts in Spain to define them as separate languages, many linguists consider Galician and Portuguese to be co-dialects of the same language with regional variations.\nAnother member of the Galician\u2013Portuguese group, most commonly thought of as a Galician dialect, is spoken in the Eonavian region in a western strip in Asturias and the westernmost parts of the provinces of Le\u00f3n and Zamora, along the frontier with Galicia, between the Eo and Navia rivers (or more exactly Eo and Frexulfe rivers). It is called \"eonaviego\" or \"gallego-asturiano\" by its speakers.\nThe Fala language, known by its speakers as \"xalim\u00e9s\", \"ma\u00f1egu\", \"a fala de X\u00e1lima\" and \"chapurr\u00e1u\" and in Portuguese as \"a fala de X\u00e1lima\", \"a fala da Estremadura\", \"o galego da Estremadura\", \"valego\" or \"galaico-estremenho\", is another descendant of Galician\u2013Portuguese, spoken by a small number of people in the Spanish towns of Valverde del Fresno (\"Valverdi du Fresnu\"), Eljas (\"As Ellas\") and San Mart\u00edn de Trevejo (\"Sa Mart\u00edn de Trevellu\") in the autonomous community of Extremadura, near the border with Portugal.\nThere are a number of other places in Spain in which the native language of the common people is a descendant of the Galician\u2013Portuguese group, such as La Alamedilla, Cedillo (\"Cedilho\"), Herrera de Alc\u00e1ntara (\"Ferreira d'Alc\u00e2ntara\") and Olivenza (\"Oliven\u00e7a\"), but in these municipalities, what is spoken is actually Portuguese, not disputed as such in the mainstream.\nThe diversity of dialects of the Portuguese language is known since the time of medieval Portuguese-Galician language when it coexisted with the Lusitanian-Mozarabic dialect, spoken in the south of Portugal. The dialectal diversity becomes more evident in the work of Fern\u00e3o d'Oliveira, in the \"Grammatica da Lingoagem Portuguesa\", (1536), where he remarks that the people of Portuguese regions of Beira, Alentejo, Estremadura, and Entre Douro e Minho, all speak differently from each other. Also Contador d'Argote (1725) distinguishes three main varieties of dialects: the local dialects, the dialects of time, and of profession (work jargon). Of local dialects he highlights five main dialects: the dialect of Estremadura, of Entre-Douro e Minho, of Beira, of Algarve and of Tr\u00e1s-os-Montes. He also makes reference to the overseas dialects, the rustic dialects, the poetic dialect and that of prose.\nIn the kingdom of Portugal, \"Ladinho\" (or \"Lingoagem Ladinha\") was the name given to the pure Portuguese romance language, without any mixture of Aravia or Gerigon\u00e7a Judenga. While the term \"l\u00edngua vulgar\" was used to name the language before D. Dinis decided to call it \"Portuguese language\", the erudite version used and known as Galician\u2013Portuguese (the language of the Portuguese court) and all other Portuguese dialects were spoken at the same time. In a historical perspective the Portuguese language was never just one dialect. Just like today there is a standard Portuguese (actually two) among the several dialects of Portuguese, in the past there was Galician\u2013Portuguese as the \"standard\", coexisting with other dialects.\nInfluence on other languages.\nPortuguese has provided loanwords to many languages, such as Indonesian, Manado Malay, Malayalam, Sri Lankan Tamil and Sinhala, Malay, Bengali, English, Hindi, Swahili, Afrikaans, Konkani, Marathi, Punjabi, Tetum, Xitsonga, Japanese, Lanc-Patu\u00e1, Esan, Bandari (spoken in Iran) and Sranan Tongo (spoken in Suriname). It left a strong influence on the \"l\u00edngua bras\u00edlica\", a Tupi\u2013Guarani language, which was the most widely spoken in Brazil until the 18th century, and on the language spoken around Sikka in Flores Island, Indonesia. In nearby Larantuka, Portuguese is used for prayers in Holy Week rituals.\nThe Japanese\u2013Portuguese dictionary \"Nippo Jisho\" (1603) was the first dictionary of Japanese in a European language, a product of Jesuit missionary activity in Japan. Building on the work of earlier Portuguese missionaries, the \"Dictionarium Anamiticum, Lusitanum et Latinum\" (Annamite\u2013Portuguese\u2013Latin dictionary) of Alexandre de Rhodes (1651) introduced the modern orthography of Vietnamese, which is based on the orthography of 17th-century Portuguese. The Romanization of Chinese was also influenced by the Portuguese language (among others), particularly regarding Chinese surnames; one example is \"Mei\". During 1583\u201388 Italian Jesuits Michele Ruggieri and Matteo Ricci created a Portuguese\u2013Chinese dictionary\u00a0\u2013 the first ever European\u2013Chinese dictionary.\nFor instance, as Portuguese merchants were presumably the first to introduce the sweet orange in Europe, in several modern Indo-European languages the fruit has been named after them. Some examples are Albanian \"portokall\", Bosnian (archaic) \"portokal\", \"prtokal\", Bulgarian \u043f\u043e\u0440\u0442\u043e\u043a\u0430\u043b (\"portokal\"), Greek \u03c0\u03bf\u03c1\u03c4\u03bf\u03ba\u03ac\u03bb\u03b9 (\"portok\u00e1li\"), Macedonian \"\", Persian \u067e\u0631\u062a\u0642\u0627\u0644 (\"porteghal\"), and Romanian \"portocal\u0103\". Related names can be found in other languages, such as Arabic \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0631\u062a\u0642\u0627\u0644 (\"burtuq\u0101l\"), Georgian \u10e4\u10dd\u10e0\u10d7\u10dd\u10ee\u10d0\u10da\u10d8 (\"p'ort'oxali\"), Turkish \"portakal\" and Amharic \"birtukan\". Also, in southern Italian dialects (e.g. Neapolitan), an orange is \"portogallo\" or \"purtuallo\", literally \"(the) Portuguese (one)\", in contrast to standard Italian \"arancia\".\nDerived languages.\nBeginning in the 16th century, the extensive contacts between Portuguese travelers and settlers, African and Asian slaves, and local populations led to the appearance of many pidgins with varying amounts of Portuguese influence.\nAs each of these pidgins became the mother tongue of succeeding generations, they evolved into fully fledged creole languages, which remained in use in many parts of Asia, Africa and South America until the 18th century.\nSome Portuguese-based or Portuguese-influenced creoles are still spoken today, namely Cape Verdean Creole and Papiamento. Portuguese-based creoles are spoken by over three million people worldwide, especially people of partial Portuguese ancestry.\nLanguage structure.\nPhonology.\nPortuguese phonology is similar to those of languages such as Franco-Proven\u00e7al and Catalan, whereas that of Spanish is similar to those of Sardinian and the Southern Italian dialects. Some would describe the phonology of Portuguese as a blend of Spanish, Gallo-Romance (e.g. French) and the languages of northern Italy (especially Genoese).\nPortuguese can have as many as nine oral vowels, as many as two semivowels, and as many as 21 consonants; some varieties of the language have fewer phonemes. There are also five nasal vowels, which some linguists regard as allophones of oral vowels. Galician\u2013Portuguese developed in the region of the former Roman province of Gallaecia, from the Vulgar Latin (common Latin) that had been introduced by Roman soldiers, colonists and magistrates during the time of the Roman Empire. Although the process may have been slower than in other regions, after a period of bilingualism, the centuries of contact with Vulgar Latin completely extinguished the native languages, and a variety of Latin with a few Gallaecian features evolved.\nGallaecian and Lusitanian influences were absorbed into the local dialect of Vulgar Latin; this can be detected in some Galician\u2013Portuguese words, as well as in placenames of Celtic and Iberian origin.\nAn early form of Galician\u2013Portuguese was already spoken in the Kingdom of the Suebi, and by the year 800 Galician\u2013Portuguese had already become the vernacular of northwestern Iberia. The first known phonetic changes in Vulgar Latin, which began the evolution to Galician\u2013Portuguese, took place during the rule of the Germanic groups, the Suebi (411\u2013585) and Visigoths (585\u2013711). The Galician\u2013Portuguese \"inflected infinitive\" (or \"personal infinitive\") and the nasal vowels may have evolved under the influence of local Celtic (as in Old French). The nasal vowels would thus be a phonologic characteristic of the Vulgar Latin spoken in Roman Gallaecia, but they are not attested in writing until after the 6th and 7th centuries.\nVowels.\nLike Catalan and German, Portuguese uses vowel quality to contrast stressed syllables with unstressed syllables. Unstressed isolated vowels tend to be raised and sometimes centralized.\nConsonants.\nPhonetic notes\nGrammar.\nA notable aspect of the grammar of Portuguese is the verb. Morphologically, more verbal inflections from classical Latin have been preserved by Portuguese than by any other major Romance language. Portuguese and Spanish share very similar grammar, vocabulary and sentence structure. Portuguese also has some grammatical innovations not found in other Romance languages (except Galician and Fala):\n\"Se eu \"for\" eleito presidente, mudarei a lei.\"\nIf \"I am\" elected president, I will change the law.\n\"Quando \"fores\" mais velho, vais entender.\"\nWhen \"you grow\" older, you will understand.\nVocabulary.\nMost of the lexicon of Portuguese is derived, directly or through other Romance languages, from Latin. Nevertheless, because of its original Lusitanian and Celtic Gallaecian heritage, and the later participation of Portugal in the Age of Discovery, it has a relevant number of words from the ancient Hispano-Celtic group and adopted loanwords from other languages around the world.\nA number of Portuguese words can still be traced to the pre-Roman inhabitants of Portugal, which included the Gallaeci, Lusitanians, Celtici and Cynetes. Most of these words derived from the Hispano-Celtic Gallaecian language of northwestern Iberia, and are very often shared with Galician since both languages have the same origin in the medieval language of Galician\u2013Portuguese. A few of these words existed in Latin as loanwords from other Celtic sources, often Gaulish. Altogether these are over 3,000 words, verbs, toponymic names of towns, rivers, surnames, tools, lexicon linked to rural life and natural world.\nIn the 5th century, the Iberian Peninsula (the Roman Hispania) was conquered by the Germanic, Suebi and Visigoths. As they adopted the Roman civilization and language, however, these people contributed with some 500 \nGermanic words to the lexicon. Many of these words are related to:\nThe Germanic languages influence also exists in toponymic surnames and patronymic surnames borne by Visigoth sovereigns and their descendants, and it dwells on placenames such as Ermesinde, Esposende and Resende where \"sinde\" and \"sende\" are derived from the Germanic \"sinths\" ('military expedition') and in the case of Resende, the prefix \"re\" comes from Germanic \"reths\" ('council'). Other examples of Portuguese names, surnames and town names of Germanic toponymic origin include Henrique, Henriques, Vermoim, Mandim, Calquim, Baguim, Gemunde, Guetim, Sermonde and many more, are quite common mainly in the old Suebi and later Visigothic dominated regions, covering today's Northern half of Portugal and Galicia.\nBetween the 9th and early 13th centuries, Portuguese acquired some 400 to 600 words from Arabic by influence of Moorish Iberia. They are often recognizable by the initial Arabic article \"a(l)-\", and include common words such as ('village') from \u0627\u0644\u0636\u064a\u0639\u0629 \"a\u1e0d-\u1e0day\u02bfa\", ('lettuce') from \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0633\u0629 \"al-khassa\", ('warehouse') from \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062e\u0632\u0646 \"al-makhzan\", and ('olive oil') from \u0627\u0644\u0632\u064a\u062a \"az-zayt\".\nStarting in the 15th century, the Portuguese maritime explorations led to the introduction of many loanwords from Asian languages. For instance, ('cutlass') from Japanese \"katana\", ('tea') from Chinese \"ch\u00e1\", and \"canja\" ('chicken-soup, piece of cake') from Malay.\nFrom the 16th to the 19th centuries, because of the role of Portugal as intermediary in the Atlantic slave trade, and the establishment of large Portuguese colonies in Angola, Mozambique, and Brazil, Portuguese acquired several words of African and Amerind origin, especially names for most of the animals and plants found in those territories. While those terms are mostly used in the former colonies, many became current in European Portuguese as well. From Kimbundu, for example, came \"kifumate\" &gt; ('head caress') (Brazil), \"kusula\" &gt; ('youngest child') (Brazil), ('tropical wasp') (Brazil), and \"kubungula\" &gt; ('to dance like a wizard') (Angola). From South America came ('potato'), from Taino; and , from Tupi\u2013Guarani \"nan\u00e1\" and Tupi \"ib\u00e1 cati\", respectively (two species of pineapple), and ('popcorn') from Tupi and ('toucan') from Guarani \"tucan\".\nFinally, it has received a steady influx of loanwords from other European languages, especially French and English. These are by far the most important languages when referring to loanwords. There are many examples such as: / ('bracket'/'crochet'), ('jacket'), ('lipstick'), and / ('steak'/'slice'), ('street'), respectively, from French , , , , ; and ('steak'), , , /, , from English \"beef\", \"football\", \"revolver\", \"stock\", \"folklore\".\nExamples from other European languages: ('pasta'), ('pilot'), ('carriage'), and ('barrack'), from Italian , , , and ; ('hair lock'), ('wet-cured ham') (in Portugal, in contrast with \"presunto\" 'dry-cured ham' from Latin \"prae-exsuctus\" 'dehydrated') or ('canned ham') (in Brazil, in contrast with non-canned, wet-cured (\"presunto cozido\") and dry-cured (\"presunto cru\")), or \"castelhano\" ('Castilian'), from Spanish \"melena\" ('mane'), \"fiambre\" and \"castellano.\"\nDialects, accents and varieties.\nModern Standard European Portuguese ( or ) is based on the Portuguese spoken in the area including and surrounding the cities of Coimbra and Lisbon, in central Portugal. Standard European Portuguese is also the preferred standard by the Portuguese-speaking African countries. As such, and despite the fact that its speakers are dispersed around the world, Portuguese has only two dialects used for learning: the European and the Brazilian. Some aspects and sounds found in many dialects of Brazil are exclusive to South America, and cannot be found in Europe. The same occur with the Santomean, Mozambican, Bissau-Guinean, Angolan and Cape Verdean dialects, being exclusive to Africa. See Portuguese in Africa.\nAudio samples of some dialects and accents of Portuguese are available below. There are some differences between the areas but these are the best approximations possible. IPA transcriptions refer to the names in local pronunciation.\nPortugal.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Pie chart/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAudio samples of some dialects and accents of Portuguese are available below. There are some differences between the areas but these are the best approximations possible. IPA transcriptions refer to the names in local pronunciation.\nBrazil.\n, a pronoun meaning \"you\", is used for educated, formal, and colloquial respectful speech in most Portuguese-speaking regions. In a few Brazilian states such as Rio Grande do Sul, Par\u00e1, among others, is virtually absent from the spoken language. Riograndense and European Portuguese normally distinguishes formal from informal speech by verbal conjugation. Informal speech employs followed by second person verbs, formal language retains the formal , followed by the third person conjugation.\nConjugation of verbs in has three different forms in Brazil (verb \"to see\": , in the traditional second person; , in the third person; and , in the innovative second person), the conjugation used in the Brazilian states of Par\u00e1, Santa Catarina and Maranh\u00e3o being generally traditional second person, the kind that is used in other Portuguese-speaking countries and learned in Brazilian schools.\nThe predominance of Southeastern-based media products has established as the pronoun of choice for the second person singular in both writing and multimedia communications. However, in the city of Rio de Janeiro, the country's main cultural center, the usage of has been expanding ever since the end of the 20th century, being most frequent among youngsters, and a number of studies have also shown an increase in its use in a number of other Brazilian dialects.\nOther countries and dependencies.\nDifferences between dialects are mostly of accent and vocabulary, but between the Brazilian dialects and other dialects, especially in their most colloquial forms, there can also be some grammatical differences. The Portuguese-based creoles spoken in various parts of Africa, Asia, and the Americas are independent languages.\nCharacterization and peculiarities.\nPortuguese, like Catalan, preserves the stressed vowels of Vulgar Latin which became diphthongs in most other Romance languages; cf. Port., Cat., Sard. \"pedra\"; Fr. ', Sp. ', It. ', Ro. ', from Lat. ' (\"stone\"); or Port. ', Cat. ', Sard. '; Sp. ', It. ', Fr. ', Ro. ', from Lat. ' (\"fire\"). Another characteristic of early Portuguese was the loss of intervocalic \"l\" and \"n\", sometimes followed by the merger of the two surrounding vowels, or by the insertion of an epenthetic vowel between them: cf. Lat. ' (\"to exit\"), ' (\"to have\"), ' (\"jail\"), Port. ', ', \"\".\nWhen the elided consonant was \"n\", it often nasalized the preceding vowel: cf. Lat. ' (\"hand\"), ' (\"frog\"), ' (\"good\"), Old Portuguese ', ', ' (Portuguese: ', ', '). This process was the source of most of the language's distinctive nasal diphthongs. In particular, the Latin endings \"-anem\", ' and ' became ' in most cases, cf. Lat. ' (\"dog\"), ' (\"brother\"), ' (\"reason\") with Modern Port. ', ', ', and their plurals \"-anes\", \"-anos\", \"-ones\" normally became \"-\u00e3es\", \"-\u00e3os\", \"-\u00f5es\", cf. \"c\u00e3es\", \"irm\u00e3os\", \"raz\u00f5es\". This also occurs in the minority Swiss Romansh language in many equivalent words such as \"maun\" (\"hand\"), \"bun\" (\"good\"), or \"chaun\" (\"dog\").\nThe Portuguese language is the only Romance language that preserves the clitic case mesoclisis: cf. (I'll give thee), (I'll love you), (I'll contact them). Like Galician, it also retains the Latin synthetic pluperfect tense: (I had been), (I had lived), (you had lived). Romanian also has this tense, but uses the -s- form.\nSample text.\nArticle 1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in Portuguese:\nArticle 1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in English:\n\"All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights.

{"id": "23916", "revid": "47405844", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23916", "title": "Paul Reubens", "text": "American actor and comedian (1952\u20132023)\nPaul Reubens (; n\u00e9\u00a0Rubenfeld; August 27, 1952 \u2013 July 30, 2023) was an American actor and comedian, widely known for creating and portraying the character Pee-wee Herman.\nBorn in Peekskill, New York and raised in both Oneonta, New York and Sarasota, Florida, Reubens joined the Los Angeles-based troupe the Groundlings in the 1970s and started his career as an improvisational comedian and stage actor. Reubens developed his Pee-wee character at the Groundlings. After a failed audition for \"Saturday Night Live\", Reubens debuted a stage show starring Pee-wee, \"The Pee-wee Herman Show\", in 1981. Pee-wee quickly became a cult figure and, for the next decade, Reubens completely committed to his character, conducting all public appearances and interviews as Pee-wee. He produced and wrote a feature film, \"Pee-wee's Big Adventure\" (1985), directed by Tim Burton, which was a financial and critical success. Its sequel, \"Big Top Pee-wee\" (1988), was less successful. Between 1986 and 1990, Reubens starred as Pee-wee in the CBS Saturday-morning children's program \"Pee-wee's Playhouse\".\nReubens was arrested for indecent exposure in an adult theater in Sarasota in 1991. The arrest set off a chain reaction of national media attention, though he received support from people in the entertainment industry. The arrest postponed Reubens's involvement in major projects until 1999, when he appeared in several big-budget projects including \"Mystery Men\" (1999) and \"Blow\" (2001). Reubens subsequently started giving interviews as himself rather than as Pee-wee.\nReubens acted in numerous shows such as \"Murphy Brown\", \"30 Rock\", \"Portlandia\", and \"The Blacklist\". He revived \"The Pee-wee Herman Show\", which he performed in Los Angeles and on Broadway, in 2010. He co-wrote and starred in the Netflix original film \"Pee-wee's Big Holiday\", reprising his role as Pee-wee Herman, in 2016.\nReubens's Pee-wee character maintained an enduring popularity with both children and adults. \"Playhouse\" garnered 15 Emmy Awards during its initial run, and was aired again on late-night television in the 2000s, during which \"TV Guide\" dubbed it among the top ten cult classic television programs. Reubens died in July 2023 from cancer.\nEarly life and education.\nReubens was born Paul Rubenfeld in Peekskill, New York, on August 27, 1952, and grew up in a Jewish family, where his parents, Judy (n\u00e9e Rosen) and Milton Rubenfeld, owned a lamp store. His mother was a teacher. His father was an automobile salesperson who had flown for Britain's Royal Air Force and for the U.S. Army Air Forces in World War II, and later became one of the founding pilots of the Israeli Air Force during the 1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War. An Orthodox Jew, he was one of five Jewish pilots to fly against Arab forces in smuggled fighter planes.\nReubens had two younger siblings: Luke (born 1958), a dog trainer, and Abby (born 1953), an attorney and a board member of the American Civil Liberties Union of Tennessee.\nReubens spent his early childhood in Oneonta, New York before moving with his parents to Sarasota, Florida at the age of nine. As a child, he frequented the Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus, whose winter headquarters were in Sarasota. The circus atmosphere sparked Reubens's interest in entertainment and influenced his later work. He also loved to watch reruns of \"I Love Lucy\", which made him want to make people laugh. At age five, Reubens asked his father to build him a stage where he and his siblings would act out plays.\nReubens attended Sarasota High School, where he was named president of the National Thespian Society. He was accepted into Northwestern University's summer program for gifted high-school students, joined the local Asolo Theater, Players of Sarasota Theater, and appeared in several plays.\nAfter high school graduation, he attended Plymouth State University for one semester. He then attended Boston University. When he began auditioning for acting schools, he was turned down by the Juilliard School and Carnegie Mellon University. Reubens was accepted at the California Institute of the Arts, where he graduated with a BFA in Theatre in 1973. As a student, Reubens was described by \"The New Yorker\" as \"the wildest of a wild bunch\". He acted in a student film in Cher-inspired mermaid drag and kissed all of his classmates at a Valentine's Day kissing booth. Some of his CalArts classmates included Katey Sagal, Michael Richards and David Hasselhoff, who was his roommate for a time. Sagal described Reubens as her \"fantastically colorful best buddy\" down the hall from her in the dorm, who would listen to her play music on the piano. She recalled that Reubens's dorm room was like a real-life Pee-wee's Playhouse. \"He was the only one with a decorated dorm room, everyone else had posters with Scotch tape, and you'd go to his room and it was a party.\" After graduating, his early jobs in California included working in restaurant kitchens and as a Fuller Brush salesman.\nCareer.\n1977\u20131979: Comedy beginnings.\nIn the 1970s, Reubens began performing at local comedy clubs. Starting in 1977, he made 14 guest appearances on \"The Gong Show\", four of which involved a boy\u2013girl act he had developed with Charlotte McGinnis entitled \"The Hilarious Betty and Eddie\". During his stint on \"The Gong Show,\" Reubens introduced a Native American lounge-singer character named Jay Longtoe, decked out in sequined loincloth and feathered headdress. \"This doesn't say much for the audience,\" Reubens explains in the documentary \"Pee-wee as Himself\". \"But the audience ate it up and went crazy. So I was like, Hey, I'm getting laughs...I had no clue it was like a billion percent\u2014not even borderline racist\u2014I mean, it was full-on racist. Until Pee-wee Herman came along, I thought that was my ticket. I thought I would be propelled to stardom as a Native American lounge singer. Thank God that wasn't the case.\"\nHe soon joined the Los Angeles\u2013based improvisational comedy team the Groundlings. He remained a troupe member for six years, working with Bob McClurg, Edie McClurg, John Paragon, Susan Barnes, and Phil Hartman. Hartman and Reubens became friends, and they often wrote and worked together on material. In 1980, Reubens had a small part as a waiter in \"The Blues Brothers\".\nThe character of \"Pee-wee Herman\" originated during a 1978 improvisation exercise with the Groundlings, where Reubens came up with the idea of a man who wanted to be a comic but was so inept at telling jokes that it was obvious to the audience that he would never make it. Fellow Groundling Phil Hartman afterwards helped Reubens develop the character while another Groundling, John Paragon, helped write the show. Despite being compared to other famous characters, such as Herg\u00e9's Tintin and Collodi's Pinocchio, Reubens said that there was no specific source for \"Pee-wee\" other than a collection of ideas. Pee-wee's voice originated in 1970 when Reubens appeared in a production of \"Life with Father\", where he was cast as one of the most obnoxious characters in the play. For this role, Reubens adopted a cartoon-like way of speaking, which became Pee-wee's voice.\nPee-wee's first name came from a one-inch Pee Wee brand harmonica Reubens had as a child, and the surname Herman was the last name of an energetic boy Reubens knew from his youth. The original small, gray suit Pee-wee wore had been handmade for Groundlings Director and Founder Gary Austin, who passed it on to Reubens. The origin of the red tie is less clear, as Reubens claimed that \"someone\" handed him the \"little kid bow tie\" before a performance.\n1981\u20131984: \"The Pee-wee Herman Show\".\nReubens auditioned for the \"Saturday Night Live\" 1980\u20131981 season on the same day as comedian Gilbert Gottfried. Reubens told \"Entertainment Weekly\" hiring both was not an option because they were \"the same type of performer\", and he knew immediately Gottfried would get the job. He also told the \"San Francisco Chronicle\" he believed that \"the fix was in\" because Gottfried was friends with one of the producers. Reubens was so angry and bitter that he decided he would borrow money and start his own show in Los Angeles using the character he had been developing during the previous few years, \"Pee-wee Herman\".\nWith the help of other Groundlings like John Paragon, Phil Hartman, and Lynne Marie Stewart, Pee-wee acquired a small group of followers, and Reubens took his show to the Roxy Theatre where \"The Pee-wee Herman Show\" ran for five sellout months. He performed midnight shows for adults and weekly matinees for children, later entering the mainstream when HBO aired \"The Pee-wee Herman Show\" in 1981 as part of their series \"On Location\". Reubens also appeared as Pee-wee in the 1980 film \"Cheech &amp; Chong's Next Movie\". He again appeared in 1981's \"Cheech &amp; Chong's Nice Dreams\"; the end credits of the film billed him as \"Hamburger Dude\". Reubens's act had mainly positive reactions and quickly acquired a group of fans, despite being described as \"bizarre\", and Reubens being described as \"the weirdest comedian around\". Pee-wee was both \"corny\" and \"hip\", \"retrograde\" and \"avant-garde\".\nWhen Pee-wee's fame started growing, Reubens started to move away from the spotlight, keeping his name under wraps and making all his public appearance and interviews in character while billing Pee-wee as playing himself; Reubens was trying to \"get the public to think that that was a real person\". Later on he would even prefer his parents be known only as Honey Herman and Herman Herman. In the early and mid-1980s, Reubens made several guest appearances on \"Late Night with David Letterman\" as Pee-wee Herman which gave Pee-wee an even bigger following. During the mid-1980s, Reubens traveled the United States with a whole new \"The Pee-wee Herman Show\", playing at the Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis, Caroline's in New York City and, in 1984, in front of a full Carnegie Hall.\n1985: \"Pee-wee's Big Adventure\".\nThe success of \"The Pee-wee Herman Show\" prompted Warner Bros. to hire Reubens to write a script for a full-length Pee-wee Herman film. Reubens's original idea was to do a remake of \"Pollyanna\", which Reubens claimed was his favorite film. Halfway through writing the script, Reubens noticed everyone at Warner Bros. had a bike with them, which inspired Reubens to start on a new script with Phil Hartman. The studio had approved a director for the film but it was a choice that neither the producers (William E. McEuen and Richard Gilbert Abramson) or Reubens felt was appropriate for the project. Taking inspiration from Sylvester Stallone, who refused to cede creative control to studios, Reubens turned down Warner Bros.'s choice for the director, and the studio then told him to find someone \"approvable, available, and affordable\" within a week.\nReubens had heard about Tim Burton at a party the same night that he had gotten permission from the studio to get an extension on his director search. \"I screened \"'Frankenweenie\" and I spoke to Shelley Duvall, who was a friend of mine who was in (the film),\" Reubens explained. \"I knew Tim was the director about 15 seconds into \"Frankenweenie\", like the second or third shot of it. I was looking at the wallpaper in this bedroom and the lighting and just going, 'This is the guy who has style and understands art direction.' Those were two really important things for me and my baby, I guess, and you know it just happened to luckily all work out.\" The film tells the story of Pee-wee Herman embarking on nationwide adventure in search of his stolen bicycle. The film went on to gross $40,940,662 domestically, recouping almost six times its $7\u00a0million budget. At the time of release in 1985, the film received mixed reviews, but \"Pee-wee's Big Adventure\" developed into a cult film.\n1986\u20131991: \"Pee-wee's Playhouse\".\nAfter seeing the success of \"Pee-wee's Big Adventure\", the CBS network approached Reubens with an ill-received cartoon series proposal. In 1986, CBS agreed to sign Reubens to act, produce, and direct his live-action children's program, \"Pee-wee's Playhouse\", with a budget of $325,000 per episode, the same price as a prime-time sitcom, and no creative interference from CBS; although CBS did request a few minor changes throughout the years. After casting actors like Laurence Fishburne and S. Epatha Merkerson, production began in New York City. The opening credits of the show were sung by Cyndi Lauper (under the pseudonym Ellen Shaw).\n\"Playhouse\" was designed as an educational yet entertaining and artistic show for children and, despite being greatly influenced by 1950s shows Reubens watched as a child like \"The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show\", \"The Mickey Mouse Club\", \"Captain Kangaroo\", and \"Howdy Doody\", it quickly acquired a dual audience of kids and grownups. Reubens, always trying to make Pee-wee a positive role model, created a consciously moral show, one that would teach children the Golden Rule. Reubens believed that children liked \"Playhouse\" because it was fast-paced, colorful and \"never talked down to them\"; while parents liked \"Playhouse\" because it reminded them of the past.\nIn 1986, Reubens (billed as Paul Mall) was the voice of the ship's computer in \"Flight of the Navigator\". In 1987, Reubens provided the voice for the pilot droid RX-24 a.k.a. Captain \"Rex\" in Star Tours, a \"Star Wars\"-themed motion simulator attraction at Disneyland and Disney-MGM Studios at Walt Disney World, and Disneyland Paris. He also reprised the role of Pee-wee Herman in cameo appearances in the film \"Back to the Beach\" and TV show \"Sesame Street\", the latter of which made a cameo in \"Playhouse\".\nRight after the success of \"Pee-wee's Big Adventure\", Reubens began working with Paramount Pictures on a sequel entitled \"Big Top Pee-wee\". Reubens and George McGrath's script was directed by \"Grease\" director Randal Kleiser. The film was not as successful as its predecessor, receiving mild reviews and doing just over one third as well in the box office, earning only $15\u00a0million.\"Pee-wee's Playhouse\" aired from September 13, 1986, until November 10, 1990. Reubens had originally agreed to do two more seasons after the third, and when CBS asked Reubens about the possibility of a sixth season he declined, wanting to take a sabbatical. Reubens had been suffering from burnout from playing Pee-wee full-time and had been warning that Pee-wee was temporary and that he had other ideas he would like to work on. The parties agreed to end the show after five seasons, which included 45 episodes and a Christmas Special. \"Playhouse\" garnered 22 Emmy Awards.\n1992\u20132002: Public retreat and comeback.\nAfter his 1991 arrest (see below), Reubens kept a low profile, dedicating himself to writing and collecting a variety of things, \"everything from fake food, to lamps\", although he did do some dubbing and took small parts in films such as 1992's \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" and Tim Burton's \"Batman Returns\" (Reubens portrayed the Penguin's father) and 1996's \"Matilda\" and \"Dunston Checks In\". In 1993, he voiced the character Lock in another one of Burton's productions, \"The Nightmare Before Christmas\". \"Pee-wee's Playhouse\" had already ended by the time Reubens was arrested. He cited an overworked crew and a decline in the show's quality in his decision against making a sixth season. The show's popularity and quantity of episodes had allowed for rerun broadcasts, but CBS canceled the reruns on July 29, 1991.\nDuring the mid-1990s, Reubens played a recurring role on the TV series \"Murphy Brown\". The role earned him positive reviews and his only non-Pee-wee Emmy nomination, for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series. He appeared six times on the show between 1995 and 1997. Afterward, Reubens began working on an NBC pilot entitled \"Meet the Muckles\", a show that would be based on \"You Can't Take It with You\". The project got stuck in development hell and was later dropped when Reubens's ideas grew too elaborate and expensive, although Philip Rosenthal blamed NBC's negative response on Reubens being on a \"blacklist\".\nBy 1999, Reubens had given several interviews as himself and made public appearances while promoting the film \"Mystery Men\", the first being on \"The Tonight Show with Jay Leno\" that year. He also starred in Dwight Yoakam's Western \"South of Heaven, West of Hell\", portraying a rapist and killer. In 2001, Reubens had his first extended television role since \"Playhouse\", as the host of the short-lived ABC game show \"You Don't Know Jack\", based on the video game series of the same name. It was cancelled after six episodes due to low ratings.\nReubens played a flamboyant hairdresser turned drug dealer in Ted Demme's 2001 drama \"Blow\", which starred Pen\u00e9lope Cruz and Johnny Depp. His performance was praised and he began receiving scripts for potential film projects.\n2004\u20132008: Cameos and guest appearances.\nReubens made cameos and guest appearances in numerous projects. He played Rick of the citizen's patrol on the popular Comedy Central series \"Reno 911!\", which gained him a small role in the 2007 film \"\". In 2006, he appeared in the second music video of the Raconteurs' song \"Steady, As She Goes\". The video has the band engaging in a comical soapbox car race, with Reubens playing the bad guy who sabotages the race.\nIn 2007, Reubens attended his own tribute at the SF Sketchfest, where he talked about his career with Ben Fong-Torres. He also signed with NBC to make a pilot on a show called \"Area 57\", a sitcom about a passive-aggressive alien, but it was not picked up for the 2007\u20132008 season. Reubens did, however, appear on the hit NBC series \"30 Rock\" as an inbred Austrian prince, a character Tina Fey created for him. He also made three guest appearances on FX's series \"Dirt\" playing a washed-up, alcoholic reporter named Chuck Lafoon. This time he was recommended for the role by \"Dirt\" star and close friend Courteney Cox. Cox's husband, David Arquette, then cast Reubens for his directorial debut, the 2007 film \"The Tripper\".\nIn June 2007, Reubens appeared as Pee-wee Herman at the Spike TV's Guys Choice Awards for the first time since 1992.\nReubens also had small parts dubbing or making cameos in a series of Cartoon Network projects such as the 2006 television film \"Re-Animated\", the animated cartoon series \"Chowder\", \"Tom Goes to the Mayor\", and \"Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!\".\nIn 2008, Reubens was slated to appear as homeopathic antidepressant salesman Alfredo Aldarisio in the third episode of \"Pushing Daisies\", but the role was recast with Ra\u00fal Esparza. Reubens instead appeared in the role of Oscar Vibenius in the series' 7th and 9th episodes.\nAlso, during 2008, Reubens did a PSA for Unscrew America, a website that aims to get people to change regular light bulbs for more energy-efficient ones in the form of CFLs and LED. He also appeared in Todd Solondz's \"Life During Wartime\".\nFrom 2009 to 2011, Reubens voiced Bat-Mite in \"\".\n2009\u20132023: Revival and later work.\nIn January 2009, Reubens hinted that negotiations were under way for his stage show to come back, and in August the return of \"The Pee-wee Herman Show\" was announced. Reubens said he felt Pee-wee calling, \"I just got up one day and felt like I'm gonna come back, that was it.\" The show is also a way to \"introduce Pee-wee to the new generation that didn't know about it\", preparing the way for Reubens's main project, the \"Playhouse\" film. Before this comeback, Reubens's present age and shape had been pointed out as a possible issue, since Pee-wee's slim figure and clean skin have been one of his trademarks. But after appearing for the first time since 1992 as Pee-wee at Spike TV's 2007 Guys Choice Awards, Reubens had remained optimistic and had jokingly said he's no longer nervous about being young Pee-wee again thanks to digital retouching.\nThe show was originally scheduled to begin November 8 and continue until the 29th at the Music Box Theatre in Hollywood. Due to high demand, the show moved to Club Nokia at LA Live and was scheduled to run between January 12 and February 7, 2010. To promote the show, Reubens once again gave interviews in character, appearing as a guest on \"The Jay Leno Show\", \"The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien\" (as well as O'Brien's subsequent Legally Prohibited Tour), and \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\", among others. A Twitter account, a Facebook account, and a new website were made for Pee-wee after the show changed venues.\nOn November 11, 2010, the show relocated to New York City for a limited run at the Stephen Sondheim Theatre, selling over $3\u00a0million in advance tickets. An extra performance was taped for the HBO network on January 6, 2011, and debuted March 19.\nFrom 2012 to 2013, Reubens contributed his voice talents to the animated series \"\" as Pavel. In 2014, Reubens appeared in TV on the Radio's music video for \"Happy Idiot\".\nIn February 2015, Netflix acquired the rights to produce a new Pee-wee film entitled \"Pee-wee's Big Holiday\" with Reubens and Judd Apatow producing the film, John Lee directing, and Reubens and Paul Rust writing the screenplay. The film released on March 18, 2016, on Netflix to positive reception.\nReubens went on to reprise his role as pilot droid Rex in , a \"Star Wars\"-themed land that opened at Disneyland and Disney's Hollywood Studios at Walt Disney World in 2019. Reubens previously portrayed the character in the original Star Tours attraction in 1987 and \"Star Wars Rebels\" in 2014. In Galaxy's Edge, the former Star Tours pilot droid RX-24 \u2013 \"Rex\" \u2013 has been reprogrammed into DJ R-3X, the house DJ of a bar and restaurant called Oga's Cantina.\nReubens also voiced Ivor in \"\", which he claimed to be among his favorite voice acting roles.\nUndeveloped scripts.\nWhen Reubens started giving interviews again after his 2002 arrest, he talked about the two scripts he had written for future Pee-wee Herman films.\nReubens once called his first script \"The Pee-wee Herman Story\", describing it as a black comedy. He also referred to the script as \"dark Pee-wee\" or \"adult Pee-wee\", with the plot involving Pee-wee becoming famous as a singer after making a hit single and moving to Hollywood, where \"he does everything wrong and becomes a big jerk\". Reubens further explained the film has many \"\"Valley of the Dolls\" moments\". Reubens thought this script would be the first one to start production, but in 2006 Reubens announced he was to start filming his second script in 2007.\nThe second film, a family-friendly adventure, is called \"Pee-wee's Playhouse: The Movie\" by Reubens, and follows Pee-wee and his \"Playhouse\" friends on a road-trip adventure, meaning that they would leave the house for the first time and go out into \"Puppetland\". All of the original characters of the show, live-action and puppets are included in Reubens's script. The story happens in a fantasy land that would be reminiscent of \"H.R. Pufnstuf\" and \"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\". In January 2009, Reubens told Gary Panter that the rejected first script of \"Pee-wee's Big Adventure\" (which they co-wrote) could have a film deal very soon and that it would be \"90 minutes of incredible beauty\". In December 2009, while in character, Reubens said this film is \"already done, the script is already fully written; It's ready to shoot.\" Most of the film will take place in Puppetland and claymation might be used.\nAlthough he did not reveal much about the scripts, he said that one of the two films opens in prison. He also said that using CGI for \"updating\" the puppets' looks could be an option, but it all depended on the budget the films would have. Reubens once mentioned the possibility of doing one of the two as an animated film along the lines of \"The Polar Express\" (2004), which uses performance capture technology, incorporating the movements of live actors into animated characters.\nReubens approached \"Pee-wee's Big Adventure\" director Tim Burton with one of the scripts and talked to Johnny Depp about the possibility of having him portray Pee-wee, but Burton was too busy, and Depp said he would have to think about it.\nIn January 2010, Reubens reprised his role as Pee-wee and reused the set of \"Pee-wee's Playhouse\" (albeit slightly modified) for a short sketch on Funny or Die. In the sketch, Pee-wee comes home and shows off a brand-new iPad given to him by Steve Jobs. This leads to a long argument between him and his puppet friends, who point out all of the iPad's disadvantages \u2013 even Conky himself points out its flaws by stating that \"it looks like a giant iPhone\". In the end, Pee-wee uses the iPad as a serving tray to hold glasses of milk and lemonade during a party being held at the Playhouse hours later. All the voices of the puppet characters are dubbed in by different actors than the TV series, except for Globey whose voice is still done by George McGrath.\nPersonal life.\nReubens never married or had children. In interviews conducted for the documentary \"Pee-wee as Himself\" (2025), which premiered after Reubens's death, he publicly acknowledged for the first time that he was gay. Reubens described a live-in relationship he had in the 1970s with a fellow CalArts student named Guy Brown, whom he credited with inspiring some of Pee-wee Herman's mannerisms. After the relationship ended, Reubens visited Brown in the hospital just hours before he died of an AIDS-related illness. Following that relationship, Reubens stated that he made a conscious decision to focus on his career, and never entered into another serious relationship except at the very end of his life. He was highly secretive about his sexuality for much of his lifetime: \"I was out of the closet, and then I went back in the closet. I wasn't pursuing the Paul Reubens career; I was pursuing the Pee-wee Herman career. [...] I was secretive about my sexuality even to my friends [out of] self-hatred or self-preservation. I was conflicted about sexuality. But fame was way more complicated.\"\nReubens maintained several platonic friendships with women, including some of his co-stars, some of which were incorrectly reported in the media as romantic. He attended the 1988 Academy Awards with \"Big Top Pee-wee\" co-star Valeria Golino, which stirred rumors that the two were dating. The following year, Reubens exchanged vows with Doris Duke's adopted daughter, Chandi Heffner, at a mock wedding over which Imelda Marcos presided, held at Shangri-La, Doris Duke's mansion in Honolulu, Hawaii. Reubens also dated actress Debi Mazar in 1993 after he began attending film premieres with her. He credited Mazar with helping him recover from depression caused by his 1991 arrest. According to Mazar, their relationship was platonic yet inseparable: \"we were best friends, and the truth of the matter is, basically, we had a love affair that was just cerebral.\" Reubens and his co-star Lynne Marie Stewart remained close, platonic friends until the end of his life. They were active with the Make-A-Wish Foundation, making appearances in character to bring joy to terminally ill children.\nLegal issues.\n1991 arrest.\nIn July 1991, Reubens was arrested in Sarasota, Florida, for indecent exposure while watching a film at an adult movie theater. During an unexpected police inspection, a detective detained Reubens, along with three others, as he was preparing to leave. When detectives examined his driver's license, Reubens told them \"I'm Pee-wee Herman\" and offered to perform a children's benefit for the sheriff's office \"to take care of this\". The next day, after a local reporter recognized Reubens' name, Reubens' attorney extended the same offer to the \"Sarasota Herald-Tribune\" in exchange for withholding the story. On the night of the arrest, Reubens traveled to Nashville, where his sister and lawyer lived, and then to New Jersey, where he stayed for the next few months at his friend Doris Duke's estate.\nThis was Reubens' third arrest in the county. In 1971, Reubens had been arrested in the same county for loitering and prowling near an adult theater, though charges had been dropped. His second arrest occurred in 1983, when Reubens was placed on two years of probation for possession of marijuana, although adjudication was withheld.\nThe 1991 arrest was widely covered and Reubens became the subject of late-night talk show ridicule. Disney-MGM Studios suspended a video from its studio tour that had shown Pee-wee explaining how voiceover tracks are produced. Toys \"R\" Us removed Pee-wee toys from its stores.\nReubens released a statement denying the charges. On November 7, 1991, he pleaded no contest. The plea avoided a charge on Reubens's record but obligated him to 75 hours of community service. As part of his service, he created, produced, and financed two antidrug public service announcements.\nDespite the negative publicity, many artists who knew Reubens, such as Cyndi Lauper, Annette Funicello, Zsa Zsa Gabor, and Valeria Golino, voiced support. Others who knew Reubens, such as \"Pee-wee's Playhouse\" production designer Gary Panter, S. Epatha Merkerson, and \"Big Top Pee-wee\" director Randal Kleiser, also spoke in support. Reubens's fans organized support rallies after CBS canceled the reruns, picketing in Los Angeles, New York, and San Francisco. The television news magazine \"A Current Affair\" received \"tens of thousands\" of responses to a Pee-wee telephone survey in which callers supported Reubens by a nine-to-one ratio.\nAlthough Reubens did not offer interviews or appear on talk shows after his arrest, he did appear in character as Pee-wee Herman at the 1991 MTV Video Music Awards on September 5, asking the audience, \"Heard any good jokes lately?\" He received a standing ovation. Reubens appeared as Pee-wee only once in 1992, when he participated in a \"Grand Ole Opry\" tribute to Minnie Pearl.\n2002\u20132004: Subsequent charges.\nIn November 2002, while filming David LaChapelle's video for Elton John's \"This Train Don't Stop There Anymore\", Reubens learned that police were at his home with a search warrant. Police were acting on a tip from actor Jeffrey Jones (at the time facing his own child pornography charges), finding among over 70,000 items of kitsch memorabilia, two grainy videotapes, and dozens of photographs that the city attorney's office characterized as a collection of \"child pornography.\" Kelly Bush, Reubens's personal representative at the time, said the description of the items was inaccurate and stated the objects were \"Rob Lowe's sex videotape\", and a few 30- to 100-year-old kitsch collectible images.\"\nReubens turned himself in to the Hollywood division of the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) and was charged with misdemeanor possession of obscene material improperly depicting a child under the age of 18 in sexual conduct. The district attorney looked at Reubens's collection and computer and found no grounds for bringing any felony charges against him, while the city attorney, Rocky Delgadillo, formally charged Reubens on the last day allowed by statute. Reubens was represented by Hollywood criminal defense lawyer Blair Berk.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n One thing I want to make very, very clear, I don't want anyone for one second to think that I am titillated by images of children. It's not me. You can say lots of things about me. And you might. The public may think I'm weird. They may think I'm crazy or anything that anyone wants to think about me. That's all fine. As long as one of the things you're not thinking about me is that I'm a pedophile. Because that's not true.\nPaul Reubens on the criminal charges made against him in 2002\nIn December, he pleaded not guilty through Berk. In March 2004, child pornography charges were dropped in exchange for Reubens's guilty plea to a lesser misdemeanor obscenity charge. For the next three years, he was required to register his address with the sheriff's office, and he could not be in the company of minors without the permission of their parent or legal guardian.\nReubens later stated that he was a collector of erotica, including films, muscle magazines, and a sizable collection of mostly homosexual vintage erotica, such as photographic studies of teen nudes. Reubens said that what the city attorney's office viewed as pornography he considered to be innocent art, and whether the memorabilia were pornographic images \"depends on what one sees in those images\". Reubens described the nude images as people \"one hundred percent not\" performing sexual acts.\nBeing an avid collector, Reubens often purchased bulk lots, and one of his vintage magazine dealers declared that \"there's no way\" he could have known the content of each page in the publications he bought, and the dealer recalled Reubens asking for \"physique magazines, vintage [1960s] material, but not things featuring kids\".\nDuring this ongoing legal issue, Reubens spent two years in Sarasota, Florida, caring for his terminally ill father, who died in February 2004 of cancer. In the 2025 documentary \"Pee-wee as Himself\", publicist Kelly Bush Novak recalls \"I got a call from Paul and he told me it absolutely wasn't true. He knew Jeffrey Jones and Jeffrey Jones was being accused of... improprieties and that person who accused him had been to Paul's house with Jeffrey and other people. And that person accused Paul of possession of child pornography.\"\nReception and legacy.\nReubens had not always thought of his character as one for children prior to the mid-1980s, when he became more selective of what should and should not be associated with Pee-wee. He was a heavy smoker and hired security to make sure that children never saw him with a cigarette while in costume. He refused to endorse candy bars and other unhealthy food; he said in 1999 that he had proposed \"Ralston Purina Pee-wee Chow cereal\", but the sugar-free product was not released due to a negative reaction in a blind taste test.\nPee-wee was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame by 1989, and successfully built a Pee-wee franchise, with toys, clothes, and other items generating more than $25\u00a0million at its peak in 1988. Reubens also published a book as Pee-wee in 1989 called \"Travels with Pee-Wee\". CBS aired reruns of \"Playhouse\" until July 1991, when Reubens was arrested, pulling from their schedule the last two remaining reruns. Fox Family Channel briefly aired reruns of the \"Playhouse\" in 1998. In early July 2006, Cartoon Network began running a teaser promo during its Adult Swim lineup. A later press release and many other promos confirmed that the show's 45 original episodes would air nightly from Monday to Thursday starting on that date. \"Playhouse\" attracted 1.5\u00a0million viewers nightly. In 2007, \"TV Guide\" named \"Playhouse\" one of the top 10 TV cult classics of all time. Several children's television personas cite Pee-wee Herman as an inspiration, including Steve Burns of \"Blue's Clues\" and Stephen Hillenburg of \"SpongeBob SquarePants\".\nIn November 2004, all 45 episodes of the \"Playhouse\", plus six episodes that had never before been released on home video, were released on DVD split between two box set collections. On July 3, 2013, Shout! Factory announced that they had acquired the rights to the entire series from Reubens, which was released on Blu-ray on October 21, 2014. In addition, the entire series was digitally remastered from the original 35mm film elements and original audio tracks.\nPee-wee's tight-fitting Glen plaid suits have made him a \"style icon\", with fashion houses and designers like Christopher Bailey, Ennio Capasa, Miuccia Prada, Viktor &amp; Rolf, and Thom Browne creating tightly cut suits with high armholes and short trousers that have been compared to Pee-wee's.\nReubens discussed plans for a museum, which would contain many of the \"Playhouse\" sets and props he owned.\nA two-part documentary series on Reubens's life, \"Pee-wee as Himself\", was released on HBO and Max on May 23, 2025. Reubens took part in the filming of the documentary prior to his death in 2023. The documentary won a Primetime Emmy in 2025 for Outstanding Documentary or Nonfiction Special.\nReubens reportedly completed writing his autobiography before his death which his estate hopes to publish posthumously.\nDeath.\nReubens died on July 30, 2023, at the age of 70, at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. The immediate cause of his death was acute hypoxic respiratory failure. At the time of his death he was diagnosed with both myelogenous leukemia and metastatic lung cancer. He had been diagnosed six years earlier, but had not revealed his diagnosis to the public.\nFollowing his death, a statement written by Reubens was released:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Please accept my apology for not going public with what I've been facing the last six years. I have always felt a huge amount of love and respect from my friends, fans and supporters. I have loved you all so much and enjoyed making art for you.\nReubens was cremated, and his remains were interred at Hollywood Forever Cemetery.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Some explanations put forth are escaped zoo or circus animals (as in the UK), or publicity stunts by local businesses using photographs from Australia. Others suggest outbreaks of such sightings are a form of mass psychogenic illness.\nFrance.\nA population of feral red-necked wallabies, often mis-identified as \"kangourous\", lives near the township of \u00c9manc\u00e9, about southwest of Paris. These wallabies are descended from a breeding population which escaped a zoological reserve in the 1970s.\nJapan.\nBetween 2002 and 2011, there was a series of phantom kangaroo sightings in the Mayama mountain district of \u014csaki, Miyagi city in Miyagi Prefecture.\nNew Zealand.\nIn 1831, after arriving in Australia, two sailors from the \"Sydney Packet\" reported that they had seen a \"giant kangaroo\", 30 feet (nine metres) tall, at a small cove in Dusky Sound, South Island. From a small boat, they observed it standing near the treeline, and when they came too close the animal jumped into the water and swam away, leaving a wake extending from one end of the sound to the other.\nKawau Island in the Hauraki Gulf has a colony of three species of wallabies descending from a deliberate introduction by Sir George Grey, a 19th century Governor.\nNew Zealand also has a wild population of wallabies in the Waimate District of South Island that were introduced for hunting in the late 19th century.\nUnited Kingdom.\nDocumented colonies of red-necked wallabies exist in the United Kingdom. A breeding colony established itself after breaking loose from a private zoo in Leek, Staffordshire in the 1930s. Their population seems to have peaked in the 1970s, reaching numbers between 60 and 70. There were no confirmed sightings of the wallabies between 2000 and 2007, with some locals believing they must have died out. In 2009, newspapers reported wallaby sightings (including clear pictures) that made reference to sightings in 2008. In recent years, BBC News has documented numerous wallaby sightings across the UK.\nInchconnachan, an island in Loch Lomond in Scotland, also has a population of wallabies after they were introduced by Lady Arran Colquhoun in the 1920s.\nSubsequent sightings have been made including a report of a Bennett\u2019s wallaby filmed by zoologist Maurice Melzak in Highgate Cemetery, Hampstead, London in October 2013, and an albino wallaby in Northamptonshire in 2015.&lt;br&gt;\nUnited States.\nIn 1934, near South Pittsburg, Tennessee, an atypical kangaroo or \"kangaroo-like beast\" was reported by several witnesses over a five-day period, and to have killed and partially devoured several animals, including ducks, geese, a German Shepherd and other dogs. Kangaroos are typically unaggressive and vegetarian. A witness described the animal as looking \"like a large kangaroo, running and leaping across a field.\" A search party followed the animal's tracks to a mountainside cave where they stopped. The animal was never found, and national news coverage drew widespread ridicule.\nIn 1974, in Chicago, Illinois, two Chicago police officers were called to investigate a report that a kangaroo was standing in someone's porch. After a brief search, the officers located the animal in an alleyway, but were unable to capture it. Over the next month, numerous kangaroo sightings were reported in Illinois and the neighbouring states of Indiana and Wisconsin, with timing suggesting more than one animal if reports were accurate. A kangaroo was seen the next day by a paperboy, the next week in , Illinois, and the week after that just outside Plano, Illinois, reported by a police officer who said it jumped eight feet from a field into the road. Thirty minutes later, a kangaroo was reported back in Chicago, then reported on the following three days in the surrounding countryside. A few days later, there were a rash of sightings in Indiana. Reports ceased about a month after the original story.\nIn 1978, in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin, two men photographed a large kangaroo beside the highway. Author Loren Coleman, described as the \"leading authority on North American kangaroo sightings\", suggested the animal looked like a Bennett's wallaby.\nIn 2013, in Oklahoma, a kangaroo was reportedly recorded by hunters in a field. The video was published on the website YouTube, and prompted speculation that the animal may be a pet kangaroo who went missing in the state just over a year earlier.\nAlso in 2013, \"The Ridgefield Press\" reported that a motorist in North Salem, New York captured on video what he thought was a kangaroo, and published the video on their website. The newspaper noted that escaped wallabies, smaller than kangaroos, were known in Westchester County, which encompasses North Salem. Several people in the county had kept wallabies as pets.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Founded in 1746 in Elizabeth as the College of New Jersey, Princeton is the fourth-oldest institution of higher education in the United States and one of the nine colonial colleges chartered before the American Revolution. The institution moved to Newark in 1747 and then to its Mercer County campus in Princeton nine years later. It officially became a university in 1896 and was subsequently renamed Princeton University.\nThe university is governed by the Trustees of Princeton University and has an endowment of $37.7 billion, the largest endowment per student in the United States. Princeton provides undergraduate and graduate instruction in the humanities, social sciences, natural sciences, and engineering to approximately 8,500 students on its main campus spanning within the borough of Princeton. It offers postgraduate degrees through the Princeton School of Public and International Affairs, the School of Engineering and Applied Science, the School of Architecture and the Bendheim Center for Finance. The university also manages the Department of Energy's Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory and is home to the NOAA's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory. It is classified among \"R1: Doctoral Universities \u2013 Very high research activity\" and has one of the largest university libraries in the world.\nPrinceton uses a residential college system and is known for its eating clubs for juniors and seniors. The university has over 500 student organizations. Princeton students embrace a wide variety of traditions from both the past and present. The university is an NCAA Division I school and competes in the Ivy League. The school's athletic team, the Princeton Tigers, has won the most titles in its conference and has sent many students and alumni to the Olympics.\nAs of October 2025, 81 Nobel laureates, 16 Fields Medalists and 17 Turing Award laureates have been affiliated with Princeton University as alumni, faculty members, or researchers. In addition, Princeton has been associated with 21 National Medal of Science awardees, 5 Abel Prize awardees, 11 National Humanities Medal recipients, 217 Rhodes Scholars, 137 Marshall Scholars, and\n62 Gates Cambridge Scholars. Two U.S. presidents, twelve U.S. Supreme Court justices (three of whom serve on the court ) and numerous living industry and media tycoons and foreign heads of state are all counted among Princeton's alumni body. Princeton has graduated many members of the U.S. Congress and the U.S. Cabinet, including eight secretaries of state, three secretaries of defense and two chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Princeton alumni also include 113 athletes who competed in the Olympics, winning 19 gold medals, 24 silver medals, and 23 bronze medals.\nHistory.\nFounding.\nPrinceton University, founded as the College of New Jersey, was shaped much in its formative years by the \"Log College\", a seminary founded by the Reverend William Tennent at Neshaminy, Pennsylvania, in about 1726. While no legal connection ever existed, many of the pupils and adherents from the Log College would go on to financially support and become substantially involved in the early years of the university. While early writers considered it as the predecessor of the university, the idea has been rebuked by Princeton historians.\nThe founding of the university itself originated from a split in the Presbyterian church following the Great Awakening. In 1741, New Light Presbyterians were expelled from the Synod of Philadelphia in defense of how the Log College ordained ministers. The four founders of the College of New Jersey, who were New Lights, were either expelled or withdrew from the Synod and devised a plan to establish a new college, for they were disappointed with Harvard and Yale's opposition to the Great Awakening and dissatisfied with the limited instruction at the Log College. They convinced three other Presbyterians to join them and decided on New Jersey as the location for the college, as at the time, there was no institution between Yale College in New Haven, Connecticut, and the College of William &amp; Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia; it was also where some of the founders preached. Although their initial request was rejected by the Anglican governor Lewis Morrison, the acting governor after Morrison's death, John Hamilton, granted a charter for the College of New Jersey on October 22, 1746. In 1747, approximately five months after acquiring the charter, the trustees elected Jonathan Dickinson as president and opened in Elizabeth, New Jersey, where classes were held in Dickinson's parsonage. With its founding, it became the fourth-oldest institution of higher education in the United States, and one of nine colonial colleges chartered before the American Revolution. The founders aimed for the college to have an expansive curriculum to teach people of various professions, not solely ministerial work. Though the school was open to those of any religious denomination, with many of the founders being of Presbyterian faith, the college became the educational and religious capital of Scotch-Irish Presbyterian America.\nColonial and early years.\nIn 1747, following the death of then President Jonathan Dickinson, the college moved from Elizabeth to Newark, New Jersey, as that was where presidential successor Aaron Burr Sr.'s parsonage was located. That same year, Princeton's first charter came under dispute by Anglicans, but on September 14, 1748, the recently appointed governor Jonathan Belcher granted a second charter. Belcher, a Congregationalist, had become alienated from his alma mater, Harvard, and decided to \"adopt\" the infant college. Belcher would go on to raise funds for the college and donate his 474-volume library, making it one of the largest libraries in the colonies.\nIn 1756, the college moved again to its present home in Princeton, New Jersey, because Newark was felt to be too close to New York. Princeton was chosen for its location in central New Jersey and by strong recommendation by Belcher. The college's home in Princeton was Nassau Hall, named for the royal William III of England, a member of the House of Orange-Nassau. The trustees of the College of New Jersey initially suggested that Nassau Hall be named in recognition of Belcher because of his interest in the institution; the governor vetoed the request.\nBurr, who would die in 1757, devised a curriculum for the school and enlarged the student body. Following the untimely death of Burr and the college's next three presidents, John Witherspoon became president in 1768 and remained in that post until his death in 1794. With his presidency, Witherspoon focused the college on preparing a new generation of both educated clergy and secular leadership in the new American nation. To this end, he tightened academic standards, broadened the curriculum, solicited investment for the college, and grew its size.\nA signatory of the Declaration of Independence, Witherspoon and his leadership led the college to becoming influential to the American Revolution. In 1777, the college became the site for the Battle of Princeton. During the battle, British soldiers briefly occupied Nassau Hall before eventually surrendering to American forces led by General George Washington. During the summer and fall of 1783, the Continental Congress and Washington met in Nassau Hall, making Princeton the country's capital for four months; Nassau Hall is where Congress learned of the peace treaty between the colonies and the British. The college did suffer from the revolution, with a depreciated endowment and hefty repair bills for Nassau Hall.\n19th century.\nIn 1795, President Samuel Stanhope Smith took office, the first alumnus to become president. Nassau Hall suffered a large fire that destroyed its interior in 1802, which Smith blamed on rebellious students. The college raised funds for reconstruction, as well as the construction of two new buildings. In 1807, a large student riot occurred at Nassau Hall, spurred by underlying distrust of educational reforms by Smith away from the Church. Following Smith's mishandling of the situation, falling enrollment, and faculty resignations, the trustees of the university offered resignation to Smith, which he accepted. In 1812, Ashbel Green was unanimously elected by the trustees of the college to become the eighth president. After the liberal tenure of Smith, Green represented the conservative \"Old Side\", in which he introduced rigorous disciplinary rules and heavily embraced religion. Even so, believing the college was not religious enough, he took a prominent role in establishing the Princeton Theological Seminary next door. While student riots were a frequent occurrence during Green's tenure, enrollment did increase under his administration.\nIn 1823, James Carnahan became president, arriving as an unprepared and timid leader. With the college riven by conflicting views between students, faculty, and trustees, and enrollment hitting its lowest in years, Carnahan considered closing the university. Carnahan's successor, John Maclean Jr., who was only a professor at the time, recommended saving the university with the help of alumni; as a result, Princeton's alumni association, led by James Madison, was created and began raising funds. With Carnahan and Maclean, now vice-president, working as partners, enrollment and faculty increased, tensions decreased, and the college campus expanded. Maclean took over the presidency in 1854, and led the university through the American Civil War. When Nassau Hall burned down again in 1855, Maclean raised funds and used the money to rebuild Nassau Hall and run the university on an austerity budget during the war years. With a third of students from the college being from the South, enrollment fell. Once many of the Southerners left, the campus became a sharp proponent for the Union, even bestowing an honorary degree to President Lincoln. James McCosh became the college's president in 1868, and lifted the institution out of a low period that had been brought about by the war. During his two decades of service, he overhauled the curriculum, oversaw an expansion of inquiry into the sciences, recruited distinguished faculty, and supervised the addition of a number of buildings in the High Victorian Gothic style to the campus. McCosh's tenure also saw the creation and rise of many extracurricular activities, like the Princeton Glee Club, the Triangle Club, the first intercollegiate football team, and the first permanent eating club, as well as the elimination of fraternities and sororities. In 1879, Princeton conferred its first doctorates on James F. Williamson and William Libby, both members of the Class of 1877.\nFrancis Patton took the presidency in 1888, and although his election was not met by unanimous enthusiasm, he was well received by undergraduates. Patton's administration was marked by great change, for Princeton's enrollment and faculty had doubled. At the same time, the college underwent large expansion and social life was changing in reflection of the rise in eating clubs and burgeoning interest in athletics. In 1893, the honor system was established, allowing for unproctored exams. In 1896, the college officially became a university, and as a result, it officially changed its name to Princeton University. In 1900, the Graduate School was formally established. Even with such accomplishments, Patton's administration remained lackluster with its administrative structure and towards its educational standards. Due to profile changes in the board of trustees and dissatisfaction with his administration, he was forced to resign in 1902.\n20th century.\nFollowing Patton's resignation, Woodrow Wilson, an alumnus and popular professor, was elected the 13th president of the university. Noticing falling academic standards, Wilson orchestrated significant changes to the curriculum, where freshman and sophomores followed a unified curriculum while juniors and seniors concentrated study in one discipline. Ambitious seniors were allowed to undertake independent work, which would eventually shape Princeton's emphasis on the practice for the future. Wilson further reformed the educational system by introducing the preceptorial system in 1905, a then-unique concept in the United States that augmented the standard lecture method of teaching with a more personal form in which small groups of students, or precepts, could interact with a single instructor, or preceptor, in their field of interest. The changes brought about many new faculty and cemented Princeton's academics for the first half of the 20th century. Due to the tightening of academic standards, enrollment declined severely until 1907. In 1906, the reservoir Lake Carnegie was created by Andrew Carnegie, and the university officially became nonsectarian. Before leaving office, Wilson strengthened the science program to focus on \"pure\" research and broke the Presbyterian lock on the board of trustees. However, he did fail in winning support for the permanent location of the Graduate School and the elimination of the eating clubs, which he proposed replacing with quadrangles, a precursor to the residential college system. Wilson also continued to keep Princeton closed off from accepting Black students. When an aspiring Black student wrote a letter to Wilson, he had his secretary reply telling him to attend a university where he would be more welcome.\nJohn Grier Hibben became president in 1912, and would remain in the post for two decades. On October 2, 1913, the Princeton University Graduate College was dedicated. When the United States entered World War I in 1917, Hibben allocated all available University resources to the government. As a result, military training schools opened on campus and laboratories and other facilities were used for research and operational programs. Overall, more than 6,000 students served in the armed forces, with 151 dying during the war. After the war, enrollment spiked and the trustees established the system of selective admission in 1922. From the 1920s to the 1930s, the student body featured many students from preparatory schools, zero Black students, and dwindling Jewish enrollment because of quotas. Aside from managing Princeton during WWI, Hibben introduced the senior thesis in 1923 as a part of The New Plan of Study. He also brought about great expansion to the university, with the creation of the School of Architecture in 1919, the School of Engineering in 1921, and the School of Public and International Affairs in 1930. By the end of his presidency, the endowment had increased by 374 percent, the total area of the campus doubled, the faculty experienced impressive growth, and the enrollment doubled.\nHibben's successor, Harold Willis Dodds would lead the university through the Great Depression, World War II, and the Korean Conflict. With the Great Depression, many students were forced to withdraw due to financial reasons. At the same time, Princeton's reputation in physics and mathematics surged as many European scientists left for the United States due to uneasy tension caused by Nazi Germany. In 1930, the Institute for Advanced Study was founded to provide a space for the influx of scientists, such as Albert Einstein. Many Princeton scientists would work on the Manhattan Project during the war, including the entire physics department. During World War II, Princeton offered an accelerated program for students to graduate early before entering the armed forces. Student enrollment fluctuated from month to month, and many faculty were forced to teach unfamiliar subjects. Still, Dodds maintained academic standards and would establish a program for servicemen, so they could resume their education once discharged.\n1945 to present.\nThe post-war years saw scholars renewing broken bonds through numerous conventions, expansion of the campus, and the introduction of distribution requirements. The period saw the desegregation of Princeton, which was stimulated by changes to the New Jersey constitution. Princeton began undertaking a sharper focus towards research in the years after the war, with the construction of Firestone Library in 1948 and the establishment of the Forrestal Research Center in nearby Plainsboro Township in the 1950s. Government sponsored research increased sharply, particularly in the physics and engineering departments, with much of it occurring at the new Forrestal campus. Though, as the years progressed, scientific research at the Forrestal campus declined, and in 1973, some of the land was converted to commercial and residential spaces.\nRobert Goheen would succeed Dodds by unanimous vote and serve as president until 1972. Goheen's presidency was characterized as being more liberal than previous presidents, and his presidency would see a rise in Black applicants, as well as the eventual coeducation of the university in 1969. During this period of rising diversity, the Third World Center (now known as the Carl A. Fields Center) was dedicated in 1971. Goheen also oversaw great expansion for the university, with square footage increasing by 80 percentage.\nThroughout the 1960s and 1970s, Princeton experienced unprecedented activism, with most of it centered on the Vietnam War. While Princeton activism initially remained relatively timid compared to other institutions, protests began to grow with the founding of a local chapter of Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) in 1965, which organized many of the later Princeton protests. In 1966, the SDS gained prominence on campus following picketing against a speech by President Lyndon B. Johnson, which gained frontpage coverage by the \"New York Times.\" A notable point of contention on campus was the Institute for Defense Analyses (IDA) and would feature multiple protests, some of which required police action. In 1967, SDS members and sympathizers beat the campus R.O.T.C. chapter in a game of touch football. As the years went on, the protests' agenda broadened to investments in South Africa, environmental issues, and women's rights. In response to these broadening protests, the Council of the Princeton University Community (CPUC) was founded to serve as a method for greater student voice in governance. Activism culminated in 1970 with a student, faculty, and staff member strike, so the university could become an \"institution against expansion of the war.\" Princeton's protests would taper off later that year, with \"The\" \"Daily Princetonian\" saying that, \"Princeton 1970\u201371 was an emotionally burned out university.\"\nIn 1982, the residential college system was officially established under Goheen's successor William G. Bowen, who would serve until 1988. During his presidency, Princeton's endowment increased from $625 million to $2 billion, and a major fundraising drive known as \"A Campaign for Princeton\" was conducted. President Harold T. Shapiro would succeed Bowen and remain president until 2001. Shapiro would continue to increase the endowment, expand academic programs, raise student diversity, and oversee the most renovations in Princeton's history. One of Shapiro's initiatives was the formation of the multidisciplinary Princeton Environmental Institute in 1994, renamed the High Meadows Environmental Institute in 2020. In 2001, Princeton shifted the financial aid policy to a system that replaced all loans with grants. That same year, Princeton elected its first female president, Shirley M. Tilghman. Before retiring in 2012, Tilghman expanded financial aid offerings and conducted several major construction projects like the Lewis Center for the Arts and a sixth residential college. Tilghman also led initiatives for more global programs, the creation of an office of sustainability, and investments into the sciences.\nPrinceton's 20th and current president, Christopher Eisgruber, was elected in 2013. In 2017, Princeton University unveiled a large-scale public history and digital humanities investigation into its historical involvement with slavery called the Princeton &amp; Slavery Project. The project saw the publication of hundreds of primary sources, 80 scholarly essays, a scholarly conference, a series of short plays, and an art project. In April 2018, university trustees announced that they would name two public spaces for James Collins Johnson and Betsey Stockton, enslaved people who lived and worked on Princeton's campus and whose stories were publicized by the project. In 2019, large-scale student activism again entered the mainstream concerning the school's implementation of federal Title IX policy relating to campus sexual assault. The activism consisted of sit-ins in response to a student's disciplinary sentence.\nIn April 2024, students joined other campuses across the United States in protests and establishing encampments against the Gaza war and the alleged genocide of Palestinians in Gaza. The protestors called for divestment from Israel, started a hunger strike and were joined by faculty. The sit-in of Clio Hall led to arrests by police. Activism and protests continued in the new academic year starting September 2024 with administrators facing calls for resignation from faculty.\nCoeducation.\nPrinceton explicitly prohibited the admission of women from its founding in 1746 until 1969. Since it lacked an affiliated women's college, it was often referred to as a \"monastery\", both lovingly and derisively, by members of the Princeton community.\nFor about a decade, from 1887 to 1897, nearby Evelyn College for Women was largely composed of daughters of professors and sisters of Princeton undergraduates. While no legal connection existed, many Princeton professors taught there and several Princeton administrators, such as Francis Patton, were on its board of trustees. It closed in 1897 following the death of its founder, Joshua McIlvaine.\nIn 1947, three female members of the library staff enrolled in beginning Russian courses to deal with an increase in Russian literature in the library. In 1961, Princeton admitted its first female graduate student, Sabra Follett Meservey, who would go on to be the first woman to earn a master's degree at Princeton. Meservey was, at the time of her admission, already a member of the faculty at Douglass College within Princeton. The dean of the graduate school issued a statement clarifying that Meservey's admission was an exception, and that \"Princeton may permit other women in the future as special cases, but does not plan to make general admissions of women graduate students.\" The student-run \"Daily Princetonian\" ran four articles about Meservey in one issue, including an editorial lamenting the potential \"far reaching implications\" of Meservey's admission which concluded: \"Princeton is unique as an undergraduate men's college and must remain so.\" Eight more women enrolled the following year in the Graduate School. In 1964, T'sai-ying Cheng became the first woman at Princeton to receive a Ph.D. In 1963, five women came to Princeton for one year to study \"critical languages\" as undergraduates, but were not candidates for a Princeton degree. Following abortive discussions with Sarah Lawrence College to relocate the women's college to Princeton and merge it with the university in 1967, the administration commissioned a report on admitting women. The final report was issued in January 1969, supporting the idea. That same month, Princeton's trustees voted 24\u20138 in favor of coeducation and began preparing the institution for the transition. The university finished these plans in April 1969 and announced there would be coeducation in September. Ultimately, 101 female freshman and 70 female transfer students enrolled at Princeton in September 1969. Those admitted were housed in Pyne Hall, a fairly isolated dormitory; a security system was added, although the women deliberately broke it within a day.\nIn 1971, Mary St. John Douglas and Susan Savage Speers became the first female trustees, and in 1974, quotas for men and women were eliminated. Following a 1979 lawsuit, the eating clubs were required to go coeducational in 1991, after an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court was denied. In 2001, Princeton elected its first female president.\nCampus.\nThe main campus consists of more than 200 buildings on in Princeton, New Jersey. The James Forrestal Campus, a smaller location designed mainly as a research and instruction complex, is split between nearby Plainsboro and South Brunswick. The campuses are situated about one hour from both New York City and Philadelphia on the train. The university also owns more than of property in West Windsor Township, and is where Princeton is planning to construct a graduate student housing complex, which will be known as \"Lake Campus North\".\nThe first building on campus was Nassau Hall, completed in 1756, and situated on the northern edge of the campus facing Nassau Street. The campus expanded steadily around Nassau Hall during the early and middle 19th century. The McCosh presidency (1868\u201388) saw the construction of a number of buildings in the High Victorian Gothic and Romanesque Revival styles, although many of them are now gone, leaving the remaining few to appear out of place. At the end of the 19th century, much of Princeton's architecture was designed by the Cope and Stewardson firm (led by the same University of Pennsylvania professors of architecture who designed a large part of Washington University in St. Louis and University of Pennsylvania) resulting in the Collegiate Gothic style for which Princeton is known for today. Implemented initially by William Appleton Potter, and later enforced by the university's supervising architect, Ralph Adams Cram, the Collegiate Gothic style remained the standard for all new building on the Princeton campus until 1960. A flurry of construction projects in the 1960s produced a number of new buildings on the south side of the main campus, many of which have been poorly received. Several prominent architects have contributed some more recent additions, including Frank Gehry (Lewis Library), I. M. Pei (Spelman Halls), Demetri Porphyrios (Whitman College, a Collegiate Gothic project), Robert Venturi and Denise Scott Brown (Frist Campus Center, among several others), Minoru Yamasaki (Robertson Hall), and Rafael Vi\u00f1oly (Carl Icahn Laboratory).\nA group of 20th-century sculptures scattered throughout the campus forms the Putnam Collection of Sculpture. It includes works by Alexander Calder (\"Five Disks: One Empty\"), Jacob Epstein (\"Albert Einstein\"), Henry Moore (\"Oval with Points\"), Isamu Noguchi (\"White Sun\"), and Pablo Picasso (\"Head of a Woman\"). Richard Serra's \"The Hedgehog and The Fox\" is located between Peyton and Fine halls next to Princeton Stadium and the Lewis Library.\nAt the southern edge of the campus is Lake Carnegie, an artificial lake named for Andrew Carnegie. Carnegie financed the lake's construction in 1906 at the behest of a friend and his brother who were both Princeton alumni. Carnegie hoped the opportunity to take up rowing would inspire Princeton students to forsake football, which he considered \"not gentlemanly.\" The Shea Rowing Center on the lake's shore continues to serve as the headquarters for Princeton rowing.\nPrinceton's grounds were designed by Beatrix Farrand between 1912 and 1943. Her contributions were most recently recognized with the naming of a courtyard for her. Subsequent changes to the landscape were introduced by Quennell Rothschild &amp; Partners in 2000. In 2005, Michael Van Valkenburgh was hired as the new consulting landscape architect for Princeton's 2016 Campus Plan. Lynden B. Miller was invited to work with him as Princeton's consulting gardening architect, focusing on the 17 gardens that are distributed throughout the campus.\nBuildings.\nNassau Hall.\nNassau Hall is the oldest building on campus. Begun in 1754 and completed in 1756, it was the first seat of the New Jersey Legislature in 1776, was involved in the Battle of Princeton in 1777, and was the seat of the Congress of the Confederation (and thus capitol of the United States) from June 30, 1783, to November 4, 1783. Since 1911, the front entrance has been flanked by two bronze tigers, a gift of the Princeton Class of 1879, which replaced two lions previously given in 1889. Starting in 1922, commencement has been held on the front lawn of Nassau Hall when there is good weather. In 1966, Nassau Hall was added to the National Register of Historic Places. Nowadays, it houses the office of the university president and other administrative offices.\nTo the south of Nassau Hall lies a courtyard that is known as Cannon Green. Buried in the ground at the center is the \"Big Cannon\", which was left in Princeton by British troops as they fled following the Battle of Princeton. It remained in Princeton until the War of 1812, when it was taken to New Brunswick. In 1836, the cannon was returned to Princeton and placed at the eastern end of town. Two years later, it was moved to the campus under cover of night by Princeton students, and in 1840, it was buried in its current location. A second \"Little Cannon\" is buried in the lawn in front of nearby Whig Hall. The cannon, which may also have been captured in the Battle of Princeton, was stolen by students of Rutgers University in 1875. The theft ignited the Rutgers-Princeton Cannon War. A compromise between the presidents of Princeton and Rutgers ended the war and forced the return of the Little Cannon to Princeton. The protruding cannons are occasionally painted scarlet by Rutgers students who continue the traditional dispute.\nArt Museum.\nThough art collection at the university dates back to its very founding, the Princeton University Art Museum was not officially established until 1882 by President McCosh. Its establishment arose from a desire to provide direct access to works of art in a museum for a curriculum in the arts, an education system familiar to many European universities at the time. The museum took on the purposes of providing \"exposure to original works of art and to teach the history of art through an encyclopedic collection of world art.\"\nNumbering over 112,000 objects, the collections range from ancient to contemporary art and come from Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Americas. The museum's art is divided into ten extensive curatorial areas. There is a collection of Greek and Roman antiquities, including ceramics, marbles, bronzes, and Roman mosaics from faculty excavations in Antioch, as well as other art from the ancient Egyptian, Byzantium, and Islamic worlds. The non-Islamic coins were catalogued by Dorothy B. Waage. Medieval Europe is represented by sculpture, metalwork, and stained glass. The collection of Western European paintings includes examples from the early Renaissance through the 19th century, with pieces by Monet, C\u00e9zanne, and Van Gogh, and features a growing collection of 20th-century and contemporary art, including paintings such as Andy Warhol's Blue Marilyn.\nThe museum features a collection of Chinese and Japanese art, with holdings in bronzes, tomb figurines, painting, and calligraphy, as well as collections of Korean, Southeast, and Central Asian art. Its collection of pre-Columbian art includes examples of Mayan and Olmec art, and its indigenous art ranges from Chile to Alaska to Greenland. The museum has collections of old master prints and drawings, and it has a comprehensive collection of over 20,000 photographs. Approximately 750 works of African art are represented. The Museum oversees the outside John B. Putnam Jr., Memorial Collection of Sculpture.\nUniversity Chapel.\nThe Princeton University Chapel is located on the north side of campus near Nassau Street. It was built between 1924 and 1928 at a cost of $2.3 million, approximately $ million adjusted for inflation in 2020. Ralph Adams Cram, the university's supervising architect, designed the chapel, which he viewed as the crown jewel for the Collegiate Gothic motif he had championed for the campus. At the time of its construction, it was the second largest university chapel in the world, after King's College Chapel, Cambridge. It underwent a two-year, $10 million restoration campaign between 2000 and 2002. The Chapel seats around 2,000 and serves as a site for religious services and local celebrations.\nMeasured on the exterior, the chapel is long, wide at its transepts, and high. The exterior is Pennsylvania sandstone, trimmed with Indiana limestone, and the interior is made of limestone and Aquia Creek sandstone. The design evokes characteristics of an English church of the Middle Ages. The extensive iconography, in stained glass, stonework, and wood carvings, has the common theme of connecting religion and scholarship.\nSustainability.\nPublished in 2008, the Sustainability Action Plan was the first formal plan for sustainability enacted by the university. It focused on reducing greenhouse gas emissions, conservation of resources, and research, education, and civic engagement for sustainability through 10 year objectives. Since the 2008 plan, Princeton has aimed at reducing its carbon dioxide emissions to 1990 levels without the purchase of market offsets and predicts to meet the goal by 2026 (the former goal was by 2020 but COVID-19 requirements delayed this). Princeton released its second Sustainability Action Plan in 2019 on Earth Day with its main goal being reducing campus greenhouse gases to net zero by 2046 as well as other objectives building on those in the 2008 plan. In 2021, the university agreed to divest from thermal coal and tar sand segments of the fossil fuel industry and from companies that are involved in climate disinformation after student protest. Princeton is a member of the Ivy Plus Sustainability Consortium, through which it has committed to best-practice sharing and the ongoing exchange of campus sustainability solutions along with other member institutions.\nPrinceton's Sustainability Action Plan also aims to have zero waste through recycling programs, sustainable purchasing, and behavioral and operational strategies.\nOrganization and administration.\nGovernance and structure.\nPrinceton's 20th and current president is Christopher Eisgruber, who was appointed by the university's board of trustees in 2013. The board is responsible for the overall direction of the university. It consists of no fewer than 23 and no more than 40 members at any one time, with the president of the university and the governor of New Jersey serving as ex officio members. It approves the operating and capital budgets, supervises the investment of the university's endowment, and oversees campus real estate and long-range physical planning. The trustees also exercise prior review and approval concerning changes in major policies such as those in instructional programs and admission as well as tuition and fees and the hiring of faculty members.\nThe university is composed of the Undergraduate College, the Graduate School, the School of Architecture, the School of Engineering and Applied Science, and the School of Public and International Affairs. Additionally, the school's Bendheim Center for Finance provides education for the area of money and finance in lieu of a business school. Princeton did host a Princeton Law School for a short period, before eventually closing in 1852 due to poor income. Princeton's lack of other professional schools can be attributed to a university focus on undergraduates.\nThe university has ties with the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton Theological Seminary, Rutgers University, and the Westminster Choir College of Rider University. Princeton is a member of the Association of American Universities, the Universities Research Association, and the National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities. The university is accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education (MSCHE), with its last reaffirmation in 2014.\nFinances.\nPrinceton University's endowment of $37 billion (per 2021 figures) was ranked as the fourth largest endowment in the United States, and it had the greatest per-student endowment in the world at over $4.4 million per student. The endowment is sustained through continued donations and is maintained by investment advisers. Princeton's operating budget is over $2 billion per year, with 50% going to academic departments and programs, 33% to administrative and student service departments, 10% to financial aid departments, and 7% to the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory.\nAcademics.\nUndergraduate.\nPrinceton follows a liberal arts curriculum, and offers two bachelor's degrees to students: a Bachelor of Arts (A.B.) and a Bachelor of Science in Engineering (B.S.E.). Typically, A.B. students choose a major (called a concentration) at the end of sophomore year, while B.S.E. students declare at the end of their freshman year. Students must complete distribution requirements, departmental requirements, and independent work to graduate with either degree. A.B. students must complete distribution requirements in literature and the arts, science and engineering, social analysis, cultural difference, epistemology and cognition, ethical thought and moral values, historical analysis, and quantitative and computational reasoning; they must also have satisfactory ability in a foreign language. Additionally, they must complete two papers of independent work during their junior year\u2014known as the junior papers\u2014and craft a senior thesis to graduate; both revolve around the concentration they are pursuing. B.S.E. majors complete fewer courses in the humanities and social sciences and instead fulfill requirements in mathematics, physics, chemistry, and computer programming. They likewise must complete independent work, which typically involves a design project or senior thesis, but not the junior papers. A.B. majors must complete 31 courses, whereas B.S.E. majors must complete 36 courses.\nStudents can choose from either 36 concentrations or create their own. They can also participate in 55 interdisciplinary certificate programs; since Princeton does not offer an academic minor, the certificates effectively serve as one. Course structure is determined by the instructor and department. Classes vary in their format, ranging from small seminars to medium-sized lecture courses to large lecture courses. The latter two typically have precepts, which are extra weekly discussion sessions that are led by either the professor or a graduate student. The average class meeting time is 3\u20134 hours a week, although this can vary depending on the course. The student to faculty ratio is 5 to 1, and a majority of classes have fewer than 20 students. In the \"Fiske Guide to Colleges\", academic culture is considered as \"tight-knit, extremely hardworking, highly cooperative, and supportive.\"\nUndergraduates agree to adhere to an academic integrity policy called the Honor Code. Under the Honor Code, faculty do not proctor examinations; instead, the students proctor one another and must report any suspected violation to an Honor Committee made up of undergraduates. The Committee investigates reported violations and holds a hearing if it is warranted. An acquittal at such a hearing results in the destruction of all records of the hearing; a conviction results in the student's suspension or expulsion. Violations pertaining to all other academic work fall under the jurisdiction of the Faculty-Student Committee on Discipline. Undergraduates are expected to sign a pledge on their written work affirming that they have not plagiarized the work.\nGrade deflation policy.\nThe first focus on issues of grade inflation by the Princeton administration began in 1998 when a university report was released showcasing a steady rise in undergraduate grades from 1973 to 1997. Subsequent reports and discussion from the report culminated to when in 2004, Nancy Weiss Malkiel, the dean of the college, implemented a grade deflation policy to address the findings. Malkiel's reason for the policy was that an A was becoming devalued as a larger percentage of the student body received one. Following its introduction, the number of A's and average GPA on campus dropped, although A's and B's were still the most frequent grades awarded. The policy received mixed approval from both faculty and students when first instituted. Criticism for grade deflation continued through the years, with students alleging negative effects like increased competition and lack of willingness to choose challenging classes. Other criticism included job market and graduate school prospects, although Malkiel responded by saying that she sent 3,000 letters to numerous institutions and employers informing them. In 2009, transcripts began including a statement about the policy.\nIn October 2013, Princeton President Christopher Eisgruber created a faculty committee to review the deflation policy. In August 2014, the committee released a report recommending the removal of the policy and instead develop consistent standards for grading across individual departments. In October 2014, following a faculty vote, the numerical targets were removed in response to the report. In a 2020 analysis of undergraduate grades following the removal of a policy, there were no long-lasting effects, with the percent of students receiving A's higher than in 1998.\nGraduate.\nFor the 2019\u20132020 academic year, the Graduate School enrolled 2,971 students. Approximately 40% of the students were female, 42% were international, and 35% of domestic students were a member of a U.S. minority group. The average time to complete a doctoral degree was 5.7 years. The university awarded 318 Ph.D. degrees and 174 final master's degrees for the 2019\u20132020 academic year.\nThe Graduate School offers degrees in 42 academic departments and programs, which span the humanities, social sciences, natural sciences, and engineering. Doctoral education is available for all departments while master's degrees are only available in the architecture, engineering, finance, and public policy departments. Doctoral education focuses on original, independent scholarship whereas master's degrees focus more on career preparation in both public life and professional practice. Graduate students can also concentrate in an interdisciplinary program and be granted a certificate. Joint degrees are available for several disciplines, as are dual M.D./Ph.D. or M.P.A./J.D. programs.\nStudents in the graduate school can participate in regional cross-registration agreements, domestic exchanges with other Ivy League schools and similar institutions, and in international partnerships and exchanges.\nRankings.\nPrinceton is one of the world's most prominent research universities, featured at the top of \"U.S. News &amp; World Report\"'s national university rankings for the ninth consecutive year in 2024, as well as topping comparable lists by \"Forbes\" and \"The Wall Street Journal\".\nResearch.\nPrinceton is classified among \"R1: Doctoral Universities \u2013 Very high research activity.\" Based on data for the 2020 fiscal year, the university received approximately US$250 million in sponsored research for its main campus, with 81.4% coming from the government, 12.1% from foundations, 5.5% from industry, and 1.0% from private and other. An additional $120 million in sponsored research was for the Plasma Physics Lab; the main campus and the lab combined totaled to $370 million for sponsored research. Based on 2017 data, the university ranked 72nd among 902 institutions for research expenditures.\nBased on 2018 data, Princeton's National Academy Membership totaled to 126, ranking 9th in the nation. The university hosts 75 research institutes and centers and two national laboratories. Princeton is a member of the New Jersey Space Grant Consortium.\nLibrary system.\nThe Princeton University Library system houses over 13 million holdings through 11 buildings, including seven million bound volumes, making it one of the largest university libraries in the United States. Built in 1948, the main campus library is Firestone Library and serves as the main repository for the humanities and social sciences. Its collections include the autographed manuscript of F. Scott Fitzgerald's \"The Great Gatsby\" and George F. Kennan's Long Telegram. In addition to Firestone library, specialized libraries exist for architecture, art and archaeology, East Asian studies, engineering, music, public and international affairs, public policy and university archives, and the sciences. The library system provides access to subscription-based electronic resources and databases to students.\nNational laboratories.\nThe Department of Energy's Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory (PPPL) stemmed from Project Matterhorn, a top secret cold war project created in 1951 aimed at achieving controlled nuclear fusion. Princeton astrophysics professor Lyman Spitzer became the first director of the project and remained director until the lab's declassification in 1961 when it received its current name. Today, it is an institute for fusion energy research and plasma physics research.\nFounded in 1955 and located at Princeton's Forrestal Campus since 1968, the NOAA's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) conducts climate research and modeling. Princeton faculty, research scientists, and graduate scientists can participate in research with the lab.\nAdmissions and financial aid.\nAdmissions.\nPrinceton offers several methods to apply: the Common Application, the Coalition Application, and the QuestBridge Application. Princeton's application requires several writing supplements and submitting a graded written paper.\nPrinceton's undergraduate program is highly selective, admitting 5.8% of undergraduate applicants in the 2019\u20132020 admissions cycle (for the Class of 2024). The middle 50% range of SAT scores was 1470\u20131560, the middle 50% range of the ACT composite score was 33\u201335, and the average high school GPA was a 3.91. For graduate admissions, in the 2021\u20132022 academic year, Princeton received 12,553 applications for admission and accepted 1,322 applicants, with a yield rate of 51%.\nIn the 1950s, Princeton used an ABC system to function as a precursory early program, where admission officers would visit feeder schools and assign A, B, or C ratings to students. From 1977 to 1995, Princeton employed an early action program, and in 1996, transitioned to an early decision program. In September 2006, the university announced that all applicants for the Class of 2012 would be considered in a single pool, ending the school's early decision program. In February 2011, following decisions by the University of Virginia and Harvard University to reinstate their early admissions programs, Princeton announced it would institute a single-choice early action option for applicants, which it still uses.\nPrinceton reinstated its transfer students program in 2018 after a three decade moratorium; the program encourages applicants from low-income families, the military, and community colleges.\nCosts and financial aid.\nAs of the 2021\u20132022 academic year, the total cost of attendance is $77,690. 61% of all undergraduates receive financial aid, with the average financial aid grant being $57,251. Tuition, room, and board is free for families making up to $65,000, and financial aid is offered to families making up to $180,000. In 2001, expanding on earlier reforms, Princeton became the first university to eliminate the use of student loans in financial aid, replacing them with grants. In addition, all admissions are need-blind, and financial aid meets 100% of demonstrated financial need. The university does not use academic or athletic merit scholarships. In September 2022, Princeton announced that it would cover all costs for families earning $100,000 a year or less, with reduced costs for higher income families as well.\n\"Kiplinger\" magazine in 2019 ranked Princeton as the fifth best value school in a combined list comparing private universities, private liberal arts colleges, and public colleges, noting that the average graduating debt was $9,005. For its 2021 rankings, the \"U.S. News &amp; World Report\" ranked it second in its category for \"Best Value Schools\".\nStudent life and culture.\nResidential colleges.\nThe university guarantees housing for students for all four years, with more than 98% of undergraduates living on campus. Freshman and sophomores are required to live on campus, specifically in one of the university's seven residential colleges. Once put into a residential college, students have an upperclassmen residential college adviser to adjust to college life and a faculty academic adviser for academic guidance. Upperclassmen are given the option to keep living in the college or decide to move into upperclassmen dorms; upperclassmen still remain affiliated with their college even if they live somewhere else.\nEach residential college has its own distinct layout and architecture. Additionally, each college has its own faculty head, dean, director of studies, and director of student life. The colleges feature various amenities, such as dining halls, common rooms, laundry rooms, academic spaces, and arts and entertainment resources. Three of the colleges house both undergraduates and graduate students, while four house only undergraduates, and one houses just graduate students. Present-day residential colleges are:\nPrinceton's residential college system dates back to when university president Woodrow Wilson's proposed the creation of quadrangles. While the plan was vetoed, it eventually made a resurgence with the creation of Wilson Lodge (now known as First College) in 1957 to provide an alternative to the eating clubs. Wilson Lodge was dedicated as Wilson College in 1968 and served as an experiment for the residential college system. In 2020, Princeton University elected to change the name of Wilson College to First College after the recent deaths involving police brutality of black individuals. When enrollment increased in the 1970s, a university report in 1979 recommended the establishment of five residential colleges. Funding was raised within a year, leading to the development of Rockefeller College (1982), Mathey College (1983), Butler College (1983), and Forbes College (1984). Whitman College was founded and constructed in 2007 at a cost of $100 million. Butler's dorms were demolished in 2007 and a new complex was built in 2009. Butler and Mathey previously acted as only underclassmen colleges, but transitioned to four-year colleges in fall 2009. Princeton completed and opened two new residential colleges\u2014Yeh College and New College West\u2014at the beginning of the academic year in September 2022. The university plans to construct a new residential college named Hobson College where First College currently stands.\nPrinceton has one graduate residential college, known as the Graduate College, located on a hill about half a mile from the main campus. The location of the Graduate College was the result of a dispute between Woodrow Wilson and then-Graduate School Dean Andrew Fleming West. Wilson preferred a central location for the college; West wanted the graduate students as far as possible from the campus, and ultimately, he prevailed. The Graduate College is composed of a large Collegiate Gothic section crowned by Cleveland Tower, a memorial tower for former Princeton trustee Grover Cleveland. The tower also has 67 carillon bells, making it one of the largest carillons in the world. The attached New Graduate College provides a modern contrast in architectural style to the gothic Old Graduate College. Graduate students also have the option of living in student apartments.\nEating clubs and dining.\nEach residential college has a dining hall for students in the college, and they vary in their environment and food served. Upperclassmen who no longer live in the college can choose from a variety of options: join an eating club and choose a shared meal plan; join a dining co-op, where groups of students eat, prepare, and cook food together; or organize their own dining. The university offers kosher dining through the Center for Jewish Life and halal dining options for Muslim students in the dining halls.\nSocial life takes place primarily on campus and is involved heavily with one's residential college or eating club. Residential colleges host a variety of social events and activities, ranging from Broadway show outings to regular barbecues. Eating clubs, while not affiliated with the university, are co-ed organizations that serve as social centers, host events, and invite guest speakers. Additionally, they serve as a place of community for upperclassmen. Five of the clubs have first-serve memberships called \"sign-ins\" and six clubs use a selective process, in which students must \"bicker\". This requires prospective members to undergo an interviewing process. Each eating club has a fee to join which ranges from around $9,000 to $10,000. As a result, Princeton increases financial aid for upperclassmen, and the eating clubs also offer financial assistance. Cumulatively, there are ten clubs located on Prospect Avenue\u2014Cannon, Cap and Gown, Charter, Cloister, Colonial, Cottage, Ivy, Quadrangle, Tiger, and Tower\u2014and one located on Washington Road\u2014Terrace. Sixty-eight percent of upperclassmen are members of a club, with each one containing around 150 to 200 students\nCampus organizations.\nPrinceton hosts around 500 recognized student organizations and several campus centers. The Undergraduate Student Government (USG) serves as Princeton's student government. The USG funds student organization events, sponsors campus events, and represents the undergraduate student body when convening with faculty and administration.\nFounded in about 1765, the American Whig-Cliosophic Society is the nation's oldest collegiate political, literary, and debate society, and is the largest and oldest student organization on campus. The Whig-Clio Society has several subsidiary organizations, each specialized to different areas of politics: the Princeton Debate Panel, International Relations Council, Princeton Mock Trial, and Princeton Model Congress. The International Relations Council manages two Model United Nations conferences: the Princeton Diplomatic Invitational (PDI) for collegiate competition and the Princeton Model United Nations Conference (PMUNC) for high school competition.\nThere are several publications on campus and a radio station. Founded in 1876, \"The Daily Princetonian\", otherwise known as \"The Prince\", is the second oldest college daily student newspaper in the United States. Other publications include \"The Nassau Literary Review\", the \"Princeton Tory\", a campus journal of conservative thought, \"The Princeton Diplomat\", the only student-run magazine on global affairs, the \"Princeton Political Review\", the only multi-partisan political publication on campus, and the recently revived \"Princeton Progressive\", the only left-leaning political publication on campus, among others. Princeton's WPRB (103.3 FM) radio station is the oldest licensed college radio station in the nation.\nPrinceton is home to a variety of performing arts and music groups. Many of the groups are represented by the Performing Arts Council. Dating back to 1883, the Princeton Triangle Club is America's oldest touring musical-comedy theater group. It performs its annual Triangle Show every fall at the 1,000 seat McCarter Theatre, as well as original musical comedies, revues, and other shows throughout campus. Princeton's oldest choir is the Glee Club, which began in 1874. The comedic scramble Tiger Band was formed in 1919 and plays at halftime shows and other events. Other groups include the Princeton University Orchestra, the flagship symphony orchestra group founded in 1896, and the Princeton Symphony Orchestra, both of which perform at Alexander Hall.\nA cappella groups are a staple of campus life, with many holding concerts, informal shows, and arch sings. Arch sings are where a cappella performances are held in one of Princeton's many gothic arches. The oldest a cappella ensemble is the Nassoons, which were formed in 1941. All-male groups include the Tigertones (1946) and Footnotes (1959); all-female groups include the Tigerlilies (1971), Tigressions (1981), Wildcats (1987); the oldest coed a cappella group in the Ivy League is the Princeton Katzenjammers (1973), which was followed by the Roaring 20 (1983) and Shere Khan (1994).\nPrinceton features several campus centers for students that provide resources and information for students with certain identities. These include the Center for Jewish Life, the Davis International Center, the Carl A. Fields Center for Equality and Cultural Understanding, the Women's Center, and the LGBT Center. The Frist Campus Center and the Campus Club are additional facilities for the entire campus community that hold various activities and events.\nPrinceton features 15 chaplaincies and multiple religious student groups. The following faiths are represented on campus: Baha'i, Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, Judaism, Islam, Sikhism, and Unitarian Universalism.\nTraditions.\nPrinceton students partake in a wide variety of campus traditions, both past and present. Current traditions Princeton students celebrate include the ceremonial bonfire, which takes place on the Cannon Green behind Nassau Hall. It is held only if Princeton beats both Harvard University and Yale University at football in the same season. Another tradition is the use of traditional college cheers at events and reunions, like the \"Locomotive\", which dates back to before 1894. Princeton students abide by the tradition of never exiting the campus through FitzRandolph Gates until one graduates. According to tradition, anyone who exits campus before their graduation will not graduate. A more controversial tradition is Newman's Day, where some students attempt to drink 24 beers in the 24 hours of April 24. According to \"The New York Times\", \"the day got its name from an apocryphal quote attributed to Paul Newman: '24 beers in a case, 24 hours in a day. Coincidence? I think not.'\" Newman has spoken out against the tradition. One of the biggest traditions celebrated annually are Reunions, which are massive annual gatherings of alumni. At Reunions, a traditional parade of alumni and their families, known as the \"P-rade\", process through the campus.\nPrinceton also has several traditions that have faded into the past. One of them was clapper theft, the act of climbing to the top of Nassau Hall to steal the bell clapper, which rings to signal the start of classes on the first day of the school year. For safety reasons, the clapper was permanently removed. Another was the Nude Olympics, an annual nude and partially nude frolic in Holder Courtyard that used to take place during the first snow of the winter. Started in the early 1970s, the Nude Olympics went co-educational in 1979 and gained much notoriety with the American press. Due to issues of sexual harassment and safety reasons, the administration banned the Olympics in 2000 to the disappointment of students.\nAlma mater.\n\"Old Nassau\" has been Princeton University's school song since 1859, when it was written that year by freshman Harlan Page Peck. It was originally published in the \"Nassau Literary Magazine\", where it won the magazine's prize for best college song. After an unsuccessful attempt at singing it to \"Auld Lang Syne\"'s melody, Karl Langlotz, a Princeton professor, wrote the music for it. In 1987, the university changed the gendered lyrics of \"Old Nassau\" to reflect the school's co-educational student body.\nTransportation.\nTiger Transit is the bus system of the university, mostly open to the public and linking university campuses and areas around Princeton; routes are updated upon community feedback. The service sees an average of 3,500 boardings per day on weekdays and 1,100 boardings per day on weekends. NJ Transit provides bus service on the lines and rail service on the Dinky, a small commuter train that provides service to the Princeton Junction Station. Coach USA, through their subsidiary Suburban Transit, provides bus service to New York City and other destinations in New Jersey.\nStudent body.\nPrinceton has made significant progress in expanding the diversity of its student body in recent years. The 2021 admitted freshman class was one of the most diverse in the school's history, with 68% of students identifying as students of color. The university has worked to increase its enrollment of first-generation and low-income students in recent years. The median family income of Princeton students is $186,100, with 72% of students coming from the top 20% highest-earning families. In 2017, 22% of freshman qualified for federal Pell Grants, above the 16% average for the top 150 schools ranked by the \"U.S. News &amp; World Report\"; nationwide, the average was 44%. Based on data in a 2019 article in \"The Daily Princetonian,\" 10% of students hail from \"Bloomberg's\" 2018 list of \"100 richest places\", and that the top 20% of high schools send as many students to Princeton as the bottom 80%.\nIn 1999, 10% of the student body was Jewish, a percentage lower than those at other Ivy League schools. 16% of the student body was Jewish in 1985; the number decreased by 40% from 1985 to 1999. This decline prompted \"The Daily Princetonian\" to write a series of articles on the decline and its reasons. \"The New York Observer\" wrote that Princeton was \"long dogged by a reputation for anti-Semitism\" and that this history as well as Princeton's elite status caused the university and its community to feel sensitivity towards the decrease of Jewish students. In the \"Observer\", several theories are proposed for the drop, ranging from campus culture to changing admission policies to national patterns. As of 2021, according to the Center for Jewish Life on campus, the university has approximately 700 Jewish students. As of 2024, according to Hillel International, there are approximately 450 Jewish undergraduates at Princeton, comprising about 8.6% of the undergraduate student body. In addition, about 250 Jewish graduate students are enrolled at Princeton, comprising about 7.9% of the graduate student body. Consequently, as American Jews are accounting for 2.4% of the total US population, there are 358% more Jews among students at Princeton than Jews among the total US population, which makes Jewish students the best represented minority group at Princeton.\nStarting in 1967, African American enrollment surged from 1.7% to 10% but has stagnated ever since. Bruce M. Wright was admitted into the university in 1936 as the first African American; however, his admission was a mistake and when he got to campus he was asked to leave. Three years later Wright asked the dean for an explanation on his dismissal and the dean suggested to him that \"a member of your race might feel very much alone\" at Princeton University. Princeton would not admit its first Black students until in 1945 when Princeton instituted the V-12 program on campus. In 1947, John L. Howard, one of the four naval cadets admitted to the program, would become the first Black student to graduate with a bachelor's degree.\nAthletics.\nPrinceton supports organized athletics at three levels: varsity intercollegiate, club intercollegiate, and intramural. It also provides \"a variety of physical education and recreational programs\" for members of the Princeton community. Most undergraduates participate in athletics at some level. Princeton's colors are orange and black. The school's athletes are known as the \"Tigers\", and the mascot is a tiger. The Princeton administration considered naming the mascot in 2007, but the effort was dropped in the face of alumni and student opposition.\nVarsity.\nPrinceton hosts 37 men's and women's varsity sports. Princeton is an NCAA Division I school, with its athletic conference being the Ivy League. Its rowing teams compete in the Eastern Association of Rowing Colleges, and its men's volleyball team competes in the Eastern Intercollegiate Volleyball Association. Princeton's sailing team, though a club sport, competes at the varsity level in the MAISA conference of the Inter-Collegiate Sailing Association.\nPrinceton's football team competes in the Football Championship Subdivision of NCAA Division I with the rest of the Ivy League. Princeton played against Rutgers University in the first intercollegiate football game in the U.S. on November 6, 1869; Rutgers won the game. From 1877 until at least 1903, Princeton played football using rugby rules.\nAs of 2021, Princeton claims 28 national football championships, which would make it the most of any school, although the NCAA only recognizes 15 of the wins. With its last win being in 2018, Princeton has won 12 Ivy League championships. In 1951, Dick Kazmaier won Princeton its only Heisman Trophy, the last to come from the Ivy League.\nThe men's basketball program is noted for its success under Pete Carril, the head coach from 1967 to 1996. During this time, Princeton won 13 Ivy League titles and made 11 NCAA tournament appearances. Carril introduced the Princeton offense, an offensive strategy that has since been adopted by a number of college and professional basketball teams. Carril's final victory at Princeton came when the Tigers beat UCLA, the defending national champion, in the opening round of the 1996 NCAA tournament. On December 14, 2005, Princeton tied the record for the fewest points in a Division I game since the institution of the three-point line in 1986\u201387, when the Tigers scored 21 points in a loss against Monmouth University.\nPrinceton women's soccer team advanced to the NCAA Division I Women's Soccer Championship semi-finals in 2004, becoming the first Ivy League team to do so in a 64 team setting. The men's soccer team was coached from 1984 to 1995 by Princeton alumnus and future United States men's national team manager Bob Bradley, who lead the Tigers to win two Ivy League titles and make an appearance at the NCAA Final Four in 1993. Princeton's men's lacrosse program undertook a period of notable success from 1992 to 2001, during which time it won six national championships. In 2012, its field hockey team became the first in the Ivy League to win a national championship.\nPrinceton has won at least one Ivy League title every year since 1957, and it became the first university in its conference to win over 500 Ivy League athletic championships. From 1896 to 2018, 113 athletes from Princeton have competed in the Olympics, winning 19 gold medals, 24 silver medals, and 23 bronze medals.\nClub and intramural.\nIn addition to varsity sports, Princeton hosts 37 club sports teams, which are open to all Princeton students of any skill level. Teams compete against other collegiate teams both in the Northeast and nationally. The intramural sports program is also available on campus, which schedules competitions between residential colleges, eating clubs, independent groups, students, and faculty and staff. Several leagues with differing levels of competitiveness are available.\nIn the fall, freshman and sophomores participate in the intramural athletic competition called Cane Spree. Although the event centers on cane wrestling, freshman and sophomores compete in other sports and competitions. This commemorates a time in the 1870s when sophomores, angry with the freshmen who strutted around with fancy canes, stole all of the canes from the freshmen, hitting them with their own canes in the process.\nNotable people.\nAlumni.\nU.S. Presidents James Madison and Woodrow Wilson and vice presidents Aaron Burr, George M. Dallas, and John Breckinridge graduated from Princeton, as did Michelle Obama, the former First Lady of the United States. Former Chief Justice of the United States Oliver Ellsworth was an alumnus, as are current U.S. Supreme Court Associate Justices Samuel Alito, Elena Kagan, and Sonia Sotomayor. Alumnus Jerome Powell was appointed as Chair of the U.S. Federal Reserve Board in 2018. Pete Hegseth, 29th U.S. Secretary of Defense, is a 2003 graduate of Princeton.\nPrinceton graduates played a major role in the American Revolution, including the first and last Colonels to die on the Patriot side Philip Johnston and Nathaniel Scudder, as well as the highest ranking civilian leader on the British side David Mathews.\nNotable graduates of Princeton's School of Engineering and Applied Science include Apollo astronaut and commander of Apollo 12 Pete Conrad, Amazon CEO and founder Jeff Bezos, former chairman of Alphabet Inc. Eric Schmidt, and Lisa P. Jackson, former Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.\nActors Jimmy Stewart, Wentworth Miller, Jos\u00e9 Ferrer, David Duchovny, and Brooke Shields graduated from Princeton, as did composers Edward T. Cone and Milton Babbitt. Soccer-player alumna, Diana Matheson, scored the game-winning goal that earned Canada their Olympic bronze medal in 2012. Declan Farmer graduated in 2020 and has won multiple Paralympic Games gold medals and is the first U.S. sledge hockey player to score over 200 career goals.\nWriters Booth Tarkington, F. Scott Fitzgerald, and Eugene O'Neill attended but did not graduate. Writer Selden Edwards and poet W. S. Merwin graduated from Princeton. American novelist Jodi Picoult and author David Remnick graduated. Pulitzer prize-winning journalists Barton Gellman and Lorraine Adams, as well as Nobel Peace Prize laureate Maria Ressa, are Princeton alumni. William P. Ross, Principal Chief of the Cherokee Nation and founding editor of the \"Cherokee Advocate\", graduated in 1844.\nNotable graduate alumni include Allen Shenstone, Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, Thornton Wilder, Richard Feynman, Lee Iacocca, John Nash, Alonzo Church, Alan Turing, Terence Tao, Edward Witten, John Milnor, John Bardeen, Steven Weinberg, John Tate, and David Petraeus. Royals such as Prince Moulay Hicham of Morocco, Prince Turki bin Faisal Al Saud, and Queen Noor of Jordan attended Princeton.\nFaculty.\nAs of 2021, notable current faculty members included Angus Deaton, Robert Keohane, Edward W. Felten, Anthony Grafton, Peter Singer, Jim Peebles, Manjul Bhargava, Brian Kernighan, Betsy Levy Paluck and Robert P. George. Notable former faculty members include John Witherspoon, Walter Kaufmann, John von Neumann, Ben Bernanke, Paul Krugman, Joseph Henry, Toni Morrison, Joyce Carol Oates, Michael Mullen, Andrew Wiles, Jhumpa Lahiri, Cornel West, Daniel Kahneman, and alumnus Woodrow Wilson.\nAlbert Einstein, though on the faculty at the Institute for Advanced Study rather than at Princeton, came to be associated with the university through frequent lectures and visits on the campus.\nIn popular culture.\nPrinceton University is widely considered to be an institution that affiliates with and produces some of the most elite members of society. The university's reputation has made it a frequent reference in media.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWorks cited.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Its common name is derived from the French word \"passager\", meaning \"passing by\", due to the migratory habits of the species. The scientific name also refers to its migratory characteristics. The morphologically similar mourning dove (\"Zenaida macroura\") was long thought to be its closest relative, and the two were at times confused, but genetic analysis has shown that the genus \"Patagioenas\" is more closely related to it than the \"Zenaida\" doves.\nThe passenger pigeon was sexually dimorphic in size and coloration. The male was in length, mainly gray on the upperparts, lighter on the underparts, with iridescent bronze feathers on the neck, and black spots on the wings. The female was , and was duller and browner than the male overall. The juvenile was similar to the female, but without iridescence. It mainly inhabited the deciduous forests of eastern North America and was also recorded elsewhere, but bred primarily around the Great Lakes. The pigeon migrated in enormous flocks, constantly searching for food, shelter, and breeding grounds, and was once the most abundant bird in North America, numbering around 3 billion, and possibly up to 5 billion. A very fast flyer, the passenger pigeon could reach a speed of . The bird fed mainly on mast, and also fruits and invertebrates. It practiced communal roosting and communal breeding, and its extreme gregariousness may have been linked with searching for food and predator satiation.\nPassenger pigeons were hunted by Native Americans, but hunting intensified after the arrival of Europeans, particularly in the 19th century. Pigeon meat was commercialized as cheap food, resulting in hunting on a massive scale for many decades. There were several other factors contributing to the decline and subsequent extinction of the species, including shrinking of the large breeding populations necessary for preservation of the species and widespread deforestation, which destroyed its habitat. A slow decline between about 1800 and 1870 was followed by a rapid decline between 1870 and 1890. In 1900, the last confirmed wild bird was shot in southern Ohio. The last captive birds were divided in three groups around the turn of the 20th century, some of which were photographed alive. Martha, thought to be the last passenger pigeon, died on September 1, 1914, at the Cincinnati Zoo. The eradication of the species is a notable example of anthropogenic extinction.\nTaxonomy.\nSwedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus coined the binomial name \"Columba macroura\" for both the mourning dove and the passenger pigeon in the 1758 edition of his work \"Systema Naturae\" (the starting point of biological nomenclature), wherein he appears to have considered the two identical. This composite description cited accounts of these birds in two pre-Linnean books. One of these was Mark Catesby's description of the passenger pigeon, which was published in his 1731 to 1743 work \"Natural History of Carolina, Florida and the Bahama Islands\", which referred to this bird as \"Palumbus migratorius\", and was accompanied by the earliest published illustration of the species. Catesby's description was combined with the 1743 description of the mourning dove by George Edwards, who used the name \"C.\u00a0macroura\" for that bird. There is nothing to suggest Linnaeus ever saw specimens of these birds himself, and his description is thought to be fully derivative of these earlier accounts and their illustrations. In his 1766 edition of \"Systema Naturae\", Linnaeus dropped the name \"C.\u00a0macroura\", and instead used the name \"C.\u00a0migratoria\" for the passenger pigeon, and \"C.\u00a0carolinensis\" for the mourning dove. In the same edition, Linnaeus also named \"C.\u00a0canadensis\", based on \"Turtur canadensis\", as used by Mathurin Jacques Brisson in 1760. Brisson's description was later shown to have been based on a female passenger pigeon.\nIn 1827, William Swainson moved the passenger pigeon from the genus \"Columba\" to the new monotypic genus \"Ectopistes\", due in part to the length of the wings and the wedge shape of the tail. In 1906 Outram Bangs suggested that because Linnaeus had wholly copied Catesby's text when coining \"C.\u00a0macroura\", this name should apply to the passenger pigeon, as \"E.\u00a0macroura\". In 1918 Harry C. Oberholser suggested that \"C.\u00a0canadensis\" should take precedence over \"C.\u00a0migratoria\" (as \"E.\u00a0canadensis\"), as it appeared on an earlier page in Linnaeus' book. In 1952 Francis Hemming proposed that the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN) secure the specific name \"macroura\" for the mourning dove, and the name \"migratorius\" for the passenger pigeon, since this was the intended use by the authors on whose work Linnaeus had based his description. This was accepted by the ICZN, which used its plenary powers to designate the species for the respective names in 1955.\nEvolution.\nThe passenger pigeon was a member of the pigeon and dove family, Columbidae. The oldest known fossil of the genus is an isolated humerus (USNM 430960) known from the Lee Creek Mine in North Carolina in sediments belonging to the Yorktown Formation, dating to the Zanclean stage of the Pliocene, between 5.3 and 3.6 million years ago. Its closest living relatives were long thought to be the \"Zenaida\" doves, based on morphological grounds, particularly the physically similar mourning dove (now \"Z.\u00a0macroura\"). It was even suggested that the mourning dove belonged to the genus \"Ectopistes\" and was listed as \"E.\u00a0carolinensis\" by some authors, including Thomas Mayo Brewer. The passenger pigeon was supposedly descended from \"Zenaida\" pigeons that had adapted to the woodlands on the plains of central North America.\nThe passenger pigeon differed from the species in the genus \"Zenaida\" in being larger, lacking a facial stripe, being sexually dimorphic, and having iridescent neck feathers and a smaller clutch. In a 2002 study by American geneticist Beth Shapiro et al., museum specimens of the passenger pigeon were included in an ancient DNA analysis for the first time (in a paper focusing mainly on the dodo), and it was found to be the sister taxon of the cuckoo-dove genus \"Macropygia\". The \"Zenaida\" doves were instead shown to be related to the quail-doves of the genus \"Geotrygon\" and the \"Leptotila\" doves.\nA more extensive 2010 study instead showed that the passenger pigeon was most closely related to the New World \"Patagioenas\" pigeons, including the band-tailed pigeon (\"P.\u00a0fasciata\") of western North America, which are related to the Southeast Asian species in the genera \"Turacoena\", \"Macropygia\", and \"Reinwardtoena\". This clade is also related to the \"Columba\" and \"Streptopelia\" doves of the Old World (collectively termed the \"typical pigeons and doves\"). The authors of the study suggested that the ancestors of the passenger pigeon may have colonized the New World from South East Asia by flying across the Pacific Ocean, or perhaps across Beringia in the north.\nIn a 2012 study, the nuclear DNA of the passenger pigeon was analyzed for the first time, and its relationship with the \"Patagioenas\" pigeon was confirmed. In contrast to the 2010 study, these authors suggested that their results could indicate that the ancestors of the passenger pigeon and its Old World relatives may have originated in the Neotropical region of the New World.\nThe cladogram below follows the 2012 DNA study showing the position of the passenger pigeon among its closest relatives:\nDNA in old museum specimens is often degraded and fragmentary, and passenger pigeon specimens have been used in various studies to discover improved methods of analyzing and assembling genomes from such material. DNA samples are often taken from the toe pads of bird skins in museums, as this can be done without causing significant damage to valuable specimens. The passenger pigeon had no known subspecies. Hybridization occurred between the passenger pigeon and the Barbary dove (\"Streptopelia risoria\") in the aviary of Charles Otis Whitman (who owned many of the last captive birds around the turn of the 20th century, and kept them with other pigeon species) but the offspring were infertile.\nEtymology.\nThe genus name, \"Ectopistes\", translates as \"moving about\" or \"wandering\", while the specific name, \"migratorius\", indicates its migratory habits. The full binomial can thus be translated as \"migratory wanderer\". The English common name \"passenger pigeon\" derives from the French word \"\", which means \"to pass by\" in a fleeting manner. While the pigeon was extant, the name \"passenger pigeon\" was used interchangeably with \"wild pigeon\". The bird also gained some less-frequently used names, including blue pigeon, merne rouck pigeon, wandering long-tailed dove, and wood pigeon. In the 18th century, the passenger pigeon was known as \"tourte\" in New France (in modern Canada), but to the French in Europe it was known as \"tourtre\". In modern French, the bird is known as \"tourte voyageuse\" or \"pigeon migrateur\", among other names.\nIn the Native American Algonquian languages, the pigeon was called \"amimi\" by the Lenape, ' by the Ojibwe, and ' by the Kaskaskia Illinois. Other names in indigenous American languages include ' in Mohawk, and ', or \"lost dove\", in Choctaw. The Seneca people called the pigeon ', meaning \"big bread\", as it was a source of food for their tribes. Chief Simon Pokagon of the Potawatomi stated that his people called the pigeon ', and that the Europeans did not adopt native names for the bird, as it reminded them of their domesticated pigeons, instead calling them \"wild\" pigeons, as they called the native peoples \"wild\" men.\nDescription.\nThe passenger pigeon was sexually dimorphic in size and coloration. It weighed between . The adult male was about in length. It had a bluish-gray head, nape, and hindneck. On the sides of the neck and the upper mantle were iridescent display feathers that have variously been described as being a bright bronze, violet, or golden-green, depending on the angle of the light. The upper back and wings were a pale or slate gray tinged with olive brown, that turned into grayish-brown on the lower wings. The lower back and rump were a dark blue-gray that became grayish-brown on the upper tail-covert feathers. The greater and median wing-covert feathers were pale gray, with a small number of irregular black spots near the end. The primary and secondary feathers of the wing were a blackish-brown with a narrow white edge on the outer side of the secondaries. The two central tail feathers were brownish gray, and the rest were white.\nThe tail pattern was distinctive as it had white outer edges with blackish spots that were prominently displayed in flight. The lower throat and breast were richly pinkish-rufous, grading into a paler pink further down, and into white on the abdomen and undertail covert feathers. The undertail coverts also had a few black spots. The bill was black, while the feet and legs were a bright coral red. It had a carmine-red iris surrounded by a narrow purplish-red eye-ring. The wing of the male measured , the tail , the bill , and the tarsus was .\nThe adult female passenger pigeon was slightly smaller than the male at in length. It was duller than the male overall, and was a grayish-brown on the forehead, crown, and nape down to the scapulars, and the feathers on the sides of the neck had less iridescence than those of the male. The lower throat and breast were a buff-gray that developed into white on the belly and undertail-coverts. It was browner on the upperparts and paler buff brown and less rufous on the underparts than the male. The wings, back, and tail were similar in appearance to those of the male except that the outer edges of the primary feathers were edged in buff or rufous buff. The wings had more spotting than those of the male. The tail was shorter than that of the male, and the legs and feet were a paler red. The iris was orange red, with a grayish blue, naked orbital ring. The wing of the female was , the tail , the bill , and the tarsus was .\nThe juvenile passenger pigeon was similar in plumage to the adult female, but lacked the spotting on the wings, and was a darker brownish-gray on the head, neck, and breast. The feathers on the wings had pale gray fringes (also described as white tips), giving it a scaled look. The secondaries were brownish-black with pale edges, and the tertial feathers had a rufous wash. The primaries were also edged with a rufous-brown color. The neck feathers had no iridescence. The legs and feet were dull red, and the iris was brownish, and surrounded by a narrow carmine ring. The plumage of the sexes was similar during their first year.\nOf the hundreds of surviving skins, only one appears to be aberrant in color\u2014an adult female from the collection of Walter Rothschild, Natural History Museum at Tring. It is a washed brown on the upper parts, wing covert, secondary feathers, and tail (where it would otherwise have been gray), and white on the primary feathers and underparts. The normally black spots are brown, and it is pale gray on the head, lower back, and upper-tail covert feathers, yet the iridescence is unaffected. The brown mutation is a result of a reduction in eumelanin, due to incomplete synthesis (oxidation) of this pigment. This sex-linked mutation is common in female wild birds, but it is thought the white feathers of this specimen are instead the result of bleaching due to exposure to sunlight.\nThe passenger pigeon was physically adapted for speed, endurance, and maneuverability in flight, and has been described as having a streamlined version of the typical pigeon shape, such as that of the generalized rock dove (\"Columba livia\"). The wings were very long and pointed, and measured from the wing-chord to the primary feathers, and to the secondaries. The tail, which accounted for much of its overall length, was long and wedge-shaped (or graduated), with two central feathers longer than the rest. The body was slender and narrow, and the head and neck were small.\nThe internal anatomy of the passenger pigeon has rarely been described. Robert W. Shufeldt found little to differentiate the bird's osteology from that of other pigeons when examining a male skeleton in 1914, but Julian P. Hume noted several distinct features in a more detailed 2015 description. The pigeon's particularly large breast muscles indicated a powerful flight (musculus pectoralis major for downstroke and the smaller musculus supracoracoideus for upstroke). The coracoid bone (which connects the scapula, furcula, and sternum) was large relative to the size of the bird, , with straighter shafts and more robust articular ends than in other pigeons. The furcula had a sharper V-shape and was more robust, with expanded articular ends. The scapula was long, straight, and robust, and its distal end was enlarged. The sternum was very large and robust compared to that of other pigeons; its keel was deep. The overlapping uncinate processes, which stiffen the ribcage, were very well developed. The wing bones (humerus, radius, ulna, and carpometacarpus) were short but robust compared to other pigeons. The leg bones were similar to those of other pigeons.\nVocalizations.\nThe noise produced by flocks of passenger pigeons was described as deafening, audible for miles away, and the bird's voice as loud, harsh, and unmusical. It was also described by some as clucks, twittering, and cooing, and as a series of low notes, instead of an actual song. The birds apparently made croaking noises when building nests, and bell-like sounds when mating. During feeding, some individuals would give alarm calls when facing a threat, and the rest of the flock would join the sound while taking off.\nIn 1911, American behavioral scientist Wallace Craig published an account of the gestures and sounds of this species as a series of descriptions and musical notations, based on observation of C. O. Whitman's captive passenger pigeons in 1903. Craig compiled these records to assist in identifying potential survivors in the wild (as the physically similar mourning doves could otherwise be mistaken for passenger pigeons), while noting this \"meager information\" was likely all that would be left on the subject. According to Craig, one call was a simple harsh \"keck\" that could be given twice in succession with a pause in between. This was said to be used to attract the attention of another pigeon. Another call was a more frequent and variable scolding. This sound was described as \"kee-kee-kee-kee\" or \"tete! tete! tete!\", and was used to call either to its mate or towards other creatures it considered to be enemies. One variant of this call, described as a long, drawn-out \"tweet\", could be used to call down a flock of passenger pigeons passing overhead, which would then land in a nearby tree. \"Keeho\" was a soft cooing that, while followed by louder \"keck\" notes or scolding, was directed at the bird's mate. A nesting passenger pigeon would also give off a stream of at least eight mixed notes that were both high and low in tone and ended with \"keeho\". Overall, female passenger pigeons were quieter and called infrequently. Craig suggested that the loud, strident voice and \"degenerated\" musicality was the result of living in populous colonies where only the loudest sounds could be heard.\nDistribution and habitat.\nThe passenger pigeon was found across most of North America east of the Rocky Mountains, from the Great Plains to the Atlantic coast in the east, to the south of Canada in the north, and the north of Mississippi in the southern United States, coinciding with its primary habitat, the eastern deciduous forests. Within this range, it constantly migrated in search of food and shelter. It is unclear if the birds favored particular trees and terrain, but they were possibly not restricted to one type, as long as their numbers could be supported. It originally bred from the southern parts of eastern and central Canada south to eastern Kansas, Oklahoma, Mississippi, and Georgia in the United States, but the primary breeding range was in southern Ontario and the Great Lakes states south through states north of the Appalachian Mountains. Though the western forests were ecologically similar to those in the east, these were occupied by band-tailed pigeons, which may have kept out the passenger pigeons through competitive exclusion.\nThe passenger pigeon wintered from Arkansas, Tennessee, and North Carolina south to Texas, the Gulf Coast, and northern Florida, though flocks occasionally wintered as far north as southern Pennsylvania and Connecticut. It preferred to winter in large swamps, particularly those with alder trees; if swamps were not available, forested areas, particularly with pine trees, were favored roosting sites. There were also sightings of passenger pigeons outside of its normal range, including in several Western states, Bermuda, Cuba, and Mexico, particularly during severe winters. It has been suggested that some of these extralimital records may have been due to the paucity of observers rather than the actual extent of passenger pigeons; North America was then unsettled country, and the bird may have appeared anywhere on the continent except for the far west. There were also records of stragglers in Scotland, Ireland, and France, although these birds may have been escaped captives, or the records incorrect.\nMore than 130 passenger pigeon fossils have been found scattered across 25 US states, including in the La Brea Tar Pits of California. These records date as far back as 100,000 years ago in the Pleistocene era, during which the pigeon's range extended to several western states that were not a part of its modern range. The abundance of the species in these regions and during this time is unknown.\nEcology and behavior.\nThe passenger pigeon was nomadic, constantly migrating in search of food, shelter, or nesting grounds. In his 1831 \"Ornithological Biography\", American naturalist and artist John James Audubon described a migration he observed in 1813 as follows:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThese flocks were frequently described as being so dense that they blackened the sky and as having no sign of subdivisions. The flocks ranged from only above the ground in windy conditions to as high as . These migrating flocks were typically in narrow columns that twisted and undulated, and they were reported as being in nearly every conceivable shape. A skilled flyer, the passenger pigeon is estimated to have averaged during migration. It flew with quick, repeated flaps that increased the bird's velocity the closer the wings got to the body. It was equally adept and quick flying through a forest as through open space. A flock was also adept at following the lead of the pigeon in front of it, and flocks swerved together to avoid a predator. When landing, the pigeon flapped its wings repeatedly before raising them at the moment of landing. The pigeon was awkward when on the ground, and moved around with jerky, alert steps.\nThe passenger pigeon was one of the most social of all land birds. Estimated to have numbered three to five billion at the height of its population, it may have been the most numerous bird on Earth; researcher Arlie W. Schorger believed that it accounted for between 25 and 40 percent of the total land bird population in the United States. The passenger pigeon's historic population is roughly the equivalent of the number of birds that overwinter in the United States every year in the early 21st century. Even within their range, the size of individual flocks could vary greatly. In November 1859, Henry David Thoreau, writing in Concord, Massachusetts, noted that \"quite a little flock of [passenger] pigeons bred here last summer,\" while only seven years later, in 1866, one flock in southern Ontario was described as being wide and long, took 14 hours to pass, and held in excess of 3.5 billion birds. Such a number would likely represent a large fraction of the entire population at the time, or perhaps all of it. Most estimations of numbers were based on single migrating colonies, and it is unknown how many of these existed at a given time. American writer Christopher Cokinos has suggested that if the birds flew single file, they would have stretched around the Earth 22 times.\nA 2014 genetic study (based on coalescent theory and on \"sequences from most of the genome\" of three individual passenger pigeons) suggested that the passenger pigeon population experienced dramatic fluctuations across the last million years, due to their dependence on availability of mast (which itself fluctuates). The study suggested the bird was not always abundant, mainly persisting at around 1/10,000 the amount of the several billions estimated in the 1800s, with vastly larger numbers present during outbreak phases. Some early accounts also suggest that the appearance of flocks in great numbers was an irregular occurrence. These large fluctuations in population may have been the result of a disrupted ecosystem and have consisted of outbreak populations much larger than those common in pre-European times. The authors of the 2014 genetic study note that a similar analysis of the human population size arrives at an \"effective population size\" of between 9,000 and 17,000 individuals (or approximately 1/550,000th of the peak total human population size of 7 billion cited in the study).\nFor a 2017 genetic study, the authors sequenced the genomes of two additional passenger pigeons, as well as analyzing the mitochondrial DNA of 41 individuals. This study found evidence that the passenger-pigeon population had been stable for at least the previous 20,000 years. The study also found that the size of the passenger pigeon population over that time period was larger than the found in the 2014 genetic study. However, the 2017 study's \"conservative\" estimate of an \"effective population size\" of 13 million birds is still only about 1/300th of the bird's estimated historic population of approximately 3\u20135 billion before their \"19th century decline and eventual extinction.\" A similar study inferring human population size from genetics (published in 2008, and using human mitochondrial DNA and Bayesian coalescent inference methods) showed considerable accuracy in reflecting overall patterns of human population growth as compared to data deduced by other means\u2014though the study arrived at a human effective population size (as of 1600 AD, for Africa, Eurasia, and the Americas combined) that was roughly 1/1000 of the census population estimate for the same time and area based on anthropological and historical evidence.\nThe 2017 passenger-pigeon genetic study also found that, in spite of its large population size, the genetic diversity was very low in the species. The authors suggested that this was a side-effect of natural selection, which theory and previous empirical studies suggested could have a particularly great impact on species with very large and cohesive populations. Natural selection can reduce genetic diversity over extended regions of a genome through 'selective sweeps' or 'background selection'. The authors found evidence of a faster rate of adaptive evolution and faster removal of harmful mutations in passenger pigeons compared to band-tailed pigeons, which are some of passenger pigeons' closest living relatives. They also found evidence of lower genetic diversity in regions of the passenger pigeon genome that have lower rates of genetic recombination. This is expected if natural selection, via selective sweeps or background selection, reduced their genetic diversity, but not if population instability did. The study concluded that earlier suggestion that population instability contributed to the extinction of the species was invalid. Evolutionary biologist A. Townsend Peterson said of the two passenger-pigeon genetic studies (published in 2014 and 2017) that, though the idea of extreme fluctuations in the passenger-pigeon population was \"deeply entrenched,\" he was persuaded by the 2017 study's argument, due to its \"in-depth analysis\" and \"massive data resources.\"\nA communally roosting species, the passenger pigeon chose roosting sites that could provide shelter and enough food to sustain their large numbers for an indefinite period. The time spent at one roosting site may have depended on the extent of human persecution, weather conditions, or other, unknown factors. Roosts ranged in size and extent, from a few acres to or greater. Some roosting areas would be reused for subsequent years, others would only be used once. The passenger pigeon roosted in such numbers that even thick tree branches would break under the strain. The birds frequently piled on top of each other's backs to roost. They rested in a slumped position that hid their feet. They slept with their bills concealed by the feathers in the middle of the breast while holding their tail at a 45-degree angle. Dung could accumulate under a roosting site to a depth of over .\nIf the pigeon became alert, it would often stretch out its head and neck in line with its body and tail, then nod its head in a circular pattern. When aggravated by another pigeon, it raised its wings threateningly, but passenger pigeons almost never actually fought. The pigeon bathed in shallow water, and afterwards lay on each side in turn and raised the opposite wing to dry it.\nThe passenger pigeon drank at least once a day, typically at dawn, by fully inserting its bill into lakes, small ponds, and streams. Pigeons were seen perching on top of each other to access water, and if necessary, the species could alight on open water to drink. One of the primary causes of natural mortality was the weather, and every spring many individuals froze to death after migrating north too early. In captivity, a passenger pigeon was capable of living at least 15 years; Martha, the last known living passenger pigeon, was at least 17 and possibly as old as 29 when she died. It is undocumented how long wild pigeons lived.\nThe bird is believed to have played a significant ecological role in the composition of pre-Columbian forests of eastern North America. For instance, while the passenger pigeon was extant, forests were dominated by white oaks. This species germinated in the fall, therefore making its seeds almost useless as a food source during the spring breeding season, while red oaks produced acorns during the spring, which the pigeons devoured. The absence of the passenger pigeon's seed consumption may have contributed to the modern dominance of red oaks. Due to the immense amount of dung present at roosting sites, few plants grew for years after the pigeons left. Also, the accumulation of flammable debris (such as limbs broken from trees and foliage killed by excrement) at these sites may have increased both the frequency and intensity of forest fires, which would have favored fire-tolerant species, such as bur oaks, black oaks, and white oaks over less fire-tolerant species, such as red oaks, thus helping to explain the change in the composition of eastern forests since the passenger pigeon's extinction (from white oaks, bur oaks, and black oaks predominating in presettlement forests, to the \"dramatic expansion\" of red oaks today).\nA study released in 2018 concluded that the \"vast numbers\" of passenger pigeons present for \"tens of thousands of years\" would have influenced the evolution of the tree species whose seeds they ate. Those masting trees that produced seeds during the spring nesting season (such as red oaks) evolved so that some portion of their seeds would be too large for passenger pigeons to swallow (thus allowing some of their seeds to escape predation and grow new trees). White oak, in contrast, with its seeds sized consistently in the edible range, evolved an irregular masting pattern that took place in the fall, when fewer passenger pigeons would have been present. The study further concluded that this allowed white oaks to be the dominant tree species in regions where passenger pigeons were commonly present in the spring.\nWith the large numbers in passenger pigeon flocks, the excrement they produced was enough to destroy surface-level vegetation at long-term roosting sites, while adding high quantities of nutrients to the ecosystem. Because of this\u2014along with the breaking of tree limbs under their collective weight and the great amount of mast they consumed\u2014passenger pigeons are thought to have influenced both the structure of eastern forests and the composition of the species present there. Due to these influences, some ecologists have considered the passenger pigeon a keystone species, with the disappearance of their vast flocks leaving a major gap in the ecosystem. Their role in creating forest disturbances has been linked to greater vertebrate diversity in forests by creating more niches for animals to fill. To help fill that ecological gap, it has been proposed that modern land managers attempt to replicate some of their effects on the ecosystem by creating openings in forest canopies to provide more understory light.\nThe American chestnut trees that provided much of the mast on which the passenger pigeon fed was itself almost driven to extinction by an imported Asian fungus (chestnut blight) around 1905. As many as thirty billion trees are thought to have died as a result in the following decades, but this did not affect the passenger pigeon, which was already extinct in the wild at the time.\nAfter the disappearance of the passenger pigeon, the population of another acorn feeding species, the white-footed mouse, grew exponentially because of the increased availability of the seeds of the oak, beech, and chestnut trees. It has been speculated that the extinction of passenger pigeons may have increased the prevalence of tick-borne lyme disease in modern times as white-footed mice are the reservoir hosts of \"Borrelia burgdorferi\".\nDiet.\nBeeches and oaks produced the mast needed to support nesting and roosting flocks. The passenger pigeon changed its diet depending on the season. In the fall, winter, and spring, it mainly ate beechnuts, acorns, and chestnuts. During the summer, berries and softer fruits, such as blueberries, grapes, cherries, mulberries, pokeberries, and bunchberry, became the main objects of its consumption. It also ate worms, caterpillars, snails, and other invertebrates, particularly while breeding. It took advantage of cultivated grains, particularly buckwheat, when it found them. It was especially fond of salt, which it ingested either from brackish springs or salty soil.\nMast occurs in large quantities in different places at different times, and rarely in consecutive years, which is one of the reasons why the large flocks were constantly on the move. As mast is produced during autumn, there would have to be a large amount of it left by the summer, when the young were reared. It is unknown how they located this fluctuating food source, but their eyesight and flight powers helped them survey large areas for places that could provide food enough for a temporary stay.\nThe passenger pigeon foraged in flocks of tens or hundreds of thousands of individuals that overturned leaves, dirt, and snow with their bills in search of food. One observer described the motion of such a flock in search of mast as having a rolling appearance, as birds in the back of the flock flew overhead to the front of the flock, dropping leaves and grass in flight. The flocks had wide leading edges to better scan the landscape for food sources.\nWhen nuts on a tree loosened from their caps, a pigeon would land on a branch and, while flapping vigorously to stay balanced, grab the nut, pull it loose from its cap, and swallow it whole. Collectively, a foraging flock was capable of removing nearly all fruits and nuts from their path. Birds in the back of the flock flew to the front in order to pick over unsearched ground; however, birds never ventured far from the flock and hurried back if they became isolated. It is believed that the pigeons used social cues to identify abundant sources of food, and a flock of pigeons that saw others feeding on the ground often joined them. During the day, the birds left the roosting forest to forage on more open land. They regularly flew away from their roost daily in search of food, and some pigeons reportedly traveled as far as , leaving the roosting area early and returning at night.\nThe passenger pigeon's very elastic mouth and throat and a joint in the lower bill enabled it to swallow acorns whole. It could store large quantities of food in its crop, which could expand to about the size of an orange, causing the neck to bulge and allowing a bird quickly to grab any food it discovered. The crop was described as being capable of holding at least 17 acorns or 28 beechnuts, 11 grains of corn, 100 maple seeds, plus other material; it was estimated that a passenger pigeon needed to eat about of food a day to survive. If shot, a pigeon with a crop full of nuts would fall to the ground with a sound described as like the rattle of a bag of marbles. After feeding, the pigeons perched on branches and digested the food stored in their crop overnight with the aid of a muscular gizzard, which often contained gravel.\nThe pigeon could eat and digest of acorns per day. At the historic population of three billion passenger pigeons, this amounted to of food a day. The pigeon could regurgitate food from its crop when more desirable food became available. A 2018 study found that the dietary range of the passenger pigeon was restricted to certain sizes of seed, due to the size of its gape. This would have prevented it from eating some of the seeds of trees such as red oaks, black oaks, and the American chestnut. Specifically, the study found that between 13% and 69% of red oak seeds were too large for passenger pigeons to have swallowed, that only a \"small proportion\" of the seeds of black oaks and American chestnuts were too large for the birds to consume, and that all white oak seeds were sized within an edible range. They also found that seeds would be completely destroyed during digestion, which therefore hindered dispersal of seeds this way. Instead, passenger pigeons may have spread seeds by regurgitation, or after dying.\nReproduction.\nOther than finding roosting sites, the migrations of the passenger pigeon were connected with finding places appropriate for this communally breeding bird to nest and raise its young. It is not certain how many times a year the birds bred; once seems most likely, but some accounts suggest more. The nesting period lasted around four to six weeks. The flock arrived at a nesting ground around March in southern latitudes, and some time later in more northern areas. The pigeon had no site fidelity, often choosing to nest in a different location each year. The formation of a nesting colony did not necessarily take place until several months after the pigeons arrived on their breeding grounds, typically during late March, April, or May.\nThe colonies, which were known as \"cities\", were immense, ranging from to thousands of hectares in size, and were often long and narrow in shape (L-shaped), with a few areas untouched for unknown reasons. Due to the topography, they were rarely continuous. Since no accurate data was recorded, it is not possible to give more than estimates on the size and population of these nesting areas, but most accounts mention colonies containing millions of birds. The largest nesting area ever recorded was in central Wisconsin in 1871; it was reported as covering , with the number of birds nesting there estimated to be around 136,000,000. As well as these \"cities\", there were regular reports of much smaller flocks or even individual pairs setting up a nesting site. The birds do not seem to have formed as vast breeding colonies at the periphery of their range.\nCourtship took place at the nesting colony. Unlike other pigeons, courtship took place on a branch or perch. The male, with a flourish of the wings, made a \"keck\" call while near a female. The male then gripped tightly to the branch and vigorously flapped his wings up and down. When the male was close to the female, he then pressed against her on the perch with his head held high and pointing at her. If receptive, the female pressed back against the male. When ready to mate, the pair preened each other. This was followed by the birds billing, in which the female inserted its bill into and clasped the male's bill, shook for a second, and separated quickly while standing next to each other. The male then scrambled onto the female's back and copulated, which was then followed by soft clucking and occasionally more preening. John James Audubon described the courtship of the passenger pigeon as follows:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAfter observing captive birds, Wallace Craig found that this species did less charging and strutting than other pigeons (as it was awkward on the ground), and thought it probable that no food was transferred during their brief billing (unlike in other pigeons), and he therefore considered Audubon's description partially based on analogy with other pigeons as well as imagination.\nNests were built immediately after pair formation and took two to four days to construct; this process was highly synchronized within a colony. The female chose the nesting site by sitting on it and flicking her wings. The male then carefully selected nesting materials, typically twigs, and handed them to the female over her back. The male then went in search of more nesting material while the female constructed the nest beneath herself. Nests were built between above the ground, though typically above , and were made of 70 to 110 twigs woven together to create a loose, shallow bowl through which the egg could easily be seen. This bowl was then typically lined with finer twigs. The nests were about wide, high, and deep. Though the nest has been described as crude and flimsy compared to those of many other birds, remains of nests could be found at sites where nesting had taken place several years prior. Nearly every tree capable of supporting nests had them, often more than 50 per tree; one hemlock was recorded as holding 317 nests. The nests were placed on strong branches close to the tree trunks. Some accounts state that ground under the nesting area looked as if it had been swept clean, due to all the twigs being collected at the same time, yet this area would also have been covered in dung. As both sexes took care of the nest, the pairs were monogamous for the duration of the nesting.\nGenerally, the eggs were laid during the first two weeks of April across the pigeon's range. Each female laid its egg immediately or almost immediately after the nest was completed; sometimes the pigeon was forced to lay it on the ground if the nest was not complete. The normal clutch size appears to have been a single egg, but there is some uncertainty about this, as two have also been reported from the same nests. Occasionally, a second female laid its egg in another female's nest, resulting in two eggs being present. The egg was white and oval shaped and averaged in size. If the egg was lost, it was possible for the pigeon to lay a replacement egg within a week. A whole colony was known to re-nest after a snowstorm forced them to abandon their original colony. Both parents incubated The egg for 12 to 14 days, with the male incubating it from midmorning to midafternoon and the female incubating it the rest of the time.\nUpon hatching, the nestling (or squab) was blind and sparsely covered with yellow, hairlike down. The nestling developed quickly and within 14 days weighed as much as its parents. During this brooding period both parents took care of the nestling, with the male attending in the middle of the day and the female at other times. The nestlings were fed crop milk (a substance similar to curd, produced in the crops of the parent birds) exclusively for the first days after hatching. Adult food was gradually introduced after three to six days. After 13 to 15 days, the parents fed the nestling for a last time and then abandoned it, leaving the nesting area \"en masse\". The nestling begged in the nest for a day or two, before climbing from the nest and fluttering to the ground, whereafter it moved around, avoided obstacles, and begged for food from nearby adults. It was another three or four days before it fledged. The entire nesting cycle lasted about 30 days. It is unknown whether colonies re-nested after a successful nesting. The passenger pigeon sexually matured during its first year and bred the following spring.\nAlfred Russel Wallace, in his historic 1858 paper On the Tendency of Species to form Varieties; and on the Perpetuation of Varieties and Species by Natural Means of Selection, used the passenger pigeon as an example of an immensely successful species despite laying fewer eggs than most other birds:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;It would therefore appear that, as far as the continuance of the species and the keeping up the average number of individuals are concerned, large broods are superfluous. On the average all above one become food for hawks and kites, wild cats, and weasels, or perish of cold and hunger as winter comes on. This is strikingly proved by the case of particular species; for we find that their abundance in individuals bears no relation whatever to their fertility in producing offspring. Perhaps the most remarkable instance of an immense bird population is that of the passenger pigeon of the United States, which lays only one, or at most two eggs, and is said to rear generally but one young one. Why is this bird so extraordinarily abundant, while others producing two or three times as many young are much less plentiful? The explanation is not difficult. The food most congenial to this species, and on which it thrives best, is abundantly distributed over a very extensive region, offering such differences of soil and climate, that in one part or another of the area the supply never fails. The bird is capable of a very rapid and long-continued flight, so that it can pass without fatigue over the whole of the district it inhabits, and as soon as the supply of food begins to fail in one place is able to discover a fresh feeding-ground. This example strikingly shows us that the procuring a constant supply of wholesome food is almost the sole condition requisite for ensuring the rapid increase of a given species, since neither the limited fecundity, nor the unrestrained attacks of birds of prey and of man are here sufficient to check it. In no other birds are these peculiar circumstances so strikingly combined. Either their food is more liable to failure, or they have not sufficient power of wing to search for it over an extensive area, or during some season of the year it becomes very scarce, and less wholesome substitutes have to be found; and thus, though more fertile in offspring, they can never increase beyond the supply of food in the least favourable seasons.\nPredators and parasites.\nNesting colonies attracted large numbers of predators, including American minks (\"Neogale vison\"), long-tailed weasels (\"Neogale frenata\"), American martens (\"Martes americana\"), and raccoons (\"Procyon lotor\") that preyed on eggs and nestlings, birds of prey, such as owls, hawks, and eagles that preyed on nestlings and adults, and wolves (\"Canis lupus\"), foxes (\"Urocyon cinereoargenteus\" and \"Vulpes vulpes\"), bobcats (\"Lynx rufus\"), American black bears (\"Ursus americanus\"), and cougars (\"Puma concolor\") that preyed on injured adults and fallen nestlings. Hawks of the genus \"Accipiter\" and falcons pursued and preyed upon pigeons in flight, which in turn executed complex aerial maneuvers to avoid them; Cooper's hawk (\"Accipiter cooperii\") was known as the \"great pigeon hawk\" due to its successes, and these hawks allegedly followed migrating passenger pigeons. While many predators were drawn to the flocks, individual pigeons were largely protected due to the sheer size of the flock, and overall little damage could be inflicted on the flock by predation. Despite the number of predators, nesting colonies were so large that they were estimated to have a 90% success rate if not disturbed. After being abandoned and leaving the nest, the very fat juveniles were vulnerable to predators until they were able to fly. The sheer number of juveniles on the ground meant that only a small percentage of them were killed; predator satiation may therefore be one of the reasons for the extremely social habits and communal breeding of the species.\nTwo parasites have been recorded on passenger pigeons. One species of phtilopterid louse, \"Columbicola extinctus\", was originally thought to have lived on just passenger pigeons and to have become coextinct with them. This was proven inaccurate in 1999 when \"C.\u00a0extinctus\" was rediscovered living on band-tailed pigeons. This, and the fact that the related louse \"C.\u00a0angustus\" is mainly found on cuckoo-doves, further supports the relation between these pigeons, as the phylogeny of lice broadly mirrors that of their hosts. Another louse, \"Campanulotes defectus\", was thought to have been unique to the passenger pigeon, but is now believed to have been a case of a contaminated specimen, as the species is considered to be the still-extant \"Campanulotes flavus\" of Australia. There is no record of a wild pigeon dying of either disease or parasites.\nRelationship with humans.\nFor fifteen thousand years or more before the arrival of Europeans in the Americas, passenger pigeons and Native Americans coexisted in the forests of what would later become the eastern part of the continental United States. A study published in 2008 found that, throughout most of the Holocene, Native American land-use practices greatly influenced forest composition. The regular use of controlled burns, the girdling of unwanted trees, and the planting and tending of favored trees suppressed the populations of a number of tree species that did not produce nuts, acorns, or fruit, while increasing the populations of numerous tree species that did. In addition, the burning away of forest-floor litter made these foods easier to find, once they had fallen from the trees. Some have argued that such Native American land-use practices increased the populations of various animal species, including the passenger pigeon, by increasing the food available to them, while elsewhere it has been claimed that, by hunting passenger pigeons and competing with them for some kinds of nuts and acorns, Native Americans suppressed their population size. Genetic research may shed some light on this question. A 2017 study of passenger-pigeon DNA found that the passenger-pigeon population size was stable for 20,000 years prior to its 19th-century decline and subsequent extinction, while a 2016 study of ancient Native American DNA found that the Native American population went through a period of rapid expansion, increasing 60-fold, starting about 13\u201316 thousand years ago. If both of these studies are correct, then a great change in the size of the Native American population had no apparent impact on the size of the passenger-pigeon population. This suggests that the net effect of Native American activities on passenger-pigeon population size was neutral.\nThe passenger pigeon played a religious role for some northern Native American tribes. The Wyandot people (or Huron) believed that every twelve years during the Feast of the Dead, the souls of the dead changed into passenger pigeons, which were then hunted and eaten. Before hunting the juvenile pigeons, the Seneca people made an offering of wampum and brooches to the old passenger pigeons; these were placed in a small kettle or other receptacle by a smoky fire. The Ho-Chunk people considered the passenger pigeon to be the bird of the chief, as they were served whenever the chieftain gave a feast. The Seneca people believed that a white pigeon was the chief of the passenger pigeon colony, and that a Council of Birds decided that the pigeons had to give their bodies to the Seneca because they were the only birds that nested in colonies. The Seneca developed a pigeon dance as a way of showing their gratitude.\nFrench explorer Jacques Cartier was the first European to report on passenger pigeons, during his voyage in 1534. The bird was subsequently observed and noted by historical figures such as Samuel de Champlain and Cotton Mather. Most early accounts dwell on the vast number of pigeons, the resulting darkened skies, and the enormous amount of hunted birds (50,000 birds were reportedly sold at a Boston market in 1771). The early colonists thought that large flights of pigeons would be followed by ill fortune or sickness. When the pigeons wintered outside of their normal range, some believed that they would have \"a sickly summer and autumn.\" In the 18th and 19th centuries, various parts of the pigeon were thought to have medicinal properties. The blood was supposed to be good for eye disorders, the powdered stomach lining was used to treat dysentery, and the dung was used to treat a variety of ailments, including headaches, stomach pains, and lethargy. Though they did not last as long as the feathers of a goose, the feathers of the passenger pigeon were frequently used for bedding. Pigeon feather beds were so popular that for a time in Saint-J\u00e9r\u00f4me, Quebec, every dowry included a bed and pillows made of pigeon feathers. In 1822, one family in Chautauqua County, New York, killed 4,000 pigeons in a day solely for this purpose.\nThe passenger pigeon was featured in the writings of many significant early naturalists, as well as accompanying illustrations. Mark Catesby's 1731 illustration, the first published depiction of this bird, is somewhat crude, according to some later commentators. The original watercolor that the engraving is based on was bought by the British royal family in 1768, along with the rest of Catesby's watercolors. The naturalists Alexander Wilson and John James Audubon both witnessed large pigeon migrations first hand, and published detailed accounts wherein both attempted to deduce the total number of birds involved. The most famous and often reproduced depiction of the passenger pigeon is Audubon's illustration (handcolored aquatint) in his book \"The Birds of America\", published between 1827 and 1838. Audubon's image has been praised for its artistic qualities, but criticized for its supposed scientific inaccuracies. As Wallace Craig and R.\u00a0W. Shufeldt (among others) pointed out, the birds are shown perched and billing one above the other, whereas they would instead have done this side by side, the male would be the one passing food to the female, and the male's tail would not be spread. Craig and Shufeldt instead cited illustrations by American artist Louis Agassiz Fuertes and Japanese artist K.\u00a0Hayashi as more accurate depictions of the bird. Illustrations of the passenger pigeon were often drawn after stuffed birds, and Charles R. Knight is the only \"serious\" artist known to have drawn the species from life. He did so on at least two occasions; in 1903 he drew a bird possibly in one of the three aviaries with surviving birds, and some time before 1914, he drew Martha, the last individual, in the Cincinnati Zoo.\nThe bird has been written about (including in poems, songs, and fiction) and illustrated by many notable writers and artists, and is depicted in art to this day, for example in Walton Ford's 2002 painting \"Falling Bough\", and National Medal of Arts winner John A. Ruthven's 2014 mural in Cincinnati, which commemorates the 100th anniversary of Martha's death. The \"Project Passenger Pigeon\" outreach group used the centennial of its extinction to spread awareness about human-induced extinction, and to recognize its relevance in the 21st century. It has been suggested that the passenger pigeon could be used as a \"flagship\" species to spread awareness of other threatened, but less well-known North American birds.\nHunting.\nThe passenger pigeon was an important source of food for the people of North America. Native Americans ate pigeons, and tribes near nesting colonies would sometimes move to live closer to them and eat the juveniles, killing them at night with long poles. Many Native Americans were careful not to disturb the adult pigeons, and instead ate only the juveniles as they were afraid that the adults might desert their nesting grounds; in some tribes, disturbing the adult pigeons was considered a crime. Away from the nests, large nets were used to capture adult pigeons, sometimes up to 800 at a time. Low-flying pigeons could be killed by throwing sticks or stones. At one site in Oklahoma, the pigeons leaving their roost every morning flew low enough that the Cherokee could throw clubs into their midst, which caused the lead pigeons to try to turn aside and in the process created a blockade that resulted in a large mass of flying, easily hit pigeons. Among the game birds, passenger pigeons were second only to the wild turkey (\"Meleagris gallopavo\") in terms of importance for the Native Americans living in the southeastern United States. The bird's fat was stored, often in large quantities, and used as butter. Archaeological evidence supports the idea that Native Americans ate the pigeons frequently prior to colonization.\nWhat may be the earliest account of Europeans hunting passenger pigeons dates to January 1565, when the French explorer Ren\u00e9 Laudonni\u00e8re wrote of killing close to 10,000 of them around Fort Caroline in a matter of weeks:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThis amounted to about one passenger pigeon per day for each person in the fort.\nAfter European colonization, the passenger pigeon was hunted with more intensive methods than the more sustainable methods practiced by the natives. The passenger pigeon was of particular value on the frontier, and some settlements counted on its meat to support their population. The flavor of the flesh of passenger pigeons varied depending on how they were prepared. In general, juveniles were thought to taste the best, followed by birds fattened in captivity and birds caught in September and October. It was common practice to fatten trapped pigeons before eating them or storing their bodies for winter. Dead pigeons were commonly stored by salting or pickling the bodies; other times, only the breasts of the pigeons were kept, in which case they were typically smoked. In the early 19th century, commercial hunters began netting and shooting the birds to sell as food in city markets, and even as pig fodder. Once pigeon meat became popular, commercial hunting started on a prodigious scale.\nPassenger pigeons were shot with such ease that many did not consider them to be a game bird, as an amateur hunter could easily bring down six with one shotgun blast; a particularly good shot with both barrels of a shotgun at a roost could kill 61 birds. The birds were frequently shot either in flight during migration or immediately after, when they commonly perched in dead, exposed trees. Hunters only had to shoot toward the sky without aiming, and many pigeons would be brought down. The pigeons proved difficult to shoot head-on, so hunters typically waited for the flocks to pass overhead before shooting them. Trenches were sometimes dug and filled with grain so that a hunter could shoot the pigeons along this trench. Hunters largely outnumbered trappers, and hunting passenger pigeons was a popular sport for young boys. In 1871, a single seller of ammunition provided three tons of powder and 16 tons (32,000\u00a0lb) of shot during a nesting. In the latter half of the 19th century, thousands of passenger pigeons were captured for use in the sports shooting industry. The pigeons were used as living targets in shooting tournaments, such as \"trap-shooting\", the controlled release of birds from special traps. Competitions could also consist of people standing regularly spaced while trying to shoot down as many birds as possible in a passing flock. The pigeon was considered so numerous that 30,000 birds had to be killed to claim the prize in one competition.\nHumans used a wide variety of other methods to capture and kill passenger pigeons. Nets were propped up to allow passenger pigeons entry, and then closed by knocking loose the stick that supported the opening, trapping twenty or more pigeons inside. Tunnel nets were also used to great effect, and one particularly large net was capable of catching 3,500 pigeons at a time. These nets were used by many farmers on their own property as well as by professional trappers. Food would be placed on the ground near the nets to attract the pigeons. Decoy or \"stool pigeons\" (sometimes blinded by having their eyelids sewn together) were tied to a stool. When a flock of pigeons passed by, a cord would be pulled that made the stool pigeon flutter to the ground, making it seem as if it had found food, and the flock would be lured into the trap. Salt was also frequently used as bait, and many trappers set up near salt springs. At least one trapper used alcohol-soaked grain as bait to intoxicate the birds and make them easier to kill. Another method of capture was to hunt at a nesting colony, particularly during the period of a few days after the adult pigeons abandoned their nestlings, but before the nestlings could fly. Some hunters used sticks to poke the nestlings out of the nest, while others shot the bottom of a nest with a blunt arrow to dislodge the pigeon. Others cut down a nesting tree in such a way that when it fell, it would also hit a second nesting tree and dislodge the pigeons within. In one case, of large trees were speedily cut down to get birds, and such methods were common. A severe method was to set fire to the base of a tree nested with pigeons; the adults would flee and the juveniles would fall to the ground. Sulfur was sometimes burned beneath the nesting tree to suffocate the birds, which fell out of the tree in a weakened state.\nBy the mid-19th century, railroads had opened new opportunities for pigeon hunters. While it was once extremely difficult to ship masses of pigeons to eastern cities, railway access permitted pigeon hunting to become commercialized. An extensive telegraph system was introduced in the 1860s, which improved communication across the United States, making it easier to spread information about the whereabouts of pigeon flocks. After being opened up to the railroads, the town of Plattsburgh, New York, is estimated to have shipped 1.8 million pigeons to larger cities in 1851 alone at a price of 31 to 56 cents a dozen. By the late 19th century, the trade of passenger pigeons had become commercialized. Large commission houses employed trappers (known as \"pigeoners\") to follow the flocks of pigeons year-round. A single hunter is reported to have sent three million birds to eastern cities during his career. In 1874, at least 600 people were employed as pigeon trappers, a number which grew to 1,200 by 1881. Pigeons were caught in such numbers that by 1876, shipments of dead pigeons were unable to recoup the costs of the barrels and ice needed to ship them. The price of a barrel full of pigeons dropped to below fifty cents, due to overstocked markets. Passenger pigeons were instead kept alive so their meat would be fresh when killed, and sold once their market value had increased. Thousands of birds were kept in large pens, though the bad conditions led many to die from lack of food and water, and by fretting (gnawing) themselves; many rotted away before they could be sold.\nHunting of passenger pigeons was documented and depicted in contemporaneous newspapers, wherein various trapping methods and uses were featured. The most often reproduced of these illustrations was captioned \"Winter sports in northern Louisiana: shooting wild pigeons\", and published in 1875. Passenger pigeons were also seen as agricultural pests, because feeding flocks could destroy entire crops. The bird was described as a \"perfect scourge\" by some farming communities, and hunters were employed to \"wage warfare\" on the birds to save grain, as shown in another newspaper illustration from 1867 captioned as \"Shooting wild pigeons in Iowa\". When comparing these \"pests\" to the bison of the Great Plains, the valuable resource needed was not the species of animals but the agriculture which was consumed by said animal. The crops that were eaten were seen as marketable calories, proteins, and nutrients all grown for the wrong species.\nDecline and conservation attempts.\nThe notion that the species could be driven to extinction was alien to the early colonists, because the number of birds did not appear to diminish, and also because the concept of extinction was yet to be defined. The bird seems to have been slowly pushed westward after the arrival of Europeans, becoming scarce or absent in the east, though there were still millions of birds in the 1850s. The population must have been decreasing in numbers for many years, though this went unnoticed due to the apparent vast number of birds, which clouded their decline. In 1856 B\u00e9n\u00e9dict Henry R\u00e9voil may have been one of the first writers to voice concern about the fate of the passenger pigeon, after witnessing a hunt in 1847:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBy the 1870s, the decrease in birds was noticeable, especially after the last large-scale nestings and subsequent slaughters of millions of birds in 1874 and 1878. By this time, large nestings only took place in the north, around the Great Lakes. The last large nesting was in Petoskey, Michigan, in 1878 (following one in Pennsylvania a few days earlier), where 50,000 birds were killed each day for nearly five months. The surviving adults attempted a second nesting at new sites, but were killed by professional hunters before they had a chance to raise any young. Scattered nestings were reported into the 1880s, but the birds were now wary, and commonly abandoned their nests if persecuted.\nBy the time of these last nestings, laws had already been enacted to protect the passenger pigeon, but these proved ineffective, as they were unclearly framed and hard to enforce. H.\u00a0B. Roney, who witnessed the Petoskey slaughter, led campaigns to protect the pigeon, but was met with resistance, and accusations that he was exaggerating the severity of the situation. Few offenders were prosecuted, mainly some poor trappers, but the large enterprises were not affected. In 1857, a bill was brought forth to the Ohio State Legislature seeking protection for the passenger pigeon, yet a Select Committee of the Senate filed a report stating that the bird did not need protection, being \"wonderfully prolific\", and dismissing the suggestion that the species could be destroyed. Public protests against trap-shooting erupted in the 1870s, as the birds were badly treated before and after such contests. Conservationists were ineffective in stopping the slaughter. A bill was passed in the Michigan legislature making it illegal to net pigeons within of a nesting area. In 1897, a bill was introduced in the Michigan legislature asking for a 10-year closed season on passenger pigeons. Similar legal measures were passed and then disregarded in Pennsylvania. The gestures proved futile and, by the mid-1890s, the passenger pigeon had almost completely disappeared, and was probably extinct as a breeding bird in the wild. Small flocks are known to have existed at this point, since large numbers of birds were still being sold at markets. Thereafter, only small groups or individual birds were reported, many of which were shot on sight.\nLast survivors.\nThe last recorded nest and egg in the wild were collected in 1895 near Minneapolis. The last wild individual in Louisiana was discovered among a flock of mourning doves in 1896, and subsequently shot. Many late sightings are thought to be false or due to confusion with mourning doves. The last fully authenticated record of a wild passenger pigeon was near Oakford, Illinois, on March 12, 1901, when a male bird was killed, stuffed, and placed in Millikin University in Decatur, Illinois, where it remains today. This was not discovered until 2014, when writer Joel Greenberg found out the date of the bird's shooting while doing research for his book \"A Feathered River Across the Sky.\" Greenberg also pointed out a record of a male shot near Laurel, Indiana, on April 3, 1902, that was stuffed but later destroyed.\nFor many years, the last confirmed wild passenger pigeon was thought to have been shot near Sargents, Pike County, Ohio on March 24, 1900, when a boy named Press Clay Southworth killed a female bird with a BB gun. The boy did not recognize the bird as a passenger pigeon, but his parents identified it, and sent it to a taxidermist. The specimen, nicknamed \"Buttons\" due to the buttons used instead of glass eyes, was donated to the Ohio Historical Society by the family in 1915. The reliability of accounts after the Ohio, Illinois, and Indiana birds are in question. Ornithologist Alexander Wetmore claimed that he saw a pair flying near Independence, Kansas, in April 1905. On May 18, 1907, U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt claimed to have seen a \"flock of about a dozen two or three times on the wing\" while on retreat at his cabin in Pine Knot, Virginia, and that they lit on a dead tree \"in such a characteristically pigeon-like attitude\"; this sighting was corroborated by a local gentleman whom he had \"rambled around with in the woods a good deal\" and whom he found to be \"a singularly close observer.\" In 1910, the American Ornithologists' Union offered a reward of $3,000 for discovering a nest\u2014 .\nMost captive passenger pigeons were kept for exploitative purposes, but some were housed in zoos and aviaries. Audubon alone claimed to have brought 350 birds to England in 1830, distributing them among various noblemen, and the species is also known to have been kept at London Zoo. Being common birds, these attracted little interest, until the species became rare in the 1890s. By the turn of the 20th century, the last known captive passenger pigeons were divided in three groups; one in Milwaukee, one in Chicago, and one in Cincinnati. There are claims of a few further individuals having been kept in various places, but these accounts are not considered reliable today. The Milwaukee group was kept by David Whittaker, who began his collection in 1888, and possessed fifteen birds some years later, all descended from a single pair.\nThe Chicago group was kept by Charles Otis Whitman, whose collection began with passenger pigeons bought from Whittaker beginning in 1896. He had an interest in studying pigeons, and kept his passenger pigeons with other pigeon species. Whitman brought his pigeons with him from Chicago to Massachusetts by railcar each summer. By 1897, Whitman had bought all of Whittaker's birds, and upon reaching a maximum of 19 individuals, he gave seven back to Whittaker in 1898. Around this time, a series of photographs were taken of these birds; 24 of the photos survive. Some of these images have been reproduced in various media, copies of which are now kept at the Wisconsin Historical Society. It is unclear exactly where, when, and by whom these photos were taken, but some appear to have been taken in Chicago in 1896, others in Massachusetts in 1898, the latter by a J.\u00a0G. Hubbard. By 1902, Whitman owned sixteen birds. His pigeons laid many eggs, but few hatched, and many hatchlings died. A newspaper inquiry was published that requested \"fresh blood\" to the flock which had now ceased breeding. By 1907, he was down to two female passenger pigeons that died that winter, and was left with two infertile male hybrids, whose subsequent fate is unknown. By this time, only four (all males) of the birds Whitman returned to Whittaker were alive, and these died between November 1908 and February 1909.\nThe Cincinnati Zoo, one of the oldest zoos in the United States, kept passenger pigeons from its beginning in 1875. The zoo kept more than twenty individuals in a cage. Passenger pigeons do not appear to have been kept at the zoo due to their rarity, but to enable guests to have a closer look at a native species. Recognizing the decline of the wild populations, Whitman and the Cincinnati Zoo consistently strove to breed the surviving birds, including attempts at making a rock dove foster passenger pigeon eggs. In 1902, Whitman gave a female passenger pigeon to the zoo; this was possibly the individual later known as Martha, which would become the last living member of the species. Other sources argue that Martha was hatched at the Cincinnati Zoo, lived there for 25 years, and was the descendant of three pairs of passenger pigeons purchased by the zoo in 1877. It is thought this individual was named Martha because her last cage mate was named George, thereby honoring George Washington and his wife Martha, though it has also been claimed she was named after the mother of a zookeeper's friends.\nIn 1909, Martha and her two male companions at the Cincinnati Zoo became the only known surviving passenger pigeons. One of these males died around April that year, followed by George, the remaining male, on July 10, 1910. It is unknown whether the remains of George were preserved. Martha soon became a celebrity due to her status as an endling, and offers of a $1,000 reward () for finding a mate for her brought even more visitors to see her. During her last four years in solitude (her cage was ), Martha became steadily slower and more immobile; visitors would throw sand at her to make her move, and her cage was roped off in response. Martha died of old age on September 1, 1914, and was found lifeless on the floor of her cage. It was claimed that she died at 1\u00a0p.m., but other sources suggest she died some hours later. Depending on the source, Martha was between 17 and 29 years old at the time of her death, although 29 is the generally accepted figure. At the time, it was suggested that Martha might have died from an apoplectic stroke, as she had suffered one a few weeks before dying. Her body was frozen into a block of ice and sent to the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, where it was skinned, dissected, photographed, and mounted. As she was molting when she died, she proved difficult to stuff, and previously shed feathers were added to the skin. Martha was on display for many years, but after a period in the museum vaults, she was put back on display at the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History in 2015. A memorial statue of Martha stands on the grounds of the Cincinnati Zoo, in front of the \"Passenger Pigeon Memorial Hut\", formerly the aviary wherein Martha lived, now a National Historic Landmark. Incidentally, the last specimen of the extinct Carolina parakeet, named \"Incus,\" died in Martha's cage in 1918; the stuffed remains of that bird are exhibited in the \"Memorial Hut\".\nExtinction causes.\nThe main reasons for the extinction of the passenger pigeon were the massive scale of hunting, the rapid loss of habitat, and the extremely social lifestyle of the bird, which made it highly vulnerable to the former factors. Deforestation was driven by the need to free land for agriculture and expanding towns, but also due to the demand for lumber and fuel. About 728,000\u00a0km2 (180 million acres) were cleared for farming between 1850 and 1910. Though there are still large woodland areas in eastern North America, which support a variety of wildlife, it was not enough to support the vast number of passenger pigeons needed to sustain the population. In contrast, very small populations of nearly extinct birds, such as the k\u0101k\u0101p\u014d (\"Strigops habroptilus\") and the takah\u0113 (\"Porphyrio hochstetteri\"), have been enough to keep those species extant to the present. The combined effects of intense hunting and deforestation has been referred to as a \"Blitzkrieg\" against the passenger pigeon, and it has been labeled one of the greatest and most senseless human-induced extinctions in history. As the flocks dwindled in size, the passenger pigeon population decreased below the threshold necessary to propagate the species, an example of the Allee effect.\nThe 2014 genetic study that found natural fluctuations in population numbers prior to human arrival also concluded that the species routinely recovered from lows in the population, and suggested that one of these lows may have coincided with the intensified hunting by humans in the 1800s, a combination which would have led to the rapid extinction of the species. A similar scenario may also explain the rapid extinction of the Rocky Mountain locust (\"Melanoplus spretus\") during the same period. It has also been suggested that after the population was thinned out, it would be harder for few or solitary birds to locate suitable feeding areas. In addition to the birds killed or driven away by hunting during breeding seasons, many nestlings were also orphaned before being able to fend for themselves. Other, less convincing contributing factors have been suggested at times, including mass drownings, Newcastle disease, and migrations to areas outside their original range.\nThe extinction of the passenger pigeon aroused public interest in the conservation movement, and resulted in new laws and practices which prevented many other species from becoming extinct. The rapid decline of the passenger pigeon has influenced later assessment methods of the extinction risk of endangered animal populations. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has used the passenger pigeon as an example in cases where a species was declared \"at risk\" for extinction even though population numbers are high.\nNaturalist Aldo Leopold paid tribute to the vanished species in a monument dedication held by the Wisconsin Society for Ornithology at Wyalusing State Park, Wisconsin, which had been one of the species' social roost sites. Speaking on May 11, 1947, Leopold remarked:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nPotential resurrection of the species.\nToday, at least 1,532 passenger pigeon skins (along with 16 skeletons) still exist, spread across many institutions all over the world. It has been suggested that the passenger pigeon should be revived when available technology allows it (a concept which has been termed \"de-extinction\"), using genetic material from such specimens. In 2003, the Pyrenean ibex (\"Capra pyrenaica pyrenaica\", a subspecies of the Iberian ibex) was the first extinct animal to be cloned back to life; the clone lived for only seven minutes before dying of lung defects. A hindrance to cloning the passenger pigeon is the fact that the DNA of museum specimens has been contaminated and fragmented, due to exposure to heat and oxygen. American geneticist George M. Church has proposed that the passenger pigeon genome can be reconstructed by piecing together DNA fragments from different specimens. The next step would be to splice these genes into the stem cells of rock pigeons (or band-tailed pigeons), which would then be transformed into egg and sperm cells, and placed into the eggs of rock pigeons, resulting in rock pigeons bearing passenger pigeon sperm and eggs. The offspring of these would have passenger pigeon traits, and would be further bred to favor unique features of the extinct species. The American non-profit organization Revive &amp; Restore is currently pursuing the idea.\nThe general idea of re-creating extinct species has been criticized, since the large funds needed could be spent on conserving currently threatened species and habitats, and because conservation efforts might be viewed as less urgent. In the case of the passenger pigeon, since it was very social, it is unlikely that enough birds could be created for revival to be successful, and it is unclear whether there is enough appropriate habitat left for its reintroduction. Furthermore, the parent pigeons that would raise the cloned passenger pigeons would belong to a different species, with a different way of rearing young.\nBibliography.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The word is derived from the Latin name pal\u0101tium, for Palatine Hill in Rome which housed the Imperial residences.\nMost European languages have a version of the term (\"palats\", \"palais\", \"palazzo\", \"palacio\", etc.) and many use it to describe a broader range of buildings than English. In many parts of Europe, the equivalent term is also applied to large private houses in cities, especially of the aristocracy. It is also used for some large official buildings that have never had a residential function; for example in French-speaking countries \"Palais de Justice\" is the usual name of important courthouses. Many historic palaces such as parliaments, museums, hotels, or office buildings are now put to other uses. The word is also sometimes used to describe an elaborate building used for public entertainment or exhibitions such as a movie palace.\nA palace is typically distinguished from a castle in that the latter is fortified or has the style of a fortification, whereas a palace does not.\nEtymology.\nThe word \"palace\" comes from Old French \"palais\" (imperial residence), from Latin \"Pal\u0101tium\", the name of one of the seven hills of Rome. The original \"palaces\" on the Palatine Hill were the seat of the imperial power. At the same time, the \"capitol\" on the Capitoline Hill was the religious nucleus of Rome. Long after the city grew to the seven hills, the Palatine remained a desirable residential area. Roman emperor Caesar Augustus lived there in a purposely modest house only set apart from his neighbours by the two laurel trees planted to flank the front door as a sign of triumph granted by the Senate. His descendants, especially Nero with his \"Domus Aurea\" (the Golden House), enlarged the building and its grounds over and over until it took up the hilltop. The word \"Pal\u0101tium\" came to mean the residence of the emperor rather than the neighbourhood on top of the hill.\n\"Palace\", meaning \"government\", can be recognized in a remark of Paul the Deacon, writing c.\u2009790 AD and describing events of the 660s: \"When Grimuald set out for Beneventum, he entrusted his palace to Lupus\" (\"Historia Langobardorum\", V.xvii). At the same time, Charlemagne was consciously reviving the Roman expression in his \"palace\" at Aachen, of which only his chapel remains. In the 9th century, the \"palace\" indicated the government's housing too, and Charlemagne constantly traveled, building fourteen. In the early Middle Ages, the \"palas\" was usually that part of an imperial palace (or \"Kaiserpfalz\") that housed the Great Hall, where affairs of state were conducted; continued to be used as the seat of government in some German cities. In the Holy Roman Empire, the powerful independent Electors came to be housed in palaces (\"Pal\u00e4ste\"). This has been used as evidence that power was widely distributed in the Empire; as in more centralized monarchies, only the monarch's residence would be a \"palace\".\nIn modern times, archaeologists and historians have applied the term to large structures that housed combined rulers, courts, and bureaucracy in \"palace cultures\". In informal usage, the term \"palace\" can be extended to a grand residence.\nAncient palaces.\nThe Minoans were among the first in human history to construct what can truly be considered palaces. The earliest known example in the architectural sense\u2014a large, organized complex serving political, economic, religious, and administrative functions\u2014is the Palace of Knossos on the island of Crete, built by the Minoan civilization around 2000 BC, nearly 4,000 years ago.\nEarly ancient palaces include the Assyrian palaces at Nimrud and Nineveh and the Persian palaces at Persepolis and Susa. The Minoans built complexes referred to in modern times as Minoan palaces, though scholars now generally do not think they functioned as royal residences (or that there was royalty for them to house).\nThe best examples of the Bronze Age Greece palace are seen in the excavations at Mycenae, Tiryns and Pylos. The fact that these were administrative centers is shown by the records found there. They were ranged around a group of courtyards, each opening upon several rooms of different dimensions, such as storerooms and workshops, as well as reception halls and living quarters, each opening upon several rooms of different dimensions, such as storerooms, workshops, and reception halls. The heart of the palace was the megaron. This was the throne room, laid around a circular hearth surrounded by four columns, the throne generally found on the right-hand side upon entering the room. The staircases in the palace of Pylos indicate palaces had two stories. Located on the top floor were the private quarters of the royal family and some storerooms. These palaces have yielded a wealth of artifacts and fragmentary frescoes.\nThe Palace of Domitian in Rome is the overall name given to the complex of palaces that were the primary residence in Rome of the Roman emperors from the late 1st century to the 5th. Some sculptures and decorative elements have been excavated. The Domus Aurea was a different palace, begun by Nero, where excavations from the Renaissance onwards have discovered remarkably well-preserved paintings in levels now below ground.\nDiocletian's Palace in Split, Croatia was ready for occupation in 305 AD and is much the most significant ancient survival, having been turned in the Middle Ages into a fortified town; it still houses many people and businesses.\nPalaces in East Asia, such as the imperial palaces of Japan, Korea, Vietnam, Thailand, and Indonesia, and large wooden structures in China's Forbidden City, consist of many low pavilions surrounded by vast, walled gardens in contrast to the single building palaces of Medieval Western Europe. Palaces were also built by post-classical African kingdoms such as the Ashanti Empire. Before its destruction during the Third Anglo-Ashanti War, the Ashanti royal palace at Kumasi, Ghana was described by English explorers Thomas Edward Bowdich and Winwood Reade as \"an immense building of a variety of oblong courts and regular squares.\"\nMedieval palaces.\nEuropean palaces belonging to rulers were often large and grand, however, very few have survived to represent anything like their original medieval condition; many having been abandoned, burned down, demolished, or rebuilt. The Palais des Papes in Avignon, France, is probably the best prominent example, essentially a creation of 1252 to 1379, and little has changed since 1433, which marked the end of the Avignon Papacy and subsequent schisms.\nVery little of the medieval Louvre Palace, one of the most magnificent, has survived above ground. Similar fates befell the main palaces of the Byzantine Empire in Constantinople: the Great Palace of Constantinople, Boukoleon Palace, and Palace of Blachernae. The Palace of the Porphyrogenitus, a part of the Palace of Blachernae, has significant remains and now houses a museum.\nAmericas.\nArgentina.\nAll major cities in Argentina have prominent palaces due to the great economic growth the country went through in the late 19th century and early 20th century. In that time Argentina was one of the largest exporters of grain, meat, wool and leather in the world. The country's new elite was eager to show their wealth to the world, which is the reason they often hired european architects and in many cases, even imported all the construction materials needed. Some of those palaces are still residential and many others have become hotels, museums and embassies. Some examples of this are Palacio Duhau, , Palacio Bosch, Palacio Paz and Palacio San Mart\u00edn.\nAlso, President Domingo Faustino Sarmiento claimed that Argentine schools should be palaces because that would encourage children and teenagers to go to school. For that reason many public schools are opulent and are called \"escuelas palacio\". Some examples of this are Colegio Nacional de Buenos Aires, Colegio Nacional Rafael Hern\u00e1ndez, Escuela Superior de Comercio Carlos Pellegrini, and .\nOther examples of government buildings in Argentina that are considered palaces are Palacio Pizzurno, Correo Central, Palacio de Aguas Corrientes and Palacio de Justicia de la Naci\u00f3n.\nBrazil.\nThe Brazilian new capital, Bras\u00edlia, hosts modern palaces, most designed by the city's architect Oscar Niemeyer. The Alvorada Palace is the official residence of Brazil's president. The Planalto Palace is the official workplace. The Jaburu Palace is the official residence of Brazil's vice-president. Also Rio de Janeiro, the former capital of the Portuguese Empire and the Empire of Brazil, houses numerous royal and imperial palaces as the Imperial Palace of S\u00e3o Crist\u00f3v\u00e3o, former official residence of the Brazil's emperors, the Pa\u00e7o Imperial, its official workplace and the Guanabara Palace, former residence of Isabel, Princess Imperial of Brazil besides palaces of the nobility and aristocracy. The city of Petropolis, in the state of Rio de Janeiro, is mainly known for its palaces of the imperial period, such as the Petr\u00f3polis Palace and the Gr\u00e3o-Par\u00e1 Palace.\nCanada.\nIn Canada, Government House is a title given to the official residences of the Canadian monarchy and various viceroys (the governors general and the lieutenant governors). Though not universal, in most cases, the title is also the building's sole name; for example, the sovereign's and governor general's principal residence in Ottawa is known as Government House only in formal contexts, being more generally referred to as Rideau Hall. Government House is an inherited custom from the British Empire, where there were and are many government houses.\nRideau Hall is, since 1867, the official residence in Ottawa of both the Canadian monarch and his or her representative, the governor general of Canada, and has been described as \"Canada's house\". It stands in Canada's capital on a estate at 1 Sussex Drive, with the main building consisting of approximately 175 rooms across , and 27 outbuildings around the grounds. While the equivalent structure in many countries has a prominent, central place in the national capital, Rideau Hall's site is relatively unobtrusive within Ottawa, giving it more of the character of a private home.\nAlong with Rideau Hall, the Citadelle of Quebec, also known as La Citadelle, is an active military installation and official residence of the Canadian monarch and the governor general. It is located atop Cap Diamant, adjoining the Plains of Abraham in Quebec City, Quebec. The citadel is the oldest military building in Canada and forms part of the fortifications of Quebec City, which is one of only two cities in North America still surrounded by fortifications. The fortress is located within the historic district of Old Qu\u00e9bec, designated a World Heritage Site in 1985.\nIn addition to the federal residences, most provinces maintain a place for the Canadian monarch and their provincial viceroys and lieutenant governors. There is no government house for the lieutenant governors of Ontario (repurposed in 1937 and demolished in 1961), Quebec (destroyed by fire in 1966), or Alberta (closed in 1938 and repurchased and repurposed in 1964).\nMexico.\nThe capital of Mexico, Mexico City, is traditionally nicknamed the \"City of Palaces\"; a nickname usually attributed to Alexander von Humboldt after he visited the city in the late 18th century and early 19th century, but initially coined by Charles Latrobe, an English traveler who visited Mexico City in 1834 and \"got the feeling of living a dream\".\nIn Central Mexico, the Aztec emperors built many palaces in the capital of their empire, Tenochtitlan (modern-day Mexico City), some of which may still be seen. On observing the great city Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s wrote, \"There are, in all districts of this great city, many temples or palaces... They are all magnificent buildings. Amongst these temples is one, the principal one, whose great size and magnificence no human tongue could describe... All around this wall are exquisite quarters with huge rooms and corridors. There are as many as forty towers, all of which are so high that in the case of the largest, there are fifty steps leading up to the main part of it, and the most important of these towers is higher than that of the cathedral of Seville...\"\nIn the Yucatan, a well-preserved Mayan palace with a unique four-storey observation tower stands at the Palenque site, from where Pakal reigned over the city-state.\nThe National Palace, or \"Palacio Nacional\", located in Mexico City's main square, the Plaza de la Constituci\u00f3n (El Z\u00f3calo), first built in 1563, is in the heart of the Mexican capital. In 1821, the palace was given its current name, and the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of government were housed in the palace; the latter two branches would eventually reside elsewhere. During the Second Mexican Empire, its name was changed, for a time, to the Imperial Palace. The National Palace continues to be the official seat of the executive authority, though it is no longer the president's official residence.\nAlso in Mexico City is the \"Castillo de Chapultepec\", or Chapultepec Castle, located in the middle of Chapultepec Park, which currently houses the Mexican National Museum of History. It is the only castle, or palace, in North America that was occupied by sovereigns \u2013 Emperor Maximilian I of Mexico, a member of the House of Habsburg and his consort, Empress Carlota of Mexico, daughter of Leopold I of Belgium. The palace features many \"objets d'art\" ranging from gifts of Napoleon III to paintings by Franz Xaver Winterhalter and Mexican painter Santiago Rebull.\nUnited States.\nPalaces in the United States include the White House, the official residence of the president, and the official residences of many governors and Roman Catholic bishops. Some palaces of former heads of state or their representatives, such as English and Spanish royal governors and the Hawaiian royal family, still exist.\nExamples include: \u02bbIolani Palace and H\u0101naiakamalama, the former homes of the Hawaiian monarchs in Honolulu; Hulihee Palace in Kailua-Kona, Hawaii; The Governor's Palace in Williamsburg, a modern reconstruction of the official residence of the royal governors of the Colony of Virginia; Tryon Palace in New Bern, a modern reconstruction of the historical colonial governors' palace of the Province of North Carolina; and the Palace of the Governors in Santa Fe, New Mexico as well as the Spanish Governor's Palace in San Antonio, Texas, which were residences of both Spanish and Mexican governors.\nThere are many private buildings or mansions in the United States, which, though not called \"palaces\", have the grandeur typical of a palace, and have been used as residences. Hearst Castle and the Biltmore Estate are examples.\nUruguay.\nThe Palacio Legislativo (Legislative Palace) is the house of the Uruguayan Parliament.\nVenezuela.\nThe Palacio de Miraflores is the setting for the offices of the president of the country.\nAfrica.\nEthiopia.\nLocated in Addis Ababa, the Menelik Palace is a palatial compound that is currently serving as the residence of the prime minister of Ethiopia. The compound, while containing palaces and residences also contains a few churches, tombs and monasteries. Previously, it served as the seat of the emperors of Ethiopia. After a 2018 renovation, the compound opened to the public in 2019 as a part of Unity Park.\nNigeria.\nThe Palace of the Olowo, ruler of the Yoruba Owo clan of Nigeria, is acknowledged to be the largest palace in all of Africa. It consists of more than 100 courtyards, each with a unique traditional usage.\nIn the Kano State of Nigeria, the Gidan Rumfa acts as the seat of the Emir of Kano since the late 15th century when it was constructed.\nIn Benin City, the capital of the Edo State, lies the current Royal Palace of the Oba of Benin. It currently houses the Oba of Benin, who is the traditional ruler of the Edo people, alongside some other royals. The current palace is a reconstruction by Eweka II after the original was destroyed in 1897 by the British.\nRwanda.\nRwanda is host to three palaces, although one of them is currently repurposed. In Nyanza, the former royal capital of the Kingdom of Rwanda, are two existing palaces. The first, the traditional King's Palace, is constructed in the vernacular style and housed the traditional ruler of Rwanda, the Mwami. A second palace for the king exists in Nyanza, although it is constructed in the Art Deco style as opposed to the local construction style. A third palace, the Rwesero Palace, was originally constructed for Mutara III, but he died before its completion, and the building was converted into the Rwesero Art Museum.\nUganda.\nThe Kabakas Palace belonged to the Kingdom of Buganda and is a known landmark of the present capital Kampala.\nAsia.\nAfghanistan.\nAfghanistan's capital Kabul is well known for its sheer number of palaces. Many had been built in the 19th century but perhaps the most famous is the Darul Aman Palace. Many palaces were damaged by the civil war, including Darul Aman, but others have survived or have been rebuilt.\nArmenia.\nArmenia has many palaces from its various historical periods. The Erebuni fortress in Yerevan has a grand royal palace constructed in 782 B.C. by King Argisthi. The palace at Erebuni is one of the earliest examples of an Urartian palace.\nDuring the Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity), many palaces were constructed for the successive kings. Ruins of a royal palace can be found in the early Armenian capital of Yervandashat, which was built to serve as the seat of Orontid Armenian Kings by Orontes IV. During the period of the Artaxiad dynasty of Armenia, emperor king Tigranes the great constructed a grand persianate palace in the newly built city of Tigranocerta. The purpose of the Armenian Temple of Garni is still up for debate, however, certain scholars attest that following the Christianization of Armenia in the 4th century BC, the temple was converted into a summer palace for Khosrovidukht (sister of Tiridates III of Armenia) by the Arsacid dynasty of Armenia.\nAfter the fall of the Arsacids, Armenia was ruled by a succession of aristocratic families who held the title \"Nakharar\". One of these Nakharar princes, Grigor Mamikonian, built a palace in the citadel of Aruch near the Aruchavank cathedral; some walls of this palace and a unique Armenian throne made of tufa still survive today.\nThe medieval capital of the Bagratid kingdom of Armenia, Ani, also hosted many palaces. The first palace of Ani, constructed by the princely Armenian Kamsarakan dynasty in the seventh century, served as the most important structure of the city. Located in the main citadel, the Kamsarakan palace was used by the successive Bagratid kingdom as their headquarters. In addition, Ani hosted several other palaces such as the Merchant's(Tigran Honents) Palace, one of the best surviving examples of secular Armenian architecture of that time, the Seljuk palace, and the Manuchir Mosque, which is said by some historians to have been a residence of Bagratid kings before being converted to a mosque.\nAfter the Bagratid state was conquered by the Byzantines and then the Seljuks, Armenia was once again liberated by the royal Zakarian family under Georgian Queen Tamar. This period of Zakarid Armenia brought forth many palaces as well, the most notable of which being Amberd Fortress and the 12th-century palace in Dashtadem Fortress. The Zakarids became vassals of the Mongols, however, following their collapse, a succession of nomadic Turkic empires came to rule the region.\nDuring the various periods of Ottoman and Iranian occupation following the Timurid Empire, Armenia was governed by several local principalities known as Melikdoms. Each Melik had their own princely palace. The most notable of which is the Palace of the Dizak Melikdom constructed by Melik Yeganyan in Togh (1737). Other notable melik palaces are the Melik Ahnazar palace in Khnatsakh (16th century), the Melik Haykaz Palace in Melikashen (15th century), the Melik Kasu palace, the palace of the Melik-Barkhudaryans in Tegh (1783) and Halidzor Fortress (17th century), which served as a palace for the Melik Parsadanian family.\nAzerbaijan.\nAzerbaijan has a number of palaces which belong to different ages. For example, there are palaces from the BC era and from the 12th century, like the \"Goyalp\" Palace of Eldiguzids Empire Atabeg\u2014 located in Nakhchivan city and built in the 1130s.\nBaku Khans' Palace is a complex of several houses that belonged to members of ruling family of the Baku Khanate in the 17th century. The palace complex was in ruins but has now been reconstructed as of 2018. Official Administration of State Historical-Architectural Reserve Icheri Sheher has opened the complex as a palace-museum.\nThe Palace of Happiness (Azerbaijani: S\u0259ad\u0259t Saray\u0131), currently also called Palace of Marriage Registrations and previously called Mukhtarov Palace, is a historic building in the center of Baku, Azerbaijan, built in Neo-Gothic style in the early 19th century.\nShahbulag Castle Palace (Azerbaijani: \u015eahbulaq qalas\u0131 \"Spring of the Shah\") is an 18th-century fortress near Aghdam. After the death of Turkic ruler Nadir Shah, the territory that is today Azerbaijan split into several Caucasian khanates, one of which was the Karabakh Khanate founded by Panah Ali Khan. The first capital of the khanate was the Bayat Castle, built in 1748\nHaji Gayib's Palace is an ancient fortress construction near a coastal side of Icheri Sheher. It is located in the Baku quarter of Icheri Sheher, opposite the Maiden Tower. The history of the palace dates back to the 15th century. The Intake portal of the bathhouse is rectangular shaped\nThe Palace of Shaki Khans (Azerbaijani: \u015e\u0259ki xanlar\u0131n\u0131n saray\u0131) in Shaki, Azerbaijan, was a summer residence of Shaki Khans. It was built in 1797 by Muhammed Hasan Khan. Along with its pool and plane trees, the summer residence is the only remaining structure from the larger palatial complex inside the Sheki Khans' Fortress, which once included a winter palace, residences for the khan's family and servants' quarters. It features decorative tiles, fountains and several stained-glass windows. The exterior was decorated with dark blue, turquoise and ochre tiles in geometric patterns and the murals were coloured with tempera and were inspired by the works of Nizami Ganjavi.\nThese are located in various regions and capital of Azerbaijan \u2013 the palace of government:\nBrunei.\nIstana Nurul Iman is the world's largest residential palace and is the official residence of the sultan of Brunei, Hassanal Bolkiah, and the seat of the Brunei government. The palace is located on a leafy sprawl of hills on the banks of the Brunei River, a few kilometres south of Bandar Seri Begawan, Brunei's capital.\nBangladesh.\nMost of the palaces in Bangladesh were built by the Zamindars and Nawabs of British Bengal. Many magnificent palaces can be found across the country. Among the notable palaces are Ahsan Manzil (also known as Pink Palace), built by the Nawabs of Dhaka; Tajhat Palace of Rangpur; Natore Palace; Puthia Rajbari of Rajshahi; Rose Garden Palace of Old Dhaka; Baliati Palace of Manikganj; Shashi Lodge of Mymensingh; and Bangabhaban (Presidential Palace).\nChina.\nA famed example of Chinese palaces is the Forbidden City, the imperial palace of the Chinese Empire from the Ming dynasty (since the Yongle Emperor) to the end of the Qing dynasty. Located in Beijing, it is the largest palace complex currently in existence in the world. The palace complex exemplifies traditional Chinese palatial architecture. Another example is the Summer Palace located in the northern suburb of Beijing and the Mukden Palace in Shenyang. The Presidential Palace in Nanjing and Imperial Palace of Manchukuo in Changchun display European architectural influences.\nThe Weiyang Palace built during the Han dynasty was the largest palace complex ever built in the world, but it was destroyed during the Tang dynasty.\nChinese palaces are designed in regular square grids and arranged in a formal layout consisting of main buildings and a number of pavilions enclosed within walls. Unlike massive single-structured European palaces or castles, Chinese palaces are a multitude of complexes containing several larger and smaller structures with parks and courtyards.\nIndia.\nIndia is home to many palaces and vast empires. Its history is full of numerous dynasties that have ruled over various parts of the country. While most monuments of the ancient period have been destroyed or lie in ruins, some medieval buildings have been maintained or restored to good condition. Several medieval forts and palaces still stand all over India. These are examples of the achievements of the architects and engineers of that age. The palaces of India offer an insight into the life of the royalty of the country. While some royal palaces have been maintained as museums or hotels over the last decades, some are still homes for the members of the erstwhile royal families. These forts and palaces are the largest illustrations and legacy of the princely states of India. They feature floats of flowers in grand fountains, shimmering blue water of magnificent baths and private pools, doric pillars, ornamental brackets, decorative staircases, and light streaming in through large windows. India possesses some of the most fascinating forts and palaces, a true royal retreat. It is not just a romantic longing for a royal experience, but also the search for the truly authentic Indian experience that brings thousands of heritage lovers to India's palaces.\nRajasthan has many forts and palaces that are major tourist destinations in North India. (See List of palaces in Rajasthan.) The Rajputs (collective term for the rulers of the region) were known as brave soldiers who preferred to die than be taken prisoners. They were also great connoisseurs of art and brilliant builders. The most famous forts and palaces in Rajasthan are located in Chittor, Jodhpur, Jaipur, Udaipur, Saphieree, Amber and Nahargarh. Taj Hotels Resorts and Palaces manages some of the most iconic palaces of the region, Lake Palace, Udaipur; Umaid Bhawan Palace, Jodhpur; Fort Madhogarh, Jaipur and Rambagh Palace, Jaipur; and offer authentic royal retreats to the guests in all its grandeur, splendour and magnificence.\nKolkata is known as the City of Palaces within the Indian context, referring to the numerous grand residential buildings that dotted the city from the end of the 18th century onwards, as it grew to become one of the largest cities of the British Raj.\nKarnataka is famous for the Amba Vilas Palace (commonly known as Mysore Palace) in Mysuru / Mysore, which was the palace of the Wodeyar kings. It was said to have been built of wood until it had to be rebuilt after a fire that burned down the entire palace complex.\nIndonesia.\nIn Indonesia, palaces are known as \"istana\" (Malay and Indonesian), or \"kraton\" (Javanese and Sundanese). In Bali the royal palace compound is called \"puri\". The palaces reflect the long history and diverse culture of the Indonesian archipelago.\nAlthough Indonesia is now a republic, some of its parts and provinces still retain and preserve their traditional royal heritage, for example the Sultanate of Yogyakarta, Surakarta, Mangkunegaran princedom, Kasepuhan palace in Cirebon, as well as the Sultanate of Pontianak and Kutai in East Kalimantan. Remnants of palaces and royal houses still can be found in Banten, Medan, Ternate, Tidore, Bima, Bali and Sumenep. Most of whom are now Museums. The layout of traditional Balinese and Javanese \"kratons\" is similar to the Chinese concept of walled compounds of royal pavilions, squares and gardens. Most of these \"kratons\" took the form of wooden pavilions called \"pendopo\", while the \"istana\" of Sumatra usually consist of a single large structure. Typical Minangkabau vernacular architecture can be found in Pagaruyung Palace, West Sumatra. An example of Malay palace is Istana Maimun in Medan and the Siak Sri Indrapura Palace in Siak.\nDuring the VOC and colonial era of the Dutch East Indies, the colonial government built several European stately palaces as the residence of the governor-general. Most of these European palaces have now become the state palace of the Republic of Indonesia. Indonesian state palaces are the neoclassic Merdeka Palace and Bogor Palace.\nIran.\nThe Niavar\u0101n Palace Complex is a historical complex situated in the northern part of Tehran, Iran. It consists of several buildings and a museum. The Sahebqraniyeh Palace, from the time of Naser al-Din Shah of the Qajar dynasty, is also inside this complex. The main Niavaran Palace, completed in 1968, was the primary residence of the last shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, and the imperial family, until the Iranian Revolution. The main palace was designed by the Iranian architect Mohsen Foroughi.\nIsrael/Palestine.\nThe pre-Israelite Canaanite site of Tel Kabri, destroyed in c. 1600 BCE, was built around a palace core. A palace culture of ancient Israel and Judah can be inferred from the Hebrew Bible, and the Iron Age Omride palace at Samaria has been excavated by archaeologists; no palace of David has been securely identified, and the historicity of Solomon is yet to be proven.\nFrom the Late Hellenistic or Hasmonean and the Early Roman or Herodian period, there are many historical palaces like the two at Masada. Palaces of Herod the Great and his line of client kings and rulers have been further identified at several sites, including Herod's royal palace at Jerusalem, the Hasmonean and Herodian winter palaces at Jericho, and Herod's fortified palace and second administrative seat at Herodium in the Judean desert. Herod's palace at Caesarea Maritima preserved its palatial function as the official residence of the Roman procurators and governors of In Judaea.\nThere are other much later palaces in the Old City of Jerusalem, such as the Mamluk Lady Tunshuk Palace.\nThere are a number of magnificent 19th-century buildings that are not considered \"palaces\", but have the grandeur of a typical palace, such as the Yehudayoff-Hefetz residence, and the Sergei Courtyard in Jerusalem.\nJapan.\nOf the palaces in Japan, many are located in Tokyo, such as the Tokyo Imperial Palace, which houses Japan's royal family. The imperial palace was built on the site of Edo Castle. Other Japanese palaces are located in Kyoto, the former capital of Japan. Most Japanese palaces are built in a \"castle\" style formation, as a large pagoda. This helps reinforce the palace from earthquakes.\nKorea.\nKorea has used many palaces since ancient times, although many have been destroyed. Palaces were built within, but not limited to Seoul, Kaeseong, Pyeongyang, Gyeongju, and Buyeo, as well as in various cities located outside of modern Korea. Today, only Joseon dynasty palaces are still intact, even then, very downsized due to years of colonialism, war, and neglect. The most emblematic of these surviving palaces is the Gyeongbokgung, the primary palace of the Joseon Dynasty. Other examples include the Changdeokgung, Changgyeonggung, Deoksugung, and Gyeonghuigung. All of these are from the Joseon dynasty and survive to this day, though many had to be reconstructed during the recent decades following their destruction during the colonial period. Other famous examples include the Manwoldae, the palace of the Goryeo dynasty located in Kaeseong, the Banwolseong, the palace of Silla located in Gyeongju, and Anhak Palace, the palace of Goguryeo located in Pyeongyang.\nLebanon.\nPalaces have existed in Lebanon since the time of the Phoenicians. Almost all of the palaces of ancient Phoenicia have been destroyed.\nDuring the Renaissance palaces were built in Lebanon, especially in the Chouf region of Mount Lebanon. Lebanese palaces are very diverse architecturally, being influenced by Arabs, Italians, French, Persians, Turkish and East Asians. This is seen in the Beiteddine Palace, which is a mixture of traditional Lebanese, Italian, Arabic and Persian architecture.\nToday in Lebanon there are at least ten buildings that can be classified as palaces, including the Beiteddine Palace, Grand Serail (one of the largest in the world), Baabda Palace, Sursock Museum, Seraglio of Baabda and Fakhreddine Palace.\nMalaysia.\nMalaysia, a constituent of nine states, is ruled by hereditary sultans. Every five years, one sultan is elected as Yang di-Pertuan Agong (Supreme King), the head of state of Malaysia. The Yang di-Pertuan Agong has a palace, referred to as an \"istana\". Each of the other sultans has their own \"istana\", located in their state. Throughout the country they are sometimes called \"Istana Hinggap\".\nThe Yang di-Pertuan Agong's official residences are the Istana Negara, Jalan Duta; the Royal Museum; and Istana Melawati, a palace and retreat, located in Putrajaya. Some of the other official palaces are the Istana Besar, Istana Anak Bukit, Istana Pekan, Istana Maziah, Istana Alam Shah, Istana Balai Besar, Istana Besar Seri Menanti, Istana Iskandariah and Istana Arau. Several appointed governors, or Yang di-Pertua Negeri, are also assigned to have their official seat and residence such as The Astana, Istana Negeri Sabah and Seri Mutiara.\nNepal.\nSingha Durbar (literally, \"Lion Palace\") in Kathmandu is the official seat of government of Nepal.\nNarayanhiti Palace Museum was a residence and principal workplace of the reigning monarch of the Kingdom of Nepal. It was built by King Mahendra in 1961 under the design of Californian architect Benjamin Polk. After the 2006 revolution that overthrew the monarchy, this royal palace was turned into a public museum.\nOlder palaces include the Durbar Squares, which are enlisted as UNESCO World Heritage Sites. They are located in Kathmandu Valley in districts of Kathmandu, Bhaktapur and Lalitpur. In Kathmandu is Kathmandu Durbar Square, Bhaktapur Durbar Square in Bhaktapur, Patan Durbar Square in Lalitpur.\nKathmandu Durbar Square (Basantapur Darbar Kshetra) in front of the old royal palace of the former Kathmandu Kingdom is one of three durbar (royal palace) squares in the Kathmandu Valley in Nepal, all of which are UNESCO World Heritage Sites.\nSeveral buildings in the Square collapsed due to a major earthquake on 25 April 2015. Durbar Square was surrounded with spectacular architecture and vividly showcases the skills of the Newar artists and craftsmen over several centuries. The Royal Palace was originally at Dattaraya square and was later moved to Durbar square.\nThe Kathmandu Durbar Square held the palaces of the Malla and Shah kings who ruled over the city. Along with these palaces, the square surrounds quadrangles, revealing courtyards and temples. It is known as Hanuman Dhoka Durbar Square, a name derived from a statue of Hanuman, the monkey devotee of Lord Ram, at the entrance of the palace.\nBhaktapur Durbar Square is the plaza in front of the royal palace of the old Bhaktapur Kingdom. It is also a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\nThe Bhaktapur Durbar Square is located in the current town of Bhaktapur, also known as Bhadgaon, which lies 13\u00a0km east of Kathmandu. While the complex consists of at least four distinct squares (Durbar Square, Taumadhi Square, Dattatreya Square and Pottery Square), the whole area is informally known as the Bhakapur Durbar Square and is a highly visited site in the Kathmandu Valley. This palace consists of 55 windows so it is also known as '55 Windowed Palace'.\nPatan Durbar Square is situated at the centre of the city of Lalitpur in Nepal. It is also one of the three durbar squares in the Kathmandu Valley, all of which are UNESCO World Heritage Sites. One of its attraction is the ancient royal palace where the Malla kings of Lalitpur resided.\nThe Durbar Square is a marvel of Newa architecture. The floor of the square is tiled with red bricks. There are many temples and idols in the area. The main temples are aligned opposite of the western face of the palace. The entrance of the temples faces east, towards the palace. There is also a bell situated in the alignment beside the main temples. The Square also holds old Newari residential houses. There are various other temples and structures in and around Patan Durbar Square built by the Newa People.\nPhilippines.\nIn pre-Hispanic Philippines, Filipinos built large wooden residences for the ancient nobility and royalty (such as lakans, wangs, rajahs and datus) called \"torogan\" or \"bahay lakan\" (\"king's house\"). The windows of the \"torogan\" are slits and richly framed in wood panels with \"okir\" designs located in front of the house. The communal kitchen is half a meter lower than the main house and is both used for cooking and eating. The distinct high gable roof of the \"torogan\", thin at the apex and gracefully flaring out to the eaves, sits on a huge structures enclosed by slabs of timber and lifted more than two meters above the ground by a huge trunk of a tree that was set on a rock. The end floor beams lengthen as panolongs the seemed to lift up the whole house. The torogan is suffused with decorations. There were diongal at the apex of the roof, also an intricately carved tinai a walai, \"okir\" designs in the floor, on windows and on panolongs.\nThe people in the southern part of Philippines built the same wooden palaces such as the \"langgal\" of the Tausug. In the Sultanate of Sulu, a palace was built for the sultans and was named Astana Darul Jambangan (white adobe), which was destroyed by a typhoon in 1912. A replica of the royal palace has been rebuilt as an attraction in Mt. Bayug Eco-Cultural Park in the town of Talipao, Sulu.\nDuring the Spanish era, the government of the Spanish East Indies built a succession of palaces in and around Manila for high colonial officials and religious authorities. The most famous of these is the 18th-century Malaca\u00f1ang Palace, which originally housed Spanish and American governors-general and, since the Commonwealth, the president of the Philippines.\nFormer president and strongman Ferdinand Marcos had Coconut Palace constructed in 1978 to showcase the country's varied uses for the coconut. It serves as the home and office of the vice-president. In 2004, President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo converted the former \"Aduana\" (customs house) in Cebu City into a small palace, called Malaca\u00f1ang sa Sugbo.\nTurkey.\nThe enormous Topkap\u0131 Palace complex in Istanbul was begun in 1459, and with its many additions survived almost completely intact until it was turned into a museum in 1923. It was the centre of government as well as the residence of the Ottoman Caliphs. It combined aspects of the typical Asian form of a group of pavilions set in a large walled garden (part is now G\u00fclhane Park) with the European style of a single massive building with courtyards. Visitors passed through a series of courtyards, originally lined with hundreds of soldiers along the arcades, with only the most important or favoured reaching the Fourth Courtyard and the imperial residential quarters.\nBy the 19th century Topkap\u0131 was largely abandoned as a residence in favour of the new Dolmabah\u00e7e Palace and Y\u0131ld\u0131z Palace, as well as smaller Ottoman palaces in Istanbul, some summer retreats and the like. These were in essentially European architectural styles.\nEurope.\nBelgium.\nThe city of Bruges:\nThe Gruuthusemuseum is a museum of applied arts in Bruges, located in the late medieval Gruuthuse, the Palace of Louis de Gruuthuse. The collection ranges from the 15th to the 19th century.\nPresumably in the 13th century, a rich family from Bruges received the monopoly to levy taxes on gruit, and built storage for it. The building was changed in the early fifteenth century by Jan IV van der Aa to a luxury house for his family, which subsequently changed its name to \"Van Gruuthuse\" (\"From the Gruit house\"). His son Louis de Gruuthuse added a second wing to the house, and in 1472 a \"chapel\". This is in a bridge which connects the house to the adjacent Church of Our Lady, Bruges, so that members of the household could see the high altar from wide windows in the room. However the building was very heavily restored in the 19th century.\nThe city of Mechelen houses several palaces:\n\"Hof van Kamerijk\" or \"Palace of Margaret of York\", 15th-century building. Also called \"Keizershof\" (English; literally \"Emperor's Court\") because several royal children resided here and received education at this court, including Charles V (Holy Roman Emperor and Archduke of Austria, King of Spain and Duke of Burgundy)\n\"Hof van Savoye\" or \"Palace of Margaret of Austria\", early 16th-century building and one of the first Renaissance buildings in northern Europe.\nThe \"Hof van Busleyden\", early 16th-century Renaissance palace of Hieronymus van Busleyden; The \"Archbishop 's palace\", 18th-century building and the official seat of the Archbishop of the Roman Catholic province Belgium; The \"Hof van Palermo\", 15th-century palace of Jan I Carondelet; The \"Hof van Hoogstraten\", 16th-century palace of Antoon I van Lalaing; The \"Hof van Nassau\", 15th-century building which served as temporary court of Margaret of York when she arrived in Mechelen after her marriage with Charles the Bold; The \"Hof van Cortenbach\", 16th-century building; The \"Hof van Coloma\", 18th-century palace of Jean Ernest Coloma, Baron of St-Pieters Leeuw and member of the Coloma family\nThe city of Brussels has also several remaining and notable palaces: \"The Royal Palace of Brussels\", the official palace of the King and Queen of the Belgians, The Egmont palace, The Palace of Prince Charles Alexander Emanuel of Lorraine and Hotel Errera. The Palace of Coudenberg, the main Renaissance palace and seat of government power, burnt down completely in 1731.\nFrance.\nIn France there has been a clear distinction between a ch\u00e2teau and a \"palais\". The palace has always been urban, like the \"Palais de la Cit\u00e9\" in Paris, which was the royal palace of France and is now the supreme court of justice of France, or the palace of the Popes at Avignon.\nThe ch\u00e2teau, by contrast, has always been in rural settings, supported by its demesne, even when it was no longer actually fortified. Speakers of English think of the \"Palace of Versailles\" because it was the residence of the king of France, and the king was the source of power, though the building has always remained the \"Ch\u00e2teau de Versailles\" for the French, and the seat of government under the \"Ancien R\u00e9gime\" remained the Palais du Louvre. The Louvre had begun as a fortified \"Ch\u00e2teau du Louvre\" on the edge of Paris, but as the seat of government and shorn of its fortified architecture and then completely surrounded by the city, it developed into the \"Palais du Louvre\".\nThe \"h\u00f4tel particulier\" remains the term for an urban residence sited \"entre cour et jardin\", behind a forecourt and opening onto a garden; when fronting directly on streets, they are \"maisons\", \"houses\". Bishops always had a \"palais\" in the town of their diocese, an \"h\u00f4tel\" in other towns, though they might possess \"chateaux\".\nThe usage is essentially the same in Italy, Spain and Portugal, as well as the former Austrian Empire. In Vienna, Austria, all large mansions belonging to aristocratic or very wealthy families were traditionally called \"palais\", but this never applied to imperial palaces themselves which were called \"Burg\" within the city and \"Schloss\" when outside it. In Germany, the wider term was a relatively recent importation and was used rather more restrictively.\nGermany.\nThe German term for \"palace\" is \"Palast\", which is used especially for large palatial complexes and gardens. Large country houses are typically called \"schloss\" (\"chateaux\" or \"castle\" in English).\nGermany offers a variety of more than 25,000 castles and palaces and thousands of manor houses. The country is known for its fairy tale-like scenery palatial buildings, such as Sanssouci, Linderhof Palace, Herrenchiemsee, Schwetzingen, Nordkirchen and Schwerin Palace. Many of these buildings have a history of over 1000 years, ranging from fortifications to royal residences. Many German castles after the Middle Ages were mainly built as royal or ducal palaces rather than as a fortified building.\nHungary.\nIn Hungary distinction is made between urban and rural residencies. Only the urban residencies of the higher aristocracy were called \"palota\" (palace); rural stately homes were named \"kast\u00e9ly\" (mansion), or in case of smaller country houses, \"k\u00faria\". Noble landowner families, like the House of Esterh\u00e1zy, often had several mansions in the countryside and palaces in towns. The office of the president of the Republic of Hungary, S\u00e1ndor Palace, was the residence of the S\u00e1ndor family in the 19th century. Royal residencies were also called palaces, for example, the Early Renaissance summer palace of King Matthias Corvinus in Visegr\u00e1d or Buda Castle which was called \"Kir\u00e1lyi-palota\" (Royal Palace). In the second half of the 19th century, splendid new townhouses of the bourgeoisie on Andr\u00e1ssy \u00fat and elsewhere in Budapest were named palaces. A typical example is the Art Nouveau Gresham Palace, which was built by an insurance company. Grand public buildings and even blocks of flats of higher standard were regularly called palaces (the contemporary term of the latter were \"b\u00e9rpalota\" meaning rent palace). For contemporary buildings the term is seldom used with the notable exemption of the Palace of Arts.\nIreland.\nIn Ireland, the term \"palace\" () is rarely used. The main royal residence in Ireland, Dublin Castle, was never called a palace, nor is Hillsborough Castle, the main royal residence of Northern Ireland.\nThe word \"palace\" is largely restricted to large official dwellings for Church of Ireland bishops:\nThere are also some Catholic bishops' palaces:\nItaly.\nIn Italy, any urban building built as a grand residence is a \"palazzo\"; these are often no larger than a Victorian townhouse. Being a nobleman was not necessary for one's house to be considered a \"palazzo\", as the hundreds of \"palazzi\" in Venice nearly all belonged to the patrician class of the city. In the Middle Ages these also functioned as warehouses and places of business, as well as homes. Each family's \"palazzo\" was a hive that contained all the family members, though it might not always show a grand architectural public front. In the 20th century, \"palazzo\" in Italian came to apply by extension to any large fine apartment building, as many old \"palazzi\" were converted to this use.\nBishops' townhouses were always \"palazzi\", and the seat of a localized regime would also be so called. Many former capitals display a Ducal Palace, the seat of the local duke or lord. In Florence (just as for other strong communal governments), the seat of government was known as Palazzo della Signoria. When the Medici were made Grand Dukes of Tuscany, however, the centre of power shifted to their new residence in Palazzo Pitti, and the old centre of power began to be referred to as the Palazzo Vecchio.\nShops on the ground floor and flats at the top of a modern \"palazzo\" are not at all incongruous: historically, the ground floors of even a great family's \"palazzo\" could be trade and domestic offices often open to servants, tradesmen, customers and the public, while the smartest and most prestigious floor (known as the \"piano nobile\") was kept for the family along with the upper floors and apartments, all of which were considered cleaner and safer than those on the ground floor. There were (and are) often separate, sometimes external, stairs to the humblest attic rooms and roofs used by the staff.\nThe most important royal \"palazzi\" in Italy are those in Caserta, Milan, Naples, Palermo, Turin, as well as the Quirinale Palace in Rome.\nMalta.\nUntil the sixteenth century, Malta was part of the Kingdom of Sicily, and the capital Mdina housed many palaces for the nobility, such as Palazzo Falson and Palazzo Santa Sofia. After the arrival of the Order of Saint John in 1530, the knights settled in Birgu, where part of Fort St Angelo was used as a palace for the Grand Master. The knights themselves lived in auberges, but these were more large houses rather than palaces.\nWhen the Order began to build a new capital Valletta in 1566, a new Grandmaster's Palace and a series of new auberges were built. The auberges in Valletta are much larger than their counterparts in Birgu, and can be considered as palaces. The most important auberge still standing is Auberge de Castille, which currently houses the Office of the Prime Minister of Malta. Over the years, the Grand Masters also built a number of large residences in the countryside, such as Verdala Palace and San Anton Palace. Both of these now serve as official residences of the president of Malta.\nThe Archbishop of Malta has a palace in Mdina. The inquisitor also had a palace in Birgu and another in Girgenti until the abolition of the inquisition in 1798. The nobility, upper classes and individual knights of the Order built a number of private palaces, especially in Valletta, but also in the countryside. There are other palaces built by the nobility, such as, most notably Palazzo Parisio in Valletta and Palazzo Dragonara in St Julians.\nNetherlands.\nThe Netherlands hosts several royal palaces that reflect its constitutional monarchy and a long-standing tradition of understated elegance. Dutch palaces tend to combine historical significance with functional design, often serving both ceremonial and administrative roles.\nOne of the most prominent is the Royal Palace of Amsterdam (Paleis op de Dam), located in the heart of the capital. Originally built in the 17th century as the city hall of Amsterdam during the Dutch Golden Age, it was later converted into a royal palace by King Louis Bonaparte, Napoleon\u2019s brother, in 1808. Today, it serves as one of the three official palaces of the Dutch royal family and is used for state visits, award ceremonies, and royal events. Its Classical architecture and richly decorated interiors reflect the power and wealth of Amsterdam in its mercantile heyday.\nIn The Hague, the monarch's official workplace is Noordeinde Palace, a 16th-century building expanded over time to accommodate its current administrative role. Nearby lies Huis ten Bosch Palace, the current residence of King Willem-Alexander and his family. Built in 1645 for Prince Frederick Henry, the palace is renowned for the Oranjezaal, a grand hall decorated with allegorical paintings in honor of the prince.\nAnother important historical palace is Het Loo Palace, located in Apeldoorn. Constructed in the late 17th century for Stadtholder William III and Queen Mary II of England, the palace served as a royal summer residence for centuries. Now a national museum, it offers insights into the lifestyle and heritage of the House of Orange-Nassau, complete with restored Baroque gardens and staterooms.\nSoestdijk Palace, once the residence of Queen Juliana and Prince Bernhard, and Drakensteyn Castle, a private estate formerly inhabited by Princess Beatrix, are also notable royal properties.\nSome examples of dutch palaces are Binnenhof, Breda Castle, Duin en Kruidberg, Het Loo Palace, Het Oude Loo, Huis ten Bosch, Peace Palace, Villa Welgelegen, Royal Palace of Amsterdam, Noordeinde Palace and Soestdijk Palace.\nPoland.\nThe former Kingdom of Poland, known as the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth, once spanned over , which allowed the nobles to construct their residences anywhere from modern-day Poland to as far as southern Estonia. The Polish aristocracy (szlachta) greatly favoured Baroque and Rococo architecture of the period. Most notable architect specializing in those styles was Dutch-born Tylman van Gameren (also Tylman Gamerski), who designed several renowned palaces, for both kings and nobles, throughout the Commonwealth. Tylman also left behind a lifelong legacy of buildings that are regarded as gems of Polish Baroque architecture. His most famous works include Krasi\u0144ski Palace and \u0141azienki Palace, both in Warsaw, and Branicki Palace in Bia\u0142ystok. Other palatial architects in Poland at the time were Chrystian Piotr Aigner, Szymon Bogumi\u0142 Zug, Domenico Merlini and Johann Christian Schuch.\nAt present, Poland possesses hundreds of varied-style palaces and residences designed by architects from all over the world. Some best examples are Wilan\u00f3w Palace, Presidential Palace, Oliwa Abbot's Palace, Copper-Roof Palace, Palace of the Ministry of Revenues and Treasury, Rogalin, Jab\u0142onowski Palace, Zamoyski Palace in Koz\u0142\u00f3wka, Lanckoro\u0144ski Palace in Kurozw\u0119ki, Niebor\u00f3w Palace and the Palace in Otwock Wielki. There are also several palaces resembling castles or medieval Gothic residences, most notably Moszna Castle, Ksi\u0105\u017c Castle and the Warsaw Royal Castle.\nPortugal.\nDue to its relatively small geography, most of Portugal's palaces are former royal residences. Some examples of Portuguese palaces are Mafra National Palace, Pena National Palace, Bel\u00e9m Palace, Ajuda National Palace, Pal\u00e1cio das Necessidades, Mateus Palace, Palace Hotel of Bussaco, Pal\u00e1cio da Regaleira, and Pal\u00e1cio da Brejoeira.\nRomania.\nPalaces in Romania, as elsewhere in Europe, were originally built for royalty, nobles and bishops. Three former royal palaces in Romania are the Cotroceni Palace (now the presidential residence); the Royal Palace in Bucharest, which now houses the National Museum of Art of Romania; and the Elisabeta Palace. Although Romania is no longer a constitutional monarchy, the current head of the former Romanian royal family, Princess Margareta of Romania, continues to reside at Elisabeta Palace in Bucharest.\nOther palaces include the Cre\u021bulescu Palace in Bucharest, built for the Cre\u021bulescu family, and Peles palace, built by King Carol I of Romania as a royal residence. \nThe Palace of the Parliament (Casa Poporului) from Bucharest and the Palace of Culture in Ia\u0219i (Palatul Culturii) are large government buildings, both purpose-built solely for government and public use.\nRussia.\nThe first palaces in Russia were built about a thousand years ago for the Grand Dukes of Kiev. These are not preserved, having been destroyed. Classical palaces were built during the reign of Tsar Peter the Great and his immediate successors. Examples of Russian palaces include:\nScandinavia.\nThe three Scandinavian countries of Denmark, Norway and Sweden all have long monarchic histories and possess several palaces. In Denmark Christiansborg Palace in Copenhagen was built as a royal palace, but is now only used for royal receptions; Amalienborg Palace has been the Danish royal residence since 1794. In Norway the Royal Palace in Oslo has been used as the royal residence since 1849. In Sweden the large Stockholm Palace was built in 1760, and remains the official royal residence, but at the current time is only used for official purposes while the Swedish royal family resides in the more modest Drottningholm Palace.\nSerbia.\nThe two dynasties of post-Ottoman Serbia, Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107 and Obrenovi\u0107, built numerous royal residences throughout the country. The most prominent are to be found in the capital, Belgrade: the Stari Dvor and Novi Dvor (Old Palace and New Palace, respectively) in the downtown, and the Dedinje Royal Compound which includes the Kraljevski Dvor the Beli Dvor (Royal Palace and White Palace, respectively) in the suburb of Dedinje.\nSpain.\nWith over a thousand years of monarchic history, Spain has many palaces of its own that were built for different monarchs or nobles. Among these palaces is the Royal Palace of Madrid, also referred to as the Palacio Real. The palace is the largest palace in Europe with over 2,800 rooms but at the current time is of use for only governmental business while the royal family resides in the smaller Palacio de la Zarzuela.\nIn addition to the Royal Palace of Madrid, Alc\u00e1zar of Seville (which mixes, with the delicate Moorish filigree, European Christian architectural styles), the Alhambra, the Monastery of San Lorenzo de El Escorial and the Royal Palace of Aranjuez, fine baroque palace is surrounded by gardens. Currently, the royal family and prime minister live in the more modest Palace of Zarzuela and Palace of Moncloa, respectively.\nUnited Kingdom.\nAlthough many English country houses can be called \"palatial\" in size and the richness of their contents, in the United Kingdom, by tacit agreement, the word \"palace\" is reserved for official residences (present or former) of the royal family or bishops, regardless of whether located in town or country. However, not all palaces use the term in their name \u2013 see Windsor Castle. Thus the Palace of Beaulieu gained its name precisely when Thomas Boleyn sold it to Henry VIII in 1517. Previously, it had been known as Walkfares, but like several other palaces including Hampton Court Palace, the name stuck even once the royal connection ended.\nBlenheim Palace was built, on a different site, in the grounds of the disused royal Palace of Woodstock, and the name was also part of the extraordinary honour when the house was given by a grateful nation to a great general, the Duke of Marlborough. Along with several royal and episcopal palaces in the countryside, Blenheim does demonstrate that \"palace\" has no specific urban connotation in English. On the use of the term \"palace\" in the UK, Buckingham Palace was known as Buckingham House before it was acquired by the monarchy.\nBlenheim Palace (in England) and Hamilton Palace (in Scotland, demolished in 1927) are the only non-royal and non-episcopal residences to have the word \"palace\" in their name, other than Dalkeith Palace in Scotland, which used to be the seat of the Dukes of Buccleuch (who descend from Charles II of England).\nOther.\nIn continental Europe royal and episcopal palaces were not merely residences; the clerks who administered the realm or the diocese laboured there as well. (To this day many bishops' palaces house both their family apartments and their official offices.) However, unlike the \"Palais du Justice\" which is often encountered in the French-speaking world, modern British public administration buildings are never called \"palaces\"; although the formal name for the \"Houses of Parliament\" is the Palace of Westminster, this reflects Westminster's former role as a royal residence and centre of administration.\nIn more recent years, the word has been used in a more informal sense for other large, impressive buildings, such as The Crystal Palace of 1851 (an immensely large, glazed hall erected for The Great Exhibition) and modern arenas-convention centers like Alexandra Palace.\nThe largest in the world is the Palace of the Parliament in Bucharest, Romania. Built during the socialist regime, no effort or expense was spared to raise this colossal neo-classic building.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Influenced by the modernism of James Joyce, D. H. Lawrence and Virginia Woolf, he developed a complex literary style and a body of work that challenged the dominant realist prose tradition of his home country, was satirical of Australian society, and sharply divided local critics. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1973 and is the only Australian to have been awarded it. \nBorn in London to affluent Australian parents, White spent his childhood in Sydney and on his family's rural properties. He was sent to an English public school at the age of 13, and went on to read modern languages at Cambridge. After graduating in 1935 he embarked on a literary career. His first published novel, \"Happy Valley\" (1939), was awarded the Gold Medal of the Australian Literature Society. In World War II he served as an intelligence officer in the Royal Air Force. While stationed in Alexandria, Egypt, in 1941, he met Manoly Lascaris, who became his life companion and, as White later wrote, \"the central mandala in my life's hitherto messy design.\"\nIn 1948 White returned to Australia, where he bought a small farm on the outskirts of Sydney. There he wrote the two novels, \"The Tree of Man\" (1955) and \"Voss\" (1957), that brought him critical acclaim in the United States and the United Kingdom. In the 1960s he wrote the novels \"Riders in the Chariot\" (1961) and \"The Solid Mandala\" (1966), and a series of plays, including \"The Season at Sarsaparilla\" and \"A Cheery Soul\", that had a major impact on Australian theatre.\nWhite and Lascaris moved to Sydney's Centennial Park in 1964. From the late 1960s White became increasingly involved in public affairs, opposing the Vietnam War and supporting Aboriginal self-determination, nuclear disarmament and various environmental causes. His later work includes the novels \"The Eye of the Storm\" (1973) and \"The Twyborn Affair\" (1979) and the memoir \"Flaws in the Glass\" (1981)\".\"\nChildhood and adolescence.\nWhite was born in Knightsbridge, London, on 28 May 1912. His Australian parents, Victor Martindale White, a wealthy sheep grazier, and Ruth (n\u00e9e Withycombe) were in England on an extended honeymoon. The family returned to Sydney, Australia, when he was six months old. As a child he lived in a flat with his sister, a nanny, and a maid while his parents lived in an adjoining flat. In 1916 they moved to a large house, \"Lulworth\", in Elizabeth Bay. At the age of four White developed asthma, a condition that had taken the life of his maternal grandfather, and his health was fragile throughout his childhood.\nAt the age of five he attended kindergarten at Sandtoft in Woollahra, close to their home. His mother often took him to plays and pantomimes and White developed a life long love of the theatre. Nevertheless, White felt closer to his nurse, Lizzie Clark, who taught him to tell the truth and \"not blow his own trumpet\".\nIn 1920 he attended Cranbrook School but his asthma worsened. Two years later he was sent to Tudor House School, a boarding school in the Southern Highlands of New South Wales, where it was thought the climate would help his lungs. White enjoyed the freedom provided by the school where discipline was lax. He read widely from the school library, wrote a play and excelled at English. In 1924 the boarding school ran into financial trouble, and the headmaster suggested that White be sent to a public school in England.\nIn April 1925 his parents took White to England to enrol in Cheltenham College in Gloucestershire. In his first years at Cheltenham he was withdrawn and had few friends. He found his housemaster to be sadistic and puritanical, and White's certitude of his own homosexuality increased his sense of isolation. He later wrote of Cheltenham, \"When the gates of my expensive prison closed I lost confidence in my mother, and [I] never forgave.\"\nOne of White's few pleasures was the time spent at the Somerset home of his cousin, the painter Jack Withycombe. Jack's daughter Elizabeth Withycombe became a mentor to him while he was completing his first, privately published, volume of verse, \"Thirteen Poems\", written between 1927 and 1929.\"\" White also became friends with Ronald Waterall who was two years his senior at Cheltenham and shared his passion for the theatre. He and White would spend their holidays in London seeing as many shows as they could.\nWhite asked his parents if he could leave school to become an actor. His parents compromised and allowed him to leave school without taking his final examinations if he came home to Australia to try life on the land. But their son had already changed his mind on his future profession and was determined to become a writer.\nIn December 1929 White left Cheltenham and sailed to Sydney. He spent two years working as a jackaroo on sheep stations at Bolaro in the Monaro district of New South Wales and at Barwon Vale in northern New South Wales. The landscapes impressed White and he wrote two unpublished novels during this time: \"The Immigrants\" and \"Sullen Moon\".\nWhite's uncle, who owned Barwon Vale, convinced White's parents that their son was not suited to the life of a grazier. White's mother was happy for him to become a writer but she wanted him to have a career as a diplomat as well. On this basis his parents agreed to send him to Cambridge. While studying for the entrance examinations, White completed a third unpublished novel, \"Finding Heaven\".\nEurope, America and war.\nFrom 1932 White lived in England, studying French and German literature at King's College, Cambridge. There he began a love affair with a fellow student that lasted until White graduated. White wrote poems, some of which were published in the \"London\" \"Mercury\". He spent his holidays in France and Germany to improve his languages and read Joyce, Lawrence, Proust, Flaubert, Stendhal and Thomas Mann with admiration. He made a pilgrimage to Zennor in Cornwall where Lawrence wrote \"Women in Love\" and the visit inspired further poems. A collection was published as \"The Ploughman and Other Poems\" in an edition of 300 in Sydney in 1935 but received little critical attention and was later suppressed by White. A play, \"Bread and Butter Women,\" was given an amateur production in Sydney the same year.\nOn White's graduation in 1935 his mother wanted him to embark on a diplomatic career but he was determined to stay in England and become a writer. His mother relented and his father granted him an allowance of \u00a3400 a year. He moved to London's Pimlico district where, in 1936, he met the Australian painter Roy de Maistre. De Maistre briefly became White's lover and remained a mentor and friend. White later said that de Maistre had encouraged him to break from naturalistic prose and write \"from the inside out.\"\nWhite began work on the novel \"Happy Valley,\" partly based on his experience working as a jackaroo. In 1937 his story \"The Twitching Colonel\" was published in the \"London Mercury\". His father died in December, leaving him a legacy of \u00a310,000 that enabled him to write full-time in relative comfort. He started work on a play, \"Return to Abyssinia\", and wrote skits for revues which were produced with moderate success. He completed \"Happy Valley\" and the novel was accepted by the British publisher George G. Harrap and Company in 1938.\n\"Happy Valley\" was published in early 1939 to generally favourable reviews which encouraged White to go to America to find a publisher there. White arrived in New York in April and travelled across the country. He visited Taos, New Mexico, where he viewed Lawrence's ashes and met Frieda Lawrence. He then moved to Cape Cod where he worked on a novel, \"The Living and the Dead\", partly based on his life in London. When the Second World War broke out in September, White took the first available ship back to England where he continued to work on his new novel.\nIn early 1940 White heard that Ben Huebsch, the head of the American publisher Viking, had accepted \"Happy Valley\". Huebsch had published Lawrence and Joyce in America and White was delighted with the connection to these writers. Huebsch was to become one of White's main literary supporters. White decided to travel back to New York for the publication of \"Happy Valley\" and to complete the new novel. Happy Valley was published in June to favourable reviews. Huebsch also accepted the now completed novel \"The Living and the Dead\" for publication.\nWhite returned to London where, in November, he was called up to an intelligence unit of the Royal Air Force. He was stationed at Bentley Priory during the Blitz before being transferred to North Africa in April 1941. He subsequently served in Egypt, Palestine and Greece. While stationed near Alexandria in July 1941 he met Manoly Lascaris, who was waiting to be recruited to the Royal Greek Army. Lascaris was to become White's life partner.\nFollowing the war White was determined to leave England to avoid \"the prospect of ceasing to be an artist and turning instead into that most sterile of beings, a London intellectual.\" White's preference was to live in Greece but Lascaris wanted to start a new life in Australia. White relented because, \"It was his illusion. I suppose I sensed it was better than mine.\"\nBefore leaving for Australia White began work on a novel \"The Aunt's Story\", inspired by a painting by Roy de Maistre. He sent the completed typescript to his American publisher in January 1947. In March, his play \"Return to Abyssinia\" opened in London to polite reviews. White missed its short season because he was in Australia making preparations for his permanent return. He returned to London and began a new play, \"The Ham Funeral,\" inspired by the William Dobell painting \"The Dead Landlord\".\nWhite sailed back to Australia in December 1947. During his voyage \"The Aunt's Story\" was published in the United States to very favourable reviews and strong sales. Critic James Stern's review in the \"New York Times Book Review\" was enthusiastic and Stern would go on to be one of White's major champions in America.\nReturn to Australia.\nWhite arrived back in Australia in February 1948. He and Lascaris moved to a small farm purchased by White at Castle Hill, now a Sydney suburb but then semi-rural. He named the house \"Dogwoods\", after trees he planted there. He and Lascaris worked the farm and sold flowers, vegetables, milk and cream as well as pedigree schnauzer puppies. \nThe reviews of \"The Aunt's Story\" in the British and Australian press were less enthusiastic than those in America, and White was unable to interest theatres in Australia or overseas in producing \"The Ham Funeral.\" He was making slow progress on the novel which was to become \"The Tree of Man\" and was discouraged at his prospects of success as a writer. He also questioned his decision to return to Australia.\nIn late 1951 White had a religious experience that gave him a belief in God and the inspiration to recommence work on \"The Tree of Man\" (published in 1955). He described the novel as an attempt to suggest \"every possible aspect of life, through the lives of an ordinary man and woman.\" \"The Tree of Man\" and his following work \"Voss\" (1957) established White's favourable critical reputation in Britain and America. White, however, was embittered by what he considered a hostile critical response in Australia.\nFollowing his international success White continued to live and work on his farm in Castle Hill. He gave few interviews and usually declined requests for public appearances, promotion of his work, and invitations for his membership of literary and cultural organisations. He entertained a close circle of friends at his home but always felt himself to be an outsider: \"first as a child with what kind of strange gift no one quite knew; then a despised colonial in an English public school; finally an artist in horrified Australia.\"\nIn 1961 his novel \"Riders in the Chariot\" was published, and was his first to receive almost universal critical praise in Australia. Meanwhile, White's interest had returned to the theatre. The Drama Committee of the Adelaide Festival had recommended \"The Ham Funeral\" as the festival's main theatrical production for 1962. The festival governors, however, rejected the play citing concerns about \"a piece of work which quite fails to reconcile poetry with social realism\" and a scene involving an aborted foetus in a dustbin. The controversy led to a successful amateur production of the play in Adelaide followed by a professional production in Sydney. White was inspired to write three further plays which were given professional productions: \"The Season at Sarsaparilla\" (1962), \"A Cheery Soul\" (1963) and \"Night on Bald Mountain\" (1964).\nIn 1963 White's mother died in London and his share of the estate allowed him to buy a house in Centennial Park, near the centre of Sydney, the following year. Before leaving Dogwoods, White had bought up every copy of his early published poems he could find and burnt them along with most of his manuscripts, papers, letters and journals.\nWhite was working on \"The Solid Mandala\", a novel about twins, Waldo and Arthur Brown, who represent contrary aspects of his own character. He was becoming interested in Tarot, astrology, the \"I Ching\" and Jungian psychology, and these interests are reflected in the novel. Following its publication in 1966, White declined the Britannica Award for Literature and Miles Franklin Award for the novel and stated he no longer wanted his works considered for awards.\nWhite had long had an interest in art and music, describing himself as \"something of a frustrated painter, and a composer manqu\u00e9.\" The core of his art collection was works by his friends Sidney Nolan and de Maistre but he collected works by emerging Australian artists such as James Clifford, Erica McGilchrist, and Lawrence Daws and some established artists like Brett Whiteley. In early 1967 he began work on \"The Vivisector\", a novel about a painter, Hurtle Duffield, who exploits human relationships for his art. After the novel was published in 1970, Nolan believed Duffield was based on him, but White denied this, stating that Duffield was a composite of his own character and the working life of the artists John Passmore and Godfrey Miller.\nWhite was becoming more politically engaged at this time. He was opposed to Australia's involvement in the Vietnam war, and in December 1969 he participated in his first political demonstration, breaking the law by publicly inciting young men not to register for military conscription. The following year he campaigned against censorship and gave evidence in favour of the publication of Philip Roth's novel \"Portnoy's Complaint\" at obscenity trials in Melbourne and Sydney. In 1972 the New South Wales government announced a plan to build an Olympic stadium near Centennial Park. White participated in the anti-development protests, giving speeches at a rally in June.\nWhite had been on the shortlist for the Nobel Prize in Literature since 1969. In 1971, after the prize was awarded to Pablo Neruda, he wrote to a friend: \"That Nobel Prize! I hope I never hear it mentioned again. I certainly don't want it; the machinery behind it seems a bit dirty, when we thought that only applied to Australian awards. In my case to win the prize would upset my life far too much, and it would embarrass me to be held up to the world as an Australian writer when, apart from the accident of blood, I feel I am temperamentally a cosmopolitan Londoner\".\nNobel laureate.\nIn 1970 White had begun working on a new novel, \"The Eye of the Storm\", about the meaning of his mother's death. He sent the completed work to his British publishers in December 1972. He delayed sending it to his American publishers, Viking, because \"The Vivisector\" had sold poorly in America and he hoped positive reviews of the new work in Britain would increase interest in the United States.\nThe novel was published in August 1973 and White was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in October. The Nobel citation praised him \"for an epic and psychological narrative art, which has introduced a new continent into literature\". White, pleading delicate health, declined to travel to Sweden to accept the award. Nolan attended the ceremony on his behalf.\nThe Nobel prize increased worldwide interest in White's work. \"Eye of the Storm\" was widely reviewed in the United States and sold 25,000 copies by March 1974. New editions of his previous novels were published and translation rights sold well. White, however, refused to have \"Happy Valley\" republished as he considered it an inferior early work and he was afraid that some of the people on whom characters were based might sue for defamation.\nAccording to David Marr, White's biographer, \"From the time of the prize his work became saturated with a late, relaxed sensuality.\" White himself was less relaxed about the effects of the award, telling a supporter: \"the Nobel Prize is a terrifying and destructive experience.\"\nWhite was made Australian of the Year for 1973. In his acceptance speech, he said that Australia Day should be \"a day of self-searching rather than trumpet blowing\" and that historian Manning Clark, comedian Barry Humphries and communist trade union leader Jack Mundey were more worthy of the award.\nIn May 1974 White gave a speech in support of the re-election of the Whitlam Labor government, stating that it was necessary for Australia to create: \"an intellectual climate from which artists would no longer feel the need to flee.\" Following a trip to Fraser Island to do research for a new novel \"A Fringe of Leaves\", he became a supporter of the campaign to stop sand mining on the island. He wrote to the re-elected prime minister Gough Whitlam on the issue and the campaign eventually forced the government to suspend its approval of mining and hold an inquiry on the matter.\nWhite was among the first group of the Companions of the Order of Australia in 1975 but resigned in June 1976 in protest against the dismissal of the Whitlam government in November 1975 by the Governor-General Sir John Kerr and the subsequent reintroduction of knighthoods as part of the order. White later wrote that Kerr's behaviour \"moved me farther to the Left and made me a convinced Republican.\" Over the following years, he would break with numerous long-term friends because he thought they supported the conservative establishment or had compromised their personal or artistic integrity.\nIn November 1975 the young theatre director Jim Sharman approached White to discuss a revival of \"The Season at Sarsaparilla.\" They also agreed to film his story \"The Night the Prowler\" and White began working on a script. The meeting sparked a revival in White's interest in theatre and a long-term working relationship between the two men.\nIn 1976 White was working on a new novel, \"The Twyborn Affair,\" partly based on aspects of his own life and that of male Antarctic explorer Herbert Dyce-Murphy (1879\u20131971) who had lived as a woman for several years. In researching his novel, White revisited the regions of New South Wales where White had lived and worked as a youth, and significant locations in London, France and Greece. In October, \"A Fringe of Leaves\" was published to generally favourable reviews and sold well. Sharman's production of \"A Season at Sarsaparilla\" in Sydney was also a critical success and attracted good audiences.\nIn 1977 a project to film \"Voss\" with Joseph Losey as director collapsed when the promoter Harry Miller failed to gain finance. Miller eventually sold the film rights to Nolan. The success of \"The Season at Sarsaparilla\" had inspired White to write his first play in over 12 years, \"Big Toys\", about plutocracy and corruption in Sydney. The play, directed by Sharman, premiered in Sydney in October but attracted generally unfavourable reviews and moderate audiences.The film of \"The Night the Prowler\", directed by Sharman, premiered at the \"Sydney Film Festival\" in June 1978. Reviews were generally unfavourable and the film failed at the box office. However, Sharman's 1979 production of \"A Cheery Soul\" for the Sydney Theatre Company broke box office records for the drama theatre of the Opera House despite mixed reviews. \"The Twyborn Affair\" was published in Britain in November 1979 to very positive reviews and became a best seller. The response from critics and the public in the United States was more subdued.\nIn October 1979 White started work on a memoir, \"Flaws in the Glass\", in which he planned to write publicly for the first time about his homosexuality and his relationship with Manoly Lascaris. The book was published in Britain in October 1981 to great publicity and became his biggest seller in his life time. Much of the publicity stemmed from his scathing character portraits of Nolan, Kerr and Joan Sutherland. Nolan considered suing White for defamation and their friendship ended.\nThe 1982 Adelaide Festival was directed by Sharman who had commissioned a new play by White, \"Signal Driver\". The festival also featured a short excerpt from an opera based on \"Voss.\" The opera had been commissioned by Opera Australia with Richard Meale as composer and David Malouf the librettist. Critics were generally lukewarm towards \"Signal Driver\", but encouraging towards the fragment of Voss. White, in contrast, disliked Meale's approach to \"Voss\" but was enthusiastic about the production of \"Signal Driver\". White was encouraged to write a new play for Sharman, \"Netherwood\", \"about the sanity in insanity and the insanity in sanity\". The play premiered in Adelaide in May 1983 but attracted hostile reviews which White considered a deliberate media campaign to sabotage his work.\nBy 1984 White had become disillusioned with the Hawke Labor government and publicly and financially supported the new Nuclear Disarmament Party. White had been publicly campaigning for nuclear disarmament since 1981, calling it: \"the most important moral issue in history.\"\nLate work and declining health.\nIn late 1984 White was hospitalised due to osteoporosis, crumbled vertebrae and glaucoma resulting from his long-term use of cortisone to treat his asthma and chest infections. Although he was still mentally agile, his physical health and mobility were declining.\nHe had recovered sufficiently by January 1985 to recommence work on a new novel, \"Memoirs of Many in One,\" which he described as a \"religious\" and \"bawdy\" novel about senility. Posing as the editor of the memoirs of Alex Xenophon Demirjian Gray, White felt free to explore various aspects of his own character. The novel was published in Britain on 1 April 1986 and sharply divided critics.\nSalman Rushdie wrote to White in 1985, praising the novel \"Voss:\" \"I cannot think when last a book so moved me.\" By this time, however, White was tired of praise for the novel as he rated several of his other works more highly. The completed opera \"Voss\" opened at the Adelaide Festival in March 1986 to general critical acclaim. White, however, boycotted the premiere because the festival had invited the Queen to attend. He attended the Sydney premiere later that year and judged it: \"a stupendous occasion.\"\nIn April 1987 White's new play, \"Shepherd on the Rocks,\" opened at Adelaide in a production directed by Neil Armfield. White attended and deemed it a success. He had also written three short prose poems which were published as \"Three Uneasy Pieces\" in late 1987\".\" White was determined that none of his works would be published or performed in 1988 which was the bicentenary of British settlement in Australia. He also urged a boycott of all official celebrations of the event, stating: \"circuses don't solve serious problems.\"\nWhite was hospitalised with pneumonia in August 1988. A nurse stayed at his home for the remainder of his life and he no longer had the strength to attend protest rallies. In June 1989, a selection of his public statements, speeches and interviews was published as \"Patrick White Speaks\". In October, the Sydney Theatre Company staged a successful revival of \"The Ham Funeral\" directed by Neil Armfield. White attended the premiere in his last public appearance.\nIn July 1990 White contracted pleurisy and suffered a bronchial collapse. He refused to be hospitalised and died at home at dawn on 30 September.\nReligious and political views.\nReligion.\nWhite was raised an Anglican but stated, \"I\u2026 went through my youth believing in nothing but my own ego.\" In late 1951 he experienced a religious conversion:If I say I had no religious tendencies between adolescence and \"The Tree of Man\", it's because I was sufficiently vain and egotistical to feel one can ignore certain realities. (I think the turning point came during a season of unending rain at Castle Hill when I fell flat on my back one day in the mud and starting cursing a God I had convinced myself didn't exist. My personal scheme of things until then at once seemed too foolish to continue holding.)As the 1950s progressed White became disillusioned with the Anglican church and his religious beliefs became more eclectic. He once described himself as a \"lapsed Anglican egotist agnostic pantheist occultist existentialist would-be though failed Christian Australian.\" White stated in 1981 that he did not call himself a Christian because he could not follow Christ's injunction to forgive. In 1969, however, he had affirmed the importance of religion in his work: \"Religion. Yes, that's behind all my books. What I am interested in is the relationship between the blundering human being and God.\"\nPolitics.\nIn the 1930s White was not politically engaged, but was sympathetic to the Francoist cause in the Spanish Civil War and supported Britain's policy of appeasing Hitler. He later expressed regret over his complacency regarding European fascism. On his return to Australia after the Second World War he had little interest in politics but routinely voted for the conservative coalition in elections. He became involved in politics in 1969 when he joined protests against the Vietnam war and conscription of Australian troops for the conflict. He also supported Trade Union Green Bans against development proposals which threatened the urban environment. He publicly supported the Australian Labor Party in the federal elections of 1972, 1974 and 1975 despite a falling out with the prime minister Gough Whitlam over sand mining on Fraser Island. Following the dismissal of the Whitlam government in November 1975, he became a prominent advocate for an Australian republic. He was a public supporter of Aboriginal self-determination and privately donated money towards Aboriginal education. From 1981 he became a leading public figure in campaigns for nuclear disarmament and continued his support for various environmental causes. Marr states that a common thread running through his political interventions was his opposition to plutocracy. Academic Martin Thomas argues that White was acutely aware of his own privileged upbringing and this drove his later concern about social injustice.\nCritical reception.\nWhite's first published novel, \"Happy Valley\" (1939), received favourable reviews in Britain and Australia, although some critics noted that it was too derivative of Joyce, Lawrence and Woolf. The novel was awarded the Gold Medal of the Australian Literature Society. \"The Living and the Dead\" (1941) and \"The Aunt's Story\" (1948) attracted little critical attention in Australia, although the latter was favourably reviewed in the \"New York Times Review of Books\".\n\"The Tree of Man\" (1955) was White's first major international success, attracting positive reviews in the United States and the United Kingdom. James Stern, writing in the \"New York Times Book Review,\" praised the novel as \"a timeless work of art.\" Australian reviewers were more divided, poet A. D. Hope calling White's prose \"pretentious and illiterate verbal sludge.\" The novel sold eight thousand copies in Australia in the first three months and was awarded the Gold Medal of the Australian Literature Society.\n\"Voss\" (1957) was reviewed favourably in the United Kingdom but critics in the United States and Australia were more ambivalent. A significant body of Australian critics continued to fault White's prose style and some objected to his rejection of the realist prose tradition. The novel was a best seller in the United Kingdom and won the inaugural Australian Miles Franklin Award. \"Riders in the Chariot\" (1961) also achieved critical and commercial success in the United Kingdom, and won admiring reviews in Australia.\nBy 1963, White was widely accepted as the major Australian literary novelist. A. D. Hope called him \"unquestionably the best known and most discussed novelist of the day\" and thought his success was \"indicative of a break with the naturalistic tradition which has dominated Australian fiction since the turn of the century, and may well be a portent of a more imaginative and a more intellectual sort of fiction.\" White was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1973. Academic Elizabeth Webby states that many critics consider \"The Twyborn Affair\" the best of his subsequent work.\nKatherine Brisbane states that the reception of White's plays has been ambivalent as they mix realism, expressionism and poetic and vernacular dialogue in a way which has challenged audiences and directors. \"The Ham Funeral\" (1947) was successfully produced in 1962 after it was rejected by the Adelaide Festival for obscenity. It was successfully revived in 1989. The Season at Sarsaparilla (1962) has been his most produced play.\nThemes and style.\nThemes.\nAccording to critic Brian Kiernan, \"the basic situation in his [White's] fiction is the attempt of individuals, most often individuals alienated from society, to grasp some higher, more essential reality that lies beyond or behind social existence.\" The search for a higher reality is most often presented as an exploration of various forms of religious or mystical experience and the \"seers\" are variously pioneer-settlers (\"The Tree of Man\"), explorers (\"Voss\"), artists (\"The Vivisector\"), the simple-minded (\"The Solid Mandala\"), those fleeing into the self (\"The Aunt's Story\") or those on the margins of society. Sexual ambivalence and the search for personal identity are also recurrent themes that becomes more prominent in the later novels.\nSociety, in particular Australian society, is mostly portrayed as materialistic, conformist and life-inhibiting. White satirises what he called, in 1958, \"The Great Australian Emptiness\"in which the mind is the least of possessions, in which the rich man is the important man, in which the schoolmaster and the journalist rule what intellectual roost there is, in which beautiful youths and girls stare at life through blind blue eyes, in which human teeth fall like autumn leaves, the buttocks of cars grow hourly glassier, food means cake and steak, muscles prevail, and the march of material ugliness does not raise a quiver from the average nerves.\"The academic Mark Williams argues that White places the religious impulse at the centre of the human condition and his work, adding that \"religion is one of the central values, along with art and love, which he considers to be denigrated in his homeland.\" Kiernan notes a division among critics over whether \"he is essentially a simple and traditional writer who affirms a religious, even mystical view of life, or one who is distinctively modern, sophisticated and ironic, continually exploring transcendent possibilities but with detachment and even scepticism.\" Greg Clarke argues that Christian discourse is central to White's writing. Marr, Williams and Kiernan, however, state that White drew on various religious and mystical traditions in his work including Judaism, Jungian archetypes and gnosticism.\nStyle.\nWhite's early novels were heavily influenced by the modernism of Eliot, Joyce, Lawrence and Woolf. Kiernan has called his mature work \"complex, ambiguous and ironic verbal structures\". His narratives shift seamlessly between past and present, inner experience and outer awareness, and the point of view of different characters. According to Williams, \"the point of view of the narrative in any White novel changes continually, rapidly and disconcertingly. The narrative voice ... is a voice composed of many voices, a slippery, complex, fluent medium.\"\nWhite frequently shifts between tones, styles and linguistic registers. According to Kiernan, \"A self-conscious play with conventions, a parodic playfulness, is apparent through White's adoption of various modes in his work from the first.\" His transitions between realist, expressionist, symbolist and romantic modes were a conscious attempt to demonstrate that \"the Australian novel is not necessarily the dreary, dun-coloured offspring of journalistic realism.\" Kiernan states that in \"Voss\" the theme of the outsider as visionary explorer of the human condition is undercut by ironic comedy and parodies of the \"gothic excess\" of romantic literature. Williams argues that White's tendency for parody and playfulness become more prominent in later works such as \"The Twyborn Affair\" and \"Memoirs of Many in One.\" The tone becomes less portentous and more relaxed, and the works more self-referential.\nInfluence and legacy.\nCritic Susan Lever considers White a pivotal figure in Australian literature, stating that he made the novel, rather than poetry, the pre-eminent literary form. He \"transformed the possibilities of the Australian novel by demonstrating that it was a place to test ideas against complex spiritual, psychological and emotional experience, not only an avenue for national storytelling.\" \nAustralian novelists influenced by White include Thomas Keneally, Thea Astley, Randolph Stow and Christopher Koch. Lever argues that the following generations of novelists were more influenced by recent trends in world literature. Novelist David Malouf states that White's \"High Modernism\" is a literary form that has become unfashionable but that this could change. In 2018, novelist Christos Tsiolkas argued that White was an important figure in Australian literature who hadn't received enough attention in recent decades. Writing in 2024, critic Martin Thomas noted that critical and public interest in White had declined.\nThe Patrick White Award is an annual literary prize which White founded in 1975 with the prize money from his Nobel prize. It is awarded to writers who have made a significant contribution to Australian literature. The Patrick White Indigenous Writers Award is for Indigenous students in New South Wales from Kindergarten to year 12. It is run by the Aboriginal Education Council which was a beneficiary of Patrick White's estate. The Sydney Theatre Company sponsors the Patrick White Playwrights Award and Fellowship in honour of White's contribution to Australian theatre. \nIn 2006 the National Library of Australia acquired a large quantity of White's manuscripts. These included an unfinished novel, \"The Hanging Garden,\" which was published in 2012. The Art Gallery of New South Wales owns a 1940 portrait of White by de Maistre, and Parliament House, Sydney, owns a 1980 portrait by Brett Whiteley. A portrait of White by Louis Kahan won the 1962 Archibald Prize. White donated much of his own collection of Australian art to the Art Gallery of New South Wales.\nAs of 2024 there is no museum or institution dedicated to White's life and work. His former residence, \"Dogwoods\", at Castle Hill is privately owned but has a commemorative plaque and the surrounding streets are named after him. His former Sydney residence at Centennial Park is privately owned but is heritage listed. White is commemorated by the Patrick White Lawns adjacent to the National Library of Australia in Canberra.\nIn 2006 a hoaxer submitted a chapter of White's novel \"The Eye of the Storm\" to a dozen Australian publishers under the name Wraith Picket (an anagram of White's name). All of the publishers rejected the manuscript and none recognised it as White's work.\nIn 2010 White's novel \"The Vivisector\" was shortlisted for the Lost Man Booker Prize for 1970. In 2011 Fred Schepisi's film adaptation of the novel \"The Eye of the Storm\" won The Age Critics Award for the best Australian feature at the Melbourne International Film Festival.\nList of works.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nHonours and awards.\nWhite's numerous honours and awards include:\nWhite was offered a knighthood in 1970, but declined it.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Sister-inline/styles.css\"/&gt; Media related to at Wikimedia Commons"}

He had served as Pope Theodore I's ambassador to Constantinople, and was elected to succeed him as pope. He was the only pope when Constantinople controlled the papacy whose election had not awaited imperial mandate. For his strong opposition to Monothelitism, Pope Martin I was arrested by Emperor Constans II, carried off to Constantinople, and ultimately banished to Cherson. He is considered a saint by both the Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church, as well as the last pope recognised as a martyr.\nEarly life and career.\nMartin was born near Todi, Umbria, in the place nowadays named after him: Pian di San Martino, close to Todi. According to his biographer Theodore, Martin was of noble birth, of commanding intelligence, and showed great charity to the poor.\nPiazza states that Martin belonged to the order of St Basil. By 641, he was an abbot, and Pope John IV sent him to Dalmatia and Istria with large sums of money to alleviate the distress of the inhabitants, and redeem captives seized during the invasion of the Sclaveni (those parts mainly settled by Croats). As the ruined churches could not be rebuilt, the relics of some of the more important Dalmatian saints were brought to Rome. John, himself from Dalmatia, then had them venerated by building the Chapel of St Venantius at the Lateran Baptistery. As Mackie suggests in her article, referenced above, the St Venantius Chapel remains an important early example of a \"martyrium\": a shrine specifically commissioned to venerate relics brought from afar. With regard to the martyr cult, such structures represented the pinnacle of devotional building. They often became sites of pilgrimage.\nMartin acted as \"apocrisiarius\" or legate ('nuncio') at Constantinople from the earliest years of Theodore I (642\u201349). He sent him as ambassador to Constantinople, seat of the empire in its eastern half. Albeit where the pope was based, Rome was by now second fiddle \u2013 economically, militarily and politically \u2013 to Constantinople. However, the eastern half of the Empire was suffering its own turbulence due to Arab expansion, Jerusalem's conquest in 637, and theological disputes having polarised Christians (the major religion of the empire).\nBeing placed, for so much of Theodore's papacy, in charge of diplomacy between the Lateran patriarchate and the Byzantine court speaks of Martin's preeminence. It was as a deacon that he was elected to the papal throne after the pope died (13 May 649).\nPapacy (649\u2013653).\nWhen Martin I was elected pope, the capital of the erstwhile Roman Empire was Constantinople. It sat amidst the eastern domains, where the most influential Church leader was the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople who was also guardian of Christendom's holiest relics, such as the Crown of thorns and the True Cross. To bring teaching prevalent in Constantinople into line with that elsewhere, and hastening to heal fissures appearing within the Catholic Church, decisiveness distinguished Martin from the start. According to Piero Bargellini, he neither sought nor waited for the Byzantine emperor Constans II's consent to his election. To emphasise the point, it was without the customary imperial ratification that Martin had himself consecrated.\nIn the previous year, the emperor had published the Typos of Constans. This document defended the heretical Monothelite thesis, which watered down the Catholic faith by claiming that Christ had not in fact had a human will. To silence this, and the confusion it caused, Pope Martin convened, within his first three months, the Lateran Council of 649, to which all the bishops of the West were invited. The Council met in the basilica of St. John Lateran in Rome. It was attended by 105 bishops (chiefly from Italy, Sicily, and Sardinia, with some from Africa and other quarters). Over five sessions or \"secretarii\" from 5 to 31 October 649, resulting in twenty canons, the Council censured Monothelitism, its authors, and the writings via which Monothelitism had spread and caused rifts within the Catholic Church. This condemnation embraced not only the latest emperor's \"Typos\" but also the \"Ecthesis\" (the exposition of faith of Patriarch Sergius I of Constantinople, for which Emperor Heraclius had stood sponsor).\nImperial interference in matters theological had been soundly rejected. Condemnation of all Monothelite writings provoked an angry reaction from the Byzantine court. Martin, unabashed, hastened to publish the Lateran Council decrees in an encyclical. Constans responded by getting his exarch in Italy to arrest the pope should he persist, and to send him as a prisoner to Constantinople. Martin was also accused by Constans of unauthorised contact and collaboration with the Muslims of the Rashidun Caliphate\u2014allegations which he remained unable to convince the infuriated imperial authorities to drop.\nThe arrest orders could not be carried out for more than three years. On 17 June 653, Martin was arrested in the Lateran, along with Maximus the Confessor. He was hurried out of Rome and conveyed first to Naxos, Greece, and subsequently to Constantinople, where he arrived on 17 September 653. He was saved from execution by the pleas of Patriarch Paul II of Constantinople, who was himself gravely ill. Martin hoped that a new pope would not be elected while he lived but the imperial Byzantine government forced the Romans to find a successor. Eugene I was elected on 10 August 654, and Martin apparently acquiesced. After suffering an exhausting imprisonment and reportedly many public indignities, Martin was banished to Cherson, where he arrived on 15 May 655. He died there on 16 September.\nLegacy.\nA selection of documents recording the trial and exile of Pope Martin I was translated into Latin in Rome in the ninth century by Anastasius Bibliothecarius.\nSince the 1969 revision of the General Roman Calendar, the memorial of Saint Martin I, which earlier versions of the calendar place on 12 November, is on 13 April, celebrated as the formal anniversary of his death. In the Byzantine-rite Churches, his feast day is 14 April (27 April New Style).\nPope Pius VII made an honourable reference to Martin in his 1800 encyclical \"Diu satis\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Indeed, the famous Martin who long ago won great praise for this See, commends faithfulness and fortitude to Us by his strengthening and defense of the truth and by the endurance of labors and pains. He was driven from his See and from the City, stripped of his rule, his rank, and his entire fortune. As soon as he arrived in any peaceful place, he was forced to move. Despite his advanced age and an illness which prevented his walking, he was banished to a remote land and repeatedly threatened with an even more painful exile. Without the assistance offered by the pious generosity of individuals, he would not have had food for himself and his few attendants. Although he was tempted daily in his weakened and lonely state, he never surrendered his integrity. No deceit could trick, no fear perturb, no promises conquer, no difficulties or dangers break him. His enemies could extract from him no sign which would not prove to all that Peter \"until this time and forever lives in his successors and exercises judgment as is particularly clear in every age\" as an excellent writer at the Council of Ephesus says.\nThe breviary of the Byzantine Churches states: \"Glorious definer of the Orthodox Faith... sacred chief of divine dogmas, unstained by error... true reprover of heresy... foundation of bishops, pillar of the Orthodox faith, teacher of religion... Thou didst adorn the divine see of Peter, and since from this divine Rock, thou didst immovably defend the Church, so now thou art glorified with him.\u201d\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was the last French pope to hold his court in Rome before the papacy moved to Avignon.\nBefore his election, Simon de Brion was a prominent French cleric who served as chancellor to Louis IX of France and was made a cardinal by Pope Urban IV in 1261. His papacy was marked by close dependence on Charles of Anjou, whom he appointed Senator of Rome, and by significant political conflicts, including the excommunication of the Byzantine Emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos, which ended the fragile union between the Eastern Orthodox and Roman Catholic Churches established at the Second Council of Lyons in 1274. Martin IV also faced the Sicilian Vespers uprising and excommunicated Peter III of Aragon, declaring a crusade against him in an unsuccessful attempt to maintain Angevin control over Sicily.\nDue to political instability and hostility in Rome and Orvieto, Martin IV spent much of his pontificate outside the city and died in Perugia in 1285.\nEarly life.\nSimon de Brion, son of Jean, sieur de Brion, was born at the ch\u00e2teau of Meinpincien, \u00cele-de-France, France, in the decade following 1210. He had a brother named Gilo, who was a knight in the Diocese of Sens. The seigneurial family of Brion, who took their name from Brion near Joigny, flourished in the \"Brie fran\u00e7ais\". He spent time at the University of Paris, and is said to have then studied law at Padua and Bologna. Through papal favour he received a canonry at Saint-Quentin in 1238 and spent the period 1248\u20131259 as a canon of the cathedral chapter in Rouen, finally as archdeacon. At the same time he was appointed treasurer of the church of St. Martin in Tours by King Louis IX of France, an office he held until he was elected pope in 1281. In 1255\u20131259, King Louis IX founded the French royal convent at Longchamps for the Poor Clares (Minoresses); the King's sister Isabelle was the patroness (though she never entered the cloister herself), and Simon de Brion was the Guardian. In 1259, he was appointed to the council of the king, who made him keeper of the great seal, chancellor of France, one of the great officers in the household of the king. He became Chancellor of Louis IX of France (1260\u20131261).\nCardinal Simon de Brion.\nOn 17 December 1261, the new French Pope, Urban IV (Jacques Pantal\u00e9on), made Chancellor de Brion cardinal-priest, with the \"titulus\" of the church of St. Cecilia. This would have entailed Simon de Brion's residence in Rome, but the affairs of Pope Urban required that he send a representative of the highest level to France to deal personally with King Louis IX and his brother Charles of Anjou and Provence. Simon's previous experience at the French Court made him the perfect choice as Legate.\nCardinal Simon therefore returned to France as Papal Legate for Urban IV and also for his successor Pope Clement IV in 1264\u20131268. In 1264, on the eve of S. Bartholomew, he held a general synod at Paris. He was appointed again, by Pope Gregory X on 1 August 1274, and he served continuously in France until 1279. His first task was to raise support and money for a Crusade against Manfred, the Hohenstaufen candidate for the Imperial Crown. He immediately became deeply involved in the negotiations for papal support for the assumption of the crown of Sicily by Charles of Anjou. As Legate he presided over several synods on reform, and on the raising of funds for Pope Gregory's crusade. The most important of these was held at Bourges on 13 September 1276.\nSignatures on papal bulls indicate that Cardinal Simon was back in Viterbo by 11 January 1268. In a letter of 14 or 15 January 1268, Pope Clement IV wrote to Cardinal Simon de Brion that he had heard that the Cardinal had fallen from his horse and in the accident had injured his leg. He also wrote that Conradin and Ludwig Duke of Bavaria were at Verona, and were pressing for Pavia. A general war was likely. Cardinal Simon's injury must not have been severe, since, on 3 April 1268, the Pope wrote to him with the request (not an order) that he undertake a legation to Germany (Teutonia), if he wished and if it were possible. The Pope needed a prudent and faithful man, who had clean hands and eyes wide open, who could stay centered on the business and let himself stray neither right nor left, who could preserve the Empire, keep the Apostolic See free from scandal, and the neighboring kingdoms free from danger. In vetting names, Simon seemed the most suitable.\nPope Clement IV (Guy Foulques) fell ill on the Feast of S. Cecilia (22 November), and died at Viterbo on 29 November 1268. He had governed the Church for three years, nine months, and twenty-four days. The See of Peter was vacant for two years and nine months. Cardinal Simon de Brion came from France to attend the Conclave, which took place in the Episcopal Palace, next to the Cathedral of S. Lorenzo in Viterbo. He was the senior cardinal-priest. Around Pentecost of 1270 (1 June), Cardinal Simon and Cardinal Riccardo Annibaldi of S. Angelo had to leave the Conclave and retire to their residences for the sake of their health. On 22 August 1270, he was one of the signatories to the letter of protest sent by the Cardinals to Raynerius Gatti, Captain of the City of Viterbo, to cease and desist from their harassment of the Cardinals and their suites. He was one of the cardinals who signed the electoral compact on September, 1270, to leave the election of a new pope to a committee of six, promising to accept the committee's decision. He was not, however, one of the six cardinals elected to the Compromise Committee that selected Archdeacon Teobaldo Visconti as pope on 1 September 1270. The newly elected pope was not present in Viterbo, but was serving on Crusade with King Edward I of England. He arrived in Italy on 1 January 1271, and travelled to Viterbo, where he arrived early in February. He accepted the election, and chose to be called Gregory X. He and the Curia travelled to Rome, arriving on 13 March. On 19 March he was ordained a priest, and on 27 March he was consecrated bishop, and then crowned by Cardinal Giovanni Gaetano Orsini.\nThree Conclaves of 1276.\nSimon de Brion's appointment as Legate in France, made by Pope Gregory on 1 August 1274 continued throughout 1276. He was unable to be present for the Conclave of 1 January 1276, which elected Peter of Tarantaise as Pope Innocent V. Nor was he present for the Conclave of 2\u201311 July, which elected Ottobono Fieschi as Pope Adrian V. Nor was he present at the September Conclave, which, on 8 September, elected Peter Julian as Pope John XXI. In each case the election was completed before he could have been notified, and before he could have travelled from France to central Italy. This was one of the defects of Gregory X's regulations on the holding of a Conclave.\nElection of Nicholas III.\nPope John XXI was in contact with Cardinal Simon. He had written to him on 3 March 1277, ordering him to speak with the king of France about matters connected with Alfonso of Castile. But the Pope died rather suddenly, after a reign of only eight months. He was still living in the Episcopal Palace in Viterbo, where Adrian V (Fieschi) had died and where he had been elected. The palace was still under construction, when suddenly the roof of one of the chambers collapsed. The Pope was in the room at the time, and he was severely injured. He died three (or six) days later, on 20 May 1277. Cardinal Simon de Brion was still in France when the Conclave began, but he was unable to predict that the Conclave would last until 25 November, and therefore he was not present. There were only seven cardinals in Viterbo, since neither Innocent V, nor Adrian V, nor John XXI had named any new cardinals. They argued on and on, trying to choose a pope. There were three cardinals who favored the Angevin Charles I and his designs. There were three who opposed him. Cardinal Bertrand de Saint Martin, Bishop of Sabina, the only surviving Cardinal Bishop, held a middle course, or perhaps one should say he saw too clearly to be willing to commit to either party. Finally, they chose Cardinal Giovanni Gaetani (Orsini), a native Roman, the Deacon of S. Nicola in Carcere and senior Deacon, and Archpriest of the Vatican Basilica.\nNicholas III immediately set out for Rome, where he was ordained a priest on 18 December 1277, and consecrated Bishop of Rome on 19 December. He was crowned on the Feast of S. Stephen, 26 December 1277 at the Vatican Basilica. One person, at least, was deeply unhappy about the outcome of this Conclave, King Charles I of Sicily. The new Orsini pope was an enemy of the Angevins, and Charles knew he would have nothing but trouble from Nicholas III.\nA week after the election of Nicholas III, the new pope wrote to Simon, who was still Legate in France, urging him to effect a reconciliation between the King of France, Philip III, and the King of Leon and Castile, Alfonso the Wise. Since the King of Aragon, Peter III (who was married to Constance of Sicily) was involved in the struggle over Sicily with Charles I, this peace initiative threatened King Charles directly. On 22 April 1279, Pope Nicholas wrote to Cardinal Simon about King Philip. The Pope had issued a prohibition on tournaments, and King Philip and his barons were flagrantly violating the prohibition. Cardinal Simon was ordered to excommunicate the King of France.\nTo ensure that his victory against the Angevins would stand, Nicholas III decided to go forward with a much needed addition to the Sacred College of Cardinals. At his first opportunity, on 12 March 1278, he created ten cardinals. Five cardinal bishops were named: Latino Frangipani Malabranca, OP, of Rome (Nicholas III's nephew by his sister Mabilia); Erhard de Lessines (Lesigny), of Langres, son of Guillaume, Marshal of Champagne; Bentivenga de Bentivengis, O.Min., of Aquasparta; Robert Kilwardby, OP, Archbishop of Canterbury; and Ordo\u00f1o (Ordeonio) \u00c1lvarez, Bishop of Braga. Two cardinal-priests were named: Gerardo Bianchi of Parma, and Girolamo Masci d' Ascoli, O.Min., of Picenum. He also appointed three cardinal-deacons: Giordano Orsini, brother of Pope Nicholas III, of Rome; Giacomo Colonna of Rome; and Gerardo Cupalates, O.Min., of Piacenza. The effect of these creations was to seriously dilute the Angevin influence in the Sacred College, and to considerably increase the monastic element, especially the Franciscan one. It needs to be recalled that Nicholas III was the Governor, Corrector, and Protector of the Franciscans. The Roman influence was also strengthened. The inevitable consequence would be that the next pope too would not be a creature of Charles I of Sicily.\nEventually, though, by 19 October 1279, Pope Nicholas recalled Cardinal Simon de Brion.\nConclave of 1280\u20131281.\nPope Nicholas III (Giovanni Caetano Orsini) died at Castro Soriano in the diocese of Viterbo on 22 August 1280 of an apoplectic stroke which had left him without speech. A story was circulated nonetheless that he had been poisoned. At the time of his death on 22 August 1280, there were thirteen cardinals. This would be the fifth Conclave in five years. King Charles had taken the trouble to make friends with the Annibaldi faction, led by Riccardo Annibaldi, who were enemies of the Orsini and who had been driven out of Rome in street fighting following the death of Nicholas III. They had taken refuge in Viterbo, and now, by coincidence, they were present and entrenched and ready to make trouble on behalf of Charles I and themselves. Annibaldi led a coup in Viterbo, which drove out the governor of the city, Orso Orsini, the dead pope's nephew. The Angevins thereupon dominated the Conclave, in which the regulations of Gregory X were still in abeyance. But the Conclave still required a two-thirds vote to elect a pope, in according with the Constitution of Alexander III, which was still in effect. Neither the Orsini faction nor the French faction had sufficient votes to elect, but each had sufficient votes to block an election. The stalemate continued throughout the winter. On 2 February 1281, the Feast of the Purification of the Blessed Virgin Mary, a mob broke into the Episcopal palace, where the Conclave was in progress, and abducted two of the cardinals, Matteo Rosso Orsini and Giordano Orsini (the late pope's brother). Without their opposition, Simon de Brion was unanimously elected to the papacy on 22 February 1281, taking the name Martin IV,\nFor the third time in fifteen years Viterbo had hosted a papal conclave. And for the third time there were disorders which had threatened the validity of the election and the lives of the participants. Viterbo was placed under the ban of excommunication and of the interdict for the imprisonment of the cardinals. It was not possible, therefore, for the Coronation to take place in Viterbo. But Rome was not at all inclined to accept a hated Frenchman as Pope. Martin IV sent two cardinals, Latino Orsini and Goffredo da Alatri, to Rome with a letter, proposing that he be crowned in Rome on Quadragesima Sunday. The Romans positively refused to allow the Coronation to take place in Rome. But they did hold a public meeting, and elected Giovanni Caetani Orsini in his purely personal capacity as their Senator, and authorized him to appoint anyone he chose as his substitute. So Martin IV was crowned instead at Orvieto on 23 March 1281. He never visited Rome during his Pontificate. Instead he immediately sent his Vicar, Peter of Lavagna, to Rome. But on 30 April 1281, Pope Martin handed the senatorial power over to King Charles for the rest of his reign.\nPapacy.\nDependent on Charles of Anjou in nearly everything, the new Pope quickly appointed him to the position of Senator of Rome. At the insistence of Charles, Martin IV excommunicated the Eastern Roman Emperor Michael VIII Palaeologus, who stood in the way of Charles's plans to restore the Latin Empire of the East that had been established in the aftermath of the Fourth Crusade. He thus broke the tenuous union which had been reached between the Greek and the Latin Churches at the Second Council of Lyons in 1274 and further compromise was rendered impossible.\nIn 1282, Charles lost control of the island of Sicily in the violent massacre known as the Sicilian Vespers. The Sicilians had elected Peter III of Aragon as their king and sought papal confirmation, in vain, though they were willing to reconfirm Sicily as a vassal state of the papacy. Martin IV used all the spiritual and material resources at his command against the Aragonese in order to preserve Sicily for the House of Anjou. He excommunicated Peter III, declared his kingdom of Aragon forfeit, and ordered a crusade against him, but it was all in vain.\nDue to the hostility of Raynerius, the Captain of Orvieto, in the repeated struggles between Guelphs and Ghibellines, Pope Martin was unable to remain at Orvieto. He removed himself and the Papal Curia from Orvieto on 26 June 1284, and arrived in Perugia on 4 October. He died at Perugia on 28 March 1285.\nFollowing the example of Nicholas III, Pope Martin IV created new cardinals at his first opportunity, on the \"Quattuor Tempora\" of Lent, 12 April 1281. His new cardinals included: Bernardus de Languissello of N\u00eemes, the Archbishop of Arles since 1273; Hugh of Evesham, Canon of York and Archdeacon of Worcester; Gervasius de Glincamp of Mans, Archdeacon of Paris; Comes Giusianus, Conte de Casate, of Milan, Auditor of the Rota; Gaufridus (Geoffroy) de Barro or Barbeau, of Burgundy, Dean of the Cathedral of Paris; Johannes Chauleti (Cholet), of the village of Nointre in the diocese of Beauvais, a personal friend of Philip III, Philip IV, and Pope Martin IV; and Benedetto Gaetano of Anagni, who was elected Pope Boniface VIII on 24 December 1295. The French influence is strongly in evidence, and only Cardinal Gaetano came from the neighborhood of Rome.\nDeath.\nPope Martin IV celebrated a solemn Mass in the Cathedral of Perugia on Easter Sunday, 25 March 1285, which was also the Feast of the Annunciation. After his usual lunch with his chaplains, he was stricken with a sudden illness. On Easter Wednesday, 28 March, around the fifth hour of the night, he died. He was buried in the Cathedral of San Lorenzo in Perugia. He had reigned four years and one month. His successor was elected four days later, on 2 April.\nIn the \"Divine Comedy\", Dante sees Martin IV in Purgatory, where the reader is reminded of the former pontiff's fondness for Lake Bolsena eels and Vernaccia wine.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

His election effectively ended the Western Schism of 1378\u20131417. As of 2025, he remains the last pope to have taken the pontifical name \"Martin\".\nBiography.\nOddone Colonna was born between 26 January and 20 February 1369 at Genazzano, the son of Agapito Colonna, Lord of Genazzano, Capranica Prenestina, San Vito and Ciciliano from 1374, who died after 23 May 1398, and wife Caterina Conti. He belonged to one of the oldest and most distinguished families of Rome. His brother Giordano, Lord of Genazzano, Capranica Prenestina, San Vito and Ciciliano, a Neapolitan General, Patrician of Naples in 1417, was shortly Prince of Salerno and Duke of Venosa from 3 August 1419, dying of plague on 16 August 1422, having married Mascia Annibaldi, who died in 1423, without issue, while his sister Paola was Lady of Piombino between 1441 and 1445.\nOddone studied law at the University of Pavia; he became apostolic protonotary under Pope Urban VI (1378\u20131389), and was created Cardinal-Deacon of San Giorgio in Velabro by Pope Innocent VII in 1405. \nIn 1409 he took part in the Council of Pisa, and was one of the supporters of Antipope Alexander V. Later he confirmed his allegiance to Alexander's successor, John XXIII, by whom his family obtained several privileges, while Oddone obtained for himself the vicariate of Todi, Orvieto, Perugia and Umbria; He was excommunicated for this in 1411 by Pope Gregory XII. Oddone was with John XXIII's entourage at the Council of Constance [Costanza] and followed him in his escape at Schaffhausen [Sciaffusa] on 21 March 1415; later he returned to Constance and took part in the process leading to the deposition of John XXIII.\nPapacy.\nElection.\nAfter deposing Antipope John XXIII in 1415, the Council of Constance (1417) was long divided by the conflicting claims of Pope Gregory XII (1406\u201315) and Antipope Benedict XIII (1394\u20131423); eventually Gregory resigned and Benedict was deposed, ending the schism. Age 48, Martin was elected pope at the Council on 11 November 1417, taking his pontifical name in honour of Martin of Tours, whose feast fell on the day of his election. Participants in the conclave included 23 cardinals and 30 delegates of the council. He was ordained a priest on 13 November 1417, and consecrated bishop the next day.\nMartin left Constance at the close of the council (May 1418), but travelled slowly through Italy and lingered at Florence. His authority in Rome was represented by his brother Giordano, who had fought under Muzio Attendolo against the condottiero Braccio da Montone. The Pope at the time ruled only Rome (when not rebellious) and its environs: Braccio held Umbria, Bologna as an independent commune, while much of Romagna and the Marche was held by local \"vicars\", who were in fact petty hereditary lords. In particular, Martin confirmed Giorgio Ordelaffi in Forl\u00ec, Ludovico Alidosi in Imola, Malatesta IV Malatesta in Rimini, and Guidantonio da Montefeltro in Spoleto, who would later marry the pope's niece Caterina Colonna. \nIn exchange for the recognition of Joanna II of Naples, Martin obtained the restitution of Benevento, several fiefs in the Kingdom of Naples for his relatives and, most important of all, an agreement that Muzio Attendolo, then hired by the Neapolitans, should leave Rome.\nAfter a long stay in Florence while these matters were arranged, Martin was able to enter Rome in September 1420. He at once set to work establishing order and restoring the dilapidated churches, palaces, bridges, and other public structures. For this reconstruction he engaged some famous masters of the Tuscan school and helped instigate the Roman Renaissance.\nFaced with competing plans for general reform offered by various nations, Martin V submitted a counter-scheme and entered into negotiations for separate concordats, for the most part vague and illusory, with the Holy Roman Empire, England, France and Spain.\nHussite Wars.\nBy 1415 Bohemia was in turmoil and the subject of much discussion at the Council of Constance. Adherents of Jan Hus, who had been previously burned at the stake as a heretic by the council, adopted the practice of Communion under both kinds. The Council sent letters to the civil and ecclesiastical authorities in Bohemia, insisting they deal with the heresy. Bohemian and Moravian nobles responded that the sentence on Hus was unjust and insulting to their country, and promised to protect priests against episcopal prosecutions for heresy. \n\u2014community-gathered semi-religious laymen, generally tradesmen, bound if by vow, only temporary ones of chastity and obedience (but not poverty)\u2014arrived in Bohemia, attracted by its reputation for religious liberty. Prague was placed under interdict for sheltering the excommunicated . \nIn 1419 King Wenceslaus IV, who had resisted what he considered interference in his kingdom, commanded that all ejected Catholic beneficiaries should be reinstated in their offices and revenues. Prague prepared for armed resistance. Jan \u017delivsk\u00fd, an extreme anti-Catholic preacher of Prague, led a procession to the town hall, where under the leadership of Jan \u017di\u017eka of Trocnov, a noble of southern Bohemia, the building was stormed and people found inside were thrown out of the windows on to the spears and swords of the processionists, and hacked to pieces. In Kuttenberg, hundreds of captured Hussites were thrown by the miners into the shafts of disused silver mines. King Wenceslaus swore death to all the rebels, but died of a stroke in August, 1419. The next months were marked by deeds of violence; many citizens, especially Germans, had to flee.\nWenceslaus was succeeded by his brother Sigismund, King of the Romans and King of Hungary, who prepared to restore order. On 1 March 1420, Pope Martin V issued a Bull inviting all Christians to unite in a crusade against the Wycliffites (Lollards), Hussites, and other heretics. In 1428, the pope commanded that the remains of Wycliffe, who was posthumously declared a heretic in 1415, be dug up and burned. The crusades against the Lollards, however, were ultimately unsuccessful.\nCrusades.\nAccording to Burton, Pope Martin authorized a crusade against Africa in 1418 in relation to the slave trade.\nIn addition to the Hussite Crusades, Martin declared a Crusade against the Ottoman Empire in 1420 in response to the rising pressure from the Ottoman Turks. In 1419\u20131420 Martin had diplomatic contacts with the Byzantine emperor Manuel II, who was invoking a council in Constantinople. On 12 July 1420 the Pope conceded to attach an indulgence to anyone who would contribute to a crusade against the latter, which would be led by Sigismund, King of the Romans.\nWar against Braccio da Montone.\nThe main concern of Martin's pontificate from 1423 was the resumed war against Braccio da Montone. The following year, the combined Papal-Neapolitan army, led by Giacomo Caldora and Francesco Sforza, defeated him at the Battle of L'Aquila (2 June 1424); Braccio died a few days later.\nIn the same year Martin obtained a reduction of the autonomy of the commune of Bologna, whose finances would be thenceforth under the authority of a papal treasurer. He also ended the war with Braccio da Montone in exchange for his recognition as vicar and reconciled with the deposed John XXIII, to whom he gave the title of Cardinal of Tusculum.\nAnnuity contracts.\nCanon law prohibited interest upon a loan. To avoid this, annuities were paid, interest in effect but not in name. The dispute as to the legality of annuity contracts was brought before Martin V in 1423. He held that purchased annuities, which were redeemable at the option of the seller, were lawful. When the lawfulness of annuities was established, they were widely used in commerce; it seems that city states used them to raise compulsory loans from their citizens.\nPeriodic ecumenical councils.\nA decree of the Council of Constance (\"Frequens\") ordered that councils should be held every five years. Martin V summoned a council in 1423 that met first at Pavia and later at Siena (the \"Council of Siena\"). It was rather poorly attended, which gave the Pope a pretext for dissolving it, as soon as it had come to the resolution that \"internal church union by reform ought to take precedence over external union\". It was prorogued for seven years. The seventeenth council then met as the \"Council of Basel\" in February 1431 shortly before Martin's death.\nFounding of the University of Louvain.\nOn December 9, 1425, Martin founded the University of Louvain or Universitas Lovaniensis in Leuven (also known as \"Louvain\" in both English and French), a town in what was then the Duchy of Brabant, and what is modern day Belgium.\nDeath.\nMartin V died in Rome of a stroke on 20 February 1431 at the age of 62. He is buried at St. John Lateran Basilica.\nPersonal views.\nPosition on Jews.\nThe excitement of the Church during the Hussite movement rendered the Jews apprehensive, and through Emperor Sigismund, they obtained from Pope Martin V various bulls (1418 and 1422) in which their former privileges were confirmed and in which he exhorted the friars to use moderate language. In the last years of his pontificate, however, he repealed several of his ordinances. A gathering, convoked by the Jews in Forl\u00ec, sent a deputation asking Pope Martin V to abolish the oppressive laws promulgated by Antipope Benedict XIII. The deputation succeeded in its mission.\nPosition on slavery.\nDuring the Middle Ages, slavery had fallen out of usage in Europe, with the Church denouncing enslavement of Christians; however, voyages and discoveries brought other continents, where slavery still existed, into European contact, raising the question of whether slavery of unbelievers and outside of Europe was permitted. According to Burton, Pope Martin V authorized a crusade against Africa in 1418, and this, coupled with a later bull of Pope Eugene IV (1441), sanctioned the Portuguese trade in African slaves. In March 1425, Davis notes that a bull was issued that threatened excommunication for any dealers in Christian slaves and ordered Jews to wear a \"badge of infamy\" to deter, in part, the buying of Christians. Setton states that in June 1425 Martin anathematized those who sold Christian slaves to Muslims. Maxwell states that traffic in Christian slaves was not banned, instead it was purely sales to non-Christian owners. Davidson argues that the papal bull of excommunication issued to the Genoese merchants of Caffa related to the buying and selling of Christians, but was considered ineffectual, as prior injunctions against the Viennese\u2014including the Laws of Gazaria\u2014made allowances for the sale of both Christian and Muslim slaves. Semmes states that ten black African slaves were presented to Martin by Prince Henry of Portugal. Other scholarly sources argue that Martin supported colonial expansion. Davidson argues that Martin's injunction against slavery was not a condemnation of slavery itself, but rather driven through fear of \"infidel power\".\nNorman Housley states that \"political weakness compelled the Renaissance Papacy to adopt an acquiescent and unchallenging position when approached for requests for privileges in favour of these ventures\", and that he viewed it \"hard to avoid the conclusion that the pope was agreeing to whatever was asked of him by the king\".\nResidences.\nDuring his permanence in Rome, Martin moved his residence from the Lateran to Santa Maria Maggiore and, from 1424, the Basilica of Santi Apostoli near the Palazzo Colonna. He also frequently sojourned in towns held by his family in the Latium (Tivoli, Vicovaro, Marino, Gallicano and others).\nNumbering.\nWhen the second Pope to take the name Martin was elected in 1281, there was confusion over how many Popes had taken the name before. It was believed then that there were three, so the new Pope of 1281 became Martin IV. But, in reality, those believed to be Martin II and Martin III were actually named Marinus I and Marinus II, although they are sometimes still referred to as \"Martin II\" and \"Martin III\". This has advanced the numbering of all subsequent Popes Martin by two. Popes Martin IV\u2013V were actually the second and third popes by that name.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Though Perl is not officially an acronym, there are various backronyms in use, including \"Practical Extraction and Reporting Language\".\nPerl was developed by Larry Wall in 1987 as a general-purpose Unix scripting language to make report processing easier. Since then, it has undergone many changes and revisions. Perl originally was not capitalized and the name was changed to being capitalized by the time Perl 4 was released. The latest release is Perl 5, first released in 1994. From 2000 to October 2019 a sixth version of Perl was in development; the sixth version's name was changed to Raku. Both languages continue to be developed independently by different development teams which liberally borrow ideas from each other.\nPerl borrows features from other programming languages including C, sh, AWK, and sed. It provides text processing facilities without the arbitrary data-length limits of many contemporary Unix command line tools. Perl is a highly expressive programming language: source code for a given algorithm can be short and highly compressible.\nPerl gained widespread popularity in the mid-1990s as a CGI scripting language, in part due to its powerful regular expression and string parsing abilities. In addition to CGI, Perl 5 is used for system administration, network programming, finance, bioinformatics, and other applications, such as for graphical user interfaces (GUIs). It has been nicknamed \"the Swiss Army chainsaw of scripting languages\" because of its flexibility and power. In 1998, it was also referred to as the \"duct tape that holds the Internet together\", in reference to both its ubiquitous use as a glue language and its perceived inelegance.\nName and logos.\nPerl was originally named \"Pearl\". Wall wanted to give the language a short name with positive connotations. It is also a Christian reference to the Parable of the Pearl from the Gospel of Matthew. However, Wall discovered the existing PEARL language before Perl's official release and dropped the \"a\" from the name.\nThe name is occasionally expanded as a backronym: \"Practical Extraction and Report Language\" and Wall's own \"Pathologically Eclectic Rubbish Lister\", which is in the manual page for perl.\n\"Programming Perl\", published by O'Reilly Media, features a picture of a dromedary camel on the cover and is commonly called the \"Camel Book\". This image has become an unofficial symbol of Perl. O'Reilly owns the image as a trademark but licenses it for non-commercial use, requiring only an acknowledgement and a link to www.perl.com. Licensing for commercial use is decided on a case-by-case basis. O'Reilly also provides \"Programming Republic of Perl\" logos for non-commercial sites and \"Powered by Perl\" buttons for any site that uses Perl.\nThe Perl Foundation owns an alternative symbol, an onion, which it licenses to its subsidiaries, Perl Mongers, PerlMonks, Perl.org, and others. The symbol is a visual pun on pearl onion.\nIn 2024, a new camel logo for the language was published under a Creative Commons license by a small group of developers. While not an official logo, it is intended to represent both the language and the community and draws on Perl's longtime association with the camel from the O'Reilly book.\nHistory.\nEarly versions.\nLarry Wall began work on Perl in 1987, while employed as a programmer at Unisys; he released version 1.0 on December 18, 1987. Wall based early \"Perl\" on some methods existing languages used for text manipulation.\nPerl 2, released in June 1988, featured a better regular expression engine. Perl 3, released in October 1989, added support for binary data streams.\n1990s.\nOriginally, the only documentation for Perl was a single lengthy man page. In 1991, \"Programming Perl\", known to many Perl programmers as the \"Camel Book\" because of its cover, was published and became the \"de facto\" reference for the language. At the same time, the Perl version number was bumped to 4, not to mark a major change in the language but to identify the version that was well documented by the book. Perl 4 was released in March 1991.\nPerl 4 went through a series of maintenance releases, culminating in Perl 4.036 in 1993, whereupon Wall abandoned Perl 4 to begin work on Perl 5. Initial design of Perl 5 continued into 1994. The \"perl5-porters\" mailing list was established in May 1994 to coordinate work on porting Perl 5 to different platforms. It remains the primary forum for development, maintenance, and porting of Perl 5.\nPerl 5.000 was released on October 17, 1994. It was a nearly complete rewrite of the interpreter, and it added many new features to the language, including objects, references, lexical (my) variables, and modules. Importantly, modules provided a mechanism for extending the language without modifying the interpreter. This allowed the core interpreter to stabilize, even as it enabled ordinary Perl programmers to add new language features. Perl 5 has been in active development since then.\nPerl 5.001 was released on March 13, 1995. Perl 5.002 was released on February 29, 1996 with the new prototypes feature. This allowed module authors to make subroutines that behaved like Perl builtins. Perl 5.003 was released June 25, 1996, as a security release.\nOne of the most important events in Perl 5 history took place outside of the language proper and was a consequence of its module support. On October 26, 1995, the Comprehensive Perl Archive Network (CPAN) was established as a repository for the Perl language and Perl modules; as of December 2022[ [update]], it carries over 211,850 modules in 43,865 distributions, written by more than 14,324 authors, and is mirrored worldwide at more than 245 locations.\nPerl 5.004 was released on May 15, 1997, and included, among other things, the UNIVERSAL package, giving Perl a base object from which all classes were automatically derived and the ability to require versions of modules. Another significant development was the inclusion of the CGI.pm module, which contributed to Perl's popularity as a CGI scripting language.\nPerl 5.004 added support for Microsoft Windows, Plan 9, QNX, and AmigaOS.\nPerl 5.005 was released on July 22, 1998. This release included several enhancements to the regex engine, new hooks into the backend through the codice_1 modules, the codice_2 regex quote operator, a large selection of other new core modules, and added support for several more operating systems, including BeOS.\n2000\u20132020.\nPerl 5.6 was released on March 22, 2000. Major changes included 64-bit support, Unicode string representation, support for files over 2 GiB, and the \"our\" keyword. When developing Perl 5.6, the decision was made to switch the versioning scheme to one more similar to other open source projects; after 5.005_63, the next version became 5.5.640, with plans for development versions to have odd numbers and stable versions to have even numbers.\nIn 2000, Wall put forth a call for suggestions for a new version of Perl from the community. The process resulted in 361 RFC (Request for Comments) documents that were to be used in guiding development of Perl 6. In 2001, work began on the \"Apocalypses\" for Perl 6, a series of documents meant to summarize the change requests and present the design of the next generation of Perl. They were presented as a digest of the RFCs, rather than a formal document. At this time, Perl 6 existed only as a description of a language.\nPerl 5.8 was first released on July 18, 2002, and further 5.X versions have been released approximately yearly since then. Perl 5.8 improved Unicode support, added a new I/O implementation, added a new thread implementation, improved numeric accuracy, and added several new modules. As of 2013, this version was still the most popular Perl version and was used by Red Hat Linux 5, SUSE Linux 10, Solaris 10, HP-UX 11.31, and AIX 5.\nIn 2004, work began on the \"Synopses\" \u2013 documents that originally summarized the Apocalypses, but which became the specification for the Perl 6 language. In February 2005, Audrey Tang began work on Pugs, a Perl 6 interpreter written in Haskell. This was the first concerted effort toward making Perl 6 a reality. This effort stalled in 2006.\nThe Perl On New Internal Engine (PONIE) project existed from 2003 until 2006. It was to be a bridge between Perl 5 and 6, and an effort to rewrite the Perl 5 interpreter to run on the Perl 6 Parrot virtual machine. The goal was to ensure the future of the millions of lines of Perl 5 code at thousands of companies around the world. The PONIE project ended in 2006 and is no longer being actively developed. Some of the improvements made to the Perl 5 interpreter as part of PONIE were folded into that project.\nOn December 18, 2007, the 20th anniversary of Perl 1.0, Perl 5.10.0 was released. Perl 5.10.0 included notable new features, which brought it closer to Perl 6. These included a switch statement (called \"given\"/\"when\"), regular expressions updates, and the \"smart match operator\" (~~).\nAround this same time, development began in earnest on another implementation of Perl 6 known as Rakudo Perl, developed in tandem with the Parrot virtual machine. As of November 2009, Rakudo Perl has had regular monthly releases and now is the most complete implementation of Perl 6.\nA major change in the development process of Perl 5 occurred with Perl 5.11; the development community has switched to a monthly release cycle of development releases, with a yearly schedule of stable releases. By that plan, bugfix point releases will follow the stable releases every three months.\nOn April 12, 2010, Perl 5.12.0 was released. Notable core enhancements include new codice_3 syntax, the yada yada operator (intended to mark placeholder code that is not yet implemented), implicit strictures, full Y2038 compliance, regex conversion overloading, DTrace support, and Unicode 5.2.\nOn May 14, 2011, Perl 5.14 was released with JSON support built-in.\nOn May 20, 2012, Perl 5.16 was released. Notable new features include the ability to specify a given version of Perl that one wishes to emulate, allowing users to upgrade their version of Perl, but still run old scripts that would normally be incompatible. Perl 5.16 also updates the core to support Unicode 6.1.\nOn May 18, 2013, Perl 5.18 was released. Notable new features include the new dtrace hooks, lexical subs, more CORE:: subs, overhaul of the hash for security reasons, support for Unicode 6.2.\nOn May 27, 2014, Perl 5.20 was released. Notable new features include subroutine signatures, hash slices/new slice syntax, postfix dereferencing (experimental), Unicode 6.3, and a rand() function using a consistent random number generator.\nSome observers credit the release of Perl 5.10 with the start of the Modern Perl movement. In particular, this phrase describes a style of development that embraces the use of the CPAN, takes advantage of recent developments in the language, and is rigorous about creating high quality code. While the book \"Modern Perl\" may be the most visible standard-bearer of this idea, other groups such as the Enlightened Perl Organization have taken up the cause.\nIn late 2012 and 2013, several projects for alternative implementations for Perl 5 started: Perl5 in Perl6 by the Rakudo Perl team, \"moe\" by Stevan Little and friends, \"p2\" by the Perl11 team under Reini Urban, \"gperl\" by goccy, and \"rperl,\" a Kickstarter project led by Will Braswell and affiliated with the Perl11 project.\nPerl 6 and Raku.\nAt the 2000 Perl Conference, Jon Orwant made a case for a major new language initiative. This led to a decision to begin work on a redesign of the language, to be called Perl 6. Proposals for new language features were solicited from the Perl community at large, which submitted more than 300 RFCs.\nWall spent the next few years digesting the RFCs and synthesizing them into a coherent framework for Perl 6. He presented his design for Perl 6 in a series of documents called \"apocalypses\" \u2013 numbered to correspond to chapters in \"Programming Perl\". As of January\u00a02011[ [update]], the developing specification of Perl 6 was encapsulated in design documents called Synopses \u2013 numbered to correspond to Apocalypses.\nThesis work by Bradley M. Kuhn, overseen by Wall, considered the possible use of the Java virtual machine as a runtime for Perl. Kuhn's thesis showed this approach to be problematic. In 2001, it was decided that Perl 6 would run on a cross-language virtual machine called Parrot.\nIn 2005, Audrey Tang created the Pugs project, an implementation of Perl 6 in Haskell. This acted as a test platform for the Perl 6 language (separate from the development of the actual implementation), allowing the language designers to explore. The Pugs project spawned an active Perl/Haskell cross-language community centered around the Libera Chat #raku IRC channel. Many functional programming influences were absorbed by the Perl 6 design team.\nIn 2012, Perl 6 development was centered primarily on two compilers:\nIn 2013, MoarVM (\"Metamodel On A Runtime\"), a C language-based virtual machine designed primarily for Rakudo was announced.\nIn October 2019, Perl 6 was renamed to Raku.\nAs of 2017[ [update]] only the Rakudo implementation and MoarVM are under active development, and other virtual machines, such as the Java Virtual Machine and JavaScript, are supported.\nPerl 7.\nIn June 2020, Perl 7 was announced as the successor to Perl 5. Perl 7 was to initially be based on Perl 5.32 with a release expected in first half of 2021, and release candidates sooner.\nThis plan was revised in May 2021, without any release timeframe or version of Perl 5 for use as a baseline specified. When Perl 7 would be released, Perl 5 would have gone into long term maintenance. Supported Perl 5 versions however would continue to get important security and bug fixes.\nPerl 7 was announced on 24 June 2020 at \"The Perl Conference in the Cloud\" as the successor to Perl 5. Based on Perl 5.32, Perl 7 was planned to be backward compatible with modern Perl 5 code; Perl 5 code, without boilerplate (pragma) header needs adding codice_4 to stay compatible, but modern code can drop some of the boilerplate.\nThe plan to go to Perl 7 brought up more discussion, however, and the Perl Steering Committee canceled it to avoid issues with backward compatibility for scripts that were not written to the pragmas and modules that would become the default in Perl 7. Perl 7 will only come out when the developers add enough features to warrant a major release upgrade.\nDesign.\nPhilosophy.\nAccording to Wall, Perl has two slogans. The first is \"There's more than one way to do it,\" commonly known as TMTOWTDI, (pronounced \"Tim Toady\"). As proponents of this motto argue, this philosophy makes it easy to write concise statements.\nThe second slogan is \"Easy things should be easy and hard things should be possible\".\nThe design of Perl can be understood as a response to three broad trends in the computer industry: falling hardware costs, rising labor costs, and improvements in compiler technology. Many earlier computer languages, such as Fortran and C, aimed to make efficient use of expensive computer hardware. In contrast, Perl was designed so that computer programmers could write programs more quickly and easily.\nPerl has many features that ease the task of the programmer at the expense of greater CPU and memory requirements. These include automatic memory management; dynamic typing; strings, lists, and hashes; regular expressions; introspection; and an codice_5 function. Perl follows the theory of \"no built-in limits\", an idea similar to the Zero One Infinity rule.\nWall was trained as a linguist, and the design of Perl is very much informed by linguistic principles. Examples include Huffman coding (common constructions should be short), good end-weighting (the important information should come first), and a large collection of language primitives. Perl favors language constructs that are concise and natural for humans to write, even where they complicate the Perl interpreter.\nPerl's syntax reflects the idea that \"things that are different should look different.\" For example, scalars, arrays, and hashes have different leading sigils. Array indices and hash keys use different kinds of braces. Strings and regular expressions have different standard delimiters.\nThere is a broad practical bent to both the Perl language and the community and culture that surround it. The preface to \"Programming Perl\" begins: \"Perl is a language for getting your job done.\" One consequence of this is that Perl is not a tidy language. It includes many features, tolerates exceptions to its rules, and employs heuristics to resolve syntactical ambiguities. Because of the forgiving nature of the compiler, bugs can sometimes be hard to find. Perl's function documentation remarks on the variant behavior of built-in functions in list and scalar contexts by saying, \"In general, they do what you want, unless you want consistency.\"\nFeatures.\nThe overall structure of Perl derives broadly from C. Perl is procedural in nature, with variables, expressions, assignment statements, brace-delimited blocks, control structures, and subroutines.\nPerl also takes features from shell programming. All variables are marked with leading sigils, which allow variables to be interpolated directly into strings. However, unlike the shell, Perl uses sigils on all accesses to variables, and unlike most other programming languages that use sigils, the sigil doesn't denote the type of the variable but the type of the expression. So for example, while an array is denoted by the sigil \"@\" (for example codice_6), an individual member of the array is denoted by the scalar sigil \"$\" (for example codice_7). Perl also has many built-in functions that provide tools often used in shell programming (although many of these tools are implemented by programs external to the shell) such as sorting, and calling operating system facilities.\nPerl takes hashes (\"associative arrays\") from AWK and regular expressions from sed. These simplify many parsing, text-handling, and data-management tasks. Shared with Lisp is the implicit return of the last value in a block, and all statements are also expressions which can be used in larger expressions themselves.\nPerl 5 added features that support complex data structures, first-class functions (that is, closures as values), and an object-oriented programming model. These include references, packages, class-based method dispatch, and lexically scoped variables, along with compiler directives (for example, the codice_8 pragma). A major additional feature introduced with Perl 5 was the ability to package code as reusable modules. Wall later stated that \"The whole intent of Perl 5's module system was to encourage the growth of Perl culture rather than the Perl core.\"\nAll versions of Perl do automatic data-typing and automatic memory management. The interpreter knows the type and storage requirements of every data object in the program; it allocates and frees storage for them as necessary using reference counting (so it cannot deallocate circular data structures without manual intervention). Legal type conversions \u2013 for example, conversions from number to string \u2013 are done automatically at run time; illegal type conversions are fatal errors.\nSyntax.\nPerl has been referred to as \"line noise\" and a \"write-only language\" by its critics. Randal L. Schwartz in the first edition of the book \"Learning Perl\", in the first chapter states: \"Yes, sometimes Perl looks like line noise to the uninitiated, but to the seasoned Perl programmer, it looks like checksummed line noise with a mission in life.\" He also stated that the accusation that Perl is a write-only language could be avoided by coding with \"proper care\". The Perl overview document \"perlintro\" states that the names of built-in \"magic\" scalar variables \"look like punctuation or line noise\". However, the English module provides both long and short English alternatives. \"perlstyle\" document states that line noise in regular expressions could be mitigated using the codice_9 modifier to add whitespace.\nAccording to the \"Perl 6 FAQ\", Perl 6 was designed to mitigate \"the usual suspects\" that elicit the \"line noise\" claim from Perl 5 critics, including the removal of \"the majority of the punctuation variables\" and the sanitization of the regex syntax. The \"Perl 6 FAQ\" also states that what is sometimes referred to as Perl's line noise is \"the actual syntax of the language\" just as gerunds and prepositions are a part of the English language. In a December 2012 blog posting, despite claiming that \"Rakudo Perl 6 has failed and will continue to fail unless it gets some adult supervision\", chromatic stated that the design of Perl 6 has a \"well-defined grammar\", an \"improved type system, a unified object system with an intelligent metamodel, metaoperators, and a clearer system of context that provides for such niceties as pervasive laziness.\" He also stated that \"Perl 6 has a coherence and a consistency that Perl 5 lacks.\"\nIn Perl, one could write the \"Hello, World!\" program as:\nprint \"Hello, World!\\n\";\nHere is a more complex Perl program, that counts down seconds from a given starting value:\nuse strict;\nuse warnings;\nmy ( $remaining, $total );\n$remaining=$total=shift(@ARGV);\nSTDOUT-&gt;autoflush(1);\nwhile ( $remaining ) {\n printf ( \"Remaining %s/%s \\r\", $remaining--, $total );\n sleep 1;\nprint \"\\n\";\nTo run the code above, store it in a file named codice_10, and then execute it.\n$ perl counter.pl 42\nThe Perl interpreter can also be used for one-off scripts on the command line. The following example (as invoked from an sh-compatible shell, such as Bash) translates the string \"Bob\" in all files ending with .txt in the current directory to \"Robert\":\n$ perl -i.bak -lp -e 's/Bob/Robert/g' *.txt\nImplementation.\nNo written specification or standard for the Perl language exists for Perl versions through Perl 5, and there are no plans to create one for the current version of Perl. There has been only one implementation of the interpreter, and the language has evolved along with it. That interpreter, together with its functional tests, stands as a \"de facto\" specification of the language. Perl 6, however, started with a specification, and several projects aim to implement some or all of the specification.\nPerl is implemented as a core interpreter, written in C, together with a large collection of modules, written in Perl and C. As of 2010[ [update]], the interpreter is 150,000 lines of C code and compiles to a 1\u00a0MB executable on typical machine architectures. Alternatively, the interpreter can be compiled to a link library and embedded in other programs. There are nearly 500 modules in the distribution, comprising 200,000 lines of Perl and an additional 350,000 lines of C code (much of the C code in the modules consists of character encoding tables).\nThe interpreter has an object-oriented architecture. All of the elements of the Perl language\u2014scalars, arrays, hashes, coderefs, file handles\u2014are represented in the interpreter by C structs. Operations on these structs are defined by a large collection of macros, typedefs, and functions; these constitute the Perl C API. The Perl API can be bewildering to the uninitiated, but its entry points follow a consistent naming scheme, which provides guidance to those who use it.\nThe life of a Perl interpreter divides broadly into a compile phase and a run phase. According to Alu\u00edn et al., \"Perl cannot be parsed by a straight Lex/Yacc lexer/parser combination. Instead, the interpreter implements its own lexer, which coordinates with a modified GNU bison parser to resolve ambiguities in the language.\"\nMost of what happens in Perl's compile phase is compilation, and most of what happens in Perl's run phase is execution, but there are significant exceptions. Perl makes important use of its capability to execute Perl code during the compile phase. Perl will also delay compilation into the run phase. The terms that indicate the kind of processing that is actually occurring at any moment are \"compile time\" and \"run time\". Perl is in compile time at most points during the compile phase, but compile time may also be entered during the run phase. The compile time for code in a string argument passed to the codice_11 built-in occurs during the run phase. Perl is often in run time during the compile phase and spends most of the run phase in run time. Code in codice_12 blocks executes at run time but in the compile phase.\nAt compile time, the interpreter parses Perl code into a syntax tree. At run time, it executes the program by walking the tree. Text is parsed only once, and the syntax tree is subject to optimization before it is executed, so that execution is relatively efficient. Compile-time optimizations on the syntax tree include constant folding and context propagation, but peephole optimization is also performed.\nPerl has a Turing-complete grammar because parsing can be affected by run-time code executed during the compile phase. The code cannot be parsed by a straight Lex/Yacc lexer/parser. To resolve ambiguities in the language the interpreter must implement its own lexer to coordinate with a modified GNU bison parser.\nIt is often said that \"Only perl can parse Perl\", meaning that only the Perl interpreter (\"codice_13\") can parse the Perl language (\"Perl\"), but even this is not, in general, true. Because the Perl interpreter can simulate a Turing machine during its compile phase, it would need to decide the halting problem in order to complete parsing in every case. It is a longstanding result that the halting problem is undecidable, and therefore not even Perl can always parse Perl. Perl makes the unusual choice of giving the user access to its full programming power in its own compile phase. The cost in terms of theoretical purity is high, but practical inconvenience seems to be rare.\nOther programs that undertake to parse Perl, such as source-code analyzers and auto-indenters, have to contend not only with ambiguous syntactic constructs but also with the undecidability of Perl parsing in the general case. Adam Kennedy's PPI project focused on parsing Perl code as a document (retaining its integrity as a document), instead of parsing Perl as executable code (that not even Perl itself can always do). It was Kennedy who first conjectured that \"parsing Perl suffers from the 'halting problem',\" which was later proved.\nPerl is distributed with over 250,000 functional tests for core Perl language and over 250,000 functional tests for core modules. These run as part of the normal build process and extensively exercise the interpreter and its core modules. Perl developers rely on the functional tests to ensure that changes to the interpreter do not introduce software bugs; further, Perl users who see that the interpreter passes its functional tests on their system can have a high degree of confidence that it is working properly.\nPorts.\nPerl is dual licensed under both the Artistic License 1.0 and the GNU General Public License. Distributions are available for most operating systems. It is particularly prevalent on Unix and Unix-like systems, but it has been ported to most modern (and many obsolete) platforms. With only six reported exceptions, Perl can be compiled from source code on all POSIX-compliant, or otherwise-Unix-compatible, platforms.\nBecause of unusual changes required for the classic Mac OS environment, a special port called MacPerl was shipped independently.\nThe Comprehensive Perl Archive Network carries a complete list of supported platforms with links to the distributions available on each. CPAN is also the source for publicly available Perl modules that are not part of the core Perl distribution.\nActivePerl is a closed-source distribution from ActiveState that has regular releases that track the core Perl releases. The distribution previously included the Perl package manager (PPM), a popular tool for installing, removing, upgrading, and managing the use of common Perl modules; however, this tool was discontinued as of ActivePerl 5.28. Included also is PerlScript, a Windows Script Host (WSH) engine implementing the Perl language. Visual Perl is an ActiveState tool that adds Perl to the Visual Studio .NET development suite. A VBScript-to-Perl converter, a Perl compiler for Windows, and converters of AWK and sed to Perl have also been produced by this company and included on the \"ActiveState CD for Windows\", which includes all of their distributions plus the Komodo IDE and all but the first on the Unix\u2013Linux\u2013POSIX variant thereof in 2002 and afterward.\nPerformance.\nThe Computer Language Benchmarks Game compares the performance of implementations of typical programming problems in several programming languages. The submitted Perl implementations typically perform toward the high end of the memory-usage spectrum and give varied speed results. Perl's performance in the benchmarks game is typical for interpreted languages.\nLarge Perl programs start more slowly than similar programs in compiled languages because Perl has to compile the source every time it runs. In a talk at the YAPC::Europe 2005 conference and subsequent article \"A Timely Start\", Jean-Louis Leroy found that his Perl programs took much longer to run than expected because the perl interpreter spent significant time finding modules within his over-large include path. Unlike Java, Python, and Ruby, Perl has only experimental support for pre-compiling. Therefore, Perl programs pay this overhead penalty on every execution. The run phase of typical programs is long enough that amortized startup time is not substantial, but benchmarks that measure very short execution times are likely to be skewed due to this overhead.\nA number of tools have been introduced to improve this situation. The first such tool was Apache's mod_perl, which sought to address one of the most-common reasons that small Perl programs were invoked rapidly: CGI Web development. ActivePerl, via Microsoft ISAPI, provides similar performance improvements.\nOnce Perl code is compiled, there is additional overhead during the execution phase that typically isn't present for programs written in compiled languages such as C or C++. Examples of such overhead include bytecode interpretation, reference-counting memory management, and dynamic type-checking.\nThe most critical routines can be written in other languages (such as C), which can be connected to Perl via simple Inline modules or the more complex, but flexible, XS mechanism.\nApplications.\nPerl has many and varied applications, compounded by the availability of many standard and third-party modules.\nPerl has chiefly been used to write CGI scripts: large projects written in Perl include cPanel, Slash, Bugzilla, RT, TWiki, and Movable Type; high-traffic websites that use Perl extensively include Priceline.com, Craigslist, IMDb, LiveJournal, DuckDuckGo, Slashdot and Ticketmaster. \nIt is also an optional component of the popular LAMP technology stack for Web development, in lieu of PHP or Python. Perl is used extensively as a system programming language in the Debian Linux distribution.\nPerl is often used as a glue language, tying together systems and interfaces that were not specifically designed to interoperate, and for \"data munging\", that is, converting or processing large amounts of data for tasks such as creating reports. These strengths are linked intimately. The combination makes Perl a popular all-purpose language for system administrators, particularly because short programs, often called \"one-liner programs\", can be entered and run on a single command line.\nPerl code can be made portable across Windows and Unix; such code is often used by suppliers of software (both commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) and bespoke) to simplify packaging and maintenance of software build- and deployment-scripts.\nPerl/Tk and wxPerl are commonly used to add graphical user interfaces to Perl scripts.\nPerl's text-handling capabilities can be used for generating SQL queries; arrays, hashes, and automatic memory management make it easy to collect and process the returned data. For example, in Tim Bunce's Perl DBI application programming interface (API), the arguments to the API can be the text of SQL queries; thus it is possible to program in multiple languages at the same time (e.g., for generating a Web page using HTML, JavaScript, and SQL in a here document). The use of Perl variable interpolation to programmatically customize each of the SQL queries, and the specification of Perl arrays or hashes as the structures to programmatically hold the resulting data sets from each SQL query, allows a high-level mechanism for handling large amounts of data for post-processing by a Perl subprogram.\nIn early versions of Perl, database interfaces were created by relinking the interpreter with a client-side database library. This was sufficiently difficult that it was done for only a few of the most-important and most widely used databases, and it restricted the resulting codice_13 executable to using just one database interface at a time.\nIn Perl 5, database interfaces are implemented by Perl DBI modules. The DBI (Database Interface) module presents a single, database-independent interface to Perl applications, while the DBD (Database Driver) modules handle the details of accessing some 50 different databases; there are DBD drivers for most ANSI SQL databases.\nDBI provides caching for database handles and queries, which can greatly improve performance in long-lived execution environments such as mod_perl, helping high-volume systems avert load spikes as in the Slashdot effect.\nIn modern Perl applications, especially those written using web frameworks such as Catalyst, the DBI module is often used indirectly via object-relational mappers such as , Class::DBI or Rose::DB::Object that generate SQL queries and handle data transparently to the application author.\nCommunity.\nPerl's culture and community has developed alongside the language itself. Usenet was the first public venue in which Perl was introduced, but over the course of its evolution, Perl's community was shaped by the growth of broadening Internet-based services including the introduction of the World Wide Web. The community that surrounds Perl was, in fact, the topic of Wall's first \"State of the Onion\" talk.\nState of the Onion is the name for Wall's yearly keynote-style summaries on the progress of Perl and its community. They are characterized by his hallmark humor, employing references to Perl's culture, the wider hacker culture, Wall's linguistic background, sometimes his family life, and occasionally even his Christian background. Each talk is first given at various Perl conferences and is eventually also published online.\nIn email, Usenet, and message board postings, \"Just another Perl hacker\" (JAPH) programs are a common trend, originated by Randal L. Schwartz, one of the earliest professional Perl trainers. In the parlance of Perl culture, Perl programmers are known as Perl hackers, and from this derives the practice of writing short programs to print out the phrase \"Just another Perl hacker, [\"sic\"]\". In the spirit of the original concept, these programs are moderately obfuscated and short enough to fit into the signature of an email or Usenet message. The \"canonical\" JAPH as developed by Schwartz includes the comma at the end, although this is often omitted.\nPerl \"golf\" is the pastime of reducing the number of characters (key \"strokes\") used in a Perl program to the bare minimum, much in the same way that golf players seek to take as few shots as possible in a round. The phrase's first use emphasized the difference between pedestrian code meant to teach a newcomer and terse hacks likely to amuse experienced Perl programmers, an example of the latter being JAPHs that were already used in signatures in Usenet postings and elsewhere. Similar stunts had been an unnamed pastime in the language APL in previous decades. The use of Perl to write a program that performed RSA encryption prompted a widespread and practical interest in this pastime. In subsequent years, the term \"code golf\" has been applied to the pastime in other languages. A Perl Golf Apocalypse was held at Perl Conference 4.0 in Monterey, California in July 2000.\nAs with C, obfuscated code competitions were a well known pastime in the late 1990s. The Obfuscated Perl Contest was a competition held by The Perl Journal from 1996 to 2000 that made an arch virtue of Perl's syntactic flexibility. Awards were given for categories such as \"most powerful\"\u2014programs that made efficient use of space\u2014and \"best four-line signature\" for programs that fit into four lines of 76 characters in the style of a Usenet signature block.\nPerl poetry is the practice of writing poems that can be compiled as legal Perl code, for example the piece known as \"Black Perl\". Perl poetry is made possible by the large number of English words that are used in the Perl language. New poems are regularly submitted to the community at PerlMonks.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "23940", "revid": "12949512", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23940", "title": "Proto-Human language", "text": "Proposed common ancestor to all human languages\nThe Proto-Human language, also known as Proto-Sapiens, Proto-World, or the Urlanguage is the hypothetical direct genetic predecessor of all human languages. \nThe concept is speculative and not amenable to analysis in historical linguistics. It presupposes a \"monogenetic\" origin of language, that is, the derivation of all natural languages from a single origin, presumably at some time in the Middle Paleolithic period. As the predecessor of all \"extant\" languages spoken by modern humans (\"Homo sapiens\"), Proto-Human as hypothesized would not necessarily be ancestral to any hypothetical Neanderthal language.\nTerminology.\nThe concept has no generally accepted term. Most treatments of the subject do not include a name for the language under consideration (e.g., Bengtson and Ruhlen). The terms \"Proto-World\" and \"Proto-Human\" are in occasional use. Merritt Ruhlen used the term \"Proto-Sapiens\".\nHistory of the idea.\nThe first serious scientific attempt to establish the reality of monogenesis was that of Alfredo Trombetti, in his book \"L'unit\u00e0 d'origine del linguaggio\" (1905). Trombetti estimated that the common ancestor of existing languages had been spoken between 100,000 and 200,000 years ago (not long after the appearance of anatomically modern humans).\nMonogenesis was dismissed by many linguists in the late 19th and early 20th centuries when the doctrine of the polygenesis of the human races and their languages was popularized.\nThe best-known supporter of monogenesis in America in the mid-20th century was Morris Swadesh. He pioneered two important methods for investigating deep relationships between languages, lexicostatistics and glottochronology.\nIn the second half of the 20th century, Joseph Greenberg produced a series of large-scale classifications of the world's languages. These were and are controversial but widely discussed. Although Greenberg did not produce an explicit argument for monogenesis, all of his classification work was geared toward this end. As he stated: \"The ultimate goal is a comprehensive classification of what is very likely a single language family.\"\nNotable American advocates of linguistic monogenesis include Merritt Ruhlen, John Bengtson, and Harold Fleming.\nDate and location.\nThe first concrete attempt to estimate the date of the hypothetical ancestor language was that of Alfredo Trombetti, who concluded it was spoken between 100,000 and 200,000 years ago, or close to the first emergence of \"Homo sapiens\".\nIt is uncertain or disputed whether the earliest members of \"Homo sapiens\" had fully developed language. Some scholars link the emergence of language proper (out of a proto-linguistic stage that may have lasted considerably longer) to the development of behavioral modernity toward the end of the Middle Paleolithic or at the beginning of the Upper Paleolithic, roughly 50,000 years ago.\nThus, in the opinion of Richard Klein, the ability to produce complex speech only developed some 50,000 years ago (with the appearance of modern humans or Cro-Magnon).\nJohanna Nichols (1998) argued that vocal languages must have begun diversifying in our species at least 100,000 years ago.\nIn 2011, an article in the journal \"Science\" proposed an African origin of modern human languages. It was suggested that human language predates the out-of-Africa migrations of 50,000 to 70,000 years ago and that language might have been the essential cultural and cognitive innovation that facilitated human colonization of the globe.\nIn Perreault and Mathew (2012), an estimate of the time of the first emergence of human language was based on phonemic diversity. This is based on the assumption that phonemic diversity evolves much more slowly than grammar or vocabulary, slowly increasing over time (but reduced among small founding populations).\nThe largest phoneme inventories are found among African languages, while the smallest inventories are found in South America and Oceania, some of the last regions of the globe to be settled.\nThe authors used data from the colonization of Southeast Asia to estimate the rate of increase in phonemic diversity.\nApplying this rate to African languages, Perreault and Mathew (2012) arrived at an estimated age of 150,000 to 350,000 years, compatible with the emergence and early dispersal of \"H. sapiens\".\nThe validity of this approach has been criticized as flawed.\nClaimed characteristics.\nSpeculation on the \"characteristics\" of Proto-World is limited to linguistic typology, i.e. the identification of universal features shared by all human languages, such as grammar (in the sense of \"fixed or preferred sequences of linguistic elements\"), and recursion, but beyond this, nothing is known of it.\nChristopher Ehret has hypothesized that Proto-Human had a very complex consonant system, including clicks.\nA few linguists, such as Merritt Ruhlen, have suggested the application of mass comparison and internal reconstruction (cf. Babaev 2008). Several linguists have attempted to reconstruct the language, while many others reject this as fringe science.\nVocabulary.\nRuhlen tentatively traces several words back to the ancestral language, based on the occurrence of similar sound-and-meaning forms in languages across the globe. Bengtson and Ruhlen identify 27 \"global etymologies\". The following table lists a selection of these forms:\nBased on these correspondences, Ruhlen lists these roots for the ancestor language:\nSelected items from Bengtson's and Ruhlen's (1994) list of 27 \"global etymologies\":\nSyntax.\nThere are competing theories about the basic word order of the hypothesized Proto-Human. These usually assume subject-initial ordering because it is the most common globally. Derek Bickerton proposes SVO (subject-verb-object) because this word order (like its mirror OVS) helps differentiate between the subject and object in the absence of evolved case markers by separating them with the verb.\nBy contrast, Talmy Giv\u00f3n hypothesizes that Proto-Human had SOV (subject-object-verb), based on the observation that many old languages (e.g., Sanskrit and Latin) had dominant SOV, but the proportion of SVO has increased over time. On such a basis, it is suggested that human languages are shifting globally from the original SOV to the modern SVO. Giv\u00f3n bases his theory on the empirical claim that word-order change mostly results in SVO and never in SOV.\nExploring Giv\u00f3n's idea in their 2011 paper, Murray Gell-Mann and Merritt Ruhlen stated that shifts to SOV are also attested. However, when these are excluded, the data indeed supported Giv\u00f3n's claim. The authors justified the exclusion by pointing out that the shift to SOV is unexceptionally a matter of borrowing the order from a neighboring language. Moreover, they argued that, since many languages have already changed to SVO, a new trend towards VSO and VOS ordering has arisen. \nHarald Hammarstr\u00f6m reanalysed the data. In contrast to such claims, he found that a shift to SOV is in every case the most common type, suggesting that there is, rather, an unchanged universal tendency towards SOV regardless of the way that languages change and that the relative increase of SVO is a historical effect of European colonialism.\nCriticism.\nMany linguists reject the methods used to determine these forms. Several areas of criticism are raised with the methods Ruhlen and Gell-Mann employed. The essential basis of these criticisms is that the words being compared do not show common ancestry; the reasons for this vary. One is onomatopoeia: for example, the suggested root for \"smell\" listed above, *\"\u010duna\", may simply be a result of many languages employing an onomatopoeic word that sounds like sniffing, snuffling, or smelling. Another is the taboo quality of certain words. Lyle Campbell points out that many established proto-languages do not contain an equivalent word for *\"putV\" 'vulva' because of how often such taboo words are replaced in the lexicon, and notes that it \"strains credibility to imagine\" that a Proto-World form of such a word would survive in many languages.\nUsing the criteria that Bengtson and Ruhlen employ to find cognates to their proposed roots, Campbell found seven possible matches to their root for woman *\"kuna\" in Spanish, including \"c\u00f3nyuge\" 'wife, spouse', \"chica\" 'girl', and \"cana\" 'old (of a woman)' (adjective). He then goes on to show how what Bengtson and Ruhlen would identify as reflexes of *\"kuna\" cannot possibly be related to a Proto-World word for 'woman'. \"C\u00f3nyuge\", for example, comes from the Latin root meaning 'to join', so its origin had nothing to do with the word 'woman'; \"chica\" is related to a Latin word meaning 'insignificant thing'; \"cana\" comes from the Latin word for 'white', and again shows a history unrelated to the word for 'woman'. Campbell asserts that these types of problems are endemic to the methods used by Ruhlen and others.\nSome linguists question the very possibility of tracing language elements so far back into the past. Campbell notes that given the time elapsed since the origin of human language, every word from that time would have been replaced or changed beyond recognition in all languages today. Campbell harshly criticizes efforts to reconstruct a Proto-Human language, saying: \"the search for global etymologies is at best a hopeless waste of time, at worst an embarrassment to linguistics as a discipline, unfortunately confusing and misleading to those who might look to linguistics for understanding in this area\".\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

They are a religious minority within Palestine and Israel, as well as within the Palestinian diaspora. Applying the broader definition, which groups together individuals with full or partial Palestinian Christian ancestry, the term was applied to an estimated 500,000 people globally in the year 2000. As most Palestinians are Arabs, the overwhelming majority of Palestinian Christians also identify as Arab Christians.\nMost Palestinian Christians belong to one of a number of Christian denominations, including Eastern Orthodoxy, Oriental Orthodoxy, Catholicism (both the Latin Church and the Eastern Catholic Churches), Anglicanism, and Protestantism (such as Lutheranism), among others. In the 1990s, an estimate by Professor Bernard Sabella of Bethlehem University postulated that approximately 6.5% of the global Palestinian population was Christian, and that 56% of this figure was living outside of Palestine and Israel.\nAs of 2015[ [update]], Palestinian Christians comprise between 1% and 2.5% of the population of the West Bank, and about 3,000 (0.13%) of the population of the Gaza Strip. According to official British Mandate statistics, Christians accounted for 9.5% of the total population (and 10.8% of Palestine's Arabs) in 1922 and 7.9% of the total population in 1946. Over the course of the 1947\u20131949 Palestine war between the Palestinian Arabs and the Palestinian Jews, a large number of these Christians\u2014as part of the Arab community\u2014fled or were expelled by Jewish militias from what would become recognized as Israeli territory following the 1949 Armistice Agreements. Since the 1967 Arab\u2013Israeli War, which resulted in Israel's occupation of the Palestinian territories (the Jordanian-annexed West Bank and the Egyptian-occupied Gaza Strip), the Palestinian Christian population has increased as a whole, but has decreased as a percentage of the total Palestinian population.\nMany individuals of the Palestinian diaspora who identify as Christians are descendants of the post-1948 Palestinian Christian refugees who fled from the Arab\u2013Israeli conflict and settled in Christian-majority countries. \nEthnic identity.\nPalestinian Christians of different denominations are united by a common ethnic and Christian identity, as well as the experience of a connection to the birthplace of Christianity and a role in caring for its holy sites. Many Palestinian Christians are descended from early Christians, and they have sometimes called themselves \"living stones\". Although religion is perceived as a partly divisive factor, the common Palestinian and Arab identity of Palestinian Christians is also shared with Palestinian Muslims.\nThat Christian Arabs in Palestine see themselves as Arab reflects also the fact that, as of the beginning of the twentieth century, they shared many of the same customs as their Muslim neighbors. In some respects, this was a consequence of Christians adopting what were essentially Islamic practices, many of which were derived of \"shar\u00ee'ah\". In others, it was more the case that the customs shared by both Muslims and Christians derived from neither faith, but rather were a result of a process of syncretization, whereby what had once been pagan practices were later redefined as Christian and subsequently adopted by Muslims. This was especially evident in the fact that Palestine's Muslims and Christians shared many of the same feast days, in honor of the same saints, even if they referred to them by different names. \"Shrines dedicated to St. George, for instance, were transformed into shrines honoring Khidr-Ilyas, a conflation of the Prophet Elijah and the mythical sprite Khidr\". Added to this, many Muslims viewed local Christian churches as saints' shrines. Thus, for instance, \"Muslim women having difficulties conceiving, for instance, might travel to Bethlehem to pray for a child before the Virgin Mary\". It was even not uncommon for a Muslim to have his child baptized in a Christian church, in the name of Kha\u1e0dr.\nGeographic distribution.\nIn 2009, there were an estimated 50,000 Christians in the Palestinian territories, mostly in the West Bank, with about 3,000 in the Gaza Strip. In 2022, about 1,100 Christians lived in the Gaza Strip \u2013 down from over 1300 in 2014. About 80% of the Christian Palestinians live in an urban environment. In the West Bank, they are concentrated mostly in Jerusalem and its vicinity: Bethlehem, Beit Jala, Beit Sahour, Ramallah, Bir Zayt, Jifna, Ein Arik, Taybeh.\nOf the total Christian population of 185,000 in Israel, about 80% are designated as Arabs, many of whom self-identify as Palestinian.\nThe majority (56%) of Palestinian Christians live in the Palestinian diaspora.\nDemographics and denominations.\n1922 census.\nIn the 1922 census of Palestine there were approximately 73,000 Christian Palestinians: 46% Orthodox, 40% Catholic (20% Latin Catholic, and 20% Eastern Catholic).\nThe census recorded over 200 localities with a Christian population. The totals by denomination for all of Mandatory Palestine were: Greek Orthodox 33,369, Syriac Orthodox (Jacobite) 813, Latin Catholic 14,245, Greek Catholic (Melkite) 11,191, Syriac Catholic 323, Armenian Catholic 271, Maronite 2,382, Armenian Orthodox (Gregorian) 2,939, Coptic Church 297, Abyssinian Church 85, Church of England 4,553, Presbyterian Church 361, Protestants 826, Lutheran Church 437, Templars Community 724, others 208.\nThe census also listed 10,707 Palestinian Christians living abroad, making up the largest portion of the Palestinians living abroad at the time: 32 in Australia, 17 in Africa, 1 in Austria, 1 in Belgium, 1 in Bulgaria, 2 in Canada, 242 in Egypt, 34 in France, 59 in Germany, 1 in Greece, 7 in Italy, 4 in Morocco, 1 in Mesopotamia, 1 in Paraguay, 5 in Persia, 4 in Russia, 1 in South Africa, 11 in East Africa, 7 in Sudan, 6 in Sweden, 1 in Switzerland, 2 in Spain, 122 in Syria, 95 in Transjordan, 8,517 in South and Central American republics, 17 in Turkey, 6 in the United Kingdom, 1,352 in the United States, and 158 whose locations were unknown.\nDenominations.\nAround 50% of Palestinian Christians belong to the Greek Orthodox Church of Jerusalem, one of the 15 churches of Eastern Orthodoxy. There are also Catholics (Melkites, Latins, Maronites), Oriental Orthodox (Armenians, Jacobites, Copts), Protestants (Anglicans, Lutherans, others), and Jehovah's Witnesses.\nChurch leadership.\nPatriarch Theophilos III is the leader of the Greek Orthodox Church of Jerusalem since 2005. He replaced Irenaios (in office from 2001), who was deposed by the church synod after a term surrounded by controversy and scandal over a sale of property owned by the Greek Orthodox Church to Jewish investors. The Israel government initially refused to recognize Theophilos's appointment but finally granted full recognition in December 2007, despite a legal challenge by his predecessor Irenaios. Archbishop Theodosios (Hanna) of Sebastia the highest ranking Palestinian clergyman in the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem.\nThe Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem is the leader of the Latin Catholics in Jerusalem, Palestine, Jordan, Israel and Cyprus. The office has been held by Pierbattista Pizzaballa since his appointment by Pope Francis on 6 November 2020. George Bacouni, of the Melkite Greek Catholic Church, is Archbishop of Akka, with jurisdiction over Haifa, Acre and the Galilee, and replaced Elias Chacour, a Palestinian refugee, in 2014. Moussa El-Hage, of the Maronite Church, is since 2012 simultaneously Archbishop of the Archeparchy of Haifa and the Holy Land and Patriarchal Exarch of Jerusalem and Palestine.\nThe Anglican Bishop in Jerusalem is Suheil Dawani, who replaced Bishop Riah Abou Al Assal. Bishop Dr. Munib Younan is the president of the Lutheran World Federation and the Bishop of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Jordan and the Holy Land (ELCJHL).\nInternational Christian Organisations in Palestine.\nVarious international Christian organisations provide services in Palestine to Palestinians of all religious backgrounds.\nChristian development assistance.\nA study showed $416 million annual spending of Christian institutions on Palestinian society, in sectors such as health care, education, social services, vocational training and development assistance interventions in all Palestinian governorates.\nHistory.\nBackground and early history.\nThe first Christian communities in Roman Judea originated from the followers of Jesus of Nazareth, who was put to death and crucified by order of the Prefect Pontius Pilate in 30\u201333; they were Aramaic speaking Jewish Christian and, later, Latin and Greek-speaking Romans and Greeks, who were in part descendants from previous settlers of the regions, such as Syro-Phoenicians, Arameans, Greeks, Persians, and Arabs such as Nabataeans.\nContrary to other groups of oriental Christians such as the largely Assyrian Nestorians, the vast majority of Palestinian Christians went under the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the Ecumenical Patriarchate and Roman emperors after the Council of Chalcedon in 451\u00a0AD (which would be part of the Eastern Orthodox Church after the Great Schism), and were known by other Syrian Christians as Melkites (followers of the king). The Melkites were heavily Hellenised in the following centuries, abandoning their distinct Western Aramaic languages in favour of Greek. By the 7th century, Jerusalem, Gaza and Byzantine Palestine became the epicentre of Greek culture in the Orient.\nIn the fourth century, the monk Hilarion introduced monasticism in the area around Gaza which became a flourishing monastic center (including the Saint Hilarion Monastery and the monastery of Seridus), second only to the cluster of monasteries in the Judaean desert (which include the Mar Saba monastery).\nFollowing Muslim conquests, non-Arabic speaking Christians underwent a gradual process of Arabization in which they abandoned Aramaic and Greek in favor of Arabic. The Melkites began abandoning Greek for Arabic, a process which made them the most Arabicised Christians in the Levant. Most Arab Ghassanids remained Christian and joined Melkite and Syriac communities within what is now Jordan, Israel, Palestine, Syria, and Lebanon.\nThe eleventh century Melkite bishop of Gaza Sulayman al-Ghazzi holds a unique place in the history of Arab Christian literature as author of the first diwan of Christian religious poetry in Arabic. His poems give insights into the life of Palestinian Christians and the persecution they suffered under Fatimid caliph al-Hakim.\nIn the late sixteenth century, Christianity in southern Bilad ash-Sham was primarily rural, with a significant portion of the population living in villages and tribes. Christians were dispersed among numerous towns and villages in the vicinity of Jerusalem, some had been inhabited by Christians since Byzantine and Frankish rule. Villages with Christian population included Taybeh, Beit Rima, Jifna an-Nasara, Ramallah, Yabrud, Aboud, Suba, Tuqu, Nahalin, and Artas. The Christians living in these villages were mainly of Greek Orthodox denomination, although exceptions existed, such as the Syrian Christian community in Aboud.\nModern history.\nDuring the Ottoman Empire, foreign powers enjoyed positions of guardianship towards minorities, including the French for the Christians of Syria, Lebanon and Palestine. Orthodox Christians more specifically came under the protections of the Russian Empire. This placed Palestinian Christians with protection privileges, and access to missionary schools, which enabled them to engage in commerce with European traders. In addition, Christian merchants had lower rates of duty to pay than their Muslim counterparts, and thus they established themselves as bankers and moneylenders for Muslim landowners, artisans and peasants. This growing middle class produced several newspaper owners and editors and played leading roles in Palestinian political life.\nThe category of 'Palestinian Arab Christian' came to assume a political dimension in the 19th century as international interest grew and foreign institutions were developed there. The urban elite began to undertake the construction of a modern multi-religious Arab civil society. When the British received from the League of Nations a mandate to administer Palestine after World War I, many British dignitaries in London were surprised to discover so many Christian leaders in the Palestinian Arab political movements. The British authorities in the Mandate of Palestine had difficulty understanding the commitment of the Palestinian Christians to Palestinian nationalism.Palestinian Christian-owned \"Falastin\" was founded in 1911 in the then Arab-majority city of Jaffa. The newspaper is often described as one of the most influential newspapers in historic Palestine, and probably the nation's fiercest and most consistent critic of the Zionist movement. It helped shape Palestinian identity and nationalism and was shut down several times by the Ottoman and British authorities, most of the time due to complaints made by Zionists. Following the British takeover of Palestine in 1918 during the final stages of the First World War, groups called \"Muslim-Christian Associations\" were formed across the new Mandatory Palestine in order to oppose the Zionist movement and implementation of the Balfour Declaration. In the 1920s, it was noted that the inhabitants of Beit Kahil, Dayr Aban and Taffuh were originally Christian.\nThe 1948 Palestinian expulsion and flight\u2013 the foundational events of the Nakba\u2013 left the multi-denominational Christian Arab communities in disarray. They had little background in theology, their work being predominantly pastoral, and their immediate task was to assist the thousands of homeless refugees. But it also sowed the seeds for the development of a Liberation Theology among Palestinian Arab Christians.\nThere was a differential policy of expulsion. More lenience was applied to the Christians of the Galilee where expulsion mostly affected Muslims: at Tarshiha, Me'eliya, Dayr al-Qassi, and Salaban, Christians were allowed to remain while Muslims were driven out. At Iqrit and Bir'im the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) ordered Christians to evacuate for a brief spell, an order that was then confirmed as a permanent expulsion. Sometimes in a mixed Druze-Christian village like al-Rama, only the Christians were initially expelled towards Lebanon, but, thanks to the intervention of the local Druze, they were permitted to return. The IDF carried out massacres of Christians at the villages of Eilabun and Al-Bassa. Nazareth, at that time a town with a Christian majority, was spared devastation after agreeing to halt resistance and surrender, and because Israel did not want to visibly provoke an outcry in the Christian world. Important Christian figures were sometimes allowed to return, on condition they help Israel among their communities. Archbishop Hakim, with many hundreds of Christians, was allowed reentry on expressing a willingness to campaign against Communists in Israel and among his flock.\nAfter the war of 1948, the Christian population in the West Bank, under Jordanian control, dropped slightly, largely due to economic problems. This contrasts with the process occurring in Israel where Christians left \"en masse\" after 1948. Constituting 21% of Israel's Arab population in 1950, they now make up just 9% of that group. These trends accelerated after the 1967 war in the aftermath of Israel's takeover of the West Bank and Gaza.\nIn the Palestinian Authority (from 1994).\nChristians within the Palestinian Authority constituted around one in seventy-five residents. In 2009, Reuters reported that 47,000\u201350,000 Christians remained in the West Bank, with around 17,000 following the various Catholic traditions and most of the rest following the Orthodox church and other eastern denominations. Both Bethlehem and Nazareth, which were once overwhelmingly Christian, now have Muslim majorities. Today about three-quarters of all Bethlehem Christians live abroad, and more Jerusalem Christians live in Sydney, Australia, than in Jerusalem. Christians now comprise 2.5 percent of the population of Jerusalem. Those remaining include a few born in the Old City when Christians there constituted a majority.\nIn a 2007 letter from Congressman Henry Hyde to President George W. Bush, Hyde stated that \"the Christian community is being crushed in the mill of the bitter Israeli-Palestinian conflict\" and that expanding Jewish settlements in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, were \"irreversibly damaging the dwindling Christian community\".\nIn November 2009, Berlanty Azzam, a Palestinian Christian student from Gaza, was expelled from Bethlehem and was not allowed to continue her studying. She had two months left for the completion of her degree. Berlanty Azzam said the Israeli military handcuffed her, blindfolded her, and left her waiting for hours at a checkpoint on her way back from a job interview in Ramallah. She described the incident as \"frightening\" and claimed Israeli official treated her like a criminal and denied her an education because she is a Palestinian Christian from Gaza.\nIn Israel.\nIn July 2014, during operation Protective Edge an Israeli-Arab Christian demonstration was held in Haifa in a protest against Muslim extremism in the Middle East (concerning the rise of the Islamic State) and in support of Israel and the IDF.\nChristian Arabs are one of the most educated groups in Israel. Statistically, Christian Arabs in Israel have the highest rates of educational attainment among all religious communities, according to a data by Israel Central Bureau of Statistics in 2010, 63% of Israeli Christian Arabs have had college or postgraduate education, the highest of any religious and ethno-religious group. Despite the fact that Arab Christians only represent 2.1% of the total Israeli population, in 2014 they accounted for 17.0% of the country's university students, and for 14.4% of its college students. Christians are proportionally more likely to have attained a bachelor's or higher academic degrees than the Israeli national average. Christian Arabs additionally have one of the highest rates of success in the matriculation examinations, (73.9%) in 2017 both in comparison to the Muslims and the Druze and in comparison to all students in the Jewish education system as a group. Arab Christians were also the vanguard in terms of eligibility for higher education, and they have attained a bachelor's degree and academic degree more than the median Israeli population. Christians schools in Israel went on strike in 2015 at the beginning of the 2015 academic year in protest at budget cuts aimed at them. The strike affected 33,000 pupils, 40 percent of them Muslim. In 2013, Israel covered 65% of the budget of Palestinian Christian schools in Israel, a figure cut that year to 34%. Christians say they now received a third of what Jewish schools receive, with a shortfall of $53 million.\nThe rate of students studying in the field of medicine was also higher among the Christian Arab students, compared with all the students from other sectors. The percentage of Arab Christian women who are higher education students is higher than other sectors.\nIn September 2014, Israel's interior minister signed an order that the self-identified \"Aramean Christian\" minority in Israel could register as Arameans rather than Arabs. The order will affect about 200 families.\nThe first local woman cleric ordained in the Holy Land was Palestinian Sally Azar of the Lutheran church in 2023.\nGaza war (2023\u2013present).\nSince the start of the ongoing Gaza war in October 2023, there have been several incidents involving Palestinian Christians in the Gaza Strip, most notably the Church of Saint Porphyrius airstrike and the killing of two Catholic women by an Israeli sniper in the Holy Family Parish in northern Gaza.\nMeanwhile, in the West Bank, there is an ongoing struggle between the Christian Kisiya family and Israeli settlers attempting to confiscate their land in Beit Jala since July 2024. Another flashpoint was the June 2025 Israeli settler attack on the Christian village of Taybeh. In July 2025, Israeli forces once again targeted the Holy Family Church in Gaza City which resulted in two deaths.\nPolitical and ecumenical issues.\nThe mayors of Ramallah, Birzeit, Bethlehem, Zababdeh, Jifna, Ein 'Arik, Aboud, Taybeh, Beit Jala and Beit Sahour are Christians. The Governor of Tubas, Marwan Tubassi, is a Christian. The former Palestinian representative to the United States, Afif Saffieh, is a Christian, as is the ambassador of the Palestinian Authority in France, Hind Khoury. The Palestinian women's football team has a majority of Muslim girls, but the captain, Honey Thaljieh, is a Christian from Bethlehem. Many of the Palestinian officials such as ministers, advisers, ambassadors, consulates, heads of missions, PLC, PNA, PLO, Fateh leaders and others are Christians. Some Christians were part of the affluent segments of Palestinian society that left the country during the 1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War. In West Jerusalem, over 50% of Christian Palestinians lost their homes to the Israelis, according to the historian Sami Hadawi.\nInvolvement in Palestinian militancy.\nPalestinian Christians have played a role in the anti-Zionist movement and related political violence, both before and after the establishment of Israel in 1948.\nFour out of the 282 Palestinian Arab rebel leaders that participated in the 1936-1939 revolt in British Palestine were Christians. The rebels bore flags with a cross and crescent, symbolizing Christianity and Islam, respectively.\nThe Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) was founded in 1967 by George Habash, a Christian. Habash once stated that he believed there was perfect harmony between his Christian religion, his Arab nationalism, his Islamic culture, and his Marxist politics. Wadie Haddad, the leader of the military wing of the PFLP, was also Christian. Reportedly, Eastern Orthodox priests would bless PFLP hijacking teams before they set out on attacks.\nSirhan Sirhan, who assassinated Robert F. Kennedy in 1968, came from a Christian family and later changed church denominations several times, joining Baptist and Seventh-day Adventist churches. However, in 1966, he joined the esoteric organization Ancient Mystical Order of the Rose Cross, one of the Rosicrucian Orders.\nLuttif Afif, the commander of the Black September Organization (BSO) unit that carried out the 1972 Munich massacre, was reported to have at least a partial Christian background. He used the alias \"Jesus\", and named the Munich operation \"Iqrit and Biram\", after two Christian villages whose inhabitants were expelled by the IDF during the 1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War. Theresa Halaseh, another member of the BSO, was a Christian and also a Fatah member. She participated in the BSO hijacking of Sabena Flight 571, and was captured but later released in a 1983 prisoner exchange.\nDuring the Lebanese Civil War (1975\u20131990), the Palestinian National Salvation Front (PNSF), a Syrian proxy which opposed the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), had its headquarters in Mar Elias, a Palestinian Christian refugee camp.\nThere have been at least two known Christian militants from the Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades, Chris Bandak and Daniel Saba George, both from Bethlehem. Bandak was imprisoned by Israel for shooting at Israeli motorists during the Second Intifada, and at that time was described as the only Christian in the entire Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades. However, during a meeting with Bandak's family in 2009, Palestinian Authority official Issa Qaraqe hinted that there were other imprisoned Christian militants as well. Bandak was later released in 2011 as part of an exchange for the release of Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit. Daniel Saba George (\"Abu Hamama\"), who was also a senior Tanzim operative, was killed by Israel in 2006. An image was later taken of George's Christian funeral in Bethlehem, and a poster of him with Christian imagery was seen put up in the city that same year.\nArab Orthodox Movement.\nThe Arab Orthodox Movement is a political and social movement aiming for the Arabization of the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem, the church overseeing Orthodox communities in Palestine, Israel and Jordan; to which the majority of the Christian population there belongs to.\nWithin the context of rising Arab nationalism in the 19th century, the movement was inspired by the successful precedent of the Arabization of Syria and Lebanon's Antioch Patriarchate in 1899. The movement seeks the appointment of an Arab patriarch, Arab laity control over Jerusalem patriarchate's properties for social and educational purposes, and the use of Arabic as a liturgical language. Initially a church movement among Palestine and Transjordan's Orthodox Arab Christians in the late 19th century, it was later supported as a Palestinian and Arab nationalist cause and championed by some Arab Muslims, owing to the Greek-dominated patriarchate's early support to Zionism.\nThe Orthodox laity, which is mostly Arab, maintains that the patriarchate was forcibly Hellenized in 1543, while the Greek clergy says that the patriarchate was historically Greek. Opposition to the Greek clergy turned violent in the late 19th century, when they came under physical attack by the Arab laity in the streets. The movement was subsequently focused on holding Arab Orthodox conferences, the first of which was held in Jaffa in 1923, and most recently in Amman in 2014. One outcome of the 1923 conference was the laity's establishment of tens of Orthodox churches, clubs and schools in Palestine and Jordan over the decades. There were historically also several interventions to solve the conflict by the Ottoman, British (1920\u20131948), and Jordanian (1948\u20131967) authorities, owing to the patriarchate's headquarters being located in East Jerusalem.\nChristian converts from Islam.\nThough numbering only a few hundred, there is a community of Christians who have converted from Islam. They are not centered in one particular city and mostly belong to various evangelical and charismatic communities. These individuals tend to keep a low profile out of fear of persecution and intense stigma. The legality of conversion from Islam to Christianity under the Palestinian Authority is unclear.\nEcumenical Liberation Theology Center: Sabeel.\nThe Sabeel Ecumenical Liberation Theology Center is a Christian non-governmental organization based in Jerusalem; was founded in 1990 as an outgrowth of a conference regarding \"Palestinian Liberation Theology.\" According to its web site, \"Sabeel is an ecumenical grassroots liberation theology movement among Palestinian Christians. Inspired by the life and teaching of Jesus Christ, this liberation theology seeks to deepen the faith of Palestinian Christians, to promote unity among them toward social action. Sabeel strives to develop a spirituality based on love, justice, peace, nonviolence, liberation and reconciliation for the different national and faith communities. The word \"Sabeel\" is Arabic for 'the way' and also a 'channel' or 'spring' of life-giving water.\"\nSabeel has been criticized for its belief that \"Israel is solely culpable for the origin and continuation of the Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict,\" and for using \"anti-Semitic deicide imagery against Israel, and of disparaging Judaism as 'tribal,' 'primitive,' and 'exclusionary,' in contrast to Christianity\u2019s 'universalism' and 'inclusiveness.'\" In addition, Daniel Fink, writing on behalf of NGO Monitor, shows that Sabeel leader Naim Ateek has described Zionism as a \"step backward in the development of Judaism\", and Zionists as \"oppressors and war makers\".\n\"Kairos Palestine\" document (2009).\nIn December 2009, a number of prominent Palestinian Christian activists, both clergy and lay people, released the Kairos Palestine document, \"A moment of truth.\" Among the authors of the document are Michel Sabbah, former Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem, Archbishop Attalah Hanna, Father Jamal Khader, Rev. Mitri Raheb, Rev. Naim Ateek and Rifat Kassis who is the coordinator and chief spokesperson of the group.\nThe document declares the Israeli occupation of Palestine a \"sin against God\" and against humanity. It calls on churches and Christians all over the world to consider it and adopt it and to call for the boycott of Israel. Section\u00a07 calls for \"the beginning of a system of economic sanctions and boycott to be applied against Israel.\" It states that isolation of Israel will cause pressure on Israel to abolish all of what it labels as \"apartheid laws\" that discriminate against Palestinians and non-Jews.\nHoly Land Christian Ecumenical Foundation.\nThe Holy Land Christian Ecumenical Foundation (HCEF) was founded in 1999 by an ecumenical group of American Christians, including Rateb Y. Rabie, to preserve the Christian presence in the Holy Land. HCEF stated goal is to attempt to continue the presence and well-being of Arab Christians in the Holy Land and to develop the bonds of solidarity between them and Christians elsewhere. HCEF offers material assistance to Palestinian Christians and to churches in the area. HCEF advocates for solidarity on the part of Western Christians with Christians in the Holy Land.\nChristians of Gaza.\nIn 2022, there were approximately 1,100 Christians in the Gaza Strip, down from 1,300 in 2013, and from 5,000 in the mid-1990s. Gaza's Christian community mostly lives within the city, especially in areas neighbouring the three main churches: Church of Saint Porphyrius, The Holy Family Catholic Parish in Zeitoun Street, and the Gaza Baptist Church, in addition to an Anglican chapel in the Al-Ahli Al-Arabi Arab Evangelical Hospital. Saint Porphyrius is an Orthodox Church that dates back to the 12th century. Gaza Baptist Church is the city's only Evangelical Church; it lies close to the Legislative Council (parliamentary building). While some reports claim that Christians in Gaza freely practice their religion and may observe all the religious holidays in accordance with the Christian calendars followed by their churches, other reports claim forceful conversion to Islam, public insults, kidnapping, fear of radical Islamist groups, and vandalism.\nThose among them working as civil servants in the government and in the private sector are given an official holiday during the week, which some devote to communal prayer in churches. Christians are permitted to obtain any job, in addition to having their full rights and duties as their Muslim counterparts in accordance with the Palestinian Declaration of Independence, the regime, and all the systems prevailing over the territories. Moreover, seats have been allocated to Christian citizens in the Palestinian Legislative Council (PLC) in accordance with a quota system that allocates based on a significant Christian presence.\nA census revealed that 40 percent of the Christian community worked in the medical, educational, engineering and law sectors. Additionally, the churches in Gaza are renowned for the relief and educational services that they offer, and Muslim citizens participate in these services. Palestinian citizens as a whole benefit from these services. The Latin Patriarchate School, for example, offers relief in the form of medication and social and educational services. The school has been offering services for nearly 150 years.\nIn 1974, the idea of establishing a new school was proposed by Father Jalil Awad, a former parish priest in Gaza who recognized the need to expand the Latin Patriarchate School and build a new complex. In 2011, the Holy family school had 1,250 students and the Roman Catholic primary school, which is an extension of the Latin Patriarchate School, continues to enroll a rising number of young students. The primary school was established approximately 20 years ago. Aside from education, other services are offered to Muslims and Christians alike with no discrimination. Services include women's groups, students' groups and youth groups, such as those offered at the Baptist Church on weekdays. As of 2013, only 113 out of 968 of these Christian schools\u2019 students were in fact Christians.\nIn October 2007, Rami Ayyad, the Baptist manager of The Teacher's Bookshop, the only Christian bookstore in the Gaza Strip, was murdered, following the firebombing of his bookstore and the receipt of death threats from Muslim extremists.\nIn 2008, the gate of the Rosary Sisters School was blown up, and the library of a Christian organization for youth was blown up with the guard being kidnapped.\nFrom the 3,000 Christians in 2007 when Israel intensified its siege and drove them out of the poor area, estimates indicate that the number of Christians in Gaza has decreased since.\nWith a history stretching back to the first century, the 800\u20131,000 Christians who are thought to still be in Gaza represent the oldest Christian community in the world. At least eighteen people were killed when Israel bombed the Church of Saint Porphyrius, which is the oldest in Gaza, on 19 October 2023.\nChristian emigration.\nIn addition to neighboring countries, such as Lebanon and Jordan, many Palestinian Christians emigrated to countries in Latin America (notably Argentina and Chile), as well as to Australia, the United States and Canada. The Palestinian Authority is unable to keep exact tallies. The share of Christians in the population has also decreased due to the fact that Muslim Palestinians generally have much higher birth rates than the Christians.\nThe causes of this Christian exodus are hotly debated, with various possibilities put forth. Many of the Palestinian Christians in the diaspora are those who fled or were expelled during the 1948 war and their descendants. After discussion between Yosef Weitz and Moshe Sharett, Ben-Gurion authorized a project for the transference of the Christian communities of the Galilee to Argentina, but the proposal failed in the face of Christian opposition. Reuters has reported that the emigrants since then have left in pursuit of better living standards.\nThe BBC has also blamed the economic decline in the Palestinian Authority as well as pressure from the Israeli-Palestinian conflict for the exodus. A report on Bethlehem residents stated both Christians and Muslims wished to leave but the Christians possessed better contacts with people abroad and higher levels of education. The Vatican and the Catholic Church blamed the Israeli occupation and the conflict in the Holy Land for the Christian exodus from the Holy Land and the Middle East in general.\n\"The Jerusalem Post\" (an Israeli newspaper) has stated that the \"shrinking of the Palestinian Christian community in the Holy Land came as a direct result of its middle-class standards\" and that Muslim pressure has not played a major role according to Christian residents themselves. It reported that the Christians have a public image of elitism and of class privilege as well as of non-violence and of open personalities, which leaves them more vulnerable to criminals than Muslims. Hanna Siniora, a prominent Christian Palestinian human rights activist, has attributed harassment against Christians to \"little groups\" of \"hoodlums\" rather than to the Hamas and Fatah governments. In his last novel, the Palestinian Christian writer Emile Habibi has a character affirm that: \"There is no difference between Christian and Muslim: we are all Palestinian in our predicament.\"\nAccording to a report in \"The Independent\", thousands of Christian Palestinians \"emigrated to Latin America in the 1920s, when Mandatory Palestine was hit by drought and a severe economic depression.\"\nToday, Chile houses the largest Palestinian Christian community in the world outside of the Levant. As many as 350,000 Palestinian Christians reside in Chile, most of whom came from Beit Jala, Bethlehem, and Beit Sahur. Also, El Salvador, Honduras, Brazil, Colombia, Argentina, Venezuela, and other Latin American countries have significant Palestinian Christian communities, some of whom immigrated almost a century ago during the time of Ottoman Palestine.\nIn a 2006 poll of Christians in Bethlehem by the Palestinian Centre for Research and Cultural Dialogue, 90% reported having Muslim friends, 73% agreed that the Palestinian Authority treats Christian heritage in the city with respect, and 78% attributed the ongoing exodus of Christians from Bethlehem to the Israeli occupation and travel restrictions on the area. Daniel Rossing, the Israeli Ministry of Religious Affairs' chief liaison to Christians in the 1970s and 1980s, has stated that the situations for them in Gaza became much worse after the election of Hamas. He also stated that the Palestinian Authority, which counts on Christian westerners for financial support, treats the minority fairly. He blamed the Israeli West Bank barrier as the primary problem for the Christians.\nThe United States State Department's 2006 report on religious freedom criticized both Israel for its restrictions on travel to Christian holy sites and the Palestinian Authority for its failure to stamp out anti-Christian crime. It also reported that the former gives preferential treatment in basic civic services to Jews and the latter does so to Muslims. The report stated that, generally, ordinary Muslim and Christian citizens enjoy good relations in contrast to the \"strained\" Jewish and Arab relations. A 2005 BBC report also described Muslim and Christian relations as \"peaceful\".\nThe Arab Human Rights Association, an Arab NGO in Israel, has stated that Israeli authorities have denied Palestinian Christians in Israel access to holy places, prevented repairs needed to preserve historic holy sites, and carried out physical attacks on religious leaders.\nMultiple factors, the internal dislocation of Palestinians in wars; the creation of three contiguous refugee camps for those displaced; emigration of Muslims from Hebron; hindrances to development under Israeli military occupation with its land confiscations, and a lax and corrupt judicial system under the PNA that is often incapable of enforcing laws, have all contributed to Christian emigration, which has been a tradition since the British Mandate period. \nThis has been contested, as the main cause of Christian emigration from Bethlehem, Kairos Palestine\u2014an independent coalition Christian organisation, set up to help communicate to the Christian world what is happening in Palestine\u2014sent a letter to \"The Wall Street Journal\" to explain that \"In the case of Bethlehem, for instance, it is in fact the rampant construction of Israeli settlements, the chokehold imposed by the separation wall and the Israeli government's confiscation of Palestinian land that has driven many Christians to leave,\" the unprinted letter, quoted in \"Haaretz\", states. \"At present, a mere 13 percent of Bethlehem-area land is left to its Palestinian inhabitants\".\nMost of the Gaza Strip's Christian population lived in Gaza City, in the north. In 2023 the Israeli militarily attempted to force them out by the Israeli invasion of the Gaza Strip. As of October 2024, most of Gaza's Christians had refused to leave, our not felt safe to traverse the war zone. In November 2024, Israel announced that no Palestinians would be allowed to \"return\" to North Gaza.\nPersecutions.\nMajority of Palestinian Christians are leaving the territories due to the Arab-Israeli conflict. There have been reports of attacks on Palestinian Christians in Gaza from Muslim extremist groups. Gaza Pastor Manuel Musallam has voiced doubts that those attacks were religiously motivated.\nFr Pierbattista Pizzaballa, the Custodian of the Holy Land, a senior Catholic spokesman, has stated that police inaction and an educational culture that encourages Jewish children to treat Christians with \"contempt\" has made life increasingly \"intolerable\" for many Christians. Fr Pizzaballa's statement came after pro-settler extremists attacked a Trappist monastery in the town of Latroun, setting fire to its door, and covering walls with anti-Christian graffiti. The incident followed a series of acts of arson and vandalism, in 2012, targeting places of Christian worship, including Jerusalem's 11th century Monastery of the Cross, where slogans such as \"Death to Christians\" and other offensive graffiti were daubed on its walls. According to an article in the Telegraph, Christian leaders feel that the most important issue that Israel has failed to address is the practice of some ultra-Orthodox Jewish schools to teach children that it is a religious obligation to abuse anyone in Holy Orders they encounter in public, such that Ultra-Orthodox Jews, including children as young as eight, spit at members of the clergy on a daily basis.\nAfter Pope Benedict XVI's comments on Islam in September 2006, five churches of various denominations were firebombed and shot at in the West Bank and Gaza. A Muslim extremist group called \"Lions of Monotheism\" claimed responsibility. Former Palestinian Prime Minister and Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh condemned the attacks, and police presence was elevated in Bethlehem, which has a sizable Christian community.\nArmenians in Jerusalem, identified as Palestinian Christians or Israeli-Armenians, have also been attacked and received threats from Jewish extremists; Christians and clergy have been spat at, and one Armenian Archbishop was beaten and his centuries-old cross broken. In September 2009, two Armenian Christian clergy were expelled after a brawl erupted with a Jewish extremist for spitting on holy Christian objects.\nIn February 2009, a group of Christian activists within the West Bank wrote an open letter asking Pope Benedict XVI to postpone his scheduled trip to Israel unless the government changed its treatment. They highlighted improved access to places of worship and ending the taxation of church properties as key concerns. The Pope began his five-day visit to Israel and the Palestinian Authority on Sunday, 10 May, planning to express support for the region's Christians. In response to Palestinian public statements, Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Yigal Palmor criticized the political polarization of the papal visit, remarking that \"[i]t will serve the cause of peace much better if this visit is taken for what it is, a pilgrimage, a visit for the cause of peace and unity\".\nChristian families are the largest landowners in Bethlehem and have often been subject to theft of property. Bethlehem's core of traditional Christian and Muslim families speak of the rise of a 'foreign', more conservative, Islamic Hebronite class as changing the traditional regional identity of the town, as are the villages dominated by the Ta'amre Bedouin clans close to Bethlehem. Rising Muslim land purchase, said at times to be Saudi-financed, and incidents of land theft with forged documents, except in Beit Sahour where Christian and Muslims share a strong sense of local identity, are seen by Christians as making their demographic presence vulnerable. Christians are often described as of Yamani descent (as are some Muslim clans), vs the al-Qaysi Muslim clans, respectively from southern and northern Arabia. Christians are wary of the international media and of discussing these issues publicly, which involve criticism of fellow Palestinians, since there is a risk that their remarks may be manipulated by outsiders to undermine Palestinian claims to nationhood, distract attention from the crippling impact of Israel's occupation, and conjure up an image of a Muslim drive to oust Christians from Bethlehem.\nThe Christian Broadcasting Network (an American Protestant organization) claimed that Palestinian Christians suffer systematic discrimination and persecution at the hands of the predominantly Muslim population and Palestinian government aimed at driving their population out of their homeland. However, Palestinian Christians in Bethlehem and Beit Jala have claimed otherwise that it is the loss of agricultural land and expropriation from the Israeli military, the persecution of 1948 and violence from the military occupation that has led to a flight and major exodus of Christians.\nOn 26 September 2015, the Mar Charbel monastery in Bethlehem was set on fire, resulting in the burning of many rooms and damaging various parts of the building.\nIn September 2016, the Jerusalem-based Center for Jewish\u2013Christian Understanding and Cooperation (CJCUC) established Blessing Bethlehem, a charity fundraising initiative with the purpose of helping the persecuted Christians living in the city of Bethlehem and its surrounding areas.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was also erroneously called Pope Martin II () leading to the second pope named Martin to take the name Martin IV.\nEcclesiastical career.\nDiplomat to the East.\nBorn at Gallese, Marinus was the son of a priest. He would become an expert on relations with the Eastern church, starting this path when he assisted as subdeacon the welcome of ambassadors of emperor Michael III in 860. He was ordained as a deacon by Pope Nicholas I and then sent in 866 to Constantinople to discuss the religious leadership over the newly converted Bulgarians though the embassy was turned back at the Byzantine border. Marinus was sent again in 869 as one of pope Adrian II's legates who presided over the eighth ecumenical council in Constantinople which deposed the Patriarch Photios I of Constantinople. His profile became popular after and some time afterwards he became bishop of Caere, possibly to prevent that he could become archbishop of Bulgaria as one of king Boris' favourite candidates.\nOn three separate occasions, he had been employed by the three popes who preceded him as legate to Constantinople, his mission in each case having reference to the controversy started by Patriarch Photios I of Constantinople. In 882, he was sent on behalf of Pope John VIII to Duke Athanasius of Naples to warn him not to trade with the Muslims of southern Italy. During that time, he also served as treasurer to the Holy See.\nPapacy.\nMarinus I was elected to succeed John VIII as bishop of Rome from around the end of December 882. This papal election was controversial because Marinus had already been consecrated as bishop of Caere; at the time, a bishop was expected never to move to another see. Among his first acts as pope were the restitution of Formosus as cardinal bishop of Portus and the anathematizing of Photius I. Due to his respect for Alfred the Great (r. 871\u2013899), he freed the Anglo-Saxons of the \"Schola Anglorum\" in Rome from tribute and taxation. He also is recorded to have sent a piece of the True Cross to Alfred as a gift. He died in May 884 and was buried in St. Peter's basilica in Rome, his successor being Adrian III.\nName error.\nBecause of the similarity of the names, Marinus I and Marinus II were, in some sources, mistakenly called Martinus II and Martinus III.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He extended the appointment of Archbishop Frederick of Mainz as papal vicar and missus dominicus throughout Germany and Francia.

He succeeded Marcellinus after a considerable interval. Under Maxentius, he was banished from Rome in 309, on account of the tumult caused by the severity of the penances he had imposed on Christians who had lapsed under the recent persecution. He died the same year, being succeeded by Eusebius. His relics are under the altar of San Marcello al Corso in Rome. Since 1969 his feast day, traditionally kept on 16 January by the Catholic Church, is left to local calendars and is no longer inscribed in the General Roman Calendar.\nElection.\nFor some time after the death of Marcellinus in 304, the Diocletian persecution continued with unabated severity. After the abdication of Diocletian in 305, and the accession in Rome of Maxentius to the throne of the Caesars in October of the following year, the Christians of the capital again enjoyed comparative peace. Nevertheless, nearly two years passed before a new bishop of Rome was elected. Then in 308, according to the \"Catalogus Liberianus\", Marcellus first entered on his office: \"He was bishop in the time of Maxentius, from the 4th consulship of Maxentius when Maximus was his colleague, until after the consulship.\" At Rome, Marcellus found the church in the greatest confusion. The meeting-places and some of the burial-places of the faithful had been confiscated, and the ordinary life and activity of the church was interrupted. Added to this were the dissensions within the church itself, caused by the large number of weaker members who had fallen away during the long period of active persecution and later, under the leadership of an apostate, violently demanded that they should be readmitted to communion without doing penance.\nPontificate.\nAccording to the \"Liber Pontificalis\", Marcellus divided the territorial administration of the church into twenty-five districts (tituli), appointing over each a priest, who saw to the preparation of the catechumens for baptism and directed the performance of public penances. The priest was also made responsible for the burial of the dead and for the celebrations commemorating the deaths of the martyrs. The pope also had a new burial-place, the C\u0153meterium Novell\u0153 on the Via Salaria (opposite the Catacomb of St. Priscilla), laid out. The \"Liber Pontificalis\" says: \"He established a cemetery on the Via Salaria, and he appointed 25 \"title\" churches as jurisdictions within the city of Rome to provide baptism and penance for the many who were converted among the pagans and burial for the martyrs.\" At the beginning of the 7th century, there were probably twenty-five \"title\" churches in Rome; even granting that, perhaps, the compiler of the \"Liber Pontificalis\" referred this number to the time of Marcellus, there is still a clear historical tradition in support of his declaration that the ecclesiastical administration in Rome was reorganized by this pope after the great persecution.\nThe work of the pope was, however, quickly interrupted by the controversies to which the question of the readmittance of the lapsi into the church gave rise. The poetic tribute composed by Pope Damasus I in memory of his predecessor and placed over his grave (De Rossi, \"Inscr. christ. urbis Rom\u00e6\", II, 62, 103, 138; cf. Idem, \"Roma sotterranea\", II, 204\u20135) relates that Marcellus was looked upon as a wicked enemy by all the lapsed, because he insisted that they should perform the prescribed penance for their guilt. As a result, violent conflicts broke out; Maxentius, who had apostatized before the beginning of the persecution, had the pope seized and sent into exile. This took place at the end of 308 or the beginning of 309 according to the passages cited above from the \"Catalogus Liberianus\", which gives the length of the pontificate as no more than one year, six (or seven) months, and twenty days. Marcellus died shortly after leaving Rome, and was venerated as a saint.\nVeneration.\nHis feast day was 16 January, according to the \"Depositio episcoporum\" of the Chronography of 354 and every other Roman authority. Nevertheless, it is not known whether this is the date of his death or that of the burial of his remains, after these had been brought back from the unknown place to which he had been exiled. He was buried in the catacomb of St. Priscilla where his grave is mentioned by the itineraries to the graves of the Roman martyrs as existing in the basilica of St. Silvester (De Rossi, \"Roma sotterranea\", I, 176).\nA 5th-century \"Passio Marcelli\", which is included in the legendary account of the martyrdom of Cyriacus (cf. Acta Sanct., Jan., II, 10\u201314) and is followed by the \"Liber Pontificalis\", gives a different account of the end of Marcellus. According to this version, the pope was required by Maxentius, who was enraged at his reorganization of the church, to lay aside his episcopal dignity and make an offering to the gods. On his refusal, he was condemned to work as a slave at a station on the public highway (catabulum). At the end of nine months he was set free by the clergy; but a matron named Lucina having had her house on the Via Lata consecrated by him as \"titulus Marcelli\" he was again condemned to the work of attending to the horses brought into the station, in which menial occupation he died.\nAll this is probably legendary; the reference to the restoration of ecclesiastical activity by Marcellus alone has a historical basis. The tradition related in the verses of Damasus seems much more worthy of belief. The feast of Saint Marcellus, whose name is to this day borne by the church at Rome mentioned in the above legend, is still celebrated on 16 January. \nTheodor Mommsen theorizes that Marcellus was not really a bishop, but a simple Roman presbyter to whom was committed the ecclesiastical administration during the latter part of the period of vacancy of the papal chair. According to this view, 16 January was really the date of Marcellus' death, the next occupant of the chair being Eusebius (Neues Archiv, 1896, XXI, 350\u20133). The \"Catholic Encyclopedia\" dismisses this hypothesis as unsupported.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Before his accession as pope he had been Cardinal-Priest of \"Santa Croce in Gerusalemme\". He is the most recent pope to choose to retain his birth name as his regnal name upon his accession, and the most recent pope to date with the regnal name \"Marcellus\".\nMarcello Cervini's father, Ricardo Cervini, was a personal friend of Pope Clement VII. Cervini served in the household of Cardinal Alessandro Farnese. When Farnese became Pope Paul III, Cervini served as his secretary and was employed on a number of diplomatic missions. On 10 April, 1555, he was elected to succeed Pope Julius III. He died of a stroke twenty-two days later.\nEarly life.\nA native of Montefano, a small village near Macerata and Loreto he was the son of Ricardo Cervini who was the Apostolic Treasurer in Ancona. The family originated in Tuscany, in the town of Montepulciano, which had once been subject to Siena, but later was under the control of Florence. Marcello had two half-brothers, Alexander and Romulus.\nMarcello was educated locally, and at Siena and Florence, where he became proficient in writing Latin, Greek, and Italian. He also received instruction in jurisprudence, philosophy, and mathematics. His father had an interest in astrology and upon discovering that his son's horoscope presaged high ecclesiastical honours, Riccardo set the young Cervini on a path to the priesthood.\nPriesthood.\nAfter his period of study at Siena, Cervini traveled to Rome in the company of the delegation sent by Florence to congratulate the new Pope on his election. His father and Pope Clement VII were personal friends, and Marcello was made \"Scrittore Apostolico\". He was set to work on astronomical and calendar studies, a project which was intended to bring the year back into synchronization with the seasons. In 1527, he fled home after the Sack of Rome, but eventually returned and was taken into the household of Cardinal Alessandro Farnese \"senior\". Cervini was ordained a priest in 1535.\nCardinalate.\nIn 1534, after Farnese had become Pope Paul III, Cervini was appointed a papal secretary (1534\u201349) and served as a close advisor to the pope's nephew Alessandro Farnese. He was made a papal protonotary. He travelled in the suite of the Pope during the papal visit to Nice, where Paul III was promoting a truce between Francis I and Charles V. He then accompanied the young Cardinal Farnese on a journey to Spain, France and the Habsburg Netherlands to help implement the terms of the truce. Paul III later appointed him Bishop of Nicastro in 1539. Cervini was not, however, consecrated bishop until the day he himself was elected pope. On 19 December 1539, while Cervini was still on the embassy to the Netherlands, Paul III created him Cardinal-Priest of \"Santa Croce in Gerusalemme\".\nWhen, almost immediately afterwards, Cardinal Farnese was recalled to Rome, Cervini stayed on in Spain as nuncio. Over the course of the next decade Cervini also became the apostolic administrator of the dioceses of Reggio and Gubbio. His house in Rome became a center of Renaissance culture, and he himself corresponded with most of the leading humanists.\nDuring the Council of Trent he was elected one of the council's three presidents, along with fellow cardinals Reginald Pole and Giovanni Maria Ciocchi del Monte (the future Pope Julius III). He continued to serve in that role throughout the remainder of Paul III's papacy, after which he was replaced to placate the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V (1519\u201356). He was credited with defending not only orthodoxy and Church discipline, but also the universal claims of the Papacy in spiritual and temporal affairs, and with such vigor that the Emperor was affronted. In 1548 (or 1550) Cervini was placed in charge of the Vatican Library, with the title of \"Protettore della Biblioteca Apostolica\". The institutionalization of the printers of the Curia under Cervini is explored by Paolo Sachet in \"Publishing for the Popes: The Roman Curia and the Use of Printing (1527-1555)\". The Apostolic Brief of his appointment, however, came from the new pope, Julius III, on 24 May 1550, and in it he was named not Vatican Librarian, but \"Bibliothecarius Sanctae Romanae Ecclesiae\" because he was the first cardinal to be placed in charge of the library. During his administration, he employed the services of Guglielmo Sirleto, as well as Onofrio Panvinio (who was especially consulted in matters of Christian archaeology). He added more than 500 codices to the holdings of the Library, including 143 Greek codices, as his own entry book (which still survives as \"Vaticanus Latinus\" 3963) testifies.\nIn the conclave of 1549\u201350 held to elect a successor to Paul III, fifty-one cardinals, including Marcello Cervini, participated at the opening on 3 December 1549. The initial candidates included Cardinals Reginald Pole, Francesco Sfondrati, Rodolfo Pio da Carpi and Niccol\u00f2 Ridolfi (who died on the night of 31 January). Pole, the favorite of the Emperor Charles V, came within two votes of being elected in the first scrutinies, but he failed to attract any additional votes. Juan \u00c1lvarez de Toledo, Bishop of Burgos, another Imperial favorite, was proposed, and he too failed, because of strong opposition from the faction of Cardinal Alessandro Farnese, nephew of the late Pope Paul III and from the French.\nOn 12 December, five more French cardinals arrived, and though they could not advance the candidacy of their favorite, Ippolito d'Este, they did have Cardinal Cervini on their list of possible candidates. Farnese and his faction were also favorably disposed to him. Unfortunately, the Imperial faction was not. Worst of all, on 22 December, Cardinal Cervini left the Conclave, suffering from a quartan fever. Finally, on 7 February 1550, the cardinals chose Giovanni Maria Ciocchi del Monte, who took the name Julius III.\nPapal election.\nThe first conclave of 1555, following the death of Julius III (1550\u201355), involved a struggle between French interests in Italy (which had been favored by Julius III) and Imperial interests, which were intent on Church reform through a Church council, but with the Emperor controlling the outcome. On 9 April 1555, on the evening of the fourth day of the papal conclave, Cervini was \"adored\" as pope, despite efforts by cardinals loyal to Emperor Charles V to block his election. Next morning, a formal vote was taken in the Capella Paolina, in which all of the votes cast were for Cardinal Cervini except his own, which he cast for the Dean of the College of Cardinals, Giampietro Carafa.\nThe new pope chose to retain his birth name, the most recent pope to do so, reigning as Marcellus II. He was both consecrated as a bishop and crowned pope on the next day in a ceremony that was subdued on account of it falling during the Lenten season.\nPapacy.\nThough Marcellus II desired to reform many of the inner workings of the Church, his feeble constitution succumbed to the fatigues of the conclave, the exhausting ceremonies connected with his accession, the anxieties arising from his high office, and overexertion in his performance of the pontifical functions of the Holy Week and Easter. He quickly fell ill.\nHe was bled, and appeared to begin to recover. In an audience he gave to the cardinals, who wanted him to sign the Electoral Capitulations from the conclave and to guarantee that he would make no more cardinals than those agreements allowed, he refused to sign, stating that he would show his intent by deeds not words. In his first audience with the ambassadors of France and Spain, he warned the ambassadors that their monarchs should keep the peace that had been agreed upon, and that if they did not, not only would they be sent nuncios and legates, but that the pope himself would come and admonish them. He wrote letters to Emperor Charles V, to Queen Mary I of England, and to Cardinal Reginald Pole (in which he confirmed Pole as legate in England). When the Spanish ambassador asked for pardon for having killed a man, Marcellus replied that he did not want to start his reign with such auspices as absolution from homicide, and ordered the appropriate tribunals to observe the law.\nHe did not want his relatives descending on Rome, nor did he want them to be enriched beyond the station of a member of the nobility, and he did not allow his two nephews, Riccardo and Herennius (sons of his half-brother Alexander), who lived in Rome under his care, to have formal visits. He instituted immediate economies in the expenditure of the Holy See. On 28 April, he was able to receive Duke Guidobaldo II della Rovere of Urbino in audience, and on 29 April, Ercole II d'Este, duke of Ferrara. He also gave audience to four cardinals, Farnese, D'Este, Louis de Guise and Ascanio Sforza, the leaders of the French faction in the recent conclave. That night he had difficulty sleeping. On the morning of the 30th he suffered a stroke (\"hora XII apoplexi correptus\") and slipped into a coma. That night he died, on the 22nd day after his election.\nLegacy.\nPalestrina's \"Missa Papae Marcelli\" (dating from 1565 or before), one of the glories of polyphonic sacred choral music, is traditionally believed to have been composed in his memory, ca. 1562. Having reigned for just 22 calendar days, Pope Marcellus II ranks sixth on the list of 10 shortest-reigning popes. His successor was Giampietro Carafa, Dean of the Sacred College of Cardinals, who reigned as Pope Paul IV (1555\u201359).\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "23960", "revid": "40609524", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23960", "title": "Pope Miltiades", "text": "Head of the Catholic Church from 311 to 314\nPope Miltiades (, \"Milti\u00e1d\u0113s\"), also known as Melchiades the African ( \"Melkhi\u00e1d\u0113s ho Aphrikan\u00f3s\"), was the bishop of Rome from 311 to his death on 10 or 11 January 314. It was during his pontificate that Emperor Constantine the Great issued the Edict of Milan (313), giving Christianity legal status within the Roman Empire. The pope also received the palace of Empress Fausta where the Lateran Palace, the papal seat and residence of the papal administration, would be built. At the Lateran Council, during the schism with the Church of Carthage, Miltiades condemned the rebaptism of apostatised bishops and priests, a teaching of Donatus Magnus.\nBackground.\nThe year of Miltiades' birth is unknown. Still, it is known that he was of North African descent and, according to the \"Liber Pontificalis\", compiled from the 5th century onwards, a Roman citizen. Miltiades and his successor, Sylvester I, were part of the clergy of Pope Marcellinus. It has been suggested that he was party to the alleged apostasy of Pope Marcellinus, which was repudiated by Augustine of Hippo. This view originated from letters, dated to between 400 and 410, written by Donatist Bishop Petilianus of Constantine, who claimed that Marcellinus, along with Miltiades and Sylvester, surrendered sacred texts and offered incense to Roman deities.\nPontificate.\nIn April 311, the Edict of Toleration was issued in Serdica (modern-day Sofia, Bulgaria) by the Roman emperor Galerius, officially ending the Diocletianic Persecution of Christianity in the Eastern part of the Empire.\nThe election of Miltiades to the papacy on 2 July 311, according to the Liberian Catalogue, marked the end of a \"sede vacante\", the vacancy of the papacy, following the death of Pope Eusebius on 17 August 310 or 309 according to \"Liber Pontificalis\" not long after his exile to Sicily by the Emperor Maxentius. After his election, Church property that was confiscated during the Diocletianic Persecution was restored by Maxentius. This order, however, probably did not extend to all of the parts of Maxentius' jurisdiction.\nThe \"Liber Pontificalis\", attributed the introduction of several later customs to Miltiades, such as not fasting on Thursdays or Sundays. However, subsequent scholarship now believes the customs likely pre-dated Miltiades. Miltades prescribed the distribution of portions of the bread consecrated by the pope at all of the churches around Rome, the fermentum, as a sign of unity.\nIn October 312, Constantine defeated Maxentius at the Battle of the Milvian Bridge to become emperor. He later presented the pope with the palace of Empress Fausta, where the Lateran Palace, the papal residence and seat of central Church administration, would be built.\nBeing the first pope under Constantine, his pontificate coincided with Constantine's peace to the Church. In February 313, Constantine and Licinius, emperor of the eastern part of the Roman Empire, agreed to extend tolerance of Christianity to Licinius' territory, proclaimed by the Edict of Milan. Consequently, Christians not only attained the freedom of worship but also restored all places of Christian worship and returned all confiscated property.\nLateran Council.\nDuring Miltiades' tenure as pontiff, a schism over the election of Bishop Caecilianus split the Church of Carthage. The opposing parties were those of Caecilianus, who was supported by Rome, and of Donatus, mainly clergymen from North Africa who demanded that schismatics and heretics be re-baptised and re-ordained before taking office, the central issue dividing Donatists and Catholics. The supporters of Donatus appealed to Constantine and requested that judges from Gaul be assigned to adjudicate. Constantine agreed and commissioned Miltiades with three Gallic bishops to resolve the dispute, the first time an emperor interfered in church affairs. Miltiades, unwilling to jeopardise his relationship with the Emperor but also unwilling to preside over a council with an uncertain outcome, changed the proceedings into a regular church synod and appointed an additional 15 Italian bishops.\nThe Lateran Council was held three days from 2\u20134 October 313. The process was modelled on Roman civil proceedings, with Miltiades insisting on strict rules of evidence and argument. This frustrated the Donatists, who left the council without presenting their case, which led Miltiades to rule in favour of Caecilianus by default. The council thus ended after only three sessions. The pope retained Caecilianus as bishop of Carthage and condemned Donatus' teachings of rebaptism of bishops and priests. The adverse rulings failed to stop the continuing spread of Donatism across North Africa.\nThe Donatists again appealed to the Emperor, who responded by convening the Council of Arles in 314, but it ruled against the Donatists too. By the time the council was convened, Miltiades had died on 10 or 11 January 314. He was succeeded by Sylvester I. He was buried in the Catacomb of Callixtus at the Appian Way and venerated as a saint. Licinius, who promulgated the Edict of Milan, violated the edict in 320 by persecuting Christians, sacking them from public offices, forbidding synods and condoning executions. A civil war broke out between him and Constantine, with Constantine eventually defeating him in 324.\nVeneration.\nThe feast of Miltiades in the 4th century, according to the \"Martyrologium Hieronymianum\", was celebrated on 10 January. In the 13th century, the feast of Saint Melchiades (as he was then called) was included, with the mistaken qualification of \"martyr\", in the General Roman Calendar for celebration on 10 December. In 1969, the celebration was removed from that calendar of obligatory liturgical celebrations, and moved to the day of his death, 10 January, with his name given in the form \"Miltiades\" but without the indication \"martyr\".\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It infers the relationship among organisms based on empirical data and observed heritable traits of DNA sequences, protein amino acid sequences, and morphology. The results are a phylogenetic tree\u2014a diagram depicting the hypothetical relationships among the organisms, reflecting their inferred evolutionary history.\nThe tips of a phylogenetic tree represent the observed entities, which can be living taxa or fossils. A phylogenetic diagram can be rooted or unrooted. A rooted tree diagram indicates the hypothetical common ancestor of the taxa represented on the tree. An unrooted tree diagram (a network) makes no assumption about directionality of character state transformation, and does not show the origin or \"root\" of the taxa in question.\nIn addition to their use for inferring phylogenetic patterns among taxa, phylogenetic analyses are often employed to represent relationships among genes or individual organisms. Such uses have become central to understanding biodiversity, evolution, ecology, and genomes.\nPhylogenetics is a component of systematics that uses similarities and differences of the characteristics of species to interpret their evolutionary relationships and origins.\nIn the field of cancer research, phylogenetics can be used to study the clonal evolution of tumors and molecular chronology, predicting and showing how cell populations vary throughout the progression of the disease and during treatment, using whole genome sequencing techniques. Because cancer cells reproduce mitotically, the evolutionary processes behind cancer progression are quite different from those in sexually-reproducing species. These differences manifest in several areas: the types of aberrations that occur, the rates of mutation, the high heterogeneity (variability) of tumor cell subclones, and the absence of genetic recombination.\nPhylogenetics can also aid in drug design and discovery. Phylogenetics allows scientists to organize species and can show which species are likely to have inherited particular traits that are medically useful, such as producing biologically active compounds - those that have effects on the human body. For example, in drug discovery, venom-producing animals are particularly useful. Venoms from these animals produce several important drugs, e.g., ACE inhibitors and Prialt (Ziconotide). To find new venoms, scientists turn to phylogenetics to screen for closely related species that may have the same useful traits. The phylogenetic tree shows venomous species of fish, and related fish they may also contain the trait. Using this approach, biologists are able to identify the fish, snake and lizard species that may be venomous.\nIn forensic science, phylogenetic tools are useful to assess DNA evidence for court cases. Phylogenetic analysis has been used in criminal trials to exonerate or hold individuals. \nHIV forensics uses phylogenetic analysis to track the differences in HIV genes and determine the relatedness of two samples. HIV forensics have limitations, i.e., it cannot be the sole proof of transmission between individuals, and phylogenetic analysis which shows transmission relatedness does not indicate direction of transmission.\nTaxonomy and classification.\nTaxonomy is the identification, naming, and classification of organisms. The Linnaean classification system developed in the 1700s by Carolus Linnaeus is the foundation for modern classification methods. Linnaean classification traditionally relied on the phenotypes or physical characteristics of organisms to group species. With the emergence of biochemistry, classifications of organisms are now often based on DNA sequence data or a combination of DNA and morphology. Many systematists contend that only monophyletic taxa should be recognized as named groups. The degree to which classification depends on inferred evolutionary history differs depending on the school of taxonomy: phenetics ignores phylogenetic speculation altogether, trying to represent the similarity between organisms instead; cladistics (phylogenetic systematics) tries to reflect phylogeny in its classifications by only recognizing groups based on shared, derived characters (synapomorphies); evolutionary taxonomy tries to take into account both the branching pattern and \"degree of difference\" to find a compromise between inferred patterns of common ancestry and evolutionary distinctness.\nInference of a phylogenetic tree.\nUsual methods of phylogenetic inference involve computational approaches implementing an optimality criterion and methods of parsimony, maximum likelihood (ML), and MCMC-based Bayesian inference. All these depend upon an implicit or explicit mathematical model describing the relative probabilities of character state transformation within and among the characters observed.\nPhenetics, popular in the mid-20th century but now largely obsolete, used distance matrix-based methods to construct trees based on overall similarity in morphology or similar observable traits, which was often assumed to approximate phylogenetic relationships. Neighbor Joining is a phenetic method that is often used for building similarity trees for DNA barcodes.\nPrior to 1950, phylogenetic inferences were generally presented as narrative scenarios. Such methods were often ambiguous and lacked explicit criteria for evaluating alternative hypotheses.\nImpacts of taxon sampling.\nIn phylogenetic analysis, taxon sampling selects a small group of exemplar taxa to infer the evolutionary history of a clade. This process is also known as stratified sampling or clade-based sampling. Judicious taxon sampling is important, given limited resources to compare and analyze every species within a diverse clade, and also given the computational limits of phylogenetic software. Poor taxon sampling may result in incorrect phylogenetic inferences. Long branch attraction, in which nonrelated branches are incorrectly grouped by shared, homoplastic nucleotide sites, is a theoretical cause for inaccuracy \nThere are debates if increasing the number of taxa sampled improves phylogenetic accuracy more than increasing the number of genes sampled per taxon. Differences in each method's sampling impact the number of nucleotide sites utilized in a sequence alignment, which may contribute to disagreements. For example, phylogenetic trees constructed utilizing a more significant number of total nucleotides are generally more accurate, as supported by phylogenetic trees' bootstrapping replicability from random sampling.\nThe graphic presented in \"Taxon Sampling, Bioinformatics, and Phylogenomics\", compares the correctness of phylogenetic trees generated using fewer taxa and more sites per taxon on the x-axis to more taxa and fewer sites per taxon on the y-axis. With fewer taxa, more genes are sampled amongst the taxonomic group; in comparison, with more taxa added to the taxonomic sampling group, fewer genes are sampled. Each method has the same total number of nucleotide sites sampled. Furthermore, the dotted line represents a 1:1 accuracy between the two sampling methods. As seen in the graphic, most of the plotted points are located below the dotted line, which indicates gravitation toward increased accuracy when sampling fewer taxa with more sites per taxon. The research performed utilizes four different phylogenetic tree construction models to verify the theory; neighbor-joining (NJ), minimum evolution (ME), unweighted maximum parsimony (MP), and maximum likelihood (ML). In the majority of models, sampling fewer taxon with more sites per taxon demonstrated higher accuracy.\nGenerally, with the alignment of a relatively equal number of total nucleotide sites, sampling more genes per taxon has higher bootstrapping replicability than sampling more taxa. However, unbalanced datasets within genomic databases make increasing the gene comparison per taxon in uncommonly sampled organisms increasingly difficult.\nHistory.\nOverview.\nThe term \"phylogeny\" derives from the German , introduced by Haeckel in 1866, and the Darwinian approach to classification became known as the \"phyletic\" approach. It can be traced back to Aristotle, who wrote in his \"Posterior Analytics\", \"We may assume the superiority ceteris paribus [other things being equal] of the demonstration which derives from fewer postulates or hypotheses.\"\nErnst Haeckel's recapitulation theory.\nThe modern concept of phylogenetics evolved primarily as a disproof of a previously widely accepted theory. During the late 19th century, Ernst Haeckel's recapitulation theory, or \"biogenetic fundamental law\", was widely popular. It was often expressed as \"ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny\", i.e. the development of a single organism during its lifetime, from germ to adult, successively mirrors the adult stages of successive ancestors of the species to which it belongs. But this theory has long been rejected. Instead, ontogeny evolves\u00a0\u2013 the phylogenetic history of a species cannot be read directly from its ontogeny, as Haeckel thought would be possible, but characters from ontogeny can be (and have been) used as data for phylogenetic analyses; the more closely related two species are, the more apomorphies their embryos share.\nUses of phylogenetic analysis.\nPharmacology.\nOne use of phylogenetic analysis involves the pharmacological examination of closely related groups of organisms. Advances in cladistics analysis through faster computer programs and improved molecular techniques have increased the precision of phylogenetic determination, allowing for the identification of species with pharmacological potential.\nHistorically, phylogenetic screens for pharmacological purposes were used in a basic manner, such as studying the Apocynaceae family of plants, which includes alkaloid-producing species like Catharanthus, known for producing vincristine, an antileukemia drug. Modern techniques now enable researchers to study close relatives of a species to uncover either a higher abundance of important bioactive compounds (e.g., species of Taxus for taxol) or natural variants of known pharmaceuticals (e.g., species of \"Catharanthus\" for different forms of vincristine or vinblastine).\nBiodiversity.\nPhylogenetic analysis has also been applied to biodiversity studies within the fungi family. Phylogenetic analysis helps understand the evolutionary history of various groups of organisms, identify relationships between different species, and predict future evolutionary changes. Emerging imagery systems and new analysis techniques allow for the discovery of more genetic relationships in biodiverse fields, which can aid in conservation efforts by identifying rare species that could benefit ecosystems globally.\nInfectious disease epidemiology.\nWhole-genome sequence data from outbreaks or epidemics of infectious diseases can provide important insights into transmission dynamics and inform public health strategies. Traditionally, studies have combined genomic and epidemiological data to reconstruct transmission events. However, recent research has explored deducing transmission patterns solely from genomic data using phylodynamics, which involves analyzing the properties of pathogen phylogenies. Phylodynamics uses theoretical models to compare predicted branch lengths with actual branch lengths in phylogenies to infer transmission patterns. Additionally, coalescent theory, which describes probability distributions on trees based on population size, has been adapted for epidemiological purposes. Another source of information within phylogenies that has been explored is \"tree shape.\" These approaches, while computationally intensive, have the potential to provide valuable insights into pathogen transmission dynamics.\nThe structure of the host contact network significantly impacts the dynamics of outbreaks, and management strategies rely on understanding these transmission patterns. Pathogen genomes spreading through different contact network structures, such as chains, homogeneous networks, or networks with super-spreaders, accumulate mutations in distinct patterns, resulting in noticeable differences in the shape of phylogenetic trees, as illustrated in Fig. 1. Researchers have analyzed the structural characteristics of phylogenetic trees generated from simulated bacterial genome evolution across multiple types of contact networks. By examining simple topological properties of these trees, researchers can classify them into chain-like, homogeneous, or super-spreading dynamics, revealing transmission patterns. These properties form the basis of a computational classifier used to analyze real-world outbreaks. Computational predictions of transmission dynamics for each outbreak often align with known epidemiological data.\nDifferent transmission networks result in quantitatively different tree shapes. To determine whether tree shapes captured information about underlying disease transmission patterns, researchers simulated the evolution of a bacterial genome over three types of outbreak contact networks\u2014homogeneous, super-spreading, and chain-like. They summarized the resulting phylogenies with five metrics describing tree shape. Figures 2 and 3 illustrate the distributions of these metrics across the three types of outbreaks, revealing clear differences in tree topology depending on the underlying host contact network.\nSuper-spreader networks give rise to phylogenies with higher Colless imbalance, longer ladder patterns, lower \u0394w, and deeper trees than those from homogeneous contact networks. Trees from chain-like networks are less variable, deeper, more imbalanced, and narrower than those from other networks.\nScatter plots can be used to visualize the relationship between two variables in pathogen transmission analysis, such as the number of infected individuals and the time since infection. These plots can help identify trends and patterns, such as whether the spread of the pathogen is increasing or decreasing over time, and can highlight potential transmission routes or super-spreader events. Box plots displaying the range, median, quartiles, and potential outliers datasets can also be valuable for analyzing pathogen transmission data, helping to identify important features in the data distribution. They may be used to quickly identify differences or similarities in the transmission data.\nDisciplines other than biology.\nPhylogenetic tools and representations (trees and networks) can also be applied to philology, the study of the evolution of oral languages and written text and manuscripts, such as in the field of quantitative comparative linguistics.\nComputational phylogenetics can be used to investigate a language as an evolutionary system. The evolution of human language closely corresponds with human's biological evolution which allows phylogenetic methods to be applied. The concept of a \"tree\" serves as an efficient way to represent relationships between languages and language splits. It also serves as a way of testing hypotheses about the connections and ages of language families. For example, relationships among languages can be shown by using cognates as characters. The phylogenetic tree of Indo-European languages shows the relationships between several of the languages in a timeline, as well as the similarity between words and word order.\nThere are three types of criticisms about using phylogenetics in philology, the first arguing that languages and species are different entities, therefore you can not use the same methods to study both. The second being how phylogenetic methods are being applied to linguistic data. And the third, discusses the types of data that is being used to construct the trees.\nBayesian phylogenetic methods, which are sensitive to how treelike the data is, allow for the reconstruction of relationships among languages, locally and globally. The main two reasons for the use of Bayesian phylogenetics are that (1) diverse scenarios can be included in calculations and (2) the output is a sample of trees and not a single tree with true claim.\nThe same process can be applied to texts and manuscripts. In Paleography, the study of historical writings and manuscripts, texts were replicated by scribes who copied from their source and alterations - i.e., 'mutations' - occurred when the scribe did not precisely copy the source.\nPhylogenetics has been applied to archaeological artefacts such as the early hominin hand-axes, late Palaeolithic figurines, Neolithic stone arrowheads, Bronze Age ceramics, and historical-period houses. Bayesian methods have also been employed by archaeologists in an attempt to quantify uncertainty in the tree topology and divergence times of stone projectile point shapes in the European Final Palaeolithic and earliest Mesolithic.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is related closely to numerical taxonomy which is concerned with the use of numerical methods for taxonomic classification. Many people contributed to the development of phenetics, but the most influential were Peter Sneath and Robert R. Sokal. Their books are still primary references for this sub-discipline, although now out of print.\nPhenetics has been largely superseded by cladistics for research into evolutionary relationships among species. However, certain phenetic methods, such as neighbor-joining, are used for phylogenetics, as a reasonable approximation of phylogeny when more advanced methods (such as Bayesian inference) are too expensive computationally.\nPhenetic techniques include various forms of clustering and ordination. These are sophisticated methods of reducing the variation displayed by organisms to a manageable degree. In practice this means measuring dozens of variables, and then presenting them as two- or three-dimensional graphs. Much of the technical challenge of phenetics concerns balancing the loss of information due to such a reduction against the ease of interpreting the resulting graphs.\nThe method can be traced back to 1763 and Michel Adanson (in his \"Familles des plantes\") because of two shared basic principles \u2013 overall similarity and equal weighting \u2013 and modern pheneticists are sometimes termed \"neo-Adansonian\"s.\nDifference from cladistics.\nPhenetic analyses are \"unrooted\", that is, they do not distinguish between plesiomorphies, traits that are inherited from an ancestor, and apomorphies, traits that evolved anew in one or several lineages. A common problem with phenetic analysis is that basal evolutionary grades, which retain many plesiomorphies compared to more advanced lineages, seem to be monophyletic. Phenetic analyses are also liable to be rendered inaccurate by convergent evolution and adaptive radiation. Cladistic methods attempt to solve those problems.\nConsider for example songbirds. These can be divided into two groups \u2013 Corvida, which retains ancient characteristics of phenotype and genotype, and Passerida, which has more modern traits. But only the latter are a group of closest relatives; the former are numerous independent and ancient lineages which are related about as distantly to each other as each single one of them is to the Passerida. For a phenetic analysis, the large degree of overall similarity found among the Corvida will make them seem to be monophyletic too, but their shared traits were present in the ancestors of \"all\" songbirds already. It is the loss of these ancestral traits rather than their presence that signifies which songbirds are more closely related to each other than to other songbirds. However, the requirement that taxa be monophyletic \u2013 rather than paraphyletic as for the case of the Corvida \u2013 is itself part of the cladistic method of taxonomy, not necessarily obeyed absolutely by other methods.\nThe two methods are not mutually exclusive. There is no reason why, e.g., species identified using phenetics cannot subsequently be subjected to cladistic analysis, to determine their evolutionary relationships. Phenetic methods can also be superior to cladistics when only the \"distinctness\" of related taxa is important, as the computational requirements are less.\nThe history of pheneticism and cladism as rival taxonomic systems is analysed in David Hull's 1988 book \"Science as a Process\".\nCurrent usage.\nTraditionally there was much debate between pheneticists and cladists, as both methods were proposed initially to resolve evolutionary relationships. One of the most noteworthy applications of phenetics were the DNA\u2013DNA hybridization studies by Charles G. Sibley, Jon E. Ahlquist and Burt L. Monroe Jr., from which resulted the 1990 Sibley-Ahlquist taxonomy for birds. Controversial at its time, some of its findings (e.g. the Galloanserae) have been vindicated, while others (e.g. the all-inclusive \"Ciconiiformes\" or the \"Corvida\") have been rejected. However, with computers growing increasingly powerful and widespread, more refined cladistic algorithms became available which could test the suggestions of Willi Hennig. The results of cladistic analyses were proven superior to those of phenetic methods, at least for resolving phylogenies.\nMany systematists continue to use phenetic methods, particularly to address species-level questions. While a major goal of taxonomy remains describing the 'tree of life' \u2013 the evolutionary relationships of all species \u2013 for fieldwork one needs to be able to separate one taxon from another. Classifying diverse groups of closely related organisms that differ very subtly is difficult using a cladistic method. Phenetics provides numerical methods for examining patterns of variation, allowing researchers to identify discrete groups that can be classified as species.\nModern applications of phenetics are common for botany, and some examples can be found in most issues of the journal \"Systematic Botany\". Indeed, due to the effects of horizontal gene transfer, polyploid complexes and other peculiarities of plant genomics, phenetic techniques of botany \u2013 though less informative altogether \u2013 may, for these special cases, be less prone to errors compared with cladistic analysis of DNA sequences.\nIn addition, many of the techniques developed by phenetic taxonomists have been adopted and extended by community ecologists, due to a similar need to deal with large amounts of data.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was released in Japan on 3 December 1994, followed by North America on 9 September 1995, Europe on 29 September 1995, and other regions following thereafter. As a fifth-generation console, the PlayStation primarily competed with the Nintendo 64 and the Sega Saturn.\nSony began developing the PlayStation after a failed venture with Nintendo to create a CD-ROM peripheral for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in the early 1990s. The console was primarily designed by Ken Kutaragi and Sony Computer Entertainment in Japan, while additional development was outsourced in the United Kingdom. An emphasis on 3D polygon graphics was placed at the forefront of the console's design. PlayStation game production was designed to be streamlined and inclusive, enticing the support of many third party developers.\nThe console proved popular for its extensive game library, popular franchises, low retail price, and aggressive youth marketing which advertised it as the preferable console for adolescents and adults. Critically acclaimed games that defined the console include \"Gran Turismo\", \"Crash Bandicoot\", \"Spyro the Dragon\", \"Tomb Raider\", \"Resident Evil\", \"Metal Gear Solid\", \"Tekken 3\", and \"Final Fantasy VII\". Sony ceased production of the PlayStation on 23 March 2006\u2014over eleven years after it had been released, and in the same year the PlayStation 3 debuted. More than 4,000 PlayStation games were released, with cumulative sales of 962\u00a0million units.\nThe PlayStation signaled Sony's rise to power in the video game industry. It received acclaim and sold strongly; in less than a decade, it became the first computer entertainment platform to ship over 100\u00a0million units. Its use of compact discs heralded the game industry's transition from cartridges. The PlayStation's success led to a line of successors, beginning with the PlayStation 2 in 2000. In the same year, Sony released a smaller and cheaper model, the PS one.\nHistory.\nBackground.\nThe PlayStation was conceived by Ken Kutaragi, a Sony executive who managed a hardware engineering division and was later dubbed \"the Father of the PlayStation\". Kutaragi's interest in working with video games stemmed from seeing his daughter play games on Nintendo's Famicom. Kutaragi convinced Nintendo to use his SPC-700 sound processor in the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) through a demonstration of the processor's capabilities. His willingness to work with Nintendo was derived from both his admiration of the Famicom and conviction in video game consoles becoming the main home-use entertainment systems. Although Kutaragi was nearly fired because he worked with Nintendo without Sony's knowledge, president Norio Ohga recognised the potential in Kutaragi's chip and decided to keep him as a prot\u00e9g\u00e9.\nThe inception of the PlayStation dates back to a 1988 joint venture between Nintendo and Sony. Nintendo had produced floppy disk technology to complement cartridges in the form of the Family Computer Disk System, and wanted to continue this complementary storage strategy for the SNES. Since Sony was already contracted to produce the SPC-700 sound processor for the SNES, Nintendo contracted Sony to develop a CD-ROM add-on, tentatively titled the \"Play Station\" or \"SNES-CD\". The PlayStation name had already been trademarked by Yamaha, but Nobuyuki Idei liked it so much that he agreed to acquire it for an undisclosed sum rather than search for an alternative.\nSony was keen to obtain a foothold in the rapidly expanding video game market. Having been the primary manufacturer of the ill-fated MSX home computer format, Sony had wanted to use their experience in consumer electronics to produce their own video game hardware. Although the initial agreement between Nintendo and Sony was about producing a CD-ROM drive add-on, Sony had also planned to develop a SNES-compatible Sony-branded console. This iteration was intended to be more of a home entertainment system, playing both SNES cartridges and a new CD format named the \"Super Disc\", which Sony would design. Under the agreement, Sony would retain sole international rights to every Super Disc game, giving them a large degree of control despite Nintendo's leading position in the video game market. Furthermore, Sony would also be the sole benefactor of licensing related to music and film software that it had been aggressively pursuing as a secondary application.\nThe Play Station was to be announced at the 1991 Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas. However, Nintendo president Hiroshi Yamauchi was wary of Sony's increasing leverage at this point and deemed the original 1988 contract unacceptable upon realising it essentially handed Sony control over all games written on the SNES CD-ROM format. Although Nintendo was dominant in the video game market, Sony possessed a superior research and development department. Wanting to protect Nintendo's existing licensing structure, Yamauchi cancelled all plans for the joint Nintendo\u2013Sony SNES CD attachment without telling Sony. He sent Nintendo of America president Minoru Arakawa (his son-in-law) and chairman Howard Lincoln to Amsterdam to form a more favourable contract with Dutch conglomerate Philips, Sony's rival. This contract would give Nintendo total control over their licences on all Philips-produced machines.\nKutaragi and Nobuyuki Idei, Sony's director of public relations at the time, learned of Nintendo's actions two days before the CES was due to begin. Kutaragi telephoned numerous contacts, including Philips, to no avail. On the first day of the CES, Sony announced their partnership with Nintendo and their new console, the Play Station. At 9\u00a0am on the next day, in what has been called \"the greatest ever betrayal\" in the industry, Howard Lincoln stepped onto the stage and revealed that Nintendo was now allied with Philips and would abandon their work with Sony.\nInception.\nIncensed by Nintendo's renouncement, Ohga and Kutaragi decided that Sony would develop their own console. Nintendo's contract-breaking was met with consternation in the Japanese business community, as they had broken an \"unwritten law\" of native companies not turning against each other in favour of foreign ones. Sony's American branch considered allying with Sega to produce a CD-ROM-based machine called the Sega Multimedia Entertainment System, but the Sega board of directors in Tokyo vetoed the idea when Sega of America CEO Tom Kalinske presented them the proposal. Kalinske recalled them saying: \"That's a stupid idea, Sony doesn't know how to make hardware. They don't know how to make software either. Why would we want to do this?\" Sony halted their research, but decided to develop what it had developed with Nintendo and Sega into a console based on the SNES.\nDespite the tumultuous events at the 1991 CES, negotiations between Nintendo and Sony were still ongoing. A deal was proposed: the Play Station would still have a port for SNES games, on the condition that it would still use Kutaragi's audio chip and that Nintendo would own the rights and receive the bulk of the profits. Roughly two hundred prototype machines were created, and some software entered development. Many within Sony were still opposed to their involvement in the video game industry, with some resenting Kutaragi for jeopardising the company. Kutaragi remained adamant that Sony not retreat from the growing industry and that a deal with Nintendo would never work. Knowing that they had to take decisive action, Sony severed all ties with Nintendo on 4 May 1992.\nTo determine the fate of the PlayStation project, Ohga chaired a meeting in June 1992, consisting of Kutaragi and several senior Sony board members. Kutaragi unveiled a proprietary CD-ROM-based system he had been secretly working on which played games with immersive 3D graphics. Kutaragi was confident that his LSI chip could accommodate one million logic gates, which exceeded the capabilities of Sony's semiconductor division at the time. Despite gaining Ohga's enthusiasm, there remained opposition from a majority present at the meeting. Older Sony executives also opposed it, who saw Nintendo and Sega as \"toy\" manufacturers. The opposers felt the game industry was too culturally offbeat and asserted that Sony should remain a central player in the audiovisual industry, where companies were familiar with one another and could conduct \"civili[s]ed\" business negotiations. After Kutaragi reminded him of the humiliation he suffered from Nintendo, Ohga retained the project and became one of Kutaragi's most staunch supporters.\nOhga shifted Kutaragi and nine of his team from Sony's main headquarters to Sony Music Entertainment Japan (SMEJ), a subsidiary of the main Sony group, so as to retain the project and maintain relationships with Philips for the MMCD development project. The involvement of SMEJ proved crucial to the PlayStation's early development as the process of manufacturing games on CD-ROM format was similar to that used for audio CDs, with which Sony's music division had considerable experience. While at SMEJ, Kutaragi worked with Epic/Sony Records founder Shigeo Maruyama and Akira Sato; both later became vice-presidents of the division that ran the PlayStation business. Sony Computer Entertainment (SCE) was jointly established by Sony and SMEJ to handle the company's ventures into the video game industry. On 27 October 1993, Sony publicly announced that it was entering the game console market with the PlayStation. According to Maruyama, there was uncertainty over whether the console should primarily focus on 2D, sprite-based graphics or 3D polygon graphics. After Sony witnessed the success of Sega's \"Virtua Fighter\" (1993) in Japanese arcades, the direction of the PlayStation became \"instantly clear\" and 3D polygon graphics became the console's primary focus. SCE president Teruhisa Tokunaka expressed gratitude for Sega's timely release of \"Virtua Fighter\" as it proved \"just at the right time\" that making games with 3D imagery was possible. Maruyama claimed that Sony further wanted to emphasise the new console's ability to utilise redbook audio from the CD-ROM format in its games alongside high quality visuals and gameplay.\nWishing to distance the project from the failed enterprise with Nintendo, Sony initially branded the PlayStation the \"PlayStation X\" (PSX). Sony formed their European division and North American division, known as Sony Computer Entertainment Europe (SCEE) and Sony Computer Entertainment America (SCEA), in January and May\u00a01995. The divisions planned to market the new console under the alternative branding \"PSX\" following the negative feedback regarding \"PlayStation\" in focus group studies. Early advertising prior to the console's launch in North America referenced PSX, but the term was scrapped before launch. The console was not marketed with Sony's name in contrast to Nintendo's consoles. According to Phil Harrison, much of Sony's upper management feared that the Sony brand would be tarnished if associated with the console, which they considered a \"toy\".\nDevelopment.\nSince Sony had no experience in game development, it had to rely on the support of third-party game developers. This was in contrast to Sega and Nintendo, which had versatile and well-equipped in-house software divisions for their arcade games and could easily port successful games to their home consoles. Recent consoles like the Atari Jaguar and 3DO suffered low sales due to a lack of developer support, prompting Sony to redouble their efforts in gaining the endorsement of arcade-savvy developers. A team from Epic Sony visited more than a hundred companies throughout Japan in May\u00a01993 in hopes of attracting game creators with the PlayStation's technological appeal. Sony found that many disliked Nintendo's practices, such as favouring their own games over others. Through a series of negotiations, Sony acquired initial support from Namco, Konami, and Williams Entertainment, as well as 250 other development teams in Japan alone. Namco in particular was interested in developing for PlayStation since Namco rivalled Sega in the arcade market. Attaining these companies secured influential games such as \"Ridge Racer\" (1993) and \"Mortal Kombat 3\" (1995), \"Ridge Racer\" being one of the most popular arcade games at the time, and it was already confirmed behind closed doors that it would be the PlayStation's first game by December 1993, despite Namco being a longstanding Nintendo developer. Namco's research managing director Shegeichi Nakamura met with Kutaragi in 1993 to discuss the preliminary PlayStation specifications, with Namco subsequently basing the Namco System 11 arcade board on PlayStation hardware and developing \"Tekken\" to compete with \"Virtua Fighter\". The System 11 launched in arcades several months before the PlayStation's release, with the arcade release of \"Tekken\" in September 1994.\nDespite securing the support of various Japanese studios, Sony had no developers of their own by the time the PlayStation was in development. This changed in 1993 when Sony acquired the Liverpudlian company Psygnosis (later renamed SCE Liverpool) for US$ million, securing their first in-house development team. The acquisition meant that Sony could have more launch games ready for the PlayStation's release in Europe and North America. Ian Hetherington, Psygnosis' co-founder, was disappointed after receiving early builds of the PlayStation and recalled that the console \"was not fit for purpose\" until his team got involved with it. Hetherington frequently clashed with Sony executives over broader ideas; at one point it was suggested that a television with a built-in PlayStation be produced. In the months leading up to the PlayStation's launch, Psygnosis had around 500 full-time staff working on games and assisting with software development.\nThe purchase of Psygnosis marked another turning point for the PlayStation as it played a vital role in creating the console's development kits. While Sony had provided MIPS R4000-based Sony NEWS workstations for PlayStation development, Psygnosis employees disliked the thought of developing on these expensive workstations and asked Bristol-based SN Systems to create an alternative PC-based development system. Andy Beveridge and Martin Day, owners of SN Systems, had previously supplied development hardware for other consoles such as the Mega Drive, Atari ST, and the SNES. When Psygnosis arranged an audience for SN Systems with Sony's Japanese executives at the January\u00a01994 CES in Las Vegas, Beveridge and Day presented their prototype of the condensed development kit, which could run on an ordinary personal computer with two extension boards. Impressed, Sony decided to abandon their plans for a workstation-based development system in favour of SN Systems's, thus securing a cheaper and more efficient method for designing software. An order of over 600 systems followed, and SN Systems supplied Sony with additional software such as an assembler, linker, and a debugger. SN Systems produced development kits for future PlayStation systems, including the PlayStation 2 and was bought out by Sony in 2005.\nSony strived to make game production as streamlined and inclusive as possible, in contrast to the relatively isolated approach of Sega and Nintendo. Phil Harrison, representative director of SCEE, believed that Sony's emphasis on developer assistance reduced most time-consuming aspects of development. As well as providing programming libraries, SCE headquarters in London, California, and Tokyo housed technical support teams that could work closely with third-party developers if needed. Sony did not favour their own over non-Sony products, unlike Nintendo; Peter Molyneux of Bullfrog Productions admired Sony's open-handed approach to software developers and lauded their decision to use PCs as a development platform, remarking that \"[it was] like being released from jail in terms of the freedom you have\". Another strategy that helped attract software developers was the PlayStation's use of the CD-ROM format instead of traditional cartridges. Nintendo cartridges were expensive to manufacture, and the company controlled all production, prioritising their own games, while inexpensive compact disc manufacturing occurred at dozens of locations around the world.\nThe PlayStation's architecture and interconnectability with PCs was beneficial to many software developers. The use of the programming language C proved useful, as it safeguarded future compatibility of the machine should developers decide to make further hardware revisions. Despite the inherent flexibility, some developers found themselves restricted due to the console's lack of RAM. While working on beta builds of the PlayStation, Molyneux observed that its MIPS processor was not \"quite as bullish\" compared to that of a fast PC and said that it took his team two weeks to port their PC code to the PlayStation development kits and another fortnight to achieve a four-fold speed increase. An engineer from Ocean Software, one of Europe's largest game developers at the time, thought that allocating RAM was a challenging aspect given the 3.5 megabyte restriction. Kutaragi said that while it would have been easy to double the amount of RAM for the PlayStation, the development team refrained from doing so to keep the retail cost down. Kutaragi saw the biggest challenge in developing the system to be balancing the conflicting goals of high performance, low cost, and being easy to program for, and felt he and his team were successful in this regard.\nIts technical specifications were finalised in 1993 and its design during 1994. The PlayStation name and its final design were confirmed during a press conference on May 10, 1994, although the price and release dates had not been disclosed yet.\nLaunch.\nSony released the PlayStation in Japan on 3 December 1994, a week after the release of the Sega Saturn, at a price of \u00a5. Sales in Japan began with a \"stunning\" success with long queues in shops. Ohga later recalled that he realised how important PlayStation had become for Sony when friends and relatives begged for consoles for their children. PlayStation sold 100,000 units on the first day and two million units within six months, although the Saturn outsold the PlayStation in the first few weeks due to the success of \"Virtua Fighter\". By the end of 1994, 300,000 PlayStation units were sold in Japan compared to 500,000 Saturn units. A grey market emerged for PlayStations shipped from Japan to North America and Europe, with buyers of such consoles paying up to \u00a3700.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n \"When September 1995 arrived and Sony's Playstation roared out of the gate, things immediately felt different than [\"sic\"] they did with the Saturn launch earlier that year. Sega dropped the Saturn $100 to match the Playstation's $299 debut price, but sales weren't even close\u2014Playstations flew out the door as fast as we could get them in stock.\n \u2014Lee Hutchinson of \"Ars Technica\", a Babbage's employee in 1995, recalling how PlayStation preorders greatly outnumbered Saturn sales at his shop.\nBefore the release in North America, Sega and Sony presented their consoles at the first Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) in Los Angeles on 11 May 1995. At their keynote presentation, Sega of America CEO Tom Kalinske revealed that their Saturn console would be released immediately to select retailers at a price of $399. Next came Sony's turn: Olaf Olafsson, the head of SCEA, summoned Steve Race, the head of development, to the conference stage, who said \"$299\" and left the audience with a round of applause. The attention to the Sony conference was further bolstered by the surprise appearance of Michael Jackson and the showcase of highly anticipated games, including \"Wipeout\" (1995), \"Ridge Racer\" and \"Tekken\" (1994). In addition, Sony announced that no games would be bundled with the console.\nAlthough the Saturn had released early in the United States to gain an advantage over the PlayStation, the surprise launch upset many retailers who were not informed in time, harming sales. Some retailers such as KB Toys responded by dropping the Saturn entirely. The PlayStation went on sale in North America on 9 September 1995. It sold more units within two days than the Saturn had in five months, with almost all of the initial shipment of 100,000 units sold in advance and shops across the country running out of consoles and accessories. The well-received \"Ridge Racer\" contributed to the PlayStation's early success, \u2014 with some critics considering it superior to Sega's arcade counterpart \"Daytona USA\" (1994) \u2014 as did \"Battle Arena Toshinden\" (1995). There were over 100,000 pre-orders placed and 17 games available on the market by the time of the PlayStation's American launch, in comparison to the Saturn's six launch games.\nThe PlayStation released in Europe on 29 September 1995 and in Australia on 15 November 1995. By November it had already outsold the Saturn by three to one in the United Kingdom, where Sony had allocated a \u00a320\u00a0million marketing budget during the Christmas season compared to Sega's \u00a34\u00a0million. Sony found early success in the United Kingdom by securing listings with independent shop owners as well as prominent High Street chains such as Comet and Argos. Within its first year, the PlayStation secured over 20% of the entire American video game market. From September to the end of 1995, sales in the United States amounted to 800,000 units, giving the PlayStation a commanding lead over the other fifth-generation consoles, though the SNES and Mega Drive from the fourth generation still outsold it. Sony reported that the attach rate of sold games and consoles was four to one. To meet increasing demand, Sony chartered jumbo jets and ramped up production in Europe and North America. By early 1996, the PlayStation had grossed $2\u00a0billion (equivalent to $\u00a0billion 2024) from worldwide hardware and software sales. By late 1996, sales in Europe totalled 2.2 million units, including 700,000 in the UK. Approximately 400 PlayStation games were in development, compared to around 200 games being developed for the Saturn and 60 for the Nintendo 64.\nIn India, the PlayStation was launched in test market during 1999\u20132000 across Sony showrooms, selling 100 units. Sony finally launched the console (PS One model) countrywide on 24 January 2002 with the price of Rs 7,990 and 26 games available from start.\nPlayStation was also doing well in markets where it was never officially released. For example, in Brazil, due to the registration of the trademark by a third company, the console could not be released, which was why the market was taken over by the officially distributed Sega Saturn during the first period, but as the Sega console withdraws, PlayStation imports and large piracy increased. In another market, China, the most popular 32-bit console was Sega Saturn, but after leaving the market, PlayStation grown with a base of 300,000 users until January 2000, although Sony China did not have plans to release it.\nMarketing success and later years.\nThe PlayStation was backed by a successful marketing campaign, allowing Sony to gain an early foothold in Europe and North America. Initially, PlayStation demographics were skewed towards adults, but the audience broadened after the first price drop. While the Saturn was positioned towards 18- to 34-year-olds, the PlayStation was initially marketed exclusively towards teenagers. Executives from both Sony and Sega reasoned that because younger players typically looked up to older, more experienced players, advertising targeted at teens and adults would draw them in too. Additionally, Sony found that adults reacted best to advertising aimed at teenagers; Lee Clow surmised that people who started to grow into adulthood regressed and became \"17 again\" when they played video games. The console was marketed with advertising slogans stylised as \"LIVE IN YUR WRLD. PLY IN URS\" (\"Live in Your World. Play in Ours.\") and \"U R NOT E\" (red E). The four geometric shapes were derived from the symbols for the four buttons on the controller. Clow thought that by invoking such provocative statements, gamers would respond to the contrary and say \"'Bullshit. Let me show you how ready I am.'\" As the console's appeal enlarged, Sony's marketing efforts broadened from their earlier focus on mature players to specifically target younger children as well.\nShortly after the PlayStation's release in Europe, Sony tasked marketing manager Geoff Glendenning with assessing the desires of a new target audience. Sceptical over Nintendo and Sega's reliance on television campaigns, Glendenning theorised that young adults transitioning from fourth-generation consoles would feel neglected by marketing directed at children and teenagers. Recognising the influence early 1990s underground clubbing and rave culture had on young people, especially in the United Kingdom, Glendenning felt that the culture had become mainstream enough to help cultivate PlayStation's emerging identity. Sony partnered with prominent nightclub owners such as Ministry of Sound and festival promoters to organise dedicated PlayStation areas where demonstrations of select games could be tested. Sheffield-based graphic design studio The Designers Republic was contracted by Sony to produce promotional materials aimed at a fashionable, club-going audience. Psygnosis' \"Wipeout\" in particular became associated with nightclub culture as it was widely featured in venues. By 1997, there were 52 nightclubs in the United Kingdom with dedicated PlayStation rooms. Glendenning recalled that he had discreetly used at least \u00a3100,000 a year in slush fund money to invest in impromptu marketing.\nIn 1996, Sony expanded their CD production facilities in the United States due to the high demand for PlayStation games, increasing their monthly output from 4\u00a0million discs to 6.5\u00a0million discs. This was necessary because PlayStation sales were running at twice the rate of Saturn sales, and its lead dramatically increased when both consoles dropped in price to $199 that year. The PlayStation also outsold the Saturn at a similar ratio in Europe during 1996, with 2.2\u00a0million consoles sold in the region by the end of the year. Sales figures for PlayStation hardware and software only increased following the launch of the Nintendo 64. Tokunaka speculated that the Nintendo 64 launch had actually helped PlayStation sales by raising public awareness of the gaming market through Nintendo's added marketing efforts. Despite this, the PlayStation took longer to achieve dominance in Japan. Tokunaka said that, even after the PlayStation and Saturn had been on the market for nearly two years, the competition between them was still \"very close\", and neither console had led in sales for any meaningful length of time.\nBy 1998, Sega, encouraged by their declining market share and significant financial losses, launched the Dreamcast as a last-ditch attempt to stay in the industry. Although its launch was successful, the technically superior 128-bit console was unable to subdue Sony's dominance in the industry. Sony still held 60% of the overall video game market share in North America at the end of 1999. Sega's initial confidence in their new console was undermined when Japanese sales were lower than expected, with disgruntled Japanese consumers reportedly returning their Dreamcasts in exchange for PlayStation software. On 2 March 1999, Sony officially revealed details of the PlayStation 2, which Kutaragi announced would feature a graphics processor designed to push more raw polygons than any console in history, effectively rivalling most supercomputers. The PlayStation continued to sell strongly at the turn of the new millennium: in June 2000, Sony released the PSOne, a smaller, redesigned variant which went on to outsell all other consoles in that year, including the PlayStation 2. In 2005, PlayStation became the first console to ship 100 million units with the PlayStation 2 later achieving this faster than its predecessor. The combined successes of both PlayStation consoles led to Sega retiring the Dreamcast in 2001, and abandoning the console business entirely. The PlayStation was eventually discontinued on 23 March 2006\u2014over eleven years after its release, and less than a year before the debut of the PlayStation 3.\nHardware.\nTechnical specifications.\nThe main microprocessor is a R3000 CPU made by LSI Logic operating at a clock rate of 33.8688\u00a0MHz and 30\u00a0MIPS. This 32-bit CPU relies heavily on the \"cop2\" 3D and matrix math coprocessor on the same die to provide the necessary speed to render complex 3D graphics. The role of the separate GPU chip is to draw 2D polygons and apply shading and textures to them: the rasterisation stage of the graphics pipeline. Sony's custom 16-bit sound chip supports ADPCM sources with up to 24 sound channels and offers a sampling rate of up to 44.1\u00a0kHz and MIDI sequencing. It features 2\u00a0MB of main RAM, with an additional 1\u00a0MB of video RAM. The PlayStation has a maximum colour depth of 16.7\u00a0million true colours with 32 levels of transparency and unlimited colour look-up tables. The PlayStation can output composite, S-Video or RGB video signals through its AV Multi connector (with older models also having RCA connectors for composite), displaying resolutions from 256\u00d7224 to 640\u00d7480 pixels. Different games can use different resolutions. Earlier models also had proprietary parallel and serial ports that could be used to connect accessories or multiple consoles together; these were later removed due to a lack of usage.\nThe PlayStation uses a proprietary video compression unit, MDEC, which is integrated into the CPU and allows for the presentation of full motion video at a higher quality than other consoles of its generation. Unusual for the time, the PlayStation lacks a dedicated 2D graphics processor; 2D elements are instead calculated as polygons by the Geometry Transfer Engine (GTE) so that they can be processed and displayed on screen by the GPU. While running, the GPU can also generate a total of 4,000 sprites and 180,000 polygons per second, in addition to 360,000 per second flat-shaded.\nModels.\nThe PlayStation went through a number of variants during its production run. Externally, the most notable change was the gradual reduction in the number of external connectors from the rear of the unit. This started with the original Japanese launch units; the SCPH-1000, released on 3 December 1994, was the only model that had an S-Video port, as it was removed from the next model. Subsequent models saw a reduction in number of parallel ports, with the final version only retaining one serial port.\nSony marketed a development kit for amateur developers known as the Net Yaroze (meaning \"Let's do it together\" in Japanese). It was launched in June 1996 in Japan, and following public interest, was released the next year in other countries. The Net Yaroze allowed hobbyists to create their own games and upload them via an online forum run by Sony. The console was only available to buy through an ordering service and with the necessary documentation and software to program PlayStation games and applications through C programming compilers.\nPS One.\nOn 7 July 2000, Sony released the PS One (stylised as \"PS one\" or \"PSone\"), a smaller, redesigned version of the original PlayStation. It was the highest-selling console through the end of the year, outselling all other consoles\u2014including the PlayStation 2. In 2002, Sony released a LCD screen add-on for the PS One, referred to as the \"Combo pack\". It also included a car cigarette lighter adaptor adding an extra layer of portability. Production of the LCD \"Combo Pack\" ceased in 2004, when the popularity of the PlayStation began to wane in markets outside Japan. A total of 28.15\u00a0million PS One units had been sold by the time it was discontinued in March 2006.\nControllers.\nThree iterations of the PlayStation's controller were released over the console's lifespan. The first controller, the PlayStation controller, was released alongside the PlayStation in December 1994. It features four individual directional buttons (as opposed to a conventional D-pad), a pair of shoulder buttons on both sides, Start and Select buttons in the centre, and four face buttons consisting of simple geometric shapes: a green triangle, red circle, blue cross, and a pink square (, , , ). Rather than depicting traditionally used letters or numbers onto its buttons, the PlayStation controller established a trademark which would be incorporated heavily into the PlayStation brand. Teiyu Goto, the designer of the original PlayStation controller, said that the circle and cross represent \"yes\" and \"no\", respectively (though this layout is reversed in Western versions); the triangle symbolises a point of view and the square is equated to a sheet of paper to be used to access menus. The European and North American models of the original PlayStation controllers are roughly 10% larger than its Japanese variant, to account for the fact the average person in those regions has larger hands than the average Japanese person.\nSony's first analogue gamepad, the PlayStation Analog Joystick (often erroneously referred to as the \"Sony Flightstick\"), was first released in Japan in April\u00a01996. Featuring two parallel joysticks, it uses potentiometer technology previously used on consoles such as the Vectrex; instead of relying on binary eight-way switches, the controller detects minute angular changes through the entire range of motion. The stick also features a thumb-operated digital hat switch on the right joystick, corresponding to the traditional D-pad, and used for instances when simple digital movements were necessary. The Analog Joystick sold poorly in Japan due to its high cost and cumbersome size.\nThe increasing popularity of 3D games prompted Sony to add analogue sticks to its controller design to give users more freedom over their movements in virtual 3D environments. The first official analogue controller, the Dual Analog Controller, was revealed to the public in a small glass booth at the 1996 PlayStation Expo in Japan, and released in April 1997 to coincide with the Japanese releases of analogue-capable games \"Tobal 2\" and \"Bushido Blade\". In addition to the two analogue sticks (which also introduced two new buttons mapped to clicking in the analogue sticks), the Dual Analog controller features an \"Analog\" button and LED beneath the \"Start\" and \"Select\" buttons which toggles analogue functionality on or off. The controller also features rumble support, though Sony decided that haptic feedback would be removed from all overseas iterations before the United States release. A Sony spokesman stated that the feature was removed for \"manufacturing reasons\", although rumours circulated that Nintendo had attempted to legally block the release of the controller outside Japan due to similarities with the Nintendo 64 controller's Rumble Pak. However, a Nintendo spokesman denied that Nintendo took legal action. \"Next Generation\"'s Chris Charla theorised that Sony dropped vibration feedback to keep the price of the controller down.\nIn November 1997, Sony introduced the DualShock controller. Its name derives from its use of two (dual) vibration motors (shock). Unlike its predecessor, its analogue sticks feature textured rubber grips, longer handles, slightly different shoulder buttons and has rumble feedback included as standard on all versions. The DualShock later replaced its predecessors as the default controller.\nPeripherals.\nSony released a series of peripherals to add extra layers of functionality to the PlayStation. Such peripherals include memory cards, the PlayStation Mouse, the PlayStation Link Cable, the Multiplayer Adapter (a four-player multitap), the Memory Drive (a disk drive for 3.5-inch floppy disks), the GunCon (a light gun), and the Glasstron (a monoscopic head-mounted display).\nReleased exclusively in Japan, the PocketStation is a memory card peripheral which acts as a miniature personal digital assistant. The device features a monochrome liquid crystal display (LCD), infrared communication capability, a real-time clock, built-in flash memory, and sound capability. Sharing similarities with the Dreamcast's VMU peripheral, the PocketStation was typically distributed with certain PlayStation games, enhancing them with added features. The PocketStation proved popular in Japan, selling over five million units. Sony planned to release the peripheral outside Japan but the release was cancelled, despite receiving promotion in Europe and North America.\nFunctionality.\nIn addition to playing games, most PlayStation models are equipped to play audio CDs; the Asian model SCPH-5903 can also play Video CDs. Like most CD players, the PlayStation can play songs in a programmed order, shuffle the playback order of the disc and repeat one song or the entire disc. Later PlayStation models use a music visualisation function called SoundScope. This function, as well as a memory card manager, is accessed by starting the console without either inserting a game or closing the CD tray, thereby accessing a graphical user interface (GUI) for the PlayStation BIOS. The GUI for the PS One and PlayStation differ depending on the firmware version: the original PlayStation GUI had a dark blue background with rainbow graffiti used as buttons, while the early PAL PlayStation and PS One GUI had a grey blocked background with two icons in the middle.\nPlayStation emulation is versatile and can be run on numerous modern devices. Bleem! was a commercial emulator which was released for IBM-compatible PCs and the Dreamcast in 1999. It was notable for being aggressively marketed during the PlayStation's lifetime, and was the centre of multiple controversial lawsuits filed by Sony. Bleem! was programmed in assembly language, which allowed it to emulate PlayStation games with improved visual fidelity, enhanced resolutions, and filtered textures that was not possible on original hardware. Sony sued Bleem! two days after its release, citing copyright infringement and accusing the company of engaging in unfair competition and patent infringement by allowing use of PlayStation BIOSs on a Sega console. Bleem! were subsequently forced to shut down in November 2001.\nCopy protection system.\nSony was aware that using CDs for game distribution could have left games vulnerable to piracy, due to the growing popularity of CD-R and optical disc drives with burning capability. To preclude illegal copying, a proprietary process for PlayStation disc manufacturing was developed that, in conjunction with an augmented optical drive in Tiger H/E assembly, prevented burned copies of games from booting on an unmodified console. Specifically, all genuine PlayStation discs were printed with a small section of deliberate irregular data, which the PlayStation's optical pick-up was capable of detecting and decoding. Consoles would not boot game discs without a specific wobble frequency contained in the data of the disc pregap sector (the same system was also used to encode discs' regional lockouts). This signal was within Red Book CD tolerances, so PlayStation discs' actual content could still be read by a conventional disc drive; however, the disc drive could not detect the wobble frequency (therefore duplicating the discs omitting it), since the laser pick-up system of any optical disc drive would interpret this wobble as an oscillation of the disc surface and compensate for it in the reading process.\nHardware problems.\nEarly PlayStations, particularly early 1000 models, experience skipping full-motion video or physical \"ticking\" noises from the unit. The problems stem from poorly placed vents leading to overheating in some environments, causing the plastic mouldings inside the console to warp slightly and create knock-on effects with the laser assembly. The solution is to sit the console on a surface which dissipates heat efficiently in a well vented area or raise the unit up slightly from its resting surface. Sony representatives also recommended unplugging the PlayStation when it is not in use, as the system draws in a small amount of power (and therefore heat) even when turned off.\nThe first batch of PlayStations use a KSM-440AAM laser unit, whose case and movable parts are all built out of plastic. Over time, the plastic lens sled rail wears out\u2014usually unevenly\u2014due to friction. The placement of the laser unit close to the power supply accelerates wear, due to the additional heat, which makes the plastic more vulnerable to friction. Eventually, one side of the lens sled will become so worn that the laser can tilt, no longer pointing directly at the CD; after this, games will no longer load due to data read errors. Sony fixed the problem by making the sled out of die-cast metal and placing the laser unit further away from the power supply on later PlayStation models.\nDue to an engineering oversight, the PlayStation does not produce a proper signal on several older models of televisions, causing the display to flicker or bounce around the screen. Sony decided not to change the console design, since only a small percentage of PlayStation owners used such televisions, and instead gave consumers the option of sending their PlayStation unit to a Sony service centre to have an official modchip installed, allowing play on older televisions.\nGame library.\nThe PlayStation featured a diverse game library which grew to appeal to all types of players. Critically acclaimed PlayStation games included \"Final Fantasy VII\" (1997), \"Crash Bandicoot\" (1996), \"Spyro the Dragon\" (1998), \"Metal Gear Solid\" (1998), all of which became established franchises. \"Final Fantasy VII\" is credited with allowing role-playing games to gain mass-market appeal outside Japan, and is considered one of the most influential and greatest video games ever made. The PlayStation's bestselling game is \"Gran Turismo\" (1997), which sold 10.85\u00a0million units. After the PlayStation's discontinuation in 2006, the cumulative software shipment was 962\u00a0million units. Sony assisted with game reprints as late as 2008 With Metal Gear Solid: The Essential Collection On March 18, 2008, This Being The last one with PS1 discs officially Release And licensed by Sony.\nFollowing its 1994 launch in Japan, early games included \"Ridge Racer\", \"Crime Crackers\", \"King's Field\", \"Motor Toon Grand Prix\", \"Toh Shin Den\" (i.e. \"Battle Arena Toshinden\"), and \"\". The first two games available at its later North American launch were \"Jumping Flash!\" (1995) and \"Ridge Racer\", with \"Jumping Flash!\" heralded as an ancestor for 3D graphics in console gaming. \"Wipeout\", \"Air Combat\", \"Twisted Metal\", \"Warhawk\" and \"Destruction Derby\" were among the popular first-year games, and the first to be reissued as part of Sony's Greatest Hits or Platinum range.\nAt the time of the PlayStation's first Christmas season, Psygnosis had produced around 70% of its launch catalogue; their breakthrough racing game \"Wipeout\" was acclaimed for its techno soundtrack and helped raise awareness of Britain's underground music community. Eidos Interactive's action-adventure game \"Tomb Raider\" contributed substantially to the success of the console in 1996, with its main protagonist Lara Croft becoming an early gaming icon and garnering unprecedented media promotion. Licensed tie-in video games of popular films were also prevalent; Argonaut Games' 2001 adaptation of \"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone\" went on to sell over eight million copies late in the console's lifespan. Third-party developers committed largely to the console's wide-ranging game catalogue even after the launch of the PlayStation 2; some of the notable exclusives in this era include \"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone\", ', \"Syphon Filter 3\", ', \"Dance Dance Revolution Konamix\" and \"Digimon World 3\".\nInitially, in the United States, PlayStation games were packaged in long cardboard boxes, similar to non-Japanese 3DO and Saturn games. Sony later switched to the jewel case format typically used for audio CDs and Japanese video games, as this format took up less retailer shelf space (which was at a premium due to the large number of PlayStation games being released), and focus testing showed that most consumers preferred this format.\nReception.\nThe PlayStation was mostly well received upon release. Critics in the west generally welcomed the new console; the staff of \"Next Generation\" reviewed the PlayStation a few weeks after its North American launch, where they commented that, while the CPU is \"fairly average\", the supplementary custom hardware, such as the GPU and sound processor, is stunningly powerful. They praised the PlayStation's focus on 3D, and complemented the comfort of its controller and the convenience of its memory cards. Giving the system 4&lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u20442 out of 5 stars, they concluded, \"To succeed in this extremely cut-throat market, you need a combination of great hardware, great games, and great marketing. Whether by skill, luck, or just deep pockets, Sony has scored three out of three in the first salvo of this war.\" Albert Kim from \"Entertainment Weekly\" praised the PlayStation as a technological marvel, rivalling that of Sega and Nintendo. \"Famicom Ts\u016bshin\" scored the console a 19 out of 40, lower than the Saturn's 24 out of 40, in May 1995.\nIn a 1997 year-end review, a team of five \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" editors gave the PlayStation scores of 9.5, 8.5, 9.0, 9.0, and 9.5\u2014for all five editors, the highest score they gave to any of the five consoles reviewed in the issue. They lauded the breadth and quality of the games library, saying it had vastly improved over previous years due to developers mastering the system's capabilities in addition to Sony revising their stance on 2D and role playing games. They also complimented the low price point of the games compared to the Nintendo 64's, and noted that it was the only console on the market that could be relied upon to deliver a solid stream of games for the coming year, primarily due to third party developers almost unanimously favouring it over its competitors.\nLegacy.\nSCE was an upstart in the video game industry in late 1994, as the video game market in the early 1990s was dominated by Nintendo and Sega. Nintendo had been the clear leader in the industry since the introduction of the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1985 and the Nintendo 64 was initially expected to maintain this position. The PlayStation's target audience included the generation which was the first to grow up with mainstream video games, along with 18- to 29-year-olds who were not the primary focus of Nintendo. By the late 1990s, Sony became a highly regarded console brand due to the PlayStation, with a significant lead over second-place Nintendo, while Sega was relegated to a distant third.\nThe PlayStation became the first \"computer entertainment platform\" to ship over 100\u00a0million units worldwide, with many critics attributing the console's success to third-party developers. It remains the sixth best-selling console of all time as of 2025[ [update]], with a total of 102.49\u00a0million units sold. Around 7,900 individual games were published for the console during its 11-year life span, the second-most games ever produced for a console. Its success resulted in a significant financial boon for Sony as profits from their video game division contributed to 23%.\nSony's next-generation PlayStation 2, which is backward compatible with the PlayStation's DualShock controller and games, was announced in 1999 and launched in 2000. The PlayStation's lead in installed base and developer support paved the way for the success of its successor, which overcame the earlier launch of the Sega's Dreamcast and then fended off competition from Microsoft's newcomer Xbox and Nintendo's GameCube. The PlayStation 2's immense success and failure of the Dreamcast were among the main factors which led to Sega abandoning the console market. To date, five PlayStation home consoles have been released, which have continued the same numbering scheme, as well as two portable systems. The PlayStation 3 also maintained backward compatibility with original PlayStation discs. Hundreds of PlayStation games have been digitally re-released on the PlayStation Portable, PlayStation 3, PlayStation Vita, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation 5.\nThe PlayStation has often ranked among the best video game consoles. In 2018, \"Retro Gamer\" named it the third best console, crediting its sophisticated 3D capabilities as one of its key factors in gaining mass success, and lauding it as a \"game-changer in every sense possible\". In 2009, IGN ranked the PlayStation the seventh best console in their list, noting its appeal towards older audiences to be a crucial factor in propelling the video game industry, as well as its assistance in transitioning game industry to use the CD-ROM format. Keith Stuart from \"The Guardian\" likewise named it as the seventh best console in 2020, declaring that its success was so profound it \"ruled the 1990s\".\nIn January 2025, Lorentio Brodesco announced the nsOne project, attempting to reverse engineer PlayStation's motherboard. Brodesco stated that \"detailed documentation on the original motherboard was either incomplete or entirely unavailable\". The project was successfully crowdfunded via Kickstarter. In June, Brodesco manufactured the first working motherboard, promising to bring a fully rooted version with multilayer routing as well as documentation and design files in the near future.\nCD format.\nThe success of the PlayStation contributed to the demise of cartridge-based home consoles. While not the first system to use an optical disc format, it was the first highly successful one, and ended up going head-to-head with the proprietary cartridge-relying Nintendo 64, which the industry had expected to use CDs like PlayStation. After the demise of the Sega Saturn, Nintendo was left as Sony's main competitor in Western markets. Nintendo chose not to use CDs for the Nintendo 64; they were likely concerned with the proprietary cartridge format's ability to help enforce copy protection, given their substantial reliance on licensing and exclusive games for their revenue.\nBesides their larger capacity, CD-ROMs could be produced in bulk quantities at a much faster rate than ROM cartridges, a week compared to two to three months. Further, the cost of production per unit was far cheaper, allowing Sony to offer games about 40% lower cost to the user compared to ROM cartridges while still making the same amount of net revenue. In Japan, Sony published fewer copies of a wide variety of games for the PlayStation as a risk-limiting step, a model that had been used by Sony Music for CD audio discs. The production flexibility of CD-ROMs meant that Sony could produce larger volumes of popular games to get onto the market quickly, something that could not be done with cartridges due to their manufacturing lead time. The lower production costs of CD-ROMs also allowed publishers an additional source of profit: budget-priced reissues of games which had already recouped their development costs.\nTokunaka remarked in 1996: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Choosing CD-ROM is one of the most important decisions that we made. As I'm sure you understand, PlayStation could just as easily have worked with masked ROM [cartridges]. The 3D engine and everything\u2014the whole PlayStation format\u2014is independent of the media. But for various reasons (including the economies for the consumer, the ease of the manufacturing, inventory control for the trade, and also the software publishers) we deduced that CD-ROM would be the best media for PlayStation.\nThe increasing complexity of developing games pushed cartridges to their storage limits and gradually discouraged some third-party developers. Part of the CD format's appeal to publishers was that they could be produced at a significantly lower cost and offered more production flexibility to meet demand. As a result, some third-party developers switched to the PlayStation, including Square and Enix, whose \"Final Fantasy VII\" and \"Dragon Quest VII\" respectively had been planned for the Nintendo 64 (both companies later merged to form Square Enix). Other developers released fewer games for the Nintendo 64 (Konami, releasing only thirteen N64 games but over fifty on the PlayStation). Nintendo 64 game releases were less frequent than the PlayStation's, with many being developed by either Nintendo themselves or second-parties such as Rare.\nPlayStation Classic.\nThe PlayStation Classic is a dedicated video game console made by Sony Interactive Entertainment that emulates PlayStation games. It was announced in September\u00a02018 at the Tokyo Game Show, and released on 3 December 2018, the 24th anniversary of the release of the original console.\nAs a dedicated console, the PlayStation Classic features 20 pre-installed games; the games run off the open source emulator PCSX. The console is bundled with two replica wired PlayStation controllers (those without analogue sticks), an HDMI cable, and a USB-Type A cable. Internally, the console uses a MediaTek MT8167a Quad A35 system on a chip with four central processing cores clocked at @ 1.5\u00a0GHz and a Power VR GE8300 graphics processing unit. It includes 16\u00a0GB of eMMC flash storage and 1\u00a0Gigabyte of DDR3 SDRAM. The PlayStation Classic is 45% smaller than the original console.\nThe PlayStation Classic received negative reviews from critics and was compared unfavorably to Nintendo's rival Nintendo Entertainment System Classic Edition and Super Nintendo Entertainment System Classic Edition. Criticism was directed at its meagre game library, user interface, emulation quality, use of PAL versions for certain games, use of the original controller, and high retail price, though the console's design received praise. The console sold poorly.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is known for being the most important computer in the creation of hacker culture at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Bolt, Beranek and Newman, and elsewhere. The PDP-1 is the original hardware for one of the first video games, Steve Russell's 1962 game \"Spacewar!.\"\nDescription.\nThe PDP-1 uses an 18-bit word size and has 4096 words as standard main memory (equivalent in bit size to 9,216 eight-bit bytes, but in character size to 12,388 bytes since the system actually divides an 18-bit word into three six-bit characters), upgradable to 65,536 words. The magnetic-core memory's cycle time is 5.35 microseconds (corresponding roughly to a clock speed of 187 kilohertz); consequently most arithmetic instructions take 10.7 microseconds (93,458 operations per second) because they use two memory cycles: the first to fetch the instruction, the second to fetch or store the data word. Signed numbers are represented in ones' complement. The PDP-1 has computing power roughly equivalent to a 1996 pocket organizer and a little less memory.\nThe PDP-1 uses 2,700 transistors and 3,000 diodes. It is constructed mostly of DEC 1000-series System Building Blocks, using micro-alloy and micro-alloy diffused transistors with a rated switching speed of 5MHz. The System Building Blocks are packaged into several 19-inch racks. The racks are themselves packaged into a single large mainframe case, with a hexagonal control panel containing switches and lights mounted to lie at table-top height at one end of the mainframe. Above the control panel is the system's standard input/output solution, a punched tape reader and writer.\nThe PDP-1 weighs about .\nHistory.\nThe design of the PDP-1 is based on the pioneering TX-0 and TX-2 computers, designed and built at MIT Lincoln Laboratory. Benjamin Gurley was the lead engineer on the project. After showing a prototype at the Eastern Joint Computer Conference in December 1959, DEC delivered the first PDP-1 to Bolt, Beranek and Newman (BBN) in November 1960, and it was formally accepted in early 1961. In September 1961, DEC donated the PDP-1 to MIT, where it was placed in the room next to its ancestor, the TX-0 computer, which was by then on indefinite loan from Lincoln Laboratory.\nIn this setting, the PDP-1 quickly replaced the TX-0 as the favorite machine among the budding hacker culture, and served as the platform for a long list of computing innovations. This list includes one of the earliest video games, \"Spacewar!\", the first text editor, the first word processor, the first interactive debugger, one of the very earliest time-sharing systems (BBN Time-Sharing System), and some of the earliest computerized music. The ARPANET IMP software was composed, edited, and assembled on BBN\u2019s PDP-1d computer using a modified assembler, highlighting the PDP-1's role in the early development of the ARPANET.\nAt the Computer History Museum TX-0 alumni reunion in 1984, Gordon Bell said DEC's products developed directly from the TX-2, the successor to the TX-0 which had been developed at what Bell thought was a bargain price at the time, about US$. At the same meeting, Jack Dennis said Ben Gurley's design for the PDP-1 was influenced by his work on the TX-0 display.\nThe PDP-1 sold in basic form for (equivalent to in 2024). BBN's system was quickly followed by orders from Lawrence Livermore and Atomic Energy of Canada (AECL), and eventually 53 PDP-1s were delivered until production ended in 1969. All of these machines were still being actively used in 1970, and several were eventually saved. MIT's example was donated to The Computer Museum, Boston, and from there ended up at the Computer History Museum (CHM). A late version of \"Spacewar!\" on paper tape was still tucked into the case. PDP-1 #44 was found in a barn in Wichita, Kansas in 1988, apparently formerly owned by one of the many aviation companies in the area, and rescued for the Digital Historical Collection, also eventually ending up at the CHM. AECL's computer was sent to Science North, but was later scrapped.\nThe launch of the PDP-1 marked a radical shift in the philosophy of computer design: it is the first commercial computer that focuses on interaction with the user rather than just the efficient use of computer cycles.\nThe first ever reference to malicious hacking is 'telephone hackers' in MIT's student newspaper, \"The Tech\", of hackers tying up the lines with Harvard, configuring the PDP-1 to make free calls, war dialing and accumulating large phone bills.\nPeripherals.\nThe PDP-1 uses fanfold punched paper tape as its primary storage medium. Unlike punched card decks, which could be sorted and re-ordered, paper tape is tedious to physically edit. This inspired the creation of text-editing programs such as Expensive Typewriter and TECO. Because it is equipped with online and offline printers that were based on IBM electric typewriter mechanisms, it is capable of what, in 1980s terminology, would be called \"letter-quality printing\" and therefore inspired TJ-2, arguably the first word processor.\nThe console typewriter, known as the \"Computeriter\", was provided by Soroban Engineering. It is an adapted IBM Model B Electric typewriter mechanism, modified by the addition of switches to detect key presses, and solenoids to activate the typebars. It uses a traditional typebar mechanism, not the \"golfball\" IBM Selectric typewriter mechanism, which was not introduced until the next year. Lettercase is selected by raising and lowering the massive type basket. The Soroban is equipped with a two-color inked ribbon (red and black), and the interface allows color selection. Programs commonly use color-coding to distinguish user input from machine responses. The Soroban mechanism is unreliable and prone to jamming, particularly when shifting case or changing ribbon color.\nOffline devices are typically Friden Flexowriters that have been specially built to operate with the FIO-DEC character coding used by the PDP-1. Like the console typewriter, these are built around a typing mechanism that is mechanically the same as an IBM Electric typewriter. However, Flexowriters are highly reliable and were often used for long unattended printing sessions. Flexowriters have electromechanical paper tape punches and readers which operate synchronously with the typewriter mechanism. Typing rates are about ten characters per second. A typical PDP-1 operating procedure is to output text to punched paper tape using the PDP-1's \"high speed\" (60-character-per-second) Teletype model BRPE punch, then to hand carry the tape to a Flexowriter for offline printing.\nIn later years, DECtape drives were added to some PDP-1 systems, as a more convenient method of backing up programs and data, and to enable early time-sharing. This latter application usually requires a secondary storage medium for swapping programs and data in and out of core memory, without requiring manual intervention. For this purpose, DECtapes are far superior to paper tapes, in terms of reliability, durability, and speed. Early hard disks were expensive and notoriously unreliable; if available and working, they are used primarily for speed of swapping, and not for permanent file storage.\nGraphics display.\nThe Type 30 Precision CRT display is a point plotting display device capable of addressing 1024 by 1024 addressable locations at a rate of 20,000 points per second. A special \"Display One Point On CRT\" instruction is used to build up images, which have to be refreshed many times per second. The CRT, which was originally developed for use in radar, is in diameter and uses a long-persistence P7 phosphor. A light pen can be used with the Type 30 to pick points on the display. An optional character generator and hardware for line and curve generation are available.\nComputer music.\nMIT hackers also used the PDP-1 for playing music in four-part harmony, using some special hardware \u2013 four flip-flops directly controlled by the processor (the audio signal is filtered with simple RC filters). Music was prepared via Peter Samson's \"Harmony Compiler\", a sophisticated text-based program with some features specifically oriented toward the efficient coding of baroque music. Several hours of music were prepared for it, including Bach fugues, all of Mozart's \"Eine kleine Nachtmusik\", the \"Ode to Joy\" movement concluding Beethoven's \"Symphony No. 9\", Christmas carols, and numerous popular songs.\nCurrent status.\nOnly three PDP-1 computers are still known to exist, and all three are in the collection of the Computer History Museum (CHM). One is the prototype formerly used at MIT, and the other two are production PDP-1C machines. One of the latter, serial number 55 (the last PDP-1 made) has been restored to working order, is on exhibit, and is demonstrated on two Saturdays every month. The demonstrations include:\nSoftware simulations of the PDP-1 exist in SIMH and MESS, hardware recreation through FPGA exists for the MiSTer project as well, and binary image of paper tapes of the software exist in the bitsavers.org archives.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
