The MC6800 microprocessor was part of the M6800 Microcomputer System (later dubbed \"68xx\") that also included serial and parallel interface ICs, RAM, ROM and other support chips. A significant design feature was that the M6800 family of ICs required only a single five-volt power supply at a time when most other microprocessors required three voltages. The M6800 Microcomputer System was announced in March 1974 and was in full production by the end of that year. American Microsystems was licensed as the second source.\nThe 6800 has a 16-bit address bus that can directly access of memory and an 8-bit bi-directional data bus. It has 72 instructions with seven addressing modes for a total of 197 opcodes. The original MC6800 could have a clock frequency of up to . Later versions had a maximum clock frequency of .\nIn addition to the ICs, Motorola also provided a complete assembly language development system. The customer could use the software on a remote timeshare computer or on an in-house minicomputer system. The Motorola EXORciser was a desktop computer built with the M6800 ICs that could be used for prototyping and debugging new designs. An expansive documentation package included datasheets on all ICs, two assembly language programming manuals, and a 700-page application manual that showed how to design a point-of-sale terminal (a computerized cash register) around the 6800.\nThe 6800 was popular in computer peripherals, test equipment applications and point-of-sale terminals. It has also been used in arcade games and pinball machines. The MC6802, introduced in 1977, included 128 bytes of RAM and an internal clock oscillator on chip. The MC6801 and MC6805 included RAM, ROM and I/O on a single chip and were popular in automotive applications. Some MC6805 models integrated a Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI). The Motorola 6809 was an updated compatible design.\nHistory.\nMotorola's history in semiconductors.\nGalvin Manufacturing Corporation was founded in 1928; the company name was changed to Motorola in 1947. They began commercial production of transistors at a new US$1.5 million facility in Phoenix, Arizona in 1955.\nBy the mid-1960s, Motorola had expanded their semiconductor division under the direction of Lester Hogan. Motorola's transistors and integrated circuits were used in-house for their communication, military, automotive and consumer products and they were also sold to other companies. In 1968, Robert Noyce left Fairchild Semiconductor to found Intel, and Fairchild responded by hiring Hogan as the new CEO. Eight other Motorola employees moved with him, they became known as \"Hogan's heroes\". The resulting chaos was nevertheless short lived, and the company continued to grow through this period.\nBy 1973 the Semiconductor Products Division (SPD) had sales of $419 million and was the second largest semiconductor company after Texas Instruments.\n5065.\nBy the early 1970s it was clear that most of the large companies in the semiconductor space, including Fairchild and the still-new Intel, were planning to introduce microprocessors. Intel began shopping around the initial concept of what would become the Intel 4004, and on their sales trips they visited Victor Comptometer in Chicago looking for potential customers. Victor had introduced the world's first electronic calculator that used integrated circuits, the Victor 3900. There, Tom Bennett saw the design.\nIn 1971, Motorola decided to enter the calculator business. Looking for someone to lead the effort, they hired Bennett away from Victor. Shortly after joining, Olivetti visited Motorola with a outline of a design for a microprocessor they were planning to use in a series of programmable calculators. Motorola agreed to complete the design and produce it on their PMOS lines in Phoenix.\nWhile the design was eventually completed successfully, their fab proved unable to produce the chips. The problems with the line had become obvious with a number of similar failures; it also proved unable to make competitive memory devices and other designs. To save the contract, Motorola licensed the design to their competitor, Mostek, with the requirement that Mostek could only sell outside the calculator market. Mostek then put the design on the market as the Mostek 5065.\nDevelopment team.\nCustomers continued to approach the company with new ideas, and it became increasingly obvious that these concepts could be implemented using a single flexible microprocessor design. A new effort began in late 1971, but in early 1972, the marketing department returned a report stating they could only sell 18,000 over a five year period. Unconvinced, Bennett hired Link Young to try again. Young returned with a potential order for 200,000 from National Data Corporation, more than enough to start design work.\nThe team was composed of designer Tom Bennett, engineering director Jeff LaVell, product marketer Link Young and systems designers Mike Wiles, Gene Schriber and Doug Powell. They were all located in Mesa, Arizona, in greater Phoenix. By the time the project was finished, Bennett had 17 chip designers and layout people working on five chips. LaVell had 15 to 20 system engineers and there was another applications engineering group of similar size.\nTom Bennett had a background in industrial controls and had worked for Victor Comptometer in the 1960s designing the first electronic calculator to use MOS ICs, the Victor 3900. In May 1969 Ted Hoff showed Bennett early diagrams of the Intel 4004 to see if it would meet their calculator needs. Bennett joined Motorola in 1971 to design calculator ICs. He was soon assigned as the chief architect of the microprocessor project that produced the 6800. Others have taken credit for designing the 6800. In September 1975 Robert H. Cushman, \"EDN\" magazine's microprocessor editor, interviewed Chuck Peddle about MOS Technology's new 6502 microprocessor. Cushman then asked \"Tom Bennett, master architect of the 6800\", to comment about this new competitor. After the 6800 project Bennett worked on automotive applications and Motorola became a major supplier of microprocessors used in automobiles.\nJeff LaVell joined Motorola in 1966 and worked in the computer industry marketing organization. LaVell had previously worked for Collins Radio on their C8500 computer that was built with small scale ECL ICs. In 1971, he led a group that examined the needs of their existing customers such as Hewlett-Packard, National Cash Register, Control Data Corporation (CDC), and Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC). They would study the customer's products and try to identify functions that could be implemented in larger integrated circuits at a lower cost. The result of the survey was a family of 15 building blocks; each could be implemented in an integrated circuit. Some of these blocks were implemented in the initial M6800 release and more were added over the next few years. To evaluate the 6800 architecture while the chip was being designed, LaVell's team built an equivalent circuit using 451 small scale TTL ICs on five 10 by 10 inch (25 by 25\u00a0cm) circuit boards. Later they reduced this to 114 ICs on one board by using ROMs and MSI (medium scale integration) logic devices.\nJohn Buchanan was a memory designer at Motorola when Bennett asked him to design a voltage doubler for the 6800. Typical n-channel MOS IC's required three power supplies: \u22125 volts, +5 volts and +12 volts. The M6800 family was to use only one, +5 volts. It was easy to eliminate the \u22125 volt supply by using an internal voltage inverter, but the enhancement-mode logic also needed a supply of 10 to 12 volts. To address this, the design added an on-chip voltage doubler. Buchanan did the circuit design, analysis and layout for the 6800 microprocessor. He received patents on the voltage doubler and the 6800 chip layout. Rod Orgill assisted Buchanan with analyses and 6800 chip layout. Later Orgill would design the MOS Technology 6501 microprocessor that was socket compatible with the 6800.\nBill Lattin joined Motorola in 1969 and his group provided the computer simulation tools for characterizing the new MOS circuits in the 6800. Lattin and Frank Jenkins had both attended UC Berkeley and studied computer circuit simulators under Donald Pederson, the designer of the SPICE circuit simulator. Motorola's simulator, MTIME, was an advanced version of the TIME circuit simulator that Jenkins had developed at Berkeley. The group published a technical paper, \"MOS-device modeling for computer implementation\" in 1973 describing a \"5-V single-supply n-channel technology\" operating at 1\u00a0MHz. They could simulate a 50 MOSFET circuit on an IBM 370/165 mainframe computer. In November 1975, Lattin joined Intel to work on their next generation microprocessor.\nBill Mensch joined Motorola in 1971 after graduating from the University of Arizona. He had worked several years as an electronics technician before earning his BSEE degree. The first year at Motorola was a series of three-month rotations through four different areas. Mensch did a flowchart for a modem that would become the 6860. He also worked the application group that was defining the M6800 system. After this training year, he was assigned to the 6820 Peripheral Interface Adapter (PIA) development team. Mensch was a major contributor to the design of this chip and received a patent on the IC layout and was named as a co-inventor of seven other M6800 system patents. Later Mensch would design the MOS Technology 6502 microprocessor.\nMike Wiles was a design engineer in Jeff LaVell's group and made numerous customer visits with Tom Bennett during 6800 product definition phase. He is listed as an inventor on eighteen 6800 patents but is best known for a computer program, MIKBUG. This was a monitor for a 6800 computer system that allowed the user to examine the contents of RAM and to save or load programs to tape. This 512 byte program occupied half of an MCM6830 ROM. This ROM was used in the Motorola MEK6800 design evaluation kit and early hobby computer kits. Wiles stayed with Motorola, moved to Austin and helped design the MC6801 microcontroller that was released in 1978.\nChuck Peddle joined the design team in 1973 after the 6800 processor design was done but he contributed to overall system design and to several peripheral chips, particularly the 6820 (PIA) parallel interface. Peddle is listed as an inventor on sixteen Motorola patents, most have six or more co-inventors. Like the other engineers on the team, Peddle visited potential customers and solicited their feedback. Peddle and John Buchanan built one of the earliest 6800 demonstration boards. In August 1974, Chuck Peddle left Motorola and joined a small semiconductor company in Pennsylvania, MOS Technology. There he led the team that designed the 6500 microprocessor family.\nMC6800 microprocessor design.\nThe Motorola 6800 and the Intel 8080 were designed at the same time and were similar in function. The 8080 was an extension and enhancement of the Intel 8008, which in turn was an LSI implementation of the TTL-based CPU design used in the Datapoint 2200. The 6800 architecture was a TTL-compatible LSI design modeled after the DEC PDP-11 processor.\nThe 6800 had an 8-bit bidirectional data bus, a 16-bit address bus that could address 64\u00a0KB of memory, and came in a 40-pin DIP package. The 6800 had two 8-bit accumulators, a 16-bit index register, and a 16-bit stack pointer. The direct addressing mode, often known as the zero page in other processors, allowed fast access to the first 256\u00a0bytes of memory. I/O devices were addressed as memory so there were no special I/O instructions. When the 6800 was reset, it loaded the program counter from the highest address and started execution at the memory location stored there.\nThe 6800 had a three-state control that would disable the address bus to allow another device direct memory access. For instance, a floppy disk controller could load data into memory without requiring any support from the CPU. It was even possible to have two 6800 processors access the same memory. However, in practice systems of such complexity usually required the use of external bus transceivers to drive the system bus; in such circuits, the on-processor bus control was disabled entirely in favor of using the similar capabilities of the bus transceiver. In contrast, the 6802 dispensed with this on-chip control entirely in order to free up pins for other functions in the same 40-pin package as the 6800, but this functionality could still be achieved using an external bus transceiver.\nMOS ICs typically used dual clock signals (a two-phase clock) in the 1970s. These were generated externally for the 6800, The 6800 had a minimum clock rate of 100\u00a0kHz, and initially ran at a maximum rate of 1\u00a0MHz. Higher-speed versions of the 6800 were released in 1976.\nOther divisions in Motorola developed components for the M6800 family. The Components Products Department designed the MC6870 two-phase clock IC, and the Memory Products group provided a full line of ROMs and RAMs. The CMOS group's MC14411 Bit Rate Generator provided a 75 to 9600 baud clock for the MC6850 serial interface. The buffers for address and data buses were standard Motorola products. Motorola could supply every IC, transistor, and diode necessary to build an MC6800-based computer.\nMOS ICs.\nThe first-generation metal\u2013oxide\u2013semiconductor (MOS) chips used p-channel field-effect transistors, known as p-channel MOSFETs (p-channel describes the configuration of the transistor). These ICs were used in calculators and in the first microprocessor, the Intel 4004. They were easy to produce but were slow and difficult to interface to the popular TTL digital logic ICs. An n-channel MOS integrated circuit could operate two or three times faster and was compatible with TTL. They were much more difficult to produce because of an increased sensitivity to contamination that required an ultra clean production line and meticulous process control. Motorola did not have an n-channel MOS production capability and had to develop one for the 6800 family.\nMotorola's n-channel MOS test integrated circuits were complete in late 1971 and these indicated the clock rate would be limited to 1\u00a0MHz. These used \"enhancement-mode\" MOS transistors. There was a newer fabrication technology that used \"depletion-mode\" MOS transistors as loads, which would allow smaller and faster circuits (this was also known as depletion-load nMOS). The \"depletion-mode\" processing required extra steps so Motorola decided to stay with \"enhancement-mode\" for the new single-supply-voltage design. The 1\u00a0MHz clock rate meant the chip designers would have to come up with several architectural innovations to speed up the microprocessor throughput. These resulting circuits were faster but required more area on the chip.\nIn the 1970s, semiconductors were fabricated on 3 inch (75\u00a0mm) diameter silicon wafers. Each wafer could produce 100 to 200 integrated circuit chips or dies. The technical literature would state the length and width of each chip in \"mils\" (0.001 inch). The current industry practice is to state the chip area. Processing wafers required multiple steps and flaws would appear at various locations on the wafer during each step. The larger the chip the more likely it would encounter a defect. The percentage of working chips, or yield, declined steeply for chips larger than 160 mils (4\u00a0mm) on a side.\nThe target size for the 6800 was 180 mils (4.6\u00a0mm) on each side but the final size was 212 mils (5.4\u00a0mm) with an area of 29.0\u00a0mm2. At 180 mils, a wafer will hold about 190 chips, 212 mils reduces that to 140 chips. At this size the yield may be 20% or 28 chips per wafer. The Motorola 1975 annual report highlights the new MC6800 microprocessor but has several paragraphs on the \"MOS yield problems.\" \nThe yield problem was solved with a design revision started in 1975 to use depletion mode in the M6800 family devices. The 6800 die size was reduced to 160 mils (4\u00a0mm) per side with an area of 16.5\u00a0mm2. This also allowed faster clock speeds, the MC68A00 would operate at 1.5\u00a0MHz and the MC68B00 at 2.0\u00a0MHz. The new parts were available in July 1976.\nM6800 family introduction.\nThe March 7, 1974 issue of \"Electronics\" had a two-page story on the Motorola MC6800 microprocessor along with the MC6820 Peripheral Interface Adapter, the MC6850 Asynchronous Communications Interface Adapter, the MCM6810 128 byte RAM and the MCM6830 1024 byte ROM. This was followed by an eight-page article in the April 18, 1974 issue, written by the Motorola design team. This issue also had an article introducing the Intel 8080.\nBoth the Intel 8080 and the Motorola MC6800 processors began layout around December 1972. The first working 8080 chips were produced January 1974 and the first public announcement was in February 1974. The 8080 used same three voltage N-channel MOS process as Intel's existing memory chips allowing full production to begin that April.\nThe first working MC6800 chips were produced in February 1974 and engineering samples were given to select customers. Hewlett-Packard in Loveland, Colorado wanted the MC6800 for a new desktop calculator and had a prototype system working by June. The MC6800 used a new single-voltage N-channel MOS process that proved to be very difficult to implement. The M6800 microcomputer system was finally in production by November 1974. Motorola matched Intel's price for single microprocessor, $360. (The IBM System/360 was a well-known computer at this time.) In April 1975 the MEK6800D1 microcomputer design kit was offered for $300. The kit included all six chips in the M6800 family plus application and programming manuals. The price of a single MC6800 microprocessor was $175.\nLink Young was the product marketer that developed the total system approach for the M6800 family release. In addition to releasing a full set of support chips with the 6800 microprocessor, Motorola offered a software and hardware development system. The software development tools were available on remote time-sharing computers or the source code was available so the customer could use an in-house computer system. The software that would run on a microprocessor system was typically written in assembly language. The development system consisted of a text editor, assembler and a simulator. This allowed the developer to test the software before the target system was complete. The hardware development was a desktop computer built with M6800 family CPU and peripherals known as the EXORcisor. Motorola offered a three- to five-day microprocessor design course for the 6800 hardware and software. This systems-oriented approach became the standard way new microprocessor were introduced.\nDesign team breakup.\nThe principal design effort on the M6800 family was complete in mid-1974, and many engineers left the group or the company. Several factors led to the break-up of the design group.\nMotorola had opened a new MOS semiconductor facility in Austin, Texas. The entire engineering team was scheduled to relocate there in 1975. Many of the employees liked living in the Phoenix suburb of Mesa and were very wary about moving to Austin. The team leaders were unsuccessful with their pleas to senior management on deferring the move.\nA recession hit the semiconductor industry in mid-1974 resulting in thousands of layoffs. A November 1974 issue of \"Electronics\" magazine reports that Motorola had laid off 4,500 employees, Texas Instruments 7,000 and Signetics 4,000. Motorola's Semiconductor Products Division would lose thirty million dollars in the next 12 months and there were rumors that the IC group would be sold off. Motorola did not sell the division but they did change the management and organization. By the end of 1974 Intel fired almost a third of its 3,500 employees. The MOS IC business rebounded but job security was not taken for granted in 1974 and 1975.\nChuck Peddle (and other Motorola engineers) had been visiting customers to explain the benefits of microprocessors. Both Intel and Motorola had initially set the price of a single microprocessor at . Many customers were hesitant to adopt this new microprocessor technology with such a high price tag. (The actual price for production quantities was much lower.) In mid-1974 Peddle proposed a simplified microprocessor that could be sold at a much lower price. Motorola's \"total product family\" strategy did not focus on the price of MPU but on reducing the customer's total design cost. Peddle's concept was repeatedly rejected, and eventually management told him to stop talking about it. He wrote a memo stating that these instructions were a clear statement that Motorola was abandoning the concept, meaning they could not claim intellectual property against it.\nPeddle continued working for Motorola while looking for investors for his new microprocessor concept. After approaching Mostek and being rejected, in August 1974 Chuck Peddle left Motorola and joined a small semiconductor company in Pennsylvania, MOS Technology. He was followed by seven other Motorola engineers: Harry Bawcom, Ray Hirt, Terry Holdt, Mike James, Will Mathis, Bill Mensch and Rod Orgill. Peddle's group at MOS Technology developed two new microprocessors that were compatible with the Motorola peripheral chips like the 6820 PIA. Rod Orgill designed the MCS6501 processor that would plug into a MC6800 socket and Bill Mensch did the MCS6502 that had the clock generation circuit on chip. These microprocessors would not run 6800 programs because they had a different architecture and instruction set. The major goal was a microprocessor that would sell for under . This would be done by removing non-essential features to reduce the chip size. An 8-bit stack pointer was used instead of a 16-bit one. The second accumulator was omitted. The address buffers did not have a three-state mode for Direct Memory Access (DMA) data transfers. The goal was to get the chip size down to 153 mils x 168 mils (\u00d7).\nPeddle was a very effective spokesman and the MOS Technology microprocessors were extensively covered in the trade press. One of the earliest was a full-page story on the MCS6501 and MCS6502 microprocessors in the July 24, 1975 issue of \"Electronics\" magazine. Stories also ran in \"EE Times\" (August 24, 1975), \"EDN\" (September 20, 1975), \"Electronic News\" (November 3, 1975) and \"Byte\" (November 1975). Advertisements for the 6501 appeared in several publications the first week of August 1975. The 6501 would be for sale at the WESCON trade show in San Francisco, September 16\u201319, 1975, for each. In September 1975 the advertisements included both the 6501 and the 6502 microprocessors. The 6502 would only cost .\nMotorola responded to MOS Technology's microprocessor by immediately reducing the single-unit price of the 6800 microprocessor from to and then suing MOS Technology in November 1975. Motorola claimed that the eight former Motorola engineers used technical information developed at Motorola in the design of the 6501 and 6502 microprocessors. MOS Technology's other business, calculator chips, was declining due to a price war with Texas Instruments so their financial backer, Allen-Bradley, decided to limit the possible losses and sold the assets of MOS Technology back to the founders. The lawsuit was settled in April 1976 with MOS Technology dropping the 6501 chip that would plug into a Motorola 6800 socket and licensing Motorola's peripheral chips. Motorola reduced the single-unit price of the 6800 to .\nThe MOS Technology vs. Motorola lawsuit has developed a David and Goliath narrative over the years. One point was that Motorola did not have patents on the technology. This was technically true when the lawsuit was filed in late 1975 On October 30, 1974, before the 6800 was released, Motorola filed numerous patents applications on the microprocessor family, and over twenty patents were subsequently granted. The first was to Tom Bennett on June 8, 1976, for the 6800 internal address bus. The second was to Bill Mensch on July 6, 1976, for the 6820 chip layout. Many of these patents named several of the departing engineers as co-inventors. These patents covered the 6800 bus and how the peripheral chips interfaced with the microprocessor.\nMove to Austin.\nGary Daniels was designing ICs for electronic wristwatches when Motorola shut down their Timepiece Electronics Unit. Tom Bennett offered him a job in the microprocessor group in November 1974. Bennett did not want to leave the Phoenix area so Gary Daniels managed the microprocessor development in Austin. (Daniels was the microprocessor design manager for the next ten years before he was promoted to a vice president.)\nThe first task was to redesign the 6800 MPU to improve the manufacturing yield and to operate at a faster clock. This design used depletion-mode technology and was known internally as the MC6800D. The transistor count went from 4000 to 5000 but the die area was reduced from 29.0\u00a0mm2 to 16.5\u00a0mm2 (allowing the price of the CPU to be lowered to $35). The maximum clock rate for selected parts doubled to 2\u00a0MHz. The other chips in the M6800 family were also redesigned to use depletion-mode technology. The Peripheral Interface Adapter had a slight change in the electrical characteristics of the I/O pins so the MC6820 became the MC6821. These new IC were completed in July 1976.\nA new low-cost clock generator chip, the MC6875, was released in 1977. It replaced the $35 MC6870 hybrid IC. The MC6875 came in a 16-pin dip package and could use quartz crystal or a resistor capacitor network.\nAnother project was incorporating 128 bytes of RAM and the clock generator on a single 11,000-transistor chip. The MC6802 microprocessor was released in March 1977. The companion MC6846 chip had 2048 byte ROM, an 8-bit bidirectional port and a programmable timer. This was a two-chip microcomputer. The 6802 has an on-chip oscillator that uses an external 4\u00a0MHz quartz crystal to produce the two-phase 1\u00a0MHz clock. The internal 128 byte RAM could be disabled by grounding a pin and devices with defective RAM were sold as a MC6808. The 6808 was rarely used as the main microprocessor on general-purpose computers, being more popular in embedded systems (the 1979 ACFA-8 microcomputer proved an exception).\nA series of peripheral chip were introduced by 1978. The MC6840 programmable counter had three 16-bit binary counters that could be used for frequency measurement, event counting, or interval measurement. The MC6844 Direct Memory Access Controller could transfer data from an I/O controller to RAM without loading down the MC6800 microprocessor. The MC6845 CRT Controller (CRTC) provided the control logic for a character based computer terminal. The 6845 had support for a light pen, an alternative to a computer mouse.\nThe MC6845 was a very popular chip: it was even used in the original IBM Monochrome Display Adapter and the original IBM Color Graphics Adapter for the IBM PC and successors, where the 6845 was used with an Intel 8088 CPU. During the time of cold war technology embargoes, a 6845 clone named CM607 was produced in Bulgaria. The later IBM Enhanced Graphics Adapter (EGA) card contained a custom IBM chip (the EGA CRTC) that replaced the Motorola 6845, adding many enhancements, in a mostly-compatible way. The IBM Video Graphics Array (VGA), which became ubiquitous (to the point that it is still emulated as the baseline functionality of most modern PC video adapter chips) incorporates a compatible near-superset of the EGA CRTC, still mostly-compatible with the MC6845 (but by this point without the light pen support, which the EGA CRTC retained).\nThe MC6801 was a single-chip microcomputer (that today would also be called a microcontroller) incorporating a 6802 CPU with 128\u00a0bytes of RAM, a 2\u00a0KB ROM, a 16-bit timer, 31 programmable parallel I/O lines, and a serial port. (The MC6803 was the same except without the ROM and with fewer different bus configurations.) It could also use the I/O lines as data and address buses to connect to standard M6800 peripherals. The 6801 would execute 6800 code, but it had ten additional instructions, and the execution time of key instructions was reduced. The two 8-bit accumulators could act as a single 16-bit accumulator for double precision addition, subtraction and multiplication. It was initially designed for automotive use, with General Motors as the lead customer. The first application was a trip computer for the 1978 Cadillac Seville. This 35,000 transistor chip was too expensive for wide-scale adoption in automobiles, so a reduced function MC6805 single-chip microcomputer was designed.\nThe MC6801 was one of the first microprocessors with a multiply instruction.\nThe Hitachi HD6303 (not to be confused with the Hitachi 6309) is a second-source reimplementation of the Motorola MC6803, with a few additional instructions, and a slightly faster implementation of the 8x8 multiply instruction. The Hitachi HD6303 is used in the first PDA, the 1984 Psion Organiser.\nThe Hitachi HD6303 was also used in the 1983 \"Pocket Telex\".\nThe Motorola MC6803 was also used in the TRS-80 MC-10 and the closely related Matra Alice.\nThe MC6809 was the most advanced 8-bit microprocessor Motorola produced. It had a new instruction set that was similar to the 6800 but abandoned op-code compatibility for improved performance and high-level language support; the 6809 and 6800 were software compatible in that assemblers could (and generally did) generate code which was equivalent to 6800 opcodes that the 6809 did not directly emulate. In that sense, the 6809 was upward compatible with the 6800. The 6809 had two 16-bit index registers, two 16-bit stack pointers, and many instructions to perform 16-bit operations, including the first 8-bit multiply instruction (generating a 16-bit product) in a microprocessor. Other key points of the 6809 design were full support for both position-independent code (object code that can run wherever it is loaded in memory) and reentrant code (object code that can be re-invoked when interrupted or by calling itself recursively), features previously seen only in much larger machines such as IBM 360 mainframes.\nUse in personal computers.\nThe MITS Altair 8800, the first successful personal computer, used the Intel 8080 microprocessor and was featured on the January 1975 cover of \"Popular Electronics\". The first personal computers using the Motorola 6800 were introduced in late 1975. Sphere Corporation of Bountiful, Utah ran a quarter-page advertisement in the July 1975 issue of \"Radio-Electronics\" for a $650 USD computer kit with a 6800 microprocessor, 4 kilobytes of RAM, a video board and a keyboard. This would display 16 lines of 32 characters on a TV or monitor. The Sphere computer kits began shipping in November 1975. \nSouthwest Technical Products Corporation of San Antonio, Texas, officially announced their SWTPC 6800 Computer System in November 1975. Wayne Green visited SWTPC in August 1975 and described the SWTPC computer kit complete with photos of a working system in the October 1975 issue of \"73\". The SWTPC 6800 was based on the Motorola MEK6800 design evaluation kit chip set and used the MIKBUG ROM Software. \nThe MITS Altair 680 was on the cover of the November 1975 issue of \"Popular Electronics\". The Altair 680 used a 6800 microprocessor and, unlike the SWTPC machine, also had a front panel with toggle switches and LEDs. The initial design had to be revised and first deliveries of the Altair 680B were in April 1976.\nSphere was a small startup company and had difficulties delivering all of the products they announced. They filed for a Chapter 11 bankruptcy in April 1977. The Altair 680B was popular but MITS focused most of the resources on their Altair 8800 computer system and they exited the hobby market in 1978. The Southwest Technical Products computer was the most successful 6800 based personal computer. Other companies, for instance, Smoke Signal Broadcasting (California), Gimix (Chicago), Midwest Scientific (Olathe, Kansas), and Helix Systems (Hazelwood, Missouri), started producing SWTPC 6800 bus compatible boards and complete systems. Technical Systems Consultants of West Lafayette, Indiana, supplied tape based software for the 6800 (and later 6809) based computers and, after disk systems became available, operating systems and disk software as well. The 8080 systems were far more popular than the 6800 ones.\nThe Tektronix 4051 Graphics Computing System was introduced in October 1975. This was a professional desktop computer that had a 6800 microprocessor with up to 32\u00a0KB of user RAM, 300\u00a0KB magnetic tape storage, BASIC in ROM and a 1024 by 780 graphics display. The Tektronix 4051 sold for (), rather higher than the personal computers using the 6800.\nThe 6800 processor was also used in the APF MP1000 game console. The Matsushita JR series used a Panasonic MN1800A NMOS microprocessor, compatible with the MC6802.\nHP introduced the 9815A desktop calculator based on the 6800 in 1975. All HP's other machines at the time used their own processor designs. It was fitted with 16k of ROM and 2k of RAM with optional IO expansion and RAM expansion to 4k. A later 9815S included both options as standard.\nThe architecture and instruction set of the 6800 were easy for beginners to understand and Heathkit developed a microprocessor course and the ET3400 6800 trainer. The course and trainer proved popular with individuals and schools.\nMotorola's next generation 8-bit microprocessor architecture, the MC6809 (1979), was not binary code compatible with the 6800, but nearly all assembly code would assemble and run on the 6809; 6800 family peripheral chips worked as a matter of course.\nExample code.\nThe following 6800 assembly language source code is for a subroutine named codice_1 that copies a block of data bytes of a given size from one location to another. The data block is copied one byte at a time, from lowest address to highest.\ncnt dw $0000 ; sets aside space for memory addr\nsrc dw $0000 ; sets aside space for memory addr\ndst dw $0000 ; sets aside space for memory addr\nmemcpy public\n ldab cnt+1 ;Set B = cnt.L\n beq check ;If cnt.L=0, goto check\nloop ldx src ;Set IX = src\n ldaa ix ;Load A from (src)\n inx ;Set src = src+1\n stx src\n ldx dst ;Set IX = dst\n staa ix ;Store A to (dst)\n inx ;Set dst = dst+1\n stx dst\n decb ;Decr B\n bne loop ;Repeat the loop\ncheck tst cnt+0 ;If cnt.H=0,\n beq done ;Then quit\n dec cnt+0 ;Decr cnt.H\n ; loop back and do 256*(cnt.H+1) more copies (B=0) \n bra loop ;Repeat the loop\ndone rts ;Return\nPeripherals.\nList from \"Motorola Microcomputer Components\", November 1978. Memory-mapped I/O is used, and I/O ports are mapped to part of the main memory address space.\nSecond sources.\nA common requirement for manufacturing companies was to require two or more sources for every part in the products they made. This ensured they could get parts if a supplier had financial problems or a disaster. Initially Motorola selected American Microsystems Inc (AMI) as a second source for the M6800 family. Hitachi, Fujitsu, Fairchild, Rockwell and Thomson Semiconductors were added later. \nRochester Electronics was authorized by Freescale/Motorola in 2014 to continue manufacturing any of the 8-bit peripherals and 8-bit processors of this era. Rochester specializes in fully authorized device duplication. Freescale has provided all the source design archives to enable Rochester Electronics for this product and others. At the end of 2016, Rochester was fully qualified and shipping the MC6802 processor, the MC6840 PTM, and the MC6809 processor (including the MC68A09, and MC68B09 versions) and can still be bought today.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "20302", "revid": "1934512", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20302", "title": "Motorola 68020", "text": "32-bit microprocessor by Motorola\nThe Motorola 68020 is a 32-bit microprocessor from Motorola, released in 1984. A lower-cost version was also made available, known as the 68EC020. In keeping with naming practices common to Motorola designs, the 68020 is usually referred to as the \"020\", pronounced \"oh-two-oh\" or \"oh-twenty\".\nThe 020 was in the market for a relatively short time. The Motorola 68030 was announced in September 1986 and began deliveries in the summer of 1987. Priced about the same as the 020 of the time, the 030 was significantly faster and quickly replaced in 020 in almost every use.\nHistory.\n68000 and 68010.\nAt the time the Motorola 68000 was designed, Motorola's design and fabrication services were outdated. Although even small companies like MOS Technology and Zilog had moved on to silicon gate depletion mode NMOS logic on ever-larger wafers, Motorola was still using metal gates and enhancement mode and their largest fab worked on 4-inch wafers long after most lines had moved to 5-inch. Although the 68000 met the goal of being the fastest CPU available when it was introduced, it was not nearly as powerful as it could be if it had been designed with more modern techniques.\nDuring the period of the 68000 design, the company was working with Hitachi on their process technology and as part of this they opened a new fab, MOS-8, using 5-inch wafers and the latest HMOS process licensed from Intel. This line was capable of building all of the new techniques, but the 68000 went ahead with the older design as they were sure it would work. Moving to new design techniques would wait until the design was in the market. The conversion to the new design techniques took place during the Motorola 68010 effort, a relatively minor upgrade to the original design that added basic virtual memory support for the emerging Unix workstation market.\n020 concept emerges.\nAs this effort was ongoing, Motorola was canvassing their customers for their desires for future developments in the line. These all pointed to a fully 32-bit implementation. Those using the 68k in Unix systems also stated they would purchase a floating-point unit for every one of the machines if one was available.\nThe original 68000 had been designed as a hybrid 16/32-bit system largely because the maximum number of pins available on dual inline packages (DIPs) was 64, and even at that size, packaging of this size was highly problematic. By reducing the number of address pins to 24, and the data pins to only 16, there were enough free pins to implement all the other needed lines, like interrupts and power supplies. The 24-pin address bus meant that the memory could only be 16\u00a0MB in total, which was at this point becoming a limitation. The 16-bit data bus meant reading a 32-bit word from that memory required two bus cycles.\nA design that had 32 pins for both the address and data busses would access data twice as fast, making the machine that much faster even with no other changes. Moving to 32-bit addressing would also make the implementation of virtual memory easier, and allow for more than 16\u00a0MB of random access memory. But doing so would also demand a much higher total pin count. By the early 1980s, similar limitations on all modern CPU designs led to the introduction of the pin grid array that replaced the DIP. For the new project, Motorola selected a 169-pin layout, giving them plenty of room to work with. The design ultimately used only 114 of them.\nA great debate broke out about how to refer to the underlying design of the new chip in marketing materials. Technically, the 020 was moving from the long-established NMOS logic design to a CMOS layout, which requires two transistors per gate. Common knowledge of the era suggested that CMOS cost four times as much as NMOS, and there was a significant amount of the market that believed \"CMOS equals bad.\"\nLaunch, fabrication problems.\nThe design was completed in the summer of 1983 and announced in June 1984. This \"super chip\" was significant news at the time, with the New York Times making it a lead story in their business section. The launch price was quoted at $487 each, about the same as the 68000 when it was launched in 1980, but the 68000 was now available for about $15. However, it was understood that it would be some time before computers using the new chip would be available, as existing designs would have to be heavily modified to take advantage of its performance.\nThe announcement led to Motorola's customers clamouring for supply. At this point, serious supply problems became evident. The design had been laid out to be built in the same MOS-8 factory as the 68000, although several new pieces of equipment were introduced to support it. By the time of the public release, the yield for the new chip was zero. That is, for every wafer sent through the multi-step process, zero working chips would be produced.\nGary Johnson concluded the problem was the floor manager of MOS-8, Tom Felesi, and decided to replace him with Bill Walker, who was at that time running the older MOS-2 factory. Walker arrived at the plant on 5 July 1985 to find Johnson had not bothered to tell Felesi of the change, and arguments followed. Johnson eventually told Felesi this was indeed happening. Walker then toured the plant and found it had been turned into what was essentially a research and development lab, not a production line, with numerous bits of machinery in use nowhere else.\nOne significant issue was a new piece of equipment from a new vendor, Genus, which produced tungsten silicide. The machine simply didn't work. Walker flew to California to meet with the CEO of Genus, who offered up nothing but excuses. Walker eventually slammed his hand down on the desk, breaking his watch band, and stated \"No more excuses! I want this thing fixed now, today!\" Genus took the demand seriously and fixed the machine. The CEO later sent Walker a new watch band to commemorate the event.\nMeanwhile, Walker instituted a new policy at MOS-8 to improve the plant itself. He normally called meetings at 6:30 AM. If things were not going well, he would move that up to 5:30, and even 4:30. This provided a strong incentive to get the plant running. The production problems were soon ironed out, and volume deliveries began late that year. By this point, their workstation customers had already developed complete systems ready to use the 020 and the new floating point unit, the Motorola 68881. Systems were in the market only five or six months after the 020 had been announced.\nReplacement.\nDesign of the 020's follow-on began almost immediately. As part of their ongoing work with Hitachi, Motorola's fabrication system was finally catching up with the competition, as was their internal design workflow. This gave them considerably more room to work with, allowing the addition of larger processor caches, a built-in memory management unit (MMU) and other features. The Motorola 68030 was announced in September 1986, with deliveries to begin the next summer. Due to the changes in the production lines, the new 030 would have a lower launch price than the 020.\nThere were significant differences between the 68000 and 020, especially the 32-bit memory interface. This required computer designs using it to be considerably different from earlier models. In contrast, there were few changes between the 020 and 030, the latter of which could be used as a drop-in replacement in many roles. For this reason, designs using the 030 appeared much more quickly after its release than the 020. The first Macintosh with the 020 was the Macintosh II released in March 1987, two years after the 020 had become widely available, with low-volume initial shipments starting two months later. Only eighteen months later, the Macintosh IIx replaced it, using the 030. Although it ran at the same 16\u00a0MHz clock speed, the IIx offered 3.9\u00a0MIPS compared to the II's 2.6.\nDescription.\nThe 68020 has 32-bit internal and external data and address buses, compared to the early 680x0 models with 16-bit data and 24-bit address buses. The 68020's ALU is also natively 32-bit, so can perform 32-bit operations in one clock cycle, whereas the 68000 took a minimum of two clock cycles due to its 16-bit ALU. Newer packaging methods allowed the '020 to feature more external pins without the large size that the earlier dual in-line package method required. The 68EC020 lowered cost through a 24-bit address bus. The 68020 was produced at speeds ranging from 12\u00a0MHz to 33\u00a0MHz.\nImprovements over the 68010.\nThe 68020 has a 32-bit arithmetic logic unit (ALU), 32-bit external data and address buses. It adds extra instructions and additional addressing modes. The 68020 (and 68030) has a proper three-stage pipeline. Though the 68010 had a \"loop mode\", which sped loops through what was effectively a tiny instruction cache, it held only two short instructions and was thus little used. The 68020 replaced this with a proper instruction cache of 256 bytes, the first 68k series processor to feature true on-chip cache memory.\nThe previous 68000 and 68010 processors could only access word (16-bit) and long word (32-bit) data in memory if it were word-aligned (located at an even address). The 68020 has no alignment restrictions on data access. Naturally, unaligned accesses are slower than aligned accesses because they required an extra memory access.\nThe 68020 has a small 256-byte direct-mapped instruction cache, arranged as 64 four-byte entries. Although small, it still made a significant difference in the performance of many applications. The resulting decrease in bus traffic was particularly important in systems relying heavily on DMA.\nCoprocessor support.\nThe 68020 has a coprocessor interface supporting up to eight coprocessors. The main CPU recognizes \"F-line\" instructions (with the four most significant opcode bits all one), and uses special bus cycles to interact with a coprocessor to execute these instructions. Two types of coprocessors were defined: floating point units (MC68881 or MC68882 FPUs) and the paged memory management unit (MC68851 PMMU). Only one PMMU can be used with a CPU. In principle, multiple FPUs could be used with a CPU, but it was not commonly done. The coprocessor interface is asynchronous, so it is possible to run the coprocessors at a different clock rate than the CPU.\nMultiprocessing features.\nMultiprocessing support is implemented externally by the use of an RMC pin to indicate an indivisible read-modify-write cycle in progress. All other processors have to hold off memory accesses until the cycle is complete. Software support for multiprocessing includes the TAS, CAS and CAS2 instructions.\nIn a multiprocessor system, coprocessors could not be shared between CPUs. To avoid problems with returns from coprocessor, bus error, and address error exceptions, it was generally necessary in a multiprocessor system for all CPUs to be the same model, and for all FPUs to be the same model as well.\nInstruction set.\nThe new instructions include some minor improvements and extensions to the supervisor state, several instructions for software management of a multiprocessing system (which were removed in the 68060), some support for high-level languages which did not get used much (and was removed from future 680x0 processors), bigger multiply (32\u00d732\u219264 bits) and divide (64\u00f732\u219232 bits quotient and 32 bits remainder) instructions, and bit field manipulations.\nThe new addressing modes add scaled indexing and another level of indirection to many of the pre-existing modes.\nArchitecture.\nWith full 32-bit internal and external address buses, the address registers (A0 through A7) could utilize their full 32-bit width, and were capable of addressing the entire 4\u00a0GB address space.\nThe larger effective widths of the address registers presented some problem for earlier software that was not considered \"32-bit clean\". Some programs used the high 8 bits (bits 24-31) of addresses to contain various flag bits, with the understanding that the earlier 680x0 CPUs would safely ignore these high bits. Such software had to be rewritten to adjust to the larger physical address space available to the 68020 and later CPUs.\nUsage.\nThe 68020 was used in the Apple Macintosh II and Macintosh LC personal computers, Sun-3 workstations, Amiga 1200 (68EC020 variant), the Hewlett-Packard 8711 Series Network Analyzers, HP 9000/320, HP 9000/330, Apollo Computer's DN3000 and DN4000 workstations, and the Alpha Microsystems AM-2000. The 68020 was an alternative upgrade to the Sinclair QL's 68008 in the Super Gold Card interface by Miracle Systems.\nThe Amiga 2500 and A2500UX optionally shipped with the A2620 Accelerator using a 68020, 68881 FPU and 68851 MMU. The 2500UX shipped with Amiga Unix, requiring an '020 or '030 processor.\nA number of digital oscilloscopes from the mid-80s to the late-90s used the 68020, including the LeCroy 9300 Series (higher end models including \"C\" suffix models used the more powerful 68EC030; the 9300 models with a 68020 processor can be upgraded to the 68EC030 with a change of the CPU board) and the earlier LeCroy 9400 series (all models excluding the 9400/9400A which used the 68000), along with certain Tektronix TDS Series models. The HP 54520, 54522, 54540 and 54542 also use the 68020, together with a 68882 FPU.\nIt is also the processor used on TGV trains to decode signalling information sent to the trains through the rails. It is used in the flight control and radar systems of the Eurofighter Typhoon combat aircraft.\nThe Nortel Networks DMS-100 telephone central office switch also used the 68020 as the first microprocessor of the SuperNode computing core.\nVariant.\nThe 68EC020 is a lower cost version of the Motorola 68020. The main difference is that the 68EC020 only has a 24-bit address bus, rather than the 32-bit address bus of the full 68020, and thus is only able to address 16\u00a0MB of memory.\nThe Amiga 1200 computer and the Amiga CD32 game console use the cost-reduced 68EC020; the Namco System 22, Taito F3 and Konami GX arcade boards also used this processor. The Atari Jaguar II prototype featured this to replace the 68000 of the original Atari Jaguar console. \nIt also found use in laser printers. Apple used it in the LaserWriter II\u0274\u1d1bx. Kodak used it in the Ektaplus 7016PS, and Dataproducts used it in the LZR 1260.\nIn 2014, Rochester Electronics re-established manufacturing capability for the 68020 microprocessor and it is still available today.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "20303", "revid": "36265633", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20303", "title": "The Muppets", "text": "Puppet characters created by Jim Henson\nThe Muppets are an American ensemble cast of puppet characters known for an absurdist, slapstick, burlesque, and self-referential style of musical variety-sketch comedy. Created by Jim Henson in 1955, the eponymous media franchise encompasses films, television, music, and other media associated with the characters. Owned by the Jim Henson Company for nearly five decades, the Muppets were acquired by the Walt Disney Company in 2004.\nThe Muppets originated in the short-form television series \"Sam and Friends\", which aired on WRC-TV and in syndication from 1955 to 1961. Following appearances on late-night talk shows and in advertising during the 1960s, the Muppets began appearing on \"Sesame Street\" (1969\u2013present) during their formative years in the early to mid-1970s and attained celebrity status and international recognition through \"The Muppet Show\" (1976\u20131981), their flagship sketch comedy television series that received four Primetime Emmy Award wins and 21 nominations during its five-year run.\nDuring the late 1970s and 1980s, the Muppets diversified into theatrical films, including \"The Muppet Movie\" (1979), \"The Great Muppet Caper\" (1981), and \"The Muppets Take Manhattan\" (1984). Additionally, new Muppet characters were created for \"Fraggle Rock\" (1983\u20131987). Disney began involvement with the Muppets in the late 1980s, during which Henson entered negotiations to sell the Jim Henson Company.\nThe Muppets continued their media presence on television with series such as \"The Jim Henson Hour\" (1989) and \"Muppets Tonight\" (1996\u20131998), both of which were similar in format to \"The Muppet Show\", as well as the animated spin-off \"Muppet Babies\" (1984\u20131991); three theatrical films: \"The Muppet Christmas Carol\" (1992), \"Muppet Treasure Island\" (1996) and \"Muppets from Space\" (1999); and the television film \"It's a Very Merry Muppet Christmas Movie\" (2002).\nDisney bought the Muppets and \"Bear in the Big Blue House\" from the Henson family in February 2004 and manages the characters through the Muppets Studio, though the deal excluded the \"Sesame Street\" and \"Fraggle Rock\" characters. Subsequent projects have included the television film \"The Muppets' Wizard of Oz\" (2005), two theatrical films: \"The Muppets\" (2011) and \"Muppets Most Wanted\" (2014), a primetime series (2015\u20132016), the Halloween special \"Muppets Haunted Mansion\" (2021), and most recently the streaming television series \"The Muppets Mayhem\" (2023).\nThroughout seven decades, the Muppets have been regarded as a staple of the entertainment industry and popular culture in the United States and English-speaking areas around the world. They have been recognized by various cultural institutions and organizations, including the American Film Institute, the Hollywood Walk of Fame, the Library of Congress, and both Academies of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and Television Arts and Sciences.\nHistory.\n1950s\u20131960s: Beginnings.\nThe Muppets were created by puppeteer Jim Henson in the 1950s; Henson claimed that he coined the term \"Muppet\" as a portmanteau of the words \"marionette\" and \"puppet\". Among Henson's earliest creations was Kermit the Frog, who became his most recognizable character. Originally conceived for an adult audience, the Muppets were introduced in 1955 in \"Sam and Friends\", a short-form television series produced for WRC-TV in Washington, D.C. Developed by Henson and his future wife, Jane Nebel, the series was the first form of puppet media not to incorporate a physical proscenium arch typical of such works, relying instead on the natural framing of the television set through which it was viewed.\nDuring the 1960s, the characters\u2014in particular, Kermit and Rowlf the Dog\u2014appeared in skits on several late-night talk shows and on television commercials, including \"The Ed Sullivan Show\". Rowlf became the first Muppet character to appear regularly on network television when he began appearing with Jimmy Dean on \"The Jimmy Dean Show\". In 1966, Joan Ganz Cooney and Lloyd Morrisett began developing a children's educational television program and approached Henson to design a cast of Muppet characters during this stage. Produced by the Children's Television Workshop, the program debuted as \"Sesame Street\" in 1969 on NET, and later PBS.\nHenson and his creative team became closely involved with \"Sesame Street\" during the years that followed; Henson waived his performance fee in exchange for retaining ownership rights to the Muppet characters created for the program. \"Sesame Street\" garnered a positive response, and the Muppets' involvement in the series was said to be a vital component of its increasing popularity, providing an \"effective and pleasurable viewing\" method of presentation for its educational curriculum.\n1970s: \"The Muppet Show\" and foray into film.\nIn the early 1970s, the Muppets continued their presence in television, primarily appearing in \"The Land of Gorch\" segments during the first season of NBC's \"Saturday Night Live\". The Muppet characters featured in \"The Land of Gorch\" behaved boorishly and made frequent references to drug abuse, sexual activity, and consumption of alcohol, adult themes that Henson wanted to explore with the characters in an effort to not let him nor the Muppets be typecast as entertainment for children. The writers of \"Saturday Night Live\" clashed with Henson's vision for the program, often refusing to commit to writing the segments, and several cast members bemoaned the inclusion of the Muppets. Eventually, the collaboration proved too divisive, and the Muppets departed \"Saturday Night Live\" after the first season.\nAs his involvement with \"Sesame Street\" continued, Henson began developing a network television series featuring the Muppets, but distinct from \"Sesame Street\"; this series would be aimed at a more adult audience and would satirize sketch comedy. Two television pilots, \"The Muppets Valentine Show\" and \"\", aired on ABC in 1974 and 1975, respectively.\nAfter ABC passed on the pilots and other networks in the United States expressed little interest in the project, British producer Lew Grade approached Henson and agreed to co-produce the series for Associated Television. Debuting in 1976, \"The Muppet Show\" introduced new characters such as Miss Piggy, Fozzie Bear, and Gonzo, alongside existing characters such as Kermit and Rowlf. Aired in first-run syndication in the United States, \"The Muppet Show\" became increasingly popular due to its sketch-variety format, unique form of vaudeville-style humor, and prolific roster of guest stars. It was nominated for twenty-one Primetime Emmy Awards during its run, winning four, including Outstanding Variety Series in 1978. The success of \"The Muppet Show\" allowed Henson Associates to diversify into theatrical films, the first of which, \"The Muppet Movie\", was released in 1979.\n1980s\u20131990s: Subsequent projects.\nFollowing \"The Muppet Movie\" were \"The Great Muppet Caper\" and \"The Muppets Take Manhattan\", released in 1981 and 1984, respectively. Collectively, the three films received four Academy Award nominations. \"The Muppet Show\" ended its five-season run in 1981. In 1983, Henson debuted \"Fraggle Rock\", which aired on HBO in the United States until 1987.\nIn 1989, Henson entered negotiations with Michael Eisner and the Walt Disney Company, in which Disney would acquire Jim Henson Productions and, in turn, the Muppets. Disney expressed interest in purchasing the company for $150 million. Eisner was also interested in acquiring the \"Sesame Street\" Muppet characters, but Henson declined that proposal, considering it a \"non-starter\" for the deal. An \"agreement in principle\" for the acquisition was publicly announced by Disney and Henson at the Disney-MGM Studios theme park in Walt Disney World Resort on August 28, 1989, along with plans for Muppets-themed attractions to debut at that park and Disneyland the following year. In anticipation of the acquisition, the television special \"The Muppets at Walt Disney World\" premiered on May 6, 1990.\nHowever, the proposed merger was cancelled after Henson's death on May 16, 1990. Nevertheless, Disney initiated a licensing agreement with Jim Henson Productions to continue developing Muppets attractions and the use of the characters within the Disney theme parks. The following year, \"Muppet*Vision 3D\" debuted at Disney\u2013MGM Studios, the only attraction successfully developed from the original plans. Walt Disney Pictures also co-produced the fourth and fifth Muppets films, \"The Muppet Christmas Carol\" (1992) and \"Muppet Treasure Island\" (1996), with Jim Henson Productions. The characters subsequently starred in \"Muppets Tonight\", which aired on ABC from 1996 to 1998; and a sixth film, \"Muppets from Space\", released by Columbia Pictures in 1999.\n2000s: Disney acquisition.\nIn 2000, the Jim Henson Company was sold to EM.TV &amp; Merchandising AG for $680 million. However, EM.TV's stock collapsed and the Henson family re-acquired the company in 2003, with the exception of the \"Sesame Street\" characters, which were in the interim sold to Sesame Workshop.\nFourteen years after negotiations began, Disney acquired the Muppets intellectual property from the Henson company for $75 million on February 17, 2004. The acquisition consisted of a majority of the Muppet film and television library, as well as the \"Bear in the Big Blue House\" television series. Exceptions included the \"Sesame Street\" characters; the \"Fraggle Rock\" characters, which were retained by Henson; the distribution rights to four films: \"The Muppets Take Manhattan\", \"Muppets from Space\", and \"Kermit's Swamp Years\", which were retained by Sony Pictures Entertainment; and \"It's a Very Merry Muppet Christmas Movie\", retained by NBCUniversal Television Distribution. Following the acquisition, Disney formed the Muppets Studio (originally The Muppets Holding Company), a wholly owned subsidiary responsible for managing the characters and franchise. As a result, the term \"Muppet\" became a legal trademark of Disney; under license from Disney, Sesame Workshop continues to use the term for their characters, as well as archival footage of Kermit the Frog.\nHenson retained the rights to several productions featuring the Disney-owned Muppet characters, including \"Emmet Otter's Jug-Band Christmas\", \"The Christmas Toy\", \"\", \"Henson's Place\", \"Billy Bunny's Animal Songs\", the original \"Dog City\" special, and \"Donna's Day\". While some of these have since been released uncut, most current releases of \"Emmet Otter's Jug-Band Christmas\" and \"The Christmas Toy\" omit the appearances by Kermit the Frog. The 2015 ABC Family airing, the 2017 DVD and the 2018 Blu-ray releases of \"Emmet Otter's Jug-Band Christmas\" and the Amazon Prime Video release of \"The Christmas Toy\" reinstate Kermit's scenes.\nAfter the acquisition was complete, Disney gradually began reintroducing the franchise to the mainstream, synergistically promoting the Muppets across different parts of the company. The Muppets made appearances on Disney Channel and starred in the ABC television film \"The Muppets' Wizard of Oz\" (2005). A television special, \"\", premiered on NBC on December 17, 2008. As a method of regaining a wider audience, Disney produced a series of vignettes for YouTube and Disney.com. A cover version of Queen's \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" was among these projects and immediately went viral, ultimately amassing 90 million views and winning two Webby Awards. In 2010, the Muppets starred in \"The Muppets Kitchen with Cat Cora\", which co-starred Cat Cora and showcased cooking demonstrations. That same year, Disney used the Muppets to promote their volunteerism program at the company's theme parks. A Halloween special featuring the Muppets was developed during that time and expected to air on ABC that October, but was canceled.\n2010s\u2013present: Renewed success; current projects.\nIn 2011, the Muppets were featured in an eponymous seventh film, \"The Muppets\", intended to serve as a \"creative reboot\" for the characters. Walt Disney Pictures had been furthering development on a Muppets film since 2008, when it considered adapting an unused screenplay by Jerry Juhl. Directed by James Bobin, written by Jason Segel and Nicholas Stoller, and starring Segel, Amy Adams, Chris Cooper, and Rashida Jones, \"The Muppets\" was a critical and commercial success, becoming the highest-grossing puppet film of all time and winning the Academy Award for Best Original Song for Bret McKenzie's \"Man or Muppet\". During the film's publicity campaign, the Muppets appeared in promotional advertisements and marketing efforts by Disney and were also featured in a promotional video for Google+. In March 2012, the Muppets received a collective star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. That year, the Muppets hosted a \"Just for Laughs\" comedy gala in Montreal.\nFollowing the release of \"The Muppets\", Disney announced an eighth film in 2012, with Bobin and Stoller returning to direct and write, respectively. \"Muppets Most Wanted\" was released in 2014 and starred Ricky Gervais, Tina Fey, and Ty Burrell. The film received positive reviews but was a commercial disappointment at the box office.\nDisney Theatrical Productions announced in 2013 that a live show based on the Muppets was in active development and that a 15-minute show had been conducted by Thomas Schumacher to see how the technical components would work. \"Muppet Moments\", an interstitial television series, premiered on Disney Jr. in April 2015. The short-form series features conversations between the Muppets and young children.\nAfter the release of \"Muppets Most Wanted\", Disney was interested in expanding the Muppets' presence across other media, particularly in television. Discussions for a new primetime series began internally within The Muppets Studio. By April 2015, Bill Prady was commissioned to write a script for a pilot with the working title \"Muppets 2015\". In May 2015, ABC commissioned an eponymous series, co-developed by Prady and Bob Kushell and directed by Randall Einhorn. Developed as a parody of other mockumentary-style series such as \"The Office\", \"Modern Family\", and \"Parks and Recreation\", \"The Muppets\" portrayed the everyday personal and professional lives of the Muppets in Los Angeles as they produced a late-night talk show hosted by Miss Piggy. The ABC series portrayed the characters in more adult situations than previous incarnations, including depictions of alcohol consumption, sexual innuendos, and mild profanity. The series premiered on September 22, 2015, in the United States, and received mixed reviews, with critics praising the show's adult humor but criticizing the writing and characterization. \"The Muppets\" was canceled after one season, which concluded on March 1, 2016.\nOn September 24, 2016, The Muppets were featured in a benefit concert called \"Puppets for Puppetry,\" hosted by the Jim Henson Company for the Center for Puppetry Arts. This concert honored puppeteer Dave Goelz and celebrated the 30th anniversary of \"Labyrinth\". Musical guests Gerard Way and Ray Toro of My Chemical Romance, along with Jarrod Alexander, Matt Gorney, and Jamie Muhoberac performed a tribute to \"Labyrinth\" with a medley of songs including \"Underground\" and \"As the World Falls Down\".\nIn September 2017, the Muppets performed a live concert series at the Hollywood Bowl, hosted by Bobby Moynihan. This performance was followed by a second event in July 2018 at London's O2 Arena, their first outside of the United States.\nIn February 2018, Disney announced that a streaming television reboot series was in development for Disney+. The project, known as \"Muppets Live Another Day\", was intended as a limited-run series set in the 1980s after the events of \"The Muppets Take Manhattan\" and depicted Kermit recruiting the Muppets to locate Rowlf the Dog after his disappearance. The series was intended to be directed by Jason Moore; written by Josh Gad, Adam Horowitz and Eddy Kitsis; produced by ABC Signature Studios and The Muppets Studio; and feature original music by Robert Lopez and Kristen Anderson-Lopez. After an executive change at The Muppets Studio that prompted a different creative direction for the Muppets, Disney canceled development on the project in September 2019. A second Disney+ series, \"Muppets Now\", a short-form improvisational comedy series, was announced in August 2019 and was released on July 31, 2020. \"Muppets Haunted Mansion\", a Halloween special based on the Disney attraction of the same name, was released on October 8, 2021.\nA third Disney+ series, \"The Muppets Mayhem\", was ordered in March 2022. The series was developed and written by Adam F. Goldberg, Bill Barretta and Jeff Yorkes and starred Dr. Teeth and the Electric Mayhem, alongside Lilly Singh and Tahj Mowry. The series received five Emmy Award nominations at the Children's and Family Emmy Awards, winning one for Outstanding Children's or Family Viewing Series.\nA revival special of \"The Muppet Show\" is being produced by 20th Television, Disney Branded Television, The Muppets Studio, and Point Grey Pictures for Disney+, with an unspecified release date in 2026 to coincide with the series' 50th anniversary. The special will star Muppet performers Bill Barretta, Dave Goelz, Eric Jacobson, Peter Linz, David Rudman and Matt Vogel performing the majority of the Muppet characters, alongside a supporting cast of additional performers; Goelz reprises the same character roles he originated during the show's original 1976\u20131981 run. The special will be directed by Alex Timbers and feature special guest star Sabrina Carpenter.\nA Miss Piggy-centric film was revealed by Jennifer Lawrence during a podcast interview. Lawrence is producing it with Emma Stone while Cole Escola will write the script.\nCharacters.\nThe principal characters of \"The Muppet Show\" and subsequent media include Kermit the Frog, Miss Piggy, Fozzie Bear, Gonzo, Camilla the Chicken, Rowlf the Dog, Scooter, Rizzo the Rat, Pepe the King Prawn, Dr. Bunsen Honeydew, Beaker, Statler and Waldorf, The Swedish Chef, Sam Eagle, Walter, and The Electric Mayhem, consisting of Dr. Teeth (vocals, keyboards), Animal (drums), Floyd Pepper (bass, vocals), Janice (guitar, vocals), Zoot (saxophone), and Lips (trumpet).\nAs well as \"The Muppet Show\", the characters are popular for their appearances on \"Sesame Street\" and \"Fraggle Rock\"; and also feature in \"Sam and Friends\", \"The Jimmy Dean Show\", \"The Jim Henson Hour\", \"Muppets Tonight\", \"Bear in the Big Blue House\", \"\", \"The Muppets\", and \"The Muppets Mayhem\". An adult-oriented segment, \"The Land of Gorch\", was a regular feature in the first season of \"Saturday Night Live\". Guest stars on \"Saturday Night Live\" occasionally include both the Muppets and \"Sesame Street\" characters, as well as Muppet likenesses of real people; these likenesses appear recurrently in early episodes of \"The Muppet Show\" and on \"Sesame Street\", and appear occasionally on other series such as \"30 Rock\".\nFollowing Disney's acquisition of the Muppets, puppets created by the Jim Henson Company are no longer referred to as Muppets. Puppets created by Jim Henson's Creature Shop, including those in \"Labyrinth\" and \"The Dark Crystal\", have never been considered Muppets, as they are generally more complex in design and performance than regular Muppets. At Henson's suggestion, the \"Star Wars\" character Yoda was originally performed by Frank Oz, and has been loosely described as a Muppet in media and reference works; he is not, however, and Henson otherwise had no involvement in the character's conception.\nDesign and performance.\nFrom 1962 to 1978, Don Sahlin was the primary designer and builder of the Muppets and was described by Henson as \"the man most responsible for the look of the Muppets.\" Sahlin's designs are often recognizable for their spheroid heads partially bisected to create large mouths; several characters designed by Sahlin include Rowlf the Dog, Bert and Ernie, Grover, and Cookie Monster.\nThe majority of the Muppets are designed as hand puppets, with several characters utilizing rods. Common design elements of the Muppets include flexible faces with wide mouths and large protruding eyes. Most of the Muppets are molded or carved out of various types of foam and covered with any felt-like material. The characters may represent humans, anthropomorphic characters, realistic animals, animate inanimate objects, robots, extraterrestrial or mythical creatures, or other forms of abstract characters.\nThe Muppets are distinguished from ventriloquist dummies, which are usually animated only in the head and face, in that their arms or other features are also animated. They are also generally made of softer material. They are presented as being independent of the puppeteer, officially known as a \"Muppet performer\", who is usually hidden behind a set or outside of the camera frame. Using the camera frame to this advantage was an innovation of the Muppets. Prior to this, a stage was used to mask the performers, as would be the case in a live performance. Sometimes, they are seen full-bodied; in most cases, invisible strings are used to manipulate these puppets, with vocals added at a later point. Performers often use dollies to mimic walking.\nSince 2006, Disney has contracted Puppet Heap to produce and maintain newer models of the Muppets. During most performances, the performer holds the character above their head or in front of their body, with one hand operating the head and mouth and the other manipulating the hands and arms, either with two separate control rods or \u2013 in the case of \"live-hand\" Muppets \u2013 wearing the hands similarly to gloves. One consequence of this design is that most of the Muppets are left-handed, with the performer using their right hand to operate the head while operating the arm with their left hand.\nFor more complex Muppets, several performers may operate a single character, with the performer controlling the mouth usually voicing the character. As technology has advanced, the Jim Henson team and other performers have developed several means to operate the Muppets for film and television; these include the use of suspended rigs, internal motors, remote manipulators, and computer-enhanced and superimposed images. Creative use of different technologies has allowed for scenes in which the Muppets appear to exhibit complex movements wholly independently of the performer.\nIn his book \"Street Gang\", author Michael Davis wrote that the characters tend to develop \"organically\", alluding to the performers taking up to a year to develop their characters and voices. They are also \"test-driven, passed around from one Henson troupe member to another in the hope of finding the perfect human-Muppet match\". When interacting with them, children believed that Muppets were living beings, even when the performers were present.\nMuppet performers.\nThe Muppets have been operated and performed by a cast of puppeteers collectively known as the \"Muppet Performers,\" a troupe established by Jim and Jane Henson in 1955. In the Muppets' early years, Jim and Jane Henson were the sole performers. Jane retired from performing in 1961 to focus on raising their children, after which Jim Henson began recruiting additional puppeteers. That same year, he met Frank Oz, who would become one of the core members of the Muppet performing team.\nAlthough interested, Oz initially declined due to his youth and high school commitments, and instead recommended Jerry Juhl, a colleague from the Vagabond Puppet Theater in Oakland, California. Upon graduating, Oz joined the troupe in August 1963, which at the time included Henson, Juhl, and Muppet designer Don Sahlin. By the time \"The Muppet Show\" entered production, the principal group of performers had expanded to include Henson, Oz, Jerry Nelson, Dave Goelz, Richard Hunt, and later Steve Whitmire. Juhl transitioned to serve as head writer for the series. From \"The Muppet Show\" onward, additional puppeteers such as Kevin Clash, Kathryn Mullen, Louise Gold, Karen Prell, Fran Brill, Caroll Spinney, and Brian Henson performed minor characters and assisted the main performers. Many of these puppeteers contributed across other Henson-related productions, including \"Sesame Street\" and \"Fraggle Rock\".\nJim Henson, Hunt, and Nelson continued performing until their deaths in 1990, 1992, and 2012, respectively. Goelz, Whitmire, and Bill Barretta\u2014who joined the main cast of performers in the mid-1990s\u2014assumed several of his characters. Whitmire also inherited the role of Beaker, and Nelson that of Statler, both originally performed by Hunt. The remainder of Hunt's characters were left without regular performers until David Rudman assumed several of them during the 2000s. Oz continued performing until his retirement from puppeteering in 2000, with Eric Jacobson succeeding him in his characters beginning in 2002. At Nelson's behest, Matt Vogel gradually began performing his characters in 2008. Peter Linz joined the main cast in 2011, debuting the role of Walter in \"The Muppets\".\nWhitmire was dismissed from the troupe in 2016, with Vogel cast as Kermit the Frog in 2017. Most of Whitmire's remaining characters were subsequently reassigned among the existing performers, primarily to Linz. As of the present, the Muppets are performed by a core ensemble of six principal puppeteers: Goelz, Barretta, Jacobson, Vogel, Rudman, and Linz, with the occasional ensemble of \"additional\" Muppet performers that includes Julianne Buescher, Tyler Bunch, Alice Dinnean, Bruce Lanoil, Leslie Carrara-Rudolph, Drew Massey, Mike Quinn, and Michelan Sisti.\nMedia.\nDiscography.\nOn September 17, 2002, Rhino Records released ', a compilation album of music from \"The Muppet Show\" and subsequent film releases. With John Denver, ' was produced and released in 1979.\nUnder Disney ownership, The Muppets albums have been released by Walt Disney Records, including new album releases and album reissues, such as \"The Muppet Christmas Carol\" in 2005 and \"The Muppet Movie\" in 2013. Legal music publishing rights to Muppet songs are administered by Fuzzy Muppet Songs and Mad Muppet Melodies, imprints of Disney Music Publishing.\nTheme parks.\nSimilar to other Disney characters, the Muppets appear at Disney theme parks, having first appeared at Walt Disney World Resort in 1990. Their first featured attraction, \"Here Come the Muppets\", was a live stage show that opened shortly after Jim Henson's death and ran at Disney's Hollywood Studios (known at that time as Disney-MGM Studios) for a year. \"Muppet*Vision 3D\", a 4D film attraction that also used Audio-Animatronics characters, opened at Disney's Hollywood Studios on May 16, 1991, exactly one year after Henson's death. It is Henson's final directorial effort. \"Muppet*Vision 3D\" subsequently opened at Disney California Adventure, on February 8, 2001; this version closed in 2014. The original version of \"Muppet*Vision 3D\" at Disney's Hollywood Studios closed on June 8, 2025.\nThe Muppets also were featured in \"The Muppets Present...Great Moments in American History\" at the Magic Kingdom from 2016 to 2020, and the Muppet Mobile Lab at Epcot in 2007. The latter attraction is a free-roving vehicle with Audio-Animatronics figures of Bunsen Honeydew and Beaker. As part of Disney's Living Character Initiative, it premiered at Disney California Adventure and later made appearances at Epcot and Hong Kong Disneyland.\nIn 2010, the Muppets were the face of the \"Give a Day, Get a Disney Day\" charity campaign. Kermit, Miss Piggy, and Sweetums appeared in daily parades at Disneyland and Magic Kingdom. The Muppets appeared in television and print ads for the campaign and were featured prominently on the campaign's web site.\nThe Disney Parks have released numerous collector pins featuring the Muppets since 2004. These include Limited Edition pins, Hidden Mickey pin collections, mystery pin sets, 2008 pin sets promoting \"The Muppets\", cast lanyard pins, and assorted individual rack pins. Over 100 pins displaying the characters have been released overall.\nIn November 2024, it was announced that the Rock 'n' Roller Coaster Starring Aerosmith attraction at Disney's Hollywood Studios will be re-themed to the Muppets. It is scheduled to open in summer 2026.\nPublishing.\nAmong other print media, the Muppets have featured in comics since the 1980s. An eponymous comic strip by Guy and Brad Gilchrist first ran on September 21, 1981, in over 500 daily newspapers, six months after \"The Muppet Show\" ended its five-year run. By the end of its run in 1986, the comic strip was seen in over 660 newspapers worldwide. Many of the strips were compiled in various book collections. Special strips were also created in color, exclusively for issues of \"Muppet Magazine\".\n\"Muppet Magazine\" was published from 1983 to 1989. The magazine was presented as being run by the Muppets themselves and included such features as celebrity interviews and comic stories.\nThe only Muppets film adapted as a comic book was \"The Muppets Take Manhattan\". The comic book series was adapted by Marvel Comics in 1984, as the 68-page story in \"Marvel Super Special\" issue #32. The adaptation was later re-printed into three limited series issues, released under Marvel's Star Comics imprint (November 1984 \u2013 January 1985).\nIn the wake of \"Muppet Babies\"' success, Star Comics adapted the series into a bi-monthly title, of which 26 issues were produced.\nThe final issue of \"Disney Adventures\", released in 2007, included a one-page strip by Roger Langridge. In 2009, Boom! Studios began publishing a series of comic books based on \"The Muppet Show\", written and illustrated by Langridge. After two mini-series, an ongoing series, \"The Muppet Show Comic Book\", was published for eleven issues. Additionally, Boom! Studios published fairy tale adaptations centered on the Muppets. In 2012, the Langridge series was transferred to Marvel Comics, which released an omnibus edition in 2013.\nVideo games.\nThe first video game in the franchise was \"Kermit's Electronic Storymaker\", which was released in 1984 for the Commodore 64. In 1989, ', was released by Hi Tech Expressions for the Apple II, Commodore 64, and MS-DOS, the following year it was ported by the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) in 1990. In 1996, Activision and in association with Jim Henson Interactive released the CD-ROM game, \"Muppet Treasure Island\" (on which the film of the same name was based) for Windows 95. Later in 1996, Starwave released \"The Muppet CD-ROM: Muppets Inside\", the second CD-ROM game was advertised for a January release, and available in stores beginning in March. In April 2000, Take-Two Interactive released the platform game under the title \"Jim Henson's Muppets\" for the Game Boy Color. In October 2000, Midway Games released the two \"Muppet\" video games, \"Muppet RaceMania\" and \"Muppet Monster Adventure\" for the PlayStation console. On April 18, 2002, TDK Mediactive acquired the rights to \"The Muppets\" games, and released two video games, \"The Muppets: On with the Show!\" (2002) and ' (2003) for the Game Boy Advance and \"Muppets Party Cruise\" (2003) for the PlayStation 2 and GameCube consoles. In 2014, Virtual Toys released \"The Muppets Movie Adventures\" for PS Vita. The mobile game \"Disney Magic Kingdoms\", developed by Gameloft, includes characters and attractions based on \"The Muppets\" franchise during limited time contents.\nIn popular culture.\nThe Muppets' prevalence in popular culture is such that the characters have become regarded as celebrities in their own right. The Muppets have a collective star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, with Kermit having been previously individually inducted in 2002. The characters have appeared at the Academy Awards and Emmy Awards; made cameo appearances in films including \"Rocky III\", \"An American Werewolf in London\", and \"Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium\"; and have been interviewed on the news magazine \"60 Minutes\".\nKermit was interviewed by Jon Stewart on \"The Daily Show\"; was a guest host on \"The Tonight Show\", \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\", \"\", \"America's Funniest Home Videos\", and an April Fools' Day edition of \"Larry King Live\"; and has served as Grand Marshal of the Tournament of Roses Parade. The characters also appeared on \"The Cosby Show\" and \"The Torkelsons\", among other sitcoms. The music video for Weezer's \"Keep Fishin'\" is aesthetically based on \"The Muppet Show\" and consists of the band interacting with the characters.\nOn September 28, 2005, the United States Postal Service released a \"Jim Henson and the Muppets\" postage stamp series. The Muppets also appeared on \"Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve\" on December 31, 2007, in which Kermit and other characters presented segments following advertising breaks. After one such segment, with Kermit in Times Square, co-host Ryan Seacrest thanked \"Kerms\" for his assistance. Miss Piggy has appeared as a guest on \"The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson\", and Kermit appeared on \"Hollywood Squares\" and as one of the celebrity commentators on VH1's \"I Love\" documentary series. The Muppets, as well as the title character of \"Bear in the Big Blue House\", have made frequent appearances on \"The Jerry Lewis MDA Labor Day Telethon\".\nOn July 25, 2007, the Center for Puppetry Arts in Atlanta announced plans for the Jim Henson Wing, which would house up to 700 retired Muppet characters. The wing, featuring films, sketches, and other materials from the Jim Henson Company archives, was set to open in 2012 but eventually opened as a gallery within the \"Worlds of Puppetry\" exhibition at the Center in November 2015.\nMuppet-like characters star in the Broadway musical \"Avenue Q\", the concept of which is a parody of \"Sesame Street\". The Peter Jackson film \"Meet the Feebles\", a satire on the television industry, is largely reminiscent of \"The Muppet Show\". A Kermit the Frog stuffed toy rigged to spray fake vomit was a recurring joke on \"Late Night with Conan O'Brien\", and the Muppets were frequently preempted at the beginning of episodes of \"You Can't Do That on Television\". The sitcom series \"Greg the Bunny\" centered on sentient hand puppets working on a Muppet-like children's show. Among other examples, television series such as \"The Simpsons\", \"Family Guy\", \"The West Wing\", and \"Robot Chicken\" have referenced the Muppets.\nThe term \"muppet\" is commonly used in Ireland, Britain, and Australasia to refer to a stupid or ineffectual person.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

(For mixtures of gases, the letter \"y\" is recommended.)\nIt is a dimensionless quantity with dimension of formula_2 and dimensionless unit of moles per mole (mol/mol or mol\u22c5mol\u22121) or simply 1; metric prefixes may also be used (e.g., nmol/mol for 10\u22129).\nWhen expressed in percent, it is known as the mole percent or molar percentage (unit symbol %, sometimes \"mol%\", equivalent to cmol/mol for 10\u22122).\nThe mole fraction is called amount fraction by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) and amount-of-substance fraction by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). This nomenclature is part of the International System of Quantities (ISQ), as standardized in ISO 80000-9, which deprecates \"mole fraction\" based on the unacceptability of mixing information with units when expressing the values of quantities.\nThe sum of all the mole fractions in a mixture is equal to 1:\nformula_3\nMole fraction is numerically identical to the number fraction, which is defined as the number of particles (molecules) of a constituent \"Ni\" divided by the total number of all molecules \"N\"tot. \nWhereas mole fraction is a ratio of amounts to amounts (in units of moles per moles), molar concentration is a quotient of amount to volume (in units of moles per litre).\nOther ways of expressing the composition of a mixture as a dimensionless quantity are mass fraction and volume fraction.\nProperties.\nMole fraction is used very frequently in the construction of phase diagrams. It has a number of advantages:\nDifferential quotients can be formed at constant ratios like those above:\n formula_5\nor \n formula_6\nThe ratios \"X\", \"Y\", and \"Z\" of mole fractions can be written for ternary and multicomponent systems:\n formula_7\nThese can be used for solving PDEs like:\n formula_8\nor \n formula_9\nThis equality can be rearranged to have differential quotient of mole amounts or fractions on one side.\n formula_10\nor \n formula_11\nMole amounts can be eliminated by forming ratios:\n formula_12\nThus the ratio of chemical potentials becomes:\n formula_13\nSimilarly the ratio for the multicomponents system becomes\n formula_14\nRelated quantities.\nMass fraction.\nThe mass fraction \"wi\" can be calculated using the formula\nformula_15\nwhere \"Mi\" is the molar mass of the component \"i\" and \"M\u0304\" is the average molar mass of the mixture.\nMolar mixing ratio.\nThe mixing of two pure components can be expressed introducing the amount or molar mixing ratio of them formula_16. Then the mole fractions of the components will be:\nformula_17\nThe amount ratio equals the ratio of mole fractions of components:\nformula_18\ndue to division of both numerator and denominator by the sum of molar amounts of components. This property has consequences for representations of phase diagrams using, for instance, ternary plots.\nMixing binary mixtures with a common component to form ternary mixtures.\nMixing binary mixtures with a common component gives a ternary mixture with certain mixing ratios between the three components. These mixing ratios from the ternary and the corresponding mole fractions of the ternary mixture x1(123), x2(123), x3(123) can be expressed as a function of several mixing ratios involved, the mixing ratios between the components of the binary mixtures and the mixing ratio of the binary mixtures to form the ternary one.\nformula_19\nMole percentage.\nMultiplying mole fraction by 100 gives the mole percentage, also referred as amount/amount percent [abbreviated as (n/n)% or mol %].\nMass concentration.\nThe conversion to and from mass concentration \"\u03c1i\" is given by:\nformula_20\nwhere \"M\u0304\" is the average molar mass of the mixture.\nMolar concentration.\nThe conversion to molar concentration \"ci\" is given by:\nformula_21\nwhere \"M\u0304\" is the average molar mass of the solution, \"c\" is the total molar concentration and \"\u03c1\" is the density of the solution.\nMass and molar mass.\nThe mole fraction can be calculated from the masses \"mi\" and molar masses \"Mi\" of the components:\nformula_22\nSpatial variation and gradient.\nIn a spatially non-uniform mixture, the mole fraction gradient triggers the phenomenon of diffusion.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

She was born in Allegheny, Pennsylvania (now part of Pittsburgh's North Side), but lived much of her adult life in France, where she befriended Edgar Degas and exhibited with the Impressionists. Cassatt often created images of the social and private lives of women, with particular emphasis on the intimate bonds between mothers and children.\nShe was described by Gustave Geffroy as one of \"les trois grandes dames\" (the three great ladies) of Impressionism alongside Marie Bracquemond and Berthe Morisot. In 1879, Diego Martelli compared her to Degas, as they both sought to depict movement, light, and design in the most modern sense. She also played an important role in introducing Impressionism to American collectors, notably through her friendship with the Havemeyer family.\nEarly life.\nCassatt was born in Allegheny, Pennsylvania, which is now part of Pittsburgh. She was born into an upper-middle-class family: Her father, Robert Simpson Cassat (later Cassatt), was a successful stockbroker and land speculator. The ancestral name had been Cossart, with the family descended from French Huguenot Jacques Cossart, who came to New Amsterdam in 1662. Her mother, Katherine Kelso Johnston, came from a banking family. Katherine Cassatt, educated and well-read, had a profound influence on her daughter. To that effect, Cassatt's lifelong friend Louisine Havemeyer wrote in her memoirs: \"Anyone who had the privilege of knowing Mary Cassatt's mother would know at once that it was from her and her alone that [Mary] inherited her ability.\" A distant cousin of artist Robert Henri, Cassatt was one of seven children, of whom two died in infancy. One brother, Alexander Johnston Cassatt, later became president of the Pennsylvania Railroad. The family moved eastward, first moving to Lancaster, Pennsylvania, then to the Philadelphia area, where she started her schooling at the age of six.\nCassatt grew up in an environment that viewed travel as an integral part of a well-rounded education; she spent five years in Europe and visited many of the capitals, including London, Paris, and Berlin. While abroad, she learned German and French and had her first lessons in drawing and music. It is likely that her first exposure to French artists Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres, Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix, Camille Corot, and Gustave Courbet was at the Paris World's Fair of 1855. Also in the exhibition were Edgar Degas and Camille Pissarro, both of whom were later her colleagues and mentors.\nThough her family objected to her becoming a professional artist, Cassatt began studying painting at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in Philadelphia at the early age of 15. Part of her parents' concern may have been Cassatt's exposure to feminist ideas and the bohemian behavior of some of the male students. As such, Cassatt and her network of friends were lifelong advocates of equal rights for the sexes. Although about 20% of the students were female, most viewed art as a socially valuable skill; few of them were determined, as Cassatt was, to make art their career. She continued her studies from 1861 through 1865, the duration of the American Civil War. Thomas Eakins was among her fellow students; later Eakins was forced to resign as director of the academy.\nImpatient with the slow pace of instruction and the patronizing attitude of the male students and teachers, she decided to study the old masters on her own. She later said: \"There was no teaching\" at the academy. Female students could not use live models until somewhat later, and the principal training was primarily drawing from casts.\nCassatt decided to end her studies: At that time, no degree was granted. After overcoming her father's objections, she moved to Paris in 1866, with her mother and family friends acting as chaperones. Since women could not yet attend the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts, Cassatt applied to study privately with masters from the school and was accepted to study with Jean-L\u00e9on G\u00e9r\u00f4me, a highly regarded teacher known for his hyper-realistic technique and his depiction of exotic subjects. (A few months later, G\u00e9r\u00f4me also accepted Eakins as a student.) Cassatt augmented her artistic training with daily copying in the Louvre, obtaining the required permit, which was necessary to control the \"copyists\", usually low-paid women, who daily filled the museum to paint copies for sale. The museum also served as a social place for Frenchmen and American female students, who, like Cassatt, were not allowed to attend cafes where the avant-garde socialized. In this manner, fellow artist and friend Elizabeth Jane Gardner met and married famed academic painter William-Adolphe Bouguereau.\nToward the end of 1866, she joined a painting class taught by Charles Joshua Chaplin, a genre artist. In 1868, Cassatt also studied with artist Thomas Couture, whose subjects were mostly romantic and urban. On trips to the countryside, the students drew from life, particularly the peasants going about their daily activities. In 1868, one of her paintings, \"A Mandoline Player\", was accepted for the first time by the selection jury for the Paris Salon. With Elizabeth Jane Gardner, whose work was also accepted by the jury that year, Cassatt was one of two American women to first exhibit in the Salon. \"A Mandoline Player\" is in the Romantic style of Corot and Couture, and is one of only two paintings from the first decade of her career that is documented today.\nThe French art scene was in a process of change, as radical artists such as Courbet and \u00c9douard Manet tried to break away from accepted Academic tradition, and the Impressionists were in their formative years. Cassatt's friend Eliza Haldeman wrote home that artists \"are leaving the Academy style and each seeking a new way, consequently just now everything is Chaos.\" Cassatt, on the other hand, continued to work in the traditional manner, submitting works to the Salon for over ten years, with increasing frustration.\nReturning to the United States in the late summer of 1870\u2014as the Franco-Prussian War was starting\u2014Cassatt lived with her family in Altoona. Her father continued to resist her chosen vocation, paying for her basic needs but not her art supplies. Cassatt placed two of her paintings in a New York gallery and found many admirers but no purchasers. She was also dismayed at the lack of paintings to study while staying at her summer residence. Cassatt even considered giving up art, as she was determined to make a living independently. She wrote in a letter of July 1871, \"I have given up my studio &amp; torn up my father's portrait, &amp; have not touched a brush for six weeks nor ever will again until I see some prospect of getting back to Europe. I am very anxious to go out west next fall &amp; get some employment, but I have not yet decided where.\"\nCassatt traveled to Chicago to try her luck, but lost some of her early paintings in the Great Chicago Fire of 1871. Shortly afterward, her work attracted the attention of Roman Catholic Bishop Michael Domenec of Pittsburgh, who commissioned her to paint two copies of paintings by Correggio in Parma, Italy, advancing her enough money to cover her travel expenses and part of her stay. In her excitement she wrote, \"O how wild I am to get to work, my fingers farely itch &amp; my eyes water to see a fine picture again\". With Emily Sartain, a fellow artist from a well-regarded artistic family from Philadelphia, Cassatt set out for Europe again.\nImpressionism.\nWithin months of her return to Europe in the autumn of 1871, Cassatt's prospects had brightened. Her painting \"Two Women Throwing Flowers During Carnival\" was well received in the Salon of 1872 and was purchased. She attracted much favorable notice in Parma and was supported and encouraged by the art community there: \"All Parma is talking of Miss Cassatt and her picture, and everyone is anxious to know her\".\nAfter completing her commission for the bishop, Cassatt traveled to Madrid and Seville, where she painted a group of paintings of Spanish subjects, including \"Spanish Dancer Wearing a Lace Mantilla\" (1873, in the National Museum of American Art, Smithsonian Institution). In 1874, she made the decision to take up residence in France. She was joined by her sister, Lydia, who shared an apartment with her. Cassatt opened a studio in Paris. Louisa May Alcott's sister, Abigail May Alcott, was then an art student in Paris and visited Cassatt. Cassatt continued to express criticism of the politics of the Salon and the conventional taste that prevailed there. She was blunt in her comments, as reported by Sartain, who wrote: \"she is entirely too slashing, snubs all modern art, disdains the Salon pictures of Cabanel, Bonnat, all the names we are used to revere\".\nCassatt saw that works by female artists were often dismissed with contempt unless the artist had a friend or protector on the jury, and she would not flirt with jurors to curry favor. Her cynicism grew when one of the two pictures she submitted in 1875 was refused by the jury, only to be accepted the following year after she darkened the background. She had quarrels with Sartain, who thought Cassatt too outspoken and self-centered, and eventually they parted. Out of her distress and self-criticism, Cassatt decided that she needed to move away from genre paintings and onto more fashionable subjects, in order to attract portrait commissions from American socialites abroad, but that attempt bore little fruit at first.\nIn 1877, both her entries were rejected, and for the first time in seven years, she had no works in the Salon. At this low point in her career, she was invited by Edgar Degas to show her works with the Impressionists, a group that had begun their own series of independent exhibitions in 1874 with much attendant notoriety. The Impressionists (also known as the \"Independents\" or \"Intransigents\") had no formal manifesto and varied considerably in subject matter and technique. They tended to prefer plein air painting and the application of vibrant color in separate strokes with little pre-mixing, which allows the eye to merge the results in an \"impressionistic\" manner. The Impressionists had been receiving the wrath of the critics for several years. Henry Bacon, a friend of the Cassatts, thought that the Impressionists were so radical that they were \"afflicted with some hitherto unknown disease of the eye\". They already had one female member, artist Berthe Morisot, who became Cassatt's friend and colleague. The only American officially associated with the Impressionists, Cassatt would go on to exhibit in half of the group's later exhibitions\nCassatt admired Degas, whose pastels had made a powerful impression on her when she encountered them in an art dealer's window in 1875. \"I used to go and flatten my nose against that window and absorb all I could of his art,\" she later recalled. \"It changed my life. I saw art then as I wanted to see it.\" She accepted Degas' invitation with enthusiasm and began preparing paintings for the next Impressionist show, planned for 1878, which (after a postponement because of the World's Fair) took place on April 10, 1879. She felt comfortable with the Impressionists and joined their cause enthusiastically, declaring: \"we are carrying on a despairing fight &amp; need all our forces\". Unable to attend cafes with them without attracting unfavorable attention, she met with them privately and at exhibitions. She now hoped for commercial success selling paintings to the sophisticated Parisians who preferred the avant-garde. Her style had gained a new spontaneity during the intervening two years. Previously a studio-bound artist, she had adopted the practice of carrying a sketchbook with her while out-of-doors or at the theater, and recording the scenes she saw.\nIn 1877, Cassatt was joined in Paris by her father and mother, who returned with her sister Lydia, all eventually to share a large apartment on the fifth floor of 13, Avenue Trudaine. Mary valued their companionship, as neither she nor Lydia had married. A case was made that Mary had narcissistic disturbance, never completing the recognition of herself as a person outside of the orbit of her mother. Mary had decided early in life that marriage would be incompatible with her career. Lydia, who was frequently painted by her sister, had recurrent bouts of illness, and her death in 1882 left Cassatt temporarily unable to work.\nCassatt's father insisted that her studio and supplies be covered by her sales, which were still meager. Afraid of having to paint \"potboilers\" to make ends meet, Cassatt applied herself to produce some quality paintings for the next Impressionist exhibition. Three of her most accomplished works from 1878 were \"Portrait of the Artist\" (self-portrait), \"Little Girl in a Blue Armchair\", and \"Reading Le Figaro\" (portrait of her mother).\nDegas had considerable influence on Cassatt. Both were highly experimental in their use of materials, trying distemper and metallic paints in many works, such as \"Woman Standing Holding a Fan\", 1878\u201379 (Amon Carter Museum of American Art).\nShe became extremely proficient in the use of pastels, eventually creating many of her most important works in this medium. Degas also introduced her to etching, of which he was a recognized master. The two worked side by side for a while, and her draftsmanship gained considerable strength under his tutelage. One example of her thoughtful approach to the medium of drypoint as a mode for reflecting on her status as an artist is 'Reflection' of 1889\u201390, which has recently been interpreted as a self-portrait. Degas in turn depicted Cassatt in a series of etchings recording their trips to the Louvre. She treasured his friendship but learned not to expect too much from his fickle and temperamental nature after a project they were collaborating on at the time, a proposed journal devoted to prints, was abruptly dropped by him. The sophisticated and well-dressed Degas, then forty-five, was a welcome dinner guest at the Cassatt residence, and likewise they at his \"soir\u00e9es\".\nThe Impressionist exhibit of 1879 was the most successful to date, despite the absence of Renoir, Sisley, Manet and C\u00e9zanne, who were attempting once again to gain recognition at the Salon. Through the efforts of Gustave Caillebotte, who organized and underwrote the show, the group made a profit and sold many works, although the criticism continued as harsh as ever. The \"Revue des Deux Mondes\" wrote, \"M. Degas and Mlle. Cassatt are, nevertheless, the only artists who distinguish themselves... and who offer some attraction and some excuse in the pretentious show of window dressing and infantile daubing\".\nCassatt displayed eleven works, including \"Lydia in a Loge, Wearing a Pearl Necklace, (Woman in a Loge)\". Although critics claimed that Cassatt's colors were too bright and that her portraits were too accurate to be flattering to the subjects, her work was not savaged as was Monet's, whose circumstances were the most desperate of all the Impressionists at that time. She used her share of the profits to purchase a work by Degas and one by Monet. She participated in the Impressionist Exhibitions that followed in 1880 and 1881, and she remained an active member of the Impressionist circle until 1886. In 1886, Cassatt provided two paintings for the first Impressionist exhibition in the US, organized by art dealer Paul Durand-Ruel. Her friend Louisine Elder married Harry Havemeyer in 1883, and with Cassatt as advisor, the couple began collecting the Impressionists on a grand scale. Much of their vast collection is now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City.\nCassatt also made several portraits of family members during that period, of which \"Portrait of Alexander Cassatt and His Son Robert Kelso\" (1885) is one of her best-regarded. Cassatt's style then evolved, and she moved away from Impressionism to a simpler, more straightforward approach. She began to exhibit her works in New York galleries as well. After 1886, Cassatt no longer identified herself with any art movement and experimented with a variety of techniques.\nFeminist viewpoints and the \"New Woman\".\nCassatt and her contemporaries enjoyed the wave of feminism that occurred in the 1840s, allowing them access to educational institutions at newly coed colleges and universities, such as Oberlin and the University of Michigan. Likewise, women's colleges such as Vassar, Smith and Wellesley opened their doors during this time. Cassatt was an outspoken advocate for women's equality, campaigning with her friends for equal travel scholarships for students in the 1860s, and the right to vote in the 1910s.\nMary Cassatt depicted the \"New Woman\" of the 19th century from the woman's perspective. As a successful, highly trained woman artist who never married, Cassatt\u2014like Ellen Day Hale, Elizabeth Coffin, Elizabeth Nourse and Cecilia Beaux\u2014personified the \"New Woman\". She \"initiated the profound beginnings in recreating the image of the 'new' woman\", drawn from the influence of her intelligent and active mother, Katherine Cassatt, who believed in educating women to be knowledgeable and socially active. She is depicted in \"Reading 'Le Figaro' \"(1878).\nCassatt's independence and choice not to marry as a \"New Woman\" could also be seen as a reaction to the strict institutionalized misogamy of the art world at the time, in which a woman artist's marriage could have been seen as incompatible with any serious artistic career.\nAlthough Cassatt did not explicitly make political statements about women's rights in her work, her artistic portrayal of women was consistently done with dignity and the suggestion of a deeper, meaningful inner life. Many of her works depict a mother caring for a child and she painted them with warmth and attention. Unlike the other Impressionists of the time who often painted street scenes and landscapes, Cassatt preferred to depict the everyday life of women and the domestic labors associated with the home. This was unusual at the time because, while Impressionist pieces typically depicted women as passive objects for the viewer, Cassatt notably made the women she painted active observers with real engagement in their environments. Cassatt's work was shaped by her time spent engaging with these women in their private, intimate spaces, something that a male artist would not have had the social ability to do at that time. This disconnect from what the two different genders were allowed to observe as artists did not go unnoticed by Cassatt, and she notably enjoyed observing the complexities of gender relations in her work. The piece \"In the Loge\" (1878) is a good example of this, as it depicts a young woman watching the opera while a male admirer gawks at her from afar. The viewer is then also included in the voyeuristic objectification of the unaware model, exposing the social dynamics of the time.\nBy choosing to depict more humble feminine environments Cassatt effectively raised scenes of women, their labor, friendships, and personal life to be celebrated as high art. She was often critiqued for this preference and her art dismissed as too feminine. Cassatt objected to being stereotyped as a \"woman artist\"; she supported women's suffrage and, in 1915, showed eighteen works in an exhibition supporting the movement organised by Louisine Havemeyer, a committed and active feminist. The exhibition brought her into conflict with her sister-in-law Eugenie Carter Cassatt, who was anti-suffrage and who boycotted the show along with Philadelphia society in general. Cassatt responded by selling off her work that was otherwise destined for her heirs. In particular \"The Boating Party\", thought to have been inspired by the birth of Eugenie's daughter Ellen Mary, was bought by the National Gallery, Washington, D.C.\nRelationship with Degas.\nCassatt and Degas had a long period of collaboration. The two painters had studios close together, Cassatt at 19, rue Laval, Degas at 4, rue Frochot, less than a five-minute walk apart, and Degas developed the habit of looking in at Cassatt's studio and offering her advice and helping her gain models.\nThey had much in common: they shared similar tastes in art and literature, came from affluent backgrounds, had studied painting in Italy, and both were independent, never marrying. The degree of intimacy between them cannot be assessed now, as no letters survive, but it is unlikely they were in a relationship, given their conservative social backgrounds and strong moral principles. Several of Vincent van Gogh's letters attest to Degas' sexual self-constraint. Degas introduced Cassatt to pastel and engraving, both of which Cassatt quickly mastered, while for her part, Cassatt was instrumental in helping Degas sell his paintings and promoting his reputation in America.\nBoth regarded themselves as figure painters, and the art historian George Shackelford suggests they were influenced by the art critic Louis Edmond Duranty's appeal in his pamphlet \"The New Painting\" for a revitalization in figure painting: \"Let us take leave of the stylized human body, which is treated like a vase. What we need is the characteristic modern person in his clothes, in the midst of his social surroundings, at home or out in the street.\"\nAfter Cassatt's parents and sister, Lydia, joined Cassatt in Paris in 1877, Degas, Cassatt, and Lydia were often to be seen at the Louvre studying artworks together. Degas produced two prints, notable for their technical innovation, depicting Cassatt at the Louvre looking at artworks while Lydia reads a guidebook. These were destined for a prints journal planned by Degas (together with Camille Pissarro and others), which never came to fruition. Cassatt frequently posed for Degas, notably for his millinery series trying on hats.\nAround 1884, Degas made a portrait in oils of Cassatt, \"Mary Cassatt Seated, Holding Cards\". A \"Self-Portrait\" (c.\u20091880) by Cassatt depicts her in the identical hat and dress, leading art historian Griselda Pollock to speculate they were executed in a joint painting session in the early years of their acquaintance.\nCassatt and Degas worked most closely together in the fall and winter of 1879\u201380, when Cassatt was mastering her printmaking technique. Degas owned a small printing press, and by day she worked at his studio using his tools and press while in the evening she made studies for the etching plate the next day. However, in April 1880, Degas abruptly withdrew from the prints journal they had been collaborating on, and without his support, the project folded. Degas' withdrawal piqued Cassatt who had worked hard at preparing a print, \"In the Opera Box\", in a large edition of fifty impressions, no doubt destined for the journal. Although Cassatt's warm feelings for Degas were to last her entire life, she never again worked with him as closely as she had over the prints journal. Mathews notes that she ceased executing her theater scenes at this time.\nDegas was forthright in his views, as was Cassatt. They clashed over the Dreyfus affair (early in her career she had executed a portrait of the art collector Moyse Dreyfus, a relative of the court-martialled lieutenant at the center of the affair). Cassatt later expressed satisfaction at the irony of Lousine Havermeyer's 1915 joint exhibition of hers and Degas' work being held in aid of women's suffrage, equally capable of affectionately repeating Degas' antifemale comments as being estranged by them (when viewing her \"Two Women Picking Fruit\" for the first time, he had commented \"No woman has the right to draw like that\"). From the 1890s onwards their relationship took on a decidedly commercial aspect, as in general had Cassatt's other relations with the Impressionist circle; nevertheless they continued to visit each other until Degas died in 1917.\nIn 2014, the National Gallery of Art examined their long friendship in its exhibit \"Degas/Cassatt\". The catalog was written by Kimberly Jones \nLater life.\nCassatt's reputation is based on an extensive series of rigorously drawn and tenderly observed paintings and prints on the theme of the mother and child. The earliest dated work on this subject is the drypoint \"Gardner Held by His Mother\" (an impression inscribed \"Jan/88\" is in the New York Public Library), although she had painted a few earlier works on the theme. Some of these works depict her own relatives, friends, or clients, although in her later years she generally used professional models in compositions that are often reminiscent of Italian Renaissance depictions of the Madonna and Child. After 1900, she concentrated almost exclusively on mother-and-child subjects, such as \"Woman with a Sunflower\". Viewers may be surprised to find that despite her focus on portraying mother-child pairs in her portraits, \"Cassatt rejected the idea of becoming a wife and mother...\"\nThe 1890s were Cassatt's busiest and most creative period. She had matured considerably and became more diplomatic and less blunt in her opinions. She also became a role model for young American artists who sought her advice. Among them was Lucy A. Bacon, whom Cassatt introduced to Camille Pissarro. Though the Impressionist group disbanded, Cassatt still had contact with some of the members, including Renoir, Monet, and Pissarro.\nIn 1891, she exhibited a series of highly original colored drypoint and aquatint prints, including \"Woman Bathing\" and \"The Coiffure\", inspired by the Japanese masters shown in Paris the year before. (See Japonism) Cassatt was attracted to the simplicity and clarity of Japanese design and the skillful use of blocks of color. In her interpretation, she used primarily light, delicate pastel colors and avoided black (a \"forbidden\" color among the Impressionists). Adelyn D. Breeskin, the author of two \"catalogue raisonn\u00e9s\" of Cassatt's work, comments that these colored prints, \"now stand as her most original contribution... adding a new chapter to the history of graphic arts...technically, as color prints, they have never been surpassed\".\nAlso in 1891, Chicago socialite Bertha Palmer approached Cassatt to paint a 12' \u00d7 58' mural about \"Modern Woman\" for the Women's Building for the World's Columbian Exposition to be held in 1893. Cassatt completed the project over the next two years while living in France with her mother. The mural was designed as a triptych. The central theme was titled \"Young Women Plucking the Fruits of Knowledge or Science\". The left panel was \"Young Girls Pursuing Fame\" and the right panel \"Arts, Music, Dancing\". The mural displays a community of women apart from their relation to men, as accomplished persons in their own right. Palmer considered Cassatt to be an American treasure and could think of no one better to paint a mural at an exposition that was to do so much to focus the world's attention on the status of women. Following the world's fair, the mural came into Bertha Palmer's possession, where it remained as late as 1911, but it disappeared after Palmer's death in 1918. Cassatt made several studies and paintings on themes similar to those in the mural, so it is possible to see her development of those ideas and images. Cassatt also exhibited other paintings in the Exposition.\nAs the new century arrived, Cassatt served as an advisor to several major art collectors and stipulated that they eventually donate their purchases to American art museums. In recognition of her contributions to the arts, France awarded her the L\u00e9gion d'honneur in 1904. Although instrumental in advising American collectors, recognition of her art came more slowly in the United States. Even among her family members back in America, she received little recognition and was totally overshadowed by her famous brother.\nMary Cassatt's brother, Alexander Cassatt, was president of the Pennsylvania Railroad from 1899 until his death in 1906. She was shaken, as they had been close, but she continued to be very productive in the years leading up to 1910. An increasing sentimentality is apparent in her work of the 1900s; her work was popular with the public and the critics, but she was no longer breaking new ground, and her Impressionist colleagues who once provided stimulation and criticism were dying. She was hostile to such new developments in art as post-Impressionism, Fauvism and Cubism. Two of her works appeared in the Armory Show of 1913, both images of a mother and child.\nA trip to Egypt in 1910 impressed Cassatt with the beauty of its ancient art, but was followed by a crisis of creativity; not only had the trip exhausted her, but she declared herself \"crushed by the strength of this Art\", saying, \"I fought against it but it conquered, it is surely the greatest Art the past has left us ... how are my feeble hands to ever paint the effect on me.\" Diagnosed with diabetes, rheumatism, neuralgia, and cataracts in 1911, she did not slow down, but after 1914, she was forced to stop painting as she became almost blind. In 1925 she was featured on 32nd Annual Exhibition of American Art at the Cincinnati Art Museum, together with Louise Woodroofe, Childe Hassam and Robert Henri.\nCassatt died on June 14, 1926, at Ch\u00e2teau de Beaufresne, near Paris, and was buried in the family vault at Le Mesnil-Th\u00e9ribus, France.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It normally provides education in a military environment, the exact definition depending on the country concerned.\nThree types of academy exist: pre-collegiate-level institutions awarding academic qualifications, university-level institutions awarding bachelor's-degree-level qualifications, and those preparing officer cadets for commissioning into the armed services of the state.\nA naval academy is either a type of military academy (in the broad sense of that term) or is distinguished from one (in the narrow sense). In U.S. usage, the Military, Merchant Marine, Naval, Coast Guard, and the Air Force Academy serve as military academies under the categorization of service academies in that country.\nHistory.\nThe first military academies were established in the 18th century to provide future officers for technically specialized corps, such as military engineers and artillery, with scientific training.\nThe Italian Military Academy was inaugurated in Turin on January 1, 1678, as the Savoy Royal Academy, making it the oldest military academy in existence. The Royal Danish Naval Academy was set up in 1701. The Royal Military Academy, Woolwich was set up in 1741, after a false start in 1720 because of a lack of funds, as the earliest military academy in Britain. Its original purpose was to train cadets entering the Royal Artillery and Royal Engineers. In France, the \u00c9cole Royale du G\u00e9nie at M\u00e9zi\u00e8res was founded in 1748, followed by a non-technical academy in 1751, the \u00c9cole Royale Militaire offering a general military education to the nobility. French military academies were widely copied in Prussia, Austria, Russia. The Norwegian Military Academy in Oslo, educates officers of the Norwegian Army. The academy was established in 1750, and is the oldest institution for higher education in Norway.\nBy the turn of the century, under the impetus of the Napoleonic Wars and the strain that the armies of Europe subsequently came under, military academies for the training of commissioned officers of the army were set up in most of the combatant nations. These military schools had two functions: to provide instruction for serving officers in the functions of the efficient staff-officer, and to school youngsters before they gained an officer's commission. The Kriegsakademie in Prussia was founded in 1801 and the \u00c9cole sp\u00e9ciale militaire de Saint-Cyr was created by order of Napoleon Bonaparte in 1802 as a replacement for the \u00c9cole Royale Militaire of the Ancien R\u00e9gime (the institution that Napoleon himself had graduated from).\nThe Royal Military College, Sandhurst, in England was the brainchild of John Le Marchant in 1801, who established schools for the military instruction of officers at High Wycombe and Great Marlow, with a grant of \u00a330,000 from Parliament. The two original departments were later combined and moved to Sandhurst.\nIn the United States, the United States Military Academy (USMA) in West Point, New York was founded on March 16, 1802, and is one of five service academies in the nation.\nTypes.\nPre-collegiate institutions.\nA military school teaches children of various ages (elementary school, middle school or high school) in a military environment which includes training in military aspects, such as drill. Many military schools are also boarding schools, and others are simply magnet schools in a larger school system. Many are privately run institutions, though some are public and are run either by a public school system (such as the Chicago Public Schools) or by a state.\nAdult institutions.\nA college-level military academy is an institute of higher learning of things military. It is part of a larger system of military education and training institutions. The primary educational goal at military academies is to provide a high quality education that includes significant coursework and training in the fields of military tactics and military strategy. The amount of non-military coursework varies by both the institution and the country, and the amount of practical military experience gained varies as well.\nMilitary academies may or may not grant university degrees. In the US, graduates have a major field of study, earning a Bachelor's degree in that subject just as at other universities. However, in British academies, the graduate does not achieve a university degree, since the whole of the one-year course (undertaken mainly but not exclusively by university graduates) is dedicated to military training.\nThere are two types of military academies: national (government-run) and state/private-run.\nArgentina.\nArgentine Army:\nArgentine Navy:\nArgentine Air Force:\nBrazil.\nBasic Education.\n(offers an education with military values for civilians students of primary and secondary school)Brazilian Army:\nPreparatory Schools.\n(prepares students for admission to one of the official training academies)Brazilian Army:\nBrazil's Navy:\nBrazilian Air Force:\nSailor and Marine Soldier Training.\nBrazil's Navy:\nSergeants Training.\nBrazilian Army:\nBrazil's Navy:\nBrazilian Air Force:\nOfficers Training.\nBrazilian Army:\nBrazil's navy:\nBrazilian Air Force:\nCanada.\nTwo post-secondary military academies are operated under the Canadian Military Colleges system, the Royal Military College of Canada (RMCC) in Kingston, Ontario; and Royal Military College Saint-Jean (RMC Saint-Jean) in Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Quebec. RMCC was established in 1876, while RMC Saint-Jean was established in 1954. The two institutions provided military education to officer cadets of all three elements in the Canadian Forces; the navy, army and air force; with RMC granted the authority to confer academic degrees in arts, science and engineering by the 1960s. From 1940 to 1995, the Department of National Defence operated a third military college in Victoria, British Columbia, known as Royal Roads Military College (RRMC).\nGraduates of the colleges are widely acknowledged to have had a disproportionate impact in the Canadian services and society, thanks to the solid foundations provided by their military education. Military discipline and training, as well as a focus on physical fitness and fluency in both of Canada's two official languages, English and French, provided cadets with ample challenges and a very fulfilling experience. In 1995 the Department of National Defence was forced to close RRMC and RMC Saint-Jean due to budget considerations, but RMCC continues to operate. (In the fall of 1995, the campus reopened as a civilian institution, Royal Roads University.) In 2007, the Department of National Defence reopened RMC Saint-Jean as a military academy that offers equivalent schooling as CEGEP, a level of post-secondary education in Quebec's education system. In 2021 RMC Saint-Jean was returned to university status and had officer cadets graduate and received their commission for the first time since 1995.\nIn addition to Canadian Military Colleges, the Canadian Armed Forces also operate a number of training centres and schools, including the Canadian Forces College, and the Canadian Forces Language School. The components of the Canadian Armed Forces also maintain training centres and schools. The Canadian Army Doctrine and Training Centre (CADTC) is a formation in the Army that delivers combat, and doctrinal training. The CADTC includes several training establishments, such as the Canadian Manoeuvre Training Centre, Combat Training Centre, Command and Staff College, and the Peace Support Training Centre. The 2 Canadian Air Division is the formation responsible for training in the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF), and includes establishments like the Royal Canadian Air Force Academy, 2 Canadian Forces Flying Training School, and 3 Canadian Forces Flying Training School. The RCAF also maintains the Canadian Forces School of Survival and Aeromedical Training.\nIn addition to publicly operated institutions, Canada is also home to one private military boarding school, Robert Land Academy, in West Lincoln, Ontario. Founded in 1978, it is an all-boys' institute that is fully accredited by Ontario's Ministry of Education. The school offers elementary and secondary levels of education, providing schooling for students from Grade 6 to Grade 12.\nColombia.\nNational Army of Colombia:\nColombian Air Force:\nColombian Naval Infantry and Colombian Navy:\nNational Police of Colombia:\nGermany.\nThe standard education in military leadership is the task of the \"Offizierschulen\" (officers' schools) run by the three branches. The contents differ from branch to branch. According to the doctrine \"leading by task\", in the army all prospective platoon leaders are trained down to the level of a commander of a mixed combat battalion. There they also have to pass an officer exam to become commissioned later on.\nMoreover, there exist so called \"Waffenschulen\" (schools of weapons) like infantry school or artillery school. There the officers learn to deal with the typical tasks of their respective corps.\nA specialty of the German concept of officer formation is the academic education. Germany runs two \"Universities of the German Federal Armed Forces\" where almost every future officer has to pass non-military studies and achieve a bachelor's or master's degree. During their studies (after at least three years of service) the candidates become commissioned \"Leutnant\" (second lieutenant).\nThe three officer's schools are:\nAcademic and staff education:\nGreece.\nThe Hellenic Armed Forces have military academies supervised by each branch of the Armed Forces individually:\n\"Highest Military Academies (\u0391\u03a3\u03a3) or Higher Military Educational Institutions (\u0391\u03a3\u0395\u0399):\"\n\"Higher Military NCO Academies (\u0391\u03a3\u03a3\u03a5):\"\nDespite their names (), their alumni can advance to the rank of Antisyntagmatarchis/Antipterachos/Antiploiarchos.\nIndonesia.\nThe Indonesian Military Academy was founded in Yogyakarta, October 13, 1945, by the order of General Staff Chief of Indonesia Army Lieutenant General Urip Sumohardjo as the Militaire Academie (MA) Yogyakarta.\nCurrently, the Tentara Nasional Indonesia or the TNI (Indonesian National Armed Forces), under the supervision of the Commanding General of the Indonesian National Armed Forces Academy System (a two or three-star officer in billet) in the HQ of the Indonesian National Armed Forces, has divided the academies into the three respective services:\nEach service academy is headed by a two-star general who serves as superintendent, and his/her deputy is a one-star officer. All the students (cadets/midshipman) are recruited from senior high school graduates from all over Indonesia. Shortly after graduation, they are commissioned as \"Letnan Dua\" (Second Lieutenant/Ensign) in their respective service branches and receive a bachelor's degree comparable to those awarded by civil academies or universities. The length term is now 4 years and is divided into five grades of cadets' ranks, starting from the lowest:\n\"Taruna\" is also a nickname to cadets in the Military, Naval, and Air Force Academies, however other nicknames such as \"Kadet\" refers to cadets in the Naval Academy, while \"Karbol\" refers to cadets in the Air Force Academy. The term \"Taruna\" however still applies to all cadets from the three academies.\nUntil 1999, before the Indonesian National Police officially separated from the armed forces, the Indonesian Police Academy (\"AKPOL\") also stood under the National Armed Forces Academy but now has separated from the Military and is under the auspices of the President of Indonesia controlled by the National Police Headquarters (\"Mabes Polri\"), where in the other hand the Armed Forces (Army, Naval, and Air Force) Academies of Indonesia is under the auspices of the Ministry of Defense controlled by the Armed Forces General Headquarters (\"Mabes TNI\"). Presently, the Police Academy is in Semarang (Central Java), and is supervised under the supervision of the Chief of the Indonesian National Police (\"Kapolri\").\nAll three academies and the Police Academy have a joint 4th class cadet training program since 2008, after completing it the cadets go to their respective academies to continue with the three remaining years of study before commissioning.\nIran.\nIran has five main military universities:\nItaly.\nHigh school level institutions (only for classical and scientific liceum, starting from grade 10):\n2009\u20132010 school year was the first school year with girls attending.\nNon Commissioned Officer (NCO) schools:\nUniversity level institutions:\nMalaysia.\nSecondary level institutions:\nUniversity level:\nSpecialist training and staff institutions:\nReserve Officer Training Units ( or ) or ROTU exists only in public universities in Malaysia.

The purpose of such institutions is the military training of students and cadets under the reserve officer training program, and some of them conduct training, retraining and advanced training of military specialists of the appropriate levels of higher education (bachelor or master) for military service in the Armed Forces of Ukraine, others formed in accordance with the laws Ukrainian military formations (Defence Forces of Ukraine), as well as law enforcement agencies for special purposes (Security Forces of Ukraine) and the State Transport Special Service of Ukraine.\nCadets corp (Lyceum with enhanced military and physical training).\nA number of public state and regional lyceum (high school) with enhanced military and physical training (boarding schools) such of cadet corps in other countries.\nUnited Kingdom.\nPre-University level institution.\nThere are also numerous Cadet forces that operate for all branches of the armed forces for children aged 10\u201320. These are not designed to recruit people into the armed forces but rather are simply Ministry of Defence sponsored youth organisations.\nUndergraduate service.\nAlthough an undergraduate degree is not a prerequisite for officer training, the majority of potential officers will have attended university before joining the Armed Forces. At some universities there may be the option for people to join either a University Royal Naval Unit, a University Officer Training Corps (UOTC) or a University Air Squadron, which are designed to introduce students to life in the Forces and show them the careers that are available as well as allowing them to undertake reserve training alongside their degree. People sponsored under the Defence Technical Undergraduate Scheme will join one of the four Support Units attached to universities participating in DTUS. There is a requirement for bursars of DTUS to join the military for three years after completion of their degree, there no requirement for students of any other organisation to join the military after they finish their degree programs. Although service with these organisations may give some initial benefit to officer cadets attending the military colleges/academies, the next stage of the officer training programs assumes no prior military experience/knowledge, and those that did not partake in military activities at university are not disadvantaged.\nOfficer training.\nThere are now four military academies in the United Kingdom. Although the curriculum at each varies due to the differing nature of the service a man or woman is joining, it is a combination of military and academic study that is designed to turn young civilians into comprehensively trained military officers.\nOfficer Training for the Reserve Forces (e.g. Army Reserve, Royal Naval Reserve, RAF Reserves and Royal Marines Reserves) also takes place at the relevant military academies, but under a different curriculum and the courses tend to be concentrated into a much shorter period \u2013 a significant amount of the study will be undertaken at the officer cadet's reserve unit.\n*Royal College of Defence Studies (mainly for officers of Colonel/Brigadier or equivalent rank selected as future senior leaders; highly selective)\n*Joint Services Command and Staff College (courses for officers from Major to Brigadier or equivalent rank)\n*Defence College of Management and Technology\n*Armed Forces Chaplaincy Centre\n*Advanced Research and Assessment Group\n*Conflict Studies Research Centre\nUnited States.\nIntroduction.\nIn the United States, the term \"military academy\" does not necessarily mean a government-owned institution run by the armed forces to train its own officers. It may also mean a middle school, high school, or college, whether public or private, which instructs its students in military-style education, discipline and tradition. Students at such civilian institutions can earn a commission in the U.S. military through the successful completion of a Reserve Officer Training Corps program along with their college or university's academic coursework.\nMost state-level military academies maintain both a civilian student body and a traditional corps of cadets. The only exception is the Virginia Military Institute, which remains all-military.\nFederal service academies.\nThe colleges operated by the U.S. Federal Government, referred to as federal service academies, are:\nSenior and junior military colleges.\nThere is one all-military state-sponsored military academy:\nIn addition, these five institutions that were military colleges at the time of their founding now maintain both a corps of cadets and a civilian student body. Many of these institutions also offer on-line degree programs:\nAlong with VMI, these institutions are known as the senior military colleges of the US.\nToday four institutions are considered military junior colleges (MJC). These four military schools participate in the Army's two-year Early Commissioning Program, an Army ROTC program where qualified students can earn a commission as a Second Lieutenant after only two years of college. The four military Junior colleges are as follows:\nMerchant Marine Academies that have military academy-style operations.\nThere are six state-operated Merchant Marine academies:\nThese merchant marine academies operate on a military college system. Part of the training that the cadets receive is naval and military in nature. Cadets may apply for Naval Reserve commissions upon obtaining their Merchant Marine Officer's licenses. Most if not all also offer some form of military commissioning program into the active duty US Navy, US Marine Corps, or US Coast Guard.\nStaff colleges.\nThe United States staff colleges, mandated to serve the needs of officers for post-graduate studies and other such graduate institutions as mandated by the Department of Defense are:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He co-founded Studio Ghibli and serves as its honorary chairman. Throughout his career, Miyazaki has attained international acclaim as a masterful storyteller and creator of Japanese animated feature films, and is widely regarded as one of the most accomplished filmmakers in the history of animation.\nBorn in Tokyo City, Miyazaki expressed interest in manga and animation from an early age. He joined Toei Animation in 1963, working as an inbetween artist and key animator on films like \"Gulliver's Travels Beyond the Moon\" (1965), \"Puss in Boots\" (1969), and \"Animal Treasure Island\" (1971), before moving to A-Pro in 1971, where he co-directed \"Lupin the Third Part I\" (1971\u20131972) alongside Isao Takahata. After moving to Zuiy\u014d Eiz\u014d (later Nippon Animation) in 1973, Miyazaki worked as an animator on \"World Masterpiece Theater\" and directed the television series \"Future Boy Conan\" (1978). He joined Tokyo Movie Shinsha in 1979 to direct his first feature film \"The Castle of Cagliostro\" (1979) and the television series \"Sherlock Hound\" (1984\u20131985). He wrote and illustrated the manga \"Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind\" (1982\u20131994) and directed the 1984 film adaptation produced by Topcraft.\nMiyazaki co-founded Studio Ghibli in 1985, writing and directing films such as \"\" (1986), \"My Neighbor Totoro\" (1988), \"Kiki's Delivery Service\" (1989), and \"Porco Rosso\" (1992), which were met with critical and commercial success in Japan. Miyazaki's \"Princess Mononoke\" (1997) was the first animated film to win the Japan Academy Film Prize for Picture of the Year and briefly became the highest-grossing film in Japan; its Western distribution increased Ghibli's worldwide popularity and influence. \"Spirited Away\" (2001) became Japan's highest-grossing film and won the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature; it is frequently ranked among the greatest films of the 21st century. Miyazaki's later films\u2014\"Howl's Moving Castle\" (2004), \"Ponyo\" (2008), and \"The Wind Rises\" (2013)\u2014also enjoyed critical and commercial success. He retired from feature films in 2013 but later returned to make \"The Boy and the Heron\" (2023), which won the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature.\nMiyazaki's works are frequently subject to scholarly analysis and have been characterized by the recurrence of themes such as humanity's relationship with nature and technology, the importance of art and craftsmanship, and the difficulty of maintaining a pacifist ethic in a violent world. His protagonists are often strong girls or young women, and several of his films present morally ambiguous antagonists with redeeming qualities. Miyazaki's works have been highly praised and awarded; he was named a Person of Cultural Merit for outstanding cultural contributions in 2012, received the Academy Honorary Award for his impact on animation and cinema in 2014, and the Ramon Magsaysay Award in 2024. Miyazaki has frequently been cited as an inspiration for numerous animators, directors, and writers.\nEarly life.\nHayao Miyazaki was born on January 5, 1941, in the town Akebono-cho in Hong\u014d, Tokyo City, Empire of Japan, the second of four sons. His father, Katsuji Miyazaki (born 1915), was the director of Miyazaki Airplane, his brother's company, which manufactured rudders for fighter planes during World War II. The business allowed his family to remain affluent during Miyazaki's early life. Miyazaki's father enjoyed purchasing paintings and demonstrating them to guests, but otherwise had little known artistic understanding. He was in the Imperial Japanese Army around 1940, discharged and lectured about disloyalty after declaring to his commanding officer that he wished not to fight because of his wife and young child. According to Miyazaki, his father often told him about his exploits, claiming he continued to attend nightclubs after turning 70. Katsuji Miyazaki died on March 18, 1993. After his death, Miyazaki felt he had often looked at his father negatively and that he had never said anything \"lofty or inspiring\". He regretted not having a serious discussion with his father, and felt he had inherited his \"anarchistic feelings and his lack of concern about embracing contradictions\".\nSome of Miyazaki's earliest memories are of \"bombed-out cities\". In 1944, when he was three years old, Miyazaki's family evacuated to Utsunomiya. After the city was bombed in July 1945, they evacuated to Kanuma. The bombing left a lasting impression on Miyazaki, then aged four. As a child, he suffered from digestive problems, and was told he would not live beyond 20, making him feel like an outcast; he considered himself \"clumsy and weak\", protected at school by his older brother. From 1947 to 1955, Miyazaki's mother Yoshiko suffered from spinal tuberculosis; she spent the first few years in hospital before being nursed from home, forcing Miyazaki and his siblings to take over domestic duties. Yoshiko was frugal, and described as a strict, intellectual woman who regularly questioned \"socially accepted norms\". She was closest with Miyazaki, and had a strong influence on him and his later work, inspiring several of his characters. Yoshiko Miyazaki died in July 1983 at the age of 72.\nMiyazaki began school as an evacuee in 1947, at an elementary school in Utsunomiya, completing the first through third grades. After his family moved back to Suginami-ku in 1950, Miyazaki completed the fourth grade at \u014cmiya Elementary School, and fifth grade at Eifuku Elementary School, which was newly established after splitting off from \u014cmiya Elementary. After graduating from Eifuku as part of the first graduating class, he attended . He aspired to become a manga artist, but discovered he could not draw people; instead, he drew planes, tanks, and battleships for several years. Miyazaki was influenced by several manga artists, such as Tetsuji Fukushima, and Osamu Tezuka. Miyazaki destroyed much of his early work, believing it was \"bad form\" to copy Tezuka's style as it was hindering his own development as an artist. He preferred to see artists like Tezuka as fellow artists rather than idols to worship. Around this time, Miyazaki often saw movies with his father, who was an avid moviegoer; memorable films for Miyazaki include \"Meshi\" (1951) and \"Tasogare Sakaba\" (1955).\nAfter graduating from \u014cmiya Junior High, Miyazaki attended Toyotama High School. During his third and final year, Miyazaki's interest in animation was sparked by \"The White Snake Enchantress\" (1958), Japan's first feature-length animated film in color; he had sneaked out to watch the film instead of studying for his entrance exams. Miyazaki later recounted that, falling in love with its heroine, the film moved him to tears and left a profound impression, prompting him to create work true to his own feelings instead of imitating popular trends; he wrote the film's \"pure, earnest world\" promoted a side of him that \"yearned desperately to affirm the world rather than negate it\". After graduating from Toyotama, Miyazaki attended Gakushuin University in the department of political economy, majoring in Japanese Industrial Theory; he considered himself a poor student as he instead focused on art. He joined the \"Children's Literature Research Club\", the \"closest thing back then to a comics club\"; he was sometimes the sole member of the club. In his free time, Miyazaki would visit his art teacher from middle school and sketch in his studio, where the two would drink and \"talk about politics, life, all sorts of things\". Around this time, he also drew manga; he never completed any stories, but accumulated thousands of pages of the beginnings of stories. He also frequently approached manga publishers to license their stories. In 1960, Miyazaki was a bystander during the Anpo protests, having developed an interest after seeing photographs in \"Asahi Graph\"; by that point, he was too late to participate in the demonstrations. Miyazaki graduated from Gakushuin in 1963 with degrees in political science and economics.\nCareer.\nEarly career.\nIn 1963, Miyazaki was employed at Toei Doga; this was the last year the company hired regularly. He began renting a four-and-a-half \"tatami\" () apartment in Nerima, Tokyo, near Toei's studio; the rent was \u00a5, while his salary at Toei was \u00a5. Miyazaki worked as an inbetween artist on the theatrical feature films \"Doggie March\" (1963) and \"Gulliver's Travels Beyond the Moon\" (1965) and the television anime \"Wolf Boy Ken\" (1963). His proposed changes to the ending of \"Gulliver's Travels Beyond the Moon\" were accepted by its director; he was uncredited but his work was praised. Miyazaki found inbetween art unsatisfying and wanted to work on more expressive designs. He was a leader in a labor dispute soon after his arrival at Toei, and became chief secretary of its labor union in 1964; its vice-chairman was Isao Takahata, with whom Miyazaki would form a lifelong collaboration and friendship. Around this time, Miyazaki questioned his career choice and considered leaving the industry; a screening of \"The Snow Queen\" in 1964 moved him, prompting him to continue working \"with renewed determination\".\nDuring production of the anime series \"Sh\u014dnen Ninja Kaze no Fujimaru\" (1964\u20131965), Miyazaki moved from inbetween art to key animation, and worked in the latter role on two episodes of \"Sally the Witch\" (1966\u20131968) and several of \"Hustle Punch\" (1965\u20131966) and \"Rainbow Sentai Robin\" (1966\u20131967). Concerned that opportunities for creative projects and feature films would become scarce following an increase in animated television, Miyazaki volunteered in 1964 to work on the film \"The Great Adventure of Horus, Prince of the Sun\" (1968); he was chief animator, concept artist, and scene designer, credited as the latter. On the film, he worked closely with his mentor, Yasuo \u014ctsuka, whose approach to animation profoundly influenced Miyazaki's work. Directed by Takahata, the film was highly praised and deemed a pivotal work in the evolution of animation, though its limited release and minimal promotion led to disappointing box office results\u2014among Toei Animation's worst, which threatened the studio financially. Miyazaki moved to a residence in Higashimurayama after his wedding in October 1965, to \u014cizumigakuench\u014d after the birth of his second son in April 1969, and to Tokorozawa in 1970.\nMiyazaki provided key animation for \"The Wonderful World of Puss 'n Boots\" (1969), directed by Kimio Yabuki. He created a 12-chapter manga series as a promotional tie-in for the film; the series ran in the Sunday edition of \"Tokyo Shimbun\" from January to March 1969. Miyazaki later proposed scenes in the screenplay for \"Flying Phantom Ship\" (1969) in which military tanks would cause mass hysteria in downtown Tokyo, and was hired to storyboard and animate the scenes. Beginning a shift towards slow-paced productions featuring mostly female protagonists, he provided key animation for \"Moomin\" (1969), two episodes of \"Himitsu no Akko-chan\" (1969\u20131970), and one episode of \"Sarutobi Ecchan\" (1971), and was organizer and key animator for \"Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves\" (1971). Under the pseudonym , Miyazaki wrote and illustrated the manga \"People of the Desert\", published in 26 installments between September 1969 and March 1970 in . He was influenced by illustrated stories such as Fukushima's . In 1971, Miyazaki developed structure, characters, and designs for Hiroshi Ikeda's adaptation of \"Animal Treasure Island\", providing key animation and script development. He created the 13-part manga adaptation, printed in \"Tokyo Shimbun\" from January to March 1971.\nA-Pro and Nippon Animation.\nMiyazaki left Toei Animation in August 1971, having become dissatisfied by the lack of creative prospects and autonomy, and by confrontations with management regarding \"The Great Adventure of Horus\". He followed Takahata and Y\u014dichi Kotabe to A-Pro, where he directed, or co-directed with Takahata, 17 of the 23 episodes of \"Lupin the Third Part I\", originally intended as a movie project. This was Miyazaki's directorial debut. He and Takahata were engaged to emphasize the series' humor over its violence. The two also began pre-production on a series based on Astrid Lindgren's \"Pippi Longstocking\" books, designing extensive storyboards; Miyazaki and Tokyo Movie Shinsha president Yutaka Fujioka traveled to Sweden to secure the rights\u2014Miyazaki's first trip outside Japan and possibly the first overseas trip for any Japanese animator for a production\u2014but the series was canceled after they were unable to meet Lindgren, and permission was refused to complete the project. Foreign travel left an impression on Miyazaki; using concepts, scripts, design, and animation from the project, he wrote, designed and animated two \"Panda! Go, Panda!\" shorts in 1972 and 1973, with Takahata as director and \u014ctsuka as animation director. Their choice of pandas was inspired by the panda craze in Japan at the time.\nMiyazaki drew storyboards for the first episode of \"The Gutsy Frog\" in 1971 (though they went unused), provided key animation and storyboards for two episodes of \"Akado Suzunosuke\" in 1972, and delivered key animation for one episode each of \"K\u014dya no Sh\u014dnen Isamu\" (directed by Takahata) and \"Samurai Giants\" in 1973. In 1972, he directed a five-minute pilot film for the television series \"Yuki's Sun\"; the series was never produced, and the pilot fell into obscurity before resurfacing as part of a Blu-ray release of Miyazaki's works in 2014. In June 1973, Miyazaki and Takahata moved from A-Pro to Zuiy\u014d Eiz\u014d, where they worked on \"World Masterpiece Theater\", which featured their animation series \"Heidi, Girl of the Alps\", an adaptation of Johanna Spyri's \"Heidi\". The production team wanted the series to set new heights for television animation, and Miyazaki traveled to Switzerland to research and sketch in preparation. Zuiy\u014d Eiz\u014d split into two companies in July 1975; Miyazaki and Takahata's branch became Nippon Animation. They briefly worked on \"Dog of Flanders\" in 1975 before moving on to the larger-scale \"3000 Leagues in Search of Mother\" (1976), directed by Takahata, for which Miyazaki traveled to Argentina and Italy as research.\nDirectorial debut.\nIn 1977, Miyazaki was chosen to direct his first animated television series, \"Future Boy Conan\"; he directed 24 of the 26 episodes, which were broadcast in 1978. Only eight episodes were completed when the series began airing; each episode was completed within ten to fourteen days. An adaptation of Alexander Key's \"The Incredible Tide\", the series features several elements that later reappeared in Miyazaki's work, such as warplanes, airplanes, and environmentalism. Also working on the series was Takahata, \u014ctsuka, and Yoshifumi Kond\u014d, whom Miyazaki and Takahata had met at A-Pro. Visually, Miyazaki was inspired by Paul Grimault's \"The Adventures of Mr. Wonderbird\". Miyazaki did key animation for thirty episodes of the \"World Masterpiece Theater\" series \"Rascal the Raccoon\" (1977) and provided scene design and organization on the first fifteen episodes of Takahata's \"Anne of Green Gables\" before leaving Nippon Animation in 1979.\nMiyazaki moved to Tokyo Movie Shinsha to direct his first feature anime film, \"The Castle of Cagliostro\" (1979), an installment of the \"Lupin III\" franchise. \u014ctsuka had approached him to direct the film following the release of \"\" (1978), and Miyazaki wrote the story with . Wishing to insert his own creativity into the franchise, Miyazaki inserted several elements and references, inspired by several of Maurice Leblanc's Ars\u00e8ne Lupin novels, on which \"Lupin III\" is based, as well as \"The Adventures of Mr. Wonderbird\". Visually, he was inspired by Kagoshima Publishing's \"Italian Mountain Cities and the Tiber Estuary\", reflecting his love for Europe. Production ran for four months and the film was released on December 15, 1979; Miyazaki wished he could have had another month of production. It was well received; \"Animage\" readers voted it the best animation of all time\u2014it remained in the top ten for more than fifteen years\u2014and Clarisse the best heroine. In 2005, former princess Sayako Kuroda's wedding dress was reportedly inspired by Clarisse's, having been a fan of Miyazaki and his work. Several Japanese and American filmmakers were inspired by the film, prompting homages in other works.\nMiyazaki became a chief animation instructor for new employees at Telecom Animation Film, a subsidiary of Tokyo Movie Shinsha. and subsequently directed two episodes of \"Lupin the Third Part II\" under the pseudonym , which can read as \"employee of Telecom\". In his role at Telecom, Miyazaki helped train the second wave of employees. Miyazaki provided key animation for one episode of \"The New Adventures of Gigantor\" (1980\u20131981), and directed six episodes of \"Sherlock Hound\" in 1981, until legal issues with Arthur Conan Doyle's estate led to a suspension in production; Miyazaki was busy with other projects by the time the issues were resolved, and the remaining episodes were directed by Ky\u00f4suke Mikuriya and broadcast from November 1984 to May 1985. It was Miyazaki's final television work. In 1982, Miyazaki, Takahata, and Kond\u014d started work on a film adaptation of \"Little Nemo\", but Miyazaki and Takahata left after a few months due to creative clashes with Fujioka (Kond\u014d remained until 1985); the film was completed six years later as \"\" (1989). Miyazaki spent some time in the United States during the film's production.\nManga work and adaptation.\nAfter the release of \"The Castle of Cagliostro\", Miyazaki began working on his ideas for an animated film adaptation of Richard Corben's comic book \"Rowlf\" and pitched the idea to Yutaka Fujioka at Tokyo Movie Shinsha. In November 1980, a proposal was drawn up to acquire the film rights. Around that time, Miyazaki was also approached for a series of magazine articles by \"Animage\"'s editorial staff. Editors Toshio Suzuki and Osamu Kameyama took some of his ideas to \"Animage\"'s parent company, Tokuma Shoten, which had been considering funding animated films. Two projects were proposed: , to be set in the Sengoku period; and the adaptation of Corben's \"Rowlf\". Both were rejected, as the company was unwilling to fund anime not based on existing manga and the rights for \"Rowlf\" could not be secured. Elements of Miyazaki's proposal for \"Rowlf\" were recycled in his later works. With no films in production, Miyazaki agreed to develop a manga for the magazine, titled \"Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind\". \nMiyazaki had intended to stop making the manga when he received animation work; while he took some breaks in releases, the manga ultimately ran from February 1982 to March 1994. Miyazaki's busy schedule and perfectionist mindset led to several delays in publications, and on one occasion he withdrew some chapters before publication; he considered its continued publication a burden on his other work. The story, as re-printed in the volumes, spans seven volumes for a combined total of 1,060 pages. It sold more than ten million copies in its first two years. Miyazaki drew the episodes primarily in pencil, and it was printed monochrome in sepia-toned ink. The main character, Nausica\u00e4, was partly inspired by the character from Homer's \"Odyssey\" (whom Miyazaki had discovered while reading Bernard Evslin's \"Dictionary of Grecian Myths\") and the Japanese folk tale \"The Lady who Loved Insects\", while the world and ecosystem was based on Miyazaki's readings of scientific, historical, and political writings, such as 's \"Origins of Plant Cultivation and Agriculture\", 's \"The World of Jomon\", Paul Carell's \"Hitler Moves East\". He was also inspired by the comic series \"Arzach\" by Jean Giraud, whom he met while working on the manga.\nIn 1982, Miyazaki assisted with key animation for an unreleased Zorro series, and for the feature film '. He resigned from Telecom Animation Film in November. Around this time, he wrote the graphic novel \"The Journey of Shuna\", inspired by the Tibetan folk tale \"Prince who became a dog\". The novel was published by Tokuma Shoten in June 1983, dramatized for radio broadcast in 1987, and published in English as \"Shuna's Journey\" in 2022. \"Hayao Miyazaki's Daydream Data Notes\" was also irregularly published from November 1984 to October 1994 in '; selections of the stories received radio broadcast in 1995. Following the completion of \"Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind\"'s first two volumes, \"Animage\" editors suggested a 15-minute short film adaptation. Miyazaki, initially reluctant, countered that an hour-long animation would be more suitable, and Tokuma Shoten agreed on a feature-length film.\nProduction began on May 31, 1983, with animation beginning in August; funding was provided through a joint venture between Tokuma Shoten and the advertising agency Hakuhodo, for whom Miyazaki's youngest brother worked. Animation studio Topcraft was chosen as the production house. Miyazaki found some of Topcraft's staff unreliable, and brought on several of his previous collaborators, including Takahata, who served as producer, though he was reluctant to do so. Pre-production began on May 31, 1983; Miyazaki encountered difficulties in creating the screenplay, with only sixteen chapters of the manga to work with. Takahata enlisted experimental and minimalist musician Joe Hisaishi to compose the film's score; he subsequently worked on all of Miyazaki's feature films.\nFor the film, Miyazaki's imagination was sparked by the mercury poisoning of Minamata Bay and how nature responded and thrived in a poisoned environment, using it to create the film's polluted world. For the lead role of Nausica\u00e4, Miyazaki cast Sumi Shimamoto, who had impressed him as Clarisse in \"The Castle of Cagliostro\" and Maki in \"Lupin the Third Part II\". \"Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind\" was created in ten months, and released on March 11, 1984. It grossed \u00a51.48 billion at the box office, and made an additional \u00a5742 million in distribution income. It is often seen as Miyazaki's pivotal work, cementing his reputation as an animator. It was lauded for its positive portrayal of women, particularly Nausica\u00e4. Several critics have labeled \"Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind\" as possessing anti-war and feminist themes; Miyazaki argues otherwise, stating he only wishes to entertain. He felt Nausica\u00e4's ability to understand her opponent rather than simply defeat them meant she had to be female. The successful cooperation on the creation of the manga and the film laid the foundation for other collaborative projects. In April 1984, Miyazaki and Takahata created a studio to handle copyright of their work, naming it Nibariki (meaning \"Two-Horse Power\", the nickname for the Citro\u00ebn 2CV, which Miyazaki drove), for which an office was secured in Suginami Ward, with Miyazaki serving as the senior partner.\nStudio Ghibli.\nFoundation and \"Laputa\" (1985\u20131987).\nFollowing the success of \"Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind\", Miyazaki and Takahata founded the animation production company Studio Ghibli on June 15, 1985, as a subsidiary of Tokuma Shoten, with offices in Kichij\u014dji designed by Miyazaki. The studio's name had been registered a year earlier; Miyazaki named it after the nickname of the Caproni Ca.309 aircraft, meaning \"a hot wind that blows in the desert\" in Italian. Suzuki worked for Studio Ghibli as producer, joining full-time in 1989, while Topcraft's T\u014dru Hara became production manager; Suzuki's role in the creation of the studio and its films has led him to being occasionally named a co-founder, and Hara is often viewed as influential to the company's success. Yasuyoshi Tokuma, the founder of Tokuma Shoten, was also closely related to the company's creation, having provided financial backing. Topcraft had been considered as a partner to produce Miyazaki's next film, but the company went bankrupt in 1985. Several staff members subsequently hired at Studio Ghibli\u2014up to 70 full-time and 200 part-time employees in 1985\u2014had previously worked with Miyazaki at different studios, such as Telecom, Topcraft, and Toei Doga, and others like Madhouse, Inc. and Oh! Production.\nIn 1984, Miyazaki traveled to Wales, drawing the mining villages and communities of Rhondda; he witnessed the miners' strike and admired the miners' dedication to their work and community. He was angered by the \"military superpowers\" of the Roman Empire who conquered the Celts and felt this anguish, alongside the miners' strike, was perceptible in Welsh communities. He returned in May 1985 to research his next film, \"\", the first by Studio Ghibli. Its tight production schedule forced Miyazaki to work all day, including before and after normal working hours, and he wrote lyrics for its end theme. Miyazaki used the floating island of Laputa from \"Gulliver's Travels\" in the film. \"Laputa\" was released on August 2, 1986, by the Toei Company. It sold around 775,000 tickets, making a modest financial return, though Miyazaki and Suzuki expressed their disappointment with its box office figures of approximately US$.\nAfter the success of \"Nausica\u00e4\", Miyazaki visited Yanagawa and considered imitating it in an animated film, fascinated by its canal system; instead, Takahata directed a live-action documentary about the region, \"The Story of Yanagawa's Canals\" (1987). Miyazaki produced and financed the film, and provided several animated sequences. Its creation spanned four years, and Miyazaki considered it his social responsibility\u2014to both Japanese society and filmmaking\u2014in seeing it produced. \"Laputa\" was created partly to fund production of the documentary, for which Takahata had depleted his funds. In June 1985, \"Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind\" was released in the United States as \"Warriors of the Wind\", with significant cuts; almost 30 minutes of dialogue and character development were removed, erasing parts of its plot and themes. Miyazaki and Takahata subsequently refused to consider Western releases of their films for the following decade.\n\"My Neighbor Totoro\" and \"Kiki's Delivery Service\" (1987\u20131989).\nMiyazaki's next film, \"My Neighbor Totoro\", originated in ideas he had as a child; he felt \"\"Totoro\" is where my consciousness began\". An attempt to pitch \"My Neighbor Totoro\" to Tokuma Shoten in the early 1980s had been unsuccessful, and Miyazaki faced difficulty in attempting to pitch it again in 1987. Suzuki proposed that \"Totoro\" be released as a double bill alongside Takahata's \"Grave of the Fireflies\"; as the latter, based on the 1967 short story by Akiyuki Nosaka, had historical value, Suzuki predicted school students would be taken to watch both. \"Totoro\" features the theme of the relationship between the environment and humanity, showing that harmony is the result of respecting the environment. The film also references Miyazaki's mother; the child protagonists' mother is bedridden. As with \"Laputa\", Miyazaki wrote lyrics for \"Totoro\"'s end theme.\nMiyazaki struggled with the film's script until he read a \"Mainichi Graph\" story about Japan forty years prior, opting to set the film in the country before Tokyo's expansion and the advent of television. Miyazaki has subsequently donated money and artwork to fund preservation of the forested land in Saitama Prefecture, in which the film is set. Production of \"My Neighbor Totoro\" began in April 1987 and took exactly a year; it was released on April 16, 1988. While the film received critical acclaim, it was only moderately successful at the box office. Studio Ghibli approved merchandising rights in 1990, which led to major commercial success; merchandise profits alone were able to sustain the studio for years. The film was labeled a cult classic, eventually gaining success in the United States after its release in 1993, where its home video release sold almost 500,000 copies. Akira Kurosawa said the film moved him, naming it among his hundred favorite films\u2014one of few Japanese films to be named. An asteroid discovered by Takao Kobayashi in December 1994 was named after the film: 10160 Totoro.\nIn 1987, Studio Ghibli acquired the rights to create a film adaptation of Eiko Kadono's novel \"Kiki's Delivery Service\". Miyazaki's work on \"My Neighbor Totoro\" prevented him from directing the adaptation; he acted as producer, while Sunao Katabuchi was chosen as director and Nobuyuki Isshiki as script writer. Miyazaki's dissatisfaction of Isshiki's first draft led him to make changes to the project, ultimately taking the role of director. Kadono expressed her dissatisfaction with the differences between the book and screenplay, but Miyazaki and Takahata convinced her to let production continue. The film was originally intended to be a 60-minute special, but expanded into a feature film after Miyazaki completed the storyboards and screenplay. Miyazaki felt the struggles of the protagonist, Kiki, reflected the feelings of young girls in Japan yearning to live independently in cities, while her talents reflected those of real girls, despite her magical powers. In preparation for production, Miyazaki and other senior staff members traveled to Sweden, where they captured eighty rolls of film in Stockholm and Visby, the former being the primary inspiration behind the film's city. \"Kiki's Delivery Service\" premiered on July 29, 1989; it was critically successful, winning the Anime Grand Prix. With more than 2.6 million tickets sold, it earned \u00a52.15 billion at the box office and was the highest-grossing film in Japan in 1989. Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli personally approved the subsequent English translations.\n\"Porco Rosso\" and co-productions (1989\u20131995).\nFrom March to May 1989, Miyazaki's manga was published in the magazine \"Model Graphix\", based on an earlier film idea he had assigned to a younger director in 1988 that fell through due to creative differences. Miyazaki began production on a 45-minute in-flight film for Japan Airlines based on the manga; Suzuki extended it into a feature-length film, titled \"Porco Rosso\", as expectations and budget grew. Miyazaki began work on the film with little assistance, as its production overlapped with Takahata's \"Only Yesterday\" (1991), which Miyazaki co-produced. The outbreak of the Yugoslav Wars in 1991 affected Miyazaki, prompting a more sombre tone for \"Porco Rosso\"; the Croatian War of Independence moved the film's setting from Dubrovnik to the Adriatic Sea. Miyazaki later referred to the film as \"foolish\", as its mature tones were unsuitable for children, noting he had made it for his \"own pleasure\" due to his love of planes.\nExcept for the Curtiss R3C-2, all planes in \"Porco Rosso\" are original creations from Miyazaki's imagination, based on his childhood memories. The film also pays homage to the work of Fleischer Studios and Winsor McCay, which were influential to Japanese animation in the 1940s. The film featured anti-war themes, which Miyazaki would later revisit. The protagonist's name, Marco Pagot, is the same as an Italian animator with whom Miyazaki had worked on \"Sherlock Hound\". Some female staff at Studio Ghibli considered the film's Piccolo factory\u2014led by a man and staffed by women\u2014an intentional mirroring of Studio Ghibli's staff, of whom many are women; some viewed it as Miyazaki's respect for their work ethic, though others felt it implied women were easier to exploit. Japan Airlines remained a major investor in the film, resulting in its initial premiere as an in-flight film, prior to its theatrical release on July 18, 1992. It was Miyazaki's first film not to top \"Animage\"'s yearly reader poll, which has been attributed to its mature focus. The film was commercially successful, becoming the highest-grossing film of the year in Japan; it remained one of the highest-grossing films for several years.\nDuring production of \"Porco Rosso\", Miyazaki spearheaded work on Studio Ghibli's new studio in Koganei, Tokyo, designing the blueprints, selecting materials, and working with builders. The studio opened in August 1992, and the staff moved in shortly after \"Porco Rosso\"'s release. Around this time, Miyazaki started work on the final volumes of the manga \"Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind\", which he created in-house at Studio Ghibli. In November, two television spots directed by Miyazaki were broadcast by Nippon Television Network (NTV): , a 90-second spot adapted from the illustrated story by Rieko Nakagawa and Yuriko Omura; and , a series of four five-second advertisements featuring an undefinable creature. Miyazaki assisted with the concept of Takahata's \"Pom Poko\" (1994), and designed the storyboards and wrote the screenplay for Kond\u014d's \"Whisper of the Heart\" (1995), being particularly involved in the latter's fantasy sequences. Critics and fans began to see Kond\u014d as \"the heir-apparent\" to Studio Ghibli.\n\"Princess Mononoke\" and global emergence (1995\u20131997).\nMiyazaki's next film, \"Princess Mononoke\", originated in sketches he had made in the late 1970s, based on Japanese folklore and the French fairytale \"Beauty and the Beast\"; his original ideas were rejected, and he published his sketches and initial story idea in a book in 1982. He revisited the project after the success of \"Porco Rosso\" allowed him more creative freedom. He chose the Muromachi period for the setting as he felt Japanese people stopped worshiping nature and began attempting to control it. Miyazaki began writing the film's treatment in August 1994. While experiencing writer's block in December, Miyazaki accepted a request to create \"On Your Mark\", a music video for the song by Chage and Aska. He experimented with computer animation to supplement traditional animation. \"On Your Mark\" premiered as a short before \"Whisper of the Heart\". The video's story was partly inspired by the Chernobyl disaster. Miyazaki intentionally made it cryptic, wanting viewers to interpret it themselves. Despite the video's popularity, Suzuki said it was not given \"100 percent\" focus.\nMiyazaki completed \"Princess Mononoke\"'s formal proposal in April 1995 and began working on storyboards in May. He had intended it to be his final directorial work at Studio Ghibli, citing his poorer eyesight and physical pains. In July 1996, the Walt Disney Company offered Tokuma Shoten a deal to distribute Studio Ghibli's films worldwide (except for Southeast Asia) through its Buena Vista and Miramax Films brands. Miyazaki approved the deal, not personally interested in the money and wanting to support Tokuma Shoten, who had earlier supported him. In May 1995, Miyazaki took four art directors to Yakushima\u2014which had previously provided inspiration for \"Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind\"\u2014to research the forests as inspiration; another art director, Kazuo Oga, traveled to Shirakami-Sanchi. The landscapes in the film were inspired by Yakushima. In \"Princess Mononoke\", Miyazaki revisited the ecological and political themes of \"Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind\". His historical research, including that of Eiichi Fujimori, led him to the conclusion that women had more freedom during the prehistoric Jomon period, and he opted to focus on ordinary people in society.\nMiyazaki felt the melancholy of the protagonist, Ashitaka, reflected his own attitude, while he compared Ashitaka's scar to modern physical conditions that children endure, like AIDS. Animation work began in July 1995, before the storyboards were completed\u2014a first for Miyazaki. He supervised the 144,000 cels in the film, about 80,000 of which were key animation. \"Princess Mononoke\" was produced with an estimated budget of \u00a52.35 billion (approximately US$), making it the most expensive Japanese animated film at the time. Approximately fifteen minutes of the film uses computer animation: about five minutes uses techniques such as 3D rendering, digital composition, and texture mapping; the remaining ten minutes uses digital ink and paint. While the original intention was to digitally paint 5,000 of the film's frames, time constraints doubled this, though it remained below ten percent of the final film. Animation was completed in mid-June 1997. Miyazaki collaborated directly with Hisaishi on the soundtrack from early in production; Hisaishi wrote an \"image album\" of pieces inspired by the story, which were reworked as production continued.\nUpon its premiere on July 12, 1997, \"Princess Mononoke\" was critically acclaimed, becoming the first animated film nominated for the Japan Academy Film Prize for Picture of the Year, which it won. The film was also commercially successful; it was watched by twelve million people by November, grossing US$, and became the highest-grossing film in Japan for several months. Its home video release sold over two million copies within three weeks, and over four million by December 1998. For the North American release, Miramax sought to make some cuts to obtain a lower rating than PG-13, but Studio Ghibli refused. Neil Gaiman wrote the English-language script; Miyazaki met him in September 1999 when he traveled to the United States for the film's release and expressed his pleasure at Gaiman's work. While it was largely unsuccessful at the American box office, grossing about US$, it was seen as the introduction of Studio Ghibli to global markets.\n\"Spirited Away\" and international acclaim (1997\u20132001).\nIn 1997, Miyazaki contributed to \"Visionaire\", an arthouse magazine. Tokuma Shoten merged with Studio Ghibli in June 1997. Within walking distance of Studio Ghibli, Miyazaki designed his private office, which he named Buta-ya (meaning \"pig house\"). It was intended as his retirement office for personal projects; he held his farewell party there in January 1998, having left Studio Ghibli on January 14 to be succeeded by Kond\u014d. However, Kond\u014d's death on January 21 impacted Miyazaki, and within days it was announced he would return to Studio Ghibli to direct a new film. A manga by Miyazaki, , was published in \"Model Graphix\" in December 1998, based on a book by German tank commander Otto Carius. Miyazaki officially returned to Studio Ghibli as its leader on January 16, 1999, taking an active role in employee organization.\nFrom 1998, Miyazaki worked on designs for the Ghibli Museum, dedicated to showcasing the studio's works, including several exclusive short films, for which production began in July 1999. Construction for the museum began in March 2000, and it officially opened on October 1, 2001, featuring the short film \"Kujiratori\". Miyazaki served as its executive director. In 1999, a Japanese theme park engaged Studio Ghibli to create a 20-minute short film about cats; Miyazaki agreed on the condition that it featured returning characters from \"Whisper of the Heart\". Aoi Hiiragi wrote a manga based on the concept, titled \"\". When the theme park withdrew, Miyazaki expanded the idea into a 45-minute film and, wanting to foster new talent at the studio, assigned it to first-time director Hiroyuki Morita. The film was released as \"The Cat Returns\" in 2002.\nMiyazaki's next film was conceived while on vacation at a mountain cabin with his family and five young girls who were family friends. Miyazaki realized he had not created a film for 10-year-old girls and set out to do so. He read manga magazines like and for inspiration but felt they only offered subjects on \"crushes and romance\", which is not what the girls \"held dear in their hearts\"; he decided to produce the film about a female heroine whom they could look up to, based on two of the girls he had met. Production of the film, titled \"Spirited Away\", commenced in 2000 on a budget of \u00a51.9 billion (US$). As with \"Princess Mononoke\", the staff experimented with computer animation, but kept the technology at a level to enhance the story, not to \"steal the show\". \"Spirited Away\" deals with symbols of human greed, symbolizing the 1980s Japanese asset price bubble, and a liminal journey through the realm of spirits. The film was released on July 20, 2001; it received critical acclaim, winning the Japan Academy Film Prize for Picture of the Year. The film was commercially successful, selling a record-breaking 21.4 million tickets and earning \u00a530.4 billion (US$) at the box office. It became the highest-grossing film in Japan, a record it maintained for almost 20 years, and was the first Japanese film to earn US$ internationally, prior to its American release.\nKirk Wise directed the English-language version of \"Spirited Away\"\u200a; Pixar's John Lasseter wanted Miyazaki to travel to the United States to work on the translated version, but Miyazaki trusted Lasseter to handle it. \"Spirited Away\"'s hopping lamp character is seen as an homage to Lasseter's character Luxo Jr. The film's successful American release through Buena Vista cemented Studio Ghibli's reputation in Western regions and established Miyazaki's popularity in North America; it was the first animated film to win the Golden Bear at the Berlin International Film Festival (tied with \"Bloody Sunday\") and the first Japanese film to win the Best Animated Feature at the Academy Awards, alongside several other accolades. It has been frequently ranked among the greatest films of the 21st century. Upon completing the film, like with \"Princess Mononoke\", Miyazaki declared it his last. He traveled to France in December 2001 and the United States in September 2002 to promote the film. Following the death of Tokuma in September 2000, Miyazaki served as the head of his funeral committee. Miyazaki wrote and directed more short films for the Ghibli Museum: \"Koro's Big Day Out\", which screened from January 2002, and \"Mei and the Kittenbus\", which screened from October. One of the short films, \"Imaginary Flying Machines\", was later screened as in-flight entertainment by Japan Airlines alongside \"Porco Rosso\".\n\"Howl's Moving Castle\" and \"Ponyo\" (2001\u20132008).\nStudio Ghibli announced the production of \"Howl's Moving Castle\" in September 2001, based on the novel by Diana Wynne Jones, which Miyazaki had read in 1999. Toei Animation's Mamoru Hosoda was originally selected to direct the film, but disagreements between Hosoda and Studio Ghibli executives led to the project's abandonment in 2002. After six months, Studio Ghibli resurrected the project. Miyazaki was inspired to direct the film, struck by the image of a castle moving around the countryside, and he took creative liberties in its depiction. Some computer animation was used to animate the castle's movements, though Miyazaki dictated it consist of no more than 10 percent of the film. Miyazaki traveled to Colmar and Riquewihr in Alsace, France, to study the architecture and the surroundings for the film's setting, while additional inspiration came from the concepts of future technology in Albert Robida's work. The war featured in the film was thematically influenced by the 2003 invasion and subsequent war in Iraq, the events of which enraged Miyazaki.\n\"Howl's Moving Castle\" was released on November 20, 2004, and received widespread critical acclaim. The film received the Golden Osella for Technical Excellence at the 61st Venice International Film Festival, and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature. In Japan, the film sold more than 1.1\u00a0million tickets within two days and grossed a record US$ in its first week. It became Japan's third-highest-grossing film, and remains among the top rankings with a worldwide gross of over \u00a519.3 billion. Miyazaki received the honorary Golden Lion for Lifetime Achievement award at the 62nd Venice International Film Festival in 2005. He visited the United States in June 2005 to promote the film.\nIn March 2005, Studio Ghibli split from Tokuma Shoten, and Miyazaki became corporate director. After \"Howl's Moving Castle\", Miyazaki created some short films for the Ghibli Museum, for which he returned solely to traditional animation techniques; all three began screening in January 2006. Studio Ghibli obtained the rights to produce an adaptation of Ursula K. Le Guin's \"Earthsea\" novels in 2003; Miyazaki had contacted her in the 1980s expressing interest but she declined, unaware of his work. Upon watching \"My Neighbor Totoro\" several years later, she expressed approval to the concept and met with Suzuki in August 2005, who wanted Miyazaki's son Goro to direct the film, as Miyazaki had wished to retire. Disappointed that Miyazaki was not directing but under the impression he would supervise his son's work, Le Guin approved of the film's production. Miyazaki later publicly opposed and criticized Goro's appointment as director. The film's designs were partly inspired by Miyazaki's manga \"The Journey of Shuna\". During a screening of the film, Miyazaki commented, \"You shouldn't make a picture based on your emotions\". He later wrote a message for his son: \"It was made honestly, so it was good\".\nIn February 2006, Miyazaki traveled to the United Kingdom to research \"A Trip to Tynemouth\" (based on Robert Westall's \"Blackham's Wimpy\"), for which he designed the cover, created a short manga, and worked as editor; it was released in October. Miyazaki's next film, \"Ponyo\", began production in May 2006. It was initially inspired by \"The Little Mermaid\" by Hans Christian Andersen, though began to take its own form as production continued. Miyazaki aimed for the film to celebrate the innocence and cheerfulness of a child's universe. He was intimately involved with the artwork, preferring to draw the sea and waves himself, as he enjoyed experimenting. Two short films\u2014\"Looking for a Home\" and \"Water Spider Monmon\"\u2014were made for the Ghibli Museum shortly before \"Ponyo\" entered production as animation experiments for sea life.\n\"Ponyo\" features 170,000 frames\u2014a record for Miyazaki. Its seaside village was inspired by Tomonoura, a town in Setonaikai National Park, where Miyazaki stayed in 2004. The main character, S\u014dsuke, is based on Gor\u014d. Following its release on July 19, 2008, \"Ponyo\" was critically acclaimed, receiving Animation of the Year at the 32nd Japan Academy Film Prize. The film was also a commercial success, earning \u00a510 billion (US$) in its first month and \u00a515.5 billion by the end of 2008, placing it among the highest-grossing films in Japan; its box office earnings outpaced its \u00a53.4 billion budget fivefold. In April 2008, Miyazaki founded Home of the Three Bears, a preschool for the children of Studio Ghibli employees for which he had worked on early architectural plans.\n\"The Wind Rises\" and screenplays (2009\u20132013).\nIn early 2009, Miyazaki began writing a manga called , telling the story of Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighter designer Jiro Horikoshi. The manga was first published in two issues of the Model Graphix magazine, published on February 25 and March 25, 2009. For the Ghibli Museum, Miyazaki wrote the short film \"A Sumo Wrestler's Tail\", directed by Akihiko Yamashita, and wrote and directed \"Mr. Dough and the Egg Princess\"; both started screening in 2010. From July 2008, Miyazaki planned and produced the film \"Arrietty\" (2010), for which he co-wrote the screenplay with , based on the 1952 novel \"The Borrowers\"; it was the directorial debut of Hiromasa Yonebayashi, who had started as an inbetween artist on \"Princess Mononoke\". Miyazaki and Niwa wrote the screenplay for \"From Up on Poppy Hill\" (2011), based the 1979\u20131980 manga \"Coquelicot-zaka kara\"; the film, directed by Goro Miyazaki, was the highest-grossing Japanese film in the country in 2011 and won Animation of the Year at the Japan Academy Awards.\nMiyazaki wanted his next film to be a sequel to \"Ponyo\", but Suzuki convinced him to instead adapt to film. In November 2012, Studio Ghibli announced the production of \"The Wind Rises\", based on , to be released as a double bill alongside Takahata's \"The Tale of the Princess Kaguya\"; the latter was ultimately delayed. Miyazaki was inspired to create \"The Wind Rises\" after reading a quote from Horikoshi: \"All I wanted to do was to make something beautiful\". Several scenes in \"The Wind Rises\" were inspired by Tatsuo Hori's novel , in which Hori wrote about his life experiences with his fianc\u00e9e before she died from tuberculosis. The female lead character's name, Naoko Satomi, was borrowed from Hori's novel , while the name of a German man, Hans Castorp, taken from Thomas Mann's \"The Magic Mountain\". Naoko's struggles with tuberculosis echo the illness of Miyazaki's mother, and Horikoshi's story of growing from a young boy dreaming of airplanes to an inspirational artist is reflective of Miyazaki's own life.\n\"The Wind Rises\" reflects Miyazaki's pacifist stance, continuing the themes of his earlier works, despite stating that condemning war was not the intention of the film; he felt that, despite his occupation, Horikoshi was not militant. Miyazaki was moved by the film, the first of his own works to make him cry. As Horikoshi, he cast Hideaki Anno, who had worked on \"Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind\" and is known for creating \"Neon Genesis Evangelion\". The film premiered on July 20, 2013, It received critical acclaim for its animation, narrative, and characters, though some viewers were critical of the film's focus on Horikoshi due to the impacts of his inventions and others were disappointed by its lack of fantastical elements. It was named Animation of the Year at the 37th Japan Academy Film Prize and was nominated for Best Animated Feature at the 86th Academy Awards. It was commercially successful, grossing \u00a511.6 billion (US$) at the Japanese box office, becoming the highest-grossing film in Japan in 2013. The film's production was documented in Mami Sunada's \"The Kingdom of Dreams and Madness\".\nRetirement and \"The Boy and the Heron\" (2013\u2013present).\nIn September 2013, Miyazaki announced he was retiring from the production of feature films due to his age, but wished to continue working on the displays at the Ghibli Museum. Miyazaki was awarded the Academy Honorary Award at the Governors Awards in November 2014. He developed \"Boro the Caterpillar\", an animated short film which was first discussed during pre-production for \"Princess Mononoke\". It was screened exclusively at the Ghibli Museum in July 2017. Around this time, Miyazaki was working on a manga titled \"Teppo Samurai\". In February 2019, a four-part documentary was broadcast on the NHK network titled \"10 Years with Hayao Miyazaki\", documenting production of his films in his private studio. In 2019, Miyazaki approved a musical adaptation of \"Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind\", as it was performed by a kabuki troupe.\nIn August 2016, Miyazaki proposed a new feature-length film, \"Kimi-tachi wa D\u014d Ikiru ka\" (titled \"The Boy and the Heron\" in English), on which he began animation work without receiving official approval. The film opened in Japanese theaters on July 14, 2023. It was preceded by a minimal marketing campaign, forgoing trailers, commercials, and advertisements, a response from Suzuki to his perceived oversaturation of marketing materials in mainstream films. It was commercially successful, grossing US$ worldwide, making it one of the highest-grossing anime films in several countries and one of the highest-grossing Japanese films ever. The film's production was documented in Kaku Arakawa's \"Hayao Miyazaki and the Heron\".\n\"The Boy and the Heron\" won Miyazaki his second Academy Award for Best Animated Feature at the 96th Academy Awards, becoming the oldest director to do so and the first two-time Japanese winner in the category (and second overall); Miyazaki did not attend the show due to his advanced age. Despite claims that \"The Boy and the Heron\" would be Miyazaki's final film, Studio Ghibli vice president Junichi Nishioka said in September 2023 that Miyazaki continued to attend the office daily to plan his next film. Suzuki said he could no longer convince Miyazaki to retire. Studio Ghibli became a subsidiary of Nippon Television Holdings in October 2023, with Miyazaki as its honorary chairman.\nViews.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"If you don't spend time watching real people, you can't do this, because you've never seen it. Some people spend their lives interested only in themselves. Almost all Japanese animation is produced with hardly any basis taken from observing real people... It's produced by humans who can't stand looking at other humans. And that's why the industry is full of \"otaku\"\u200a!\" \nHayao Miyazaki, January 2014\nMiyazaki has often criticized the state of the animation industry, stating that some animators lack a foundational understanding of their subjects and do not prioritize realism. He is particularly critical of Japanese animation, saying that anime is \"produced by humans who can't stand looking at other humans ... that's why the industry is full of \"otaku\"\u200a!\" He has frequently criticized \"otaku\", including \"fanatics\" of guns and fighter aircraft, declaring it a \"fetish\" and refusing to identify himself as such. He bemoaned the state of Disney animated films in 1988, saying \"they show nothing but contempt for the audience\".\nMiyazaki has criticized the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in animation. When shown an animated zombie generated by artificial intelligence in 2016, Miyazaki was reminded of his friend with a disability and felt the animator \"has no idea what pain is whatsoever\"; he was \"utterly disgusted\" by the work, which he called \"an insult to life itself\", with no plans to use artificial intelligence at Studio Ghibli. Miyazaki's comments resurfaced in March 2025 after the generative artificial intelligence model ChatGPT was updated to produce works strongly resembling artists' styles, including Studio Ghibli's. Many criticized the update, citing Miyazaki's comments; actress and director Zelda Williams wrote \"fuck AI\", noting Miyazaki would \"absolutely despise the technological piracy and negative effects on our environment\".\nMiyazaki considers himself \"traditionally ... a leftist in terms of emotional affinity\", emphasizing his commitment to his ideals despite changing political and economic landscapes. He abandoned his Marxist values while creating \"Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind\" as he felt Nausica\u00e4's status in an elite class did not affect her class consciousness, recognizing that \"No matter what class people are born into, idiots are still idiots and good people are still good\". After the release of \"The Wind Rises\" in 2013, Miyazaki recognized leftist values in his movies, citing his influence by communism as defined by Karl Marx, but criticized real experiments of socialism in countries like the Soviet Union.\nMiyazaki felt events like Japan's ownership of the Liaodong Peninsula and its invasion of Manchuria led him to lack an affinity for his homeland, though in his thirties he examined that the land itself had \"tremendous power\". In 2013, he criticized Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's proposed Constitutional amendment that would allow Abe to revise the clause outlawing war as a means to settle international disputes. Miyazaki felt Abe wished to \"leave his name in history as a great man who revised the Constitution and its interpretation\", describing it as \"despicable\" and stating \"People who don't think enough shouldn't meddle with the constitution\". In 2015, Miyazaki disapproved Abe's denial of Japan's military aggression, stating Japan \"should clearly say that [they] inflicted enormous damage on China and express deep remorse over it\". He felt the government should give a \"proper apology\" to Korean comfort women who were forced to service the Japanese army during World War II and suggested the Senkaku Islands be \"split in half\" or controlled by both China and Japan. In 2024, Miyazaki acknowledged the \"terrible things\" Japan committed against the Philippines during the war.\nWhen \"Spirited Away\" was nominated at the 75th Academy Awards in 2003, Miyazaki refused to attend in protest of the United States's involvement in the Iraq War, and later said he \"didn't want to visit a country that was bombing Iraq\". He did not publicly express this opinion at the request of his producer until 2009 when he lifted his boycott and attended San Diego Comic-Con as a favor to his friend John Lasseter. Miyazaki also expressed his opinion about the terrorist attack at the offices of the French satirical magazine \"Charlie Hebdo\", criticizing the magazine's decision to publish the content cited as the catalyst for the incident; he felt caricatures should be made of politicians, not cultures. In November 2016, Miyazaki believed \"many of the people who voted for Brexit and Trump\" were affected by the increase in unemployment due to companies \"building cars in Mexico because of low wages and [selling] them in the US\". He did not think Donald Trump would be elected president, calling it \"a terrible thing\", but said Trump's political opponent Hillary Clinton was \"terrible as well\".\nThemes.\nMiyazaki's works are characterized by the recurrence of themes such as feminism, environmentalism, pacifism, love, and family. His narratives are also notable for not pitting a hero against an unsympathetic antagonist; Miyazaki felt \"Spirited Away\"'s Chihiro \"manages not because she has destroyed the 'evil', but because she has acquired the ability to survive\".\nMiyazaki's films often emphasize environmentalism and the Earth's fragility. Margaret Talbot stated Miyazaki dislikes modern technology, and believes much of modern culture is \"thin and shallow and fake\"; he anticipates a time with \"no more high-rises\". Miyazaki felt frustrated growing up in the Sh\u014dwa period from 1955 to 1965 because \"nature\u2014the mountains and rivers\u2014was being destroyed in the name of economic progress\". Peter Schellhase of \"The Imaginative Conservative\" identified that several antagonists of Miyazaki's films \"attempt to dominate nature in pursuit of political domination, and are ultimately destructive to both nature and human civilization\". Miyazaki is critical of exploitation under both communism and capitalism, as well as globalization and its effects on modern life, believing \"a company is common property of the people that work there\". Ram Prakash Dwivedi identified values of Mahatma Gandhi in the films of Miyazaki.\nSeveral of Miyazaki's films feature anti-war themes. Daisuke Akimoto of \"Animation Studies\" categorized \"Porco Rosso\" as \"anti-war propaganda\" and felt the protagonist, Porco, transforms into a pig partly due to his extreme distaste of militarism. Akimoto also argues that \"The Wind Rises\" reflects Miyazaki's \"antiwar pacifism\", despite Miyazaki stating that the film does not attempt to \"denounce\" war. Schellhase also identifies \"Princess Mononoke\" as a pacifist film due to the protagonist, Ashitaka; instead of joining the campaign of revenge against humankind, as his ethnic history would lead him to do, Ashitaka strives for peace. David Loy and Linda Goodhew argue both \"Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind\" and \"Princess Mononoke\" do not depict traditional evil, but the Buddhist roots of evil: greed, ill will, and delusion; according to Buddhism, the roots of evil must transform into \"generosity, loving-kindness and wisdom\" in order to overcome suffering, and both Nausica\u00e4 and Ashitaka accomplish this. When characters in Miyazaki's films are forced to engage in violence, it is shown as being a difficult task; in \"Howl's Moving Castle\", Howl is forced to fight an inescapable battle in defense of those he loves, and it almost destroys him, though he is ultimately saved by Sophie's love and bravery.\nSuzuki described Miyazaki as a feminist in reference to his attitude to female workers. Miyazaki has described his female characters as \"brave, self-sufficient girls that don't think twice about fighting for what they believe in with all their heart\", stating they may \"need a friend, or a supporter, but never a saviour\" and \"any woman is just as capable of being a hero as any man\". \"Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind\" was lauded for its positive portrayal of women, particularly protagonist Nausica\u00e4. Schellhase noted the female characters in Miyazaki's films are not objectified or sexualized, and possess complex and individual characteristics absent from Hollywood productions. Schellhase also identified a \"coming of age\" element for the heroines in Miyazaki's films, as they each discover \"individual personality and strengths\". Gabrielle Bellot of \"The Atlantic\" wrote that, in his films, Miyazaki \"shows a keen understanding of the complexities of what it might mean to be a woman\". In particular, Bellot cites \"Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind\", praising the film's challenging of gender expectations, and the strong and independent nature of Nausica\u00e4. Bellot also noted \"Princess Mononoke\"'s San represents the \"conflict between selfhood and expression\".\nMiyazaki is concerned with the sense of wonder in young people, seeking to maintain themes of love and family in his films. Michael Toscano of \"Curator\" found Miyazaki \"fears Japanese children are dimmed by a culture of overconsumption, overprotection, utilitarian education, careerism, techno-industrialism, and a secularism that is swallowing Japan's native animism\". Schellhase wrote that several of Miyazaki's works feature themes of love and romance, but felt emphasis is placed on \"the way lonely and vulnerable individuals are integrated into relationships of mutual reliance and responsibility, which generally benefit everyone around them\". He also found many of the protagonists in Miyazaki's films present an idealized image of families, whereas others are dysfunctional.\nCreation process and influences.\nMiyazaki forgoes traditional screenplays in his productions, instead developing the narrative as he designs the storyboards, stating \"We never know where the story will go but we just keep working on the film as it develops\". Miyazaki has employed traditional animation methods in all of his films, drawing each frame by hand; computer-generated imagery has been employed in several of his later films, beginning with \"Princess Mononoke\", to \"enrich the visual look\", though he ensures each film can \"retain the right ratio between working by hand and computer ... and still be able to call my films 2D\". He oversees every frame of his films. For character designs, Miyazaki draws original drafts used by animation directors to create reference sheets, which Miyazaki then corrects in his style. He prioritizes logical plots even for child-friendly contents.\nMiyazaki has cited several Japanese artists as his influences, including Sanpei Shirato, Osamu Tezuka, Soji Yamakawa, and Isao Takahata, and Western artists and animators like Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Back, Jean Giraud, Paul Grimault, Yuri Norstein, and animation studio Aardman Animations (specifically the works of Nick Park). Several authors have also influenced his works, including Lewis Carroll, Roald Dahl, Ursula K. Le Guin, Philippa Pearce, Rosemary Sutcliff, and Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry, Specific works that have influenced Miyazaki include \"Animal Farm\" (1945), \"The Snow Queen\" (1957), and \"The King and the Mockingbird\" (1980); \"The Snow Queen\" is said to be the true catalyst for Miyazaki's filmography, influencing his training and work. When animating young children, Miyazaki often takes inspiration from his friends' children and memories of his own childhood.\nPersonal life.\nMiyazaki's wife, , was born in 1938 and hired as an inbetween artist at Toei Animation in 1958, working on \"The White Snake Enchantress\" (1958) and \"Alakazam the Great\" (1960). She and Miyazaki met at Toei in 1964, and they married in October 1965. At Toei, they worked together on \"The Great Adventure of Horus, Prince of the Sun\" and \"The Wonderful World of Puss 'n Boots\". They have two sons: Goro, born in January 1967, and Keisuke, born in April 1969. Becoming a father changed Miyazaki and he tried to produce work to please his children.\nMiyazaki initially fulfilled a promise to his wife that they would both continue to work after Goro's birth, dropping him off at preschool for the day; however, upon seeing Goro's exhaustion walking home one day, Miyazaki decided they could not continue, and his wife quit in 1972 to stay at home and raise their children. She was reluctant to do so but considered it necessary to allow Miyazaki to focus on his work. Miyazaki's dedication to his work harmed his relationship with his children as he was often absent. Goro watched his father's works to \"understand\" him since the two rarely talked. Miyazaki said he \"tried to be a good father, but in the end [he] wasn't a very good parent\", and later said he felt he owed \"that little boy an apology\". In 2006, Goro said his father \"gets zero marks as a father, but full marks as a director of animated films\".\nGoro worked at a landscape design firm before beginning to work at the Ghibli Museum; he designed the garden on its rooftop and eventually became its curator. Keisuke studied forestry at Shinshu University and works as a wood artist; he designed a woodcut print that appears in \"Whisper of the Heart\". Miyazaki's niece, Mei Okuyama, who was the inspiration behind the character Mei in \"My Neighbor Totoro\", is married to animation artist Daisuke Tsutsumi.\nLegacy.\nMiyazaki was described as the \"godfather of animation in Japan\" by BBC's Tessa Wong in 2016, citing his craftsmanship and humanity, the themes of his films, and his inspiration to younger artists. Courtney Lanning of \"Arkansas Democrat-Gazette\" named him one of the world's greatest animators, comparing him to Osamu Tezuka and Walt Disney; Miyazaki has been called \"the Disney of Japan\", though Helen McCarthy considered comparison to Akira Kurosawa more appropriate due to the combination of grandeur and sensitivity in his work, dubbing him \"the Kurosawa of animation\".\nSwapnil Dhruv Bose of \"Far Out Magazine\" wrote that Miyazaki's work \"has shaped not only the future of animation but also filmmaking in general\", and that it helped \"generation after generation of young viewers to observe the magic that exists in the mundane\". Richard James Havis of \"South China Morning Post\" called him a \"genius ... who sets exacting standards for himself, his peers and studio staff\". \"Paste\"'s Toussaint Egan described Miyazaki as \"one of anime's great auteurs\", whose \"stories of such singular thematic vision and unmistakable aesthetic\" captured viewers otherwise unfamiliar with anime. Miyazaki became the subject of an exhibit at the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures in Los Angeles in 2021, featuring over 400 objects from his films.\nMiyazaki has frequently been cited as an inspiration to numerous animators, directors and writers around the world, including Wes Anderson, Tony Bancroft, James Cameron, Barry Cook, Dean DeBlois, Guillermo del Toro, Pete Docter, Mamoru Hosoda, Bong Joon Ho, Travis Knight, John Lasseter, Nick Park, Henry Selick, Makoto Shinkai, Steven Spielberg, and Gints Zilbalodis. Glen Keane said Miyazaki is a \"huge influence\" on Walt Disney Animation Studios and has been \"part of our heritage\" ever since \"The Rescuers Down Under\" (1990). The Disney Renaissance era was also prompted by competition with the development of Miyazaki's films. Artists from Pixar and Aardman Studios signed a tribute stating, \"You're our inspiration, Miyazaki-san!\" He has also been cited as inspiration for video game designers including Shigeru Miyamoto on \"The Legend of Zelda\" and Hironobu Sakaguchi on \"Final Fantasy\", as well as the television series \"\", and the video game \"Ori and the Blind Forest\" (2015).\nSeveral books have been written about Miyazaki by scholars such as Raz Greenberg, Helen McCarthy, and Susan J. Napier; according to Jeff Lenburg, more papers have been written about Miyazaki than any other Japanese artist. Studio Ghibli has searched for some time for Miyazaki and Suzuki's successor to lead the studio; Kond\u014d, the director of \"Whisper of the Heart\", was initially considered, but died from a sudden heart attack in 1998. Some candidates were considered by 2023\u2014including Miyazaki's son Goro, who declined\u2014but the studio was not able to find a successor.\nAwards and nominations.\nMiyazaki won the \u014cfuji Nobur\u014d Award at the Mainichi Film Awards for \"The Castle of Cagliostro\" (1979), \"Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind\" (1984), \"Laputa: Castle in the Sky\" (1986), \"My Neighbor Totoro\" (1988), and \"The Boy and the Heron\" (2023), and the Mainichi Film Award for Best Animation Film for \"Kiki's Delivery Service\" (1989), \"Porco Rosso\" (1992), \"Princess Mononoke\" (1997), \"Spirited Away\" (2001), and \"Whale Hunt\" (2001). \"Spirited Away\" and \"The Boy and the Heron\" were awarded the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature, while \"Howl's Moving Castle\" (2004) and \"The Wind Rises\" (2013) received nominations. He was named a Person of Cultural Merit by the Japanese government in November 2012, for outstanding cultural contributions. \"Time\" named him one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2005 and 2024, and Gold House honored him on its Most Impactful Asians A100 list in 2024. He was an honoree of the Ramon Magsaysay Award in 2024 for his usage of art to \"illuminate the human condition\". Miyazaki's other accolades include several Annie Awards, Japan Academy Film Prizes, Kinema Junpo Awards, and Tokyo Anime Awards.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\nPrint sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nJournal articles.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWeb sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nVideo sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "20318", "revid": "8830735", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20318", "title": "Macrobiotic diet", "text": "Fad diet fixed on ideas about types of food drawn from Zen Buddhism\nA macrobiotic diet (or macrobiotics) is an unconventional restrictive diet based on ideas about types of food drawn from Zen Buddhism. The diet tries to balance the supposed yin and yang elements of food and cookware. Major principles of macrobiotic diets are to reduce animal products, eat locally grown foods that are in season, and consume meals in moderation.\nThere is no high-quality clinical evidence that a macrobiotic diet is helpful for people with cancer or other diseases, and it may be harmful. Neither the American Cancer Society nor Cancer Research UK recommends adopting the diet. Deaths have been reported from malnutrition on strict macrobiotic diets.\nConceptual basis.\nThe macrobiotic diet is associated with Zen Buddhism and is based on the idea of balancing yin and yang. The diet proposes ten plans which are followed to reach a supposedly ideal yin:yang ratio of 5:1. The diet was popularized by George Ohsawa in the 1930s and subsequently elaborated on by his disciple Michio Kushi. Medical historian Barbara Clow writes that, in common with many other types of quackery, macrobiotics takes a view of illness and of therapy which conflicts with mainstream medicine.\nMacrobiotics emphasizes locally grown whole grain cereals, pulses (legumes), vegetables, edible seaweed, fermented soy products, and fruit combined into meals according to the ancient Chinese principle of balance known as yin and yang. Some macrobiotic proponents stress that yin and yang are relative qualities that can only be determined in a comparison. All food is considered to have both properties, with one dominating. Foods with yang qualities are considered compact, dense, heavy, and hot, whereas those with yin qualities are considered expansive, light, cold, and diffuse. However, these terms are relative; \"yangness\" or \"yinness\" is only discussed in relation to other foods.\nBrown rice and other whole grains such as barley, millet, oats, quinoa, spelt, rye, and teff are considered by macrobiotics to be the foods in which yin and yang are closest to being in balance. Therefore, lists of macrobiotic foods that determine a food as yin or yang generally compare them to whole grains.\nNightshade vegetables, including tomatoes, peppers, potatoes, and eggplant; also, spinach, beets, and avocados, are not recommended or are used sparingly in macrobiotic cooking, as they are considered extremely yin. Some macrobiotic practitioners also discourage the use of nightshades because of the alkaloid solanine which is thought to affect calcium balance. Some proponents of a macrobiotic diet believe that nightshade vegetables can cause inflammation and osteoporosis.\nHistory.\nMacrobiotics was founded by George Ohsawa and popularized in the United States by his disciple Michio Kushi. In the 1960s, the earliest and most strict variant of the diet was termed the \"Zen macrobiotic diet\" which claimed to cure cancer, epilepsy, gonorrhea, leprosy, syphilis and many other diseases. Ohsawa wrote that dandruff is \"the first step toward mental disease\". Ohsawa wrote about the diet in his 1965 book \"Zen Macrobiotics\". The Zen macrobiotic diet involved 10 restrictive stages with the highest stage eliminating all foods in the diet apart from whole grains. Fluid intake was discouraged at all stages.\nIn 1965, a young follower of the macrobiotic diet died from malnutrition. George Ohsawa was sued for malpractice and the Ohsawa Foundation in New York was closed after a raid by the Food and Drug Administration. In 1966, a Grand Jury who reviewed several cases of death from malnutrition among macrobiotic proponents concluded that the diet \"constitutes a public health hazard\". In 1967, the first case report of scurvy on the macrobiotic diet was reported. In 1971, the American Medical Association's Council on Foods and Nutrition commented that followers of the diet were in \"great danger\" of malnutrition. Their report concluded that \"when a diet has been shown to cause irreversible damage to health and ultimately lead to death, it should be roundly condemned as a threat to human health\".\nAfter the Ohsawa Foundation in New York was closed, Michio Kushi shifted operations to Boston, where he opened two macrobiotic restaurants. In the 1970s, Kushi established the \"East West Journal\", the East West Foundation and the Kushi Institute. In 1981, the Kushi Foundation was formed as a parent organization for the institute and magazine. The Kushi Institute was located on a large site in Becket, Massachusetts where it hosted macrobiotic conferences, lectures and seminars. Kushi combined macrobiotics with numerous paranormal and pseudoscientific ideas including auras, astrology, chakras, oriental physiognomy, palmistry and extra-terrestrial encounters. The Kushi Institute closed in 2017.\nPractices.\nFood.\nThe macrobiotic diet is considered an unconventional or fad diet. Some general guidelines for the macrobiotic diet are the following.\nSmall amounts of white fish and fruit may be eaten if desired. Nuts and seeds are not often consumed but are permitted as occasional snacks if they are lightly roasted. Beverages include herbal teas, cereal-grain coffee and roasted-barley tea.\nKitchenware.\nCooking utensils should be made from certain materials such as wood or glass, while some materials including plastic, copper, and non-stick coatings are to be avoided. Electric ovens should not be used.\nCancer.\nThe macrobiotic diet has been advertised as an alternative cancer treatment but is ineffective to treat any type of cancer. Macrobiotics author Michio Kushi argued that conventional cancer treatments are \"violent and artificial\" and the macrobiotic diet should not be combined with conventional treatment. There is no clinical evidence to support the cancer claims of macrobiotic proponents. The American Cancer Society who reviewed 11 scientific data bases found no peer-reviewed evidence that the macrobiotic diet is effective for treating any type of cancer. The Office of Technology Assessment, examining both published and unpublished macrobiotic literature, failed to verify any claims of cancer cure.\nThe American Cancer Society recommends \"low-fat, high-fiber diets that consist mainly of plant products\"; however, they urge people with cancer not to rely on a dietary program as an exclusive or primary means of treatment. Cancer Research UK states, \"some people think living a macrobiotic lifestyle may help them to fight their cancer and lead to a cure. But there is no scientific evidence to prove this.\"\nSafety.\nRegulation.\nMacrobiotic practitioners are not regulated, and need not have any qualification or training in the United Kingdom.\nComplications.\nOne of the earlier versions of the macrobiotic diet that involved eating only brown rice and water has been linked to severe nutritional deficiencies and even death. Strict macrobiotic diets that include no animal products may result in nutritional deficiencies unless they are carefully planned. The danger may be worse for people with cancer, who may have to contend with unwanted weight loss and often have increased nutritional and caloric requirements. Relying on this type of treatment alone and avoiding or delaying conventional medical care for cancer may have serious health consequences.\nCases of vitamin B12 and iron-deficiency anemias have been reported as a result of the diet.\nChildren.\nChildren may also be particularly prone to nutritional deficiencies resulting from a macrobiotic diet. A macrobiotic diet does not contain the nutrients needed by growing children.\nPregnancy.\nMacrobiotic diets have not been tested in women who are pregnant or breast-feeding, and the most extreme versions may not include enough of certain nutrients for normal fetal growth.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "20319", "revid": "50575032", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20319", "title": "Motorola", "text": "American telecommunications company (1928\u20132011)\nMotorola, Inc. (), was an American multinational telecommunications company based in Schaumburg, Illinois. It was founded by brothers Paul and Joseph Galvin in 1928 and had been named Motorola since 1947. Many of Motorola's products had been radio-related communication equipment such as two-way radios, consumer walkie-talkies, cellular infrastructure, mobile phones, satellite communicators, pagers, as well as cable modems and semiconductors. After having lost $4.3 billion from 2007 to 2009, Motorola was split into two independent public companies: Motorola Solutions (its legal successor) and Motorola Mobility (spun off), on January 4, 2011.\nMotorola designed and sold wireless network equipment such as cellular transmission base stations and signal amplifiers. Its business and government customers consisted mainly of wireless voice and broadband systems (used to build private networks), and public safety communications systems like Astro and Dimetra. Motorola's home and broadcast network products included set-top boxes, digital video recorders, and network equipment used to enable video broadcasting, computer telephony, and high-definition television. These businesses, except for set-top boxes and cable modems, became part of Motorola Solutions after the split of Motorola in 2011.\nMotorola's wireless telephone handset division was a pioneer in cellular telephones. Also known as the Personal Communication Service (PCS) prior to 2004, it pioneered the \"mobile phone\" with the first truly mobile \"brick phone\" DynaTAC, \"flip phone\" with the MicroTAC as well as the \"clam phone\" with the StarTAC in the mid-1990s. It had staged a resurgence by the mid-2000s with the RAZR, but lost market share in the second half of that decade, as the company's one-hit wonders were not enough to reinstate Motorola as a leader. Later it focused on smartphones using Google's Android mobile operating system, the first released product being Motorola Droid in 2009. The handset division was later spun off into Motorola Mobility.\nHistory.\nMotorola was founded in Chicago, Illinois, as Galvin Manufacturing Corporation (at 847 West Harrison Street) in 1928.\nPaul Galvin wanted a brand name for Galvin Manufacturing Corporation's new car radio, and created the name \"Motorola\" by linking \"motor\" (from motor car) with \"ola\" (from Victrola), which was also a popular ending for many companies at the time, e.g. Moviola, Crayola. The company sold its first Motorola branded radio on June 23, 1930, to Herbert C. Wall of Fort Wayne, Indiana, for $30. The Motorola brand name became so well known that Galvin Manufacturing Corporation later changed its name to Motorola, Inc., in 1947.\nGalvin Manufacturing Corporation began selling Motorola car-radio receivers to police departments and municipalities in November 1930. The company's first public safety customers (all in the U.S. state of Illinois) included the Village of River Forest, Village of Bellwood Police Department, City of Evanston Police, Illinois State Highway Police, and Cook County (Chicago area) Police.\nMany of Motorola's products have been radio-related, starting with a battery eliminator for battery powered radios (during the burgeoning electrification of rural homes), through the first handheld walkie-talkie in the world in 1940, defense electronics, cellular infrastructure equipment, and mobile phone manufacturing. In the same year, the company built its research and development program with Dan Noble, a pioneer in FM radio and semiconductor technologies, who joined the company as director of research. The company produced the hand-held AM SCR-536 radio during World War II, which was vital to Allied communication. Motorola ranked 94th among United States corporations in the value of World War II military production contracts.\nMotorola went public in 1943, and became Motorola, Inc. in 1947. At that time Motorola's main business was producing and selling televisions and radios.\nPost World War II.\nThe last plant was listed in Quincy, Illinois at 1400 North 30th Street where 1,200 employees made radio assemblies for both homes and automobiles.\nIn 1969, Neil Armstrong spoke the famous words \"That's one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind\" from the Moon on a Motorola transceiver.\nIn 1973, Motorola demonstrated the first hand-held portable telephone.\nIn 1974, Motorola introduced its first microprocessor, the 8-bit MC6800, used in automotive, computing and video game applications. The 6800 was the basis for the more popular MOS Technology 6502 which was made by former Motorola employees. That same year, Motorola sold its television business to the Japan-based Matsushita \u2013 the parent company of Panasonic.\nIn 1980, Motorola's next generation 32-bit microprocessor, the MC68000, led the wave of technologies that spurred the computing revolution in 1984, powering devices from companies such as Apple, Commodore, Atari, Sun, and Hewlett-Packard.\nIn September 1983, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) approved the DynaTAC 8000X telephone, the world's first commercial cellular device. By 1998, cell phones accounted for two thirds of Motorola's gross revenue.\nIn 1986 Motorola acquired Storno resulting in a whole new range of innovative communication products for the new owner, including the NMT, an automatic cellular phone system, and made Motorola a more central player in the early stages of the GSM standardization process in 1987. With this addition Motorola strengthened its position in Europe significantly. As Motorola's European development arm, Storno developed a GSM terminal in 1992.\nOn January 29, 1988, Motorola sold its Arcade, New York, facility and automotive alternators, electromechanical speedometers and tachometers products to Prestolite Electric.\nIn 1996, Motorola released the Motorola StarMax, which was a Macintosh clone that was licensed by Apple and it came with System 7. However, with the return of Steve Jobs to Apple in 1997, Apple released Mac OS 8. Because the clone makers' licenses were valid only for Apple's System 7 operating system, Apple's release of Mac OS 8 left the clone manufacturers unable to ship a current Mac OS version without negotiation with Apple. A heated telephone conversation between Jobs and then Motorola CEO Christopher Galvin resulted in the termination of Motorola's clone contract, the discontinuation of the Motorola StarMax, and the long-favored Apple being demoted to \"just another customer\" mainly for PowerPC CPUs. Apple (and Jobs) did not want Motorola to limit the PowerPC CPU supply so as retaliation, Apple and IBM expelled Motorola from the AIM alliance and forced Motorola to stop producing any PowerPC CPUs, leaving IBM to make all future PowerPC CPUs. However, Motorola was later reinstated into the alliance in 1998.\nNeglect of the emerging digital cellular standards led to Motorola's end as the dominant leader in mobile phone handsets in the second half of the 1990s. In 1996 it fell behind Ericsson in the growing market for digital phones in the U.S. In 1998, Motorola was overtaken by Nokia as the world's biggest seller of mobile phone handsets. The company was also struggling in microchips (which together with cell phones accounted for the majority of Motorola's revenue), cellular infrastructure equipment, and the Iridium satellite project that it had invested in. Motorola sold some businesses during this period, including in 1999 a portion of its semiconductor business\u2014the Semiconductor Components Group (SCG)-- and formed onsemi (then ON Semiconductor), whose headquarters were located in Phoenix, Arizona.\nAfter 2000.\nBy 2000, Motorola had shown signs of recovery from a long sustained period of decline. It was still, however, losing money on every handset sold, whereas Nokia was making large profits on each instead.\nIn June 2000, Motorola and Cisco supplied the world's first commercial GPRS cellular network to BT Cellnet in the United Kingdom. Motorola also developed the world's first GPRS cell phone.\nIn August 2000, Motorola acquired Printrak International Inc. for $160 million. In doing so, Motorola not only acquired computer aided dispatch and related software, but also acquired Automated fingerprint identification system software. With recent acquisitions from that year, Motorola reached its peak employment of 150,000 employees worldwide. Two years later, employment would be at 93,000 due to layoffs and spinoffs.\nThe company's handset division began using the \"Hello Moto\" tagline in advertizing in 2002 which later also became a signature ringtone.\nIn June 2005, Motorola overtook the intellectual property of Sendo for $30,000 and paid \u00a3362,575 for the plant, machinery and equipment.\nIn June 2006, Motorola acquired the software platform (AJAR) developed by the British company TTP Communications plc. Later in 2006, the firm announced a music subscription service named \"iRadio\". The technology came after a break in a partnership with Apple Computer (which in 2005 had produced an iTunes compatible cell phone ROKR E1, and most recently, mid-2007, its own iPhone). iRadio was to have many similarities with existing satellite radio services (such as Sirius and XM Radio) by offering live streams of commercial-free music content. Unlike satellite services, however, iRadio content would be downloaded via a broadband internet connection. However, iRadio was never commercially released.\nGreg Brown became Motorola's chief executive officer in 2008. In October 2008, Motorola agreed to sell its Biometrics business to Safran, a French defense firm. Motorola's biometric business unit was headquartered in Anaheim, California. The deal closed in April 2009. The unit became part of Sagem Morpho, which was renamed MorphoTrak.\nSplit of Motorola.\nOn March 26, 2008, Motorola's board of directors approved a split into two different publicly traded companies. This came after talk of selling the company to another corporation. These new companies would comprise the business units of Motorola Mobile Devices and Motorola Broadband &amp; Mobility Solutions. Originally it was expected that this action would be approved by regulatory bodies and complete by mid-2009, but the split was delayed due to company restructuring problems and the 2008\u20132009 extreme economic downturn.\nOn February 11, 2010, Motorola announced it would separate into two independent, publicly traded companies. The cell phone and cable television equipment businesses would spin off to form Motorola Mobility, while the remainder of Motorola, Inc., which comprised the government and enterprise equipment businesses, would become Motorola Solutions. The split was closed on January 4, 2011. Motorola Mobility was eventually acquired by Google on May 22, 2012. Google later sold Motorola Mobility's cable equipment business to Arris Group in December 2012, and Motorola Mobility itself to Lenovo on October 30, 2014.\nDivisions.\nAt the time of its split, Motorola had three divisions:\nCorporate affairs.\nFinances.\nMotorola's handset division recorded a loss of $1.2 billion in the fourth quarter of 2007, while the company as a whole earned $100 million during that quarter. It lost several key executives to rivals, and the website TrustedReviews called the company's products repetitive and un-innovative. Motorola laid off 3,500 workers in January 2008, followed by a further 4,000 job cuts in June and another 20% cut of its research division a few days later. In July 2008, a large number of executives left Motorola to work on Apple Inc.'s iPhone. The company's handset division was also put on offer for sale. Also that month, analyst Mark McKechnie from American Technology Research said that Motorola \"would be lucky to fetch $500 million\" for selling its handset business. Analyst Richard Windsor said that Motorola might have to pay someone to take the division off the company's hands, and that Motorola may even exit the handset market altogether. Its global market share has been on the decline; from 18.4% of the market in 2007 the company had a share of just 6.0% by Q1 2009, but at last, Motorola scored a profit of $26 million in Q2 and showed an increase of 12% in stocks for the first time after losses in many quarters. During the second quarter of 2010, the company reported a profit of $162 million, which compared very favorably to the $26 million earned for the same period the year before. Its Mobile Devices division reported, for the first time in years, earnings of $87 million.\nEnvironmental record.\nMotorola, Inc., along with the Arizona Water Co. had been identified as the sources of trichloroethylene (TCE) contamination that took place in Scottsdale, Arizona. The malfunction led to a ban on the use of water that lasted three days and affected almost 5000 people in the area. Motorola was found to be the main source of the TCE, an industrial solvent that causes cancer. The TCE contamination was caused by a faulty blower on an air stripping tower that was used to take TCE from the water, and Motorola has attributed the situation to operator error.\nOf eighteen leading electronics manufacturers in Greenpeace's Guide to Greener Electronics (October 2010), Motorola shared sixth place with competitors Panasonic and Sony.\nMotorola scored relatively well on the chemicals criteria and has a goal to eliminate PVC plastic and Brominated flame retardants (BFRs), though only in mobile devices and not in all its products introduced after 2010, despite the fact that Sony Ericsson and Nokia were already there. All of its mobile phones were now PVC-free and it had two PVC and BFR-free mobile phones, the A45 ECO and the GRASP; all chargers were also free from PVC and BFRs.\nThe company was also increasing the proportion of recycled materials used in its products. For example, the housings for the MOTO W233 Renew and MOTOCUBO A45 Eco mobile phones contained plastic from post-consumer recycled water cooler bottles. According to the company's information, all of Motorola's newly designed chargers met the current Energy Star requirements and exceed the requirements for standby/no-load modes by at least 67%.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In Japan, it is marketed as the or, previously, as the In the United States it is sold as the Mazda Miata (), and it was formerly marketed under the same name in Canada. The name derives from Old High German for \"reward\".\nProduced at Mazda's Hiroshima plant, the MX-5 debuted in 1989 at the Chicago Auto Show. It was created under the design credo \"Jinba ittai\", meaning \"unity of horse and rider\". Noted for its small, light, balanced and minimalist design, the MX-5 has often been described as a successor to the 1950s and 1960s Italian and British roadsters, with the Lotus Elan serving as a design benchmark.\nEach generation is identified by a two-letter code, beginning with the first generation NA. The second generation NB launched in 1998, followed by the third generation NC in 2005, and the fourth generation ND in 2015.\nMore than one million MX-5s have been sold, making it the best-selling two-seat convertible sports car in history.\nOverview.\nThe original MX-5 was launched at a time when small roadsters had almost disappeared from the market, with the Alfa Romeo Spider as one of the few comparable models still in production, though at a significantly higher price. That left the MX-5 as the spiritual successor to cars like the MGB, Triumph TR7, Triumph Spitfire, and Fiat Spider.\nThe MX-5 was introduced in February 1989 at the Chicago Auto Show. The first generation MX-5 sold 228,961 units between 1989 and 1997.\nThe lightweight, unibody MX-5 has responsive handling and a curb weight under . Its longitudinal truss, marketed as the Powerplant Frame (PPF), provides a rigid connection between the engine and differential to minimize flex and improve balance. Some MX-5 models feature a limited-slip differential, traction control, and an anti-lock braking system.\nWith an approximate 50:50 front/rear weight balance, the car has nearly neutral handling. Inducing oversteer is easy and controllable, making the MX-5 a popular choice for amateur and stock racing, autocross, and club racing.\nConception.\nIn 1976, Bob Hall, a journalist at \"Motor Trend\" magazine who was an expert in Japanese cars and fluent in the language, met Kenichi Yamamoto and Gai Arai, head of Research and Development at Mazda. Yamamoto and Gai Arai asked Hall what kind of car Mazda should make in the future:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I babbled [...] how the [...] simple, bugs-in-the-teeth, wind-in-the-hair, classically-British sports car doesn't exist any more. I told Mr. Yamamoto that somebody should build one [...] inexpensive roadster.\nIn 1981, Hall moved to a product planning position with Mazda USA and again met Yamamoto, now chairman of Mazda Motors, who remembered their conversation about a roadster and in 1982 gave Hall the go-ahead to research the idea further. At this time Hall hired designer Mark Jordan to join the newly formed Mazda design studio in Southern California. There, Hall and Jordan collaborated on the parameters of the initial image, proportion and visualization of the \"light-weight sports\" concept. In 1983, the idea turned concept was approved under the \"Offline 55\" program, an internal Mazda initiative that sought to change the way new models were developed. Thus, under head of project Masakatsu, the concept development was turned into a competition between the Mazda design teams in Tokyo and California.\nThe California team proposed a front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout, codenamed Duo 101, in line with the British roadster ancestry, but their Japanese counterparts favored the more common front-engine, front-wheel-drive layout or the rear mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout.\nThe first round of judging the competing designs was held in April 1984, with designs presented on paper only. The mid-engined car appeared to offer favorable qualities, although it was known at the time that such a layout would struggle to meet the noise, vibration, and harshness (NVH) requirements of the project. It was only at the second round of the competition in August 1984, when full-scale clay models were presented, that the Duo 101 won the competition and was selected as the basis for what would become the MX-5.\nThe Duo 101, so named as either a soft top or hardtop could be used, incorporated many key stylistic cues inspired by the Lotus Elan, a 1960s roadster, including the door handles, tail lamps and grille opening as well as engine appearance and center console layout. International Automotive Design (IAD) in Worthing, England, was commissioned to develop a running prototype, codenamed V705. It was built with a fiberglass body, a engine from a Mazda Familia and components from a variety of early Mazda models. The V705 was completed in August 1985. It was taken to the US where it rolled on the roads around Santa Barbara, California, receiving positive reactions from the public which were filmed for the benefit of Mazda's executives back in Hiroshima.\nThe project received final approval on 18 January 1986. The model's codename was changed to P729 as it moved into the production phase, under head of program Toshihiko Hirai. The task of constructing five engineering \"mules\" (more developed prototypes) was again allocated to IAD, which also conducted the first front and rear crash tests on the P729. While Tom Matano, Mark Jordan, Wu-huang Chin (, also on the RX-7 team), Norman Garrett, and worked on the final design, the project was moved to Japan for engineering and production details.\nBy 1989, with a definitive model name now chosen, the MX-5 was ready to be introduced to the world as a true lightweight sports car, weighing just .\nAlthough Mazda's concept was for the MX-5 to be an inexpensive sports car, at introduction the design met strong demand, with many dealers placing customers on pre-order lists and several dealers across North America increasing the vehicle markup.\nGenerations.\nFirst generation \u2013 NA (1989\u20131997).\nThe first generation MX-5 was introduced in 1989 and was in production until 1997. Upon its release, the car won numerous accolades such as \"Automobile\" Magazine's 1990 Automobile of the Year and \"Car and Driver\"'s 10Best list from 1990 to 1992. It initially featured a straight-four engine making 116 horsepower; in late 1993, a larger 1.8-liter engine was made standard in most markets.\nThe MX-5 was designed with inspiration from the Lotus Elan, with features such as pop-up headlights unique to the NA model. To keep the weight and price down, base models were not equipped with power steering, air conditioning, a sound system, and had steel wheels. A five-speed manual transmission was standard, with the option of a four-speed automatic also available.\nSecond generation \u2013 NB (1998\u20132005).\nThe second generation MX-5 was unveiled in 1997 and put on sale in 1998 for the 1999 model year. While it kept the same proportions of its predecessor, its most noticeable change was the removal of the retractable headlamps, which were eliminated in the face of more stringent pedestrian safety tests. The NB model of the MX-5 featured a slight increase in engine power, a refined interior design and the option of a six-speed manual transmission. In 2001, the model underwent revisions, the second generation boasted a slight increase in engine power, a more refined interior with an updated design, and a newly available six-speed manual transmission. In 2001, further revisions included slightly updated front and rear styling as well as variable-valve timing engine technology for the 1.8-liter engine, which now made . Updated models have since been known as NB2, while the earlier versions are referred to as NB1. While various special editions continued to be introduced throughout the entire NB production run, the Mazdaspeed MX-5 is distinctive for being the only MX-5 to be turbocharged at the factory. The Mazdaspeed variant, built for the model years 2004 and 2005, made from a turbocharged version of the normal 1.8-liter engine, enabling a quarter-mile time of 15.2 seconds and a time of 6.7 seconds. Other Mazdaspeed specs include stiffer and shorter springs, Bilstein shocks, and larger 17-inch wheels.\nThird generation \u2013 NC (2005\u20132015).\nTaking design cues from the 2003 Mazda Ibuki concept car, the third-generation Mazda MX-5 was introduced in 2005 and was in production until 2015. This generation introduced Power Retractable Hard Top (PRHT), a variant featuring a folding hard top mechanism that does not encroach on trunk space. During its release, the third generation MX-5 received several accolades such as the 2005\u20132006 Car of the Year Japan Award and \"Car and Driver\"'s 10Best list from 2006 to 2013.\nFourth generation \u2013 ND (2015\u2013present).\nThe fourth-generation Mazda MX-5 was unveiled in 2014 and has been in production since 2015. An updated model was introduced in 2019 and is visually identical to the pre-update model; the engine was upgraded to and a dual-mass flywheel introduced to the powertrain in the manual transmission. The 2024 version received some minor tweaks.\nThe ND generation introduced a Retractable Fastback (RF) variant that features a rigid roof and buttresses that give the silhouette a more coup\u00e9-like appearance than the soft top convertible. The fourth generation MX-5 has received several accolades such as the 2015-2016 Car of the Year Japan Award, the 2016 World Car of the Year Award, \"Car and Driver\"'s 10Best list from 2016 to 2019, and the Red Dot Best of the Best Award in Product Design 2017. In addition, the car is the basis for the Fiat 124 Spider and Abarth 124 Spider.\nProduction numbers and details.\nIn 2000, the \"Guinness Book of World Records\" declared the MX-5 the best-selling two-seat sports car in history, with a then total production of 531,890 units. The 250,000th MX-5 rolled out of the factory on November 9, 1992; the 500,000th, on February 8, 1999; the 750,000th, in March 2004; the 800,000th in January 2007, and the 900,000th in February 2011.\nOn April 22, 2016, Mazda produced its one millionth MX-5. It was displayed in several cities, where the first 240 people present could sign it before it went to the next destination.\nLegacy and recognition.\nThe MX-5 has won numerous awards, including \"Wheels Magazine\"'s Car of the Year for 1989, 2005 and 2016; \"Sports Car International\"'s \"best sports car of the 1990s\" and \"ten best sports cars of all time\"; 2005\u20132006 Car of the Year Japan; and 2005 Australian Car of the Year. The MX-5 has also made \"Car and Driver\" magazine's annual 10 Best list 17 times. In their December 2009 issue, \"Grassroots Motorsports\" magazine named the MX-5 as the most important sports car built during the previous 25 years. As production continues and generations are added, the core idea, dimensions and basic technology remain, with technological advancements added with each revised version, while adhering to the original goals that led to its creation.\nIn 2009, English automotive critic Jeremy Clarkson wrote: \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The fact is that if you want a sports car, the MX-5 is perfect. Nothing on the road will give you better value. Nothing will give you so much fun. The only reason I'm giving it five stars is because I can't give it fourteen.\nMotorsport.\nLightly modified MX-5s are a popular choice for amateur circuit racing. They are the basis of many spec racing series around the world, including:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It spans the Straits of Mackinac, a body of water connecting Lake Michigan and Lake Huron, two of the Great Lakes. Opened in 1957, the bridge is the world's 29th-longest main span and is the longest suspension bridge between anchorages in the Western Hemisphere. The Mackinac Bridge is part of Interstate\u00a075 (I-75) and carries the Lake Michigan and Huron components of the Great Lakes Circle Tour across the straits; it is also a segment of the U.S. North Country National Scenic Trail. The bridge connects the city of St. Ignace to the north with the village of Mackinaw City to the south.\nEnvisioned since the 1880s, the bridge was designed by the engineer David B. Steinman and completed in 1957 only after many decades of struggles to begin construction. The bridge has since become an iconic symbol of the state of Michigan.\nLength.\nThe bridge opened on November 1, 1957, connecting two peninsulas linked for decades by ferries. At the time, the bridge was formally dedicated as the \"world's longest suspension bridge between anchorages\", allowing a superlative comparison to the Golden Gate Bridge, which has a longer center span between towers, and the San Francisco\u2013Oakland Bay Bridge, which has an anchorage in the middle.\nIt remains the longest suspension bridge with two towers between anchorages in the Western Hemisphere. Much longer anchorage-to-anchorage spans have been built in the Eastern Hemisphere, including the Akashi Kaiky\u014d Bridge in Japan (), but the long leadups to the anchorages on the Mackinac make its total shoreline-to-shoreline length of 26,372 feet\u2014 short of \u2014longer than the Akashi Kaikyo ().\nThe length of the bridge's main span is , which makes it the third-longest suspension span in the United States and 29th longest suspension span worldwide. It is also one of the world's longest bridges overall.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nThe Algonquian peoples who lived in the straits area prior to the arrival of Europeans in the 17th century called this region \"Michilimackinac\", which is widely understood to mean \"Place of the Great Turtle.\" This is thought to refer to the shape of what is now called Mackinac Island. This interpretation of the word is debated by scholars. Trading posts at the Straits of Mackinac attracted peak populations during the summer trading season; they also developed as intertribal meeting places.\nAs usage of the state's mineral and timber resources increased during the 19th century, the area became an important transport hub. In 1881 the three railroads that reached the Straits, the Michigan Central, Grand Rapids &amp; Indiana, and the Detroit, Mackinac &amp; Marquette, jointly established the Mackinac Transportation Company to operate a railroad car ferry service across the straits and connect the two peninsulas.\nImproved highways along the eastern shores of the Lower Peninsula brought increased automobile traffic to the Straits region starting in the 1910s. The state of Michigan initiated an automobile ferry service between Mackinaw City and St. Ignace in 1923; it eventually operated nine ferry boats that would carry as many as 9,000 vehicles per day. Traffic backups could stretch as long as .\nPlans for the bridge.\nAfter the opening of the Brooklyn Bridge in 1883, local residents began to imagine that such a structure could span the straits. In 1884, a store owner in St. Ignace published a newspaper advertisement that included a reprint of an artist's conception of the Brooklyn Bridge with the caption \"Proposed bridge across the Straits of Mackinac\".\nThe idea of the bridge was discussed in the Michigan Legislature as early as the 1880s. At the time, the Straits of Mackinac area was becoming a popular tourist destination, especially following the creation of Mackinac National Park on Mackinac Island in 1875.\nAt a July 1888 meeting of the board of directors of the Grand Hotel on Mackinac Island, Cornelius Vanderbilt II proposed that a bridge be built across the straits, of a design similar to the one then under construction across the Firth of Forth in Scotland. This would advance commerce in the region and help lengthen the resort season of the hotel.\nDecades went by with no formal action. In 1920, the Michigan state highway commissioner advocated construction of a floating tunnel across the Straits. At the invitation of the state legislature, C. E. Fowler of New York City put forth a plan for a long series of causeways and bridges across the straits from Cheboygan, southeast of Mackinaw City, to St. Ignace, using Bois Blanc, Round, and Mackinac islands as intermediate steps.\nFormal planning.\nIn 1923, the state legislature ordered the State Highway Department to establish ferry service across the strait. More and more people used ferries to cross the straits each year, and as they did, the movement to build a bridge increased. Chase Osborn, a former governor, wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Michigan is unifying itself, and a magnificent new route through Michigan to Lake Superior and the Northwest United States is developing, via the Straits of Mackinac. It cannot continue to grow as it ought with clumsy and inadequate ferries for any portion of the year.\nBy 1928, the ferry service had become so popular and so expensive to operate that Governor Fred W. Green ordered the department to study the feasibility of building a bridge across the strait. The department deemed the idea feasible, estimating the cost at $30\u00a0million (equivalent to $ in 2024).\nIn 1934, the Michigan Legislature created the \"Mackinac Straits Bridge Authority\" to explore possible methods of constructing and funding the proposed bridge. The Legislature authorized the Authority to seek financing for the project. In the mid-1930s, during the Great Depression, when numerous infrastructure projects received federal aid, the Authority twice attempted to obtain federal funds for the project but was unsuccessful. The United States Army Corps of Engineers and President Franklin D. Roosevelt endorsed the project but Congress never appropriated funds. Between 1936 and 1940, the Authority selected a route for the bridge based on preliminary studies. Borings were made for a detailed geological study of the route.\nThe preliminary plans for the bridge featured a three-lane roadway, a railroad crossing on the underdeck of the span, and a center-anchorage double-suspension bridge configuration similar to the design of the San Francisco\u2013Oakland Bay Bridge. Because this would have required sinking an anchorage pier in the deepest area of the Straits, the practicality of this design may have been questionable. A concrete causeway, approximately , extending from the northern shore, was constructed in shallow water from 1939 to 1941. However, a unique engineering challenge was created by the tremendous forces that operate against the base of the bridge, because the lakes freeze during the winter, causing large icebergs to place enormous stress on the bridge.\nAt that time, with funding for the project still uncertain, further work was put on hold because of the outbreak of World War II. The \"Mackinac Straits Bridge Authority\" was abolished by the state legislature in 1947, but the same body created a new Mackinac Bridge Authority three years later in 1950. In June 1950, engineers were retained for the project. By then, it was reported that cars queuing for the ferry at Mackinaw City did not reach St. Ignace until five hours later, and the typical capacity of 460 vehicles per hour could not match the estimated 1,600 for a bridge.\nAfter a report by the engineers in January 1951, the state legislature authorized the sale of $85\u00a0million (equivalent to $ in 2024) in bonds for bridge construction on April 30, 1952. However, a weak bond market in 1953 forced a delay of more than a year before the bonds could be issued.\nEngineering and construction.\nDavid B. Steinman was appointed as the design engineer in January 1953 and by the end of 1953, estimates and contracts had been negotiated. A civil engineer at the firm, Abul Hasnat, did the preliminary plans for the bridge. Total cost estimate at that time was $95\u00a0million (equivalent to $ in 2024) with estimated completion by November 1, 1956. Tolls collected were to pay for the bridge in 20 years. Construction began on May 7, 1954. The bridge was built under two major contracts. The Merritt-Chapman and Scott Corporation of New York was awarded the contract for all major substructure work for $25.7 million (equivalent to $ in 2024), while the American Bridge Division of United States Steel Corporation was awarded a contract of more than $44\u00a0million (equivalent to $ in 2024) to build the steel superstructure.\nConstruction, staged using the 1939\u20131941 causeway, took three and a half years (four summers, no winter construction) at a total cost of $100 million and the lives of five workers. Contrary to popular belief, none of them are entombed in the bridge. It opened to traffic on schedule on November 1, 1957, and the ferry service ceased on the same day. The bridge was formally dedicated on June 25, 1958.\nG. Mennen Williams was governor during the construction of the Mackinac Bridge. Williams was the first to pay the toll (then $3.25, equivalent to $ in 2024) to cross the bridge and rode on the \"Vacationland\"'s last St. Ignace\u2013Mackinaw City ferry trip about an hour later, and he later began the tradition of the governor leading the Mackinac Bridge Walk across it every Labor Day. Senator Prentiss M. Brown has been called the \"father of the Mackinac Bridge\", and was honored with a special memorial bridge token created by the Mackinac Bridge Authority.\nThe bridge officially achieved its 100\u00a0millionth crossing exactly 40 years after its dedication, on June 25, 1998. The 50th anniversary of the bridge's opening was celebrated on November 1, 2007, in a ceremony hosted by the Mackinac Bridge Authority at the viewing park adjacent to the St. Ignace causeway. The bridge was designated as a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark by the American Society of Civil Engineers in 2010.\nHistory of the bridge's design.\nThe design of the Mackinac Bridge was directly influenced by the lessons from the first Tacoma Narrows Bridge, which failed in 1940 because of its instability in high winds. Three years after that disaster, Steinman had published a theoretical analysis of suspension-bridge stability problems, which recommended that future bridge designs include deep stiffening trusses to support the bridge deck and an open-grid roadway to reduce its wind resistance. Both of these features were incorporated into the design of the Mackinac Bridge. The stiffening truss is open to reduce wind resistance. The road deck is shaped as an airfoil to provide lift in a cross wind, and the center two lanes are open grid to allow vertical (upward) air flow, which fairly precisely cancels the lift, making the roadway stable in design in winds of up to .\nFacts and figures.\nThe Mackinac Bridge is a toll bridge on Interstate\u00a075 (I-75). The US Highway\u00a027 (US\u00a027) designation was initially extended across the bridge. In November 1960, sections of I-75 freeway opened from Indian River north to the southern bridge approaches in Mackinaw City, and US\u00a027 was removed from the bridge. It is one of only three segments of I-75 that are tolled, the others being the American half of the International Bridge near Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, and Alligator Alley in Florida. The current toll is $4.00 for automobiles and $5.00 per axle for trucks. The Mackinac Bridge Authority raised the toll in 2007 to fund a $300\u00a0million renovation program, which would include completely replacing the bridge deck.\nPainting of the bridge takes seven years, and when painting of the bridge is complete, it begins again. The current painting project began in 1999 and was expected to take 20 years to complete because the lead-based paint needs to be removed, incurring additional disposal requirements.\nThe bridge celebrated its 150 millionth vehicle crossing on September 6, 2009.\nWork and major accident fatalities.\nFive workers died during the construction of the bridge:\nAll five men are memorialized on a plaque near the bridge's northern end (Bridge View Park). Contrary to folklore, no bodies are embedded in the concrete.\nOne worker has died since the bridge was completed. Daniel Doyle fell from scaffolding on August 7, 1997. He survived the fall but fell victim to the water temperature. His body was recovered the next day in of water.\nTwo vehicles have fallen off the bridge:\nOn September 10, 1978, a small private plane carrying United States Marine Corps Reserve officers Maj. Virgil Osborne, Capt. James Robbins, and Capt. Wayne W. Wisbrock smashed into one of the bridge's suspension cables while flying in a heavy fog. The impact tore the wings off the plane, which then plunged into the Straits of Mackinac. All three men were killed.\nWith the exception of the annual Mackinac Bridge Walk on Labor Day, the bridge is not accessible to pedestrians. As a result, suicides by jumping from the bridge have been rare, with the most recent confirmed case taking place on November 4, 2025. No jumps have occurred during the annual bridge walks. There have been roughly a dozen confirmed suicides by people jumping off the bridge .The official number is kept private, and the Mackinac Bridge Authority does not release specific statistics on this matter.\nCrossing the bridge.\nSome individuals have difficulty crossing bridges, a phenomenon known as gephyrophobia. The Mackinac Bridge Authority has a Drivers Assistance Program that provides drivers for those with gephyrophobia, or anyone who is more comfortable having someone else drive them across. More than a thousand people use this service every year. Those interested can arrange, either by phone or with the toll collector, to have their cars or motorcycles driven to the other end. There is an additional fee for this service.\nBicycles and pedestrians are not permitted on the bridge. However, A program is offered to transport bicycles. Up until 2017, an exception was allowed for riders of two annual bicycle tours. A yearly exception is also made for pedestrians, see \"Bridge Walk\" below.\nTravelers across the Mackinac Bridge can listen to an AM radio broadcast that recounts the history of the bridge and provides updates on driving conditions.\nBridge Walk.\nThe first Mackinac Bridge Walk was held in 1958, when it was led by Governor G. Mennen Williams. The first walk was held during the Bridge's Dedication Ceremony held in late June, and has been held on Labor Day since 1959. Until 2018, school buses from local districts transported walkers from Mackinaw City to St. Ignace to begin the walk. Thousands of people, traditionally led by the governor of Michigan, cross the five-mile (8\u00a0km) span on foot from St. Ignace to Mackinaw City. Before 1964, people walked the Bridge from Mackinaw City to St. Ignace. Prior to 2017, two lanes of the bridge would remain open to public vehicle traffic; this policy was changed in 2017 to close the entire bridge to public vehicle traffic for the duration of the event. The Bridge Walk is the only day of the year that hikers can hike this section of the North Country National Scenic Trail.\nTourism.\nDuring the summer months, the Upper Peninsula and Mackinac Bridge are major tourist destinations. In addition to visitors to Mackinac Island, the bridge has attracted interest from a diverse group of tourists including bridge enthusiasts, bird-watchers, and photographers. The Straits area is a popular sailing destination for boats of all types, which make it easier to get a closer view to the underlying structure of the bridge.\nIn media.\nOn June 25, 1958, to coincide with that year's celebration of the November 1957 opening, the United States Postal Service (USPS) released a 3\u00a2 commemorative stamp featuring the recently completed bridge. It was entitled \"Connecting the Peninsulas of Michigan\" and 107,195,200\u00a0copies were issued. The USPS again honored the Mackinac Bridge as the subject of its 2010 priority mail $4.90 stamp, which went on sale February 3. The bridge authority and MDOT unveiled the stamp, which featured a \"seagull's-eye view\" of the landmark, with a passing freighter below. Artist Dan Cosgrove worked from panoramic photographs to create the artwork. This is one of several designs that Cosgrove has produced for the USPS.\nOn April 24, 1959, Captain John S. Lappo, an officer in the Strategic Air Command, operating from Lockbourne AFB flew his Boeing B-47 Stratojet beneath the bridge. Following a general court-martial, he was grounded for life.\nA feature-length documentary entitled \"Building the Mighty Mac\" was produced by Hollywood filmmaker Mark Howell in 1997 and was shown on PBS. The program features numerous interviews with the key people who built the structure and includes restored 16mm color footage of the bridge's construction.\nThe history and building of the bridge was featured in a 2003 episode of the History Channel TV show \"Modern Marvels\".\nOn July 19, 2007, the Detroit Science Center unveiled an , scale model of the Mackinac Bridge. The exhibit was part of the state's 50th anniversary celebration of the bridge. Sherwin-Williams supplied authentic Mackinac Bridge-colored paint for the project.\nThe bridge and its maintenance crew were featured in an episode of the Discovery Channel TV show \"Dirty Jobs\" on August 7, 2007. Host Mike Rowe and crew spent several days filming the episode in May 2007.\nMDOT also featured the bridge on the cover of the 2007 state highway map to celebrate its 50th anniversary.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was released in 1987. The 68030 was the successor to the Motorola 68020, and was followed by the Motorola 68040. In keeping with general Motorola naming, this CPU is often referred to as the 030 (pronounced \"oh-three-oh\" or \"oh-thirty\").\nThe 68030 is essentially a 68020 with a memory management unit (MMU) and instruction and data caches of 256 bytes each. It added a burst mode for the caches, where four longwords can be loaded into the cache in a single operation. The MMU was mostly compatible with the external 68851 that would be used with the 68020, but being internal allowed it to access memory one cycle faster than a 68020/68851 combo. The 68030 did not include a built-in floating-point unit (FPU), and was generally used with the 68881 and the faster 68882. The addition of the FPU was a major design note of the subsequent 68040. The 68030 typically increases performance by \u22485% over the 68020, while reducing power draw by \u224825%.\nThe 68030 features 273,000 transistors. A lower-cost version was also released, the Motorola 68EC030, lacking the on-chip MMU. It was commonly available in both 132-pin QFP and 128-pin PGA packages. The poorer thermal characteristics of the QFP package limited that variant to 33\u00a0MHz; the PGA 68030s included 40\u00a0MHz and 50\u00a0MHz versions. There was also a small supply of QFP packaged EC variants.\nThe 68030 can be used with the 68020 bus, in which case its performance is similar to 68020 that it was derived from. However, the 68030 provides an additional synchronous bus interface which, if used, accelerates memory accesses up to 33% compared to an equally clocked 68020. The finer manufacturing process allowed Motorola to scale the full-version processor to 50\u00a0MHz. The EC variety topped out at 40\u00a0MHz.\nUsage.\nThe 68030 was used in many models of the Apple Macintosh II and Commodore Amiga series of personal computers, NeXT Computer, later Alpha Microsystems multiuser systems, and some descendants of the Atari ST line such as the Atari TT and the Atari Falcon. It was also used in Unix workstations such as the Sun Microsystems Sun-3x line of desktop workstations (the earlier \"sun3\" used a 68020), Apollo Computer's DN3500 and DN4500 workstations, laser printers and the Nortel Networks DMS-100 telephone central office switch. More recently, the 68030 core has also been adapted by Freescale into a microcontroller for embedded applications.\nLeCroy has used the 68EC030 in certain models of their 9300 Series digital oscilloscopes including \u201cC\u201d suffix models87-88 and high performance 9300 Series models, along with the Mega Waveform Processing hardware option for 68020-based 9300 Series models.\nVariants.\nThe 68EC030 is a low cost version of the 68030, the difference between the two being that the 68EC030 omits the on-chip memory management unit (MMU) and is thus essentially an upgraded 68020.\nThe 68EC030 was used as the CPU for the low-cost model of the Amiga 4000, and on a number of CPU accelerator cards for the Commodore Amiga line of computers. It was also used in the Cisco Systems 2500 Series router, a small-to-medium enterprise computer internetworking appliance. Additionally it was also used as the primary processor in a number of Alpha Microsystems Eagle mini-computers.\nThe 50\u00a0MHz speed is exclusive to the ceramic PGA package, the plastic '030 stopped at 40\u00a0MHz.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is the successor to the 68030 and is followed by the 68060, skipping the 68050. In keeping with general Motorola naming, the 68040 is often referred to as simply the '040 (pronounced \"oh-four-oh\" or \"oh-forty\").\nThe 68040 was the first 680x0 family member with an on-chip Floating-Point Unit (FPU). It thus included all of the functionality that previously required external chips, namely the FPU and Memory Management Unit (MMU), which was added in the 68030. It also had split instruction and data caches of 4 kilobytes each. It was fully pipelined, with six stages.\nVersions of the 68040 were created for specific market segments, including the 68LC040, which removed the FPU, and the 68EC040, which removed both the FPU and MMU. Motorola had intended the EC variant for embedded use, but embedded processors during the 68040's time did not need the power of the 68040, so EC variants of the 68020 and 68030 continued to be common in designs.\nMotorola produced several speed grades. The 16\u00a0MHz and 20\u00a0MHz parts were never qualified (XC designation) and used as prototyping samples. 25\u00a0MHz and 33\u00a0MHz grades featured across the whole line, but until around 2000 the 40\u00a0MHz grade was only for the \"full\" 68040. A planned 50\u00a0MHz grade was canceled after it exceeded the thermal design envelope.\nUsage.\nIn Apple Macintosh computers, the 68040 was introduced in the Macintosh Quadra, which was named for the chip. The fastest 68040 processor was clocked at 40\u00a0MHz and it was used only in the Quadra 840AV. The more expensive models in the (short-lived) Macintosh Centris line also used the 68040, while the cheaper Quadra, Centris, Performa, and some late-model LC used the 68LC040. \nThe 68040 was also used in other personal computers, such as the Amiga 4000 and Amiga 4000T, as well as a number of workstations, Alpha Microsystems servers, the HP 9000/400 series, NCR Corporation's TOWER 32/750, 32/825 and 32/850, Apollo Computer's DN5500, and later versions of the NeXT computer.\nThe 68040 processor is used in the flight management computers (FMC) aboard many Boeing 737 aircraft, including all Next Generation and MAX models.\nDesign.\nThe 68040 ran into the transistor budget limit early in design. While the MMU did not take many transistors\u2014indeed, having it on the same die as the CPU actually saved on transistors\u2014the FPU certainly did. Motorola's 68882 external FPU was known as a very high performance unit and Motorola did not wish to risk integrators using the \"LC\" version with a 68882 instead of the more profitable full \"RC\" unit. (For information on Motorola's multiprocessing model with the 680x0 series, see Motorola 68020.) The FPU in the 68040 was incapable of IEEE transcendental functions, which had been supported by both the 68881 and 68882 and were used by the popular fractal generating software of the time and little else. The Motorola floating-point support package (FPSP) emulated these instructions in software under interrupt. As this was an exception handler, heavy use of the transcendental functions caused severe performance penalties.\nHeat was always a problem throughout the 68040's life. While it delivered over four times the per-clock performance of the 68020 and 68030, the chip's complexity and power requirements came from a large die and large caches. This affected the scaling of the processor and it was never able to run with a clock rate exceeding 40\u00a0MHz. A 50\u00a0MHz variant was planned, but canceled. Overclocking enthusiasts reported success reaching 50\u00a0MHz using a 100\u00a0MHz oscillator instead of an 80\u00a0MHz part and the then novel technique of adding oversized heat sinks with fans.\nThe 68040 offered the same features as the Intel 80486, but on a clock-for-clock basis could significantly outperform the Intel chip in integer and floating-point instructions. However, the 80486 had the ability to be clocked significantly faster without suffering from overheating problems, and also quickly spawned a mobile derivative for laptops. Newer-generation Intel 80486-based PC laptops were introduced in 1992, resulting in the 100-series PowerBook being stuck with the aging 68030 which were no longer competitive, and Apple was unable to ship a 68040-equipped PowerBook until the PowerBook Duo 280 and PowerBook 500 series in 1994. \nVariants.\n68EC040.\nThe \"68EC040\" is a version of the Motorola 68040 microprocessor, intended for embedded controllers (EC). It differs from the 68040 in that it has neither an FPU nor an MMU. This makes it less expensive and it draws less power. The 68EC040 was used in Cisco switch Supervisor Engine I that is the heart of models 2900, 2948G, 2980G, 4000, 4500, 5000, 5500, 6000, 6500 and 7600.\n68LC040.\nThe \"68LC040\" is a \"low cost\" version of the Motorola 68040 microprocessor with no FPU. This makes it less expensive and it draws less power. Although the CPU now fits into a feature chart more like the Motorola 68030, it continues to include the 68040's caches and pipeline and is thus significantly faster than the 68030.\nSome mask revisions of the 68LC040 contained a bug that prevents the chip from operating correctly when a software FPU emulator is used. According to Motorola's errata, any chip with a mask set 2E71M or later does not contain the bug. This new mask was introduced in mid-1995 and converted the 68LC040 chip to MC status.\nThe buggy revisions are typically found in 68LC040-based Apple Macintosh computers. Chips with mask set 2E23G (as used in the LC 475) have been confirmed to be faulty. The fault relates to pending writes being lost when the F-line exception is triggered. The 68040 cannot update its microcode in the manner of modern x86 chips. This means that the only way to use software that requires floating-point functionality is to replace the buggy 68LC040 with a later revision, or a full 68040.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "20325", "revid": "7903804", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20325", "title": "Motorola 68060", "text": "Motorola 680x0 microprocessor, released in April 1994\nThe Motorola 68060 (\"sixty-eight-oh-sixty\") is a 32-bit microprocessor from Motorola released in April 1994. It is the successor to the Motorola 68040 and is the highest performing member of the 68000 series. The 68060 is the last development of the 68000 family for general purpose use, abandoned in favor of the PowerPC chips. Two derivatives were produced, the 68LC060 (low cost) which lacked the floating-point unit (FPU) and the 68EC060 (embedded controller) which removed both the FPU and memory management unit (MMU).\nArchitecture.\nThere is an LC (Low-Cost) version, without an FPU and EC (Embedded Controller), without MMU and FPU. The 68060 design was led by Joe Circello.\nThe 68060 shares most architectural features with the P5 Pentium. Both have a very similar superscalar in-order dual instruction pipeline configuration, and an instruction decoder which breaks down complex instructions into simpler ones before execution, described publicly as \"two four-stage RISC engines [that] execute the fixed-format instructions emitted by the instruction converter\". Such translated instructions are stored in a 16-entry FIFO buffer, with more complex 68000 instructions occupying multiple entries, and with some of the most complex instructions causing trap conditions for software to handle accordingly.\nHowever, a significant difference to the Pentium is that the 68060 FPU is not pipelined and is therefore up to three times slower than the Pentium in floating point applications. In contrast to that, integer multiplications and bit shifting instructions are significantly faster on the 68060. The 68060 has the ability to execute simple instructions in the address generation unit (AGU) and thereby supply the result two cycles before the ALU. In the development of the 68060, large amounts of commercial compiled code were analyzed for clues as to which instructions would be the best candidates for performance optimization.\nAgainst the Pentium, the 68060 can perform better on mixed code; Pentium's decoder cannot issue an FP instruction every opportunity and hence the FPU is not superscalar as the ALUs were. If the 68060's non-pipelined FPU can accept an instruction, it can be issued one by the decoder. This means that optimizing for the 68060 is easier: no rules prevent FP instructions from being issued whenever was convenient for the programmer other than well understood instruction latencies. However, with properly optimized and scheduled code, the Pentium's FPU is capable of double the clock for clock throughput of the 68060's FPU.\nThe 68060 is the last development of the 68000 family for general purpose use, abandoned in favor of the PowerPC chips. It saw use in some late-model Amiga machines and Amiga accelerator cards as well as some Atari ST clones and Falcon accelerator boards (CT60/CT63/CT60e, the latter of which was created in 2015), and very late models of the Alpha Microsystems multiuser computers before their migration to x86, but Apple Inc. and the Unix world had moved onto various RISC platforms by the time the 68060 was available. As early as 1989, Apple had indicated a continuing commitment to using the 68040 and its successor, anticipated as the 68050, in its Macintosh range, alongside \"preparatory work\" on a Macintosh based on Intel's 80486, also indicating no plans to adopt RISC architectures in such a role. By the arrival of the 68060, however, the company had already announced its adoption of PowerPC, developed by IBM and Motorola, prior to the availability of the 68060.\nUpon introduction of low-power variants of the 68040 and other devices, Motorola anticipated that Apple might leave a space in its product range for 68060-based products, giving the company \"a high performance hedge in case the transition to RISC proves problematic\". In late 1992, Apple chairman John Sculley had indicated usage of the 68060 in server products from 1993, followed up by products based on PowerPC from 1994. With the 68060 only arriving in 1994, the Apple Workgroup Server range ultimately transitioned from products based on the 68040 directly to those employing PowerPC processors.\nThe 68060 was introduced at 50 MHz on Motorola's 0.6 \u03bcm manufacturing process. A few years later it was shrunk to 0.42 \u03bcm and clock speed raised to 66 MHz and 75 MHz. Some users managed to overclock rev6. 68060 CPU-s (mask: 71E41J) up to 120 or 133 MHz. Motorola projected a performance of around three-and-a-half times that of a 25 MHz 68040 at the initial clock rate of 50 MHz for the 68060, this described as being \"about 77 MIPS\", later adjusting such claims to three times the performance of the 68040 for a 68060 running at twice the frequency of the 68040. Benchmarking of the 50 MHz 68060 fitted in accelerator cards for the Commodore Amiga indicated Dhrystone 2.1 benchmark results of around 80,000 Dhrystones per second, this being broadly comparable to a Sun SPARCstation 10 workstation.\nDevelopments of the basic core continue, intended for embedded systems. Here they are combined with a number of peripheral interfaces to reduce the overall complexity and power requirements of a design. A number of chips, each with different sets of interfaces, are sold under the names ColdFire and DragonBall.\nHistory.\nModel numbers with even second-to-last digit (68000, 68020, 68040, 68060) were reserved for major revisions to the 680x0 core architecture. Model numbers with odd second-to-last digit (68010, 68030) were reserved for upgrades to the architecture of the previous chip. Motorola never produced a 68050.\nFor example, the Motorola 68010 (and the obscure 68012) is a 68000 with improvements to the loop instruction and the ability to suspend then continue an instruction in the event of a page fault, enabling the use of virtual memory with the appropriate MMU hardware. There were, however, no major overhauls of the core architecture. Similarly, the Motorola 68030 represents a process improvement on the 68020 with the MMU and a small data cache (256 bytes) moved on-chip. The 68030 was released in speed ratings up to 50 MHz.\nThe jump from the 68000/68010 to the 68020/68030, however, represents a major overhaul, with innumerable individual changes.\nBy the time the 68060 was in production, Motorola had abandoned development of the 68000 family in favor of the PowerPC. The 68060 is the last 68000 family processor from Motorola.\nSignetics (Philips) produced a 68000-based variant that they somewhat confusingly named the 68070. It contains a modestly-improved 68000 CPU, a simple on-chip MMU and an I\u00b2C bus controller. It came out long before the 68060 and was used principally as an embedded processor in some consumer electronics items, notably CD-i consoles.\nUsage.\nChyron's iNFiNiT!, Max!, and Maxine! series of television character generators use the 68060 as the main processor. These character generators were a fixture on many American television networks' affiliate stations.\nIn desktops, the 68060 is used in some variants of the Amiga 4000T produced by Amiga Technologies, and available as a third party upgrade for other Amiga models. It is also used in the Amiga clone DraCo non-linear video system.\nMedusa Computer Systems of Switzerland introduced the Hades 060 computer in 1996, aiming for compatibility with the Atari ST family of systems, featuring a 68060 core at 120\u00a0MHz, a 30MHz bus, 4 MB (EDO or SIM) RAM upgradeable to 1\u00a0GB, 2 ISA slots, 4 PCI slots, 1 VME slot, and 1 E-IDE slot. In graphical terms, the computer could manage ATI 64, ET 4000 and ET 6000 graphic cards at 135\u00a0MHz (with 2 or 4\u00a0MB). A modified TOS 3.06 was used, with MultiTOS possible and NVDI. The Hades 060 followed on from the earlier Medusa T60 system.\nThe Q60 extended the Sinclair QL design similarly from the slowest start to the ultimate pace of the 68K architecture's capabilities; these 68060-based motherboards\u2014at 66\u00a0MHz for the full 68060 or a non-FPU 68LC060 option overclocked to 80\u00a0MHz\u2014are more than 100 times faster than the Sinclair QL while running the same operating systems.\nThe 68060 was used in Nortel Meridian 1 Option 51, 61 and 81 large office PBX systems, powering the CP3 and CP4 core processor boards. A pair of these boards each sporting a 68060 could be used to make the PBX fault tolerant. This was a logical application as previous Meridian 1 cores used other Motorola chips. Nortel later changed the architecture to use Intel processors.\nA 68060 processor upgrade to Wellfleet Communications' Backbone Concentrator Node (BCN) router was announced in 1995.\nThe Motorola Vanguard 6560 multiprotocol router uses a 50\u00a0MHz 68EC060 processor.\nMotorola MVME-17x and Force Computer SYS68K VMEbus systems use a 68060 CPU.\nAlpha Microsystems AM-6000, AM-6060, and AM-7000 use a 68060.

It was designed by Motorola's Terry Ritter and Joel Boney and introduced in 1978. Although source compatible with the earlier Motorola 6800, the 6809 offered significant improvements over it and 8-bit contemporaries like the MOS Technology 6502, including a hardware multiplication instruction, 16-bit arithmetic, system and user stack registers allowing re-entrant code, improved interrupts, position-independent code, and an orthogonal instruction set architecture with a comprehensive set of addressing modes.\nThe 6809 was among the most powerful 8-bit processors of its era. It was also among the most expensive; in 1981 single-unit quantities were $ compared to $ for a Zilog Z80 and $ for a 6502. It was launched when a new generation of 16-bit processors were coming to market, like the Intel 8086, and 32-bit designs were on the horizon, including Motorola's own 68000. It was not feature competitive with newer designs and not price competitive with older ones.\nUsage.\nThe 6809 is used in the TRS-80 Color Computer, Dragon 32/64, SuperPET, ENER 1000, Fujitsu FM-7, the Cybernex LC3, and Thomson MO/TO home computers, the Vectrex game console, and early 1980s arcade video games such as \"Star Wars\" and \"Gyruss\". Also, Williams Electronics used the 6809 in arcade games such as \"Defender\", \"\", and \"Joust\". In the 1990s, Williams introduced the WPC platform (based on the 68B09) for the pinball machines the company was producing at the time. Series II of the Fairlight CMI digital audio workstation and Konami's \"Time Pilot '84\" arcade game each use dual 6809 processors. Hitachi was a major user of the 6809 and later produced an updated version as the Hitachi 6309.\nHistory.\n6800 and 6502.\nThe Motorola 6800 was designed beginning in 1971 and released in 1974. In overall design terms, it has a strong resemblance to other CPUs that were designed from the start as 8-bit designs, like the Intel 8080. It was initially fabricated using early NMOS logic, which normally required several different power supply voltages. A key feature was an on-chip voltage doubler that allowed it to run on a single supply, a major advantage over its competitors like the 8080 which required , , and .\nThe 6800 was initially fabricated using the then-current contact lithography process. In this process, the photomask is placed in direct contact with the wafer, exposed, and then lifted off. There was a small chance that some of the etching material would be left on the wafer when it was lifted, causing future chips patterned with the mask to fail. For complex multi-patterned designs like a CPU, this led to about 90% of the chips failing when tested. To make a profit on the small number of chips that did work, the prices for the working models had to be fairly high, on the order of hundreds of dollars in small quantities.\nSome of the 6800's designers were convinced that a lower-cost system would be key to widespread acceptance. Notable among them was Chuck Peddle, who was sent on sales trips and saw prospective customers repeatedly reject the design as being too expensive for their intended uses. He began a project to produce a much less costly design, but Motorola's management proved uninterested and eventually told him to stop working on it. Peddle and some other members of the 6800 team left Motorola for MOS Technology and introduced this design in 1975 as the MOS Technology 6502.\nThe 6800 was initially sold at $ in single-unit quantities, but had been lowered to $. The 6502 was introduced at $, and Motorola immediately reduced the 6800 to $125. It remained uncompetitive and sales prospects dimmed. The introduction of the Micralign to Motorola's lines allowed further reductions and by 1981 the price of the then-current 6800P was slightly less than the equivalent 6502, at least in single-unit quantities. By that point, however, the 6502 had sold tens of millions of units and the 6800 had been largely forgotten.\n6809.\nWhile the 6502 began to take over the 6800's market, Intel was experiencing the same problem when the upstart Zilog Z80 began to steal sales from the Intel 8080. Both Motorola and Intel began new design cycles to leapfrog those designs. Intel responded by quickly introducing a small but practical upgrade of the 8080 as the 8085, which made it less expensive to use and more competitive with the Z80. They also began to design a series of 16-bit processors, which emerged as the Intel 8086 in 1978. Motorola also began the design of a similar high-end design, in the MACSS project, but did not initially consider an improved 8-bit design. But when they polled their existing 6800 customers, they found that many were not willing to pay for a 16-bit design for their simple needs. This led to the decision to produce a greatly improved but compatible 8-bit design that became the 6809.\nAnalysis of 6800 code demonstrated that loads and stores were the vast majority of all the time in CPU terms, accounting for 39% of all the operations in the code they examined. In contrast, mathematical operations were relatively rare, only 2.8% of the code. However, a careful examination of the loads and stores noted that many of these were being combined with adds and subtracts, revealing that a significant amount of those math operations were being performed on 16-bit values. This led to the decision to include basic 16-bit mathematics in the new design: load, store, add, and subtract. Similarly, increments and decrements accounted for only 6.1% of the code, but these almost always occurred within loops where each one was performed many times. This led to the addition of post-incrementing and pre-decrementing modes using the index registers.\nThe main goal for the new design was to support position-independent code. Motorola's market was mostly embedded systems and similar single-purpose systems, which often ran programs that were very similar to those on other platforms. Development for these systems often took the form of collecting a series of pre-rolled subroutines and combining them together. However, as assembly language is generally written starting at a base address, combining pre-written modules normally required a lengthy process of changing constants (or equates) that pointed to key locations in the code.\nMotorola's idea was to eliminate this task and make the building-block concept much more practical. System integrators would simply combine off-the-shelf code in ROMs to handle common tasks. Libraries of common routines like floating point arithmetic, graphics primitives, Lempel-Ziv compression, and so forth would be available to license, combine together along with custom code, and burn to ROM.\nIn previous processor designs, including the 6800, there was a mix of ways to refer to memory locations. Some of these were relative to the current location in memory or to a value in an index register, while others were absolute, a 16-bit value that referred to a physical location in memory. The former style allows code to be moved because the address it references will move along with the code. The absolute locations do not; code that uses this style of addressing will have to be recompiled if it moves. To address this, the 6809 filled out its instruction opcodes so that there were more instances of relative addressing where possible.\nAs an example, the 6800 includes an 8-bit direct addressing mode used to make code smaller and faster; instead of a memory address having 16 bits and thus requiring two bytes to specify, commonly used variables could be located within a 256-byte window (called the \"direct page\" on the 6800 or \"zero page\" on the 6502 because of its location at the bottom of memory) and accessed with an 8-bit address. The downside was competition for valuable direct page addresses. The 6809 added a new 8-bit DP register, allowing direct page addressing to refer to any part of memory as long as the DP register is changed to point to its new location.\nA second category of data was constant data stored in ROM such as strings and lookup tables. To solve the problem of easily referring to such data while remaining position independent, the 6809 added a variety of new addressing modes. Among these was program-counter-relative addressing which allowed any memory location to be referred to by its location relative to the instruction. Moving this code to a new location in memory would have no effect on the addresses. Additionally, the stack was more widely used, so that a program in ROM could set aside a block of memory in RAM, set the SP to be the base of the block, and then refer to data within it using relative values.\nTo aid this type of access, the 6809 renamed the SP to U for \"user\", and added a second stack pointer, S, for \"system\". The idea was user programs would use U while the CPU itself would use S to store data during subroutine calls. This allowed system code to be easily called by changing S without affecting any other running program. For instance, a program calling a floating-point routine in ROM would place its data on the U stack and then call the routine, which could then perform the calculations using data on its own private stack pointed to by S, and then return, leaving the U stack untouched.\nAnother reason for the expanded stack access was to support reentrant code, code that can be called from various different programs concurrently without concern for coordination between them, or that can recursively call itself. This makes the construction of operating systems much easier; the operating system had its own stack, and the processor could quickly switch between a user application and the operating system simply by changing which stack pointer it was using. This also makes servicing interrupts much easier for the same reason.4 The 6809 adds a fast interrupt request (FIRQ) interrupt that saves only the program counter and condition code register before calling the interrupt code, whereas the IRQ interrupt saves all registers, taking additional cycles, then more to unwind the stack on exit.\nThe 6809 included one of the earliest dedicated hardware multipliers. It takes 8-bit numbers in the A and B accumulators and produces a 16-bit result in A:B, known collectively as D.\nMarket acceptance.\nMuch of the design had been based around the market concept of building-block code. But the market for pre-rolled ROM modules never materialized: Motorola's only released example was the MC6839 floating-point ROM. The industry as a whole solved the problem of integrating code modules from separate sources by using automatic relocating linkers and loaders, which is the solution used today. However, the decisions made by the design team enabled multi-user, multitasking operating systems like OS-9 and UniFlex.\nThe added features of the 6809 were costly; the CPU had approximately 9,000 transistors compared to the 6800's 4,100 or the 6502's 3,500. While process improvements meant it could be fabricated cheaper than the original 6800, those same improvements were being applied to the other designs and so the relative cost remained the same. Such was the case in practice; in 1981 the 6809 sold in single-unit quantities for roughly six times the price of a 6502. For those systems that needed some of its special features, like the hardware multiplier, the system could justify its price, but in most roles, it was overlooked.\nAnother factor in its low use was the presence of newer designs with significantly higher performance. Among these was the Intel 8086, released the same year, and its lower-cost version, the Intel 8088 of 1979. A feeling for the problem can be seen in the Byte Sieve assembly language results against other designs from the era (taken from 1981 and 1983):\nAlthough the 6809 did offer a performance improvement over the likes of the 6502 and Z80, the improvement was not in line with the increase in price. For those where price was not the primary concern, but outright performance was, the new designs outperformed it by as much as an order of magnitude.\nEven before the 6809 was released, in 1976 Motorola had launched its own advanced CPU project, then known as Motorola Advanced Computer System on Silicon project, or MACSS. Although too late to be chosen for the IBM PC project, when MACSS appeared as the Motorola 68000 in 1979 it took any remaining interest in the 6809. Motorola soon announced that their future 8-bit systems would be powered by cut-down versions of the 68000 rather than further improved versions of the 6809.\nMajor uses.\nIts first major use was in the TRS-80 Color Computer, which happened largely by accident. Motorola had been asked to design a color-capable computer terminal for an online farm-aid project, a system known as \"AgVision\". Tandy (Radio Shack) was brought in as a retail partner and sold them under the name \"VideoTex\", but the project was ultimately canceled shortly after its introduction in 1980. Tandy then re-worked the design to produce a home computer, which became one of the 6809's most notable design wins.\nLooking for a low-cost programming platform for computer science students, the University of Waterloo developed a system that combined a 6809-based computer-on-a-card with an existing Commodore PET, including a number of programming languages and program editors in ROM. The result was later picked up by Commodore, who sold it as the SuperPET, or MicroMainframe in Europe. These were relatively popular in the mid-1980s before the introduction of the PC clone market took over the programming role for most users.\nOther popular home computer uses include the Fujitsu FM-7, Canon CX-1, Dragon 32/64, and the Thomson TO7 series. It was also available as an option on the Acorn System 2, 3 and 4 computers. Most SS-50 bus designs that had been built around the 6800 also had options for the 6809 or switched to it exclusively. Examples include machines from SWTPC, Gimix, Smoke Signal Broadcasting, etc. Motorola also build a series of EXORmacs and EXORset development systems.\nHitachi produced its own 6809-based machines, the MB-6890 and later the S1. These were primarily for the Japanese market, but some were exported to and sold in Australia, where the MB-6890 was dubbed the \"Peach\", probably in reference to the Apple II. The S1 was notable in that it contained paging hardware extending the 6809's native 64 kilobyte addressing range to a full 1 megabyte in 4 KB pages. It was similar in this to machines produced by SWTPC, Gimix, and several other suppliers. TSC produced a Unix-like operating system uniFlex which ran only on such machines. OS-9 Level II, also took advantage of such memory management facilities. Most other computers of the time with more than 64 KB of memory addressing were limited to bank switching where much if not all the 64 KB was simply swapped for another section of memory, although in the case of the 6809, Motorola offered their own MC6829 MMU design mapping 2 megabytes in 2 KB pages.\nThe 6809 also saw use in various videogame systems. Notable among these, in the 68A09 incarnation, was the unique vector graphics-based Vectrex home videogame machine. It was also used in the Milton Bradley Expansion (MBX) system (an arcade console for the TI-99/4A home computer), and a series of arcade games released during the early to mid-1980s. Williams Electronics was a prolific user of the processor, which was deployed in \"Defender\", \"Stargate\", \"Joust\", \"\", \"Sinistar\", and other games. The 6809 CPU forms the core of the successful Williams Pinball Controller. The KONAMI-1 is a modified 6809 used by Konami in \"Roc'n Rope\", \"Gyruss\", and \"The Simpsons\".\nSeries II of the Fairlight CMI (computer musical instrument) used dual 6809 CPUs running OS-9, and also used one 6809 CPU per voice card. The 6809 was often employed in music synthesizers from other manufacturers such as Oberheim (Xpander, Matrix 6/12/1000), PPG (Wave 2/2.2/2.3, Waveterm A), and Ensoniq (Mirage sampler, SDP-1, ESQ-1, SQ-80). The latter used the 6809E as their main CPU. The (E) version was used in order to synchronize the microprocessor's clock to the sound chip (Ensoniq 5503 DOC) in those machines; in the ESQ-1 and SQ-80 the 68B09E was used, requiring a dedicated arbiter logic in order to ensure 1\u00a0MHz bus timing when accessing the DOC chip.\nIn contrast to earlier Motorola products, the 6809 did not see widespread use in the microcontroller field. It was used in traffic signal controllers made in the 1980s by several different manufacturers, as well as Motorola's SMARTNET and SMARTZONE Trunked Central Controllers (so dubbed the \"6809 Controller\"). These controllers were used as the central processors in many of Motorola's trunked two-way radio communications systems.\nThe 6809 was used by Mitel as the main processor in its SX20 Office Telephone System.\nVersions.\nThe Motorola 6809 was originally produced in 1\u00a0MHz, 1.5\u00a0MHz (68A09) and 2\u00a0MHz (68B09) speed ratings. Faster versions were produced later by Hitachi. With little to improve, the 6809 marks the end of the evolution of Motorola's 8-bit processors; Motorola intended that future 8-bit products would be based on an 8-bit data bus version of the 68000 (the 68008). A microcontroller version with a slightly modified instruction set, the 6811, was discontinued as late as the second decade of the 21st century.\nThe Hitachi 6309 is an enhanced version of the 6809 with extra registers and additional instructions, including block move, additional multiply instructions, and division.\nLegacy.\nMotorola spun off its microprocessor division in 2004. The division changed its name to Freescale and was subsequently acquired by NXP.\nNeither Motorola nor Hitachi produce 6809 processors or derivatives anymore. 6809 cores are available in VHDL and can be programmed into an FPGA and used as an embedded processor with speed ratings up to 40\u00a0MHz. Some 6809 opcodes also live on in the Freescale embedded processors. In 2015, Freescale authorized Rochester Electronics to start manufacturing the MC6809 once again as a drop-in replacement and copy of the original NMOS device. Freescale supplied Rochester the original GDSII physical design database. At the end of 2016, Rochester's MC6809 (including the MC68A09, and MC68B09) is fully qualified and available in production.\nAustralian developer John Kent has synthesized the Motorola 6809 CPU in hardware description language (HDL). This has made possible the use of the 6809 core at much higher clock speeds than were available with the original 6809. Gary Becker's CoCo3FPGA runs the Kent 6809 core at 25\u00a0MHz. Roger Taylor's Matchbox CoCo runs at 7.16\u00a0MHz. Dave Philipsen's CoCoDEV runs at 25\u00a0MHz.\nDescription.\nThe 6809's internal design is closer to simpler, non-microcoded CPU designs. Like most 8-bit microprocessors, the 6809 implementation is a register-transfer level machine, using a central PLA to implement much of the instruction decoding as well as parts of the sequencing.\nLike the 6800 and 6502, the 6809 uses a two-phase clock to gate the latches. This two-phase clock cycle is used as a full machine cycle in these processors. Simple instructions can execute in as little as two or three such cycles. The 6809 has an internal two-phase clock generator (needing only an external crystal) whereas the 6809E needs an external clock generator. There are variants such as the 68A09(E) and 68B09(E); the internal letter indicates the processor's rated clock speed.\nThe 6800, 6502, the 6809's clock system differs from other processors of the era. For instance, the Z80 uses a single external clock and the internal steps of the instruction process continue on each transition. This means that the external clock generally runs much faster; 680x designs generally ran at 1 or 2\u00a0MHz while the Z80 generally ran at 2 or 4. Internally, the 680x's divided the external clock frequency by four to create the system clock; so a 1\u00a0MHz 6809 would have a 4\u00a0MHz crystal or clock signal. Typically, on an instruction-for-instruction basis, they ran roughly twice as fast, when comparing the external clocks to other microprocessors.\nThe advantage to the 680x style access was that dynamic RAM chips of the era generally ran at 2\u00a0MHz. Due to the cycle timing, there were periods of the internal clock where the memory bus was guaranteed to be free. This allowed the computer designer to interleave access to memory between the CPU and an external device, say a direct memory access controller, or more commonly, a graphics chip. By running both chips at 1\u00a0MHz and stepping them one after the other, they could share access to the memory without any additional complexity or circuitry. Depending on version and speed grade, approximately 40\u201360% of a single clock cycle is typically available for memory access in a 6800, 6502, or 6809.\nRegisters and instructions.\nThe original 6800 included two 8-bit accumulators, A and B, a single 16-bit index register, X, a 16-bit program counter, PC, a 16-bit stack pointer, SP, and an 8-bit status register. The 6809 added a second index register, Y, a second stack pointer, U (while renaming the original S), and allowed the A and B registers to be treated as a single 16-bit accumulator, D. It also added another 8-bit register, DP, to set the base address of the direct page. These additions were invisible to 6800 code, and the 6809 was 100% source-compatible with earlier code.\nAnother significant addition was program-counter-relative addressing for all data manipulation instructions. This was a key addition for position-independent code, as it allows data to be referred to relative to the instruction, and as long as the resulting memory location exists then the instructions can be moved in memory freely. The system retained its previous addressing modes as well, although in the new assembler language, what were previously separate instructions were now considered to be different addressing modes on other instructions. This reduced the number of instructions from the 6800's 78 instructions to the 6809's 59. These new modes had the same opcodes as the previously separate instruction, so these changes were only visible to the programmer working on new code.\nThe instruction set and register complement are highly orthogonal, making the 6809 easier to program than contemporaries. Like the 6800, the 6809 includes an undocumented address bus test instruction which came to be nicknamed Halt and Catch Fire (HCF).\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It descended from the Motorola 6800 microprocessor by way of the 6801. The 68HC11 devices are more powerful and more expensive than the 68HC08 microcontrollers and are used in automotive applications, barcode readers, hotel card key writers, amateur robotics, and various other embedded systems. The MC68HC11A8 was the first microcontroller to include CMOS EEPROM.\nArchitecture.\nInternally, the HC11 instruction set is backward compatible with the 6800 and features the addition of a Y index register. It has two eight-bit accumulators, A and B, two sixteen-bit index registers, X and Y, a condition code register, a 16-bit stack pointer, and a program counter. In addition, there is an 8 x 8-bit multiply (A x B), with full 16-bit result, and fractional/integer 16-bit by 16-bit divide instructions. A range of 16-bit instructions treat the A and B registers as a combined 16-bit D register for comparison (X and Y registers may also be compared to 16-bit memory operands), addition, subtraction and shift operations, or can add the B accumulator to the X or Y index registers. Bit test operations have also been added, performing a logical and function between operands, setting the correct conditions codes, but not modifying the operands.\nDifferent versions of the HC11 have different numbers of external ports, labeled alphabetically. The most common version has five ports, A, B, C, D, and E, but some have as few as 3 ports (version D3). Each port is eight bits wide except for D, which is six bits (in some variations of the chip, D also has eight bits). It can be operated with an internal program and RAM (1 to 768 bytes) or an external memory of up to 64 kilobytes. With external memory, B and C are used as address and data bus. In this mode, port C is multiplexed to carry both the lower byte of the address and data.\nImplementations.\nIn the early 1990s Motorola produced an evaluation board kit for the 68HC11 with several UARTs, RAM, and an EPROM. The cost of the evaluation kit was $68.11.\nThe standard monitor for the HC11 family is called BUFFALO, \"Bit User Fast Friendly Aid to Logical Operation\". It can be stored in on-chip ROM, EPROM, or external memory (also typically EPROM). BUFFALO is available for most 68HC11 family derivatives as it generally only depends upon having access to a single UART (SCI, or Serial Communications Interface, in Motorola parlance). BUFFALO can also run on devices that do not have internal non-volatile memory, such as the 68HC11A0, A1, E0, E1, and F1 derivatives.\nOther versions.\nThe Freescale 68HC16 microcontroller family is intended as a 16-bit mostly software-compatible upgrade of the 68HC11.\nThe Freescale 68HC12 microcontroller family is an enhanced 16-bit version of the 68HC11.\nThe Handy Board robotics controller by Fred Martin is based on the 68HC11.\nA MC68HC24 port replacement unit is available for the 68HC11D, which lacks ports B and C. When placed on the external address bus, it replicates the original functions of B and C. This chip was also used in the evaluation board for in-circuit emulation. Port A has input capture, output compare, pulse accumulator, and other timer functions; port D has serial I/O, and port E has an analog-to-digital converter (ADC).\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "20333", "revid": "40765055", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20333", "title": "Merovingian dynasty", "text": "Ruling family of the Franks (c. 481\u2013751)\nThe Merovingian dynasty () was the ruling family of the Franks from around the middle of the 5th century until Pepin the Short in 751. They first appear as \"Kings of the Franks\" in the Roman army of northern Gaul. By 509 they had united all the Franks and northern Gallo-Romans under their rule. They conquered most of Gaul, defeating the Visigoths (507) and the Burgundians (534), and also extended their rule into Raetia (537). In Germania, the Alemanni, Bavarii and Saxons accepted their lordship. The Merovingian realm was the largest and most powerful of the states of western Europe following the breakup of the empire of Theodoric the Great.\nThe dynastic name, medieval Latin or (\"sons of Merovech\"), derives from an unattested Frankish form, akin to the attested Old English , with the final -\"ing\" being a typical Germanic patronymic suffix. The name derives from Salian King Merovech, who is at the center of many legends. Unlike the Anglo-Saxon royal genealogies, the Merovingians never claimed descent from a god, nor is there evidence that they were regarded as sacred.\nThe Merovingians' long hair distinguished them from other Franks, who commonly cut their hair short. Contemporaries sometimes referred to them as the \"long-haired kings\" (Latin \"reges criniti\"). A Merovingian whose hair was cut could not rule, and a rival could be removed from the succession by being tonsured and sent to a monastery. The Merovingians also used a distinct name stock. One of their names, Clovis, evolved into Louis and remained common among French royalty down to the 19th century.\nThe first well-known Merovingian king was Childeric I (died 481). His son Clovis I (died 511) converted to Nicene Christianity, united the Franks and conquered most of Gaul. The Merovingians treated their kingdom as single yet divisible. Clovis's four sons divided the kingdom among themselves, and it remained divided until 679 with the exception of four short periods (558\u2013561, 613\u2013623, 629\u2013634, 673\u2013675). After that it was divided again only once (717\u2013718). The main divisions of the kingdom were Austrasia, Neustria, Burgundy and Aquitaine.\nDuring the final century of Merovingian rule, the kings were increasingly pushed into a ceremonial role. Actual power was increasingly in the hands of the mayor of the palace, the highest-ranking official under the king. In 656, the mayor Grimoald I tried to place his son Childebert on the throne in Austrasia. Grimoald was arrested and executed; but his son ruled until 661, when the Merovingian dynasty was restored. When King Theuderic IV died in 737, the mayor Charles Martel continued to rule the kingdoms until his death in 741. The dynasty was restored again in 743, but in 751 Charles's son, Pepin the Short, deposed the last king, Childeric III, and had himself crowned, initiating the Carolingian dynasty.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nLegendary origins.\nThe 7th-century \"Chronicle of Fredegar\" implies that the Merovingians were descended from a sea-beast called a quinotaur:\nIt is said that while Chlodio was staying at the seaside with his wife one summer, his wife went into the sea at midday to bathe, and a beast of Neptune rather like a Quinotaur found her. In the event she was made pregnant, either by the beast or by her husband, and she gave birth to a son called Merovech, from whom the kings of the Franks have subsequently been called Merovingians.\nIn the past, this tale was regarded as an authentic piece of Germanic mythology and was often taken as evidence that the Merovingian kingship was sacral and the royal dynasty of supernatural origin. Today, it is more commonly seen as an attempt to explain the meaning of the name Merovech (sea-bull): \"Unlike the Anglo-Saxon rulers the Merovingians\u2014if they ever themselves acknowledged the quinotaur tale, which is by no means certain\u2014made no claim to be descended from a god\".\nIn 1906, the British Egyptologist Flinders Petrie suggested that the Marvingi recorded by Ptolemy as living near the Rhine were the ancestors of the Merovingian dynasty.\nHistory.\nIn 486 Clovis I, the son of Childeric, defeated Syagrius, a Roman military leader who competed with the Merovingians for power in northern France. He won the Battle of Tolbiac against the Alemanni in 496, according to Gregory of Tours, Clovis adopted his wife Clotilda's Orthodox\u2014i.e., Nicene\u2014Christian faith at a time when other Germanic tribes were largely Arian. He subsequently went on to decisively defeat the Visigothic kingdom of Toulouse in the Battle of Vouill\u00e9 in 507. After Clovis's death, his kingdom was partitioned among his four sons. This tradition of partition continued over the next century. Even when several Merovingian kings simultaneously ruled their own realms, the kingdom\u2014not unlike the late Roman Empire\u2014was conceived of as a single entity ruled collectively by these several kings (each ruling one section much as the late Roman Empire had been divided between up to four emperors). The death of one or more of these kings could result in the reunification of the whole kingdom under a single ruler. Even when divided under different kings, the kingdom maintained unity and conquered Burgundy in 534.\nUpon Clovis's death in 511, the Merovingian kingdom included all of Gaul except Burgundy and all of Germania magna except Saxony. After the fall of the Ostrogoths, the Franks also conquered Provence. After this their borders with Italy (ruled by the Lombards since 568) and Visigothic Septimania remained fairly stable.\nDivision of the kingdom.\nInternally, the kingdom was divided among Clovis's sons and later among his grandsons and frequently saw war between the different kings, who allied amongst themselves and against one another. The death of one king created conflict between the surviving brothers and the deceased's sons, with differing outcomes. Later, conflicts were intensified by the personal feud around Brunhilda. However, yearly warfare often did not constitute general devastation but took on an almost ritual character, with established 'rules' and norms.\nReunification of the kingdom.\nEventually, Clotaire II in 613 reunited the entire Frankish realm under one ruler.\nThe frequent wars had weakened royal power, while the aristocracy had made great gains and procured enormous concessions from the kings in return for their support. These concessions saw the very considerable power of the king parcelled out and retained by leading \"comites\" and \"duces\" (counts and dukes). Very little is in fact known about the course of the 7th century due to a scarcity of sources, but Merovingians remained in power until the 8th century.\nWeakening of the kingdom.\nClotaire's son Dagobert I (died 639), who sent troops to Spain and pagan Slavic territories in the east, is commonly seen as the last powerful Merovingian King. Later kings are known as \"rois fain\u00e9ants\" (\"do-nothing kings\"), despite the fact that only the last two kings did nothing. The kings, even strong-willed men like Dagobert II and Chilperic II, were not the main agents of political conflicts, leaving this role to their mayors of the palace, who increasingly substituted their own interest for their king's. Many kings came to the throne at a young age and died in the prime of life, weakening royal power further.\nReturn to power.\nThe conflict between mayors was ended when the Austrasians under Pepin the Middle triumphed in 687 in the Battle of Tertry. After this, Pepin, though not a king, was the political ruler of the Frankish kingdom and left this position as a heritage to his sons. It was now the sons of the mayor that divided the realm among each other under the rule of a single king.\nAfter Pepin's long rule, his son Charles Martel assumed power, fighting against nobles and his own stepmother. His reputation for ruthlessness further undermined the king's position. Under Charles Martel's leadership, the Franks defeated the Moors at the Battle of Tours in 732. After the victory of 718 of the Bulgarian Khan Tervel and the Emperor of Byzantium Leo III the Isaurian over the Arabs led by Maslama ibn Abd al-Malik prevented the attempts of Islam to expand into eastern Europe, the victory of Charles Martel at Tours limited its expansion onto the west of the European continent. During the last years of his life, he even ruled without a king, though he did not assume royal dignity. His sons Carloman and Pepin again appointed a Merovingian figurehead (Childeric III) to stem rebellion on the kingdom's periphery. However, in 751, Pepin finally displaced the last Merovingian and, with the support of the nobility and the blessing of Pope Zachary, became one of the Frankish kings.\nGovernment.\nThe Merovingian king redistributed conquered wealth among his followers, both material wealth and the land (including its indentured peasantry), though these powers were not absolute. As Rouche points out, \"When he died his property was divided equally among his heirs as though it were private property: the kingdom was a form of patrimony.\" Some scholars have attributed this to the Merovingians' lacking a sense of \"res publica\", but other historians have criticized this view as an oversimplification.\nThe kings appointed magnates to be \"comites\" (counts), charging them with defense, administration, and the judgment of disputes. This happened against the backdrop of a newly isolated Europe without its Roman systems of taxation and bureaucracy, the Franks having taken over administration as they gradually penetrated into the thoroughly Romanised west and south of Gaul. By the time of Dagobert I, governmental documents were recognizably Roman, it is by then written in Latin on imported papyrus similar to Roman bureaucratic norms and where it also made use of the old legal formulae. While laymen made up most of the administrators, there was a gradual shift to a clerical presence from the reign of Clotaire II.\nThe counts had to provide armies, enlisting their \"milites\" and endowing them with land in return. These armies were subject to the king's call for military support. Annual national assemblies of the nobles and their armed retainers decided major policies of war making. The army also acclaimed new kings by raising them on its shields continuing an ancient practice that made the king leader of the warrior-band. Furthermore, the king was expected to support himself with the products of his private domain (royal demesne), which was called the \"fisc\". This system developed in time into feudalism, and expectations of royal self-sufficiency lasted until the Hundred Years' War.\nTrade declined with the fall of the Roman Empire, and agricultural estates were mostly self-sufficient. The remaining international trade was dominated by Middle Eastern merchants, often Jewish Radhanites.\nLaw.\nMerovingian law was not universal law equally applicable to all; it was applied to each man according to his origin: Ripuarian Franks were subject to their own , codified at a late date, while the so-called (Salic Law) of the Salian clans, first tentatively codified in 511 was invoked under medieval exigencies as late as the Valois era. In this the Franks lagged behind the Burgundians and the Visigoths, that they had no universal Roman-based law. In Merovingian times, law was handled by officials called \"rachimburgs\", who memorised the set of legal precedents which formed the basis for their society's laws, for Merovingian society did not allow the concept of creating \"new\" law, only of maintaining tradition. Nor did its Germanic traditions offer any code of civil law required of urbanised society, such as Justinian I caused to be assembled and promulgated in the Byzantine Empire. The few surviving Merovingian edicts are almost entirely concerned with settling divisions of estates among heirs.\nCoinage.\nByzantine coinage was in use in Francia before Theudebert I began minting his own money at the start of his reign. He was the first to issue distinctly Merovingian coinage. On gold coins struck in his royal workshop, Theudebert is shown in the pearl-studded regalia of the Byzantine emperor; Childebert I is shown in profile in the ancient style, wearing a toga and a diadem. The solidus and triens were minted in Francia between 534 and 679. The denarius (or denier) appeared later, in the name of Childeric II and various non-royals around 673\u2013675. A Carolingian denarius replaced the Merovingian one, and the Frisian penning, in Gaul from 755 to the 11th century.\nMerovingian coins are on display at the Monnaie de Paris in Paris; there are Merovingian gold coins at the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale, Cabinet des M\u00e9dailles.\nReligion.\nChristianity was introduced to the Franks by their contact with Gallo-Romanic culture and later further spread by monks. The most famous of these missionaries is St. Columbanus (d 615), an Irish monk. Merovingian kings and queens used the newly forming ecclesiastical power structure to their advantage. Monasteries and episcopal seats were shrewdly awarded to elites who supported the dynasty. Extensive parcels of land were donated to monasteries to exempt those lands from royal taxation and to preserve them within the family. The family maintained dominance over the monastery by appointing family members as abbots. Extra sons and daughters who could not be married off were sent to monasteries so that they would not threaten the inheritance of older Merovingian children. This pragmatic use of monasteries ensured close ties between elites and monastic properties.\nNumerous Merovingians who served as bishops and abbots, or who generously funded abbeys and monasteries, were rewarded with sainthood. The outstanding handful of Frankish saints who were not of the Merovingian kinship nor the family alliances that provided Merovingian counts and dukes, deserve a closer inspection for that fact alone: like Gregory of Tours, they were almost without exception from the Gallo-Roman aristocracy in regions south and west of Merovingian control. The most characteristic form of Merovingian literature is represented by the \"Lives\" of the saints. Merovingian hagiography did not set out to reconstruct a biography in the Roman or the modern sense, but to attract and hold popular devotion by the formulas of elaborate literary exercises, through which the Frankish Church channeled popular piety within orthodox channels, defined the nature of sanctity and retained some control over the posthumous cults that developed spontaneously at burial sites, where the life-force of the saint lingered, to do good for the votary.\nThe \"vitae et miracula\", for impressive miracles were an essential element of Merovingian hagiography, were read aloud on saints' feast days. Many Merovingian saints, and the majority of female saints, were local ones, venerated only within strictly circumscribed regions; their cults were revived in the High Middle Ages, when the population of women in religious orders increased enormously. Judith Oliver noted five Merovingian female saints in the diocese of Li\u00e8ge who appeared in a long list of saints in the late 13th-century Lardanchet psalter\u2013hours. The \"vitae\" of six late Merovingian saints that illustrate the political history of the era have been translated and edited by Paul Fouracre and Richard A. Gerberding, and presented with , to provide some historical context.\nLanguage.\nYitzhak Hen stated that it seems certain that the Gallo-Roman population was far greater than the Frankish population in Merovingian Gaul, especially in regions south of the Seine, with most of the Frankish settlements being located along the Lower and Middle Rhine. The further south in Gaul one traveled, the weaker the Frankish influence became. Hen finds hardly any evidence for Frankish settlements south of the Loire. The absence of Frankish literature sources suggests that the Frankish language was forgotten rather rapidly after the early stage of the dynasty. Hen believes that for Neustria, Burgundy and Aquitaine, Vulgar Latin remained the spoken language in Gaul throughout the Merovingian period and remained so even well in to the Carolingian period. However, Urban T. Holmes estimated that a Germanic language was spoken as a second tongue by public officials in western Austrasia and Neustria as late as the 850s, and that it completely disappeared as a spoken language from these regions only during the 10th century.\nHistoriography and sources.\nA limited number of contemporary sources describe the history of the Merovingian Franks, but those that survive cover the entire period from Clovis's succession to Childeric's deposition. First among chroniclers of the age is the canonised bishop of Tours, Gregory of Tours. His is a primary source for the reigns of the sons of Clotaire II and their descendants until Gregory's own death in 594, but must be read with account of the pro-church point of view of its author.\nThe next major source, far less organised than Gregory's work, is the \"Chronicle of Fredegar\", begun by Fredegar but continued by unknown authors. It covers the period from 584 to 641, though its continuators, under Carolingian patronage, extended it to 768, after the close of the Merovingian era. It is the only primary narrative source for much of its period. The only other major contemporary source is the , an anonymous adaptation of Gregory's work apparently ignorant of Fredegar's chronicle: its author(s) ends with a reference to Theuderic IV's sixth year, which would be 727. It was widely read; though it was undoubtedly a piece of Arnulfing work, and its biases cause it to mislead (for instance, concerning the two decades between the controversies surrounding mayors Grimoald the Elder and Ebroin: 652\u2013673).\nAside from these chronicles, the only surviving reservoirs of historiography are documentary sources (letters, charters, laws, etc.) and hagiography. Clerical men such as Gregory and Sulpitius the Pious were letter-writers, though relatively few letters survive. Edicts, grants, and judicial decisions survive, as well as the famous \"Lex Salica\", mentioned above. From the reign of Clotaire II and Dagobert I survive many examples of the royal position as the supreme justice and final arbiter. There also survive biographies of saints of the period, for instance Saint Eligius and Leodegar, written soon after their subjects' deaths.\nFinally, archaeological evidence cannot be ignored as a source for information, at the very least, on the Frankish mode of life. Among the greatest discoveries of lost objects was the 1653 accidental uncovering of Childeric I's tomb in the church of Saint Brice in Tournai. The grave objects included a golden bull's head and the famous golden insects (perhaps bees, cicadas, aphids, or flies) on which Napoleon modelled his coronation cloak. In 1957, the sepulchre of a Merovingian woman at the time believed to be Clotaire I's second wife, Aregund, was discovered in Saint Denis Basilica in Paris. The funerary clothing and jewellery were reasonably well-preserved, giving us a look into the costume of the time. Beyond these royal individuals, the Merovingian period is associated with the archaeological Reihengr\u00e4ber culture.\nIn popular culture.\nThe Merovingians play a prominent role in French historiography and national identity, although their importance was partly overshadowed by that of the Gauls during the Third Republic. Charles de Gaulle is on record as stating his opinion that \"For me, the history of France begins with Clovis, elected as king of France by the tribe of the Franks, who gave their name to France. Before Clovis, we have Gallo-Roman and Gaulish prehistory. The decisive element, for me, is that Clovis was the first king to have been baptized a Christian. My country is a Christian country and I reckon the history of France beginning with the accession of a Christian king who bore the name of the Franks\".\nThe Merovingians feature in the novel \"In Search of Lost Time\" by Marcel Proust: \"The Merovingians are important to Proust because, as the oldest French dynasty, they are the most romantic and their descendants the most aristocratic.\" The word \"Merovingian\" is used as an adjective at least five times in \"The Way By Swann\u2019s\".\nHeimito von Doderer describes a fictitious Merowingian noble family in the 20th century in his grotesque 1962 novel \"The Merowingians or The Total Family\".\nThe Merovingians are featured in the book \"The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail\" (1982) where they are depicted as descendants of Jesus, inspired by the \"Priory of Sion\" story developed by Pierre Plantard in the 1960s. Plantard playfully sold the story as non-fiction, giving rise to a number of works of pseudohistory among which \"The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail\" was the most successful. The \"Priory of Sion\" material has given rise to later works in popular fiction, notably \"The Da Vinci Code\" (2003), which mentions the Merovingians in chapter 60.\nThe title of \"Merovingian\" (also known as \"the Frenchman\") is used as the name for a fictional character and a supporting antagonist of the films \"The Matrix Reloaded\", \"The Matrix Revolutions\" and \"The Matrix Resurrections\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The name is M\u00f3r-r\u00edoghan in modern Irish before the spelling reform, and it has been translated as \"great queen\" or \"phantom queen\".\nThe Morr\u00edgan is mainly associated with war and fate, especially with foretelling doom, death, or victory in battle. In this role she often appears as a crow, the \"badb\". She incites warriors to battle and can help bring about victory over their enemies. The Morr\u00edgan encourages warriors to do brave deeds, strikes fear into their enemies, and is portrayed washing the bloodstained clothes of those fated to die. She is most frequently seen as a goddess of battle and war and has also been seen as a manifestation of the earth- and sovereignty-goddess, chiefly representing the goddess's role as guardian of the territory and its people.\nThe Morr\u00edgan is often described as a trio of individuals, all sisters, called \"the three Morr\u00edgna\". In mythology membership of the triad is given as Badb, Macha, and the Morrigan, who may be named Anu. It is believed that these were all names for the same goddess. In modern sources Nemain may also be named as one of the three Morrigan along with Badb and Macha, although her inclusion is unclear. The three Morr\u00edgna are also named as sisters of the three land goddesses \u00c9riu, Banba, and F\u00f3dla. The Morr\u00edgan is described as the envious wife of The Dagda and a shape-shifting goddess, while Badb and Nemain are said to be the wives of Neit. She is associated with the banshee of later folklore.\nEtymology.\nThere is some disagreement over the meaning of the Morr\u00edgan's name. \"Mor\" may derive from an Indo-European root connoting terror, monstrousness, cognate with the Old English \"maere\" (which survives in the modern English word \"nightmare\") and the Scandinavian \"mara\" and the Old East Slavic \"mara\" (\"nightmare\"); while \"r\u00edgan\" translates as \"queen\". This etymological sequence can be reconstructed in the Proto-Celtic language as *\"Moro-r\u012bgan\u012b-s\". Accordingly, \"Morr\u00edgan\" is often translated as \"Phantom Queen\". This is the derivation generally favoured in current scholarship.\nIn the Middle Irish period, the name is often spelled \"M\u00f3rr\u00edgan\" with a lengthening diacritic over the \"o\", seemingly intended to mean \"Great Queen\" (Old Irish \"m\u00f3r\", \"great\"; this would derive from a hypothetical Proto-Celtic *\"M\u0101ra R\u012bgan\u012b-s\"). Whitley Stokes believed this latter spelling was due to a false etymology popular at the time. There have also been attempts by modern writers to link the Morr\u00edgan with the Welsh literary figure Morgan le Fay from the Matter of Britain, in whose name \"mor\" may derive from the Welsh word for \"sea\", but the names are derived from different cultures and branches of the Celtic linguistic tree.\nSources.\nGlosses and glossaries.\nThe earliest sources for the Morr\u00edgan are glosses in Latin manuscripts and glossaries (collections of glosses). The 8th century \"O'Mulconry's Glossary\" says that Macha is one of the three \"morr\u00edgna\". In a 9th-century manuscript containing the Vulgate version of the Book of Isaiah, the word \"Lamia\" is used to translate the Hebrew \"Lilith\". A gloss explains this \"night hag\" as \"a monster in female form, that is, a \"morr\u00edgan\".\" \"Cormac's Glossary\" (also 9th century), and a gloss in the later manuscript H.3.18, both explain the plural word \"gudemain\" (\"spectres\") with the plural form \"morr\u00edgna\".\nUlster Cycle.\nThe Morr\u00edgan's earliest narrative appearances, in which she is depicted as an individual, are in stories of the Ulster Cycle, where she has an ambiguous relationship with the hero C\u00fa Chulainn. In the \"T\u00e1in B\u00f3 Regamna\" (\"The Cattle Raid of Regamain\"), C\u00fa Chulainn encounters the Morr\u00edgan, but does not recognise her, as she drives a heifer from his territory. In response to this perceived challenge, and his ignorance of her role as a sovereignty figure, he insults her. But before he can attack her she becomes a black bird on a nearby branch. C\u00fa Chulainn now knows who she is, and tells her that had he known before, they would not have parted in enmity. She notes that whatever he had done would have brought him ill luck. To his response that she cannot harm him, she delivers a series of warnings, foretelling a coming battle in which he will be killed. She tells him, \"It is at the guarding of thy death that I am; and I shall be.\"\nIn the \"T\u00e1in B\u00f3 C\u00faailnge\" (\"The Cattle Raid of Cooley\"), Queen Medb of Connacht launches an invasion of Ulster to steal the bull Donn Cuailnge; the Morr\u00edgan, like Alecto of the Greek Furies, appears to the bull in the form of a crow and warns him to flee. C\u00fa Chulainn defends Ulster by fighting a series of single combats at fords against Medb's champions. In between combats, the Morr\u00edgan appears to him as a young woman and offers him her love and her aid in the battle, but he rejects her offer. In response, she intervenes in his next combat, first in the form of an eel who trips him, then as a wolf who stampedes cattle across the ford, and finally as a white, red-eared heifer leading the stampede, just as she had warned in their previous encounter. However, C\u00fa Chulainn wounds her in each form and defeats his opponent despite her interference. Later, she appears to him as an old woman bearing the same three wounds that her animal forms had sustained, milking a cow. She gives C\u00fa Chulainn three drinks of milk. He blesses her with each drink, and her wounds are healed. He regrets blessing her for the three drinks of milk, which is apparent in the exchange between the Morr\u00edgan and C\u00fa Chulainn: \"She gave him milk from the third teat, and her leg was healed. 'You told me once,' she said,'that you would never heal me.' 'Had I known it was you,' said C\u00fa Chulainn, 'I never would have.'\" As the armies gather for the final battle, she prophesies the bloodshed to come.\nIn one version of C\u00fa Chulainn's death-tale, as C\u00fa Chulainn rides to meet his enemies, he encounters the Morr\u00edgan as a hag washing his bloody armour in a ford, an omen of his death. Later in the story, mortally wounded, C\u00fa Chulainn ties himself to a standing stone with his own entrails so he can die upright, and it is only when a crow lands on his shoulder that his enemies believe he is dead.\nMythological Cycle.\nThe Morr\u00edgan also appears in texts of the Mythological Cycle. In the 12th-century poetic compilation \"Lebor Gab\u00e1la \u00c9renn\" (\"The Book of the Taking of Ireland\"), she is listed among the Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann as one of the daughters of Ernmas, granddaughter of Nuada.\nThe first three daughters of Ernmas are given as \u00c9riu, Banba, and F\u00f3dla. Their names are synonyms for \"Ireland\", and they were respectively married to Mac Gr\u00e9ine, Mac Cuill, and Mac C\u00e9cht, the last three Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann kings of Ireland. Associated with the land and kingship, they probably represent a triple goddess of sovereignty. Next come Ernmas' other three daughters: Badb, Macha, and the Morr\u00edgan. A quatrain describes the three as wealthy, \"springs of craftiness\", and \"sources of bitter fighting\". The Morr\u00edgu's name is also said to be Anand. According to Geoffrey Keating's 17th-century \"History of Ireland\", \u00c9riu, Banba, and F\u00f3dla worshipped Badb, Macha, and the Morr\u00edgan respectively.\nThe Morr\u00edgan also appears in the \"Cath Maige Tuired\" (\"The Battle of Magh Tuireadh\"). On Samhain, she keeps a tryst with the Dagda before the battle against the Fomorians. When he meets her, she is washing herself, standing with one foot on either side of the river Unius, near Riverstown, Co. Sligo. In some sources, she is believed to have created the river. After they have sex, the Morr\u00edgan promises to summon the magicians of Ireland to cast spells on behalf of the Tuatha D\u00e9, and to destroy Indech, the Fomorian king, taking from him \"the blood of his heart and the kidneys of his valour.\" Later, we are told, she would bring two handfuls of his blood and deposit them in the same river (however, we are also told later in the text that Indech was killed by Ogma).\nAs battle is about to be joined, the Tuatha D\u00e9 leader, Lug, asks each what power they bring to the battle. The Morr\u00edgan's reply is difficult to interpret, but involves pursuing, destroying and subduing. When she comes to the battlefield, she chants a poem, and immediately the battle breaks and the Fomorians are driven into the sea. After the battle, she chants another poem celebrating the victory and prophesying the end of the world.\nIn another story, she lures away the bull of a woman named Odras. Odras then follows the Morr\u00edgan to the Otherworld, via the cave of Cruachan, which is said to be her \"fit abode.\" When Odras falls asleep, the Morr\u00edgan turns her into a pool of water that feeds into the River Shannon. In this story, the Morrigan is called the Dagda's envious queen, fierce of mood. She is also called a \"shape-shifter\" and a cunning raven caller whose pleasure was in mustered hosts.\nNature and role.\nThe Morr\u00edgan is often considered a triple goddess, but this triple nature is ambiguous and inconsistent. These triple appearances are partially due to the Celtic significance of threeness. Sometimes she appears as one of three sisters, the daughters of Ernmas: Morr\u00edgan, Badb and Macha. Sometimes the trinity consists of Badb, Macha and Anand, collectively known as the \"Morr\u00edgna\". Occasionally, Nemain or Fea appear in the various combinations. However, the Morr\u00edgan can also appear alone, and her name is sometimes used interchangeably with Badb.\nThe Morr\u00edgan is mainly associated with war and fate, and is often interpreted as a \"war goddess\". W. M. Hennessy's \"The Ancient Irish Goddess of War\", written in 1870, was influential in establishing this interpretation. She is said to derive pleasure from mustered hosts. Her role often involves premonitions of a particular warrior's violent death, suggesting a link with the banshee of later folklore. This connection is further noted by Patricia Lysaght: \"In certain areas of Ireland this supernatural being is, in addition to the name banshee, also called the \"badhb\"\". Her role was to not only be a symbol of imminent death, but to also influence the outcome of war. Most often, she did this by appearing as a crow flying overhead, and would either inspire fear or courage in the hearts of the warriors. In some cases, she is written to have appeared in visions to those who are destined to die in battle as washing their bloody armor. In this specific role, she is also given the role of foretelling imminent death with a particular emphasis on the individual. There are also a few rare accounts where she would join in the battle itself as a warrior and show her favouritism in a more direct manner.\nThe Morr\u00edgan is also associated with the land and animals, particularly livestock. M\u00e1ire Herbert argues that \"war \"per se\" is not a primary aspect of the role of the goddess.\" Herbert suggests that \"her activities have a tutelary character. She oversees the land, its stock and its society. Her shape-shifting is an expression of her affinity with the whole living universe.\" Patricia Lysaght notes that the \"Cath Maige Tuired\" depicts the Morr\u00edgan as \"a protectress of her people's interests\" and associates her with both war and fertility. According to Proinsias Mac Cana, the goddess in Ireland is \"primarily concerned with the prosperity of the land: its fertility, its animal life, and (when it is conceived as a political unit) its security against external forces.\" Likewise, Maria Tymoczko writes, \"The welfare and fertility of a people depend on their security against external aggression,\" and notes that \"warlike action can thus have a protective aspect.\" It is therefore suggested that the Morr\u00edgan is a manifestation of the earth- and sovereignty-goddess, chiefly representing the goddess' role as guardian of the territory and its people. She can be interpreted as providing political or military aid, or protection to the king\u2014acting as a goddess of sovereignty, not necessarily of war.\nIt has also been suggested that she was closely linked to the \"fianna\", and that these groups may have been in some way dedicated to her. These were \"bands of youthful warrior-hunters, living on the borders of civilized society and indulging in lawless activities for a time before inheriting property and taking their places as members of settled, landed communities.\" If true, her worship may have resembled that of Perchta groups in Germanic areas.\nThere is a burnt mound site in County Tipperary known as \"Fulacht na M\u00f3r R\u00edoghna\" (\"cooking pit of the M\u00f3rr\u00edgan\"). The fulachta\u00ed sites are found in wild areas, and are usually associated with outsiders such as the fianna, as well as with the hunting of deer. There may be a link with the three mythical hags who cook the meal of dogflesh that brings the hero C\u00fa Chulainn to his doom. The \"D\u00e1 Ch\u00edch na Morr\u00edgna\" (\"two breasts of the M\u00f3rr\u00edgan\"), a pair of hills near Br\u00fa na B\u00f3inne in County Meath, suggest to some a role as a tutelary goddess, comparable to Anu, who has her own hills, \"D\u00e1 Ch\u00edch Anann\" (\"the breasts of Anu\") in County Kerry. Other goddesses known to have similar hills are \u00c1ine and Grian of County Limerick who, in addition to a tutelary function, also have solar attributes.\nArthurian legend.\nThere have been attempts by some modern researchers and authors of fiction to link the Morr\u00edgan with the character of Morgan, the latter often being depicted in the legend as a fairy or otherwise supernatural sister of King Arthur. Morgan first appears in literature in Geoffrey of Monmouth's 12th-century \"Vita Merlini\" as a goddess-like figure in no blood relation to Arthur, whom she takes to her Otherworld style land of Avalon following his mortal wound in a battle. In some Arthurian texts, such as \"Sir Gawain and the Green Knight\", Morgan is portrayed as a hag whose actions set into motion a bloody trail of events that lead the hero into numerous instances of danger. Morgan is also depicted as a seductress, much like the older legends of the Morr\u00edgan, and has numerous lovers whom she might even abduct for this purpose (as in some stories of Lancelot and Ogier the Dane, among others). The character is frequently depicted as wielding power over others to achieve her own purposes, allowing those actions to play out over time, to the benefit or detriment of other characters.\nHowever, while the creators of the literary character of Morgan may have been somewhat inspired by the much older tales of the goddess, the relationship likely ends there. Scholars such as Rosalind Clark hold that the names are unrelated, the Welsh \"Morgan\" (Wales being the original source of the Matter of Britain) being derived from root words associated with the sea, while the Irish \"Morr\u00edgan\" has its roots either in a word for \"terror\" or a word for \"greatness\".\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Marquette's urban area extends south toward the community of Harvey and west toward Negaunee and Ishpeming, at the base of the Huron Mountains.\nMarquette is the home of Northern Michigan University (NMU), a four-year public university. NMU's athletic teams are nicknamed the Wildcats and compete primarily in the NCAA Division II Great Lakes Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (GLIAC). The men's ice hockey team, which competes in the NCAA Division I Central Collegiate Hockey Association (CCHA), won the Division I national championship in 1991.\nHistory.\nThe land around Marquette was known to French missionaries of the early 17th century and the trappers of the early 19th century. The area was originally and predominantly inhabited by the Noquet, Ojibwe, Odawa and Potawatomi, the latter three peoples comprising the Anishinaabe Council of Three Fires. They knew the area as \"Gichi-namebini-ziibing\" (\"The river of giant white suckers\", referring to the Dead River). Development of the area did not begin until 1844, when William Burt and Jacob Houghton (the brother of geologist Douglass Houghton) discovered iron deposits near Teal Lake west of Marquette. In 1845, Jackson Mining Company, the first organized mining company in the region, was formed.\nThe village of Marquette began on September 14, 1849, with the formation of a second iron concern, the Marquette Iron Company. Three men participated in organizing the firm: Robert J. Graveraet, who had prospected the region for ore; Edward Clark, agent for Waterman A. Fisher of Worcester, Massachusetts, who financed the company, and Amos Rogers Harlow. The village was at first called New Worcester, with Harlow as the first postmaster. On August 21, 1850, the name was changed to honor Jacques Marquette, the French Jesuit missionary who had explored the region. A second post office, named Carp River, was opened on October 13, 1851, by Peter White, who had gone there with Graveraet at age 18. Harlow closed his post office in August 1852. The Marquette Iron Company failed, while its successor, the Cleveland Iron Mining Company, flourished and had the village platted in 1854. The plat was recorded by Peter White. White's office was renamed as Marquette in April 1856, and the village was incorporated in 1859. It was incorporated as a city in 1871.\nDuring the 1850s, Marquette was linked by rail to numerous mines and became the leading shipping center of the Upper Peninsula. The first ore pocket dock, designed by an early town leader, John Burt, was built by the Cleveland Iron Mining Company in 1859. By 1862, the city had a population of over 1,600 and a soaring economy.\nIn the late 19th century, during the height of iron mining, Marquette became nationally known as a summer haven. Visitors brought in by Great Lakes passenger steamships filled the city's hotels and resorts.\nSouth of the city, K. I. Sawyer Air Force Base was an important Air Force installation during the Cold War, host to B-52H bombers and KC-135 tankers of the Strategic Air Command, as well as a fighter interceptor squadron. The base closed in September 1995, and is now the county's Marquette Sawyer Regional Airport.\nMarquette continues to be a shipping port for hematite ores and, today, enriched iron ore pellets, from nearby mines and pelletizing plants. About 7.9 million gross tons of pelletized iron ore passed through Marquette's Presque Isle Harbor in 2005.\nThe Roman Catholic Bishop Frederic Baraga is buried at St. Peter Cathedral, which is the center for the Diocese of Marquette.\nLakeview Arena, an ice hockey rink in Marquette, won the Kraft Hockeyville USA contest on April 30, 2016. The arena received $150,000 in upgrades, and hosted the Buffalo Sabres and Carolina Hurricanes on October 4, 2016, in a preseason NHL contest. Buffalo won the game 2\u20130.\nPostal and philatelic history.\nIn addition to the Marquette #1 Post Office, there is the \"Northern Michigan University Bookstore Contract Station #384\".\nThe first day of issue of a postal card showing Bishop Frederic Baraga took place in Marquette on June 29, 1984, and that of the Wonders of America Lake Superior stamp on May 27, 2006.\nGeography and climate.\nGeography.\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.\nThe city includes several small islands (principally Middle Island, Gull Island, Lover's Island, Presque Isle Pt. Rocks, White Rocks, Ripley Rock, and Picnic Rocks) in Lake Superior. The Marquette Underwater Preserve lies immediately offshore.\nMarquette Mountain, used for skiing in the winter and lift-serviced downhill mountain biking in the summer, is located in the city, as is most of the land of Marquette Branch Prison of the Michigan Department of Corrections. The town of Trowbridge Park (under Marquette Township), is located to the west, Sands Township to the south, and Marquette Township to the northwest of the city.\nClimate.\nThe climate is a hemiboreal humid continental (K\u00f6ppen: \"Dfb\") with four distinct seasons that are strongly moderated by Lake Superior and is located in Plant Hardiness zone 5b. Narrative below is based on chart below, reflecting 1991-2020 climate normals. Winters are long and cold with a January average of . Winter temperatures are slightly warmer than inland locations at a similar latitude due to the release of the heat stored by the lake, which moderates the climate. On average, there are 11.6\u00a0days annually where the minimum temperature reaches and 73\u00a0days with a maximum at or below freezing, including a majority of days during meteorological winter (December thru February).\nBeing located in the snowbelt region, Marquette receives a significant amount of snowfall during the winter months, mostly from lake-effect snow. Because Lake Superior rarely freezes over completely, this enables lake effect snow to persist throughout winter, making Marquette the third snowiest location in the contiguous United States as reported by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration with an average annual snowfall of . The snow depth in winter usually exceeds . Marquette is the city with the deepest snow depths with a population of more than 20,000 in the United States (and one of the largest in North America outside the western Cordillera or eastern Canada), as temperatures remain low throughout the winter and cold, dry air is intercepted by the Great Lakes.\nThe warmest months, July and August, each average , showing somewhat of a seasonal lag, with August averaging slightly warmer than July. The surrounding lake cools summertime temperatures and as a result, temperatures above are rare, with only 3.4 days per year. Spring and fall are transitional seasons that are generally mild though highly variable due to the alternation of air masses moving quickly. Spring is usually cooler than fall because the surrounding lake is slower to warm than the land, while in fall the lake releases heat, warming the area.\nMarquette receives of precipitation annually, which is fairly evenly distributed throughout the year, though September and October are the wettest months with February and March being the driest. The average window for morning freezes is October 15 thru May 7. The highest temperature ever recorded in Marquette was on July 15, 1901, and the lowest was on February 8, 1861. Marquette receives an average of 2,294 hours of sunshine per year or 51 percent of possible sunshine, ranging from a low of 29 percent in December to a high of 68 percent in July.\nThe City of Marquette has received national attention for its measures to adapt to climate change, such as coastline restoration and moving portions of Lakeshore Boulevard which are flooded by Lake Superior inland. Property owners are required to maintain \u201criparian buffers\u201d of native plants along waterways. A county task force has created a guidebook in cooperation with the University of Michigan for landscaping which can reduce the habitat for disease-bearing ticks.\u00a0A federally funded stormwater drain project will route runoff which flows into Lake Superior into restored wetlands. At the time of a 2014 NOAA climate study, climate change was expected to lead to rising temperatures, a longer growing season, and greater precipitation in Marquette.\n&lt;section begin=\"weather box\" /&gt;&lt;section end=\"weather box\" /&gt;\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"US Census population/styles.css\"/&gt;\n2020 census.\nAs of the 2020 census, there were 20,629 people, 8,163 households, and 3,651 families residing in the city.

Five breweries were extant in the city (as of 2019[ [update]]).\nMarquette's port was the 140th largest in the United States in 2015, ranked by tonnage.\nRecreation and tourism.\nRecreational facilities.\nPresque Isle Park is located on the north side of the city. The largely untouched, forested landscape of the park was the result of a 1891 visit from landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted, who refused to develop a plan for it due to his belief that it \"should not be marred by the intrusion of artificial objects.\" Amenities include a wooden band shell for concerts, a park pavilion, a gazebo, a marina, a concession stand, picnic tables, barbecue pits, walking/skiing trails, playground facilities, and Moosewood Nature Center. The city has two beaches, South Beach Park and McCarty's Cove. McCarty's Cove is flanked by a red U.S. Coast Guard Station lighthouse on its south shore. Both beaches have picnic areas, grills, children's playgrounds and lifeguard stands. Other parks include Tourist Park, Founder's Landing, LaBonte Park, Mattson Lower Harbor Park, Park Cemetery, Shiras Park, Williams Park, Harlow Park, Pocket Park, Spring Street Park and Father Marquette Park.\nThere are also numerous other recreational facilities located within the city. Lakeview Arena is best known for its use as an ice hockey facility, but it also hosts a number of public events. A skateboard park is located just outside the arena and open during the summer. Lakeview Arena was home to the Marquette Electricians and Marquette Senior High School's Redmen hockey team. In 1974, the arena replaced the historic Palestra, which had been located a few blocks away. Gerard Haley Memorial Baseball field home of the Marquette Blues and Reds is located in the north side along with numerous little league and softball fields. Marquette is home to the largest wooden dome in the world, the Superior Dome\u2014unofficially but affectionately known as the YooperDome. During the football season, the Dome is used primarily for football on its newly renovated AstroTurf field. The turf was installed in July 2009. Northern Michigan University holds its home football games in the Dome, as does the Michigan High School Athletic Association with the Upper Peninsula's high school football playoffs. The dome also hosts numerous private and public events that draw in thousands from around the region. The Marquette Golf Club has brought international recognition to the area for its unique and dramatic Greywalls course, opened in 2005. The course features several panoramic views of Lake Superior and winds its way through rocky outcroppings, heaving fairways and a rolling valley, yet is located less than from the downtown area.\nThe city is also known for fishing for deep water lake trout, whitefish, salmon and brown trout.\nMarquette has an extensive network of biking and walking paths. The city has been gradually expanding the paths and has been promoting itself as a walkable and livable community. Cross Country ski trails are also located at Presque Isle Park and the Fit Strip.\nCamping facilities are located at Tourist Park.\nThe combination of hilly terrain (a vertical difference from top to bottom) and large area snow falls makes snowboarding and downhill skiing a reality on the edge of town.\nFestivals and events.\nLive theatrical productions are also provided through Northern Michigan University's Forest Roberts Theatre and Black Box Theatre, Marquette's Graveraet School Kaufman Auditorium and Lake Superior Theatre, a semi-professional summer stock theatre.\nTransportation.\nMarquette is served by American Eagle and Delta Connection out of Marquette Sawyer Regional Airport (MQT, KSAW) with daily flights to Chicago and Detroit. The airport is located south of downtown Marquette.\nThe city is served by a public transit system known as MarqTran, which runs buses through the city and to nearby places such as Marquette Sawyer Regional Airport and Ishpeming. The system operates out of a transit center in the adjacent Marquette Township in addition to a small transfer station in downtown. In addition, Indian Trails bus lines operates daily intercity bus service between Hancock and Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The line operates a stop at MarqTran's transit center.\nMarquette has limited freight rail service by the Lake Superior and Ishpeming Railroad (LS&amp;I). The Canadian National Railway also goes through nearby Negaunee. The LS&amp;I serves the Upper Harbor Ore Dock, which loads iron ore pellets from nearby mining operations onto lake freighters for shipment throughout the Great Lakes.\nThree of MDOT's state highways serve Marquette as did a former business route for US\u00a041 and a former state highway.\nEducation.\nPublic schools.\nThe City of Marquette is served by the Marquette Area Public Schools. The district is the largest school district in the Upper Peninsula and Northern Wisconsin, with about 3,100 students and 420 faculty and Staff.\nMedia.\nMultiple media outlets provide local coverage of the Marquette area.\nNotable people.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nSister cities.\nMarquette has two sister cities.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It borrowed many features from ALGOL 68 but was designed for systems programming (machine-oriented programming), with a subset of operations being reserved for higher-level usage.\nAn unusual feature of its syntax was that expressions were constructed using the conventional infix operators, but all of them had the same precedence and evaluation went from left to right unless there were brackets. Assignment had the destination on the right and assignment was considered just another operator.\nSimilar to C, several language features appear to have existed to allow producing reasonably well optimised code, despite a quite primitive code generator in the compiler. These included operators similar to the codice_1 \"et alter\" in C and explicit register declarations for variables.\nNotable features:\nCompilers were made for Kongsberg V\u00e5penfabrikk's SM-4 and Norsk Data Nord-10/ND-100 mini-computers. The original Mary compiler was written in NU ALGOL, ran on the Univac-1100 series and was used to bootstrap a native compiler for ND-100/Sintran-III. RUNIT implemented a CHILL compiler written in Mary which ran on ND-100 and had Intel 8086 and 80286 targets. When this compiler was ported to the VAX platform, a common backend for Mary and CHILL was implemented. Later, backends for i386 and SPARC were available. Since the Mary compiler was implemented in Mary, it was possible to run the compiler on all these platforms. An improved version, Mary/2, was developed using a new compiler in the United States.\nMary is no longer maintained.\nExample.\n BEGIN\n INT i := 10; %% Variable with initial value.\n REF INT ri := i; %% Pointer initialized to point to i.\n INT j := 11;\n j :- REF INT =: ri; %% Type conversion and assignment\n %% ri now points to j.\n i =: (ri :- VAL REF INT); \n %% Assignment and type conversion\n %% ri points to j so j is changed.\n IF j &gt; 10 %% Conditional statement with result\n THEN %% used inside an arithmetic expression.\n 1\n ELSE\n 2\n FI + j =: j;\n END\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;This article is based on material taken from the \"Free On-line Dictionary of Computing\" prior to 1 November 2008 and incorporated under the \"relicensing\" terms of the GFDL, version 1.3 or later.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "20341", "revid": "50868951", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20341", "title": "Mountaineering", "text": "Activity involving ascending mountains\nMountaineering, mountain climbing, or alpinism is a set of outdoor activities that involves ascending mountains. Mountaineering-related activities include traditional outdoor climbing, skiing, and traversing via ferratas that have become sports in their own right. Indoor climbing, sport climbing, and bouldering are also considered variants of mountaineering by some, but are part of a wide group of mountain sports.\nUnlike most sports, mountaineering lacks widely applied formal rules, regulations, and governance; mountaineers adhere to a large variety of techniques and philosophies (including grading and guidebooks) when climbing mountains. Numerous local alpine clubs support mountaineers by hosting resources and social activities. A federation of alpine clubs, the International Climbing and Mountaineering Federation (UIAA), is the International Olympic Committee-recognized world organization for mountaineering and climbing. The consequences of mountaineering on the natural environment can be seen in terms of individual components of the environment (land relief, soil, vegetation, fauna, and landscape) and the location/zone of mountaineering activity (hiking, trekking, or climbing zone). Mountaineering impacts communities on economic, political, social, and cultural levels, often leading to changes in people's worldviews influenced by globalization, specifically foreign cultures and lifestyles.\nHistory.\nEarly mountaineering.\nHumans have been present in mountains since prehistory. The remains of \u00d6tzi, who lived in the 4th millennium BC, were found in a glacier in the \u00d6tztal Alps. However, the highest mountains were rarely visited early on, and were often associated with supernatural or religious concepts. Nonetheless, there are many documented examples of people climbing mountains prior to the formal development of the sport in the 19th century, although many of these stories are sometimes considered fictional or legendary. A rare medieval example of mountaineering is the 1100 AD ascent of the Untersberg.\nThe famous poet Petrarch describes his 26 April 1336 ascent of Mount Ventoux () in one of his \"epistolae familiares\", claiming to be inspired by Philip V of Macedon's ascent of Mount Haemo.\nFor most of antiquity, climbing mountains was a practical or symbolic activity, usually undertaken for economic, political, or religious purposes. A commonly cited example is the 1492 ascent of Mont Aiguille () by Antoine de Ville, a French military officer and lord of Domjulien and Beaupr\u00e9. Because ropes, ladders and iron hooks were used, and because it was the first climb of any technical difficulty to be officially verified, this ascent is widely recognized as being the birth of mountaineering.\nIn the Andes, around the late 1400s and early 1500s, many ascents were made of extremely high peaks by the Incas and their subjects. The highest they are known for certain to have climbed is 6739 m at the summit of Volcan Llullaillaco.\nConrad Gessner, A mid-16th Century physician, botanist and naturalist from Switzerland, is widely recognized as being the first person to hike and climb for sheer pleasure.\nThe Enlightenment and the Golden Age of Alpinism.\nThe Age of Enlightenment and the Romantic era marked a change of attitudes towards high mountains. In 1757, Swiss scientist Horace-B\u00e9n\u00e9dict de Saussure made the first of several unsuccessful attempts on Mont Blanc in France. He then offered a reward to anyone who could climb the mountain, which was claimed in 1786 by Jacques Balmat and Michel-Gabriel Paccard. The climb is usually considered an epochal event in the history of mountaineering, a symbolic mark of the birth of the sport.\nBy the early 19th century, many of the alpine peaks were reached, including the Grossglockner in 1800, the Ortler in 1804, the Jungfrau in 1811, the Finsteraarhorn in 1812, and the Breithorn in 1813. In 1808, Marie Paradis became the first woman to climb Mont Blanc, followed in 1838 by Henriette d'Angeville.\nThe beginning of mountaineering as a sport in the UK is generally dated to the ascent of the Wetterhorn in 1854 by English mountaineer Sir Alfred Wills, who made mountaineering fashionable in Britain. This inaugurated what became known as the Golden Age of Alpinism, with the first mountaineering club \u2013 the Alpine Club \u2013 being founded in 1857.\nOne of the most dramatic events was the spectacular first ascent of the Matterhorn in 1865 by a party led by English illustrator Edward Whymper, in which four of the party members fell to their deaths. By this point, the sport of mountaineering had largely reached its modern form, with a large body of professional guides, equipment, and methodologies.\nIn the early years of the \"golden age\", scientific pursuits were intermixed with the sport, such as by the physicist John Tyndall. In the later years, it shifted to a more competitive orientation as pure sportsmen came to dominate the London-based Alpine Club and alpine mountaineering overall. The first president of the Alpine Club, John Ball, is considered to be the discoverer of the Dolomites, which for decades were the focus of climbers like Paul Grohmann and Angelo Dibona. At that time, the edelweiss also established itself as a symbol of alpinists and mountaineers.\nExpansion around the world.\nIn the 19th century, the focus of mountaineering turned towards mountains beyond the Alps. One of the earliest mountain areas to be explored beyond the Alps in the 19th century were the mountains of Norway\u2014particularly Jotunheimen\u2014where British mountaineers such as William Cecil Slingsby, Harold Raeburn and Howard Priestman were early pioneers. Slingsby's book \"Norway, the Northern Playground\" contributed greatly to the popularization of mountaineering in Norway among the international mountaineering community. Around the turn of the century, a young generation of Norwegian mountaineers such as George Paus, Eilert Sundt and Kristian Tandberg appeared, and later founded Norsk Tindeklub, the third oldest mountaineering association in the world. By the turn of the 20th century, mountaineering had acquired a more international flavour.\nIn 1897, Mount Saint Elias () on the Alaska-Yukon border was submitted by the Duke of the Abruzzi and party. In 1879\u20131880, the exploration of the highest Andes in South America began when English mountaineer Edward Whymper climbed Chimborazo () and explored the mountains of Ecuador. It took until the late 19th century for European explorers to penetrate Africa. Mount Kilimanjaro in Africa was climbed in 1889 by Austrian mountaineer Ludwig Purtscheller and German geologist Hans Meyer, Mount Kenya in 1899 by Halford Mackinder.\nThe last frontier: The Himalayas.\nThe greatest mountain range to be conquered was the Himalayas in South Asia. They had initially been surveyed by the British Empire for military and strategic reasons. In 1892, Sir William Martin Conway explored the Karakoram Himalayas, and climbed a peak of . In 1895, Albert F. Mummery died while attempting Nanga Parbat, while in 1899 Douglas Freshfield took an expedition to the snowy regions of Sikkim.\nIn 1899, 1903, 1906, and 1908, American mountaineer Fanny Bullock Workman (one of the first professional female mountaineers) made ascents in the Himalayas, including one of the Nun Kun peaks (). A number of Gurkha sepoys were trained as expert mountaineers by Charles Granville Bruce, and a good deal of exploration was accomplished by them.\nIn 1902, the Eckenstein\u2013Crowley Expedition, led by English mountaineer Oscar Eckenstein and English occultist Aleister Crowley was the first to attempt to scale K2. They reached before turning back due to weather and other mishaps. Undaunted, in 1905 Crowley led the first expedition to Kangchenjunga, the third highest mountain in the world, in an attempt which Isserman, Angas Weaver and Molenaar describe as \"misguided\" and \"lamentable\" due to Crowley's many failings as an expedition leader.\nEckenstein was also a pioneer in developing new equipment and climbing methods. He started using shorter ice axes that could be used single-handedly, designed the modern crampons, and improved on the nail patterns used for the climbing boots.\nBy the 1950s, all the eight-thousanders but two had been climbed starting with Annapurna in 1950 by Maurice Herzog and Louis Lachenal on the 1950 French Annapurna expedition. The highest of these peaks Mount Everest was climbed in 1953 after the British had made several attempts in the 1920s; the 1922 expedition reached before being aborted on the third summit attempt after an avalanche killed seven porters. The 1924 expedition saw another height record achieved but still failed to reach the summit with confirmation when George Mallory and Andrew Irvine disappeared on the final attempt. The summit was finally reached on 29 May 1953 by Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay from the south side in Nepal.\nJust a few months later, Hermann Buhl made the first ascent of Nanga Parbat (8,125\u00a0m), on the 1953 German\u2013Austrian Nanga Parbat expedition, completing the last 1,300 meters walking alone, self-medicating with pervitin (based on the stimulant methamphetamine used by soldiers during World War II), the vasodilator padutin, and a stimulant tea made from coca leaves. K2 (8,611m), the second-highest peak in the world, was first scaled in 1954 by Lino Lacedelli and Achille Compagnoni. In 1964, the final eight-thousander to be climbed was Shishapangma (8,013m), the lowest of all the 8,000-metre peaks.\nReinhold Messner from the Dolomites mountain range (Italy) was then the first to climb all eight-thousanders up to 1986, in addition to being the first without supplemental oxygen. In 1978 he climbed Mount Everest with Peter Habeler without supplemental oxygen, the first men to do so.\nToday.\nLong the domain of the wealthy elite and their agents, the emergence of the middle-class in the 19th and 20th centuries resulted in mass interest in mountaineering. It became a popular pastime and hobby of many people. Some have come to criticize the sport as becoming too much of a tourist activity. The field has, however, also opened up to Indigenous climbers, such as Cecilia Llusco Ala\u00f1a, a member of the Bolivian cholita climbers, who, like the Himalayan sherpas previously worked as porters, high altitude cooks or guides but who now climb peaks in their own right.\nOrganisation.\nActivities.\nThere are different activities associated with the sport.\nRules and governance.\nMountaineering lacks formal rules \u2013 though appropriately empowered bodies make many pertaining to specific use of mountains and practices on them. In theory, any person may climb a mountain and call themself a mountaineer. In practice, the sport is defined by the safe and necessary use of technical skills in mountainous terrain: in particular, roped climbing and snow travel abilities. A variety of techniques have been developed to help people climb mountains that are widely applied among practitioners of the sport.\nDespite its lack of defined rules and non-competitive nature, certain aspects of mountaineering have much of the trappings of an organized sport, with recognition of specific climbing activities \u2013 including climbing wall-based competition \u2013 by the International Olympic Committee; on a club level, the prominent international sport federation the UIAA counts numerous national alpine clubs as its members, while others, such as The Mountaineers and the French Federation of Mountaineering and Climbing, remain independent.\nThe premier award in mountaineering is the privately granted Piolet d'Or, which has expanded from a single recognition to multiple. While there are many competitions, particularly in toproped climbing wall disciplines, there are no \"official\" world championships or other similar competitions for mountaineering broadly.\nTerrain and techniques.\nMountaineering techniques vary greatly depending on location, season, terrain, and route. Both techniques and hazards vary by terrain, spanning trails, rock, snow, and ice. Mountaineers must possess adequate food, water, information, equipment, stamina, and skill to complete their tasks.\nWalk-up terrain.\nThe term \"walk-up\" or \"trek\" is used to describe terrain in which no technical equipment is needed. To traverse this terrain, mountaineers hike long distances to a base camp or the beginning of rough terrain, either following trails or using navigation techniques to travel cross-country. Hiking may be a strenuous activity, and adequate physical fitness and familiarity with the wilderness is necessary to complete a hike; it is also a prerequisite of success in all aspects of mountaineering.\nRock.\nAlpine rock climbing involves technical skills including the ability to place anchors into the rock to safely ascend a mountain. In some cases, climbers may have to climb multiple pitches of rock to reach the top. Typically, for any one pitch, there is a belayer who is stationary and creates tension on the rope to catch a climber should he or she fall, and a climber who ascends the rock. The first climber, called the \"leader\", will reach a point on the rock and then build an anchor, which will secure subsequent climbers. Anchors could be created by using slings around a tree or boulder, or by using protection devices like cams and nuts.\nOnce anchored, the leader will then belay the climber coming up from below. Once the follower reaches the leader, the leader will often transfer all necessary protection devices (known as a rack) to the follower. The follower then becomes the leader and will ascend the next pitch. This process will continue until the climbers either reach the top, or run into different terrain.\nFor extremely vertical rocks, or to overcome certain logistical challenges, climbers may use aid climbing techniques. This involves the use of equipment, such as ladders, fixed lines, and ascenders to help the climber push themself up the rock.\nIn alpine climbing, it is common for climbers to see routes of mixed terrain. This means climbers may need to move efficiently from climbing glacier, to rock, to ice, back and forth in a number of variations.\nSnow and ice.\nCompacted snow conditions allow mountaineers to progress on foot. Frequently crampons are required to travel efficiently and safely over snow and ice. Crampons attach to the bottom of a mountaineer's boots and provide additional traction on hard snow and ice. For loose snow, crampons are less suitable, and snowshoes or skis may be preferred. Using various techniques from alpine skiing to ascend/descend a mountain is a form of the sport by itself, called ski mountaineering.\nAscending and descending a steep snow slope safely requires the use of an ice axe and different footwork techniques that have been developed over the past century, such as the \"French technique\" and \"German technique\". Teams of climbers may choose to attach everyone together with a rope, to form a rope team. The team may then secure themselves by attaching the rope to anchors. These anchors are sometimes unreliable and include snow stakes or pickets, deadman devices called flukes, or buried equipment or rocks. Bollards, which are simply carved out of consolidated snow or ice, also sometimes serve as anchors. Alternatively, a roped team may choose not to use anchors; instead, all members of the team will prepare to use their ice axes to self-arrest in the event should a team member fall.\nIt is not always wise for climbers to form a rope team, since one falling climber may pull the entire team off the mountain. However, the risks of individual, unprotected travel are often so great that groups have no choice but to form a rope team.\nFor example, when traveling over glaciers, crevasses pose a grave danger to a climber who is not roped in. These giant cracks in the ice are not always visible as snow can be blown and freeze over the top to make a snowbridge. At times snowbridges can be as thin as a few inches and may collapse from people walking over them. Should a climber fall, being protected by a rope greatly reduces the risk of injury or death. The other members of the rope team may proceed with a crevasse rescue to pull the fallen climber from the crevasse.\nFor extremely slippery or steep snow, ice, and mixed rock and ice terrain climbers must use more advanced techniques, called ice climbing or mixed climbing. Specialized tools such as ice screws and ice picks help climbers build anchors and move up the ice, as well as traditional rock climbing equipment for anchoring in mixed terrain. Often, mountaineers climbing steep snow or mixed snowy rock terrain will not use a fixed belay. Instead, each climber on the team will climb at the same time while attached to anchors, in groups of two. This allows for safety should the entire team be taken off their feet which also allows for greater speed than the traditional technique of belaying one climber at a time. This technique is known as \"simul-climbing\" or a \"running belay\" and is sometimes also used on ice, however, the risk of dropping frequently displaced ice on the lower team member(s) limits its usefulness on ice. Traditional belays are also used; in this case, this is sometimes necessary due to ice fall hazard, steepness, or other factors.\nShelter.\nClimbers use a few different forms of shelter depending on the situation and conditions; alpine shelters or arctic shelters. Shelter is a very important aspect of safety for the climber as weather in the mountains may be very unpredictable. Tall mountains may require many days of camping.\nShort trips lasting less than a day generally do not require shelter, although for safety, most mountaineers will carry an emergency shelter, such as a light bivouac sack.\nCamping.\nTypical shelters used for camping include tents and bivouac sacks. The ability of these shelters to provide protection from the elements is dependent on their design. Mountaineers who climb in areas with cold weather or snow and ice will use more heavy-duty shelters than those who climb in more forgiving environments.\nIn remote locations, mountaineers will set up a \"base camp\", which is an area used for staging attempts at nearby summits. Base camps are positioned to be relatively safe from harsh terrain and weather. Where the summit cannot be reached from base camp in a single day, a mountain will have additional camps above base camp. For popular mountains, base camps may be at a fixed location and become famous. The Everest base camps and Camp Muir are among the most famous base camps.\nHut.\nCamping is not always an option, or may not be suitable if a mountain is close to civilization. Some regions may legally prohibit primitive camping due to concern for the environment, or due to issues with crowds. In lieu of camping, mountaineers may choose to stay in mountain huts.\nThe European alpine regions, in particular, have a large network of huts. Such huts exist at many different heights, including in the high mountains themselves\u00a0\u2013 in extremely remote areas, more rudimentary shelters may exist. The mountain huts are of varying size and quality, but each is typically centred on a communal dining room and have dormitories equipped with mattresses, blankets or duvets, and pillows; guests are expected to bring and use their own sleeping bag liners. The facilities are usually rudimentary, but, given their locations, huts offer vital shelter, make routes more widely accessible (by allowing journeys to be broken and reducing the weight of equipment needing to be carried), and offer good value. In Europe, all huts are staffed during the summer (mid-June to mid-September) and some are staffed in the spring (mid-March to mid-May). Elsewhere, huts may also be open in the fall. Huts also may have a part that is always open, but unstaffed, a so-called winter hut.\nWhen open and staffed, the huts are generally run by full-time employees, but some are staffed on a voluntary basis by members of alpine clubs. The manager of the hut, termed a guardian or warden in Europe, will usually also sell refreshments and meals, both to those visiting only for the day and to those staying overnight. The offering is surprisingly wide, given that most supplies, often including fresh water, must be flown in by helicopter, and may include glucose-based snacks (such as candy bars) on which climbers and walkers wish to stock up, cakes and pastries made at the hut, a variety of hot and cold drinks (including beer and wine), and high carbohydrate dinners in the evenings. Not all huts offer a catered service, though, and visitors may need to provide for themselves. Some huts offer facilities for both, enabling visitors wishing to keep costs down to bring their own food and cooking equipment and to cater using the facilities provided. Booking for overnight stays at huts is deemed obligatory, and in many cases is essential as some popular huts, even with more than 100 bed spaces, may be full during good weather and at weekends. Once made, the cancellation of a reservation is advised as a matter of courtesy\u00a0\u2013 and, indeed, potentially of safety, as many huts keep a record of where climbers and walkers state they plan to walk to next. Most huts may be contacted by telephone and most take credit cards as a means of payment.\nIn the UK, the term \"hut\" is used for any cottage or cabin used as a base for walkers or climbers. These are mostly owned by mountaineering clubs for use by members or visiting clubs and generally do not have wardens or permanent staff, but have cooking and washing facilities and heating. In the Scottish Highlands small simple unstaffed shelters without cooking facilities known as \"bothies\" are maintained to break up cross country long routes and act as base camps to certain mountains.\nSnow cave.\nWhere conditions permit, snow caves are another way to shelter high on the mountain. Some climbers do not use tents at high altitudes unless the snow conditions do not allow for snow caving, since snow caves are silent and much warmer than tents. They can be built relatively easily, given sufficient time, using a snow shovel. The temperature of a correctly made snow cave will hover around freezing, which relative to outside temperatures can be very warm. They can be dug anywhere where there is at least four feet of snow. The addition of a good quality bivouac bag and closed cell foam sleeping mat will also increase the warmth of the snow cave. Another shelter that works well is a quinzee, which is excavated from a pile of snow that has been work hardened or sintered (typically by stomping). Igloos are used by some climbers, but are deceptively difficult to build and require specific snow conditions.\nSafety and hazards.\nMountaineers face a variety of hazards. When climbing mountains, there are two types of hazards, \"objective\" (mountain-based) and \"subjective (human-based)\". Objective hazards relate to the environment, and may include inclement weather conditions, dangerous terrain, duration of exposure, and other environmental conditions. Subjective hazards relate to a climber's poor judgement, poor planning, lack of skills, faulty analysis and conclusions, or inadequate conditioning.\nIn terms of objective hazards, the dangers mountaineers face includes loose or falling rocks, falling ice, snow-avalanches, the climber falling, falls from ice slopes, falls down snow slopes, falls into crevasses, and the dangers from altitude and weather.\nFrom 1947 to 2018, in the United States \"2,799 people were reported to be involved in mountaineering accidents and 43% of these accidents resulted in death.\" Climbers themselves are responsible for nearly all climbing accidents.\nWhen planning and preparing for a trip, safe climbers know what hazards to look for and how to recognize them. In situations where hazards are not able to be avoided, the climber must use their decision-making skills to mitigate those hazards. Climbers improve upon their ability to become a safe decision maker and recognize hazards by receiving proper education, training, practice, and experience as well as learning how to spot personal bias.\nAltitude.\nRapid ascent can lead to altitude sickness. The best treatment is to descend immediately. The climber's motto at high altitude is \"climb high, sleep low\", referring to the regimen of climbing higher to acclimatise but returning to lower elevation to sleep. In the Andes, the chewing of coca leaves has been traditionally used to treat altitude sickness symptoms.\nCommon symptoms of altitude sickness include severe headache, sleep problems, nausea, lack of appetite, lethargy and body ache. Mountain sickness may progress to HACE (high-altitude cerebral edema) and HAPE (high-altitude pulmonary edema), both of which can be fatal within 24 hours.\nIn high mountains, atmospheric pressure is lower and this means that less oxygen is available to breathe. This is the underlying cause of altitude sickness. Everyone needs to acclimatise, even exceptional mountaineers that have been to high altitude before. Generally speaking, mountaineers start using bottled oxygen when they climb above 7,000 m. Exceptional mountaineers have climbed 8000-metre peaks (including Everest) without oxygen, almost always with a carefully planned program of acclimatisation.\nHeat-related conditions.\nExposure to hot environments or activities involving exertion cause heat to build up in the body. A heat-related illness can occur when the body is unable to lose that heat through the skin.\nProblems that can arise from this type of exposure include heat cramps, heat exhaustion, and heat stroke. Common symptoms of heat exhaustion include headaches, cool and clammy skin, dizziness, fatigue, nausea, thirst, and rapid pulse. The best treatment is resting with feet elevated, replenishing fluids, and removing excess clothing.\nCommon symptoms of heat stroke can be an altered state of mind, rapid pulse and respiratory rate, headache, hot skin, loss of coordination, and possible seizures. This is a life-threatening illness that must be dealt with right away. While mountaineering, snow and ice can be used to cool the body and head.\nCold-related conditions.\nIn certain environmental conditions body heat can be lost due to evaporation, radiation, convection, and conduction. A cold-related illness can occur when that body heat is lost.\nProblems that can arise from the cold include wind chill, hypothermia, frost nip, frostbite, and immersion foot.\nThe best treatment for hypothermia is to deal with it before it occurs, using preventative measures instead of waiting for symptoms to appear. Mountaineering requires a slower pace to avoid sweating and fatigue that could lead to these dangerous conditions. Other tips for preventing hypothermia include staying well fed and hydrated, putting on more clothes when feeling cold, and wearing adequate equipment to keep warm and dry.\nMotivations and Spiritual Dimensions.\nAlpinism, beyond its physical and technical demands, serves as a deeply personal and often spiritual pursuit. Many climbers describe their experiences in the mountains as moments of transformation, transcendence, and profound meaning. The solitude of high altitude environments, the exposure to natural elements, and the life or death stakes frequently encountered can bring climbers face to face with existential questions, bringing a sense of connection to forces larger than themselves.\nResearch in psychology supports these claims of transcendence. Elite mountaineers and base jumpers score highly in traits related to self transcendence, personality features associated with spirituality, mindfulness, and a search for meaning. Specifically, they highlight three key character traits associated with self transcendence: self directedness or a sense of purpose, cooperativeness meaning empathy and a sense of connectedness with others, and self transcendence itself or the capacity to feel part of something greater than oneself, often expressed through spiritual or mystical experience. These traits help explain why some individuals are drawn to high-risk, high-reward experiences that facilitate altered states of consciousness and deep reflection.\nThe motivations behind seeking these high-risk situations through mountaineering are often rooted in a sense of personal calling. Climbers articulate their drive not simply as thrill-seeking but as a vocation, and pursuing a spiritually fulfilling, to feel something close to destiny, purpose, and alignment with one's deeper self. This supports earlier work that revealed that climbers often experience spiritual growth, emotional release, and a stronger sense of self through their expeditions.\nMuch of this is due to the way mountains have long been regarded as sacred in numerous cultures, and seen as bridges between the earthly and the divine. This perception continues in modern mountaineering, where the act of climbing is sometimes likened to a pilgrimage. The experience is not solely about physical conquest but about spiritual engagement with the mountain landscape, often resulting in a reverent relationship with nature.\nFlow states as periods of deep focus and loss of time awareness are commonly reported by climbers. These states are central to the appeal of alpinism, providing psychological clarity and a sense of unity with the environment. Such experiences can be transformative, allowing climbers to tap into a higher sense of presence and well-being.\nThe stories of climbers like Marc-Andr\u00e9 Leclerc and Alex Honnold illustrate these spiritual and psychological themes. Leclerc was known for his minimalist and solitary style, with many regarding him as a \"pure spirit\" of the climbing world. In interviews, he spoke about the meditative nature of free solo climbing and his sense of harmony with the mountains. Honnold, famous for his ropeless ascent of El Capitan, has been the subject of psychological profiles that explore his unique risk tolerance and mental discipline. His climbing has been framed as a form of mindfulness practice that challenges conventional understandings of fear and focus.\nAlpinism encompasses more than physical accomplishment, but is often a gateway to inner exploration, emotional catharsis, and spiritual insight. Whether understood through scientific studies or personal narratives, the motivations behind alpinism frequently include a desire for transcendence, connection, and meaning beyond the summit.\nStyles of mountaineering.\nThere are two main styles of mountaineering: expedition style and alpine style.\nExpedition style.\nThe alpine style contrasts with \"expedition style\". With this style, climbers will carry large amounts of equipment and provisions up and down the mountain, slowly making upward progress. Climbing in an expedition style is preferred if the summit is very high or distant from civilization. Mountaineers who use this style are usually, but not always, part of a large team of climbers and support staff (such as porters and guides). To cover large distances with their massive amounts of gear, sleds and pack animals are commonly used. Climbers will set up multiple camps along the mountain, and will haul their gear up the mountain multiple times, returning to a lower camp after each haul until all the gear is at a higher camp; and repeating this procedure until they reach the summit. This technique is also helpful for acclimatization. While it is the original style in which high mountains were climbed, expedition style is rare these days as more mountains have become accessible to the general public with air travel and the penetration of highways into mountainous regions. It is still common in ranges such as the Alaska Range and the Himalayas.\nAlpine style.\nAlpine style, or informal variations of it, is the most common form of mountaineering today. It involves a single, straightforward climb of the mountain, with no backtracking. This style is most suited for medium-sized mountain areas close to civilization with elevations of , such as the Alps or the Rocky Mountains. Alpine style ascents have been done throughout history on extreme altitude (above 5,000 m) peaks also, albeit in lower volume to expedition style ascents. Climbers generally carry their loads between camps without backtracking, in a single push for the summit. If the summit is reachable from the base camp or trailhead within one day, then alpine-style mountaineers will not change camps at all, and only carry the slightest of loads (necessary nourishment and equipment) up to the summit. \"Light and fast\" is the mantra of the alpine mountaineer.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It lies in the northern section of the Isthmus of Corinth opposite the island of Salamis, which belonged to Megara in archaic times, before being taken by Athens. Megara was one of the four districts of Attica, embodied in the four mythic sons of King Pandion II, of whom Nisos was the ruler of Megara. Megara was also a trade port, its people using their ships and wealth as a way to gain leverage on armies of neighboring poleis. Megara specialized in the exportation of wool and other animal products including livestock such as horses. It possessed two harbors, Pagae to the west on the Corinthian Gulf, and Nisaea to the east on the Saronic Gulf of the Aegean Sea. Greek painter Th\u00e9odore Jacques Ralli created countless paintings featuring the village of Megara between 1873 and 1909. \nHistory.\nLate Bronze.\nMycenaean period.\nIn the Late Bronze Age, Megara features prominently as a small kingdom in the myths and legends of Homer. Megara emerged between two fortified ports, Nisaea on the Saronic Gulf and Pagae on the Gulf of Corinth, on two acropolises Karia and Alkathos. However, Megara at this point remains more mythical until it started expanding in Iron II.\nIn Greek mythology, Nisus was a King of Megara and son of king Pandion II of Athens, and gave his name to the port Nisaea. Pandion II had married Pylia, daughter of King Pylas of Megara. Pylas was the son of Cteson, son of Lelex. Megara was the capital in Megaris.\nArchaeology. Megara is considered a Mycenaean fortified site. Myths suggests the seat of a petty king with a megaron. However, modern buildings obscure the remains and only some ruins have been found. Isolated blocks of Cyclopean walls were first found on the upper part of the hill by Fimmen and later by Field. A palace here would command the costal plain and valley towards the north-east.\nIron Age.\nAccording to Pausanias, the Megarians said that their town owed its origin to Car, the son of Phoroneus, who built the citadel called 'Caria' and the temples of Demeter called Megara, from which the place derived its name.\nIn historical times, Megara was an early dependency of Corinth, in which capacity colonists from Megara founded Megara Hyblaea, a small \"polis\" north of Syracuse in Sicily. Megara then fought a war of independence with Corinth, and afterwards founded Chalcedon in 685\u00a0BC, as well as Byzantium (c. 667\u00a0BC).\nMegara is known to have early ties with Miletos, which is located within the region of Caria in Asia Minor. According to some scholars, they had built up a \"colonisation alliance\". In the 7th/6th century BCE these two cities acted in concordance with each other.\nBoth cities acted under the leadership and sanction of an Apollo oracle. Megara cooperated with that of Delphi. Miletos had her own oracle of Apollo Didymeus Milesios in Didyma. Also, there are many parallels in the political organisation of both cities.\nIn the late 7th century BC Theagenes established himself as tyrant of Megara by slaughtering the cattle of the rich to win over the poor. Arguably the most famous citizen of Megara in antiquity was Byzas, the legendary founder of Byzantium in the 7th century BC. The 6th century BC poet Theognis also came from Megara.\nSecond Persian Invasion.\nDuring the second Persian invasion of Greece (480\u2013479\u00a0BC) Megara fought alongside the Spartans and Athenians at crucial battles such as Salamis and Plataea.\nFirst Peloponnesian War.\nMegara defected from the Spartan-dominated Peloponnesian League (c.\u00a0460\u00a0BC) to the Delian league due to border disputes with its neighbour Corinth; this defection was one of the causes of the First Peloponnesian War (460\u00a0\u2013\u00a0c.\u00a0445\u00a0BC). By the terms of the Thirty Years' Peace of 446\u2013445\u00a0BC Megara was forced to return to the Peloponnesian League.\nSecond Peloponnesian War.\nIn the (second) Peloponnesian War (c.\u00a0431\u00a0\u2013\u00a0404\u00a0BC), Megara was an ally of Sparta. The Megarian decree is considered to be one of several contributing \"causes\" of the Peloponnesian War. Athens issued the Megarian decree, which banned Megarian merchants from territory controlled by Athens; its aim was to constrict the Megarian economy. The Athenians claimed that they were responding to the Megarians' desecration of the \"Hiera Orgas\", a sacred precinct in the border region between the two states.\nIn the 5th century BC, Herodicus ,the father of sports medicine, recommended patients walk from Athens to Megara. This is the first time in history where patients were prescribed exercise.\nIn the early 4th century BC, Euclid of Megara founded the Megarian school of philosophy which flourished for about a century, famous for the use of logic and dialectic.\nClassical Age.\nDuring the Celtic invasion in 279 BC, Megara sent a force of 400 peltasts (light infantrymen) to Thermopylae. During the Chremonidean War, in 266 BC, the Megarians were besieged by the Macedonian king Antigonus Gonatas and managed to defeat his elephants employing burning pigs. Despite this success, the Megarians had to submit to the Macedonians.\nIn 243\u00a0BC, exhorted by Aratus of Sicyon, Megara expelled its Macedonian garrison and joined the Achaean League, but when the Achaeans lost control of the Isthmus in 223\u00a0BC the Megarians left them and joined the Boeotian League. Not more than thirty years later, however, the Megarians grew tired of the Boeotian decline and returned their allegiance to Achaea. The Achaean strategos Philopoemen fought off the Boeotian intervention force and secured Megara's return, either in 203 or in 193 BC.\nAccording to Plutarch, Megarians tried to unleash lions against the besieging Roman troops guided by Quintus Fufius Calenus around 48 BC, but the animals \"rushed among the unarmed citizens themselves and preyed upon them as they ran hither and thither, so that even to the enemy the sight was a pitiful one\".\nThe Megarians were proverbial for their generosity in building and endowing temples. Saint Jerome reports \"There is a common saying about the Megarians [...:] 'They build as if they are to live forever; they live as if they are to die tomorrow.'\"\nThe Greeks used the proverb \"worthy of the Megarians share\" (), meaning dishonorable/dishonored.\nDemocracy in Megara.\nMegara seems to have experienced democracy on two occasions. The first was between 427 BC, when there was a democratic uprising, and 424 BC, when a narrow oligarchy was installed (Thuc. 3.68.3; 4.66-8, 73\u20134). The second was in the 370s BC, when we hear that the people of Megara expelled some anti-democratic conspirators (Diod. 15.40.4). By the 350s BC, though, Isocrates is referring to Megara in terms that suggests that it was an oligarchy again (Isoc. 8.117-19).\nOne of the first actions of the new oligarchy in 424 BC was to compel the people to vote openly, which suggests that the democracy had made use of the secret ballot. Megarian democracy also made use of ostracism. Other key institutions of the democracy included a popular Assembly and Council, and a board of five (or six) generals.\nAccording to Plutarch, Megara was also a democracy in the 6th century BC. The measures said to be implemented by the radical government included making interest-bearing loans illegal and forcing creditors to return the interest they had collected. While some historians accept the existence of democracy in the archaic period, others consider the story to reflect the later anti-democratic political thought.\nGeography.\nMegara is located in the westernmost part of Attica, near the Megara Gulf, a bay of the Saronic Gulf. The coastal plain around Megara is referred to as Megaris, which is also the name of the ancient city state centered on Megara. Megara is 8\u00a0km west of Nea Peramos, 18\u00a0km west of Elefsina, 19\u00a0km east of Agioi Theodoroi, 34\u00a0km west of Athens and 37\u00a0km east of Corinth.\nTransport.\nRoad.\nThe A8 motorway connects Megara with Athens and Corinth.\nRail.\nThe Megara railway station is served by Proastiakos suburban trains to Athens and Kiato.\nAir.\nThere is a small military airfield south of the town, ICAO code LGMG.\nMunicipality.\nThe municipality of Megara was formed at the 2011 local government reform by the merger of two former municipalities, Megara and Nea Peramos, which became municipal units. In 2017 Kineta became a separate community within the municipal unit of Megara.\nThe municipality has an area of 330.11\u00a0km2, the municipal unit 322.21\u00a0km2.\nDistricts and suburbs.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nPopular culture.\nGreek painter Th\u00e9odore Jacques Ralli created countless paintings featuring the village of Megara between 1873 and 1909. The artist chose to paint local subjects featuring everyday life in the village. Some of his works featuring Megara include \"Les Confitures de Roses a Megara\", \"Praying Before the Communion at Megara\", and \"Woman from Megara with Sickle\". In 1974, a Greek documentary named \"Megara\" was made about the village, directed by Sakis Maniatis and Yorgos Tsemberopoulos, about the struggle of olive growers in Megara fighting the Greek Military Junta's attempt to take a large agricultural region of the village and use it to build an oil refinery. The name Megara is used in the 1997 Disney film \"Hercules\". In 2024, parts of the film called \"The Carpenter's Son\" directed by Lotfy Nathan and starring Nicolas Cage were filmed in Megara.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "20345", "revid": "211905", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20345", "title": "Martin of Tours", "text": "Christian cleric and saint (316/336\u2013397)\nMartin of Tours (; 316/336\u00a0\u2013 8 November 397) was the third bishop of Tours. He is the patron saint of many communities and organizations across Europe, including France's Third Republic. A native of Pannonia (present-day Hungary), he converted to Christianity at a young age. He served in the Roman cavalry in Gaul, but left military service prior to 361, when he became a disciple of Hilary of Poitiers, establishing the monastery at Ligug\u00e9. He was consecrated as Bishop of Caesarodunum (Tours) in 371. As bishop, he was active in the suppression of the remnants of Gallo-Roman religion.\nThe contemporary hagiographer Sulpicius Severus wrote a \"Life of St. Martin\". He is best known for the account of his using his sword to cut his cloak in two, to give half to a beggar clad only in rags in winter. His shrine in Tours became an often-frequented stop for pilgrims on the road to Santiago de Compostela in Spain.\nHagiography.\nSulpicius Severus, a contemporary Christian writer who knew Martin personally, wrote a hagiography of the early life of the saint. It contains descriptions of supernatural events, such as interactions with the devil and various miracles: Martin casts out demons, heals a paralytic, and raises the dead. Other miracles are: turning back the flames from a house while Martin was burning down the Roman temple it adjoined; deflecting the path of a felled sacred pine; the healing power of a letter written by Martin.\nLife.\nSoldier.\nMartin was born in AD 316 or 336 in Savaria, in the Diocese of Pannonia (now Szombathely, Hungary). His father was a senior officer (tribune) in the Roman military. His father was then allowed veteran status and was given land on which to retire at Ticinum (now Pavia), in northern Italy, where Martin grew up.\nAt the age of 10, he attended the Christian church against the wishes of his parents and became a catechumen. Christianity had been made a legal religion in the Roman Empire in 313. It had many more adherents in the Eastern Empire, whence it had sprung, and was concentrated in cities, brought along the trade routes by converted Jews and Greeks (the term \"pagan\" literally means \"country-dweller\"). Christianity was far from accepted among the higher echelons of society; among members of the army the worship of Mithras would have been stronger. Although the conversion of the Emperor Constantine and the subsequent programme of church-building gave a greater impetus to the spread of the religion, it was still a minority faith.\nAs the son of a veteran officer, Martin at 15 was required to join a cavalry \"ala.\" At the age of 18 (around 334 or 354), he was stationed at \"Ambianensium civitas\" or Samarobriva in Gaul (now Amiens, France). It is likely that he joined the \"Equites catafractarii Ambianenses\", a heavy cavalry unit listed in the . As the unit was stationed at Milan and is also recorded at Trier, it is likely to have been part of the elite cavalry bodyguard of the Emperor, which accompanied him on his travels around the Empire. \nMartin's biographer, Sulpicius Severus, provided no dates in his chronology, so although he indicated that Martin served in the military \"for nearly two years after his baptism\", it is difficult for historians to pin down the exact date of Martin's exit from military service. Still, historian Andre Mertens has concluded that \"[h]e [Martin] served under the Roman emperor Constantine II (ruled 337\u2013340) and afterwards under Julian (ruled 361\u2013363)\".\nRegardless of the difficulties in chronology, Sulpicius reports that just before a battle in the Gallic provinces at Borbetomagus (now Worms, Germany), Martin determined that his switch of allegiance to a new commanding officer (away from the pagan Julian and to Christ), along with his reluctance to receive a salary from Julian just as he was about to retire, prohibited his taking the money and continuing to submit to the emperor's commands, telling him, \"I am the soldier of Christ: it is not lawful for me to fight.\" He was charged with cowardice and jailed, but in response to the charge, he volunteered to go unarmed to the front of the troops. His superiors planned to take him up on the offer, but before they could, the invaders sued for peace, the battle never occurred, and Martin was released from military service.\nMonk and hermit.\nMartin declared his vocation, and made his way to the city of Caesarodunum (now Tours), where he became a disciple of Hilary of Poitiers' Christian orthodoxy. He opposed the Arianism of the Imperial Court. When Hilary was forced into exile from Pictavium (now Poitiers), Martin returned to Italy. According to Sulpicius, he converted an Alpine brigand on the way, and confronted the Devil himself. Having heard in a dream a summons to revisit his home, Martin crossed the Alps, and from Milan went over to Pannonia. There he converted his mother and some other persons; his father he could not win over. While in Illyricum he took sides against the Arians with so much zeal that he was publicly whipped and forced to leave. Returning from Illyria, he was confronted by Auxentius of Milan, the Arian Archbishop of Milan, who expelled him from the city. According to the early sources, Martin decided to seek shelter on the island then called Gallinaria, now Isola d'Albenga, in the Ligurian Sea, where he lived the solitary life of a hermit. Not entirely alone, since the chronicles indicate that he would have been in the company of a \"priest, a man of great virtues\", and for a period with Hilary of Poitiers, on this island, where the wild hens lived. Martin lived on a diet of herbs and wild roots.\nWith the return of Hilary to his see in 361, Martin joined him and established a hermitage at what is now the town of Ligug\u00e9 south of Poitiers, and soon attracted converts and followers. The crypt under the parish church (not the current Abbey Chapel) reveals traces of a Roman villa, probably part of the bath complex, which had been abandoned before Martin established himself there. The monastery became a centre for the evangelisation of the country districts around Poitiers, and later developed into Ligug\u00e9 Abbey, belonging to the Order of St. Benedict and claiming to be the oldest monastery known in western Europe.\nBishop.\nIn 371, Martin succeeded Litorius, the second bishop of Tours. He impressed the city with his demeanour. He was enticed to Tours from Ligug\u00e9 by a ruse \u2013 he was urged to come to minister to someone sick \u2013 and was brought to the church, where he reluctantly allowed himself to be consecrated bishop. According to one version, he was so unwilling to be made bishop that he hid in a barn full of geese, but their cackling at his intrusion gave him away to the crowd; that may account for complaints by a few that his appearance was too disheveled to be commensurate with a bishopric, but the critics were hugely outnumbered.\nAs bishop, Martin set to enthusiastically ordering the destruction of pagan temples, altars and sculptures:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;[W]hen in a certain village he had demolished a very ancient temple, and had set about cutting down a pine-tree, which stood close to the temple, the chief priest of that place, and a crowd of other heathens began to oppose him; and these people, though, under the influence of the Lord, they had been quiet while the temple was being overthrown, could not patiently allow the tree to be cut down.\nSulpicius writes that Martin withdrew from the city to live in Marmoutier (\"Majus Monasterium\"), a rural monastery which he founded a short distance upstream from Tours on the opposite shore of the river Loire. Martin introduced a rudimentary parish system in his diocese. Once a year, the bishop visited each of his parishes, traveling on foot, or by donkey or boat. He continued to set up monastic communities, and extended the influence of his episcopate from Touraine to such distant points as Chartres, Paris, Autun, and Vienne.\nIn one instance, the pagans agreed to fell their sacred pine tree, if Martin would stand directly in its path. He did so, and it miraculously missed him. Sulpicius, a classically educated aristocrat, related this anecdote with dramatic details, as a set piece. Sulpicius could not have failed to know the incident the Roman poet Horace recalls in several \"Odes\" of his own narrow escape from a falling tree.\nOn behalf of the Priscillianists.\nThe churches of other parts of Gaul and in Spain were being disturbed by the Priscillianists, an ascetic sect, named after its leader, Priscillian. The First Council of Saragossa had forbidden several of Priscillian's practices (albeit without mentioning Priscillian by name), but Priscillian was elected bishop of \u00c1vila shortly thereafter. Ithacius of Ossonoba appealed to the emperor Gratian, who issued a rescript against Priscillian and his followers. After failing to obtain the support of Ambrose of Milan and Pope Damasus I, Priscillian appealed to Magnus Maximus, who had usurped the throne from Gratian.\nAlthough greatly opposed to the Priscillianists, Martin traveled to the Imperial court of Trier to remove them from the secular jurisdiction of the emperor. With Ambrose, Martin rejected Bishop Ithacius's principle of putting heretics to death \u2013 as well as the intrusion of the emperor into such matters. He prevailed upon the emperor to spare the life of the heretic Priscillian. At first, Maximus acceded to his entreaty, but, when Martin had departed, yielded to Ithacius and ordered Priscillian and his followers to be beheaded (in 385). Martin then pleaded for a cessation of the persecution of Priscillian's followers in Spain. Deeply grieved, Martin refused to communicate with Ithacius until pressured by the Emperor.\nDeath.\nMartin died in Candes-Saint-Martin, Gaul (central France) in 397. After he died, local citizens of the Poitou region and residents of Tours quarreled over where Martin would be buried. One evening after dark, several residents of Tours carried Martin's body to a waiting boat on the river Loire, where teams of rowers ferried his body on the river to Tours, where a huge throng of people waited on the river banks to meet and pay their last respects to Martin's body. One chronicle states that \"2,000 monks, and nearly as many white-robed virgins, walked in the procession\" accompanying the body from the river to a small grove just west of the city, where Martin was buried and where his shrine was established.\nShrine basilica.\nThe shrine chapel at Tours developed into one of the most prominent and influential establishments in medieval France. Charlemagne awarded the position of Abbot to his friend and adviser Alcuin. At this time the abbot could travel between Tours and the court at Trier in Germany and always stay overnight at one of his own properties. It was at Tours that Alcuin's scriptorium (a room in monasteries devoted to the copying of manuscripts by monastic scribes) developed Carolingian minuscule, the clear round hand that made manuscripts far more legible.\nIn later times the abbey was destroyed by fire on several occasions and ransacked by Norman Vikings in 853 and in 903. It burned again in 994, and was rebuilt by Herv\u00e9 de Buzan\u00e7ais, treasurer of Saint Martin, an effort that took 20 years to complete. Expanded to accommodate the crowds of pilgrims and to attract them, the shrine of St. Martin of Tours became an often-frequented stop on pilgrimages. In 1453 the remains of Saint Martin were transferred to a magnificent new reliquary donated by Charles VII of France and Agn\u00e8s Sorel.\nDuring the French Wars of Religion, the basilica was sacked by the Protestant Huguenots in 1562. It was disestablished during the French Revolution. It was deconsecrated, used as a stable, then utterly demolished. Its dressed stones were sold in 1802 after two streets were built across the site, to ensure the abbey would not be reconstructed.\nLegend of Saint Martin dividing his cloak.\nWhile Martin was a soldier in the Roman army and stationed in Gaul (modern-day France), he experienced a vision, which became the most-repeated story about his life. One day as he was approaching the gates of the city of Amiens, he met a scantily clad beggar. He impulsively cut his military cloak in half to share with the man. That night, Martin dreamed of Jesus wearing the half of the cloak he had given away. He heard Jesus say to some of the angels, \"Martin, who is still but a catechumen, clothed me with this robe.\" (https://). In another version, when Martin woke, he found his cloak restored to wholeness. The dream confirmed Martin in his piety, and he was baptised at the age of 18.\nThe part kept by himself became the famous relic preserved in the oratory of the Merovingian kings of the Franks at the Marmoutier Abbey near Tours. During the Middle Ages, the supposed relic of St. Martin's miraculous cloak (\"cappa Sancti Martini\") was carried by the king even into battle, and used as a holy relic upon which oaths were sworn. The cloak is first attested to in the royal treasury in 679 when it was conserved at the \"palatium\" of Luzarches, a royal villa that was later ceded to the monks of Saint-Denis by Charlemagne, in 798/99.\nThe priest who cared for the cloak in its reliquary was called a \"cappellanu\", and ultimately all priests who served the military were called \"cappellani\". The French translation is \"chapelains\", from which the English word \"chaplain\" is derived.\nA similar linguistic development took place for the term referring to the small temporary churches built for the relic. People called them a \"capella\", the word for a little cloak. Eventually, such small churches lost their association with the cloak, and all small churches began to be referred to as \"chapels\".\nVeneration.\nThe veneration of Martin was widely popular in the Middle Ages, above all in the region between the Loire and the Marne, where Le Roy Ladurie and Zysberg noted the densest accretion of place names commemorating Martin. Venantius Fortunatus had earlier declared, \"Wherever Christ is known, Martin is honored.\"\nWhen Bishop Perpetuus took office at Tours in 461, the little chapel over Martin's grave, built in the previous century by Martin's immediate successor, Bricius, was no longer sufficient for the crowd of pilgrims it was already drawing. Perpetuus built a larger basilica, long and wide, with 120 columns. Martin's body was taken from the simple chapel at his hermitage at Candes-St-Martin to Tours and his sarcophagus was reburied behind the high altar of the new basilica. A large block of marble above the tomb, the gift of bishop Euphronius of Autun (472\u2013475), rendered it visible to the faithful gathered behind the high altar. Werner Jacobsen suggests it may also have been visible to pilgrims encamped in the atrium of the basilica. Contrary to the usual arrangement, the atrium was situated behind the church, close to the tomb in the apse, which may have been visible through a \"fenestrella\" in the apse wall.\nSt. Martin's popularity can be partially attributed to his adoption by successive royal houses of France. Clovis, King of the Salian Franks, one of many warring tribes in sixth-century France, promised his Christian wife Clotilda that he would be baptised if he was victorious over the Alemanni. He credited the intervention of St Martin with his success, and with several following triumphs, including the defeat of Alaric II. Devotion to St Martin continued to be closely identified with the Merovingian monarchy: in the early seventh century Dagobert I commissioned the goldsmith Saint Eligius to make a work in gold and gems for the tomb-shrine. The bishop Gregory of Tours wrote and distributed an influential \"Life\" of St. Martin. His popularity continued under the Merovingians' successors, the Carolingian dynasty.\nMartin is honored in the Church of England and in the Episcopal Church on 11 November.\nRevival of the popular devotion to St. Martin in the Third Republic.\nExcavations and rediscovery of the tomb.\nIn 1860 excavations by Leo Dupont (1797\u20131876) established the dimensions of the former abbey and recovered some fragments of architecture. The tomb of St. Martin was rediscovered on 14 December 1860, which aided in the nineteenth-century revival of the popular devotion to St. Martin.\nAfter the radical Paris Commune of 1871, there was a resurgence of conservative Catholic piety. The architect Victor Laloux designed the Basilique Saint-Martin, erected on a portion of its former site. Started in 1886, the church was consecrated 4 July 1925.\nFranco-Prussian War.\nMartin's renewed popularity in France was related to his promotion as a military saint during the Franco-Prussian War of 1870\u20131871. In this era, Tours became the effective capital of France. During the French Third Republic, he was seen as a patron saint of France.\nSt Martin was promoted by the clerical right as the protector of the nation against the German threat. The ruined towers of the old royal basilica of St. Martin at Tours came to symbolize the decline of traditional Catholic France.\nWith the government's relocation to Tours during the Franco-Prussian War, 1870, numerous pilgrims traveled to St. Martin's tomb. The banner read \"Heart of Jesus Save France\" and on the reverse side Carmelite nuns of Tours embroidered \"Saint Martin Protect France\". As the French army was victorious in Patay, some attributed it to Martin's intercession. Popular hymns of the 1870s developed the theme of national protection under the cover of Martin's cloak, the \"first flag of France.\"\nThe Catholic right presented Martin as a masculine model of principled behavior, a brave fighter, a charitable man, and respectful of respected secular authority.\nSt. Martin as a French Republican patron.\nArchbishop Ren\u00e9 Fran\u00e7ois Renou (Archbishop of Tours, 1896\u20131913) descirbed the cloak of St. Martin as the \"first flag of France,\" not the French tricolor. St. Martin's popularity was renewed during the First World War. Anticlericalism declined, and priests served in the French forces as chaplains; of the \"more than twenty-three thousand parish priests and more than nine thousand members of religious orders\" who took part in the war, \"3,101 were killed.\" In 1916, Assumptionists organized a national pilgrimage to Tours that attracted people from all over France. The devotion to St. Martin was amplified in the dioceses of France, where special prayers were offered to the patron saint. When the armistice was signed on Saint Martin's Day, 11 November 1918, many French people saw it as a sign of his intercession in the affairs of France.\nPatronage.\nSaint Martin is the patron saint of beggars, wool-weavers, tailors, the United States Army Quartermaster Corps, geese, vintners, and innkeepers, and France.\nBeyond his patronage of the French Third Republic, Saint Martin more recently has also been described in terms of \"a spiritual bridge across Europe\", due to his \"international\" background, being a native of Pannonia who spent his adult life in Gaul.\nIn Poland, Saint Martin is the patron saint of the towns of Bydgoszcz and Opat\u00f3w. His feast day is celebrated with a procession and festivities in the city of Pozna\u0144, where the main street (\"\u015awi\u0119ty Marcin\") is named for him, along with a 13th-century church which is dedicated to him. As November 11 is also Polish Independence Day, it is a public holiday.\nSaint Martin is the patron saint of the city of Szombathely, Hungary, which contains a church dedicated to him. He is the patron saint of Buenos Aires, Argentina. In the Netherlands, he is the patron of the cathedral and city of Utrecht. He is also the patron of the city of Groningen; its Martini tower and Martinikerk (Martin's Church) were named for him.\nSaint Martin is also the patron of the church and town of Bocaue, in the Philippines.\nSaint Martin is the patron saint of the United States Army Quartermaster Corps, which also awards a medal in his name, the Order of St. Martin. \nSaint Martin is also patron saint of the Church Lads' and Church Girls' Brigade, an Anglican youth organisation; the youngest section of the brigade, comprising those aged 4 to 7, was renamed the \"Martins\" in his honour in 1998.\nIconography.\nSaint Martin is most generally portrayed on horseback dividing his cloak with the beggar. His emblem in English art is often that of a goose, whose annual migration is about late autumn.\nInfluence.\nBy the early 9th century, respect for Saint Martin was well-established in Ireland. His monastery at Marmo\u00fbtiers became the training ground for many Celtic missions and missionaries. Some believe that St. Patrick was his nephew and that Patrick was one of many Celtic notables who lived for a time at Marmo\u00fbtiers. St. Ninian definitely studied at Marmo\u00fbtiers and was profoundly influenced by Martin, to whom he dedicated a new church. The Book of Armagh contains, among other texts, almost the complete body of writings on Saint Martin by Sulpicius Severus.\nIn Jonas of Bobbio's \"Vita Columbani\", Jonas relates that Saint Columbanus, while travelling, requested to be allowed to pray at the tomb of St Martin. The Irish palimpsest sacramentary from the mid-7th century contains the text of a mass for St Martin. In the \"Life of Columba\", Adamnan mentions in passing that St Martin was commemorated during Mass at Iona.\nIn his \"Ireland and Her Neighbours in the Seventh Century\", Michael Richter attributes this to the mission of Palladius seen within the wider context of the mission of Germanus of Auxerre to Britain around 429. Thus, this could be the context in which the \"Life of St Martin\" was brought from Gaul to Ireland at an early date, and could explain how Columbanus was familiar with it before he ever left Ireland.\nLegacy.\nLigug\u00e9 Abbey.\nFounded by Martin of Tours in 360, Ligug\u00e9 Abbey is one of the earliest monastic foundations in France. The reputation of the founder attracted a large number of disciples to the new monastery; the disciples initially living in \"locaciacum\". or small huts, this name later evolved to Ligug\u00e9. Its reputation was soon eclipsed by Martin's later foundation at Marmoutier. As of 2013, the Benedictine community at Ligug\u00e9 numbered 25.\nEuropean folk traditions.\nFrom the late 4th century to the late Middle Ages, much of Western Europe, including Great Britain, engaged in a period of fasting beginning on the day after St. Martin's Day (also referred to as \"Martinmas\"), November 11. This fast period lasted 40 days (not including Saturdays and Sundays), and was, therefore, called \"Quadragesima Sancti Martini\", meaning \"the forty days of St. Martin\" in Latin. On St. Martin's eve and on the feast day, people ate, drank and celebrated before they began to fast. This fasting time was later called \"Advent\" by the Church, and was considered a time for spiritual preparation for Christmas.\nOn St. Martin's Day, children in Flanders, the southern and northern parts of the Netherlands, and the Catholic areas of Germany and Austria participate in paper lantern processions. Often, a man dressed as St. Martin rides on a horse in front of the procession. The children sing songs about St. Martin and about their lanterns. The food traditionally eaten on the day is goose, a rich bird. According to legend, Martin was reluctant to become a bishop, and tried to hide in a stable filled with geese; however, the noise made by the geese betrayed his location to the people who were looking for him.\nIn the eastern part of the Belgian province of East Flanders (Aalst) and the western part of West Flanders (Ypres), traditionally children receive presents from St. Martin on November 11, instead of from Saint Nicholas on December 6 or Santa Claus on December 25. They also have lantern processions, for which children make lanterns out of beets. In recent years, the lantern processions have become widespread as a popular ritual, even in Protestant areas of Germany and the Netherlands, although most Protestant churches no longer officially recognize Saints.\nIn Portugal, where the saint's day is celebrated across the country, it is common for families and friends to gather around the fire in reunions called \"magustos\", where they typically eat roasted chestnuts and drink wine, \"jeropiga\" (a drink made of grape must and aguardente) and \"aguap\u00e9\" (a sort of weak and watered-down wine). According to the most widespread variation of the cloak story, Saint Martin cut off half of his cloak in order to offer it to a beggar, and along the way, gave the remaining part to a second beggar. As he faced a long ride in a freezing weather, the dark clouds cleared away and the sun shone so intensely that the frost melted away. Such weather was rare for early November, so was credited to God's intervention. The phenomenon of a sunny break to the chilly weather on Saint Martin's Day (11 November) is called \"Ver\u00e3o de S\u00e3o Martinho\" (Saint Martin's Summer, \"veranillo de san Mart\u00edn\" in Spanish) in honor of the cloak legend.\nIn Malta, on the night of the eve of Saint Martin's day children leave an empty bag next to the bed. When they wake the next day the bag is supposed to be filled with fruit.\nMany churches are named after Saint Martin of Tours. St Martin-in-the-Fields, at Trafalgar Square in the centre of London, has a history appropriately associated with Martin's renunciation of war. Dick Sheppard, founder of the Peace Pledge Union, was the vicar from 1914 to 1926, and the site contains a memorial chapel dedicated to him. There is also a plaque commemorating noted Anglican pacifist Vera Brittain. The steps of the St Martin-in-the-Fields are often used for peace vigils. \nSaint Martin's Cathedral in Ypres is also dedicated to him. \nSt. Martin's Church in Kaiserslautern, Germany is a major city landmark. It is located in the heart of the city's downtown in St. Martin's Square, and is surrounded by a number of restaurants and shops. The church was originally built as a Franciscan monastery in the 14th century and has a number of unique architectural features.\nThe Monastery of Saint Martin of Casta\u00f1eda has been a national historic monument since 1931. It is located in Galende, Sanabria, province of Zamora, Spain. It now functions as an interpretation center.\nIn Latin America, St. Martin has a strong popular following and is frequently referred to as San Mart\u00edn Caballero, in reference to his common depiction on horseback. Mexican folklore believes him to be a particularly helpful saint toward business owners.\nThe largest Anglican church in North America is St Martin's Episcopal in Houston, Texas. It was the home church for many years of President and Mrs. George H. W. Bush and still is for former Secretary of State and Treasury James Baker and his wife Susan.\nSan Mart\u00edn de Loba is the name of a municipality in the Bol\u00edvar Department of Colombia. Saint Martin, as San Mart\u00edn de Loba, is the patron saint of Vasquez, a small village in Colombia.\nIn Finland, the town and municipality Marttila (\"S:t M\u00e5rtens\" in Swedish) is named after St. Martin and depicts him on its coat of arms.\nThough no mention of St. Martin's connection with viticulture is made by Gregory of Tours or other early hagiographers, he is now credited with a prominent role in spreading wine-making throughout the Touraine region and the planting of many vines. The Greek myth that Aristaeus first discovered the concept of pruning the vines, after watching a goat eat some of the foliage, has been adopted for Martin. He is also credited with introducing the Chenin blanc grape varietal, from which most of the white wine of western Touraine and Anjou is made.\nMartin Luther was named after St. Martin, as he was baptised on 11 November 1483 (St. Martin's Day), and many older Lutheran congregations are named after St. Martin.\nIn art and modern film.\nThe Dutch film \"Flesh and Blood\" (1985) prominently features a statue of Saint Martin. A mercenary in Renaissance Italy, named Martin, finds a statue of Saint Martin cutting his cloak and takes it as a sign to desert and rogue around under the saint's protection.\nBay 20 in the Chartres Cathedral portrays the life of St. Martin in a 40-panel stained glass window.\nNotes and references.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSee also.\nGeneral and cited sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

There is no consensus on the specifics of such a concept, or whether the concept itself even exists in any objective sense. Thinking and discourse on the topic is sought in the English language through questions such as\u2014but not limited to\u2014\"What is the meaning of life?\", \"What is the purpose of existence?\", and \"Why are we here?\". There have been many proposed answers to these questions from many different cultural and ideological backgrounds. The search for life's meaning has produced much philosophical, scientific, theological, and metaphysical speculation throughout history. Different people and cultures believe different things for the answer to this question. Opinions vary on the usefulness of using time and resources in the pursuit of an answer. Excessive pondering can be indicative of, or lead to, an existential crisis.\nThe meaning of life can be derived from philosophical and religious contemplation of, and scientific inquiries about, existence, social ties, consciousness, and happiness. Many other issues are also involved, such as symbolic meaning, ontology, value, purpose, ethics, good and evil, free will, the existence of one or multiple gods, conceptions of God, the soul, and the afterlife. Scientific contributions focus primarily on describing related empirical facts about the universe, exploring the context and parameters concerning the \"how\" of life. Science also studies and can provide recommendations for the pursuit of well-being and a related conception of morality. An alternative, humanistic approach poses the question, \"What is the meaning of \"my\" life?\"\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nOrigin of the expression.\nThe first English use of the expression \"meaning of life\" appears in Thomas Carlyle's \"Sartor Resartus\" (1833\u20131834), book II chapter IX, \"The Everlasting Yea\". Our Life is compassed round with Necessity; yet is the meaning of Life itself no other than Freedom, than Voluntary Force: thus have we a warfare; in the beginning, especially, a hard-fought battle.Carlyle may have been inspired by earlier usage of the equivalent German expression \"der Sinn des Lebens\" by German Romantic writers Novalis and Friedrich Schlegel. Schlegel was the first to use it in print by way of his novel \"Lucinde\" (1799), though Novalis had done so in a 1797\u20131798 manuscript, in which he wrote: \"Only an artist can divine the meaning of life.\" Additionally, the word \"lebenssinn\", translated as life's meaning, had been used by Goethe in a 1796 letter to Schiller. These authors grappled with the rationalism and materialism of modernity. Carlyle called this the \"Torch of Science\", which burned \"more fiercely than ever\" and made religion \"all parched away, under the Droughts of practical and spiritual Unbelief\", resulting in the \"Wilderness\" of \"the wide World in an Atheistic Century\".\nOrigin of the question.\nArthur Schopenhauer was the first to explicitly ask the question, in an essay entitled \"Character\".Since \"a man does not alter\", and his \"moral character\" remains absolutely the same all through his life; since he must play out the part which he has received, without the least deviation from the character; since neither experience, nor philosophy, nor religion can effect any improvement in him, the question arises, What is the meaning of life at all? To what purpose is it played, this farce in which everything that is essential is irrevocably fixed and determined?Questions about the meaning of life, and similar, have been expressed in a broad variety of other ways, including:\nThese questions have resulted in a wide range of competing answers and explications, from scientific theories, to philosophical, theological, and spiritual explanations.\nScientific inquiry and perspectives.\nMany members of the scientific community and philosophy of science communities think that science can provide the relevant context, and set of parameters necessary for dealing with topics related to the meaning of life. In their view, science can offer a wide range of insights on topics ranging from the science of happiness to death anxiety. Scientific inquiry facilitates this through nomological investigation into various aspects of life and reality, such as the Big Bang, the origin of life, and evolution, and by studying the objective factors which correlate with the subjective experience of meaning and happiness.\nPsychological significance and value in life.\nResearchers in positive psychology study empirical factors that lead to life satisfaction, full engagement in activities, making a fuller contribution by using one's personal strengths, and meaning based on investing in something larger than the self. Large-data studies of flow experiences have consistently suggested that humans experience meaning and fulfillment when mastering challenging tasks and that the experience comes from the way tasks are approached and performed rather than the particular choice of task. For example, flow experiences can be obtained by prisoners in concentration camps with minimal facilities, and occur only slightly more often in billionaires. A classic example is of two workers on an apparently boring production line in a factory. One treats the work as a tedious chore while the other turns it into a game to see how fast they can make each unit and achieves flow in the process.\nNeuroscience describes reward, pleasure, and motivation in terms of neurotransmitter activity, especially in the limbic system and the ventral tegmental area in particular. If one believes that the meaning of life is to maximize pleasure and to ease general life, then this allows normative predictions about how to act to achieve this. Likewise, some ethical naturalists advocate a science of morality\u2014the empirical pursuit of flourishing for all conscious creatures.\nExperimental philosophy and neuroethics research collects data about human ethical decisions in controlled scenarios such as trolley problems. It has shown that many types of ethical judgment are universal across cultures, suggesting that they may be innate, whilst others are culture-specific. The findings show actual human ethical reasoning to be at odds with most philosophical theories, for example consistently showing distinctions between action by cause and action by omission which would be absent from utility-based theories. Cognitive science has theorized about differences between conservative and liberal ethics and how they may be based on different metaphors from family life such as strong fathers vs nurturing mother models.\nNeurotheology is a controversial field which tries to find neural correlates and mechanisms of religious experience. Some researchers have suggested that the human brain has innate mechanisms for such experiences and that living without using them for their evolved purposes may be a cause of imbalance. Studies have reported conflicting results on correlating happiness with religious belief and it is difficult to find unbiased meta-analyses.\nSociology examines value at a social level using theoretical constructs such as value theory, norms, anomie, etc. One value system suggested by social psychologists, broadly called Terror Management Theory, states that human meaning is derived from a fundamental fear of death, and values are selected when they allow us to escape the mental reminder of death.\nAlongside this, there are a number of theories about the way in which humans evaluate the positive and negative aspects of their existence and thus the value and meaning they place on their lives. For example, depressive realism posits an exaggerated positivity in all except those experiencing depressive disorders who see life as it truly is, and David Benatar theorises that more weight is generally given to positive experiences, providing bias towards an over-optimistic view of life.\nEmerging research shows that meaning in life predicts better physical health outcomes. Greater meaning has been associated with a reduced risk of Alzheimer's disease, reduced risk of heart attack among individuals with coronary heart disease, reduced risk of stroke, and increased longevity in both American and Japanese samples. There is also growing evidence for a small decline in purpose in life in the early stages of cognitive impairment.\nIn 2014, the British National Health Service began recommending a five-step plan for mental well-being based on meaningful lives, whose steps are:\nOrigin and nature of biological life.\nThe exact mechanisms of abiogenesis are unknown: notable hypotheses include the RNA world hypothesis (RNA-based replicators) and the iron-sulfur world hypothesis (metabolism without genetics). The process by which different lifeforms have developed throughout history via genetic mutation and natural selection is explained by evolution. At the end of the 20th century, based upon insight gleaned from the gene-centered view of evolution, biologists George C. Williams, Richard Dawkins, and David Haig, among others, concluded that if there is a primary function to life, it is the replication of DNA and the survival of one's genes. Responding to an interview question from Richard Dawkins about \"what it is all for\", James Watson stated \"I don't think we're \"for\" anything. We're just the products of evolution.\"\nThough scientists have intensively studied life on Earth, defining life in unequivocal terms is still a challenge. Physically, one may say that life \"feeds on negative entropy\" which refers to the process by which living entities decrease their internal entropy at the expense of some form of energy taken in from the environment. Biologists generally agree that lifeforms are self-organizing systems which regulate their internal environments as to maintain this organized state, metabolism serves to provide energy, and reproduction causes life to continue over a span of multiple generations. Typically, organisms are responsive to stimuli and genetic information changes from generation to generation, resulting in adaptation through evolution; this optimizes the chances of survival for the individual organism and its descendants respectively.\nNon-cellular replicating agents, notably viruses, are generally not considered to be organisms because they are incapable of independent reproduction or metabolism. This classification is problematic, though, since some parasites and endosymbionts are also incapable of independent life. Astrobiology studies the possibility of different forms of life on other worlds, including replicating structures made from materials other than DNA.\nAll forms of life that are in existence today possess a self-replicating informational molecule (genome), and such an informational molecule is presumably intrinsic to life. Thus the earliest forms of life also likely possessed a self-replicating informational molecule, possibly RNA or perhaps an informational molecule more primitive than RNA. The specific genomic sequences in all currently extant organisms contain order generating information that promotes survival, reproduction, and the ability to acquire resources necessary for reproduction. Sequences with such basic functions probably emerged early in the evolution of life.\nIt has been proposed that both the evolution of macroscopic order in life (including its basic functions) and the evolution of order in particular physical systems obey a common fundamental principle that was termed the Darwinian dynamic. This principal was formulated by considering, first, how macroscopic order is generated in a simple physical, non-biological system far from thermodynamic equilibrium, and then extending consideration to short RNA replicating molecules and then further to more complex forms of life. It was concluded that the fundamental order-generating process was basically similar for both types of process.\nOrigins and ultimate fate of the universe.\nThough the Big Bang theory was met with much skepticism when first introduced, it has become well-supported by several independent observations. However, current physics can only describe the early universe from around 10\u221243 seconds after the Big Bang (where zero time corresponds to infinite temperature); a theory of quantum gravity would be required to understand events before that time. Nevertheless, many physicists have speculated about what would have preceded this limit, and how the universe came into being. For example, one interpretation is that the Big Bang occurred coincidentally, and when considering the anthropic principle, it is sometimes interpreted as implying the existence of a multiverse.\nThe ultimate fate of the universe, and implicitly of humanity, is hypothesized as one in which biological life will eventually become unsustainable, such as through a Big Freeze, Big Rip, or Big Crunch.\nTheoretical cosmology studies many alternative speculative models for the origin and fate of the universe beyond the Big Bang theory. A recent trend has been models of the creation of 'baby universes' inside black holes, with our own Big Bang being a white hole on the inside of a black hole in another parent universe. Many-worlds theories claim that every possibility of quantum mechanics is played out in parallel universes.\nScientific questions about the mind.\nThe nature and origin of consciousness and the mind are also widely debated in science. The explanatory gap is generally equated with the hard problem of consciousness, and the question of free will is also considered to be of fundamental importance. These subjects are mostly addressed in the fields of cognitive science, neuroscience (e.g. the neuroscience of free will) and philosophy of mind, though some evolutionary biologists and theoretical physicists have also made several allusions to the subject.\nReductionistic and eliminative materialistic approaches, for example the Multiple Drafts Model, hold that consciousness can be wholly explained by neuroscience through the workings of the brain and its neurons, thus adhering to biological naturalism.\nOn the other hand, some scientists, like Andrei Linde, have considered that consciousness, like spacetime, might have its own intrinsic degrees of freedom, and that one's perceptions may be as real as (or even more real than) material objects. Hypotheses of consciousness and spacetime explain consciousness in describing a \"space of conscious elements\", often encompassing a number of extra dimensions. Electromagnetic theories of consciousness solve the binding problem of consciousness in saying that the electromagnetic field generated by the brain is the actual carrier of conscious experience; there is however disagreement about the implementations of such a theory relating to other workings of the mind. Quantum mind theories use quantum theory in explaining certain properties of the mind. Explaining the process of free will through quantum phenomena is an alternative to determinism.\nParapsychology.\nBased on the premises of non-materialistic explanations of the mind, some have suggested the existence of a cosmic consciousness, asserting that consciousness is actually the \"ground of all being\". Proponents of this view cite accounts of paranormal phenomena, primarily extrasensory perceptions and psychic powers, as evidence for an incorporeal higher consciousness. In hopes of proving the existence of these phenomena, parapsychologists have orchestrated various experiments, but successful results might be due to poor experimental controls and might have alternative explanations.\nNature of meaning in life.\nReker and Wong define personal meaning as the \"cognizance of order, coherence and purpose in one's existence, the pursuit and attainment of worthwhile goals, and an accompanying sense of fulfillment\" (p.\u00a0221). In 2016, Martela and Steger defined meaning as coherence, purpose, and significance. In contrast, Wong has proposed a four-component solution to the question of meaning in life, with the four components purpose, understanding, responsibility, and enjoyment (PURE):\nThus, a sense of significance permeates every dimension of meaning, rather than standing as a separate factor.\nAlthough most psychology researchers consider meaning in life as a subjective feeling or judgment, most philosophers (e.g., Thaddeus Metz, Daniel Haybron) propose that there are also objective, concrete criteria for what constitutes meaning in life. Wong has proposed that whether life is meaningful depends not only on subjective feelings but, more importantly, on whether a person's goal-striving and life as a whole is meaningful according to some objective normative standard.\nWestern philosophical perspectives.\nPhilosophical perspectives on the meaning of life are ideologies that explain life in terms of ideals or abstractions defined by humans.\nAncient Greek philosophy.\nPlatonism.\nPlato, a pupil of Socrates, was one of the earliest, most influential philosophers. His reputation comes from his idealism of believing in the existence of universals. His theory of forms proposes that universals do not physically exist, like objects, but as heavenly forms. In the dialogue of the \"Republic\", the character of Socrates describes the Form of the Good. His theory on justice in the soul relates to the idea of happiness relevant to the question of the meaning of life.\nIn Platonism, the meaning of life is in attaining the highest form of knowledge, which is the Idea (Form) of the Good, from which all good and just things derive utility and value.\nAristotelianism.\nAristotle, an apprentice of Plato, was another early and influential philosopher, who argued that ethical knowledge is not \"certain\" knowledge (such as metaphysics and epistemology), but is \"general\" knowledge. Because it is not a theoretical discipline, a person had to study and practice in order to become \"good\"; thus, if the person were to become virtuous, he could not simply study what virtue \"is\", he had to \"be\" virtuous, via virtuous activities. To do this, Aristotle established what is virtuous:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Every skill and every inquiry, and similarly, every action and choice of action, is thought to have some good as its object. This is why the good has rightly been defined as the object of all endeavor [...]Everything is done with a goal, and that goal is \"good\".\u2014\u200a\nYet, if action A is done towards achieving goal B, then goal B would have a goal, goal C, and goal C would have a goal, and so would continue this pattern until something stopped its infinite regression. Aristotle's solution is the \"Highest Good\", which is desirable for its own sake. It is its own goal. The Highest Good is not desirable for the sake of achieving some other good, and all other \"goods\" are desirable for its sake. This involves achieving \"eudaemonia\", usually translated as \"happiness\", \"well-being\", \"flourishing\", and \"excellence\".\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;What is the highest good in all matters of action? To the name, there is an almost complete agreement; for uneducated and educated alike call it happiness, and make happiness identical with the good life and successful living. They disagree, however, about the meaning of happiness.\u2014\u200a\nCynicism.\nAntisthenes, a pupil of Socrates, first outlined the themes of Cynicism, stating that the purpose of life is living a life of Virtue which agrees with Nature. Happiness depends upon being self-sufficient and mastering one's mental attitude; suffering results from false judgments of value, which cause negative emotions and a concomitant vicious character.\nThe Cynical life rejects conventional desires for wealth, power, health, and fame, by being free of the possessions acquired in pursuing the conventional. As reasoning creatures, people could achieve happiness via rigorous training, by living in a way natural to human beings. The world equally belongs to everyone, so suffering is caused by false judgments of what is valuable and what is worthless per the customs and conventions of society.\nCyrenaicism.\nAristippus of Cyrene, a pupil of Socrates, founded an early Socratic school that emphasized only one side of Socrates's teachings\u2014that happiness is one of the ends of moral action and that pleasure is the supreme good; thus a hedonistic world view, wherein bodily gratification is more intense than mental pleasure. Cyrenaics prefer immediate gratification to the long-term gain of delayed gratification; denial is unpleasant unhappiness.\nEpicureanism.\nEpicurus, a pupil of the Platonist Pamphilus of Samos, taught that the greatest good is in seeking modest pleasures, to attain tranquility and freedom from fear (ataraxia) via knowledge, friendship, and virtuous, temperate living; bodily pain (aponia) is absent through one's knowledge of the workings of the world and of the limits of one's desires. Combined, freedom from pain and freedom from fear are happiness in its highest form. Epicurus' lauded enjoyment of simple pleasures is quasi-ascetic \"abstention\" from sex and the appetites:\n\"When we say ... that pleasure is the end and aim, we do not mean the pleasures of the prodigal or the pleasures of sensuality, as we are understood to do, by some, through ignorance, prejudice or willful misrepresentation. By pleasure, we mean the absence of pain in the body and of trouble in the soul. It is not by an unbroken succession of drinking bouts and of revelry, not by sexual lust, nor the enjoyment of fish, and other delicacies of a luxurious table, which produce a pleasant life; it is sober reasoning, searching out the grounds of every choice and avoidance, and banishing those beliefs through which the greatest tumults take possession of the soul.\"\nThe Epicurean meaning of life rejects immortality and mysticism; there is a soul, but it is as mortal as the body. There is no afterlife, yet, one need not fear death, because \"Death is nothing to us; for that which is dissolved, is without sensation, and that which lacks sensation is nothing to us.\"\nStoicism.\nZeno of Citium, a pupil of Crates of Thebes, established the school which teaches that living according to reason and virtue is to be in harmony with the universe's divine order, entailed by one's recognition of the universal \"logos\", or reason, an essential value of all people. The meaning of life is \"freedom from suffering\" through \"apatheia\" (Gr: \u03b1\u03c0\u03b1\u03b8\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1), that is, being objective and having \"clear judgement\", \"not\" indifference.\nStoicism's prime directives are virtue, reason, and natural law, abided to develop personal self-control and mental fortitude as means of overcoming destructive emotions. The Stoic does not seek to extinguish emotions, only to avoid emotional troubles, by developing clear judgment and inner calm through diligently practiced logic, reflection, and concentration.\nThe Stoic ethical foundation is that \"good lies in the state of the soul\", itself exemplified in wisdom and self-control, thus improving one's spiritual well-being: \"\"Virtue\" consists in a \"will\" which is in agreement with Nature.\" The principle applies to one's personal relations thus: \"to be free from anger, envy, and jealousy\".\nEnlightenment philosophy.\nThe Enlightenment and the colonial era both changed the nature of European philosophy and exported it worldwide. Devotion and subservience to God were largely replaced by notions of inalienable natural rights and the potentialities of reason, and universal ideals of love and compassion gave way to civic notions of freedom, equality, and citizenship.\nThe meaning of life also changed, focusing less on humankind's relationship to God and more on the relationship between individuals and their society. This era has theories that equate meaningful existence with the social order.\nKantianism.\nKantianism is a philosophy based on the ethical, epistemological, and metaphysical works of Immanuel Kant. Kant is known for his deontological theory, where there is a single moral obligation, the \"Categorical Imperative\", derived from the concept of duty. Kantians believe all actions are performed in accordance with some underlying maxim or principle, and for actions to be ethical, they must adhere to the categorical imperative.\nSimply put, the test is that one must universalize the maxim\u2014i.e., imagine that all people acted this way\u2014and then see if it would still be possible to perform it in the world without contradiction. In \"Groundwork\", Kant gives the example of a person who seeks to borrow money without intending to pay it back. This is a contradiction because if it were a universal action, no person would lend money anymore, as they know that they will never be paid back. According to Kant, the maxim of this action results in a contradiction in conceivability (and thus contradicts perfect duty).\nKant also denied that the consequences of an act in any way contribute to the moral worth of that act, his reasoning being that the physical world is outside one's full control and thus one cannot be held accountable for the events that occur in it.\n19th-century philosophy.\nThe first English use of the expression \"meaning of life\" appeared in Thomas Carlyle's \"Sartor Resartus\" (1833\u2013August 1834): \"Our Life is compassed round with Necessity; yet is the meaning of Life itself no other than Freedom, than Voluntary Force: thus have we a warfare; in the beginning, especially, a hard-fought battle.\"\nUtilitarianism.\nThe origins of utilitarianism can be traced back as far as Epicurus, but, as a school of thought, it is credited to Jeremy Bentham, who found that \"nature has placed mankind under the governance of two sovereign masters, pain and pleasure\"; then, from that moral insight, he derived the \"Rule of Utility\": \"that the good is whatever brings the greatest happiness to the greatest number of people\". He defined the meaning of life as the \"greatest happiness principle\".\nJeremy Bentham's foremost proponent was James Mill, a significant philosopher in his day, and father of John Stuart Mill. The younger Mill was educated per Bentham's principles, including transcribing and summarizing much of his father's work.\nNihilism.\nNihilism suggests that life is without objective meaning.\nFriedrich Nietzsche characterized nihilism as emptying the world, and especially human existence, of meaning, purpose, comprehensible truth, and essential value; succinctly, nihilism is the process of \"the devaluing of the highest values\". Seeing the nihilist as a natural result of the idea that God is dead, and insisting it was something to overcome, his questioning of the nihilist's life-negating values returned meaning to the Earth.\nTo Martin Heidegger, nihilism is the movement whereby \"being\" is forgotten, and is transformed into value, in other words, the reduction of being to exchange value. Heidegger, in accordance with Nietzsche, saw in the so-called \"death of God\" a potential source for nihilism:\nIf God, as the supra-sensory ground and goal, of all reality, is dead; if the supra-sensory world of the Ideas has suffered the loss of its obligatory, and above it, its vitalizing and up-building power, then nothing more remains to which Man can cling, and by which he can orient himself.\nThe French philosopher Albert Camus asserts that the absurdity of the human condition is that people search for external values and meaning in a world which has none and is indifferent to them. Camus writes of value-nihilists such as Meursault, but also of values in a nihilistic world, that people can instead strive to be \"heroic nihilists\", living with dignity in the face of absurdity, living with \"secular saintliness\", fraternal solidarity, and rebelling against and transcending the world's indifference.\n20th-century philosophy.\nThe current era has seen radical changes in both formal and popular conceptions of human nature. The knowledge disclosed by modern science has effectively rewritten humankind's relationship to the natural world. Advances in medicine and technology have freed humans from significant limitations and ailments of previous eras; and philosophy\u2014particularly following the linguistic turn\u2014has altered how the relationships people have with themselves and each other are conceived. Questions about the meaning of life have also seen radical changes, from attempts to reevaluate human existence in biological and scientific terms (as in pragmatism and logical positivism) to efforts to meta-theorize about meaning-making as a personal, individual-driven activity (existentialism, secular humanism).\nPragmatism.\nPragmatism originated in the late-19th-century US, concerning itself (mostly) with truth, and positing that \"only in struggling with the environment\" do data, and derived theories, have meaning, and that \"consequences\", like utility and practicality, are also components of truth. Moreover, pragmatism posits that \"anything\" useful and practical is not always true, arguing that what most contributes to the most human good in the long run is true. In practice, theoretical claims must be \"practically verifiable\"\u2014i.e., one should be able to predict and test claims\u2014and, ultimately, the needs of humankind should guide human intellectual inquiry.\nPragmatic philosophers suggest that the practical, useful understanding of life is more important than searching for an impractical abstract truth about life. William James argued that truth could be made, but not sought. To a pragmatist, the meaning of life is discoverable only via experience.\nTheism.\nTheists believe God created the universe and that God had a purpose in doing so. Theists also hold the view that humans find their meaning and purpose for life in God's purpose in creating. Some theists further hold that if there were no God to give life ultimate meaning, value, and purpose, then life would be absurd.\nExistentialism.\nAccording to existentialism, each person creates their life's essence (meaning); life is not determined by a supernatural god or an earthly authority, but one is free. As such, one's ethical prime directives are \"action\", \"freedom\", and \"decision\", thus, existentialism opposes rationalism and positivism. In seeking meaning to life, the existentialist looks to where people find meaning in life, in course of which using only reason as a source of meaning is insufficient; this gives rise to the emotions of anxiety and dread, felt in considering one's free will, and the concomitant awareness of death. According to Jean-Paul Sartre, existence precedes essence; the (essence) of one's life arises \"only\" after one comes to existence.\nS\u00f8ren Kierkegaard spoke about a \"\", arguing that life is full of absurdity, and one must make his and her own values in an indifferent world. One can live meaningfully (free of despair and anxiety) in an unconditional commitment to something finite and devotes that meaningful life to the commitment, despite the vulnerability inherent to doing so.\nArthur Schopenhauer answered: \"What is the meaning of life?\" by stating that one's life reflects one's will, and that the will (life) is an aimless, irrational, and painful drive. Salvation, deliverance, and escape from suffering are in aesthetic contemplation, sympathy for others, and asceticism.\nFor Friedrich Nietzsche, life is worth living only if there are goals inspiring one to live. Accordingly, he saw nihilism (\"all that happens is meaningless\") as without goals. He stated that asceticism denies one's living in the world; stated that values are not objective facts, that are rationally necessary, universally binding commitments: our evaluations are interpretations, and not reflections of the world, as it is, in itself, and, therefore, all ideations take place from a particular perspective.\nAbsurdism.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"... in spite of or in defiance of the whole of existence he wills to be himself with it, to take it along, almost defying his torment. For to hope in the possibility of help, not to speak of help by virtue of the absurd, that for God all things are possible\u2014no, that he will not do. And as for seeking help from any other\u2014no, that he will not do for all the world; rather than seek the help he would prefer to be himself\u2014with all the tortures of hell if so it must be.\"\nS\u00f8ren Kierkegaard, \"The Sickness Unto Death\" \nIn absurdist philosophy, the Absurd arises out of the fundamental disharmony between the individual's search for meaning and the apparent meaninglessness of the universe. Humans have three ways of resolving the dilemma as beings looking for meaning in a meaningless world. Kierkegaard and Camus describe the solutions in their works, \"The Sickness Unto Death\" (1849) and \"The Myth of Sisyphus\" (1942):\nSecular humanism.\nPer secular humanism, the human species came to be by reproducing successive generations in a progression of unguided evolution as an integral expression of nature, which is self-existing. Human knowledge comes from human observation, experimentation, and rational analysis (the scientific method), and not from supernatural sources; the nature of the universe is what people discern it to be. Likewise, \"values and realities\" are determined \"by means of intelligent inquiry\" and \"are derived from human need and interest as tested by experience\", that is, by critical intelligence. \"As far as we know, the total personality is [a function] of the biological organism transacting in a social and cultural context.\"\nPeople determine human purpose without supernatural influence; it is the human personality (general sense) that is the purpose of a human being's life which humanism seeks to develop and fulfill: \"Humanism affirms our ability and responsibility to lead ethical lives of personal fulfillment that aspire to the greater good of humanity\". Humanism aims to promote enlightened self-interest and the common good for all people. It is based on the premises that the happiness of the individual person is inextricably linked to the well-being of all humanity, in part because humans are social animals who find meaning in personal relations and because cultural progress benefits everybody living in the culture.\nThe philosophical subgenres posthumanism and transhumanism (sometimes used synonymously) are extensions of humanistic values. One should seek the advancement of humanity and of all life to the greatest degree feasible and seek to reconcile Renaissance humanism with the 21st century's technoscientific culture. In this light, every living creature has the right to determine its personal and social \"meaning of life\".\nFrom a humanism-psychotherapeutic point of view, the question of the meaning of life could be reinterpreted as \"What is the meaning of \"my\" life?\" This approach emphasizes that the question is personal\u2014and avoids focusing on cosmic or religious questions about overarching purpose. There are many therapeutic responses to this question. For example, Viktor Frankl argues for \"Dereflection\", which translates largely as to cease endlessly reflecting on the self; instead, engage in life. On the whole, the therapeutic response is that the question itself\u2014what is the meaning of life?\u2014evaporates when one is fully engaged in life. (The question then morphs into more specific worries such as \"What delusions am I under?\"; \"What is blocking my ability to enjoy things?\"; \"Why do I neglect loved-ones?\".)\nLogical positivism.\nLogical positivists ask: \"What is the meaning of life?\", \"What is the meaning in asking?\" and \"If there are no objective values, then, is life meaningless?\" Ludwig Wittgenstein and the logical positivists said: \"Expressed in language, the question is meaningless\"; because, \"in\" life the statement the \"meaning of x\", usually denotes the \"consequences\" of x, or the \"significance\" of x, or \"what is notable\" about x, etc., thus, when the meaning of life concept equals \"x\", in the statement the \"meaning of x\", the statement becomes recursive, and, therefore, nonsensical, or it might refer to the fact that biological life is essential to having a meaning in life.\nThe things (people, events) in the life of a person can have meaning (importance) as parts of a whole, but a discrete meaning of (the) life itself, aside from those things, cannot be discerned. A person's life has meaning (for themselves, others) as the life events resulting from their achievements, legacy, family, etc., but, to say that life, itself, has meaning, is a misuse of language, since any note of significance, or of consequence, is relevant only \"in\" life (to the living), so rendering the statement erroneous. Bertrand Russell wrote that although he found that his distaste for torture was not like his distaste for broccoli, he found no satisfactory, empirical method of proving this:\nWhen we try to be definite, as to what we mean when we say that this or that is \"the Good,\" we find ourselves involved in very great difficulties. Bentham's creed, that pleasure is the Good, roused furious opposition, and was said to be a pig's philosophy. Neither he nor his opponents could advance any argument. In a scientific question, evidence can be adduced on both sides, and, in the end, one side is seen to have the better case\u2014or, if this does not happen, the question is left undecided. But in a question, as to whether this, or that, is the ultimate Good, there is no evidence, either way; each disputant can only appeal to his own emotions, and employ such rhetorical devices as shall arouse similar emotions in others ... Questions as to \"values\"\u2014that is to say, as to what is good or bad on its own account, independently of its effects\u2014lie outside the domain of science, as the defenders of religion emphatically assert. I think that, in this, they are right, but, I draw the further conclusion, which they do not draw, that questions as to \"values\" lie wholly outside the domain of knowledge. That is to say, when we assert that this, or that, has \"value\", we are giving expression to our own emotions, not to a fact, which would still be true if our personal feelings were different.\nPostmodernism.\nPostmodernist thought\u2014broadly speaking\u2014sees human nature as constructed by language or structures and institutions of human society. Unlike other forms of philosophy, postmodernism rarely seeks out \"a priori\" or innate meanings in human existence, but instead focuses on analyzing or critiquing \"given\" meanings in order to rationalize or reconstruct them. Anything resembling a \"meaning of life\", in postmodernist terms, can only be understood within a social and linguistic framework and must be pursued as an escape from the power structures already embedded in all forms of speech and interaction. As a rule, postmodernists see awareness of the constraints of language as necessary to escaping those constraints, but different theorists take different views on the nature of this process: from a radical reconstruction of meaning by individuals (as in deconstructionism) to theories in which individuals are primarily extensions of language and society, without real autonomy (as in poststructuralism).\nNaturalistic pantheism.\nAccording to naturalistic pantheism, the meaning of life is to care for and look after nature and the environment.\nEmbodied cognition.\nEmbodied cognition uses the neurological basis of emotion, speech, and cognition to understand the nature of thought. Cognitive neuropsychology has identified brain areas necessary for these abilities, and genetic studies show that the gene FOXP2 affects neuroplasticity, which underlies language fluency.\nGeorge Lakoff, a professor of cognitive linguistics and philosophy, advances the view that metaphors are the usual basis of meaning, not the logic of verbal symbol manipulation. Computers use logic programming to effectively query databases, but humans rely on a trained biological neural network. Postmodern philosophies that use the indeterminacy of symbolic language to deny definite meaning ignore those who feel they know what they mean and feel that their interlocutors know what they mean. Choosing the correct metaphor results in enough common understanding to pursue questions such as the meaning of life. Improved knowledge of brain function should result in better treatments producing healthier brains. When combined with more effective training, a sound personal assessment as to the meaning of one's life should be straightforward.\nEast Asian philosophical perspectives.\nMohism.\nThe Mohist philosophers believed that the purpose of life was universal, impartial love. Mohism promoted a philosophy of impartial caring\u2014a person should care equally for all other individuals, regardless of their actual relationship with them. The expression of this indiscriminate caring makes one righteous in Mohist thought. This advocacy of impartiality was a target of attack by the other Chinese philosophical schools, most notably the Confucians who believed that while love should be unconditional, it should not be indiscriminate. For example, children should hold a greater love for their parents than for random strangers.\nConfucianism.\nConfucianism recognizes human nature in accordance with the need for discipline and education. Because humankind is driven by both positive and negative influences, Confucianists see a goal in achieving virtue through strong relationships and reasoning, as well as minimizing the negative. This emphasis on normal living is seen in the Confucianist scholar Tu Wei-Ming's quote, \"We can realize the ultimate meaning of life in ordinary human existence.\"\nLegalism.\nThe Legalists believed that finding the purpose of life was a meaningless effort. To the Legalists, only practical knowledge was valuable, especially as it related to the function and performance of the state.\nReligious perspectives.\nThe religious perspectives on the meaning of life are those ideologies that explain life in terms of an implicit purpose not defined by humans. According to the Charter for Compassion, signed by many of the world's leading religious and secular organizations, the core of religion is the golden rule of \"treat others as you would have them treat you\". Karen Armstrong, founder of the Charter, recalls the teaching of Rabbi Hillel recorded in Shabbat 31a:6 of the Talmud: the essence of the Torah is simply to be good to others; \"everything else is just commentary.\" This is not to reduce the commentary's importance, and Armstrong considers that its study, interpretation, and ritual are the means by which religious people internalize and live the golden rule.\nAbrahamic religions.\n[[File:ReligionSymbolAbr.PNG|thumb|upright|left|Symbols of the three largest Abrahamic religions: [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], and [[Islam]].]]\nJudaism.\nIn the [[Judaism]] and its [[Jewish philosophy|philosophy]], the meaning of life is to elevate the physical world () and prepare it for the [[Messianic Age#Judaism|Messianic Age]] ( and [[Jewish eschatology#World to Come|World to Come]] (). Engaging in \"[[tikkun olam]]\" () is a component of bringing [[Jewish eschatology]] to bear. \"Olam ha-ba\" can also refer more generally to the afterlife, and there is debate concerning the order of Jewish eschatological events. However, while personal salvation is a component of Judaism, communal (between humans) and individual (between humans and God) spiritualised actions in this world are its focus.\nJudaism's defining feature is the worship of a single, incomprehensible, [[transcendence (religion)|transcendent]], unified, and indivisible [[God in Judaism|absolute Being]] who created and governs the universe. Closeness with the God of [[Jewish peoplehood|Israel]] is sought through [[Jewish prayer|prayer]], [[Torah study]], Jewish cultural rites, and adherence to God's \"[[mitzvot]]\" (divine laws). In traditional Judaism, God established a special [[Covenant (Israel)|covenant]] with the people of Israel during the [[theophany at Sinai]], giving the [[613 mitzvot]]. \"Torah\" comprises the [[written Torah]] and the transcribed [[Oral Torah]], further developed through the generations, as well as the other books of the [[Tanakh]], the [[Midrash]], other [[Rabbinic literature]], and \"[[Halakha]]\". The Jewish people are intended as \"a kingdom of priests and a holy nation\" and a \"[[Light Unto the Nations|light to the Nations]]\", influencing the other peoples to keep their own religio-ethical [[Seven Laws of Noah]]. The messianic era is seen as the perfection of this dual path to God.\nJewish observance involves ethical and ritual, affirmative, and prohibitive injunctions. Modern [[Jewish denominations]] differ over the nature, relevance, and emphases of \"mitzvot\". [[Jewish philosophy]] emphasises that God is not affected or benefited, but the individual and society benefit by drawing close to God. The rationalist [[Maimonides]] viewed the ethical and ritual divine commandments as a necessary but insufficient foundation for a philosophical understanding of God, along with its love and awe. Among fundamental [[Jewish ethics|values]] in the Torah are the pursuit of justice, compassion, peace, kindness, hard work, prosperity, humility, and education. The world to come, prepared in the present, elevates religious Jews to an everlasting connection with God. [[Simeon the Just]] says, \"The world stands on three things: on Torah, on worship, and on acts of loving kindness.\" The [[Siddur|prayer book]] relates, \"Blessed is our God who created us for his honor ... and planted within us everlasting life.\" In this context, the [[Talmud]] states, \"Everything that God does is for the good,\" including suffering.\nThe Jewish mystical [[Kabbalah]] gives complementary esoteric meanings of life. As well as Judaism providing an [[Divine immanence|immanent]] relationship with God (personal [[theism]]), in Kabbalah, the spiritual and physical creation is a paradoxical manifestation of the immanent aspects of God's Being ([[panentheism]]), related to the [[Shekhinah]] (Divine feminine). Jewish observance unites the [[sephirot]] (Divine attributes) on high, restoring harmony to creation. In [[Lurianic Kabbalah]], the meaning of life is the messianic rectification of the shattered sparks of God's persona, exiled in physical existence (the [[Kelipot]] shells), through the actions of Jewish observance. Through this, in [[Hasidic Judaism]] the ultimate essential \"desire\" of God is the revelation of the Omnipresent Divine essence through materiality, achieved by a man from within his limited physical realm when the body will give life to the soul.\nChristianity.\n[[File:Christ the Redeemer - Cristo Redentor.jpg|thumb|upright|\"[[Christ the Redeemer (statue)|Christ the Redeemer]]\" statue in [[Rio de Janeiro]] is symbolic of Christianity, illustrating the concept of seeking [[redemption (theology)|redemption]] through [[Jesus Christ]].]]\n[[Christianity]] has its roots in Judaism, and shares much of the latter faith's [[ontology]]. Its central beliefs derive from the teachings of [[Jesus Christ]] as presented in the [[New Testament]]. Life's purpose in Christianity is to seek divine [[Salvation in Christianity|salvation]] through the grace of God and intercession of Christ. The New Testament speaks of God wanting to have a relationship with humans both in this life and the life to come, which can happen only if one's [[Atonement in Christianity|sins are forgiven]].\nIn the Christian view, humankind was made in the [[Image of God]] and perfect, but the [[Fall of Man]] caused the progeny of the [[Adam and Eve|First Parents]] to inherit [[Original Sin]] and its consequences. Christ's [[Passion of Jesus|passion]], [[Crucifixion of Jesus|death]] and [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]] provide the means for transcending that impure state ([[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] 6:23). That this restoration from sin is possible is called the [[gospel]].\nThe Apostle Paul explains the meaning of life in his speech on the [[Areopagus]] in [[Athens]]: \"And He has made from one blood every nation of men to dwell on all the face of the earth, and has determined their preappointed times and the boundaries of their dwellings, so that they should seek the Lord, in the hope that they might grope for Him and find Him, though He is not far from each one of us.\"\nDenominations.\nThe specific process of appropriating salvation through Christ and maintaining a relationship with God varies between different [[List of Christian denominations|denominations]] of Christians, but all rely on faith in Christ and the gospel as the fundamental starting point. Salvation through faith in God is found in [[Epistle to the Ephesians|Ephesians]] 2:8\u20139[8] \"For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God;[9] not as a result of works, that no one should boast.\" ([[New American Standard Bible|NASB]]; 1973). The gospel maintains that through this belief, the barrier that sin has created between man and God is destroyed, thereby allowing believers to be [[Regeneration (theology)|regenerated]] by God and to instill in them a new heart after God's own will with the ability to live righteously before him. This is what the term [[Salvation in Christianity|saved]] almost always refer to.\nIn Reformed theology, it is believed the purpose of life is to glorify God. In the \"[[Westminster Shorter Catechism]]\", an important creed for Reformed Christians, the first question is: \"What is the chief end of Man?\" (that is, \"What is Man's main purpose?\"). The answer is: \"Man's chief end is to glorify God, and enjoy him forever\". God requires one to obey the revealed moral law, saying: \"Love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your strength, and with all your mind; and your neighbour as yourself\". The \"[[Baltimore Catechism]]\" answers the question \"Why did God make you?\" by saying \"God made me to know Him, to love Him, and to serve Him in this world, and to be happy with Him forever in heaven.\"\n[[Catholicism]]'s meaning of life is explained in Catechism of the Catholic Church paragraph 294. The Universe exists for the manifestation and communication of God's glory, while mankind exists for the [[beatific vision]]. Catechism of the Catholic Church 601 explains the meaning of Jesus' life: to fulfill the Scripture, in particular the plan of salvation.\n[[Mormonism]] teaches that the purpose of life on Earth is to gain knowledge and experience and to have joy. Mormons believe that humans are literally the spirit children of God the Father, and thus have the potential to progress to become like Him. Mormons teach that God provided his children the choice to come to Earth, which is considered a crucial stage in their development\u2014wherein a mortal body, coupled with the freedom to choose, makes for an environment to learn and grow. The Fall of Adam is not viewed as an unfortunate or unplanned cancellation of God's original plan for a paradise; rather, the opposition found in mortality is an essential element of God's plan because the process of enduring and overcoming challenges, difficulties, and temptations provides opportunities to gain wisdom and strength, thereby learning to appreciate and choose good and reject evil. Because God is just, he allows those who were not taught the gospel during mortality to receive it after death in the spirit world, so that all of his children have the opportunity to return to live with God, and reach their full potential.\nA recent alternative Christian theological discourse interprets Jesus as revealing that the purpose of life is to elevate our compassionate response to human suffering; nonetheless, the conventional Christian position is that people are justified by belief in the [[Propitiation|propitiatory sacrifice]] of Jesus' death on the cross.\nIslam.\n[[File:Supplicating Pilgrim at Masjid Al Haram. Mecca, Saudi Arabia.jpg|thumb|Supplicating [[Pilgrim]] at [[Masjid Al Haram]]. [[Mecca]]]]\nIn [[Islam]], humanity's ultimate purpose is to worship their creator, [[Allah]] (), through his signs, and be grateful to him through sincere love and devotion. This is practically shown by following the divine guidelines revealed in the [[Qur'an]] and the tradition of the [[Muhammad|Prophet]] (with the exception of [[Quranism|Quranists]]). Earthly life is a test, determining one's position of closeness to [[Allah]] in the hereafter. A person will either be close to him and his love in \"[[Jannah]]\" (Paradise) or far away in \"[[Jahannam]]\" (Hell).\nFor Allah's satisfaction, via the Qur'an, all Muslims must believe in God, his revelations, his [[Angels in Islam|angels]], his [[Prophets in Islam|messengers]], and in the \"[[Qiyamah|Day of Judgment]]\". The Qur'an describes the purpose of creation as follows: \"Blessed be he in whose hand is the kingdom, he is powerful over all things, who created death and life that he might examine which of you is best in deeds, and he is the almighty, the forgiving.\" (Qur'an 67:1\u20132) and \"And I (All\u00e2h) created not the jinn and mankind except that they should be obedient (to Allah).\" (Qur'an 51:56). Obedience testifies to the [[Tawhid|oneness of God]] in his lordship, his names, and his attributes. Terrenal life is a test; how one \"acts\" (behaves) determines whether one's soul goes to Jannat (Heaven) or to Jahannam (Hell). However, on the day of Judgement the final decision is of Allah alone.\nThe [[Five Pillars of Islam]] are duties incumbent to every Muslim; they are: [[Shahada]]h (profession of faith); [[Salah|Salat]] (ritual prayer); [[Zakat]] (charity); [[Sawm]] (fasting during [[Ramadan]]), and [[Hajj]] (pilgrimage to [[Mecca]]). They derive from the [[Hadith]] works, notably of [[Sahih Al-Bukhari]] and [[Sahih Muslim]]. The five pillars are not mentioned directly in the Quran.\nBeliefs differ among the [[Kalam]]. The [[Sunni]] and the [[Ahmadiyya]] concept of pre-destination is [[Qadr (doctrine)|divine decree]]; the [[Shi'a]] concept of pre-destination is [[Adalah (Islam)|divine justice]]; in the [[esoteric]] view of the [[Sufi]]s, the universe exists only for God's pleasure; Creation is a grand game, wherein Allah is the greatest prize.\nThe Sufi view of the meaning of life stems from the [[hadith qudsi]] that states \"I (God) was [[a Hidden Treasure]] and loved to be known. Therefore I created the Creation that I might be known.\" One possible interpretation of this view is that the meaning of life for an individual is to know the nature of God, and the purpose of all of creation is to reveal that nature and to prove its value as the ultimate treasure, that is God. However, this hadith is stated in various forms and interpreted in various ways by people, such, as [['Abdu'l-Bah\u00e1]] of the [[Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith]], and in [[Ibn Arabi|Ibn'Arab\u012b]]'s Fu\u1e63\u016b\u1e63 al-\u1e24ikam. According to Shaykh [[Ibrahim Niass]], worship of God is closely linked to [[ma'rifa]], therefore the perfection of the aspirant's knowledge of God is conditional upon his attainment of ma'rifa.\nBah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith.\nThe [[Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith]] emphasizes the unity of humanity. To Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds, the purpose of life is focused on spiritual growth and service to humanity. Human beings are viewed as intrinsically spiritual beings. People's lives in this material world provide extended opportunities to grow, to develop divine qualities and virtues, and the [[Manifestation of God (Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith)|prophets]] were sent by God to facilitate this.\nSouth Asian religions.\nHindu philosophies.\n[[File:Golden Aum.png|thumb|upright|left|A golden [[Om|Aum]] written in [[Devanagari]]. The Aum is sacred in [[Hinduism|Hindu]], [[Jainism|Jain]] and [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] religions.]]\n[[Hinduism]] is a religious category including many beliefs and traditions. Since Hinduism was the way of expressing meaningful living for a long time before there was a need for naming it as a separate religion, Hindu doctrines are supplementary and complementary in nature, generally non-exclusive, suggestive, and tolerant in content. Most believe that the [[\u0100tman (Hinduism)|\u0101tman]] (spirit, soul)\u2014the person's true \"self\"\u2014is eternal. In part, this stems from Hindu beliefs that spiritual development occurs across many lifetimes, and goals should match the state of development of the individual. There are four possible aims to human life, known as the \"[[purusharthas]]\" (ordered from least to greatest): (i) \"[[K\u0101ma]]\" (wish, desire, love and sensual pleasure), (ii) \"[[Artha]]\" (wealth, prosperity, glory), (iii) \"[[Dharma]]\" (righteousness, duty, morality, [[virtue]], [[ethics]]), encompassing notions such as \"[[ahimsa]]\" (non-violence) and [[satya]] (truth) and (iv) \"[[Moksha]]\" (liberation, i.e. liberation from [[Sa\u1e43s\u0101ra]], the cycle of [[reincarnation]]).\nIn all schools of Hinduism, the meaning of life is tied up in the concepts of [[karma]] (causal action), [[sansara]] (the cycle of birth and rebirth), and [[moksha]] (liberation). Existence is conceived as the progression of the \u0101tman (similar to the western concept of a [[Soul (spirit)|soul]]) across numerous lifetimes, and its ultimate progression towards liberation from karma. Particular goals for life are generally subsumed under broader [[yoga]]s (practices) or [[dharma]] (correct living) which are intended to create more favorable reincarnations, though they are generally positive acts in this life as well. Traditional schools of Hinduism often worship [[Deva (Hinduism)|Devas]] which are manifestations of [[Ishvara]] (a personal or chosen God); these Devas are taken as ideal forms to be identified with, as a form of spiritual improvement.\nIn short, the goal is to realize the fundamental truth about oneself. This thought is conveyed in the [[Mah\u0101v\u0101kyas]] (\"[[Tat Tvam Asi]]\" (thou art that), \"Aham Brahm\u0101smi\", \"Praj\u00f1\u0101nam Brahma\" and \"Ayam \u0100tm\u0101 Brahma\" (This \u0100tman is Brahman)).\nAdvaita and Dvaita Hinduism.\nLater schools reinterpreted the [[vedas]] to focus on [[Brahman]], \"The One Without a Second\", as a central God-like figure.\nIn [[monist]] Advaita Vedanta, \u0101tman is ultimately indistinguishable from Brahman, and the goal of life is to know or realize that one's [[\u0100tman (Hinduism)|\u0100tman]] (soul) is identical to [[Brahman]]. To the [[Upanishads]], whoever becomes fully aware of the \u0100tman, as one's core of self, realizes identity with Brahman, and, thereby, achieves [[Moksha]] (liberation, freedom).\nDvaita Vedanta and other [[bhakti]] schools have a [[Theistic dualism|dualist]] interpretation. [[Brahman]] is seen as a supreme being with a personality and manifest qualities. The \u0100tman depends upon Brahman for its existence; the meaning of life is achieving Moksha through the love of God and upon His grace.\nVaishnavism.\n[[Vaishnavism]] is a branch of Hinduism in which the principal belief is the identification of [[Vishnu]] or [[Narayana]] as the one supreme God. This belief contrasts with the [[Krishnaism|Krishna-centered]] traditions, such as [[Vallabha]], [[Nimbaraka]] and [[Gaudiya]], in which [[Krishna]] is considered to be the One and only Supreme God and the [[Svayam Bhagavan|source of all avataras]].\nVaishnava theology includes the central beliefs of Hinduism such as [[monotheism]], [[reincarnation]], [[samsara]], [[karma]], and the various [[Yoga]] systems, but with a particular emphasis on devotion ([[bhakti]]) to Vishnu through the process of [[Bhakti yoga]], often including singing Vishnu's name's ([[bhajan]]), meditating upon his form ([[dharana]]) and performing [[deity]] worship ([[puja (Hinduism)|puja]]). The practices of deity worship are primarily based on texts such as [[Pa\u00f1caratra]] and various [[Samhita]]s.\nOne popular school of thought, [[Gaudiya Vaishnavism]], teaches the concept of [[Achintya Bheda Abheda]]. In this, Krishna is worshipped as the single true God, and all living entities are eternal parts and the Supreme Personality of the Godhead Krishna. Thus the constitutional position of a living entity is to serve the Lord with love and devotion. The purpose of human life especially is to think beyond the animalistic way of eating, sleeping, mating, and defending and engage the higher intelligence to revive the lost relationship with Krishna.\nJainism.\n[[Jainism]] is a religion originating in [[Iron Age India|ancient India]], its ethical system promotes self-discipline above all else. Through following the [[asceticism|ascetic]] teachings of [[Tirthankara|Jina]], a [[human]] achieves [[Moksa (Jainism)|enlightenment (perfect knowledge)]]. Jainism divides the universe into living and non-living beings. Only when the living becomes attached to the non-living does suffering result. Therefore, happiness is the result of self-conquest and freedom from external objects. The meaning of life may then be said to be to use the physical body to achieve self-realization and bliss.\nJains believe that every human is responsible for his or her actions and all living beings have an eternal [[Soul (spirit)|soul]], \"[[jiva]]\". Jains believe all souls are equal because they all possess the potential of being liberated and attaining [[Moksa (Jainism)|Moksha]]. The [[Karma in Jainism|Jain view of karma]] is that every action, every word, every thought has effect on the soul.\nJainism includes strict adherence to [[Ahimsa in Jainism|ahimsa]] (or \"ahins\u0101\"), a form of [[nonviolence]] that goes far beyond [[vegetarianism]]. Jains refuse food obtained with unnecessary cruelty. Many practice a lifestyle similar to [[veganism]] due to the violence of modern dairy farms, and others exclude [[root vegetable]]s from their diets in order to preserve the lives of the plants from which they eat.\nBuddhism.\nEarly Buddhism.\n[[File:Tian Tan Buddha by Beria.jpg|thumb|Statue of [[Gautama Buddha]]]]\nBuddhists practice embracing mindfulness, the ill-being (suffering) and well-being that is present in life. Buddhists practice seeing the causes of ill-being and well-being in life. For example, one of the causes of suffering is an unhealthy attachment to objects material or non-material. The Buddhist [[s\u016btras]] and [[Tantras (Buddhism)|tantras]] do not speak about \"the meaning of life\" or \"the purpose of life\", but about the potential of human life to end suffering, for example through embracing (not suppressing or denying) cravings and conceptual attachments. Attaining and perfecting dispassion is a process of many levels that ultimately results in the state of [[Nirvana]]. Nirvana means freedom from both [[Dukkha|suffering]] and [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|rebirth]].\n[[Theravada|Theravada Buddhism]] is generally considered to be close to the early Buddhist practice. It promotes the concept of [[Vibhajjavada]] ([[P\u0101li|Pali]]), literally \"Teaching of Analysis\", which says that insight must come from the aspirant's experience, critical investigation, and reasoning instead of by blind faith. However, the Theravadin tradition also emphasizes heeding the advice of the wise, considering such advice and evaluation of one's own experiences to be the two tests by which practices should be judged. The Theravadin goal is liberation (or freedom) from suffering, according to the [[Four Noble Truths]]. This is attained in the achievement of [[Nirvana]], or Unbinding which also ends the [[reincarnation|repeated cycle]] of birth, old age, sickness, and death. The way to attain Nirvana is by following and practicing the [[Noble Eightfold Path]].\nMahayana Buddhism.\nMahayana Buddhist schools de-emphasize the traditional view (still practiced in [[Theravada]]) of the release from individual Suffering ([[Du\u1e25kha|Duhkha]]) and attainment of Awakening ([[Nirvana]]). In Mahayana, the Buddha is seen as an eternal, immutable, inconceivable, [[omnipresent]] being. The fundamental principles of Mahayana doctrine are based on the possibility of universal liberation from suffering for all beings, and the existence of the transcendent [[Buddha-nature]], which is the eternal Buddha essence present, but hidden and unrecognised, in all living beings.\nDevotional schools such as [[Pure Land Buddhism]] seek the aid of celestial buddhas\u2014individuals who have spent lifetimes accumulating positive karma, and use that accumulation to aid all.\nSikhism.\nThe followers of Sikhism are ordained to follow the teachings of the ten [[Sikh Gurus]], or enlightened leaders, as well as the holy scripture entitled the \"[[Gur\u016b Granth S\u0101hib]]\", which includes selected works of many philosophers from diverse socio-economic and religious backgrounds.\nThe Sikh Gurus say that salvation can be obtained by following various spiritual paths, so Sikhs do not have a monopoly on salvation: \"The Lord dwells in every heart, and every heart has its own way to reach Him.\" Sikhs believe that all people are equally important before [[Waheguru|God]]. Sikhs balance their moral and spiritual values with the quest for knowledge, and they aim to promote a life of peace and equality but also of positive action.\nA key distinctive feature of Sikhism is a non-[[Anthropomorphism#In religion and mythology|anthropomorphic]] concept of God, to the extent that one can interpret God as the [[Universe]] itself ([[pantheism]]). Sikhism thus sees life as an opportunity to understand this God as well as to discover the divinity which lies in each individual. While a full understanding of God is beyond human beings, [[Guru Nanak Dev|Nanak]] described God as not wholly unknowable, and stressed that God must be seen from \"the inward eye\", or the \"heart\", of a human being: devotees must [[meditate]] to progress towards enlightenment and the ultimate destination of a Sikh is to lose the ego completely in the love of the lord and finally merge into the almighty creator. Nanak emphasized the revelation through meditation, as its rigorous application permits the existence of communication between God and human beings.\nEast Asian religions.\nTaoism.\n[[Taoist]] [[cosmogony]] emphasizes the need for all sentient beings and all men to return to the \"primordial\" or to rejoin with the \"Oneness\" of the Universe by way of self-cultivation and self-realization. All adherents should understand and be in tune with the ultimate truth.\nTaoists believe all things were originally from [[Taiji (philosophy)|Taiji]] and [[Tao]], and the meaning in life for the adherents is to realize the temporal nature of the existence. \"Only introspection can then help us to find our innermost reasons for living ... the simple answer is here within ourselves.\"\nShinto.\n[[Shinto]] is the native religion of Japan. Shinto means \"the path of the [[kami]]\", but more specifically, it can be taken to mean \"the divine crossroad where the kami chooses his way\". The \"divine\" crossroad signifies that all the universe is divine spirit. This foundation of [[free will]], choosing one's way, means that life is a creative process.\nShinto wants life to live, not to die. Shinto sees death as pollution and regards life as the realm where the divine spirit seeks to purify itself by rightful self-development. Shinto wants individual human life to be prolonged forever on earth as a victory of the divine spirit in preserving its objective personality in its highest forms. The presence of evil in the world, as conceived by Shinto, does not stultify the divine nature by imposing on divinity responsibility for being able to relieve human suffering while refusing to do so. The sufferings of life are the sufferings of the divine spirit in search of progress in the objective world.\nNew religions.\nThere are many [[new religious movements]] in East Asia, and some with millions of followers: [[Chondogyo]], [[Tenrikyo]], [[Cao \u0110\u00e0i]], and [[Seicho-No-Ie]]. New religions typically have unique explanations for the meaning of life. For example, in Tenrikyo, one is expected to live a [[Joyous Life]] by participating in practices that create happiness for oneself and others.\nIranian religions.\nZoroastrianism.\nZoroastrians believe in a universe created by a transcendent God, [[Ahura Mazda]], to whom all worship is ultimately directed. Ahura Mazda's creation is \"[[asha]]\", truth and order, and it is in conflict with its [[antithesis]], \"druj\", falsehood and disorder.\nSince humanity possesses [[free will]], people must be responsible for their moral choices. By using free will, people must take an active role in the universal conflict, with good thoughts, good words and good deeds to ensure happiness and to keep chaos at bay.\nPopular views.\n\"What is the meaning of life?\" is a question many people ask themselves at some point during their lives, most in the context \"What is the purpose of life?\". Some popular answers include:\nIn popular culture.\nThe mystery of life and its true meaning is an often recurring subject in [[popular culture]], featured in [[mass media|entertainment media]] and [[the arts|various forms]] of art.\n\"[[Monty Python's The Meaning of Life]]\" includes a character played by [[Michael Palin]] being handed an envelope containing \"the meaning of life\", which she opens and reads out to the audience: \"Well, it's nothing very special. Uh, try to be nice to people, avoid eating fat, read a good book every now and then, get some walking in, and try to live together in peace and harmony with people of all creeds and nations.\"\nIn [[Douglas Adams]]' book \"[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]\", the [[Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything]] is given the numeric solution \"[[42 (number)|42]]\", after seven and a half million years of calculation by a giant [[supercomputer]] called [[Minor characters from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy#Deep Thought|Deep Thought]]. When this answer is met with confusion and anger from its constructors, Deep Thought explains that \"I think the problem such as it was, was too broadly based. You never actually stated what the question was.\" Deep Thought then constructs another computer\u2014the Earth\u2014to calculate what the Ultimate Question actually is. Later Ford and Arthur manage to extract the question as the Earth computer would have rendered it. That question turns out to be \"what do you get if you multiply six by nine\", and it is realised that [[Garbage in, garbage out|the program was ruined by the unexpected arrival of the Golgafrinchans]] on Earth, and so the actual Ultimate Question of Life, The Universe, And Everything remains unknown.\nIn [[Person of Interest (TV series)|\"Person of Interest\"]] season 5 episode 13, an artificial intelligence referred to as The Machine tells Harold Finch that the secret of life is \"Everyone dies alone. But if you mean something to someone, if you help someone, or love someone. If even a single person remembers you then maybe you never really die at all.\" This phrase is then repeated at the very end of the show to add emphasis to the finale.\nRelated concepts.\nExistential crisis.\n[[File:Allisvanity.jpg|thumb|[[Charles Allan Gilbert]]'s \"All is Vanity,\" an example of \"[[vanitas]],\" depicts a young woman amidst her makeup and perfumes, preoccupied with her own beauty at the mirror of her [[Vanity table|vanity]]. But all is positioned in such a way as to make the image of a skull appear, expressing \"[[memento mori]]\", that no matter how good she looks, it won't last, as death is inevitable.]]\n[[Existential crises]] are crises of meaning. They are triggered by the impression that life lacks meaning. This impression can lead to an inner conflict because there is a strong [[desire]] to find some form of meaning in life. In the [[Existentialism|existentialist]] literature, the discrepancy between the individual's desire for meaning and the world's apparent lack thereof is termed [[Absurdism|the absurd]]. It may be summarized by the question \"How does a being who needs meaning find meaning in a universe that has no meaning?\". While this conflict may affect different people at least to some extent, it reaches a more severe level in the case of existential crises. This level leads to various negative [[experiences]], such as [[Stress (biology)|stress]], [[anxiety]], despair, and [[Depression (mood)|depression]]. In the more serious cases, these symptoms disturb the individual's normal functioning in everyday life. A positive side effect of these negative experiences is that they push the affected individual to address the underlying issue. This opens the opportunity of [[Personal development|developing as a person]] and improving one's way of life.\nTherapists often try to treat existential crises by helping their patients discover meaning in life. An important distinction in this regard is the difference between personal meaning and cosmic meaning. In the cosmic sense, the term \"meaning of life\" refers to the purpose of the world as a whole or why we are here. One way to solve an existential crisis is to discover a satisfying answer to this question. This often takes the form of a [[religious]] explanation involving a divine entity that created the world for a certain purpose. Another approach to solving existential crises is to seek meaning not on the cosmic but on the personal level. This usually takes a more secular form: the therapist helps the individual realize what matters to them or why their life is worth living. In this regard, they may discover how their personal life can be meaningful, for example, by dedicating themselves to their family or their career. This approach may mitigate or solve an existential crisis even if the individual still lacks an answer to the bigger question of the deeper meaning behind everything.\nImportance.\nThe question of the meaning of life is closely related to the question of what has [[importance]] or what matters. This is reflected in the fact that finding meaning in life is often associated with dedicating oneself to some kind of higher purpose, which is seen as having special importance. Nonetheless, some theorists have argued that the two concepts are not identical. This distinction is often motivated by the observation that seeking the meaning of life is usually regarded as an admirable goal associated with [[self-transcendence]]. Craving importance, on the other hand, seems to be a more [[Egoism|egoistic]] or [[Narcissism|narcissistic]] aim in comparison.\nVarious theorists have argued that to be important means to have an impact on the world or to make a difference. Some only require that this causal impact is big enough. Others include as an additional element that the difference in question has to affect the value of the world. This is often interpreted with reference to [[well-being]]: the degree of importance of a thing is given by the extent to which it affects the well-being of sentient entities. However, the relation to a purpose is usually not required for importance. In this regard, some things may be important accidentally or [[Intention|unintentionally]] without being guided by a higher goal. For example, a person may by chance bump into something and thereby unwittingly trigger a [[butterfly effect]] of extreme proportions. In such a case, the person's life has acquired high importance due to the consequences it caused. Nonetheless, this does not imply that it has also acquired some form of deeper meaning or higher purpose.\nAnother difference is that seeking and realizing the meaning of life is usually seen by most theorists as a positive and worthwhile undertaking. Importance, however, can be either positive or negative depending on the type of value difference involved. For example, [[Alexander Fleming]] was important in a positive sense since his discovery of [[penicillin]] helped many people cure their [[bacterial infection]]s. [[Adolf Hitler]], on the other hand, was important in a negative sense since his policies caused widespread suffering to innumerous people.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n[[Category:Metaphysical properties]]\n[[Category:Existentialist concepts]]\n[[Category:Philosophical problems]]\n[[Category:Philosophy of life]]\n[[Category:Religious philosophical concepts]]\n[[Category:Teleology]]"}
{"id": "20348", "revid": "13286072", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20348", "title": "Margaret River, Western Australia", "text": "&lt;templatestyles src=\"Infobox_Australian_place/styles.css\"/&gt;\nMargaret River is a large town in the South West of Western Australia, located in the valley of the eponymous Margaret River, south of Perth, the state capital. Its Local Government Area is the Shire of Augusta-Margaret River.\nMargaret River's coast to the west of the town is a renowned surfing location with worldwide fame for its surf breaks including, but not limited to, 'Main Break' and 'The Box'. Colloquially, the area is referred to as \"Margs\".\nThe surrounding area is the Margaret River wine region and is known for its wine production and tourism, attracting an estimated 500,000 visitors annually.\nHistory.\nThe town is named after the river, which is presumed to be named after Margaret Whicher, cousin of John Garrett Bussell (founder of Busselton) in 1831. The name is first shown on a map of the region published in 1839. Before British settlement the area was inhabited by the Noongar people. The first British settlers arrived as early as 1850, with timber logging commencing in around 1870. By 1910, the town had a hotel which also operated as a post office. That year the Margaret River Progress Association requested that a townsite be declared at \"the Upper Margaret Bridge\", because \"the district is likely to be dotted with public buildings several miles apart in the near future if a townsite is not made available shortly\". The inspecting district surveyor had a preference for an area near the lower bridge on Caves Road, but his preferred site was unavailable. Lots were surveyed in 1912 and the townsite was gazetted in 1913. From 1918 to 1927, the name of the townsite was officially \"Margaret\" but it was changed back to \"Margaret River\" due to local usage.\nAfter World War I, an attempt by the Government of Western Australia to attract migrants to Western Australia (known as the Group Settlement Scheme) and establish farms in the region attracted new settlers to the town. In 1922, over 100 settlers moved into the district.\nIn the early 1920s, the Busselton to Margaret River Railway was built and, in 1925, the Margaret River to Flinders Bay line opened.\nThe Perimeter Road, a bypass to take traffic, including heavy vehicles, from Bussell Highway, to the east of the town, and also connect to a new access road to the nearby airport, was opened in December 2018 and completed in February 2019.\nGeography and climate.\nMargaret River is located inland from the Indian Ocean at a point about halfway between Cape Naturaliste and Cape Leeuwin in Western Australia's South West region.\nThe climate is warm-summer Mediterranean (\"Csb\" in the K\u00f6ppen climate classification), with an average annual rainfall of around . Most rain falls between May and August, when around two days in three record measurable rainfall and around one in ten over . On occasions, as in August 1955, the town has had measurable rain on every day of a month in this period. During the summer, the weather is warm, though there are usually sea breezes, and it is frequently sunny. The dry summers, coupled with strong winds, creates an environment where there is always a high risk of bush fires.\nWine region.\nMargaret River is the foremost Geographical Indication wine region in the South West Australia Zone, with nearly under vine and over 138 wineries as at 2008. The region is made up predominantly of boutique-size wine producers, although winery operations range from the smallest, crushing per year, to the largest at around . The region produces just three percent of total Australian grape production, but commands over 20 percent of the Australian premium wine market.\nStretching some from north to south and about wide in parts, the region is bounded to the east by the Leeuwin-Naturaliste Ridge, between Cape Naturaliste and Cape Leeuwin, and to the west by the Indian Ocean. A Mediterranean-style climate, lacking extreme summer and winter temperatures, provides ideal growing conditions. The climate is described as similar to that of Bordeaux in a dry vintage.\nHumidity levels are ideal during the growing period and the combination of climate, soil and viticulture practices leads to consistently high quality fruit of intense flavour. Consequently, annual vintage results continue to exceed expectations and reinforce Margaret River's reputation as one of the premium wine-producing regions of the world.\nThe principal grape varieties in the region are fairly evenly split between red and white; Cabernet Sauvignon, Chardonnay, Sauvignon blanc, Shiraz, Merlot, Chenin blanc and Verdelho.\nCaves.\nSeveral hundred caves are located near Margaret River, all of them within Leeuwin-Naturaliste National Park. Six of these are open to the public.\nOne of these caves is the multi-chambered Mammoth Cave, which lies south of the town and contains fossils dating back over 35,000 years. The cave was first discovered by European settlers in 1850 and has been open to the public since 1904. The cave can be explored by a self-guided audio tour, and is one of the few caves in Australia offering partial disabled access.\nThe other five caves open to the public in the area are Jewel Cave, Lake Cave, Ngilgi Cave, Calgardup Cave and Giants Cave. Many other caves can be accessed with a permit by experienced cavers.\nSurfing breaks.\nThe Margaret River area has acquired a range of synonyms for the collection of surf breaks nearby, with some 75 breaks along of coastline. Usually significant surfing competitions concentrate their locale to \"Margarets Main Break\" (aka Surfers Point) which breaks in the vicinity of Prevelly at the mouth of Margaret River.\nThe actual range of surf breaks range from the eastern side of Cape Naturaliste down to just south of Cape Hamelin, and despite web sites and online sources calling the whole Cape Naturaliste to Cape Leeuwin region the \"Margaret River\" surfing area, conditions and break types vary along the coast.\nThe Cowaramup Bombora (\"Cow Bombie\") big wave surf break offshore produces one of the biggest waves in Australia.\nEducation.\nThe town contains four primary schools, Margaret River Primary School, Rapids Landing Primary School, Margaret River Montessori School, and St Thomas More Catholic Primary School, and one high school, Margaret River Senior High School. All schools are located within the town itself except for Rapids Landing Primary School, which is located in the suburb of Rapids Landing.\nMedia.\nRadio stations that broadcast to the town are ABC South West WA, Triple M Southwest and Radio Margaret River, a community-based, not-for-profit station that provides local news, information, and entertainment which broadcast on 101.9 FM and also online. \nLocal newspapers are \"Augusta-Margaret River Times\" and \"Augusta-Margaret River Mail\". \nTelevision services available include:\nCultural events.\nThe WSL Margaret River Pro is held annually in May attracting professional surfers from across the globe. The CinefestOZ film festival stages several events across the region in late August each year.\nIn the media.\nArte-TV produced an episode of \"Nouveaux paradis\" about Margaret River. The 2008 documentary shows interviews with (amongst others) tourist officials, surfers, and dolphin watchers.\nMargaret River was also visited in the 1966 documentary film \"The Endless Summer\". In 2013, many locals featured in the film \"Drift\", starring Sam Worthington, as well as many surfing scenes being shot on location at local surf breaks such as Grunters and Main Break.\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "20351", "revid": "9155723", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20351", "title": "Maginot Line", "text": "Line of fortifications along the French/German border\nThe Maginot Line (; ), named after the French Minister of War Andr\u00e9 Maginot, is a line of concrete fortifications, obstacles and weapon installations built by France in the 1930s. The line was to deter invasion by Nazi Germany and force them to move around the fortifications through Belgium. It was impervious to most forms of attack and in 1940 the Germans invaded through the Low Countries, passing it to the north. The line, which was supposed to be extended further towards the west to avoid such an occurrence, was not built in response to demands from Belgium. Belgium feared it would be sacrificed in the event of another German invasion. The line has since become a metaphor for expensive efforts that offer a false sense of security.\nConstructed on the French side of its borders with Italy, Switzerland, Germany, Luxembourg and Belgium, the line did not extend to the English Channel. French strategy was to move into Belgium to counter a German assault. Based on France's experience with trench warfare during World War I, the massive Maginot Line was built before the Second World War, after the Locarno Conference in 1925 gave rise to a fanciful and optimistic \"Locarno spirit\". French military experts believed the line would deter German aggression because it would slow an invasion force long enough for French forces to mobilise and counter-attack.\nThe Maginot Line was invulnerable to aerial bombings and tank fire and used underground railways for movement. It had modern living conditions for the garrison, with air conditioning and eating areas for their comfort. French and British officers had anticipated the geographical limits of the Maginot Line; when Germany invaded the Netherlands and Belgium, they carried out the Dyle Plan to form a front along the Dyle in Belgium to connect with the Maginot Line.\nThe French line was weak near the Ardennes. General Maurice Gamelin, when drafting the Dyle Plan, believed this region, with its rough terrain, would be an unlikely invasion route by German forces; if it were traversed, it would be done at a slow rate that would allow the French time to bring up reserves and counter-attack. The German Army, having altered their plans when it became known to the Allies in the Mechelen incident on 10 January 1940 redirected the effort against this weak point in the French defensive front. The Manstein plan replaced the original plan with a gamble that the main German armoured force could cross the Ardennes and cross the Meuse before the Allies could react. The Germans crossed the Meuse and raced down the Somme river valley, encircled much of the Allied forces in the north, leading to the Dunkirk evacuation and leaving the troops to the south unable to mount an effective resistance to the Germans.\nPurposes.\nThe Maginot Line was built to fulfill several purposes:\nManning.\nMaginot Line fortifications were manned by specialist units of fortress infantry, artillery and engineers. The infantry manned the lighter weapons of the fortresses and formed units with the mission of operating outside if necessary. Artillery troops operated the heavy guns, and the engineers were responsible for maintaining and operating other specialist equipment, including all communications systems. All these troops wore distinctive uniform insignia and considered themselves among the elite of the French Army. During peacetime, fortresses were only partly manned by full-time troops. They would be supplemented by reservists who lived in the local area and who could be quickly mobilised in an emergency.\nFull-time Maginot Line troops were accommodated in barracks built close to the fortresses. They were also accommodated in complexes of wooden housing adjacent to each fortress, which were more comfortable than living inside, but were not expected to survive wartime bombardment. The training was carried out at a fortress near the town of Bitche in Moselle in Lorraine, built in a military training area and so capable of live fire exercises. This was impossible elsewhere as the other parts of the line were located in civilian areas.\nOrganisation.\nAlthough the name \"Maginot Line\" suggests a relatively thin linear fortification, it was deep from the German border to the rear area. It was composed of an intricate system of strong points, fortifications and military facilities such as border guard posts, communications centres, infantry shelters, barricades, artillery, machine-gun and anti-tank-gun emplacements, supply depots, infrastructure facilities and observation posts. These various structures reinforced a \"principal line of resistance\" made up of the most heavily armed \"ouvrages\", which can be roughly translated as fortresses or big defensive works.\nBorder post line.\nThis consisted of blockhouses and strong-houses, which were often camouflaged as residential homes, built within a few metres of the border and manned by troops to give the alarm in the event of a surprise attack and to delay enemy tanks with prepared explosives and barricades.\nOutpost and support point line.\nApproximately behind the border there was a line of anti-tank blockhouses that were intended to provide resistance to armoured assault, sufficient to delay the enemy and allow time for the crews of the \"C.O.R.F. ouvrages\" to be ready at their battle stations. These outposts covered the main passages within the principal line.\nPrincipal line of resistance.\nThis line began behind the border. It was preceded by anti-tank obstacles made of metal rails planted vertically in six rows, with heights varying from and buried to a depth of . These anti-tank obstacles extended from end to end in front of the main works, over hundreds of kilometres, interrupted only by extremely dense forests, rivers, or other nearly impassable terrains.\nThe anti-tank obstacle system was followed by an \"anti-personnel obstacle\" system made primarily of dense barbed wire. \"Anti-tank road barriers\" also made it possible to block roads at necessary points of passage through the tank obstacles.\nInfantry casemates.\nThese bunkers were armed with twin machine-guns (abbreviated as \"JM\" \u2014 \"Jumelage de mitrailleuses\" \u2014 in French) and anti-tank guns of . They could be single (with a firing room in one direction) or double (two firing rooms in opposite directions). These generally had two floors, with a firing level and a support/infrastructure level that provided the troops with rest and services (power-generating units, reserves of water, fuel, food, ventilation equipment, etc.). The infantry casemates often had one or two \"cloches\" or turrets located on top of them. These GFM cloches were sometimes used to emplace machine guns or observation periscopes. 20 to 30 men manned them.\n\"Petits ouvrages\".\nThese small fortresses reinforced the line of infantry bunkers. The \"petits ouvrages\" were generally made up of several infantry bunkers, connected by a tunnel network with attached underground facilities, such as barracks, electric generators, ventilation systems, mess halls, infirmaries and supply caches. Their crew consisted of between 100 and 200 men.\n\"Gros ouvrages\".\nThese fortresses were the most important fortifications on the Maginot Line, having the sturdiest construction and the heaviest artillery. These were composed of at least six \"forward bunker systems\" or \"combat blocks\" and two entrances and were connected via a network of tunnels that often had narrow gauge electric railways for transport between bunker systems. The blocks contained infrastructure such as power stations, independent ventilating systems, barracks and mess halls, kitchens, water storage and distribution systems, hoists, ammunition stores, workshops and spare parts and food stores. Their crews ranged from 500 to more than 1,000 men.\nObservation posts.\nThese were located on hills that provided a good view of the surrounding area. Their purpose was to locate the enemy, direct and correct the indirect fire of artillery, and report on the progress and position of critical enemy units. These are large reinforced buried concrete bunkers, equipped with armoured turrets containing high-precision optics, connected with the other fortifications by field telephone and wireless transmitters (known in French by the acronym T.S.F., \"T\u00e9l\u00e9graphie Sans Fil\").\nTelephones.\nThis system connected every fortification in the Maginot Line, including bunkers, infantry and artillery fortresses, observation posts and shelters. Two telephone wires were placed parallel to the line of fortifications, providing redundancy in case a wire was cut. There were places along the cable where dismounted soldiers could connect to the network.\nInfantry reserve shelters.\nThese were found from behind the principal line of resistance. These were buried concrete bunkers designed to house and shelter up to a company of infantry (200 to 250 men). They had amenities such as electric generators, ventilation systems, water supplies, kitchens and heating, which allowed their occupants to hold out in the event of an attack. They could also be used as a local headquarters and counterattack base.\nFlood zones.\nFlood zones were natural basins or rivers that could be flooded on demand and thus constitute an additional obstacle in the event of an enemy offensive.\nSafety quarters.\nThese were built near the major fortifications so fortress (\"ouvrage\") crews could reach their battle stations in the shortest possible time in the event of a surprise attack during peacetime.\nNarrow-gauge railway system.\nA network of narrow-gauge railways was built to rearm and resupply the main fortresses (\"ouvrages\") from supply depots up to away. Petrol-engined armoured locomotives pulled supply trains along these narrow-gauge lines. (A similar system was developed with armoured steam engines in 1914\u20131918.)\nHigh-voltage transmission lines.\nInitially above-ground but then buried, and connected to the civil power grid, these provided electric power to the many fortifications and fortresses.\nHeavy rail artillery.\nThis was hauled by locomotives to planned locations to support the emplaced artillery in the fortresses, which was intentionally limited in range to .\nInventory.\nOuvrages.\nThere are 142 \"ouvrages\", 352 casemates, 78 shelters, 17 observatories and around blockhouses in the Maginot Line.\nArmoured cloches.\nThere are several kinds of armoured cloches. Cloches are non-retractable turrets. The word \"cloche\" is a French term meaning \"bell\" due to its shape. All cloches were made of alloy steel.\nRetractable turrets.\nThe line included the following retractable turrets. \nArtillery.\nBoth static and mobile artillery units were assigned to defend the Maginot Line. \"R\u00e9giments d'artillerie de position\" (RAP) consisted of static artillery units. \"R\u00e9giments d'artillerie mobile de forteresse\" (RAMF) consisted of mobile artillery.\nHistory.\nPrelude.\nIn January 1923, after Weimar Germany defaulted on reparations, the French Premier, Raymond Poincar\u00e9, sent French troops to occupy the Ruhr. During the (Ruhr struggle) between the Germans and the French that lasted until September 1923, Britain condemned the Occupation of the Ruhr. A period of sustained Francophobia broke out in Britain, with Poincar\u00e9 being vilified in Britain as a bully, punishing Germany with unreasonable reparations demands. The British\u2014who openly championed the German position on reparations\u2014applied intense economic pressure on France to change its policies towards Germany. At a conference in London in 1924 to settle the Franco-German crisis caused by the , the British Prime Minister, Ramsay MacDonald, persuaded the French Premier, \u00c9douard Herriot, to make concessions to Germany. The British diplomat, Sir Eric Phipps, who attended the conference, commented afterwards that\nThe London Conference was for the French 'man in the street' one long Calvary as he saw M. Herriot abandoning one by one the cherished possessions of French preponderance on the Reparations Commission, the right of sanctions in the event of German default, the economic occupation of the Ruhr, the French\u2013Belgian railway and finally, the military occupation of the Ruhr within a year.\nThe great conclusion that was drawn in Paris after the and the 1924 London Conference was that France could not make unilateral military moves to uphold Versailles as British hostility to such moves was too dangerous to the republic. Beyond that, the French were well aware of the contribution of Britain and its dominions to the victory of 1918. French leaders believed they needed Britain's help to win another war; the French must appease the British. From 1871, French elites had concluded that France had no hope of defeating Germany on its own, and France would need an alliance with another great power to prevail.\nAllied Control Commission.\nIn 1926, \"The Manchester Guardian\" ran an expos\u00e9 showing the had been developing military technology forbidden by the Treaty of Versailles in the Soviet Union. The secret German\u2013Soviet cooperation started in 1921. The German statement following \"The Manchester Guardian\"'s article that Germany did not feel bound by the terms of Versailles and would violate them as much as possible gave much offence in France. In 1927, the Inter-Allied Commission, which was responsible for ensuring that Germany complied with Part V of the Treaty of Versailles, was abolished as a goodwill gesture, reflecting the \"Spirit of Locarno\". When the Control Commission was dissolved, the commissioners in their final report issued a condemnation, that Germany had never sought to abide by Part V and the had been engaging in covert rearmament all through the 1920s. Under the Treaty of Versailles, France was to occupy the Rhineland region of Germany until 1935. Still, the last French troops left the Rhineland in June 1930 in exchange for Germany accepting the Young Plan. As long as the French occupied the Rhineland, it served as a type of collateral under which the French would annex the Rhineland in the event of Germany breaching any of the articles of the treaty, such as rearmament; this threat was powerful enough to deter German governments all through the 1920s from attempting any overt violation of Part V. French plans as developed by Marshal Ferdinand Foch in 1919 were based on the assumption that in the event of a war with the \"Reich\", the French forces in the Rhineland were to embark upon an offensive to seize the Ruhr. A variant of the Foch plan had been used by Poincar\u00e9 in 1923 when he ordered the French occupation of the Ruhr.\nFrench planning.\nFrench plans for an offensive in the 1920s were realistic, as Versailles had forbidden German conscription, and the \"Reichswehr\" was limited to 100,000 men. Once the French forces left the Rhineland in 1930, this form of leverage with the Rhineland as collateral was no longer available to Paris, which from then on had to depend on Berlin's word that it would continue to abide by the terms of the Versailles and Locarno treaties, which stated that the Rhineland was to stay demilitarised forever. Given that Germany had engaged in covert rearmament with the co-operation of the Soviet Union starting in 1921 (a fact that had become public knowledge in 1926) and that every German government had gone out of its way to insist on the moral invalidity of Versailles, claiming it was based upon the so-called (war guilt lie) that Germany started the war in 1914, the French had little faith that the Germans would willingly allow the Rhineland's demilitarised status to continue forever, and believed that at some time in the future, Germany would rearm in violation of Versailles, reintroduce conscription and remilitarise the Rhineland. The decision to build the Maginot Line in 1929 was a tacit French admission that without the Rhineland as collateral, Germany was soon going to rearm and that the terms of Part V had a limited lifespan.\nGerman economy.\nAfter 1918, the German economy was twice as large as that of France; Germany had a population of 70 million compared to France's 40 million, and the French economy was hobbled by the need to reconstruct the enormous damage of World War I, while German territory had seen little fighting. French military chiefs were dubious about their ability to win another war against Germany without allies, especially an offensive war. French leaders knew that the victory of 1918 had been achieved because Russia, the British Empire and the United States were allies in the war and that the French would have been defeated on their own. With the United States isolationist and Britain stoutly refusing to make the \"continental commitment\" to defend France on the same scale as in World War I, the prospects of Anglo-American assistance in another war with Germany appeared to be doubtful at best. Versailles did not call for military sanctions in the event of the German military reoccupying the Rhineland or breaking Part V, while Locarno committed Britain and Italy to come to French aid in the event of a \"flagrant violation\" of the Rhineland's demilitarised status, it did not define what a \"flagrant violation\" would be. The British and Italian governments refused in diplomatic talks to define \"flagrant violation\", which led the French to place little hope in Anglo\u2013Italian help if German military forces should reoccupy the Rhineland. Given the diplomatic situation in the late 1920s, the \"Quai d'Orsay\" informed the government that French military planning should be based on a worst-case scenario that France would fight the next war against Germany without the help of Britain or the United States.\nFrance had an alliance with Belgium and with the states of the \"Cordon sanitaire\", as the French alliance system in Eastern Europe was known. Although the alliances with Belgium, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Romania and Yugoslavia were appreciated in Paris, it was widely understood that this was no compensation for the absence of Britain and the United States. The French military was especially insistent that the population disparity made an offensive war of manoeuvre and swift advances suicidal, as there would always be far more German divisions; a defensive strategy was needed to counter Germany. The French assumption was always that Germany would not go to war without conscription, which would allow the German Army to take advantage of the \"Reich\"'s numerical superiority. Without the natural defensive barrier provided by the Rhine River, French generals argued that France needed a new defensive barrier made of concrete and steel to replace it. The power of properly dug-in defensive trenches had been amply demonstrated during World War I, when a few soldiers manning a single machine gun post could kill hundreds of the enemy in the open and therefore building a massive defensive line with subterranean concrete shelters was the most rational use of French manpower.\nThe American historian, William Keylor, wrote that in the diplomatic conditions of 1929 and likely trends \u2013 with the United States isolationist and Britain unwilling to make the \"continental commitment\" \u2013 the decision to build the Maginot Line was not irrational and stupid but a sensible response to the problems that would be created by the coming French withdrawal from the Rhineland in 1930. Part of the rationale for the Maginot Line stemmed from the severe French losses during the First World War and their effect on the French population. The drop in the birth rate during and after the war, resulting in a national shortage of young men, created an \"echo\" effect on the generation that provided the French conscript army in the mid-1930s. Faced with a manpower shortage, French planners had to rely more on older and less fit reservists, who would take longer to mobilise and would diminish French industry because they would leave their jobs. Static defensive positions were therefore intended to delay a German invasion and to economise on men by defending an area with fewer and less mobile forces. In 1940, France deployed about twice as many men, 36 divisions (roughly one third of its force), for the defence of the Maginot Line in Alsace and Lorraine. In contrast, the opposing German Army Group C only contained 19 divisions, fewer than a seventh of the force committed in the Manstein Plan for the invasion of France. Reflecting memories of World War I, the French General Staff had developed the concept of \"la puissance du feu\" (\"the power of fire\"), the power of artillery dug in and sheltered by concrete and steel, to inflict devastating losses on an attacking force.\nLong war strategy.\nFrench planning for war with Germany was always based on the assumption that the war would be a long war, in which the superior economic resources of the Allies would gradually grind the Germans down. The fact that the \"Wehrmacht\" embraced the strategy of Bewegungskrieg (war of manoeuvre) with the vision of swift wars in which Germany would win quickly via a knockout blow was a testament to the fundamental soundness of the concept of . Germany had the largest economy in Europe but lacked many of the raw materials necessary for a modern industrial economy, making the \"Reich\" vulnerable to blockade and the ability to feed its population. The strategy called for the French to halt the expected German offensive, denying the Germans a swift victory; afterwards, there would be an attrition struggle; once the Germans were exhausted, France would begin an offensive to win the war.\nThe Maginot Line was intended to block the main German blow if it should come via eastern France and divert it through Belgium, where French forces would meet and stop the Germans. The Germans were expected to fight costly offensives, whose failures would sap the strength of the \"Reich\", while the French waged a total war, mobilising the resources of France, its empire and allies. Besides the demographic reasons, a defensive strategy served the needs of French diplomacy towards Great Britain. The French imported a third of their coal from Britain and 32 per cent of all imports through French ports were carried by British ships. Of French trade, 35 per cent was with the British Empire and the majority of the tin, rubber, jute, wool and manganese used by France came from the British Empire.\nAbout 55 per cent of overseas imports arrived in France via the Channel ports of Calais, Le Havre, Cherbourg, Boulogne, Dieppe, Saint-Malo and Dunkirk. Germany had to import most of its iron, rubber, oil, bauxite, copper and nickel, making naval blockade a devastating weapon against the German economy. For economic reasons, the success of the strategy of \"la guerre de longue dur\u00e9e\" would at the very least require Britain to maintain a benevolent neutrality, preferably to enter the war as an ally as British sea power could protect French imports while depriving Germany of hers. A defensive strategy based on the Maginot Line was an excellent way of demonstrating to Britain that France was not an aggressive power and would only go to war in the event of German aggression, a situation that would make it more likely that Britain would enter the war on France's side.\nThe Maginot line.\nStudies made by the General Staff in 1919 were reported to the (CSG, Supreme War Council) in 1920 and a commission of 1922, chaired by Marshal Joseph Joffre reported in December 1925, in favour of centres of resistance built in peacetime, not a continuous fortified front. From 17 December 1926 to 12 October 1927, the Frontier Defence Commission reported to the CSG that fortifications should be built from Metz to Thionville and Longwy, to protect the Moselle Valley and the mineral resources and industry of Lorraine. The area around the Lauter, the most north-eastern part of the common border with Germany, should be fortified as an obvious invasion route but there was no need to fortify the Rhine, because of the Vosges mountains further west and the small number of railways on the German side. Belfort was near the Swiss frontier and partly protected by the Rhine but there was an avenue of invasion to the west, which should be protected. The commission gave emphasis to defence against a surprise attack, with the limited objective of capturing the Metz and Lauter areas.\nThe commission recommended that priority be given to protecting the resources and industries of Lorraine that were vital for the French economy and would become more important for a war economy. The nature of fixed defences was debated during the 1920s, with advocates of the offensive use of fortifications, deep or shallow defences and centralised and decentralised designs. On 12 October 1927, the CSG adopted the system recommended by P\u00e9tain, of large and elaborately fortified defences from Metz to Thionville and Longwy, at Lauter and Belfort, on the north-east frontier, with covered infantry positions between the main fortifications. Andr\u00e9 Maginot, the Minister of War (1922\u20131924, 1929\u20131930 and 1931\u20131932) became the driving force for obtaining the money to fortify the north-eastern frontier, sufficient to resist a German invasion for three weeks, to give time for the French army to mobilise. Work began in 1929 on the (Metz Fortified Region) through the Moselle valley to the Nied at Teting-sur-Nied, then the , east of Hagenau from Bitche to the Rhine, the extension of the Metz region to Longuyon and the Lauter river region from Bitche to the Sarre (Saar) at Wittring.\nRequirements for the fortifications were natural cover, sites nearby for observation posts, the minimum of dead ground, a maximum arc of fire, ground suitable for anti-tank obstacles and infantry positions and ground on which paved roads could be built, to eliminate wheel marks. were to be built near the frontier as permanently garrisoned works, whose men would alert the army, blow bridges and erect roadblocks, for which materials were dumped. About back were concrete with permanent garrisons armed with 47 mm or 65 mm guns, intended to delay an attacker so that buried casemates and (fortresses) further back could be manned. Artificial obstacles of 4 to 6 rows of upright railway line, -long set in concrete and of random depth and covered by barbed wire. A barbed wire obstruction further back covered a field of anti-tank mines overlooked by twin machine-guns and anti-tank guns in casemates. The casemates were distributed in series and were the only defensive works along the Rhine; on other stretches, casemates were interspersed with , every . Interval Troops of infantry, gunners, engineers and mechanised light cavalry with field artillery, could manoeuvre between the fortifications, advancing to defend casemate approaches to relieve outposts or retiring to protect fortress entrances; the troops provided continuity, depth and mobility to the static defences.\nThe line was built in several phases from 1930 by the \"Service Technique du G\u00e9nie\" (STG), overseen by \"Commission d'Organisation des R\u00e9gions Fortifi\u00e9es\" (CORF). The main construction was largely completed by 1939, at the cost of around 3 billion French francs (around 3.9 billion U.S. dollars). The line stretched from Switzerland to Luxembourg and a much lighter extension was extended to the Strait of Dover after 1934. The original construction did not cover the area ultimately chosen by the Germans for their first challenge, which was through the Ardennes in 1940, a plan known as \"Fall Gelb\" (Case Yellow), due to the neutrality of Belgium. The location of this attack, chosen because of the location of the Maginot Line, was through the Belgian Ardennes Forest (sector 4), which is off the map to the left of Maginot Line sector 6 (as marked).\nFeatures.\nThe specification of the defences was very high, with extensive and connected bunker complexes for thousands of men; there were 45 main forts (\"grands ouvrages\") at intervals of , 97 smaller forts (\"petits ouvrages\") and 352 casemates between, with over of tunnels. Artillery was coordinated with protective measures to ensure that one fort could support the next in line by bombarding it directly without harm. The largest guns were, therefore fortress guns; larger weapons were to be part of the mobile forces and were to be deployed behind the lines.\nThe fortifications did not extend through the Ardennes Forest (which was believed to be impenetrable by Commander-in-Chief Maurice Gamelin) or along France's border with Belgium because the two countries had signed an alliance in 1920, by which the French army would operate in Belgium if the German forces invaded. However, after France had failed to counter the German Remilitarization of the Rhineland, Belgium\u2014thinking that France was not a reliable ally\u2014abrogated the treaty in 1936 and declared neutrality. France quickly extended the Maginot Line along the Franco-Belgian border, but not to the standard of the rest of the line. As the water table in this region is high, there was the danger of underground passages flooding, which the architects knew would be difficult and expensive to overcome.\nIn 1939 U.S. Army officer Kenneth Nichols visited the Metz sector, where he was impressed by the formidable formations which he thought the Germans would have to outflank by driving through Belgium. In discussion with General Brousseau, the commander of the Metz sector and other officers, the general outlined the French problem in extending the line to the sea in that placing the line along the Belgian-German border required the agreement of Belgium, but putting the line along the French-Belgian border relinquished Belgium to the Germans. Another complication was Holland, and the various governments never resolved their problems.\nWhen the British Expeditionary Force landed in France in September 1939, they and the French reinforced and extended the Maginot line to the sea in a flurry of construction from 1939 to 1940, accompanied by general improvements all along the line. The final line was strongest around the industrial regions of Metz, Lauter and Alsace, while other areas were, in comparison, only weakly guarded. In contrast, the propaganda about the line made it appear far greater a construction than it was; illustrations showed multiple storeys of interwoven passages and even underground rail yards and cinemas that reassured allied civilians.\nCzechoslovakia.\nCzechoslovakia also feared Hitler and began building its own defences. As an ally of France, they got advice on the Maginot design and applied it to Czechoslovak border fortifications. The design of the casemates is similar to the ones found in the southern part of the Maginot Line, and photographs of them are often confused with Maginot forts. Following the Munich Agreement and the German occupation of Czechoslovakia, the Germans were able to use the Czech fortifications to plan attacks that proved successful against the western fortifications (the Belgian Fort Eben-Emael is the best-known example).\nGerman invasion in World War II.\nThe World War II German invasion plan of 1940 (\"Sichelschnitt\") was designed to deal with the line. A decoy force sat opposite the line while a second Army Group cut through the Low Countries of Belgium and the Netherlands, as well as through the Ardennes, which lay north of the main French defences. Thus the Germans were able to avoid a direct assault on the Maginot Line by violating the neutrality of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands. Attacking on 10 May, German forces were well into France within five days and they continued to advance until 24 May, when they stopped near Dunkirk.\nDuring the advance to the English Channel, the Germans overran France's border defence with Belgium and several Maginot Forts in the Maubeuge area whilst the Luftwaffe simply flew over it. On 19 May, the German 16th Army captured the isolated petit ouvrage La Fert\u00e9 (south-east of Sedan) after conducting a deliberate assault by combat engineers backed up by heavy artillery, taking the fortifications in only four days. The entire French crew of 107 soldiers was killed during the action. On 14 June 1940, the day Paris fell, the German 1st Army went over to the offensive in \"Operation Tiger\" and attacked the Maginot Line between St Avold and Saarbr\u00fccken.\nThe Germans then broke through the fortification line as defending French forces retreated southward. In the following days, infantry divisions of the 1st Army attacked fortifications on each side of the penetration, capturing four petits ouvrages. The 1st Army also conducted two attacks against the Maginot Line further to the east in northern Alsace. One attack broke through a weak section of the line in the Vosges Mountains, but the French defenders stopped a second attack near Wissembourg. On 15 June, infantry divisions of the German 7th Army attacked across the Rhine River in Operation \"Small Bear\", deeply penetrating the defences and capturing the cities of Colmar and Strasbourg.\nBy early June, the German forces had cut off the line from the rest of France, and the French government was making overtures for an armistice, which was signed on 22 June in Compi\u00e8gne. As the line was surrounded, the German Army attacked a few ouvrages from the rear but was unsuccessful in capturing any significant fortifications. The main fortifications of the line were still mostly intact, many commanders were prepared to hold out, and the Italian advance had been contained. Nevertheless, Maxime Weygand signed the surrender instrument and the army was ordered out of their fortifications to be taken to POW camps.\nWhen the Allied forces invaded in June 1944, the line, now held by German defenders, was again largely bypassed; fighting touched only portions of the fortifications near Metz and in northern Alsace towards the end of 1944. During the German offensive Operation Nordwind in January 1945, Maginot Line casemates and fortifications were utilised by Allied forces, especially in the Bas-Rhin department in Grand Est, and some German units had been supplemented with flamethrower tanks in anticipation of this possibility. In January 1945 von Luck with the 21st Panzer Division was tasked with cutting through the old Maginot Line defences and severing Allied links with Strasbourg as part of Operation Nordwind. He was told there were no plans available of the Line but that it was \"barely manned and constituted no obstacle\". However they came up against fierce resistance and concentrated American artillery fire. They had to withdraw on 6 January 1945 and again after another attack on 8 January, although they drove a \"tiny wedge\" into the Line. Stephen Ambrose wrote that in January 1945, \"a part of the line was used for the purpose it had been designed for and showed what a superb fortification it was.\" Here the Line ran east-west, around the villages of Rittershoffen and Hatten, south of Wissembourg.\nAfter World War II.\nAfter the war, the French re-manned the line and undertook some modifications. With the advent of French nuclear weapons in the early 1960s, the line became an expensive anachronism. Some of the larger \"ouvrages\" were converted to command centres. When France withdrew from NATO's military component in 1966, much of the line was abandoned, with the NATO facilities turned back over to French forces and the rest of it auctioned off to the public or left to decay. A number of old fortifications have now been turned into wine cellars, a mushroom farm, and even a disco. Besides that, a few private houses are built atop some blockhouses.\nOuvrage Rochonvillers was retained by the French Army as a command centre into the 1990s but was deactivated following the disappearance of the Soviet threat. Ouvrage Hochwald is the only facility in the main line that remains in active service as a hardened command facility for the French Air Force known as Drachenbronn Airbase.\nIn 1968, when scouting locations for \"On Her Majesty's Secret Service\", producer Harry Saltzman used his French contacts to gain permission to use portions of the Maginot Line as SPECTRE headquarters in the film. Saltzman provided art director Syd Cain with a tour of the complex. Still, Cain said that the location would be challenging to light and film inside and that artificial sets could be constructed at the studios for a fraction of the cost. The idea was shelved.\nPostwar assessment.\nIn analysing the Maginot Line, Ariel Ilan Roth summarised its main purpose: it was not \"as popular myth would later have it, to make France invulnerable\", but it was constructed to make the appeal of flanking the French \"far outweigh the appeal of attacking them head on\". J.E. Kaufmann and H.W. Kaufmann added that before construction in October 1927, the Superior Council of War adopted the final design for the line and identified that one of the main missions would be to deter a German cross-border assault with only minimal force to allow \"the army time to mobilise.\" In addition, the French envisioned that the Germans would conduct a repeat of their First World War battle plan to flank the defences and drew up their overall strategy with that in mind.\nJulian Jackson highlighted one of the line's roles was to facilitate that strategy by \"free[ing] manpower for offensive operations elsewhere... and to protect the forces of manoeuvre\"; the latter included a more mechanised and modernised military, which would advance into Belgium and engage the German main thrust flanking the line. In support, Roth commented that the French strategy envisioned one of two possibilities by advancing into Belgium: \"either there would be a decisive battle in which France might win, or, more likely, a front would develop and stabilise\". The latter meant the next war's destructive consequences would not take place on French soil.\nPostwar assessment of whether the Maginot Line served its purpose has been mixed. Its enormous cost and its failure to prevent German forces from invading France have caused journalists and political commentators to remain divided on whether the line was worthwhile.\nThe historian Clayton Donnell commented, \"If one believes the Maginot Line was built for the primary purpose of stopping a German invasion of France, most will consider it a massive failure and a waste of money... in reality, the line was not built to be the ultimate saviour of France\". Donnell argued that the primary purpose of \"prevent[ing] a concerted attack on France through the traditional invasion routes and to permit time for the mobilisation of troops... was fulfilled\", as was the French strategy of forcing the Germans to enter Belgium, which ideally would have allowed \"the French to fight on favourable terrain\". However, he noted that the French failed to use the line as the basis for an offensive.\nMarc Romanych and Martin Rupp highlight that \"poor decisions and missed opportunities\" plagued the line and point to its purpose of conserving manpower: \"about 20 percent of [France's] field divisions remained inactive along the Maginot Line\". Belgium was overrun, and British and French forces evacuated at Dunkirk. They argue had those troops been moved north, \"it is possible that Heeresgruppe A's advance could have been blunted, giving time for Groupe d'armees 1 to reorganise\". Kaufmann and Kaufmann commented, \"When all is said and done, the Maginot Line did not fail to accomplish its original mission... it provided a shield that bought time for the army to mobilise... [and] concentrate its best troops along the Belgian border to engage the enemy.\"\nThe psychological factor of the Maginot Line has also been discussed. Its construction created a false sense of security, which was widely believed by the French population. Kaufmann and Kaufmann comment that it was an unintended consequence of Andr\u00e9 Maginot's efforts to \"focus the public's attention on the work being done, emphasising the role and nature of the line\". That resulted in \"the media exaggerating their descriptions by turning the line into an impregnable fortified position that would seal the frontier\". The false sense of security contributed \"to the development of the \"Maginot mentality\".\nJackson commented that \"it has often been alleged that the Maginot Line contributed to France's defeat by making the military too complacent and defence-minded. Such accusations are unfounded\". Historians have pointed to numerous reasons for the French defeat: faulty strategy and doctrine, dispersion of forces, the loss of command and control, poor communications, faulty intelligence that provided excessive German numbers, the slow nature of the French response to the German penetration of the Ardennes and a failure to understand the nature and speed of the German doctrine. More seriously, historians have noted rather than the Germans doing what the French had envisioned, the French played into the Germans' hand, culminating in their defeat.\nWhen the French Army failed in Belgium, the Maginot Line covered their retreat. Romanych and Rupp indicate that except for the loss of several insignificant fortifications from insufficient defending troops, the actual fortifications and troops \"withstood the test of battle\", repulsed numerous attacks, and \"withstood intense aerial and artillery bombardment\". Kaufmann and Kaufmann point to the Maginot Line along the Italian border, which \"demonstrated the effectiveness of the fortifications... when properly employed\".\nCultural impact.\nThe term \"Maginot Line\" has become a part of the English language: \"America's Maginot Line\" was the title used for an \"Atlantic Magazine\" article about America's military bases in Asia. The article portrayed vulnerability by showing a rocket being transported through a marshy area atop an ox. \"New York Times\" headlined \"Maginot Line in the Sky\" in 2000 and \"A New Maginot Line\" in 2001. It was also frequently referenced in wartime films, notably \"Thunder Rock\", \"The Major and the Minor\" (albeit as a comedic metaphor) and \"Passage to Marseille\".\nSomewhat like \"line in the sand\" it is also used in non-military situations, as in \"Reagan's budgetary Maginot Line.\"\nCanadian singer-songwriter Geoff Berner has a song called \"Maginot Line\" on his album \"We Shall Not\", detailing the debacle.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n Footnotes\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n Citations\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nBooks\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nJournals"}
{"id": "20353", "revid": "50927402", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20353", "title": "Metrication", "text": "Conversion to the metric system of measurement\nMetrication or metrification is the act or process of converting to the metric system of measurement. All over the world, countries have transitioned from local and traditional units of measurement to the metric system. This process began in France during the 1790s, and has persistently advanced over two centuries, accumulating into 95% of the world officially exclusively using the modern metric system. Nonetheless, this also highlights that certain countries and sectors are either still transitioning or have chosen not to fully adopt the metric system.\nOverview.\nThe process of metrication is typically initiated and overseen by a country's government, generally motivated by the necessity of establishing a uniform measurement system for effective international cooperation in fields like trade and science. Governments achieve metrication through either mandatory changes to existing units within a specified timeframe or through voluntary adoption.\nWhile metric use is mandatory in some countries and voluntary in others, all countries have recognised and adopted the SI, albeit to different degrees, including the United States. As of 2011, ninety-five percent of the world's population live in countries where the metric system is the only legal system of measurement.p. 49, ch 2\nAccording to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), there are only three countries that do not have mandatory metric laws (Liberia, Myanmar, and the United States), however a research paper completed by Vera (2011) stated in practice there were four additional countries, namely the United States COFA countries (Federated States of Micronesia, Marshall Islands and Palau), and Samoa.Samoa has since mandated metric trade.\nIn 2018, the Liberian government had pledged to adopt the metric system. In 2013, the Myanmar Ministry of Commerce announced that Myanmar was preparing to adopt the metric system as the country's official system of measurement, and metrication in Myanmar began with some progress was made (road signs and temperature are legislated to be in metric), however there had been very little progress in local trade. \nAs of 2023[ [update]], the United States has a national policy of adopting the metric system based on the Metric Conversion Act of 1975, amended by the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988, and Presidential Executive Order 12770 of 1991, and all United States government agencies are required to adopt it.\nThe metrication process can take years to implement and complete: for instance, Guyana adopted the metric system in 2002 and was only able to make it mandatory in local trade 2017 after the metric system was fully adopted in schools. Antigua and Barbuda, also officially metric, is moving slowly in its metrication process, with a new push in 2011 for all government agencies to convert by 2013 and the entire country to use the metric system by the first quarter of 2015. Other metric Caribbean countries, such as Saint Lucia officially metric 2000, are still in the process toward full conversion.\nThe United Kingdom has officially embraced a dual measurement system. The United Kingdom as of 2007 halted its metrication process, and retain imperial units of the mile and yard in road markings, pints for returnable milk containers, and (with Ireland) for the pint for draught beer and cider sold in pubs. Throughout the 1990s, the European Commission helped accelerate the metrication process for member states, for the implemented the Units of Measure Directive to promote trade. This acceleration caused public backlash in the United Kingdom, and in 2007 the United Kingdom announced that it had secured permanent exemptions listed above and, to appease British public opinion and to facilitate trade with the United States, the option to include imperials units alongside metric units could continue indefinitely.\nThe United Kingdom and the United States face ongoing resistance toward metrication, which may be partially rooted in a belief that their cultural identity is intertwined with the traditional measurement systems they historically have used. This has resulted in a review of mandatory sales and trade of metric units by the UK government. The outcome of this review with over 100\u00a0000 respondents was that a majority had limited or no appetite for increased use of imperial measures.\nForerunners of metrication.\nThe metre was adopted as exclusive measure in 1801 under the French Consulate, then the First French Empire until 1812, when Napoleon decreed the introduction of the \"mesures usuelles\" which remained in use in France up to 1840 in the reign of Louis Philippe. Meanwhile, the metre was adopted by the Republic of Geneva. After the joining of canton of Geneva to Switzerland in 1815, Guillaume Henri Dufour published the first Swiss official map for which the metre was adopted as unit of length. A Swiss-French binational officer, Louis Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte was present when a baseline was measured near Z\u00fcrich for Dufour map which would win the gold medal for the national map at the Exposition Universelle of 1855. Among the scientific instruments calibrated on the metre, which were displayed at the Exposition Universelle, was Brunner apparatus, a geodetic instrument devised for measuring the central baseline of Spain whose designer, Carlos Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez e Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez de Ibero would represent Spain at the International Statistical Institute. In addition to the Exposition Universelle and the second Statistical Congress held in Paris, an International Association for obtaining a uniform decimal system of measures, weights, and coins was created there in 1855. Copies of the Spanish standard would be made for Egypt, France and Germany. These standards were compared to each other and with Borda apparatus which was the main reference for measuring all geodetic baselines in France. These comparisons were essential, because of the expansibility of solid materials with raise in temperature. Indeed, one fact had constantly dominated all the fluctuations of ideas on the measurement of geodesic bases: it was the constant concern to accurately assess the temperature of standards in the field; and the determination of this variable, on which depended the length of the instrument of measurement, had always been considered by geodesists as so difficult and so important that one could almost say that the history of measuring instruments is almost identical with that of the precautions taken to avoid temperature errors. In 1867, the second general Conference of the European Arc Measurement recommended the adoption of the metre in replacement of the toise. In 1869, the Saint Petersburg Academy of Sciences sent to the French Academy of Sciences a report drafted by Otto Wilhelm von Struve, Heinrich von Wild and Moritz von Jacobi inviting his French counterpart to undertake joint action with a view to ensuring the universal use of the metric system in all scientific work. The same year, Napoleon III convened the International Metre Commission which was to meet in Paris in 1870. The Franco-Prussian War broke out, the Second French Empire collapsed, but the metre survived.\nDuring the nineteenth century the metric system of weights and measures proved a convenient political compromise during the unification processes in the Netherlands, Germany and Italy. In 1814, Portugal became the second country not part of the French Empire to officially adopt the metric system. Spain found it expedient in 1849 to follow the French example and within a decade Latin America had also adopted the metric system, or had already adopted the system, such as the case of Chile by 1848. There was considerable resistance to metrication in the United Kingdom and in the United States. Despite this, they were actually the first countries in the World to use a metric standard for cartography.\nFrance (1795\u20131840).\nThe introduction of the metric system into France in 1795 was done on a district by district basis with Paris being the first district. By modern standards the transition was poorly managed. Although thousands of pamphlets were distributed, the Agency of Weights and Measures who oversaw the introduction underestimated the work involved. Paris alone needed 500,000 metre sticks, yet one month after the metre became the sole legal unit of measure, they only had 25,000 in store. This, combined with the excesses of the Revolution and the high level of illiteracy in 18th century France, made the metric system unpopular.\nNapoleon himself ridiculed the metric system but, as an able administrator, recognised the value of a sound basis for a system of measurement. Under the (imperial decree of 12 February 1812), a new system of measure \u2013 the (\"customary measures\") was introduced for use in small retail businesses \u2013 all government, legal and similar works still had to use the metric system and the metric system continued to be taught at all levels of education. That system reintroduced the names of many units used during the ancient regime, but their values were redefined in terms of metric units. Thus the was defined as being two metres, with six making up one \"toise\", twelve making up one \"pied\" and twelve making up one \"pouce\". Likewise the was defined as being 500\u00a0g, each \"livre\" comprising sixteen \"once\" and each \"once\" eight \"gros\" and the \"aune\" as 120 centimetres. This intermediate step eased the transition to a metric-based system.\nBy the (the law of 4 July 1837), Louis Philippe I effectively revoked the use of \"mesures usuelles\" by reaffirming the laws of measurement of 1795 and 1799 to be used from 1 May 1840. However, many units of measure, such as the \"livre\" (for half a kilogram), remained in everyday use for many years, and to a residual extent up to this day.\nGermany (1810\u20131877).\nAt the outbreak of the French Revolution, much of modern-day Germany and Austria were part of the Holy Roman Empire which had become a loose federation of kingdoms, principalities, free cities, bishoprics and other fiefdoms, each with its own system of measurement, though in most cases the systems were loosely derived from the Carolingian system instituted by Charlemagne a thousand years earlier.\nDuring the Napoleonic era, some of the German states moved to reform their systems of measurement using the prototype metre and kilogram as the basis of the new units. Baden, in 1810, for example, redefined the \"Ruthe\" (rods) as being 3.0\u00a0m exactly and defined the subunits of the \"Ruthe\" as 1 \"Ruthe\" = 10\u00a0\"Fu\u00df\" (feet) = 100\u00a0\"Zoll\" (inches) = 1,000\u00a0\"Linie\" (lines) = 10,000\u00a0\"Punkt\" (points) (for simplicity at the expense of grammar, these are the singular forms of each name) while the \"Pfund\" was defined as 500\u00a0g, divided into 30\u00a0Loth, each of 16.67\u00a0g. Bavaria, in its reform of 1811, trimmed the Bavarian \"Pfund\" from 561.288\u00a0g to 560\u00a0g exactly, consisting of 32 \"Loth\", each of 17.5\u00a0g while the Prussian \"Pfund\" remained at 467.711\u00a0g.\nAfter the Congress of Vienna there was a degree of commercial cooperation between the various German states resulting in the German Customs Union (\"Zollverein\"). There were, however, still many barriers to trade until Bavaria took the lead in establishing the General German Commercial Code in 1856. As part of the code the \"Zollverein\" introduced the \"Zollpfund\" (Customs Pound) which was defined as exactly 500\u00a0g and could be split into 30\u00a0'lot'. This unit was used for inter-state movement of goods, but was not applied in all states for internal use.\nIn 1832, Carl Friedrich Gauss studied the Earth's magnetic field and proposed adding the second to the basic units of the metre and the kilogram in the form of the CGS system (centimetre, gram, second). In 1836, he founded the \"Magnetischer Verein\", the first international scientific association, in collaboration with Alexander von Humboldt and Wilhelm Edouard Weber. Geophysics preceded physics and contributed to the development of its methods. It was primarily a natural philosophy whose object was the study of natural phenomena such as the Earth's magnetic field, lightning and gravity. The coordination of the observation of geophysical phenomena in different points of the globe was of paramount importance and was at the origin of the creation of the first international scientific associations. The foundation of the \"Magnetischer Verein\" would be followed by that of the Central European Arc Measurement (German: \"Mitteleurop\u00e4ische Gradmessung\") on the initiative of Johann Jacob Baeyer in 1863, and by that of the International Meteorological Organisation whose second president, the Swiss meteorologist and physicist, Heinrich von Wild represented Russia at the International Committee for Weights and Measures (CIPM). In 1867, the European Arc Measurement (German: \"Europ\u00e4ische Gradmessung\") called for the creation of a new, \"international prototype metre\" (IPM) and the arrangement of a system where national standards could be compared with it. The French government gave practical support to the creation of an International Metre Commission, which met in Paris in 1870 and again in 1872 with the participation of about thirty countries. The Metre Convention was signed on 20 May 1875 in Paris and the International Bureau of Weights and Measures was created under the supervision of the CIPM.\nAlthough the Zollverein collapsed after the Austro-Prussian War of 1866, the metric system became the official system of measurement in the newly formed German Empire in 1872 and of Austria in 1875. The Zollpfund ceased to be legal in Germany after 1877.\nItaly (1797\u20131870).\nThe Cisalpine Republic, a North Italian republic set up by Napoleon in 1797 with its capital at Milan, first adopted a modified form of the metric system based on the \"braccio cisalpino\" (Cisalpine cubit) which was defined to be half a metre. In 1802 the Cisalpine Republic was renamed the Italian Republic, with Napoleon as its head of state. The following year the Cisalpine system of measure was replaced by the metric system.\nIn 1806, the Italian Republic was replaced by the Kingdom of Italy with Napoleon as its emperor. By 1812, all of Italy from Rome northwards was under the control of Napoleon, either as French Departments or as part of the Kingdom of Italy, ensuring that the metric system was in use throughout this region.\nAfter the Congress of Vienna, the various Italian states reverted to their original systems of measurements, but in 1845 the Kingdom of Piedmont and Sardinia passed legislation to introduce the metric system within five years. By 1860, most of Italy had been unified under the King of Sardinia Victor Emmanuel II; and under \"Law 132 of 28 July 1861\" the metric system became the official system of measurement throughout the kingdom. Numerous \"Tavole di ragguaglio\" (conversion tables) were displayed in shops until 31 December 1870.\nNetherlands (1799\u20131817).\nThe Netherlands (as the revolutionary Batavian Republic) began to use the metric system from 1799 but, as with its co-revolutionaries in France, encountered numerous practical difficulties. Subsequently, as part of the First French Empire since 1809, the Netherlands used Napoleon's from their introduction in 1812 until the fall of his Empire in 1815. Under the (Dutch) Weights and Measures Act of 21 August 1816 and the Royal decree of 27 March 1817 (), the newly formed Kingdom of the Netherlands abandoned the in favour of the \"Dutch\" metric system () in which metric units were simply given the names of units of measure that were then in use: for instance the (ounce) was defined as 100\u00a0g.\nNorway (1875).\nIn 1875, Norway was the first country to ratify the metre convention, and it was seen as an important step towards Norwegian independence. The decision to adopt the metric system is said to have been the Norwegian Parliament's fastest decision in peacetime.\nPortugal (1814).\nIn August 1814, Portugal officially adopted the metric system but with the names of the units substituted by Portuguese traditional ones. In this system the basic units were the \"m\u00e3o-travessa\" (hand) = 1\u00a0decimetre (10\u00a0\"m\u00e3o-travessas\" = 1\u00a0\"vara\" (yard) = 1\u00a0metre), the \"canada\" = 1\u00a0litre and the \"libra\" (pound) = 1\u00a0kilogram.\nSpain (1700\u20131889).\nUntil the ascent of the Bourbon monarchy in Spain in 1700, each region of Spain had its own system of measurement. The new Bourbon monarchy tried to centralise control and with it the system of measurement. There were debates regarding the desirability of retaining the Castilian units of measure or, in the interests of harmonisation, adopting the French system. Although Spain assisted M\u00e9chain in his meridian survey, the Government feared the French revolutionary movement and reinforced the Castilian units of measure to counter such movements. By 1849 however, it proved difficult to maintain the old system and in that year the metric system became the legal system of measure in Spain.\nThe Spanish Royal Academy of Science urged the Government to approve the creation of a large-scale map of Spain in 1852. The following year Carlos Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez e Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez de Ibero was appointed to undertake this task. All the scientific and technical material had to be created. Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez e Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez de Ibero and Saavedra went to Paris to supervise the production by Brunner of a measuring instrument which they had devised and which they later compared with Borda's double-toise N\u00b01 which was the main reference for measuring all geodetic bases in France and whose length was by definition 3.8980732 metres at a specified temperature.\nIn 1865 the triangulation of Spain was connected with that of Portugal and France. In 1866 at the conference of the Association of Geodesy in Neuch\u00e2tel, Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez announced that Spain would collaborate in remeasuring the French meridian arc. In 1879 Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez and Fran\u00e7ois Perrier (representing France) completed the junction between the geodetic network of Spain and Algeria and thus completed the measurement of the French meridian arc which extended from Shetland to the Sahara.\nIn 1866, Spain and Portugal joined the Central European Arc Measurement which would become the European Arc Measurement the next year. In 1867 at the second general conference of the geodetic association held in Berlin, the question of an international standard unit of length was discussed in order to combine the measurements made in different countries to determine the size and shape of the Earth. The conference proposed according to recommendations drawn up by a committee chaired by Otto Wilhelm von Struve director of the Pulkovo Observatory in St. Petersburg the adoption of the metre and the creation of an international metre commission, after a preliminary discussion held in Neuch\u00e2tel between Johann Jacob Baeyer director of the Royal Prussian Geodetic Institute, Adolphe Hirsch founder of the Neuch\u00e2tel Observatory and Carlos Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez e Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez de Ibero Spanish representative, founder and first director of the Instituto Geogr\u00e1fico Nacional.\nIn November 1869 the French government issued invitations to join this commission. Spain accepted and Carlos Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez e Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez de Ibero took part in the Committee of preparatory research from the first meeting of the International Metre Commission in 1870. He became president of the permanent Committee of the International Metre Commission in 1872. In 1874 he was elected as president of the Permanent Commission of the European Arc Measurement. He also presided the General Conference of the European Arc Measurement held in Paris in 1875, when the association decided the creation of an international geodetic standard for the bases' measurement. He represented Spain at the 1875 conference of the Metre Convention, which was ratified the same year in Paris. The Spanish geodesist was elected as the first president of the International Committee for Weights and Measures. His activities resulted in the distribution of a platinum and iridium prototype of the metre to all States parties to the Metre Convention during the first meeting of the General Conference on Weights and Measures in 1889. These prototypes defined the metre right up until 1960.\nSwitzerland (1801\u20131877).\nIn 1801, the Helvetic Republic at the instigation of Johann Georg Tralles promulgated a law introducing the metric system. However this was never applied, because in 1803 the competence for weights and measures returned to the cantons. On the territory of the current canton of Jura, then annexed to France (Mont-Terrible), the metre was adopted in 1800. The Canton of Geneva adopted the metric system in 1813, the canton of Vaud in 1822, the canton of Valais in 1824 and the canton of Neuch\u00e2tel in 1857. In 1835, twelve cantons of the Swiss Plateau and the north-east adopted a concordat based on the federal foot (exactly 0.3 m) which entered into force in 1836. The cantons of central and eastern Switzerland, as well as the Alpine cantons, continued to use the old measures.\nGuillaume-Henri Dufour founded in 1838 in Geneva a topographic office (the future Federal Office of topography), which published under his direction, from 1845 to 1864, the first official map of Switzerland, on the basis of new cantonal measurements. This map at 1:100,000 engraved on copper, suggested the relief by hatching and shadows. The map projection adopted by the commission was the Bonne projection, centred on the Bern Observatory (5\u00b0 6' 10.8\" east of Paris meridian), although this point was much closer to the western end of Switzerland than to its eastern end. But its position was well known, and there was no more central observatory. The scale was set at 1:100 000 because it was considered more suitable for a country as rugged as Switzerland than the 1:80 000 adopted for the large map of France and the two maps were in any case inconsistent, as the meridians of the map of Switzerland tilted in the opposite direction to those of the map of France. The map commission wanted to adopt decimal measures; and Switzerland did not have an already existing map which, like the Cassini map, used a scale close to 1:86 400, i.e. 1 line (&lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u204412 of a French inch) to 100 toises (i.e. 600 French feet). The metre was adopted as a linear measure, and the entire map was divided into twenty-five sheets: five east\u2013west and five north\u2013south. Each sheet of the map showed two scales, one purely metric, the other in Swiss leagues 4,800 metres in length. The frame was divided into sexagesimal minutes and centesimal minutes; the latter, each subdivided into ten parts, had the advantage of showing Kilometres in the direction of the meridians; so that there were new scales on the sides of the sheet to evaluate the distances.\nAccording to the 1848 Constitution the federal foot was to come into force throughout the country. In Geneva, a committee chaired by Guillaume Henri Dufour militated in favor of maintaining the decimal metric system in the French-speaking cantons and against the standardization of weights and measures in Switzerland on the basis of the metric foot. In 1868 the metric system was legalized alongside the federal foot, which was a first step towards its definitive introduction. Cantonal calibrators were supervised by a Federal Bureau of Verification created in 1862, whose management was entrusted to Heinrich von Wild from 1864. In 1875, the responsibility for weights and measures was transferred back from the cantons to the Confederation, and Switzerland (represented by Adolphe Hirsch) joined the Metre Convention. The same year a federal law imposed the metric system from 1 January 1877. In 1977, Switzerland joined the International System of Units.\nUnited Kingdom (1824\u2013present).\nThe Weights and Measures Act 1824 (5 Geo. 4. c. 74) imposed one standard 'imperial' system of weights and measures on the British Empire. The effect of this act was to standardise existing British units of measure rather than to align them with the metric system.\nDuring the next eighty years a number of parliamentary select committees recommended the adoption of the metric system, each with a greater degree of urgency, but Parliament prevaricated. A select committee report of 1862 recommended compulsory metrication, but with an \"Intermediate permissive phase\"; Parliament responded in 1864 by legalising metric units only for 'contracts and dealings'. The United Kingdom initially declined to sign the Treaty of the Metre, but did so in 1883. Meanwhile, British scientists and technologists were at the forefront of the metrication movement \u2013 it was the British Association for the Advancement of Science that promoted the CGS system of units as a coherent system and it was the British firm Johnson Matthey that was accepted by the CGPM in 1889 to cast the international prototype metre and kilogram.\nIn 1895, another parliamentary select committee recommended the compulsory adoption of the metric system after a two-year permissive period. The Weights and Measures (Metric System) Act 1897 (60 &amp; 61 Vict. c. 46) legalised the metric units for trade, but did not make them mandatory. A bill to make the metric system compulsory to help the British industrial base fight off the challenge of the nascent German base passed through the House of Lords in 1904, but did not pass in the House of Commons before the next general election was called. Following opposition by the Lancashire cotton industry, a similar bill was defeated in the House of Commons in 1907 by 150 votes to 118.\nIn 1965, the UK began an official programme of metrication, and as of 2025, in the United Kingdom the metric is the official measurement system for all regulated trading by weight or measure purposes, however the imperial pint remains the sole legal unit for milk in returnable bottles and for draught beer and cider in British pubs. Imperial units are also legally permitted to be used alongside metric units on food packaging and price indications for goods sold loose. The UK government undertook a \"Choice on units of measurement: consultation response\", and found just over 1% of respondents wished to revert to an increase in the use of imperial units, and as such kept the current regulations on the sale of goods.\nIn addition imperial units may be used exclusively where a product is sold by description, rather than by weight/mass/volume: e.g. television screen and clothing sizes tend to be given in inches only, but a piece of material priced per inch would be unlawful unless the metric price was also shown.\nThe general public still use imperial units in common language for their height and weight, and imperial units are the norm when discussing longer distances such as journeys by car, but otherwise metric measurements are often used.\nUnited States (1830\u2013present).\nIn 1805 a Swiss geodesist Ferdinand Rudolph Hassler brought copies of the French metre and kilogram to the United States. In 1830 the Congress decided to create uniform standards for length and weight in the United States. Hassler was mandated to work out the new standards and proposed to adopt the metric system. The Congress opted for the British Parliamentary Standard from 1758 and the Troy Pound of Great Britain from 1824 as length and weight standards. Nevertheless, the primary baseline of the Survey of the Coast (renamed the United States Coast Survey in 1836 and the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey in 1878) was measured in 1834 at Fire Island using four iron bars constructed after Hassler's specification in the United Kingdom and brought back in the United States in 1815. All distances measured by the Survey of the Coast, Coast Survey, and Coast and Geodetic Survey were referred to the metre. In 1866 the United States Congress passed a bill making it lawful to use the metric system in the United States. The bill, which was permissive rather than mandatory in nature, defined the metric system in terms of customary units rather than with reference to the international prototype metre and kilogram. Ferdinand Rudolph Hassler's use of the metre in coastal surveying, which had been an argument for the introduction of the Metric Act of 1866 allowing the use of the metre in the United States, probably also played a role in the choice of the metre as international scientific unit of length and the proposal by the European Arc Measurement (German: \"Europ\u00e4ische Gradmessung\") to \u201cestablish a European international bureau for weights and measures\u201d.\nBy 1893, the reference standards for customary units had become unreliable. Moreover, the United States, being a signatory of the Metre Convention was in possession of national prototype metres and kilograms that were calibrated against those in use elsewhere in the world. This led to the Mendenhall Order which redefined the customary units by referring to the national metric prototypes, but used the conversion factors of the 1866 act. In 1896, a bill that would make the metric system mandatory in the United States was presented to Congress. Twenty-three of the 29 people who gave evidence before the congressional committee who were considering the bill were in favor of it, but six were against. Four of these six dissenters represented manufacturing interests and the other two were from the United States Revenue service. The grounds cited were the cost and inconvenience of the change-over. The bill was not enacted. Subsequent bills suffered a similar fate.\nThe United States mandated the acceptance of the metric system in 1866 for commercial and legal proceedings, without displacing their customary units. The non-mandatory nature of the adoption of the SI has resulted in a much slower pace of adoption in the US than in other countries.\nIn 1971, the US National Bureau of Standards completed a three-year study of the impact of increasing worldwide metric use on the US. The study concluded with a report to Congress entitled \"A Metric America\u00a0\u2013 A Decision Whose Time Has Come\". Since then metric use has increased in the US, principally in the manufacturing and educational sectors. Public Law 93-380, enacted 21 August 1974, states that it is the policy of the US to encourage educational agencies and institutions to prepare students to use the metric system of measurement with ease and facility as a part of the regular education program. On 23 December 1975, President Gerald Ford signed Public Law 94\u2013168, the Metric Conversion Act of 1975. This act declares a national policy of coordinating the increasing use of the metric system in the US. It established a US Metric Board whose functions as of 1 October 1982 were transferred to the Dept of Commerce, Office of Metric Programs, to coordinate the voluntary conversion to the metric system.\nIn January 2007 NASA decided to use metric units for all future Moon missions, in line with the practice of other space agencies.\nOther English-speaking countries.\nThe British metrication programme signalled the start of metrication programmes elsewhere in the Commonwealth, though India had started its programme in 1959, six years before the United Kingdom. South Africa (then not a member of the Commonwealth) set up a Metrication Advisory Board in 1967, New Zealand set up its Metric Advisory Board in 1969, Australia passed the Metric Conversion Act in 1970 and Canada appointed a Metrication Commission in 1971. \nMetrication in Australia, New Zealand and South Africa was essentially complete within a decade, while in Canada metrication has been halted since the 1970s. In Canada, the square foot is still widespread for commercial and residential advertisements and partially in construction because of the close trade relations with the United States. Metric measurements on food products such as canned food are often merely the equivalent of the still widely used imperial units of measurement such as the ounce and the pound. Butter in Canada is sold in 454 g packagings, which is the equivalent of one pound. The railways of Canada such as the Canadian National and Canadian Pacific as well as commuter rail services continue to measure their trackage in miles and speed limits in miles per hour because they also operate in the United States (although urban railways including subways and light rail have adopted kilometres and kilometres per hour). Canadian railcars show weight figures in both imperial and metric. Most other Commonwealth countries adopted the metric system during the 1970s.\nApart from the United Kingdom and Canada, which have effectively halted their metrication programs, the great majority of countries using the imperial system have completed official metrication during the second half of the 20th century or the first decade of the 21st century. The most recent to complete this process was the Republic of Ireland, which began metric conversion in the 1970s and completed it in early 2005. Hong Kong uses three systems (Chinese, imperial, and metric) and all three are permitted for use in trade.\nGlobal status of metrication.\nStatus by country/region.\n\"Links in the country/region point to articles about metrication in that country/region.\"\nNotes\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nMethods of conversion.\nThere are three common ways that nations convert from traditional measurement systems to the metric system. The first is the quick or \"Big-Bang\" route. The second way is to phase in units over time and progressively outlaw traditional units. This method, favoured by some industrial nations, is slower and generally less complete. The third way is to redefine traditional units in metric terms. This has been used successfully where traditional units were ill-defined and had regional variations.\nThe \"Big-Bang\" way is to simultaneously outlaw the use of pre-metric measurement, metricate, reissue all government publications and laws, and change education systems to metric. India was the first Commonwealth country to use this method of conversion. Its changeover lasted from 1 April 1960, when metric measurements became legal, to 1 April 1962, when all other systems were banned. The Indian model was extremely successful and was copied over much of the developing world. Two industrialized Commonwealth countries, Australia and New Zealand, also did a quick conversion to metric.\nThe phase-in way is to pass a law permitting the use of metric units in parallel with traditional ones, followed by education of metric units, then progressively ban the use of the older measures. This has generally been a slow route to metric. The British Empire permitted the use of metric measures in 1873, but the changeover was not completed in most Commonwealth countries other than India and Australia until the 1970s and 1980s when governments took an active role in metric conversion. In the United Kingdom and Canada, the process is still incomplete. Japan also followed this route and did not complete the changeover for 70\u00a0years. By law, loose goods sold with reference to units of quantity have to be weighed and sold using the metric system. In 2001, the EU directive 80/181/EEC stated that supplementary units (imperial units alongside metric including labelling on packages) would become illegal from the beginning of 2010. In September 2007, a consultation process was started which resulted in the directive being modified to permit supplementary units to be used indefinitely.\nThe third method is to redefine traditional units in terms of metric values. These redefined \"quasi-metric\" units often stay in use long after metrication is said to have been completed. Resistance to metrication in post-revolutionary France convinced Napoleon to revert to \"mesures usuelles\" (usual measures), and, to some extent, the names remain throughout Europe. In 1814, Portugal adopted the metric system, but with the names of the units substituted by Portuguese traditional ones. In this system, the basic units were the \"m\u00e3o-travessa\" (hand) = 1\u00a0decimetre (10\u00a0\"m\u00e3o-travessas\" = 1\u00a0\"vara\" (yard) = 1\u00a0metre), the \"canada\" = 1\u00a0litre and the \"libra\" (pound) = 1\u00a0kilogram. In the Netherlands, 500\u00a0g is informally referred to as a \"pond\" (pound) and 100\u00a0g as an \"ons\" (ounce), and in Germany and France, 500\u00a0g is informally referred to respectively as \"ein Pfund\" and \"une livre\" (\"one pound\").\nIn Denmark, the re-defined \"pund\" (500\u00a0g) is occasionally used, particularly among older people and (older) fruit growers, since these were originally paid according to the number of pounds of fruit produced. In Sweden and Norway, a \"mil\" (Scandinavian mile) is informally equal to 10\u00a0km, and this has continued to be the predominantly used unit in conversation when referring to geographical distances. In the 19th century, Switzerland had a non-metric system completely based on metric terms (e.g. 1\u00a0\"Fuss\" (foot) = 30\u00a0cm, 1\u00a0\"Zoll\" (inch) = 3\u00a0cm, 1\u00a0\"Linie\" (line) = 3\u00a0mm). In China, the \"jin\" now has a value of 500\u00a0g and the liang is 50\u00a0g.\nSurveys are performed by various interest groups or the government to determine the degree to which ordinary people change to using metric in their daily lives. In countries that have recently changed, older segments of the population tend still to use the older units.\nIndustries and countries resistant to metrication.\nAs of 2024[ [update]], the metric system predominates in most of the world, however specific industries are more resistant to metrication. For example:\nAir and sea transportation.\nAir and sea transportation commonly use the nautical mile. This is about one minute of arc of latitude along any meridian arc and it is precisely defined as 1,852 metres (about 1.151 miles). It is not an SI unit. The prime unit of speed or velocity for maritime and air navigation remains the knot (nautical mile per hour).\nThe prime unit of measure for aviation (altitude, or flight level) is usually estimated based on air pressure values, and in many countries, it is still described in nominal feet, although many others employ nominal metres. The policies of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) relating to measurement are:\nConsistent with ICAO policy, aviation has undergone a significant amount of metrication over the years. For example, runway lengths are usually given in metres. The United States metricated the data interchange format (METAR) for temperature reports in 1996, and since indicates temperature in Celsius. Metrication is also gradually taking place in cargo mass and dimensions and in fuel volume and mass.\nIn former Soviet countries and China, the metric system is used in aviation (whereby in Russia altitudes above the transition level are given in feet). Sailplanes use the metric system in many European countries.\nIn 1975, the assembly of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) decided that future conventions of the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) and other future IMO instruments should use SI units only.\nUnited Kingdom.\nIn the United Kingdom, some of the population continues to resist metrication to varying degrees. The traditional imperial measures are preferred by a majority and continue to have widespread use in some applications. The metric system is used by most businesses, and is used for most trade transactions. Metric units must be used for certain trading activities (selling by weight or measure for example), although imperial units may continue to be displayed in parallel.\nBritish law has enacted the provisions of European Union directive 80/181/EEC, which catalogues the units of measure that may be used for \"economic, public health, public safety and administrative purposes\". These units consist of the recommendations of the General Conference on Weights and Measures, supplemented by some additional units of measure that may be used for specified purposes. Metric units could be legally used for trading purposes for nearly a century before metrication efforts began in earnest. The government had been making preparations for the conversion of the imperial unit since the 1862 \"Select Committee on Weights and Measures\" recommended the conversion and the Metric Weights and Measures Act 1864 (27 &amp; 28 Vict. c. 117) and the Weights and Measures (Metric System) Act 1897 (60 &amp; 61 Vict. c. 46) legalised the metric system.\nIn 1965, with lobbying from British industries and the prospects of joining the Common Market, the government set a 10-year target for full conversion, and created the Metrication Board in 1969. Metrication occurred in some areas during this time period, including the re-surveying of Ordnance Survey maps in 1970, decimalisation of the currency in 1971, and teaching the metric system in schools. No plans were made to make the use of the metric system compulsory, and the Metrication Board was abolished in 1980 following a change in government.\nThe United Kingdom avoided having to comply with the 1989 European Units of Measurement Directive (89/617/EEC), which required all member states to make the metric system compulsory, by negotiating derogations (delayed switchovers), including for miles on road signs and for pints for draught beer, cider, and milk sales.\nImmediately following the United Kingdom's vote to withdraw from the European Union, it was reported that some retailers requested to revert to imperial units, with some reverting without permission. A poll following the 2016 vote also found that 45% of Britons sought to revert to selling produce in imperial units.\nThe UK government started a consultation on 3 June 2022 on the choice of units of measurement markings.\nImperial units remain in common everyday use for human body measurements, in particular stones and pounds for weight, and feet and inches for height.\nFuel economy is often advertised in miles per imperial gallon, which may lead to some confusion for users of US gallons for American manufactured cars.\nHeating, air conditioning, and gas cooking appliances occasionally display power in British thermal units per hour (BTU/h).\nUnited States.\nOver time, the metric system has influenced the United States through international trade and standardisation. The use of the metric system was made legal as a system of measurement in 1866 and the United States was a founding member of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures in 1875. The system was officially adopted by the federal government in 1975 for use in the military and government agencies, and as preferred system for trade and commerce. Attempts in the 1990s to make it mandatory for federal and state road signage to use metric units failed and it remains voluntary.\nA 1992 amendment to the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act (FPLA), which took effect in 1994, required labels on federally regulated \"consumer commodities\" to include both metric and US customary units. As of 2013, all but one US state (New York) have passed laws permitting metric-only labels for the products they regulate.\nAfter many years of informal or optional metrication, the American public and much of the private business and industry still use US customary units today. At least two states, Kentucky and California, have even moved towards demetrication of highway construction projects.\nCanada.\nCanada legally allows for dual labelling of goods provided that the metric unit is listed first and that there is a distinction of whether a liquid measure is a US or a Canadian (imperial) unit.\nBelize.\nBelize, which is a former British colony, uses both the metric and British imperial systems. Miles are the most commonly used unit for measuring distance, and petrol is sold in US gallons (similar to some countries in Latin America).\nMetrication mishaps.\nConfusion over units during the process of metrication can sometimes lead to accidents. In 1983, an Air Canada Boeing 767, nicknamed the \"Gimli Glider\" following the incident, ran out of fuel in midflight. The incident was caused, in a large part, by the confusion over the conversion between litres, kilograms, and pounds, resulting in the aircraft receiving of fuel instead of the required .\nWhile not strictly an example of national metrication, the use of two different measurement systems was a contributing factor in the loss of the Mars Climate Orbiter in 1999. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) specified metric units in the contract. NASA and other organisations worked in metric units, but one subcontractor, Lockheed Martin, provided thruster performance data to the team in pound force-seconds instead of newton-seconds. The spacecraft was intended to orbit Mars at about in altitude, but the incorrect data meant that it descended to about . As a result, it burned up in the Martian atmosphere.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "20354", "revid": "33005952", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20354", "title": "Month", "text": "Unit of time about as long the orbital period of the Moon\nA month is a unit of time, used with calendars, that is approximately as long as a natural phase cycle of the Moon; the words \"month\" and \"Moon\" are cognates. The traditional concept of months arose with the cycle of Moon phases; such lunar months (\"lunations\") are synodic months and last approximately 29.53 days, making for roughly 12.37 such months in one Earth year. From excavated tally sticks, researchers have deduced that people counted days in relation to the Moon's phases as early as the Paleolithic age. Synodic months, based on the Moon's orbital period with respect to the Earth\u2013Sun line, are still the basis of many calendars today and are used to divide the year.\nCalendars that developed from the Roman calendar system, such as the internationally used Gregorian calendar, divide the year into 12 months, each of which lasts between 28 and 31 days. The names of the months were Anglicized from various Latin names and events important to Rome, except for the months 9\u201312, which are named after the Latin numerals 7\u201310 (\"septem\", \"octo\", \"novem\", and \"decem\") because they were originally the seventh through tenth months in the Roman calendar. In the modern Gregorian calendar, the only month with a variable number of days is the second month, February, which has 29 days during a leap year and 28 days otherwise.\nTypes of months in astronomy.\nThe following types of months are mainly of significance in astronomy. Most of them (but not the distinction between sidereal and tropical months) were first recognized in Babylonian lunar astronomy.\nA synodic month is longer than a sidereal month because the Earth-Moon system is orbiting the Sun in the same direction as the Moon is orbiting the Earth. The Sun moves eastward with respect to the stars (as does the Moon) and it takes about 2.2 days longer for the Moon to return to the same apparent position with respect to the Sun.\nAn anomalistic month is longer than a sidereal month because the perigee moves in the same direction as the Moon is orbiting the Earth, one revolution in nine years. Therefore, the Moon takes a little longer to return to perigee than to return to the same star.\nA draconic month is shorter than a sidereal month because the nodes move in the opposite direction as the Moon is orbiting the Earth, one revolution in 18.6 years. Therefore, the Moon returns to the same node slightly earlier than it returns to the same star.\nCalendrical consequences.\nAt the simplest level, most well-known lunar calendars are based on the initial approximation that 2 lunations last 59 solar days: a 30-day full month followed by a 29-day hollow month \u2014 but this is only roughly accurate and regularly needs intercalation (correction) by a leap day.\nAdditionally, the synodic month does not fit easily into the solar (or 'tropical') year, which makes accurate, rule-based lunisolar calendars that combine the two cycles complicated. The most common solution to this problem is the Metonic cycle, which takes advantage of the fact that 235 lunations are approximately 19 tropical years (which add up to not quite 6,940 days): 12 years have 12 lunar months, and 7 years are 13 lunar months long. However, a Metonic calendar based year will drift against the seasons by about one day every 2 centuries. Metonic calendars include the calendar used in the Antikythera Mechanism about 21 centuries ago, and the Hebrew calendar.\nAlternatively in a pure lunar calendar, years are defined as having always 12 lunations, so a year is 354 or 355 days long: the Islamic calendar is the prime example. Consequently, an Islamic year is about 11 days shorter than a solar year and cycles through the seasons in about 33 solar = 34 lunar years: the Islamic New Year has a different Gregorian calendar date in each (solar) year.\nPurely solar calendars often have months which no longer relate to the phase of the Moon, but are based only on the motion of the Sun relative to the equinoxes and solstices, or are purely conventional like in the widely used Gregorian calendar.\nThe complexity required in an accurate lunisolar calendar may explain why solar calendars have generally replaced lunisolar and lunar calendars for civil use in most societies.\nMonths in various calendars.\nBeginning of the lunar month.\nThe Hellenic calendars, the Hebrew Lunisolar calendar and the Islamic Lunar calendar started the month with the first appearance of the thin crescent of the new moon.\nHowever, the motion of the Moon in its orbit is very complicated and its period is not constant. The date and time of this actual observation depends on the exact geographical longitude as well as latitude, atmospheric conditions, the visual acuity of the observers, etc. Therefore, the beginning and lengths of months defined by observation cannot be accurately predicted.\nWhile some like orthodox Islam and the Jewish Karaites still rely on actual moon observations, reliance on astronomical calculations and tabular methods is increasingly common in practice.\nAhom calendar.\nThere are 12 months and an additional leap year month in the Ahom sexagenary calendar known as Lak-ni. The first month is Duin Shing.\nRoman calendar.\nThe Roman calendar was reformed several times, the last three enduring reforms during historical times. The last three reformed Roman calendars are called the \"Julian\", \"Augustan\", and \"Gregorian\"; all had the same number of days in their months. Despite other attempts, the names of the months after the Augustan calendar reform have persisted, and the number of days in each month (except February) have remained constant since before the Julian reform. The Gregorian calendar, like the Roman calendars before it, has twelve months, whose Anglicized names are:\n\nThe famous mnemonic \"Thirty days hath September\" is a common way of teaching the lengths of the months in the English-speaking world. The knuckles of the four fingers of one's hand and the spaces between them can be used to remember the lengths of the months. By making a fist, each month will be listed as one proceeds across the hand. All months landing on a knuckle are 31\u00a0days long and those landing between them are 30\u00a0days long, with variable February being the remembered exception. When the knuckle of the index finger is reached (July), go over to the first knuckle on the other fist, held next to the first (or go back to the first knuckle) and continue with August. This physical mnemonic has been taught to primary school students for many decades, if not centuries.\nThis cyclical pattern of month lengths matches the musical keyboard alternation of wide white keys (31\u00a0days) and narrow black keys (30\u00a0days). The note F corresponds to January, the note F corresponds to February, the exceptional 28\u201329\u00a0day month, and so on.\nNumerical relations.\nThe mean month-length in the Gregorian calendar is 30.436875\u00a0days.\nAny five consecutive months that do not include February contain 153\u00a0days.\nCalends, nones, and ides.\nMonths in the pre-Julian Roman calendar included:\nThe Romans divided their months into three parts, which they called the \"calends\", the \"nones\", and the \"ides\". Their system is somewhat intricate. \nThe ides occur on the thirteenth day in eight of the months, but in March, May, July, and October, they occur on the fifteenth. The nones always occur 8\u00a0days (one Roman 'week') before the ides, i.e., on the fifth or the seventh. The calends are always the first day of the month, and before Julius Caesar's reform fell sixteen days (two Roman weeks) after the ides (except the ides of February and the intercalary month).\nRelations between dates, weekdays, and months in the Gregorian calendar.\nWithin a month, the following dates fall on the same day of the week:\nSome months have the same date/weekday structure.\nIn a non-leap year:\nIn a leap year:\nHebrew calendar.\nThe Hebrew calendar has 12 or 13 months.\nAdar 1 is only added 7 times in 19 years. In ordinary years, Adar 2 is simply called Adar.\nIslamic calendar.\nThere are also twelve months in the Islamic calendar. They are named as follows:\nSee Islamic calendar for more information on the Islamic calendar.\nHindu calendar.\nThe Hindu calendar has various systems of naming the months. The months in the lunar calendar are:\nThese are also the names used in the Indian national calendar for the newly redefined months. Purushottam Maas or Adhik Maas (translit. ' = 'extra', ' = 'month') is an extra month in the Hindu calendar that is inserted to keep the lunar and solar calendars aligned. \"Purushottam\" is an epithet of Vishnu, to whom the month is dedicated.\nThe names in the solar calendar are just the names of the zodiac sign in which the sun travels. They are\nBah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed calendar.\nThe Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed calendar is the calendar used by the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith. It is a solar calendar with regular years of 365 days, and leap years of 366 days. Years are composed of 19 months of 19 days each (361 days), plus an extra period of \"Intercalary Days\" (4 in regular and 5 in leap years). The months are named after the attributes of God. Days of the year begin and end at sundown.\nIranian calendar (Persian calendar).\nThe Iranian / Persian calendar, currently used in Iran, also has 12 months. The Persian names are included in the parentheses. It begins on the northern Spring equinox.\nReformed Bengali calendar.\nThe Bengali calendar, used in Bangladesh, follows solar months and it has six seasons. The months and seasons in the calendar are:\nNanakshahi calendar.\nThe months in the Nanakshahi calendar are:\nKhmer calendar.\nDifferent from the Hindu calendar, the Khmer calendar consists of both a lunar calendar and a solar calendar. The solar is used more commonly than the lunar calendar.\nThe Khmer lunar calendar most often contains 12 months; however, the eighth month is repeated (as a \"leap month\") every two or three years, making 13 months instead of 12. Each lunar month has 29 or 30 days. The year normally has then 354 or 384 days (when an intercalary month is added), but the calendar follows the rules of the Gregorian calendar to determine leap years and add a lead day to one month, so the Khmer lunar year may have a total of 354, 355, 384 or 385 days.\nTongan calendar.\nThe Tongan calendar is based on the cycles of the Moon around the Earth in one year. The months are:\nPingelapese.\nPingelapese, a language from Micronesia, also uses a lunar calendar. There are 12 months associated with their calendar. The Moon first appears in March, they name this month \"Kahlek\". This system has been used for hundreds of years and throughout many generations. This calendar is cyclical and relies on the position and shape of the Moon.\nSinhalese calendar.\nThe Sinhalese calendar is the Buddhist calendar in Sri Lanka with Sinhala names. Each full moon Poya day marks the start of a Buddhist lunar month. The first month is Bak.\nGermanic calendar.\nThe old Icelandic calendar is not in official use anymore, but some Icelandic holidays and annual feasts are still calculated from it. It has 12 months, broken down into two groups of six often termed \"winter months\" and \"summer months\". The calendar is peculiar in that the months always start on the same weekday rather than on the same date. Hence \u00deorri always starts on a Friday sometime between January 22 and January 28 \"\", G\u00f3a always starts on a Sunday between February 21 and February 27 \"\".\nOld Georgian calendar.\n \"New Year in ancient Georgia started from September.\"\nOld English calendar.\nLike the Old Norse calendar, the Anglo-Saxons had their own calendar before they were Christianized which reflected native traditions and deities. These months were attested by Bede in his works \"On Chronology\" and \"The Reckoning of Time\" written in the 8th\u00a0century. His Old English month names are probably written as pronounced in Bede's native Northumbrian dialect. The months were named after the Moon; the new moon marking the end of an old month and start of a new month; the full moon occurring in the middle of the month, after which the whole month took its name.\nWhen an intercalary month was needed, a third \"Litha\" month was inserted in mid-summer.\nOld Celtic calendar.\nThe Coligny calendar (Gaulish/Celtic) is an Iron Age Metonic lunisolar calendar, with 12\u00a0lunar months of either 29 or 30\u00a0days. The lunar month is calculated to a precision of within 24\u00a0hours of the lunar phase, achieved by a particular arrangement of months, and the month of EQUOS having a variable length of 29 or 30\u00a0days to adjust for any lunar slippage. This setup means the calendar could stay precisely aligned to its lunar phase indefinitely. \nThe lunar month is divided into two halves, the first of 15\u00a0days and the second of 14 or 15\u00a0days. The month is calculated to start at the first quarter moon, with the full moon at the centre of the first half-month and the dark moon at the centre of the second half-month. The calendar does not rely on unreliable visual sightings.\nAn intercalary lunar month is inserted before every 30\u00a0lunar months to keep in sync with the solar year. Every 276\u00a0years this adds one day to the solar point, so if for example the calendar was 1,000\u00a0years old, it would only have slipped by less than 4\u00a0days against the solar year. \nOld Hungarian calendar.\nNagyszombati kalend\u00e1rium (in Latin: \"Calendarium Tyrnaviense\") from 1579.\nHistorically Hungary used a 12-month calendar that appears to have been zodiacal in nature but eventually came to correspond to the Gregorian months as shown below:\nOld Egyptian calendar.\nThe ancient civil Egyptian calendar had a year that was 365 days long and was divided into 12 months of 30 days each, plus 5 extra days (epagomenes) at the end of the year. The months were divided into 3 \"weeks\" of ten days each. Because the ancient Egyptian year was almost a quarter of a day shorter than the solar year and stellar events \"wandered\" through the calendar, it is referred to as Annus Vagus or \"Wandering Year\".\nNisga'a calendar.\nThe Nisga'a calendar coincides with the Gregorian calendar with each month referring to the type of harvesting that is done during the month.\nFrench Republican calendar.\nThis calendar was proposed during the French Revolution, and used by the French government for about twelve years from late 1793. There were twelve months of 30 days each, grouped into three ten-day weeks called \"d\u00e9cades\". The five or six extra days needed to approximate the tropical year were placed after the months at the end of each year. A period of four years ending on a leap day was to be called a \"Franciade\". It began at the autumn equinox:\nEastern Ojibwe calendar.\nOjibwe month names are based on the key feature of the month. Consequently, months between various regions have different names based on the key feature of each month in their particular region. In the Eastern Ojibwe, this can be seen in when the sucker makes its run, which allows the Ojibwe to fish for them. Additionally, Rhodes also informs of not only the variability in the month names, but how in Eastern Ojibwe these names were originally applied to the lunar months the Ojibwe originally used, which was a lunisolar calendar, fixed by the date of \"Akiinaaniwan\" (typically December\u00a027) that marks when sunrise is the latest in the Northern Hemisphere.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The channel is about long and across at its narrowest point, and reaches a depth of about off the coast of Mozambique. A warm current, the Mozambique Current, flows in a southward direction in the channel, leading into the Agulhas Current off the east coast of Southern Africa.\nExtent.\nThe International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) defines the limits of the Mozambique Channel as follows:\n\"On the North.\" A line from the estuary of the River Rovuma () to Ras Habu, the northernmost point of Ile Grande Comore, the northernmost of the Comore (Comoro) Islands, to Cap d'Ambre (Cape Amber), the northern extremity of Madagascar ().\n\"On the East.\" The west coast of Madagascar.\n\"On the South.\" A line from Cap Sainte-Marie, the southern extremity of Madagascar to Ponto do Ouro on the mainland ().\n\"On the West.\" The coast of Southern Africa.\nHistory.\nOn 15 November 1939, under the command of Captain Patrick (Paddy) Dove, the British Coastal Tanker \"Africa Shell\" was sailing through the Mozambique Channel en-passage from Quelimane to Louren\u00e7o Marques. During the morning, at a point south-southwest from the lighthouse at Cape Zavora, she was spotted by the German Pocket Battleship , under the command of Captain Hans Langsdorff, and which was embarked upon a raiding sortie. \"Graf Spee\" ordered the \"Africa Shell\" to stop by the firing of a shot across her bow. Having stopped the \"Africa Shell,\" a cutter with a boarding party was despatched from \"Graf Spee\" and boarded the tanker, the officer in charge addressing Captain Dove in perfect English with the sentence, \"Good morning, captain. Sorry; fortunes of war\". The boarding party ordered the ship's crew into their lifeboats before stripping the \"Africa Shell\" of all foodstuffs including a small amount of wine. The crew were ordered to row for shore, except for Captain Dove who was taken prisoner on board the \"Graf Spee\". Dove was incensed by the interception of his ship, and complained personally to Langsdorff, citing that the \"Africa Shell\" was within Portuguese territorial waters and that the action was in clear violation of international law. The boarding party set scuttling charges and made their way back to the \"Graf Spee\". The detonation of the charges sank the \"Africa Shell\".\nIn 1942, the Mozambique Channel was a World War II clashpoint during the Battle of Madagascar.\nFrance is present through Mayotte and the Scattered Islands, and maintains a military presence via R\u00e9union, with naval assets patrolling fairly regularly. These islets provide exclusive economic zones (EEZs), rich in fisheries resources and potentially hydrocarbons. For France, the real challenge is to preserve its sovereignty over Mayotte, vis-\u00e0-vis the Comoros, and especially over the Scattered Islands, in the face of Malagasy threats. The Malagasy are legally contesting the French presence, believing that these islets were dependencies of Madagascar and that once independence was achieved, they should have reverted to Madagascar, not to France."}

A trained medical psychologist or clinical psychopharmacologist with prescriptive authority is a mid-level provider who prescribes psychotropic medication such as antidepressants for mental health disorders. However, a medical psychologist does not automatically equate with a psychologist having authority to prescribe medication. In fact, most medical psychologists do not prescribe medication and do not have authority to do so.\nMedical psychologists apply psychological theories, scientific psychological findings, and techniques of psychotherapy, behavior modification, cognitive, interpersonal, family, and lifestyle therapy to improve the psychological and physical health of the patient. Psychologists with postdoctoral specialty training as medical psychologists are the practitioners with refined skills in clinical psychology, health psychology, behavioral medicine, psychopharmacology, and medical science. Highly qualified and postgraduate specialized doctors are trained for service in primary care centers, hospitals, residential care centers, and long-term care facilities and in multidisciplinary collaboration and team treatment.\nMedical psychology specialty.\nThe field of medical psychology may include predoctoral training in the disciplines of health psychology, rehabilitation psychology, pediatric psychology, neuropsychology, and https://, as well as subspecialties in pain management, primary care psychology, and hospital-based (or medical school-based) psychology as the foundation psychological training to qualify for proceeding to required postdoctoral specialty training to qualify to become a diplomate/specialist in medical psychology. To be a specialist in medical psychology, a psychologist must hold board certification from the American Board of Medical Psychology (ABMP), which requires a doctorate degree in psychology, a license to practice psychology, a postdoctoral graduate degree or other acceptable postdoctoral didactic training, a residency in medical psychology, submission of a work product for examination, and a written and oral examination by the American Board of Medical Psychology. The American Board of Medical Psychology maintains a distinction between specialists and psychopharmacological psychologists or those interested in practicing one of the related psychological disciplines in primary care centers. The term \"medical psychologist\" is not an umbrella term, and many other specialties in psychology such as health psychology, embracing the biopsychosocial paradigm (Engel, 1977) of mental/physical health and extending that paradigm to clinical practice through research and the application of evidenced-based diagnostic and treatment procedures are akin to the specialty and are prepared to practice in integrated and primary care settings.\n The Louisiana Academy of Medical Psychology (LAMP), currently one of the largest organization of psychologists with prescriptive authority in the world and the only organization representing practitioners of medical psychology in Louisiana as defined by Louisiana statute within any jurisdiction in the United States, no longer recognizes the Academy of Medical Psychology as an adequate certifying body for its practitioners, and its members have resigned from the Academy of Medical Psychology en masse. Similarly, virtually all members of LAMP have also resigned from the Louisiana Psychological Association (LPA) after many LPA members uncovered that the LAMP's prescriptive authority movement covertly came to an agreement with Louisiana's medical board to transfer the entire practice of psychology for psychologists with prescriptive authority to the medical board. Louisiana is the only state in which the practice of psychology, including psychological testing, psychotherapy, diagnosis, and treatment for some psychologists (i.e., medical psychologists) is regulated by a medical board. \nAdopting the biopsychosocial paradigm, the field of medical psychology has recognized the Cartesian assumption that the body and mind are separate entities is inadequate, representing as it does an arbitrary dichotomy that works to the detriment of healthcare. The biopsychosocial approach reflects the concept that the psychology of an individual cannot be understood without reference to that individual's social environment. For the medical psychologist, the medical model of disease cannot in itself explain complex health concerns any more than a strict psychosocial (LeVine &amp; Orabona Foster, 2010) explanation of mental and physical health can in itself be comprehensive.\nDuties.\nMedical psychologists and some psychopharmacologists are trained and equipped to modify physical disease states and the actual cytoarchitecture and functioning of the central nervous and related systems using psychological and pharmacological techniques (when allowed by statute), and to provide prevention for the progression of disease having to do with poor personal and lifestyle choices and conceptualization, behavioral patterns, and chronic exposure to the effects of negative thinking, choosing, attitudes, and negative contexts. The specialty of medical psychology includes training in psychopharmacology and, in states providing statutory authority, may prescribe psychoactive substances as one technique in a larger treatment plan which includes psychological interventions. The medical psychologists and psychopharmacologists who serve in states that have not yet modernized their psychology prescribing laws may evaluate patients and recommend appropriate psychopharmacological techniques in collaboration with a state-authorized prescriber. Medical psychologists and psychopharmacologists who are not board certified strive to integrate the major components of an individual's psychological, biological, and social functioning and are designed to contribute to that person's well-being in a way that respects the natural interface among these components. The whole is greater than the sum of its parts when it comes to providing comprehensive and sensible behavioral healthcare and the medical psychologist is uniquely qualified to collaborate with physicians that are treating the patient's physical illnesses.\nCertifications.\nThe Academy of Medical Psychology defines medical psychology as a specialty trained at the postdoctoral level and designed to deliver advanced diagnostic and clinical interventions in medical and healthcare facilities utilizing the knowledge and skills of clinical psychology, health psychology, behavioral medicine, psychopharmacology and basic medical science. The Academy of Medical Psychology makes a distinction between the prescribing psychologist who is a psychologist with advanced training in psychopharmacology and may prescribe medicine or consult with a physician or other prescriber to diagnose mental illness and select and recommend appropriate psychoactive medicines. Medical psychologists are prepared to do the psychopharmacology consulting or prescribing, but also must have training which prepares them for functioning with behavioral and lifestyle components of physical disease and functioning in or in consultation with multidisciplinary healthcare teams in primary care centers or community hospitals in addition to traditional roles in the treatment of mental illness and substance abuse disorders. The specialty of medical psychology and this distinction from psychopharmacologist is recognized by the National Alliance of Professional Psychology Providers (the psychology national practitioner association; see www.nappp.org).\nThe specialty of medical psychology has established a specialty board certification, American Board of Medical Psychology and Academy of Medical Psychology (www.amphome.org) requiring a doctoral degree in psychology and extensive postdoctoral training in the specialty and the passage of an oral and written examination.\nAlthough the Academy of Medical Psychology defines medical psychology as a \"specialty,\" has established a \"specialty board certification,\" and is recognized by the national psychology practitioner association (www.nappp.org), there is a split between NAPPP and the American Psychological Association in that they do not currently recognize the same specialties. APA represents scientists, academics, and practitioners and NAPPP represents only practitioners. However, Louisiana, having a unique definition of medical psychology does recognize the national distinction between medical psychology as a specialty and a https:// and restricts the term and practice of medical psychology by statute (the Medical Psychology Practice Act) as a \"profession of the health sciences\" with prescriptive authority. The American Psychological Association does not recognize that the term medical psychology has, as a prerequisite, nor should the term be equated with having, prescriptive authority and has established a specialty in clinical psychopharmacology.\nIn 2006, the APA recommended that the education and training of psychologists, who are specifically pursuing one of several prerequisites for prescribing medication, integrate instruction in the biological sciences, clinical medicine, and pharmacology into a formalized program of postdoctoral education. In 2009, the National Alliance of Professional Providers in Psychology recognized the education and training specified by the American Board of Medical Psychology (www.amphome.org; ABMP) and the Academy of Medical Psychology as the approved standards for postgraduate training and examination and qualifications in the nationally recognized specialty in medical psychology. Since then, numerous hospitals, primary care centers, and other health facilities have recognized the ABMP standards and qualifications for privileges in healthcare facilities and verification of specialty status.\nThe following \"Clinical Competencies\" are identified as essential in the education and training of psychologists, wishing to pursue prescriptive authority. These recommended prerequisites are not required or specifically recommended by APA for the training and education of medical psychologists not pursuing prerequisites for prescribing medication.\nThe 2006 APA recommendations also include supervised clinical experience intended to integrate the above seven knowledge domains and assess competencies in skills and applied knowledge.\nThe national psychology practitioner association (NAPPP; www.nappp.org) and national certifying body (Academy of Medical Psychology; www.amphome.org) have established the national training, examination, and specialty practice criteria and guidelines in the specialty of medical psychology and have established a national journal in the specialty. Such certifying bodies view psychopharmacology training (either to prescribe or consult) as one component of the training of a specialist in medical psychology, but recognize that training and specialized skills in other aspects of the treatment of behavioral aspects of medical illness and mental illness affecting physical illness is essential to practice at the specialty level in medical psychology.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "20358", "revid": "19571410", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20358", "title": "Music lesson", "text": "Type of formal instruction in music\nMusic lessons are a type of formal instruction in playing a musical instrument or singing. Typically, a student taking music lessons meets a music teacher for one-to-one training sessions ranging from 30 minutes to one hour in length over a period of weeks or years. Depending on lessons to be taught, students learn different skills relevant to the instruments used. Music teachers also assign technical exercises, musical pieces, and other activities to help the students improve their musical skills. While most music lessons are one-on-one (private), some teachers also teach groups of two to four students (semi-private lessons), and, for very basic instruction, some instruments are taught in large group lessons, such as piano and acoustic guitar. Since the widespread availability of high speed. low latency Internet, private lessons can also take place through live video chat using webcams, microphones and videotelephony online.\nMusic lessons are part of both amateur music instruction and professional training. In amateur and recreational music contexts, children and adults take music lessons to improve their singing or instrumental playing skills and learn basic to intermediate techniques. In professional training contexts, such as music conservatories, university music performance programs (e.g., Bachelor of music, Master of music, DMA, etc.), students aiming for a career as professional musicians take a music lesson once a week for an hour or more with a music professor over a period of years to learn advanced playing or singing techniques. Many instrumental performers and singers, including a number of pop music celebrities, have learned music \"by ear\", especially in folk music styles such as blues and popular styles such as rock music. Nevertheless, even in folk and popular styles, a number of performers have had some type of music lessons, such as meeting with a vocal coach or getting childhood instruction in an instrument such as piano.\nPosture.\nFor vocal lessons, teachers show students how to sit or stand and breathe, and how to position the head and mouth for good vocal tone. For instrument lessons, teachers show students how to sit or stand with the instrument, how to hold the instrument, and how to manipulate the fingers and other body parts to produce tones and sounds from the instrument. For wind and brass instruments, the teacher shows the student how to use their lips, tongue, and breath to produce tones and sounds. For some instruments, teachers also train students in the use of the feet, as in the case of piano or other keyboard instruments that have damper or sustain pedals on the piano, the pedal keyboard on a pipe organ, and some drums and cymbals in the drum kit such as the bass drum pedal and the hi-hat cymbal pedal. In addition to teaching fingering, teachers also provide other types of instruction. A classical guitar player learns how to strum and pluck strings; players of wind instruments learn about breath control and embouchure, and singers learn how to make the most of their vocal cords without hurting the throat or vocal cords.\nTeachers also instruct students in achieving correct posture for most efficient playing and to prevent injury. For all instruments, the optimal way to move the fingers and arms to achieve a desired effect is to play with the least tension in your hands and body. This prevents habit formation that can injure the skeletal frame and muscles. For example, when playing the piano, \"fingering\"\u2014which fingers to put on which keys\u2014is a skill slowly learned as the student advances, and there are many standard techniques a teacher can pass on.\nThere are many myths and misconceptions among music teachers, especially in the Western classical tradition, about \"good\" posture and \"bad\" posture. Students who find that playing their instruments causes them physical pain should bring this to their teachers' attention. It could be a potentially serious health risk, but it is often overlooked when learning to play an instrument. Learning to use one's body in a manner consistent with the way their anatomy is designed to work can mean the difference between a crippling injury and a lifetime of enjoyment. Many music teachers would caution students about taking \"no pain, no gain\" as an acceptable response from their music teacher regarding a complaint of physical pain. Concerns about use-related injury and the ergonomics of musicianship have gained more mainstream acceptance in recent years. Musicians have increasingly been turning to medical professionals, physical therapists, and specialized techniques seeking relief from pain and prevention of serious injury. There exists a plurality of special techniques for an even greater plurality of potential difficulties. The Alexander Technique is just one example of these specialized approaches.\nTheory and history.\nTo fully understand music being played, the student must learn the basics of the underlying music theory. Along with musical notation, students learn rhythmic techniques\u2014like controlling tempo, recognizing time signatures, and the theory of harmony, including chords and key signatures. In addition to basic theory, a good teacher stresses \"musicality\", or how to make the music sound good. This includes how to create good, pleasing tone, how to do musical phrasing, and how to use dynamics (loudness and softness) to make the piece or song more expressive.\nMost music lessons include some instruction in the history of the type of music that the student is learning. When a student is taking Western classical music lessons, music teachers often spend some time explaining the different eras of western classical music, such as the Baroque Era, the Classical era, the Romantic Era, and the contemporary classical music era, because each era is associated with different styles of music and different performance practice techniques. Instrumental music from the Baroque era is often played in the 2000s as teaching pieces for piano students, string instrument players, and wind instrument players. If students just try to play these Baroque pieces by reading the notes from the score, they might not get the right type of interpretation. However, once a student learns that most Baroque instrumental music was associated with dances, such as the gavotte and the sarabande, and keyboard music from the Baroque era was played on the harpsichord or the pipe organ, a modern-day student is better able to understand how the piece should be played. If, for example, a cello player is assigned a gavotte that was originally written for harpsichord, this gives the student insight in how to play the piece. Since it is a dance, it should have a regular, clear pulse, rather than a Romantic era-style shifting tempo rubato. As well, since it was originally written for the harpsichord, a light-sounding keyboard instrument in which the strings are plucked with quills, this suggests that the notes should be played relatively lightly, and with spaces between each note, rather than in a full-bodied, sustained legato.\nTechnical exercises.\nAlthough not universally accepted, many teachers drill students with the repetitive playing of certain patterns, such as scales, arpeggios, and rhythms. Scales are often taught because they are the building blocks of melody in most Western art music. In addition, there are flexibility studies, which make it physically easier to play the instrument. \nPercussion instruments use rudiments that help in the development of sticking patterns, roll techniques and other little nuances such as flams and drags.\nThere are sets of exercises for piano designed to stretch the connection between fourth and fifth fingers, making them more independent. Brass players practice \"lip slurs\", which are unarticulated changes in embouchure between partials. Woodwind players (Saxophone, Clarinet, and Flute) have a multitude of exercises to help with tonguing techniques, finger dexterity, and tone development. Entire books of \u00e9tudes have been written to this purpose.\nRepertoire.\nTeachers typically assign the student pieces (or songs for vocal students) of slowly increasing difficulty. These may include \u00e9tudes, solo, or chamber repertoire. Besides using pieces to teach various musical rudiments (rhythm, harmony, pitch, etc.) and teach the elements of good playing (or singing) style, a good teacher also inspires more intangible qualities\u2014such as expressiveness and musicianship. Pieces (or songs) may be more enjoyable for students than theory or scale exercises, and an emphasis on learning new pieces is usually required to maintain students' motivation. However, the teacher must not over-accommodate a student's desire for \"fun\" pieces. Often the student's idea of fun music is popular vocal selections, movie soundtracks, and TV show theme songs, etc. While some of these \"fun\" pieces can be performed, pieces should also be selected for pedagogical reasons, such as challenging the student and honing their skills. In addition, for students to be well rounded they must play many types of pieces by composers and songwriters from different eras, ranging from Renaissance music to pieces from the 20th and 21st century. A varied repertoire increases the student's musical understanding and skill.\nExaminations.\nA popular measure of progress, especially for children, is external assessment of the progress of the pupil by a regular examination. A number of exam boards assess pupils on music theory or practice. These are available for almost every musical instrument. A common method to mark progress is graded examinations\u2014for example from grade 1 (beginner) to grade 8 (ready to enter higher study at music school). Some teachers prefer other methods of target-setting for their pupils. The most common is the pupil's concert, which gives experience in playing in public and under a certain degree of pressure, without outright criticism or a more or less arbitrary marking system. Another is the graded system of books followed by teachers of the Suzuki method, in which the completion of each book is celebrated, without a system of marking or ranking of pupils.\nExtra-musical benefits.\nSome studies suggests that music lessons provide children with important developmental benefits beyond simply the knowledge or skill of playing a musical instrument. Research suggests that musical lessons may enhance intelligence and academic achievement, build self-esteem and improve discipline. A recent Rockefeller Foundation Study found that music majors have the highest rate of admittance to medical schools, followed by biochemistry and the humanities. On SAT tests, the national average scores were 427 on the verbal and 476 on math. At the same time, music students averaged 465 on the verbal and 497 on the math \u2013 38 and 21 points higher, respectively. However, the observed correlation between musical and mathematical ability may be inherent rather than acquired. Furthermore, it is possible that the correlation between taking music lessons and academic ability exists because both are strongly correlated with parental income and education. Even if music lessons had no impact on academic ability, one would expect to see a correlation between music lessons and academic ability. An article from Inc.com titled \"The Benefits of Playing Music Help Your Brain More Than Any Other Activity\" says that studies show that learning a musical instrument expands neuronal cell body capacity in numerous brain areas. It also reinforces the long-range links between them. Even more research shows that musical pedagogy can amplify verbal memory, spatial reasoning, and literacy skills.\nSkills learned through the discipline of music may transfer to study skills, communication skills, and cognitive skills useful in every part of a child's studies at school, though. An in-depth Harvard University study found evidence that spatial-temporal reasoning improves when children learn to make music, and this kind of reasoning improves temporarily when adults listen to certain kinds of music, including Mozart. This finding (named \"The Mozart effect\") suggests that music and spatial reasoning are related psychologically (i.e., they may rely on some of the same underlying skills) and perhaps neurologically as well. However, there has been considerable controversy over this as later researchers have failed to reproduce the original findings of Rauscher (e.g. Steele, Bass &amp; Crook, 1999), questioned both theory and methodology of the original study (Fudis &amp; Lembesis 2004) and suggested that the enhancing effects of music in experiments have been simply due to an increased level of arousal (Thompson, Schellenberg &amp; Husain, 2001).\nA relationship between music and the strengthening of math, dance, reading, creative thinking and visual arts skills has also been reported in literature. (Winner, Hetland, Sanni, as reported in \"The Arts and Academic Achievement \u2013 What the Evidence Shows\", 2000) However recent findings by Dr. Levitin of McGill University in Montreal, Canada, undermines the suggested connection between musical ability and higher math skills. In a study conducted on patients with Williams syndrome (a genetic disorder causing low intelligence), he found that even though their intelligence was that of young children, they still possessed an unusually high level of musical ability.\nPedagogy.\nMusic lesson (also known as studio or applied music) pedagogy and instruction has many influences and aspects. Both the teaching methods and content of music lessons must be somewhat varied according to the level of the student, the goals of the lessons, the student's age, and the instructional context. Interpersonal rapport between student and teacher is another important element of studio music pedagogy. Other important factors important to student outcomes include how instructors communicate, their skills at teaching, how they organize their lessons, and how flexible they are to making adjustments. Some teachers also view physical proximity and energy as important aspects of music instruction.\nStudio lesson teachers often embody different pedagogical approaches and philosophies. Two broad teaching philosophies can be categorized as the transfer approach and the transformative approach. The transfer approach is primarily performance and outcome-based. The most important goals of the lesson are confined to the technical quality of the musical performance. The transformative approach, by comparison, is rooted in constructivist educational philosophy and is not only concerned with technique and musical execution, but also with person-based learning and artistic processes. These two approaches show that musical technique is not necessarily the only goal of music lesson instruction.\nSuccessful instructors are often deliberate and clear, explain practice strategies in detail, account for students' emotional needs, and elevate the long-term performance expectations for their students. The student's specific needs, strengths, and challenges can also influence the teacher's choice of pedagogy. High achieving students may be well suited to unmodified strategies, whereas intermediate students may benefit from modifications. For example, a studio teacher focused on a specific aspect of music and seeking high achievement in one area may momentarily accept a lower performance level on other aspects that are unrelated to the focus objective.\nUnderstanding their student\u2019s perspectives helps music lesson teachers support their students. A primary concern for any lesson instructor is student motivation for the long-term learning of an instrument. Student motivation pertains to how students of all ages develop the desire to study musical instruments, how and how much they value the learning, what influences their persistence/intensity of study, and student self-perception of success or failure. Motivation is a prerequisite for student development of adaptive behaviors that increase success in personal goals. Relevant to motivation are expectancy-value theory, self-efficacy constructs, flow theory, attribution theory, and mastery motivational patterns. Musical learning is also socially influenced by teachers, parents, and others.\nPracticing by the student is another integral aspect of musical learning through music lessons. Student practice is often unsupervised and usually takes place outside of the lesson. Instructors often focus on teaching students how to practice using methods such as increasing the tempo of a piece from slow to faster, analyzing pieces, marking or annotating the music, setting practice goals, practicing in more frequent shorter sessions, and using a metronome. Teachers can influence students through the demonstration of practice methods or verbal description, although demonstration is often more effective.\nMusic lessons are an important part of both music performance and music education degree programs in higher education. Both music education and performance majors can expect to teach music lessons in their musical careers. Students benefit from courses which teach studio instructional methods, allow students to practice instructional techniques, engage in self-reflection, and refine their pedagogy.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

As many mutations can cause cancer in animals, such mutagens can therefore be carcinogens, although not all necessarily are. All mutagens have characteristic mutational signatures with some chemicals becoming mutagenic through cellular processes.\nThe process of DNA becoming modified is called mutagenesis. Not all mutations are caused by mutagens: so-called \"spontaneous mutations\" occur due to spontaneous hydrolysis, errors in DNA replication, repair and recombination.\nDiscovery.\nThe first mutagens to be identified were carcinogens, substances that were shown to be linked to cancer. Tumors were described more than 2,000 years before the discovery of chromosomes and DNA; in 500 B.C., the Greek physician Hippocrates named tumors resembling a crab \"karkinos\" (from which the word \"cancer\" is derived via Latin), meaning crab. In 1567, Swiss physician Paracelsus suggested that an unidentified substance in mined ore (identified as radon gas in modern times) caused a wasting disease in miners, and in England, in 1761, John Hill made the first direct link of cancer to chemical substances by noting that excessive use of snuff may cause nasal cancer. In 1775, Sir Percivall Pott wrote a paper on the high incidence of scrotal cancer in chimney sweeps, and suggested chimney soot as the cause of scrotal cancer. In 1915, Yamagawa and Ichikawa showed that repeated application of coal tar to rabbit's ears produced malignant cancer. Subsequently, in the 1930s the carcinogen component in coal tar was identified as a polyaromatic hydrocarbon (PAH), benzo[a]pyrene. Polyaromatic hydrocarbons are also present in soot, which was suggested to be a causative agent of cancer over 150 years earlier.\nThe association of exposure to radiation and cancer had been observed as early as 1902, six years after the discovery of X-ray by Wilhelm R\u00f6ntgen and radioactivity by Henri Becquerel. Georgii Nadson and German Filippov were the first who created fungi mutants under ionizing radiation in 1925. The mutagenic property of mutagens was first demonstrated in 1927, when Hermann Muller discovered that x-rays can cause genetic mutations in fruit flies, producing phenotypic mutants as well as observable changes to the chromosomes, visible due to the presence of enlarged \"polytene\" chromosomes in fruit fly salivary glands. His collaborator Edgar Altenburg also demonstrated the mutational effect of UV radiation in 1928. Muller went on to use x-rays to create Drosophila mutants that he used in his studies of genetics. He also found that X-rays not only mutate genes in fruit flies, but also have effects on the genetic makeup of humans. Similar work by Lewis Stadler also showed the mutational effect of X-rays on barley in 1928, and ultraviolet (UV) radiation on maize in 1936. The effect of sunlight had previously been noted in the nineteenth century where rural outdoor workers and sailors were found to be more prone to skin cancer.\nChemical mutagens were not demonstrated to cause mutation until the 1940s, when Charlotte Auerbach and J. M. Robson found that mustard gas can cause mutations in fruit flies. A large number of chemical mutagens have since been identified, especially after the development of the Ames test in the 1970s by Bruce Ames that screens for mutagens and allows for preliminary identification of carcinogens. Early studies by Ames showed around 90% of known carcinogens can be identified in Ames test as mutagenic (later studies however gave lower figures), and ~80% of the mutagens identified through Ames test may also be carcinogens.\nDifference between mutagens and carcinogens.\nMutagens are not necessarily carcinogens, and vice versa. Sodium azide for example may be mutagenic (and highly toxic), but it has not been shown to be carcinogenic. Meanwhile, compounds which are not directly mutagenic but stimulate cell growth which can reduce the effectiveness of DNA repair and indirectly increase the chance of mutations, and therefore that of cancer. One example of this would be anabolic steroids, which stimulate growth of the prostate gland and increase the risk of prostate cancer among others. Other carcinogens may cause cancer through a variety of mechanisms without producing mutations, such as tumour promotion, immunosuppression that reduces the ability to fight cancer cells or pathogens that can cause cancer, disruption of the endocrine system (e.g. in breast cancer), tissue-specific toxicity, and inflammation (e.g. in colorectal cancer).\nDifference between mutagens and DNA damaging agents.\nA DNA damaging agent is an agent that causes a change in the structure of DNA that is not necessarily replicated when the DNA is replicated. Examples of DNA damage include a chemical addition or disruption of a nucleotide base in DNA (generating an abnormal nucleotide or nucleotide fragment), or a break in one or both strands in DNA. When duplex DNA containing a damaged base is replicated, an incorrect base may be inserted in the newly synthesized strand opposite the damaged base in the complementary template strand, and this can become a mutation in the next round of replication. Also a DNA double-strand break may be repaired by an inaccurate process leading to an altered base pair, a mutation. However, mutations and DNA damages differ in a fundamental way: mutations can, in principle, be replicated when DNA replicates, whereas DNA damages are not necessarily replicated. Thus DNA damaging agents often cause mutations as a secondary consequence, but not all DNA damages lead to mutation and not all mutations arise from a DNA damage. The term genotoxic means toxic (damaging) to DNA.\nEffects.\nMutagens can cause changes to the DNA and are therefore genotoxic. They can affect the transcription and replication of the DNA, which in severe cases can lead to cell death. The mutagen produces mutations in the DNA, and deleterious mutation can result in aberrant, impaired or loss of function for a particular gene, and accumulation of mutations may lead to cancer. Mutagens may therefore be also carcinogens. However, some mutagens exert their mutagenic effect through their metabolites, and therefore whether such mutagens actually become carcinogenic may be dependent on the metabolic processes of an organism, and a compound shown to be mutagenic in one organism may not necessarily be carcinogenic in another.\nDifferent mutagens act on DNA differently. Powerful mutagens may result in chromosomal instability, causing chromosomal breakages and rearrangement of the chromosomes such as translocation, deletion, and inversion. Such mutagens are called clastogens. \nSome mutagens can cause aneuploidy and change the number of chromosomes in the cell. They are known as aneuploidogens or aneugens.\nMutagens may also modify the DNA sequence; the changes in nucleic acid sequences by mutations include substitution of nucleotide base-pairs and insertions and deletions of one or more nucleotides in DNA sequences. Although some of these mutations are lethal or cause serious disease, many have minor effects as they do not result in residue changes that have significant effect on the structure and function of the proteins. Many mutations are silent mutations, causing no visible effects at all, either because they occur in non-coding or non-functional sequences, or they do not change the amino-acid sequence due to the redundancy of codons.\nIn Ames test, where the varying concentrations of the chemical are used in the test, the dose response curve obtained is nearly always linear, suggesting that there may be no threshold for mutagenesis. Similar results are also obtained in studies with radiations, indicating that there may be no safe threshold for mutagens. However, the no-threshold model is disputed with some arguing for a dose rate dependent threshold for mutagenesis. Some have proposed that low level of some mutagens may stimulate the DNA repair processes and therefore may not necessarily be harmful. More recent approaches with sensitive analytical methods have shown that there may be non-linear or bilinear dose-responses for genotoxic effects, and that the activation of DNA repair pathways can prevent the occurrence of mutation arising from a low dose of mutagen.\nTypes of Mutagens.\nMutagens may be of physical, chemical or biological origin. They may act directly on the DNA, causing direct damage to the DNA, and most often result in replication error. Some however may act on the replication mechanism and chromosomal partition. Many mutagens are not mutagenic by themselves, but can form mutagenic metabolites through cellular processes, for example through the activity of the cytochrome P450 system and other oxygenases such as cyclooxygenase. Such mutagens are called promutagens.\nChemical mutagens.\nChemical mutagens either directly or indirectly damage DNA. On this basis, they are of 2 types:\nDirectly acting chemical mutagens.\nThey directly damage DNA, but may or may not undergo metabolism to produce promutagens (metabolites that can have higher mutagenic potential than their substrates).\nIndirectly acting chemical mutagens.\nThey are not necessarily mutagenic by themselves, but they produce promutagens mutagenic compounds through metabolic processes in cells.\nSome chemical mutagens additionally require UV or visible light activation for their mutagenic effect. These are the &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;photomutagens, which include furocoumarins and limettin.\nMetals.\nMany metals, such as arsenic, cadmium, chromium, nickel and their compounds may be mutagenic, but they may act, however, via a number of different mechanisms. Arsenic, chromium, iron, and nickel may be associated with the production of ROS, and some of these may also alter the fidelity of DNA replication. Nickel may also be linked to DNA hypermethylation and histone deacetylation, while some metals such as cobalt, arsenic, nickel and cadmium may also affect DNA repair processes such as DNA mismatch repair, and base and nucleotide excision repair.\nProtection.\nAntioxidants are an important group of anticarcinogenic compounds that may help remove ROS or potentially harmful chemicals. These may be found naturally in fruits and vegetables. Examples of antioxidants are vitamin A and its carotenoid precursors, vitamin C, vitamin E, polyphenols, and various other compounds. \u03b2-Carotene is the red-orange colored compounds found in vegetables like carrots and tomatoes. Vitamin C may prevent some cancers by inhibiting the formation of mutagenic N-nitroso compounds (nitrosamine). Flavonoids, such as EGCG in green tea, have also been shown to be effective antioxidants and may have anti-cancer properties. Epidemiological studies indicate that a diet rich in fruits and vegetables is associated with lower incidence of some cancers and longer life expectancy, however, the effectiveness of antioxidant supplements in cancer prevention in general is still the subject of some debate.\nOther chemicals may reduce mutagenesis or prevent cancer via other mechanisms, although for some the precise mechanism for their protective property may not be certain. Selenium, which is present as a micronutrient in vegetables, is a component of important antioxidant enzymes such as gluthathione peroxidase. Many phytonutrients may counter the effect of mutagens; for example, sulforaphane in vegetables such as broccoli has been shown to be protective against prostate cancer. Others that may be effective against cancer include indole-3-carbinol from cruciferous vegetables and resveratrol from red wine.\nAn effective precautionary measure an individual can undertake to protect themselves is by limiting exposure to mutagens such as UV radiations and tobacco smoke. In Australia, where people with pale skin are often exposed to strong sunlight, melanoma is the most common cancer diagnosed in people aged 15\u201344 years.\nIn 1981, human epidemiological analysis by Richard Doll and Richard Peto indicated that smoking caused 30% of cancers in the US. Diet is also thought to cause a significant number of cancer fatalities, and it has been estimated that around 32% of cancer deaths may be avoidable by modification to the diet. Mutagens identified in food include mycotoxins from food contaminated with fungal growths, such as aflatoxins which may be present in contaminated peanuts and corn; heterocyclic amines generated in meat when cooked at high temperature; PAHs in charred meat and smoked fish, as well as in oils, fats, bread, and cereal; and nitrosamines generated from nitrites used as food preservatives in cured meat such as bacon (ascorbate, which is added to cured meat, however, reduces nitrosamine formation). Overly-browned starchy food such as bread, biscuits and potatoes can generate acrylamide, a chemical shown to cause cancer in animal studies. Excessive alcohol consumption has also been linked to cancer; the possible mechanisms for its carcinogenicity include formation of the possible mutagen acetaldehyde, and the induction of the cytochrome P450 system which is known to produce mutagenic compounds from promutagens.\nFor certain mutagens, such as dangerous chemicals and radioactive materials, as well as infectious agents known to cause cancer, government legislations and regulatory bodies are necessary for their control.\nTest systems.\nMany different systems for detecting mutagen have been developed. Animal systems may more accurately reflect the metabolism of human, however, they are expensive and time-consuming (may take around three years to complete), they are therefore not used as a first screen for mutagenicity or carcinogenicity.\nYeast.\nSystems similar to Ames test have been developed in yeast. \"Saccharomyces cerevisiae\" is generally used. These systems can check for forward and reverse mutations, as well as recombinant events.\n\"Drosophila\".\nSex-Linked Recessive Lethal Test \u2013 Males from a strain with yellow bodies are used in this test. The gene for the yellow body lies on the X-chromosome. The fruit flies are fed on a diet of test chemical, and progenies are separated by sex. The surviving males are crossed with the females of the same generation, and if no males with yellow bodies are detected in the second generation, it would indicate a lethal mutation on the X-chromosome has occurred.\nPlant assays.\nPlants such as \"Zea mays\", \"Arabidopsis thaliana\" and \"Tradescantia\" have been used in various test assays for mutagenecity of chemicals.\nCell culture assay.\nMammalian cell lines such as Chinese hamster V79 cells, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells or mouse lymphoma cells may be used to test for mutagenesis. Such systems include the HPRT assay for resistance to 8-azaguanine or 6-thioguanine, and ouabain-resistance (OUA) assay.\nRat primary hepatocytes may also be used to measure DNA repair following DNA damage. Mutagens may stimulate unscheduled DNA synthesis that results in more stained nuclear material in cells following exposure to mutagens.\nChromosome check systems.\nThese systems check for large scale changes to the chromosomes and may be used with cell culture or in animal test. The chromosomes are stained and observed for any changes. Sister chromatid exchange is a symmetrical exchange of chromosome material between sister chromatids and may be correlated to the mutagenic or carcinogenic potential of a chemical. In micronucleus Test, cells are examined for micronuclei, which are fragments or chromosomes left behind at anaphase, and is therefore a test for clastogenic agents that cause chromosome breakages. Other tests may check for various chromosomal aberrations such as chromatid and chromosomal gaps and deletions, translocations, and ploidy.\nAnimal test systems.\nRodents are usually used in animal test. The chemicals under\ntest are usually administered in the food and in the drinking water, but sometimes by dermal application, by gavage, or by inhalation, and carried out over the major part of the life span for rodents. In tests that check for carcinogens, maximum tolerated dosage is first determined, then a range of doses are given to around 50 animals throughout the notional lifespan of the animal of two years. After death the animals are examined for sign of tumours. Differences in metabolism between rat and human however means that human may not respond in exactly the same way to mutagen, and dosages that produce tumours on the animal test may also be unreasonably high for a human, i.e. the equivalent amount required to produce tumours in human may far exceed what a person might encounter in real life.\nMice with recessive mutations for a visible phenotype may also be used to check for mutagens. Females with recessive mutation crossed with wild-type males would yield the same phenotype as the wild-type, and any observable change to the phenotype would indicate that a mutation induced by the mutagen has occurred.\nMice may also be used for dominant lethal assays where early embryonic deaths are monitored. Male mice are treated with chemicals under test, mated with females, and the females are then sacrificed before parturition and early fetal deaths are counted in the uterine horns.\nTransgenic mouse assay using a mouse strain infected with a viral shuttle vector is another method for testing mutagens. Animals are first treated with suspected mutagen, the mouse DNA is then isolated and the phage segment recovered and used to infect \"E. coli\". Using similar method as the blue-white screen, the plaque formed with DNA containing mutation are white, while those without are blue.\nIn anti-cancer therapy.\nMany mutagens are highly toxic to proliferating cells, and they are often used to destroy cancer cells. Alkylating agents such as cyclophosphamide and cisplatin, as well as intercalating agent such as daunorubicin and doxorubicin may be used in chemotherapy. However, due to their effect on other cells which are also rapidly dividing, they may have side effects such as hair loss and nausea. Research on better targeted therapies may reduce such side-effects. Ionizing radiations are used in radiation therapy.\nIn fiction.\nIn science fiction, mutagens are often represented as substances that are capable of completely changing the form of the recipient or granting them superpowers; powerful radiations are the agents of mutation for the superheroes in Marvel Comics's Fantastic Four and Hulk, while in the Ninja Turtles franchise, the mutagen is possessed as an \"ooze\", and for Inhumans, the mutagen is called the Terrigen Mist. Sometimes a mutagen can transform people into horrifying monsters that may threaten humanity, as in the 1973 short story \"Gray Matter\" by Stephen King. Mutagens are also featured in video games such as \"Cyberia,\" System Shock, \"The Witcher\", ', ', \"Resident Evil\", \"Infamous\", \"Freedom Force, Command &amp; Conquer\", \"Gears of War 3\", \"StarCraft\", \"BioShock\", \"Fallout\", \"Underrail\", and \"Maneater\".\nIn the \"nuclear monster\" films of the 1950s, nuclear radiation mutates humans and common insects often to enormous size and aggression; these films include \"Godzilla\", \"Them!\", \"Attack of the 50 Foot Woman\", \"Tarantula!\", and \"The Amazing Colossal Man\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

While serving in that capacity, he was killed, becoming the first certified fatality of the September 11 attacks.\nEarly life.\nMychal Judge was born Robert Emmett Judge on May 11, 1933, in Brooklyn, New York, the son of immigrants from County Leitrim, Ireland, and the firstborn of a pair of fraternal twins. His twin sister Dympna was born two days later. Judge was baptized in St. Paul's Church in Brooklyn on June 4. The twins, and their older sister Erin, grew up during the Great Depression.\nFrom the ages of three to six, he watched his father suffer and die of mastoiditis, a slow and painful illness of the skull and inner ear. To earn income following his father's death, Judge shined shoes at New York Penn Station and visited St. Francis of Assisi Church, located across the street. Seeing the Franciscan friars there, he later said, \"I realized that I didn't care for material things...I knew then that I wanted to be a friar.\"\nCareer.\nAfter spending his freshman year at the St. Francis Preparatory School in Queens, where he studied under the Franciscan Brothers of Brooklyn, in 1948, at the age of 15, Judge began the formation process to enter the Order of Friars Minor. He transferred to St. Joseph's Seraphic Seminary in Callicoon, New York, the minor seminary of the Holy Name province of the Order. After graduation, he enrolled at St. Bonaventure University in Olean, New York. In 1954 he was admitted to the novitiate of the Province in Paterson, New Jersey. After completing that year of formation, he received the religious habit and professed his first vows as a member of the Order. At that time, he was given the religious name of Fallon Michael. He later dropped 'Fallon' and changed 'Michael' to Mychal. According to \"Queer There and Everywhere\" by Sarah Prager, Mychal changed his name to \"differentiate himself from all the other 'Father Michaels.'\" He resumed his college studies at St. Bonaventure University, where he earned a bachelor's degree in 1957. He professed his solemn vows as a full member of the Order in 1958. Following this, he did his theological studies at Holy Name College Seminary in Washington, D.C. Upon completing these studies in 1961, he was ordained a priest.\nAfter his ordination, Judge was assigned to the Shrine of St. Anthony in Boston, Massachusetts. Following his assignment there, he served in various parishes served by the Franciscans: St. Joseph Parish in East Rutherford, New Jersey, Sacred Heart Parish in Rochelle Park, New Jersey, Holy Cross Parish in the Bronx and St. Joseph Parish in West Milford, New Jersey. For three years he served as assistant to the President of Siena College, operated by the Franciscans in Loudonville, New York. In 1986 he was assigned to St. Francis of Assisi Church in Manhattan, where he had first come to know the friars. He lived and worked there until his death.\nAround 1971, Judge developed alcoholism, although he never showed obvious signs. In 1978, with the support of Alcoholics Anonymous, he became sober and continued to share his personal story of alcoholism to help others facing addiction.\nIn 1992, Judge was appointed a chaplain to the New York City Fire Department. As chaplain, he offered encouragement and prayers at fires, rescues, and hospitals, and counseled firemen and their families, often working 16-hour days. \"His whole ministry was about love. Mychal loved the fire department and they loved him.\" Judge was a member of AFSCME Local 299 (District Council 37).\nJudge was also well known in the city for ministering to the homeless, the hungry, recovering alcoholics, people with AIDS, the sick, injured, and grieving, immigrants, gays and lesbians, and those alienated by society. Judge once gave the winter coat off his back to a homeless woman in the street, later saying, \"She needed it more than me.\" When he anointed a man who was dying of AIDS, the man asked him, \"Do you think God hates me?\" Judge picked him up, kissed him, and silently rocked him in his arms. Judge worked with St. Clare's Hospital, which opened the city's first AIDS ward, in order to start an active AIDS ministry. He visited hospitals and AIDS patients and their families, presided over many funerals, and counseled other Catholics such as Brendan Fay and John McNeill. Judge continued to be an advocate for gay rights throughout the rest of his life, marching in pride parades and attending other gay events.\nEven before his death, many considered Judge to be a living saint for his extraordinary works of charity and his deep spirituality. While praying, he would sometimes \"become so lost in God, as if lost in a trance, that he'd be shocked to find several hours had passed.\" Judge's spiritual director, the late Jesuit John J. McNeill, observed that Judge achieved an \"extraordinary degree of union with the divine. We knew we were dealing with someone directly in line with God.\"\nSeptember 11 attacks.\nOn September 11, 2001, upon learning that the World Trade Center had been hit by the first of two jetliners, Judge rushed to the site. He was met by Rudolph Giuliani, the Mayor of New York City, who asked him to pray for the city and its victims. Judge prayed over bodies lying on the streets, then entered the lobby of the North Tower, where an emergency command post had been organized. There he continued offering aid and prayers for the rescuers, the injured, and the dead.\nWhen the neighboring South Tower collapsed at 9:59a.m., debris went flying through the North Tower lobby, killing many inside. Judge died at this moment, too, struck and killed by the debris. According to a later interview with 1st Battalion Chief Joseph Pfeifer, it was initially believed that he had suffered a heart attack. In the moment before his death, Judge was repeatedly praying aloud, \"Jesus, please end this right now! God, please end this!\", according to Judge's biographer and \"New York Daily News\" columnist Michael Daly.\nShortly after his death, Judge's body was found and carried out of the North Tower by five people (Firefighters Christian Waugh and Zachary Vause, NYPD Lt. William Cosgrove, civilian John Maguire and FDNY EMT Kevin Allen) shortly before it collapsed at 10:28a.m. This act was photographed by Reuters photographer Shannon Stapleton, and became one of the most famous photographs taken during the attacks. This event was captured in the documentary film \"9/11\", shot by Jules and Gedeon Naudet. The \"Philadelphia Weekly\" reported that the photograph is \"considered an American \"Piet\u00e0\".\" Judge's body was placed before the altar of St. Peter's Catholic Church before being taken by ambulance and fire department colleagues to Engine 1/Ladder 24, the fire station opposite the Franciscan Friary on W 31st Street in Manhattan. He was later taken from the fire station to the medical examiner.\nJudge was designated as \"Victim 0001\" and thereby recognized as the first named victim of the attacks. Although thousands of others had been killed before him, with Daniel Lewin largely believed to have been the first chronological fatality of the attacks, Judge was the first certified fatality because his body was the first to be recovered and taken to the medical examiner.\nJudge's body was formally identified by NYPD Detective Steven McDonald, a long-time friend. The New York Medical Examiner found that Judge died of \"blunt force trauma to the head\".\nPersonal life.\nFollowing his death, a few of Judge's friends and associates revealed that Judge was gay. According to Fire Department Commissioner Thomas Von Essen: \"I actually knew about his homosexuality when I was in the Uniformed Firefighters Association. I kept the secret, but then he told me when I became commissioner five years ago. He and I often laughed about it, because we knew how difficult it would have been for the other firemen to accept it as easily as I had. I just thought he was a phenomenal, warm, sincere man, and the fact that he was gay just had nothing to do with anything.\"\nJudge developed a romantic relationship with a Filipino nurse named Al Alvarado in the last year of his life, which Judge documented in his diaries. The two often did not see each other for months because of Judge's work as a firefighter.\nThe revelations about his sexual orientation were not without controversy. Dennis Lynch, a lawyer, wrote an article about Judge that appeared on the website catholic.org. Lynch said that Judge was not gay and that any attempt to define him as gay was due to \"homosexual activists\" who wanted to \"attack the Catholic Church\" and turn the priest into a \"homosexual icon\". Others refuted Lynch with evidence that Judge did in fact identify himself as gay, both to others and in his personal journals.\nJudge was a long-term member of Dignity, a Catholic LGBT activist organization that advocates for change in the Catholic Church's teaching on homosexuality. On October 1, 1986, the Vatican's Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith issued an encyclical, \"On the Pastoral Care of Homosexual Persons\", which declared homosexuality to be a \"strong tendency ordered toward an intrinsic moral evil\". In response, many bishops, including Cardinal John O'Connor, banned Dignity from diocesan churches under their control. Judge then welcomed Dignity's AIDS ministry to the Church of St. Francis of Assisi, which is under the control of the Franciscan friars, thereby partially circumventing the cardinal's ban of Dignity.\nJudge disagreed with official Catholic teaching regarding homosexuality. Judge often asked, \"Is there so much love in the world that we can afford to discriminate against any kind of love?\"\nLegacy.\nOn September 15, 2001, 3,000 people attended Judge's funeral Mass at St. Francis of Assisi Church, which was presided over by Cardinal Edward Egan, the Archbishop of New York. Former President Bill Clinton and Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton also attended. President Clinton said that Judge's death was a \"special loss. We should lift his life up as an example of what has to prevail. We have to be more like Father Mike than the people who killed him.\"\nJudge was buried in the friars' plot at Holy Sepulchre Cemetery in Totowa, New Jersey. On October 11, 2001, Brendan Fay organized a \"Month's Mind Memorial\" in Good Shepherd Chapel, General Theological Seminary, New York. It was an evening of prayer, stories, traditional Irish music, and personal testimonials about Judge.\nSome Catholics called for the canonization of Judge. The Orthodox-Catholic Church of America declared him a saint. Two people have said they experienced miraculous healings through prayers to Judge.\nJudge's fire helmet was presented to Pope John Paul II. France awarded him the L\u00e9gion d'honneur. Some members of the United States Congress nominated him for the Congressional Gold Medal, as well as the Presidential Medal of Freedom. In 2002, the City of New York renamed the portion of West 31st Street on which the friary where he lived is located as \"Father Mychal F. Judge Street\", and christened a commuter ferry the \"Father Mychal Judge\" in his honor in 2002.\nIn 2002, the United States Congress passed \"The Mychal Judge Police and Fire Chaplains Public Safety Officers Benefit Act\" into law. The law extended federal death benefits to chaplains of police and fire departments, and also marked the first time the federal government extended equal benefits for same-sex couples by allowing the domestic partners of public safety officers killed in the line of duty to collect a federal death benefit. This act was signed into law on June 24, 2002, but would be retroactive only to September 11, 2001.\nThe New York Press Club instituted The Rev. Mychal Judge Heart of New York Award, which is presented annually for the news story or series that is most complimentary of New York City.\nA campaign has been started in East Rutherford, New Jersey, to have a statue of Judge erected in its Memorial Park.\nAlvernia University, a private independent college in the Franciscan tradition in Reading, Pennsylvania, named a new residence hall in honor of Judge.\nThe Father Mychal Judge Memorial in the village of Keshcarrigan, County Leitrim, Ireland, was dedicated in 2005, on donated land which had belonged to Judge's ancestors. People from the village and surrounding area celebrate his life every year on the 9/11 anniversary.\nIn 2006, a documentary film, \"Saint of 9/11\", directed by Glenn Holsten, co-produced by Brendan Fay and narrated by Sir Ian McKellen, was released.\nLarry Kirwan, leader of the Irish-American band Black 47, wrote a tribute song entitled \"Mychal\" in honor of Judge that appeared in the band's 2004 album \"New York Town\".\nThe Father Mychal Judge Walk of Remembrance takes place every year in New York on the Sunday before the 9/11 anniversary. It begins with a Mass at St. Francis Church on West 31st Street, then proceeds to the site of Ground Zero, retracing Judge's final journey and praying along the way. Every September 11, there is a Mass in memory of Judge in Boston, attended by many who lost family members on 9/11.\nAt the National September 11 Memorial, Judge is memorialized at the South Pool, on Panel S-18, where other first responders are located.\nIn 2014, Judge was inducted into the Legacy Walk, an outdoor public display which celebrates LGBT history and people.\nIn 2015, a statue was dedicated to Judge at St. Joseph's Park in East Rutherford, New Jersey, across the street from St. Joseph's Parish where he served for several years.\nIn recognition of his heroic actions and his commitment to the dignity of LGBTQ people, Judge was posthumously awarded the Dooley Award by GALA-ND/SMC, an alumni organization of the University of Notre Dame, a prominent American Catholic university.\nIn September 2021, Judge was nominated for sainthood in the Catholic Church.\nA documentary film directed by Brendan Fay that focuses on Judge, \"Remembering Mychal\", premiered on October 26, 2021, in New York City. Featured voices in the film include Malachy McCourt and Pete Hamill.\nCanonization debate.\nSeveral organizations have proposed to the Vatican a possible canonization, to which the Archdiocese of New York and the Franciscan Third Order have not given clear answers. However, Christian denominations that are not in communion with Rome have canonized him, recognizing him as a saint and a martyr while his tomb, in the Holy Sepulchre Cemetery of Totowa, has been becoming a kind of \"informal sanctuary\". \nWhile there is an active campaign to open his cause of beatification (the first step to canonization), there remains a controversy over his illicit sexual activity (despite his vow of chastity) and his disobedience towards Church hierarchy regarding certain circumstances which has represented a serious obstacle to his being named a saint.\nThe fact that Judge had a homosexual orientation is likely to be an impediment to beatification. Postulators have argued that there are precedents of saints and openly LGBT martyrs. In 2021, 20 years after his death, an official cause was initiated, but without the official support of the Archdiocese of New York, but from an independent postulator, the Rv. Luis Fernando Escalante, directly in charge of the cause in Rome.\nReferences.\nInline citations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Meade Falkner\nMoonfleet is an 1898 adventure and historical novel written by English writer J. Meade Falkner. The plot is an adventure tale of smuggling, treasure, and shipwreck set in 18th-century England.\nPlot summary.\nIn 1757 Moonfleet is a small village along the coast of southern England. The village takes its name from a formerly prominent local family, the Mohunes. The main character is John Trenchard, an orphan who lives with his aunt, Miss Jane Arnold. The village church includes the sexton, Mr. Ratsey, and Parson Glennie, who also teaches in the village school. Elzevir Block is the landlord of the \"Mohune Arms\". The inn is nicknamed the \"Why Not?\", a pun on the Mohune coat of arms, which includes a \"cross-pall\" in the shape of the letter \"Y\". Mr. Maskew is the local magistrate, who has a daughter, Grace. Village legend tells of the notorious Colonel John \"Blackbeard\" Mohune who is buried in the family crypt under the church. He is reputed to have stolen a diamond from King Charles I and hidden it. His ghost is said to wander at night looking for it and the mysterious lights in the churchyard are attributed to his activities.\nAs the main part of the story opens, Block's youthful son, David, has just been killed by Maskew during a raid by the Maskew and other authorities on a smuggling boat. One night a bad storm hits the village and there is a flood. While attending the Sunday service at church, John hears strange sounds from the crypt below. He thinks it is the sound of the coffins of the Mohune family. The next day, he finds Elzevir and Ratsey against the south wall of the church. They claim to be checking for damage from the storm, but John suspects they are searching for Blackbeard's ghost.\nLater John finds a large sinkhole has opened in the ground by a grave. He follows the passage and finds himself in the crypt with coffins on shelves and casks on the floor. He realises his friends are smugglers and this is their hiding place. He has to hide behind a coffin when he hears Ratsey and Elzevir coming. When they leave, they fill in the hole, inadvertently trapping him. John finds a locket in the coffin that he hid behind (it turns out to be that of Blackbeard himself) which holds a piece of paper with verses from the Bible. John eventually passes out after drinking too much of the wine while trying to quench his thirst, having not eaten or drunk for over 24 hours. Later he wakes up in the \"Why Not?\" inn \u2013 he has been rescued by Elzevir and Ratsey. When he is better, he returns to his aunt's house, but she, suspecting him of drunken behaviour, throws him out. Elzevir takes him in.\nWhen Block's lease on the \"Why Not?\" comes up for renewal, Maskew bids against him in the auction and wins. Block must leave the inn and Moonfleet but plans one last smuggling venture. John feels honour-bound to go with him, and visits Grace Maskew, whom he loves and has been seeing in secret, to say goodbye; his aunt gives him his mother's prayer book \u2014 her last hope to influence John towards piety. The excisemen and Maskew are aware of the planned smuggling run but do not know exactly where it will occur. During the landing Maskew appears and is caught by the smugglers. Elzevir is bent on vengeance for his son by killing Maskew, and while the rest land the cargo and leave, he and John keep watch over Maskew. Just as Block prepares to shoot Maskew the excisemen attack. They wound John and unintentionally kill Maskew. Block carries John away to safety and they hide in some old quarries. While there, John inadvertently finds out that the verses from Blackbeard's locket contain a code that will reveal the location of his famous diamond.\nOnce John's wound heals, he and Block decide to recover the diamond from Carisbrooke Castle. After a suspenseful scene in the well where the jewel is hidden, they succeed in escaping to Holland where they try to sell it to a diamond merchant named Krispijn Aldobrand. The merchant cheats them, claiming the diamond is fake. Elzevir falls for the deceit and angrily throws the diamond out of the window. John, however, knows they have been duped, and suggests they try to recover the diamond through burglary. The attempt fails and they are arrested and sentenced to prison. John curses the merchant for his lies.\nJohn and Elzevir go to prison for life. Eventually they are separated. Then, unexpectedly, ten years later, their paths cross again. They are being transported, and board a ship. A storm blows up, and by a strong coincidence, the ship is wrecked upon Moonfleet beach. While trying to reach the beach Elzevir helps John to safety, but is himself dragged under by the surf and drowned.\nJohn arrives where he originally started, in the \"Why Not?\", and is reunited with Ratsey. He is also reunited with Grace. She is now a rich young lady, having inherited her father's money. However, she is still in love with John. John tells her about the diamond and his life in prison. He regrets having lost everything, but she says, rich or not, she loves him.\nThen Parson Glennie visits and reveals he had received a letter from Aldobrand. The merchant, suffering a guilty conscience and in an attempt to make amends, had bequeathed the worth of the diamond to John.\nJohn gives the money to the village, and new almshouses are built, and the school and the church renovated. John marries Grace and becomes Lord of the Manor and Justice of the Peace. They have three children, including their first-born son, Elzevir. The children grow up, the sons going away to \"serve King George on sea and land\" while their daughter too, it seems, has married away. But John and Grace themselves do not leave their beloved Moonfleet ever again.\nBackgammon.\nOne feature of the narrative is a continuing reference to the boardgame of backgammon which is played by the patrons of the \"Why Not?\" on an antique board which bears a Latin inscription \"Ita in vita ut in lusu aleae pessima jactura arte corrigenda est\" (translated in the book as \"As in life, so in a game of hazard, skill will make something of the worst of throws\").\nLiterary significance.\n\"Moonfleet\" is considered to be a classic work of fiction, and continues to be published in series such as Dover Children's Evergreen Classics. \nIts popularity among children worldwide continued up until at least the 1970s, primarily as a result of its adventure themes relating to pirates, treasure, and smuggling, and due to its suspenseful story-line. It has frequently been studied in schools, and used as required reading for some English courses. It is often compared with similar novels like Stevenson's \"Treasure Island\".\nGeography of the book.\nFalkner uses the local geography of Dorset and the Isle of Wight in the book, only changing some of the place names. The village of \"Moonfleet\" is based on East Fleet in Dorset by Chesil Beach. The headland in the book called \"The Snout\" is Portland Bill.\nCorfe Castle and Carisbrooke Castle are key plot locations.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "20362", "revid": "892079", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20362", "title": "Merge algorithm", "text": "Algorithm that combines multiple sorted lists into one\nMerge algorithms are a family of algorithms that take multiple sorted lists as input and produce a single list as output, containing all the elements of the inputs lists in sorted order. These algorithms are used as subroutines in various sorting algorithms, most famously merge sort.\nApplication.\nThe merge algorithm plays a critical role in the merge sort algorithm, a comparison-based sorting algorithm. Conceptually, the merge sort algorithm consists of two steps:\nThe merge algorithm is used repeatedly in the merge sort algorithm.\nAn example merge sort is given in the illustration. It starts with an unsorted array of 7 integers. The array is divided into 7 partitions; each partition contains 1 element and is sorted. The sorted partitions are then merged to produce larger, sorted, partitions, until 1 partition, the sorted array, is left.\nMerging two lists.\nMerging two sorted lists into one can be done in linear time and linear or constant space (depending on the data access model). The following pseudocode demonstrates an algorithm that merges input lists (either linked lists or arrays) A and B into a new list C. The function head yields the first element of a list; \"dropping\" an element means removing it from its list, typically by incrementing a pointer or index.\n algorithm merge(A, B) is\n inputs A, B : list\n returns list\n C := new empty list\n while A is not empty and B is not empty do\n if head(A) \u2264 head(B) then\n append head(A) to C\n drop the head of A\n else\n append head(B) to C\n drop the head of B\n \"// By now, either A or B is empty. It remains to empty the other input list.\"\n while A is not empty do\n append head(A) to C\n drop the head of A\n while B is not empty do\n append head(B) to C\n drop the head of B\n return C\nWhen the inputs are linked lists, this algorithm can be implemented to use only a constant amount of working space; the pointers in the lists' nodes can be reused for bookkeeping and for constructing the final merged list.\nIn the merge sort algorithm, this subroutine is typically used to merge two sub-arrays A[lo..mid], A[mid+1..hi] of a single array A. This can be done by copying the sub-arrays into a temporary array, then applying the merge algorithm above. The allocation of a temporary array can be avoided, but at the expense of speed and programming ease. Various in-place merge algorithms have been devised, sometimes sacrificing the linear-time bound to produce an \"O\"(\"n\" log \"n\") algorithm; see for discussion.\nK-way merging.\nk-way merging generalizes binary merging to an arbitrary number k of sorted input lists. Applications of k-way merging arise in various sorting algorithms, including patience sorting and an external sorting algorithm that divides its input into \"k\" \n \u2212 1 blocks that fit in memory, sorts these one by one, then merges these blocks.\nSeveral solutions to this problem exist. A naive solution is to do a loop over the k lists to pick off the minimum element each time, and repeat this loop until all lists are empty:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Framebox/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIn the worst case, this algorithm performs (\"k\"\u22121)(\"n\"\u2212) element comparisons to perform its work if there are a total of n elements in the lists.\nIt can be improved by storing the lists in a priority queue (min-heap) keyed by their first element:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Framebox/styles.css\" /&gt;\n find-min(\"h\").\nSearching for the next smallest element to be output (find-min) and restoring heap order can now be done in \"O\"(log \"k\") time (more specifically, 2\u230alog \"k\"\u230b comparisons), and the full problem can be solved in \"O\"(\"n\" log \"k\") time (approximately 2\"n\"\u230alog \"k\"\u230b comparisons).\nA third algorithm for the problem is a divide and conquer solution that builds on the binary merge algorithm:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Framebox/styles.css\" /&gt;\n 1, output the single input list.\n 2, perform a binary merge.\nWhen the input lists to this algorithm are ordered by length, shortest first, it requires fewer than \"n\"\u2308log \"k\"\u2309 comparisons, i.e., less than half the number used by the heap-based algorithm; in practice, it may be about as fast or slow as the heap-based algorithm.\nParallel merge.\nA parallel version of the binary merge algorithm can serve as a building block of a parallel merge sort. The following pseudocode demonstrates this algorithm in a parallel divide-and-conquer style (adapted from Cormen \"et al.\"). It operates on two sorted arrays A and B and writes the sorted output to array C. The notation A[i...j] denotes the part of A from index i through j, exclusive.\n algorithm merge(A[i...j], B[k...\u2113], C[p...q]) is\n inputs A, B, C : array\n i, j, k, \u2113, p, q : indices\n let m = j - i,\n n = \u2113 - k\n if m &lt; n then\n swap A and B \"// ensure that A is the larger array: i, j still belong to A; k, \u2113 to B\"\n swap m and n\n if m \u2264 0 then\n return \"// base case, nothing to merge\"\n let r = \u230a(i + j)/2\u230b\n let s = binary-search(A[r], B[k...\u2113])\n let t = p + (r - i) + (s - k)\n C[t] = A[r]\n in parallel do\n merge(A[i...r], B[k...s], C[p...t])\n merge(A[r+1...j], B[s...\u2113], C[t+1...q])\nThe algorithm operates by splitting either A or B, whichever is larger, into (nearly) equal halves. It then splits the other array into a part with values smaller than the midpoint of the first, and a part with larger or equal values. (The binary search subroutine returns the index in B where \"A\"[\"r\"] would be, if it were in B; that this always a number between k and \u2113.) Finally, each pair of halves is merged recursively, and since the recursive calls are independent of each other, they can be done in parallel. Hybrid approach, where serial algorithm is used for recursion base case has been shown to perform well in practice \nThe work performed by the algorithm for two arrays holding a total of n elements, i.e., the running time of a serial version of it, is \"O\"(\"n\"). This is optimal since n elements need to be copied into C. To calculate the span of the algorithm, it is necessary to derive a Recurrence relation. Since the two recursive calls of \"merge\" are in parallel, only the costlier of the two calls needs to be considered. In the worst case, the maximum number of elements in one of the recursive calls is at most formula_1 since the array with more elements is perfectly split in half. Adding the formula_2 cost of the Binary Search, we obtain this recurrence as an upper bound:\nformula_3\nThe solution is formula_4, meaning that it takes that much time on an ideal machine with an unbounded number of processors.\nNote: The routine is not stable: if equal items are separated by splitting A and B, they will become interleaved in C; also swapping A and B will destroy the order, if equal items are spread among both input arrays. As a result, when used for sorting, this algorithm produces a sort that is not stable.\nParallel merge of two lists.\nThere are also algorithms that introduce parallelism within a single instance of merging of two sorted lists. These can be used in field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), specialized sorting circuits, as well as in modern processors with single-instruction multiple-data (SIMD) instructions. \nExisting parallel algorithms are based on modifications of the merge part of either the bitonic sorter or odd-even mergesort. In 2018, Saitoh M. et al. introduced MMS for FPGAs, which focused on removing a multi-cycle feedback datapath that prevented efficient pipelining in hardware. Also in 2018, Papaphilippou P. et al. introduced FLiMS that improved the hardware utilization and performance by only requiring formula_5 pipeline stages of \"P/2\" compare-and-swap units to merge with a parallelism of \"P\" elements per FPGA cycle.\nLanguage support.\nSome computer languages provide built-in or library support for merging sorted collections.\nC++.\nThe C++'s Standard Template Library has the function std::merge, which merges two sorted ranges of iterators, and std::inplace_merge, which merges two consecutive sorted ranges \"in-place\". In addition, the std::list (linked list) class has its own merge method which merges another list into itself. The type of the elements merged must support the less-than (&lt;) operator, or it must be provided with a custom comparator.\nC++17 allows for differing execution policies, namely sequential, parallel, and parallel-unsequenced.\nPython.\nPython's standard library (since 2.6) also has a merge function in the heapq module, that takes multiple sorted iterables, and merges them into a single iterator.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "20366", "revid": "1317672403", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20366", "title": "Cuisine of the Midwestern United States", "text": "Regional cuisine of the United States\nThe cuisine of the American Midwest draws its culinary roots most significantly from the cuisines of Central, Northern and Eastern Europe, and Indigenous cuisine of the Americas, and is influenced by regionally and locally grown foodstuffs and cultural diversity.\nEveryday Midwestern home cooking generally showcases simple and hearty dishes that make use of the abundance of locally grown foods. It has been described as \"no-frills homestead and farm food, exemplifying what is called typical American cuisine\". Some Midwesterners bake their own bread and pies and preserve food by canning and freezing it.\nBackground.\nSometimes called \"the breadbasket of America\", the Midwest serves as a center for grain production, particularly wheat, corn, and soybeans.\nBeef and pork processing have long been important Midwestern industries. Chicago and Kansas City served as stockyards and processing centers of the beef trade and Cincinnati, nicknamed \"Porkopolis\", was once the largest pork-producing city in the world. Iowa is the current center of pork production in the U.S.\nEveryday Midwestern home cooking generally showcases simple and hearty dishes that make use of the abundance of locally grown foods. The traditions of canning and freezing summer foods are still practiced in modern times. It's not unheard of for pies and bread to be baked at home.\nHistory.\nOhio was one of the first Midwestern regions settled, mostly by farmers from the Thirteen Colonies, in 1788. Maize was the staple food, eaten at every meal. Ohio was abundant in fish, game, and wild fruits. The settlers learned techniques of making venison jerky from Native Americans. They grew pumpkins, beans, potatoes, and corn, and raised hogs. Apples, wheat, and oats were introduced later.\nSwedes, Norwegians, and Finns began to settle the Midwest in the late 18th century, introducing rich, butter-laden cakes and cookies. In addition to making cheese and butter, German and Swiss dairy farmers raised milk-fed veal and produced a type of white beer called \"weisse bier\". Germans brought dishes like \"Hassenpfeffer\", sauerbraten, Sp\u00e4tzle, Maultasche, Schnitzel, and pumpernickel bread. Lutefisk and other types of pickled and smoked fish were introduced by Scandinavians.\nIn the 19th century, as the frontier advanced westward, recipes had to be adapted based on the availability of ingredients. Danish frikadeller and aebleskivers were served with locally grown chokecherry or blueberry syrup. Custard-style puddings similar to figgy pudding were made with native wild persimmons. A typical Midwestern breakfast might have included meat, eggs, potatoes, fruit preserves, and pie or doughnuts. At harvest time, families ate mostly home-produced foods.\nMore settlers began to arrive in the rural Midwest after the Erie Canal was completed in the 1820s. Rural and urban foodways began to diverge as cash-strapped immigrants became dependent on packaged foods.\nThe expansion of railroads in the 1870s and 1880s allowed fresh citrus fruits to be shipped to the Midwest. At the turn of the century, cruise ships operating along the Great Lakes offered varied dining selections. Seasonal fruits, sirloin steak, and lamb kidney saute with mushrooms were some of the breakfast offerings available in 1913.\nBeginning in the 1930s, fine dining was offered on railroad cars. Some of the dishes found on the menu were cashew chicken, baked filet of Lake Superior whitefish au gratin and the ambiguous dessert called \"floating island\".\nEthnic influences.\nSome European foodways have, by wide acceptance, become part of the local cuisine to a degree that they have shed most cultural associations with specific immigrant groups.\nA Wurst mart, sometimes spelled Wurstmart or Wurst Markt, is a variation on a fish fry found predominantly in German-American communities. Wurst marts are usually held by churches as fundraising events, where people will pay for a buffet of sausages and other side dishes. Common side dishes include mashed potatoes, gravy, and sauerkraut. Wurst Mart comes from the German word \"Wurstmarkt\", meaning sausage market. Wurst marts are found mostly in small rural German-American communities in the Midwest, particularly around St. Louis.\nUrban centers.\nChicago.\nThe local cuisine of Chicago has been shaped by its Greek, Jewish, and Italian communities. Jewish immigrant communities of Eastern European origin ate oatmeal cereal called \"krupnik\", made with milk only when it was available. Workers carried packed lunches of bagels, knish, and herring to work. Today, restaurants in Chicago's Greektown serve typical dishes like gyros and cheese saganaki.\nThroughout the city there are many variations on classic sandwiches like the Chicago-style hot dog or club sandwiches served on bagels or other artisan breads like sourdough or brioche with complex spreads like aioli and piri piri sauce. The iconic Italian beef sandwich, made with slow-cooked tough cuts of beef, originated during the Great Depression.\nItalian-American cuisine continued to flourish in Chicago as American forces returned from World War II with a taste for Italian foods. Pepper- and onion-topped Italian pork sausage sandwiches became widely available, and can still be found at festivals, fairs, and ballparks today. Thin-crust pizza arrived in Chicago with Italian immigrants as early as 1909; according to some, the iconic Chicago deep-dish pizza dates to 1943 when it first appeared on Pizzeria Uno menus. Italians are also known for Chicken Vesuvio, bone-in chicken sauteed with oregano and garlic in white wine sauce and finished in the oven with potatoes.\nChicago's cuisine has also seen notable contributions from its Latin American communities. Steamed tamales made from cornmeal filled with seasoned ground beef have been available in Chicago since the 19th century.\nPuerto Ricans introduced the skirt steak sandwich Jibarito. Now also available with chicken, roast pork, ham, shrimp, and even the vegetarian option tofu, the \"jibarito\" is distinguished from other sandwiches by substituting green plantains for bread.\nChicago's food processing industry is historically significant. Following the Civil War, Chicago made use of railway networks to establish distribution networks, making fresh beef widely available. For the first time American consumers without access to local livestock could purchase fresh beef. In 1903, James L. Kraft founded a wholesale cheese distribution business in Chicago which became Kraft Foods. Miracle Whip was introduced in 1933 at an industry event. The American Licorice Company founded in Chicago in 1914 makes Red Vines and Super Ropes. Brach's company in Chicago started making candy corn in the 1920s. The Dove Bar was invented in Chicago. Cracker Jack was founded by a German immigrant who in 1871 started selling molasses-coated, steam-popped corn out of a candy shop in Chicago's South Side. Chicago meat packer Gustavus F. Swift is credited with commercializing shipping fresh meat in refrigerated railroad cars. By 1892 the number of refrigerated railroad cars in use exceeded 100,000. Vienna Beef became a major producer of hot dogs and by the early 2000s was one of the major suppliers for hot dog carts. Some other Chicago meatpackers are Armour, Oscar Mayer, Hygrade and Swift.\nCincinnati.\nThe Queen City is known for its namesake Cincinnati chili, a Greek-inspired meat sauce (ground beef seasoned with cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, cloves, bay leaf, cumin, and ground chilis), served over spaghetti or hot dogs. Unlike \"chili con carne\", Cincinnati-style chili is almost never eaten by itself and is instead consumed in \"ways\" or on cheese coneys, which are a regional variation on a chili dog.\nThe city has a strong German heritage and a variety of German-oriented restaurants and menu items can be found in the area. Goetta, a meat-and-grain sausage or mush made from pork and oats, is unique to the Greater Cincinnati area and \"every bit as much a Queen City icon\" as Cincinnati chili. It is similar to the traditional porridge-like German peasant food \"stippgrutze\" but incorporates a higher proportion of meat-to-grain and is thicker, forming a sliceable loaf. Slices are typically fried like sausage patties and served for breakfast. More than a million pounds of goetta are served in the Cincinnati area per year.\nIn addition, Cincinnati's Oktoberfest Zinzinnati, an annual food and music celebration held each September, is the second-largest in the world. Taste of Cincinnati, the longest running culinary arts festival in the United States, is held each year on Memorial Day weekend. In 2014, local chefs and food writers organized the inaugural Cincinnati Food &amp; Wine Classic, which drew chefs and artisan food producers from the region.\nThe area was once a national center for pork processing and is often nicknamed Porkopolis, with many references to that heritage in menu-item names and food-event names; pigs are a \"well-loved symbol of the city.\"\nColumbus.\nThe Columbus, Ohio area is the home and birthplace of many well-known fast-food chains, especially those known for hamburgers. Wendy's opened its first store in Columbus in 1969, and is now headquartered in nearby Dublin. America's oldest hamburger chain, White Castle, is based there.\nBesides burgers, Columbus is noted for the German Village, a neighborhood south of downtown where German cuisine such as sausages and kuchen are served.\nIn recent years, local restaurants focused on organic, seasonal, and locally or regionally sourced food have become more prevalent, especially in the Short North area, between downtown and the Ohio State University campus. Numerous Somali restaurants are also found in the city, particularly around Cleveland Avenue.\nColumbus is also the birthplace of the Marzetti Italian Restaurant, opened in 1896. Owner Teresa Marzetti is credited with creation of the beef-and-pasta casserole named after her brother-in-law, Johnny Marzetti. The restaurant's popular salad dressings became the foundation for the T. Marzetti Company, an international specialty foods manufacturer and distributor, headquartered in Columbus.\nCleveland.\nCleveland's many immigrant groups and heavily blue-collar demographic have long played an important role in defining the area's cuisine. Ethnically, Italian foods as well as several Eastern European cuisines, particularly those of Poland and Hungary, have become gastronomical staples in the Greater Cleveland area.\nProminent examples of these include cavatelli, rigatoni, pizza, Chicken paprikash, stuffed cabbage, pierogi, and kielbasa all of which are widely popular in and around the city.\nLocal specialties, such as the pork-based dish City Chicken and the Polish Boy (a loaded sausage sandwich native to Cleveland), are dishes definitive of a cuisine that is based on hearty, inexpensive fare. Commercially, Hector Boiardi (aka Chef Boyardee) started his business in Cleveland's Little Italy.\nIn Italian bakeries around the Cleveland area, a variation of the \"cassata\" cake is widely popular. This local version, commonly called the \"Cleveland-style cassata\", differs from the \"cassata siciliana\" in that it is made with layers of sponge cake, custard, and strawberries, then frosted with whipped cream. The cake is sold at bakeries throughout the Midwest region, including the Cleveland-area Corbo's, Presti's, and LaPuma Bakery (credited with creating the cake back in the 1920s).\nDetroit.\nDetroit specialties include Coney Island hot dogs, found at hundreds of unaffiliated \"Coney Island\" restaurants. Not to be confused with a chili dog, a coney is served with a ground beef sauce, chopped onions, and mustard.\nThe Coney Special has an additional ground beef topping. It is often served with French fries. Food writers Jane and Michael Stern call out Detroit as the only \"place to start\" in pinpointing \"the top Coney Islands in the land.\"\nDetroit also has its own style of pizza called Detroit-style Pizza. It is a rectangular pan pizza with a thick, crisp, chewy crust. It is traditionally topped to the edges with mozzarella or Wisconsin brick cheese, which caramelizes against the high-sided heavyweight rectangular pan.\nPolish food is also prominent in the region, including popular dishes such as pierogi, borscht, and \"p\u0105czki\". Bakeries concentrated in the Polish enclave of Hamtramck, Michigan, within the city, are celebrated for their \"p\u0105czki,\" especially on Fat Tuesday. Detroit is also known for its corned beef sandwiches. Hungarian food is featured in nearby eastern Toledo, Ohio with Tony Packo's Hungarian hot dog, a form of \"kolb\u00e1sz\".\nKansas City.\nKansas City is an important barbecue and meat-processing center with a distinctive barbecue style. The Kansas City metropolitan area has more than 100 barbecue restaurants and proclaims itself to be the \"world's barbecue capital.\"\nThe Kansas City Barbeque Society spreads its influence across the nation through its barbecue-contest standards. Kansas City's barbecue craze can be traced back to Henry Perry, who in the early 1920s started barbecuing in an outdoor pit adjacent to his streetcar barn.\nSt. Louis.\nThe large number of Irish and German immigrants who came to St. Louis beginning in the early 19th century contributed significantly to the shaping of local cuisine by their uses of beef, pork, and chicken, often roasted or grilled, and desserts including rich cakes, stollens, fruit pies, doughnuts, and cookies. A local form of fresh-stick pretzel, called Gus's Pretzels, has been sold singly and by the bagful by street-corner vendors.\nMayfair salad dressing was a mainstay at a St. Louis hotel of the same name, and one of the original recipes from the 1904 St. Louis World's Fair.\nSt. Louis is also known for popularizing the ice cream cone and for inventing gooey butter cake (a rich, soft-centered coffee cake) and frozen custard. Iced tea is also rumored to have been invented at the World's Fair, as well as the hot dog bun.\nA staple of grilling in St. Louis is the pork steak, which is sliced from the shoulder of the pig and often basted with or simmered in barbecue sauce during cooking.\nOther popular grilled items include crispy snoots, cut from the cheeks and nostrils of the pig; bratwurst; and Italian sausage, often referred to as \"sah-zittsa,\" a localization of its Italian name, \"salsiccia\". Maull's is a popular brand of barbecue sauce in the St. Louis area.\nRestaurants on The Hill reflect the lasting influence of the early 20th-century Milanese and Sicilian immigrant community. Two unique Italian-American style dishes include \"toasted\" ravioli, which is breaded and fried, and St. Louis-style pizza, which has a crisp, thin crust and is usually made with Provel cheese instead of traditional mozzarella.\nA poor boy sandwich is the traditional name in St. Louis for a submarine sandwich. A St. Paul sandwich is a St. Louis sandwich, available in Chinese-American restaurants. A slinger is a diner and late-night specialty consisting of eggs, hash browns, and hamburger, topped with chili, cheese, and onion.\nMilwaukee.\nTraditional cuisine in Wisconsin was influenced by the European immigration there, so much, that it could be considered the \"most European in the United States\". Foods frequently considered comfort foods, and foods signature to Wisconsin culture in Milwaukee include cheese dishes, butter burgers, beer, Bloody Marys, beer soup, cheese curds, fish fry, and bratwursts. There is a sizeable amount of farms spread across Wisconsin for dairy, corn, and meat production.\nTwin Cities of Minnesota.\nOnce known as \"Mill City\", homemade breads and pies feature prominently in Minneapolis cuisine. Bread and cakes available at the Eagle Bakery in 1850 included fruitcake, pound cake and something called \"Fancy cake\" for the holidays. In the 1930s, there were four Jewish bakeries within a few blocks of each other baking bagels and other fresh breads. Jewish families purchased \"challah\" loaves for their Sabbath meal at the North Side Bakery. There were two kosher meat markets and four Jewish delicatessens, one of which began distribution for what would become Sara Lee frozen cheesecakes. The delis sold sandwiches like corned beef and salami.\nMinneapolis is more racially and ethnically diverse than the rest of Minnesota. For the diverse ethnic groups that call Minneapolis home, retaining their distinct ethnic culture remains a goal that is supported by ethnic-oriented community organizations. Celebrating ethnic holidays and get togethers by preparing traditional foods remains a major symbol of cultural retention. It is a way people share their heritage and culture with outsiders. There are a plethora of restaurants serving ethnic cuisines.\nToday, there are many restaurants serving various Polish dishes like polish sausage, pierogies and stuffed cabbage rolls. and typical German foods like \"rippchen\", \"knackwurst\", and \"wiener schnitzel\". Traditionally, potato salad and kraut were served alongside an entree of bratwurst or ham hocks. A side of \"spaetzle\" and red cabbage would accompany \"sauerbraten\" or \"rouladen\".\nIn the fall, the Twin Cities share along with Green Bay, Wisconsin, the tradition of the neighborhood booyah, a cuisine and cultural event featuring a hodge-podge of ingredients in stews.\nAmerican restaurants in the Twin Cities supply a wide spectrum of choices and styles that range from small diners, sports bars and decades-old supper clubs to high-end steakhouses and eateries that serve new American cuisine using locally grown ingredients. The Jucy Lucy (or \"Juicy Lucy\"), claimed as an innovation of the local pubs, is a hamburger with a core of melted cheese. Barbecue restaurants in the area tend to feature a combination of the various regional styles of this type of cooking.\nMinneapolis and St. Paul also offer a diverse array of cuisines influenced by their many immigrant groups. In the 1970s the Twin Cities saw a large influx of Southeast Asian immigrants from Cambodia, Laos, Thailand and Vietnam. Asian cuisine was initially dominated by Chinese Cantonese immigrants that served Americanized offerings. In 1883 Woo Yee Sing and his younger brother, Woo Du Sing, opened the Canton Cafe in Minneapolis, the first Chinese restaurant in Minnesota. Authentic offerings began at the influential Nankin Cafe which opened in 1919, and many new Chinese immigrants soon took this cuisine throughout the Twin Cities and to the suburbs. The cuisine of Japan has been present since the opening of the area's very first Japanese restaurant, Fuji Ya in 1959. Since 1976 Supenn Supatanskinkasem has been cooking and serving Thai food through her Minnesota State Fair Booth, Siam Caf\u00e9, and Sawatdee chain of Thai restaurants. Modern dining options include \"ph\u1edf\" noodle shops, \"banh mi\" and Thai curry restaurants.\nRestaurants offering other cuisines of Asia including those from Afghanistan, India, Nepal and the Philippines are also recent additions to the Twin Cities dining scene. Local ingredients are often integrated into Asian offerings, for example Chinese steamed walleye and Nepalese curried bison.\nMexican and Tex-Mex restaurants serve \"tacos\", \"tortas\", \"tamales\" and other similar dishes.

The lowest rung were called \"river rats\", similar to folks who lived along the Illinois River foraging for clams and mussels, mostly German, Irish, English and Appalachian. During winter months when fish, clams and mussels were inaccessible the \"river people\", or alternately \"shantyboat dwellers\" hunted possums, beaver or raccoons. Lower-income families consumed less milk, meat and eggs in general. Whole milk was usually not available outside wealthy families, but children were sometimes given skimmed milk.\nBeans, pork, and potatoes were dietary staples in Southern Illinois.

Dinner options consisted of boiled or fried potatoes, green beans cooked in fat, boiled pork, fried fat pork, sliced tomatoes, lettuce wilted with vinegar, macaroni with tomatoes, pie and cake.\nGerman settlers arriving in the 19th century brought foods like wienerschnitzel, sauerbraten, potato pancakes, rouladen, bratwurst, liverwurst, hasenpfeffer, liver dumplings, cakes like Black Forest cake, Lebkuchen and Schnecken, strudel and cookie recipes like Sandbakelse and Pfeffern\u00fcsse.\nBy 1890, fish from the Illinois river were being sent upstream to Chicago for sale in commercial markets on the east coast. Carp and buffalo fish were used to make gefilte fish or fried carp in cornmeal batter.\nThe horseshoe sandwich is rarely seen outside Springfield, Illinois. The original version from Springfield was an open-faced sandwich made from a horseshoe-shaped ham steak and two pieces of white toast but it is available with other types of meat like chicken cutlets or hamburger. The sandwich is served with a cheese sauce similar to Welsh rarebit and french fries.\nIndiana.\nIndiana claims shoreline along Lake Michigan so freshwater fish like perch and walleye have a place on local menus. Biscuits and gravy, topped with sausage gravy, can be found at diners throughout the state, sometimes served with eggs on the side, or other breakfast sides like home fries.\nChicken and noodles (or beef and noodles) are served over mashed potatoes. German pubs serve traditional fare like sausages, schnitzels, rouladen, and sauerbraten. Fried brain sandwich is not very common any more but was more widely available in the past. It was first brought to Evansville by German immigrants.\nIndiana produces roughly 25,000 gallons of maple syrup each year, making it a popular condiment for different sweet and savory foods.\nFried biscuits are a specialty of the state, served with cinnamon sugar and spiced apple butter. Deep-fried pork tenderloin and fried bologna sandwiches are popular in Indianapolis and other parts of the state. Turkey and Beef Manhattan dishes originated in Indianapolis and can be found in diners across the state.\nFried chicken is a staple of after-church dinner on Sundays (Indiana's version uses more black pepper than most). A popular dish seen almost exclusively in Indiana is sugar cream pie (also called Hoosier pie) which most likely originated in the state's Amish community. Some say it originated with the Shaker settlements along Indiana's eastern border with Ohio. The simple milk and sugar pie may be related to the Amish Bob Andy pie, Pennsylvania's shoo-fly pie and North Carolina's brown sugar pie. Persimmon pudding made with sweet, wild persimmons is a typical Thanksgiving dish in Indiana.\nIndiana produces more popcorn than any other state except Nebraska.\nA common Breakfast food found throughout Indiana is fried cornmeal mush, a dish consisting of cornmeal which is boiled, then cut into pieces and fried in oil. The dish is normally served with maple syrup or molasses on top.\nIowa.\nWhen French Icarians arrived in the 19th century their simple meals were put together using just a few basics: milk, butter, bacon and corn bread. The Amana Colony settled on the rich soils of Iowa and until the 1930s their meals were provided by communal kitchens supplied by the village orchards, communal gardens, vineyards, bakery, smokehouse and dairy.\nIowa's last communal meal was served in 1932. Traditional recipes from Amana's communal kitchens include radish salad, apple bread, strawberry rhubarb pie, and dumpling soup.\nDanish immigrants brought apple cake and spherical \"\u00e6bleskiver\" pancakes.

They originated in the region in the Ye Olde Tavern restaurant in 1934 before being popularized by Maid-Rite in 1936, which now has franchises in other Midwestern states. The original Maid Rite sandwich from the 1920s is a ground meat sandwich with pickles, ketchup, mustard, and onions. Hot beef sandwich is made with leftover pot roast topped with gravy and mashed potatoes.\nIowa is the leading pork producer in the United States. This is reflected in Iowan cuisine, which includes the pork tenderloin sandwich (or simply \"pork tenderloin\"), consisting of a lean section of boneless pork loin pounded flat, breaded, and deep fried before being served on a seeded hamburger bun with any or all of ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise, and dill pickle slices. It is a popular \"fair food\" at the Iowa State Fair where the meat of a pork tenderloin sandwich is often far larger than the area of the bun. Burgers are made with local beef.\nIowa is the leader in corn production in the United States, also leading in production of eggs and pork. One well-known variety of sweet corn grown in Iowa is the bi-color peaches and cream.\nRhubarb grows well in Iowa and is used for sauces, jams, cakes and pies.

Today there are more than 2600 liquor and 4000 cereal malt beverage licensees in the state.\nMichigan.\nMichigan is a large producer of asparagus, a vegetable crop widespread in spring. Western and northern Michigan are notable in the production of apples, blueberries, and cherries. The Northwestern region of Michigan's Lower Peninsula accounts for approximately 75 percent of the U.S. crop of tart cherries, usually about 250 million pounds (11.3 Gg). A popular dish, Michigan chicken salad, includes cherries and often apples. Fruit salsas are also popular, with cherry salsa being especially prominent.\nMichigan's wine and beer industries are substantial in the region. The Traverse City area is a popular destination to visit wineries and the state makes many varieties of wine, such as Rieslings, ice wines, and fruit wines. Micro-breweries continue to blossom, creating a wide range of unique beers. Grand Rapids was voted Beer City USA 2013 in the Beer City USA poll, with Founders being the largest of Grand Rapids' breweries. Bell's, another large Michigan craft brewery, is located further south in Kalamazoo.\nMichigan is the home of both Post and Kellogg, with Battle Creek being called Cereal City. Vernor's ginger ale and Faygo pop also originate in Michigan. Vernor's ginger ale is often used as a home remedy for an upset stomach. Additionally, two of the three largest pizza companies in the world, Little Caesars and Domino's Pizza, both originate in Michigan.\nConey Islands, a diner originating with Greek immigrants in Detroit, are fairly common throughout the state. A coney is a natural-casing hot dog on a bun, topped with raw onion, mustard, and coney sauce, a type of chili. Cheese may be added as well and variations are found throughout the state, with each city claiming theirs is the best.\nThese diners usually also have gyros served with cucumber or honey-mustard sauce, as well as hamburgers, sandwiches, breakfast, and dinner entrees. Most Coney Islands are open 24 hours and are a popular place to get a late or early coffee.\nIn Polish communities throughout the state, \"p\u0105czki\" can be found every year on Fat Tuesday (Mardi Gras) in a wide assortment of flavors including lemon, blueberry, prune, and custard. Pierogis, goulash, and Polish-style sausage are common specialties in many restaurants.\nFish fries are common on Fridays and during Lent, usually set up buffet-style with items including rolls, potatoes (typically in the form of french fries and mashed), salad, coleslaw, apple sauce, deep-fried fish, and sometimes fried shrimp and baked fish.\nFish is generally popular throughout the state due to the state's location on four of the Great Lakes. Trout, walleye, perch, and catfish are common. Whitefish is a regional specialty usually offered along the coast, with smoked whitefish and whitefish dip being noteworthy.\nCornish immigrant miners introduced the pasty to Michigan's Upper Peninsula (U.P.) as a convenient meal to take to work in the numerous copper, iron, silver, and nickel mines of that region. The pasty is today considered iconic of the U.P.\nFudge is commonly sold in tourist areas, with Mackinac Island being most famous for its fudge, traditionally chocolate, but there is a wide variety of flavors from mint to maple and may include nuts, fruit, or other candy pieces.\nMinnesota.\nMinnesota is known for its church potlucks, where hotdish is often served. Hotdish is any of a variety of casserole dishes, which are popular throughout the United States, although the term \"hotdish\" is used mainly in Minnesota, Wisconsin, North Dakota, and South Dakota. Hotdishes are filling comfort foods that are convenient and easy to make. \"Tater Tot Hotdish\" is a popular dish, and as Minnesota is one of the leading producers of wild rice, wild rice hotdishes are quite popular. Dessert bars are the second of the two essentials for potlucks in Minnesota. Other dishes include glorified rice, German baked apples and cookie salad.\nWalleye, trout, herring, crappie, lutefisk, wild rice, raspberry, blueberry and strawberry are preferred ingredients in modern Minnesotan cuisine. Typical sides include mashed potatoes, pickles, jello salad, locally grown boiled new potatoes seasoned with fresh herbs or horseradish, baked beans, and vegetables like sweet corn on the cob, or buttered peas, carrots and green beans. Preferred to rice or pasta, potatoes are often served alongside buttered rolls and homemade strawberry jam.\nFood selections served at the annual Minnesota State Fair in past years have included watermelon pickles, baked beans, hot dogs, buffalo burgers, deep-fried cheese curds, glazed ham and homemade apple pie New foods for 2019 included fried tacos on a stick, Turkish pizza, stuffed cabbage rolls, feta bites, shrimp and grits fritters, blueberry key lime pie and assorted other dessert selections.\nScandinavian cuisine has had a significant impact on the cuisine of Minnesota. The cafe at the American Swedish Institute serves Swedish dishes like gravlax with dill, potato dumplings and Swedish meatballs with lingonberry jam. Among the state's most iconic dishes are \"lefse\" and \"lutefisk\". Made from stockfish (air-dried whitefish) and soda lye (\"lut\"), the dish was brought to the state by Scandinavian immigrants. \"Lefse\" is a Norwegian flatbread made from flour, potatoes, cream and butter, and in Minnesota it is commonly prepared for Christmas dinner. Scandinavian rice pudding is also served during the holidays.\nIn northern Minnesota, along the North Shore of Lake Superior, commercial fishing has been practiced for generations. Settlers were used to the cold, rugged work as many of these immigrants came directly from the coastal fishing villages of Norway. Ciscoes (also known as lake herring), lake trout, lake whitefish, and rainbow smelt are still commercially fished today. Smoked or sugar-cured trout is prepared from local fish in areas along the North Shore like Duluth. Walleye is the state fish of Minnesota and it is common to find it on restaurant menus. Battered and deep-fried is a popular preparation for walleye, as is grilling. Many restaurants feature walleye on their Friday night fish fry.\nLetters and household accounts of Minnesota residents give details of mid-19th century frontier cuisine. A farmer's wife writes to her cousin about harvest in Rochester, Minnesota \"My hand is so tired perhaps you'll excuse penciling\", explaining she woke before four to skim milk, churn butter and bake \"6 loaves of bread &amp; seven pumpkin pies\". In the 1850s supplies couldn't keep pace with settlement, though steamboats regularly brought in sugar-cured hams, oysters, herring, sardines, alcohol, salt pork and other supplies. In those days a full multi-course meal served for a special occasions would have started with a typical soup followed by a choice of local fish and the so-called \"boiled dishes\" like chicken with egg sauce, ham or corned beef. Entrees were followed by assorted roast meats served with cranberry sauce. Early Minnesotans used cranberries in pies, molded desserts and frozen confections.\nArriving in the 19th century, immigrants from Eastern Europe opened delicatessens, bakeries and restaurants, and introduced dishes like \"varenyky\", \"krakowski\", poppy seed roll, \"kluski\", kolaches and stuffed cabbage rolls to the Midwest. German immigrants brought kohlrabi with them. Slovenian and Croatian immigrants brought the honey-nut bread called \"potica\" to the Iron Range region, which is also known for Cornish pasties. Porketta, a pork roast seasoned with fennel and garlic and served with either sliced or shredded like a pulled pork sandwich was brought to Minnesota and the Iron Range region by Italian immigrants.\nMinnesota's Black Diaspora is the most diverse in the United States, New halal butchers and African restaurants opened in Minneapolis after tens of thousands of African Americans arrived in Minnesota from other cities in the 1990s. The Safari Express is a Somali cuisine fast food spot that serves camel burgers and fries. Halal Hotdogs is a not for profit providing employment and job training to new immigrants.\nMissouri.\nIn Missouri, much of the cuisine is influenced by the environment as well as the heritage of early settlers to the state.\nIn the Ozarks, you will find that country ham, fried chicken, catfish, and frog legs are popular entr\u00e9e choices, commonly served with fried potatoes, baked beans and biscuits. \nSpringfield style cashew chicken is a dish served at most Chinese restaurants in the Ozarks. \nMid-Missouri and Northern Missourians eat a lot of beef (steaks, hamburgers, meatloaf, and roasts) and pork (steak, roasts, chops, and BBQ); sides often include potatoes (baked, mashed, cheesy, fried) and green vegetables (green beans, asparagus, zucchini).\nBarbecue, mainly pork and beef, is popular in both St. Louis and Kansas City, as well as in much of the southern half of the state.\nIn Southern Missouri, sweet tea is commonly available at restaurants, while in Northern Missouri most citizens prefer unsweetened tea. Missourians also love beer and bacon, with many businesses specializing in these Missouri staples.\nSt. Louis features toasted ravioli, St. Louis-style pizza, and gooey butter cake. Kansas City is known for their K.C.-style BBQ-sauced burnt ends.\nAnother region; the Missouri Rhineland, located along the valley of the Missouri River, is known for its wineries. Missourians love their regional wines and often eat summer sausage, cheese, and crackers while enjoying.\nFishing is popular throughout the state, and fish fries are regular social events. They often feature catfish, largemouth bass, and crappie. Fried potatoes, morel mushrooms (when in season), and onion rings are commonly fried as well at these social gatherings.\nFor breakfast, Missourians enjoy bacon, country ham, breakfast sausage with eggs, hash browns, and toast or biscuits. Biscuits and gravy, pancakes, and breakfast casseroles are also some favorites.\nNebraska.\nA significant population of Germans from Russia settled in Nebraska, leading to one of the state's most iconic dishes, the Runza sandwich.\nLarge numbers of Czech immigrants, especially in southeastern Nebraska, influenced the culture and cuisine of the area. Wilber, Nebraska is the self-designated Czech Capital of the US and celebrates an annual Czech Days festival at which Czech food, such as kolaches, roast duck, and pork and dumplings, is served.\nIn 2015, Nebraska resettled the largest number of refugees per capita in the United States, and Lincoln, Nebraska has been a significant resettlement location for refugees since the 1980s, particularly Vietnamese-Americans.\nA large Vietnamese-American population in Lincoln has created Vietnamese markets\u2014which sell ingredients, such as fresh persimmon, not typically found in Midwestern grocery store chains\u2014and Vietnamese restaurants which sell foods such as \"pho\" and \"b\u00e1nh m\u00ec.\"\nNebraska is also known as the Cornhusker State in reference to the abundance of corn grown in the state. Corn is a common part of late-summer and autumnal meals in Nebraska in dishes such as corn souffle, corn chowder, cornbread, and corn on the cob. Early pioneers relied heavily on corn and cornmeal in everything from breads, (cornbread, corn mush rolls), to soups, (corn soup, Indian meal mush), and desserts, (green corn pudding, popcorn pudding, sweet corn cake).\nThe cheese frenchee, a deep-fried cheese sandwich, was invented in Lincoln, Nebraska at a King's Food Host Restaurant in the 1950s. It went on to become a regional favorite.\nNorth Dakota.\nCuisine in North Dakota has been heavily influenced by both Norwegians and Germans from Russia, ethnic groups that have historically accounted for a large portion of North Dakota's population. Norwegian contributions to the state include lefse, lutefisk, krumkake, and rosettes.\nMuch of the Norwegian-influenced cuisine is also common in Minnesota and other states where Norwegians and their descendants lived, although it may be the greater in North Dakota than any other state.\nNorwegians played a large role in settling the area, and nearly one-third of North Dakotans claim Norwegian ancestry. Norwegian ancestry was historically more widespread throughout the northern half and eastern third of North Dakota, and therefore plays a stronger role in local cuisine in those parts of the state.\nGerman-Russian cuisine is primarily influenced by that of the \"Schwarzmeerdeutsche\", or Black Sea Germans, who heavily populated south-central and southwestern North Dakota (an area known as the German-Russian Triangle), as well as areas of South Dakota.\nWhile large numbers of \"Wolgadeutsche\", Germans from Russia who lived near the Volga River in Russia (several hundred miles away from the Black Sea), also settled in the United States, they did not settle in large numbers in the Dakotas.\nPopular German-Russian cuisine includes \"kuchen\", a thin, cheesecake-like custard pastry often filled with fruit such as cherries, apricot, prunes, and sometimes cottage cheese.\n\"Fleischkuekle\" (or \"fleischkuechle\") is a popular meat-filled thin flatbread that is deep-fried and served hot. Another German-Russian specialty in the area is \"knoephla\", a dumpling soup that almost always includes potatoes, and to a lesser extent, celery.\nOhio.\nBuckeye candy is a confection popular in the state of Ohio; it is the local variation of a peanut butter cup. Coated in chocolate, with a partially exposed center of peanut butter fudge, in appearance the candy resembles the chestnut that grows on the state tree, commonly known as the Buckeye.\nCincinnati-style chili is a Greek-inspired meat sauce, (ground beef seasoned with cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, cloves, bay leaf, cumin, chili powder, and in some home recipes, chocolate), used as a topping for spaghetti or hot dogs. Additionally, red beans, chopped onions, and shredded cheese are offered as extra toppings referred to as \"ways.\"\nGoetta is a German-inspired meat-and-grain sausage that is mainly popular in Cincinnati. It is primarily composed of ground meat, steel-cut oats, and spices. There is an annual Goetta Festival held in Newport, Kentucky.\nA local specialty of Ohio are sauerkraut balls, meatball-sized fritter containing sauerkraut and some combination of ham, bacon, and pork. The recipe was invented in the late 1950s by two brothers, Max and Roman Gruber for their five-star restaurant, Gruber's, located in Shaker Heights, Ohio. These were a derivative of the various ethnic cultures of Northeast Ohio, which includes Akron and Greater Cleveland.\nAn annual Sauerkraut Festival is held in Waynesville, Ohio. at which sauerkraut balls, along with other sauerkraut specialities, are served.\nClam bakes are very popular in Northeast Ohio. The region, which was originally part of the Connecticut Western Reserve, was initially settled by people from Connecticut and other New England states. A typical Northeast Ohio clam bake typically includes clams, chicken, sweet potatoes, corn, and other side dishes. Unlike in New England, seaweed is not used and the clams, chicken, and sweet potatoes are all steamed together in a large pot.\nBarberton, Ohio, part of the greater Akron area, is a small industrial city and home of Barberton Chicken, a dish of chicken deep fried in lard that was created by Serbian immigrants. It is usually accompanied by a hot rice dish, vinegar coleslaw and french fries.\nSouth Dakota.\nOne of the most notable dishes being Rocky Mountain oysters, a dish made from bull testicles. Another dish is known as bierock, which is similar to meat-pie dishes of Central and Eastern Europe. Though treated as a novelty, Fried chicken gizzards can be found served at some restaurants.\nMuch of South Dakotan cuisine mirrors the influence of European immigrants, especially of Norwegian and German cultures, like those of nearby states. It is estimated that at least 40% of South Dakotans have German Ancestry, and at least 15% Norwegian. In particular, the towns East River represent stronger cultural ties to German and Norwegian immigrants. Additionally, South Dakota has a high proportion of some immigrant Anabaptist groups, notably Mennonites and Hutterites, which contribute to the cuisine.\nThe official State dessert of South Dakota is Kuchen, which has its origins as a class of German cake- and pie-like desserts. The typical South Dakota Kuchen has a custard base and usually contains fruit like peaches or berries. \nSome communities and families in South Dakota, will celebrate their German heritage (especially Germans from Russia) with a schmeckfest (lit. \u201ctasting-festival\u201d). One annual schmeckfest which has become famous is in the town of Freeman, South Dakota, which draws over 5,000 visitors. Among families of Norwegian descent, foods like Lefse, lutefisk and Krumkake are popular around Christmastime, as they are in North Dakota and Minnesota.\nAnother significant cultural heritage in South Dakota is the Sioux, especially in the Western part of the state, and some traditional Native American dishes have become popular, like \"wojapi\", a berry sauce from the Lakota. Wojapi sometimes accompanies Frybread, which is associated with another dish called Navajo or Indian tacos, which is frybread topped with meat such as ground beef and other taco toppings. Other foods local to the state which have provided food to tribes for thousands of years include bison, now popularly served as burgers in towns like Custer and Oacoma, and chokecherries, which grow wild both on the plains and in the Black Hills and are used to make jellies and wine. \nHunting provides food for numerous families in the state. The State bird, the Chinese Ring-Necked Pheasant, is the only state bird in the USA which is hunted, and pheasant meat is popular across South Dakota. The town of Aberdeen, in the North-East part of the state, is famous for Pheasant meat sandwiches. It is also common to find South Dakotans dining on venison, pronghorn, or various freshwater fishes local to the state, such as Walleye and Northern Pike.\nWisconsin.\nWisconsin is \"America's Dairyland,\" and is home to numerous frozen custard stands, particularly around Milwaukee and along the Lake Michigan corridor. The state also has a special relationship with Blue Moon ice cream, being one of the only places the flavor can be found. While the flavor's origins are not well documented, it was most likely developed by flavor chemist Bill \"Doc\" Sidon of Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The state is also well known as a home to many cheesemakers. Colby cheese was created here in 1885.\nArguably the most universal Wisconsin dessert would be the cream puff, a type of profiterole that is a famous treat at the Wisconsin State Fair. The southeastern Wisconsin city of Racine is known for its Danish kringle, a sweet flaky pastry often served as a dessert.\nThe Friday night fish fry, often battered and fried perch or walleye, is traditional throughout Wisconsin, while in northeast Wisconsin along Lake Michigan, the Door County fish boil holds sway.\nBesides its \"Cheesehead\" status, Wisconsin has a reputation for alcohol consumption. Common traits of \"drinking culture\" are embedded in Wisconsin traditions, from festivals and holidays to everyday life. Many large breweries were founded in Wisconsin, largely in Milwaukee, which gained the epithet \"Brew City\" before the turn of the century: Miller, Pabst, Schlitz (all from and originally based in Milwaukee) and Leinenkugel all began as local favorites before entering the national and international markets.\n\"Booyah\" is another common and hearty Wisconsin meal, brought to Wisconsin by Walloon immigrants, and found especially in the Northeast region of the state. The origins of this dish are disputed, but the Wisconsin origin contends that the word is a vernacular Flemish or Walloon Belgian spelling of the French word \"bouillon\", in this context meaning \"broth.\"\nWisconsin cuisine also features a large amount of sausage, or \"wurst\". The state is also a major producer and consumer of summer sausage, as well as the nation's top producer and consumer of brats.\nRestaurants and pubs.\nDark ales have been consumed in America since Colonial times, while light-colored German lager was a mid-19th-century arrival. The beer hall did not become established in the United States until the arrival of German immigrants in the mid-19th century. Taverns were generally seen as rough places with an exclusively male clientele.\nThe beer hall, on the other hand, was in German culture views as a place where working-class families drank and ate together in groups at large tables. It was well-lit and served traditional fare like sausages, \"sauerbraten\", \"rollmops\", sauerkraut and pickled herring. Beer halls continued in the Midwest after Prohibition. German potato salad and the potato dumplings commonly served in local pubs in present times.\nThe origin of \"fast food\" is uncertain, but one possibility is a hamburger stand that was founded by Walter Anderson in Wichita, Kansas. Known today as White Castle, the fast-food chain began to spread throughout the Midwest, offering a simple menu with hamburgers, Coca-Cola and coffee. By the 1920s White Castle had become a nationally recognized chain, and until the 1940s White Castle-style architecture was standard for fast-food hamburger outlets throughout the United States. Other local burger chains include Winstead's, Max &amp; Erma's and Schoop's Hamburgers.\nCities like New York did not want fast food to compete with local establishments, but the expansion of suburbs in the 1950s allowed fast-food franchises to grow into areas that lacked restaurants. The popularity of Midwestern fast food like the iconic pizza and burgers started as a rejection of the drive-in model. \"Car hops\" were replaced by the franchise model, including McDonald's, Wendy's, Domino's and Pizza Hut. (McDonald's was originally founded in California in 1940, but purchased by Ray Kroc and moved to Des Plaines, Illinois in 1955.) The growth of these franchises was bolstered by the development of interstate roads through the Midwest.\nSeveral restaurant chains have roots in the Minneapolis-St.Paul area, including Famous Dave's, the now defunct Chi-Chi's, and Buca di Beppo, which was started out of a small Minneapolis basement in 1993. Portillo's Restaurants is another Midwestern fast-food chain known for its hot dogs. Lion's Choice is best known for its roast beef sandwiches. The chain is based mostly in Missouri, with locations in Kansas and Illinois. Wisconsin chain Culver's is known for its frozen custard and root beer. Culver's has been recognized for their use of local dairy products like cheese and butter. Happy Joe's is known for its taco pizza and has restaurants in several Midwestern states. Other notable chains include Harold's Chicken Shack, Skyline Chili, Spangles, Big John Steak &amp; Onion, Graeter's, Maid-Rite and Cousins Subs.\nPizzerias serving deep-dish pizza include Gino's East, Giordano's Pizzeria and Buddy's Pizza, though the latter only has stores in Michigan. Papa John's started by selling pizzas out of a Jeffersonville, Indiana pub.\nDishes.\nIngredients commonly used in the Midwestern states include beef, pork, potatoes and corn. While not all exclusive to the Midwest, these dishes are typical of Midwestern foods, and often feature uniquely Midwestern preparation styles.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "20369", "revid": "24013162", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20369", "title": "Mitosis", "text": "Cell division into two identical cells\nMitosis () is a part of the cell cycle in eukaryotic cells in which replicated chromosomes are separated into two new nuclei. Cell division by mitosis is an equational division which gives rise to genetically identical cells in which the total number of chromosomes is maintained. Mitosis is preceded by the S phase of interphase (during which DNA replication occurs) and is followed by telophase and cytokinesis, which divide the cytoplasm, organelles, and cell membrane of one cell into two new cells containing roughly equal shares of these cellular components. This process ensures that each daughter cell receives an identical set of chromosomes, maintaining genetic stability across cell generations. The different stages of mitosis altogether define the mitotic phase (M phase) of a cell cycle\u2014the division of the mother cell into two daughter cells genetically identical to each other.\nThe process of mitosis is divided into stages corresponding to the completion of one set of activities and the start of the next. These stages are preprophase (specific to plant cells), prophase, prometaphase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase. During mitosis, the chromosomes, which have already duplicated during interphase, condense and attach to spindle fibers that pull one copy of each chromosome to opposite sides of the cell. The result is two genetically identical daughter nuclei. The rest of the cell may then continue to divide by cytokinesis to produce two daughter cells. The different phases of mitosis can be visualized in real time, using live cell imaging.\nAn error in mitosis can result in the production of three or more daughter cells instead of the normal two. This is called tripolar mitosis and multipolar mitosis, respectively. These errors can be the cause of non-viable embryos that fail to implant. Other errors during mitosis can induce mitotic catastrophe, apoptosis (programmed cell death) or cause mutations. Certain types of cancers can arise from such mutations.\nMitosis varies between organisms. For example, animal cells generally undergo an open mitosis, where the nuclear envelope breaks down before the chromosomes separate, whereas fungal cells generally undergo a closed mitosis, where chromosomes divide within an intact cell nucleus. Most animal cells undergo a shape change, known as mitotic cell rounding, to adopt a near spherical morphology at the start of mitosis. Most human cells are produced by mitotic cell division. Important exceptions include the gametes \u2013 sperm and egg cells \u2013 which are produced by meiosis. Prokaryotes, bacteria and archaea which lack a true nucleus, divide by a different process called binary fission.\nDiscovery.\nNumerous descriptions of cell division were made during 18th and 19th centuries, with various degrees of accuracy. In 1835, the German botanist Hugo von Mohl, described cell division in the green algae \"Cladophora glomerata\", stating that multiplication of cells occurs through cell division. In 1838, Matthias Jakob Schleiden affirmed that \"formation of new cells \"in their interior\" was a general rule for cell multiplication in plants\", a view later rejected in favour of Mohl's model, due to contributions of Robert Remak and others.\nIn animal cells, cell division with mitosis was discovered in frog, rabbit, and cat cornea cells in 1873 and described for the first time by the Polish histologist Wac\u0142aw Mayzel in 1875.\nB\u00fctschli, Schneider and Fol might have also claimed the discovery of the process presently known as \"mitosis\". In 1873, the German zoologist Otto B\u00fctschli published data from observations on nematodes. A few years later, he discovered and described mitosis based on those observations.\nThe term \"mitosis\", coined by Walther Flemming in 1882, is derived from the Greek word \u03bc\u03af\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 (\"mitos\", \"warp thread\"). There are some alternative names for the process, e.g., \"karyokinesis\" (nuclear division), a term introduced by Schleicher in 1878, or \"equational division\", proposed by August Weismann in 1887. However, the term \"mitosis\" is also used in a broad sense by some authors to refer to karyokinesis and cytokinesis together. Presently, \"equational division\" is more commonly used to refer to meiosis II, the part of meiosis most like mitosis.\nPhases.\nOverview.\nThe primary result of mitosis and cytokinesis is the transfer of a parent cell's genome into two daughter cells. The genome is composed of a number of chromosomes\u2014complexes of tightly coiled DNA that contain genetic information vital for proper cell function. Because each resultant daughter cell should be genetically identical to the parent cell, the parent cell must make a copy of each chromosome before mitosis. This occurs during the S phase of interphase. Chromosome duplication results in two identical \"sister chromatids\" bound together by cohesin proteins at the \"centromere\".\nWhen mitosis begins, the chromosomes condense and become visible. In some eukaryotes, for example animals, the nuclear envelope, which segregates the DNA from the cytoplasm, disintegrates into small vesicles. The nucleolus, which makes ribosomes in the cell, also disappears. Microtubules project from opposite ends of the cell, attach to the centromeres, and align the chromosomes centrally within the cell. The microtubules then contract to pull the sister chromatids of each chromosome apart. Sister chromatids at this point are called \"daughter chromosomes\". As the cell elongates, corresponding daughter chromosomes are pulled toward opposite ends of the cell and condense maximally in late anaphase. A new nuclear envelope forms around each set of daughter chromosomes, which decondense to form interphase nuclei.\nDuring mitotic progression, typically after the anaphase onset, the cell may undergo cytokinesis. In animal cells, a cell membrane pinches inward between the two developing nuclei to produce two new cells. In plant cells, a cell plate forms between the two nuclei. Cytokinesis does not always occur; coenocytic (a type of multinucleate condition) cells undergo mitosis without cytokinesis.\nInterphase.\nThe interphase is a much longer phase of the cell cycle than the relatively short M phase. During interphase the cell prepares itself for the process of cell division. Interphase is divided into three subphases: G1 (first gap), S (synthesis), and G2 (second gap). During all three parts of interphase, the cell grows by producing proteins and cytoplasmic organelles. However, chromosomes are replicated only during the S phase. Thus, a cell grows (G1), continues to grow as it duplicates its chromosomes (S), grows more and prepares for mitosis (G2), and finally divides (M) before restarting the cycle. All these phases in the cell cycle are highly regulated by cyclins, cyclin-dependent kinases, and other cell cycle proteins. The phases follow one another in strict order and there are cell cycle checkpoints that give the cell cues to proceed or not, from one phase to another. Cells may also temporarily or permanently leave the cell cycle and enter G0 phase to stop dividing. This can occur when cells become overcrowded (density-dependent inhibition) or when they differentiate to carry out specific functions for the organism, as is the case for human heart muscle cells and neurons. Some G0 cells have the ability to re-enter the cell cycle.\nDNA double-strand breaks can be repaired during interphase by two principal processes. The first process, non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), can join the two broken ends of DNA in the G1, S and G2 phases of interphase. The second process, homologous recombinational repair (HRR), is more accurate than NHEJ in repairing double-strand breaks. HRR is active during the S and G2 phases of interphase when DNA replication is either partially accomplished or after it is completed, since HRR requires two adjacent homologs.\nInterphase helps prepare the cell for mitotic division. It dictates whether the mitotic cell division will occur. It carefully stops the cell from proceeding whenever the cell's DNA is damaged or has not completed an important phase. The interphase is very important as it will determine if mitosis completes successfully. It will reduce the amount of damaged cells produced and the production of cancerous cells. A miscalculation by the key Interphase proteins could be crucial as the latter could potentially create cancerous cells.\nMitosis.\nPreprophase (plant cells).\nIn plant cells only, prophase is preceded by a preprophase stage. In highly vacuolated plant cells, the nucleus has to migrate into the center of the cell before mitosis can begin. This is achieved through the formation of a phragmosome, a transverse sheet of cytoplasm that bisects the cell along the future plane of cell division. In addition to phragmosome formation, preprophase is characterized by the formation of a ring of microtubules and actin filaments (called preprophase band) underneath the plasma membrane around the equatorial plane of the future mitotic spindle. This band marks the position where the cell will eventually divide. The cells of higher plants (such as the flowering plants) lack centrioles; instead, microtubules form a spindle on the surface of the nucleus and are then organized into a spindle by the chromosomes themselves, after the nuclear envelope breaks down. The preprophase band disappears during nuclear envelope breakdown and spindle formation in prometaphase.\nProphase.\nDuring prophase, which occurs after G2 interphase, the cell prepares to divide by tightly condensing its chromosomes and initiating mitotic spindle formation. During interphase, the genetic material in the nucleus consists of loosely packed chromatin. At the onset of prophase, chromatin fibers condense into discrete chromosomes that are typically visible at high magnification through a light microscope. In this stage, chromosomes are long, thin, and thread-like. Each chromosome has two chromatids. The two chromatids are joined at the centromere.\nGene transcription ceases during prophase and does not resume until late anaphase to early G1 phase. The nucleolus also disappears during early prophase.\nClose to the nucleus of an animal cell are structures called centrosomes, consisting of a pair of centrioles surrounded by a loose collection of proteins. The centrosome is the coordinating center for the cell's microtubules. A cell inherits a single centrosome at cell division, which is duplicated by the cell before a new round of mitosis begins, giving a pair of centrosomes. The two centrosomes polymerize tubulin to help form a microtubule spindle apparatus. Motor proteins then push the centrosomes along these microtubules to opposite sides of the cell. Although centrosomes help organize microtubule assembly, they are not essential for the formation of the spindle apparatus, since they are absent from plants, and are not absolutely required for animal cell mitosis.\nPrometaphase.\nAt the beginning of prometaphase in animal cells, phosphorylation of nuclear lamins causes the nuclear envelope to disintegrate into small membrane vesicles. As this happens, microtubules invade the nuclear space. This is called \"open mitosis\", and it occurs in some multicellular organisms. Fungi and some protists, such as algae or trichomonads, undergo a variation called \"closed mitosis\" where the spindle forms inside the nucleus, or the microtubules penetrate the intact nuclear envelope.\nIn late prometaphase, \"kinetochore microtubules\" begin to search for and attach to chromosomal kinetochores. A \"kinetochore\" is a proteinaceous microtubule-binding structure that forms on the chromosomal centromere during late prophase. A number of \"polar microtubules\" find and interact with corresponding polar microtubules from the opposite centrosome to form the mitotic spindle. Although the kinetochore structure and function are not fully understood, it is known that it contains some form of molecular motor. When a microtubule connects with the kinetochore, the motor activates, using energy from ATP to \"crawl\" up the tube toward the originating centrosome. This motor activity, coupled with polymerisation and depolymerisation of microtubules, provides the pulling force necessary to later separate the chromosome's two chromatids.\nMetaphase.\nAfter the microtubules have located and attached to the kinetochores in prometaphase, the two centrosomes begin pulling the chromosomes towards opposite ends of the cell. The resulting tension causes the chromosomes to align along the metaphase plate at the equatorial plane, an imaginary line that is centrally located between the two centrosomes (at approximately the midline of the cell). To ensure equitable distribution of chromosomes at the end of mitosis, the \"metaphase checkpoint\" guarantees that kinetochores are properly attached to the mitotic spindle and that the chromosomes are aligned along the metaphase plate. If the cell successfully passes through the metaphase checkpoint, it proceeds to anaphase.\nAnaphase.\nDuring \"anaphase A\", the cohesins that bind sister chromatids together are cleaved, forming two identical daughter chromosomes. Shortening of the kinetochore microtubules pulls the newly formed daughter chromosomes to opposite ends of the cell. During \"anaphase B\", polar microtubules push against each other, causing the cell to elongate. In late anaphase, chromosomes also reach their overall maximal condensation level, to help chromosome segregation and the re-formation of the nucleus. In most animal cells, anaphase A precedes anaphase B, but some vertebrate egg cells demonstrate the opposite order of events.\nTelophase.\nTelophase (from the Greek word \"\u03c4\u03b5\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2\" meaning \"end\") is a reversal of prophase and prometaphase events. At telophase, the polar microtubules continue to lengthen, elongating the cell even more. If the nuclear envelope has broken down, a new nuclear envelope forms using the membrane vesicles of the parent cell's old nuclear envelope. The new envelope forms around each set of separated daughter chromosomes (though the membrane does not enclose the centrosomes) and the nucleolus reappears. Both sets of chromosomes, now surrounded by new nuclear membrane, begin to \"relax\" or decondense. Mitosis is complete. Each daughter nucleus has an identical set of chromosomes. Cell division may or may not occur at this time depending on the organism.\nCytokinesis.\nCytokinesis is not a phase of mitosis, but rather a separate process necessary for completing cell division. In animal cells, a cleavage furrow (pinch) containing a contractile ring, develops where the metaphase plate used to be, pinching off the separated nuclei. In both animal and plant cells, cell division is also driven by vesicles derived from the Golgi apparatus, which move along microtubules to the middle of the cell. In plants, this structure coalesces into a cell plate at the center of the phragmoplast and develops into a cell wall, separating the two nuclei. The phragmoplast is a microtubule structure typical for higher plants, whereas some green algae use a phycoplast microtubule array during cytokinesis. Each daughter cell has a complete copy of the genome of its parent cell. The end of cytokinesis marks the end of the M-phase.\nThere are many cells where mitosis and cytokinesis occur separately, forming single cells with multiple nuclei. The most notable occurrence of this is among the fungi, slime molds, and coenocytic algae, but the phenomenon is found in various other organisms. Even in animals, cytokinesis and mitosis may occur independently, for instance during certain stages of fruit fly embryonic development.\nFunction.\nThe function or significance of mitosis, is the maintenance of the chromosomal set; each formed cell receives chromosomes that are alike in composition and equal in number to the chromosomes of the parent cell.\nMitosis occurs in the following circumstances:\nVariations.\nForms of mitosis.\nThe mitosis process in the cells of eukaryotic organisms follows a similar pattern, but with variations in three main details. \"Closed\" and \"open\" mitosis can be distinguished on the basis of nuclear envelope remaining intact or breaking down. An intermediate form with partial degradation of the nuclear envelope is called \"semiopen\" mitosis. With respect to the symmetry of the spindle apparatus during metaphase, an approximately axially symmetric (centered) shape is called \"orthomitosis\", distinguished from the eccentric spindles of \"pleuromitosis\", in which mitotic apparatus has bilateral symmetry. Finally, a third criterion is the location of the central spindle in case of closed pleuromitosis: \"extranuclear\" (spindle located in the cytoplasm) or \"intranuclear\" (in the nucleus).\nNuclear division takes place only in cells of organisms of the eukaryotic domain, as bacteria and archaea have no nucleus. Bacteria and archaea undergo a different type of division. Within each of the eukaryotic supergroups, mitosis of the open form can be found, as well as closed mitosis, except for unicellular Excavata, which show exclusively closed mitosis. Following, the occurrence of the forms of mitosis in eukaryotes:\nErrors and other variations.\nErrors can occur during mitosis, especially during early embryonic development in humans. During each step of mitosis, there are normally checkpoints as well that control the normal outcome of mitosis. But, occasionally to almost rarely, mistakes will happen. Mitotic errors can create aneuploid cells that have too few or too many of one or more chromosomes, a condition associated with cancer. Early human embryos, cancer cells, infected or intoxicated cells can also suffer from pathological division into three or more daughter cells (tripolar or multipolar mitosis), resulting in severe errors in their chromosomal complements.\nIn \"nondisjunction\", sister chromatids fail to separate during anaphase. One daughter cell receives both sister chromatids from the nondisjoining chromosome and the other cell receives none. As a result, the former cell gets three copies of the chromosome, a condition known as \"trisomy\", and the latter will have only one copy, a condition known as \"monosomy\". On occasion, when cells experience nondisjunction, they fail to complete cytokinesis and retain both nuclei in one cell, resulting in binucleated cells.\n\"Anaphase lag\" occurs when the movement of one chromatid is impeded during anaphase. This may be caused by a failure of the mitotic spindle to properly attach to the chromosome. The lagging chromatid is excluded from both nuclei and is lost. Therefore, one of the daughter cells will be monosomic for that chromosome.\n\"Endoreduplication\" (or endoreplication) occurs when chromosomes duplicate but the cell does not subsequently divide. This results in polyploid cells or, if the chromosomes duplicates repeatedly, polytene chromosomes. Endoreduplication is found in many species and appears to be a normal part of development. Endomitosis is a variant of endoreduplication in which cells replicate their chromosomes during S phase and enter, but prematurely terminate, mitosis. Instead of being divided into two new daughter nuclei, the replicated chromosomes are retained within the original nucleus. The cells then re-enter G1 and S phase and replicate their chromosomes again. This may occur multiple times, increasing the chromosome number with each round of replication and endomitosis. Platelet-producing megakaryocytes go through endomitosis during cell differentiation.\n\"Amitosis\" in ciliates and in animal placental tissues results in a random distribution of parental alleles.\n\"Karyokinesis without cytokinesis\" originates multinucleated cells called coenocytes.\nDiagnostic marker.\nIn histopathology, the mitosis rate (mitotic count or mitotic index) is an important parameter in various types of tissue samples, for diagnosis as well as to further specify the aggressiveness of tumors. For example, there is routinely a quantification of mitotic count in breast cancer classification. The mitoses must be counted in an area of the highest mitotic activity. Visually identifying these areas, is difficult in tumors with very high mitotic activity. Also, the detection of atypical forms of mitosis can be used both as a diagnostic and prognostic marker. For example, \"lag-type mitosis\" (non-attached condensed chromatin in the area of the mitotic figure) indicates high risk human papillomavirus infection-related cervical cancer. In order to improve the reproducibility and accuracy of the mitotic count, automated image analysis using deep learning-based algorithms have been proposed. However, further research is needed before those algorithms can be used to routine diagnostics. \nRelated cell processes.\nCell rounding.\nIn animal tissue, most cells round up to a near-spherical shape during mitosis. In epithelia and epidermis, an efficient rounding process is correlated with proper mitotic spindle alignment and subsequent correct positioning of daughter cells. Moreover, researchers have found that if rounding is heavily suppressed it may result in spindle defects, primarily pole splitting and failure to efficiently capture chromosomes. Therefore, mitotic cell rounding is thought to play a protective role in ensuring accurate mitosis.\nRounding forces are driven by reorganization of F-actin and myosin (actomyosin) into a contractile homogeneous cell cortex that 1) rigidifies the cell periphery and 2) facilitates generation of intracellular hydrostatic pressure (up to 10 fold higher than interphase). The generation of intracellular pressure is particularly critical under confinement, such as would be important in a tissue scenario, where outward forces must be produced to round up against surrounding cells and/or the extracellular matrix. Generation of pressure is dependent on formin-mediated F-actin nucleation and Rho kinase (ROCK)-mediated myosin II contraction, both of which are governed upstream by signaling pathways RhoA and ECT2 through the activity of Cdk1. Due to its importance in mitosis, the molecular components and dynamics of the mitotic actomyosin cortex is an area of active research.\nMitotic recombination.\nMitotic cells irradiated with X-rays in the G1 phase of the cell cycle repair recombinogenic DNA damages primarily by recombination between homologous chromosomes. Mitotic cells irradiated in the G2 phase repair such damages preferentially by sister-chromatid recombination. Mutations in genes encoding enzymes employed in recombination cause cells to have increased sensitivity to being killed by a variety of DNA damaging agents. These findings suggest that mitotic recombination is an adaptation for repairing DNA damages including those that are potentially lethal.\nEvolution.\nThere are prokaryotic homologs of all the key molecules of eukaryotic mitosis (e.g., actins, tubulins). Being a universal eukaryotic property, mitosis probably arose at the base of the eukaryotic tree. As mitosis is less complex than meiosis, meiosis may have arisen after mitosis. However, sexual reproduction involving meiosis is also a primitive characteristic of eukaryotes. Thus meiosis and mitosis may both have evolved, in parallel, from ancestral prokaryotic processes.\nWhile in bacterial cell division, after duplication of DNA, two circular chromosomes are attached to a special region of the cell membrane, eukaryotic mitosis is usually characterized by the presence of many linear chromosomes, whose kinetochores attaches to the microtubules of the spindle. In relation to the forms of mitosis, closed intranuclear pleuromitosis seems to be the most primitive type, as it is more similar to bacterial division.\nGallery.\nMitotic cells can be visualized microscopically by staining them with fluorescent antibodies and dyes.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The three main functions of metabolism are the conversion of energy in food into a usable form for cellular processes; the conversion of food to building blocks of macromolecules (biopolymers) such as proteins, lipids, nucleic acids, and some carbohydrates; and the excretion of metabolic wastes. These enzyme-catalyzed reactions allow organisms to grow, reproduce, maintain their structures, and respond to their environments. The word \"metabolism\" can also refer to all chemical reactions that occur in living organisms, including digestion and the transportation of substances into and between different cells. In a broader sense, the set of reactions occurring within the cells is called intermediary (or intermediate) metabolism. \nMetabolic reactions may be categorized as \"catabolic\"\u2014the \"breaking down\" of compounds (for example, of glucose to pyruvate by cellular respiration); or \"anabolic\"\u2014the \"building up\" (biosynthesis) of compounds (such as proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, and nucleic acids). Usually, catabolism releases energy, and anabolism consumes energy.\nThe chemical reactions of metabolism are organized into metabolic pathways, in which one chemical is transformed through a series of steps into another chemical, each step being facilitated by a specific enzyme. Enzymes are crucial to metabolism because they allow organisms to drive desirable reactions that require energy and will not occur by themselves, by coupling them to spontaneous reactions that release energy. Enzymes act as catalysts\u2014they allow a reaction to proceed more rapidly\u2014and they also allow the regulation of the rate of a metabolic reaction, for example in response to changes in the cell's environment or to signals from other cells.\nThe metabolic system of a particular organism determines which substances it will find nutritious and which poisonous. For example, some prokaryotes use hydrogen sulfide (H\u2082S) as a nutrient, yet this gas is poisonous to some animals. Since hydrogen sulfide is a gasotransmitter, certain mammals including humans produce H\u2082S naturally in very small concentrations where it serves vital signaling and regulatory functions. The basal metabolic rate of an organism is the measure of the amount of energy consumed by all of these chemical reactions.\nA striking feature of metabolism is the similarity of the basic metabolic pathways among vastly different species. For example, the set of carboxylic acids that are best known as the intermediates in the citric acid cycle are present in all known organisms, being found in species as diverse as the unicellular bacterium \"Escherichia coli\" (\"E. coli)\" and huge multicellular organisms like elephants. These similarities in metabolic pathways are likely due to their early appearance in evolutionary history, and their retention is likely due to their efficacy. In various diseases, such as type II diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and cancer, normal metabolism is disrupted. The metabolism of cancer cells is also different from the metabolism of normal cells, and these differences can be used to find targets for therapeutic intervention in cancer.\nKey biochemicals.\nMost of the structures that make up animals, plants and microbes are made from four basic classes of molecules: amino acids, carbohydrates, nucleic acid and lipids (often called fats). As these molecules are vital for life, metabolic reactions either focus on making these molecules during the construction of cells and tissues, or on breaking them down and using them to obtain energy, by their digestion. These biochemicals can be joined to make polymers such as DNA and proteins, essential macromolecules of life.\nAmino acids and proteins.\nProteins are made of amino acids arranged in a linear chain joined by peptide bonds. Many proteins are enzymes that catalyze the chemical reactions in metabolism. Other proteins have structural or mechanical functions, such as those that form the cytoskeleton, a system of scaffolding that maintains the cell's shape. Proteins are also important in cell signaling, immune responses, cell adhesion, active transport across membranes, and the cell cycle. Amino acids also contribute to cellular energy metabolism by providing a carbon source for entry into the citric acid cycle (tricarboxylic acid cycle), especially when a primary source of energy, such as glucose, is scarce, or when cells undergo metabolic stress.\nLipids.\nLipids are the most diverse group of biochemicals. Their main structural uses are as part of internal and external biological membranes such as the cell membrane. Their chemical energy can also be used. Lipids contain a long, non-polar hydrocarbon chain with a small polar region containing oxygen. Lipids are usually defined as hydrophobic or amphipathic biological molecules but will dissolve in organic solvents such as ethanol, benzene or chloroform. The fats are a large group of compounds that contain fatty acids and glycerol; a glycerol molecule attached to three fatty acids by ester linkages is called a triacylglyceride. Several variations of the basic structure exist, including backbones such as sphingosine in sphingomyelin, and hydrophilic groups such as phosphate in phospholipids. Steroids such as sterol are another major class of lipids.\nCarbohydrates.\nCarbohydrates are aldehydes or ketones, with many hydroxyl groups attached, that can exist as straight chains or rings. Carbohydrates are the most abundant biological molecules, and fill numerous roles, such as the storage and transport of energy (starch, glycogen) and structural components (cellulose in plants, chitin in animals). The basic carbohydrate units are called monosaccharides and include galactose, fructose, and most importantly glucose. Monosaccharides can be linked together to form polysaccharides in almost limitless ways.\nNucleotides.\nThe two nucleic acids, DNA and RNA, are polymers of nucleotides. Each nucleotide is composed of a phosphate attached to a ribose or deoxyribose sugar group which is attached to a nitrogenous base. Nucleic acids are critical for the storage and use of genetic information, and their interpretation through the processes of transcription and protein biosynthesis. This information is protected by DNA repair mechanisms and propagated through DNA replication. Many viruses have an RNA genome, such as HIV, which uses reverse transcription to create a DNA template from its viral RNA genome. RNA in ribozymes such as spliceosomes and ribosomes is similar to enzymes as it can catalyze chemical reactions. Individual nucleosides are made by attaching a nucleobase to a ribose sugar. These bases are heterocyclic rings containing nitrogen, classified as purines or pyrimidines. Nucleotides also act as coenzymes in metabolic-group-transfer reactions.\nCoenzymes.\nMetabolism involves a vast array of chemical reactions, but most fall under a few basic types of reactions that involve the transfer of functional groups of atoms and their bonds within molecules. This common chemistry allows cells to use a small set of metabolic intermediates to carry chemical groups between different reactions. These group-transfer intermediates are called coenzymes. Each class of group-transfer reactions is carried out by a particular coenzyme, which is the substrate for a set of enzymes that produce it, and a set of enzymes that consume it. These coenzymes are therefore continuously made, consumed and then recycled.\nOne central coenzyme is adenosine triphosphate (ATP) which is the energy currency of cells. This nucleotide is used to transfer chemical energy between different chemical reactions. There is only a small amount of ATP in cells, but as it is continuously regenerated, the human body can use about its own weight in ATP per day. ATP acts as a bridge between catabolism and anabolism. Catabolism breaks down molecules, and anabolism puts them together. Catabolic reactions generate ATP, and anabolic reactions consume it. It also serves as a carrier of phosphate groups in phosphorylation reactions.\nA vitamin is an organic compound needed in small quantities that cannot be made in cells. In human nutrition, most vitamins function as coenzymes after modification; for example, all water-soluble vitamins are phosphorylated or are coupled to nucleotides when they are used in cells. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), a derivative of vitamin B3 (niacin), is an important coenzyme that acts as a hydrogen acceptor. Hundreds of separate types of dehydrogenases remove electrons from their substrates and reduce NAD+ into NADH. This reduced form of the coenzyme is then a substrate for any of the reductases in the cell that need to transfer hydrogen atoms to their substrates. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide exists in two related forms in the cell, NADH and NADPH. The NAD+/NADH form is more important in catabolic reactions, while NADP+/NADPH is used in anabolic reactions.\nMinerals and cofactors.\nInorganic elements play critical roles in metabolism; some are abundant (e.g. sodium and potassium) while others function at minute concentrations. About 99% of a human's body weight is made up of the elements carbon, nitrogen, calcium, sodium, chlorine, potassium, hydrogen, phosphorus, oxygen and sulfur. Organic compounds (proteins, lipids and carbohydrates) contain the majority of the carbon and nitrogen; most of the oxygen and hydrogen is present as water.\nThe abundant inorganic elements act as electrolytes. The most important ions are sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, chloride, phosphate and the organic ion bicarbonate. The maintenance of precise ion gradients across cell membranes maintains osmotic pressure and pH. Ions are also critical for nerve and muscle function, as action potentials in these tissues are produced by the exchange of electrolytes between the extracellular fluid and the cell's fluid, the cytosol. Electrolytes enter and leave cells through proteins in the cell membrane called ion channels. For example, muscle contraction depends upon the movement of calcium, sodium and potassium through ion channels in the cell membrane and T-tubules.\nTransition metals are usually present as trace elements in organisms, with zinc and iron being most abundant of those. Metal cofactors are bound tightly to specific sites in proteins; although enzyme cofactors can be modified during catalysis, they always return to their original state by the end of the reaction catalyzed. Metal micronutrients are taken up into organisms by specific transporters and bind to storage proteins such as ferritin or metallothionein when not in use.\nCatabolism.\nCatabolism is the set of metabolic processes that break down large molecules. These include breaking down and oxidizing food molecules. The purpose of the catabolic reactions is to provide the energy and components needed by anabolic reactions which build molecules. The exact nature of these catabolic reactions differ from organism to organism, and organisms can be classified based on their sources of energy, hydrogen, and carbon (their primary nutritional groups), as shown in the table below. Organic molecules are used as a source of hydrogen atoms or electrons by organotrophs, while lithotrophs use inorganic substrates. Whereas phototrophs convert sunlight to chemical energy, chemotrophs depend on redox reactions that involve the transfer of electrons from reduced donor molecules such as organic molecules, hydrogen, hydrogen sulfide or ferrous ions to oxygen, nitrate or sulfate. In animals, these reactions involve complex organic molecules that are broken down to simpler molecules, such as carbon dioxide and water. Photosynthetic organisms, such as plants and cyanobacteria, use similar electron-transfer reactions to store energy absorbed from sunlight.\nThe most common set of catabolic reactions in animals can be separated into three main stages. In the first stage, large organic molecules, such as proteins, polysaccharides or lipids, are digested into their smaller components outside cells. Next, these smaller molecules are taken up by cells and converted to smaller molecules, usually acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA), which releases some energy. Finally, the acetyl group on acetyl-CoA is oxidized to water and carbon dioxide during the citric acid cycle and electron transport chain, releasing more energy while reducing the coenzyme nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) into NADH.\nDigestion.\nMacromolecules cannot be directly processed by cells. Macromolecules must be broken into smaller units before they can be used in cell metabolism. Different classes of enzymes are used to digest these polymers. These digestive enzymes include proteases that digest proteins into amino acids, as well as glycoside hydrolases that digest polysaccharides into simple sugars known as monosaccharides.\nMicrobes simply secrete digestive enzymes into their surroundings, while animals only secrete these enzymes from specialized cells in their guts, including the stomach, pancreas, and in salivary glands. The amino acids or sugars released by these extracellular enzymes are then pumped into cells by active transport proteins.\nEnergy from organic compounds.\nCarbohydrate catabolism is the breakdown of carbohydrates into smaller units. Carbohydrates are usually taken into cells after they have been digested into monosaccharides such as glucose and fructose. Once inside, the major route of breakdown is glycolysis, in which glucose is converted into pyruvate. This process generates the energy-conveying molecule NADH from NAD+, and generates ATP from ADP for use in powering many processes within the cell. Pyruvate is an intermediate in several metabolic pathways, but the majority is converted to acetyl-CoA and fed into the citric acid cycle, which enables more ATP production by means of oxidative phosphorylation. This oxidation consumes molecular oxygen and releases water and the waste product carbon dioxide. When oxygen is lacking, or when pyruvate is temporarily produced faster than it can be consumed by the citric acid cycle (as in intense muscular exertion), pyruvate is converted to lactate by the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase, a process that also oxidizes NADH back to NAD+ for re-use in further glycolysis, allowing energy production to continue. The lactate is later converted back to pyruvate for ATP production where energy is needed, or back to glucose in the Cori cycle. An alternative route for glucose breakdown is the pentose phosphate pathway, which produces less energy but supports anabolism (biomolecule synthesis). This pathway reduces the coenzyme NADP+ to NADPH and produces pentose compounds such as ribose 5-phosphate for synthesis of many biomolecules such as nucleotides and aromatic amino acids.\nFats are catabolized by hydrolysis to free fatty acids and glycerol. The glycerol enters glycolysis and the fatty acids are broken down by beta oxidation to release acetyl-CoA, which then is fed into the citric acid cycle. Fatty acids release more energy upon oxidation than carbohydrates. Steroids are also broken down by some bacteria in a process similar to beta oxidation, and this breakdown process involves the release of significant amounts of acetyl-CoA, propionyl-CoA, and pyruvate, which can all be used by the cell for energy. \"M. tuberculosis\" can also grow on the lipid cholesterol as a sole source of carbon, and genes involved in the cholesterol-use pathway(s) have been validated as important during various stages of the infection lifecycle of \"M. tuberculosis\".\nAmino acids are either used to synthesize proteins and other biomolecules, or oxidized to urea and carbon dioxide to produce energy. The oxidation pathway starts with the removal of the amino group by a transaminase. The amino group is fed into the urea cycle, leaving a deaminated carbon skeleton in the form of a keto acid. Several of these keto acids are intermediates in the citric acid cycle, for example \u03b1-ketoglutarate formed by deamination of glutamate. The glucogenic amino acids can also be converted into glucose, through gluconeogenesis.\nEnergy transformations.\nOxidative phosphorylation.\nIn oxidative phosphorylation, the electrons removed from organic molecules in areas such as the citric acid cycle are transferred to oxygen and the energy released is used to make ATP. This is done in eukaryotes by a series of proteins in the membranes of mitochondria called the electron transport chain. In prokaryotes, these proteins are found in the cell's inner membrane. These proteins use the energy from reduced molecules like NADH to pump protons across a membrane.\nPumping protons out of the mitochondria creates a proton concentration difference across the membrane and generates an electrochemical gradient. This force drives protons back into the mitochondrion through the base of an enzyme called ATP synthase. The flow of protons makes the stalk subunit rotate, causing the active site of the synthase domain to change shape and phosphorylate adenosine diphosphate\u2014turning it into ATP.\nEnergy from inorganic compounds.\nChemolithotrophy is a type of metabolism found in prokaryotes where energy is obtained from the oxidation of inorganic compounds. These organisms can use hydrogen, reduced sulfur compounds (such as sulfide, hydrogen sulfide and thiosulfate), ferrous iron (Fe(II)) or ammonia as sources of reducing power and they gain energy from the oxidation of these compounds. These microbial processes are important in global biogeochemical cycles such as acetogenesis, nitrification and denitrification and are critical for soil fertility.\nEnergy from light.\nThe energy in sunlight is captured by plants, cyanobacteria, purple bacteria, green sulfur bacteria and some protists. This process is often coupled to the conversion of carbon dioxide into organic compounds, as part of photosynthesis, which is discussed below. The energy capture and carbon fixation systems can, however, operate separately in prokaryotes, as purple bacteria and green sulfur bacteria can use sunlight as a source of energy, while switching between carbon fixation and the fermentation of organic compounds.\nIn many organisms, the capture of solar energy is similar in principle to oxidative phosphorylation, as it involves the storage of energy as a proton concentration gradient. This proton motive force then drives ATP synthesis. The electrons needed to drive this electron transport chain come from light-gathering proteins called photosynthetic reaction centres. Reaction centers are classified into two types depending on the nature of photosynthetic pigment present, with most photosynthetic bacteria only having one type, while plants and cyanobacteria have two.\nIn plants, algae, and cyanobacteria, photosystem II uses light energy to remove electrons from water, releasing oxygen as a waste product. The electrons then flow to the cytochrome b6f complex, which uses their energy to pump protons across the thylakoid membrane in the chloroplast. These protons move back through the membrane as they drive the ATP synthase, as before. The electrons then flow through photosystem I and can then be used to reduce the coenzyme NADP+. This coenzyme can enter the Calvin cycle or be recycled for further ATP generation.\nAnabolism.\nAnabolism is the set of constructive metabolic processes where the energy released by catabolism is used to synthesize complex molecules. In general, the complex molecules that make up cellular structures are constructed step-by-step from smaller and simpler precursors. Anabolism involves three basic stages. First, the production of precursors such as amino acids, monosaccharides, isoprenoids and nucleotides, secondly, their activation into reactive forms using energy from ATP, and thirdly, the assembly of these precursors into complex molecules such as proteins, polysaccharides, lipids and nucleic acids.\nAnabolism in organisms can be different according to the source of constructed molecules in their cells. Autotrophs such as plants can construct the complex organic molecules in their cells such as polysaccharides and proteins from simple molecules like carbon dioxide and water. Heterotrophs, on the other hand, require a source of more complex substances, such as monosaccharides and amino acids, to produce these complex molecules. Organisms can be further classified by ultimate source of their energy: photoautotrophs and photoheterotrophs obtain energy from light, whereas chemoautotrophs and chemoheterotrophs obtain energy from oxidation reactions.\nCarbon fixation.\nPhotosynthesis is the synthesis of carbohydrates from sunlight and carbon dioxide (CO2). In plants, cyanobacteria and algae, oxygenic photosynthesis splits water, with oxygen produced as a waste product. This process uses the ATP and NADPH produced by the photosynthetic reaction centres, as described above, to convert CO2 into glycerate 3-phosphate, which can then be converted into glucose. This carbon-fixation reaction is carried out by the enzyme RuBisCO as part of the Calvin\u2013Benson cycle. Three types of photosynthesis occur in plants, C3 carbon fixation, C4 carbon fixation and CAM photosynthesis. These differ by the route that carbon dioxide takes to the Calvin cycle, with C3 plants fixing CO2 directly, while C4 and CAM photosynthesis incorporate the CO2 into other compounds first, as adaptations to deal with intense sunlight and dry conditions.\nIn photosynthetic prokaryotes the mechanisms of carbon fixation are more diverse. Here, carbon dioxide can be fixed by the Calvin\u2013Benson cycle, a reversed citric acid cycle, or the carboxylation of acetyl-CoA. Prokaryotic chemoautotrophs also fix CO2 through the Calvin\u2013Benson cycle, but use energy from inorganic compounds to drive the reaction.\nCarbohydrates and glycans.\nIn carbohydrate anabolism, simple organic acids can be converted into monosaccharides such as glucose and then used to assemble polysaccharides such as starch. The generation of glucose from compounds like pyruvate, lactate, glycerol, glycerate 3-phosphate and amino acids is called gluconeogenesis. Gluconeogenesis converts pyruvate to glucose-6-phosphate through a series of intermediates, many of which are shared with glycolysis. However, this pathway is not simply glycolysis run in reverse, as several steps are catalyzed by non-glycolytic enzymes. This is important as it allows the formation and breakdown of glucose to be regulated separately, and prevents both pathways from running simultaneously in a futile cycle.\nAlthough fat is a common way of storing energy, in vertebrates such as humans the fatty acids in these stores cannot be converted to glucose through gluconeogenesis as these organisms cannot convert acetyl-CoA into pyruvate; plants do, but animals do not, have the necessary enzymatic machinery. As a result, after long-term starvation, vertebrates need to produce ketone bodies from fatty acids to replace glucose in tissues such as the brain that cannot metabolize fatty acids. In other organisms such as plants and bacteria, this metabolic problem is solved using the glyoxylate cycle, which bypasses the decarboxylation step in the citric acid cycle and allows the transformation of acetyl-CoA to oxaloacetate, where it can be used for the production of glucose. Other than fat, glucose is stored in most tissues, as an energy resource available within the tissue through glycogenesis which was usually being used to maintained glucose level in blood.\nPolysaccharides and glycans are made by the sequential addition of monosaccharides by glycosyltransferase from a reactive sugar-phosphate donor such as uridine diphosphate glucose (UDP-Glc) to an acceptor hydroxyl group on the growing polysaccharide. As any of the hydroxyl groups on the ring of the substrate can be acceptors, the polysaccharides produced can have straight or branched structures. The polysaccharides produced can have structural or metabolic functions themselves, or be transferred to lipids and proteins by the enzymes oligosaccharyltransferases.\nFatty acids, isoprenoids and sterol.\nFatty acids are made by fatty acid synthases that polymerize and then reduce acetyl-CoA units. The acyl chains in the fatty acids are extended by a cycle of reactions that add the acyl group, reduce it to an alcohol, dehydrate it to an alkene group and then reduce it again to an alkane group. The enzymes of fatty acid biosynthesis are divided into two groups: in animals and fungi, all these fatty acid synthase reactions are carried out by a single multifunctional type I protein, while in plant plastids and bacteria separate type II enzymes perform each step in the pathway.\nTerpenes and isoprenoids are a large class of lipids that include the carotenoids and form the largest class of plant natural products. These compounds are made by the assembly and modification of isoprene units donated from the reactive precursors isopentenyl pyrophosphate and dimethylallyl pyrophosphate. These precursors can be made in different ways. In animals and archaea, the mevalonate pathway produces these compounds from acetyl-CoA, while in plants and bacteria the non-mevalonate pathway uses pyruvate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate as substrates. One important reaction that uses these activated isoprene donors is sterol biosynthesis. Here, the isoprene units are joined to make squalene and then folded up and formed into a set of rings to make lanosterol. Lanosterol can then be converted into other sterols such as cholesterol and ergosterol.\nProteins.\nOrganisms vary in their ability to synthesize the 20 common amino acids. Most bacteria and plants can synthesize all twenty, but mammals can only synthesize eleven nonessential amino acids, so nine essential amino acids must be obtained from food. Some simple parasites, such as the bacteria \"Mycoplasma pneumoniae\", lack all amino acid synthesis and take their amino acids directly from their hosts. All amino acids are synthesized from intermediates in glycolysis, the citric acid cycle, or the pentose phosphate pathway. Nitrogen is provided by glutamate and glutamine. Nonessential amino acid synthesis depends on the formation of the appropriate alpha-keto acid, which is then transaminated to form an amino acid.\nAmino acids are made into proteins by being joined in a chain of peptide bonds. Each different protein has a unique sequence of amino acid residues: this is its primary structure. Just as the letters of the alphabet can be combined to form an almost endless variety of words, amino acids can be linked in varying sequences to form a huge variety of proteins. Proteins are made from amino acids that have been activated by attachment to a transfer RNA molecule through an ester bond. This aminoacyl-tRNA precursor is produced in an ATP-dependent reaction carried out by an aminoacyl tRNA synthetase. This aminoacyl-tRNA is then a substrate for the ribosome, which joins the amino acid onto the elongating protein chain, using the sequence information in a messenger RNA.\nNucleotide synthesis and salvage.\nNucleotides are made from amino acids, carbon dioxide and formic acid in pathways that require large amounts of metabolic energy. Consequently, most organisms have efficient systems to salvage preformed nucleotides. Purines are synthesized as nucleosides (bases attached to ribose). Both adenine and guanine are made from the precursor nucleoside inosine monophosphate, which is synthesized using atoms from the amino acids glycine, glutamine, and aspartic acid, as well as formate transferred from the coenzyme tetrahydrofolate. Pyrimidines, on the other hand, are synthesized from the base orotate, which is formed from glutamine and aspartate.\nXenobiotics and redox metabolism.\nAll organisms are constantly exposed to compounds that they cannot use as foods and that would be harmful if they accumulated in cells, as they have no metabolic function. These potentially damaging compounds are called xenobiotics. Xenobiotics such as synthetic drugs, natural poisons and antibiotics are detoxified by a set of xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes. In humans, these include cytochrome P450 oxidases, UDP-glucuronosyltransferases, and glutathione \"S\"-transferases. This system of enzymes acts in three stages to firstly oxidize the xenobiotic (phase I) and then conjugate water-soluble groups onto the molecule (phase II). The modified water-soluble xenobiotic can then be pumped out of cells and in multicellular organisms may be further metabolized before being excreted (phase III). In ecology, these reactions are particularly important in microbial biodegradation of pollutants and the bioremediation of contaminated land and oil spills. Many of these microbial reactions are shared with multicellular organisms, but due to the incredible diversity of types of microbes these organisms are able to deal with a far wider range of xenobiotics than multicellular organisms, and can degrade even persistent organic pollutants such as organochlorines compounds.\nA related problem for aerobic organisms is oxidative stress. Here, processes including oxidative phosphorylation and the formation of disulfide bonds during protein folding produce reactive oxygen species such as hydrogen peroxide. These damaging oxidants are removed by antioxidant metabolites such as glutathione and enzymes such as catalases and peroxidases.\nThermodynamics of living organisms.\nLiving organisms must obey the laws of thermodynamics, which describe the transfer of heat and work. The second law of thermodynamics states that in any isolated system, the amount of entropy (disorder) cannot decrease. Although living organisms' amazing complexity appears to contradict this law, life is possible as all organisms are open systems that exchange matter and energy with their surroundings. Living systems are not in equilibrium, but instead are dissipative systems that maintain their state of high complexity by causing a larger increase in the entropy of their environments. The metabolism of a cell achieves this by coupling the spontaneous processes of catabolism to the non-spontaneous processes of anabolism. In thermodynamic terms, metabolism maintains order by creating disorder.\nRegulation and control.\nAs the environments of most organisms are constantly changing, the reactions of metabolism must be finely regulated to maintain a constant set of conditions within cells, a condition called homeostasis. Metabolic regulation also allows organisms to respond to signals and interact actively with their environments. Two closely linked concepts are important for understanding how metabolic pathways are controlled. Firstly, the \"regulation\" of an enzyme in a pathway is how its activity is increased and decreased in response to signals. Secondly, the \"control\" exerted by this enzyme is the effect that these changes in its activity have on the overall rate of the pathway (the flux through the pathway). For example, an enzyme may show large changes in activity (i.e. it is highly regulated) but if these changes have little effect on the flux of a metabolic pathway, then this enzyme is not involved in the control of the pathway.\nThere are multiple levels of metabolic regulation. In intrinsic regulation, the metabolic pathway self-regulates to respond to changes in the levels of substrates or products; for example, a decrease in the amount of product can increase the flux through the pathway to compensate. This type of regulation often involves allosteric regulation of the activities of multiple enzymes in the pathway. Extrinsic control involves a cell in a multicellular organism changing its metabolism in response to signals from other cells. These signals are usually in the form of water-soluble messengers such as hormones and growth factors and are detected by specific receptors on the cell surface. These signals are then transmitted inside the cell by second messenger systems that often involved the phosphorylation of proteins.\nA very well understood example of extrinsic control is the regulation of glucose metabolism by the hormone insulin. Insulin is produced in response to rises in blood glucose levels. Binding of the hormone to insulin receptors on cells then activates a cascade of protein kinases that cause the cells to take up glucose and convert it into storage molecules such as fatty acids and glycogen. The metabolism of glycogen is controlled by activity of phosphorylase, the enzyme that breaks down glycogen, and glycogen synthase, the enzyme that makes it. These enzymes are regulated in a reciprocal fashion, with phosphorylation inhibiting glycogen synthase, but activating phosphorylase. Insulin causes glycogen synthesis by activating protein phosphatases and producing a decrease in the phosphorylation of these enzymes.\nEvolution.\nThe central pathways of metabolism described above, such as glycolysis and the citric acid cycle, are present in all three domains of living things and were present in the last universal common ancestor. This universal ancestral cell was prokaryotic and probably a methanogen that had extensive amino acid, nucleotide, carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. The retention of these ancient pathways during later evolution may be the result of these reactions having been an optimal solution to their particular metabolic problems, with pathways such as glycolysis and the citric acid cycle producing their end products highly efficiently and in a minimal number of steps. The first pathways of enzyme-based metabolism may have been parts of purine nucleotide metabolism, while previous metabolic pathways were a part of the ancient RNA world.\nMany models have been proposed to describe the mechanisms by which novel metabolic pathways evolve. These include the sequential addition of novel enzymes to a short ancestral pathway, the duplication and then divergence of entire pathways as well as the recruitment of pre-existing enzymes and their assembly into a novel reaction pathway. The relative importance of these mechanisms is unclear, but genomic studies have shown that enzymes in a pathway are likely to have a shared ancestry, suggesting that many pathways have evolved in a step-by-step fashion with novel functions created from pre-existing steps in the pathway. An alternative model comes from studies that trace the evolution of proteins' structures in metabolic networks, this has suggested that enzymes are pervasively recruited, borrowing enzymes to perform similar functions in different metabolic pathways (evident in the MANET database) These recruitment processes result in an evolutionary enzymatic mosaic. A third possibility is that some parts of metabolism might exist as \"modules\" that can be reused in different pathways and perform similar functions on different molecules.\nAs well as the evolution of new metabolic pathways, evolution can also cause the loss of metabolic functions. For example, in some parasites metabolic processes that are not essential for survival are lost and preformed amino acids, nucleotides and carbohydrates may instead be scavenged from the host. Similar reduced metabolic capabilities are seen in endosymbiotic organisms.\nInvestigation and manipulation.\nClassically, metabolism is studied by a reductionist approach that focuses on a single metabolic pathway. Particularly valuable is the use of radioactive tracers at the whole-organism, tissue and cellular levels, which define the paths from precursors to final products by identifying radioactively labelled intermediates and products. The enzymes that catalyze these chemical reactions can then be purified and their kinetics and responses to inhibitors investigated. A parallel approach is to identify the small molecules in a cell or tissue; the complete set of these molecules is called the metabolome. Overall, these studies give a good view of the structure and function of simple metabolic pathways, but are inadequate when applied to more complex systems such as the metabolism of a complete cell.\nAn idea of the complexity of the metabolic networks in cells that contain thousands of different enzymes is given by the figure showing the interactions between just 43 proteins and 40 metabolites to the right: the sequences of genomes provide lists containing anything up to 26.500 genes. However, it is now possible to use this genomic data to reconstruct complete networks of biochemical reactions and produce more holistic mathematical models that may explain and predict their behavior. These models are especially powerful when used to integrate the pathway and metabolite data obtained through classical methods with data on gene expression from proteomic and DNA microarray studies. Using these techniques, a model of human metabolism has now been produced, which will guide future drug discovery and biochemical research. These models are now used in network analysis, to classify human diseases into groups that share common proteins or metabolites.\nBacterial metabolic networks are a striking example of bow-tie organization, an architecture able to input a wide range of nutrients and produce a large variety of products and complex macromolecules using a relatively few intermediate common currencies.\nA major technological application of this information is metabolic engineering. Here, organisms such as yeast, plants or bacteria are genetically modified to make them more useful in red biotechnology and aid the production of drugs such as antibiotics or industrial chemicals such as 1,3-propanediol and shikimic acid. These genetic modifications usually aim to reduce the amount of energy used to produce the product, increase yields and reduce the production of wastes.\nHistory.\nThe term \"metabolism\" is derived from the Ancient Greek word \u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03b2\u03bf\u03bb\u03ae\u2014\"metabole\" for \"a change\" which is derived from \u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03b2\u03ac\u03bb\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd\u2014\"metaballein\", meaning \"to change\"\nGreek philosophy.\nAristotle's \"The Parts of Animals\" sets out enough details of his views on metabolism for an open flow model to be made. He believed that at each stage of the process, materials from food were transformed, with heat being released as the classical element of fire, and residual materials being excreted as urine, bile, or faeces.\nIbn al-Nafis described metabolism in his 1260 AD work titled Al-Risalah al-Kamiliyyah fil Siera al-Nabawiyyah (The Treatise of Kamil on the Prophet's Biography) which included the following phrase \"Both the body and its parts are in a continuous state of dissolution and nourishment, so they are inevitably undergoing permanent change.\"\nApplication of the scientific method.\nThe history of the scientific study of metabolism spans several centuries and has moved from examining whole animals in early studies, to examining individual metabolic reactions in modern biochemistry. The first controlled experiments in human metabolism were published by Santorio Santorio in 1614 in his book \"Ars de statica medicina\". He described how he weighed himself before and after eating, sleep, working, sex, fasting, drinking, and excreting. He found that most of the food he took in was lost through what he called \"insensible perspiration\".\nIn these early studies, the mechanisms of these metabolic processes had not been identified and a vital force was thought to animate living tissue. In the 19th century, when studying the fermentation of sugar to alcohol by yeast, Louis Pasteur concluded that fermentation was catalyzed by substances within the yeast cells he called \"ferments\". He wrote that \"alcoholic fermentation is an act correlated with the life and organization of the yeast cells, not with the death or putrefaction of the cells.\" This discovery, along with the publication by Friedrich W\u00f6hler in 1828 of a paper on the chemical synthesis of urea, and is notable for being the first organic compound prepared from wholly inorganic precursors. W\u00f6hler's urea synthesis showed that organic compounds could be created from inorganic precursors, disputing the vital force theory that dominated early 19th-century science. Modern analyses consider this achievement as foundational for unifying organic and inorganic chemistry.\nIt was the discovery of enzymes at the beginning of the 20th century by Eduard Buchner that separated the study of the chemical reactions of metabolism from the biological study of cells, and marked the beginnings of biochemistry. The mass of biochemical knowledge grew rapidly throughout the early 20th century. One of the most prolific of these modern biochemists was Hans Krebs who made huge contributions to the study of metabolism. He discovered the urea cycle and later, working with Hans Kornberg, the citric acid cycle and the glyoxylate cycle. Modern biochemical research has been greatly aided by the development of new techniques such as chromatography, NMR spectroscopy, electron microscopy and molecular dynamics simulations. These techniques have allowed the discovery and detailed analysis of the many molecules and metabolic pathways in cells.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\nIntroductory\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAdvanced\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\nGeneral information\nHuman metabolism\nDatabases\nMetabolic pathways"}

The Medieval Inquisition was established in response to movements considered apostate or heretical to Roman Catholicism, in particular Catharism and Waldensians in Southern France and Northern Italy. These were the first of many inquisitions that would follow.\nThe Cathars were first noted in the 1140s in Southern France, and the Waldensians around 1170 in Northern Italy. Before this point, individual heretics such as Peter of Bruis had often challenged the Church. However, the Cathars were the first mass organization in the second millennium that posed a serious threat to the authority of the Church. This article covers only these early inquisitions, not the Roman Inquisition of the 16th century onwards, or the somewhat different phenomenon of the Spanish Inquisition of the late 15th century, which was under the control of the Spanish monarchy using local clergy. The Portuguese Inquisition of the 16th century and various colonial branches followed the same pattern.\nBackground.\nThe Roman Emperor Constantine legalized Christianity in 312. Having been severely persecuted under previous emperors, the new religion now felt capable of commencing its program of persecution. From the moment it was recognised and empowered, there were persecutions against the adherents of other cults \u2014 pagans, Jews, and heretics. Though only in the fourth century of its existence, Christianity had spread widely and was already beginning to experience a multiplicity of schisms within itself. Among the most significant of the heresies at this time were Arianism, Manichaeism, Gnosticism, the Adamites, the Donatists, the Pelagians, and Priscillianists.\nThe Edict of Thessalonica issued on 27 February 380 by Emperor Theodosius I established Nicene Christianity as the state church of the Roman Empire. It condemned other Christian creeds as heresies of \"foolish madmen\" and approved their punishment. In 438, under Emperor Theodosius II, the \"Codex Theodosianus\" (Theodosian Code), a compilation of laws of the Roman Empire, already provided for the confiscation of property and the death penalty for heretics. After the Fall of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century, there followed almost seven centuries in which persecutions for heresy became very rare. Some of the old heresies survived, but in a weakened state, and they tended not to operate openly. No new schisms appeared to emerge during this period.\nDefinition and Practice.\nAn inquisition was a process that developed to investigate alleged instances of crimes. Its use in ecclesiastical courts was not at first directed to matters of heresy, but a broad assortment of offenses such as clandestine marriage and bigamy. French historian Jean-Baptiste Guiraud (1866\u20131953) defined Medieval Inquisition as \"... a system of repressive means, some of temporal and some others of spiritual kind, concurrently issued by ecclesiastical and civil authorities in order to protect religious orthodoxy and social order, both threatened by theological and social doctrines of heresy.\"\nBishop of Lincoln, Robert Grosseteste, defined heresy as \"an opinion chosen by human perception, created by human reason, founded on the Scriptures, contrary to the teachings of the Church, publicly avowed, and obstinately defended.\" The fault was in the obstinate adherence rather than theological error, which could be corrected; and by referencing scripture Grosseteste excludes Jews, Muslims, and other non-Christians from the definition of heretic.\nThere were many different types of inquisitions depending on the location and methods; historians have generally classified them into the \"episcopal inquisition\" and the \"papal inquisition\". All major medieval inquisitions were decentralized, and each tribunal worked independently. Authority rested with local officials based on guidelines from the Holy See, but there was no central top-down authority running the inquisitions, as would be the case in post-medieval inquisitions.\nEarly Medieval courts generally followed a process called \"accusatio\", largely based on Germanic practices. In this procedure, an individual would make an accusation against someone to the court. However, if the suspect was judged innocent, the accusers faced legal penalties for bringing false charges. This provided a disincentive to make any accusation unless the accusers were sure it would stand. Later, a threshold requirement was the establishment of the accused's \"publica fama\", i.e., the fact that the person was widely believed to be guilty of the offense charged.\nBy the twelfth and early thirteenth centuries, there was a shift away from the accusatorial model toward the legal procedure used in the Roman Empire. Instead of an individual making accusations based on first-hand knowledge, judges now took on the prosecutorial role based on information collected. Under inquisitorial procedures, guilt or innocence was proved by the inquiry (\"inquisitio\") of the judge into the details of a case.\nEpiscopal inquisitions.\nThe common people tended to view heretics \"...as an antisocial menace. ...Heresy involved not only religious division, but social upset and political strife.\" In 1076 Pope Gregory VII excommunicated the residents of Cambrai because a mob had seized and burned a Cathar determined by the bishop to have been a heretic. A similar occurrence happened in 1114 during the bishops absence in Strassburg. In 1145 clergy at Li\u00e8ge managed to rescue victims from the crowd.\nThe first medieval inquisition, the episcopal inquisition, was established in the year 1184 by a papal bull of Pope Lucius III entitled \"Ad abolendam\", \"For the purpose of doing away with.\" It was a response to the growing Catharist movement in southern France. This inquisition was called the \"episcopal\" inquisition, because it was administered by a local bishop, also known in latin as \"episcopus\". This inquisition obliged bishops to visit their diocese twice a year in search of heretics. The methods of dealing with heretics were revised gradually.\nPractices and procedures of episcopal inquisitions could vary from one diocese to another, depending on the resources available to individual bishops and their relative interest or disinterest. Convinced that Church teaching contained revealed truth, the first recourse of bishops was that of \"persuasio\". Through discourse, debates, and preaching, they sought to present a better explanation of Church teaching. This approach often proved very successful.\nLegatine inquisitions.\nThe spread of other movements from the 12th century can be seen at least in part as a reaction to the increasing moral corruption of the clergy, which included illegal marriages and the possession of extreme wealth.\nIn the Middle Ages, the Inquisition's main focus was to eradicate these new sects. Thus, its range of action was predominantly in Italy and France, where the Cathars and the Waldensians, the two main heretic movements of the period, were.\nBishops always had the authority to look into alleged heretical activity, but as it wasn't always clear what constituted heresy they conferred with their colleagues and sought advice from Rome. Legates were sent out, at first as advisors, later taking a greater role in the administration.\nDuring the pontificate of Innocent III, papal legates were sent out to stop the spread of the Cathar and Waldensian heresies to Provence and up the Rhine into Germany. Procedures began to be formalized by time of Pope Gregory IX.\nCathars.\nThe Cathars were a group of dissidents mostly in the South of France, in cities like Toulouse. The sect developed in the 12th century, apparently founded by soldiers from the Second Crusade, who, on their way back, were converted by a Bulgarian sect, the Bogomils.\nThe Cathars' main heresy was their belief in dualism: the evil God created the materialistic world and the good God created the spiritual world. Therefore, Cathars preached poverty, chastity, modesty and all those values which in their view helped people to detach themselves from materialism. The Cathars presented a problem to feudal government by their attitude towards oaths, which they declared under no circumstances allowable. Therefore, considering the religious homogeneity of that age, heresy was an attack against social and political order, besides orthodoxy.\nThe Albigensian Crusade resulted in the defeat of the Cathars militarily. After this, the Inquisition played an important role in finally destroying Catharism during the 13th and much of the 14th centuries. Punishments for Cathars varied greatly. Most frequently, they were made to wear yellow crosses atop their garments as a sign of outward penance. Others undertook obligatory pilgrimages, many for the purpose of fighting against Muslims. Another common punishment, including for returned pilgrims, was visiting a local church naked once each month to be scourged. Cathars who were slow to repent suffered imprisonment and, often, the loss of property. Others who altogether refused to repent were burned.\nWaldensians.\nThe Waldensians were mostly in Germany and North Italy. The Waldensians were a group of orthodox laymen concerned about the increasing wealth of the Church. As time passed, however, they found their beliefs at odds with Catholic teaching. In contrast with the Cathars and in line with the Church, they believed in only one God, but they did not recognize a special class of priesthood, believing in the priesthood of all believers. They also objected to the veneration of saints and martyrs, which were part of the Church's orthodoxy. They rejected the sacramental authority of the Church and its clerics and encouraged apostolic poverty. These movements became particularly popular in Southern France as well as Northern Italy and other parts of Holy Roman Empire.\nPapal inquisition.\nOne reason for Pope Gregory IX's creation of the Inquisition was to bring order and legality to the process of dealing with heresy, since there had been tendencies by mobs of townspeople to burn alleged heretics without much of a trial. According to historian Thomas Madden: \"The Inquisition was not born out of desire to crush diversity or oppress people; it was rather an attempt to stop unjust executions. ...Heresy was a crime against the \"state\". Roman law in the Code of Justinian made heresy a capital offense\" (emphasis in original). In the early Middle Ages, people accused of heresy were judged by the local lord, many of whom lacked theological training. Madden claims that \"The simple fact is that the medieval Inquisition \"saved\" uncounted thousands of innocent (and even not-so-innocent) people who would otherwise have been roasted by secular lords or mob rule\" (emphasis in original). Madden argues that while medieval secular leaders were trying to safeguard their kingdoms, the Church was trying to save souls. The Inquisition provided a means for heretics to escape death and return to the community.\nThe complaints of the two main preaching orders of the period, the Dominicans and the Franciscans, against the moral corruption of the Church, to some extent echoed those of the heretical movements, but they were doctrinally conventional, and were enlisted by Pope Innocent III in the fight against heresy. In 1231 Pope Gregory IX appointed a number of Papal Inquisitors (\"Inquisitores haereticae pravitatis\"), mostly Dominicans and Franciscans, for the various regions of Europe. As mendicants, they were accustomed to travel. Unlike the haphazard episcopal methods, the papal inquisition was thorough and systematic, keeping detailed records. Some of the few documents from the Middle Ages involving first-person speech by medieval peasants come from papal inquisition records. This tribunal or court functioned in France, Italy and parts of Germany and had virtually ceased operation by the early fourteenth century.\nPope Gregory's original intent for the Inquisition was a court of exception to inquire into and glean the beliefs of those differing from Catholic teaching, and to instruct them in the orthodox doctrine. It was hoped that heretics would see the falsity of their opinion and would return to the Roman Catholic Church. If they persisted in their heresy, however, Pope Gregory, finding it necessary to protect the Catholic community from infection, would have suspects handed over to civil authorities, since public heresy was a crime under civil law as well as Church law. The secular authorities would apply their own brands of punishment for civil disobedience which, at the time, included burning at the stake. Over centuries the tribunals took different forms, investigating and stamping out various forms of heresy, including witchcraft.\nThroughout the Inquisition's history, it was rivaled by local ecclesiastical and secular jurisdictions. No matter how determined, no pope succeeded in establishing complete control over the prosecution of heresy. Medieval kings, princes, bishops, and civil authorities all had a role in prosecuting heresy. The practice reached its apex in the second half of the 13th century. During this period, the tribunals were almost entirely free from any authority, including that of the pope. Therefore, it was almost impossible to eradicate abuse. For example, Robert le Bougre, the \"Hammer of Heretics\" (\"Malleus Haereticorum\"), was a Dominican friar who became an inquisitor known for his cruelty and violence. Another example was the case of the province of Venice, which was handed to the Franciscan inquisitors, who quickly became notorious for their frauds against the Church, by enriching themselves with confiscated property from the heretics and by the selling of absolutions. Because of their corruption, they were eventually forced by the Pope to suspend their activities in 1302.\nIn southern Europe, Church-run courts existed in the kingdom of Aragon during the medieval period, but not elsewhere in the Iberian peninsula or some other kingdoms, including England. In Scandinavian kingdoms it had hardly any impact.\nAt the beginning of the fourteenth century, two other movements attracted the attention of the Inquisition, the Knights Templar and the Beguines. It is not clear if the process against the Templars was initiated by the Inquisition on the basis of suspected heresy or if the Inquisition itself was exploited by the king of France, Philip the Fair, who owed them money and wanted the knights' wealth. In England the Crown was also deeply in debt to the Templars and, probably on that basis, the Templars were also persecuted in England, their lands forfeited and taken by others, (the last private owner being the favorite of Edward II, Hugh le Despenser). Many Templars in England were killed; some fled to Scotland and other places.\nThe Beguines were mainly a women's movement, recognized by the Church since their foundation in the thirteenth century. Marguerite Porete wrote a mystical book known as \"The Mirror of Simple Souls\". The book provoked some controversy, because of statements which some took to mean that a soul can become one with God and that when in this state it can ignore moral law, as it had no need for the Church and its sacraments, or its code of virtues. The book's teachings were easily misconstrued. Porete was eventually tried by the Dominican inquisitor of France and burned at the stake as a relapsed heretic in 1310. The Council of Vienne of 1311 proclaimed them heretics and the movement went into decline.\nThe medieval Inquisition paid little attention to sorcery until Pope John XXII was the victim of an assassination attempt via poisoning and sorcery. In a letter written in 1320 to the Inquisitors of Carcassonne and Toulouse, Cardinal William of Santa Sabina states that Pope John declared witchcraft to be heresy, and thus it could be tried under the Inquisition.\nMedieval Inquisition in Aragon.\nAlthough Raymond of Penyafort was not an inquisitor, James I of Aragon had often consulted him on questions of law regarding the practices of the Inquisition in the king's domains since Penyafort was a canon lawyer and royal advisor.\n...[T]he lawyer's deep sense of justice and equity, combined with the worthy Dominican's sense of compassion, allowed him to steer clear of the excesses that were found elsewhere in the formative years of the inquisitions into heresy.\nDespite its early implantation, the Papal Inquisition was greatly resisted within the Crown of Aragon by both population and monarchs. With time, its importance was diluted, and, by the middle of the fifteenth century, it was almost forgotten although still there according to the law.\nRegarding the living conditions of minorities, the kings of Aragon and other monarchies imposed some discriminatory taxation of religious minorities, so false conversions were a way of tax evasion.\nIn addition to the above discriminatory legislation, Aragon had laws specifically targeted at protecting minorities. For example, crusaders attacking Jewish or Muslim subjects of the King of Aragon while on their way to fight in the reconquest were punished with death by hanging. Up to the 14th century, the census and wedding records show an absolute lack of concern with avoiding intermarriage or blood mixture. Such laws were now common in most of central Europe. Both the Roman Inquisition and neighbouring Christian powers showed discomfort with Aragonese law and lack of concern with ethnicity, but to little effect.\nHigh-ranking officials of Jewish descent were not as common as in Castile, but were not unheard of either. Abraham Zacuto was a professor at the university of Cartagena. Vidal Astori was the royal silversmith for Ferdinand II of Aragon and conducted business in his name. King Ferdinand himself was also said to have remote Jewish ancestry on his mother's side.\nMedieval Inquisition in Castile.\nThere was never a tribunal of the Papal Inquisition in Castile, nor any inquisition during the Middle Ages. Members of the episcopate were charged with surveillance of the faithful and punishment of transgressors, always under the direction of the king.\nDuring the Middle Ages in Castile, the Catholic ruling class and the population paid little or no attention to heresy. Castile did not have the proliferation of anti-Jewish pamphlets as England and France did during the 13th and 14th centuries\u2014and those that have been found were modified, watered-down versions of the original stories. Jews and Muslims were tolerated and generally allowed to follow their traditional customs in domestic matters.\nThe legislation regarding Muslims and Jews in Castilian territory varied greatly, becoming more intolerant during the period of great instability and dynastic wars that occurred by the end of the 14th century. Castilian law is particularly difficult to summarize since, due to the model of the free Royal Villas, mayors and the population of border areas had the right to create their own fueros (law) that varied from one villa to the next. In general, the Castilian model was parallel to the initial model of Islamic Spain. Non-Catholics were subject to discriminatory legislation regarding taxation and some other specific discriminatory legislation\u2014such as a prohibition on wearing silk or \"flashy clothes\"\u2014that varied from county to county, but were otherwise left alone. Forced conversion of minorities was against the law, and so was the belief in the existence of witchcraft, oracles or similar superstitions. In general, all \"people from the book\" were permitted to practice their own customs and religions as far as they did not attempt proselytizing on the Christian population. Jews particularly had surprising freedoms and protections compared with other areas of Europe and were allowed to hold high public offices such as the counselor, treasurer or secretary for the crown.\nDuring most of the medieval period, intermarriage with converts was allowed and encouraged. Intellectual cooperation between religions was the norm in Castile. Some examples are the Toledo School of Translators from the 11th century. Jews and Moors were allowed to hold high offices in the administration (see Abraham Seneor, Samuel HaLevi Abulafia, Isaac Abarbanel, L\u00f3pez de Conchillos, Miguel P\u00e9rez de Almaz\u00e1n, Jaco Aben Nunnes and Fernando del Pulgar).\nA tightening of the laws to protect the right of Jews to collect loans during the Medieval Crisis was one of the causes of the revolt against Peter the Cruel and catalyst of the anti-semitic episodes of 1391 in Castile, a kingdom that had shown no significant antisemitic backlash to the black death and drought crisis of the early 14th century. Even after the sudden increase in hostility towards other religions that the kingdom experienced after the 14th-century crisis, which clearly worsened the living conditions of non-Catholics in Castile, it remained one of the most tolerant kingdoms in Europe.\nThe kingdom had serious tensions with Rome regarding the Church's attempts to extend its authority into the kingdom. A focus of conflict was Castilian resistance to truly abandon the Mozarabic Rite, and the refusal to grant Papal control over Reconquest land (a request Aragon and Portugal conceded). These conflicts added to a strong resistance to allowing the creation of an Inquisition, and the kingdom's general willingness to accept heretics seeking refuge from prosecution in France.\nJoan of Arc.\nIn the spring of 1429 during the Hundred Years' War, in obedience to what she said was the command of God, Joan of Arc inspired the Dauphin's armies in a series of stunning military victories which lifted the siege of Orleans and destroyed a large percentage of the remaining English forces at the battle of Patay. A series of military setbacks eventually led to her capture in the Spring of 1430 by the Burgundians, who were allied with the English. They delivered her to them for 10,000 livres. In December of that same year she was transferred to Rouen, the military headquarters and administrative capital in France of King Henry VI of England, and placed on trial for heresy before a Church court headed by Bishop Pierre Cauchon, a supporter of the English.\nThe trial was politically motivated. Cauchon, although a native of France, had served in the English government since 1418, and he was therefore hostile to a woman who had worked for the opposing side. The same was true of the other tribunal members. Ascribing a diabolic origin to her victories would be an effective way to ruin her reputation and bolster the morale of English troops. Thus the decision to involve the Inquisition, which did not initiate the trial and in fact showed a reluctance throughout its duration.\nSeventy charges were brought against her, including accusations of heresy and dressing as a male (i.e., wearing soldiers' clothing and armor). Eyewitnesses later said that Joan had told them she was wearing this clothing and keeping it \"firmly laced and tied together\" because the tunic could be tied to the long boots to keep her guards from pulling her clothing off during their occasional attempts to rape her.\nJoan was first condemned to life imprisonment and the deputy-inquisitor, Jean Le Maitre (whom the eyewitness said only attended because of threats from the English), obtained from her assurances of relinquishing her male clothes. However, after four days, during which she was said to have been subjected to attempted rape by English soldiers, she put her soldier's clothing back on because (according to the eyewitnesses) she needed protection against rape. Cauchon declared her a relapsed heretic, and she was burned at the stake two days later on 30 May 1431.\nIn 1455, a petition by Joan of Arc's mother Isabelle led to a re-trial designed to investigate the dubious circumstances which led to Joan's execution. The Inquisitor-General of France was put in charge of the new trial, which opened in Notre Dame de Paris on 7 November 1455. After analyzing all the proceedings, including Joan's answers to the allegations and the testimony of 115 witnesses who were called to testify during the appellate process, the inquisitor overturned her condemnation on 7 July 1456. Joan of Arc was eventually canonized in 1920.\nHistorian Edward Peters identifies a number of illegalities in Joan's first trial in which she had been convicted.\nInquisition procedure.\nThe papal inquisition developed a number of procedures to discover and prosecute heretics. These codes and procedures detailed how an inquisitorial court was to function. If the accused renounced their heresy and returned to the Church, forgiveness was granted and a penance was imposed. If the accused upheld their heresy, they were excommunicated and turned over to secular authorities. The penalties for heresy, though not as severe as the secular courts of Europe at the time, were codified within the ecclesiastic courts as well (e.g. confiscation of property, turning heretics over to the secular courts for punishment). Additionally, the various \"key terms\" of the inquisitorial courts were defined at this time, including, for example, \"heretics,\" \u201cbelievers,\" \"those suspect of heresy,\" \"those simply suspected,\" \"those vehemently suspected,\" and \"those most vehemently suspected\".\nInvestigation.\nThe townspeople would be gathered in a public place. The inquisitors would provide an opportunity for anyone to step forward and denounce themselves in exchange for leniency. Legally, there had to be at least two witnesses, although conscientious judges rarely contented themselves with that number.\nTrial.\nAt the beginning of the trial, defendants were invited to name those who had \"mortal hatred\" against them. If the accusers were among those named, the defendant was set free and the charges dismissed; the accusers would face life imprisonment. This option was meant to keep the inquisition from becoming involved in local grudges. Early legal consultations on conducting inquisition stress that it is better that the guilty go free than that the innocent be punished. Gregory IX urged Conrad of Marburg: \"ut puniatur sic temeritas perversorum quod innocentiae puritas non laedatur\" \u2013 i.e., \"not to punish the wicked so as to hurt the innocent\".\nThere was no personal confrontation of witnesses, neither was there any cross-examination. Witnesses for the defense hardly ever appeared, as they would almost infallibly be suspected of being heretics or favorable to heresy. At any stage of the trial the accused could appeal to Rome.\nTorture.\nLike the inquisitorial process itself, torture was an ancient Roman legal practice commonly used in secular courts. \nOn May 15, 1252, Pope Innocent IV issued a papal bull entitled \"Ad extirpanda\", which authorized the limited use of torture by inquisitors. Much of the brutality commonly associated with the Inquisition was actually previously common in secular courts, but prohibited under the Inquisition, including torture methods that resulted in bloodshed, miscarriages, mutilation or death. Also, torture could be performed only once, and for a limited duration.\nIn preparation for the Jubilee in 2000, the Vatican opened the archives of the Holy Office (the modern successor to the Inquisition) to a team of 30 scholars from around the world. According to the governor general of the Order of the Holy Sepulchre, recent studies \"seem to indicate\" that \"torture and the death penalty were not applied with the pitiless rigor\" often ascribed to the Inquisition. Other methods such as threats and imprisonment seem to have proven more effective.\nPunishment.\nA council in Tours in 1164, presided over by Pope Alexander III, ordered the confiscation of a heretic's goods. Of 5,400 people interrogated in Toulouse between 1245 and 1246, 184 received penitential yellow crosses (used to mark repentant Cathars), 23 were imprisoned for life, and none were sent to the stake.\nThe most extreme penalty available in antiheretical proceedings was reserved for relapsed or stubborn heretics. The unrepentant and apostates could be \"relaxed\" to secular authority, however, opening the convicted to the possibility of various corporal punishments, up to and including being burned at the stake. Execution was neither performed by the Church, nor was it a sentence available to the officials involved in the inquisition, who, as clerics, were forbidden to kill. The accused also faced the possibility that his or her property might be confiscated. In some cases, accusers may have been motivated by a desire to take the property of the accused, though this is a difficult assertion to prove in the majority of areas where the inquisition was active, as the inquisition had several layers of oversight built into its framework in a specific attempt to limit prosecutorial misconduct.\nThe inquisitors generally preferred not to hand over heretics to the secular arm for execution if they could persuade the heretic to repent: \"Ecclesia non novit sanguinem (The Church knows not Blood)\". For example, of the 900 guilty verdicts levied against 636 individuals by the Dominican friar and inquisitor Bernard Gui, no more than 45 resulted in execution.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The possible existence of unseen microbial life was suspected from antiquity, with an early attestation in Jain literature authored in 6th-century\u00a0BC India. The scientific study of microorganisms began with their observation under the microscope in the 1670s by Anton van Leeuwenhoek. In the 1850s, Louis Pasteur found that microorganisms caused food spoilage, debunking the theory of spontaneous generation. In the 1880s, Robert Koch discovered that microorganisms caused the diseases tuberculosis, cholera, diphtheria, and anthrax.\nMicroorganisms are extremely diverse, representing most unicellular organisms in all three domains of life: two of the three domains, Archaea and Bacteria, only contain microorganisms. The third domain, Eukaryota, includes all multicellular organisms as well as many unicellular protists and protozoans that are microbes. Some protists are related to animals and some to green plants. Many multicellular organisms are also microscopic, namely micro-animals, some fungi, and some algae.\nMicroorganisms can have very different habitats, and live everywhere from the poles to the equator, in deserts, geysers, rocks, and the deep sea. Some are adapted to extremes such as very hot or very cold conditions, others to high pressure, and a few, such as \"Deinococcus radiodurans\", to high radiation environments. Microorganisms also make up the microbiota found in and on all multicellular organisms. There is evidence that 3.45-billion-year-old Australian rocks once contained microorganisms, the earliest direct evidence of life on Earth.\nMicrobes are important in human culture and health in many ways, serving to ferment foods and treat sewage, and to produce fuel, enzymes, and other bioactive compounds. Microbes are essential tools in biology as model organisms and have been put to use in biological warfare and bioterrorism. Microbes are a vital component of fertile soil. In the human body, microorganisms make up the human microbiota, including the essential gut flora. The pathogens responsible for many infectious diseases are microbes and, as such, are the target of hygiene measures.\nDiscovery.\nAncient precursors.\nThe possible existence of microscopic organisms was discussed for many centuries before their discovery in the 17th century. By the 6th century\u00a0BC, the Jains of present-day India postulated the existence of tiny organisms called \"nigodas\". These nigodas are said to be born in clusters; they live everywhere, including the bodies of plants, animals, and people; and their life lasts only for a fraction of a second. According to Mahavira, the 24th preacher of Jainism, the humans destroy these nigodas on a massive scale, when they eat, breathe, sit, and move. Many modern Jains assert that Mahavira's teachings presage the existence of microorganisms as discovered by science.\nThe earliest known idea to indicate the possibility of diseases spreading by yet unseen organisms was that of the Roman scholar Marcus Terentius Varro in a 1st-century\u00a0BC book entitled \"On Agriculture\" in which he called the unseen creatures animalia minuta, and warns against locating a homestead near a swamp:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIn \"The Canon of Medicine\" (1020), Avicenna suggested that tuberculosis and other diseases might be contagious.\nEarly modern.\nIn the 15th-century, Turkish scientist Akshamsaddin speculated about microbial life relating to disease in his work (\"The Material of Life\"):\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;It is a mistake to assume that diseases appear in individuals one by one. Diseases are transmitted from person to person. This transmission takes place through small seeds that are invisible to the eye, but are still alive.\nIn 1546, Girolamo Fracastoro proposed that epidemic diseases were caused by transferable seedlike entities that could transmit infection by direct or indirect contact, or even without contact over long distances.\nAntonie van Leeuwenhoek is considered to be one of the fathers of microbiology. He was the first in 1673 to discover and conduct scientific experiments with microorganisms, using simple single-lensed microscopes of his own design. Robert Hooke, a contemporary of Leeuwenhoek, also used microscopy to observe microbial life in the form of the fruiting bodies of moulds. In his 1665 book \"Micrographia\", he made drawings of studies, and he coined the term \"cell\".\n19th century.\nLouis Pasteur (1822\u20131895) exposed boiled broths to the air, in vessels that contained a filter to prevent particles from passing through to the growth medium, and also in vessels without a filter, but with air allowed in via a curved tube so dust particles would settle and not come in contact with the broth. By boiling the broth beforehand, Pasteur ensured that no microorganisms survived within the broths at the beginning of his experiment. Nothing grew in the broths in the course of Pasteur's experiment. This meant that the living organisms that grew in such broths came from outside, as spores on dust, rather than spontaneously generated within the broth. Thus, Pasteur refuted the theory of spontaneous generation and supported the germ theory of disease.\nIn 1876, Robert Koch (1843\u20131910) established that microorganisms can cause disease. He found that the blood of cattle that were infected with anthrax always had large numbers of \"Bacillus anthracis\". Koch found that he could transmit anthrax from one animal to another by taking a small sample of blood from the infected animal and injecting it into a healthy one, and this caused the healthy animal to become sick. He also found that he could grow the bacteria in a nutrient broth, then inject it into a healthy animal, and cause illness. Based on these experiments, he devised criteria for establishing a causal link between a microorganism and a disease and these are now known as Koch's postulates. Although these postulates cannot be applied in all cases, they do retain historical importance to the development of scientific thought and are still being used today.\nThe discovery of microorganisms such as \"Euglena\" that did not fit into either the animal or plant kingdoms, since they were photosynthetic like plants, but motile like animals, led to the naming of a third kingdom in the 1860s. In 1860 John Hogg called this the Protoctista, and in 1866 Ernst Haeckel named it the Protista.\nThe work of Pasteur and Koch did not accurately reflect the true diversity of the microbial world because of their exclusive focus on microorganisms having direct medical relevance. It was not until the work of Martinus Beijerinck and Sergei Winogradsky in the late 19th century that the true breadth of microbiology was revealed. Beijerinck made two major contributions to microbiology: the discovery of viruses and the development of enrichment culture techniques. While his work on the tobacco mosaic virus established the basic principles of virology, it was his development of enrichment culturing that had the most immediate impact on microbiology by allowing for the cultivation of a wide range of microbes with wildly different physiologies. Winogradsky was the first to develop the concept of chemolithotrophy and to thereby reveal the essential role played by microorganisms in geochemical processes. He was responsible for the first isolation and description of both nitrifying and nitrogen-fixing bacteria. French-Canadian microbiologist F\u00e9lix d'H\u00e9relle co-discovered bacteriophages and was one of the earliest applied microbiologists.\nClassification and structure.\nMicroorganisms can be found almost anywhere on Earth. Bacteria and archaea are almost always microscopic, while a number of eukaryotes are also microscopic, including most protists, some fungi, as well as some micro-animals and plants. Viruses are generally regarded as not living and therefore not considered to be microorganisms, although a subfield of microbiology is virology, the study of viruses.\nEvolution.\nSingle-celled microorganisms were the first forms of life to develop on Earth, approximately 3.5 billion years ago. Further evolution was slow, and for about 3\u00a0billion years in the Precambrian eon, (much of the history of life on Earth), all organisms were microorganisms. Bacteria, algae and fungi have been identified in amber that is 220\u00a0million years old, which shows that the morphology of microorganisms has changed little since at least the Triassic period. The newly discovered biological role played by nickel, however \u2013 especially that brought about by volcanic eruptions from the Siberian Traps \u2013 may have accelerated the evolution of methanogens towards the end of the Permian\u2013Triassic extinction event.\nMicroorganisms tend to have a relatively fast rate of evolution. Most microorganisms can reproduce rapidly, and bacteria are also able to freely exchange genes through conjugation, transformation and transduction, even between widely divergent species. This horizontal gene transfer, coupled with a high mutation rate and other means of transformation, allows microorganisms to swiftly evolve (via natural selection) to survive in new environments and respond to environmental stresses. This rapid evolution is important in medicine, as it has led to the development of multidrug resistant pathogenic bacteria, \"superbugs\", that are resistant to antibiotics.\nA possible transitional form of microorganism between a prokaryote and a eukaryote was discovered in 2012 by Japanese scientists. \"Parakaryon myojinensis\" is a unique microorganism larger than a typical prokaryote, but with nuclear material enclosed in a membrane as in a eukaryote, and the presence of endosymbionts. This is seen to be the first plausible evolutionary form of microorganism, showing a stage of development from the prokaryote to the eukaryote.\nArchaea.\nArchaea are prokaryotic unicellular organisms, and form the first domain of life in Carl Woese's three-domain system. A prokaryote is defined as having no cell nucleus or other membrane bound-organelle. Archaea share this defining feature with the bacteria with which they were once grouped. In 1990 the microbiologist Woese proposed the three-domain system that divided living things into bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes, and thereby split the prokaryote domain.\nArchaea differ from bacteria in both their genetics and biochemistry. For example, while bacterial cell membranes are made from phosphoglycerides with ester bonds, Achaean membranes are made of ether lipids. Archaea were originally described as extremophiles living in extreme environments, such as hot springs, but have since been found in all types of habitats. Only now are scientists beginning to realize how common archaea are in the environment, with Thermoproteota (formerly Crenarchaeota) being the most common form of life in the ocean, dominating ecosystems below in depth. These organisms are also common in soil and play a vital role in ammonia oxidation.\nThe combined domains of archaea and bacteria make up the most diverse and abundant group of organisms on Earth and inhabit practically all environments where the temperature is below +. They are found in water, soil, air, as the microbiome of an organism, hot springs and even deep beneath the Earth's crust in rocks. The number of prokaryotes is estimated to be around five nonillion, or 5 \u00d7 1030, accounting for at least half the biomass on Earth.\nThe biodiversity of the prokaryotes is unknown, but may be very large. A May 2016 estimate, based on laws of scaling from known numbers of species against the size of organism, gives an estimate of perhaps 1\u00a0trillion species on the planet, of which most would be microorganisms. Currently, only one-thousandth of one percent of that total have been described. Archael cells of some species aggregate and transfer DNA from one cell to another through direct contact, particularly under stressful environmental conditions that cause DNA damage.\nBacteria.\nLike archaea, bacteria are prokaryotic \u2013 unicellular, and having no cell nucleus or other membrane-bound organelle. Bacteria are microscopic, with a few extremely rare exceptions, such as \"Thiomargarita namibiensis\". Bacteria function and reproduce as individual cells, but they can often aggregate in multicellular colonies. Some species such as myxobacteria can aggregate into complex swarming structures, operating as multicellular groups as part of their life cycle, or form clusters in bacterial colonies such as \"E. coli\".\nTheir genome is usually a circular bacterial chromosome \u2013 a single loop of DNA, although they can also harbor small pieces of DNA called plasmids. These plasmids can be transferred between cells through bacterial conjugation. Bacteria have an enclosing cell wall, which provides strength and rigidity to their cells. They reproduce by binary fission or sometimes by budding, but do not undergo meiotic sexual reproduction. However, many bacterial species can transfer DNA between individual cells by a horizontal gene transfer process referred to as natural transformation. Some species form extraordinarily resilient spores, but for bacteria this is a mechanism for survival, not reproduction. Under optimal conditions bacteria can grow extremely rapidly and their numbers can double as quickly as every 20 minutes.\nEukaryotes.\nMost living things that are visible to the naked eye in their adult form are eukaryotes, including humans. However, many eukaryotes are also microorganisms. Unlike bacteria and archaea, eukaryotes contain organelles such as the cell nucleus, the Golgi apparatus and mitochondria in their cells. The nucleus is an organelle that houses the DNA that makes up a cell's genome. DNA (Deoxyribonucleic acid) itself is arranged in complex chromosomes.\nMitochondria are organelles vital in metabolism as they are the site of the citric acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation. They evolved from symbiotic bacteria and retain a remnant genome. Like bacteria, plant cells have cell walls, and contain organelles such as chloroplasts in addition to the organelles in other eukaryotes. Chloroplasts produce energy from light by photosynthesis, and were also originally symbiotic bacteria.\nUnicellular eukaryotes consist of a single cell throughout their life cycle. This qualification is significant since most multicellular eukaryotes consist of a single cell called a zygote only at the beginning of their life cycles. Microbial eukaryotes can be either haploid or diploid, and some organisms have multiple cell nuclei.\nUnicellular eukaryotes usually reproduce asexually by mitosis under favorable conditions. However, under stressful conditions such as nutrient limitations and other conditions associated with DNA damage, they tend to reproduce sexually by meiosis and syngamy.\nProtists.\nOf eukaryotic groups, the protists are most commonly unicellular and microscopic. This is a highly diverse group of organisms that are not easy to classify. Several algae species are multicellular protists, and slime molds have unique life cycles that involve switching between unicellular, colonial, and multicellular forms. The number of species of protists is unknown since only a small proportion has been identified. Protist diversity is high in oceans, deep sea-vents, river sediment and an acidic river, suggesting that many eukaryotic microbial communities may yet be discovered.\nFungi.\nThe fungi have several unicellular species, such as baker's yeast (\"Saccharomyces cerevisiae\") and fission yeast (\"Schizosaccharomyces pombe\"). Some fungi, such as the pathogenic yeast \"Candida albicans\", can undergo phenotypic switching and grow as single cells in some environments, and filamentous hyphae in others.\nPlants.\nThe green algae are a large group of photosynthetic eukaryotes that include many microscopic organisms. Although some green algae are classified as protists, others such as charophyta are classified with embryophyte plants, which are the most familiar group of land plants. Algae can grow as single cells, or in long chains of cells. The green algae include unicellular and colonial flagellates, usually but not always with two flagella per cell, as well as various colonial, coccoid, and filamentous forms. In the Charales, which are the algae most closely related to higher plants, cells differentiate into several distinct tissues within the organism. There are about 6000 species of green algae.\nEcology.\nMicroorganisms are found in almost every habitat present in nature, including hostile environments such as the North and South poles, deserts, geysers, and rocks. They also include all the marine microorganisms of the oceans and deep sea. Some types of microorganisms have adapted to extreme environments and sustained colonies; these organisms are known as extremophiles. Extremophiles have been isolated from rocks as much as 7 kilometres below the Earth's surface, and it has been suggested that the amount of organisms living below the Earth's surface is comparable with the amount of life on or above the surface. Extremophiles have been known to survive for a prolonged time in a vacuum, and can be highly resistant to radiation, which may even allow them to survive in space. Many types of microorganisms have intimate symbiotic relationships with other larger organisms; some of which are mutually beneficial (mutualism), while others can be damaging to the host organism (parasitism). If microorganisms can cause disease in a host they are known as \"pathogens\". Microorganisms play critical roles in Earth's biogeochemical cycles as they are responsible for decomposition and nitrogen fixation.\nBacteria use regulatory networks that allow them to adapt to almost every environmental niche on earth. A network of interactions among diverse types of molecules including DNA, RNA, proteins and metabolites, is utilised by the bacteria to achieve regulation of gene expression. In bacteria, the principal function of regulatory networks is to control the response to environmental changes, for example nutritional status and environmental stress. A complex organization of networks permits the microorganism to coordinate and integrate multiple environmental signals.\nExtremophiles.\nExtremophiles are microorganisms that have adapted so that they can survive and even thrive in extreme environments that are normally fatal to most life-forms. Thermophiles and hyperthermophiles thrive in high temperatures. Psychrophiles thrive in extremely low temperatures. \u2013 Temperatures as high as , as low as Halophiles such as \"Halobacterium salinarum\" (an archaean) thrive in high salt conditions, up to saturation. Alkaliphiles thrive in an alkaline pH of about 8.5\u201311. Acidophiles can thrive in a pH of 2.0 or less. Piezophiles thrive at very high pressures: up to 1,000\u20132,000 atm, down to 0 atm as in a vacuum of space. A few extremophiles such as \"Deinococcus radiodurans\" are radioresistant, resisting radiation exposure of up to 5k Gy. Extremophiles are significant in different ways. They extend terrestrial life into much of the Earth's hydrosphere, crust and atmosphere, their specific evolutionary adaptation mechanisms to their extreme environment can be exploited in biotechnology, and their very existence under such extreme conditions increases the potential for extraterrestrial life.\nPlants and soil.\nThe nitrogen cycle in soils depends on the fixation of atmospheric nitrogen. This is achieved by a number of diazotrophs. One way this can occur is in the root nodules of legumes that contain symbiotic bacteria of the genera \"Rhizobium\", \"Mesorhizobium\", \"Sinorhizobium\", \"Bradyrhizobium\", and \"Azorhizobium\".\nThe roots of plants create a narrow region known as the rhizosphere that supports many microorganisms known as the root microbiome.\nThese microorganisms in the root microbiome are able to interact with each other and surrounding plants through signals and cues. For example, mycorrhizal fungi are able to communicate with the root systems of many plants through chemical signals between both the plant and fungi. This results in a mutualistic symbiosis between the two. However, these signals can be eavesdropped by other microorganisms, such as the soil bacteria, \"Myxococcus xanthus\", which preys on other bacteria. Eavesdropping, or the interception of signals from unintended receivers, such as plants and microorganisms, can lead to large-scale, evolutionary consequences. For example, signaler-receiver pairs, like plant-microorganism pairs, may lose the ability to communicate with neighboring populations because of variability in eavesdroppers. In adapting to avoid local eavesdroppers, signal divergence could occur and thus, lead to the isolation of plants and microorganisms from the inability to communicate with other populations.\nSymbiosis.\nA lichen is a symbiosis of a macroscopic fungus with photosynthetic microbial algae or cyanobacteria.\nApplications.\nMicroorganisms are useful in producing foods, treating waste water, creating biofuels and a wide range of chemicals and enzymes. They are invaluable in research as model organisms. They have been weaponised and sometimes used in warfare and bioterrorism. They are vital to agriculture through their roles in maintaining soil fertility and in decomposing organic matter. They also have applications in aquaculture, such as in biofloc technology.\nFood production.\nMicroorganisms are used in a fermentation process to make yoghurt, cheese, curd, kefir, ayran, xynogala, and other types of food. Fermentation cultures provide flavour and aroma, and inhibit undesirable organisms. They are used to leaven bread, and to convert sugars to alcohol in wine and beer. Microorganisms are used in brewing, wine making, baking, pickling and other food-making processes.\nWater treatment.\nThese depend for their ability to clean up water contaminated with organic material on microorganisms that can respire dissolved substances. Respiration may be aerobic, with a well-oxygenated filter bed such as a slow sand filter. Anaerobic digestion by methanogens generate useful methane gas as a by-product.\nEnergy.\nMicroorganisms are used in fermentation to produce ethanol, and in biogas reactors to produce methane. Scientists are researching the use of algae to produce liquid fuels, and bacteria to convert various forms of agricultural and urban waste into usable fuels.\nChemicals, enzymes.\nMicroorganisms are used to produce many commercial and industrial chemicals, enzymes and other bioactive molecules. Organic acids produced on a large industrial scale by microbial fermentation include acetic acid produced by acetic acid bacteria such as \"Acetobacter aceti\", butyric acid made by the bacterium \"Clostridium butyricum\", lactic acid made by \"Lactobacillus\" and other lactic acid bacteria, and citric acid produced by the mould fungus \"Aspergillus niger\". \nMicroorganisms are used to prepare bioactive molecules such as Streptokinase from the bacterium \"Streptococcus\", Cyclosporin A from the ascomycete fungus \"Tolypocladium inflatum\", and statins produced by the yeast \"Monascus purpureus\".\nScience.\nMicroorganisms are essential tools in biotechnology, biochemistry, genetics, and molecular biology. The yeasts \"Saccharomyces cerevisiae\" and \"Schizosaccharomyces pombe\" are important model organisms in science, since they are simple eukaryotes that can be grown rapidly in large numbers and are easily manipulated. They are particularly valuable in genetics, genomics and proteomics. Microorganisms can be harnessed for uses such as creating steroids and treating skin diseases. Scientists are also considering using microorganisms for living fuel cells, and as a solution for pollution.\nWarfare.\nIn the Middle Ages, as an early example of biological warfare, diseased corpses were thrown into castles during sieges using catapults or other siege engines. Individuals near the corpses were exposed to the pathogen and were likely to spread that pathogen to others.\nIn modern times, bioterrorism has included the 1984 Rajneeshee bioterror attack and the 1993 release of anthrax by Aum Shinrikyo in Tokyo.\nSoil.\nMicrobes can make nutrients and minerals in the soil available to plants, produce hormones that spur growth, stimulate the plant immune system and trigger or dampen stress responses. In general a more diverse set of soil microbes results in fewer plant diseases and higher yield.\nHuman health.\nHuman gut flora.\nMicroorganisms can form an endosymbiotic relationship with other, larger organisms. For example, microbial symbiosis plays a crucial role in the immune system. The microorganisms that make up the gut flora in the gastrointestinal tract contribute to gut immunity, synthesize vitamins such as folic acid and biotin, and ferment complex indigestible carbohydrates. Some microorganisms that are seen to be beneficial to health are termed probiotics and are available as dietary supplements, or food additives.\nDisease.\nMicroorganisms are the causative agents (pathogens) in many infectious diseases. The organisms involved include pathogenic bacteria, causing diseases such as plague, tuberculosis and anthrax; protozoan parasites, causing diseases such as malaria, sleeping sickness, dysentery and toxoplasmosis; and also fungi causing diseases such as ringworm, candidiasis or histoplasmosis. However, other diseases such as influenza, yellow fever or AIDS are caused by pathogenic viruses, which are not usually classified as living organisms and are not, therefore, microorganisms by the strict definition. No clear examples of archaean pathogens are known, although a relationship has been proposed between the presence of some archaean methanogens and human periodontal disease. Numerous microbial pathogens are capable of sexual processes that appear to facilitate their survival in their infected host.\nHygiene.\nHygiene is a set of practices to avoid infection or food spoilage by eliminating microorganisms from the surroundings. As microorganisms, in particular bacteria, are found virtually everywhere, harmful microorganisms may be reduced to acceptable levels rather than actually eliminated. In food preparation, microorganisms are reduced by preservation methods such as cooking, cleanliness of utensils, short storage periods, or by low temperatures. If complete sterility is needed, as with surgical equipment, an autoclave is used to kill microorganisms with heat and pressure.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Micronations are classified separately from de facto states and quasi-states; they are also not considered to be autonomous or self-governing as they lack the legal basis in international law for their existence. The activities of micronations are almost always trivial enough to be ignored rather than disputed by the established nations whose territory they claim\u2014referred to in micronationalism as \"macronations\". Several micronations have issued coins, flags, postage stamps, passports, medals and other state-related items, some as a source of revenue. Motivations for the creation of micronations include theoretical experimentation, political protest, artistic expression, personal entertainment and the conduct of criminal activity. The study of micronationalism is known as micropatriology or micropatrology.\nAlthough several historical states have been retroactively called micronations, the concept was formulated in the 1970s, with a particular influence from the International Micropatrological Society. Micronationalism saw several developments thereafter, with several micronations being founded in Australia in the 1970s and Japan in the 1980s. As a result of the emergence of the World Wide Web in the mid-1990s, micronationalism lost much of its traditionally eccentric anti-establishment sentiment in favour of more hobbyist perspectives, and the number of exclusively online or merely simulation-based micronations expanded dramatically. This has allowed several intermicronational organisations to form, as well as allowing for many diplomatic summits to take place between micronations since the 2000s, including the biennial MicroCon convention.\nDefinition.\nMicronations are aspirant states that claim independence but lack legal recognition by world governments or major international organisations. Micronations are classified separately from states with limited recognition and quasi-states, nor are they considered to be autonomous or self-governing as they lack the legal basis in international law for their existence. While some are secessionist in nature, most micronations are widely regarded as sovereignty projects that instead seek to mimic a sovereign state rather than to achieve international recognition, and their activities are almost always trivial enough to be ignored rather than challenged by the established nations whose territory they claim\u2014referred to as a \"macronation\" in micronationalism. Some micronations admit to having no intention of actually becoming internationally recognised as sovereign. Geographically, most micronations are very small, are often the outgrowth of a single individual, rely on their sovereign state to some extent, and mimic sovereign states by creating their own government, legislation, proclaiming national symbols, holding national elections and engaging in diplomacy with other micronations. While most micronations claim sovereignty over physical territory, others are based solely around the Internet or do not claim sovereignty at all, a hobbyist paradigm of micronationalism that arose with the rise of the Internet from the mid-1990s onwards.\nIn 2021, legal academics Harry Hobbs and George Williams, in their \"Micronations and the Search for Sovereignty\", defined micronations as \"self-declared nations that perform and mimic acts of sovereignty, and adopt many of the protocols of nations, but lack a foundation in domestic and international law for their existence and are not recognised as nations in domestic or international forums\".\nOnline dictionary \"Collins English Dictionary\", published by HarperCollins, gives a similar definition: \"An entity, typically existing only on the internet or within the private property of its members, that lays claim to sovereign status as an independent nation, but which is unrecognized by real nations.\"\nHistory.\nRetrospective micronations.\nSeveral historical political entities have been retroactively described as micronations in academic and journalistic works, including the Islands of Refreshment (existed 1811\u201316), Court in Exile of the Kingdom of Araucan\u00eda and Patagonia (since 1860), State of Scott (1861\u20131986), Republic of Parva Domus Magna Quies (since 1878), and the more contemporary Kingdom of Elleore (since 1944), Republic of Saugeais (since 1947), Principality of Outer Baldonia (1949\u20131973) and Sultanate of M'Simbati (1959\u2013fl.\u20091964).\nLibertarian micronations and seasteading projects: 1964\u20131972.\nSeveral entities that can be considered micronations by contemporary standards were established throughout the 1960s and early 1970s and based on ideals of libertarianism and many of them created via seasteading.\nNew Atlantis was founded in 1964 by writer Leicester Hemingway, claiming a bamboo raft that he had constructed with steel, iron piping and rock. Hemingway had it towed off the coast of Jamaica and argued that it was technically an island and fully sovereign based on the Guano Islands Act of 1856. Although Hemingway had plans to expand the raft, it was destroyed within a few years by a cyclone, and the project was completely abandoned in 1973. In 1967, Paddy Roy Bates squatted on HM Fort Roughs, an offshore platform in the North Sea used during World War II approximately off the coast of the United Kingdom. Bates had intended to broadcast a pirate radio station from the platform, however ultimately never did so. He instead declared the independence of Fort Roughs and declared it the Principality of Sealand. Bates died in 2012, and Michael Bates has since succeeded him as Prince of Sealand.\nOperation Atlantis was a project started in 1968 by Werner Stiefel, aiming to establish a new, libertarian nation in international waters via seasteading. The operation launched a ferrocement boat on the Hudson River in December 1971, piloting it to an area near the Bahamas with the intent to permanently anchor it as their territory. Upon reaching its destination, however, it sank in a hurricane. After a number of subsequent failed attempts to construct a habitable sea platform and achieve sovereign status, the project was abandoned in 1976. The Republic of Rose Island was an artificial platform originally constructed as a tourist attraction in the Adriatic Sea in 1968. However, Italian architect Giorgio Rosa soon declared it sovereign. The micronation had its own currency, a post office and commercial establishments. In 1969, the Italian Navy used explosives to destroy the facility, claiming it was a ploy to raise money from tourists while avoiding national taxation. The Republic of Minerva was a libertarian project that succeeded in building a small artificial island on the Minerva Reefs in 1972 by importing sand. It was invaded by troops from Tonga that same year, who annexed it before destroying the island. During its brief existence, Minerva was a media sensation.\nConceptualisation.\nAs of January 1973, the Office of the Geographer of the United States Department of State had a file cabinet for \"countries which are only partially real\", which included the Kingdom of Humanity, Outer Baldonia, Minerva and the Sovereign Military Order of Malta\u2014not a micronation\u2014among others; in the mid-1980s, the file was maintained by geographer George J. Demko. Writer Philip J. Hilts added, \"We know the Eastern bloc, the Western bloc, and the Third World nations. But there is another universe of nations which exist apart from the familiar countries.\" The International Micropatrological Society (IMS), an American learned society and research institute, was founded in 1973 and dedicated to the study of micronations, a discipline it named \"micropatrology\". By 1976, it had documents pertaining to 128 micronations and similar political entities. The first use of \"micronation\" in a book was in an eponymous dedicated section of the 1978 \"The People's Almanac#2\" by David Wallechinsky and Irving Wallace. In 1979, the first book about micronations, \"How to Start Your Own Country\", was published by Erwin S. Strauss. The IMS contributed considerably to the work. A second edition of the work was published in 1984 by Loompanics, followed in 1999 by a third edition published by Paladin Press. According to the Yearbook of International Organizations, the IMS was disestablished in 1988.\nInitial developments in Australia: 1970\u20131981.\nAustralia has a disproportionate number of micronations compared to other countries. The first micronation founded within Australia was the Principality of Hutt River in 1970. It was declared independent by farmer Leonard Casley over a dispute concerning wheat production quotas. In 2017, the Supreme Court of Western Australia ordered that Casley pay $2.7 million in unpaid tax, and that his son Arthur Casley pay $242,000 in unpaid tax. Casley abdicated in 2017 in favour of his son Graeme. Leonard died in 2019, and Hutt River dissolved the following year amidst continued disputes with the Australian Taxation Office as well as the financial impact caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. In 1976, the Province of Bumbunga was declared by Alec Brackstone in response to the 1975 Australian constitutional crisis. Brackstone, an ardent British monarchist, became alarmed by what he saw as a drift away from the Australian system of constitutional monarchy toward outright republicanism. Thus, to ensure that at least one portion of Australia would remain loyal to the British Crown, Bumbunga was declared.\nThe Sovereign State of Aeterna Lucina was proclaimed in 1978 by German migrant Paul Neuman. Aeterna Lucina came to public attention in 1990 when Neuman faced fraud charges in the New South Wales court system relating to land sale offences; the case was abandoned in 1992. In 1979, the Independent State of Rainbow Creek was declared by Thomas Barnes in protest of alleged incompetence by the Government of Victoria in regards to the flooding of his and others' properties. He was inspired by Hutt River. The Grand Duchy of Avram was established in Tasmania in the early 1980s by politician John Charlton Rudge, and issues its own banknotes. In recognition of his status, Rudge legally changed his name to John the Duke of Avram. In 1981, the Empire of Atlantium was founded in Sydney as a non-territorial global government based on the ideals of secularism, progressivism and liberalism. Among the causes Atlantium supports are the right to unrestricted international freedom of movement, the right to abortion, and the right to assisted suicide.\nMicronational community in Japan: 1981\u20131991.\nIn 1981, drawing on a news story about Hemingway's New Atlantis, novelist Hisashi Inoue wrote a 700-page work of magic realism, \"Kirikirijin\", about a village that secedes from Japan and proclaims its bumpkinish, marginalized dialect its national language, and its subsequent war of independence. This single-handedly inspired a large number of real-world Japanese villages, mostly in the northern regions, to declare independence, generally as a move to raise awareness of their unique culture and crafts for urban Japanese who saw village life as backwards and uncultured. These micronations, known as mini-independent countries (), held intermicronational summits, and some of them formed confederations and intermicronational organisations. The Ginko Federation held an intermicronational Olympic games in 1986. However, the economic impact of the Japanese asset price bubble in 1991 ended the boom. Many of the villages were forced to merge with larger cities, and the micronations and confederations were generally dissolved.\nProtest micronations: 1980s.\nThe 1980s saw the establishment of several micronational entities in protest.\nThe Free Republic of Wendland was a protest camp established in Gorleben, West Germany, in 1980 in order to protest against the establishment of a nuclear waste dump at the site. The residents created a border checkpoint and built a temporary village with more than 100 huts, ranging from elaborate round houses to tents. After 33 days, the local police moved in and evicted the camp. Also in 1980, the Independent State of Aramoana was declared by residents of the eponymous settlement during the Save Aramoana Campaign, which was opposed to the proposed construction of an aluminium smelter at Aramoana in New Zealand. This was because the project called for the destruction of the villages of Aramoana and Te Ngaru, and also threatened a local wildlife reserve. The project was ultimately abandoned in the early 1980s, and the micronation of Aramoana peacefully reintegrated into New Zealand.\nThe Conch Republic was founded by local residents of the Florida Keys in 1982 after the United States Border Patrol set up a roadblock and inspection point on one of the only two roads connecting the Florida Keys with the mainland. The Key West City Council complained repeatedly about the inconvenience, claiming that it hurt the Keys' tourism industry. Though the roadblock was soon removed, the claim to sovereignty of the Conch Republic has persisted as a tongue-in-cheek venture meant to bolster tourism.\nIn 1986, the Kingdom of North Dumpling was declared by inventor Dean Kamen after a denial from local officials to build his own wind turbine on North Dumpling Island in Long Island Sound, which Kamen privately owns. Kamen wrote his own constitution and created a flag, currency and national anthem for the micronation. In 1992, despite still being recognised as part of New York State in the United States, Kamen was able to leverage his personal relationship with then-president George H. W. Bush to sign an unofficial non-aggression pact.\nArtistic micronations: 1990s.\nSeveral conceptual art projects with micronational claims arose in the 1990s, usually as a means to challenge the idea of statehood.\nIn 1991, Neue Slowenische Kunst (NSK), a Slovenian political art collective, declared independence. NSK describes itself as a \"State in Time\", claiming no territory in order to be a \"stateless state\". Elgaland-Vargaland is a conceptual art project founded in 1992 by Swedish artists Carl Michael von Hausswolff and Leif Elggren. According to them, everyone who dies is automatically granted citizenship. Among Elgaland-Vargaland's territorial claims include graveyards, people's mental states and \"the distance between high tide and low tide\" of France. They also claim to operate embassies around the world. In 1996, Swedish artist Lars Vilks proclaimed the Royal Republic of Ladonia as a result of a court battle between local authorities over Vilks's illegal construction of two sculptures in the natural reserve of Kullaberg in southern Sweden. Ladonia's claim of independence has since persisted following Vilks's death in 2021, with Carolyn Shelby serving as Queen since 2011. In 1997, the neighbourhood of U\u017eupis in Vilnius, Lithuania declared tongue-in-cheek independence as a republic consisting of laidback artists.\nEffects of the Internet and media attention.\nIn the mid-1990s, the emerging popularity of the World Wide Web made it possible for anyone to create their own virtual state-like entity with relative ease, and many micronations launched their own websites. As a result, micronationalism lost much of its traditionally eccentric anti-establishment sentiment in favour of more hobbyist perspectives, and the number of exclusively online or merely simulation-based micronations expanded dramatically. Several intermicronational organisations were also established, with the League of Secessionist States, originally founded in 1980 by the Kingdom of Talossa, and the United Micronations being at the forefront. The French Institute of Micropatrology () was founded in 1996 by Swiss academic Fabrice O'Driscoll to study this phenomenon. Other online micronational services during the 1990s included MicroWorld, a monthly micronational magazine, and alt.politics.micronations, a Usenet newsgroup dedicated to discussions regarding micronationalism. In 2000, O'Driscoll authored \"\" (They do not sit at the UN: a review of some micro-states, micro-nations and other ephemeral entities), which details over 600 micronations.\nIn 2000, the Republic of Molossia and the erstwhile Kingdom of TorHavn hosted an Intermicronational Olympic Games online to coincide with the 2000 Summer Olympics. Six micronations competed and were asked to record their performances then report it to a Molossian message board. In 2003, the \"First Summit of Micronations\" summit commenced in Helsinki, Finland, coinciding with a performance art festival called Amorph!03. Six micronations were represented. An art exhibition exhibiting various micronational miscellanea, \"We Could Have Invited Everyone\", occurred in 2004 and 2005 at the Reg Vardy Gallery, University of Sunderland, England and Andrew Kreps Gallery, New York City, United States respectively. The items were featured alongside artwork by artists including Yoko Ono and Nina Katchadourian. Both exhibitions coincided with an intermicronational summit. In 2005, the six-part BBC comedy-documentary series \"How to Start Your Own Country\" aired on BBC Two, in which comedian Danny Wallace attempts to create his own country in his apartment in Bow, London. The micronation he created was eventually named the Kingdom of Lovely. The following year, the travel guide company Lonely Planet published a light-hearted guide to numerous micronations titled \"\".\nIn 2007, two self-proclaimed princesses of the Sunda Democratic Empire, sisters Puteri Lamia Roro Wiranata and Puteri Fathia Reza, were detained by Malaysian immigration authorities for attempting to enter from Brunei using diplomatic passports from the Sunda Empire. They claimed to be the princesses of the historical Sunda Kingdom and that their parents were in exile. In early 2008, they were freed by the Sessions Court, but maintained their claim of Sundan citizenship, thus making them ineligible for deportation to Indonesia. The Malaysian authorities subsequently deemed them stateless individuals, and they were interned at an immigration depot under supervision of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.\n2010s.\nIn 2010, the documentary film \"How to Start Your Own Country\", directed by Jody Shapiro, was screened as part of the 35th Toronto International Film Festival. The documentary explored various micronations around the world and included an analysis of the concept of statehood, seasteading and citizenship. The film was inspired by Erwin Strauss' eponymous book. Also that same year, an intermicronational summit, PoliNation 2010, was held at Dangar Island in Sydney, Australia. It was organised by Judy Lattas of Macquarie University, Princess Paula of the Principality of Snake Hill and George Cruickshank of the Empire of Atlantium. Between 2013 and 2014, two Aboriginal Australian nations declared independence from Australia as part of the concept of Australian Aboriginal sovereignty\u2014first the Murrawarri Republic, comprising the Muruwari, in 2013, and the Sovereign Yidindji Government, comprising the Yidindji, in 2014. In both cases, the declarations of independence went wholly unrecognised by the Government of Australia.\nIn 2015, the first convention of the biannual MicroCon was held in Anaheim, California, United States. Hosted by the Republic of Molossia, several presentations were held by micronationalists regarding various topics in micronationalism. The \"Organisation de la microfrancophonie\", a French intermicronational organisation, was founded in 2015. The organisation organised its first summit in 2016, hosted by the Principality of Aigues-Mortes. In 2018, the Principality of Islandia was established by two individuals aiming to build a crowdfunded micronation. Successfully purchasing the uninhabited Coffee Caye in the Caribbean Sea off the coast of Belize in 2019, Prime Minister of Belize John Brice\u00f1o dismissed the project in 2022, calling them \"stupid\" and stating \"We will never allow anybody to have their own country within this country [Belize] - what a stupid thing. If you stupid enough to pay a lot of money to buy [a] piece of land, good for you.\"\n2020s.\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic that began in 2020, several micronations imposed their own restrictions, mimicking countries. Some inactive Internet-based micronations also returned to activity as people were commanded to stay home and quarantine. In 2020, Netflix released the film \"Rose Island\", based on the story of engineer Giorgio Rosa and the Republic of Rose Island. In 2021, academics Harry Hobbs and George Williams published \"Micronations and the Search for Sovereignty\", a book exploring various aspects of micronationalism. It was published by Cambridge University Press. A follow-up book on micronations by Hobbs and Williams, entitled \"\", was published in 2022 by the University of New South Wales Press. Also in 2022, illusionist Uri Geller purchased Lamb, an uninhabited island off the coast of Scotland and declared it independent as the Republic of Lamb. Geller offers citizenship, with proceeds going to Save a Child's Heart, an Israeli charity.\nTerritorial claims.\nWhile most micronations claim land they can administer, often private property, some have made claims to uninhabitable tracts of land. For instance, some micronations have claimed Bir Tawil in Africa and Marie Byrd Land in West Antarctica, lands which are \"terra nullius\"\u2014unclaimed by any other sovereign state. Several others have also made claims to other portions of Antarctica. Examples are the Grand Duchy of Westarctica and Grand Duchy of Flandrensis. However, due to Antarctica's remoteness, no micronation has yet to establish a permanent residence on the continent. On the other hand, at least one micronationalist has physically reached Bir Tawil; in June 2014, Virginian farmer Jeremiah Heaton travelled to the area and proclaimed the Kingdom of North Sudan. Heaton stated that he claimed the territory in order to fulfil a promise to his daughter to make her a princess, however Heaton has appeared to have other motivations, offering several initiatives\u2014such as the implementation of a national currency and the construction of an international airport and capital city\u2014via crowdfunding.\nOther micronational claims have been made to small pockets on the west bank of the Danube between Serbia and Croatia. Some micronationalists argue that the land is \"terra nullius\" because Croatia states the pockets are Serbian, whilst Serbia makes no claims on the land. However, the Croatian Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs has rejected these claims, stating that the differing border claims between Serbia and Croatia do not involve \"terra nullius\" and are not subject to occupation by a third party. The most prominent example is the Free Republic of Liberland, which was proclaimed in April 2015 by Czech right-libertarian politician and activist V\u00edt Jedli\u010dka, and claims the largest pocket, Gornja Siga. The land lacks infrastructure and lies on the floodplain of the Danube.\nOther claims.\nSome micronations have attempted to establish themselves in international waters\u2014parts of the sea that cannot be claimed by any sovereign state\u2014by seasteading. This involves the creation of permanent dwellings at sea. Some micronations are associated with the Seasteading Institute, a non-profit organisation formed to facilitate the establishment of these seasteads.\nThe Space Kingdom of Asgardia, founded in October 2016, claims an artificial satellite that orbited the Earth. Named Asgardia-1, the two-unit CubeSat was successfully launched by Orbital ATK in November 2017 as part of an International Space Station resupply mission. Asgardia-1 reportedly re-entered the atmosphere in September 2022. The Nation of Celestial Space claims all of outer space, whilst the Empire of Angyalistan lays claim to garbage patches around the world's oceans in protest against their existence.\nOther claimed micronations may fit more into a cultural category were territorial claims are not as easily defined such as Aynvaul, what appears to be an Irish-American and Irish language revival micronation based in or around Long Island, New York and the Atlanta, Georgia based Kingdom of Ruritania based on the fictional country of Ruritania from Anthony Hope's Prisoner of Zenda, the latter of which hosted MicroCon 2017 in Atlanta, Georgia.\nFunctions as a sovereign state.\nMicronations function in the same way as sovereign states in that they have their own government, constitution, legislation, and (if a democracy) hold national elections. Micronations often have national symbols such as a flag, coat of arms or seal, motto and anthem, and many micronations also issue coins, banknotes, stamps, passports, passport stamps, orders of merit and bestow honours and titles of nobility, although these are not recognised internationally. Some micronations have made profits by selling these items as souvenirs and memorabilia to tourists and via their national websites, and others have even sold citizenship and titles of nobility. Some micronational coinage and stamps, if professionally made, have become valued as collector's items by numismatists and philatelists (stamp collectors) alike. In addition, both Sealand and Seborga have their own national association football teams. The Sealand national football team was founded in 2004 and became an associate member of the N.F.-Board, a federation made up of unrecognised states, stateless peoples, regions and micronations that are not allowed to join FIFA, in 2006. The Seborga national football team was founded in 2014 and is run by the Football Federation of the Principality of Seborga.\nCommunity.\nDiplomacy.\nLike countries, micronations engage in intermicronational diplomacy with one another. This includes the signing of treaties, non-aggression pacts and intermicronational conventions, diplomatic missions and declarations of war. Several intermicronational organisations also exist, with some having as many as 80 member states. Most of these organisations generally work to maintain peace, strengthen micronational cooperation and to improve diplomatic relations between member states.\nIntermicronational summits.\nIntermicronational summits are also commonplace within the micronational community, and several reoccurring summits have taken place. These include the sporadically-held PoliNation, biennial MicroCon; and the \"Organisation de la microfrancophonie\" has hosted three intermicronational summits between its member states. PoliNation 2010 was held at Dangar Island, Sydney, Australia and was organised by Judy Lattas of Macquarie University, Princess Paula of the Principality of Snake Hill and George Cruickshank of the Empire of Atlantium. PoliNation 2012 was held in London, United Kingdom, and PoliNation 2015 commenced at Umbria, Italy. MicroCon 2015 was held in Anaheim, California and hosted by Molossia; MicroCon 2017 in Tucker, Georgia by the Kingdom of Ruritania; MicroCon 2019 in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, by the Kingdom of Slabovia;, MicroCon 2022 in Las Vegas, Nevada by Westarctica, having been delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic;; MicroCon 2023 in Chicago by Ladonia and MicroCon EU in Ypres in partnership with Flandrensis; MicroCon 2025 was in Montreal, Canada and hosted by the Aerican Empire. The first summit hosted by the \"Microfrancophonie\" was held in 2016 in Aigues-Mortes, Occitania, and hosted by the Principality of Aigues-Mortes; the second summit took place in 2018 in Vincennes, Paris, and was hosted by Angyalistan; the third summit took place in 2022 in Blaye, Nouvelle-Aquitaine, organised by the Principality of H\u00e9lianthis. Since 2022, the Micro Euro Summit has been held regularly as a congress for European micronations.\nWebsites and online communities.\nThere are thousands of micronations which exist and operate solely online. Micronationalists convene and engage with one another through several online platforms, especially social media and historically forums (message boards), where micronationalists can share lessons and ideas as well as gain inspiration for establishing their own micronation. MicroWiki, the largest micronational wiki and encyclopaedia, has thousands of articles on various topics related to micronationalism \"with many country pages [on MicroWiki] longer than those of real nations [on Wikipedia]\", and a number of micronations exist and conduct diplomacy solely on the wiki, utilising it as an online community. As of September 2025, the largest micronational group on Facebook, \"Micronations and Alternative Polities\", had 3,600 members, and the subreddit forum r/micronations on Reddit had another 14,000.\nLegality.\nArguments for sovereignty.\n\"Micronation\" as a word has no basis in international law. Despite this, several micronations have attempted to justify their claims to sovereignty by citing loopholes in local laws. A commonly attempted tactic used by micronationalists to legitimise their claims is the declarative theory of statehood as defined by the Montevideo Convention, which defines a \"state\" as: \"a person of international law [that] possess the following qualifications: (a) a permanent population; (b) a defined territory; (c) government; and (d) capacity to enter into relations with the other states.\"\nIn 2019, a couple seasteading off the coast of Thailand went into hiding after being accused by the Royal Thai Navy of violating Thailand's sovereignty. If found guilty, they could face life in prison or the death penalty. As of 2020, they relocated to Panama.\nBased on historical claims.\nSome micronations are founded on the basis of historical anomalies. The Principality of Seborga was founded in 1963 by Giorgio Carbone, who claimed to have found documents from the Vatican archives which, according to Carbone, indicated that Seborga had never been a possession of the House of Savoy and was thus not legally included in the Kingdom of Italy when it was formed in 1861, meaning that Seborga had remained sovereign. The Romanov Empire, created by chairman of the Monarchist Party of Russia Anton Bakov, claims to be a re-creation of the Russian Empire that holds Prince Karl Emich of Leiningen as the rightful heir to the imperial throne.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Mining is required to obtain most materials that cannot be grown through agricultural processes, or feasibly created artificially in a laboratory or factory. Ores recovered by mining include metals, coal, oil shale, gemstones, limestone, chalk, dimension stone, rock salt, potash, gravel, and clay. The ore must be a rock or mineral that contains a valuable constituent, can be extracted or mined and sold for profit. Mining in a wider sense includes extraction of any non-renewable resource such as petroleum, natural gas, or even water.\nModern mining processes involve prospecting for ore bodies, analysis of the profit potential of a proposed mine, extraction of the desired materials, and final reclamation or restoration of the land after the mine is closed. Mining materials are often obtained from ore bodies, lodes, veins, seams, reefs, or placer deposits. The exploitation of these deposits for raw materials is dependent on investment, labor, energy, refining, and transportation cost.\nMining operations can create a negative environmental impact, both during the mining activity and after the mine has closed. Hence, most of the world's nations have passed regulations to decrease the impact; however, the outsized role of mining in generating business for often rural, remote or economically depressed communities means that governments often fail to fully enforce such regulations. Work safety has long been a concern as well, and where enforced, modern practices have significantly improved safety in mines. Unregulated, poorly regulated or illegal mining, especially in developing economies, frequently contributes to local human rights violations and environmental conflicts. Mining can also perpetuate political instability through resource conflicts.\nHistory.\nPrehistory.\nSince the beginning of civilization, people have used stone, clay and, later, metals found close to the Earth's surface. These were used to make early tools and weapons; for example, high quality flint found in northern France, southern England and Poland was used to create flint tools. Flint mines have been found in chalk areas where seams of the stone were followed underground by shafts and galleries. The mines at Grimes Graves and Krzemionki are especially famous, and like most other flint mines, are Neolithic in origin (c. 4000\u20133000 BC). Other hard rocks mined or collected for axes included the greenstone of the Langdale axe industry based in the English Lake District.\nThe oldest-known mine on archaeological record is the Ngwenya Mine in Eswatini (Swaziland), which radiocarbon dating shows to be about 43,000 years old. At this site Paleolithic humans mined hematite to make the red pigment ochre. Mines of a similar age in Hungary are believed to be sites where Neanderthals may have mined flint for weapons and tools.\nAncient Egypt.\nAncient Egyptians mined malachite at Maadi. At first, Egyptians used the bright green malachite stones for ornamentations and pottery. Later, between 2613 and 2494 BC, large building projects required expeditions abroad to the area of Wadi Maghareh in order to secure minerals and other resources not available in Egypt itself. Quarries for turquoise and copper were also found at Wadi Hammamat, Tura, Aswan and various other Nubian sites, on the Sinai Peninsula, and at Timna. Quarries for gypsum were found at the Umm el-Sawwan site; gypsum was used to make funerary items for private tombs. Other minerals mined in Egypt from the Old Kingdom (2649-2134 BC) until the Roman Period (30 BC-AD 395) including granite, sandstone, limestone, basalt, travertine, gneiss, galena, and amethyst.\nMining in Egypt occurred in the earliest dynasties. The gold mines of Nubia were among the largest and most extensive of any in Ancient Egypt. These mines are described by the Greek author Diodorus Siculus, who mentions fire-setting as one method used to break down the hard rock holding the gold. One of the complexes is shown in one of the earliest known mining maps. The miners crushed the ore and ground it to a fine powder before washing the powder for the gold dust known as the dry and wet attachment processes.\nAncient Greece and Rome.\nMining in Europe has a very long history. Examples include the silver mines of Laurium, which helped support the Greek city state of Athens. Although they had over 20,000 slaves working them, their technology was essentially identical to their Bronze Age predecessors. At other mines, such as on the island of Thassos, marble was quarried by the Parians after they arrived in the 7th century BC. The marble was shipped away and was later found by archaeologists to have been used in buildings including the tomb of Amphipolis. Philip II of Macedon, the father of Alexander the Great, captured the gold mines of Mount Pangeo in 357 BC to fund his military campaigns. He also captured gold mines in Thrace for minting coinage, eventually producing 26 tons per year.\nHowever, it was the Romans who developed large-scale mining methods, especially the use of large volumes of water brought to the minehead by numerous aqueducts. The water was used for a variety of purposes, including removing overburden and rock debris, called hydraulic mining, as well as washing comminuted, or crushed, ores and driving simple machinery.\nThe Romans used hydraulic mining methods on a large scale to prospect for the veins of ore, especially using a now-obsolete form of mining known as hushing. They built numerous aqueducts to supply water to the minehead, where the water was stored in large reservoirs and tanks. When a full tank was opened, the flood of water sluiced away the overburden to expose the bedrock underneath and any gold-bearing veins. The rock was then worked by fire-setting to heat the rock, which would be quenched with a stream of water. The resulting thermal shock cracked the rock, enabling it to be removed by further streams of water from the overhead tanks. The Roman miners used similar methods to work cassiterite deposits in Cornwall and lead ore in the Pennines.\nSluicing methods were developed by the Romans in Spain in 25 AD to exploit large alluvial gold deposits, the largest site being at Las Medulas, where seven long aqueducts tapped local rivers and sluiced the deposits. The Romans also exploited the silver present in the argentiferous galena in the mines of Cartagena (\"Cartago Nova\"), Linares (\"Castulo\"), Plasenzuela and Azuaga, among many others. Spain was one of the most important mining regions, but all regions of the Roman Empire were exploited. In Great Britain the natives had mined minerals for millennia, but after the Roman conquest, the scale of the operations increased dramatically, as the Romans needed Britannia's resources, especially gold, silver, tin, and lead.\nRoman techniques were not limited to surface mining. They followed the ore veins underground once opencast mining was no longer feasible. At Dolaucothi they stoped out the veins and drove adits through bare rock to drain the stopes. The same adits were also used to ventilate the workings, especially important when fire-setting was used. At other parts of the site, they penetrated the water table and dewatered the mines using several kinds of machines, especially reverse overshot water-wheels. These were used extensively in the copper mines at Rio Tinto in Spain, where one sequence comprised 16 such wheels arranged in pairs, and lifting water about . They were worked as treadmills with miners standing on the top slats. Many examples of such devices have been found in old Roman mines and some examples are now preserved in the British Museum and the National Museum of Wales.\nMedieval Europe.\nMining as an industry underwent dramatic changes in medieval Europe. The mining industry in the early Middle Ages was mainly focused on the extraction of copper and iron. Other precious metals were also used, mainly for gilding or coinage. Initially, many metals were obtained through open-pit mining, and ore was primarily extracted from shallow depths, rather than through deep mine shafts. Around the 14th century, the growing use of weapons, armour, stirrups, and horseshoes greatly increased the demand for iron. Medieval knights, for example, were often laden with up to of plate or chain link armour in addition to swords, lances and other weapons. The overwhelming dependency on iron for military purposes spurred iron production and extraction processes.\nThe silver crisis of 1465 occurred when all mines had reached depths at which the shafts could no longer be pumped dry with the available technology. Although an increased use of banknotes, credit and copper coins during this period did decrease the value of, and dependence on, precious metals, gold and silver still remained vital to the story of medieval mining.\nDue to differences in the social structure of society, the increasing extraction of mineral deposits spread from central Europe to England in the mid-sixteenth century. On the continent, mineral deposits belonged to the crown, and this regalian right was stoutly maintained. But in England, royal mining rights were restricted to gold and silver (of which England had virtually no deposits) by a judicial decision of 1568 and a law in 1688. England had iron, zinc, copper, lead, and tin ores. Landlords who owned the base metals and coal under their estates then had a strong inducement to extract these metals or to lease the deposits and collect royalties from mine operators. English, German, and Dutch capital combined to finance extraction and refining. Hundreds of German technicians and skilled workers were brought over; in 1642 a colony of 4,000 foreigners was mining and smelting copper at Keswick in the northwestern mountains.\nUse of water power in the form of water mills was extensive. The water mills were employed in crushing ore, raising ore from shafts, and ventilating galleries by powering giant bellows. Black powder was first used in mining in Selmecb\u00e1nya, Kingdom of Hungary (now Bansk\u00e1 \u0160tiavnica, Slovakia) in 1627. Black powder allowed blasting of rock and earth to loosen and reveal ore veins. Blasting was much faster than fire-setting and allowed the mining of previously impenetrable metals and ores. In 1762, one of the world's first mining academies was established in the same town there.\nThe widespread adoption of agricultural innovations such as the iron plowshare, as well as the growing use of metal as a building material, was also a driving force in the tremendous growth of the iron industry during this period. Inventions like the arrastra were often used by the Spanish to pulverize ore after being mined. This device was powered by animals and used the same principles used for grain threshing.\nMuch of the knowledge of medieval mining techniques comes from books such as Biringuccio's \"De la pirotechnia\" and probably most importantly from Georg Agricola's \"De re metallica\" (1556). These books detail many different mining methods used in German and Saxon mines. A prime issue in medieval mines, which Agricola explains in detail, was the removal of water from mining shafts. As miners dug deeper to access new veins, flooding became a very real obstacle. The mining industry became dramatically more efficient and prosperous with the invention of mechanically- and animal-driven pumps.\nAfrica.\nIron metallurgy in Africa dates back over four thousand years. Gold became an important commodity for Africa during the trans-Saharan gold trade from the 7th century to the 14th century. Gold was often traded to Mediterranean economies that demanded gold and could supply salt, even though much of Africa was abundant with salt due to the mines and resources in the Sahara desert. The trading of gold for salt was mostly used to promote trade between the different economies. Since the Great Trek in the 19th century, after, gold and diamond mining in Southern Africa has had major political and economic impacts. The Democratic Republic of Congo is the largest producer of diamonds in Africa, with an estimated 12 million carats in 2019. Other types of mining reserves in Africa include cobalt, bauxite, iron ore, coal, and copper.\nOceania.\nGold and coal mining started in Australia and New Zealand in the 19th century. Nickel has become important in the economy of New Caledonia.\nIn Fiji, in 1934, the Emperor Gold Mining Company Ltd. established operations at Vatukoula, followed in 1935 by the Loloma Gold Mines, N.L., and then by Fiji Mines Development Ltd. (aka Dolphin Mines Ltd.). These developments ushered in a \"mining boom\", with gold production rising more than a hundred-fold, from 931.4 oz in 1934 to 107,788.5 oz in 1939, an order of magnitude then comparable to the combined output of New Zealand and Australia's eastern states.\nAmericas.\nDuring prehistoric times, early Americans mined large amounts of copper along Lake Superior's Keweenaw Peninsula and in nearby Isle Royale; metallic copper was still present near the surface in colonial times. Indigenous peoples used Lake Superior copper from at least 5,000 years ago; copper tools, arrowheads, and other artifacts that were part of an extensive native trade-network have been discovered. In addition, obsidian, flint, and other minerals were mined, worked, and traded. Early French explorers who encountered the sites made no use of the metals due to the difficulties of transporting them, but the copper was eventually traded throughout the continent along major river routes. \nIn the early colonial history of the Americas, \"native gold and silver was quickly expropriated and sent back to Spain in fleets of gold- and silver-laden galleons\", the gold and silver originating mostly from mines in Central and South America. Turquoise dated at 700 AD was mined in pre-Columbian America; in the Cerillos Mining District in New Mexico, an estimate of \"about 15,000 tons of rock had been removed from Mt. Chalchihuitl using stone tools before 1700.\"\nIn 1727 Louis Denys (Denis) (1675\u20131741), sieur de La Ronde \u2013 brother of Simon-Pierre Denys de Bonaventure and the son-in-law of Ren\u00e9 Chartier \u2013 took command of Fort La Pointe at Chequamegon Bay; where natives informed him of an island of copper. La Ronde obtained permission from the French crown to operate mines in 1733, becoming \"the first practical miner on Lake Superior\"; seven years later, mining was halted by an outbreak between Sioux and Chippewa tribes.\nMining in the United States became widespread in the 19th century, and the United States Congress passed the General Mining Act of 1872 to encourage mining of federal lands. As with the California Gold Rush in the mid-19th century, mining for minerals and precious metals, along with ranching, became a driving factor in the U.S. Westward Expansion to the Pacific coast. With the exploration of the West, mining camps sprang up and \"expressed a distinctive spirit, an enduring legacy to the new nation\"; Gold Rushers would experience the same problems as the Land Rushers of the transient West that preceded them. Aided by railroads, many people traveled West for work opportunities in mining. Western cities such as Denver and Sacramento originated as mining towns.\nWhen new areas were explored, it was usually the gold (placer and then lode) and then silver that were taken into possession and extracted first. Other metals would often wait for railroads or canals, as coarse gold dust and nuggets do not require smelting and are easy to identify and transport.\nModernity.\n In the early 20th century, the gold and silver rush to the western United States also stimulated mining for coal as well as base metals such as copper, lead, and iron. Areas in modern Montana, Utah, Arizona, and later Alaska became predominant suppliers of copper to the world, which was increasingly demanding copper for electrical and household goods. Canada's mining industry grew more slowly than did the United States due to limitations in transportation, capital, and U.S. competition; Ontario was the major producer of the early 20th century with nickel, copper, and gold.\nMeanwhile, Australia experienced the Australian gold rushes and by the 1850s was producing 40% of the world's gold, followed by the establishment of large mines such as the Mount Morgan Mine, which ran for nearly a hundred years, Broken Hill ore deposit (one of the largest zinc-lead ore deposits), and the iron ore mines at Iron Knob. After declines in production, another boom in mining occurred in the 1960s. In the early 21st century, Australia remains a major world mineral producer.\nAs the 21st century begins, a globalized mining industry of large multinational corporations has arisen. Peak minerals and environmental impacts have also become a concern. Different elements, particularly rare-earth minerals, have begun to increase in demand as a result of new technologies.\nIn 2023, 8.5 billion metric tons of coal were extracted from the Earth's crust. However, as the global economy transitions away from fossil fuels and toward a more sustainable future, the demand for metals is set to skyrocket. Between 2022 and 2050, an estimated 7 billion metric tons of metals will need to be extracted. Steel will account for the largest portion of this total at 5 billion tons, followed by aluminum at 950 million tons, copper at 650 million tons, graphite at 170 million tons, nickel at 100 million tons, and other metals. Notably, the energy expenditure required to extract these metals will soon surpass that of coal mining, highlighting the growing importance of sustainable metal extraction practices.\nMine development and life cycle.\nThe process of mining from discovery of an ore body through extraction of minerals and finally to returning the land to its natural state consists of several distinct steps. The first is discovery of the ore body, which is carried out through prospecting or exploration to find and then define the extent, location and value of the ore body. This leads to a mathematical resource estimation to estimate the size and grade of the deposit.\nThis estimation is used to conduct a pre-feasibility study to determine the theoretical economics of the ore deposit. This identifies, early on, whether further investment in estimation and engineering studies is warranted and identifies key risks and areas for further work. The next step is to conduct a feasibility study to evaluate the financial viability, the technical and financial risks, and the robustness of the project.\nThis is when the mining company makes the decision whether to develop the mine or to walk away from the project. This includes mine planning to evaluate the economically recoverable portion of the deposit, the metallurgy and ore recoverability, marketability and payability of the ore concentrates, engineering concerns, milling and infrastructure costs, finance and equity requirements, and an analysis of the proposed mine from the initial excavation all the way through to reclamation. The proportion of a deposit that is economically recoverable is dependent on the enrichment factor of the ore in the area.\nTo gain access to the mineral deposit within an area it is often necessary to mine through or remove waste material which is not of immediate interest to the miner. The total movement of ore and waste constitutes the mining process. Often more waste than ore is mined during the life of a mine, depending on the nature and location of the ore body. Waste removal and placement is a major cost to the mining operator, so a detailed characterization of the waste material forms an essential part of the geological exploration program for a mining operation.\nOnce the analysis determines a given ore body is worth recovering, development begins to create access to the ore body. The mine buildings and processing plants are built, and any necessary equipment is obtained. The operation of the mine to recover the ore begins and continues as long as the company operating the mine finds it economical to do so. Once all the ore that the mine can produce profitably is recovered, reclamation can begin, to make the land used by the mine suitable for future use.\nTechnical and economic challenges notwithstanding, successful mine development must also address human factors. Working conditions are paramount to success, especially with regard to exposures to dusts, radiation, noise, explosives hazards, and vibration, as well as illumination standards. Mining today increasingly must address environmental and community impacts, including psychological and sociological dimensions. Thus, mining educator Frank T. M. White (1909\u20131971), broadened the focus to the \"total environment of mining\", including reference to community development around mining, and how mining is portrayed to an urban society, which depends on the industry, although seemingly unaware of this dependency. He stated, \"[I]n the past, mining engineers have not been called upon to study the psychological, sociological and personal problems of their own industry \u2013 aspects that nowadays are assuming tremendous importance. The mining engineer must rapidly expand his knowledge and his influence into these newer fields.\"\nTechniques.\nMining techniques can be divided into two common excavation types: surface mining and sub-surface (underground) mining. Today, surface mining is much more common, and produces, for example, 85% of minerals (excluding petroleum and natural gas) in the United States, including 98% of metallic ores.\nTargets are divided into two general categories of materials: \"placer deposits\", consisting of valuable minerals contained within river gravels, beach sands, and other unconsolidated materials; and \"lode deposits\", where valuable minerals are found in veins, in layers, or in mineral grains generally distributed throughout a mass of actual rock. Both types of ore deposit, placer or lode, are mined by both surface and underground methods.\nSome mining, including much of the rare earth elements and uranium mining, is done by less-common methods, such as in-situ leaching: this technique involves digging neither at the surface nor underground. The extraction of target minerals by this technique requires that they be soluble, e.g., potash, potassium chloride, sodium chloride, sodium sulfate, which dissolve in water. Some minerals, such as copper minerals and uranium oxide, require acid or carbonate solutions to dissolve.\nExplosives in mining.\nExplosives have been used in surface mining and sub-surface mining to blast out rock and ore intended for processing. The most common explosive used in mining is ammonium nitrate. Between 1870 and 1920, in Queensland Australia, an increase in mining accidents lead to more safety measures surrounding the use of explosives for mining. In the United States of America, between 1990 and 1999, about 22.3 billion kilograms of explosives were used in mining quarrying and other industries; Moreover \"coal mining used 66.4%, nonmetal mining and quarrying 13.5%, metal mining 10.4%, construction 7.1%, and all other users 2.6%\".\nSurface.\nSurface mining is done by removing surface vegetation, dirt, and bedrock to reach buried ore deposits. Techniques of surface mining include: open-pit mining, which is the recovery of materials from an open pit in the ground; quarrying, identical to open-pit mining except that it refers to sand, stone and clay; strip mining, which consists of stripping surface layers off to reveal ore underneath; and mountaintop removal, commonly associated with coal mining, which involves taking the top of a mountain off to reach ore deposits at depth. Most placer deposits, because they are shallowly buried, are mined by surface methods. Finally, landfill mining involves sites where landfills are excavated and processed. Landfill mining has been thought of as a long-term solution to methane emissions and local pollution.\nHigh wall.\nHigh wall mining, which evolved from auger mining, is another form of surface mining. In high wall mining, the remaining part of a coal seam previously exploited by other surface-mining techniques has too much overburden to be removed but can still be profitably exploited from the side of the artificial cliff made by previous mining. A typical cycle alternates sumping, which undercuts the seam, and shearing, which raises and lowers the cutter-head boom to cut the entire height of the coal seam. As the coal recovery cycle continues, the cutter-head is progressively launched further into the coal seam. High wall mining can produce thousands of tons of coal in contour-strip operations with narrow benches, previously mined areas, trench mine applications and steep-dip seams.\nUnderground mining.\nSub-surface mining consists of digging tunnels or shafts into the earth to reach buried ore deposits. Ore, for processing, and waste rock, for disposal, are brought to the surface through the tunnels and shafts. Sub-surface mining can be classified by the type of access shafts used, and the extraction method or the technique used to reach the mineral deposit. Drift mining uses horizontal access tunnels, slope mining uses diagonally sloping access shafts, and shaft mining uses vertical access shafts. Mining in hard and soft rock formations requires different techniques.\nOther methods include shrinkage stope mining, which is mining upward, creating a sloping underground room, long wall mining, which is grinding a long ore surface underground, and room and pillar mining, which is removing ore from rooms while leaving pillars in place to support the roof of the room. Room and pillar mining often leads to retreat mining, in which supporting pillars are removed as miners retreat, allowing the room to cave in, thereby loosening more ore. Additional sub-surface mining methods include hard rock mining, bore hole mining, drift and fill mining, long hole slope mining, sub level caving, and block caving.\nMachines.\nHeavy machinery is used in mining to explore and develop sites, to remove and stockpile overburden, to break and remove rocks of various hardness and toughness, to process the ore, and to carry out reclamation projects after the mine is closed. Bulldozers, drills, explosives and trucks are all necessary for excavating the land. In the case of placer mining, unconsolidated gravel, or alluvium, is fed into machinery consisting of a hopper and a shaking screen or trommel which frees the desired minerals from the waste gravel. The minerals are then concentrated using sluices or jigs.\nLarge drills are used to sink shafts, excavate stopes, and obtain samples for analysis. Trams are used to transport miners, minerals and waste. Lifts carry miners into and out of mines, and move rock and ore out, and machinery in and out, of underground mines. Huge trucks, shovels and cranes are employed in surface mining to move large quantities of overburden and ore. Processing plants use large crushers, mills, reactors, roasters and other equipment to consolidate the mineral-rich material and extract the desired compounds and metals from the ore.\nProcessing.\nOnce the mineral is extracted, it is often then processed. The science of extractive metallurgy is a specialized area in the science of metallurgy that studies the extraction of valuable metals from their ores, especially through chemical or mechanical means.\nMineral processing (or mineral dressing) is a specialized area in the science of metallurgy that studies the mechanical means of crushing, grinding, and washing that enable the separation (extractive metallurgy) of valuable metals or minerals from their gangue (waste material). Processing of placer ore material consists of gravity-dependent methods of separation, such as Sluice boxes. Only minor shaking or washing may be necessary to disaggregate (unclump) the sands or gravels before processing. Processing of ore from a lode mine, whether it is a surface or subsurface mine, requires that the rock ore be crushed and pulverized before extraction of the valuable minerals begins. After lode ore is crushed, recovery of the valuable minerals is done by one, or a combination of several, mechanical and chemical techniques.\nSince most metals are present in ores as oxides or sulfides, the metal needs to be reduced to its metallic form. This can be accomplished through chemical means such as smelting or through electrolytic reduction, as in the case of aluminium. Geometallurgy combines the geologic sciences with extractive metallurgy and mining.\nIn 2018, led by Chemistry and Biochemistry professor Bradley D. Smith, University of Notre Dame researchers \"invented a new class of molecules whose shape and size enable them to capture and contain precious metal ions,\" reported in a study published by the Journal of the American Chemical Society. The new method \"converts gold-containing ore into chloroauric acid and extracts it using an industrial solvent. The container molecules are able to selectively separate the gold from the solvent without the use of water stripping.\" The newly developed molecules can eliminate water stripping, whereas mining traditionally \"relies on a 125-year-old method that treats gold-containing ore with large quantities of poisonous sodium cyanide... this new process has a milder environmental impact and that, besides gold, it can be used for capturing other metals such as platinum and palladium,\" and could also be used in urban mining processes that remove precious metals from wastewater streams.\nIndustry.\nMining exists in many countries. London is the headquarters of Anglo American. Melbourne is the headquarters of the worlds two largest mining companies BHP and Rio Tinto. The US mining industry is also large, but it is dominated by extraction of coal and other nonmetal minerals (e.g., rock and sand), and various regulations have worked to reduce the significance of mining in the United States. In 2007, the total market capitalization of mining companies was reported at US$962\u00a0billion, which compares to a total global market cap of publicly traded companies of about US$50\u00a0trillion in 2007. In 2002, Chile and Peru were reportedly the major mining countries of South America. The mineral industry of Africa includes the mining of various minerals; it produces relatively little of the industrial metals copper, lead, and zinc, but according to one estimate has as a percent of world reserves 40% of gold, 60% of cobalt, and 90% of the world's platinum group metals. Mining in India is a significant part of that country's economy. In the developed world, mining in Australia, with BHP founded and headquartered in the country, and mining in Canada are particularly significant. For rare earth minerals mining, China reportedly controlled 95% of production in 2013.\nWhile exploration and mining can be conducted by individual entrepreneurs or small businesses, most modern-day mines are large enterprises requiring large amounts of capital to establish. Consequently, the mining sector of the industry is dominated by large, often multinational, companies, most of them publicly listed. It can be argued that what is referred to as the 'mining industry' is actually two sectors, one specializing in exploration for new resources and the other in mining those resources. The exploration sector is typically made up of individuals and small mineral resource companies, called \"juniors\", which are dependent on venture capital. The mining sector is made up of large multinational companies that are sustained by production from their mining operations. Various other industries such as equipment manufacture, environmental testing, and metallurgy analysis rely on, and support, the mining industry throughout the world. Canadian stock exchanges have a particular focus on mining companies, particularly junior exploration companies through Toronto's TSX Venture Exchange; Canadian companies raise capital on these exchanges and then invest the money in exploration globally. Some have argued that below juniors there exists a substantial sector of illegitimate companies primarily focused on manipulating stock prices.\nMining operations can be grouped into five major categories in terms of their respective resources. These are oil and gas extraction, coal mining, metal ore mining, nonmetallic mineral mining and quarrying, and mining support activities. Of all of these categories, oil and gas extraction remains one of the largest in terms of its global economic importance. Prospecting potential mining sites, a vital area of concern for the mining industry, is now done using sophisticated new technologies such as seismic prospecting and remote-sensing satellites. Mining is heavily affected by the prices of the commodity minerals, which are often volatile. The 2000s commodities boom (\"commodities supercycle\") increased the prices of commodities, driving aggressive mining. In addition, the price of gold increased dramatically in the 2000s, which increased gold mining; for example, one study found that conversion of forest in the Amazon increased six-fold from the period 2003\u20132006 (292 ha/yr) to the period 2006\u20132009 (1,915 ha/yr), largely due to artisanal mining.\nCorporate classifications.\nMining companies can be classified based on their size and financial capabilities:\nRe their valuation, and stock market characteristics, see .\nRegulation and governance.\nNew regulations and a process of legislative reforms aim to improve the harmonization and stability of the mining sector in mineral-rich countries. New legislation for mining industry in African countries still appears to be an issue, but has the potential to be solved, when a consensus is reached on the best approach. By the beginning of the 21st century, the booming and increasingly complex mining sector in mineral-rich countries was providing only slight benefits to local communities, especially in given the sustainability issues. Increasing debate and influence by NGOs and local communities called for new approaches which would also include disadvantaged communities, and work towards sustainable development even after mine closure (including transparency and revenue management). By the early 2000s, community development issues and resettlements became mainstream concerns in World Bank mining projects. Mining-industry expansion after mineral prices increased in 2003 and also potential fiscal revenues in those countries created an omission in the other economic sectors in terms of finances and development. Furthermore, this highlighted regional and local demand for mining revenues and an inability of sub-national governments to effectively use the revenues. The Fraser Institute (a Canadian think tank) has highlighted the environmental protection laws in developing countries, as well as voluntary efforts by mining companies to improve their environmental impact.\nIn 2007, the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) was mainstreamed in all countries cooperating with the World Bank in mining industry reform. The EITI operates and was implemented with the support of the EITI multi-donor trust fund, managed by the World Bank. The EITI aims to increase transparency in transactions between governments and companies in extractive industries by monitoring the revenues and benefits between industries and recipient governments. The entrance process is voluntary for each country and is monitored by multiple stakeholders including governments, private companies and civil society representatives, responsible for disclosure and dissemination of the reconciliation report; however, the competitive disadvantage of company-by-company public report is for some of the businesses in Ghana at least, the main constraint. Therefore, the outcome assessment in terms of failure or success of the new EITI regulation does not only \"rest on the government's shoulders\" but also on civil society and companies.\nHowever, implementation has issues; inclusion or exclusion of artisanal mining and small-scale mining (ASM) from the EITI and how to deal with \"non-cash\" payments made by companies to subnational governments. Furthermore, the disproportionate revenues the mining industry can bring to the comparatively small number of people that it employs, causes other problems, like a lack of investment in other less lucrative sectors, leading to swings in government revenue because of volatility in the oil markets. Artisanal mining is clearly an issue in EITI Countries such as the Central African Republic, D.R. Congo, Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone \u2013 i.e. almost half of the mining countries implementing the EITI. Among other things, limited scope of the EITI involving disparity in terms of knowledge of the industry and negotiation skills, thus far flexibility of the policy (e.g. liberty of the countries to expand beyond the minimum requirements and adapt it to their needs), creates another risk of unsuccessful implementation. Public awareness increase, where government should act as a bridge between public and initiative for a successful outcome of the policy is an important element to be considered.\nWorld Bank.\nThe World Bank has been involved in mining since 1955, mainly through grants from its International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, with the Bank's Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency offering political risk insurance. Between 1955 and 1990 it provided about $2\u00a0billion to fifty mining projects, broadly categorized as reform and rehabilitation, greenfield mine construction, mineral processing, technical assistance, and engineering. These projects have been criticized, particularly the Ferro Carajas project of Brazil, begun in 1981. The World Bank established mining codes intended to increase foreign investment; in 1988, it solicited feedback from 45 mining companies on how to increase their involvement.\nIn 1992, the World Bank began to push for privatization of government-owned mining companies with a new set of codes, beginning with its report \"The Strategy for African Mining\". In 1997, Latin America's largest miner Companhia Vale do Rio Doce (CVRD) was privatized. These and other developments, such as the Philippines 1995 Mining Act, led the bank to publish a third report (\"Assistance for Minerals Sector Development and Reform in Member Countries\") which endorsed mandatory environment impact assessments and attention to the concerns of the local population. The codes based on this report are influential in the legislation of developing nations. The new codes are intended to encourage development through tax holidays, zero custom duties, reduced income taxes, and related measures. The results of these codes were analyzed by a group from the University of Quebec, which concluded that the codes promote foreign investment but \"fall very short of permitting sustainable development\". The observed negative correlation between natural resources and economic development is known as the resource curse.\nSafety.\nSafety has long been a concern in the mining business, especially in sub-surface mining. The Courri\u00e8res mine disaster, Europe's worst mining accident, involved the death of 1,099 miners in Northern France on March 10, 1906. This disaster was surpassed only by the Benxihu Colliery accident in China on April 26, 1942, which killed 1,549 miners. While mining today is substantially safer than it was in previous decades, mining accidents still occur. Government figures indicate that 5,000 Chinese miners die in accidents each year, while other reports have suggested a figure as high as 20,000. Between 1870 and 1920, in Queensland Australia, an increase in mining accidents lead to more safety measures surrounding the use of explosives for mining. Mining accidents continue worldwide, including accidents causing dozens of fatalities at a time such as the 2007 Ulyanovskaya Mine disaster in Russia, the 2009 Heilongjiang mine explosion in China, and the 2010 Upper Big Branch Mine disaster in the United States. Mining has been identified by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) as a priority industry sector in the National Occupational Research Agenda (NORA) to identify and provide intervention strategies regarding occupational health and safety issues. The Mining Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) was established in 1978 to \"work to prevent death, illness, and injury from mining and promote safe and healthful workplaces for US miners.\" Since its implementation in 1978, the number of miner fatalities has decreased from 242 miners in 1978 to 24 miners in 2019.\nThere are numerous occupational hazards associated with mining, including exposure to rockdust which can lead to diseases such as silicosis, asbestosis, and pneumoconiosis. Gases in the mine can lead to asphyxiation and could also be ignited. Mining equipment can generate considerable noise, putting workers at risk for hearing loss. Cave-ins, rock falls, and exposure to excess heat are also known hazards. The current NIOSH Recommended Exposure Limit (REL) of noise is 85 dBA with a 3 dBA exchange rate and the MSHA Permissible Exposure Limit (PEL) is 90 dBA with a 5 dBA exchange rate as an 8-hour time-weighted average. NIOSH has found that 25% of noise-exposed workers in Mining, Quarrying, and Oil and Gas Extraction have hearing impairment. The prevalence of hearing loss increased by 1% from 1991 to 2001 within these workers.\nNoise studies have been conducted in several mining environments. Stageloaders (84-102 dBA), shearers (85-99 dBA), auxiliary fans (84\u2013120 dBA), continuous mining machines (78\u2013109 dBA), and roof bolters (92\u2013103 dBA) represent some of the noisiest equipment in underground coal mines. Dragline oilers, dozer operators, and welders using air arcing were occupations with the highest noise exposures among surface coal miners. Coal mines had the highest hearing loss injury likelihood.\nEnvironmental effects.\nEnvironmental regulation.\nCountries with strongly enforced mining regulations commonly require environmental impact assessment, development of environmental management plans, and mine closure planning prior beginning mine operations. Environmental monitoring during operation and after closure may also be required. Government regulations may not be well enforced, especially in the developing world.\nFor major mining companies and any company seeking international financing, there are a number of other mechanisms to enforce environmental standards. These generally relate to financing standards such as the Equator Principles, IFC environmental standards, and criteria for Socially responsible investing. Mining companies have used this oversight from the financial sector to argue for some level of industry self-regulation. In 1992, a Draft Code of Conduct for Transnational Corporations was proposed at the Rio Earth Summit by the UN Centre for Transnational Corporations (UNCTC), but the Business Council for Sustainable Development (BCSD) together with the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) argued successfully for self-regulation instead.\nThis was followed by the Global Mining Initiative which was begun by nine of the largest metals and mining companies and which led to the formation of the International Council on Mining and Metals, whose purpose was to \"act as a catalyst\" in an effort to improve social and environmental performance in the mining and metals industry internationally. The mining industry has provided funding to various conservation groups, some of which have been working with conservation agendas that are at odds with an emerging acceptance of the rights of indigenous people \u2013 particularly the right to make land-use decisions.\nCertification of mines with good practices occurs through the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). For example, ISO 9000 and ISO 14001, which certify an \"auditable environmental management system\", involve short inspections, although they have been accused of lacking rigor. Certification is also available through Ceres' Global Reporting Initiative, but these reports are voluntary and unverified. Miscellaneous other certification programs exist for various projects, typically through nonprofit groups.\nThe purpose of a 2012 EPS PEAKS paper was to provide evidence on policies managing ecological costs and maximize socio-economic benefits of mining using host country regulatory initiatives. It found existing literature suggesting donors encourage developing countries to:\nWaste.\nOre mills generate large amounts of waste, called tailings. For example, 99 tons of waste is generated per ton of copper, with even higher ratios in gold mining \u2013 because only 5.3 g of gold is extracted per ton of ore, a ton of gold produces 200,000 tons of tailings. (As time goes on and richer deposits are exhausted \u2013 and technology improves \u2013 this number is going down to .5 g and less.) These tailings can be toxic. Tailings, which are usually produced as a slurry, are most commonly dumped into ponds made from naturally existing valleys. These ponds are secured by impoundments (dams or embankment dams). In 2000 it was estimated that 3,500 tailings impoundments existed, and that every year, 2 to 5 major failures and 35 minor failures occurred. For example, in the Marcopper mining disaster at least 2 million tons of tailings were released into a local river. In 2015, Barrick Gold Corporation spilled over 1 million liters of cyanide into a total of five rivers in Argentina near their Veladero mine. Since 2007 in central Finland, the Talvivaara Terrafame polymetal mine's waste effluent and leaks of saline mine water have resulted in ecological collapse of a nearby lake. Subaqueous tailings disposal is another option. The mining industry has argued that submarine tailings disposal (STD), which disposes of tailings in the sea, is ideal because it avoids the risks of tailings ponds. The practice is illegal in the United States and Canada, but it is used in the developing world.\nThe waste is classified as either sterile or mineralized, with acid generating potential, and the movement and storage of this material form a major part of the mine planning process. When the mineralised package is determined by an economic cut-off, the near-grade mineralised waste is usually dumped separately with view to later treatment should market conditions change and it becomes economically viable. Civil engineering design parameters are used in the design of the waste dumps, and special conditions apply to high-rainfall areas and to seismically active areas. Waste dump designs must meet all regulatory requirements of the country in whose jurisdiction the mine is located. It is also common practice to rehabilitate dumps to an internationally acceptable standard, which in some cases means that higher standards than the local regulatory standard are applied.\nHuman rights.\nIn addition to the environmental impacts of mining processes, a prominent criticism pertaining to this form of extractive practice and of mining companies are the human rights abuses occurring within mining sites and communities close to them. Frequently, despite being protected by International Labor rights, miners are not given appropriate equipment to provide them with protection from possible mine collapse or from harmful pollutants and chemicals expelled during the mining process, work in inhumane conditions spending numerous hours working in extreme heat, darkness and 14 hour workdays with no allocated time for breaks.\nChild labor.\nIncluded within the human rights abuses that occur during mining processes are instances of child labor. These instances are a cause for widespread criticism of mining cobalt, a mineral essential for powering modern technologies such as laptops, smartphones and electric vehicles. Many of these cases of child laborers are found in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Reports have risen of children carrying sacks of cobalt weighing 25\u00a0kg from small mines to local traders being paid for their work only in food and accommodation. A number of companies such as Apple, Google, Microsoft and Tesla have been implicated in lawsuits brought by families whose children were severely injured or killed during mining activities in Congo. In December 2019, 14 Congolese families filed a lawsuit against Glencore, a mining company which supplies the essential cobalt to these multinational corporations with allegations of negligence that led to the deaths of children or injuries such as broken spines, emotional distress and forced labor.\nIndigenous peoples.\nThere have also been instances of killings and evictions attributed to conflicts with mining companies. Almost a third of 227 murders in 2020 were of Indigenous peoples rights activists on the frontlines of climate change activism linked to logging, mining, large-scale agribusiness, hydroelectric dams, and other infrastructure, according to Global Witness.\nThe relationship between indigenous peoples and mining is defined by struggles over access to land. In Australia, the Aboriginal Bininj said mining posed a threat to their living culture and could damage sacred heritage sites.\nIn the Philippines, an anti-mining movement has raised concerns regarding \"the total disregard for [Indigenous communities'] ancestral land rights\". Ifugao peoples' opposition to mining led a governor to proclaim a ban on mining operations in Mountain Province, Philippines.\nIn Brazil, more than 170 tribes organized a march to oppose controversial attempts to strip back indigenous land rights and open their territories to mining operations. The United Nations Commission on Human Rights has called on Brazil's Supreme Court to uphold Indigenous land rights to prevent exploitation by mining groups and industrial agriculture.\nMining and Land Rights.\nMining operations often intersect with land rights in complex and sometimes contentious ways. In many countries, the ownership of land and the ownership of mineral resources are legally separated, with mineral rights usually vested in the state while land may be owned by individuals or communities.\nThis creates a situation in which communities may have legal ownership of the surface land but limited control over the extraction of minerals beneath it.\nCustomary land tenure, prevalent in many rural areas, often governs land use and inheritance.\nMining in these areas can disrupt farming, grazing, and culturally significant sites, and communities without formal titles may be vulnerable to displacement or inadequate compensation.\nRecords.\nAs of 2019, Mponeng is the world's deepest mine from ground level, reaching a depth of 4\u00a0km (2.5\u00a0mi) below ground level. The trip from the surface to the bottom of the mine takes over an hour. It is a gold mine in South Africa's Gauteng province. Previously known as Western Deep Levels #1 Shaft, the underground and surface works were commissioned in 1987. The mine is considered to be one of the most substantial gold mines in the world.\nThe Moab Khutsong gold mine in North West Province (South Africa) has the world's longest winding steel wire rope, which is able to lower workers to in one uninterrupted four-minute journey.\nThe deepest mine in Europe is the 16th shaft of the uranium mines in P\u0159\u00edbram, Czech Republic, at . Second is Bergwerk Saar in Saarland, Germany, at . \nThe deepest open-pit mine in the world is Bingham Canyon Mine in Bingham Canyon, Utah, United States, at over . The largest and second deepest open-pit copper mine in the world is Chuquicamata in northern Chile at , which annually produces 443,000 tons of copper and 20,000 tons of molybdenum. \nThe deepest open-pit mine with respect to sea level is Tagebau Hambach in Germany, where the base of the pit is below sea level.\nThe largest underground mine is Kiirunavaara Mine in Kiruna, Sweden. With of roads, 40 million tonnes of annually produced ore, and a depth of , it is also one of the most modern underground mines. The deepest borehole in the world is Kola Superdeep Borehole at , but this is connected to scientific drilling, not mining.\nMetal reserves and recycling.\nDuring the 20th century, the variety of metals used in society increased. Today, the development of major nations such as China and India and technological advances fuel an ever-greater demand. The result is that metal mining activities are expanding, and more and more of the world's metal stocks are above ground in use rather than below ground as unused reserves. An example is the in-use stock of copper. Between 1932 and 1999, copper in use in the US rose from to per person.\n95% of the energy used to make aluminium from bauxite ore is saved by using recycled material. However, levels of metal recycling are generally low. In 2010, the International Resource Panel, hosted by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), published reports on metal stocks that exist within society and their recycling rates.\nThe report's authors observed that the metal stocks in society can serve as substantial anthropogenic mines above ground. However, they warned that the recycling rates of some rare metals used in applications such as mobile phones, battery packs for hybrid cars, and fuel cells are so low that unless future end-of-life recycling rates are dramatically stepped up these critical metals will become unavailable for use in modern technology.\nAs recycling rates are low and so much metal has already been extracted, some landfill now contain higher concentrations of metal than the mines themselves. This is especially true of aluminum, used in cans, and precious metals, found in discarded electronics. Furthermore, waste after 15 years has still not broken down, so less processing would be required when compared to mining ores. A study undertaken by Cranfield University has found \u00a3360\u00a0million of metals could be mined from just four landfill sites. There is also up to 20\u00a0MJ/kg of energy in waste, potentially making the re-extraction more profitable. However, although the first landfill mine opened in Tel Aviv, Israel in 1953, little work has followed due to the abundance of accessible ores.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Colloquially, they are called the winter, summer and rainy seasons respectively. The alternating mountain ranges and valleys create alternate zones of heavy and subdued precipitation during the monsoon season, with the majority of the country's precipitation coming from the southwest monsoons.\nClimate varies in the highlands depending on elevation; subtropical temperate climate at around , temperate at , cool, alpine at and above the alpine zone, cold, harsh tundra and Arctic climate. The higher elevations are subject to heavy snowfall, especially in the north. Distance from the sea also affects temperature and inland highlands can experience daily temperature ranges spanning 22'F (12'C) despite the tropical latitude.\nMountains.\nMyanmar's mountains create five distinct physiographic regions.\nNorthern Mountains\nThe Northern Mountains are characterised by complex ranges centred around the eastern ends of the Himalayas and the northeastern limit of the Indian-Australian Plate. The ranges at the southern end of the Hengduan System form the border between Myanmar and China. Hkakabo Razi, the country's highest point at , is located at the northern end of the country. This mountain is part of a series of parallel ranges that run from the foothills of the Himalaya through the border areas with Assam, Nagaland and Mizoram.\nCentral Lowlands\nMyanmar is characterized by its Central Lowlands running north\u2013south between several different mountain ranges. This was deeply excavated by many rivers and today forms the basin for major rivers like the Irrawaddy, Chindwin and Sittaung Rivers. The Bago Yoma (Pegu Range) is a prominent but relatively low mountain chain between the Irrawaddy and the Sittaung River in lower-central Myanmar. Many smaller mountain ranges run through the lowlands like the small mountain ranges of Zeebyu Taungdan, Min-wun Taungdan, Hman-kin Taungdan and Gangaw Taungdan. Mount Popa, an extinct volcano and Nat worship holy site, rises prominently from the surrounding lowlands in these lowlands.\nWestern Ranges\nThe Western Ranges are characterized by the Arakan Mountains running from Manipur into western Myanmar southwards through Rakhine State almost to Cape Negrais in the shores of the Bay of Bengal in Ayeyarwady Region. The mountains reappear as the Andaman and Nicobar Islands further within the Andaman Sea. These mountains are old crystalline rocks separating the Arakan Coast from the rest of the country. The Arakan Range includes the Naga Hills, the Chin Hills, and the Patkai range which includes the Lushai Hills. The Arakan Coast of the Bay of Bengal lays west of these mountains with prominent island archipelagos and coral reefs.\nShan Plateau\nIn eastern Myanmar, the Shan Plateau rises abruptly from the central lowlands in single steps of some 2,000 feet (600m). The highest point of the Shan Hills is 2,563 m high Loi Pangnao, one of the ultra prominent peaks of Southeast Asia. The Shan Hills form, together with the Karen Hills, Dawna Range and Tenasserim Hills, a natural border with Thailand as well as the Kayah\u2013Karen montane rain forests ecoregion which is included in the Global 200 list of ecoregions identified by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) as priorities for conservation. The plateau was formed during the Mesozoic Era and are a much older feature than the other ranges of Myanmar, creating a series of elevated ranges and valleys. The most notable being the Salween River basin, covering 109,266 sq mi (283,00\u00a0km2).\nSoutheastern Hills\nMyanmar's Southeastern Hills and see the Tenasserim Plains have western shores backed by the Tenasserim Range respectively. The Tenessarim Plains consists largely of the western slopes of the Bilauktaung, the highest part of the Tenasserim Range, which extends southwards forming the central range of the Malay Peninsula. The Dawna Range also stretches along the northern parts of the Tenasserim tail of Myanmar. Many hills in this area, like Mount Zwegabin and Kyaiktiyo, are important cultural and religious sites. The coastal islands rise prominently from the sea and form multiple island archipelago with coral reefs, especially in the Mergui Archipelago.\nRivers.\nThe Irrawaddy, the main river of Burma, flows from north to south through the Central Burma Basin and ends in a wide delta. The Mekong river runs from the Tibetan Plateau through China's Yunnan and northeastern Burma into Laos. The basin has significant mining resources and forest ecosystems. Its fertile delta also create 60% of annual rice harvests. The river is historically significant with the Bagan temples on their banks and the Kachin people's homeland near the river's source- the confluence of the N'mai and Mali rivers.\nIn the east the Salween and the Sittaung River run along the western side of the Shan Hills and the northern end of the Dawna Range. The Salween begins in China, where it is called the Nu River , and runs south through 17 degrees of latitude through the Shan Plateau. The Salween runs is called the angry river in Mandarin due to its fast running waters snaking through mountainous terrain for almost the entirety of its 1,491-mile (2,400\u00a0km) long length.\nIn the narrow southeastern part of Burma, the Ye, Heinze, Dawei (Tavoy), Great Tenasserim (Tanintharyi) and the Lenya rivers are relatively short and flow into the Andaman Sea. Further south the Kraburi River forms the southern border between Thailand and Burma.\nMaritime claims.\nMyanmar has the 50th largest exclusive economic zone of . It includes more than 16 islands and the Mergui Archipelago.\n\"Contiguous zone:\"\n\"Continental shelf:\"\n or to the edge of the continental margin\n\"Exclusive economic zone:\"\nIslands.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nLand use and natural resources.\nSince ancient times, Myanmar has been famous for its abundance of natural resources. The Sanskrit name \"Suvarnabhumi\" (\u101e\u102f\u101d\u100f\u1039\u100f\u1018\u1030\u1019\u102d) has been used in relation to the area in modern-day Lower Burma and Thailand for millennia. Today, major resources include petroleum, natural gas, teak, other timber, tin, antimony, zinc, copper, tungsten, lead, coal, marble, limestone, jade, rubies, sapphire natural gas, and hydropower. Since 2010, Myanmar has had an explosion of foreign direct investment in the extractive sector. New large-scale infrastructure projects like the Kyaukphyu Pipeline and Myitsone Dam have caused controversy within the country, particularly in regard to China's role in the projects.\nNatural hazards.\nNatural hazards include destructive earthquakes and cyclones. Flooding and landslides are common during the rainy season from June to September. Periodic droughts also occur.\nEarthquakes.\nMyanmar lies at the confluence of the Indian Plate, Eurasian Plate and the Burma microplate. Both the Indian-Eurasian subduction zone and the Indian-Burma plate boundaries are frequent hypocenters for earthquakes. The continental right-lateral transform Sagaing Fault runs north-south through the middle of the country. It is responsible for many damaging earthquakes through the country's history like the 1839 Ava earthquake. Many earthquakes with a 6-8 magnitude caused damage in the country. For example the 1881 Nicobar Islands earthquake, 1941 Andaman Islands earthquake, and the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake.\nCyclones.\nMyanmar is also hit by a powerful cyclone roughly every two years. The highest frequency of severe cyclones occur during November and May. The past century of cyclogenesis data in the North Indian Ocean has seen a significant increase in cyclone formation during these two months. The most damaging cyclone that hit Myanmar was the Cyclone Nargis in April\u2013May 2008; with ongoing climate change, oceans will become warmer, which may lead to cyclones becoming more intense and devastating for Myanmar.\nEnvironment.\nEnvironmental issues include deforestation; industrial pollution of air, soil, and water; inadequate sanitation and water treatment that contributes to disease. Climate change is also projected to have major impacts on Myanmar, such as increasing the prevalence and intensity of drought and extreme weather.\nAn IUCN Red List of Ecosystems Assessment was conducted for Myanmar in 2020 that assessed 64 terrestrial ecosystem types across 10 biomes. Of these 64 ecosystem types, 1 was confirmed as collapsed, 8 were considered Critically Endangered, 9 were considered Endangered, 12 were considered Vulnerable, 3 were considered Near Threatened, 14 were considered of Least Concern, and 17 were deemed Data Deficient. The 64 terrestrial ecosystem types included five brackish tidal systems, one dry subterranean system, one lake, five palustrine wetlands, four polar/alpine systems, twelve savannas and grasslands, two shoreline systems, two supralittoral coastal systems, seven temperate-boreal forests and woodlands, and twenty five tropical and subtropical forests.\nA recent global remote sensing analysis suggested that there were 3,316\u00a0km2 of tidal flats in Myanmar, making it the 8th ranked country in terms of tidal flat area.\nEnvironment \u2013 international agreements.\n\"party to:\"\nBiodiversity, Desertification, Endangered Species, Law of the Sea, Nuclear Test Ban, Ozone Layer Protection, Ship Pollution, Tropical Timber 83, Tropical Timber 94\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

This total population includes 50,213,067 persons counted during the census and an estimated 1,206,353 persons in parts of northern Rakhine State, Kachin State and Kayin State who were not counted. More females (51.8%) were counted than males (48.2%). People who were out of the country at the time of the census are not included in these figures.\nThe provisional census results indicated that there were 10,889,348 households in Myanmar. On average, 4.4 people lived in each household in the country. The average household size was highest in Kachin State and Chin State at 5.1. The lowest household sizes were observed in Ayeyawady Region, Bago Region, Magway Region and Naypyidaw Union Territory, each at 4.1.\nStructure of the population.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Hidden begin/styles.css\"/&gt;Population Estimates by Sex and Age Group (01.X.2012) (Estimates):\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Hidden begin/styles.css\"/&gt;Population by Sex and Age Group (Census 29.III.2014) (Data refer to enumerated population. - 50 279 900); Population - 51 486 253:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Hidden begin/styles.css\"/&gt;Population Estimates by Sex and Age Group (01.X.2020) (Based on the results of the 2014 Population Census.): \nVital statistics.\nBurma has a low fertility rate (2.23 in 2011), slightly above replacement level, especially as compared to other Southeast Asian countries of similar economic standing, like Cambodia (3.18) and Laos (4.41), representing a significant decline from 4.7 in 1983 to 2.4 in 2001, despite the absence of any national population policy.\nThe fertility rate is much pronouncedly lower in urban areas. This is attributed to extreme delays in marriage (almost unparalleled in the region, with the exception of developed countries), the prevalence of illegal abortions, and the high proportion of single, unmarried women of reproductive age (with 25.9% of women aged 30\u201334 and 33.1% of men and women aged 25\u201334 single).\nThese patterns stem from several cultural and economic dynamics. The first is economic hardship, which results in the delay of marriage and family-building (the average age of marriage in Burma is 27.5 for men, 26.4 for women). The second is the social acceptability of celibacy among the Burmese, who are predominantly Buddhist and value celibacy as a means of spiritual development.\n&lt;includeonly&gt;&lt;templatestyles src=\"Chart/styles.css\"/&gt;&lt;/includeonly&gt;\n&lt;includeonly&gt;&lt;templatestyles src=\"Chart/styles.css\"/&gt;&lt;/includeonly&gt;\n&lt;includeonly&gt;&lt;templatestyles src=\"Chart/styles.css\"/&gt;&lt;/includeonly&gt;\nUN estimates.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"template:sticky header/styles.css\"/&gt;&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Sort under/styles.css\" /&gt;&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Table alignment/tables.css\" /&gt;\nRegistered births and deaths.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Static row numbers/styles.css\" /&gt;\nDemographic and Health Surveys.\nTotal Fertility Rate (TFR) (Wanted Fertility Rate) and Crude Birth Rate (CBR):\nCrude Birth Rate (CBR), Total Fertility Rate (TFR), and Total Marital Fertility Rate (TMFR) by region (2014 Myanmar Population and Housing Census):\nLife expectancy.\nSource: \"UN World Population Prospects\"\nEthnic groups.\nGovernment classifications.\nThe Burmese government identifies eight major national ethnic groups (which comprise 135 \"distinct\" ethnic groups), which include the Bamar (68%), Shan (10%), Karen (7%), Rakhine (4%), Mon (3%), Kayah (1.5%), and Kachin (1.3%). However, the government classification system is flawed, because it groups ethnic groups by geography, rather than by linguistic or genetic similarity (e.g. the Kokang are under the Shan ethnicity, although they are a Han Chinese sub-group).\nUnrecognised ethnic groups include Burmese Han-Chinese and Burmese Indians, who form 3% and 2% of the population respectively. The remaining 5% of the population belong to small ethnic groups such as the remnants of the Anglo-Burmese and Anglo-Indian communities, as well as the Lisu, Rawang, Naga, Padaung, Burmese Gurkha, Moken, and many minorities across Shan State.\nLanguage.\nThe official language and primary medium of instruction of Burma is Burmese (65%). Multiple languages are spoken in Burma, that includes Shan (7.4%), Karen (6.2%), Hindi or Urdu (4.3%), Tamil (3%), Kachin (2.1%), Chinese (2%) Chin (1.6%), Bengali (1.3%), Mon (1.8%), and Rakhine (2%), Nepali (1%). Additionally English is spoken as a second language, particularly by the educated urban elite, and is the secondary language learnt in government schools. In recent years, instruction of the Chinese language has been recovered, after long-term limitations from the government of Myanmar.\nReligious affiliation.\nBuddhist Sangha.\nBelow are statistics regarding the Buddhist monastic community in Myanmar, compiled by the State Sangha Maha Nayaka Committee.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "20390", "revid": "46602132", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20390", "title": "Politics of Myanmar", "text": " \nMyanmar (formerly Burma) () operates \"de jure\" as a unitary assembly-independent republic under its 2008 constitution. On 1 February 2021, Myanmar's military overthrew the country's democratically elected government in a coup, causing ongoing anti-coup protests.\nPolitical conditions.\nEarly history.\nThe first known city-states emerged in central Myanmar in the second century AD. They were founded by Tibeto-Burman-speaking migrants from present-day Yunnan. The history of Myanmar as a unified entity, formerly called Burma, began with the Pagan Kingdom in 849. In 1057, King Anawrahta founded the first unified Myanmar state at Bagan. In 1287, the Bagan kingdom collapsed following recurring Mongol invasions, leading to 250 years of political divide. In the time period between 1510 and 1752, the area was united as Burma by the Toungoo dynasty, which was the largest Southeast Asian empire in the 16th century. From 1752 to 1885, the Toungoo administrative reforms were continued by the Konbaung dynasty. The thousand-year line of Burmese monarchy ended with the Third Anglo-Burmese War in 1885.\nBritish rule.\nAfter 1885, the country was administered as part of British India until 1937. British Burma began with its official recognition on the colonial map that marks its new borders containing over 100 ethnicities. It was named Burma after the dominant ethnic group Bamar, who make up 68 percent of the population.\nWorld War II.\nDuring World War II, a coalition of mostly members of the Bamar ethnic group volunteered to fight alongside the Japanese in hope of overthrowing the occupying British forces. Meanwhile, many other ethnic groups supported the Allied forces against the Bamar-backed Japanese forces. This conflict would come to be very significant in the aftermath of World War II when Burma was granted its independence from Great Britain in 1948. Prior to the end of their colonization, the British government had created a novel map of the country with new borders that included some previously sovereign ethnicities. Many groups of racially and culturally diverse people suddenly found themselves as part of a country that was named after the Bamar, a group they did not identify with. The division created during World War II only exacerbated the growing resentment towards the Bamar. By granting independence to Burma, the British government handed the control of all the containing ethnicities over to the Bamar.\nPanglong Agreement.\nAung San, who led the fight for independence, was able to convince the leaders of the other ethnic groups that fought alongside the Burmese to remain as one country. The formation of the new Burmese constitution in 1948 was cemented by the Pin-Lone agreement, which was signed by every ethnic leader in support of the newfound union. Aung San's unprecedented assassination prior to the absolute fulfillment of the Pin-Lone agreement undid the unification he led. His death marked the end of the short lived period of peace within the new nation, unleashing a power vacuum that has not been filled properly since. A period of instability with leaders that failed to represent every ethnicity's best interest followed.\nBeginning in the late 1950s, and continuing through at least 2024, Myanmar's military has played a major role in shaping or directing the country's politics.23\nSocialist republic.\nDemocracy was suspended in the country following a coup in 1962. The uncertainty and chaos paved the way for a Burmese nationalist government to take over. From 1962 to 1988, the country was ruled by the Burma Socialist Programme Party as a one-party state guided by the Burmese Way to Socialism. The new Burmese leaders turned Burma into a Socialist Republic with isolationism, and a Burmese superiority. The newfound Burmese nationalism put the Bamar majority at the forefront, undoing the unification initiated through the Pin-Lone agreement. Additionally, the growing disdain was enhanced through the forced coexistence between members of different religions. Bamar kingdoms were almost exclusively Buddhist in the past. Most ethnic groups within the Shan, Kayin, Kayar, and Chin state practiced their own versions of Animism, while people of the Islamic faith lived alongside the Buddhists in the Arakan (now Rakhine) state. The annexation of all the diverse groups into the British India deepened the religious polarization. The movement of people across the border caused by the colonization added a large group of Hindu followers to the mix. The strenuous conversion campaigns by the Catholic Christians and their competition with the Methodist colonialists additionally divided minority groups such as the Karen and Kachin within themselves. The colonial departure unleashed the animosity that has been building towards one other. The death of Aung San, and the following leaderships ensured the lasting conflicts between every cultural and religious group. The 1988 Uprising cemented the social, political, and civil unrests that have plagued the country since.\n1988 Uprising.\nThe SPDC junta which took power in 1988 had been responsible for the displacement of several hundred thousand citizens, both inside and outside of Burma. The Karen, Karenni, and Mon ethnic groups have sought asylum in neighbouring Thailand, where they are also abused by an unfriendly and unsympathetic government. These groups are perhaps more fortunate than the Wa and Shan ethnic groups, who have become internally displaced peoples in their own state since being removed from lands by the military junta in 2000. There are reportedly 600,000 of these internally displaced peoples living in Burma today. Many are trying to escape forced labour in the military or for one of the many state-sponsored drug cartels. This displacement of peoples led, and continues to lead to human rights violations as well as the exploitation of minority ethnic groups at the hands of the dominant Bamar group. The primary actors in these ethnic struggles include, but are not limited to, the military, the Karen National Union, Kachin Independence army, United League of Arakan, Restoration Council of Shan State, and the Mong Tai Army.\nThe military gave up some of its power in 2011, leading to the creation of a semi-democratic system, although problems remained, including outsized influence by the military under the 2008 constitution, as well as economic and ethnic issues. In 2015 the military began taking steps to make peace with various ethnic armed groups calling a Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement which was signed by many such groups.\n2021 Myanmar coup d'\u00e9tat.\nOn 31 January 2021, it was reported by multiple media and news outlets that the military had staged a coup and members of the governing party, National League for Democracy, had been arrested and detained by the military. Bo Nagar, commander of the Burma National Revolutionary Army (BNRA), which is fighting against the military in Myanmar\u2019s central regions, told CNN in November 2023, \"It\u2019s the beginning of the end of State Administration Council, we are already seeing it.\" These conflicts arose after the NLD had claimed victory after a successful election in November 2020. While the military contested the results of the election claiming fraudulent without any proof or investigation. This situation was followed by the military performing coup d'\u00e9tat on 1 February 2021, taking the presidential powers from the NLD government by brute force. Shortly after taking control of the government, the military began breaking the Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement by taking aggressive actions in territories controlled by its signers.\nHistory.\nIndependence era.\nOn 4 January 1948, Burma achieved independence from Britain, and became a democracy based on the parliamentary system.\nIn late 1946 Aung San became Deputy Chairman of the Executive Council of Burma, a transitional government. But on 19 July 1947, political rivals assassinated Aung San (the current Prime Minister then) and several cabinet members, one of which was his brother. On 4 January 1948, the nation became an independent republic, named the \"Union of Burma\", with Sao Shwe Thaik as its first president and U Nu as its first prime minister. Unlike almost all other former British colonies, it did not become a member of the Commonwealth. A bicameral parliament was formed, consisting of a Chamber of Deputies and a Chamber of Nationalities. The geographical area Burma encompasses today can be traced to the Panglong Agreement, which combined Burma proper, which consisted of Lower Burma and Upper Burma, and the Frontier Areas, which had been administered separately by the British.\nAFPFL/Union government.\nIn 1961, U Thant, Burma's Permanent Representative to the United Nations and former secretary to the Prime Minister, was elected Secretary-General of the United Nations; he was the first non-Westerner to head any international organization and would serve as UN Secretary-General for ten years. Among the Burmese to work at the UN when he was Secretary-General was a young woman named Aung San Suu Kyi.\nMilitary socialist era.\nIn 1962, General Ne Win led a coup d'\u00e9tat and established a socialist military government that sought to create a \"Burmese Way to Socialism\". The military expropriated private businesses and followed an economic policy of autarky, or economic isolation. The Burmese Way to Socialism emphasized that the military was to have a central role in governing the country, and that the Burmese language and Buddhism were central to identity.\nThere were sporadic protests against military rule during the Ne Win years and these were almost always violently suppressed. On 7 July 1962, the government broke up demonstrations at Rangoon University, killing 15 students. In 1974, the military violently suppressed anti-government protests at the funeral of U Thant. Student protests in 1975, 1976 and 1977 were quickly suppressed by overwhelming force. The military government of General Ne Win was deposed following the massive 8888 Uprising in 1988 when thousands died, but immediately replaced by another military junta.\nSPDC era.\nThe former head of state was Senior General Than Shwe who held the title of \"Chairman of the State Peace and Development Council\". His appointed prime minister was Khin Nyunt until 19 October 2004, when he was forcibly deposed in favour of Gen. Soe Win. Almost all cabinet offices are held by military officers.\nUS and European government sanctions against the military government, combined with consumer boycotts and shareholder pressure organised by Free Burma activists, have succeeded in forcing most western corporations to withdraw from Burma. However, some western oil companies remain due to loopholes in the sanctions. For example, the French oil company TotalEnergies and the American oil company Chevron continue to operate the Yadana natural gas pipeline from Burma to Thailand. TotalEnergies (formerly TotalFinaElf) is the subject of a lawsuit in French and Belgian courts for alleged complicity in human rights abuses along the gas pipeline. Before it was acquired by Chevron, Unocal settled a similar lawsuit for a reported multimillion-dollar amount. Asian businesses, such as Daewoo, continue to invest in Burma, particularly in natural resource extraction.\nThe United States and European clothing and shoe industry became the target of Free Burma activists for buying from factories in Burma that were wholly or partly owned by the government or the military. Many stopped sourcing from Burma after protests, starting with Levi Strauss in 1992. From 1992 to 2003, Free Burma advocates successfully forced dozens of clothing and shoe companies to stop sourcing from Burma. These companies included Eddie Bauer, Liz Claiborne, Macy's, J. Crew, JoS. A. Banks, Children's Place, Burlington Coat Factory, Wal-Mart, and Target. The US government banned all imports from Burma as part of the \"Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act\" of 2003. Sanctions have been criticised for their adverse effects on the civilian population. However, Burmese democracy movement leader Aung San Suu Kyi has repeatedly credited sanctions for putting pressure on the ruling military regime.\nHuman Rights Watch and Amnesty International have documented egregious human rights abuses by the military government. Civil liberties were severely restricted. Human Rights Defenders and Promoters, formed in 2002 to raise awareness among the people of Burma about their human rights, claims that on 18 April 2007, several of its members were met by approximately a hundred people led by a local USDA Secretary U Nyunt Oo and beaten up. The HRDP believes that this attack was condoned by the authorities.\nThere is no independent judiciary in Burma and the military government suppresses political activity. The government uses software-based filtering from US company Fortinet to limit the materials citizens can access on-line, including free email services, free web hosting and most political opposition and pro-democracy pages.\nIn 2001, the government permitted NLD office branches to re-open throughout Burma. However, they were shut down or heavily restricted beginning 2004, as part of a government campaign to prohibit such activities. In 2006, many members resigned from NLD, citing harassment and pressure from the Tatmadaw (Armed Forces) and the Union Solidarity and Development Association.\nThe military government placed Aung San Suu Kyi under house arrest again on 31 May 2003, following an attack on her convoy in northern Burma by a mob reported to be in league with the military. The regime extended her house arrest for yet another year in late November 2005. Despite a direct appeal by Kofi Annan to Than Shwe and pressure from ASEAN, the Burmese government extended Aung San Suu Kyi's house arrest another year on 27 May 2006. She was released in 2010.\nThe United Nations urged the country to move towards inclusive national reconciliation, the restoration of democracy, and full respect for human rights. In December 2008, the United Nations General Assembly passed a resolution condemning the human rights situation in Burma and calling for Aung San Suu Kyi's release\u201480 countries voting for the resolution, 25 against and 45 abstentions. Other nations, such as China and Russia, have been less critical of the regime and prefer to co-operate on economic matters.\nFacing increasing international isolation, Burma's military government agreed to embark upon a programme of reform, including permitting multiple political parties to contest elections in 2010 and 2012 and the release of political prisoners. However, organizations such as Human Rights Watch allege continued human rights abuses in ongoing conflicts in border regions such as Kachin State and Rakhine State.\nNew constitution.\nMyanmar's army-drafted constitution was overwhelmingly approved (by 92.4% of the 22 million voters with alleged voter turnout of 99%) on 10 May 2008 in the first phase of a two-stage referendum and Cyclone Nargis. It was the first national vote since the 1990 election. Multi-party elections in 2010 would end 5 decades of military rule, as the new charter gives the military an automatic 25% of seats in parliament. NLD spokesman Nyan Win, inter alia, criticised the referendum: \"This referendum was full of cheating and fraud across the country. In some villages, authorities and polling station officials ticked the ballots themselves and did not let the voters do anything\".\n2010 election.\nAn election was held in 2010, with 40 parties approved to contest the elections by the Electoral Commission. some of which are linked to ethnic minorities. The National League for Democracy, which overwhelmingly won the previous 1990 elections but were never allowed to take power, decided not to participate.\nThe military-backed Union Solidarity and Development Party declared victory, winning 259 of the 330 contested seats. The United Nations and many Western countries have condemned the elections as fraudulent, although the decision to hold elections was praised by China and Russia.\n2012 by-elections.\nIn by-elections held in 2012, the main opposition party National League for Democracy, which was only re-registered for the by-elections on 13 December 2011 won in 43 of the 44 seats they contested (out of 46). Significantly, international observers were invited to monitor the elections, although the government was criticised for placing too many restrictions on election monitors, some of whom were denied visas.\nThe Union Solidarity and Development Party said it would lodge official complaints to the Union Election Commission on poll irregularities, voter intimidation, and purported campaign incidents that involved National League for Democracy members and supporters, while the National League for Democracy also sent an official complaint to the commission, regarding ballots that had been tampered with.\nHowever, President Thein Sein remarked that the by-elections were conducted \"in a very successful manner\", and many foreign countries have indicated willingness to lift or loosen sanctions on Burma and its military leaders.\n2015 election.\nMyanmar general elections were held on 8 November 2015. These were the first openly contested elections held in Myanmar since 1990. The results gave the National League for Democracy an absolute majority of seats in both chambers of the national parliament, enough to ensure that its candidate would become president, while NLD leader Aung San Suu Kyi is constitutionally barred from the presidency.\nThe resounding victory of Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy in 2015 general elections raised hopes for a successful political transition from a closely held military rule to a free democratic system. This transition was widely believed to be determining the future of Myanmar.\nAccording to the results announced by the Union Election Commission on 13 November 2015, the NLD won 238 seats in the lower house and 348 seats in the Pyidaungsu Hluttaw, exceeding the required number to form a government and elect a president.\n2021 military coup and subsequent junta.\nThe Tatmadaw, under the leadership of Min Aung Hlaing, seized power from the civilian government after detaining Aung San Suu Kyi and other democratically elected leaders in Naypyidaw. A military junta, officially the State Administration Council was subsequently established.\nCabinet members.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"template:sticky header/styles.css\"/&gt;\nThe president is the head of state and \"de jure\" head of government, and oversees the Cabinet of Myanmar. Currently the Chairman of the State Administration Council is the \"de facto\" head of government.\nThe Commander-in-Chief of the Myanmar Defense Forces (Tatmadaw) has the right to appoint 25% of the members in all legislative assembly which means that legislations cannot obtain super-majority without support from Tatmadaw, thus preventing democratically elected members from amending the 2008 Constitution of Myanmar. He can also directly appoint ministers in Ministry of Defence (Myanmar) which in turn controls Myanmar Armed Forces, Ministry of Border Affairs (Myanmar) which controls border affairs of the country, Ministry of Home Affairs (Myanmar) which controls Myanmar police forces and the administration of the country and Myanmar Economic Corporation which is the largest economic corporation in Myanmar.\nLegislative branch.\nUnder the 2008 Constitution the legislative power of the Union is shared among the \"Pyidaungsu Hluttaw\", State and Region Hluttaws. The \"Pyidaungsu Hluttaw\" consists of the People's Assembly (\"Pyithu Hluttaw\") elected on the basis of township as well as population, and the House of Nationalities (\"Amyotha Hluttaw\") with on an equal number of representatives elected from Regions and States. The People's Assembly consists of 440 representatives, with 110 being military personnel nominated by the Commander-in-Chief of the Defence Services. The House of Nationalities consists of 224 representatives with 56 being military personnel nominated by the Commander-in-Chief of the Defence Services.\nJudicial system.\nBurma's judicial system is limited. British-era laws and legal systems remain much intact, but there is no guarantee of a fair public trial. The judiciary is not independent of the executive branch. Burma does not accept compulsory International Court of Justice jurisdiction. The highest court in the land is the Supreme Court. The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court is Htun Htun Oo, and the Attorney General is also named Thida Oo.\n\"Wareru dhammathat\".\nWareru dhammathat or the Manu dhammathat () was the earliest law-book in Burma. It consists of laws ascribed to the ancient Indian sage, Manu, and brought to Burma by Hindu colonists. The collection was made at Wareru\u2019s command, by monks from the writings of earlier Mon scholars preserved in the monasteries of his kingdom. (Wareru seized Martaban in 1281 and obtained the recognition of China as the ruler of Lower Burma and founded a kingdom which lasted until 1539. Martaban was its first capital, and remained so until 1369. It stretched southwards as far as Tenasserim.)\n\"Dhammazedi pyatton\".\nMon King Dhammazedi (1472\u201392) was the greatest of the Mon rulers of Wareru's line. He was famous for his wisdom and the collection of his rulings were recorded in the Kalyani stone inscriptions and known as the Dammazedi pyatton.\nAdministrative divisions.\nBurma is divided into seven regions (previously called divisions-\"taing\") and seven states (\"pyi-n\u00e8\"), classified by ethnic composition. The seven regions are Ayeyarwady Region, Bago Division, Magway Division, Mandalay Division, Sagaing Division, Tanintharyi Division and Yangon Division; the seven states are Chin State, Kachin State, Kayin State, Kayah State, Mon State, Rakhine State and Shan State.\nThere are also five Self-administrated zones and a Self-administrated Division \"for National races with suitable population\"\nWithin the Sagain Region\nWithin the Shan State\nInternational organisation participation (in terms of food, water, medicine, shelter, etc.).\nSource:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
