The most basic examples are the natural numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and so forth. Individual numbers can be represented in language with number words or by dedicated symbols called \"numerals\"; for example, \"five\" is a number word and \"5\" is the corresponding numeral. As only a limited list of symbols can be memorized, a numeral system is used to represent any number in an organized way. The most common representation is the Hindu\u2013Arabic numeral system, which can display any non-negative integer using a combination of ten symbols, called numerical digits. Numerals can be used for counting (as with cardinal number of a collection or set), labels (as with telephone numbers), for ordering (as with serial numbers), and for codes (as with ISBNs). In common usage, a \"numeral\" is not clearly distinguished from the \"number\" that it represents.\nIn mathematics, the notion of number has been extended over the centuries to include zero (0), negative numbers, rational numbers such as one half formula_1, real numbers such as the square root of 2 formula_2, and \u03c0, and complex numbers which extend the real numbers with a square root of \u22121, and its combinations with real numbers by adding or subtracting its multiples. Calculations with numbers are done with arithmetical operations, the most familiar being addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation. Their study or usage is called arithmetic, a term which may also refer to number theory, the study of the properties of numbers.\nViewing the concept of zero as a number required a fundamental shift in philosophy, identifying nothingness with a value. During the 19th century, mathematicians began to develop the various systems now called algebraic structures, which share certain properties of numbers, and may be seen as extending the concept. Some algebraic structures are explicitly referred to as numbers (such as the p-adic numbers and hypercomplex numbers) while others are not, but this is more a matter of convention than a mathematical distinction.\nHistory.\nFirst use of numbers.\nBones and other artifacts have been discovered with marks cut into them that many believe are tally marks. Some historians suggest that the Lebombo bone (dated about 43,000 years ago) and the Ishango bone (dated about 22,000 to 30,000 years ago) are the oldest arithmetic artifacts but this interpretation is disputed. These tally marks may have been used for counting elapsed time, such as numbers of days, lunar cycles or keeping records of quantities, such as of animals. A perceptual system for quantity thought to underlie numeracy, is shared with other species, a phylogenetic distribution suggesting it would have existed before the emergence of language.\nA tallying system has no concept of place value (as in modern decimal notation), which limits its representation of large numbers. Nonetheless, tallying systems are considered the first kind of abstract numeral system.\nThe earliest unambiguous numbers in the archaeological record are the Mesopotamian base\u00a060 (sexagesimal) system (c.\u20093400\u00a0BC); place value emerged in the 3rd millennium BCE. The earliest known base\u00a010 system dates to 3100\u00a0BC in Egypt. A Babylonian clay tablet dated to provides an estimate of the circumference of a circle to its diameter of formula_3 = 3.125, possibly the oldest approximation of \u03c0.\nNumerals.\nNumbers should be distinguished from numerals, the symbols used to represent numbers. The Egyptians invented the first ciphered numeral system, and the Greeks followed by mapping their counting numbers onto Ionian and Doric alphabets. (However, in 300 BC, Archimedes first demonstrated the use of a positional numeral system to display extremely large numbers in \"The Sand Reckoner\".) Roman numerals, a system that used combinations of letters from the Roman alphabet, remained dominant in Europe until the spread of the Hindu\u2013Arabic numeral system around the late 14th century, and the Hindu\u2013Arabic numeral system remains the most common system for representing numbers in the world today. The key to the effectiveness of the system was the symbol for zero, which was developed by ancient Indian mathematicians around 500 AD.\nZero.\nThe first known recorded use of zero as an integer dates to AD 628, and appeared in the \"Br\u0101hmasphu\u1e6dasiddh\u0101nta\", the main work of the Indian mathematician Brahmagupta. He is usually considered the first to formulate the mathematical concept of zero. Brahmagupta treated 0 as a number and discussed operations involving it, including division by zero. He gave rules of using zero with negative and positive numbers, such as \"zero plus a positive number is a positive number, and a negative number plus zero is the negative number\". By this time (the 7th\u00a0century), the concept had clearly reached Cambodia in the form of Khmer numerals, and documentation shows the idea later spreading to China and the Islamic world. The concept began reaching Europe through Islamic sources around the year 1000.\nThere are other uses of zero before Brahmagupta, though the documentation is not as complete as it is in the \"Br\u0101hmasphu\u1e6dasiddh\u0101nta\". The earliest uses of zero was as simply a placeholder numeral in place-value systems, representing another number as was done by the Babylonians. Many ancient texts used\u00a00, including Babylonian and Egyptian texts. Egyptians used the word \"nfr\" to denote zero\u00a0balance in double entry accounting. Indian texts used a Sanskrit word or to refer to the concept of \"void\". In mathematics texts this word often refers to the number zero. In a similar vein, P\u0101\u1e47ini (5th century BC) used the null (zero) operator in the \"Ashtadhyayi\", an early example of an algebraic grammar for the Sanskrit language (also see Pingala).\nRecords show that the Ancient Greeks seemed unsure about the status of\u00a00 as a number: they asked themselves \"How can 'nothing' be something?\" leading to interesting philosophical and, by the Medieval period, religious arguments about the nature and existence of\u00a00 and the vacuum. The paradoxes of Zeno of Elea depend in part on the uncertain interpretation of\u00a00. (The ancient Greeks even questioned whether\u00a01 was a number.)\nThe late Olmec people of south-central Mexico began to use a placeholder symbol for zero, a shell glyph, in the New World, by 38\u00a0BC. It would be the Maya who developed zero as a cardinal number, employing it in their numeral system and in the Maya calendar. Maya used a base 20 numerical system by combining a number of dots (base\u00a05) with a number of bars (base\u00a04). George I. S\u00e1nchez in 1961 reported a base\u00a04, base\u00a05 \"finger\" abacus.\nBy 130 AD, Ptolemy, influenced by Hipparchus and the Babylonians, was using a symbol for\u00a00 (a small circle with a long overbar) within a sexagesimal numeral system otherwise using alphabetic Greek numerals. Because it was used alone, not as just a placeholder, this Hellenistic zero was the first \"documented\" use of a true zero in the Old World. In later Byzantine manuscripts of his \"Syntaxis Mathematica\" (\"Almagest\"), the Hellenistic zero had morphed into the Greek letter Omicron (otherwise meaning\u00a070 in isopsephy).\nA true zero was used in tables alongside Roman numerals by 525 (first known use by Dionysius Exiguus), but as a word, meaning \"nothing\", not as a symbol. When division produced\u00a00 as a remainder, , also meaning \"nothing\", was used. These medieval zeros were used by all future medieval computists (calculators of Easter). An isolated use of their initial, N, was used in a table of Roman numerals by Bede or a colleague about 725, a true zero symbol.\nNegative numbers.\nThe abstract concept of negative numbers was recognized as early as 100\u201350 BC in China. \"The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art\" contains methods for finding the areas of figures; red rods were used to denote positive coefficients, black for negative. The first reference in a Western work was in the 3rd\u00a0century AD in Greece. Diophantus referred to the equation equivalent to 4\"x\" + 20 \n 0 (the solution is negative) in \"Arithmetica\", saying that the equation gave an absurd result.\nDuring the 600s, negative numbers were in use in India to represent debts. Diophantus' previous reference was discussed more explicitly by Indian mathematician Brahmagupta, in \"Br\u0101hmasphu\u1e6dasiddh\u0101nta\" in 628, who used negative numbers to produce the general form quadratic formula that remains in use today. However, in the 12th\u00a0century in India, Bhaskara gives negative roots for quadratic equations but says the negative value \"is in this case not to be taken, for it is inadequate; people do not approve of negative roots\".\nEuropean mathematicians, for the most part, resisted the concept of negative numbers until the 17th\u00a0century, although Fibonacci allowed negative solutions in financial problems where they could be interpreted as debts (chapter\u00a013 of , 1202) and later as losses (in ). Ren\u00e9 Descartes called them false roots as they cropped up in algebraic polynomials yet he found a way to swap true roots and false roots as well. At the same time, the Chinese were indicating negative numbers by drawing a diagonal stroke through the right-most non-zero digit of the corresponding positive number's numeral. An early European experimenter with negative numbers was Nicolas Chuquet during the 15th\u00a0century. He used them as exponents, but referred to them as \"absurd numbers\".\nAs recently as the 18th century, it was common practice to ignore any negative results returned by equations on the assumption that they were meaningless.\nRational numbers.\nIt is likely that the concept of fractional numbers dates to prehistoric times. The Ancient Egyptians used their Egyptian fraction notation for rational numbers in mathematical texts such as the Rhind Mathematical Papyrus and the Kahun Papyrus. The Rhind Papyrus includes an example of deriving the area of a circle from its diameter, which yields an estimate of \u03c0 as formula_4 \u2248 3.16049... Classical Greek and Indian mathematicians made studies of the theory of rational numbers, as part of the general study of number theory. A particularly influential example of these is Euclid's \"Elements\", dating to roughly 300\u00a0BC. Of the Indian texts, the most relevant is the Sthananga Sutra, which also covers number theory as part of a general study of mathematics.\nThe concept of decimal fractions is closely linked with decimal place-value notation; the two seem to have developed in tandem. For example, it is common for the Jain math sutra to include calculations of decimal-fraction approximations to pi or the square root of 2. Similarly, Babylonian math texts used sexagesimal (base\u00a060) fractions.\nReal numbers and irrational numbers.\nThe Babylonians, as early as 1800 BCE, demonstrated numerical approximations of irrational quantities such as \u221a2 on clay tablets, with an accuracy analogous to six decimal places, as in the tablet YBC 7289. These values were primarily used for practical calculations in geometry and land measurement. There were practical approximations of irrational numbers in the Indian Shulba Sutras composed between 800 and 500\u00a0BC.\nThe first existence proofs of irrational numbers is usually attributed to Pythagoras, more specifically to the Pythagorean Hippasus, who produced a (most likely geometrical) proof of the irrationality of the square root of 2. The story goes that Hippasus discovered irrational numbers when trying to represent the square root of 2 as a fraction. However, Pythagoras believed in the absoluteness of numbers. He could not disprove the existence of irrational numbers, or accept them, so according to legend, he sentenced Hippasus to death by drowning, to impede the spread of this unsettling news.\nThe 16th century brought final European acceptance of negative integers and fractional numbers. By the 17th century, mathematicians generally used decimal fractions with modern notation. The concept of real numbers was introduced in the 17th century by Ren\u00e9 Descartes. While studying compound interest, in 1683 Jacob Bernoulli found that as the compounding intervals grew ever shorter, the rate of exponential growth converged to a base of 2.71828...; this key mathematical constant would later be named Euler's number (e). Irrational numbers began to be studied systematically in the 18th century, with Leonhard Euler who proved that the irrational numbers are those numbers whose simple continued fractions is not finite and that Euler's number (e) is irrational. The irrationality of \u03c0 was proved in 1761 by Johann Lambert.\nIt is in the second half of the 19th century that real numbers, and thus irrational numbers, were rigorously defined, with the work of Augustin-Louis Cauchy, Charles M\u00e9ray (1869), Karl Weierstrass (1872), Eduard Heine (1872), Georg Cantor (1883), and Richard Dedekind (1872).\nTranscendental numbers and reals.\nA transcendental number is a numerical value that is not the root of a polynomial with integer coefficients. This means it is not algebraic and thus excludes all rational numbers. The existence of transcendental numbers was first established by Liouville (1844, 1851). Hermite proved in 1873 that \"e\" is transcendental and Lindemann proved in 1882 that \u03c0 is transcendental. Finally, Cantor showed that the set of all real numbers is uncountably infinite but the set of all algebraic numbers is countably infinite, so there is an uncountably infinite number of transcendental numbers.\nInfinity and infinitesimals.\nIn mathematics, infinity is considered an abstract concept rather than a number; instead of being \"greater than any number\", infinite is the property of having no end. The earliest known conception of mathematical infinity appears in the Yajurveda, an ancient Indian script, which at one point states, \"If &amp;lsqb;the whole&amp;rsqb; was subtract from &amp;lsqb;the whole&amp;rsqb;, the leftover will still be &amp;lsqb;the whole&amp;rsqb;\". Infinity was a popular topic of philosophical study among the Jain mathematicians c. 400\u00a0BC. They distinguished between five types of infinity: infinite in one and two directions, infinite in area, infinite everywhere, and infinite perpetually.\nAristotle defined the traditional Western notion of mathematical infinity. He distinguished between actual infinity and potential infinity\u2014the general consensus being that only the latter had true value. Galileo Galilei's \"Two New Sciences\" discussed the idea of one-to-one correspondences between infinite sets, known as Galileo's paradox. The next major advance in the theory was made by Georg Cantor; in 1895 he published a book about his new set theory, introducing, among other things, transfinite numbers and formulating the continuum hypothesis. The symbol formula_5, often used to represent an infinite quantity, was first introduced in a mathematical context by John Wallis in 1655.\nIn the 1960s, Abraham Robinson showed how infinitely large and infinitesimal numbers can be rigorously defined and used to develop the field of nonstandard analysis. The system of hyperreal numbers represents a rigorous method of treating the ideas about infinite and infinitesimal numbers that had been used casually by mathematicians, scientists, and engineers ever since the invention of infinitesimal calculus by Newton and Leibniz.\nA modern geometrical version of infinity is given by projective geometry, which introduces \"ideal points at infinity\", one for each spatial direction. Each family of parallel lines in a given direction is postulated to converge to the corresponding ideal point. This is closely related to the idea of vanishing points in perspective drawing.\nComplex numbers.\nThe earliest fleeting reference to square roots of negative numbers occurred in the work of the mathematician and inventor Heron of Alexandria in the 1st century AD, when he considered the volume of an impossible frustum of a pyramid. They became more prominent when in the 16th\u00a0century closed formulas for the roots of third and fourth degree polynomials were discovered by Italian mathematicians such as Niccol\u00f2 Fontana Tartaglia and Gerolamo Cardano. It was soon realized that these formulas, even if one was only interested in real solutions, sometimes required the manipulation of square roots of negative numbers.\nThis was doubly unsettling since they did not even consider negative numbers to be on firm ground at the time. Ren\u00e9 Descartes is sometimes credited with coining the term \"imaginary\" for these quantities in 1637, intending it as derogatory. (See imaginary number for a discussion of the \"reality\" of complex numbers.) A further source of confusion was that the equation\nformula_6\nseemed capriciously inconsistent with the algebraic identity\nformula_7\nwhich is valid for positive real numbers \"a\" and \"b\", and was also used in complex number calculations with one of \"a\", \"b\" positive and the other negative. The incorrect use of this identity, and the related identity\nformula_8\nin the case when both \"a\" and \"b\" are negative even bedeviled Euler. This difficulty eventually led him to the convention of using the special symbol \"i\" in place of formula_9 to guard against this mistake.\nThe 18th century saw the work of Abraham de Moivre and Leonhard Euler. De Moivre's formula (1730) states:\nformula_10\nwhile Euler's formula of complex analysis (1748) gave us:\nformula_11\nA special case of this formula yields Euler's identity:\nformula_12\nshowing a profound connection between the most fundamental numbers in mathematics.\nThe existence of complex numbers was not completely accepted until Caspar Wessel described the geometrical interpretation in 1799. Carl Friedrich Gauss rediscovered and popularized it several years later, and as a result the theory of complex numbers received a notable expansion. However, the idea of the graphic representation of complex numbers had appeared as early as 1685, in Wallis's \"De algebra tractatus\".\nIn the same year, Gauss provided the first generally accepted proof of the fundamental theorem of algebra, showing that every polynomial over the complex numbers has a full set of solutions in that realm. Gauss studied complex numbers of the form \"a\" + \"bi\", where \"a\" and \"b\" are integers (now called Gaussian integers) or rational numbers. His student, Gotthold Eisenstein, studied the type \"a\" + \"b\u03c9\", where \"\u03c9\" is a complex root of \"x\"3 \u2212 1 \n 0 (now called Eisenstein integers). Other such classes (called cyclotomic fields) of complex numbers derive from the roots of unity \"x\"\"k\" \u2212 1 \n 0 for higher values of \"k\". This generalization is largely due to Ernst Kummer, who also invented ideal numbers, which were expressed as geometrical entities by Felix Klein in 1893.\nIn 1850 Victor Alexandre Puiseux took the key step of distinguishing between poles and branch points, and introduced the concept of essential singular points. This eventually led to the concept of the extended complex plane.\nPrime numbers.\nPrime numbers may have been studied throughout recorded history. They are natural numbers that are not a product of two smaller natural numbers. It has been suggested that the Ishango bone includes a list of the prime numbers between 10 and 20. The Rhind papyrus display different forms for prime numbers. But the formal study of prime numbers is first documented by the ancient Greek. Euclid devoted one book of the \"Elements\" to the theory of primes; in it he proved the infinitude of the primes and the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, and presented the Euclidean algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor of two numbers.\nIn 240 BC, Eratosthenes used the Sieve of Eratosthenes to quickly isolate prime numbers. But most further development of the theory of primes in Europe dates to the Renaissance and later eras. At around 1000 AD, Ibn al-Haytham discovered Wilson's theorem. Ibn al-Banna' al-Marrakushi found a way to speed up the Sieve of Eratosthenes by only testing up to the square root of the number. Fibonacci communicated Islamic mathematical contributions to Europe, and in 1202 was the first to describe the method of trial division.\nIn 1796, Adrien-Marie Legendre conjectured the prime number theorem, describing the asymptotic distribution of primes. Other results concerning the distribution of the primes include Euler's proof that the sum of the reciprocals of the primes diverges, and the Goldbach conjecture, which claims that any sufficiently large even number is the sum of two primes. Yet another conjecture related to the distribution of prime numbers is the Riemann hypothesis, formulated by Bernhard Riemann in 1859. The prime number theorem was finally proved by Jacques Hadamard and Charles de la Vall\u00e9e-Poussin in 1896. Goldbach and Riemann's conjectures remain unproven and unrefuted.\nCultural and symbolic significance.\nNumbers have held cultural, symbolic and religious significance throughout history and in many cultures. In Ancient Greece, number symbolism heavily influenced the development of Greek mathematics, stimulating the investigation of many problems in number theory which are still of interest today. According to Plato, Pythagoreans attributed specific characteristics and meaning to particular numbers, and believed that \"things themselves are numbers\".\nFolktales in different cultures exhibit preferences for particular numbers, with three and seven holding special significance in European culture, while four and five are more prominent in Chinese folktales. Numbers are sometimes associated with luck: in Western society, the number 13 is considered unlucky while in Chinese culture the number eight is considered auspicious.\nMain classification.\nNumbers can be classified into sets, called number sets or number systems, such as the natural numbers and the real numbers. The main number systems are as follows:\nEach of these number systems extends the preceding one. So, for example, a rational number is also a real number, and every real number is also a complex number. This chain of set inclusions can be expressed symbolically as:\nformula_13.\nNatural numbers.\nThe most familiar numbers are the natural numbers (sometimes called whole numbers or counting numbers): 1, 2, 3, and so on. Traditionally, the sequence of natural numbers started with\u00a01 (0 was not even considered a number for the Ancient Greeks.) However, in the 19th\u00a0century, set theorists and other mathematicians started including\u00a00 (cardinality of the empty set, i.e. 0\u00a0elements, where\u00a00 is thus the smallest cardinal number) in the set of natural numbers. Today, various mathematicians use the term to describe both sets, including\u00a00 or not. The mathematical symbol for the set of all natural numbers is N, also written formula_14, and sometimes formula_15 or formula_16 when it is necessary to indicate whether the set should start with 0 or 1, respectively.\nIn the base 10 numeral system, in almost universal use today for mathematical operations, the symbols for natural numbers are written using ten digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. The radix or base is the number of unique numerical digits, including zero, that a numeral system uses to represent numbers (for the decimal system, the radix is 10). In this base\u00a010 system, the rightmost digit of a natural number has a place value of\u00a01, and every other digit has a place value ten times that of the place value of the digit to its right.\nIn set theory, which is capable of acting as an axiomatic foundation for modern mathematics, natural numbers can be represented by classes of equivalent sets. For instance, the number\u00a03 can be represented as the class of all sets that have exactly three elements. Alternatively, in Peano Arithmetic, the number\u00a03 is represented as \"S\"(\"S\"(\"S\"(0))), where \"S\" is the \"successor\" function (i.e.,\u00a03 is the third successor of\u00a00). Many different representations are possible; all that is needed to formally represent\u00a03 is to inscribe a certain symbol or pattern of symbols three times.\nIntegers.\nThe negative of a positive integer is defined as a number that produces\u00a00 when it is added to the corresponding positive integer. Negative numbers are usually written with a negative sign (a minus sign). As an example, the negative of\u00a07 is written\u00a0\u22127, and 7 + (\u22127) \n 0. When the set of negative numbers is combined with the set of natural numbers (including\u00a00), the result is defined as the set of integers, Z also written formula_17. Here the letter Z comes from de \" Zahl\"\u00a0'number'. The set of integers forms a ring with the operations addition and multiplication.\nThe natural numbers form a subset of the integers. As there is no common standard for the inclusion or not of zero in the natural numbers, the natural numbers without zero are commonly referred to as positive integers, and the natural numbers with zero are referred to as non-negative integers.\nRational numbers.\nA rational number is a number that can be expressed as a fraction with an integer numerator and a positive integer denominator. Negative denominators are allowed, but are commonly avoided, as every rational number is equal to a fraction with positive denominator. Fractions are written as two integers, the numerator and the denominator, with a dividing bar between them. The fraction represents \"m\" parts of a whole divided into \"n\" equal parts. Two different fractions may correspond to the same rational number; for example and are equal, that is:\nformula_18\nIn general,\nformula_19 if and only if formula_20\nIf the absolute value of \"m\" is greater than \"n\" (supposed to be positive), then the absolute value of the fraction is greater than\u00a01 and it is termed an improper or top-heavy fraction. Fractions can be greater than, less than, or equal to\u00a01 and can also be positive, negative, or\u00a00. The set of all rational numbers includes the integers since every integer can be written as a fraction with denominator\u00a01. For example\u00a0\u22127 can be written\u00a0. The symbol for the rational numbers is Q (for \"quotient\"), also written formula_21.\nReal numbers.\nThe symbol for the real numbers is R, also written as formula_22 They include all the measuring numbers. Every real number corresponds to a point on the number line. The treatment of negative real numbers is according to the general rules of arithmetic and their denotation is simply prefixing the corresponding positive numeral by a minus sign, e.g. \u2212123.456.\nEach digit to the right of the decimal point has a place value one-tenth of the place value of the digit to its left. For example, 123.456 represents , or, in words, one hundred, two tens, three ones, four tenths, five hundredths, and six thousandths. A real number can be expressed by a finite number of decimal digits only if it is rational and its fractional part has a denominator whose prime factors are 2 or 5 or both, because these are the prime factors of 10, the base of the decimal system. Thus, for example, one half is 0.5, one fifth is 0.2, one-tenth is 0.1, and one fiftieth is 0.02.\nRepeating decimal.\nIf the fractional part of a real number has an infinite sequence of digits that follows a cyclical pattern, it can be written with an ellipsis or another notation that indicates the repeating pattern. Such a decimal is called a repeating decimal. Thus can be written as 0.272727..., with an ellipsis to indicate that the pattern continues. Forever repeating 27s are also written as 0.27. These recurring decimals, including the repetition of zeroes, denote exactly the rational numbers, i.e., all rational numbers are real numbers, but it is not the case that every real number is rational.\nFor a fractional part with a repeating decimal of consecutive nines, they may be replaced by incrementing the last digit before the nines. Thus, 3.7399999999... or 3.739 is equivalent to 3.74. A fractional part with an unlimited number of 0s can be rewritten by dropping the 0s to the right of the rightmost nonzero digit. Just as the same fraction can be written in more than one way, the same real number may have more than one decimal representation. For example, 0.999..., 1.0, 1.00, 1.000, ..., all represent the natural number\u00a01.\nIrrational numbers.\nFor real numbers that are not rational numbers, representing them as decimals would require an infinite sequence of varying digits to the right of the decimal point. These real numbers are called irrational. A famous irrational real number is the \u03c0, the ratio of the circumference of any circle to its diameter. When pi is written as\nformula_23\nas it sometimes is, the ellipsis does not mean that the decimals repeat (they do not), but rather that there is no end to them. It has been proved that \u03c0 is irrational. Another well-known number, proven to be an irrational real number, is\nformula_24\nthe square root of 2, that is, the unique positive real number whose square is 2. Both these numbers have been approximated (by computer) to trillions ( 1 trillion \n 1012 \n 1,000,000,000,000 ) of digits.\nAlmost all real numbers are irrational and therefore have no repeating patterns and hence no corresponding decimal numeral. They can only be \"approximated\" by decimal numerals, denoting rounded or truncated real numbers, in which a decimal point is placed to the right of the digit with place value\u00a01. Any rounded or truncated number is necessarily a rational number, of which there are only countably many.\nAll measurements are, by their nature, approximations, and always have a margin of error. Thus 123.456 is considered an approximation of any real number in the interval:\n formula_25\nwhen rounding to three decimals, or of any real number in the interval:\n formula_26\nwhen truncating after the third decimal. Digits that suggest a greater accuracy than the measurement itself does, should be removed. The remaining digits are then called significant digits.\nFor example, measurements with a ruler can seldom be made without a margin of error of at least 0.001 m. If the sides of a rectangle are measured as 1.23\u00a0m and 4.56\u00a0m, then multiplication gives an area for the rectangle between 5.614591 m2 and 5.603011 m2. Since not even the second digit after the decimal place is preserved, the subsequent digits are not \"significant\". Therefore, the result is usually rounded to 5.61 m2.\nSet theory.\nThe real numbers have an important but highly technical property called the least upper bound property.\nIt can be shown that any complete, ordered field is isomorphic to the real numbers. The real numbers are not, however, an algebraically closed field, because they do not include a solution (often called a square root of minus one) to the algebraic equation formula_27.\nComplex numbers.\nMoving to a greater level of abstraction, the real numbers can be extended to the complex numbers. The complete solution set of a polynomial of degree two or higher can include the square roots of negative numbers. (An example is formula_28.) To conveniently represent this, the square root of\u00a0\u22121 is denoted by \"i\", a symbol assigned by Leonhard Euler called the imaginary unit. Hence, complex numbers consist of all values of the form:\nformula_29\nwhere \"a\" and \"b\" are real numbers. Because of this, complex numbers correspond to points on the complex plane, a vector space of two real dimensions. In the expression \"a\" + \"bi\", the real number \"a\" is called the real part and \"b\" is called the imaginary part.\nIf the real part of a complex number is\u00a00, then the number is called an imaginary number or is referred to as \"purely imaginary\"; if the imaginary part is\u00a00, then the number is a real number. Thus the real numbers are a subset of the complex numbers. If the real and imaginary parts of a complex number are both integers, then the number is called a Gaussian integer. The symbol for the complex numbers is C or formula_30.\nThe fundamental theorem of algebra asserts that the complex numbers form an algebraically closed field, meaning that every polynomial with complex coefficients has a root in the complex numbers. Like the reals, the complex numbers form a field, which is complete, but unlike the real numbers, it is not ordered. That is, there is no consistent meaning assignable to saying that \"i\" is greater than\u00a01, nor is there any meaning in saying that \"i\" is less than\u00a01. In technical terms, the complex numbers lack a total order that is compatible with field operations.\nComplex analysis is the branch of mathematical analysis that investigates functions of complex numbers. It is useful for the solution of physical problems, and is widely used in modern mathematics, engineering, and the sciences. Examples of applications include fluid dynamics, control theory, signal processing, number theory, and solving differential equations. Complex numbers appear to be a fundamental aspect of quantum mechanics; it can not be formulated using only real numbers.\nSubclasses of the integers.\nEven and odd numbers.\nAn even number is an integer that is \"evenly divisible\" by two, that is divisible by two without remainder; an odd number is an integer that is not even. (The old-fashioned term \"evenly divisible\" is now almost always shortened to \"divisible\".) This property of an integer is called the parity. Any odd number \"n\" may be constructed by the formula \"n\" \n 2\"k\" + 1, for a suitable integer \"k\". Starting with \"k\" \n 0, the first non-negative odd numbers are {1, 3, 5, 7, ...}. Any even number \"m\" has the form \"m\" \n 2\"k\" where \"k\" is again an integer. Similarly, the first non-negative even numbers are {0, 2, 4, 6, ...}. The product of an even number with an integer is another even number; only the product of an odd number with an odd number is another odd number.\nPrime numbers.\nA prime number, often shortened to just prime, is an integer greater than 1 that is not the product of two smaller positive integers. The first few prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, and 11. There is no such simple formula as for odd and even numbers to generate the prime numbers. A special class are the Mersenne primes, which are prime numbers of the form 2\"n\" \u2212 1, where \"n\" is a positive integer. These hold many records for the largest prime numbers discovered.\nThe study of primes have led to many questions, only some of which have been answered. The study of these questions belongs to number theory. Goldbach's conjecture is an example of a still unanswered question: \"Is every even number the sum of two primes?\" One answered question, as to whether every integer greater than one is a product of primes in only one way, except for a rearrangement of the primes, was confirmed; this proven claim is called the fundamental theorem of arithmetic. A proof appears in Euclid's Elements.\nIn the modern world, prime numbers have a number of important applications, including in public-key cryptography, digital signature, pseudorandom number generation, signal processing, and filtering data for digital image processing. Prime numbers are useful in hash tables and error detection codes (such as those used in ISBN and ISSN).\nOther classes of integers.\nMany subsets of the natural numbers have been the subject of specific studies and have been named, often eponymously after the first mathematician that has studied them. Examples of such sets of integers are Bernoulli numbers, Fibonacci numbers, Lucas numbers, and perfect numbers. For more examples, see Integer sequence.\nSubclasses of the complex numbers.\nAlgebraic, irrational and transcendental numbers.\nAlgebraic numbers are those that are a solution to a polynomial equation with integer coefficients. Real numbers that are not rational numbers are called irrational numbers. Complex numbers which are not algebraic are called transcendental numbers. The algebraic numbers that are solutions of a monic polynomial equation with integer coefficients are called algebraic integers.\nPeriods and exponential periods.\nA period is a complex number that can be expressed as an integral of an algebraic function over an algebraic domain. The periods are a class of numbers which includes, alongside the algebraic numbers, many well known mathematical constants such as the number \"\u03c0\". The set of periods form a countable ring and bridge the gap between algebraic and transcendental numbers. \nThe periods can be extended by permitting the integrand to be the product of an algebraic function and the exponential of an algebraic function. This gives another countable ring: the exponential periods. The number \"e\" as well as Euler's constant are exponential periods. \nConstructible numbers.\nMotivated by the classical problems of constructions with straightedge and compass, the constructible numbers are those complex numbers whose real and imaginary parts can be constructed using straightedge and compass, starting from a given segment of unit length, in a finite number of steps. A related subject is origami numbers, which are points constructed through paper folding.\nComputable numbers.\nA computable number, also known as \"recursive number\", is a real number such that there exists an algorithm which, given a positive number \"n\" as input, produces the first \"n\" digits of the computable number's decimal representation. Equivalent definitions can be given using \u03bc-recursive functions, Turing machines or \u03bb-calculus. The computable numbers are stable for all usual arithmetic operations, including the computation of the roots of a polynomial, and thus form a real closed field that contains the real algebraic numbers.\nThe computable numbers may be viewed as the real numbers that may be exactly represented in a computer: a computable number is exactly represented by its first digits and a program for computing further digits. However, the computable numbers are rarely used in practice. One reason is that there is no algorithm for testing the equality of two computable numbers. More precisely, there cannot exist any algorithm which takes any computable number as an input, and decides in every case if this number is equal to zero or not.\nThe set of computable numbers has the same cardinality as the natural numbers. Therefore, almost all real numbers are non-computable. However, it is very difficult to produce explicitly a real number that is not computable.\nExtensions of the concept.\n\"p\"-adic numbers.\nThe \"p\"-adic numbers may have infinitely long expansions to the left of the decimal point, in the same way that real numbers may have infinitely long expansions to the right. The number system that results depends on what base is used for the digits: any base is possible, but a prime number base provides the best mathematical properties. The set of the \"p\"-adic numbers contains the rational numbers, but is not contained in the complex numbers.\nThe elements of an algebraic function field over a finite field and algebraic numbers have many similar properties (see Function field analogy). Therefore, they are often regarded as numbers by number theorists. The \"p\"-adic numbers play an important role in this analogy.\nHypercomplex numbers.\nHigher dimensional number systems may be constructed from the real numbers formula_31 in a way that generalize the construction of the complex numbers. They are sometimes called hypercomplex numbers, and are not included in the set of complex numbers. They include the quaternions formula_32, introduced by Sir William Rowan Hamilton, in which multiplication is not commutative; the octonions formula_33, in which multiplication is not associative in addition to not being commutative; and the sedenions formula_34, in which multiplication is not alternative, neither associative nor commutative. The hypercomplex numbers include one real unit together with formula_35 imaginary units, for which \"n\" is a non-negative integer. For example, quaternions can generally represented using the form:\nformula_36\nwhere the coefficients a, b, c, d are real numbers, and i, j, k are 3 different imaginary units.\nEach hypercomplex number system is a subset of the next hypercomplex number system of double dimensions obtained via the Cayley\u2013Dickson construction. For example, the 4-dimensional quaternions formula_32 are a subset of the 8-dimensional octonions formula_33, which are in turn a subset of the 16-dimensional sedenions formula_34, in turn a subset of the 32-dimensional trigintaduonions formula_40, and \"ad infinitum\" with formula_41 dimensions, with \"n\" being any non-negative integer. Including the complex and real numbers and their subsets, this can be expressed symbolically as:\nformula_42\nAlternatively, starting from the real numbers formula_31, which have zero complex units, this can be expressed as\nformula_44\nwith formula_45 containing formula_41 dimensions.\nQuaternions have proven particularly useful for computation of rotations in three dimensions. For example, they are used in control systems for rockets and aircraft, as well as for robotics, computer visualization, navigation, and animation. Octonions appear to have a deeper theoretical connection with physics, particularly in string theory, M-theory and supergravity.\nTransfinite numbers.\nFor dealing with infinite sets, the natural numbers have been generalized to the ordinal numbers and to the cardinal numbers. The former gives the ordering of the set, while the latter gives its size. For finite sets, both ordinal and cardinal numbers are identified with the natural numbers. In the infinite case, many ordinal numbers correspond to the same cardinal number.\nNonstandard numbers.\nHyperreal numbers are used in non-standard analysis. The hyperreals, or nonstandard reals (usually denoted as *R), denote an ordered field that is a proper extension of the ordered field of real numbers R and satisfies the transfer principle. This principle allows true first-order statements about R to be reinterpreted as true first-order statements about *R.\nSuperreal and surreal numbers extend the real numbers by adding infinitesimally small numbers and infinitely large numbers, but still form fields.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The dance is also known as \"Two Step\" and was \"one of the most popular forms of contemporary social dance\" as a Disco Couples Dance in 1978. The dance, often described as floaty, mainly consists of rock steps and glides (sliding). It is frequently danced to mid-tempo ballads in time that have a characteristic quick-quick-slow beat. A classic example is the song \"The Lady In Red\".\nDescription.\nThe nightclub two step basic step can be counted as one &amp; two - three &amp; four -. This timing is also known as a quick-quick-slow tempo. There is also a slow-quick-quick timing that can be used depending on the song.\nThe dance position for nightclub two step is in a relaxed closed position. The footwork between the two timings (quick-quick-slow and slow-quick-quick) are identical and differ only in the first step. Using the slow-quick-quick timing as an example, the lead takes a side step with their left foot while the follow mirrors them with their right foot. On beat 2, both partners perform a rock step with the lead's right foot and follower's left placed behind them. On the &amp; of 2, both partners place their weight on the foot in front of them. This same pattern is repeated for beats 3 - 4 &amp;, but on the other side. This timing puts the slow on beat 1, which can be a preference depending on the music. The same footwork can be applied to the quick-quick-slow timing, but with the first step being the rock step.\nThe quick rock steps should be matched with the quick drum beats in the music. The \"slow\" drum beat and slow step can occur on either the second and fourth, or the first and third beats of a measure. Although other rhythmic interpretations of the music are possible, including the use of \"breaks\" in the music, they are beyond the scope of this article.\nAnother pattern in NC2S is the side-cross-side move. Typically, the lead starts this move by stepping to the side with their left foot and then crosses in front with their right foot. This is followed by another step to the side with the left foot. The rhythm, here, is quick, quick, slow. The follow does the same thing, but starts with their right foot. Both partners cross in front. In an interview with Phil Seyer Buddy said he created this move by modifying something that was popular in the 60's called the \"Surfer Stomp.\" The surfer stomp was simply, \"side, together, side, touch.\" In the DVIDA Nightclub Two-Step syllabus, this action is called a Traveling Cross.\nUCWDC lists a narrow range of 54-64 beats per minute for the dance,\n but historic and contemporary dance teacher Richard Powers claims that 72 to 92 beats per minute works with this dance.\nStyling.\nOn the rock step, \"The toe is to the heel, but not further. Don't twist your hip. If your hip opens up, you have gone too far.\"\n A gentle but noticeable resistance should be maintained.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "21692", "revid": "36617661", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21692", "title": "No wave", "text": "Music scene\nNo wave was an avant-garde music and visual art scene that emerged in the late 1970s in Downtown New York City. The term was coined as a rejection of commercial new wave music. No wave musicians took rock instrumentation and experimented with noise, dissonance, and atonality, as well as non-rock genres like free jazz, funk, and disco. The scene often reflected an abrasive, confrontational, and nihilistic worldview, originally pioneered by New York artists Suicide and Jack Ruby. \nIn 1978, Brian Eno produced the compilation album \"No New York\", which became an important document of the scene. The no wave movement influenced independent film (no wave cinema), fashion, and visual art, then, in the mid-1980s, musical developments such as mutant disco and post-no wave. At the time, regional scenes influenced by New York city no wave would emerge such as Japan's Kansai no wave movement along with the Chicago no wave scene.\nNotable artists include James Chance and the Contortions, Teenage Jesus and the Jerks, Mars, DNA, Theoretical Girls and Rhys Chatham.\nCharacteristics.\nNo wave is not a clearly definable musical genre with consistent features, but it generally was characterized by a rejection of the recycling of traditional rock aesthetics, such as blues rock styles and Chuck Berry guitar riffs in punk and new wave music. No wave groups drew on and explored such disparate stylistic forms as minimalism, conceptual art, funk, jazz, blues, punk rock, avant garde and noise music. According to \"Village Voice\" writer Steve Anderson, the scene pursued an abrasive reductionism which \"undermined the power and mystique of a rock vanguard by depriving it of a tradition to react against\". Anderson claimed that the no wave scene represented \"New York's last stylistically cohesive avant-rock movement\".\nThere were, however, some elements common to most no-wave music, such as abrasive atonal sounds; repetitive, driving rhythms; and a tendency to emphasize musical texture over melody\u2014typical of La Monte Young's early downtown music. In the early 1980s, Downtown Manhattan's no wave scene transitioned from its abrasive origins into a more dance-oriented sound, with compilations such as ZE Records's \"Mutant Disco\" (1981) highlighting a playful sensibility borne out of the city's clash of hip hop, disco and punk styles, as well as dub reggae and world music influences.\nNo wave music presented a negative and nihilistic world view that reflected the desolation of late 1970s Downtown New York and how they viewed the larger society. In a 2020 essay, Lydia Lunch stated there were many problems in the years that led into the 1970s, and that calling the year 1967 \"the Summer of Love\" was a \"bald-faced lie\". The term \"no wave\" might have been inspired by the French New Wave pioneer Claude Chabrol, with his remark \"There are no waves, only the ocean\".\nEtymology.\nThere are different theories about how the term was coined. Some suggest Lydia Lunch coined the term in an interview with Roy Trakin in \"New York Rocker\". Others suggest it was coined by Chris Nelson (of Mofungo and The Scene Is Now) in \"New York Rocker\". Thurston Moore of Sonic Youth claimed to have seen the term spray-painted on CBGB's theater at 66 Second Avenue before seeing it in the press.\nInfluences.\nAlthough not from New York, Captain Beefheart and the confrontational proto-punk performances of Iggy Pop and the Stooges have been cited as an influence on no wave, alongside Nihilist Spasm Band, an early noise music band whose debut LP \"No Record\" was released in 1968. The band plastered the word \"NO\" on much of their equipment and handmade instruments, and recorded a film between 1965 and 1966 entitled \"NO Movie\". They have been cited as an influence by Thurston Moore of Sonic Youth. \nThe Velvet Underground, a 1960s New York City band, are also seen as early contributors to the no wave movement. As described by \"Pitchfork\"'s Marc Masters, \"Mixing the noisy rock leanings of Lou Reed, the minimalist drones of John Cale (via his work with avant-garde pioneer LaMonte Young), and the art world influence of Andy Warhol's Factory, this seminal band provided a comprehensive model for No Wave.\" Additionally, other '60s New York-based avant-garde music artists like Yoko Ono, Cromagnon, and the Godz were also later recognized as precursors to no wave.\nHistory.\n1970s.\nForerunners.\nNew York City duo Suicide, formed in 1970, by Alan Vega and Martin Rev, have been cited as having \"the biggest influence on no-wave\" by Marc Masters. Glenn Branca later stated, \u201cIf you have to find out who the godfather of no wave was, it was Alan Vega.\u201d\nNew York band Jack Ruby, formed in 1973 in Albany, became early pioneers of the aesthetic, philosophy and sound of no wave as well as an influence on Sonic Youth. Members included Randy Cohen on drums and synthesizer as well as Boris Policeband, who played viola through an FM transmitter and strapped police walkie-talkies around his waist. Subsequently, bassist George Scott III joined no wave group James Chance and the Contortions and collaborated with Lydia Lunch in 8 Eyed Spy. Thurston Moore said of Jack Ruby: \"This was a band whispered about from the most inner circle of no-wave knowledge, as they pre-dated a lot of the aesthetic weirdness and wild style of so much of that scene.\"\nOrigins.\nIn 1978, a punk subculture-influenced noise series was held at New York's Artists Space. No wave musicians such as the Contortions, Teenage Jesus and the Jerks, Mars, DNA, Theoretical Girls and Rhys Chatham began experimenting with noise, dissonance and atonality in addition to non-rock styles. The former four groups were included on the compilation \"No New York\", often considered the quintessential testament to the scene. The no wave-affiliated label ZE Records was founded in 1978, and would also produce acclaimed and influential compilations in subsequent years.\nIn 1978, Rhys Chatham curated a concert at The Kitchen with two electric guitar noise music bands that involved Glenn Branca (Theoretical Girls and Daily Life, performed by Branca, Barbara Ess, Paul McMahon, and Christine Hahn) and another two electric-guitar noise music bands that involved Chatham himself (The Gynecologists and Tone Death, performed by Robert Appleton, Nina Canal, Chatham, and Peter Gordon). Tone Death performed Chatham's 1977 composition for electric guitars \"Guitar Trio\", that was inspired by La Monte Young's minimalist composition \"Trio for Strings\" and Chatham's exposure to The Ramones at CBGB via Peter Gordon. This proto-No Wave concert was followed a few weeks later when Artists Space served as a site of concrete inception for the No Wave music movement, hosting a five night underground No Wave music festival, organized by artists Michael Zwack and Robert Longo, that featured ten local bands; including Rhys Chatham's The Gynecologists, Glenn Branca's Theoretical Girls, Rhys Chatham's Tone Death, and Branca's Daily Life. \nThe final two days of the show featured DNA and the Contortions on Friday, followed by Mars and Teenage Jesus and the Jerks on Saturday. English musician and producer Brian Eno, who had originally come to New York to produce the second Talking Heads album \"More Songs About Buildings and Food\", was in the audience. Impressed by what he saw and heard, and advised by Diego Cortez to do so, Eno was convinced that this movement should be documented and proposed the idea of a compilation album, \"No New York\", with himself as a producer.\nBy the early 1980s, artists such as Liquid Liquid, the B-52's, Cristina, Arthur Russell, James White and the Blacks and Lizzy Mercier Descloux developed a dance-oriented style described by Lucy Sante as \"anything at all + disco bottom\". Other no-wave groups such as Swans, Suicide, Glenn Branca, the Lounge Lizards, Bush Tetras and Sonic Youth instead continued exploring the forays into noise music abrasive territory. For example, Noise Fest was an influential festival of no wave noise music performances curated by Thurston Moore of Sonic Youth at the New York City art space White Columns in June 1981. Sonic Youth made their first live appearances at this show. \nThe Noise Fest inspired Speed Trials, the noise rock five-night concert series held May 4\u20138, 1983, that was organized by Live Skull members in May 1983, also at White Columns (then located at 91 Horatio Street). Among an art installation created by David Wojnarowicz and Joseph Nechvatal, Speed Trials included performances by the Fall, Sonic Youth, Lydia Lunch, Mofungo, Ilona Granet, pre-rap Beastie Boys, 3 Teens Kill 4, Elliott Sharp as Carbon, Swans, the Ordinaires, and Arto Lindsay as Toy Killers. On May 10, the San Francisco noise-punk band Flipper closed the series out with a live concert at Studio 54. This event also included performances by Zev and Eric Bogosian and a video presentation by Tony Oursler. Speed Trials was followed by the short-lived after-hours audio art Speed Club that was established by Nechvatal and Bradley Eros at ABC No Rio that summer.\nOther art media in the no wave scene.\nCinema.\nNo Wave Cinema was an underground low-budget film scene in Tribeca and the East Village from the late-1970s to the mid-1980s. Rooted in the gritty, rebellious ethos of the Lower East Side's no wave post-punk art scene, No Wave Cinema was marked by its DIY approach, low budgets, and an unpolished aesthetic that rejected mainstream filmmaking conventions. Musicians, visual artists, and filmmakers converged, regularly working across multiple mediums. This interdisciplinary collaboration and a sense of community was a hallmark of No Wave Cinema. \nAvant-garde filmmakers like Andy Warhol, Pier Paolo Pasolini, Jean-Pierre Melville, Rainer Werner Fassbinder and Jack Smith were notable influences, as was French Nouvelle Vague cinema, Italian neorealism, early 1970s intimate low budget European films, such as Bernardo Bertolucci's 1972 film Last Tango in Paris, and a general interest in the history of film noir. Handheld Super 8 film cameras were initially the means to shoot the films often in the street, in downtown nightclubs, in cars, or apartments using available light.\nThe first No Wave film was Ivan Kral and Amos Poe's 1976 film, \"The Blank Generation\". It explored the No Wave music scene in CBGB's with artists such as the Ramones, Talking Heads, Blondie and Patti Smith, among several others. The second No Wave film was the 1977 short, \"X-Terminator\", directed by Michael Oblowitz. Oblowitz made the film whilst studying at Columbia University and editing Semiotext(e) alongside Kathryn Bigelow and Sylv\u00e8re Lotringer. Further No Wave filmmakers included Eric Mitchell, Scott B and Beth B, Jim Jarmusch, Jamie Nares, Coleen Fitzgibbon, Diego Cortez, Charlie Ahearn, Tom DiCillo, Lizzie Borden, Susan Seidelman, Vincent Gallo, Charlie Ahearn, Adele Bertei, David Wojnarowicz, Vivienne Dick, Kiki Smith, Michael McClard, Andrea Callard and Seth Tillett. Eric Mitchell's 1985 film \"The Way It Is or Eurydice in the Avenues\" is considered the climatic apogee of low-budget production values of no wave filmmaking as the film's dialogue track was dubbed over the 35mm film in editing. \nFor many years the scene was centered around the Mudd Club and Colab's New Cinema Screening Room on St. Marks Place in the East Village. No Wave Cinema actors included Patti Astor, Steve Buscemi, Cookie Mueller, Debbie Harry, John Lurie, Eric Mitchell, Rockets Redglare, Vincent Gallo, Duncan Hannah, Anya Phillips, Rene Ricard, Arto Lindsay, Tom Wright, Richard Hell, and Lydia Lunch.\nVisual art.\nVisual artists played a large role in the no wave scene, as visual artists often were playing in bands, or making videos and films, while making visual art for exhibition. An early influence on this aspect of the scene was Alan Vega (aka Alan Suicide), whose electronic junk sculpture predated his role in the music group Suicide, which he formed with fellow musician Martin Rev in 1970. They released \"Suicide\", their first album, in 1977.\nImportant exhibitions of no wave visual art were Barbara Ess's \"Just Another Asshole\" show and subsequent compilation projects and Colab's organization of \"The Real Estate Show\", \"The Times Square Show\", and the \"Island of Negative Utopia\" show at The Kitchen.\nNo wave art found an ongoing home on the Lower East Side with the establishment of ABC No Rio Gallery in 1980, and a no wave punk aesthetic was a dominant strand in the art galleries of the East Village (from 1982 to 1986).\nLegacy.\nIn a foreword to the book \"No Wave\", Weasel Walter wrote of the movement's ongoing influence:\nI began to express myself musically in a way that felt true to myself, constantly pushing the limits of idiom or genre and always screaming \"Fuck You!\" loudly in the process. It's how I felt then and I still feel it now. The ideals behind the (anti-) movement known as No Wave were found in many other archetypes before and just as many afterwards, but for a few years around the late 1970s, the concentration of those ideals reached a cohesive, white-hot focus.\nIn 2004, Scott Crary made the documentary \"Kill Your Idols\", including such no wave bands as Suicide, Teenage Jesus and the Jerks, DNA and Glenn Branca as well as bands influenced by no wave, including Sonic Youth, Swans, Foetus and others.\nIn 2007\u20132008, three books on the scene were published: Stuart Baker's (editor) Soul Jazz Records \"New York Noise\" (with photographs by Paula Court), Marc Masters' Black Dog Publishing \"No Wave\" (with a foreword by Weasel Walter), and Thurston Moore and Byron Coley's Harry N. Abrams \"No Wave: Post-Punk. Underground. New York. 1976\u20131980\" (for which Lydia Lunch wrote the Introduction).\nColeen Fitzgibbon and Alan W. Moore created a short film in 1978 (finished in 2009) of a New York City no wave concert to benefit Colab titled \"X Magazine Benefit\", documenting performances by DNA, James Chance and the Contortions, and Boris Policeband. Shot in black and white and edited on video, the film captured the gritty look and sound of the music scene during that era. In 2013, it was exhibited at Salon 94, an art gallery in New York City.\nIn 2023, the No Wave movement received institutional recognition at the Centre Pompidou with a Nicolas Ballet curated exhibition entitled \"Who You Staring At:\u00a0Culture visuelle de la sc\u00e8ne no wave des ann\u00e9es 1970 et 1980\" (\"Visual culture of the no wave scene in the 1970s and 1980s\"). Musical performances and three recorded conversations with No Wave artists were included as part of the exhibition.\nRegional scenes.\nKansai no wave.\nKansai no wave was a regionalized extension of New York city no wave, and consisted of early Japanese punk and noise music artists centered around Osaka, Kobe, Kyoto and other parts of the Kansai region in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Artists included Aunt Sally, Inu, Ultra Bide members Hide and Jojo Hiroshige, and SS. The movement later influenced the development of the Japanoise scene.\nChicago no wave.\nChicago no wave was a regionalized extension of New York city no wave, based in Chicago during the 1990s and 2000s, spearheaded by groups such as U.S. Maple, the Flying Luttenbachers, Scissor Girls and Brise-Glace.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

(later NeXT Computer, Inc. and NeXT Software, Inc.) was an American technology company headquartered in Redwood City, California, which specialized in computer workstations for higher education and business markets, and later developed the first dynamic web page software. It was founded in 1985 by Steve Jobs, the Apple Computer co-founder who had been removed from Apple that year. NeXT debuted with the NeXT Computer in 1988, and released the NeXTcube and smaller NeXTstation in 1990. The series had relatively limited sales, with only about 50,000 total units shipped. Nevertheless, the object-oriented programming and graphical user interface were highly influential trendsetters of computer innovation.\nNeXT partnered with Sun Microsystems to create a programming environment called OpenStep, which decoupled the NeXTSTEP operating system's application layer to host it on third-party operating systems. In 1993, NeXT withdrew from the hardware industry to concentrate on marketing OPENSTEP for Mach, its own OpenStep implementation for several other computer vendors. NeXT developed WebObjects, one of the first enterprise web frameworks, and although its market appeal was limited by its high price of US$, it is a prominent early example of dynamic web pages rather than static content.\nApple bought NeXT in 1997 for $427million, including 1.5million shares of Apple stock. The deal appointed Steve Jobs, then the chairman and CEO of NeXT, to an advisory role at Apple; and OPENSTEP for Mach was combined with the classic Mac OS, to create Rhapsody and Mac OS X.\nMany successful applications have lineage from NeXT, including the first web browser and the video games \"Doom\" and \"Quake\".\nHistory.\nBackground.\nIn 1985, Apple co-founder and CEO Steve Jobs led a division campaign called SuperMicro, which was responsible for developing the Macintosh and Lisa computers. They were commercial successes on university campuses because Jobs had personally visited a few notable universities to promote his products, and because of Apple University Consortium, a discounted academic marketing program. The Consortium had earned over $50million on computer sales by February 1984.\nJobs met Paul Berg, a Nobel Laureate in chemistry, at a luncheon in Silicon Valley held to honor President of France Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand. Berg was frustrated by the time and expense of researching recombinant DNA via wet laboratories, and suggested that Jobs should use his influence to create a \"3M computer\" that is designed for higher education.\nJobs was intrigued by Berg's concept of a workstation and contemplated starting a higher-education computer company in late 1985, amid increasing turmoil at Apple. Jobs's division did not release the upgraded versions of the Macintosh computer and much of the Macintosh Office software. As a result, its sales plummeted, and Apple was forced to write off millions of dollars in unsold inventory.\nIn 1985, John Sculley ousted Jobs from his executive role at Apple and replaced him with Jean-Louis Gass\u00e9e. Later that year, Jobs began a power struggle to regain control over his company. The board of directors sided with Sculley, and Jobs took a business trip to Western Europe and the Soviet Union on behalf of Apple. In September 1985, after several months of being sidelined, Jobs resigned from Apple. He told the board he was leaving to set up a new computer company, and that he would be taking several Apple employees from the SuperMicro division with him, but he also promised that his new company would not compete with Apple and might even consider licensing their designs to them under the Macintosh brand.\nOriginal NeXT team.\nNeXT was founded by Steve Jobs and several former Apple employees, including Joanna Hoffman, Bud Tribble, George Crow, Rich Page, Susan Barnes, Susan Kare, and Dan'l Lewin. After consulting with major educational buyers from around the country, including a follow-up meeting with Paul Berg, a tentative specification for a workstation computer was drawn up. It was designed to be powerful enough to run wet lab simulations and affordable enough for dormitory rooms. Before the specifications were finished, however, Apple sued NeXT on September 23, 1985, for \"nefarious schemes\" to take advantage of the cofounders' insider information. Jobs argued, \"It is hard to think that a $2billion company with 4,300-plus people couldn't compete with six people in blue jeans.\" The suit was eventually dismissed before trial.\nIn 1986, Jobs recruited graphic designer Paul Rand to create a brand identity for $. Jobs recalled, \"I asked him if he would come up with a few options, and he said, 'No, I will solve your problem for you and you will pay me. You don't have to use the solution. If you want options go talk to other people.'\" Rand created a 20-page brochure detailing the brand, including the precise angle used for the logo (28\u00b0) and a new company name spelling, NeXT.\n1987\u20131993: NeXT Computer.\nFirst generation.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nI want some kid at Stanford to be able to cure cancer in his dorm room.\nSteve Jobs, on the purpose of the NeXT Computer\nIn mid-1986, NeXT changed its business plan to develop both hardware and software, rather than just workstations. Rich Page, a NeXT cofounder who formerly directed Apple's Lisa team, led a team to develop the hardware, while kernel engineer Avie Tevanian led the development of NeXT's operating system, NeXTSTEP. NeXT's first factory was established in Fremont, California, in 1987; it was capable of manufacturing about 150,000 machines per year. NeXT's first workstation is the NeXT Computer, nicknamed \"the cube\" due to its distinctive magnesium cubic case. The case was designed by Hartmut Esslinger and his team at Frog Design.\nIn 1987, Ross Perot became NeXT's first major outside investor. He invested $20million for 16% of NeXT's stock after seeing a segment about NeXT on the 1986 PBS documentary \"Entrepreneurs\". In 1988, he joined the company's board of directors.\nNeXT and Adobe collaborated on Display PostScript (DPS), a 2D graphics engine that was released in 1987. NeXT engineers wrote an alternative windowing engine edition to take full advantage of NeXTSTEP. NeXT engineers used DPS for on-screen graphics such as title bar and scroller for the user-space windowing library.\nThe original design team anticipated completing the computer in early 1987 and launching it for $ by mid-year. On October 12, 1988, the NeXT Computer received standing ovations when it was revealed at a private gala event, \"NeXT Introduction\" in San Francisco, California. The following day, selected educators and software engineers were invited to attend the first public technical overview of the NeXT computer at the event \"The NeXT Day\" held at the San Francisco Hilton. The event gave developers interested in NeXT software an insight into their architecture, object-oriented programming, and the NeXT Computer. The luncheon speaker was Steve Jobs.\nThe first NeXT Computers were test launched in 1989, and then NeXT sold a limited number to universities with NeXTSTEP 0.9 beta pre-installed. Initially, this targeted the United States higher-education institutions only, with a base price of $. The computer was widely reviewed in magazines, primarily the hardware portion. When asked if he was upset that the computer's debut was delayed by several months, Jobs responded, \"Late? This computer is five years ahead of its time!\"\nThe NeXT Computer uses a 25\u00a0MHz Motorola 68030 central processing unit (CPU). The Motorola 88000 RISC chip was originally considered, but it was not available in sufficient quantities. The computer has between 8 and 64 MB of random-access memory (RAM), a 256\u00a0MB magneto-optical (MO) drive, a 40\u00a0MB (swap-only), 330\u00a0MB, or 660\u00a0MB hard disk drive, 10BASE2 Ethernet, NuBus, and a 17-inch MegaPixel grayscale display with 1120\u00d7832 pixels. In 1989, a typical new PC, Macintosh, or Amiga computer included a few megabytes of RAM, a 640\u00d7480 16-color or 320x240 4,096-color display, a 10- to 20-megabyte hard drive, and few networking capabilities. It is the first computer to ship with a general-purpose DSP chip (Motorola 56001) on the motherboard. This supports sophisticated music and sound processing, including the Music Kit software.\nThe magneto-optical (MO) drive manufactured by Canon Inc. is the primary mass storage device. This drive technology was relatively new to the market, and the NeXT is the first computer to use it. MO drives were cheaper but much slower than hard drives, with an average seek time of 96 ms; Jobs negotiated Canon's initial price of $150 per blank MO disk so that they could sell at retail for only $50. The drive's design made it impossible to move files between computers without a network, because each NeXT Computer has only one MO drive and the disk can not be removed without shutting down the system. The drive's limited speed and capacity makes it insufficient as NeXTSTEP's primary medium.\nIn 1989, NeXT started a deal for Businessland, a former Compaq reseller, to sell the NeXT Computer in international markets. Selling through a retailer was a major change from NeXT's original business model of only selling directly to students and educational institutions. Businessland founder David Norman predicted that sales of the NeXT Computer would surpass sales of Compaq computers after 12 months.\nThat year, Canon invested $million in NeXT, for a 16.67% stake, making NeXT worth almost $600million. This had the condition of installing NeXTSTEP on its own workstations, greatly expanding NeXTSTEP's market. After NeXT exited the hardware business, Canon produced a PC line called \"object.station\"\u2014including models 31, 41, 50, and 52\u2014specifically designed to run NeXTSTEP on Intel. Canon was NeXT's distributor in Japan.\nThe NeXT Computer was released in 1990 for $. In June 1991, Perot resigned from the board of directors to concentrate on his company, Perot Systems, a Plano, Texas\u2013based software system integrator.\nSecond generation.\nIn 1990, NeXT released a second generation of workstations, a revised NeXT Computer called NeXTcube and the NeXTstation. The NeXTstation's nickname is \"the slab\" for its low-rise box form-factor. Jobs ensured that NeXT staffers did not nickname the NeXTstation \"pizza box\" to avoid inadvertent comparison with competitor Sun workstations, which already had that nickname.\nThe machines were initially planned to use the 2.88\u00a0MB floppy drive, but its floppy disks were expensive and had failed to supplant the 1.44\u00a0MB floppy. NeXT used the CD-ROM drive instead, which eventually became the industry standard for storage. Color graphics were available on the NeXTstation Color and NeXTdimension graphics processor hardware for the NeXTcube. The new computers, with the new Motorola 68040 processor, were cheaper and faster than their predecessors.\nIn 1992, NeXT launched \"Turbo\" variants of the NeXTcube and NeXTstation, with a 33\u00a0MHz 68040 processor and the maximum RAM capacity increased to 128\u00a0MB. In 1992, NeXT sold 20,000 computers, counting upgraded motherboards on back order as system sales. The company reported sales of $140million for the year, which encouraged Canon to invest a further $30million to keep the company afloat.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIn its existence, Next has sold a total of 50,000 copies of Nextstep, says Jobs. It's not much of an installed base, so he predicts the company will ship 50,000 Nextstep packages in 1993. But Next needs to increase its volume three-fold in order to build enough momentum to forestall Microsoft and Taligent in the object-oriented software business.\n\"UnixWorld\", April 1993\nIn total, 50,000 NeXT machines were sold, including thousands to the then super-secret National Reconnaissance Office located in Chantilly, Virginia. NeXT's long-term plan was to migrate to one of the emerging high-performance Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC) architectures, with the NeXT RISC Workstation (NRW). Initially, the NRW was to be based on the Motorola 88110 processor, but it was later redesigned around dual PowerPC 601s, due to a lack of confidence in Motorola's commitment to the 88000-series architecture in the time leading up to the AIM alliance's transition to PowerPC.\n1993\u20131996: NeXT Software, Inc..\nIn late 1991, in preparation for NeXT's future withdrawal from the hardware industry, the company started porting the NeXTSTEP operating system to Intel 80486-based IBM PC compatible computers. In January 1992, it was demonstrated at NeXTWorld Expo. By mid-1993, the process was completed, and version 3.1 (NeXTSTEP 486) was released.\nNeXTSTEP 3.x was later ported to PA-RISC- and SPARC-based platforms, for a total of four versions: NeXTSTEP/NeXT (for NeXT's own hardware), NeXTSTEP/Intel, NeXTSTEP/PA-RISC, and NeXTSTEP/SPARC. Although the latter three ports were not widely used, NeXTSTEP gained popularity at institutions such as First Chicago NBD, Swiss Bank Corporation, O'Connor and Company, due to its sophisticated \nprogramming model. The software was used by many U.S. government agencies, including the United States Naval Research Laboratory, the National Security Agency, the Advanced Research Projects Agency, the Central Intelligence Agency, and the National Reconnaissance Office. Some IBM PC clone vendors offered somewhat customized hardware solutions that were delivered running NeXTSTEP on Intel, such as the Elonex NextStation and the Canon object.station 41.\nIn 1993, NeXT withdrew from the hardware industry, and the company was renamed to NeXT Software, Inc. Consequently, 230 of the 530 staff employees were laid off. NeXT negotiated to sell its hardware business, including the Fremont factory, to Canon, which later canceled the deal. Work on the PowerPC machines was stopped, along with all hardware production. Sun CEO Scott McNealy announced plans to invest $10million in 1993 and use NeXT software in future Sun systems. NeXT partnered with Sun to create a programming environment called OpenStep, which is NeXTSTEP's application layer decoupled for third party operating systems. In 1994, Microsoft and NeXT collaborated on a port of OpenStep to Windows NT, which was never released.\nIn January 1994, a developers' conference was held in Washington, D.C. Attendees of the 1994 NeXT East Coast Developer Conference had the opportunity to purchase a software bundle including NEXTSTEP 3.2.\nStepstone, originally named Productivity Products International (PPI), was a software company founded in 1983 by Brad Cox and Tom Love, best known for releasing the original version of the Objective-C programming language. In April 1995, NeXT acquired the Objective-C trademark and rights from Stepstone. Stepstone concurrently licensed back from NeXT the right to continue selling its Objective-C based products.\nAfter exiting the hardware business, NeXT focused on other operating systems. New OpenStep products were released, including OpenStep Enterprise for Windows NT. NeXT launched WebObjects, a platform for building dynamic web applications. It did not achieve wide popularity, partly because of the initial high price of $, but it did generate profit for the company. WebObjects is the first and most prominent early example of a web application server that enabled dynamic page generation based on user interactions instead of static web content. WebObjects was used by large businesses including Dell, Disney, Deutsche Bank, the BBC, Ford, and Nissan. After Apple's acquisition of NeXT, WebObjects was used for the iTunes Store and online Apple Store.\n1997\u20132006: Acquisition by Apple.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWe went for one of our, you know, signature Steve Jobs walks around Palo Alto, and ... we happened to see someone who was in that meeting from the [Apple] management team who said, 'You guys won easily, no problem. You have nothing to worry about.'\nAvie Tevanian, presenting NeXT versus Be to Apple\nOn December 20, 1996, Apple Computer announced its intention to acquire NeXT. Apple paid $427million in cash, shares, stock options, and debt.277 Steve Jobs preferred to only receive cash, but Gil Amelio insisted that Steve Jobs take 1.5million Apple shares to give the deal credibility. The main purpose of the acquisition was to use NeXTSTEP as a foundation to replace the dated classic Mac OS. Steve Jobs also returned to Apple as a consultant.\nThe deal was finalized on February 7, 1997.\nIn 2000, Jobs took the CEO position as a permanent assignment, holding the position until his resignation on August 24, 2011, shortly before his death on October 5, 2011.\nSeveral NeXT executives replaced their Apple counterparts when Jobs restructured the company's board of directors. Apple started porting the OPENSTEP for Mach operating system to the PowerPC architecture of Macintosh. The first release of the new operating system was codenamed Rhapsody, with the OPENSTEP-derived API being named \"Yellow Box\". For backward compatibility, Apple added the \"Blue Box\" subsystem to Rhapsody, running existing classic Mac OS applications in a self-contained cooperative multitasking environment. At the same time, an Intel port and OpenStep Enterprise toolkit for Windows were produced.\nA server version of Rhapsody was released as Mac OS X Server 1.0 in 1999, and the first consumer version, Mac OS X 10.0, in 2001. The Yellow Box API was renamed Cocoa and Blue Box was renamed Classic Environment and changed to run applications full-screen without requiring a separate window. Apple included an updated version of the original Macintosh toolbox, called Carbon, allowing applications using it to run natively on the classic Mac OS and on Mac OS X without the constraints of Blue Box. Some of NeXTSTEP's interface features are used in Mac OS X, including the Dock, the Services menu, the Finder's \"Column\" view, and the Cocoa text system.\nNeXTSTEP's processor-independent capabilities were retained in Mac OS X, leading eventually to PowerPC, x86, and ARM versions. Only PowerPC versions were publicly available before 2006; Apple transitioned its Mac computers to Intel processors by August 2006, and discontinued the PowerPC versions of Mac OS X by 2009. An ARM version followed in 2020, and Apple transitioned to ARM processors as of September 2022.\nCorporate culture and community.\nSteve Jobs created a unique corporate culture at NeXT in terms of facilities, salaries, and benefits. Jobs had experimented with some structural changes at Apple, but at NeXT he abandoned conventional corporate structures, instead making a \"community\" with \"members\" instead of employees. There were only two different salaries at NeXT until the early 1990s. Team members who joined before 1986 were paid $ and those who joined afterward were paid $. This caused a few awkward situations where managers were paid less than their employees. Later, employees were given performance reviews and raises every six months. To foster openness, all employees had full access to the payrolls, although few employees ever used the privilege. NeXT's health insurance plan offered benefits to not only married couples but unmarried and same-sex couples, although the latter privilege was later withdrawn due to insurance complications. The payroll schedule was also very different from other Silicon Valley companies at the time, because instead of employees being paid twice per month at the end of the pay period, they were paid once per month in advance.\nJobs found office space in Palo Alto, California, at 3475 Deer Creek Road, occupying a glass-and-concrete building that featured a staircase designed by the architect I. M. Pei. The first floor had hardwood flooring and large worktables where the workstations would be assembled. To avoid inventory errors, NeXT used the just-in-time (JIT) inventory strategy. The company contracted out for all major components, such as mainboards and cases, and had the finished components shipped to the first floor for assembly. On the second floor was office space with an open floor plan. The only enclosed rooms were Jobs's office and a few conference rooms.\nNeXT's expansion prompted renting an office at 800 and 900 Chesapeake Drive, in Redwood City, also designed by Pei. The architectural centerpiece was a \"floating\" staircase with no visible supports. The open floor plan was retained, with furnishings that were luxurious, such as $5,000 chairs, $10,000 sofas, and Ansel Adams prints.\nNeXT's Palo Alto office was subsequently occupied by Internet Shopping Network (a subsidiary of Home Shopping Network) in 1994, and later by SAP AG. Its Redwood City office was later occupied by ApniCure and OncoMed Pharmaceuticals Inc.\nThe first issue of \"NeXTWORLD\" magazine was printed in 1991. It was edited by Michael Miley and, later, Dan Ruby and was published in San Francisco by Integrated Media. It was the only mainstream periodical to discuss NeXT computers and software. The publication was discontinued in 1994 after only four volumes. A developer conference, NeXTWORLD Expo, was held in 1991 and 1992 at the San Francisco Civic Center and in 1993 and 1994 at the Moscone Center in San Francisco, with Jobs as the keynote speaker.\nLegacy.\nThough not very profitable, the company had a wide-ranging impact on the computer industry. Object-oriented programming and graphical user interfaces became more common after the 1988 release of the NeXT Computer and NeXTSTEP. The platform was often held as the trendsetter when other companies started to emulate the success of NeXT's object-oriented system.\nWidely seen as a response to NeXT, Microsoft announced the Cairo project in 1991; the Cairo specification included similar object-oriented user-interface features for a proposed consumer version of Windows NT. Although Cairo was ultimately abandoned, some elements were integrated into other projects.\nBy 1993, Taligent was considered by the press to be a competitor in objects and operating systems, even without any product release, and with NeXT as a main point of comparison. For the first few years, Taligent's theoretical innovation was often compared to NeXT's older but mature and commercially established platform, but Taligent's launch in 1995 was called \"too little, too late\", especially when compared with NeXT.\nSeveral developers used the NeXT platform to write pioneering programs. For example, in 1990, computer scientist Tim Berners-Lee used a NeXT Computer to develop the first web browser and web server. The video game series \"Doom\" and \"Quake\" were developed by id Software using NeXT computers. Other commercial programs were released for NeXT computers, including Altsys Virtuoso\u2014a vector-drawing program with page-layout features, which was ported to Mac OS and Windows as Aldus FreeHand v4\u2014and the Lotus Improv spreadsheet program.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "21699", "revid": "42657186", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21699", "title": "Nineveh", "text": "Ancient Assyrian city\nNineveh was an ancient Near Eastern city of Upper Mesopotamia, located in the modern-day city of Mosul in northern Iraq. It is located on the eastern bank of the Tigris River and was the capital and largest city of the Neo-Assyrian Empire\u2014and potentially the wealthiest city in the ancient world. Today, it is a common name for the half of Mosul that lies on the eastern bank of the Tigris, and the country's Nineveh Governorate takes its name from it.\nIt was the largest city in the world for approximately fifty years until the year 612 BC when, after a bitter period of civil war in Assyria, it was sacked by a coalition of its former subject peoples including the Babylonians, Medes, and Scythians. The city was never again a political or administrative centre, but by Late Antiquity it was the seat of an Assyrian Christian bishop of the Assyrian Church of the East. It declined relative to Mosul during the Middle Ages and was mostly abandoned by the 14th century AD after the massacres and dispersal of Assyrian Christians by Timur.\nIts ruins lie across the river from the historical city center of Mosul. The two main tells, or mound-ruins, within the walls are Tell Kuyunjiq and Tell Nab\u012b Y\u016bnus, site of a shrine to Jonah. According to the Hebrew Bible and the Quran, Jonah was a prophet who preached to Nineveh. Large numbers of Assyrian sculptures and other artifacts have been excavated from the ruins of Nineveh, and are now located in museums around the world.\nThe location of Nineveh was known, to some, continuously through the Middle Ages. Benjamin of Tudela visited it in 1170; Petachiah of Regensburg soon after.\nName.\nThe English placename \"Nineveh\" comes from the Latin ' and the Koine Greek \"Nineu\u1e17\" () under influence of the Biblical Hebrew \"N\u012bn\u0259weh\" (), from the Akkadian ' (var. \"Nin\u00e2\") or \"\". The city was also known as \"Ninuwa\" in Mari; \"Ninawa\" in Aramaic; Ninwe (\u0722\u0738\u0722\u0718\u0735\u0710) in Syriac; and \"Ninawa\" () in Arabic.\n\"Nab\u012b Y\u016bnus\" is the Arabic for \"Prophet Jonah\". \"Kuyunjiq\" was, according to Layard, a Turkish name (Layard used the form \"kouyunjik\", diminutive of \"koyun\" \"sheep\" in Turkish); known as \"Armousheeah\" by the Arabs, it is thought to have some connection with the Qara Qoyunlu dynasty.\nGeography.\nThe remains of ancient Nineveh, the areas of Kuyunjiq and Nab\u012b Y\u016bnus with their mounds, are located on a level part of the plain at the junction of the Tigris and the Khosr Rivers within an area of circumscribed by a fortification wall. This whole extensive space is now one immense area of ruins, roughly a third of these overlaid by the Nebi Yunus suburbs of the city of eastern Mosul.\nThe site of ancient Nineveh is bisected by the Khosr river. North of the Khosr, the site is called \"Kuyunjiq\", including the acropolis of Tell Kuyunjiq; the illegal village of Rahmaniye lay in eastern Kuyunjiq. South of the Khosr, the urbanized area is called \"Nebi Yunus\" (also Ghazliya, Jezayr, Jammasa), including Tell Nebi Yunus, where are the mosque of the Prophet Jonah, and a palace of Esarhaddon/Ashurbanipal below it. South of the street Al-'Asady (made by Daesh by destroying swaths of the city walls) the area is called \"Junub Ninawah\" or Shara Pepsi.\nHistory.\nNeolithic.\nNineveh itself was founded as early as 6000\u00a0BC during the late Neolithic period. Deep sounding at Nineveh uncovered soil layers that have been dated to early in the era of the Hassuna archaeological culture. The development and culture of Nineveh paralleled Tepe Gawra and Tell Arpachiyah a few kilometers to the northeast. Nineveh was a typical farming village in the Halaf Period.\nChalcolithic.\nUbaid period.\nIn 5000 BC, Nineveh transitioned from a Halaf village to an Ubaid village. During the Late Chalcolithic period Nineveh was one of the few Ubaid villages in Upper Mesopotamia which became a proto-city. Others include Ugarit, Brak, Hamoukar, Arbela, Alep, and regionally Susa, Eridu, Nippur. During the period between 4500 and 4000 BC it grew to 40 hectares in size.\nThe greater Nineveh area is notable in the diffusion of metal technology across the near east as the first location outside of Anatolia to smelt copper. Tell Arpachiyah has the oldest copper smelting remains, and Tepe Gawra has the oldest metal work. The copper came from the mines at Ergani.\nUruk period.\nNineveh IV became a trade colony of Uruk during the Uruk Expansion because of its location as the highest navigable point on the Tigris. It was contemporary with, and had a similar function to, Habuba Kabira on the Euphrates. Finds included beveled rim bowls.\nEarly Bronze Age.\nNinevite 5 period.\nThe regional influence of Nineveh became particularly pronounced during the archaeological period known as \"Ninevite 5\", or \"Ninevite V\" (3000/2900\u20132600/2500 BC). This period is defined primarily by the characteristic pottery that is found widely throughout Upper Mesopotamia. Also, for the Upper Mesopotamian region, the \"Early Jezirah\" chronology has been developed by archaeologists. According to this regional chronology, 'Ninevite 5' is equivalent to the Early Jezirah I\u2013II period.\nNinevite 5 was preceded by the Late Uruk period. Ninevite 5 pottery is roughly contemporary to the Early Transcaucasian culture ware, and the Jemdet Nasr period ware. Iraqi Scarlet Ware culture also belongs to this period; this colourful painted pottery is somewhat similar to Jemdet Nasr ware. Scarlet Ware was first documented in the Diyala River basin in Iraq. Later, it was also found in the nearby Hamrin Basin, and in Luristan. It is also contemporary with the Proto-Elamite period in Susa.\nNinevite 5 can be subdivided into the Early Ninevite 5 (3000-2750 BC) characterized by painted pottery and Late Ninevite 5 (2750-2500 BC) with incised pottery. In southern Mesopotamia, the former is contemporary with ED I-II, while the latter mirrors ED II-IIIA.\nAkkadian period.\nIn the late 3rd millennium BC Nineveh was part of the Akkadian Empire. While the site was occupied in that period, there was minimal official Akkadian presence there\u2014unlike at Assur which had a much more notable presence. An Akkadian period bronze statue head found at Nineveh was later determined to be a 7th century addition.\nMiddle Bronze.\nIn the early 2nd millennium BC Nineveh became part of the Kingdom of Upper Mesopotamia during the reign of Shamshi-Adad I (c. 1809\u20131775 BC), Amorite ruler of Ekallatum. It became a center of worship of Ishtar.\nLate Bronze.\nMitanni period.\nThe goddess's statue was sent to Pharaoh Amenhotep III of Egypt in the 14th century BC, by orders of the king Tushratta of Mitanni. Nineveh became one of Mitanni's vassals for half a century until the early 14th century BC.\nMiddle Assyrian period.\nThe Assyrian king Ashur-uballit I reclaimed it in 1365\u00a0BC while overthrowing the Mitanni Empire and creating the Middle Assyrian Empire (1365\u20131050 BC).\nThere is a large body of evidence to show that Assyrian monarchs built extensively in Nineveh during the late 3rd and 2nd millennia BC; it appears to have been originally an \"Assyrian provincial town\". Later monarchs whose inscriptions have appeared on the high city include the Middle Assyrian Empire kings Shalmaneser I (1274\u20131245 BC) and Tiglath-Pileser I (1114\u20131076 BC), both of whom were active builders in Assur (Ashur).\nIron Age.\nNeo-Assyrian period.\nDuring the Neo-Assyrian Empire, particularly from the time of Ashurnasirpal II (ruled 883\u2013859\u00a0BC) onward, there was considerable architectural expansion. Successive monarchs such as Tiglath-pileser III, Sargon II, Sennacherib, Esarhaddon, and Ashurbanipal maintained and founded new palaces, as well as temples to S\u00een, Ashur, Nergal, Shamash, Ninurta, Ishtar, Tammuz, Nisroch and Nabu.\nThe Hebrew Book of Jonah, which was most likely written between 793 and 758 BC, is an account of the city's repentance and Jehovah's mercy which prevented destruction.\nSennacherib's development of Nineveh.\nIt was Sennacherib who made Nineveh a truly influential city (c.\u2009700 BC), as he laid out new streets and squares, and built within it the South West Palace, or \"palace without a rival\", the plan of which has been mostly recovered and has overall dimensions of about . It had at least 80 rooms, many of which were lined with sculpture. A large number of cuneiform tablets were found in the palace. The solid foundation was made out of limestone blocks and mud bricks; it was tall. In total, the foundation is made of roughly of brick (approximately 160\u00a0million bricks). The walls on top, made out of mud brick, were an additional tall.\nSome of the principal doorways were flanked by colossal stone \"lamassu\" door figures weighing up to ; these were winged Mesopotamian lions or bulls, with human heads. These were transported from quarries at Balatai, and they had to be lifted up once they arrived at the site, presumably by a ramp. There are also of stone Assyrian palace reliefs, that include pictorial records documenting every construction step including carving the statues and transporting them on a barge. One picture shows 44 men towing a colossal statue. The carving shows three men directing the operation while standing on the Colossus. Once the statues arrived at their destination, the final carving was done. Most of the statues weigh between .\nThe stone carvings in the walls include many battle scenes, impalings and scenes showing Sennacherib's men parading the spoils of war before him. The inscriptions boasted of his conquests: he wrote of Babylon: \"Its inhabitants, young and old, I did not spare, and with their corpses I filled the streets of the city.\" A full and characteristic set shows the campaign leading up to the siege of Lachish in 701 BC; it is the \"finest\" from the reign of Sennacherib, and now in the British Museum. He later wrote about a battle in Lachish: \"And Hezekiah of Judah who had not submitted to my yoke\u00a0... him I shut up in Jerusalem his royal city like a caged bird. Earthworks I threw up against him, and anyone coming out of his city gate I made pay for his crime. His cities which I had plundered I had cut off from his land.\"\nAt this time, Nineveh comprised about of land, and fifteen great gates penetrated its walls. An elaborate system of eighteen canals brought water from the hills to Nineveh, and several sections of a magnificently constructed aqueduct erected by Sennacherib were discovered at Jerwan, about distant. The enclosed area had more than 100,000 inhabitants (maybe closer to 150,000), about twice as many as Babylon at the time, placing it among the largest settlements worldwide.\nSome scholars such as Stephanie Dalley at Oxford believe that the garden Sennacherib built next to his palace, with its associated irrigation works, was the original Hanging Gardens of Babylon; Dalley's argument is based on a disputation of the traditional placement of the Hanging Gardens attributed to Berossus, together with a combination of literary and archaeological evidence.\nAfter Ashurbanipal.\nThe greatness of Nineveh was short-lived. In around 627\u00a0BC, after the death of its last great king Ashurbanipal, the Neo-Assyrian Empire began to unravel through a series of bitter civil wars between rival claimants for the throne, and in 616 BC Assyria was attacked by its own former vassals, the Chaldeans, Babylonians, Medes, and Scythians. In about 616\u00a0BC Kalhu was sacked, the allied forces eventually reached Nineveh, besieging and sacking the city in 612\u00a0BC, following bitter house-to-house fighting, after which it was razed. Most of the people in the city who could not escape to the last Assyrian strongholds in the north and west were either massacred or deported out of the city and into the countryside where they founded new settlements. Many unburied skeletons were found by the archaeologists at the site. The Assyrian Empire then came to an end by 605\u00a0BC, the Medes and Babylonians dividing its colonies between themselves.\nIt is not clear whether Nineveh came under the rule of the Medes or the Neo-Babylonian Empire in 612. The Babylonian Chronicles concerning the Fall of Nineveh record that Nineveh was \"turned into mounds and heaps\", but this is literary hyperbole. The complete destruction of Nineveh has traditionally been seen as confirmed by the Hebrew Book of Ezekiel and the Greek \"Retreat of the Ten Thousand\" of Xenophon (d.\u00a0354\u00a0BC). There are no later cuneiform tablets in Akkadian from Nineveh. Although devastated in 612\u00a0BC, the city was not completely abandoned. Yet, to the Greek historians Ctesias and Herodotus (c.\u00a0400\u00a0BC), Nineveh was a thing of the past; and when Xenophon passed the place in the 4th century BC he described it as abandoned.\nPersian period.\nThe earliest piece of written evidence for the persistence of Nineveh as a settlement is possibly the Cyrus Cylinder of 539/538 BC, but the reading of this is disputed. If correctly read as Nineveh, it indicates that Cyrus the Great restored the temple of Ishtar at Nineveh and probably encouraged resettlement. A number of cuneiform Elamite tablets have been found at Nineveh. They probably date from the time of the revival of Elam in the century following the collapse of Assyria.\nArchaeologically, there is evidence of repairs at the temple of Nabu after 612\u00a0BC and for the continued use of Sennacherib's palace. There is evidence of syncretic Hellenistic cults. A statue of Hermes has been found and a Greek inscription attached to a shrine of the Sebitti. A statue of Herakles Epitrapezios dated to the 2nd century AD has also been found.\nClassical period.\nThe city was actively resettled under the Seleucid Empire. There is evidence of more changes in Sennacherib's palace under the Parthian Empire. The Parthians also established a municipal mint at Nineveh coining in bronze. According to Tacitus, in AD 50 Meherdates, a claimant to the Parthian throne with Roman support, took Nineveh.\nLate Antiquity.\nBy Late Antiquity, Nineveh was restricted to the east bank of the Tigris and the west bank was uninhabited. Under the Sasanian Empire, Nineveh was not an administrative centre. By the 2nd century AD there were Christians present and by 554 it was a bishopric of the Church of the East. King Khosrow II (591\u2013628) built a fortress on the west bank, and two Christian monasteries were constructed around 570 and 595. This growing settlement was not called Mosul until after the Arab conquests. It may have been called Hesn\u0101 \u02bfEbr\u0101y\u0113 (Jews' Fort).\nIn 627, the city was the site of the Battle of Nineveh between the Eastern Roman Empire and the Sasanians. In 641, it was conquered by the Arabs, who built a mosque on the west bank and turned it into an administrative centre. Under the Umayyad dynasty, Mosul eclipsed Nineveh, which was reduced to a Christian suburb with limited new construction. By the 13th century, Nineveh was mostly ruins and was subsequently absorbed into Mosul. A church was converted into a Muslim shrine to the prophet Jonah, which continued to attract pilgrims until its destruction by ISIL in 2014. In late Ottoman times, the ashlar masonry of the North Palace of Ashurbanipal was quarried to make for the pilons of the Old Bridge over the Tigris. The modern city of Mosul is occasionally referred to as Nineveh, such as during the operation to retake Mosul in 2016\u201317.\nBiblical Nineveh.\nIn the Hebrew Bible, Nineveh is first mentioned in Genesis 10:11: \"Ashur left that land, and built Nineveh\". Some modern English translations interpret \"Ashur\" in the Hebrew of this verse as the country \"Assyria\" rather than a person, thus making Nimrod, rather than Ashur, the founder of Nineveh. The discovery of the fifteen Jubilees texts found amongst the Dead Sea Scrolls has since shown that, according to the Jewish sects of Qumran, Genesis 10:11 affirms the apportionment of Nineveh to Ashur.\nAccording to Nineveh was also the place where Sennacherib died at the hands of his two sons, who then fled to Ararat. The book of the minor prophet Nahum is almost exclusively taken up with prophetic denunciations against Nineveh. Its ruin and utter desolation are foretold in and . In its end was fortold to be strange, sudden, and tragic. According to it was God's doing, his judgment on Assyria's pride. In fulfillment of prophecy, God made \"an utter end of the place\". It became a \"desolation\". In the minor prophet Zephaniah also predicts its destruction along with the fall of the empire of which it was the capital. Nineveh is also the setting of the Book of Tobit.\nThe Book of Jonah ( and ), set in the days of the Assyrian Empire, describes it as an \"exceedingly great city of three days' journey in breadth\", whose population at that time is given as \"more than 120,000\". lists four cities \"Nineveh, Rehoboth, Calah, and Resen\", ambiguously stating that either Resen or Calah is \"the great city\". The ruins of Kuyunjiq, Nimrud, Karamlesh and Khorsabad form the four corners of an irregular quadrilateral. The ruins of the \"great city\" Nineveh, with the whole area included within the parallelogram they form by lines drawn from the one to the other, are generally regarded as consisting of these four sites. The description of Nineveh in Jonah likely was a reference to greater Nineveh, including the surrounding cities of Rehoboth, Calah and Resen The Book of Jonah depicts Nineveh as a wicked city worthy of destruction. God sent Jonah to preach to the Ninevites of their coming destruction, and they fasted and repented because of this. As a result, God spared the city; when Jonah protests against this, God states he is showing mercy for the population who, according to ), are ignorant of the difference between right and wrong (\"who cannot discern between their right hand and their left hand\" and mercy for the beasts in the city.\nNineveh's repentance and salvation from evil can be found in the Hebrew Tanakh, also known as the Old Testament, and referred to in and and Muslim Quran. To this day, Syriac and Oriental Orthodox churches commemorate the three days Jonah spent inside the fish during the Fast of Nineveh. Some Christians observe this holiday fast by refraining from food and drink, with churches encouraging followers to refrain from dairy products, fish and other meats.\nArchaeology.\nCarsten Niebuhr recorded its location during the 1761\u20131767 Danish expedition. Niebuhr wrote afterwards that \"I did not learn that I was at so remarkable a spot, till near the river. Then they showed me a village on a great hill, which they call Nunia, and a mosque, in which the prophet Jonah was buried. Another hill in this district is called Kalla Nunia, or the Castle of Nineveh. On that lies a village Koindsjug.\" In 1820 the site was explored and described by archaeologist Claudius Rich. In 1842, the French Consul General at Mosul, Paul-\u00c9mile Botta, began to search the vast mounds that lay along the opposite bank of the river. While at Tell Kuyunjiq he had little success, the locals whom he employed in these excavations, to their great surprise, came upon the ruins of a building at the 20\u00a0km far-away mound of Khorsabad, which, on further exploration, turned out to be the royal palace of Sargon II, in which large numbers of reliefs were found and recorded, though they had been damaged by fire and were mostly too fragile to remove.\nIn 1847 the young British diplomat Austen Henry Layard explored the ruins. Layard did not use modern archaeological methods; his stated goal was \"to obtain the largest possible number of well preserved objects of art at the least possible outlay of time and money\". In the Kuyunjiq mound, Layard rediscovered in 1849 the lost palace of Sennacherib with its 71 rooms and colossal bas-reliefs. He also unearthed the palace and famous library of Ashurbanipal with 22,000 cuneiform clay tablets. Most of Layard's material was sent to the British Museum, but some was dispersed elsewhere: two large pieces were given to Lady Charlotte Guest and these eventually found their way to the Metropolitan Museum.\nThe work of exploration was carried on by Hormuzd Rassam, George Smith and others, and a vast treasury of specimens of Assyria was incrementally exhumed for European museums. Palace after palace was discovered, with their decorations and their sculptured slabs, revealing the life and manners of this ancient people, their arts of war and peace, the forms of their religion, the style of their architecture, and the magnificence of their monarchs.\nThe mound of Tell Kuyunjiq was excavated again by the archaeologists of the British Museum, led by Leonard William King, between 1902 and 1904. Their efforts concentrated on the site of the Temple of Nabu where another cuneiform library was supposed to exist. However, no such library was ever found: most likely, it had been destroyed by the activities of later residents.\nThe excavations started again in 1927, under the direction of Campbell Thompson, who had taken part in King's expeditions. Some works were carried out outside Kuyunjiq, for instance on the mound of Tell Nebi Yunus, which was the ancient arsenal of Nineveh, or along the outside walls. Here, near the northwestern corner of the walls, beyond the pavement of a later building, the archaeologists found almost 300 fragments of prisms recording the royal annals of Sennacherib, Esarhaddon, and Ashurbanipal, beside a prism of Esarhaddon which was almost perfect.\nAfter the Second World War, several excavations were carried out by Iraqi archaeologists. From 1951 to 1958, Mohammed Ali Mustafa worked the site. The work was continued from 1967 through 1971 by Tariq Madhloom. Some additional excavation occurred by Manhal Jabur from the early 1970s to 1987. For the most part, these digs focused on Tell Nebi Yunus.\nThe British archaeologist and Assyriologist Professor David Stronach of the University of California, Berkeley conducted a series of surveys and digs at the site from 1987 to 1990, focusing his attentions on the several gates and the existent mudbrick walls, as well as the system that supplied water to the city in times of siege. The excavation reports are in progress.\nAfter Mosul\u2019s liberation from the control of the Islamic State (IS), Peter A. Miglus, University of Heidelberg, established a rescue project in 2018, exploring and documenting the intrusive IS tunnels in the Assyrian Military Palace that is located below the destroyed Mosque of the prophet Jonah on Tell Nebi Yunus. Archaeological excavations have been conducted since 2019. Subsequently, an extensive research project, first under the direction of Stefan M. Maul and now of Aaron Schmidt, University of Heidelberg, developed, focusing also on other areas of Nineveh. At Tell Kuyunjiq, activities started in 2021 with rescue and restoration measures for the destroyed reliefs in the throne room wing of the Southwest Palace. Excavations in the North Palace commenced in 2022. Since 2023, work has also been conducted at the Nergal Gate, which was bulldozed by IS. In the lower town, geophysical surveys were carried out north of Kuyunjiq in 2021 and 2023 in preparation of future research on residential areas.\nAn Iraqi\u2013Italian Archaeological Expedition by the Alma Mater Studiorum \u2013 University of Bologna and the Iraqi State Board of Antiquities and Heritage (https://), led by Nicol\u00f2 Marchetti, began (with five campaigns having taken place between 2019 and 2023) a project aiming at the excavation, conservation and public presentation of the lower town of Nineveh. Work was carried out in nineteen excavation areas, from the Adad Gate \u2013 now completely repaired (after removing hundreds of tons of debris from ISIL's 2016 destructions), explored and protected with a new roof \u2013 deep into the Nebi Yunus town. In a few areas a thick later stratigraphy was encountered, but the late 7th century BC stratum was reached everywhere (actually in two areas in the pre-Sennacherib lower town the excavations already exposed older strata, up to the 11th century BC until now, aiming in the future at exploring the first settlement therein). In October 2023 an archaeological park was inaugurated at the site.\nSince 2024, an expedition led by Tim Harrison of the ISAC at the University of Chicago has taken over from the University of Bologna the investigation of the eastern lower town at Nineveh.\nArchaeological remains.\nThe site is marked by two large mounds, Tell Kuyunjiq and Tell \"Nab\u012b Y\u016bnus\" \"Prophet Jonah\", and the remains of the city walls (about in circumference), enclosing a vast lower town extensively encroached by modern buildings. The Neo-Assyrian levels of Kuyunjiq have been extensively explored. The other mound, \"Nab\u012b Y\u016bnus\", has not been as extensively explored because there was an Arab Muslim shrine dedicated to that prophet on the site. On July 24, 2014, the Islamic State destroyed the shrine as part of a campaign to destroy religious sanctuaries it deemed \"un-Islamic\", but also to loot that site through tunneling.\nThe ruin mound of Tell Kuyunjiq rises about above the surrounding plain of the ancient city. It is quite broad, measuring about . Its upper layers have been extensively excavated, and several Neo-Assyrian palaces and temples have been found there. A deep sounding by Max Mallowan revealed evidence of habitation as early as the 6th millennium BC. Today, there is little evidence of these old excavations other than weathered pits and earth piles. In 1990, the only Assyrian remains visible were those of the entry court and the first few chambers of the Palace of Sennacherib. Since that time, the palace chambers have received significant damage by looters and by the removal of the protective roof. Portions of relief sculptures that were in the palace chambers in 1990 were seen on the antiquities market by 1996. Photographs of the chambers made in 2003 show that many of the fine relief sculptures there have been reduced to piles of rubble and a conservation effort ensued. In 2016 Sennacherib's throne room was bulldozed by Daesh and the sculpted fragments were left exposed until 2022.\nTell Nebi Yunus is located about south of Kuyunjiq and is the secondary ruin mound at Nineveh. On the basis of texts of Sennacherib, the site has traditionally been identified as the \"armory\" of Nineveh, and a gate and pavements excavated by Iraqis in 1954 have been considered to be part of the \"armory\" complex. Excavations in 1990 revealed a monumental entryway consisting of a number of large inscribed orthostats and \"bull-man\" sculptures, some apparently unfinished. Following the liberation of Mosul, the tunnels under Tell Nebi Yunus were explored in 2018, in which a 3000-year-old palace was discovered, including a pair of reliefs, each showing a row of women, along with reliefs of \"lamassu\".\nThe ruins of Nineveh are surrounded by the remains of a massive stone and mudbrick wall dating from about 700\u00a0BC. About 12\u00a0km in length, the wall system consisted of an ashlar stone retaining wall about high surmounted by a mudbrick wall about high and thick. The stone retaining wall had projecting stone towers spaced about every . The stone wall and towers were topped by three-step merlons.\nSix of the gateways have been explored to some extent by archaeologists (besides the possible Sin Gate at the north-west end of the site):\nThreats to the site.\nThe site of Nineveh is exposed to decay of its reliefs by a lack of proper protective roofing, vandalism and looting holes dug into chamber floors. Future preservation is further compromised by the site's proximity to expanding suburbs.\nThe ailing Mosul Dam is a persistent threat to Nineveh as well as the city of Mosul. This is in no small part due to years of disrepair (in 2006, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers cited it as the most dangerous dam in the world), the cancellation of a second dam project in the 1980s to act as flood relief in case of failure, and occupation by ISIL in 2014 resulting in fleeing workers and stolen equipment. If the dam fails, the entire site could be under as much as 45 feet (14\u00a0m) of water.\nA major threat to Nineveh has been deliberate human actions by ISIL or Daesh, which occupied the area between 2014 and 2017. In early 2015, they first announced their intention to destroy the walls of Nineveh if the Iraqis tried to liberate the city, and they also threatened the destruction of archaeological heritage and artifacts. On February 26, 2015, video footage shows IS smashing statues and artifacts at the Mosul Museum. They are believed to have plundered others to sell overseas. The items were mostly from the Assyrian exhibit, which Daesh declared blasphemous and idolatrous. There were 300 items remaining in the museum out of a total of 1,900, with the other 1,600 being taken to the National Museum of Iraq in Baghdad for security reasons prior to the 2014 Fall of Mosul. Some of the artifacts sold and/or destroyed were from Nineveh. Just a few days after the destruction of the museum pieces, Daesh terrorists demolished parts of three other major UNESCO world heritage sites, Khorsabad, Nimrud and Hatra. In 2016, Daesh effectively destroyed the Adad Gate (along with the adjoining northern city walls, now cleared by the Iraqi-Italian expedition thanks to the support of the Kaplan Fund), as well as the Mashki Gate (along with the eastern fortifications. The Mashki Gate is in the process of being restored). Daesh also called for intensive new housing in the Kuyunjiq part and opened a large road across the southern part of the site (currently known as Al Asady Road).\nAfter the cultural destruction and between 2014-2019, international efforts by archeologists began recording, evaluating and monitoring the damage and destruction inflicted on sensitive archaeological contexts in Nineveh, using satellite-based remote sensing. The results found that a few high-profile acts of deliberate vandalism were accompanied by much more extensive damage caused by construction and rubbish dumping extending across substantial parts of the site.\nThanks to the activities of the Iraqi-Italian expedition, an archaeological park has been opened at Kuyunjiq since 2023: tourists enter from the Adad gate, subsequently visiting the small Neo-Assyrian palace where the cuneiform library was discovered in 2021, and may then relax in the VW Foundation-funded https:// nearby. The site is still endangered, however, with dumping of debris, illegal settlements and economic activities (such as illegal generators for electricity, pipe companies etc.) as the main threats.\nRogation of the Ninevites (Nineveh's Wish).\nMembers of the Ancient Church of the East, Chaldean Catholic Church, Syriac Catholic Church, Syriac Orthodox Church, Assyrian Church of the East and Saint Thomas Christians of the Syro-Malabar Church observe a fast called \"Ba'uta d-Ninwe\" (\u0712\u0725\u0718\u072c\u0710 \u0715\u0722\u071d\u0722\u0718\u0710) which means \"Nineveh's Prayer\". Copts and Ethiopian Orthodox also maintain this fast.\nIn popular culture.\nEnglish Romantic poet Edwin Atherstone wrote an epic titled \"The Fall of Nineveh\". The work tells of an uprising against king Sardanapalus by all the nations that were dominated by the Assyrian Empire. He is a great criminal who had one hundred prisoners of war executed. After a long struggle, the town is conquered by Median and Babylonian troops, led by prince Arbaces and priest Belesis. The king then sets his own palace on fire and dies inside together with all his concubines.\nAtherstone's friend, artist John Martin, created a painting of the same name inspired by the poem. English poet John Masefield's well-known, fanciful 1903 poem \"Cargoes\" mentions Nineveh in its first line. Nineveh is also mentioned in Rudyard Kipling's 1897 poem \"Recessional\" and Arthur O'Shaughnessy's 1873 poem \"Ode\".\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\u00a0This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain:\u00a0\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "21702", "revid": "15881234", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21702", "title": "Nazareth", "text": "Largest city in the Northern District of Israel\nNazareth is the largest city in the Northern District of Israel. In 2023 its population was 77,208. Known as \"the Arab capital of Israel\", Nazareth serves as a cultural, political, religious, economic and commercial center for the Arab citizens of Israel. The inhabitants are predominantly Arabs, of whom 69% are Muslim and 31% Christian. The city also commands immense religious significance, deriving from its status as the hometown of Jesus, the central figure of Christianity and a prophet in Islam and the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith.\nFindings unearthed in the neighboring Qafzeh Cave show that the area around Nazareth was populated in the prehistoric period. Nazareth was a Jewish village during the Roman and Byzantine periods, and is described in the New Testament as the childhood home of Jesus. It became an important city during the Crusades after Tancred established it as the capital of the Principality of Galilee. The city declined under Mamluk rule, and following the Ottoman conquest, the city's Christian residents were expelled, only to return once Fakhr ad-D\u012bn II granted them permission to do so. In the 18th century, Zahir al-Umar transformed Nazareth into a large town by encouraging immigration to it. The city grew steadily during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when European powers invested in the construction of churches, monasteries, educational and health facilities.\nSince late antiquity, Nazareth has been a center of Christian pilgrimage, with many shrines commemorating biblical events. The Church of the Annunciation is considered one of the largest Christian sites of worship in the Middle East. It contains the Grotto of the Annunciation, where, according to Catholic tradition, angel Gabriel appeared to Mary and announced that she would conceive and bear Jesus. According to Greek Orthodox belief, the same event took place at the Greek Orthodox Church of the Annunciation, also known as the Church of Saint Gabriel. Other important churches in Nazareth include the Synagogue Church, St. Joseph's Church, the Mensa Christi Church, and the Basilica of Jesus the Adolescent.\nEtymology.\nHebrew.\nOne view holds that the name 'Nazareth' is derived from one of the Hebrew words for 'branch', namely , , and alludes to the prophetic, messianic words in Book of Isaiah 11:1: \"from (Jesse's) roots a Branch [] will bear fruit\". One view suggests this toponym might be an example of a tribal name used by resettling groups on their return from exile. Alternatively, the name may derive from the verb , , 'watch, guard, keep\", and understood either in the sense of 'watchtower' or 'guard place', implying the early town was perched on or near the brow of the hill, or, in the passive sense as 'preserved, protected' in reference to its secluded position. The negative references to Nazareth in the Gospel of John suggest that ancient Jews did not connect the town's name to prophecy.\nGreek.\nAnother theory holds that the Greek form (), used in the Gospel of Matthew and Gospel of Luke, may derive from an earlier Aramaic form of the name, or from another Semitic language form. If there were a \"tsade\" (\u05e6) in the original Semitic form, as in the later Hebrew forms, it would normally have been transcribed in Greek with a \"sigma\" (\u03c3) instead of a \"zeta\" (\u03b6). This has led some scholars to question whether \"Nazareth\" and its cognates in the New Testament actually refer to the settlement known traditionally as Nazareth in Lower Galilee. Such linguistic discrepancies may be explained, however, by \"a peculiarity of the 'Palestinian' Aramaic dialect wherein a sade (\u1e63) between two voiced (sonant) consonants tended to be partially assimilated by taking on a zayin (z) sound\".\nArabic.\nThe Arabic name for Nazareth is , and Jesus () is also called , reflecting the Arab tradition of according people an attribution, a name denoting whence a person comes in either geographical or tribal terms. In the Qur'an, Christians are referred to as , meaning \"followers of \", or \"those who follow Jesus of Nazareth\".\nNew Testament references.\nIn the Gospel of Luke, Nazareth is first described as \"a town of Galilee\" and home of Mary. Following the birth and early epiphanial events of chapter 2 of Luke, Mary, Joseph and Jesus \"returned to Galilee, to their own city, Nazareth\".\nThe phrase \"Jesus of Nazareth\" appears seventeen times in English translations of the New Testament, whereas the Greek original contains the form \"Jesus the \" or \"Jesus the .\" One plausible view is that () is a normal Greek adaptation of a reconstructed, hypothetical term in Jewish Aramaic for the word later used in Rabbinical sources to refer to Jesus. \"Nazar\u00e9th\" is named twelve times in surviving Greek manuscript versions of the New Testament, 10 times as or , and twice as . The latter two may retain the 'feminine' endings common in Galilean toponyms. The minor variants, and are also attested. () might be the earliest form of the name in Greek, going back to the putative Q document. It is found in Matthew 4:13 and Luke 4:16. However, the Textus Receptus clearly translates all passages as , leaving little room for debate there.\nMany scholars have questioned a link between \"Nazareth\" and the terms \"Nazarene\" and \"Nazoraean\" on linguistic grounds, while some affirm the possibility of etymological relation \"given the idiosyncrasies of Galilean Aramaic.\"\nExtrabiblical references.\nThe form \"Nazara\" is also found in the earliest non-scriptural reference to the town, a citation by Sextus Julius Africanus dated about AD 221 (see \"Middle Roman to Byzantine Periods\" below). The Church Father Origen (c. AD 185 to 254) knows the forms \"Nazar\u00e1\" and \"Nazar\u00e9t\". Later, Eusebius in his \"Onomasticon\" (translated by St. Jerome) also refers to the settlement as \"Nazara\". The \"na\u0219irutha\" of the scriptures of the Mandeans refers to \"priestly craft\", not to Nazareth, which they identified with Qom.\nThe first non-Christian reference to Nazareth is an inscription on a marble fragment from a synagogue found in Caesarea Maritima in 1962. This fragment gives the town's name in Hebrew as \u05e0\u05e6\u05e8\u05ea (n-\u1e63-r-t). The inscription dates to c. AD 300 and chronicles the assignment of priests that took place at some time after the Bar Kokhba revolt, AD 132\u201335. (See \"Middle Roman to Byzantine Periods\" below.) An 8th-century AD Hebrew inscription, which was the earliest known Hebrew reference to Nazareth prior to the discovery of the inscription above, uses the same form.\nNazarenes, Nasranis, \"Notzrim\", Christians.\nAround 331, Eusebius records that, from the name Nazareth, Christ was called a Nazoraean, and that, in earlier centuries, Christians were once called Nazarenes. Tertullian (Against Marcion 4:8) records that \"for this reason the Jews call us 'Nazarenes'.\" In the New Testament Christians are called \"Christians\" three times (in Acts 11:26; 26:28; and 1 Peter 4:16), but never directly by the Apostle Paul. They are called \"Nazarenes\" once by Tertullus, a Jewish lawyer. The Rabbinic and modern Hebrew name for Christians, \"notzrim\", is also thought to derive from Nazareth, and be connected with Tertullus' charge against Paul of being a member of the sect of the Nazarenes, \"Nazoraioi\", \"men of Nazareth\" in Acts. Against this, some medieval Jewish polemical texts connect \"notzrim\" with the \"netsarim\" \"watchmen\" of Ephraim in Jeremiah 31:6. In Syriac Aramaic \"Nasrath\" (\u0722\u0728\u072a\u072c) is used for Nazareth, while \"Nazarenes\" (Acts 24:5) and \"of Nazareth\" are both \"Nasrani\" or \"Nasraya\" (\u0715\u0722\u0728\u072a\u071d\u0710) an adjectival form. \"Nasrani\" is used in the Quran for Christians, and in Modern Standard Arabic may refer more widely to Western people. Saint Thomas Christians, an ancient community of Christians in India who trace their origins to evangelistic activity of Thomas the Apostle in the 1st century, are sometimes known by the name \"Nasrani\" even today.\nHistory.\nStone Age.\nArchaeological researchers have revealed that a funerary and cult center at Kfar HaHoresh, about two miles () from current Nazareth, dates back roughly 9,000 years to the Pre-Pottery Neolithic B era. The remains of some 65 individuals were found, buried under huge horizontal headstone structures, some of which consisted of up to 3 tons of locally produced white plaster. Decorated human skulls uncovered there have led archaeologists to identify Kfar HaHoresh as a major cult centre in that era.\nBronze and Iron Age.\nThe Franciscan priest Bellarmino Bagatti, \"Director of Christian Archaeology\", carried out extensive excavation of this \"Venerated Area\" from 1955 to 1965. Fr. Bagatti uncovered pottery dating from the Middle Bronze Age (2200 to 1500 BC) and ceramics, silos and grinding mills from the Iron Age (1500 to 586 BC) which indicated substantial settlement in the Nazareth basin at that time.\nGreco-Roman period.\nArchaeological evidence shows that Nazareth was occupied during the late Hellenistic period, through the Roman period and into the Byzantine period.\nAccording to the Gospel of Luke, Nazareth was the home village of Mary as well as the site of the Annunciation (when the angel Gabriel informed Mary that she would give birth to Jesus). According to the Gospel of Matthew, Joseph and Mary resettled in Nazareth after returning from the flight from Bethlehem to Egypt. According to the Bible, Jesus grew up in Nazareth from some point in his childhood. However, some modern scholars also regard Nazareth as the birthplace of the historical Jesus.\nA Hebrew inscription found in Caesarea dating to the late 3rd or early 4th century mentions Nazareth as the home of the priestly Hapizzez/Hafizaz family after the Bar Kokhba revolt (AD 132\u2013135). From the three fragments that have been found, the inscription seems to be a list of the twenty-four priestly courses, with each course (or family) assigned its proper order and the name of each town or village in Galilee where it settled. Nazareth is not spelled with the \"z\" sound but with the Hebrew tsade (thus \"Nasareth\" or \"Natsareth\"). Eleazar Kalir (a Hebrew Galilean poet variously dated from the 6th to 10th century) mentions a locality clearly in the Nazareth region bearing the name Nazareth \u05e0\u05e6\u05e8\u05ea (in this case vocalized \"Nitzrat\"), which was home to the descendants of the 18th Kohen family Happitzetz (\u05d4\u05e4\u05e6\u05e5), for at least several centuries after the Bar Kochva revolt.\nAlthough it is mentioned in the New Testament gospels, there are no extant non-biblical references to Nazareth until around AD 200, when Sextus Julius Africanus, cited by Eusebius (\"Church History\" 1.7.14), speaks of Nazara as a village in Judea and locates it near Cochaba (modern-day Kaukab). In the same passage Africanus writes of \"desposunoi\" \u2013 relatives of Jesus \u2013 who he claims \"kept the records of their descent with great care\". Ken Dark describes the view that Nazareth did not exist in Jesus's time as \"archaeologically unsupportable\".\nJames F. Strange, Professor of Religious Studies at the University of South Florida, notes: \"Nazareth is not mentioned in ancient Jewish sources earlier than the third century AD. This likely reflects its lack of prominence both in Galilee and in Judaea.\" Strange originally calculated the population of Nazareth at the time of Christ as \"roughly 1,600 to 2,000 people\" but, in a subsequent publication that followed more than a decade of additional research, revised this figure down to \"a maximum of about 480.\" In 2009, Israeli archaeologist Yardenna Alexandre excavated archaeological remains in Nazareth that date to the time of Jesus in the early Roman period. Alexandre told reporters, \"The discovery is of the utmost importance since it reveals for the very first time a house from the Jewish village of Nazareth.\"\nOther sources state that during Jesus' time, Nazareth had a population of 400 and one public bath, which was important for civic and religious purposes, as a \"mikva\".\nA tablet at the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale in Paris, dating to AD 50, was sent from Nazareth to Paris in 1878. It contains an inscription known as the \"Ordinance of Caesar\" that outlines the penalty of death for those who violate tombs or graves. However, it is suspected that this inscription came to Nazareth from somewhere else (possibly Sepphoris). Bagatti writes: \"we are not certain that it was found in Nazareth, even though it came from Nazareth to Paris. At Nazareth there lived various vendors of antiquities who got ancient material from several places.\" C. Kopp is more definite: \"It must be accepted with certainty that [the Ordinance of Caesar]... was brought to the Nazareth market by outside merchants.\" Princeton University archaeologist Jack Finnegan describes additional archaeological evidence related to settlement in the Nazareth basin during the Bronze and Iron Ages, and states that \"Nazareth was a strongly Jewish settlement in the Roman period.\"\nIn 2020, Yardenna Alexandre confirmed that Jews from Judea migrated to Galilee and settled in new villages and settlements, including Nazareth, since the late Hellenistic-Hasmonean period (c.\u2009late 2nd century). Under the leadership of priestly families, the Jewish inhabitants observed ritual purity laws. Previously, most of Galilee, except for minor short-lived Israelite settlements in the Na\u1e25al \u1e92ippori basin, had an occupational gap for about 5 centuries because of the Assyrian conquest in 732 BCE. However, there is strong evidence for Assyrian presence in Galilee, based on artefacts in Cana, which was north of Nazareth. Konrad Schmid and Jens Schroter note that Assyrians were typically relocated to conquered territories, which most likely included Israel.\nSome scholars believed Jesus, a native of Nazareth, was influenced by Cynicism, which was popular in Hellenized Galilean cities such as Gadara.\nByzantine period.\nEpiphanius in his \"Panarion\" (c.\u2009AD 375) numbers Nazareth among the cities devoid of a non-Jewish population. Epiphanius, writing of Joseph of Tiberias, a wealthy Roman Jew who converted to Christianity in the time of Constantine, says he claimed to have received an imperial rescript to build Christian churches in Jewish towns and villages where no gentiles or Samaritans dwell, naming Tiberias, Diocaesarea, Sepphoris, Nazareth and Capernaum. From this scarce notice, it has been concluded that a small church which encompassed a cave complex might have been located in Nazareth in the early 4th century\", although the town was Jewish until the 7th century.\nThe Christian monk and Bible translator Jerome, writing at the beginning of the 5th century, says Nazareth was a \"viculus\" or mere village.\nIn the 6th century, religious narrations from local Christians about the Virgin Mary began to spark interest in the site among pilgrims, who founded the first church at the location of the current Greek Orthodox Church of the Annunciation at the site of a freshwater spring, today known as Mary's Well. Around 570, the Anonymous of Piacenza reports travelling from Sepphoris to Nazareth. There he records seeing in the Jewish synagogue the books from which Jesus learnt his letters, and a bench where he sat. According to him, Christians could lift it, but Jews could not, since it disallowed them from dragging it outside. Writing of the beauty of the Hebrew women there, he records them saying St. Mary was a relative of theirs, and notes that, \"The house of St. Mary is a basilica.\" Constantine the Great ordered that churches be built in Jewish cities, and Nazareth was one of the places designated for this purpose, although construction of churches apparently only started decades after Constantine's death, i.e. after 352.\nArchaeologists have unearthed evidence that previous to the erection of the Byzantine-period church at the site of Mary's house in the mid-5th century, Judeo-Christians had built there a synagogue-church, leaving behind Judeo-Christian symbols. Until being expelled in c. 630, Jews probably kept on using their older synagogue, while the Judeo-Christian needed to build their own, probably at the site of Mary's house.\nThe Jewish town profited from the Christian pilgrim trade which began in the 4th century AD, but latent anti-Christian hostility broke out in AD 614 when the Persians invaded Palestine. The Christian Byzantine author Eutychius claimed that Jewish people of Nazareth helped the Persians carry out their slaughter of the Christians. When the Byzantine or Eastern Roman emperor Heraclius ejected the Persians in AD 629\u2013630, he expelled the Jews from the village, turning it all-Christian.\nEarly Muslim period.\nThe Arab Muslim invasion of AD 638 had no immediate impact on the Christians of Nazareth and their churches, since Bishop Arculf remembered seeing there around 670 two churches, one at the house of Joseph where Jesus had lived as a child, and one at the house of Mary where she received the Annunciation \u2013 but no synagogue, which had possibly been transformed into a mosque. The 721 iconoclastic edict of Caliph Yazid II apparently led to the destruction of the former church, so that Willibald found during his pilgrimage in 724\u201326 only one church there, the one dedicated to St. Mary, which Christians had to save through repeated payments from destruction by the \"pagan Saracens\" (Muslim Arabs). The ruins of St. Joseph's remained untouched for a very long time, while the Church St. Mary is repeatedly mentioned throughout the following centuries, including by an Arab geographer in 943.\nCrusader period.\nIn 1099, the Crusader Tancred captured Galilee and established his capital in Nazareth. He was the ruler of the Principality of Galilee, which was established, at least in name, in 1099, as a vassal of the Kingdom of Jerusalem. Later, in 1115, Nazareth was created as a seigneury within the principality. A Martin of Nazareth, who probably acted as viscount of Nazareth, is documented in 1115 and in 1130/1131. Nazareth was the original site of the Latin Patriarch, also established by Tancred. The ancient diocese of Scythopolis was relocated under the Archbishop of Nazareth, as one of the four archdioceses in the Kingdom of Jerusalem. When the town returned to Muslim control in 1187 following the victory of Saladin in the Battle of Hattin, the remaining Crusaders and European clergy were forced to leave town. Frederick II managed to negotiate safe passage for pilgrims from Acre in 1229, and in 1251, Louis IX, the king of France, attended mass in the grotto, accompanied by his wife.\nMamluk period.\nIn 1263, Baybars, the Mamluk Sultan, destroyed the Christian buildings in Nazareth and declared the site off-limits to Latin clergy, as part of his bid to drive out the remaining Crusaders from Palestine. While Arab Christian families continued to live in Nazareth, its status was reduced to that of a poor village. Pilgrims who visited the site in 1294 reported only a small church protecting the grotto. In the 14th century, Franciscan friars were permitted to return and live within the ruins of the basilica.\nOttoman period.\nIn 1584 the Franciscan friars were evicted again from the site of the ruined basilica. In 1620, Fakhr-al-Din II, a Druze emir who controlled this part of Ottoman Syria, permitted them to build a small church at the Grotto of the Annunciation. Pilgrimage tours to surrounding sacred sites were organised by the Franciscans, but the monks suffered harassment from surrounding Bedouin tribes who often kidnapped them for ransom.\nStability returned with the rule of Zahir al-Umar, a powerful Arab sheikh who ruled the Galilee, and later much of the Levantine coast and Palestine. He transformed Nazareth from a minor village into a large town by encouraging immigration to it. Nazareth played a strategic role in Zahir's sheikhdom because it allowed him to wield control over the agricultural areas of central Galilee. He ensured Nazareth's security for other reasons as well, among them strengthening ties with France by protecting the Christian community and protecting one of his wives who resided in Nazareth.\nZahir authorized the Franciscans to build a church in 1730. That structure stood until 1955, when it was demolished to make way for a larger building completed in 1967. He also permitted the Franciscans to purchase the Synagogue Church in 1741 and authorized the Greek Orthodox community to build St. Gabriel's Church in 1767. Zahir commissioned the construction of a government house known as the Seraya, which served as the city's municipal headquarters until 1991. His descendants\u2014known as the \"Dhawahri\"\u2014along with the Zu'bi, Fahum, and 'Onassah families later constituted Nazareth's traditional Muslim elite.\nNazareth's Christian community did not fare well under Zahir's Ottoman successor, Jazzar Pasha (r. 1776\u20131804), and friction increased between its Christians and Muslim peasants from the surrounding villages. Nazareth was temporarily captured by the troops of Napoleon Bonaparte in 1799, during his Syrian campaign. Napoleon visited the holy sites and considered appointing his general Jean-Andoche Junot as the duke of Nazareth. During the rule of Governor Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt (1830\u20131840) over much of Ottoman Syria, Nazareth was opened to European missionaries and traders. After the Ottomans regained control, European money continued to flow into Nazareth and new institutions were established. The Christians of Nazareth were protected during the massacres of 1860 by Aqil Agha, the Bedouin leader who exercised control over the Galilee between 1845 and 1870.\nKaloost Vartan, an Armenian from Istanbul, arrived in 1864 and established the first medical mission in Nazareth, the Scottish \"hospital on the hill\", or the Nazareth Hospital as it is known today, with sponsorship from the Edinburgh Medical Missionary Society. The Ottoman Sultan, who favored the French, allowed them to establish an orphanage, the Society of Saint Francis de Sale. By the late 19th century, Nazareth was a town with a strong Arab Christian presence and a growing European community, where a number of communal projects were undertaken and new religious buildings were erected. In 1871 Christ Church, the city's only Anglican church, was completed under the leadership of the Rev John Zeller and consecrated by Bishop Samuel Gobat.\nIn the late 19th century and the first years of the 20th century, Nazareth prospered as it served the role of a market center for the dozens of rural Arab villages located within its vicinity. Local peasants would purchase supplies from Nazareth's many \"souks\" (open-air markets), which included separate \"souks\" for agricultural produce, metalwork, jewelry and leathers. In 1914, Nazareth consisted of eight quarters: 'Araq, Farah, Jami', Khanuq, Maidan, Mazazwa, Sharqiya and Shufani. There were nine churches, two monasteries, four convents, two mosques, four hospitals, four private schools, a public school, a police station, three orphanages, a hotel, three inns, a flour mill and eight \"souks\". The Ottomans lost control of Palestine, including Nazareth, to the Allied Powers during World War I. The Greek Orthodox Patriarchate invested in properties that further anchored its landholdings in areas of Christian pilgrimage and demographic importance around Nazareth.By then, Nazareth's importance had declined significantly as most of the Arab villages in the Jezreel Valley had been replaced by newly established Jewish communities.\nBritish Mandate period.\nThe United Kingdom gained control of Palestine in 1917, the same year of the Balfour Declaration, which promised British support for the establishment of a Jewish homeland in Palestine. In the years preceding and following the declaration, Jewish immigration to Palestine had been increasing. Representatives of Nazareth opposed the Zionist movement, sending a delegation to the 1919 and issuing a letter of protest in 1920 that condemned the movement while also proclaiming solidarity with the Jews of Palestine. Politically, Nazareth was becoming further involved in the growing Palestinian nationalist movement. In 1922, a Muslim-Christian Association was established in the town, largely sponsored by the Muslim al-Zu'bi family. A consistent and effective united Palestinian Arab religious front proved difficult to establish and alternative organizations such as the Supreme Muslim Council's Organization of Muslim Youth and the National Muslim Association were established in Nazareth later in the 1920s. In 1922 there were 7,424 people (4,885 Christians, 2,486 Muslims and 53 Jews) living in Nazareth with 16 languages spoken (7,035 Arabic, 135 English, 72 French, 43 Hebrew, 42 German, 20 Armenian, 12 Greek, 12 Italian, five Maltese, five Turkish, four Polish, three Yiddish, two Abyssinian, two Magyar, and two Spanish). Nazareth was relatively slow to modernize. While other towns already had wired electricity, Nazareth delayed its electrification until the 1930s and invested instead in improving its water supply system. This included adding two reservoirs at the northwestern hills and several new cisterns. By 1930, a church for the Baptist denomination, a municipal garden at Mary's Well and a police station based in Zahir al-Umar's Seraya had been established and the Muslim Sharqiya Quarter had expanded.\nIn the 1931 census, Nazareth is listed with a population of 8,756 (5,445 Christians, 3,226 Muslims, 79 Jews, five Baha'i, and one Druze) in 1,834 occupied houses with 138 (119 Muslims and 19 Christians) in nearby suburbs in 28 occupied houses.\nIn the 1936\u20131939 Arab Revolt, Nazareth played a minor role, contributing two rebel commanders out of 281 rebel commanders active in the country. The two were Nazareth native and Christian Fu'ad Nassar and Nazareth resident and Indur native Tawfiq al-Ibrahim. The nearby villages of Saffuriya and al-Mujaydil played a more active military role, contributing nine commanders between them. The leaders of the revolt sought to use Nazareth as a staging ground to protest the British proposal to include the Galilee into a future Jewish state. On 26 September 1937, the British district commissioner of the Galilee, Lewis Yelland Andrews, was assassinated in Nazareth by local rebels.\nIn the 1938 village statistics, Nazareth is listed with a population of 9,900 (including 100 Jews) with 161 in nearby suburbs. In the 1945 village statistics, Nazareth is listed with a population of 14,200 (8,600 Christians and 5,600 Muslims).\nBy 1946, the municipal boundary of Nazareth had been enlarged and new neighborhoods, namely Maidan, Maslakh, Khanuq and Nimsawi, were established. New homes were established in existing quarters and the town still had an abundance of orchards and agricultural fields. Two cigarette factories, a tobacco store, two cinemas and a tile factory had been established, significantly boosting Nazareth's economy. A new police station was built on Nazareth's southernmost hill, while the police station in the Seray had been converted into Nazareth's municipal headquarters. Watchtowers were also erected on some of the hilltops around the town. Other new or expanded government offices included a headquarters for the district commissioner at the former Ottoman military barracks, and offices for the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Survey and Settlement.\nNazareth was in the territory allotted to the Arab state under the 1947 UN Partition Plan. In the months leading up to the 1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War, the town became a refuge for Arab-Palestinians fleeing the urban centers of Tiberias, Haifa and Baysan before and during the Haganah's capture of those cities on 18 April 22 April and 12 May 1948, respectively.\nIsrael.\n1948 War.\nNazareth itself was not a field of battle during the 1948 War, which began on 15 May, before the first truce on 11 June, although some of the villagers had joined the loosely organized peasant military and paramilitary forces, and troops from the Arab Liberation Army (ALA) had entered Nazareth on 9 July. The local defense of the town consisted of 200\u2013300 militiamen distributed along the hills surrounding the town. The defense in the southern and western hills collapsed after Israeli shelling, while resistance in the northern hills had to contend with an incoming Israeli armored unit. Not long after the Israelis began shelling the local militiamen, Nazareth's police chief raised a white flag over the town's police station.\nMost of the fighting around Nazareth occurred in its satellite villages, particularly in Saffuriya, whose residents put up resistance until largely dispersing following Israeli air raids on 15 July. During the ten days of fighting which occurred between the first and second truce, Nazareth capitulated to Israeli troops during Operation Dekel on 16 July, after little more than token resistance. By then, morale among local militiamen was low and most refused to fight alongside the ALA because of their perceived weakness in the face of Israel's perceived military superiority and the alleged maltreatment of Christian residents and clergy by ALA volunteers. Seeking to prevent the town's destruction, the Muslim mayor of Nazareth, Yusef Fahum requested a halt to all resistance put up by Nazarenes.\nThe surrender of Nazareth was formalized in a written agreement, whereby the town's leaders agreed to cease hostilities in return for promises from the Israeli officers, including brigade commander Ben Dunkelman (the leader of the operation), that no harm would come to the civilians of the town. Soon after the signing of the agreement, Dunkelman received an order from the Israeli General Chaim Laskov to forcibly evacuate the city's Arabs. He refused, remarking that he was 'shocked and horrified' that he would be commanded to renege on the agreement he, and also Chaim Laskov, had just signed. Twelve hours after defying his superior, he was relieved of his post, but not before obtaining assurances that the security of Nazareth's population would be guaranteed. David Ben-Gurion backed Dunkelman's judgement, fearing that expelling Christian Arabs might provoke an outcry throughout the Christian world. By the end of the war, Nazareth's population saw a large influx of refugees from major urban centers and rural villages in the Galilee.\n1950s\u20131960s.\nIn the first few years of its incorporation into Israel, Nazareth's affairs were dominated by the issues of land expropriation, internally displaced refugees and the hardships of martial law, which included curfews and travel restrictions. Efforts to resolve these issues were largely unsuccessful and led to frustration among the inhabitants, which in turn contributed to political agitation in the city. As the largest Arab town in Israel, Nazareth became a center of Arab and Palestinian nationalism, and because the Communist Party was the sole legal political group that took up many of the local Arab causes, it gained popularity in Nazareth. Arab political organization within Nazareth and Israel was largely stymied by the state until recent decades. Arab and Palestinian nationalist sentiment continue to influence Nazareth's political life.\nIn 1954, 1,200 dunams of Nazareth's land, which had been slated for future urban expansion by the municipality, was expropriated by state authorities for the construction of government offices and, in 1957, for the construction of the Jewish town of Nazareth Illit. The latter was built as a way for the state to counterbalance the Arab majority in the region. Knesset member Seif el-Din el-Zoubi, who represented Nazareth, actively opposed the Absentees' Property Law, which allowed state expropriation of land from Arab citizens who were not permitted to return to their original villages. Zoubi argued that the internally displaced refugees were not absentees as they were still living in the country as citizens and wanted to return to their homes. Israel offered compensation to these internal refugees, but most refused for fear of permanently relinquishing their right of return. Tensions between Nazareth's inhabitants and the state came to a head during a 1958 May Day rally where marchers demanded that refugees be allowed to return to their villages, an end to land expropriation, and self-determination for Palestinians. Several young protesters were arrested for throwing stones at security forces. Martial law ended in 1966.\nOn 5 January 1964, Pope Paul VI included Nazareth in the first ever papal visit to the Holy Land.\n1980s\u20132010s.\nAs of the early 1990s, no city plans drafted by Nazareth Municipality have been approved by the government (both the British Mandate and later Israel) since 1942. This has left many people in Nazareth who vote in the city's municipal elections and receive services from its municipality effectively outside of the city's jurisdiction. Such areas include the Sharqiya and Jabal el-Daula quarters which are in Nazareth Illit's jurisdiction and whose residents had to acquire building permits from the latter city. Similarly, the Bilal neighborhood of the Safafra Quarter is located within Reineh's jurisdiction. In 1993, the residents of Bilal became official residents of Reineh. Nazareth's municipal plans for expansion prior to the establishment of Nazareth Illit, were to the north and east, areas that the latter city now occupy. Arab satellite towns are closely located to the north, west and southwest. Thus, the remaining area within the city's municipal boundaries available for expansion were to the northwest and the south, where the topography restricted urban development. After lobbying the Knesset and the Interior Ministry, el-Zoubi was able to have areas to the northwest of the city annexed to the municipality.\nIn the 1980s, the government began attempts to merge the nearby village of Ilut with Nazareth, although this move was opposed by residents from both localities and the Nazareth Municipality. Ilut's residents were included as part of Nazareth's electorate in the 1983 and 1989 municipal elections, which Ilut's residents largely boycotted, and in the 1988 national elections. Ilut was designated by the Interior Ministry as a separate local council in 1991. The Israeli government has designated a Nazareth metropolitan area that includes the local councils of Yafa an-Naseriyye to the south, Reineh, Mashhad and Kafr Kanna to the north, Iksal and Nazareth Illit to the east and Migdal HaEmek to the west.\nAs the political center of Israel's Arab citizens, Nazareth is the scene of annual rallies held by the community including Land Day since March 1975 and May Day. There are also frequent demonstrations in support of the Palestinian cause. During the First Intifada (1987\u20131993), May Day marchers vocally supported the Palestinian uprising. On 22 December 1987, riots broke out during a strike held in solidarity with the Intifada. On 24 January 1988, a mass demonstration attracted between 20,000 and 50,000 participants from Nazareth and other Arab towns. On 13 May, during a football match in Nahariya, a riot broke out between Arab and Jewish fans, resulting in a Jewish man being stabbed and 54 people, mostly Arabs, being arrested. A rally in Nazareth on 19 May followed, in which thousands of Arabs protested against \"racist attacks\" against the Arab fans and discriminatory policies against Arabs in general.\nPreparations for the Pope's visit to Nazareth in 2000 triggered highly publicized tensions related to the Basilica of the Annunciation. In 1997, permission was granted to construct a paved plaza to handle the thousands of Christian pilgrims expected to arrive. A small group of Muslims protested and occupied the site, where a nephew of Saladin, named Shihab al-Din, is believed to be buried. A school, al-Harbyeh, had been built on the site by the Ottomans, and the Shihab-Eddin shrine, along with several shops owned by the waqf, were located there. Government approval of plans for a large mosque on the property triggered protests from Christian leaders. In 2002, a special government commission permanently halted construction of the mosque.\nIn March 2006, public protests followed the disruption of a prayer service by an Israeli Jew and his Christian wife and daughter, who detonated firecrackers inside the church. The family said it wanted to draw attention to their problems with the welfare authorities. In July 2006 a rocket fired by Hezbollah as part of the 2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict killed two children in Nazareth.\nIn March 2010, the Israeli government approved a $3 million plan to develop Nazareth's tourism industry. New businesses receive start-up grants of up to 30 percent of their initial investment from the Ministry of Tourism.\n2020s.\nRiots broke out in Nazareth during the 2021 Israel\u2013Palestine crisis. In September 2024, a rocket launched by Hezbollah struck the city, and fires broke elsewhere in the city.\nGeography.\nTwo locations for Nazareth are cited in ancient texts: the Galilean (northern) location in the Christian gospels and a southern (Judean) location mentioned in several early noncanonical texts.\nModern-day Nazareth is nestled in a natural bowl which reaches from 320 metres above sea level to the crest of the hills about 488 metres. Nazareth is about 25 kilometres from the Sea of Galilee and about 9 kilometres west from Mount Tabor. The major cities of Jerusalem and Tel Aviv are situated approximately 146 kilometres and 108 kilometres respectively, away from Nazareth. The Nazareth Range, in which the town lies, is the southernmost of several parallel east\u2013west hill ranges that characterize the elevated tableau of Lower Galilee.\nClimate.\nNazareth has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification: \"Csa\").\nDemographics.\nNazareth is the second largest Arab city in Israel. In 2009, the Israel Central Bureau of Statistics reported that Nazareth's Arab population was 69% Muslim and 31% Christian. The greater Nazareth metropolitan area had a population of 210,000, including 125,000 Arabs (59%) and 85,000 Jews (41%). It is the only urban area with over 50,000 residents in Israel where the majority of the population is Arab. The greater Nazareth metropolitan area includes Nof HaGalil, Yafa an-Naseriyye, Reineh, Migdal HaEmek, Ein Mahil, Ilut, Kafr Kanna, Mashhad and Iksal.\nNazareth is home to the largest Arab Christian community in Israel. The Christian communities of Nazareth are varied and includes various denominations, the most prominent among them the Greek Orthodox, Melkite Greek Catholic, Latin Catholics, Maronites, Armenian Orthodox, and Protestants. By far the largest among them is the Greek-Orthodox community, headed by a Patriarch based in Jerusalem, and represented in Nazareth by a Metropolite. The Christian communities in Nazareth tend to be wealthier and better educated compared to other Arabs elsewhere in Israel, and Christians of Nazareth occupy the majority of the top positions in the town: three hospitals and bank managers, judges and school principals and faculties. The socio-economic gap between the Christians wealth and Muslim poverty led sometimes to sectarian crises.\nMany of the descendants of the Zayadina clan in modern-day Israel use the surname 'al-Zawahirah' or 'Dhawahri' in honor of Zahir (whose name is colloquially transliterated as 'Dhaher'). They mostly live in the Galilee localities of Nazareth, Bi'ina, Kafr Manda, and, before its depopulation in the 1948 Arab-Israeli war, the village of Damun. \"Dhawahri\", made up one of the important families in Muslim community of Nazareth, beside the \"Fahoums\", the \"Zu'bis\", and the \"Onallas\".\nDemographic history.\nDuring the late Ottoman era, the religious majority of the city fluctuated. In 1838, there were 325 Christian families (half of whom were Greek Orthodox, the remainder belonged to various Catholic churches) and 120 Muslim families. In 1856, the population was estimated to be 4,350, of which Muslims comprised 52%, while Christians from various denominations comprised 48%. In 1862, the population estimate was lower (3,120) and Christians formed a substantial majority of over 78%. The population grew to 5,660 in 1867 and Christians constituted roughly two-thirds and Muslims one-third of the inhabitants. These estimates during the late Ottoman era likely represented crude figures.\nA population list from about 1887 showed that Nazareth had about 6,575 inhabitants; 1,620 Muslims, 2,485 Greek Catholics, 845 Catholics, 1,115 Latins, 220 Maronites and 290 Protestants.\nFor much of the British Mandatory period (1922\u20131948), Nazareth had a Christian majority (mostly Orthodox Christians) and a Muslim minority.\nIn 1918, Nazareth had an estimated population of 8,000, two-thirds Christian. In the 1922 British census, Nazareth's population was recorded as 7,424 residents, of which 66% were Christian, 33% were Muslim and roughly 1% were Jewish. In the 1931 census, the population grew to 8,756 and the ratio of Muslims increased to 37%. The largest Christian community were the Greek Orthodox denomination, followed by the Roman Catholics and the Melkites. Smaller communities of Anglicans, Maronites, Syriac Catholics, Protestants and Copts also existed.\nIn 1946, Nazareth had a population of 15,540, of whom roughly 60% were Christians and 40% were Muslims. The 1948 War led to an exodus of Palestinians and many expelled or fleeing Muslims from villages in the Galilee and the Haifa area found refuge in Nazareth. At one point, some 20,000 mostly Muslim internally displaced persons were present in the city. Following the war's conclusion, the internally displaced persons of Shefa-'Amr, Dabburiya, Ilut and Kafr Kanna returned to their homes. However, those Muslim and Christian internally displaced persons from the nearby destroyed villages of Ma'lul, al-Mujaydil, Saffuriya, the Haifa-area village of Balad al-Sheikh and the major cities of Acre, Haifa, Tiberias, Safad and Baysan remained as they were not able to return to their hometowns. During the war and in the following months, internally displaced persons from Saffuriya established the Safafra Quarter, named after their former village. Around 20% of Nazareth's native inhabitants left Palestine during the war. In an Israeli army census in July 1948, Nazareth had a total population of 17,118, which consisted of 12,640 Nazarenes and 4,478 internally displaced persons. In 1951, the population was recorded as 20,300, 25% of whom were internally displaced persons. The internally displaced persons came from over two dozen villages, but most were from al-Mujaydil, Saffuriya, Tiberias, Haifa, Ma'lul and Indur.\nToday, Nazareth still has a significant Christian population, made up of various denominations. The Muslim population has grown due to a number of historical factors that include the city having served as administrative center under British rule, and the influx of internally displaced Palestinian Arabs absorbed into the city from neighboring towns during the 1948 Arab-Israeli war.\nEconomy.\nIn 2011, Nazareth had over 20 Arab-owned high-tech companies, mostly in the field of software development. According to the \"Haaretz\" newspaper the city has been called the \"Silicon Valley of the Arab community\" in view of its potential in this sphere.\nReligious sites.\nChristian.\nNazareth is home to dozens of monasteries and churches, many of them in the Old City.\nMuslim.\nMuslim holy sites include\nMuslim places of worship include\nArchaeology.\n\"Venerated area\" near the Basilica of the Annunciation.\nWhile excavations conducted prior to 1931 in the Franciscan \"venerated area\" (the side of the hill known as Jabal Nebi Sa'in, stretching north of the Basilica of the Annunciation) revealed no trace of a Greek or Roman settlement there, later digs under Fr. Bagatti, who acted as the principal archaeologist for the venerated sites in Nazareth, unearthed quantities of later Roman and Byzantine artifacts, attesting to unambiguous human presence there from the 2nd century AD onward. John Dominic Crossan, a noted New Testament scholar, remarked that Bagatti's archaeological drawings indicate just how small the village actually was, suggesting that it was little more than an insignificant hamlet.\nEarly Roman house.\nRemains of a residential house dating to the Early Roman period were discovered in 2009 next to the Basilica of the Annunciation and are on display in the \"International Marian Center of Nazareth\". According to the Israel Antiquities Authority, \"The artifacts recovered from inside the building were few and mostly included fragments of pottery vessels from the Early Roman period (the first and second centuries AD)... Another hewn pit, whose entrance was apparently camouflaged, was excavated and a few pottery sherds from the Early Roman period were found inside it.\" Archaeologist Yardenna Alexandre adds that \"based on other excavations that I conducted in other villages in the region, this pit was probably hewn as part of the preparations by the Jews to protect themselves during the Great Revolt against the Romans in 67 AD\".\nKokh tombs.\nNoteworthy is that all the post-Iron Age tombs in the Nazareth basin (approximately two dozen) are of the kokh (plural \"kokhim\") or later types; this type probably first appeared in Galilee in the middle of the 1st century AD. Kokh tombs in the Nazareth area have been excavated by B. Bagatti, N. Feig, Z. Yavor, and noted by Z. Gal.\nAncient bathhouse at Mary's Well.\nIn the mid-1990s, a shopkeeper discovered tunnels under his shop near Mary's Well in Nazareth. The tunnels were identified as the hypocaust of a bathhouse. Excavations in 1997\u201398 revealed remains dating from the Roman, Crusader, Mamluk and Ottoman periods.\nLocal government.\nNazareth contains a number of official buildings, some of which date back to the Ottoman era in Palestine. One of the most important of these buildings is the Nazareth Brigades, an important historical ruling building from the Ottoman period, built around 1740 by the governor of Galilee, Zahir al-Umar, who took it as his own home and as the Ottoman rule building, from which he supervised security in Marj Ibn Amer. The building housed stables and a prison. The building became the seat of the municipality of Nazareth after the Nakba in 1948 until the beginning of the 1990s, when the municipal headquarters moved to another place in the city.\nMayors.\nSince the establishment of its first municipality in 1875, Nazareth has had a number of mayors, including nine after the establishment of Israel in 1948, in addition to two temporary committees in two different periods.\nEducation.\nWith the near total depopulation of the Palestinian Arabs in the major cities of Haifa and Jaffa as a result of the 1948 war, Nazareth, Kafr Yasif and Rameh became one of a few towns in the newly-established state of Israel to emerge as a central space for Arab culture and politics.\nThree prestigious Arab Christian schools in Nazareth are the St. Joseph's Eclerical School, run by the Melkite Greek Catholic Church, the Nuns of St. Joseph School, a Catholic institution, and the Nazareth Baptist High School, a Protestant institution. About half of students in Nazareth attend Christian schools (10 schools) that are found in the city. Christian schools in Nazareth are among the best schools in the country, and while those schools represent only 4% of the Arab schooling sector, about 34% of Arab university students come from Christian schools. These Arab Christian schools accommodate Christian students, Muslims, Druze from across the country.\nHealthcare.\nThe city has three hospitals, run by the Christian community of Nazareth, and serving its districts:\nSports.\nThe city's main football club, Ahi Nazareth, currently plays in Liga Leumit, the second tier of Israeli football.

They are based at the Ilut Stadium in nearby Ilut.\nOther local clubs are Al-Nahda Nazareth, which currently plays in Liga Bet, and Beitar al-Amal Nazareth, Hapoel Bnei Nazareth and Hapoel al-Ittihad Nazareth, which all play in Liga Gimel.\nTwin towns \u2013 sister cities.\nNazareth is twinned with:\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "21703", "revid": "50843900", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21703", "title": "Noah", "text": "Revered figure in Abrahamic traditions\nNoah (; , also Noach) appears as the last of the Antediluvian patriarchs in the traditions of Abrahamic religions. His story appears in the Hebrew Bible (Book of Genesis, chapters 5\u20139), the Quran and Baha'i writings, and extracanonically.\nThe Genesis flood narrative is among the best-known stories of the Bible. In this account, God \"regrets\" making mankind because they filled the world with evil. Noah then labors faithfully to build the Ark at God's command, ultimately saving not only his own family, but mankind itself and all land animals, from extinction during the Flood. Afterwards, God makes a covenant with Noah and promises never again to destroy the earth with a flood. Noah is also portrayed as a \"tiller of the soil\" who is the first to cultivate the vine. After the flood, God commands Noah and his sons to \"be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth.\"\nThe story of Noah in the Pentateuch is similar to the flood narrative in the Mesopotamian \"Epic of Gilgamesh\", composed around 1800 BC, where a hero builds an ark to survive a divinely sent flood. Scholars suggest that the biblical account was influenced by earlier Mesopotamian traditions, with notable parallels in plot elements and structure. Comparisons are also drawn between Noah and the Greek hero Deucalion, who, like Noah, is warned of a flood, builds an ark, and sends a bird to check on the flood's aftermath.\nBiblical narrative.\nTenth and final of the pre-Flood (antediluvian) Patriarchs, son to Lamech and a mother whose name is unmentioned, Noah is 500 years old before his sons Shem, Ham and Japheth are born.\nGenesis flood narrative.\nThe Genesis flood narrative is encompassed within chapters 6\u20139 in the Book of Genesis, in the Bible. The narrative indicates that God intended to return the Earth to its pre-Creation state of watery chaos by flooding the Earth because of humanity's misdeeds and then remake it using the microcosm of Noah's Ark. Thus, the flood was no ordinary overflow but a reversal of Creation. The narrative discusses the evil of mankind that moved God to destroy the world by way of the flood, the preparation of the ark for certain animals, Noah, and his family, and God's guarantee (the Noahic Covenant) for the continued existence of life under the promise that he would never send another flood.\nAfter the flood.\nAfter the flood, Noah offered burnt offerings to God. God accepted the sacrifice, and made a covenant with Noah, and through him with all mankind, that he would not waste the earth or destroy man by another deluge.\n\"And God blessed Noah and his sons, and said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth\". As a pledge of this gracious covenant with man and beast the rainbow was set in the clouds (ib. viii. 15\u201322, ix. 8\u201317). Injunctions were laid upon Noah: eating of animal food was permitted but not of living animals and the shedding of the blood of man by man was made a crime punishable by death at the hands of man (ib. ix. 3\u20136).\nFurthermore we have:\nThe Seven Laws of Noah (citations to sources are there) as traditionally enumerated in the Babylonian Talmud (Sanhedrin 56a-b) and Tosefta (Avodah Zarah 9:4), are the following:\nNoah, as the last of the extremely long-lived Antediluvian patriarchs, died 350 years after the flood, at the age of 950, when Terah was 128. The maximum human lifespan, as depicted by the Bible, gradually diminishes thereafter, from almost 1,000 years to the 120 years of Moses.\nNoah's drunkenness.\nAfter the flood, the Bible says that Noah became a farmer and he planted a vineyard. He drank wine made from this vineyard, and got drunk; and lay \"uncovered\" within his tent. Noah's son Ham, the father of Canaan, saw his father naked and told his brothers, which led to Ham's son Canaan being cursed by Noah.\nAs early as the Classical era, commentators on Genesis 9:20\u201321 have excused Noah's excessive drinking because he was considered to be the first wine drinker; the first person to discover the effects of wine. John Chrysostom, Archbishop of Constantinople, and a Church Father, wrote in the 4th century that Noah's behavior is defensible: as the first human to taste wine, he would not know its effects: \"Through ignorance and inexperience of the proper amount to drink, fell into a drunken stupor\". Philo, a Hellenistic Jewish philosopher, also excused Noah by noting that one can drink in two different manners: (1) to drink wine in excess, a peculiar sin to the vicious evil man or (2) to partake of wine as the wise man, Noah being the latter. In Jewish tradition and rabbinic literature on Noah, rabbis blame Satan for the intoxicating properties of the wine.\nIn the context of Noah's drunkenness, relates two facts: (1) Noah became drunken and \"he was uncovered within his tent\", and (2) Ham \"saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brethren without\".\nBecause of its brevity and textual inconsistencies, it has been suggested that this narrative is a \"splinter from a more substantial tale\". A fuller account would explain what exactly Ham had done to his father, or why Noah directed a curse at Canaan for Ham's misdeed, or how Noah realised what had occurred. In the field of psychological biblical criticism, J. H. Ellens and W. G. Rollins have analysed the unconventional behavior that occurs between Noah and Ham as revolving around sexuality and the exposure of genitalia as compared with other Hebrew Bible texts, such as Habakkuk 2:15 and Lamentations 4:21.\nOther commentaries mention that \"uncovering someone's nakedness\" could mean having sexual intercourse with that person or that person's spouse, as quoted in Leviticus 18:7\u20138 and 20. From this interpretation comes the speculation that Ham was guilty of engaging in incest and raping Noah or his own mother. The latter interpretation would clarify why Canaan, as the product of this illicit union, was cursed by Noah.&lt;ref name=\"Bergsma/Hahn\"&gt;John Sietze Bergsma/Scott Walker Hahn. 2005. \"Noah's Nakedness and the Curse on Canaan\". \"Journal Biblical Literature\" 124/1 (2005), pp. 25\u201340.&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, Canaan could be the perpetrator himself as the Bible describes the illicit deed being committed by Noah's \"youngest son\", with Ham being consistently described as the middle son in other verses.\nTable of nations.\nGenesis 10 sets forth the descendants of Shem, Ham, and Japheth, from whom the nations branched out over the Earth after the flood. Among Japheth's descendants were the maritime nations (10:2\u20135). Ham's son Cush had a son named Nimrod, who became the first man of might on earth, a hunter, king in Babylon and the land of Shinar (10:6\u201310). From there Ashur went and built Nineveh. (10:11\u201312) Canaan's descendants\u00a0\u2013 Sidon, Heth, the Jebusites, the Amorites, the Girgashites, the Hivites, the Arkites, the Sinites, the Arvadites, the Zemarites, and the Hamathites\u00a0\u2013 spread out from Sidon as far as Gerar, near Gaza, and as far as Sodom and Gomorrah (10:15\u201319). Among Shem's descendants was Eber (10:21).\nThese genealogies differ structurally from those set out in Genesis 5 and 11. It has a segmented or treelike structure, going from one father to many offspring. It is strange that the table, which assumes that the population is distributed about the Earth, precedes the account of the Tower of Babel, which says that all the population is in one place before it is dispersed.\nFamily tree.\nGenesis 5:1\u201332 transmits a genealogy of the Sethites down to Noah, which is taken from the priestly tradition. A genealogy of the Canites from the Jahwistic tradition is found in Genesis 4:17\u201326. Biblical scholars see these as variants on one and the same list. However, if we take the merged text of Genesis as a single account, we can construct the following family tree, which has come down in this form into the Jewish and Christian traditions.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nNarrative analysis.\nAccording to the documentary hypothesis, the first five books of the Bible (Pentateuch/Torah), including Genesis, were collated during the 5th century BC from four main sources, which themselves date from no earlier than the 10th century BC. Two of these, the Jahwist, composed in the 10th century BC, and the Priestly source, from the late 7th century BC, make up the chapters of Genesis which concern Noah. The attempt by the 5th-century editor to accommodate two independent and sometimes conflicting sources accounts for the confusion over such matters as how many of each animal Noah took, and how long the flood lasted.\n\"The Oxford Encyclopedia of the Books of the Bible\" notes that this story echoes parts of the Garden of Eden story: Noah is the first vintner, while Adam is the first farmer; both have problems with their produce; both stories involve nakedness; and both involve a division between brothers leading to a curse. However, after the flood, the stories differ. It is Noah, not God, who plants the vineyard and utters the curse, so \"God is less involved\".\nOther accounts.\nIn addition to the main story in Genesis, the Hebrew Bible (Christian Old Testament) also refers to Noah in the First Book of Chronicles, Isaiah and Ezekiel. References in the deuterocanonical books include the books of Tobit, Wisdom, Sirach, 2 Esdras and 4 Maccabees. New Testament references include the gospels of Matthew and Luke, and some of the epistles (Epistle to the Hebrews, 1 Peter and 2 Peter).\nNoah became the subject of much elaboration in the literature of later Abrahamic religions, including Islam (Surahs 71, 7, 11, 54, and 21 of the Quran) and the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith (Kit\u00e1b-i-\u00cdq\u00e1n and Gems of Divine Mysteries).\nPseudepigrapha.\nThe Book of Jubilees refers to Noah and says that he was taught the arts of healing by an angel, so that his children could overcome \"the offspring of the Watchers\".\nIn 10:1\u20133 of the Book of Enoch (which is part of the Orthodox Tewahedo biblical canon) and canonical for Beta Israel, Uriel was dispatched by \"the Most High\" to inform Noah of the approaching \"deluge\".\nDead Sea scrolls.\nThere are 20 or so fragments of the Dead Sea scrolls that appear to refer to Noah. Lawrence Schiffman writes, \"Among the Dead Sea Scrolls at least three different versions of this legend are preserved.\" In particular, \"The Genesis Apocryphon devotes considerable space to Noah.\" However, \"The material seems to have little in common with Genesis 5 which reports the birth of Noah.\" Also, Noah's father is reported as worrying that his son was actually fathered by one of the Watchers.\nReligious views.\nJudaism.\nThe righteousness of Noah is the subject of much discussion among rabbis. The description of Noah as \"righteous in his generation\" implied to some that his perfection was only relative: In his generation of wicked people, he could be considered righteous, but in the generation of a \"tzadik\" like Abraham, he would not be considered so righteous. They point out that Noah did not pray to God on behalf of those about to be destroyed, as Abraham prayed for the wicked of Sodom and Gomorrah. In fact, Noah is never seen to speak; he simply listens to God and acts on his orders. This led some commentators to offer the figure of Noah as \"the righteous man in a fur coat,\" who ensured his own comfort while ignoring his neighbour. Others, such as the medieval commentator Rashi, held on the contrary that the building of the Ark was stretched over 120 years, deliberately in order to give sinners time to repent. Rashi interprets his father's statement of the naming of Noah (in Hebrew \u2013 Noa\u0127 \u05e0\u05b9\u05d7\u05b7). \"This one will comfort us (in Hebrew\u2013 yeNa\u0126amenu \u05d9\u05b0\u05e0\u05b7\u05d7\u05b2\u05de\u05b5\u05e0\u05d5) in our work and in the toil of our hands, which come from the ground that the Lord had cursed\" Some interpret this as meaning Noah heralded a new era of prosperity, when there was an easing (in Hebrew, na\u0127ah \u05e0\u05d7\u05d4) of the curse from Adam's time, when the Earth produced thorns and thistles even where men sowed wheat. It is said that Noah introduced the plow, symbolizing this relief.\nAccording to the \"Jewish Encyclopedia\", \"The Book of Genesis contains two accounts of Noah.\" In the first, Noah is the hero of the flood, and in the second, he is the father of mankind and a husbandman who planted the first vineyard. \"The disparity of character between these two narratives has caused some critics to insist that the subject of the latter account was not the same as the subject of the former.\"\nThe \"Encyclopedia Judaica\" notes that Noah's drunkenness is not presented as reprehensible behavior. Rather, \"It is clear that ... Noah\u2019s venture into viticulture provides the setting for the castigation of Israel\u2019s Canaanite neighbors.\" It was Ham who committed an offense when he viewed his father's nakedness. Yet, \"Noah\u2019s curse, ... is strangely aimed at Canaan rather than the disrespectful Ham.\"\nMandaeism.\nIn Mandaeism, Noah () is mentioned in of the \"Right Ginza\". In the text, Noah's wife is named as Nuraita (), while his son is named as Shum (i.e., Shem; ).\nChristianity.\n2 Peter 2:5 refers to Noah as a \"preacher of righteousness\". In the Gospel of Matthew and the Gospel of Luke, Jesus compares Noah's flood with the coming Day of Judgement: \"Just as it was in the days of Noah, so too it will be in the days of the coming of the Son of Man. For in the days before the flood, people were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, up to the day Noah entered the ark; and they knew nothing about what would happen until the flood came and took them all away. That is how it will be at the coming of the Son of Man.\"\nThe First Epistle of Peter compares the power of baptism with the Ark saving those who were in it. In later Christian thought, the Ark came to be compared to the Church: salvation was to be found only within Christ and his Lordship, as in Noah's time it had been found only within the Ark. St Augustine of Hippo (354\u2013430), demonstrated in \"The City of God\" that the dimensions of the Ark corresponded to the dimensions of the human body, which corresponds to the body of Christ; the equation of Ark and Church is still found in the Anglican rite of baptism, which asks God, \"who of thy great mercy didst save Noah,\" to receive into the Church the infant about to be baptised.\nIn medieval Christianity, Noah's three sons were generally considered as the founders of the populations of the three known continents, Japheth/Europe, Shem/Asia, and Ham/Africa, although a rarer variation held that they represented the three classes of medieval society \u2013 the priests (Shem), the warriors (Japheth), and the peasants (Ham). In medieval Christian thought, Ham was considered to be the ancestor of the people of black Africa. So, in racialist arguments, the curse of Ham became a justification for the slavery of the black races.\nIsaac Newton, in his religious works on the development of religion, wrote about Noah and his offspring. In Newton's view, while Noah was a monotheist, the gods of pagan antiquity are identified with Noah and his descendants.\nGnosticism.\nAn important Gnostic text, the \"Apocryphon of John\", reports that the chief archon caused the flood because he desired to destroy the world he had made, but the First Thought informed Noah of the chief archon's plans, and Noah informed the remainder of humanity. Unlike the account of Genesis, not only are Noah's family saved, but many others also heed Noah's call. There is no ark in this account. According to Elaine Pagels, \"Rather, they hid in a particular place, not only Noah, but also many other people from the unshakable race. They entered that place and hid in a bright cloud.\"\nDruze faith.\nThe Druze regard Noah as the second spokesman (\"natiq\") after Adam, who helped transmit the foundational teachings of monotheism (\"tawhid\") intended for the larger audience. He is considered an important prophet of God among Druze, being among the seven prophets who appeared in different periods of history.\nIslam.\nNoah is a highly important figure in Islam and he is seen as one of the most significant of all prophets. The Quran contains 43 references to Noah, or \"Nu\u1e25\", in 28 chapters, and the seventy-first chapter, \"S\u016brah N\u016b\u1e25\" (), is named after him. His life is also spoken of in the commentaries and in Islamic legends.\nNoah's narratives largely cover his preaching as well the story of the Deluge. Noah's narrative sets the prototype for many of the subsequent prophetic stories, which begin with the prophet warning his people and then the community rejecting the message and facing a punishment.\nNoah has several titles in Islam, based primarily on praise for him in the Quran, including \"Trustworthy Messenger of God\" ( https://) and \"Grateful Servant of God\" ( https://).\nThe Quran focuses on several instances from Noah's life more than others, and one of the most significant events is the Flood. God makes a covenant with Noah just as he did with Abraham, Moses, Jesus and Muhammad later on ( https://). Noah is later reviled by his people and reproached by them for being a mere human messenger and not an angel ( https://). Moreover, the people mock Noah's words and call him a liar ( https://), and they even suggest that Noah is possessed by a devil when the prophet ceases to preach ( https://). Only the lowest of classes in the community join Noah in believing in God's message ( https://), and Noah's narrative further describes him preaching both in private and public. The Quran narrates that Noah received a revelation to build an Ark, after his people refused to believe in his message and hear the warning. The narrative goes on to describe that waters poured forth from both the earth and the Heavens, destroying all the sinners. Even one of his sons disbelieved him, stayed behind, and was drowned. After the Flood ended, the Ark rested atop Mount Judi (Quran https://).\nAlso, Islamic beliefs deny the idea of Noah being the first person to drink wine and experience the aftereffects of doing so.\nQuran 29:14 states that Noah had been living among the people who he was sent to for 950 years when the flood started.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Indeed, We sent Noah to his people, and he remained among them for a thousand years, less fifty. Then the Flood overtook them, while they persisted in wrongdoing.\nBah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith.\nThe Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith regards the Ark and the Flood as symbolic. In Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed belief, only Noah's followers were spiritually alive, preserved in the ark of his teachings, as others were spiritually dead. The Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed scripture \"Kit\u00e1b-i-\u00cdq\u00e1n\" endorses the Islamic belief that Noah had a large number of companions, either 40 or 72, besides his family on the Ark, and that he taught for 950 (symbolic) years before the flood.\nAhmadiyya.\nAccording to the Ahmadiyya understanding of the Quran, the period described in the Quran is the age of his dispensation, which extended until the time of Ibrahim (Abraham, 950 years). The first 50 years were the years of spiritual progress, which were followed by 900 years of spiritual deterioration of the people of Noah.\nComparative mythology.\nIndian and Greek flood-myths also exist, although there is little evidence that they were derived from the Mesopotamian flood-myth that underlies the biblical account.\nMesopotamian.\nThe Noah story of the Pentateuch is quite similar to a flood story contained in the Mesopotamian \"Epic of Gilgamesh\", composed c.\u20091800 BCE. In the Gilgamesh version, the Mesopotamian gods decide to send a great flood to destroy mankind. Various correlations between the stories of Noah and Gilgamesh (the flood, the construction of the ark, the salvation of animals, and the release of birds following the flood) have led to this story being seen as the source for the story of Noah. The few variations include the number of days of the deluge, the order of the birds, and the name of the mountain on which the ark rests. The flood story in Genesis 6\u20138 matches the Gilgamesh flood myth so closely that \"few doubt that [it] derives from a Mesopotamian account.\" What is particularly noticeable is the way the Genesis flood story follows the Gilgamesh flood tale \"point by point and in the same order\", even when the story permits other alternatives.\nThe earliest written flood myth is found in the Mesopotamian epic of Atra-Hasis and \"Epic of Gilgamesh\" texts. The \"Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica\" says \"These mythologies are the source of such features of the biblical Flood story as the building and provisioning of the ark, its flotation, and the subsidence of the waters, as well as the part played by the human protagonist.\" The \"Encyclopedia Judaica\" adds that there is a strong suggestion that \"an intermediate agent was active. The people most likely to have fulfilled this role are the Hurrians, whose territory included the city of Harran, where the Patriarch Abraham had his roots. The Hurrians inherited the Flood story from Babylonia\".\nThe encyclopedia mentions another similarity between the stories: Noah is the tenth patriarch and Berossus notes that \"the hero of the great flood was Babylonia's tenth antediluvian king.\" However, there is a discrepancy in the ages of the heroes. For the Mesopotamian antecedents, \"the reigns of the antediluvian kings range from 18,600 to nearly 65,000 years.\" In the Bible, the lifespans \"fall far short of the briefest reign mentioned in the related Mesopotamian texts.\" Also, the name of the hero differs between the traditions: \"The earliest Mesopotamian flood account, written in the Sumerian language, calls the deluge hero Ziusudra.\"\nHowever, Yi Samuel Chen writes that the oldest versions of the \"Epic of Gilgamesh\" never mentioned the flood, just mentioning that he went to talk to Utnapishtim to find the secret of immortality. Starting with the Old Babylonian Period, there were attempts to syncretize Utnapishtim with Ziusudra, even though they were previously seen as different figures. Gilgamesh meeting the flood hero was first alluded to in the Old Babylonian Period in \"The Death of Gilgamesh\" and eventually was imported and standardized in the Epic of Gilgamesh probably in the Middle Babylonian Period.\nGilgamesh's historical reign is believed to have been approximately 2700 BC, shortly before the earliest known written stories. The discovery of artifacts associated with Aga and Enmebaragesi of Kish, two other kings named in the stories, has lent credibility to the historical existence of Gilgamesh.\nThe earliest Sumerian Gilgamesh poems date from as early as the Third dynasty of Ur (2100\u20132000 BC). One of these poems mentions Gilgamesh's journey to meet the flood hero, as well as a short version of the flood story, although Chen writes that his was included in texts written during the Old Babylonian Period. The earliest Akkadian versions of the unified epic are dated to c. 2000\u20131700 BC. Due to the fragmentary nature of these Old Babylonian versions, it is unclear whether they included an expanded account of the flood myth; although one fragment definitely includes the story of Gilgamesh's journey to meet Utnapishtim. The \"standard\" Akkadian version included a long version of the flood story and was edited by Sin-liqe-unninni sometime between 1300 and 1000 BC.\nYi Samuel Chen, analyzing various texts from the Early Dynastic III Period to the Old Babylonian Period, argues that the flood narrative was only added in texts written during the latter Old Babylonian Period. Observations by experts indicate that the portions of the Sumerian King List which mention the time before the flood are stylistically different from the King List Proper. Chen writes that Old Babylonian copies tend to show a separate pre-flood tradition which is apart from the King List. Further, the Ur III copy of the King List as well as similar documents indicate that the King List Proper once existed independent of a flood narrative or a pre-flood tradition. Chen provides evidence that the sections of the Sumerian King List that mention references to the flood were all later additions added during the Old Babylonian Period through later updates and edits. The Flood as a watershed in early history of the world was probably a new historiographical concept emerging in the Mesopotamian literary traditions during the Old Babylonian Period, as evident by the fact that the flood motif didn't show up in the Ur III copy and that the earliest chronographical sources related to the flood show up in the Old Babylonian Period. Chen concludes that the name of Ziusudra as a flood hero, as well as any hinted references of a flood, in the Old Babylonian Version of the Instructions of Shuruppak were later developments during the Old Babylonian Period, originating from updated information added to the text from the burgeoning Antediluvian Tradition.\nAncient Greek.\nNoah has often been compared to Deucalion, the son of Prometheus and Hesinoe in Greek mythology. Like Noah, Deucalion is warned of the flood (by Zeus and Poseidon); he builds an ark and staffs it with creatures \u2013 and when he completes his voyage, gives thanks and takes advice from the gods on how to repopulate the Earth. Deucalion also sends a pigeon to find out about the situation of the world and the bird returns with an olive branch. Deucalion, in some versions of the myth, also becomes the inventor of wine, like Noah. Philo and Justin equate Deucalion with Noah, and Josephus used the story of Deucalion as evidence that the flood actually occurred and that, therefore, Noah existed.\nThe motif of a weather deity who headed the pantheon causing the great flood and then the trickster who created men from clay saving man is also present in Sumerian mythology, as Enlil, instead of Zeus, causes the flood, and Enki, rather than Prometheus, saves man. Stephanie West has written that this is perhaps due to the Greeks borrowing stories from the Near East.\nVar in Zoroastrianism.\nIn Videvdad 29 and 37, mythical Iranian king Y\u012bm\u0101, was ordered by Ahura Mazd\u0101 to build a subterranean enclosure known as Var, which had a function similar to Noah\u2019s Ark, he was instructed to gather plants, animals, and humans with some exceptions.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nGeneral and cited references.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Faroese and Icelandic are not mutually intelligible with Norwegian in their spoken form because continental Scandinavian has diverged from them. While the two Germanic languages with the greatest numbers of speakers, English and German, have close similarities with Norwegian, neither is mutually intelligible with it. Norwegian is a descendant of Old Norse, the common language of the Germanic peoples living in Scandinavia during the Viking Age.\nToday there are two official forms of \"written\" Norwegian, (Riksm\u00e5l) and (Landsm\u00e5l), each with its own variants. developed from the Dano-Norwegian language that replaced Middle Norwegian as the elite language after the union of Denmark\u2013Norway in the 16th and 17th centuries and then evolved in Norway, while was developed based upon a collective of spoken Norwegian dialects. Norwegian is one of the two official languages in Norway, along with S\u00e1mi, a group of Finno-Ugric languages spoken by less than one percent of the population. Norwegian is one of the working languages of the Nordic Council. Under the Nordic Language Convention, citizens of the Nordic countries who speak Norwegian have the opportunity to use it when interacting with official bodies in other Nordic countries without being liable for any interpretation or translation costs.\nHistory.\nOrigins.\nLike most of the languages in Europe, Norwegian derives from Proto-Indo-European. As early Indo-Europeans spread across Europe, they became isolated from each other and new languages developed. In northwest Europe, the Germanic languages evolved, further branching off into the North Germanic languages, of which Norwegian is one.\nProto-Norse is thought to have evolved as a northern dialect of Proto-Germanic during the first centuries AD in what is today Southern Sweden. It is the earliest stage of a characteristically North Germanic language, and the language attested in the Elder Futhark inscriptions, the oldest form of the runic alphabets. A number of inscriptions are memorials to the dead, while others are magical in content. The oldest are carved on loose objects, while later ones are chiseled in runestones. They are the oldest written record of any Germanic language.\nAround 800 AD, the script was simplified to the Younger Futhark, and inscriptions became more abundant. At the same time, the beginning of the Viking Age led to the spread of Old Norse to Iceland, Greenland, and the Faroe Islands. Viking colonies also existed in parts of the British Isles, France (Normandy), North America, and Kievan Rus. In all of these places except Iceland and the Faroes, Old Norse speakers went extinct or were absorbed into the local population.\nThe Latin alphabet.\nAround 1030, Christianity came to Scandinavia, bringing with it an influx of Latin borrowings and the Latin alphabet. These new words were related to church practices and ceremonies, although many other loanwords related to general culture also entered the language.\nThe Scandinavian languages at this time are not considered to be separate languages, although there were minor differences among what are customarily called Old Icelandic, Old Norwegian, Old Gutnish, Old Danish, and Old Swedish.\nLow German influence.\nThe economic and political dominance of the Hanseatic League between 1250 and 1450 in the main Scandinavian cities brought large Middle Low German\u2013speaking populations to Norway. The influence of their language on Scandinavian is comparable with that of French on English after the Norman conquest.\nDecline of written Norwegian.\nIn the late Middle Ages, dialects began to develop in Scandinavia because the population was rural and little travel occurred. When the Reformation came from Germany, Martin Luther's High German translation of the Bible was quickly translated into Swedish, Danish, and Icelandic. Norway entered a union with Denmark in 1397 and Danish, over time, replaced Middle Norwegian as the language of the elite, the church, literature, and the law. When the union with Denmark ended in 1814, the Dano-Norwegian \"koin\u00e9\" had become the mother tongue of around 1% of the population.\nDanish to Norwegian standardisation.\nFrom the 1840s, some writers experimented with a Norwegianised form of written Danish. Knud Knudsen proposed to change spelling and inflection in accordance with the Dano-Norwegian \"koin\u00e9\", known as \"cultivated everyday speech.\" A small adjustment in this direction was implemented in the first official reform of the Danish language in Norway in 1862 and more extensively after his death in two official reforms in 1907 and 1917.\nMeanwhile, a nationalistic movement strove for the development of a new written Norwegian. Ivar Aasen, a botanist and self-taught linguist, began his work to create a new Norwegian language at the age of 22. He traveled around the country collecting words and examples of grammar from the dialects and comparing the dialects among the different regions. He examined the development of Icelandic, which had largely escaped the influences under which Norwegian had come. He called his work, which was published in several books from 1848 to 1873, Landsm\u00e5l, meaning 'national language'. The name \"Landsm\u00e5l\" is sometimes interpreted as 'rural language' or 'country language', but this was clearly not Aasen's intended meaning.\nThe name of the Danish language in Norway was a topic of hot dispute throughout the 19th century. Its proponents claimed that it was a language common to Norway and Denmark, and no more Danish than Norwegian. The proponents of Landsm\u00e5l thought that the Danish character of the language should not be concealed. In 1899, Bj\u00f8rnstjerne Bj\u00f8rnson proposed the neutral name \"Riksm\u00e5l\", meaning 'national language' like \"Landsm\u00e5l\", and this was officially adopted along with the 1907 spelling reform. The name \"Riksm\u00e5l\" is sometimes interpreted as 'state language', but this meaning is secondary at best. (Compare to Danish \"rigsm\u00e5l\" from where the name was borrowed.)\nAfter the personal union with Sweden was dissolved in 1905, both languages were developed further and reached what is now considered their classic forms after a reform in 1917. Riksm\u00e5l was, in 1929, officially renamed \"Bokm\u00e5l\" (literally 'book language'), and Landsm\u00e5l to \"Nynorsk\" (literally 'new Norwegian'). A proposition to substitute Danish-Norwegian () for \"Bokm\u00e5l\" lost in parliament by a single vote. The name \"Nynorsk\", the linguistic term for modern Norwegian, was chosen to contrast with Danish and emphasise the historical connection to Old Norwegian. Today, this meaning is often lost, and it is commonly mistaken as a \"new\" Norwegian in contrast to the \"real\" Norwegian Bokm\u00e5l.\nBokm\u00e5l and Nynorsk were made closer by a reform in 1938. This was a result of a state policy to merge Nynorsk and Bokm\u00e5l into a single language, to be called \"Samnorsk\". A 1946 poll showed that this policy was supported by 79% of Norwegians at the time. However, opponents of the official policy still managed to create a massive protest movement against \"Samnorsk\" in the 1950s, fighting in particular the use of \"radical\" forms in Bokm\u00e5l text books in schools. In the reform in 1959, the 1938 reform was partially reversed in Bokm\u00e5l, but Nynorsk was changed further towards Bokm\u00e5l. Since then Bokm\u00e5l has reverted even further toward traditional Riksm\u00e5l, while Nynorsk still adheres to the 1959 standard. Therefore, a small minority of Nynorsk enthusiasts use a more conservative standard called H\u00f8gnorsk. The Samnorsk policy had little influence after 1960, and was officially abandoned in 2002.\nPhonology.\nWhile the sound systems of Norwegian and Swedish are similar, considerable variation exists among the dialects.\nConsonants.\nThe retroflex consonants only appear in East Norwegian dialects as a result of sandhi, combining with , , , , and .\nThe realization of the rhotic depends on the dialect. In Eastern, Central, and Northern Norwegian dialects, it is a flap , whereas in Western and Southern Norway, and for some speakers also in Eastern Norway, it is uvular or . And in the dialects of North-Western Norway, it is realized as , much like the trilled \u27e8rr\u27e9 of Spanish.\nAccent.\nNorwegian is a pitch-accent language with two distinct pitch patterns, like Swedish. They are used to differentiate two-syllable words with otherwise identical pronunciation. For example, in many East Norwegian dialects, the word ('farmers') is pronounced using the simpler tone 1, while ('beans' or 'prayers') uses the more complex tone 2. Though spelling differences occasionally differentiate written words, in most cases the minimal pairs are written alike, since written Norwegian has no explicit accent marks. In most eastern low-tone dialects, accent 1 uses a low flat pitch in the first syllable, while accent 2 uses a high, sharply falling pitch in the first syllable and a low pitch in the beginning of the second syllable. In both accents, these pitch movements are followed by a rise of intonational nature (phrase accent)\u2014the size (and presence) of which signals emphasis or focus, and corresponds in function to the normal accent in languages that lack lexical tone, such as English. That rise culminates in the final syllable of an accentual phrase, while the utterance-final fall common in most languages is either very small or absent.\nThere are significant variations in pitch accent between dialects. Thus, in most of western and northern Norway (the so-called high-pitch dialects) accent 1 is falling, while accent 2 is rising in the first syllable and falling in the second syllable or somewhere around the syllable boundary. The pitch accents (as well as the peculiar phrase accent in the low-tone dialects) give the Norwegian language a \"singing\" quality that makes it easy to distinguish from other languages. Accent 1 generally occurs in words that were monosyllabic in Old Norse, and accent 2 in words that were polysyllabic.\nWritten language.\nAlphabet.\nThe Norwegian alphabet has 29 letters.\nThe letters \"c\", \"q\", \"w\", \"x\" and \"z\" are only used in loanwords. As loanwords are assimilated into Norwegian, their spelling might change to reflect Norwegian pronunciation and the principles of Norwegian orthography, e.g. \"zebra\" in Norwegian is written . Due to historical reasons, some otherwise Norwegian family names are also written using these letters.\nSome letters may be modified by diacritics: \"\u00e9\", \"\u00e8\", \"\u00ea\", \"\u00f3\", \"\u00f2\", and \"\u00f4\". In Nynorsk, \"\u00ec\" and \"\u00f9\" and \"\u1ef3\" are occasionally seen as well. The diacritics are not compulsory, but may in a few cases distinguish between different meanings of the word, e.g.: ('for/to'), ('went'), ('furrow') and ('fodder'). Loanwords may be spelled with other diacritics, most notably \"\u00ef, \u00fc\", \"\u00e1\" and \"\u00e0\".\nBokm\u00e5l and Nynorsk.\nThe two legally recognized forms of \"written\" Norwegian are \"Bokm\u00e5l\" (literally 'book tongue') and \"Nynorsk\" ('new Norwegian'), which are regulated by the Language Council of Norway (). Two other written forms without official status also exist. One, called \"Riksm\u00e5l\" ('national language'), is today to a large extent the same language as Bokm\u00e5l though somewhat closer to the Danish language. It is regulated by the unofficial Norwegian Academy, which translates the name as 'Standard Norwegian'. The other is \"H\u00f8gnorsk\" ('High Norwegian'), a more purist form of Nynorsk, which maintains the language in an original form as given by Ivar Aasen and rejects most of the reforms from the 20th century; this form has limited use.\nNynorsk and Bokm\u00e5l provide standards for how to write Norwegian, but not for how to speak the language. No standard of spoken Norwegian is officially sanctioned, and most Norwegians speak their own dialects in all circumstances. Thus, unlike in many other countries, the use of any Norwegian dialect, whether it coincides with the written norms or not, is accepted as correct \"spoken\" Norwegian. However, in areas where East Norwegian dialects are used, a tendency exists to accept a de facto spoken standard for this particular regional dialect, Urban East Norwegian or Standard East Norwegian (), in which the vocabulary coincides with Bokm\u00e5l. Outside Eastern Norway, this spoken variation is not used.\nFrom the 16th to the 19th centuries, Danish was the standard written language of Norway. As a result, the development of modern written Norwegian has been subject to strong controversy related to nationalism, rural versus urban discourse, and Norway's literary history. Historically, Bokm\u00e5l is a Norwegianised variety of Danish, while Nynorsk is a language form based on Norwegian dialects and puristic opposition to Danish. The now-abandoned official policy to merge Bokm\u00e5l and Nynorsk into one common language called \"Samnorsk\" through a series of spelling reforms has created a wide spectrum of varieties of both Bokm\u00e5l and Nynorsk. The unofficial form known as \"Riksm\u00e5l\" is considered more conservative than Bokm\u00e5l and is far closer to Danish while the unofficial \"H\u00f8gnorsk\" is more conservative than Nynorsk and is far closer to Faroese, Icelandic and Old Norse.\nNorwegians are educated in both Bokm\u00e5l and Nynorsk. Each student gets assigned a native form based on which school they go to, whence the other form (known as ) will be a mandatory school subject from elementary school through high school. For instance, a Norwegian whose main language form is Bokm\u00e5l will study Nynorsk as a mandatory subject throughout both elementary and high school. A 2005 poll indicates that 86.3% use primarily Bokm\u00e5l as their daily written language, 5.5% use both Bokm\u00e5l and Nynorsk, and 7.5% use primarily Nynorsk. Broadly speaking, Nynorsk writing is widespread in western Norway, though not in major urban areas, and also in the upper parts of mountain valleys in the southern and eastern parts of Norway. Examples are Setesdal, the western part of Telemark county () and several municipalities in Hallingdal, Valdres, and Gudbrandsdalen. It is little used elsewhere, but 30\u201340 years ago, it also had strongholds in many rural parts of Tr\u00f8ndelag (mid-Norway) and the southern part of northern Norway (Nordland county). Today, Nynorsk is the official language of not only four of the nineteen Norwegian counties but also various municipalities in five other counties. NRK, the Norwegian broadcasting corporation, broadcasts in both Bokm\u00e5l and Nynorsk, and all governmental agencies are required to support both written languages. Bokm\u00e5l is used in 92% of all written publications, and Nynorsk in 8% (2000).\nLike some other European countries, Norway has an official \"advisory board\"\u2014 Spr\u00e5kr\u00e5det (Norwegian Language Council)\u2014 that determines, after approval from the Ministry of Culture, official spelling, grammar, and vocabulary for the Norwegian language. The board's work has been subject to considerable controversy throughout the years.\nBoth Nynorsk and Bokm\u00e5l have a great variety of optional forms. The Bokm\u00e5l that uses the forms that are close to Riksm\u00e5l is called \"moderate\" or \"conservative\", depending on one's viewpoint, while the Bokm\u00e5l that uses the forms that are close to Nynorsk is called \"radical\". Nynorsk has forms that are close to the original Landsm\u00e5l and forms that are close to Bokm\u00e5l.\nRiksm\u00e5l.\nOpponents of the spelling reforms aimed at bringing Bokm\u00e5l closer to Nynorsk have retained the name Riksm\u00e5l and employ spelling and grammar that predate the Samnorsk movement. Riksm\u00e5l and conservative versions of Bokm\u00e5l have been the \"de facto\" standard written language of Norway for most of the 20th century, being used by large newspapers, encyclopedias, and a significant proportion of the population of the capital Oslo, surrounding areas, and other urban areas, as well as much of the literary tradition. Since the reforms of 1981 and 2003 (effective in 2005), the official Bokm\u00e5l can be adapted to be almost identical with modern Riksm\u00e5l. The differences between written Riksm\u00e5l and Bokm\u00e5l are comparable to American and British English differences.\nRiksm\u00e5l is regulated by the Norwegian Academy, which determines acceptable spelling, grammar, and vocabulary.\nH\u00f8gnorsk.\nThere is also an unofficial form of Nynorsk, called \"H\u00f8gnorsk\", discarding the post-1917 reforms, and thus close to Ivar Aasen's original Landsm\u00e5l. It is supported by Ivar Aasen-sambandet, but has found no widespread use.\nCurrent usage.\nIn 2010, 86.5% of the pupils in the primary and lower secondary schools in Norway receive education in Bokm\u00e5l, while 13.0% receive education in Nynorsk. From the eighth grade onwards, pupils are required to learn both. Out of the 431 municipalities in Norway, 161 have declared that they wish to communicate with the central authorities in Bokm\u00e5l, 116 (representing 12% of the population) in Nynorsk, while 156 are neutral. Of 4,549 state publications in 2000, 8% were in Nynorsk, and 92% in Bokm\u00e5l. The large national newspapers (, and \"VG\") are published in Bokm\u00e5l or Riksm\u00e5l. Some major regional newspapers (including and \"Stavanger Aftenblad\"), many political journals, and many local newspapers use both Bokm\u00e5l and Nynorsk.\nA newer trend is to write in dialect for informal use. When writing an SMS, Facebook update, or fridge note, many people, especially young ones, write approximations of the way they talk rather than using Bokm\u00e5l or Nynorsk.\nDialects.\nThere is general agreement that a wide range of differences makes it difficult to estimate the number of different Norwegian dialects. Variations in grammar, syntax, vocabulary, and pronunciation cut across geographical boundaries and can create a distinct dialect at the level of farm clusters. Dialects are in some cases so dissimilar as to be unintelligible to unfamiliar listeners. Many linguists note a trend toward regionalization of dialects that diminishes the differences at such local levels; there is, however, a renewed interest in preserving dialects.\nGrammar.\nNouns.\nNorwegian nouns are inflected for number (singular/plural) and for definiteness (indefinite/definite). In a few dialects, definite nouns are also inflected for the dative case.\nNorwegian nouns belong to three noun classes (genders): masculine, feminine and neuter. All feminine nouns can optionally be inflected using masculine noun class morphology in Bokm\u00e5l due to its Danish heritage. In comparison, the use of all three genders (including the feminine) is mandatory in Nynorsk.\nAll Norwegian dialects have traditionally retained all the three grammatical genders from Old Norse to some extent. The only exceptions are the dialect of Bergen and a few upper class sociolects at the west end of Oslo that have completely lost the feminine gender.\nAccording to Marit Westergaard, approximately 80% of nouns in Norwegian are masculine.\nNorwegian and other Scandinavian languages use a suffix to indicate definiteness of a noun, unlike English which has a separate article, \"the\", to indicate the same.\nIn general, almost all nouns in Bokm\u00e5l follow these patterns (like the words in the examples above):\nIn contrast, almost all nouns in Nynorsk follow these patterns (the noun gender system is more pronounced than in Bokm\u00e5l):\nThere is in general no way to infer what grammatical gender a specific noun has, but there are some patterns of nouns where the gender can be inferred. For instance, all nouns ending in -\"nad\" will be masculine in both Bokm\u00e5l and Nynorsk (for instance the noun , which means 'job application'). Most nouns ending in -\"ing\" will be feminine, like the noun ('expectation').\nThere are some common irregular nouns, many of which are irregular in both Bokm\u00e5l and Nynorsk, like the following:\nIn Nynorsk, even though the irregular word is masculine, it is inflected like a feminine word in the plural. Another word with the same irregular inflection is ('son \u2013 sons').\nIn Nynorsk, nouns ending in -\"ing\" typically have masculine plural inflections, like the word in the following table. But they are treated as feminine nouns in every other way.\nGenitive of nouns.\nIn general, the genitive case has died out in modern Norwegian and there are only some remnants of it in certain expressions: ('to the mountains'), ('to the sea'). To show ownership, there is an enclitic -\"s\" similar to English -'\"s\"; ('Sondre's nice car', \"Sondre\" being a personal name). There are also reflexive possessive pronouns, , , , ; ('It is Sondre's'). In both Bokm\u00e5l and modern Nynorsk, there is often a mix of both of these to mark possession, though it is more common in Nynorsk to use the reflexive pronouns; in Nynorsk use of the reflexive possessive pronouns is generally encouraged to avoid mixing the enclitic -\"s\" with the historical grammatical case remnants of the language. The reflexive pronouns agree in gender and number with the noun.\nThe enclitic -\"s\" in Norwegian evolved as a shorthand expression for the possessive pronouns , , and .\nAdjectives.\nNorwegian adjectives, like those of Swedish and Danish, inflect for definiteness, gender, number and for comparison (affirmative/comparative/superlative). Inflection for definiteness follows two paradigms, called \"weak\" and \"strong\", a feature shared among the Germanic languages.\nThe following table summarizes the inflection of adjectives in Norwegian. The indefinite affirmative inflection can vary between adjectives, but in general the paradigm illustrated below is the most common. \nPredicate adjectives follow only the indefinite inflection table. Unlike attributive adjectives, they are not inflected for definiteness. \nIn most dialects, some verb participles used as adjectives have a separate form in both definite and plural uses, and sometimes also in the masculine-feminine singular. In some Southwestern dialects, the definite adjective is also declined in gender and number with one form for feminine and plural, and one form for masculine and neuter.\nAttributive adjectives.\nDefinite inflection.\nIn Norwegian, a definite noun has a suffixed definite article (cf. above) compared to English which in general uses the separate word \"the\" to indicate the same. However, when a definite noun is preceded by an adjective, the adjective also gets a definite inflection, shown in the inflection table above. There is also another definite marker, , that has to agree in gender with the noun when the definite noun is accompanied by an adjective. It comes before the adjective and has the following forms\nExamples of definite affirmative inflection of adjectives (Bokm\u00e5l):\nIf the adjective is dropped completely, the meaning of the preceding article before the noun changes, as shown in this example.\nExamples (Bokm\u00e5l):\nExamples of definite comparative and superlative inflection of adjectives (Bokm\u00e5l):\nDefiniteness is also signaled by using possessive pronouns or any uses of a noun in its genitive form in either Nynorsk or Bokm\u00e5l: ('my green house'), ('my green car'), ('my receding gums'), ('the president's old house').\nIndefinite inflection.\nExamples (Bokm\u00e5l):\nExamples of comparative and superlative inflections in Bokm\u00e5l: ('a greener car'), ('greenest car').\nPredicative adjectives.\nThere is also predicative agreement of adjectives in all dialects of Norwegian and in the written languages, unlike related languages like German and Dutch. This feature of predicative agreement is shared among the Scandinavian languages. Predicative adjectives do not inflect for definiteness unlike the attributive adjectives.\nThis means that nouns will have to agree with the adjective when there is a copula verb involved, like in Bokm\u00e5l: ('to be'), ('become'), ('looks like'), ('feels like') etc. \nVerbs.\nNorwegian verbs are not conjugated for person or number, unlike English and most European languages, though a few Norwegian dialects do conjugate for number. Norwegian verbs are conjugated according to mainly three grammatical moods: indicative, imperative and subjunctive, though the subjunctive mood has largely fallen out of use and is mainly found in a few common frozen expressions. The imperative is formed by removing the last vowel of the infinitive verb form, just like in the other Scandinavian languages.\nIndicative verbs are conjugated for tense: present, past, and future. The present and past tense also have a passive form for the infinitive.\nThere are four non-finite verb forms: infinitive, passive infinitive, and the two participles: perfective/past participle and imperfective/present participle.\nThe participles are verbal adjectives. The imperfective participle is not declined, whereas the perfect participle is declined for gender (though not in Bokm\u00e5l) and number like strong, affirmative adjectives. The definite form of the participle is identical to the plural form.\nAs with other Germanic languages, Norwegian verbs can be divided into two conjugation classes; weak verbs and strong verbs.\nErgative verbs.\nThere are ergative verbs in both Bokm\u00e5l and Nynorsk, where there are two different conjugation patterns depending on if the verb takes an object or not. In Bokm\u00e5l, there are only two different conjugations for the preterite tense for the strong verbs, while Nynorsk has different conjugations for all tenses, like Swedish and a majority of Norwegian dialects. Some weak verbs are also ergative and are differentiated for all tenses in both Bokm\u00e5l and Nynorsk, like , both of which meaning 'to lie down', but does not take an object while requires an object. corresponds to the English verb 'lay', while corresponds to the English verb 'lie'. There are, however, many verbs that do not have a direct translation to English verbs.\nPronouns.\nNorwegian personal pronouns are declined according to case: nominative and accusative. Like English, pronouns in Bokm\u00e5l and Nynorsk are the only class that has case declension. Some of the dialects that have preserved the dative in nouns, also have a dative case instead of the accusative case in personal pronouns, while others have accusative in pronouns and dative in nouns, effectively giving these dialects three distinct cases.\nIn the most comprehensive Norwegian grammar, Norsk referansegrammatikk, the categorization of personal pronouns by person, gender, and number is not regarded as inflection. Pronouns are a closed class in Norwegian.\nSince December 2017, the gender-neutral pronoun is present in the Norwegian Academy's dictionary (NAOB). In June 2022, the Language Council of Norway (Spr\u00e5kr\u00e5det) started including in both Bokm\u00e5l and Nynorsk Norwegian standards.\nThe words for 'mine', 'yours' etc. are dependent on the gender of the noun described. Like adjectives, they have to agree in gender with the noun.\nBokm\u00e5l has two sets of third-person pronouns. and refer to male and female individuals respectively; and refer to impersonal or inanimate nouns, of masculine/feminine or neutral gender respectively. In contrast, Nynorsk and most dialects use the same set of pronouns ('he'), ('she') and ('it') for both personal and impersonal references, like in German, Icelandic and Old Norse. also has expletive and cataphoric uses like in the English examples it rains\" and it was known by everyone (that) he had travelled the world\".\nOrdering of possessive pronouns.\nThe ordering of possessive pronouns is somewhat freer than in Swedish or Danish. When there is no adjective, the most common word order is the one used in the examples in the table above, where the possessive comes after the noun, while the noun is in its definite form; ('my book'). If one wishes to emphasize the owner of the noun, the possessive pronoun will usually be placed first. In Bokm\u00e5l, however, due to its Danish origins, one could choose to always write the possessive first: ('my car'), but this may sound very formal. Some dialects that have been very influenced by Danish also do this; some speakers in B\u00e6rum and the west of Oslo may always use this word order. When there is an adjective describing the noun, the possessive pronoun will always come first: ('my own car').\nDeterminers.\nThe closed class of Norwegian determiners are declined in gender and number in agreement with their argument. Not all determiners are inflected.\nParticle classes.\nNorwegian has five closed classes without inflection, i.e. lexical categories with grammatical function and a finite number of members that may not be distinguished by morphological criteria. These are interjections, conjunctions, subjunctions, prepositions, and adverbs. The inclusion of adverbs here requires that traditional adverbs that are inflected in comparison be classified as adjectives, as is sometimes done.\nAdverbs.\nAdverbs can be formed from adjectives in Norwegian. English usually creates adverbs from adjectives by the suffix \"-ly\", like the adverb \"beautifully\" from the adjective \"beautiful.\" By comparison, Scandinavian languages usually form adverbs from adjectives by the grammatical neuter singular form of the adjective. This is in general true for both Bokm\u00e5l and Nynorsk.\nExample (Bokm\u00e5l):\nIn the third sentence, is an adverb. In the first and second sentence and are adjectives and must agree in grammatical gender with the noun.\nAnother example is the adjective ('beautiful') which exists in both Nynorsk and Bokm\u00e5l and has the neuter singular form .\nExample (Nynorsk):\nCompound words.\nIn Norwegian compound words, the head, i.e. the part determining the compound's class, is the last part. If the compound word is constructed from many different nouns, the last noun in the compound noun will determine the gender of the compound noun. Only the first part has primary stress. For instance, the compound ('think tank') has primary stress on the first syllable and is a masculine noun since the noun is masculine.\nCompound words are written together in Norwegian, which can cause words to become very long, for example ('maximum likelihood estimator') and ('human rights organizations'). Other examples are the title ('Chief Justice of the Supreme Court', originally a combination of \"supreme court\" and the actual title, \"justiciar\") and the translation for \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\".\nIf they are not written together, each part is naturally read with primary stress, and the meaning of the compound is lost. Examples of this in English are the difference between a green house and a greenhouse or a black board and a blackboard.\nThis is sometimes forgotten, occasionally with humorous results. Instead of writing, for example, \"\" ('lamb chops'), people make the mistake of writing ('lame', or 'paralyzed', 'chops'). The original message can even be reversed, as when (lit. 'smoke-free', meaning no smoking) becomes ('smoke freely').\nOther examples include:\nThese misunderstandings occur because most nouns can be interpreted as verbs or other types of words.\nSimilar misunderstandings can be achieved in English too. The following are examples of phrases that both in Norwegian and English mean one thing as a compound word, and something different when regarded as separate words:\nSyntax.\nWord order.\nNorwegian syntax is predominantly SVO. The subject occupies the sentence-initial position, followed by the verb and then the object. Like many other Germanic languages, it follows the V2 rule, which means that the finite verb is invariably the second element in a sentence. For example:\nExceptions to the rule are embedded clauses and question phrases.\nNegation.\nNegation in Norwegian is expressed by the word , which literally means 'not' and is placed after the finite verb. Exceptions are embedded clauses.\nContractions with the negation, as is accepted in for example English (\"cannot\", \"hadn't\", \"didn't\") are limited to dialects and colloquial speech. In this case contractions apply to the negation and the verb. Otherwise is applied in similar ways as the English \"not\" and general negation.\nAdverbs.\nAdverbs follow the verb they modify. Depending on the type of adverb, the order in which they appear in the phrase is pre-determined. Manner adverbs for example, precede temporal adverbs. Switching the order of these adverbs would not render the phrase ungrammatical, but would make it sound awkward. Compare this to the English phrase \"John probably already ate dinner.\" Switching the adverbs' position (\"already\" and \"probably\") to \"John already probably ate dinner\" is not incorrect, but sounds unnatural.

The standard way to resolve these debates is to define the operations of calculus using limits rather than infinitesimals. Nonstandard analysis instead reformulates the calculus using a logically rigorous notion of infinitesimal numbers.\nNonstandard analysis originated in the early 1960s by the mathematician Abraham Robinson. He wrote:\n... the idea of infinitely small or \"infinitesimal\" quantities seems to appeal naturally to our intuition. At any rate, the use of infinitesimals was widespread during the formative stages of the Differential and Integral Calculus. As for the objection ... that the distance between two distinct real numbers cannot be infinitely small, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz argued that the theory of infinitesimals implies the introduction of ideal numbers which might be infinitely small or infinitely large compared with the real numbers but which were \"to possess the same properties as the latter.\"\nRobinson argued that this law of continuity of Leibniz's is a precursor of the transfer principle. Robinson continued:\nHowever, neither he nor his disciples and successors were able to give a rational development leading up to a system of this sort. As a result, the theory of infinitesimals gradually fell into disrepute and was replaced eventually by the classical theory of limits.\nRobinson continues:\n... Leibniz's ideas can be fully vindicated and ... they lead to a novel and fruitful approach to classical Analysis and to many other branches of mathematics. The key to our method is provided by the detailed analysis of the relation between mathematical languages and mathematical structures which lies at the bottom of contemporary model theory.\nIn 1973, intuitionist Arend Heyting praised nonstandard analysis as \"a standard model of important mathematical research\".\nIntroduction.\nA non-zero element of an ordered field formula_1 is infinitesimal if and only if its absolute value is smaller than any element of formula_1 that is of the form formula_3, for formula_4 a standard natural number. Ordered fields that have infinitesimal elements are also called non-Archimedean. More generally, nonstandard analysis is any form of mathematics that relies on nonstandard models and the transfer principle. A field that satisfies the transfer principle for real numbers is called a real closed field, and nonstandard real analysis uses these fields as \"nonstandard models\" of the real numbers.\nRobinson's original approach was based on these nonstandard models of the field of real numbers. His classic foundational book on the subject \"Nonstandard Analysis\" was published in 1966 and is still in print. On page 88, Robinson writes:\nThe existence of nonstandard models of arithmetic was discovered by Thoralf Skolem (1934). Skolem's method foreshadows the ultrapower construction [...]\nSeveral technical issues must be addressed to develop a calculus of infinitesimals. For example, it is not enough to construct an ordered field with infinitesimals. See the article Hyperreal number for a discussion of some of the relevant ideas.\nBasic definitions.\nIn this section we outline one of the simplest approaches to defining a hyperreal field formula_5. Let formula_6 be the field of real numbers, and let formula_7 be the semiring of natural numbers. Denote by formula_8 the set of sequences of real numbers. A field formula_5 is defined as a suitable quotient of formula_10, as follows. Take a nonprincipal ultrafilter formula_11. In particular, formula_12 contains the Fr\u00e9chet filter. Consider a pair of sequences\nformula_13\nWe say that formula_14 and formula_15 are equivalent if they coincide on a set of indices that is a member of the ultrafilter, or in formulas:\nformula_16\nThe quotient of formula_10 by the resulting equivalence relation is a hyperreal field formula_5, a situation summarized by the formula formula_19.\nMotivation.\nThere are at least three reasons to consider nonstandard analysis: historical, pedagogical, and technical.\nHistorical.\nMuch of the earliest development of the infinitesimal calculus by Newton and Leibniz was formulated using expressions such as \"infinitesimal number\" and \"vanishing quantity\". These formulations were widely criticized by George Berkeley and others. The challenge of developing a consistent and satisfactory theory of analysis using infinitesimals was first met by Abraham Robinson.\nIn 1958 Curt Schmieden and Detlef Laugwitz published an article \"Eine Erweiterung der Infinitesimalrechnung\" (\"An Extension of Infinitesimal Calculus\") which proposed a construction of a ring containing infinitesimals. The ring was constructed from sequences of real numbers. Two sequences were considered equivalent if they differed only in a finite number of elements. Arithmetic operations were defined elementwise. However, the ring constructed in this way contains zero divisors and thus cannot be a field.\nPedagogical.\nH. Jerome Keisler, David Tall, and other educators maintain that the use of infinitesimals is more intuitive and more easily grasped by students than the \"epsilon\u2013delta\" approach to analytic concepts. This approach can sometimes provide easier proofs of results than the corresponding epsilon\u2013delta formulation of the proof. Much of the simplification comes from applying very easy rules of nonstandard arithmetic, as follows:\ninfinitesimal \u00d7 finite = infinitesimal\ninfinitesimal + infinitesimal = infinitesimal\ntogether with the transfer principle (discussed further below).\nAnother pedagogical application of nonstandard analysis is Edward Nelson's treatment of the theory of stochastic processes.\nTechnical.\nSome recent work has been done in analysis using concepts from nonstandard analysis, particularly in investigating limiting processes of statistics and mathematical physics. Sergio Albeverio et al. discuss some of these applications.\nApproaches.\nThere are two, main, different approaches to nonstandard analysis: the semantic or model-theoretic approach and the syntactic approach. Both of these approaches apply to other areas of mathematics beyond analysis, including number theory, algebra and topology.\nRobinson's original formulation of nonstandard analysis falls into the category of the \"semantic approach\". As developed by him in his papers, it is based on studying models (in particular saturated models) of a theory. Since Robinson's work first appeared, a simpler semantic approach (due to Elias Zakon) has been developed using purely set-theoretic objects called superstructures. In this approach \"a model of a theory\" is replaced by an object called a \"superstructure\" \"V\"(\"S\") over a set S. Starting from a superstructure \"V\"(\"S\") one constructs another object *\"V\"(\"S\") using the ultrapower construction together with a mapping \"V\"(\"S\") \u2192 *\"V\"(\"S\") that satisfies the transfer principle. The map * relates formal properties of \"V\"(\"S\") and *\"V\"(\"S\"). Moreover, it is possible to consider a simpler form of saturation called countable saturation. This simplified approach is also more suitable for use by mathematicians who are not specialists in model theory or logic.\nThe \"syntactic approach\" requires much less logic and model theory to understand and use. This approach was developed in the mid-1970s by the mathematician Edward Nelson. Nelson introduced an entirely axiomatic formulation of nonstandard analysis that he called internal set theory (IST). IST is an extension of Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory (ZF) in that alongside the basic binary membership relation \u2208, it introduces a new unary predicate \"standard\", which can be applied to elements of the mathematical universe together with some axioms for reasoning with this new predicate.\nSyntactic nonstandard analysis requires a great deal of care in applying the principle of set formation (formally known as the axiom of comprehension), which mathematicians usually take for granted. As Nelson points out, a fallacy in reasoning in IST is that of \"illegal set formation\". For instance, there is no set in IST whose elements are precisely the standard integers (here \"standard\" is understood in the sense of the new predicate). To avoid illegal set formation, one must only use predicates of ZFC to define subsets.\nAnother example of the syntactic approach is the Vop\u011bnka's alternative set theory, which tries to find set-theory axioms more compatible with the nonstandard analysis than the axioms of ZF.\nRobinson's book.\nAbraham Robinson's book \"Non-standard Analysis\" was published in 1966. Some of the topics developed in the book were already present in his 1961 article by the same title (Robinson 1961). In addition to containing the first full treatment of nonstandard analysis, the book contains a detailed historical section where Robinson challenges some of the received opinions on the history of mathematics based on the pre\u2013nonstandard analysis perception of infinitesimals as inconsistent entities. Thus, Robinson challenges the idea that Augustin-Louis Cauchy's \"sum theorem\" in Cours d'Analyse concerning the convergence of a series of continuous functions was incorrect, and proposes an infinitesimal-based interpretation of its hypothesis that results in a correct theorem.\nInvariant subspace problem.\nAbraham Robinson and Allen Bernstein used nonstandard analysis to prove that every polynomially compact linear operator on a Hilbert space has an invariant subspace.\nGiven an operator T on Hilbert space \"H\", consider the orbit of a point v in H under the iterates of T. Applying Gram\u2013Schmidt one obtains an orthonormal basis (\"ei\") for H. Let (\"Hi\") be the corresponding nested sequence of \"coordinate\" subspaces of H. The matrix \"ai,j\" expressing T with respect to (\"ei\") is almost upper triangular, in the sense that the coefficients \"a\"\"i\"+1,\"i\" are the only nonzero sub-diagonal coefficients. Bernstein and Robinson show that if T is polynomially compact, then there is a hyperfinite index w such that the matrix coefficient \"a\"\"w\"+1,\"w\" is infinitesimal. Next, consider the subspace \"Hw\" of *\"H\". If y in \"Hw\" has finite norm, then \"T\"(\"y\") is infinitely close to \"Hw\".\nNow let \"Tw\" be the operator formula_20 acting on \"Hw\", where \"Pw\" is the orthogonal projection to \"Hw\". Denote by q the polynomial such that \"q\"(\"T\") is compact. The subspace \"Hw\" is internal of hyperfinite dimension. By transferring upper triangularisation of operators of finite-dimensional complex vector space, there is an internal orthonormal Hilbert space basis (\"ek\") for \"Hw\" where k runs from 1 to w, such that each of the corresponding k-dimensional subspaces \"Ek\" is T-invariant. Denote by \u03a0\"k\" the projection to the subspace \"Ek\". For a nonzero vector x of finite norm in H, one can assume that \"q\"(\"T\")(\"x\") is nonzero, or |\"q\"(\"T\")(\"x\")| &gt; 1 to fix ideas. Since \"q\"(\"T\") is a compact operator, (\"q\"(\"Tw\"))(\"x\") is infinitely close to \"q\"(\"T\")(\"x\") and therefore one has also |\"q\"(\"Tw\")(\"x\")| &gt; 1. Now let j be the greatest index such that formula_21. Then the space of all standard elements infinitely close to \"Ej\" is the desired invariant subspace.\nUpon reading a preprint of the Bernstein and Robinson paper, Paul Halmos reinterpreted their proof using standard techniques. Both papers appeared back-to-back in the same issue of the \"Pacific Journal of Mathematics\". Some of the ideas used in Halmos's proof reappeared many years later in Halmos's own work on quasi-triangular operators.\nOther applications.\nOther results were received along the line of reinterpreting or reproving previously known results. Of particular interest is Teturo Kamae's proof of the individual ergodic theorem or L. van den Dries and Alex Wilkie's treatment of Gromov's theorem on groups of polynomial growth. Nonstandard analysis was used by Larry Manevitz and Shmuel Weinberger to prove a result in algebraic topology.\nThe real contributions of nonstandard analysis lie however in the concepts and theorems that utilize the new extended language of nonstandard set theory. Among the list of new applications in mathematics there are new approaches to probability,\nhydrodynamics, measure theory, nonsmooth and harmonic analysis, etc.\nThere are also applications of nonstandard analysis to the theory of stochastic processes, particularly constructions of Brownian motion as random walks. Albeverio et al. have an introduction to this area of research.\nIn terms of axiomatics, Boffa\u2019s superuniversality axiom has found application as a basis for axiomatic nonstandard analysis.\nApplications to calculus.\nAs an application to mathematical education, H. Jerome Keisler wrote \"\". Covering nonstandard calculus, it develops differential and integral calculus using the hyperreal numbers, which include infinitesimal elements. These applications of nonstandard analysis depend on the existence of the \"standard part\" of a finite hyperreal r. The standard part of r, denoted st(\"r\"), is a standard real number infinitely close to r. One of the visualization devices Keisler uses is that of an imaginary infinite-magnification microscope to distinguish points infinitely close together.\nCritique.\nDespite the elegance and appeal of some aspects of nonstandard analysis, criticisms have been voiced, as well, such as those by Errett Bishop, Alain Connes, and Paul Halmos.\nLogical framework.\nGiven any set S, the \"superstructure\" over a set S is the set \"V\"(\"S\") defined by the conditions\nformula_22\nformula_23\nformula_24\nThus the superstructure over S is obtained by starting from S and iterating the operation of adjoining the power set of S and taking the union of the resulting sequence. The superstructure over the real numbers includes a wealth of mathematical structures: For instance, it contains isomorphic copies of all separable metric spaces and metrizable topological vector spaces. Virtually all of mathematics that interests an analyst goes on within \"V\"(R).\nThe working view of nonstandard analysis is a set *R and a mapping * : \"V\"(R) \u2192 \"V\"(*R) that satisfies some additional properties. To formulate these principles we first state some definitions.\nA formula has \"bounded quantification\" if and only if the only quantifiers that occur in the formula have range restricted over sets, that is are all of the form:\nformula_25\nformula_26\nFor example, the formula\nformula_27\nhas bounded quantification, the universally quantified variable x ranges over A, the existentially quantified variable y ranges over the powerset of B. On the other hand,\nformula_28\ndoes not have bounded quantification because the quantification of \"y\" is unrestricted.\nInternal sets.\nA set \"x\" is \"internal\" if and only if \"x\" is an element of *\"A\" for some element \"A\" of \"V\"(R). *\"A\" itself is internal if \"A\" belongs to \"V\"(R).\nWe now formulate the basic logical framework of nonstandard analysis:\nformula_29\nformula_30\nOne can show using ultraproducts that such a map * exists. Elements of \"V\"(R) are called \"standard\". Elements of *R are called hyperreal numbers.\nFirst consequences.\nThe symbol *N denotes the nonstandard natural numbers. By the extension principle, this is a superset of N. The set *N \u2212 N is nonempty. To see this, apply countable saturation to the sequence of internal sets\nformula_31\nThe sequence {\"An\"}\"n\" \u2208 N has a nonempty intersection, proving the result.\nWe begin with some definitions: Hyperreals \"r\", \"s\" are \"infinitely close\" if and only if\nformula_32\nA hyperreal r is \"infinitesimal\" if and only if it is infinitely close to 0. For example, if n is a hyperinteger, i.e. an element of *N \u2212 N, then 1/\"n\" is an infinitesimal. A hyperreal r is \"limited\" (or \"finite\") if and only if its absolute value is dominated by (less than) a standard integer. The limited hyperreals form a subring of *R containing the reals. In this ring, the infinitesimal hyperreals are an ideal.\nThe set of limited hyperreals or the set of infinitesimal hyperreals are \"external\" subsets of \"V\"(*R); what this means in practice is that bounded quantification, where the bound is an internal set, never ranges over these sets.\nExample: The plane (\"x\", \"y\") with x and y ranging over *R is internal, and is a model of plane Euclidean geometry. The plane with x and y restricted to limited values (analogous to the Dehn plane) is external, and in this limited plane the parallel postulate is violated. For example, any line passing through the point (0, 1) on the y-axis and having infinitesimal slope is parallel to the x-axis.\nTheorem. For any limited hyperreal r there is a unique standard real denoted st(\"r\") infinitely close to r. The mapping st is a ring homomorphism from the ring of limited hyperreals to R.\nThe mapping st is also external.\nOne way of thinking of the standard part of a hyperreal, is in terms of Dedekind cuts; any limited hyperreal s defines a cut by considering the pair of sets (\"L\", \"U\") where L is the set of standard rationals a less than s and U is the set of standard rationals b greater than s. The real number corresponding to (\"L\", \"U\") can be seen to satisfy the condition of being the standard part of s.\nOne intuitive characterization of continuity is as follows:\nTheorem. A real-valued function f on the interval [\"a\", \"b\"] is continuous if and only if for every hyperreal x in the interval *[\"a\", \"b\"], we have: *\"f\"(\"x\") \u2245 *\"f\"(st(\"x\")).\nSimilarly,\nTheorem. A real-valued function f is differentiable at the real value x if and only if for every infinitesimal hyperreal number h, the value\nformula_33\nexists and is independent of {{mvar|h}}. In this case {{math|\"f\"\u2032(\"x\")}} is a real number and is the derivative of {{mvar|f}} at {{mvar|x}}.\n{{mvar|\u03ba}}-saturation.\nIt is possible to \"improve\" the saturation by allowing collections of higher cardinality to be intersected. A model is {{mvar|\u03ba}}-saturated if whenever formula_34 is a collection of internal sets with the finite intersection property and formula_35,\nformula_36\nThis is useful, for instance, in a topological space {{mvar|X}}, where we may want {{math|{{!}}2\"X\"{{!}}}}-saturation to ensure the intersection of a standard neighborhood base is nonempty.\nFor any cardinal {{mvar|\u03ba}}, a {{mvar|\u03ba}}-saturated extension can be constructed."}

A centralized and hierarchical organization, the NOI is committed to black nationalism and focuses its attention on the black African diaspora, especially on African Americans. While describing itself as Islamic and using Islamic terminology, its religious tenets differ substantially from orthodox Islamic traditions. Scholars of religion characterize it as a new religious movement.\nThe Nation teaches that there has been a succession of mortal gods, each a black man named Allah, of whom Fard Muhammad is the latest. It claims that the first Allah created the earliest humans, the dark-skinned Original Asiatic Race, whose members possessed inner divinity and from whom all people of color descend. It maintains that a scientist named Yakub then created the white race, a group that lacked inner divinity and whose intrinsic violence led them to overthrow the Original Asiatic Race and achieve global dominance. Setting itself against the white-dominated society of the United States, the NOI campaigns for the creation of an independent African American nation-state and calls for African Americans to be economically self-sufficient and separatist. A millenarian tradition, it maintains that Fard Muhammad will soon return aboard a spaceship, the \"Mother Plane\" or \"Mother Ship\", to wipe out the white-dominated order and establish a utopia. Members worship in buildings, varyingly called temples or mosques. Practitioners are expected to live disciplined lives, adhering to strict dress codes, specific dietary requirements, and patriarchal gender roles.\nWallace Fard Muhammad established the Nation of Islam in Detroit. He drew on various sources, especially Noble Drew Ali's Moorish Science Temple of America and black nationalist trends like Garveyism. After Fard Muhammad disappeared in 1934, the leadership of the NOI was assumed by Elijah Muhammad, who expanded the NOI's teachings, declared Fard Muhammad to be the latest Allah, and built the group's business empire. Attracting growing attention in the late 1950s and 1960s, the NOI's influence expanded through high-profile members such as the black nationalist activist Malcolm X and the boxer Muhammad Ali. Deeming it a threat to domestic security, the Federal Bureau of Investigation worked to undermine the group. Following Elijah Muhammad's death in 1975, his son Wallace D. Muhammad took over the organization, moving it towards Sunni Islam and renaming it the World Community of Islam in the West. Members seeking to retain Elijah Muhammad's teachings re-established the Nation of Islam under Louis Farrakhan's leadership in 1977. Farrakhan has continued to develop the NOI's beliefs, for instance by drawing connections with Dianetics, and expanding its economic and agricultural operations.\nBased in the United States, the Nation of Islam has also established a presence abroad, with membership open only to people of color. In 2007 it was estimated to have 50,000 members. The Nation has also influenced the formation of other groups like the Five-Percent Nation and the Nuwaubian Nation. Muslim critics accuse the NOI of promoting teachings that are not authentically Islamic. Other critics like the Southern Poverty Law Center and the Anti-Defamation League have characterized it as a black supremacist hate group that promotes racism towards white people, antisemitism, and anti-LGBT rhetoric.\nDefinition.\nScholars of religion typically classify the Nation of Islam (NOI) as a new religious movement. Elsewhere, they have labelled it an African American religion, a black nationalist religion, an \"ethno-religious movement\", a \"religious nationalist\" movement, a social movement, and a form of esotericism. Given that extraterrestrial spaceships feature prominently in the group's teachings, scholars of religion have also highlighted commonalities between the NOI and UFO religions. More broadly, the sociologist of religion Susan J. Palmer characterised the Nation as forming part of a \"Black cultic milieu\" in which it coexists alongside other black-oriented new religions, including Rastafari, the Black Hebrew Israelites, and the Nuwaubian Nation.\nThe name \"Nation of Islam\" has represented two distinct organizations: the first was established by Wallace Fard Muhammad in the 1930s and existed until 1975, after which the second group was created by Louis Farrakhan in the late 1970s. Farrakhan's second Nation has differences from its predecessor, reflecting how the Nation's teachings have shifted over its history. As an organization, the Nation is highly centralized, hierarchical, and authoritarian. Although there are members who privately break the Nation's rules on personal behavior and lifestyle\u2014and who may not implicitly adhere to all the Nation's teachings\u2014in general the group's practitioners display a high degree of uniformity and conformity.\nRelationship to Christianity and Islam.\nThe NOI is influenced by Christianity and Islam although offers profoundly different interpretations of their central scriptures, the Bible and the Quran; it has no holy text of its own.\nHaving arisen from within the Christian-majority United States, the Nation denigrates Christianity, presenting it as a tool of white supremacy. For the group\u2014whose members are commonly called \"Black Muslims\"\u2014their Islamic identity offers an alternative to mainstream, Christian-dominated American culture. \nIn describing itself as Islamic the NOI seeks to reclaim what it regards as the historic Muslim identity of the African American people, with the group's second leader, Elijah Muhammad, stating that \"Islam is the natural religion of the Black Nation.\" The Nation sees itself as part of the Islamic world, and Islamic elements in its practices include the use of the Arabic language, prayers five times a day, and the adoption of a flag based on that of Muslim-majority Turkey.\nDespite this, the Nation has little in common with mainstream forms of Islam. It does not adhere to the Five Pillars of Islam, makes claims about the nature of God and the afterlife which differ fundamentally from Muslim teaching, and does not accept the standard Islamic belief that the Arabian religious leader Muhammad was God's final and most important messenger. Although using standard Islamic terms, it gives these completely different meanings to those understood by most Muslims. Mainstream Muslims generally see the NOI as a movement that selectively adopts Islamic ideas but is not truly Islamic. From mainstream Islamic perspectives, its teachings are heretical, with its theology being \"shirk\" (blasphemy). Accordingly, some scholars of religion have characterised it as \"quasi-Islamic\", or referred to it as \"Fardian Islam\", \"pseudo-Islam\", or \"nontraditional Islam\".\nHistory.\nBackground.\nIslam existed in North America prior to the formation of the United States. African Muslims were among the Spanish expeditions that explored the continent during the early modern period, and were also among the enslaved people transported there via the Atlantic slave trade of the 16th to 19th centuries. It is estimated that, at the time of the American Revolution in the 1760s\u201380s, approximately 15 percent of enslaved Africans and African Americans in the new United States were Muslim. Although Islam probably died out among the African American community over subsequent generations, this historical association influenced the emergence of groups like the NOI in the early 20th century.\nThe Nation formed in the 1930s, when large numbers of African Americans were migrating from southern states to northern cities. Within that context, various groups emerged that would influence the NOI. In particular, the scholar of religion Dawn Gibson characterised the Nation as having been \"born out of a fusion\" between the ideas of Garveyism and the Moorish Science Temple of America. Central to Garveyism, and thus a major influence on the NOI, was the Jamaican black nationalist Marcus Garvey, who lived in the US from 1916 to 1927 and who formed the Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League (UNIA). According to the scholar Zoe Colley, Garvey's \"UNIA provided the cultural bedrock for the NOI\". It was from Garveyism that the Nation took its black nationalism, including its emphasis on black self-sufficiency and enterprise.\nThe second key influence on the Nation was the Moorish Science Temple, an organization also promoting an idiosyncratic religion that its followers claimed was Islamic. This had been established by the North Carolina-born African American Noble Drew Ali in Newark, New Jersey, in 1913. Drew Ali claimed that he was the reincarnation of both Jesus and Muhammad, and maintained that African Americans should refer to themselves as \"Moorish Americans\", reflecting what he believed were their connections to the Muslim Moors of North Africa. In addition to Garveyism and the Moorish Science Temple, further influences on the Nation's development included African American Christianity, Freemasonry, and the Jehovah's Witnesses.\nWallace Fard Muhammad.\nThe Nation of Islam was founded by Wallace Fard Muhammad, who began preaching his ideas among Detroit's African Americans in July 1930. Fard Muhammad claimed to be an Arab from Mecca who had come on a mission to the African American people, whom he called the \"Nation of Islam\", to restore them to their original faith. The Nation has since taught that Fard Muhammad was the latest Allah (God) himself. They claim he was born in Mecca on February 26, 1877, the son of a black Meccan named Alphonso and a white woman from the Caucasus Mountains named Baby Gee. Being half-white, the NOI maintain, was necessary to allow Fard Muhammad to move freely in white society.\nOutside the Nation, various theories have been proposed as to Fard Muhammad's true identity. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) matched Fard Muhammad's fingerprints to those of Wallie D. Ford, who had a record of arrests and had served a three-year sentence in San Quentin Prison for drug charges. Ford had been released in May 1929, a year before Fard Muhammad's appearance. FBI reports suggest he entered the US illegally in 1913. The NOI reject Fard Muhammad's identification as Ford, claiming that the FBI forged this evidence. There have also been suggestions made that, on his release from prison, Fard had joined the Moorish Science Temple of America and subsequently established his Nation as a breakaway faction.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nMy name is W. D. Fard, and I come from the Holy City of Mecca. More about myself I will not tell you yet, for the time has not yet come. I am your brother. You have not yet seen me in my royal robes.\nA message from Fard Muhammad, as reported by an early follower\nFard Muhammad's following grew rapidly. He held meetings three days a week which attracted 7,000 to 8,000 people, mostly southern migrants, and some ex-members of the Moorish Science Temple. Fard Muhammad wrote two manuals, the \"Secret Ritual of the Nation of Islam\" and the \"Teaching for the Lost Found Nation of Islam in a Mathematical Way\", also urging his followers to listen to Jehovah's Witness and Baptist fundamentalist radio sermons. He established a bureaucratic administration within the Nation, its own system of schools, and both the Fruit of Islam paramilitary wing for men and the Muslim Girls Training School for women.\nIn 1931, an African American named Elijah Poole became Fard Muhammad's disciple. Poole had been born the son of a Baptist preacher in Bold Springs, Georgia in 1897, but relocated to Detroit in 1923; joining Garvey's UNIA, he worked in industrial plants before becoming unemployed amid the Great Depression. After Poole joined the NOI, Fard Muhammad gave him the new name of Elijah Karriem, later appointing him supreme minister of the Nation and renaming him Elijah Muhammad. In 1933, Elijah Muhammad set up a new temple on Chicago's South Side.\nThe early NOI faced problems from law enforcement. In 1932 the Detroit Police Department arrested an NOI member for a murder which they claimed was a human sacrifice. The police then raided the Nation's headquarters and arrested Fard Muhammad, but he was soon released. Subsequently, he would be arrested several further times; his September 1933 arrest for disorderly conduct in Chicago would be his last known verified whereabouts. In 1934, Fard Muhammad disappeared without notifying his followers or designating a successor. Rumors spread that he had moved to Europe or that he had been killed, either by the police or by former followers.\nElijah Muhammad's leadership.\nWith Fard Muhammad gone, Elijah Muhammad became head of the Nation. Under his leadership, the NOI's theology took its distinctive form; Elijah Muhammad claimed that Fard Muhammad had been the latest Allah, and had departed the Earth but left him behind as his messenger. Elijah Muhammad relocated the NOI's headquarters to Chicago, and transmitted his ideas through various publications and hundreds of speeches.\nDuring the Second World War, in which the US fought Japan, the FBI began monitoring the Nation; FBI informants reported pro-Japanese sentiment being expressed at its meetings. Many Nation members refused the military draft and in September 1942 the FBI arrested 65 NOI members, including Elijah Muhammad, for doing so. Elijah remained imprisoned until August 1946, during which time his wife, Clara, largely ran the organisation. Despite these set-backs, Elijah Muhammad oversaw the Nation's development into a multi-million dollar business empire incorporating apartments, factories, farms and a small bank. He himself lived at a villa named The Palace in Chicago's Hyde Park area, and in winter moved to a ranch outside Phoenix, Arizona.\nThe NOI's membership grew substantially during the latter part of the 1950s. In 1959, the FBI encouraged the media to attack the group; that year, a documentary about the Nation, \"The Hate that Hate Produced\", brought growing awareness of the group to the American public. The US press increasingly framed the NOI as anti-American and black supremacist, with the civil rights movement largely presenting it as evidence for the harmful effect that poor race relations were having in the US. This negative criticism nonetheless gave the group significant attention and assisted its recruitment. Further press attention came in 1962, when Los Angeles police raided one of the Nation's temples, during which one member was killed and seven injured. Additional issues for the group arose in 1963, when a schism in the Nation's Temple Number 7 in Harlem, New York City led to the creation of a new movement, the Five Percent Nation of Islam.\nOne of the NOI's most significant members in this period was Malcolm X. Born Malcolm Little, he discovered the Nation while in prison; following his 1952 release, he rose swiftly through its hierarchy. In 1960, he launched the newspaper \"Muhammad Speaks\", which reached a circulation of over 600,000, and in 1963 he became the Nation's first national representative. He also travelled internationally; in Britain, he met with Michael de Freitas, who joined the Nation and formed a British branch. Another prominent NOI member was the boxer Muhammad Ali. He encountered the Nation in 1961 and received significant media criticism after announcing his membership of the group in 1964.\nMalcolm X's subsequent pilgrimage to Mecca resulted in encounters with white Muslims which helped shift his views of white people. In light of these experiences, in March 1964 he left the Nation and became a Sunni Muslim. He began denouncing Elijah Muhammad's extramarital affairs and accused the Nation of holding back the revolutionary potential of African Americans. In February 1965, Malcolm X was assassinated, with three NOI members convicted of the killing the following year. There was press speculation that the Nation's leaders were complicit, something which damaged the group's reputation; recruitment declined in the latter half of the 1960s.\nIn 1972, the NOI bought the St. Constantine Greek Orthodox Church in Chicago and transformed it into their headquarters temple, Mosque Maryam. By 1974 it had either a temple/mosque or study group in every US state and in the District of Columbia. Relations with law enforcement remained strained; in 1972, a New York City policeman was shot and killed during a search of a NOI mosque in Harlem. The group continued to face opposition from the FBI, which engaged in a renewed counterintelligence project to destabilise it from the late 1960s. This included sowing discord between the Nation and the Black Panther Party, encouraging incidents in which Black Panthers attacked NOI newspaper sellers. \nA difficult relationship also persisted with the larger American Muslim community. Although Elijah Muhammad drew greater elements from Sunni Islam into the Nation\u2014and undertook the hajj pilgrimage to Mecca in 1959, 1967, and 1971\u2014other American Muslim groups increasingly condemned the Nation as un-Islamic. Conflict developed between the NOI and other African American-majority Muslim groups. In 1973, NOI members killed seven of Hamaas Abdul Khaalis' Hanafi Muslims, five of them children; the Nation's leadership denied sanctioning the attack.\nWallace Muhammad and the NOI's transition to Sunni Islam.\nIn 1975, Elijah Muhammad died and was succeeded by his son, Wallace D. Muhammad. Wallace Muhammad had had a strained relationship with his father; while imprisoned in the early 1960s he had moved closer to Sunni Islam and subsequently left the Nation before re-joining in 1974. As leader, Wallace Muhammad launched what he called the movement's \"Second Resurrection\".\nRejecting many of the Nation's idiosyncratic teachings, Wallace Muhammad increasingly aligned the group with Sunni Islam. \"Temples\" were renamed \"mosques\", while \"ministers\" were renamed \"imams\". The Fruit of Islam was disbanded, with Wallace calling it a \"hooligan outfit\". Black nationalism was abandoned, and the ban on white people joining the Nation was lifted. Wallace Muhammad claimed that the Nation's old belief that the white man was the Devil referred only to mental whiteness, a state in rebellion against Allah. He nevertheless retained a focus on raising the status of black people, inviting African Americans to call themselves \"Bilalians\" after the 7th-century African Muslim, Bilal ibn Rabah.\nIn November 1976, the Nation was renamed the World Community of al-Islam in the West and in April 1978 the American Muslim Mission. Wallace Muhammad claimed that these changes were in accordance with his father's intentions; he stated that he was in contact with Fard Muhammad and that the founder had established the NOI to gradually introduce African Americans to Sunni Islam. Most mosques accepted Wallace Muhammad's reforms but some rejected them, establishing small splinter groups in Detroit, Atlanta, and Baltimore. In 1985, Wallace Muhammad disbanded his organization, telling his followers to affiliate instead with their local mosques.\nLouis Farrakhan's revival.\nLeading the opposition to Wallace Muhammad's reforms was Louis Farrakhan, who, with other disaffected members, began rebuilding the Nation of Islam in 1977. Born in the Bronx to Caribbean migrants, Farrakhan had been a nightclub singer prior to joining the original Nation in 1955. In 1964 he had become minister of the NOI's Harlem Temple and in 1967 a national representative. Under Wallace Muhammad's leadership, Farrakhan was relocated to Chicago, widely seen as a demotion.\nFarrakhan presented himself as Elijah Muhammad's true successor; his followers described Wallace Muhammad's leadership as \"the Fall\". Farrakhan's NOI spent the first several years focusing on rebuilding, re-establishing the Fruit of Islam, and buying much of the property owned by its predecessor, including the Chicago Palace. In 1979, Farrakhan launched a newspaper, \"The Final Call\", which by 1994 had a circulation of 500,000. In 1981, Farrakhan's Nation held its first convention, and its membership began to increase rapidly in the mid-1980s.\nAlthough criticising Wallace Muhammad's wholesale embrace of Sunnism, Farrakhan introduced elements of mainstream Islam into his Nation. He also added further novel developments; Masonic elements and numerology came to play an important part in his speeches. He claimed that in 1985, while at Tepotzotl\u00e1n in Mexico, he was teleported aboard the Mother Plane spaceship and there met with Elijah Muhammad\u2014who was not really dead\u2014to discuss the Nation's future. During the 1990s, Farrakhan was introduced to the Church of Scientology and in 2006 he was honoured at the Church-sponsored Ebony Awakening Awards. In 2010, Farrakhan publicly embraced Scientology's system of Dianetics and encouraged NOI members to undergo auditing from the Church, further arguing that auditing was a method whereby whites could be purified of their inherent badness.\nFarrakhan's Nation expanded its international network, building links in Africa, and seeking a closer relationship with Muslims globally. By the late 1990s, Farrakhan's NOI opened its first mosques in Britain. Back in the US, the 1980s and 1990s saw growing numbers of rap and hip hop artists promote the Nation's message, despite Farrakhan's criticism of the thematic use of sex, violence, and drugs in these genres. Concerned by gang violence, especially among African American youths, in 1989 Farrakhan launched his \"Stop the Killing\" campaign. He played a key role in getting two of the country's largest gangs, the Bloods and the Crips, to sign a ceasefire in 1992.\nFarrakhan also organized the 1995 Million Man March through Washington, D.C. to counter negative portrayals of black manhood. This proved the largest black demonstration in US history.\nBeliefs.\nTheology.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nGod is a man and we just cannot make Him other than a man, lest we make Him an inferior one; for man's intelligence has no equal in other than man. His wisdom is infinite; capable of accomplishing anything that His brain can conceive.\nElijah Muhammad, \"Message to the Black Man\", 1965\nThe sociologist of religion David V. Barrett noted that the Nation's theology is \"very distinct\" and \"extremely detailed\". The Nation provides conflicting statements about its theology; although it professes commitment to the monotheistic idea of a single God, its discourse refers to multiple gods, meaning that it can be interpreted as polytheistic.\nIn the NOI's view, each Allah (God) is not an incorporeal spiritual entity but a flesh-and-blood person. These Allahs are anthropomorphic, taking the form of black men, which was the shape that the first Allah consciously adopted. In Nation teaching, the Allahs are not immortal, instead typically living for around 200 to 300 years. They have varying abilities and degrees of power, with each taking over following the death of their predecessor, after which they rule for a cycle in history. The Nation regards its founder, Fard Muhammad, as the latest of these Allahs, or \"God in person\". He is deemed the first to have attained the same powers as that of the earliest Allah, namely the ability to return the universe to its primordial darkness and then recreate it. The Nation teaches that although this founder disappeared in 1934, he would live for another 409 years.\nReflecting a belief in the inner divinity of humanity that is common among North America's black-oriented new religions, the Nation also promotes the idea that \"God is man and man is God, that God has a presence inside human individuals.\" Accordingly, the NOI teaches that the black race, in its natural state, is divine, a \"nation of Gods\", with Elijah Muhammad espousing the view that \"all Muslims are Allahs\". According to the NOI, \"knowledge of self\" is key for black people to realize their inner divinity. The NOI thus maintains that by following its teachings, its adherents can recognize their inner godliness. In doing so, it stipulates, black people will also recognise that they have psychic powers; Elijah Muhammad for instance claimed telepathic abilities.\nThe Nation of Islam's theology is \"completely divorced\" from mainstream Islam. In the latter, God is a single, monotheistic entity, one that is eternal and non-anthropomorphic; Islam also stresses that there is a fundamental ontological divide between humanity and God, which is at odds with NOI teaching. Similarly conflicting with mainstream Islam is the NOI's claim that there is no afterlife; Elijah Muhammad wrote that \"when you are dead, you are DEAD\". Notions of Heaven, the Nation claims, are a lie used by white Christians to keep black people docile. Instead, Elijah Muhammad taught that there is no spiritual realm beyond the material universe.\nCosmogony and the Tribe of Shabazz.\nThe Nation teaches that in the beginning there was nothing but darkness. Then, 76 trillion years ago, the first Allah willed himself into being, taking 6 million years to form into his desired appearance: that of a black man. This color chosen was a reference to the blackness from which he had emerged. The first Allah then created the Sun and the planets, as well as fellow black gods, who lived predominantly on the Earth but also on Mars. Of these, the first Allah and 23 others formed a council of ruling imams: 12 greater and 12 lesser. Each of these imams would take a turn being the ruling Allah for one cycle each.\nThe NOI refers to these early individuals as \"god-scientists\". They are part of what it calls the \"Original\" or \"Asiatic\" race, a people who were divided into 13 tribes. The Nation labels these people \"black\", describing them as having dark skin as well as smooth, straight hair, closely resembling dark-complexioned Arabians or South Asians rather than Sub-Saharan Africans. In portraying humanity as the creation of the first Allah, rather than a product of evolution, the Nation endorses a unique form of creationism and believes dinosaurs to be a hoax created by white scientists.\nAccording to Nation teaching, one of the god-scientists was a renegade and, 66 trillion years ago, tried to destroy the Earth with explosives. The resulting explosion forced a chunk of the Earth's mass into orbit, where it became the moon. One of the 13 tribes was trapped on the moon, where they died due to lack of water. The Nation also maintains that 15,000 years ago, the god-scientists wrote down knowledge of the future in a text, the Mother Book, parts of which have passed down in the Torah, Gospels, and Quran.\nOf the 12 tribes that remained on Earth, the most resilient was the Tribe of Shabazz, who settled in Egypt's Nile Valley and the area around Mecca in the Arabian peninsula. The Nation calls this region \"East Asia\", reflecting its belief that Asia and Africa were once a single continent. It was because they moved into the \"jungles of East Asia\" (i.e. Africa), Elijah Muhammad claimed, that members of this Original Asiatic Race developed Afro-textured hair. The Nation teaches that the Original Race were Muslims by their intrinsic nature, but that many created heretical deviations such as Hinduism; some of those who broke Islamic rules were exiled to North America, where they became the continent's native population.\nFor the Nation, everyone not of West European genetic origin is a descendant of the Original Asiatic Race. In contrast to understandings of race held by most Americans, for the Nation, \"black\" does not simply mean those of Sub-Saharan African genetic descent, but all people of color, including Asians, North Africans, and Native Americans. Even some Eastern Europeans, such as Albanians, are considered descendants of the Original Asiatic Race. Elijah Muhammad for instance referred to \"black, brown, yellow [and] red\" people as collectively constituting \"black mankind\", which he then juxtaposed against the \"white race\".\nMyth of Yakub.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe white race is not equal with darker people because the white race was not created by the God of Righteousness[...] Yakub, the father of the devil, made the white race, a race of devils[...] The white race is not made by nature to accept righteousness. They know righteousness, but they cannot be righteous.\nElijah Muhammad, \"Our Savior Has Arrived\", 1974\nThe NOI promotes a story about a figure known as Yakub. The story received its fullest exposition in Elijah Muhammad's 1965 book \"Message to the Blackman\". In this narrative, Yakub was a black scientist; a child prodigy, by the age of 18 he had learned everything that Mecca's universities had to teach him. He attracted a following but caused trouble, leading the Meccan authorities to exile him and his 59,999 followers to Pelan, the Mediterranean island of Patmos.\nOn Pelan, the NOI claims, Yakub engaged in a selective breeding program to create the white race. This entailed breeding new children, with those who were too dark killed at birth and their bodies fed to wild animals or incinerated. Over several centuries, Yakub's experiments created a blonde, light-skinned people, the white race. The Nation maintains that most white people are unaware of their true origins, but that such knowledge is held by senior white Freemasons. The NOI teaches that, as a group of people distinct from the Original Asiatic Race, the white race are degenerate, sub-human, bereft of divinity, and intrinsically prone to lying, violence, and brutality. Elijah Muhammad repeatedly referred to whites as \"the devil\". Various academic commentators have characterised these views as racist. \nAccording to the Nation's teachings, Yakub's newly created white race sowed discord among black people, and thus were exiled to live in the caves of \"West Asia\", meaning Europe. In this narrative, it was in Europe that the white race engaged in bestiality; their attempts to restore their blackness resulted in the creation of apes and monkeys. To help the whites develop, the ruling Allah sent prophets to them, the first of whom was Musa (Moses), who taught the whites to cook and wear clothes. According to the Nation, Jesus was also a prophet sent to civilise the white race. The group rejects the Christian belief that Jesus was a unique manifestation of God, that he was the Messiah, was the product of a virgin birth, or was crucified and resurrected.\nWhite rule and antisemitic conspiracism.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nGod say you're the real devil. And you damn sure are. Ain't another devil nowhere else. Ain't no use you get mad with me, white people. You are the devil. The only hell-raiser on the earth. I'm not sayin' that you are responsible, 'cause you are made devil. But I'm not gonna make a mistake in thinkin' that you can be made better through love.\nLouis Farrakhan\u2019s views on white people being the devil\nIn the Nation's teachings, the ruling Allah permitted the white race to rule the Earth for 6000 years. The whites subsequently began to dominate the world, using treacherous tactics that the Nation calls \"tricknology\". The group maintains that the ruling Allahs allowed this so that black people would discover humanity's inner potential for evil and learn how to defeat it, thus enabling them to realize their inner divine capacity. According to this teaching, the period of white rule came to an end in 1914.\nDuring the era of white rule, the Nation states, the whites enslaved the Tribe of Shabazz, shipping many of them to the Americas through the Atlantic slave trade. The NOI claims that most enslaved blacks forgot their true names, their Arabic language, and their Muslim identity, instead embracing Christianity, which the Nation labels \"white man's religion\". The group deems Christianity a tool of white supremacy used to subjugate black people, and expresses the belief that the oppressed (African Americans) and the oppressors (European Americans) cannot share the same god. The Nation claims that in their enslaved state, black people have lost their morality by engaging in sinful behaviour such as fornication and drinking alcohol, something encouraged by the whites. In making this argument, the NOI equates the United States with the city of Babylon as presented in the Bible.\nThe Nation thus understands the modern subjugation of African Americans as part of an ancient white conspiracy. The group interprets many of the problems facing African Americans in this light; Farrakhan for instance claimed that the white establishment encouraged a black gang culture to provide an excuse for the police killing of black youths, that they flooded black-majority areas with drugs, and that they created AIDS to exterminate black people. The Nation is also critical of US aggression towards countries with non-white and Muslim majorities, and in keeping with its ethos has adopted an anti-Zionist position regarding Israel.\nFor Elijah Muhammad, white Jews were regarded as part of the white race and thus not intrinsically worse than other whites. Instead, he suggested that Orthodox Jews, by following the laws set down by Moses, had raised themselves to a higher spiritual level than other whites. In later years, accusations of antisemitism were repeatedly made against both Farrakhan and his NOI. Farrakhan promoted antisemitic tropes about a Jewish cabal controlling the US government, banking systems, universities, and entertainment sector. Elsewhere, Farrakhan called Judaism a \"dirty religion\", and described Adolf Hitler as a \"very great man\". \nSimilarly, at a Kean College speech in 1993, NOI representative Khalid Abdul Muhammad referred to the \"Jew-nited Nations\" in \"Jew York City\" and stated that the Jewish people deserved Hitler. NOI spokespersons have made claims linking Jews to conspiracy theories about vaccines, with the NOI health minister Abdul Alim Muhammad accusing Jewish doctors of injecting blacks with AIDS, and NOI official Ishmael Muhammad claiming that Jews were receiving different COVID-19 vaccines from other people. The group has also espoused the claim that Jews were disproportionately responsible for the Atlantic slave trade, promoting these ideas in its anonymously authored book from 1991, \"The Secret Relationship Between Blacks and Jews\".\nEschatology and the Mother Plane.\nThe NOI is millenarian, believing that humanity is living in end times. It propounds a distinct eschatology drawing on the Book of Revelation. Central to its view of the apocalypse is a large spaceship, known as the Mother Plane, the Mother Ship, or the Wheel, and which members usually refer to using female pronouns. Elijah Muhammad described this as \"a small human planet\", claiming that it is half a mile in diameter. The Nation teaches that this vessel is the Merkabah that appears in the Book of Ezekiel (1:4\u201328). It maintains that Allah and many of his scientists live in a magnificent city on the Mother Plane, from which they monitor humanity; Farrakhan has claimed that Elijah Muhammad never died but is resident aboard this ship. The Nation teaches that there are also smaller vessels, \"baby planes\", docked inside the Mother Plane and that these travel to Earth. Sightings of these baby planes, as well as the Mother Plane itself, are used to explain reports of unidentified flying objects.\nThe Nation teaches that a period of deteriorating racial tensions will culminate in the apocalypse. NOI members have repeatedly claimed that this apocalypse is imminent; in the early 1960s, Elijah Muhammad was predicting that it would occur in 1965 or 1966, Farrakhan later stated that the Gulf War of 1990 would spark it, while Tynetta Muhammad thought it would occur in 2001. According to Nation teaching, the apocalypse will come when the Mother Plane appears above the Earth and transports the righteous to live aboard it. It will then use the baby planes to bury bombs beneath the Earth's surface, which on detonation will wipe out the old, white-dominated order. Elijah Muhammad once stated that \"There will be no such thing as elimination of all white people from the earth\", for those who embrace Islam \"can be saved\". The NOI has taught that the white ruling elite are aware of this forthcoming apocalypse and that the US exploration of space and the Strategic Defense Initiative are futile attempts to protect themselves against the Mother Plane.\nAccording to this account, after the bombs explode the Earth's atmosphere will burn for 390 years and spend another 610 cooling down. Once the Earth has returned to a habitable state, the ruling Allah will return the righteous to live on the planet, in a new black paradise. In his book \"The Supreme Wisdom\", Elijah Muhammad claimed that after the apocalypse, \"Peace, joy and happiness will have no end.\" He added that those living in this perfect society will eat the finest food and wear clothes of silk interwoven with gold.\nBlack nationalism and separatism.\nIdeologically, the NOI is black nationalist. Scholar of religion Mattias Gardell commented that the idea of black unity is \"at the very core of the NOI ideology\". The group seeks to empower black people by giving them a positive self-identity, purging ideas they may have of white superiority and black inferiority. Instead, it espouses a cosmology in which the black race is superior and the white race inferior. Black people are therefore presented as Allah's chosen people.\nThe Nation is black separatist, rejecting the integration of black and white people. This racial separatism put the NOI at odds with the mainstream civil rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s. The Nation was critical of African American activists who promoted racial integration, such as Martin Luther King Jr. and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, regarding them as \"Uncle Tom Negroes\". The Nation's position that self-defence was a moral obligation for African Americans similarly differed from the civil rights movement's focus on non-violent opposition to racial discrimination and segregation. Some commentators have associated the Nation with the Black Power movement that emerged in the late 1960s, and the Nation claimed that it inspired the latter phenomenon.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWe want our people in America whose parents or grandparents are descendants from slaves to be allowed to establish a separate state or territory of their own, either on this continent or elsewhere. We believe that our former slave masters are obligated to provide such land and that the area must be fertile and minerally rich.\nElijah Muhammad, 1965\nThe NOI has called for the creation of a separate, sovereign African American nation-state in the southern part of what is currently the United States, with Elijah Muhammad stipulating that the US should financially support this new country for 20 to 25 years. This is presented as compensation for the unpaid labor of their enslaved ancestors. Farrakhan has also suggested that the countries of Africa should set aside land on that continent for the African diaspora, characterising this as a reparation for the complicity of West African states in the Atlantic slave trade. Gardell suggested that any nation-state formed under the Nation's leadership would be theocratic, authoritarian, and totalitarian.\nUnlike the Garveyites and Rastafari who emphasise links between the African diaspora and Africa itself, Elijah Muhammad and the NOI have instead focused their attention on the African diaspora in the Americas. Elijah Muhammad stated that \"where as the Black man in Africa is our brother, our central responsibility is with the Black man here in the wilderness of North America\". The group reject a specifically Pan-African ideology, and rather than treating Africa as a homeland, the Nation's origin myths present Mecca as the original home of African Americans. Nation writings portray Africa itself as the least desirable of the Original Asiatic lands, with the scholar of religion Michael Muhammad Knight arguing that Elijah Muhammad \"upheld white supremacist tropes\" about African cultures. The latter for instance complained of Africans' \"savage dress and hair styles,\" forbidding NOI members from imitating them, and stating that it was the Nation's job to \"civilize Africa\".\nGender and sexuality issues.\nThe NOI's teachings on gender are conservative and patriarchal, promoting strict gender roles. Seeking to restore black manhood, the Nation expresses great concern regarding the emasculation of black men, attributing this attitude to the failure of black men to prevent white men's sexual assault of black women over the centuries.\nEmphasis is placed on the family unit, with the Nation maintaining that the security of the black family is ensured when its members adhere to their gendered responsibilities. The group is critical of the historically matrifocal focus of many African American families, instead stressing the importance of a male family figurehead. Men are encouraged to be economic providers for their family; women to be caretakers of the household and the children. Outsiders often perceive the Nation's women as victims of male oppression, and some ex-Nation women have complained of a controlling and repressive atmosphere in the group.\nThe NOI's leadership is overwhelmingly male. Despite this, Clara Muhammad led the group while Elijah Muhammad was incarcerated between 1942 and 1946, and during the 1990s several women rose to senior positions; in 1998 the Nation appointed its first woman minister, Ava Muhammad, as head of Mosque Number 15 in Georgia. Women have also been allowed leadership in the Muslim Girls Training group and in the NOI's schools and businesses. Various NOI women have played an active role in their communities, sometimes challenging established gender norms in the organization.\nThe NOI strictly enforces heterosexual monogamy among its members and encourages sexual abstinence prior to marriage. Despite the group's formal opposition to polygyny, Elijah Muhammad had sexual relations with multiple women and Farrakhan has referred to these as his \"wives\". The group has claimed that this was permitted because Elijah was God's messenger. Nation members are encouraged to wed other members, although marriage to non-members is permitted. The NOI stipulates that followers should only marry other black people, although marriage between Native, Latino, and African Americans is accepted. Marrying whites is taboo, with the group claiming that sex with white women emasculates black men.\nMen and women are discouraged from forming friendships with each other. Instead, members seeking to court each other are expected to inform the captain of their local Fruit of Islam or Muslim Girls Training branch about their intentions. Men found to have beaten their wives are temporarily suspended from Nation membership. Divorce is discouraged but not forbidden. NOI members are encouraged to have children, with Farrakhan also encouraging adoption. Children are expected to study hard, avoid street culture, and respect their elders. \nThe Nation criticises birth control methods as the white establishment's attempt to lower the black birthrate, although does not ban their use, and Farrakhan expressed support for abortion in cases of rape, incest or where the woman's life is endangered.\nSame-sex relationships are condemned as immoral. Elijah Muhammad complained that schools, jails, and prisons were \"breeding dens of homosexuals,\" while Farrakhan banned gay men from his Million Man March, bringing accusations of homophobia.\nPractices.\nServices, prayer, and celebration.\nDuring the 1960s and early 1970s, the NOI's places of worship were called both temples and mosques, although the latter term was consistently favored under both Wallace D. Muhammad and Farrakhan. These were each numbered in order of their foundation. As well as serving a religious function, these mosques can also be used as community centers, banks, schools, and child-care facilities. The figure leading a mosque is called the captain and will be a member of the Fruit of Islam subgroup.\nThose attending meetings will sometimes be searched by members of the Fruit of Islam or the Muslim Girl's Training group, who look for weapons and for objects like cosmetics and cigarettes which are disapproved of. After this, attendees are seen to their seats, usually rows of benches. The sexes are segregated during worship; women on the right and men on the left. The tone of Nation services is sombre and quiet. Services typically begin with the statement \"As-salamu alaykum\" (peace be upon you), with the congregation responding \"Wa 'alaikum As-salam\" (and also upon you). Meetings at the mosque are both opened and closed with prayers, and the Nation's \"national anthem\" may be played. A lecture is provided by a minister, who may also read verses from either the Bible or Quran.\nIn the late 1950s, Elijah Muhammad published a prayer manual outlining how his followers should pray five times a day. This involved an ablution beforehand, typically involving washing the hands, face, and ears, symbolically associating physical cleanliness with the purification of the body more broadly. Women are expected to cover their heads while praying. Elijah Muhammad stipulated that these prayers should be in English, although commented that in future he would explain how to do so in Arabic. In later articles, he explained that his followers should face towards Mecca as they pray, symbolising their journey toward the restoration of black greatness.\nThe most important date in the Nation's year is February 26, Saviors' Day, which members believe is the birthday of Fard Muhammad. This is the date on which the organization holds its annual national convention. Under Farrakhan, the Nation introduced a second Savior's Day each year, on October 7, to mark the birth of Elijah Muhammad. In the 1990s, Farrakhan's Nation also introduced an annual event called the World's Day of Atonement or Holy Day of Atonement, held over the course of October 15 and 16; this is characterised by fasting, prayer, and reconciliation. In addition to marking festivals, NOI members are encouraged to make the hajj pilgrimage to Mecca; Elijah Muhammad himself did so three times.\nLifestyle.\nThe Nation requests that, as a declaration of mental emancipation, new members change any names inherited from slave-owners who possessed their ancestors. This is not considered necessary if the new member has a name that is already African in origin. In the NOI's early years, Fard Muhammad bestowed new names on followers for a $10 fee. During the mid-20th century the Nation began encouraging the use of \"X\" as a surname, symbolising what they regarded as the African-American's identity as an \"ex-slave\" and also as a marker for their lost ancestral name. As this results in many individuals having the same name, numbers are added before the X to differentiate members (i.e. \"Charles 2X\", \"Charles 3X\").\nThe NOI encourages its followers to live highly disciplined and structured lifestyles; this conservative and ascetic approach has led to followers being called \"Black Puritans\". Nation members are encouraged to obey the law, to seek gainful employment, to always be punctual, to avoid buying on credit, and to never gamble. They are also urged not to rely on state welfare payments, with the Nation arguing that these undermine the African American community's ability to be self-sufficient.\nMale members typically cut their hair short, sometimes shaving the head entirely, and do not usually wear beards. This signifies their willingness to abide to the Nation's strict rules and their renunciation of much personal choice. They are expected to wear suits with either ties or bowties; those who are part of the Fruit of Islam wear military-style uniforms, sometimes accompanied by a fez. Women are commanded to dress modestly; they are not permitted to wear trousers, are expected to wear long sleeves, and are encouraged to cover their heads. Cosmetics and the chemical or heat-based straightening of hair is also discouraged.\nDietary requirements.\nThe NOI teaches that practitioners should keep fit and maintain a healthy diet, as part of which it espouses strict dietary rules. These were outlined by Elijah Muhammad, who claimed to have received them from Fard Muhammad. \nVegetarianism is encouraged, although not obligatory, with Elijah Muhammad writing that \"meat was never intended for man to eat\". In \"How to Eat to Live\", Elijah Muhammad urged his followers to subsist primarily on fruit, vegetables, and certain grains, and to choose lamb if they must eat meat. Pork is explicitly forbidden on the traditional Muslim grounds that pigs are deemed unclean. Other discouraged foods include dried fruits, white flour, additives, and fast food. Although its own produce is not wholly organic, the Nation is supportive of organic food and the avoidance of genetically modified crops, insecticides, and pesticides.\nThe NOI also encourages followers to avoid foods associated with the slave culture of the US, such as cornbread, catfish, and collard greens, deeming this cuisine to be undignified and unhealthy. Concerned about obesity and diabetes among African Americans, Elijah Muhammad urged his followers to restrict their caloric intake, ideally by eating only one meal a day. He claimed that this would extend the human lifespan, asserting that those who ate only once every 24 hours would live for 150 years and that those who ate once every seven days would live for 1,050 years. Members are also encouraged to conduct regular three-day fasts, and to fast during the daylight for the entirety of December. The NOI also prohibits the use of alcohol, tobacco, and other recreational drugs. In addition, it advises that followers avoid the use of vaccines, typically deeming them part of a white conspiracy to deplete populations of color.\nEconomic and educational independence.\nEspousing economic nationalism, the Nation follows the ideas of earlier thinkers like Booker T. Washington and Marcus Garvey in emphasizing the construction of African American infrastructure as a means of community empowerment. The Nation has created many companies, including the Salaam restaurant chain, the Shabazz bakeries, the Fashahnn Islamic clothing range, the Clean 'N Fresh skin and haircare products, and Abundant Life Clinics. These businesses provide income for the NOI and help tackle African American unemployment.\nSince the 1980s, the Nation has also sought government contracts, and in 1988, it established the Security Agency Incorporated to provide Fruit of Islam patrols for clients. In 1985 it launched its POWER (People Organized and Working for Economic Rebirth) project, designed to redirect black purchasing power toward black-owned businesses. It also seeks the collective economic advancement of African Americans through individual achievement; various women members have created their own businesses, sometimes run from the home. Some of its African American anti-capitalist critics have derided the Nation's economic approach as black capitalism. Farrakhan has responded that while socialism appeals to him, capitalism is the only feasible road to economic empowerment for African Americans.\nThe Nation prioritises land ownership to increase food production and autonomy for African Americans; a commonly used slogan among the NOI is that \"The farm is the engine of our national life.\" It established a farm in White Cloud, Michigan in 1947, and by the early 1970s owned 20,000 acres of farm land in Michigan, Alabama, and Georgia. In 1991, Farrakhan's Nation launched its Three Year Economic Savings Plan, asking followers to send them $10 a month over the three years, money that would collectively allow the group to buy more farmland. As a result, in 1994 it purchased 1,556 acres near Bronwood, Georgia, there establishing Muhammad Farms. Much of the produce grown there is distributed to NOI mosques around the country. The NOI hopes to establish a system of black-owned farms through which to feed 40 million black people, with the stated aim of providing at least one healthy meal a day for every African American. NOI members also own urban gardens in various US cities.\nThe NOI is highly critical of the US school system, believing that it has a Eurocentric focus and perpetuates white supremacy. To this end, the Nation has established its own educational system. As part of this it has formed Muhammad Universities of Islam; most of these are elementary schools, although a few also offer secondary education. These emphasize science, mathematics, black history, Arabic, and NOI doctrine; Farrakhan has said that the Nation needs to provide black children with \"an education to make them Gods\". In these schools, boys and girls are taught separately; pupils are only given two weeks of vacation each year. Combating the idea that academic achievement entails \"acting white\", the Nation has sought to associate hard work in school with pride in being black.\nCivic engagement.\nThe Nation has a longstanding record of involvement in civic, economic, and political activities. In certain areas with high African American populations, the NOI has engaged in door-to-door campaigns to raise awareness about local pollution, provided services that public institutions do not, and used the Fruit of Islam to patrol neighborhoods as a community watchdog\u2014especially to stop drug-dealing. These efforts have helped to integrate the Nation with the larger African American community and brought praise from within it.\nAlthough the scholar of religion Stephen C. Finley maintained that the NOI is \"first and foremost a religious community,\" the scholar Edward E. Curtis IV stated that the Nation is \"both highly religious and political at the same time\", while Gardell noted that the group \"formulated emphatic political demands\". The NOI has nevertheless urged its members to avoid mainstream electoral politics; throughout most of his leadership, Elijah Muhammad instructed his followers not to vote. Later, Farrakhan backed Jesse Jackson's 1984 campaign to become the Democratic Party's presidential candidate, and in 1990 three NOI candidates stood for election in the US. Although many outsiders have presumed the NOI to be a revolutionary movement, it has not sought to foment political revolution or violent social change, instead focusing its emphasis on shifting the consciousness of its members, encouraging them to focus on personal moral improvement, family building, and economic productivity.\nOrganization.\nLeadership and financing.\nThe Nation is highly hierarchical in its organization, being headquartered at its Mosque Maryam in Chicago. By the 2020s, it was governed by an executive council of 13 members, a number that may allude to the original 13 tribes of humanity in NOI belief. It also consists of ten ministries: for Spiritual Development, Agriculture, Education, Information, Health, Trade and Commerce, Defense, Justice, Arts and Culture, and Science and Technology. During its history it has also operated a shadow ministry, forming the prototype for the governance of the future state it hopes to lead. Within the group's senior ranks, family ties are important; various members of Elijah Muhammad's family were for instance married to members of Farrakhan's family.\nResponsible for the group's national security is the supreme captain, one of the most powerful roles in the organization. Security is largely provided by the Fruit of Islam, a group of men who are trained in military protocol, wrestling, boxing, and judo. Expected to strictly follow the Nation's rules, the Fruit are tasked with protecting NOI leaders, temples/mosques, and other NOI property. The Nation has also established Muslim Girls Training for women, whose members receive lessons in domestic skills and self defense tactics.\nThe NOI says that its finances come primarily from donations and its businesses. At the start of the 1960s, it was reported that members were expected to donate a set part of their earnings to the group each year; as of 1952, this reportedly constituted a third of a member's annual income. In 1976, Wallace Muhammad estimated the Nation's net worth to be $46 million, although revealed it had a severe cash flow problem, owed millions in back taxes to the Internal Revenue Service, and was making a loss with its agricultural operations. Although the Nation does not disclose the extent of its financial resources, in the 1990s its assets were estimated to total $80,000,000.\nPress and media.\nFrom its early days, the Nation used print media to promote its ideas, including the magazines \"Muhammad Speaks\" and \"The Final Call\". \"Muhammad Speaks\"\u2014which was published from 1961 to 1975\u2014included contributions not only from Nation members, but also from various African American leftists. Members were encouraged to sell these magazines on street corners or sometimes door-to-door in African American-majority areas. These sellers were given sales quotas to fulfil and were sometimes punished if they failed to meet them. The Nation's first magazine aimed at women, \"Righteous Living\", appeared in the early 1990s. Other media outputs have included shows on radio stations, videos, and various websites and social media accounts.\nDomestic and international affiliations.\nIn the 1930s and 1940s, the Nation had links with Satokata Takahashi, a Japanese man promoting pro-Japanese sentiment among African American groups. Takahashi lived with an officer of the Nation and also married a former member. Elijah Muhammad declared that Takahashi was teaching African Americans that \"the Japanese were brothers and friends of the American Negroes\". During the Second World War, in which the US fought Japan, many Nation members expressed pro-Japanese sentiment and refused the draft, stating that they would not fight people they regarded as fellow members of the Original Asiatic Race.\nUnder Elijah Muhammad, the Nation established relations with various Muslim countries. In 1957, Malcolm X organized a conference on colonialism attended by delegates from Egypt, Iraq, Sudan, and Morocco, while Elijah Muhammad met with Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser in 1959 and the Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi in 1972. For many years, Gaddafi was the Nation's most prominent international supporter and assisted them in various forms. His government gave the Nation a $3 million interest-free loan in 1972 to purchase its Chicago South Side centre, and another $5 million interest-free loan in 1985 to fund its black enterprise program. It later offered Farrakhan's Nation $1 billion, which the US government sought to block. On taking control, Farrakhan also pursued links with various Muslim-majority countries, visiting Ghana and Libya in 1985, and embarking on a larger tour of Africa and the Middle East in 1996, meeting with leaders including Gaddafi, Ghana's Jerry Rawlings, Nigeria's Sani Abacha, South Africa's Nelson Mandela, and Iraq's Saddam Hussein. On that tour, he also attended annual celebrations of the Iranian Revolution in Tehran; he visited Iran again in 2018.\nLike Garvey's UNIA before them, the Nation built links with white nationalist and other far-right white groups on the basis of their shared belief in racial separatism. Malcolm X revealed that the Nation had held meetings with representatives of the Ku Klux Klan (KKK) and the American Nazi Party (ANP). The ANP's leader George Lincoln Rockwell attended an NOI rally in Washington, D.C. in 1961 and then spoke at the Nation's St Savior's Day rally in Chicago in 1962. Links with the white far-right continued under Farrakhan's Nation, with Tom Metzger of the White Aryan Resistance donating money to the Nation in 1985 and expressing approval of its separatist aims. During the 1980s, the Nation also had a supportive relationship with the British National Front as the latter's Strasserite leadership were endorsing a united front against multi-racial society. By the 1990s, the Nation collaborated with members of the far-right LaRouche movement as part of their shared opposition to the US-led Gulf War. These links have not prevented some white far-right opposition to the NOI; in 1993 the Fourth Reich Skinheads were revealed to have plotted to kill Farrakhan.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIn their testimonies of \"What Islam Has Done For Me,\" most believers offered personal narratives about what life was like before conversion to [the Nation of] Islam, how they came to convert, and what happened to them as a result. These moving tales often included the stories of how ex-convicts, drug addicts, and sexually promiscuous men and women came to find pride, self-esteem, dignity, good health, a sense of peace and security, a happy marriage, and gainful employment as a result of their conversion.\nHistorian Edward E. Curtis IV\nThe Nation does not publish the size of its membership, and there have been no censuses to determine a reliable number. Under Fard Muhammad's leadership, it reached a total of approximately 8,000 members, while by 1960 its membership was being estimated at between 30,000 and 100,000. In 2007, the scholar of religion Lawrence A. Mamiya suggested that there were then around 50,000 members of the Nation. At various points, the Nation has had a high turnover of membership, with many converts having left the movement, sometimes developing into Sunni Muslims.\nWhile based in the US, the Nation has also established either a presence or influence among African diasporic communities elsewhere; in 2006, the scholar Nuri Tinaz suggested that the Nation \"may have\" up to 2,000 members and sympathisers in the United Kingdom. Despite its focus on African Americans, since the era of Elijah Muhammad it has also made efforts to recruit Latino and Native Americans. As of 2009, Latinos were estimated to comprise over 20 percent of the Nation's membership, although some complained of facing ethnic prejudice within the organisation.\nIn its early decades, the Nation's appeal was strongest in poor African American neighborhoods, but over the course of the 20th century the NOI's membership became increasingly middle-class. Gardell suggested that this was partly due to the Nation's focus on hard work and rigid morality, which helped improve the economic situation of its members, coupled with the broader growth of the African American middle class in this period. He also believed that the changing class composition, and with it a less hostile attitude to white-dominant American society, assisted the shift to Sunnism under Wallace Muhammad in the 1970s. \nConversion.\nThe NOI refers to its proselytising efforts as \"fishing for the dead\". To this end, the Nation holds regular open meetings, mass rallies, street-corner lectures, and prison outreach, seeking new recruits in \"jails and penitentiaries, pool halls and barbershops, college campuses and street corners\". It has used books by Elijah Muhammad, radio broadcasts, and audio-recorded speeches to promote its message. Through this, it has sought to attract unemployed, disenchanted black youth, as well as those disaffected with Christianity.\nThe NOI's recruitment efforts have proven particularly effective among drug addicts and incarcerated criminals. The Nation was active in prison ministry by the 1950s, with its numbers of imprisoned followers rising steadily in the latter part of that decade; many members, including Malcolm X, were recruited while in prison. Farrakhan stepped up the prison ministry in the 1980s in response to the growing incarceration of young black men under Ronald Reagan's presidential administration. By the early 1960s, prison authorities were raising concerns that the NOI was exacerbating racial tensions in prisons. Some incarcerated members have claimed to have experienced discriminatory treatment from prison authorities because of their religion, and in certain cases have filed legal action as a result.\nVarious motivations have led people to join the Nation. Some members for instance reported that joining helped them with their low self-esteem or depression; the historian Zoe Colley thought that the Nation appealed to men living in poverty by offering them the \"opportunity to reclaim their manhood and sense of pride\". Ula Y. Taylor, a scholar of African American studies, suggested that female members were attracted by the Nation's offer of a \"stable family life\" and the opportunity to get involved in \"the development of a new black nation\". The Nation also attracted followers with its offer of a separate schooling system where African American children would not suffer the racism found in the mainstream public school system.\nReception and influence.\nAt the start of the 21st century, Barrett called the NOI \"one of the most visible and controversial black religions\", while in the 1990s Gardell termed it the \"most renowned and controversial\" of the African American Muslim groups. According to the black studies scholar Malachi D. Crawford, the NOI became \"perhaps the most influential African American religious community in the twentieth century\".\nVarious groups have broken from the Nation during its history, including Clarence 13X's Five-Percent Nation, Silas Muhammad's Original Nation of Islam, and Solomon Muhammad's United Nation of Islam. The NOI has also influenced the development of other religious movements, including the Nuwaubian Nation, whose founder and leader, Dwight York, claimed that Elijah Muhammad had heralded his own arrival much as John the Baptist heralded the arrival of Jesus in Christian belief. Influences from the NOI have also been argued for the Word of Faith movement.\nThe black studies scholar Priscilla McCutcheon noted that although the NOI remained comparatively small, it had \"a wide discursive reach\", while in 1996 Gardell commented that its influence among black youth \"far exceeds\" its membership. Among those influenced by it have been hip hop and rap artists like Public Enemy, Ice Cube, Kam, The Skinny Boys, and Sister Souljah. The Nation has cultivated a sense of pride among many African Americans, and its role in confronting gang violence, drugs, and poverty within African American communities has earned it respect. The sociologist A.A. Akom opined that the NOI had a reputation among African Americans of \"speaking truth to power\"; a 1994 \"Time\"/CNN poll found that two-thirds of African Americans who knew of Farrakhan viewed him favorably. Similarly positive assessments of the Nation have been observed among black communities in Britain.\nDespite reticence from the Nation itself during much of its history, the group has been the subject of much scholarly attention. Initial research, largely undertaken by historians and sociologists in the late 1950s and 1960s, was often hostile or dismissive; research influenced by disciplines like religious studies and gender studies followed later. \nOpposition and criticisms.\nBoth black and non-black people have criticised the Nation. These critics often believe that its founder, Fard Muhammad, was a petty criminal out to swindle his followers. Outsiders to the Nation have often seen its teachings as illogical and irrational, with scientists having labeled its mythological accounts as pseudoscience, and historical and scientific errors having been highlighted in its leaders' claims. \nThe group has repeatedly been accused of stirring up anti-white racial hatred, as for instance in Khalid Abdul Muhammad's Kean College speech where he stated that White South Africans should be given 24 hours to leave their country, with any remaining after that point being killed. The Nation has been labelled a \"hate group\" by the likes of the NAACP's Roy Wilkins, as well as the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), which accuses it of promoting black supremacism and anti-LGBT rhetoric. The SPLC's characterisation of the group has in turn been criticised as being inaccurate and inflammatory by Finley.\nThe NOI has also been accused of antisemitism by groups like the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), an organization that has placed the group under surveillance, lobbied against it, and attempted to block its enterprises. Four Jewish organizations withdrew their sponsorship of the Parliament of World Religions when it invited Farrakhan to speak, while Jewish student groups have picketed Farrakhan's speeches on university campuses. Far-right Jewish groups have gone further; the Jewish Defense League organized a 1985 \"Death to Farrakhan\" march, while the Jewish Defense Organization included Farrakhan on its kill list.\nMainstream Islamic groups maintain that the Nation's members are not really Muslim. Most mainstream Islamic organisations in the US have distanced themselves from the Nation, as have smaller Muslim groups like the Ahmadiyya. Elijah Muhammad dismissed these objections by claiming that the \"Old Islam\" of his critics was \"led by white people\". Farrakhan responded to such rejection with his own critique of the Islamic world, accusing it of racism, of being obedient to the US government, of engaging in sectarian violence, and of excessively relying on the \"hadith\" rather than the Quran.\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "21710", "revid": "38104346", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21710", "title": "Nerve agent", "text": "Class of organophosphates; classified as weapons of mass destruction\nNerve agents, sometimes also called nerve gases, are a class of organic chemicals that disrupt the mechanisms by which nerves transfer messages to organs. The disruption is caused by the blocking of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), an enzyme that catalyzes the breakdown of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter. Nerve agents are irreversible acetylcholinesterase inhibitors used as poison.\nPoisoning by a nerve agent leads to constriction of pupils, profuse salivation, convulsions, and involuntary urination and defecation, with the first symptoms appearing in seconds after exposure. Death by asphyxiation or cardiac arrest may follow in minutes due to the loss of the body's control over respiratory and other muscles. Some nerve agents are readily vaporized or aerosolized, and the primary portal of entry into the body is the respiratory system. Nerve agents can also be absorbed through the skin, requiring that those likely to be subjected to such agents wear a full body suit in addition to a respirator.\nNerve agents are generally colorless and flavorless liquids. Nerve agents evaporate at varying rates depending on the substance. None are gases in normal environments. The popular term \"nerve gas\" is inaccurate.\nAgents Sarin and VX are odorless; Tabun has a slightly fruity odor and Soman has a slight camphor odor.\nBiological effects.\nNerve agents attack the nervous system. All such agents function the same way resulting in cholinergic crisis: they inhibit the enzyme acetylcholinesterase, which is responsible for the breakdown of acetylcholine (ACh) in the synapses between nerves that control whether muscle tissues are to relax or contract. If the agent cannot be broken down, muscles are prevented from receiving 'relax' signals and they are effectively paralyzed. It is the compounding of this paralysis throughout the body that quickly leads to more severe complications, including the heart and the muscles used for breathing. Because of this, the first symptoms usually appear within 30 seconds of exposure and death can occur via asphyxiation or cardiac arrest in a few minutes, depending upon the dose received and the agent used.\nInitial symptoms following exposure to nerve agents (like Sarin) are a runny nose, tightness in the chest, and constriction of the pupils. Soon after, the victim will have difficulty breathing and will experience nausea and salivation. As the victim continues to lose control of bodily functions, involuntary salivation, lacrimation, urination, defecation, \ngastrointestinal pain and vomiting will be experienced. Blisters and burning of the eyes and/or lungs may also occur. This phase is followed by initially myoclonic jerks (muscle jerks) followed by status epilepticus\u2013type epileptic seizure. Death then comes via complete respiratory depression, most likely via the excessive peripheral activity at the neuromuscular junction of the diaphragm.\nThe effects of nerve agents are long lasting and increase with continued exposure. Survivors of nerve agent poisoning almost invariably develop chronic neurological damage and related psychiatric effects. Possible effects that can last at least up to two\u2013three years after exposure include blurred vision, tiredness, declined memory, hoarse voice, palpitations, sleeplessness, shoulder stiffness and eye strain. In people exposed to nerve agents, serum and erythrocyte acetylcholinesterase in the long-term are noticeably lower than normal and tend to be lower the worse the persisting symptoms are.\nMechanism of action.\nWhen a normally functioning motor nerve is stimulated, it releases the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which transmits the impulse to a muscle or organ. Once the impulse is sent, the enzyme acetylcholinesterase immediately breaks down the acetylcholine in order to allow the muscle or organ to relax.\nNerve agents disrupt the nervous system by inhibiting the function of the enzyme acetylcholinesterase by forming a covalent bond with its active site, where acetylcholine would normally be broken down (undergo hydrolysis). Acetylcholine thus builds up and continues to act so that any nerve impulses are continually transmitted and muscle contractions do not stop. This same action also occurs at the gland and organ levels, resulting in uncontrolled drooling, tearing of the eyes (lacrimation) and excess production of mucus from the nose (rhinorrhea).\nThe reaction product of the most important nerve agents, including Soman, Sarin, Tabun and VX, with acetylcholinesterase were solved by the U.S. Army using X-ray crystallography in the 1990s. The reaction products have been confirmed subsequently using different sources of acetylcholinesterase and the closely related target enzyme, butyrylcholinesterase. The X-ray structures clarify important aspects of the reaction mechanism (e.g., stereochemical inversion) at atomic resolution and provide a key tool for antidote development.\nTreatment.\nStandard treatment for nerve agent poisoning is a combination of an anticholinergic to manage the symptoms, and an oxime as an antidote. Anticholinergics treat the symptoms by reducing the effects of acetylcholine, while oximes displaces phosphate molecules from the active site of the cholinesterase enzymes, allowing the breakdown of acetylcholine. Military personnel are issued the combination in an autoinjector (e.g. ATNAA), for ease of use in stressful conditions.\nAtropine is the standard anticholinergic drug used to manage the symptoms of nerve agent poisoning. It acts as an antagonist to muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, blocking the effects of excess acetylcholine. Some synthetic anticholinergics, such as biperiden, may counteract the central symptoms of nerve agent poisoning more effectively than atropine, since they pass the blood\u2013brain barrier better. While these drugs will save the life of a person affected by nerve agents, that person may be incapacitated briefly or for an extended period, depending on the extent of exposure. The endpoint of atropine administration is the clearing of bronchial secretions.\nPralidoxime chloride (also known as \"2-PAMCl\") is the standard oxime used to treat nerve agent poisoning. Rather than counteracting the initial effects of the nerve agent on the nervous system as does atropine, pralidoxime chloride reactivates the poisoned enzyme (acetylcholinesterase) by scavenging the phosphoryl group attached on the functional hydroxyl group of the enzyme, counteracting the nerve agent itself. Revival of acetylcholinesterase with pralidoxime chloride works more effectively on nicotinic receptors while blocking acetylcholine receptors with atropine is more effective on muscarinic receptors.\nAnticonvulsants, such as diazepam, may be administered to manage seizures, improving long term prognosis and reducing risk of brain damage. This is not usually self-administered as its use is for actively seizing patients.\nCountermeasures.\nPyridostigmine bromide was used by the US military in the first Gulf War as a pretreatment for Soman as it increased the median lethal dose. It is only effective if taken prior to exposure and in conjunction with Atropine and Pralidoxime, issued in the Mark I NAAK autoinjector, and is ineffective against other nerve agents. While it reduces fatality rates, there is an increased risk of brain damage; this can be mitigated by administration of an anticonvulsant. Evidence suggests that the use of pyridostigmine may be responsible for some of the symptoms of Gulf War syndrome.\nButyrylcholinesterase is under development by the U.S. Department of Defense as a prophylactic countermeasure against organophosphate nerve agents. It binds nerve agent in the bloodstream before the poison can exert effects in the nervous system.\nBoth purified acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase have demonstrated success in animal studies as \"biological scavengers\" (and universal targets) to provide stoichiometric protection against the entire spectrum of organophosphate nerve agents. Butyrylcholinesterase currently is the preferred enzyme for development as a pharmaceutical drug primarily because it is a naturally circulating human plasma protein (superior pharmacokinetics) and its larger active site compared with acetylcholinesterase may permit greater flexibility for future design and improvement of butyrylcholinesterase to act as a nerve agent scavenger.\nClasses.\nThere are two main classes of nerve agents. The members of the two classes share similar properties and are given both a common name (such as \"Sarin\") and a two-character NATO identifier (such as GB).\nG-series.\nThe \"G-series\" is thus named because German scientists first synthesized them. G series agents are known as non-persistent, meaning that they evaporate shortly after release, and do not remain active in the dispersal area for very long. All of the compounds in this class were discovered and synthesized during or prior to World War II, by scientists working at IG Farben - a company which played an instrumental role in The Holocaust.\nThis series is the first and oldest family of nerve agents. The first nerve agent ever synthesized was GA (Tabun) in 1936. GB (Sarin) was discovered next in 1939, followed by GD (Soman) in 1944, and finally GF (Cyclosarin) in 1949. GB was the only G agent that was fielded by the US as a munition, in rockets, aerial bombs, and artillery shells.\nG agents are characterized by being almost industrially insoluble, as they are difficult to produce on a large scale at the same time in high purity and stability. The most problematic component is DF and the fluoride ion, with the United States being the only country capable of producing this precursor on a large scale and in a pure and stabilized form. Another component, which has fallen into disuse, is dimethylphosphoramido dicyanidate, which is equally problematic.\nReplacing the fluorine in methylphosphonofluoridates causes a sharp drop in toxicity, as does dimethylphosphoramidocyanidates. The stabilization of these compounds was focused on finding leaving groups that would replace the fluorine and cyanide ions - with the exception of phosphocholine-derived V agents -, this led to the development of some V agents, when the output group was bulky.\nV-series.\nThe \"V-series\" is the second family of nerve agents and contains five well known members: VE, VG, VM, VR, and VX, along with several more obscure analogues.\nThe most studied agent in this family, VX (it is thought that the \"X\" in its name comes from its overlapping isopropyl radicals), was invented in the 1950s at Porton Down in Wiltshire, England. Ranajit Ghosh, a chemist at the Plant Protection Laboratories of Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) was investigating a class of organophosphate compounds (organophosphate esters of substituted aminoethanethiols). Like Schrader, Ghosh found that they were quite effective pesticides. In 1953 and 1954, ICI conducted field trials, intending to market the material as an acaricide with the common name amiton. Development was halted, as it was too toxic for safe use. The toxicity did not escape military notice and some of the more toxic materials had been sent to Porton Down for evaluation. After the evaluation was complete, several members of this class of compounds became a new group of nerve agents, the V agents (depending on the source, the V stands for Victory, Venomous, or Viscous). The best known of these is probably VX, with VR (\"Russian V-gas\") coming a close second (amiton is largely forgotten as VG, with G probably coming from \"G\"hosh). All of the V-agents are persistent agents, meaning that these agents do not degrade or wash away easily and can therefore remain on clothes and other surfaces for long periods. In use, this allows the V-agents to be used to blanket terrain to guide or curtail the movement of enemy ground forces. The consistency of these agents is similar to oil; as a result, the contact hazard for V-agents is primarily \u2013 but not exclusively \u2013 dermal. VX was the only V-series agent that was fielded by the US as a munition, in rockets, artillery shells, airplane spray tanks, and landmines.\nAnalyzing the structure of thirteen V agents, the standard composition, which makes a compound enter this group, is the absence of halides. It is clear that many agricultural pesticides can be considered as V agents if they are notoriously toxic. The agent is not required to be a phosphonate and presents a dialkylaminoethyl group. The toxicity requirement is waived as the VT agent and its salts (VT-1 and VT-2) are \"non-toxic\". Replacing the sulfur atom with selenium increases the toxicity of the agent by orders of magnitude.\nNovichok agents.\nThe Novichok (Russian: , \"newcomer\") agents, a series of organophosphate compounds, were developed in the Soviet Union and in Russia from the mid-1960s to the 1990s. The Novichok program aimed to develop and manufacture highly deadly chemical weapons that were unknown to the West. The new agents were designed to be undetectable by standard NATO chemical-detection equipment and overcome contemporary chemical-protective equipment.\nIn addition to the newly developed \"third generation\" weapons, binary versions of several Soviet agents were developed and were designated as \"Novichok\" agents.\nCarbamates.\nContrary to some claims, not all nerve agents are organophosphates. The starting compound studied by the United States was the carbamate EA-1464, of notorious toxicity. Compounds similar in structure and effect to EA-1464 formed a large group, including compounds such as EA-3990 and EA-4056. The Family Practice Notebook claims carbamate-based nerve agents can be three times as toxic as VX. Both the United States and the Soviet Union\ndeveloped carbamate-based nerve agents during the Cold War. Carbamate-based nerve agents are sometimes grouped in academic literature with Fourth Generation Novichok agents, as they were added to the CWC schedule on banned agents at the same time, despite their significant differences in chemical makeup and mechanisms of action. Carbamate-based nerve agents have been identified as Schedule 1 Nerve Agents, the highest classification possible under the CWC, reserved for agents with no identified alternate use, and those that can cause the most harm.\nInsecticides.\nSome insecticides, including carbamates and organophosphates such as dichlorvos, carbofuran and parathion, are nerve agents. The metabolism of insects is sufficiently different from mammals that these compounds have little effect on humans and other mammals at proper doses, but there is considerable concern about the effects of long-term exposure to these chemicals by farm workers and animals alike. At high enough doses, acute toxicity and death can occur through the same mechanism as other nerve agents. Some insecticides such as demeton, dimefox and paraoxon are sufficiently toxic to humans that they have been withdrawn from agricultural use, and were at one stage investigated for potential military applications.\nParaoxon was allegedly used as an assassination weapon by the apartheid South African government as part of Project Coast. Organophosphate pesticide poisoning is a major cause of disability in many developing countries and is often the preferred method of suicide.\nSeveral pesticides were investigated as candidate chemical warfare agents, only when they demonstrated high activity in mammals. Paraoxon, mevinphos, and armine were the first agents investigated as chemical warfare agents, candidates G.\nMethods of dissemination.\nMany methods exist for spreading nerve agents such as:\nThe method chosen will depend on the physical properties of the nerve agent(s) used, the nature of the target, and the achievable level of sophistication.\nHistory.\nDiscovery.\nThis first class of nerve agents, the G-series, was accidentally discovered in Germany on 23 December 1936, by a research team headed by Gerhard Schrader working for IG Farben. Since 1934, Schrader had been working in a laboratory in Leverkusen to develop new types of insecticides for IG Farben. While working toward his goal of improved insecticide, Schrader experimented with numerous compounds, eventually leading to the preparation of Tabun.\nIn experiments, Tabun was extremely potent against insects: as little as 5 ppm of Tabun killed all the leaf lice he used in his initial experiment. In January 1937, Schrader observed the effects of nerve agents on human beings first-hand when a drop of Tabun spilled onto a lab bench. Within minutes he and his laboratory assistant began to experience miosis (constriction of the pupils of the eyes), dizziness and severe shortness of breath. It took them three weeks to recover fully.\nIn 1935 the Nazi government had passed a decree that required all inventions of possible military significance to be reported to the Ministry of War, so in May 1937 Schrader sent a sample of Tabun to the chemical warfare (CW) section of the Army Weapons Office in Berlin-Spandau. Schrader was summoned to the Wehrmacht chemical lab in Berlin to give a demonstration, after which Schrader's patent application and all related research was classified as secret. Colonel R\u00fcdiger, head of the CW section, ordered the construction of new laboratories for the further investigation of Tabun and other organophosphate compounds and Schrader soon moved to a new laboratory at Wuppertal-Elberfeld in the Ruhr valley to continue his research in secret throughout World War II. The compound was initially codenamed Le-100 and later Trilon-83.\nSarin was discovered by Schrader and his team in 1938 and named in honor of its discoverers: Gerhard Schrader, Otto Ambros, Gerhard Ritter, and Hans-J\u00fcrgen von der Linde. It was codenamed T-144 or Trilon-46. It was found to be more than ten times as potent as Tabun.\nSoman was discovered by Richard Kuhn in 1944 as he worked with the existing compounds; the name is derived from either the Greek 'to sleep' or the Latin 'to bludgeon'. It was codenamed T-300.\nCyclosarin was also discovered during WWII but the details were lost and it was rediscovered in 1949.\nThe G-series naming system was created by the United States when it uncovered the German activities, labeling Tabun as GA (German Agent A), Sarin as GB and Soman as GD. Ethyl Sarin was tagged GE and Cyclosarin as GF.\nDuring World War II.\nIn 1939, a pilot plant for Tabun production was set up at Munster-Lager, on L\u00fcneburg Heath near the German Army proving grounds at Raubkammer. In January 1940, construction began on a secret plant, code named \"Hochwerk\" (\"High factory\"), for the production of Tabun at \"Dyhernfurth an der Oder\" (now Brzeg Dolny in Poland), on the Oder River from Breslau (now Wroc\u0142aw) in Silesia.\nThe plant was large, covering an area of and was completely self-contained, synthesizing all intermediates as well as the final product, Tabun. The factory even had an underground plant for filling munitions, which were then stored at Krappitz (now Krapkowice) in Upper Silesia. The plant was operated by Anorgana GmbH, a subsidiary of IG Farben, as were all other chemical weapon agent production plants in Germany at the time.\nBecause of the plant's deep secrecy and the difficult nature of the production process, it took from January 1940 until June 1942 for the plant to become fully operational. Many of Tabun's chemical precursors were so corrosive that reaction chambers not lined with quartz or silver soon became useless. Tabun itself was so hazardous that the final processes had to be performed while enclosed in double glass-lined chambers with a stream of pressurized air circulating between the walls.\nThree thousand German nationals were employed at Hochwerk, all equipped with respirators and clothing constructed of a poly-layered rubber/cloth/rubber sandwich that was destroyed after the tenth wearing. Despite all precautions, there were over 300 accidents before production even began and at least ten workers died during the two and a half years of operation. Some incidents cited in \"A Higher Form of Killing: The Secret History of Chemical and Biological Warfare\" are as follows:\n and moved, probably to Dzerzhinsk, USSR.\nIn 1940 the German Army Weapons Office ordered the mass production of Sarin for wartime use. A number of pilot plants were built and a high-production facility was under construction (but was not finished) by the end of World War II. Estimates for total Sarin production by Nazi Germany range from 500\u00a0kg to 10 tons.\nDuring that time, German intelligence believed that the Allies also knew of these compounds, assuming that because these compounds were not discussed in the Allies' scientific journals information about them was being suppressed. Though Sarin, Tabun and Soman were incorporated into artillery shells, the German government ultimately decided not to use nerve agents against Allied targets. The Allies did not learn of these agents until shells filled with them were captured towards the end of the war. German forces used chemical warfare against partisans during the Battle of the Kerch Peninsula in 1942, but did not use any nerve agent.\nThis is detailed in Joseph Borkin's book \"The Crime and Punishment of IG Farben\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Speer, who was strongly opposed to the introduction of Tabun, flew Otto Ambros, I.G.'s authority on poison gas as well as synthetic rubber, to the meeting. Hitler asked Ambros, \"What is the other side doing about poison gas?\" Ambros explained that the enemy, because of its greater access to ethylene, probably had a greater capacity to produce mustard gas than Germany did. Hitler interrupted to explain that he was not referring to traditional poison gases: \"I understand that the countries with petroleum are in a position to make more [mustard gas], but Germany has a special gas, Tabun. In this we have a monopoly in Germany.\" He specifically wanted to know whether the enemy had access to such a gas and what it was doing in this area. To Hitler's disappointment Ambros replied, \"I have justified reasons to assume that Tabun, too, is known abroad. I know that Tabun was publicized as early as 1902, that Sarin was patented and that these substances appeared in patents. \" (...)Ambros was informing Hitler of an extraordinary fact about one of Germany's most secret weapons. The essential nature of Tabun and Sarin had already been disclosed in the technical journals as far back as 1902 and I.G. had patented both products in 1937 and 1938. Ambros then warned Hitler that if Germany used Tabun, it must face the possibility that the Allies could produce this gas in much larger quantities. Upon receiving this discouraging report, Hitler abruptly left the meeting. The nerve gases would not be used, for the time being at least, although they would continue to be produced and tested.\u2014\u200a\nPost\u2013World War II.\nSince World War II, Iraq's use of mustard gas against Iranian troops and Kurds (Iran\u2013Iraq War of 1980\u20131988) has been the only large-scale use of any chemical weapons. On the scale of the single Kurdish village of Halabja within its own territory, Iraqi forces did expose the populace to some kind of chemical weapons, possibly mustard gas and most likely nerve agents.\nOperatives of the Aum Shinrikyo religious group made and used Sarin several times on Japanese citizens, most notably in the Tokyo subway sarin attack.\nIn the Gulf War, no nerve agents (nor other chemical weapons) were used, but a number of U.S. and UK personnel were exposed to them when the Khamisiyah chemical depot was destroyed. This and the widespread use of anticholinergic drugs as a protective treatment against any possible nerve gas attack have been proposed as a possible cause of Gulf War syndrome.\nSarin gas was deployed in a 2013 attack on Ghouta during the Syrian Civil War, killing several hundred people. Most governments contend that forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad deployed the gas; however, the Syrian Government has denied responsibility.\nOn 13 February 2017, the nerve agent VX was used in the assassination of Kim Jong-nam, half-brother of the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, at Kuala Lumpur International Airport in Malaysia.\nOn 4 March 2018, a former Russian agent (who was convicted of high treason but allowed to live in the United Kingdom via a spy swap agreement), Sergei Skripal, and his daughter, who was visiting from Moscow, were both poisoned by a Novichok nerve agent in the English city of Salisbury. They survived, and were subsequently released from hospital. In addition, a Wiltshire Police officer, Nick Bailey, was exposed to the substance. He was one of the first to respond to the incident. Twenty-one members of the public received medical treatment following exposure to the nerve agent. Despite this, only Bailey and the Skripals remained in critical condition. On 11 March 2018, Public Health England issued advice for the other people believed to have been in the Mill pub (the location where the attack is believed to have been carried out) or the nearby Zizzi Restaurant. On 12 March 2018, British Prime Minister Theresa May stated that the substance used was a Novichok nerve agent.\nOn 30 June 2018, two British nationals, Charlie Rowley and Dawn Sturgess, were poisoned by a Novichok nerve agent of the same kind that was used in the Skripal poisoning, which Rowley had found in a discarded perfume bottle and gifted to Sturgess. Whilst Rowley survived, Sturgess died on 8 July. Metropolitan Police believe that the poisoning was not a targeted attack, but a result of the way the nerve agent was disposed of after the poisoning in Salisbury.\nOcean disposal.\nIn 1972, the United States Congress banned the practice of disposing chemical weapons into the ocean. Thirty-two thousand tons of nerve and mustard agents had already been dumped into the ocean waters off the United States by the U.S. Army, primarily as part of Operation CHASE. According to a 1998 report by William Brankowitz, a deputy project manager in the U.S. Army Chemical Materials Agency, the Army created at least 26 chemical weapons dump sites in the ocean off at least 11 states on both the west and east coasts. Due to poor records, they currently only know the rough whereabouts of half of them.\nThere is currently a lack of scientific data regarding the ecological and health effects of this dumping, but there have been a few incidents of chemical weapons washing ashore or being accidentally retrieved, for example during dredging or trawl fishing operations.\nDetection.\nDetection of gaseous nerve agents.\nThe methods of detecting gaseous nerve agents include but are not limited to the following.\nLaser photoacoustic spectroscopy.\nLaser photoacoustic spectroscopy (LPAS) is a method that has been used to detect nerve agents in the air. In this method, laser light is absorbed by gaseous matter. This causes a heating/cooling cycle and changes in pressure. Sensitive microphones convey sound waves that result from the pressure changes. Scientists at the U.S. Army Research Laboratory engineered an LPAS system that can detect multiple trace amounts of toxic gases in one air sample.\nThis technology contained three lasers modulated to different frequency, each producing a different sound wave tone. The different wavelengths of light were directed into a sensor referred to as the photoacoustic cell. Within the cell were the vapors of different nerve agents. The traces of each nerve agent had a signature effect on the \"loudness\" of the lasers' sound wave tones. Some overlap of nerve agents' effects did occur in the acoustic results. However, it was predicted that specificity would increase as additional lasers with unique wavelengths were added. Yet, too many lasers set to different wavelengths could result in overlap of absorption spectra. Citation LPAS technology can identify gases in parts per billion (ppb) concentrations.\nThe following nerve agent simulants have been identified with this multiwavelength LPAS:\nOther gases and air contaminants identified with LPAS include:\nNon-dispersive infrared.\nNon-dispersive infrared techniques have been reported to be used for gaseous nerve agent detection.\nIR absorption.\nTraditional IR absorption has been reported to detect gaseous nerve agents.\nFourier transform infrared spectroscopy.\nFourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy has been reported to detect gaseous nerve agents.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was broadcast on TV Tokyo and its affiliates from October 1995 to March 1996. The story, set in 2015, fifteen years after a worldwide cataclysm in the futuristic fortified city of Tokyo-3, follows Shinji Ikari, a teenage boy who is recruited by his father Gendo Ikari to the mysterious organization Nerv. Shinji is tasked to pilot an Evangelion, a giant biomechanical mecha, to fight and destroy beings known as Angels.\nThe series has been described as a deconstruction of the mecha genre; it delves into the experiences, emotions, and mental health of the Evangelion pilots and Nerv members as they are called upon to understand the ultimate cause of events and the motives behind human action. The series features archetypal imagery derived from Shinto cosmology and mystical Judeo-Christian religions and traditions, including Midrashic tales and Kabbalah. The psychoanalytic accounts of human behavior put forward by Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung are also prominently featured.\n\"Neon Genesis Evangelion\" received acclaim from critics and audiences and is regarded as one of the greatest animated series of all time. However, its final two episodes drew controversy, as many viewers found the ending confusing and abstract. In 1997, Gainax released an alternate ending in the feature film \"The End of Evangelion\", written and co-directed by Anno. A series of four films, \"Rebuild of Evangelion\", retelling the events of the series with different plot elements and a new ending, were released between 2007 and 2021. \"Evangelion\" has had a profound influence on the anime industry and influenced numerous future works. Film, manga, home video releases, and other products in the franchise have achieved record sales in Japanese markets and strong sales in overseas markets, with related goods earning over \u00a5 by 2007 and \"Evangelion\" pachinko machines generating \u00a5 by 2015.\nPlot.\nIn 2015, 15 years after a global cataclysm known as the Second Impact, teenager Shinji Ikari is summoned to the futuristic city of Tokyo-3 by his estranged father Gendo Ikari, who is the director of the special paramilitary organization Nerv. Shinji witnesses United Nations forces battling a giant creature named Sachiel, one of a race of monstrous beings known as Angels whose awakening was foretold in the Dead Sea Scrolls. Because of the Angels' near-impenetrable force fields known as Absolute Terror Fields, or simply AT Fields, Nerv's Evangelion bio-mechanical mechas, which are synchronized to their pilots' nervous systems and possess their own force fields, are the only weapons capable of combating and destroying the Angels. Nerv officer Misato Katsuragi escorts Shinji into the Nerv complex beneath Tokyo-3, where Gendo pressures him into piloting Evangelion Unit-01 to fight the Angel. Without training, Shinji is unable to destroy it and Unit-01 suffers cranial damage. Because of the nervous system synchronization, Shinji is overwhelmed by the pain and loses consciousness, causing the Evangelion to go berserk and savagely kill the Angel on its own.\nFollowing hospitalization, Shinji moves in with Misato and settles into life in Tokyo-3. In his second battle, Shinji defeats the Angel Shamshel but runs away afterward, distraught. Misato confronts Shinji, and he decides to remain a pilot. Shinji and Nerv's crew must defeat the remaining fourteen Angels to prevent the Third Impact, a global cataclysm that would destroy the world. Evangelion Unit-00 is repaired shortly afterward, and Shinji tries to befriend its pilot Rei Ayanami, a mysterious and socially isolated teenage girl. With Rei's help, Shinji defeats the Angel Ramiel. They are joined by Evangelion Unit-02's pilot, the multitalented, fiery-tempered teenager Asuka Langley Soryu, who is German-Japanese-American. The three of them manage to defeat several Angels, and as Shinji adjusts to his new role as a pilot, he gradually becomes more confident and self-assured. Asuka moves in with Shinji, and they develop a complicated relationship with each other, which includes confused romantic attraction and a kiss at Asuka's provocation.\nAfter being absorbed by the Angel Leliel, Shinji breaks free thanks to Eva-01 acting on its own. He is later forced to fight Evangelion Unit-03, who has become infected, and its pilot, his friend and classmate Toji Suzuhara, becomes incapacitated and permanently disabled. Asuka loses her self-confidence following a defeat and spirals into depression, which is worsened by her next fight against the Angel Arael who psychologically attacks her mind. It forces her to relive her worst fears and childhood trauma, resulting in a mental breakdown. In the next battle, Rei sacrifices herself to self-destruct Unit-00 and save Shinji. Misato and Shinji visit the hospital, where they find Rei alive, but claiming she is \"the third Rei\". Misato forces the scientist Ritsuko Akagi to reveal the dark secrets of Nerv, the Evangelion boneyard, and the Dummy Plug system, which operates using clones of Rei, who was created using the DNA of Shinji's mother, Yui Ikari. This succession of events leaves Shinji emotionally scarred and alienated from the rest of the characters. Kaworu Nagisa replaces the catatonic Asuka as Unit-02's pilot and befriends Shinji, gaining his trust. He is revealed to be the final foretold Angel, Tabris, and fights Shinji, realizing that he must die to allow humanity to survive. He asks Shinji to kill him, who hesitates but eventually kills Kaworu; an event that causes him to be overridden with guilt.\nAfter the final Angel is defeated, Gendo triggers the \"Human Instrumentality Project\", a forced evolution of humanity in which the souls of mankind are merged for benevolent purposes. He believes that if unified, humanity could overcome the loneliness and alienation that has eternally plagued them. Shinji's soul grapples with the reason for his existence and experiences an epiphany that he needs others to thrive and to accept himself by seeing a potential Shinji in another reality. This enables him to destroy the wall of negative emotions that torment him and unite with the others, who congratulate him.\nCharacters.\nIn the development of \"Evangelion\", Hideaki Anno attempted to create characters that reflected parts of his own personality. The characters of \"Evangelion\" struggle with interpersonal relationships, personal problems, and traumatic events in their past. The human qualities of the characters have enabled some viewers of the show to identify with the characters on a personal level, while others interpret them as historical, religious, or philosophical symbols.\nShinji Ikari is the series protagonist and the designated pilot of Evangelion Unit-01. After witnessing his mother Yui Ikari's death as a child, Shinji is abandoned by his father, Gendo Ikari. He is emotionally hypersensitive and sometimes does as expected out of fear of rejection, but he has often rebelled and refused to pilot the Eva because of the excruciating harm that has been done to him or to his friends. Throughout the series, he says to himself \"I mustn't run away\" as a means of encouraging himself to face the imminent threat, and this sometimes actually gives him bravery in battle; however, he has a lingering habit of withdrawing in response to traumatic events. Anno has described Shinji as a boy who \"shrinks from human contact\" and has \"convinced himself that he is a completely unnecessary person\".\nThe withdrawn and mysterious pilot of Evangelion Unit-00, Rei Ayanami, is a clone made from the salvaged remains of Yui and is plagued by a sense of negative self-worth stemming from the realization that she is an expendable asset. She at first despises Shinji for his lack of trust in his father Gendo, with whom Rei is very close. However, after Shinji and Rei successfully defeat the Angel Ramiel, she takes a friendly liking to him. Towards the end of the series, it is revealed that she is one of many clones, whose use is to replace the currently existing Rei if she is killed.\nAsuka Langley Soryu is a child prodigy who pilots Evangelion Unit-02 and possesses a fiery temper and an overabundance of pride and self-confidence, which often gets her in trouble and difficulty, especially during battles. As a little girl, Asuka discovered the body of her mother shortly after she committed suicide, leading the child to repress her emotions and vow never to cry. Asuka and Shinji develop intense but ambiguous feelings toward each other and have difficulty reaching out to others. Their relationship was initially modeled on the one between Jean, Nadia's love interest and eventual husband in the earlier anime series \"\". Similarly to Shinji, Asuka and Rei are presented with their own flaws and difficulty relating to other people.\nMisato Katsuragi is the caretaker and commanding officer for Shinji and Asuka. Her professional demeanor at Nerv contrasts dramatically with her carefree and irresponsible behavior at home. Character designer Yoshiyuki Sadamoto conceived her as an older \"girl next door\" and promiscuous loser who failed to take life seriously. Hideaki Anno described Shinji and Misato as \"afraid of being hurt\" and \"unsuitable\u2014lacking the positive attitude\u2014for what people call heroes of an adventure.\"\nThe teenage Evangelion pilots are ordered into battle by the steely Gendo Ikari, Shinji's father and the commander of Nerv. He abandoned Shinji and recalled him only to serve as an Evangelion pilot. Gendo salvaged the remains of his dead wife's body to create Rei, whom he viewed as a mere tool at his disposal to defeat the Angels and enact Instrumentality. Similar to Shinji, he is somewhat asocial and is afraid of being insulted by others and often runs away from such, often committing immoralities in the process. This fear is also what drove him to abandon Shinji. He is depicted as relentless in his drive to win, a man who \"takes drastic and extreme measures, by fair means or foul, or by hook or by crook, in order to accomplish his own purpose.\" According to character designer Yoshiyuki Sadamoto, the characters of Gendo and Fuyutsuki are based on Ed Straker and Alec Freeman of the television series \"UFO\". Sadamoto designed the visual appearance of the characters so that their personalities \"could be understood more or less at a glance\". The distinctive aesthetic appeal of the female lead characters' designs contributed to the high sales of \"Neon Genesis Evangelion\" merchandise. The design of Rei, in particular, became so popular that the media referred to the character as \"Premium Girl\" due to the high sales of books with Rei on the cover.\nProduction.\nDirector Hideaki Anno fell into a depression following the completion of work on ' and the 1992 failure of the ' sequel project, \"Uru in Blue\". According to Gainax co-founder and director Yasuhiro Takeda, after the failure of \"Uru in Blue\", Anno agreed to a collaboration between King Records and Gainax as he drank with King representative Toshimichi \u014ctsuki; King Records guaranteed Anno a time slot for \"something, anything\". Anno began the development of the new series in 1993 around the notion of not running away, the underlying theme of \"Uru in Blue\", focusing on a protagonist accustomed to avoiding personal responsibility who finds himself trying to save the heroine of the story. Early into the production, he stated his intent was to have \"Evangelion\" increase the number of anime fans, named otaku in Japanese, and attract interest in the anime medium, along with bringing a breath of fresh air to the mecha genre. In the early design phase of the \"Evangelion\" project, several formats were considered, including a film, a television series, and an original video animation (OVA) series. The producers finally opted for the television series, as it was the most widely accessible medium in Japan at that time. Anno also originally proposed the title \"Alcion\" for the new series, but this was rejected due to its lack of hard consonant sounds. He conceived the series as a metaphor of his four-year depression, as he tried to put his whole self and imprint his own feelings into the work.\nCritics noted how \"Evangelion\" borrowed certain scenarios and the use of introspection as a narrative device from a previous Anno project, the OVA series \"Gunbuster\". Anno also incorporated the narrative structure of \"Nadia\" and multiple frames of reference, leaving the story open to interpretation. The production was complex and saw several changes to the scenario initially conceived by Gainax. Anno initially suggested that the series featured a girl as the main protagonist, but the idea was rejected by character designer Yoshiyuki Sadamoto, who felt that a male lead would make it more believable for the mecha genre. In the first scenario, the first episode presented the battle between an Angel and Rei, while the character of Shinji was only introduced after the Angel had been temporarily defeated. Further changes to the plot were made following the Aum Shinrikyo sect's sarin gas attack on the Tokyo subway in March. Cultural critic Hiroki Azuma has said that the original \"Evangelion\" story was \"too close to reality\" from Anno's point of view. Anno thought that the original scenario was not suitable for broadcasting, and he feared censorship. However, he also criticized Aum Shinrikyo, because \"they lost any contact with reality\". For this reason, Azuma stated that \"Evangelion\" \"is an intrinsic critique of Aum\".\nThe final version of the story reflects inspiration drawn from numerous other anime and media. Chief among these are \"Space Battleship Yamato\", \"Mobile Suit Gundam\", \"Devilman\" and \"Space Runaway Ideon\". The series also incorporates tributes to \"Childhood's End\", the novels of Ry\u016b Murakami, \"The Andromeda Strain\", \"The Divine Invasion\", the poem \"Pippa Passes\", \"The Hitcher\", and several television series including \"The Prisoner\", \"Thunderbirds\", \"Ultraman\", and \"Ultraseven\".\nThe development of the \"Neon Genesis Evangelion\" series ran close to deadlines throughout its production run. The initial cuts of the first two episodes were screened at the second Gainax festival in July 1995, only three months before they were aired on television. By the thirteenth episode, \"Lilliputian Hitcher\", the series began to deviate significantly from the original story, and the initial project was abandoned. The number of Angels was reduced to seventeen from the original twenty-eight. The writers also changed the story's ending, originally describing the failure of the Human Instrumentality Project after an Angel attack from the Moon. Not only did the series suffer from scheduling issues, but according to Anno, despite Gainax being the lead studio for the series, the company itself had inadequate materials and staff for the full production of the series. Only three staff members from Gainax were working on the series at any given time, and most of the series' production was outsourced to Tatsunoko Production.\nStarting with the sixteenth episode, \"Splitting of the Breast\", the show undergoes a drastic change, discarding the grand narrative concerning salvation for an intricate exploration of the lead characters' psyches. This change coincided with Anno's development of an interest in psychology after a friend lent him a book on mental illness. This focus culminated in the two final episodes filmed from a completely introspective perspective. Necessity forced Anno to abandon the script of the twenty-fifth episode to work with a new one. These episodes feature heavy use of abstract animation, flashbacks, simple line drawings, photographs, and still image scenes with voice-over dialogue. Some critics speculated that these unconventional animation choices resulted from budget cuts, but Toshio Okada stated that it was not only a problem of schedule or budget, since Anno \"couldn't decide the ending until the time came. That's his style\". These two episodes sparked controversy and criticism among fans and critics of the series alike. In 1997, Hideaki Anno and Gainax thus released two animated feature films, providing another ending for the show, named \"\" and \"The End of Evangelion\", the latter being a more traditional, narrative-based ending.\nThemes.\nReferences to mystical traditions in Judaism and Christianity, including Midrashic literature and Kabbalah, are threaded liberally through the series. Complicating viewers' attempts to form an unambiguous interpretation, the series reworks Midrash stories, Zohar images and other Kabbalistic ideas developed from the Book of Genesis to create a new \"Evangelion\"-specific mythology. The plot also combines elements of esotericism and mysticism of the Jewish Kabbalah, including the Angels, which have common and individual features with the angels of the religious tradition, such as Sachiel, Sandalphon and Ramiel. Assistant director Kazuya Tsurumaki stated the religious visual references were intended to make the series more \"interesting\" and \"exotic\" for a Japanese audience, denying the existence of a religious meaning for the use of Christian visual symbols in the show. According to Anno, \"as the symbols are mixed together, for the first time something like an interrelationship or a meaning emerges\".\nAccording to writer Patrick Drazen, numerous allusions to the \"Kojiki\" and the \"Nihongi\" play a prominent role in \"Evangelion\", along with the Shinto vision of the primordial cosmos and the mythical lances of the Shinto deities Izanagi and Izanami. Elements of the Judeo-Christian tradition also feature prominently throughout the series, including references to Adam, Lilith, Eve, the Lance of Longinus, the Dead Sea Scrolls, the Kabbalistic concept of Adam Kadmon, and the Tree of Life. The merging of all human souls into one through the Human Instrumentality Project at the end of the series has been compared to the Kabbalistic concept of tikkun olam. The Evangelions have been likened to the golem of Jewish folklore, and their visual design resembles the traditional depictions of \"oni\", Japanese demons or ogres.\n\"Neon Genesis Evangelion\" has been interpreted as a deeply personal expression of Hideaki Anno's own emotional struggles with depression. During the production of the series, he became interested in mental illness and psychology. According to him, Rei is a schizophrenic character and a representation of Shinji's unconscious, while Shinji has an Oedipus complex and is characterized by a libido-destrudo conflict. Similarly, Ritsuko has an Electra complex, in which she loves Gendo, a sort of substitute for her father figure. Anno himself stated that he identifies with Shinji in both a conscious and unconscious manner, while Rei is Anno's \"deepest part\" and Kaworu his Jungian shadow. Shinji's entering into Unit-01 has been interpreted as a Freudian \"return to the womb\", and his struggle to be free of the Eva as his \"rite of passage\" into manhood. The series also contains references to philosophical and psychoanalytic concepts, such as the oral stage, introjection, oral personality, ambivalence, and the death drive, including elements of the works of Sigmund Freud, Arthur Schopenhauer, and S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard.\nRelated media.\nFilms.\nIn May 1996, Gainax announced an \"Evangelion\" film in response to fan dissatisfaction with the series finale. On March 15, 1997, Gainax released ', consisting of 60 minutes of clips taken from the first 24 episodes of the series and the first 30 minutes of the new ending due to production issues. The second film, \"The End of Evangelion\", which premiered on July 19, 1997, provided the complete new ending as a retelling of the final two episodes of the television series. Rather than depicting the series' climax within the characters' minds, the film provides a more conventional, action-based resolution to the series' plot lines. The film won numerous awards and grossed \u00a51.45\u00a0billion within six months of its release. Ex.org ranked the film in 1999 as the fifth best \"All-Time Show\", with the television series ranked second. In 2009, \"CUT\" magazine ranked it the third greatest anime film of all time. In July 1998, the films were re-released as ', which combined \"Death(true)\u00b2\" (the director's cut of \"Death\") with \"The End of Evangelion\".\nA new animated film series called \"Rebuild of Evangelion\" by Gainax was also made, consisting of four films. The first film retells the first six episodes from the series, but from the second film onward, the story changes, introducing new characters, Evas and Angels. The first film, ', was released in Japan on September 1, 2007, with ' released on June 27, 2009, and ' released on November 17, 2012. The final film, titled ', was released on March 8, 2021, after two delays. In 2015, \"Evangelion:Another Impact\", a 3D-rendered short film directed by Shinji Aramaki that served as a collaboration between the Khara studio and the media company Dwango, was released and streamed as the twelfth anime short from the Japan Animator Expo on February 8. It depicts \"the story of an Evangelion's activation, rampage and howling in another world\".\nManga and books.\nTen months prior to the television broadcast of \"Evangelion\", character designer Yoshiyuki Sadamoto illustrated a manga version of the story, initially a supplement meant to promote the anime series. The first installment of the manga was published in the February issue of \"Sh\u014dnen Ace\" in December 1994, with subsequent installments produced on an irregular basis over an eighteen-year period. The final installment was published in June 2013. Several publishers were initially concerned at the selection of Sadamoto to develop the manga adaptation, viewing him as \"too pass\u00e9 to be bankable\". The first ten volumes sold over 15\u00a0million copies, and the eleventh volume reached number one on the Tohan charts, selling an additional two million copies. The manga series won the 1996 \"Comicker\" fan manga poll. The story has been adapted into several other manga series in addition to the original Sadamoto project, including ', a mystery story that omits the Evangelion units, and ', a parody series which received its own original net animation serial show.\nMusic and soundtracks.\nShir\u014d Sagisu composed most of the original music for the series. The soundtracks released to high rankings on the Oricon charts, with \"Neon Genesis Evangelion III\" reaching the number one slot for highest sales in 1997; that same year, Sagisu received the Kobe Animation award for \"Best Music Score\" for his work on \"Evangelion\". Classical music by Ludwig van Beethoven, Johann Sebastian Bach, Giuseppe Verdi and George Frideric Handel is also featured throughout the series and the movies.\nAdditional classical works and original symphonic compositions were used to score later movies produced within the \"Neon Genesis Evangelion\" franchise. In total, the series' discography includes twenty-one full studio, live, compilation and soundtrack albums and six CD singles. The series' opening theme is \"A Cruel Angel's Thesis\", performed by Yoko Takahashi. It ranked on two TV Asahi polls, reaching the 55th spot for best anime theme songs of all time, and 18th for best anime theme songs of the 1990s. Fifteen years after its release, the theme won JASRAC's annual award for the royalties it continues to generate from its usage in pachinko, pachislo, karaoke and other venues. The ending theme of the series is \"Fly Me to the Moon\", sung by Claire Littley and various other singers from the main vocal cast.\nVideo games.\nSeveral video games based on the series have been developed, ranging from RPG and adventure games to mahjong and card games. The series has also spawned visual novels, two of which inspired the romance and comedy-focused manga series ' and '.\nReleases.\nJapan.\nThe original home video releases in Japan included VHS and LaserDisc sets using a release structured around \"Genesis 0:(volume number)\", with each of the first twelve releases containing two episodes each. Each of the episodes received minor changes and episodes from the twenty-first to the twenty-fourth were extended with new scenes. \"Genesis 0:13\" and \"Genesis 0:14\" contained the original and the alternate versions of the last two episodes first presented in \"\". A fifteenth and final release for LaserDisc, entitled \"Genesis 0:X\", contained the broadcast versions of the episodes from the twenty-first to the twenty-fourth and was a special mail-in offer for fans who purchased all fourteen discs.\nThe first Japanese DVD release was spread across seven volumes; all contained four episodes, with the seventh volume containing both the original and alternate versions of the last two episodes. This version was identical to the previous LaserDisc and VHS release. The movies were also released as a special set, just like before. In 2000 and 2001, three box sets were released to commemorate the fictional Second Impact, which occurred in the year 2000 in the series. The \"Second Impact Box\" contained the original episodes and both movies on nine DVDs \u2014 three per Box. The versions were the original broadcast and theatrical versions respectively and therefore differed from the previous DVD release. In addition, the video game \"Girlfriend of Steel\" was included in the third box set.\nThe Japanese-only, nine-volume \"Renewal of Evangelion\" DVDs were released on June 25, 2003, with improved acoustic effects, remixed dialogue and a remastered soundtrack for 5.1 stereo sound. The first eight volumes covered the original twenty-six episodes, including two versions of episodes from the twenty-first to the twenty-fourth: the extended video version that was available in previous releases, and a reconstruction of the shorter broadcast version, which was made available for the first time since the Genesis 0:X LaserDisc and also was not censored like in the original broadcast. The ninth volume contained \"Death(true)\u00b2\", while the tenth included \"End of Evangelion\" (omitting \"Rebirth\"). The \"Renewal Project\" release formed the basis for the Western \"Platinum Edition\". On December 1, 2014, Studio Khara announced a Blu-ray boxset containing a new HD-remastering of the television series, the video versions of the episodes from the twenty-first to the twenty-fourth, as well as the two movies, both as \"Revival of Evangelion\", the director's cut, which was available in the \"Renewal\" DVDs, and as their original theatrical versions \"Death and Rebirth\" and \"The End of Evangelion\".\nAnother DVD set, titled \"Archives of Evangelion\", was announced. It contains the original unaltered broadcast version of the television series as well as the broadcast version of \"Death (True) &amp; Rebirth\" that aired on January 2, 1998. Both sets were released on August 26, 2015, to commemorate the twentieth anniversary of the TV series. Following the bankruptcy and closure of Gainax between May and June 2024, Anno's current animation company, Studio Khara, officially gained the full copyright of the \"Evangelion\" franchise.\nADV Films.\nThe series was distributed in North America and Europe by ADV Films. The thirteen English VHS tapes, released from August 20, 1996, to July 7, 1998, contained two episodes each and were released using the same \"Genesis 0:(volume number)\" naming convention as the first Japanese home video release. Two LaserDisc collections were released as \"Collection 1 Deluxe Edition\" and \"Collection 2 Deluxe Edition\", containing episodes one to four and five to eight, respectively. The first DVD release by ADV Films was the eight-disk \"Perfect Collection\" in 2002, containing the original installments. In 2004, ADV released two DVD compilations titled \"Neon Genesis Evangelion: Resurrection\" and \"Neon Genesis Evangelion: Genesis Reborn\", encompassing the directors' cuts of episodes from the twenty-first to the twenty-fourth, and additionally including the original versions of episodes from the twenty-first to the twenty-sixth.\nThe \"Platinum Edition\" release was announced by ADV in 2004, consisting of seven DVDs released between July 27, 2004, and April 19, 2005. The \"Platinum Edition\" contained the original twenty-six episodes and the four \"Director's cut\" versions of episodes from the twenty-first to the twenty-fourth. A six-disc version of the Platinum Edition, the \"Platinum Complete Edition\", was released on November 22, 2005, and omitted several extras included in other versions, including commentary and trailers. A seven-disc \"Platinum Perfect Collection\" tin case version was released on November 27, 2007, and included the extras that were omitted from the \"Platinum Complete Edition\". On November 18, 2008, a seven-disc \"Holiday Edition\" DVD was released; this would be the final DVD release of the series from ADV Films. In late November 2011, it was announced the series was going out of print.\nMadman Anime.\nMadman has held the rights to the series since 1998 in New Zealand and Australia, where \"Evangelion\" was broadcast in 1999 by the Special Broadcasting Service. Madman Anime also holds the home video licenses for the \"Rebuild of Evangelion\" films.\nNetflix.\nOn November 26, 2018, streaming company Netflix announced that it had acquired the worldwide streaming rights to the original anime series, as well as \"Evangelion: Death (True)\u00b2\" and \"The End of Evangelion\", for release in Q2 2019. On March 22, 2019, Netflix announced a June 21, 2019, premiere date for the titles. Following the dissolution of ADV Films in late 2009, the Netflix release includes a re-translated script from Studio Khara's in-house translator Dan Kanemitsu and a new English-language cast chosen by Khara. The new dub received praise for the actors' performances, but the new script received some criticism for straightwashing the relationship between the characters Shinji and Kaworu. The Netflix release omits \"Fly Me to the Moon\" in regions outside of Japan due to licensing issues.\nAnime Limited and GKIDS.\nOn May 30, 2020, British anime distributor Anime Limited announced it had acquired home video distribution rights for the original series, \"Evangelion: Death (True)\u00b2\" and \"The End of Evangelion\" in the United Kingdom and Ireland, with an \"Ultimate Edition Blu-ray\" release scheduled for 2021, marking the international release of the original series on Blu-ray. On October 3, 2020, North American anime distributor GKIDS announced it had licensed the original TV series, \"Death (True)\u00b2\" and \"The End of Evangelion\" for home video, theatrical, and digital download release with an Ultimate Edition to be released in 2021, making this the first Blu-ray release of the franchise in North America. On August 30, 2021, GKIDS announced a Collector's Edition and a Standard edition release in addition to the Ultimate Edition. The Collector's/Ultimate edition had the \"Classic Dub and Subtitled Version\", including the ADV and Manga English dubs and subs, while the standard edition only included the Netflix English dub and sub. \"Fly Me to the Moon\" was not included in any of the GKIDS/All the Anime releases due to licensing issues. The Standard edition was released on November 9, 2021, while the Collector's/Ultimate edition was released on December 8, 2021. On November 2, 2021, GKIDS released the TV series, \"Death (True)\u00b2\" and \"The End of Evangelion\" on all major digital download services six days ahead of the Standard Blu-ray release. This release, like the Standard BD, only contains the Netflix dub and sub.\nReception.\n\"Neon Genesis Evangelion\" received widespread acclaim both domestically and internationally during its initial broadcast and in the decades since. On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the series has an approval rating of 100% based on 31 reviews, with an average rating of 8.3/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"\"Neon Genesis Evangelion\", both a cultural touchstone for Japan and an uncompromising auteurist vision by creator Hideaki Anno, doubles as an enthralling apex for the mecha anime genre and as a harrowing exploration of depression \u2013 making for a wholly singular epic about angels and inner demons.\" \"Paste\" and \"IGN\" named it as one of the best anime series of all time.\nThe \"richness\" of the characters and \"complex and layered\" narrative has received praise by critics. In 1998, Max Autohead of \"Hyper\" rated it 10 out of 10, praising the \"brilliant and fantastic storyline, with amazing characters who pull you not only into their world, but into their psyche as well\". The same year, Shidoshi of \"GameFan\" gave it an A rating, calling it an \"awesome\" series. Mike Hale of \"The New York Times\" described it in 2009 as \"a superior anime, a giant-robot tale of unusual depth, feeling and detail.\"\nFollowing the conclusion of the series' original television broadcast, the public and critical reception to \"Neon Genesis Evangelion\" was polarized, particularly with regard to the final two episodes. The experimental style of the finale confused or alienated many fans and spawned debate and controversy; the criticism was largely directed toward the lack of storyline resolution in the final two episodes. As such, opinion on the finale was deeply mixed, with the audience broadly divided between those who considered the episodes successfully introspective and those who felt their meaning was \"more apparent than real\". The English voice actors admitted that they also had trouble understanding the series' conclusion. The \"Mainichi Times\" wrote that after the broadcast of the penultimate episode, \"nearly all viewers felt betrayed\u00a0... When commentator Eiji \u014ctsuka sent a letter to the \"Yomiuri Shimbun\", complaining about the end of the \"Evangelion\" series, the debate went nationwide.\" Despite the criticism, Anno stood by his artistic choices for the series' conclusion. Critic Zac Bertschy remarked in 2003 that \"Most of the backlash against \"Evangelion\" existed because people don't like to think\". The initial controversy surrounding the end of \"Evangelion\" has had no lasting negative influence on the popularity of the series.\n\"Evangelion\" has developed into a social phenomenon beyond its primary fan base, generating national discussion in Japan. The series has also been the subject of numerous media reports, debates, and research studies worldwide. The show has received review by critics, academics and sociologists alike, including by Susan J. Napier, William Rout, Mick Broderick, Mari Kotani, Shinji Miyadai, Hiroki Azuma, Yuriko Furuhata, and Marc Steinberg. The series has been described as both a critique and deconstruction of the mecha genre. Japanese critic Manabu Tsuribe considered that \"Evangelion\" was \"extremely interior and is lacking in sociality, so that it seems to reflect pathology of the times.\" \"Anime News Network\"'s Theron Martin described the character design as \"distinctive, designed to be sexy rather than cutesy\", and the mecha designs as \"among the most distinctive ever produced for an anime series, with sleek, lithe appearances that look monstrous, fearsome, and nimble rather than boxy and knight-like\". Mike Crandol stated, \"It no longer seems contrite to say that \"Evangelion\" is surely one of the all-time great works of animation\". In February 2004, \"Cinefantastique\" listed the anime as one of the \"10 Essential Animations\".\nAwards.\n\"Neon Genesis Evangelion\" has scored highly in popularity polls. In 1996, the series won first place in the \"Best Loved Series\" category of the Anime Grand Prix, a reader-polled award series published in \"Animage\" magazine. The show was again awarded this prize in 1997 by a large margin. The \"End of Evangelion\" won first place in 1998, making \"Neon Genesis Evangelion\" the first anime franchise to win three consecutive first place awards. The website \"IGN\" ranked \"Evangelion\" as the tenth best animated series in its \"Top 100 Animated TV Series\" list. The series also placed third in \"Animage\"'s \"anime that should be remembered in the 21st Century\" list. In 1998, EX.org's readers voted \"Neon Genesis Evangelion\" the best US anime release and in 1999, the second-best show of all time. In 2007, a large-scale survey poll by TV Asahi voted \"Evangelion\" as the second most appreciated anime in Japan. The series was also ranked as the most popular of all time in a 2006 survey of 80,000 attendees at the Japan Media Arts Festival.\n\"Evangelion\" won the Animation Kobe award in 1996, and 1997. The series was also awarded the eighteenth Nihon SF Taisho Award and the Excellence Award at the first Japan Media Arts Festival in 1997, while \"The End of Evangelion\" ranked sixth on \"Wizard's Anime\" Magazine's list of the \"Top 50 Anime released in North America\". In the August 1996 issue of \"Animage\", \"Evangelion\" characters placed high in the rankings of best characters with Rei Ayanami ranked first, Asuka Langley Soryu third, Kaworu Nagisa, fourth and Shinji Ikari sixth. Rei won in the Female Character category in 1995 and 1996 and Shinji Ikari won the Male Character category in 1996 and 1997. In 2010, \"Newtype\" magazine recognized Rei as the most popular character of the 1990s in the female category, and Shinji in the male category. \"A Cruel Angel's Thesis\" won the Animage award in the Best Song category in 1996, and TV Asahi recognized it as the eighteenth best anime song since 1990. \"TV Asahi\" also recognized the \"suicide of Ayanami Rei\" as the ninth most touching anime scene ever.\nInfluence and legacy.\n\"Evangelion\" has had a profound and lasting impact on the anime industry and Japanese popular culture. The series, airing at a time when the anime industry and its televised series were in a slump period, is credited with revitalizing the industry and raising the standard for high-quality Japanese animation. CNET reviewer Tim Hornyak credits the series with revitalizing and transforming the giant mecha genre. In the 1980s and 1990s, Japanese animation saw decreased production following the economic crash in Japan. This was followed by a crisis of ideas in the years to come. Against this backdrop, \"Evangelion\" imposed new standards for the animated series, ushering in the era of the \"new Japanese animation serial\", characterized by innovations that allowed a technical and artistic revival of the industry. The production of anime serials began to reflect greater artistic control, the concentration of resources in fewer but higher quality episodes, typically ranging from thirteen to twenty-six, a directorial approach similar to live film, and greater freedom from the constraints of merchandising.\nAccording to TV Tokyo's Keisuke Iwata, the global spread of Japanese animation expanded dramatically due to the popularity of \"Evangelion\". In Japan, \"Evangelion\" prompted a review of the cultural value of anime, and its success, according to Roland Kelts, made the medium more accessible to the international youth scene. With the interest in the series, otaku culture became a mass social phenomenon. The show's regular reruns increased the number of otaku, while John Lynden links its popularity to a boom in interest in literature on the Dead Sea Scrolls, Kabbalah and Christianity.\nCritics have noted \"Evangelion\"'s influence on subsequent anime series, such as \"Serial Experiments Lain\", \"RahXephon\", \"Texhnolyze\", \"Gasaraki\", \n\"Guilty Crown\", \"Boogiepop Phantom\", \"Blue Submarine No. 6\", \"Martian Successor Nadesico\", ', \"Gurren Lagann\", \"Dual! Parallel Trouble Adventure\", \"Argento Soma\", \"Pilot Candidate\", \"Generator Gawl\", and \"Dai-Guard\". References, homages and tributes to the series are also featured in Japanese and Western media such as \"Magical Shopping Arcade Abenobashi\", \"Koi Koi Seven\", \"Hayate the Combat Butler\", \"Baka and Test\", \"Regular Show\", ', \"Gravity Falls\", \"Sgt. Frog\", \"Rick and Morty\", \"One Hour Photo\", \"Steven Universe\", ', and \"Nope\". The show's mixture of religion and mecha also influenced Japanese video games, including \"Xenogears\" and '.\nThe design and personality traits of the character Rei Ayanami were emulated for many anime and manga characters of the late 1990s, such as Ruri Hoshino (\"Nadesico\"), Ruriko Tsukushima (\"Droplet\"), Miharu (\"Gasaraki\"), Anthy Himemiya (\"Revolutionary Girl Utena\"), and Lain Iwakura (\"Serial Experiments Lain\"). The character of Asuka was parodied by Excel (\"Excel Saga\"), and some of her traits were used to create the character of Mai in \"Gunparade March\". According to Italian critic Guido Tavassi, \"Evangelion\"'s mecha design, characterized by a greater resemblance to the human figure, and the abstract designs of the Angels, also had a significant impact on the designs of future anime productions. Nobuhiro Watsuki designed several characters in \"Rurouni Kenshin\" based on characters from \"Neon Genesis Evangelion\", namely Uonuma Usui, Honj\u014d Kamatari and Fuji. Other artists have cited the series as an inspiration, including film director Makoto Shinkai and manga artist Gege Akutami on the \"Jujutsu Kaisen\" manga series. In the aftermath of \"Evangelion\", Anno reused stylistic conceits from the series in the live-action film \"Love &amp; Pop\" and the anime romance series \"Kare Kano\". \"Neon Genesis Evangelion\" also influenced music artists, such as the British band Fightstar and its debut album, \"Grand Unification\", and the Japanese band Rey, which derived its name from Rei Ayanami.\nMerchandising.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIn Japan, \"Evangelion\" is an enormous content and merchandise industry with hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue. Images of its biomechanical Eva robots are on everything from coffee mugs to smartphones and even airplane wraps.\n\u2014 Tim Hornyak, \"CNET\" (July 16, 2013)\nThe popularity of \"Neon Genesis Evangelion\" extends to its merchandising, which exceeded $400\u00a0million within two years of its release. The series has established itself greatly on the Japanese market, developing a varied range of products for consumers of various age groups, such as cell phones, laptops, soundtracks, DVDs, action figures, telephone cards and an official set of Japanese coins. However, its stylized mecha designs were initially criticized by certain toy companies as being too difficult to manufacture, with some expressing concern that models of the Evangelions \"would never sell.\" Eventually, Sega agreed to license all toy and video game sales. At the time of the release of the films \"Death &amp; Rebirth\" and \"The End of Evangelion\", estimated sales of \"Evangelion\" merchandise topped $300\u00a0million, of which 70% derived from sales of video and laser discs, soundtrack and single CDs, computer software and the three-volume manga.\nThe commercial exploitation of the series for the home video market achieved record sales and remained strong over a decade later. The fame of the show has grown through home video sales, which exceeded two or three times the sales of other contemporary anime series and films. According to anime critic Guido Tavassi, the series contributed significantly to the spread of the DVD format in Japan and had a considerable impact on the Japanese economy, calculated in billions of yen. In 2006, Matt Greenfield stated that the franchise had earned over $. A 2007 estimate placed total sales of 6,000 related goods at over \u00a5. By 2015, more than two million \"Evangelion\" pachinko and pachislot machines had been sold, generating \u00a5 in revenue.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Located on the Waal River close to the German border, Nijmegen is one of the oldest cities in the Netherlands and the first to be recognized as such in Roman times. In 2005, it celebrated 2,000 years of existence.\nNijmegen became a free imperial city in 1230 and a Hanseatic city in 1402. Since 1923 it has been a university city with the opening of a Catholic institution now known as the Radboud University Nijmegen. The city is well known for the annual Vierdaagse \u2014 the International Four Days Marches Nijmegen event.\nIts population as of 2024 was 187,011.\nPopulation centres.\nThe municipality is formed by the city of Nijmegen, incorporating the former villages of Hatert, Hees and Neerbosch, as well as the urban expansion projects in Veur-Lent, Nijmegen-Oosterhout and Nijmegen\u2013Ressen, all situated north of the river Waal.\nProximity of border with Germany.\nThe city lies a few kilometers from the border with Germany, and to some extent the westernmost villages in the municipality of Kranenburg, Germany, function as dormitories for people who work in the Dutch city of Nijmegen in part due to the immigration of Dutch people from the region who were attracted by the lower house pricing just across the border.\nThe German city of Duisburg (in the Ruhr region) is about away, while the German town of Kleve (in the Lower Rhine region) is about away.\nHistory.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAntiquity.\nThe first mention of Nijmegen in history is in the first century BCE, when the Romans built a military camp on the place where Nijmegen was to appear; the location had great strategic value because of the surrounding hills, which give a good view over the river Waal and Rhine valley.\nBy 69, when the Batavi, the original inhabitants of the Rhine and Meuse (\"Maas\") delta, revolted, a village called \"Oppidum Batavorum\" had formed near the Roman camp. This village was destroyed in the revolt, but when it had ended the Romans built another, bigger camp where the Legio X \"Gemina\" was stationed. Soon after, another village formed around this camp.\nIn 98, Nijmegen was the first of two settlements in what is now the Kingdom of the Netherlands to receive Roman city rights.\nIn 103, the X \"Gemina\" was restationed in Vindobona, now Vienna, which may have been a major blow to the economy of the village around the camp, losing around 5000 inhabitants. In 104 Emperor Trajan renamed the town, which became known as \"Ulpia Noviomagus Batavorum\", Noviomagus for short, the ultimate origin of the current name.\nA collection of artifacts from Roman antiquity were compiled by Johannes Smetius in the 17th century, called the Smetius Collection.\nIn January 2022, archeologists led by Pepijn van de Geer announced the discovery of an intact 2,000-year-old blue glass bowl with a vertical stripe pattern in Nijmegen. Researchers assume that this well-preserved bowl was made in a glass workshop. According to van de Geer, this type of bowl was made by allowing molten glass to cool and harden over a mold.\nMiddle Ages.\nBeginning in the latter half of the 4th century, Roman power decreased and Noviomagus eventually became part of Francia. It also appeared around this time on the . In the 8th century Emperor Charlemagne maintained his \"palatium\" in Nijmegen in 777, and possibly on at least three more occasions. During his brief deposition of 830, the emperor Louis the Pious was sent to Nijmegen by his son, Lothair I. Thanks to the Waal, trade flourished.\nHenry VI, Holy Roman Emperor, was born at Nijmegen in 1165. In 1230 his son Frederick II granted Nijmegen city rights. In 1247, the city was ceded to the count of Guelders as collateral for a loan. The loan was never repaid, and Nijmegen has been a part of Gelderland ever since. This did not hamper trade; Nijmegen even became part of the Hanseatic League in 1364.\nThe arts also flourished in this period. Famous medieval painters like the Limbourg brothers were born and educated in Nijmegen. Some of Hieronymus Bosch's ancestors also came from the city.\nEarly modern period.\nDuring the Dutch Revolt, trade came to a halt and even though Nijmegen became a part of the Republic of United Provinces after its capture from the Spanish in 1591, it remained a border town and had to endure multiple sieges. \nIn 1678 Nijmegen was host to the negotiations between the European powers that aimed to put an end to the constant warfare that had ravaged the continent for years. The result was the Treaty of Nijmegen that failed to provide for a lasting peace.\nIn 1702, at the start of the War of the Spanish Succession, the French nearly took Nijmegen by surprise. Only because of the intervention of an Anglo-Dutch army under the Earl of Athlone and the bravery of the citizens of Nijmegen was the Assault on Nijmegen repulsed.\nIn the second half of the 19th century, the fortifications around the city became a major problem. There were too many inhabitants inside the walls, but the fortifications could not be demolished because Nijmegen was deemed as being of vital importance to the defence of the Netherlands. When events in the Franco-Prussian War proved that old-fashioned fortifications were no longer of use, this policy was changed and the fortifications were dismantled in 1874. The old castle had already been demolished in 1797, so that its bricks could be sold.\nThrough the second half of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century, Nijmegen grew steadily. In 1923 the current Radboud University Nijmegen was founded and in 1927 a channel was dug between the Waal and Meuse (\"Maas\") rivers.\nThe Waal was bridged in 1878 by a rail bridge and in 1936 by a road bridge, which was claimed to be Europe's biggest bridge at the time. In November 2013 a second road bridge (), 2\u00a0km downstream, was opened to ease congestion.\nWorld War II.\nIn 1940, the Netherlands was invaded by Germany, with Nijmegen being the first Dutch city to fall into German hands. On 22 February 1944, Nijmegen was heavily bombed by American planes, causing great damage to the city centre. It was subsequently claimed by the Allies that the American pilots thought they were bombing the German city of Kleve, while the Germans alleged that it was a planned operation authorised by the Dutch government in exile. The Dutch organization for investigating wartime atrocities, the NIOD, announced in January 2005 that its study of the incident confirmed that it was an accident caused by poor communications and chaos in the airspace. Over 750 people died in the bombardment.\nDuring September 1944, the city saw heavy fighting during Operation Market Garden. The objective of the Battle of Nijmegen was mainly to prevent the Germans from destroying the bridges. Capturing the road bridge allowed the British Army XXX Corps to attempt to reach the 1st British Airborne Division in Arnhem. The bridge was heavily defended by over 300 German troops on both the north and south sides with close to 20 anti-tank guns and two anti-aircraft guns, supported with artillery. The Germans' late attempt to blow the road bridge was possibly foiled by a local Dutch resistance hero, Jan van Hoof, who is said to have cut the wires to the bridge. The Germans made repeated attacks on the bridge using bombs attached to driftwood, midget submarines and later resorted to shelling the bridge with 88mm barrages. Troops were positioned on the bridge giving an excellent arc of fire in case of attack. Troops that could not fit onto the bridge were positioned in a bombed-out house slightly upstream of the bridge. During the shelling, the house was hit, killing six soldiers and wounding one. Nijmegen was liberated from German occupation by the British Grenadier Guards of the Guards Armoured Division, as well as elements of the American 82nd Airborne Division in September 1944. The city was later used as a springboard for Operation Veritable, the invasion across the Rhine River by Allied Troops.\nPost-war period.\nFrom 1946 to 1948 Mari\u00ebnbosch concentration camp, near Nijmegen, was used to house German nationals who were to be deported from the Netherlands.\nOn 23 February 1981, the Nijmegen police department and the Dutch Army stormed the Piersonstraat and Zeigelhof, a squatted housing block in the city centre of Nijmegen. Using 200 riot vans, three Leopard 1s, three armoured personnel carriers, a helicopter, 1,200 policemen, and 750 members of the armed forces, they evicted the squatters and demolished the block, while clouding the entire area in teargas and CS gas. This received enormous backlash in local politics. While the city government wanted the squatters out to build a parking garage, most of the population wanted affordable housing to be built in the area.\nThe city council was largely dominated by left-wing and progressive parties such as the Green Party, Democrats 66, Socialist Party, and Labour. At times Nijmegen has been the only major city in the Netherlands with a solely left-wing government, and received the nickname 'Havana on the Waal'.\nNijmegen celebrated its 2000th year of existence in 2005.\nIn November 2005, the city centre of Nijmegen was the site of the assassination of political activist Louis S\u00e9v\u00e8ke by a former activist, Marcel Teunissen, who was arrested in 2007 in Spain and extradited to the Netherlands. Teunissen has also been accused of bank robbery. He committed his acts out of revenge for a forcible eviction from the squatter scene by Louis S\u00e9v\u00e8ke.\nGeography.\nClimate.\nNijmegen has an oceanic climate (\"Cfb\"). It is one of the warmest cities of the Netherlands, especially during summer, when the highest temperatures in the country are usually measured in the triangle Roermond\u2013Nijmegen\u2013Eindhoven. The lack of north\u2013south oriented mountain ranges in Europe make this area prone to sudden shifts in weather, giving the region a semi-continental climate.\nSome of the northernmost wineries in the world are found just outside Nijmegen, around Groesbeek, a suburban village south-east of Nijmegen.\nDuring the 2006 European heat wave, closest official weather station Volkel reached a high of on 19 July. The heat wave coincided with that year's Four Day Marches, which were cancelled after the first day, when two people died of hyperthermia-related causes. Temperatures on that day, 18 July, reached around in the city.\nHistorical remains.\nFew Roman remains are visible today; a fragment of the old city wall can be seen near the casino and the foundations of the amphitheatre are traced in the paving of the present-day Rembrandtstraat. The Valkhof Museum, on the Valkhof, has a permanent display of the history of Nijmegen, including artifacts from the Roman era. Additionally, they usually have temporary exhibitions of more and less famous artists. During building works in the Waalsprong area, ruins from before the Roman times were found which were identified in 2022 as those of a sauna. This 3,600 year-old sauna is the first of its kind in mainland Europe.\nNot many very old buildings are left in town: first the Americans bombed it in February 1944, later the Germans shelled it for about five months after the liberation in September 1944, and finally there were a number of vigorous city planners in the 1950s, 60s and 70s who finished the demolition. There are still a few noteworthy sights, however. Valkhof hill downtown features a Carolingian chapel (eighth, ninth century AD) and a small remainder of an imperial castle that was demolished in 1798. The 750-year old Stevenskerk had to be reconstructed after WWII.\nDemographics.\nAs of 2023, Nijmegen has a total population of about 182,465.\nPolitics.\nThe city is governed by a council of 39 councillors, elected every four years.\nAfter the 2022 municipal elections, the three largest parties, GroenLinks (9 seats), Stadspartij Nijmegen (7 seats) and the D66 (6 seats) formed a coalition. Since 2012 the mayor has been Hubert Bruls of the Christian Democratic Appeal party (CDA), the city council approving a third six-year term from 2024.\nIn addition to the city council, since 1988 Nijmegen has been part of a regional body. Since 2021 this has been the Arnhem-Nijmegen Green Metropolitan Region (), which aids co-operation in planning and development in the region's eighteen municipalities.\nTwin and sister cities.\nNijmegen is twinned with:\nCulture.\nEvents.\nFour Days Marches.\nNijmegen has hosted since 1925 the annual Four Days Marches (Vierdaagse), as a means of promoting sport and exercise. Beginning on the third Tuesday of each July, over 40,000 participants from about 70 countries undertake four days of walking with distances ranging from a day. The marches are supplemented with festivities such as the \"Vierdaagse Festival\".\nReligion.\nIn 1968, theologians in the Catholic Church issued what is now known as the Nijmegen Statement, demanding sweeping reforms in the Vatican's Holy Office, previously known as The Inquisition, and calling for greater scope for theological inquiry. Among its signatories was theologian Fr. Joseph Ratzinger, then a member of the faculty at the University of T\u00fcbingen, but later the head of the successor to the Holy Office, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, and later still Pope Benedict XVI.\nThe Nijmegen Statement said: \"Any form of Inquisition however subtle, not only harms the development of sound theology, it also causes irreparable damage to the credibility of the church\". The signatories, a group of predominantly German-speaking theologians asserted that \"the freedom of theologians, and theology in the service of the church, regained by Vatican II, must not be jeopardised again.\" The signatories pledged their loyalty to the Pope, but argued that the teaching office of pope and bishops \"cannot and must not supersede, hamper and impede the teaching task of theologians as scholars.\"\nSport.\nSport in the city is principally focused on its football club NEC Nijmegen or just NEC, short for Nijmegen Eendracht Combinatie, which plays at the 12,500-seat Stadion de Goffert. The club plays in the Eredivisie.\nBandy Vereniging Nijmegen is the biggest bandy club in the country. The national team got celebrated by over a hundred fans and Mayor Hubert Bruls after winning Division B of the 2018 Bandy World Championship.\nThe city is also home to one of the country's oldest cricket clubs, Quick 1888, a current member of the KNCB. Formed in 1888, it is the largest cricket club in the east of the country and was formed 13 years after the first club, Utile Dulci from Deventer. The cricket club has two men's teams. The city also has the Nijmegen Devils, an Ice hockey club. Nijmegen also plays host to the annual Zevenheuvelenloop (\"Seven Hills Run\"), an annual run recognised by the IAAF as a Bronze Label race.\nEconomy and infrastructure.\nEconomy.\nThe three main employers in Nijmegen are:\n1. Radboud University;\n2. The three hospitals in the city: Radboud University Medical Center, , and (CWZ);\n3. The semiconductor industry. Nexperia and Ampleon (both spun off from NXP Semiconductors) are headquartered in the city. Multinational companies such as Qualcomm, Photronics Inc, and Applied Materials also have facilities in Nijmegen.\nOther notable companies headquartered in Nijmegen include Synthon, a Dutch multinational pharmaceutical company and Vaxxinova, an subsidiary which produces animal vaccines.\nMore room for the river Waal.\nTo prevent flooding in the near future, the Dutch government is changing the course of more than 30 rivers throughout the country. These measures, taken along the rivers IJssel, Lek, Maas and Waal, are known as \u2018Room for the River\u2019. Room for the river Waal as it passes Nijmegen is one of these measures. As part of this, the artificial island Veur-Lent was created in 2015.\nThe river Waal not only has a sharp bend near Nijmegen, it also forms a bottleneck. In 1993 and 1995, this led to high water and floods. To prevent this from happening again, and to protect inhabitants of the city and its surroundings against the water, work has been done to relocate the Waal dike in Lent and to excavate a large ancillary channel in the flood plains, creating an island in the Waal opposite Nijmegen. The large-scale project involved the construction of three bridges, new dikes and concrete water barriers. The island contains an urban river park with possibilities for recreation, culture, water and nature.\nTransport.\nNijmegen has five railway stations: Nijmegen, Nijmegen Dukenburg, Nijmegen Heyendaal, Nijmegen Lent and Nijmegen Goffert. The central station is connected to the national Intercity network. The bus company Breng operates the city buses in the Arnhem-Nijmegen metropolitan area.\nLike most Dutch cities, bicycles are an important mode of transport. The city is connected to Arnhem, to the north, by a \"fietssnelweg\" (fast cycle highway) which crosses the Snelbinder bridge in the city. During 2010\u20132012 the cycle highway received upgrades to further encourage the use of bicycles for transport between Nijmegen and Arnhem. In May 2016, the Dutch Fietsersbond (Cyclists' Union) awarded the 2016 Fietsstad (Cycling City) award to the city of Nijmegen.\nKeizer Karelplein (English \"The Plaza of Emperor Charlemagne\"), a roundabout in the center of the city with seven busy connecting or almost connecting roads, is one of the most accident-prone roads in the Netherlands, and Nijmegen has an extensive, overcrowded road network that splits up the city in separate parts instead of having the busy roads out-of-center away from densely populated areas as is the norm in the rest of the country. The roundabout surrounds a park which is not used because it would be life-threatening to attempt to cross the road of the roundabout to get to and from the park. There is also a Keizer Karelplein in Maastricht.\nThe river is a busy freight transport route, with barges passing through on the way between the industrial regions of Germany and the docks at Amsterdam, Rotterdam and Hook of Holland. The Maas\u2013Waal Canal also carries freight through the city.\nEducation.\nNijmegen is host to Radboud University Nijmegen. Founded in 1923 as the first Catholic university in the Netherlands, it used to be called \"Catholic University of Nijmegen\" until 2004, when it took its current name. As of October\u00a02018[ [update]], it had 22,142 students and 4,921 staff. Radboud University runs the High Field Magnetic Laboratory which is able to achieve some of the highest fields available in Europe at 38 teslas (continuous). The facility is available to outside users, primarily for research purposes.\nNijmegen is also home to HAN University of Applied Sciences, one of the largest universities of applied sciences in the Netherlands. Founded in 1996 through the merger of several institutions, HAN has over 35,000 students and 4,000 staff members. It offers a wide range of bachelor's and master's programs, with a strong focus on applied research and professional development. The university has campuses in both Nijmegen and Arnhem, with its education, medical, and health-related programs, based in Nijmegen.\nIn addition to these institutions, there is also an intermediate-level vocational school and a number of secondary schools: Groenschool Nijmegen, Kandinsky College, Nijmeegse Scholengemeenschap Groenewoud (NSG), Citadel College, Stedelijke Scholengemeenschap Nijmegen (SSGN), Canisius College, St. Jorisschool, Mondial College, the Stedelijk Gymnasium Nijmegen (formerly the \"Latijnse school\", founded in the 16th century), the Karel de Grote College, Montessori College and the Dominicus College. Of note is also Leefwerkschool Eigenwijs, which caters to students from all over the Netherlands who have been repeatedly expelled from \"regular\" high schools. Leefwerkschool Eigenwijs has its roots in the local activist movement of the early 1980s and is the only school of its kind recognised in the Netherlands.\nNijmegen is also an important centre of Psycholinguistics, home to the Max Planck Institute of Psycholinguistics and the F.C. Donders Centre for Cognitive Neuroimaging.\nThe Nobel Prize for Physics in 2010 was awarded to Andre Geim and Konstantin Novoselov who had begun their exploration of the special properties of the material Graphene at Radboud University's High Magnetic Field Laboratory. Geim was at Radboud from 1994 to 2000 before moving to Manchester University. Novoselov completed his PhD at Radboud in 2004 and joined Geim at Manchester to continue the \"groundbreaking experiments regarding the two-dimensional material graphene\" that resulted in the Nobel Prize. Both went on to hold associate professorships within Radboud's Department of Theory of Condensed Matter.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nLiterature"}
{"id": "21714", "revid": "163732", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21714", "title": "North Africa", "text": "Northernmost region of Africa\nNorth Africa is a region encompassing the northern portion of the African continent. There is no singularly accepted scope for the region. However, it is sometimes defined as stretching from the Atlantic shores of the Western Sahara in the west, to Egypt and Sudan's Red Sea coast in the east.\nThe most common definition for the region's boundaries includes Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Morocco, Tunisia, and Western Sahara, the territory disputed between Morocco and the partially recognized Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic. The United Nations\u2019 definition includes all these countries as well as Sudan. The African Union defines the region similarly, only differing from the UN in excluding the Sudan and including Mauritania. The Sahel, south of the Sahara Desert, can be considered as the southern boundary of North Africa. North Africa includes the Spanish cities of Ceuta and Melilla, and the plazas de soberan\u00eda. It can also be considered to include Malta, as well as other Italian, Portuguese, and Spanish regions such as Lampedusa and Lampione, Madeira, and the Canary Islands, which are all either closer to the African continent than Europe or as close to the African continent as Europe.\nNorthwest Africa has been inhabited by Berbers since the beginning of recorded history, while the eastern part of North Africa has been home to the Ancient Egyptians and Nubians. In the seventh and eighth centuries, Arabs from the Arabian Peninsula swept across the region during the early Muslim conquests. The Arab migrations to the Maghreb began immediately after, which started a long process of Islamization and Arabization that has altered the demographic breakdown of the region and defined the cultural landscape of North Africa ever since. Many, but not all Berbers and Copts gradually merged into Arab-Islamic culture, and today, the Arabs constitute the majority of the population in all North African countries.\nThe countries and people of North Africa share a large amount of their genetic, ethnic, cultural and linguistic identity and influence with the Middle East/West Asia, a process that began with the Neolithic Revolution c.\u200910,000 BC and pre-dynastic Egypt. The countries of North Africa are also a major part of the Arab world. The Islamic and Arab influence in North Africa has remained dominant ever since, with the region being integral in the Muslim world. North Africa is associated with the Middle East in the realm of geopolitics to form the Middle East-North Africa region.\nHistory.\nPrehistory.\nDue to the recent African origin of modern humans, the history of Prehistoric North Africa is important to the understanding of pre-hominid and early modern human history in Africa.\nSome researchers have postulated that North Africa rather than East Africa served as the exit point for the modern humans who first trekked out of the continent in the Out of Africa migration.\nThe earliest inhabitants of central North Africa have left behind significant remains: early remnants of hominid occupation in North Africa, for example, were found in Ain-Hnech in Setif dating back 2.6 million years, near Sa\u00efda (c.\u2009200,000 BCE); in fact, more recent investigations have found signs of Oldowan technology there, and indicate a date of up to 1.8 million BCE.\nRecent finds in Jebel Irhoud in Morocco have been found to contain some of the oldest \"Homo sapiens\" remains; This suggests that, rather than arising only in East Africa around 200,000 years ago, early \"Homo sapiens\" may already have been present across the length of Africa 100,000 years earlier. According to study author Jean-Jacques Hublin, \"The idea is that early \"Homo sapiens\" dispersed around the continent and elements of human modernity appeared in different places, and so different parts of Africa contributed to the emergence of what we call modern humans today.\" Early humans may have comprised a large, interbreeding population dispersed across Africa whose spread was facilitated by a wetter climate that created a \"green Sahara\", around 330,000 to 300,000 years ago. The rise of modern humans may thus have taken place on a continental scale rather than being confined to a particular corner of Africa. \nIn September 2019, scientists reported the computerized determination, based on 260 CT scans, of a virtual skull shape of the last common human ancestor to modern humans/\"H. sapiens\", representative of the earliest modern humans, and suggested that modern humans arose between 260,000 and 350,000 years ago through a merging of populations in East and Southern Africa.\nThe cave paintings found at Tassili n'Ajjer, north of Tamanrasset, Algeria, and at other locations depict vibrant and vivid scenes of everyday life in central North Africa during the Neolithic Subpluvial period (about 8000 to 4000 BCE). Some parts of North Africa began to participate in the Neolithic revolution in the 6th millennium BCE, just before the rapid desertification of the Sahara around 3500 B.C. largely due to a tilt in the Earth's orbit. It was during this period that domesticated plants and animals were introduced in the region, spreading from the north and east to the southwest. There has been an inferred connection between areas of rapid drying and the introduction of livestock in which the natural (orbital) aridification was amplified by the spread of shrubs and open land due to grazing. Nevertheless, changes in northern Africa's ecology after 3500 BCE provided the backdrop for the formation of dynastic civilizations and the construction of monumental architecture such as the Pyramids of Giza.\nArchaeological evidence has attested that population settlements occurred in Nubia as early as the Late Pleistocene era and from the 5th millennium BC onwards, whereas there is \"no or scanty evidence\" of human presence in the Egyptian Nile Valley during these periods, which may be due to problems in site preservation. Several scholars have argued that the African origins of the Egyptian civilisation derived from pastoral communities which emerged in both the Egyptian and Sudanese regions of the Nile Valley in the fifth millennium BCE.\nWhen Egypt entered the Bronze Age, the Maghreb remained focused on small-scale subsistence in small, highly mobile groups. Some Phoenician and Greek colonies were established along the Mediterranean coast during the 7th century BCE.\nAntiquity and ancient Rome.\nThe most notable nations of antiquity in western North Africa are Carthage, Numidia and Mauretania. The Phoenicians colonized much of North Africa including Carthage and parts of present-day Morocco (including Chellah, Essaouira and Volubilis). The Carthaginians were of Phoenician origin, with the Roman myth of their origin being that Dido, a Phoenician princess, was granted land by a local ruler based on how much land she could cover with a piece of cowhide. She ingeniously devised a method to extend the cowhide to a high proportion, thus gaining a large territory. She was also rejected by the Trojan prince Aeneas according to Virgil, thus creating a historical enmity between Carthage and Rome, as Aeneas would eventually lay the foundations for Rome. The Carthaginian Empire was a commercial power and had a strong navy, but relied on mercenaries for land soldiers. The Carthaginians developed an empire in the Iberian Peninsula, Malta, Sardinia, Corsica and northwest Sicily, the latter being the cause of First Punic War with the Romans.\nOver a hundred years and more, all Carthaginian territory was eventually conquered by the Romans, resulting in the Carthaginian North African territories becoming the Roman province of Africa in 146 B.C. This led to tension and eventually conflict between Numidia and Rome. The Numidian wars are notable for launching the careers of both Gaius Marius, and Sulla, and stretching the constitutional burden of the Roman republic as Marius required a professional army, something previously contrary to Roman values, to overcome the talented military leader Jugurtha. Kingdom of Mauretania remained independent until being annexed to the Roman Empire by Emperor Claudius in 42 AD.\nNorth Africa remained a part of the Roman Empire, producing notable citizens, including Augustine of Hippo, until incompetent leadership from Roman commanders in the early fifth century allowed the Germanic peoples, the Vandals, to cross the Strait of Gibraltar, whereupon they overcame the fickle Roman defense. The loss of North Africa is considered a pinnacle point in the fall of the Western Roman Empire as Africa had previously been an important grain province that maintained Roman prosperity despite the barbarian incursions, and the wealth required to create new armies. The issue of regaining North Africa became paramount to the Western Empire, but was frustrated by Vandal victories. The focus of Roman energy had to be on the emerging threat of the Huns. In 468 AD, the Romans made one last serious attempt to invade North Africa but were repelled. This perhaps marks the point of terminal decline for the Western Roman Empire.\nThe last Roman emperor was deposed in 476 by the Heruli general Odoacer. Trade routes between Europe and North Africa remained intact until the coming of Islam. Some Berbers were members of the Early African Church (but evolved their own Donatist doctrine), some were Berber Jews, and some adhered to traditional Berber religion. African pope Victor I served during the reign of Roman emperor Septimius Severus. Furthermore, during the rule of the Romans, Byzantines, Vandals, Ottomans and Carthaginians the Kabyle people were the only or one of the few in North Africa who remained independent.\nThe Kabyle people were incredibly resistible so much so that even during the Arab conquest of North Africa they still had control and possession over their mountains.\nArab conquest to modern times.\nThe early Muslim conquests included North Africa by 640. By 700, most of North Africa had come under Muslim rule. Indigenous Berbers subsequently started to form their own polities in response in places such as Fez and Sijilmasa. In the eleventh century, a reformist movement made up of members that called themselves the Almoravid dynasty expanded south into Sub-Saharan Africa.\nNorth Africa's populous and flourishing civilization collapsed after exhausting its resources in internal fighting and suffering devastation from the invasion of the Banu Sulaym and Banu Hilal. Ibn Khaldun noted that the lands ravaged by Banu Hilal invaders had become completely arid desert.\nAfter the Middle Ages much of the area was loosely under the control of the Ottoman Empire. The Barbary pirates operated from the largely independent Barbary states located on the coast of North Africa. The Spanish Empire conquered several coastal cities between the 16th and 18th centuries. After the 19th century, the imperial and colonial presence of France, the United Kingdom, Spain and Italy left the entirety of the region under one form of European occupation.\nIn World War II from 1940 to 1943 the area was the setting for the North African Campaign. During the 1950s and 1960s all of the North African states gained independence. There remains a dispute over Western Sahara between Morocco and the Algerian-backed Polisario Front.\nThe wider protest movement known as the Arab Spring began with revolutions in Tunisia and Egypt which ultimately led to the overthrow of their governments, as well as civil war in Libya. Large protests also occurred in Algeria and Morocco to a lesser extent. Many hundreds died in the uprisings.\nGeography.\nNorth Africa has three main geographic features: the Sahara desert in the south, the Atlas Mountains in the west, and the Nile River and delta in the east. The Atlas Mountains extend across much of northern Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia. These mountains are part of the fold mountain system that also runs through much of Southern Europe. They recede to the south and east, becoming a steppe landscape before meeting the Sahara desert, which covers more than 75 percent of the region. The tallest peaks are in the High Atlas range in south-central Morocco, which has many snow-capped peaks.\nSouth of the Atlas Mountains is the dry and barren expanse of the Sahara desert, the largest sand desert in the world. In places the desert is cut by irregular watercourses called wadis\u2014streams that flow only after rainfall but are usually dry. The Sahara's major landforms include ergs, large seas of sand that sometimes form into huge dunes; the hammada, a level rocky plateau without soil or sand; and the reg, a desert pavement. The Sahara covers the southern part of Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia, and most of Libya. Only two regions of Libya are outside the desert: Tripolitania in the northwest and Cyrenaica in the northeast. Most of Egypt is also desert, with the exception of the Nile River and the irrigated land along its banks. The Nile Valley forms a narrow fertile thread that runs along the length of the country.\nSheltered valleys in the Atlas Mountains, the Nile Valley and Delta, and the Mediterranean coast are the main sources of fertile farming land. A wide variety of valuable crops including cereals, rice and cotton, and woods such as cedar and cork, are grown. Typical Mediterranean crops, such as olives, figs, dates and citrus fruits, also thrive in these areas. The Nile Valley is particularly fertile and most of Egypt lives close to the river. Elsewhere, irrigation is essential to improve crop yields on the desert margins.\nEconomy.\nScience and technology.\n\"Further information in the sections of History of science and technology in Africa:\"\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nDemographics.\nEthnic groups.\nThe inhabitants of North Africa are roughly divided in a manner corresponding to the principal geographic regions of North Africa: the Maghreb, the Nile valley, and the Sahel. The countries making up North Africa all have Modern Standard Arabic as their official language. Additionally, Algeria and Morocco recognize Berber as a second official language after Arabic. French also serves as an administrative language in Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia. The most spoken dialects are Maghrebi Arabic, a form of ancient Arabic dating back from the 8th century AD, and Egyptian Arabic. The largest and most numerous ethnic group in North Africa are the Arabs. In Algeria and Morocco, Berbers are the second largest ethnic group after the Arab majority. Arabs constitute 70% to 80% of the population of Algeria, 92% to 97% of Libya, 67% to 70% of Morocco and 98% of Tunisia's population. The Berbers comprise 20% of Algeria, 10% of Libya, 35% of Morocco and 1% of Tunisia's population. The region is predominantly Muslim with a Jewish minority in Morocco and Tunisia, and significant Christian minority\u2014the Copts\u2014in Egypt, Algeria, Morocco, Libya, and Tunisia. In 2001, the number of Christians in North Africa was estimated at 9 million, the majority of whom live in Egypt, with the remainder live in Maghreb countries.\nThe inhabitants of the Spanish Canary Islands are of mixed Spanish and North African Berber ancestry, and the people of Malta are of primarily Southern Italian/Sicilian, as well as, to a lesser extent, North African and Middle Eastern ancestry and speak a derivative of Arabic. However, these areas are not generally considered part of North Africa, but rather Southern Europe, due to their proximity to mainland Europe and their European-based cultures and religion.\nHistoric movements.\nThe Maghreb or western North Africa on the whole is believed to have been inhabited by Berbers and their ancestors since at least 10,000 B.C., while the eastern part of North Africa or the Nile Valley has mainly been home to the Egyptians and Nubians. Ancient Egyptians record extensive contact in their Western desert with people that appear to have been Berber or proto-Berber. As the Tassili n'Ajjer and other rock art findings in the Sahara have shown, the Sahara also hosted various populations before its rapid desertification in 3500 B.C and even today continues to host small populations of nomadic trans-Saharan peoples. Laboratory examination of the Uan Muhuggiag child mummy and Tin Hanakaten child, suggested that the Central Saharan peoples from the Epipaleolithic, Mesolithic, and Pastoral periods possessed dark skin complexions. The archaeological evidence from the Holocene period has shown that Nilo-Saharan speaking groups had populated the central and southern Sahara before the influx of Berber and Arabic speakers, around 1500 years ago, who now largely populate the Sahara in the modern era.\nAfter migrating to North Africa in the 1st millennium BC, Semitic Phoenician settlers from the Levant established over 300 coastal colonies throughout the region and built a powerful empire that controlled most of the region from the 8th century BC until the middle of the 2nd century BC.\nSeveral waves of Arab migrations to the Maghreb began in the 7th century, including the migration of the Banu Hilal and the Banu Sulaym westward into the Maghreb in the eleventh century, which introduced Arab culture and language to the countryside. Historians mark their movement as a critical moment in the Arabization of North Africa. As Arab nomads spread, the territories of the local Berber tribes were moved and shrank. The Zenata were pushed to the west and the Kabyles were pushed to the north. The Berbers took refuge in the mountains whereas the plains were Arabized. This heavily shifted the demographics of the Maghreb.\nThe trans-Saharan slave trade resulted in increased levels of sub-Saharan African ancestry in North Africa. The Haratin are commonly perceived as an endogamous group of former slaves or descendants of slaves.\nGenetic history.\nDNA studies of Iberomaurusian peoples at Taforalt, Morocco dating to around 15,000 years ago have found them to have a distinctive Maghrebi ancestry formed from a mixture of Near Eastern and African ancestry, which is still found as a part of the genome of modern Northwest Africans. A 2025 study sequenced individuals from Takarkori (7,000 YBP) and discovered that most of their ancestry was from an unknown ancestral North African lineage, related to the African admixture component found in Iberomaurusians. According to the study, the Takarkori people were distinct from both contemporary sub-Saharan Africans and non-Africans/Eurasians. They had \"only a minor component of non-African ancestry\" but did \"not carry sub-Saharan African ancestry, suggesting that, contrary to previous interpretations, the Green Sahara was not a corridor connecting northern and sub-Saharan Africa.\"\nLater during the Neolithic, from around 7,500 years ago onwards, there was a migration into Northwest Africa of European Neolithic Farmers from the Iberian Peninsula (who had originated in Anatolia several thousand years prior), as well as pastoralists from the Levant, both of whom also significantly contributed to the ancestry of modern Northwest Africans. The proto-Berber tribes evolved from these prehistoric communities during the late Bronze- and early Iron ages.\nCulture.\nThe majority of the people of the Maghreb and the Sahara regions speak varieties of Arabic and almost exclusively follow Islam. The Arabic and Berber languages are distantly related, both being members of the Afroasiatic language family. The Tuareg Berber languages are notably more conservative than those of the coastal cities.\nOver the years, Berbers have been influenced by contact with other cultures: Egyptians, Greeks, Punic people, Romans, Vandals, Arabs, Europeans, and Africans. The cultures of the Maghreb and the Sahara therefore combines Arab, indigenous Berber and African elements. In the Sahara, the distinction between sedentary oasis inhabitants and nomadic Bedouin Arabs and Tuaregs is particularly marked.\nEgyptians over the centuries have shifted their language from Egyptian (in its late form, varieties of Coptic) to modern Egyptian Arabic while retaining a sense of national identity that has historically set them apart from other people in the region. Most Egyptians are Sunni Muslim, although there is a significant minority of Coptic Christians. The Copts are the largest Christian denomination in the Middle East and North Africa.\nThe Maghreb formerly had a significant Jewish population, almost all of whom emigrated to France or Israel when the North African nations gained independence. Prior to the modern establishment of Israel, there were about 500,000 Jews in northern Africa, including both Sephardi Jews (refugees from Spain, France and Portugal from the Renaissance era) as well as indigenous Mizrahi Jews. Today, less than 3,000 remain in the region, almost all in Morocco and Tunisia, and are mostly part of a French-speaking urban elite.

The Patriots compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member of the American Football Conference (AFC) East division. The Patriots play home games at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Massachusetts, which is southwest of Boston, Massachusetts. The franchise is owned by Robert Kraft, who purchased the team in 1994. As of 2024, the Patriots are the sixth-most valuable sports team in the world and have sold out every home game since 1994.\nFounded in 1959 as the Boston Patriots, the team was a charter member of the American Football League (AFL) before joining the NFL in 1970 through the AFL\u2013NFL merger. The Patriots played their home games at various stadiums throughout Boston, including Fenway Park from 1963 to 1969 until the franchise moved to Foxborough in 1971. As part of the move, the team changed its name to the New England Patriots. Home games were played at Foxboro Stadium until 2002 when the stadium was demolished alongside the opening of Gillette Stadium. The team began using Gillette Stadium for home games the same year.\nGenerally mediocre until coming under the ownership of Robert Kraft, the Patriots experienced unexpected success in the 2001 season under head coach Bill Belichick and quarterback Tom Brady, which started a period of dominance which lasted until the 2019 season. The Brady\u2013Belichick era, regarded as one of the greatest sports dynasties, would see the Patriots claim nearly every major Super Bowl record. The Patriots hold the records for most Super Bowl wins (6, tied with the Pittsburgh Steelers), appearances (11), and losses (5, tied with the Denver Broncos). Other NFL records held by the franchise include the most wins in a 10-year period (126 from 2003 to 2012), the longest winning streak of regular season and playoff games (21 from October 2003 to October 2004), the most consecutive winning seasons (19 from 2001 to 2019), the most consecutive conference championship appearances (8 from 2011 to 2018), the most consecutive division titles (11 from 2009 to 2019), the only undefeated 16-game regular season (2007), and the highest postseason winning percentage (.638).\nHistory.\nAFL years (1959\u20131970).\nOn November 16, 1959, Boston business executive Billy Sullivan was awarded the eighth and final franchise of the developing American Football League (AFL). The following winter, locals were allowed to submit ideas for the Boston football team's official name. The most popular choice \u2013 and the one that Sullivan selected \u2013 was the \"Boston Patriots\", with \"Patriots\" referring to the colonists of the Thirteen Colonies who rebelled against British control during the American Revolution and in July 1776 declared the United States of America an independent nation, which heavily involved the then\u2013colony of Massachusetts. Immediately thereafter, artist Phil Bissell of \"The Boston Globe\" developed the \"Pat Patriot\" logo.\nThe Patriots never had a regular home stadium in the AFL; home games were played at various times at Boston University Field, Harvard Stadium, Fenway Park (shared with baseball's Boston Red Sox), and Boston College's Alumni Stadium. The 1963 season saw the franchise's first playoff win over Buffalo to clinch the division. They subsequently lost the AFL championship game to the San Diego Chargers 51\u201310. They did not appear again in an AFL or NFL post-season game for another 13 years.\nPost-merger years (1970\u20132000).\nWhen the NFL and AFL merged in 1970, the Patriots were placed in the American Football Conference (AFC) East division, where they still play. The following year, the Patriots moved to a new stadium in Foxborough, Massachusetts, their home for the next 30 years. They announced a new name, the Bay State Patriots, after the state of Massachusetts, but the NFL rejected it; on March 22, 1971, the team said they would change its geographic name to New England.\nDuring the 1970s, the Patriots had some success under head coach Chuck Fairbanks, earning a berth in the playoffs in 1976 \u2013 as a wild card team \u2013 and in 1978 \u2013 as AFC East champions. They lost in the first round both times.\nThe next coach, Ron Meyer, led the team to the playoffs in the strike-shortened 1982 season. That season, during a December 12, 1982, home game against the Miami Dolphins under icy conditions, the game remained scoreless until the fourth quarter when Meyer motioned to snowplow operator Mark Henderson to specifically clear a spot on the field for New England kicker John Smith so he could kick what proved to be the game-winning 33-yard field goal to give the Patriots a 3\u20130 win. At the time, an emergency ground rule was put into play where the officials could call time-out and allow the ground crew to use a snowplow to clear the yard markers, but not plow often enough to keep the field clear. Dolphins head coach Don Shula, believing it to be against the league rules, pointed out that the league's unfair act clause allowed the league to overturn it, and met with NFL commissioner Pete Rozelle several days later to formally protest the game result. Although Rozelle agreed with Shula that the use of the plow gave the Patriots an unfair advantage, he said that he had never reversed the result of a game and was not going to start doing so for any reason, including cheating. Henderson, a convict on work release, jokingly remarked, \"What are they gonna do, throw me in jail?\"\nThe following year, the NFL banned the use of snowplows on the field during a game. The Patriots organization has commemorated the game with an exhibit at the Hall at Patriot Place within Gillette Stadium, where the plow itself hangs from the ceiling. Meyer never had a losing record but was fired in 1984 due to poor relationships with players and management. He was replaced by Hall-of-Fame player Raymond Berry, who in 1985 led the team to its first AFC Championship and a berth in Super Bowl XX, which they lost to the Chicago Bears 46\u201310. Berry left the team after a disappointing 1989 season, and his replacement Rod Rust only lasted one season, 1990, during which the Patriots went 1\u201315.\nOwnership turmoil.\nDuring the late 1980s and early 1990s, the Patriots changed ownership several times, being purchased from the Sullivan family first by Victor Kiam in 1988, who sold the team to James Orthwein in 1992. Though Orthwein's period as owner was short and controversial, he did oversee major changes to the team, first with the hiring of former New York Giants coach Bill Parcells in 1993. Orthwein and his marketing team then defied Patriots fans' overwhelming preference and commissioned the NFL to develop a new visual identity and logo, and changed their primary colors from the traditional red, white and blue to blue and silver for the team uniforms. Orthwein intended to move the team to his native St. Louis (where it would have been renamed as the St. Louis Stallions), but instead sold the team in 1994 for $175million to Boston paper magnate Robert Kraft, who had bought the Patriots' then-home, Foxboro Stadium, out of bankruptcy in 1988.\nContinuing on as head coach under Kraft's ownership, Parcells would bring the Patriots to two playoff appearances, including Super Bowl XXXI (after the 1996 season), which they lost to the Green Bay Packers by a score of 35\u201321. Pete Carroll, Parcells's successor, would also take the team to the playoffs twice in 1997 and 1998 before being dismissed as head coach after the 1999 season.\nBrady\u2013Belichick era (2000\u20132019).\nIn 2000, the Patriots hired head coach Bill Belichick, who had served as defensive coordinator under Parcells including during Super Bowl XXXI. Their new home field, Gillette Stadium, opened in 2002 to replace the aging Foxboro Stadium. Long-time starting quarterback Drew Bledsoe, who was the franchise's star throughout the 1990s, went down with a sheared blood vessel in his chest in a week two match-up in 2001 against the rival New York Jets. Backup quarterback Tom Brady, drafted by the Patriots in the sixth round of the 2000 NFL draft, became the starting quarterback. Brady's successful play led to Bledsoe never getting his job back as a starter, and would serve as the franchise's starting quarterback for the next 18 years. Under Belichick and Brady, the Patriots became one of the most consistently dominant teams in the NFL, with many describing the team as a \"dynasty\". Within the first few seasons of the 21st century, the team won three Super Bowls in four seasons (2001, 2003, and 2004), over the St. Louis Rams, Carolina Panthers, and Philadelphia Eagles, respectively. In the 2005 season, the Patriots went 10\u20136 and won the division. The Patriots defeated the Jacksonville Jaguars in the Wild Card Round before falling to the Denver Broncos in the Divisional Round. In the 2006 season, the Patriots went 12\u20134 and won the division. After defeating the Jets and the Chargers, the Patriots lost in the AFC Championship to the Colts. \nAlmost perfect season.\nThe Patriots finished the 2007 regular season with a perfect 16\u20130 record, becoming only the fourth team in league history to go undefeated in the regular season, and the only one since the league expanded its regular season schedule to 16 games. After advancing to Super Bowl XLII, the team's fourth Super Bowl in seven years, the Patriots were upset by the Giants to end their bid for a 19\u20130 season. With the loss, the Patriots ended the year at 18\u20131, becoming only one of three teams to go 18\u20131 along with the 1984 San Francisco 49ers and the 1985 Chicago Bears. However, both the Bears and 49ers lost their only game during the regular season, and both would win their respective Super Bowl. During the season, the Patriots were disciplined by the league for videotaping New York Jets' defensive coaches' signals from an unauthorized location during a September 9, 2007, game. Videotaping opposing coaches is not illegal in the NFL \"de jure\", but there are designated areas allowed by the league to do such taping. After an investigation, the NFL fined Patriots head coach Bill Belichick $500,000 for his role in the incident, fined the Patriots $250,000, and docked the team their original first-round selection in the 2008 NFL draft, which would have been the 31st pick of the draft. \nPostseason losses.\nIn the first game of the 2008 season, Brady suffered a torn ACL against the Chiefs. Matt Cassell stepped in for the rest of the season and the team finished 11\u20135 but missed the postseason. In the 2009 season, Brady returned from his injury and led the team to a 10\u20136 record and a division title. The team's season ended in the Wild Card Round with a 33\u201314 loss to the Baltimore Ravens. The Patriots went 14\u20132 and won the division in the 2010 season but were one-and-done in the Divisional Round of the playoffs against the New York Jets in a 28\u201321 loss.\nThe Patriots returned to the Super Bowl in 2011 but lost again to the Giants, 21\u201317. In the 2012 season, the Patriots won the AFC East with a 12\u20134 record. The team defeated the Houston Texans in the Divisional Round before falling to the Baltimore Ravens in the AFC Championship. In the 2013 season, the Patriots went 12\u20134 and won the division. The Patriots defeated the Indianapolis Colts 43\u201322 in the Divisional Round before falling to the Denver Broncos 26\u201316 in the AFC Championship. \nReturn to glory.\nIn 2014, the Patriots won the division with a 12\u20134 record. The Patriots defeated the Baltimore Ravens in the Divisional Round and the Indianapolis Colts in the AFC Championship. During the against the Indianapolis Colts, allegations arose that the Patriots were using under-inflated footballs. It was even suggested that the Patriots' staff themselves deliberately deflated the footballs to give their team an unfair advantage during the playoffs. The event was known as Deflategate. A lengthy investigation and heated debate commenced shortly afterwards, with a full report being published in May 2015. The Wells Report found that balls provided by the Patriots, who were the home team, indeed had less pressure on average than the balls provided by the Colts. Also notable was the findings of some suggestions of communication between Tom Brady and two Patriots locker room attendants, indicating Brady was likely \"generally aware\" of the situation and that the Patriots staff intentionally deflated the footballs. A later study by the American Enterprise Institute called the evidence and methodology of the Wells report \"deeply flawed\" and \"unreliable\".\nIn the aftermath of the incident, the NFL suspended Brady without pay for the first four games of the 2015 season, fined the Patriots $1million, and forced them to forfeit their 2016 first round draft pick and 2017 fourth round draft pick. Brady appealed his suspension, which was eventually vacated by the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, only for the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit to reinstate it a year later for the 2016 NFL season. Brady eventually agreed to serve the suspension in 2016, but led the Patriots to win Super Bowl LI in spite of it.\nDespite the controversy, the Patriots reached a record-tying eighth Super Bowl, where they defeated the defending champion Seattle Seahawks by a score of 28\u201324 to win Super Bowl XLIX for their fourth title. After Seattle had driven the ball to New England's 1-yard line with under a minute to go, New England rookie cornerback Malcolm Butler made a critical interception on Seattle's final offensive play that helped to seal the victory. In the 2015 season, the Patriots won the division with a 12\u20134 record. The team defeated the Kansas City Chiefs in the Divisional Round before falling to the Denver Broncos in the AFC Championship. \nNew England became the first team to reach nine Super Bowls in the 2016\u201317 playoffs and faced the Atlanta Falcons in Super Bowl LI. Trailing 28\u20133 midway through the third quarter, the Patriots scored 25 unanswered points to tie the game in the final seconds of regulation. In the first overtime in Super Bowl history, the Patriots won the coin toss and scored a touchdown to claim their fifth Super Bowl victory. The Patriots extended their record to ten Super Bowl appearances in the 2017\u201318 playoffs but lost to the Philadelphia Eagles in Super Bowl LII. The Patriots returned to the championship game for a third consecutive season in Super Bowl LIII, where they defeated the Los Angeles Rams 13\u20133 to win their sixth Super Bowl, tying them with the Pittsburgh Steelers for most Super Bowl victories in NFL history.\nPost-Brady era (2019\u2013present).\nAfter a disappointing 2019 season, in which the team lost in the first round of the playoffs to the Tennessee Titans, and in which the long-time Brady\u2013Belichick partnership was strained due to Brady wanting to have more input in organizational decisions, Brady departed the Patriots after 20 seasons for free agency, signing with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. To replace him, the Patriots signed veteran quarterback Cam Newton. In 2020, the team missed the playoffs with their first losing record, 7\u20139, in two decades. The team drafted Mac Jones in the first round of the 2021 NFL draft, and released Newton after naming Jones the starting quarterback before the team's first game of the 2021 season. Jones led the team to their first playoff berth without Brady since 1998, but they would lose 47\u201317 to the division rival Buffalo Bills in the Wild Card round. The Patriots finished with an 8\u20139 record and missed the postseason in the 2022 season.\nAfter a gloomy 4\u201313 record in the 2023 season, the Patriots mutually parted ways with Bill Belichick after 24 years on January 11, 2024, notably due to a series of poor decisions in his final years as general manager regarding offensive personnel, which culminated in a sharp decline of offensive production after the 2021 season. One day later, the Patriots promoted the pair of Jerod Mayo, then-current linebackers coach and former player, and Eliot Wolf, director of scouting and son of Pro Football Hall of Fame general manager Ron Wolf, as first-time head coach and first-time \"de facto\" general manager to each succeed Belichick's duties. Mac Jones, after three seasons as the incumbent starter, was traded in the 2024 offseason due to his insufficient play. The post-Belichick era was kickstarted during the 2024 NFL draft, with the franchise selecting Drake Maye third overall, the highest draft pick held by the Patriots in 31 years up to that point. On the day of the final game of the 2024 season, the Patriots fired Jerod Mayo after repeating the prior year's 4\u201313 record in his debut campaign as a head coach, due to multiple factors, including limited experience, which was eventually described by Robert Kraft as being put in an \"untenable situation\". Mike Vrabel was named head coach after Mayo's dismissal.\nLogos and uniforms.\nPrimary logos.\nThe Patriots original helmet logo was a simple tricorne hat, used only for the 1960 season. From 1961 to 1992, the Patriots used a logo of a Revolutionary War minuteman hiking a football. The Patriots wordmark logo during this time consisted of a western-style font. The minuteman logo became known as the \"Pat Patriot\" logo, which later became the name of the team's mascot.\nIn 1979, the Patriots worked with NFL Properties to design a new, streamlined logo, to replace the complex Pat Patriot logo. The new logo featured the blue and white profile of a minuteman in a tricorne hat set against a flag showing three red stripes separated by two white stripes. Team owner Billy Sullivan decided to put the new logo up to a vote against Pat Patriot with the fans at the September 23 home game against the San Diego Chargers, using a sound level meter to judge the crowd's reaction. The new logo was decidedly rejected by the crowd in favor of Pat, and the concept was shelved.\nIn 1993, a new logo was unveiled involving the gray face of a minuteman wearing a red, white and royal blue hat that begins as a tricorne and transitions into a flowing banner-like design. It became popularly known as the \"Flying Elvis\" due to many observing its resemblance to the profile of a young Elvis Presley. A new script logo was introduced as well in tandem with the \"Flying Elvis\", utilizing a cursive font.\nIn 2000, the blue color used on the tricorne of the \"Flying Elvis\" as well as the outline of the cursive wordmark was switched from royal blue to nautical blue to coincide with the uniform change in the new millennium.\nOn July 3, 2013, the Patriots unveiled a new wordmark to accompany the \"Flying Elvis\", which replaced the script of their previous cursive typeface with modernized block letters (colored in blue or white depending on the background), and modified the \"Flying Elvis\" to be underneath instead of flowing up-top. While appearing everywhere else, it was not applied on the uniforms until the 2015 season due to NFL uniform policies.\nUniforms.\n1960\u20131992.\nThe Patriots' primary uniforms remained largely unchanged from the franchises' inaugural season until 1993. The Patriots originally wore red jerseys with white block numbering at home, and white jerseys with red block numbering on the road. Both uniforms used white pants and white helmets, first with the hat logo over the player's number, then with the \"Pat Patriot\" logo starting in 1961. A blue stripe was added to the two red helmet stripes in 1964. The numbers on both the home and away jerseys gained a blue outline in 1973. In 1979, the Patriots began the first of many sporadic runs of wearing red pants with the white jerseys. The red pants were dropped in 1981, but returned in 1984. After being dropped again in 1988, they were used again from 1990 to 1992.\n1993\u20131999.\nThe Patriots underwent a complete identity overhaul before the 1993 season, starting with the introduction of the aforementioned \"Flying Elvis\" logo. The new uniforms consisted of a royal blue home jersey and a white away jersey. The helmet was silver with the Flying Elvis logo and no additional striping. Both uniforms used silver pants, originally with stripes designed to look like those flowing from the Flying Elvis, but these were changed to simple red and blue stripes after one season. When they debuted, both the home and away jerseys used red block numbers with a blue and white outline, but after one season the home uniforms switched to the now-familiar white with a red outline.\nIn 1995, the Patriots switched the block numbers to a more modern rounded number font with a dropshadow. The Patriots were one of the first adopters of custom numbers, a trend that would grow drastically over the next 20 years.\n2000\u20132019.\nIn 2000, the Patriots then became one of the few teams at the time to drop the rounded numbers and switch back to block numbers. The shade of blue was switched for the first time in the franchises' history, from royal to nautical blue. The jerseys once again had the number on the shoulders while the logo moved back to the sleeves. \"New Century\" silver stripes were also added to the home jersey, with nautical blue stripes appearing on the away jersey. The Patriots, unsatisfied with the 1990s white-on-silver road look, also took the opportunity to introduce blue pants to be worn with the white jersey, offering a better contrast. To better match the blue pants, the number on the white jersey was switched from red to blue.\nThough the Patriots had generally worn silver pants with the blue jerseys, and navy pants with the white jerseys, they did wear an all-blue set during the 2002 season. On two consecutive home games that season, the Patriots wore blue tops with their road blue pants and white socks; they lost both games (Week 6 vs. the Packers, and Week 8 vs. the Broncos). The team would not wear an all-blue set again until the introduction of the Color Rush uniforms in 2016.\nThroughout the 2011 season, the Patriots wore dark patches with white lettering on their uniforms with the initials 'MHK' in honor of Myra Kraft, the late long-time spouse of owner Robert Kraft.\n2020\u2013present.\nIn 2020, the Patriots made some changes to their uniform. The all-blue \"Color Rush\" design became the primary home uniform, complete with a tweaked nameplate font and numbers, and blue/red/white socks. A corresponding white uniform was also unveiled, also paired with the blue pants. Both uniforms featured truncated shoulder striping as a nod to the \"Pat Patriot\" uniforms. Coincidentally, the arrival of new jerseys occurred with the departure of long-time quarterback, Tom Brady, from the Patriots. Brady was in New England exactly between the last uniform change in 2000, and left before the 2020 uniform change in 2019.\nThe Patriots brought back the silver pants to pair with the current uniforms in a 2022 Week 7 home game on Monday Night Football against the Chicago Bears. Unlike the previous silver pants the team wore from 2000 to 2019, this design featured thicker red stripes, matching the same width as the middle blue stripe. During a 2024 Week 7 road game at Wembley Stadium against the Jacksonville Jaguars, the Patriots paired their silver pants with the road white uniform for the first time since 1999. After their largest victory of the 2024 season in a Week 10 road game dressed again in the silver pants with the road white uniform, the Patriots quietly promoted the silver pants to full-time use with both the home and road uniform for the rest of the season.\nFor the Patriots' 2025 Week 6 road game at the New Orleans Saints, they reintroduced white pants to the primary uniform rotation, wearing them with the road white uniform. The Patriots last wore an all-white kit in 2017. Like with the silver pants, the white pants feature red-blue-red side stripes.\nAlternate uniforms.\nIn 1994, the Patriots wore the \"Pat Patriot\" helmets and plain white striped pants from two seasons earlier as alternates as part of the NFL's 75th-anniversary celebration. In 2002, NFL teams were allowed to add a permanent third jersey to be worn in a maximum of two games. The Patriots reintroduced a red jersey as their alternate, complemented with the old-style \"Pat Patriot\" helmet. In 2003, the Patriots changed their alternate to a silver jersey with blue pants. For this uniform, the \"Flying Elvis\" helmet was used. The uniform was identical to the white jersey with any areas of white replaced by silver. These uniforms were dropped after 2007. No alternate uniform was used in 2008. In 2009, the red alternate was reintroduced, again accompanied by the \"Pat Patriot\" helmet. An alternate white road jersey was also worn with the older helmet for one game, using red numbers, in tribute to the 50th anniversary of the AFL. The red alternate gained a blue outline around the numbers in 2010 and this was worn through 2012. The Patriots temporarily retired their alternate red uniforms in 2013, thanks to a new NFL rule outlawing throwback alternate helmets, and restricting teams to one helmet shell only. However, after the NFL reinstated the use of alternate helmets in 2022, the Patriots brought back the throwback red uniforms.\nIn 2016, the Patriots took part in the NFL's Color Rush program, wearing monochrome navy uniforms on September 22 against the Houston Texans. The uniform tops were patterned after the 1980s Pat Patriot-era uniforms, while the pants featured thick white stripes with red accents. They have worn them a total of four times since 2016. In 2017, an all-white Color Rush uniform was introduced and used for the Patriots' Thursday night road game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.\nIn 2025, the Patriots unveiled a \"Rivalries\" uniform that would be worn at home against each of their AFC East opponents over a three-year period. Dubbed the \"Nor'easter\", the design featured a Storm Blue base with white and navy shoulder stripes, italicized white numbers with navy drop shadows, and a new \"NE\" patch on the sleeves. Six red stars along the neckline represent each of New England's six states. The uniform is worn with white pants and helmets, which featured a silver-trimmed \"Flying Elvis\" decal without red accents.\nFacilities.\nStadium and headquarters.\nSince 2002, the Patriots' home stadium has been Gillette Stadium, located 22 miles outside Boston in Foxborough, Massachusetts. A $350million facility privately financed by Robert Kraft, it houses the team's practice facilities, administrative offices, and its owning entity The Kraft Group, as well as the Kraft-owned Major League Soccer team, the New England Revolution. The field's natural grass was replaced with a FieldTurf surface during the 2006 season. The Patriots installed a new video board, the largest in the United States, in 2023. Gillette Stadium has hosted more postseason games than any other venue except Candlestick Park's 27. From 2001 to 2019, the Patriots often played home playoff games. The Patriots had a 19\u20134 playoff record in this stadium after the 2019 NFL season, . Beginning in 2007, the area around the stadium was developed into a $375million \"lifestyle and entertainment center\" called Patriot Place; among its largest structures is a multi-floor restaurant and bar called CBS Scene.\nFrom 1971\u2014the team's second year in the NFL after the AFL\u2013NFL merger\u2014to 2002, the Patriots played in the privately funded Foxboro Stadium. The final game in this stadium was the 2001 AFC Divisional Playoff game which was a 16\u201313 overtime win over the visiting Oakland Raiders, known for the raging snowstorm and the \"tuck rule\" call. During the team's days in the American Football League and its first year in the NFL, the Boston Patriots were hosted by a number of fields in or around Boston.\nTraining camp and practice.\nFrom 1976 to 2002, the team held training camp at Bryant College in Smithfield, Rhode Island. From 1960 to 1961, then from 1969 to 1975, the Patriots held training camp at University of Massachusetts Amherst. Between 1962 and 1968, the Patriots held training camp at Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts.\nAircraft.\nIn 2017, the Patriots purchased two Boeing 767-300ERs for use as team planes, with one serving as the backup, which were ready in time for the 2017 NFL season. This made them the first team in league history to own their own planes. At the time it was getting more difficult for professional sports teams to book private charter flights, with eight teams being dropped that season, as major commercial airlines were instead focusing on more profitable scheduled flights. The two jet airliners, N366AA and N39367, were previously operated by American Airlines from 1991 to 2016. The planes are known affectionately as \"AirKrafts\" after team owner Robert Kraft. Kraft lent one of the planes to transport students to the March for Our Lives demonstration in Washington, D.C. in 2018.\nIn 2020, the New England Patriots signed an agreement with Eastern Airlines to handle the operations of their planes. In July 2023, the Patriots filed a lawsuit against Eastern Airlines over an alleged breach of contract. Since February 2024, the planes are operated by Omni Air International.\nRivalries.\nIn terms of number of games played, the Patriots have competed most against other teams in the AFC East division and developed rivalries with the Buffalo Bills, Miami Dolphins, and New York Jets. These teams were all a part of the AFC East division since the AFL\u2013NFL merger, as well as the former AFL Eastern division. Outside their division, the Pariots have a rivalry with the Indianapolis Colts, who were members of the AFC East from 1970 to 2001, the Baltimore Ravens, and the Pittsburgh Steelers. Outside of the AFC, the Patriots also had a rivalry with the New York Giants.\nStrategy and influence.\nUnder head coach Bill Belichick, the Patriots employed specific on-field and off-field strategies. On the field, the Patriots typically used an \"Erhardt\u2013Perkins\" offense and a \"Fairbanks\u2013Bullough\" 3\u20134 defense, referred to commonly as a two-gap 3\u20134 defensive system. Under Erhardt's, Perkin's and Bullough's stints as coordinators and head coaches across the league after developing the scheme in collaboration with head coach Chuck Fairbanks, the systems developed in New England in the 1970s would begin to see historic use. Influence spread, especially under their coaching tree in Bill Parcells' schemes as head coach of the New York Giants in the mid-to-late 1980s, after serving as a linebacker coach for the Patriots in 1980. Parcells would come back to New England as head coach in 1993 and re-install the system used in the 1970s and 1980s, re-uniting with Ray Perkins as WR coach. Parcells own coaching tree would use the scheme created in New England as well, especially Belichick, once he was named as head coach after years of being an assistant to Parcells with the New York Giants, the Patriots, and the New York Jets.\nDuring Belichick's tenure, the philosophy in making personnel decisions and in game planning focused on the \"team\" concept, stressing preparation, strong work ethic, versatility, and lack of individual ego.\nThe team culture under Belichick, dubbed the \"Patriot Way\", included:\nChampionships.\nSuper Bowl championships.\nThe New England Patriots have won six Super Bowls, the league championship of the NFL. The franchise is tied for the most all-time with the Pittsburgh Steelers. The team repeated as champions between the 2003 and 2004 NFL seasons, they are only among eight NFL franchises to accomplish the feat. Between 2001 and 2004, the Patriots became the second team in NFL history to win three Super Bowls in four years (2001, 2003, and 2004).\nAFC championships.\nThe Patriots have won eleven AFC Championships, the record for the most conference championships all-time in the NFL.\nDivision championships.\nThe Patriots have won 22 Division Championships, which is second place for the most all-time behind the Pittsburgh Steelers and Dallas Cowboys, who are tied in first with 24. One of these divisional titles was won in the AFL in the AFL East (1963), the rest were won in the AFC East of the NFL.\nStatistics, records, and awards.\nSeason by season results.\nThis is a partial list of the Patriots' last five completed seasons.\n\"Note: The finish, wins, losses, and ties columns list regular season results and exclude any postseason play.\"\nIndividual awards.\nPatriots have received league honorific awards from the Associated Press, except for the NFL's Super Bowl MVP and the Pro Football Writers of America's Executive of the Year. Seasons in which the AFL counterparts of the awards were won (1960\u20131969) are labeled.\nBold indicates those elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nPlayers of note.\nPro Football Hall of Famers.\nThe Pro Football Hall of Fame has inducted six players who made their primary contribution to professional football while with the Patriots. The Patriots' total number of Pro Football Hall of Famers is 12 (11 players and 1 coach).\nNotes:\nPatriots Hall of Fame.\nThe Patriots Hall of Fame features 31 former players and four contributors as a part of the franchise's own hall of fame, founded to independently commemorate significant members of the organization within the club's history. It is referred to by the team as \"the franchise's highest individual honor\". It was established in 1991, with John Hannah being the inaugural member.\nThe physical Patriots Hall of Fame building opened in 2008 outside of the stadium at Patriot Place, presented by RTX. Featuring a vast collection of game-worn gear, game-used equipment, memorabilia, trophies, in addition to multiple exhibits using audio and video technology, it is periodically renovated and updated yearly. It is described as a \"modern, interactive museum\".\nA committee of media and staff selected 11 players for enshrinement between 1991 and 2001, before a six-year span of no selections. In 2007, in advance of the grand opening of the physical Patriots Hall of Fame in 2008, the club introduced a new nomination committee to select three candidates, with the winner of an internet fan vote being enshrined in the hall of fame. In order to be eligible, players and head coaches must be retired for at least four years. Beginning in 2011, and meeting every four-to-five years, a senior selection committee has the option of voting a player who has been retired for at least 25 seasons into the hall of fame, alongside the traditional inductee.\nStarting in 2009, long-time \"contributors\", which can range from roles such as assistant coaches and broadcasters, have been periodically inducted into the Patriots Hall of Fame directly by owner Robert Kraft. Former team owner and founder Billy Sullivan was posthumously inducted in March 2009, before the Patriots' 50th season, as the first contributor inducted.\nNotes:\nNFL All-Decade and Anniversary team selections.\nPatriots were named to the AFL All-Time Team (1960\u20131969), as well any NFL all-decade team after the AFL\u2013NFL merger in 1970 (and NFL 75th and 100th Anniversary All-Time Teams, selected in 1994 and 2019, respectively). Only those who spent time with New England during the respective decades are listed for all-decade team selections.\nBold indicates those elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nPro Bowl selections.\nTwo Patriots have been named Pro Bowl MVP: Vito \"Babe\" Parilli in 1966 (AFL) and Ty Law, 1998's co-MVP.\nThree Patriots coaches have participated in the Pro Bowl as conference coaches: Mike Holovak in 1963 and 1966 (AFL), Chuck Fairbanks in 1978, and Bill Belichick in 2006 and 2010.\nPatriots players named to the Pro Bowl (or the AFL All-Star game before 1970):\nFirst-team All-Pro selections.\nThese Patriots have been named AP first-team All-Pro (or All-AFL before 1970):\n \nAdministration and personnel.\nOwnership.\nThe Patriots have had four owners since becoming a franchise, the first being Massachusetts native Billy Sullivan from 1959 to 1988. During Sullivan's 28 seasons of owning the club, the Patriots tallied 14 winning records, made six playoff appearances, played in the 1963 AFL Championship Game and represented the AFC in Super Bowl XX. However, he was also notoriously cheap, and would cause friction with some his high-profile players who were seeking to be respected and paid more, causing someone such as future Pro Football Hall of Famer Mike Haynes to seek an owner who was team first.\nAfter his bankruptcy, Sullivan sold the team to Remington Products owner Victor Kiam in 1988. The sale did not include Foxboro Stadium, which Sullivan lost in a bankruptcy sale to paper magnate Robert Kraft, and Kiam lost money on the deal. In 1990, Lisa Olson, a \"Boston Herald\" reporter, sued Kiam and the Patriots when Zeke Mowatt allegedly exposed himself and made lewd comments to her in the team change room. The incident stirred debate over female reporters in the locker room. Kiam became the center of the controversy when he came to the defense of the players' actions.\nIn his later career, Kiam's business interests moved on from the Patriots, so he sold them in 1992 to St. Louis businessman James Orthwein. During his ownership, Orthwein hired Bill Parcells as head coach and oversaw the drafting of first-overall draft pick quarterback Drew Bledsoe, who helped to return the moribund franchise to respectability. He planned to relocate the Patriots franchise to St. Louis, renaming the team the St. Louis Stallions. However, those plans were derailed when Boston paper magnate Robert Kraft, owner of Foxboro Stadium, refused to accept a buyout of the lease. Kraft used his ownership of the stadium to stage a hostile takeover, offering to pay $175 million for the Patriots franchise knowing that Orthwein no longer wanted the team if he could not move it to St. Louis. Although future St. Louis/Los Angeles Rams owner Stan Kroenke offered to buy the team for $200 million and move it to St. Louis, Orthwein would have been saddled with all moving expenses. He also would have been responsible for any legal expenses as well, and Kraft had already made it clear that he would go to court to enforce the lease. With no other choice, Orthwein accepted Kraft's bid on January 21, 1994.\nKraft had been a life-long fan (he was a season ticket holder since 1971) before he purchased the team and intended to support them much more than all of the previous owners did, making multiple moves that have turned New England into an admirable franchise since. The Patriots under Kraft have been the NFL's most successful franchise since 1994. Since then, the Patriots have appeared in ten Super Bowls, have won six, and had numerous league records established by the franchise.\nIn September\u202f2025, Robert Kraft agreed to sell minority stakes in the franchise: 5 percent to billionaire investor Dean Metropoulos and 3 percent to private equity firm Sixth Street. The deal, which still requires approval by NFL owners, values the team at around $9 billion. The Kraft family will retain more than 90\u202fpercent ownership.\nHead coaches.\nThe Patriots have had 16 head coaches throughout their history as a franchise. On January 12, 2025, the Patriots hired Mike Vrabel as their 16th head coach in franchise history, he is the second coach in the club's history to have played for the team (2001\u20132008).\nBill Belichick had the longest tenure as head coach (23 seasons) with the Patriots, and coached the team from 2000 to 2023. He has been widely considered one of the greatest coaches of all time, and was named a member of the NFL 100th All-Time Anniversary Team, due to his numerous accomplishments with the Patriots. He specifically led the Patriots to 17 AFC East division titles, 13 appearances in the AFC Championship Game, and nine Super Bowl appearances, with a record six wins.\nBelichick was the NFL's longest-tenured head coach at the time of his departure, as well as the first all-time in playoff coaching wins with 31 and third in regular season coaching wins in the NFL with 297. He is one of only three head coaches who have won six NFL titles. He was named the NFL Coach of the Year for the 2003, 2007, and 2010 seasons.\nBelichick was acquired in a \"trade\" with the rival New York Jets. Belichick did not want to be under Bill Parcells' authority there in 2000, with uncertainty of his role once their owner, Leon Hess, died. The initial promise was that Belichick would've been granted extreme authority over all of the Jets executive decisions, but when Hess died Parcells overruled the stipulation with loopholes, so he would remain in control as general manager, leading to Belichick's infamous resignation in 2000. Parcells, a two winning Super Bowl champion coach with the New York Giants (also was an assistant with the Patriots in the early 1980s), had joined New England's staff for the 1993 season to help resurrect the franchise from its dark early 1990s days but had conflicted interests with owner Robert Kraft. In his last year with the Patriots in 1996, Parcells brought in his assistant head coach from his Giants days, Belichick, after being dismissed from coaching five seasons with the Cleveland Browns. Here, Kraft would plant the seeds of a bond between him and Belichick, as Belichick would often mediate issues between Kraft and Parcells. Although Belichick left in 1997 to once again be Parcells assistant in their Jets regime, cold feet about his long-term role there brought him back after negotiating with Kraft, even though he was still under contract with the Jets. The Patriots had technically \"tampered\" in communicating with Belichick. For compensation, the Patriots gave the Jets their first round pick in the 2000 NFL draft, where even without their first round pick, the Patriots would coincidentally draft Tom Brady in the sixth round, widely regarded as the greatest quarterback of all time and the NFL's greatest draft steal.\nWhile Belichick led the team to nine of their eleven Super Bowl appearances, winning six of them, before him the Patriots saw some championship game appearances. Holovak, Raymond Berry and Parcells all led the Patriots to league championship games, with only one coach failing to reach the Super Bowl. Five Patriots head coaches, Holovak, Chuck Fairbanks, Berry, Parcells, and Belichick, have been named Coach of the Year by at least one major news organization. The first head coach in franchise history was Lou Saban, who coached them to a 7\u201312\u20130 record in the 1960 season.\nNote:\nCulture.\nCheerleaders.\nThe Patriots' professional cheerleading squad is the New England Patriots Cheerleaders which represents the team in the NFL. Notable alumni of the cheerleading squad include wrestler Carmella and model Camille Kostek. Long-time cheerleading director Tracy Sormanti, who was the cheer director since 1994 and had been involved with the organization since 1983, died after a three-year battle with multiple myeloma in 2020. She was inducted into the Patriots Hall of Fame in 2021 as a contributor.\nMascots.\nThe Patriots' official mascot since 1995 has been Pat Patriot, a revolutionary minuteman wearing a Patriots home jersey based on the original logo of the same name.\nThe Patriots also employ a corps known as the End Zone Militia, a group of American Revolutionary War reenactors founded in 1996 by Geoff Campbell, a reenactor for the 9th Massachusetts Regiment (26th Continental Regiment). Consisting of about 30 men and women, they dress 20 for each home game and split themselves into two groups of 10 lining the back of either end zone. When the Patriots score \u2013 whether it be a touchdown, field goal, point-after-touchdown or safety \u2013 the militia behind the opposite end zone fire a volley of blanks from flintlock muskets. Per an interview with the \"Loren &amp; Wally Show\" on WROR 105.7 FM in and around the time of Super Bowl XLIX, said shots use double the load of black powder than a regular historical reenactor does, specifically 200 grains, in order to be heard throughout the stadium. ESPN writer Josh Pahigian named this one of the top ten celebrations in the league in 2007.\nFans.\nThe team draws much of its fanbase from the New England region of the United States, as well as from the Canadian province of Quebec and much of Atlantic Canada.\nRadio and television.\nThe Patriots' flagship radio station is WBZ-FM (98.5 FM, otherwise known as \"The Sports Hub\"), owned by Beasley Broadcast Group. The larger radio network is called the New England Patriots Radio Network, whose 37 affiliate stations span seven states. Gil Santos and Gino Cappelletti were the longtime announcing team until their retirement following the conclusion of the 2012 NFL season. Santos was replaced by Bob Socci. Former Patriots QB Scott Zolak joined the radio team in the 2011 season as a sideline analyst, and in 2013, he replaced Cappelletti as color commentator.\nAny preseason games not on national television are shown on CBS's O&amp;O WBZ-TV, who also airs the bulk of Patriots regular-season games by virtue of CBS having the rights to most AFC games; CBS also has a presence at the nearby Patriot Place with the \"CBS Scene\" bar and restaurant. During the regular season whenever the Patriots host an NFC team, the games are aired on Fox affiliate WFXT-TV, and \"NBC Sunday Night Football\" games are carried by Boston NBC station WBTS-CD. Preseason games were broadcast on ABC affiliate WCVB-TV from 1995 until the change to WBZ in 2009 (WCVB continues to simulcast ESPN's \"Monday Night Football\" games featuring the Patriots). Don Criqui was play-by-play announcer for the 1995\u20132012 seasons, with Randy Cross as a color commentator and Mike Lynch as a sideline reporter. Lynch was replaced by WBZ reporter Steve Burton in 2009.\nNotes and references.\nExplanatory notes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\nrole=\"presentation\" class=\"wikitable succession-box noprint\" style=\"margin:0.5em auto; font-size:small;clear:both;\""}
{"id": "21720", "revid": "11555324", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21720", "title": "New Orleans Saints", "text": "National Football League franchise in New Orleans, Louisiana\nThe New Orleans Saints are a professional American football team based in New Orleans. The Saints compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member of the National Football Conference (NFC) South division. Since 1975, the team plays its home games at Caesars Superdome after using Tulane Stadium during its first eight seasons. Founded by John W. Mecom Jr., David Dixon, and the city of New Orleans on November 1, 1966, the Saints joined the NFL as an expansion team in 1967.\nThe Saints were among the NFL's least successful franchises in their first several decades, where they went 20 consecutive seasons without a winning record or qualifying for the playoffs. They earned their first winning record and postseason berth in 1987, while their first playoff win would not occur until 2000, the team's 34th season. The team's fortunes improved in the 21st century, especially during the late 2000s and 2010s, which saw them become more consistent postseason contenders. Their greatest success to date came in the 2009 season, when they won Super Bowl XLIV over the favored Indianapolis Colts, the team's first and only Super Bowl appearance so far. The Saints, along with the New York Jets, are one of two NFL franchises to win their sole Super Bowl appearance.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nLocal sports entrepreneur Dave Dixon and a local civic group had been seeking an NFL franchise for over five years and had hosted record crowds for NFL exhibition games. To seal the NFL\u2013AFL merger, NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle arrived in New Orleans within a week, and announced on November 1, 1966, that the NFL officially had awarded the city of New Orleans an expansion franchise. The team was named for \"When the Saints Go Marching In\", the classic jazz standard associated with New Orleans. When the deal was reached a week earlier, Dixon strongly suggested to Rozelle that the announcement be delayed until November 1, to coincide with All Saints' Day. Dixon cleared the name with New Orleans' Archbishop Philip M. Hannan, who \"thought it would be a good idea,\" according to Dixon. \"He had an idea the team was going to need all the help it could get.\"\nJohn Mecom Jr. era (1967\u20131984).\nU.S. House Majority Whip from Louisiana Hale Boggs attached the merger to a bill approving an exemption from antitrust sanctions allowing for the merger and the team. John W. Mecom Jr., a young oilman from Houston, became the team's first majority stockholder. The team's colors, black and gold, symbolized both Mecom's and New Orleans' strong ties to the oil industry. Trumpeter Al Hirt was part owner of the team.\nTom Fears was named as the team's first head coach. The inaugural game on September 17, 1967, started with Saints receiver John Gilliam returning the opening kickoff 94-yards for a touchdown, in a losing effort, 27\u201313, to the Los Angeles Rams at Tulane Stadium, with over 80,000 in attendance. It was one of the few highlights of a 3\u201311 season, which set an NFL record for most wins by an expansion team.\nFor most of their first 20 years, the Saints finished third or fourth in their division until 1979. Until 1987, the 1979 and 1983 teams were the only ones to finish at .500.\nOne of the franchise's early bright moments came on November 8, 1970, when Tom Dempsey kicked an NFL record-breaking 63-yard field goal at Tulane Stadium to defeat the Detroit Lions 19\u201317 in the final seconds of the game; the previous record was seven yards less, set in 1953. Dempsey's record was not broken until 2013 by Matt Prater of the Denver Broncos, who kicked one yard farther.\nIn 1980, the Saints lost their first 14 games, prompting local sportscaster Bernard \"Buddy D\" Diliberto to advise Saints supporters to wear paper bags over their heads at the team's home games; many bags rendered the club's name as the \"'Aints\" rather than the \"Saints.\"\nBenson era (1985\u2013present).\nJim E. Mora years (1986\u20131996).\nTom Benson, a successful automobile dealership owner and banker, acquired the franchise in 1985, and hired Jim Finks as general manager and Jim Mora as head coach. That combination provided the Saints with their first-ever winning record and playoff appearance, going 12\u20133 in 1987, which had one fewer game than normal due to a players' strike. Another playoff berth would follow during the 1990 season, and the club's first division title came in 1991. During Mora's tenure, the Saints made the playoffs four times, with teams marked by strong defenses led by the \"Dome Patrol\" linebacking corps, but they were never able to win a playoff game. Mora coached the Saints until the middle of the 1996 season, when he stepped down halfway through the 3\u201313 season. His 93 wins were three more than the Saints won in their entire history before his arrival, and would remain the most for any Saints coach until 2016.\nMike Ditka years (1997\u20131999).\nAfter the end of the 1996 season, ironically as Diliberto had suggested before Mora's resignation, former Chicago Bears coach Mike Ditka was hired to replace Mora. Although this initially generated a lot of excitement among Saints fans, Ditka's tenure ended up being a failure. The Saints went 6\u201310 in their first two seasons under Ditka (1997 and 1998). During the 1999 NFL draft, Ditka traded all of his picks for that season, as well as the first-round and third-round picks for the following season, to the Washington Redskins in order to draft University of Texas Heisman Trophy running back Ricky Williams in the first round. Ditka and Williams had a mock wedding picture taken to commemorate the occasion. However, Ditka, most of his coaching staff, and general manager Bill Kuharich were fired at the end of the 1999 season due to the club's 3\u201313 record.\nJim Haslett years (2000\u20132005).\nJim Haslett held the post from 2000 to 2005. In his first year, he took the team to the 2000 playoffs with a 10\u20136 mark and defeated the defending Super Bowl champion St. Louis Rams for the team's first-ever playoff win. The team lost the following week to the Minnesota Vikings. After winning the 2000 NFL Executive of the Year Award, General Manager Randy Mueller was fired between the 2001 and 2002 seasons without explanation by Benson. The Saints failed to make the playoffs in 2001 and 2002, although in the latter year they had the distinction of beating the eventual Super Bowl XXXVII champion Tampa Bay Buccaneers in both of their regular-season meetings, only the second team to do so in NFL history.\nIn 2003, the Saints again missed the playoffs after finishing 8\u20138. The 2004 season started poorly for the Saints, as they went 2\u20134 through their first six games and 4\u20138 through their first twelve games. At that point Haslett's job appeared to be in jeopardy; however, he managed to win the three straight games leading up to the season finale, leaving the Saints in playoff contention in the final week of the season. In week 17, the Saints defeated division rivals Carolina; however, the Saints needed other results to break their way and when the St. Louis Rams beat the New York Jets the Saints were eliminated despite having beaten the Rams, who finished with the same record. The Rams, Saints, and Vikings all were 8\u20138, with the Rams having a 7\u20135 conference record, Saints 6\u20136, and the Vikings 5\u20137. The Rams received the number 1 wild-card due to having the best conference record out of the three, followed by the Vikings due to the 38\u201331 loss handed to the Saints in Week 6. Haslett was fired after the 2005 season, in which the Saints finished 3\u201313 and played no regular-season games in New Orleans because of Hurricane Katrina.\nEffect of Hurricane Katrina.\nDue to the damage Hurricane Katrina caused to the Superdome and the New Orleans area, the Saints' scheduled 2005 home opener against the New York Giants was moved to Giants Stadium. The remainder of their 2005 home games were split between the Alamodome in San Antonio, Texas, and LSU's Tiger Stadium in Baton Rouge.\nSean Payton years (2006\u20132021).\nOn January 17, 2006, the Saints hired Sean Payton as their new head coach and, on March 14, signed former San Diego Chargers quarterback Drew Brees to a six-year, $60 million deal.\nOn March 23, the Saints announced that the team's two 2006 preseason games were to be played at Shreveport, Louisiana, and Jackson, Mississippi. After a $185 million renovation of the historic stadium, on April 6 the Saints released their 2006 schedule, with all home games scheduled to be played at the Superdome. On September 19, Saints owner Tom Benson announced that the team had sold out the Louisiana Superdome for the entire season with season tickets alone (68,354 seats), a first in franchise history.\nThe September 25 home opener, the first home game in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina, was won by the Saints 23\u20133 against the Atlanta Falcons, who were undefeated in the 2006 season at that time. The attendance for the game was a sellout crowd of 70,003. Meanwhile, the broadcast of the game was ESPN's highest-ever rated program to date, with an 11.8 rating, and viewership by 10.85 million homes. It was the most-watched program for the night, broadcast or cable, and was the second-highest rated cable program of all time at the time. Green Day and U2 performed \"Wake Me Up When September Ends\" and \"The Saints Are Coming\", respectively, before the game. The game received a 2007 ESPY award for \"Best Moment in Sports.\" The game is remembered by Saints fans for Steve Gleason's blocked punt on the opening series that resulted in a touchdown for New Orleans.\nOn December 17, the Saints clinched their third division title and their first NFC South title in franchise history. For the first time in Saints' history, they clinched their NFC South title on their home field. Sean Payton became the second consecutive Saints coach to win a division title in his first season. After the Philadelphia Eagles beat the Dallas Cowboys 23\u20137 on Christmas Day 2006, the Saints clinched a first-round playoff bye for the first time in franchise history, finishing the regular season with a record of 10\u20136.\nAfter the first-round bye, the Saints beat the Philadelphia Eagles 27\u201324 in the Superdome in the 2006 Divisional Playoffs. No team had ever had such a poor record in the prior year (3\u201313) and then gone on to a league or conference championship game since the 1999 St. Louis Rams who advanced to win their first Super Bowl after being 4\u201312 the season before. Since the Saints' only previous playoff win was in the wild card round, this was the farthest the Saints had ever advanced at the time. The victory was only the second playoff win in team history. The season ended on January 21, 2007, when the Saints lost a 39\u201314 blowout to the Chicago Bears in the NFC Championship game.\nThe Saints announced that for the second year in a row, the Louisiana Superdome had sold out every ticket for the season.\nThe first game of the season was against the defending Super Bowl XLI champion Indianapolis Colts. The Saints lost this game, 41\u201310, and lost their next three games. In one of these three games, against the Tennessee Titans, the Saints lost running back Deuce McAllister for the season with his second career (second time in three seasons) ACL tear. After winning their first game, against the Seattle Seahawks, two weeks later, the team went on a four-game winning streak to bring their record to an even 4\u20134. After reaching 7\u20137, the Saints lost their final two games to finish 7\u20139.\nFollowing a disappointing 7\u20139 record in the 2007 season, the Saints ended the 2008 season 8\u20138. Failing to qualify for the post-season for the second straight year, the Saints found themselves struggling on defense. However, the Saints would match the explosive offense they had in the 2006 season. Drew Brees ended the 2008 season just 16 yards short of beating Dan Marino's single-season record of 5084 total passing yards, and receiver Lance Moore came 72 yards short of his first 1,000-yard season.\nSuper Bowl XLIV champions (2009).\nThe 2009 season was the team's most successful season, which culminated in the franchise's first league championship win against the Indianapolis Colts in Super Bowl XLIV. After achieving a record of 13\u20130 with their win over the Atlanta Falcons, it marked the Saints' best start to a season in its franchise history. The result clinched an NFC playoff berth and a bye in the first round of the playoffs. By winning their first 13 games, the Saints also set the record for the longest undefeated season opening (13\u20130) by an NFC team since the AFL\u2013NFL merger, surpassing the previous record (12\u20130) held by the 1985 Chicago Bears. However, they would fall victim to the Dallas Cowboys in week 14, going on to end the season with a three-game losing streak. The Saints became the first team to win a Super Bowl after losing its last three regular-season games.\nAlthough its opponents would include winners of 9 of the last 15 NFL MVP awards, the team advanced to the 2009 NFC Championship game where they defeated the Minnesota Vikings, led by Brett Favre, 31\u201328 in overtime, advancing to their first Super Bowl appearance in franchise history. Television ratings for Super Bowl XLIV (44) were the second highest for any TV program, sports or otherwise, in history, as their successful bid to win the Super Bowl was seen by many to represent the city's resurgence after the devastating Hurricane Katrina.\nThe Saints' 2010 season began in the Superdome as the defending Super Bowl champions defeated the Minnesota Vikings 14\u20139, in a rematch of the 2009 NFC Championship Game. It was played on Thursday, September 9, 2010, and televised on NBC, making it the first time the Saints have opened the NFL's season at home. On Sunday, August 8, 2010, NBC announced the televised opening festivities of the evening would begin with Taylor Swift and Dave Matthews Band. On December 27, 2010, with a 17\u201314 win against the Atlanta Falcons in Atlanta, the Saints clinched a playoff appearance (wild card). This marked the first time a team in the NFC South had made back-to-back playoff appearances since the division was formed in 2002. The Saints would face the Seattle Seahawks for the wild-card opener at Qwest Field. The Seahawks were the first NFL team to capture their division with a sub-.500 regular-season record (7\u20139). Drew Brees completed a postseason-record 39 passes for 404 yards and two touchdowns. Despite throwing 60 passes and hindered by a lack of depth at running back, last year's Super Bowl MVP was not intercepted and rallied the Saints within 34\u201330 in the fourth quarter. In the end, his efforts were negated by a defense that could not get enough stops and a late touchdown run by Marshawn Lynch breaking over a half-dozen tackles with 3:22 left which helped the Seahawks defeat the Saints 41\u201336.\nThe Saints began their season with a loss against the Green Bay Packers, but the team rebounded for the next four weeks to bring their record to 4\u20131. A loss to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers brought the record to 4\u20132, but the team bounced back with a 62\u20137 blowout win against the struggling Indianapolis Colts. A surprise loss to the St. Louis Rams resulted in the record dropping to 5\u20133. In the next seven weeks the Saints beat talented teams such as the eventual Super Bowl XLVI champion New York Giants, Detroit Lions, and Atlanta Falcons, bringing their season record to 12\u20133. To cap off the season, quarterback Drew Brees broke the single-season passing record held for over 25 years, on the way to a Saints division-winning game. The Saints won the NFC South title on December 26 and ended the 2011 season as the third seed in the NFC. They finished with a 13\u20133 record, beating Carolina 45\u201317 and also giving running back Darren Sproles the record for most all-purpose yards in a single season. The team broke numerous records that year including most yards in a season, completion percentage, yards passing, completions and more. The New Orleans Saints beat the Detroit Lions in the 2011 NFC wild-card playoff game 45\u201328. New Orleans also tied the NFL's postseason mark for team first downs in a game (34), and broke the record for total yards with 626, eclipsing the yardage record set 49 years ago. The Saints lost in the Divisional round in the playoffs against the San Francisco 49ers in Candlestick Park that featured the Saints losing two leads in the last four minutes of regulation.\nAfter an off-season dominated by the bounty scandal and the year-long suspension of head coach Sean Payton, the Saints sought to refocus on football and produce yet another winning year. Instead, the team, led by offensive line coach Aaron Kromer for its first six games, started the season with four straight losses and a last-place spot in the NFC South. The team finally broke through with a win in Week 5, against the San Diego Chargers, a game that also saw quarterback Drew Brees break Johnny Unitas's longstanding record for consecutive games with a touchdown pass. After their bye week, the Saints went on to win 4 of their next 5 games, to bring their record to an even 5\u20135. Joe Vitt returned after his six-game suspension to serve as interim head coach for the rest of the season. The team failed to hold its momentum however, and lost the next three games, including a loss at Atlanta that also marked the end of Brees' record touchdown streak after 54 games, and a 52\u201327 blowout loss to the Giants that dropped the Saints to 5\u20138. Despite winning 2 of their last 3 games, and Brees again leading the league with 5,177 passing yards (his third time to surpass 5,000 yards, as he remained the only quarterback to break that barrier more than once), the team finished third in the NFC South, at 7\u20139. The Saints defense allowed 7,042 yards, setting an NFL record.\nThe Saints finished their 2013 preseason 3\u20131, and won their first five regular-season games against the Atlanta Falcons, Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Arizona Cardinals, Miami Dolphins and Chicago Bears. The Saints under Sean Peyton had been winless in Chicago's Soldier Field and had not won in the Windy City since 2000. The Saints fared well against Chicago, Arizona and Miami, winning 26\u201318, 31\u20137 and 38\u201317 respectively, but needed a 4th down shutdown and a last-minute field goal to escape Atlanta and Tampa Bay. The Saints went on a 5\u20130 win streak, but were stopped short by the New England Patriots in Week 6, losing 30\u201327, with a touchdown pass by Tom Brady in the last 5 seconds of the game. New Orleans would go undefeated at home for the second straight season with Sean Payton as the head coach, but finish just 3\u20135 on the road. Key losses included a 7\u201334 blowout against the Seattle Seahawks on Monday Night Football in Seattle which cost them homefield advantage throughout the playoffs, a 16\u201327 upset against the St. Louis Rams in St. Louis which led to the Saints needing to win their next game against Carolina to control their own playoff destiny, and a heartbreaking 13\u201317 defeat to their division rival the Carolina Panthers in Charlotte who went on to win the NFC South. The Saints finished the season with an 11\u20135 record and earned a wild card berth as the sixth seed in the NFC. On January 4, 2014, the Saints recorded their first road playoff win in franchise history over the Philadelphia Eagles 26\u201324. On January 11, the Saints lost to the first seed, the Seattle Seahawks, once again in Seattle 15\u201323. The weather conditions were very poor, which gave the offense much difficulty. Despite the conditions, the defense of the Saints played well, holding Seattle to just 23 over the 34 points allowed against Seattle during the regular season.\nThe Saints finished the season 7\u20139, second in their division behind the 7\u20138\u20131 Carolina Panthers. They missed out on the playoffs after being defeated 14\u201330 by their divisional rival, the Atlanta Falcons, in the second-to-last week of the season. This season was notorious in Saints history for having the 31st worst-ranked defense in the league, which is one of the main reasons for the Saints' poor 2014 campaign. The only two great performances by the defense out of the entire season came from a 44\u201323 home win against the Green Bay Packers and a 31\u201315 victory against the Chicago Bears in Chicago.\nThe Saints finished with a 7\u20139 record for the second consecutive season. They were third in the NFC South after the 15\u20131 NFC champions Carolina Panthers and the 8\u20138 Atlanta Falcons. Their defense was historically bad. They allowed the most passing touchdowns in a season in NFL history as they allowed 45, effectively making them the worst passing defense in NFL history. They also set the NFL record in opposing passer rating (116.2), while finishing last in points allowed (29.8) and yards allowed per play (6.6). Atrocious play by defensive captain Brandon Browner, who set the NFL record for most penalties with 23, did not help the struggling Saints defense. Defensive coordinator Rob Ryan was fired near the half-way point in the season and was replaced by senior defensive assistant Dennis Allen. The Saints had strong play from their 2015 draft class. The Saints' first pick Andrus Peat started at right tackle and left guard at certain points in the season, and other first-round pick Stephone Anthony finished his rookie season with 112 tackles, one sack, one interception, and two forced fumbles. He had two scores, both coming against the Carolina Panthers and led all rookies in tackles. Second-round pick Hau'oli Kikaha had 4 sacks. Canadian football star Delvin Breaux, who was signed in the off-season, led the Saints struggling secondary with 3 interceptions and 19 pass deflections. Drew Brees also tied the NFL record for touchdown passes in a game with 7, coming against the New York Giants.\nThe Saints finished with a 7\u20139 record for the third consecutive season, their offense finished first in the NFL in yards per game (426.0), second in points per game (29.3), and third in yards per play (6.2). Brees led the NFL in passing yards with 5,208. However the defense yet again struggled mightily, as they were allowed the 2nd most points per game (28.4) and 6th most yards per game (375.4) while being tied for 2nd worst in yards per play allowed (6.0).\nDespite an 0\u20132 start to the season, the Saints proceeded to win their next 8 games en route to an 11\u20135 finish, winning their first NFC South title since 2011. The Saints' turnaround was largely attributable to their draft, where they drafted cornerback Marshon Lattimore, offensive tackle Ryan Ramczyk, safety Marcus Williams, and running back Alvin Kamara. It is widely considered one of the best draft classes in NFL history. The defense drastically improved, as they allowed just 20.4 points per game while finishing third in the league with 20 interceptions. The offense continued to be excellent, finishing second in yards per game (391.2) and fourth in points per game (28.0).\nIn the wild card round, the Saints defeated the Carolina Panthers in the wild-card round, 31\u201326. However, in the divisional round, the Saints lost 29\u201324 to the Minnesota Vikings after the Vikings completed the Minneapolis Miracle. The Minneapolis Miracle was a stunning finish in which Vikings quarterback Case Keenum completed a pass towards the sideline to Stefon Diggs, then Marcus Williams missed a tackle and Diggs was able to run to the end zone for a 61-yard touchdown with no time left on the clock.\nOn March 15, 2018, the Saints' owner Tom Benson died from flu at the age of 90 after he was hospitalized on February 16, 2018. Benson's wife Gayle Benson succeeded him as the owner of the Saints and the NBA's New Orleans Pelicans.\nIn the 2018 season, the Saints finished with a 13\u20133 record and won the NFC South. The Saints defeated the Philadelphia Eagles 20\u201314 in the Divisional Round. The Saints fell to the Los Angeles Rams 26\u201323 in overtime in the NFC Championship in a game that had a controversial ending to regulation.\nIn the 2019 season, the Saints finished with a 13\u20133 record and won the NFC South. The Saints lost 26\u201320 in overtime to the Minnesota Vikings in the Wild Card Round.\nIn the 2020 season, the Saints won the NFC South with a 12\u20134 record. In the Wild Card Round, they defeated the Chicago Bears 21\u20139. In the Divisional Round, they fell to their NFC South rivals, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, 30\u201320. The loss was Drew Brees's final game.\nFollowing Drew Brees's retirement, the Saints had a revolving door at quarterback in the 2021 season with Trevor Siemian, Jameis Winston, Taysom Hill, and Ian Book starting over the course of the year. In the 2021 season, the Saints finished 9\u20138 and missed the postseason.\nOn January 25, 2022, Sean Payton announced to the team that he was stepping away as head coach after 15 seasons with the team. During his tenure as head coach, the Saints went 152\u201389 in the regular season and 9\u20138 in the postseason.\nDennis Allen years (2022\u20132024).\nThe team promoted defensive coordinator, Dennis Allen to head coach on February 8, 2022.\nOn November 14, 2022, after a 3\u20137 start, disappointed Saints fans started a petition on change.org, asking to relieve Dennis Allen of his duties. The Saints finished the 2022 season with a 7\u201310 mark and missed the postseason. Allen would maintain his head coaching position into the start of the 2023 season.\nDuring the 2023 season, The Saints brought in a new quarterback in Derek Carr hoping that he would solidify the position. Dennis Allen and the Saints had one of the easiest schedules in the league, but finished with a 9\u20138 record missing the playoffs after a 3rd straight season.\nDennis Allen was fired on November 4, 2024, following a 23\u201322 loss to division rivals Carolina Panthers and a 2\u20137 start.\nLogos and uniforms.\nBlack, along with old gold and white, has always been one of the team colors, but it was not the first choice of original majority owner John W. Mecom Jr. His preference was for Mecom blue, a medium shade which was used by all of his other investments. The NFL office, however, informed him that his proposed combination too closely resembled that worn by the San Diego Chargers. Although the Chargers were members of the AFL, the older league did not want to offend its soon-to-be partner so soon after the merger. Mecom settled on black as the primary color as a nod to his financial involvement in the petroleum industry. \"Black gold\" is a term synonymous with oil. Although the Pittsburgh Steelers\u2014who played a few home games in New Orleans during their early years to avoid conflict with the Pittsburgh Panthers football team\u2014have long used black and gold as their colors, their shade of gold more closely resembles yellow, making the Saints black and gold compatible with the rest of the NFL.\nExcept for minor modifications, the Saints' logo and uniforms have basically remained the same since the club debuted in 1967. The team's logo is a fleur-de-lis (a symbol of the City of New Orleans and of France's Royal Family, which included the House of Bourbon), while its uniform design consists of gold helmets, gold pants, and either black or white jerseys. Minor changes to the uniform stripes and trim have been made throughout the years. The team wore black helmets during the 1969 preseason, but NFL commissioner Pete Rozelle barred the Saints from using the helmets during the regular season, since Mecom did not notify the league office of the change. Black helmets were not introduced until 2022, after the NFL repealed its \"one-helmet rule\" previously enforced in 2013.\nThe Saints predominantly wore white at home when the club played at Tulane Stadium from 1967 through 1974 (except in 1969 and 1970), forcing opponents to suffer in their darker jerseys in the subtropical climate of New Orleans. When the surface at Tulane Stadium switched from natural grass to PolyTurf in 1971, field temperatures became hotter still. In Archie Manning's first game, in the 1971 season opener against the Los Angeles Rams, temperatures on the field reached as high as . The heavily favored Rams wilted in the stifling heat, and the Saints claimed their first-ever victory over their NFC West rivals, 24\u201320, on Manning's one-yard quarterback sneak on the last play of the game.\nThe Saints switched to white pants in 1975, coinciding with the team's move from Tulane Stadium to the Superdome, and have worn white at home numerous times since then. One year later, they started to wear black pants with their white jerseys, a move influenced by coach Hank Stram, who introduced red pants to the Kansas City Chiefs' uniforms in 1968. In an October 3, 1976, home game against the Houston Oilers, Hank Stram used the Saints' road uniforms, the white jerseys and black pants. The Saints lost that game 31\u201326. During the 1981\u201382 seasons (Bum Phillips' first two seasons as coach), the team wore white jerseys with black pants at home, but reverted to the black jerseys and white pants for 1983. They reverted to wearing gold pants with both their black and white jerseys in 1986 under new coach Jim E. Mora. From 1986 through 1995, the sleeves of the jerseys and sides of the pants featured a logo with a fleur-de-lis inside an outline of the state of Louisiana (with the location of New Orleans marked with a star in the state outline). The logo replaced the striping pattern that had been on the uniforms since the team's inception; save for color variations, the striping pattern was similar to that used by the Washington Redskins (until 1979), Green Bay Packers (until 1997), and Cleveland Browns (until 2014), which is likely why the change was made. That logo was removed in 1996 and replaced with a fleur-de-lis on both the sleeves and sides of the pants.\nFrom 1996 through 1998, the Saints returned to gold numbers on both the white and black jerseys, but complaints about the numbers on the white jerseys being too difficult to read forced the numbers on the white jerseys to be changed to black in 1999. The Saints wore black pants with a wide gold stripe with their white jerseys in 1999, but following a 3\u201313 season and the dismissal of coach Mike Ditka, the black pants were mothballed by new coach Jim Haslett.\n2000s.\nIn 2000, the Saints won their first playoff game as they hosted the St. Louis Rams, and after having a better road record than home record, they wore their white jerseys, and won 31\u201328 over the defending champion Rams. The defining play of the game came with the Saints clinging to a three-point lead with minutes to play. The Saints punted to the Rams' Az-Zahir Hakim (who would play one season for the Saints in 2005), who fumbled the punt deep in Rams' territory. Brian Milne recovered for the Saints, who then ran out the clock to preserve the victory.\nIn 2001, they wore their white jerseys in the first six home games. During that same year, they primarily wore black pants with both their white and black jerseys. They became the first NFL team to wear all-black uniforms in a Week 5 road game against the Carolina Panthers, and again in weeks 16 and 17 in home games against the Washington Redskins and San Francisco 49ers; the Saints were outscored 78\u201310 in the final two contests to end a 7\u20139 campaign.\nIn 2002, the Saints wore black pants with their white jerseys (except for the final road game, a 20\u201313 loss in Cincinnati when they went back to the gold pants), and gold pants with their black jerseys, a gold alternate jersey, and a 1967-style throwback uniform, complete with an accurate 1967-era helmet which featured a larger fleur-de-lis, a darker shade of gold and grey facemasks. But one season later, they stopped using the alternates and again reverted to wearing gold pants with both their black and white jerseys.\nThe team introduced a gold alternate jersey (worn with the black pants) during a December 15, 2002, game versus the Minnesota Vikings, a 32\u201331 loss, but have never worn them since then. Because of the metallic gold's bright color, the gold jerseys were considered the \"light\" jersey in the game, so the Vikings wore their purple home jerseys as the \"dark\" colored team. One team must wear \"dark\" and one team must wear \"light\", this was done because of black &amp; white t.v. broadcasts so viewers could tell the teams apart. The only exception being if both teams are wearing throwback uniforms, such as Thanksgiving Classic games. From 2003 through 2007, the New England Patriots had a \"light\" jersey (their alternate, a bright metallic silver) that is not white in which the other team would wear their colored, or \"dark\" jerseys against them since the third jersey rule was implemented in the NFL in 2002.\nThe Saints also introduced a 1967-style throwback uniform in a 23\u201320 win on December 1, 2002, against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. This uniform was not worn again until a 40\u201333 win against the Houston Texans on September 25, 2011, and also on November 6, 2011, against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in a 27\u201316 Saints win. However, the 2011 throwbacks use the current helmet, meaning the shades of gold on the helmet and jersey do not match. This uniform was brought back on December 4, 2016, a 28\u201313 loss to the Detroit Lions, in commemoration of the franchise's 50th season. It was then shelved for five seasons before returning on November 21, 2022, against the Los Angeles Rams.\nIn 2006, to honor their return to Louisiana, the Saints wore a patch on their uniforms with an outline of the State of Louisiana with a fleur-de-lis superimposed, similar to the logo from the 1980s.\nThe Saints originally planned to wear white jerseys at home for the 2006 season, but during the season, the players voted to wear the black jerseys at home after the second game. Since the team had informed the NFL office that they planned to wear white jerseys at home, each of the Saints' remaining home opponents would have to agree to New Orleans' request. The Atlanta Falcons, Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Cincinnati Bengals did not agree to the switch, forcing the Saints to wear white jerseys for those games.\nStarting in week 13 of the 2006 season, the Saints wore black pants with the black jerseys against the San Francisco 49ers (restoring them after a four-season absence), and in a Week 16 game in The Meadowlands against the New York Giants (a 30\u20137 Saints win), the Saints wore the black pants with their road white jerseys. The Saints later stuck with the black pants in their 2006 playoff run.\nSince 2006, the Saints have worn white jerseys at home for most preseason games and early regular-season home games, with the exception of the 2007 and 2017 seasons.\nIn 2009, the Saints wore the black pants only once, beating St. Louis 28\u201323. They wore the white jerseys/gold pants combination during the Super Bowl XLIV victory over the Indianapolis Colts. In 2012 and 2014, the Saints wore black pants 12 times and wore gold pants 4 times. In 2013, gold pants were used only 7 times (including playoffs). After 2015, a season in which the gold pants were donned 10 times, the Saints only wore them sporadically in the regular season, though they were still used regularly in the preseason.\nBefore the 2016 season, the NFL introduced the Color Rush program, and the Saints' version is a mixture of uniform designs from earlier eras. White jersey tops had old gold numbers with black trim along with gold and black sleeve stripes (a nod to the team's late 1960s uniforms). Complementing the uniforms were white pants (inspired from the 1975\u201385 look) and all-white socks. The Saints first wore the uniform during Week 11 of that season against the Carolina Panthers on the road, and was worn on the road two more times thereafter. Its first home appearance came in Week 11 of the 2018 season against the Philadelphia Eagles; the Saints were forced to wear the white uniforms at home after head coach Sean Payton lost a bet with Eagles coach Doug Pederson during a charity golf event in the offseason.\nIn 2019, a variation of the all-white Color Rush look was unveiled during the Week 6 game against the Jacksonville Jaguars. The Saints wore their current white uniforms, but paired them with white pants minus any striping (an inverse of their black pants). During the regular season, New Orleans went undefeated (8\u20130) while wearing either all-white uniform. As a result, they opted to wear the new all-white look at home during the against the Minnesota Vikings. However, the Saints' luck finally ran out, losing in overtime 26\u201320. On December 24, 2022, the Saints wore another variation of the all-white uniform, this time wearing black socks at the Cleveland Browns. The plain white pants were then paired with the black uniform on January 8, 2023, against the Carolina Panthers, a look last seen in the 1985 season.\nIn 2022, the Saints unveiled an alternate black helmet, featuring a gold fleur-de-lis on each side and a triangle pattern of tiny gold fleur-de-lis logos. The helmets are worn with the Color Rush uniforms. The black helmets made its official regular season debut in an NFL London Game at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium against the Minnesota Vikings on October 2, 2022.\nIn 2025, after the NFL allowed teams to add a second alternate helmet, the Saints unveiled a white helmet, featuring a gold facemask, a thick gold middle stripe with fleur-de-lis silhouettes, two thin black stripes, and the gold fleur-de-lis on each side. This helmet would be worn with the all-white Color Rush uniform, replacing the previous black alternate helmet. The black helmets were then paired with a new \"Gameday Gold\" alternate uniform, which was similar to their previous gold alternate they last wore in 2002, with the exception of black sleeve cuffs replacing the gold cuffs. Black pants and socks were paired with this uniform.\nStadium.\nCaesars Superdome is the Saints' home stadium. It has a listed seating capacity of 76,468 (expanded) or 73,208 (not expanded). The Saints own a perfect record there against the Houston Texans (3\u20130), but a winless one against the Baltimore Ravens (0\u20133).\nRivalries.\nDivisional.\nAtlanta Falcons.\nThe Saints' oldest rival are the Atlanta Falcons, both teams were the original two NFL franchises along the southern coast of the United States in the late 1960s. Originally both teams were created as part of the NFC West until the league's realignment in 2002. The frequent divisional matchups and constant tensions between the two teams has fueled a long-standing rivalry between both cities.As of the 2025 Season, the Falcons lead the rivalry with a record of 58-57, giving Atlanta a slight edge in the conflict. The teams have faced once in the postseason, in which the Falcons defeated the Saints 27-20 in the 1991 NFC Wild Card game. The two clubs joined the NFL within a year of each other as expansion teams and have played each other twice a season since the Saints joined the league in 1967.\nTampa Bay Buccaneers.\nEver since the early 2000s, the Saints have had a developing rivalry with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, who have been part of the NFC South with the Saints since 2002, and the Saints lead the overall series, 40\u201325.\nThe teams actually played each other quite often as non-division rivals. Between 1977 and 2001, there were only five years in which the teams did not play. This includes 12 years in a row from 1981 to 1992 \u2013 all as a result of the scheduling formulas in place before 2002 (this remains a record for most consecutive years in which two teams not from the same division met each other).\nThe Saints won 13 of 20 games as non-division opponents. Since becoming division rivals, the Saints have the edge in the series, winning 16 games to the Bucs' 10.\nOne notable pre-division game is a 1977 matchup that resulted in Tampa Bay's first win in franchise history coming against New Orleans after previously starting out 0\u201326 overall.\nOn January 17, 2021, the two teams faced off in the playoffs for the first time in their rivalry history with Tampa Bay winning 30\u201320, despite New Orleans beating Tampa Bay in both regular season meetings.\nCarolina Panthers.\nThe Saints and the Carolina Panthers have been division rivals since Carolina joined the league as an expansion franchise in 1995, first in the NFC West and then in the NFC South since 2002.\nCarolina defeated New Orleans on the road every year from 2002 to 2008, a streak of seven seasons. Notable games include Carolina's 19\u20137 home victory in 1996 that sparked Saints head coach Jim Mora's infamous \"Diddley Poo\" rant and resignation from the team, Carolina's 10\u20136 win in the 2002 season finale at the Superdome to knock the Saints out of the playoffs, and the emotional 2005 season opener at Carolina where the Saints won 23\u201320 in the face of Hurricane Katrina and an eventual 3\u201313 season.\nIn their last game in the 2014 NFL season, a fight between players broke out in the end zone and spilled out into the tunnel entrance after a Cam Newton touchdown, with Panther's tight end Brandon Williams getting ejected and both teams receiving offsetting penalties. The Panthers won the contest 41\u201310, with early turnovers by the Saints being a factor in the blowout.\nOn January 7, 2018, the two teams met in the NFL playoffs for the first time in the wild-card round. It was the first playoff game between NFC South teams since the division's formation in 2002. The Saints beat the Panthers 31\u201326, thus eliminating Carolina. As of the 2023 season, the Saints lead the all-time series 31\u201328.\nConference.\nMinnesota Vikings.\nThe Saints have developed a strong postseason rivalry with the Minnesota Vikings as they have met in many consequential regular-season and playoff games, including the historic Minneapolis Miracle. As of the 2024 season, the Vikings lead the overall series 25\u201313 with a 4\u20131 record in the playoffs.\nLos Angeles Rams.\nThe Saints and the Los Angeles Rams once shared a fierce divisional rivalry as the Saints played in the NFC West until the league's realignment in 2002. Animosity resurged between the two teams during the 2010s after the Rams had lured Saints' controversial defensive coordinator Gregg Williams in 2012, shortly before Williams and Saints' head coach Sean Payton would be implicated in the infamous Bountygate Scandal. Both teams had thrown insults towards one another in the media, most notably during the controversial 2018 NFC Championship Game, in which a critical pass to Saints' receiver Tommylee Lewis was illegally broken up by Rams' cornerback Nickell Robey-Coleman, though no flag was thrown, enraging the Saints for the blown call. Saints' receiver Michael Thomas expressed his anger towards the Rams and in regards to the no-call to the media following the game. As of the 2024 season, the teams are tied 1\u20131 in the postseason, but the Rams lead the all-time series 45\u201335.\nStatistics.\nOverall records.\nThe New Orleans Saints have competed in 58 NFL seasons, dating back to 1967. The team has compiled a 417\u2013480\u20135 () regular-season record and a 10\u201313 () record in the playoffs, for an overall record of 427\u2013493\u20135 and a winning percentage.\nRecord vs. opponents.\n\"Note: W = Wins, L = Losses, T = Ties\"\nNotable players.\nPro Football Hall of Famers.\nUntil the selection of Rickey Jackson in 2010, there had been no players in the Hall of Fame who earned their credentials primarily as Saints; the others were chosen for their work with previous teams. Jim Finks\u2019 tenure as Saints general manager was a significant factor in his selection.\nWhen offensive tackle Willie Roaf was selected in 2012, he became the second Saint to earn his Hall of Fame credentials mostly while in New Orleans. Roaf was a member of the NFL's All-Decade team of the '90s. Morten Andersen was selected in 2017, becoming the third former player inducted primarily for their accomplishments in New Orleans. Andersen was only the second full-time placekicker inducted into the Hall of Fame (the other was Jan Stenerud in 1991). Sam Mills in 2022 became the 4th former player inducted primarily for his accomplishments in New Orleans.\nPro Bowl players.\nThe following Saints players have been named to at least one Pro Bowl:\nTwo Saints head coaches have participated in the Pro Bowl, Tom Fears in 1970 (1969 season) and Sean Payton in 2007 (2006 season) and 2018 (2017 season).\nRing of Honor.\nOn October 9, 2013, the Saints announced the creation of a Ring of Honor to commemorate former players, administrators and individuals with significant contributions to the franchise. Their names are displayed along the Caesars Superdome's Terrace Level fascia. The first three honorees were Archie Manning, Rickey Jackson and Willie Roaf and were officially inducted during halftime of the Saints' game against the Dallas Cowboys on November 10, 2013.\n45th Anniversary Team.\nTo commemorate the club's 45th anniversary, the New Orleans Saints Hall of Fame selected its All-45th Anniversary Team. The Hall of Fame updates its all-time team every five years, and this latest squad of head coach and players features four standouts from the club's roster at the time of selection: QB Drew Brees, G Jahri Evans, and DE Will Smith as well as head coach Sean Payton. Bold indicates those elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame.\nThe players are chosen in a vote by the Hall of Fame media selection committee, which includes local and regional media members who cover the Saints now or did so in the past. The All-45th Anniversary Team is as follows, with an asterisk (*) designating those players who have already been inducted into the Hall of Fame:\nOffense\nSpecialists\nDefense\nCoach\nNew Orleans Saints Hall of Fame.\n1 2005 induction ceremonies postponed to October 27, 2006, due to Hurricane Katrina\nJoe Gemelli Fleur-De-Lis Award.\nThe \"Joe Gemelli Fleur-De-Lis Award\" is given yearly to a person who has contributed to the betterment of the New Orleans Saints organization. The award is named for Joe Gemelli, a New Orleans clothing store owner and an active supporter of sports in the city, who was known as the team's biggest fan.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nCheerleaders.\nThe Saints Cheer Krewe (formerly Saintsations) are the cheerleading squad for the Saints. A cheerleading squad has existed since the franchise's founding. The squad was formerly known as the Saintsations from 1987 to 2021. The current name was adopted in 2021.\nRadio and television.\nThe Saints' flagship station is WWL (870 AM/105.3 FM), one of the oldest radio stations in the city of New Orleans and one of the nation's most powerful as a clear-channel station with 50,000 watts of power. Longtime WWL-TV reporter and anchor Mike Hoss is the play-by-play announcer, with former Saints running back Deuce McAllister as color commentator. Hoss succeeded former Saints guard Zach Strief when Strief was named to the Saints' coaching staff in the spring of 2021.\nStrief succeeded longtime play-by-play announcer Jim Henderson in 2018, and McAllister succeeded another former Saints running back, Hokie Gajan, in the role after Gajan's death on April 11, 2016, from liposarcoma. Henderson was the play-by-play announcer for Saints radio broadcasts continuously from 1993 to 2017, and previously held the position from 1986 to 1989 after serving as a color commentator from 1981 to 1985, and again in 1992, when Dave Garrett was play-by-play announcer. Previous color commentators include former Saints players Jim Taylor (RB, 1967), Steve Stonebreaker (LB, 1967\u201368), Danny Abramowicz (WR, 1967\u201373), Archie Manning (QB, 1971\u201382) and Stan Brock (OT, 1980\u201391).\nMost preseason games are televised by WVUE (Channel 8), a station which until its outright 2017 sale to Raycom Media (and subsequent sale in 2019 to Gray Television) was owned by a consortium led by Saints owner Tom Benson since mid-2008 (that consortium, now led by Gayle Benson, continues to hold a minority stake in the station). As the Fox affiliate for New Orleans, it carries the majority of Saints games; WVUE also carries a heavy complement of coach and player shows. Tim Brando and Jon Stinchcomb call the preseason games for the Saints.\nSaints preseason games were previously produced by Cox Sports Television. Beginning in the 2015 season, owing to Raycom's management of the station on behalf of Tom Benson's ownership group, production of preseason telecasts were taken over by Raycom Sports under a new multi-year deal, and syndicated to Raycom stations and others around the team's footprint. Regular season games are also aired on WWL-TV, the local CBS station whenever they host an AFC opponent (and games vs. NFC opponents cross-flexed from Fox to CBS) and NBC affiliate WDSU via \"Sunday Night Football\", with the latter also syndicating \"Monday Night Football\" games for local airing from sister operation ESPN.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\nrole=\"presentation\" class=\"wikitable succession-box noprint\" style=\"margin:0.5em auto; font-size:small;clear:both;\""}
{"id": "21721", "revid": "15763484", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21721", "title": "New York Jets", "text": "National Football League franchise in East Rutherford, New Jersey\nThe New York Jets are a professional American football team based in the New York metropolitan area. The Jets compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member of the American Football Conference (AFC) East division. The team plays its home games at MetLife Stadium (which it shares with the New York Giants) at the Meadowlands Sports Complex in East Rutherford, New Jersey, west of New York City. The team is headquartered in Florham Park, New Jersey. The franchise is legally organized as a limited liability company under the name New York Jets, LLC.\nThe team was founded in 1959 as the Titans of New York, a charter member of the American Football League (AFL); the franchise joined the NFL in the AFL\u2013NFL merger in 1970. The team began play in 1960 at the Polo Grounds in upper Manhattan, the former home of the football and baseball Giants. Under new ownership, the current name was adopted in 1963 and the franchise moved to Shea Stadium in Queens in 1964, then to the Meadowlands Sports Complex in New Jersey in 1984. The team's training facility was located at Hofstra University on Long Island until 2008, when the Atlantic Health Jets Training Center opened in Florham Park.\nThe Jets advanced to the AFL playoffs for the first time in 1968 and went on to compete in Super Bowl III where they defeated the Baltimore Colts, becoming the first AFL team to defeat an NFL club in an AFL\u2013NFL World Championship Game. However, the Jets have never returned to the Super Bowl, making them one of two NFL teams to win their lone Super Bowl appearance along with the New Orleans Saints, and one of five teams never to win a conference championship since the AFL\u2013NFL merger in 1970, along with the Cleveland Browns, Detroit Lions, and two expansion franchises, the Jacksonville Jaguars (who began play in 1995) and Houston Texans (2002). Since 1970 the Jets have won the AFC East only twice, in 1998 and 2002, the fewest division titles among NFL teams in the post-merger era. They have qualified for the postseason 12 times, and reached the AFC Championship Game four times, most recently losing to the Pittsburgh Steelers in 2010. The Jets have not qualified for the playoffs since then, and currently hold the longest active playoff drought in the NFL and are tied with the Buffalo Sabres of the National Hockey League for the longest drought in the \"Big 4\" North American sports leagues. The Jets also have the longest championship drought among New York's major professional sports franchises, having eclipsed the New York Rangers' 54-year drought (from 1940 to 1994) in 2023.\nThe Jets' team colors are green and white, although they have at times used black as a third/trim color and have had a black alternate uniform since 2019. For most of their history the Jets had white helmets with green stripes and oval or football-shaped logos, and opposite-colored jersey sleeves; the current primary uniforms are based on the design used from 1978 to 1989 with simpler striping, green helmets, and a wordmark logo in stylized italic lettering with a jet-plane silhouette above the letters.\nHistory.\nThe first organizational meeting of the American Football League took place on August 14, 1959. Harry Wismer, representing the city of New York at the meeting, proclaimed the state was ready for another professional football team and that he was more than capable of running the daily operations.\nWismer was granted the charter franchise later dubbed the Titans of New York as Wismer explained, \"Titans are bigger and stronger than Giants.\" He secured the Titans' home field at the decrepit Polo Grounds, a place where the team struggled financially and on the field during its first three years. In their first two seasons of existence, coached by Sammy Baugh, the Titans went 7\u20137 in both 1960 and 1961. By 1962, the debt continued to mount for Wismer, forcing the AFL to assume the costs of the team until season's end.\nA five-man syndicate, headed by Sonny Werblin, saved the team from certain bankruptcy, purchasing the lowly Titans for $1\u00a0million in 1963. Werblin renamed the team the New York Jets since the team would play near LaGuardia Airport and because it rhymed with the New York Mets as they would be playing in Shea Stadium. The new name was intended to reflect the modern approach of his team. The Jets' owners hired Weeb Ewbank as the general manager and head coach. Ewbank and quarterback Joe Namath led the Jets to prominence in 1969, when New York defeated the heavily favored Baltimore Colts in Super Bowl III and solidified the AFL's position in the world of professional football.\nWhen the AFL and NFL merged, the team fell into a state of mediocrity along with their star quarterback, Namath, who only had three successful post-merger seasons after injuries hampered much of his career. The Jets continued to spiral downward before enjoying a string of successes in the 1980s, which included an appearance in the 1982 AFC Championship Game, and the emergence of the popular New York Sack Exchange. Walt Michaels and Joe Walton coached the team throughout the decade.\nThe early 1990s saw the team struggling. After firing coach Bruce Coslet, owner Leon Hess hired Pete Carroll who struggled to a 6\u201310 record and was promptly fired at the end of the season. Thereafter, Rich Kotite was selected to lead the team to victory; instead he led the Jets to a 4\u201328 record over the next two years. Kotite stepped down at the end of his second season, forcing the Jets to search for a new head coach.\nHess lured then-disgruntled New England Patriots head coach Bill Parcells to New York in 1997. Parcells led the team back to relevance and coached them to the AFC Championship Game in 1998. Hess died in 1999 while the team, plagued by injuries, produced an eight win record, falling short of a playoff berth. At the end of the season, Parcells stepped down as head coach deferring control to his assistant, Bill Belichick; Belichick resigned the very next day (leaving a napkin at the stage for his introduction, on which he had written \"I resign as HC of the NYJ\") and went on to accept the head coaching position with the Patriots.\nThe franchise obtained a new owner in Woody Johnson in 2000. Additionally, through the 2000s the Jets visited the playoffs five times, a franchise record, under the direction of three coaches: Herm Edwards, Eric Mangini, and Rex Ryan. Rex Ryan was hired in January 2009. In the draft that year the Jets would take USC quarterback Mark Sanchez with the fifth overall pick with the intent of making him the franchise centerpiece. Ryan and Sanchez led the team to back-to-back AFC Championship Game appearances during their first two years, but the team never made the playoffs again during their tenure. The Jets had a 6\u201310 season in 2012 and an 8\u20138 season in 2013. After a 4\u201312 season in 2014, Sanchez was released, while Ryan and general manager John Idzik were fired.\nBefore the 2015 season, Todd Bowles was hired as head coach. In his first season, he led the Jets to a 10\u20136 record, second in the AFC East, but failed to qualify for the postseason. Then came three consecutive last-place finishes in the AFC East from 2016 to 2018, winning no more than five games each season. Bowles was fired after the 2018 season. Before the 2019 season, the Jets used their first-round pick, third overall, on quarterback Sam Darnold from USC and hired Adam Gase as head coach. Gase led the Jets to a 7\u20139 record in 2019 and 2\u201314 in 2020, missing the postseason both years, and was fired. Before the 2021 season, the Jets hired former 49ers defensive coordinator Robert Saleh as head coach. The Jets used their first-round pick, second overall, on BYU quarterback Zach Wilson. The 2021 season saw the Jets go 4\u201313 to finish last in the AFC East. The 2022 season brought the Jets a 7\u201310 record but another last-place finish in the division. In the 2023 season, the Jets once again finished 7\u201310, despite the highly deliberated signing of Aaron Rodgers, who suffered a season-ending Achilles tear on the first offensive series of the regular season. Rodgers was released by the Jets in February 2025 after two seasons with the team, although he remained on the roster until March 12. The 2024 season saw the Jets fire Saleh after a 2\u20133 start. Jeff Ulbrich finished the season with a 3\u20139 mark to end with a 5\u201312 record. Detroit Lions defensive coordinator Aaron Glenn was named as head coach after the season.\nOwnership.\nHarry Wismer.\nHarry Wismer, a businessman, had been interested in sports for much of his life when he was granted a charter franchise in the American Football League. Wismer was a three-sport letterman in high school, and went on to play football for the University of Florida and Michigan State University before a knee injury ended his playing career. Undeterred, Wismer began his career as a broadcaster with Michigan State and became a pioneer of the industry. Later, as the Titans owner, Wismer formulated a league-wide policy which allowed broadcasting rights to be shared equally among the teams.\nWismer, who had previously had a 25% stake in the Washington Redskins, was interested in the American Football League and was given a franchise to develop in New York. Wismer, whose philosophy was who you knew mattered most, tried to make the team and the league a success. His efforts began to accrue debt as the Titans' first two seasons were mediocre with attendance dropping in the team's second year. The franchise was sold for $1\u00a0million to a five-man syndicate headed by Sonny Werblin of the Gotham Football Club, Inc., in February 1963.\nSonny Werblin syndicate.\nSonny Werblin graduated from Rutgers University and was employed by the Music Corporation of America, eventually becoming president of the company's television division. With a vast knowledge of media, Werblin was determined to put the spotlight on the team. His first order of business, after changing the team's name and jerseys, was to sign Joe Namath to an unprecedented contract. Werblin's gamble would later pay off as Namath, who became a public star, led the Jets on to victory in Super Bowl III, though by then Werblin had sold his stake in the team.\nWerblin's partners, Townsend B. Martin, Leon Hess, Donald C. Lillis, and Philip H. Iselin, had a falling out with Werblin over the way the team was run\u2014though the franchise had begun to make a profit, Werblin was making all the policies and decisions himself with little or no input from his partners, much to their dismay. Though Werblin initially resisted their ultimatum to dissolve the partnership, Werblin agreed to be bought out in 1968. Werblin remained involved in the sports community and became the first chairman and CEO of the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority where he helped to create the Meadowlands Sports Complex, including Giants Stadium.\nLeon Hess.\nLeon Hess became well known for his Hess Corporation gas stations; however, he also played an instrumental part in the development of the Jets during his tenure as co-owner and eventual sole owner. Hess had often fought for improvements while the team was a tenant at Shea Stadium but generally stayed away from football operations, allowing his coaches and general manager to make football-related decisions.\nBecoming the team's majority stockholder in 1973, Hess bought Philip H. Iselin's share upon his death in 1976 after which only two of Hess' partners remained, Townsend Martin and Helen Dillon, who had inherited the stake from her father Donald Lillis, upon his death. Hess began to buy out the remaining partners in 1981 when he bought Martin's 25% stake for $5\u00a0million. Hess bought Dillon's stake three years later for another $5\u00a0million, acquiring sole control of the team.\nHess had a passion for his team and took losses hard. In 1995, after a mediocre 6\u201310 season under Pete Carroll, despite generally shying away from football operations, Hess said, \"I'm 80 years old, I want results now\" during a press conference in which Rich Kotite was introduced as the team's new coach. After two unsuccessful years with Kotite, Hess heavily involved himself in hiring Bill Parcells in hopes to see his team again reach the Super Bowl. He did not live to see his dream realized, dying on May 7, 1999.\nWoody Johnson.\nWith the team for sale, two potential buyers were found in Cablevision and billionaire heir Woody Johnson, whose grandfather Robert Wood Johnson II was a member of the family that founded Johnson &amp; Johnson. Johnson was unknown among the other NFL owners at the time of his $635\u00a0million purchase of the franchise. However, Johnson had a passion for sports, according to former Knicks general manager Ernie Grunfeld and desired to own his own team. Johnson has been described as an enabler who wants the best from his employees.\nMuch like Hess, Johnson left many of the football-related decisions up to his management team and tended to avoid the spotlight. However, upon hiring head coach Rex Ryan, Johnson had an increased presence as he molded the Jets into his team.\nChristopher Johnson.\nIn 2017, Woody Johnson was nominated by President Donald Trump as the United States Ambassador to the United Kingdom. Once his post was confirmed, his brother Christopher Johnson became a co-owner and took over the day-to-day operations for the team, including personnel decisions. Woody Johnson's term as ambassador ended in 2021, and he took over ownership duties from Christopher.\nStadiums.\nOwner Harry Wismer sought out a place for the team to play their home games but was only able to secure the dilapidated Polo Grounds, which had not had a major tenant since the baseball New York Giants vacated the stadium in 1957. The Titans played their first four seasons at the stadium\u2014in the final season they were renamed the Jets. The Titans shared the stadium with baseball's new expansion team, the New York Mets, for two years before both teams moved to Shea Stadium in Queens in 1964. The Jets hold the distinction of being the final team to host a game at the Polo Grounds, a 19\u201310 loss to the Buffalo Bills on December 14, 1963.\nWismer hoped the then Titans could play in what would become known as Shea Stadium beginning in 1961. However, funding difficulties and legal problems delayed construction of the stadium. Wismer signed a memorandum of understanding in late 1961 to secure the Titans' new home. That memorandum recognized that the Mets would have exclusive use of the stadium until they had completed their season. As the team moved to Shea under new ownership, they were, in most years, required to open the season with several road games, a problem made worse in 1969 and 1973 when the Mets had long playoff runs.\nFeeling that this arrangement put the Jets at a disadvantage, the team announced in 1977 that they would play two home games a year during the month of September at the Giants' new home in New Jersey, Giants Stadium. Litigation began between New York City and the Jets over the issue, and in the lawsuit's settlement, the city agreed to allow the Jets to play two September home games a season at Shea beginning in 1978 for the remaining six years in the Jets' lease. In 1977, the Jets were to play one September game at Giants Stadium and an October 2 game at Shea.\nIn spite of these issues, majority owner Leon Hess was interested in renewing the team's lease at Shea, which was due to expire in 1983. Hess negotiated with New York mayor Ed Koch. Hess wanted the city to redevelop the stadium to expand its capacity. He also hoped to renegotiate other aspects of the lease\u2014the Jets received no money from ticketholders parking at Shea. Hess's proposals met resistance from Koch. When negotiations reached an impasse, the Jets announced their intention to depart for New Jersey. On December 10, 1983, the Jets played their final game at Shea and lost to the Steelers 34\u20137. As fans pillaged the stadium for mementos, the scoreboard read \"N.J. Jets\" in reference to the Jets' departure to the Meadowlands.\nWhen the Jets joined the Giants at the stadium, many Jets fans hoped the name, Giants Stadium, would be changed. However, the Giants, who had the authority to approve the change, refused. In an effort to conceal the fact that they played in a stadium built and decorated for another team, the stadium grounds crew was assigned to make the stadium more Jet-friendly during Jets games by putting up green banners and placing the Jets' logo over the Giants'. No change could be made to the blue and red seating bowl. The Jets were featured in the first NFL playoff game in the stadium's history, falling to the Patriots on December 28, 1985.\nAs the Jets sought to become a stronger franchise and remove themselves from their counterparts' shadow, the team entered into negotiations with the Metropolitan Transportation Authority in an attempt to build a stadium on the west side of Manhattan, entering a bidding war with TransGas Energy Systems and Cablevision for the rights to the West Side Yard property\u2014Hess had been approached by former mayor Rudy Giuliani about bringing the team to the West Side when their lease at Giants Stadium expired in 2008. Cablevision was fixated against the Jets owning the land as Madison Square Garden, located only a few blocks away, would be forced to compete with the stadium. Team owners had voted, 31\u20131, with the Buffalo Bills the only objectors, to award the 2010 Super Bowl to New York, contingent on the Jets winning the bid and completing construction of the stadium before 2010.\nThe MTA unanimously voted to sell the land to the Jets for about $210\u00a0million as the committee agreed that having the stadium would be beneficial in the long run. An angry Cablevision, community groups and transportation advocates were determined to derail the Jets' attempts at building the stadium and two lawsuits challenging the construction of the stadium on environmental grounds were filed.\nAlthough confident they could secure the stadium, their hopes were dashed when Sheldon Silver and Joseph L. Bruno, both of whom held veto power over the stadium construction, refused to support the project, alleging it would hurt rather than help the development of the West Side.\nDefeated, the Jets agreed to enter a 50\u201350 joint venture with their rival, the Giants, to build a new stadium effectively agreeing to a 99-year lease, which the Giants had signed earlier in the year, to remain in New Jersey. The stadium, known as MetLife Stadium, became the first in the history of the NFL to be jointly built by two franchises. The stadium, which is illuminated in different colors depending on which team is hosting a game, opened in April 2010 and saw the Jets and Giants open the stadium together in a preseason exhibition game. The Jets' first regular season home game at the new stadium was held on September 13, 2010, and was shown nationwide on Monday Night Football. New York lost to the Ravens 10\u20139. Team owners voted to have the stadium host Super Bowl XLVIII, held in 2014.\nRivalries.\nDivisional.\nNew England Patriots.\nSince the inception of the American Football League, the Jets have maintained what is considered to be a marquee rivalry with the New England Patriots. The rivalry was relatively docile in its early years until 1966 when the Jets removed the Patriots, who had hopes of appearing in Super Bowl I, from playoff contention with a 38\u201328 defeat at Shea Stadium. The Patriots returned the favor in 1985 when the Jets lost to New England 26\u201314 in the wild card round; the Patriots went on to Super Bowl XX where they were defeated by the Bears.\nThe rivalry began to escalate and receive increased media attention in 1997 when a disgruntled Bill Parcells vacated his head coaching position with New England to accept the same position with New York Jets. The next year, the Jets signed Pro Bowl running back Curtis Martin from the Patriots. After the Jets declined during Parcells' third year, Parcells decided to resign as head coach. His assistant, Bill Belichick, was installed as the new head coach but suddenly resigned the next day at a press conference, just one day after accepting the position, to become the new head coach of the Patriots instead. His decision was influenced by the passing of the team owner, Leon Hess, before the '99 season, who at one point was offering Belichick a $1 million bonus to stay put. However, Belichick had not spoken to the two potential new owners, Woody Johnson and Charles Dolan, and had issues with both because the original agreement with Hess was no longer there; \"the whole ownership configuration at that point in time was a major factor in my decision much more than a personal relationship.\"\nA critical turning point of the rivalry took place on September 23, 2001, when Jets linebacker Mo Lewis tackled Drew Bledsoe, leaving the veteran with internal bleeding. This provided an opportunity for Tom Brady to take over as the starting quarterback and during his tenure, Brady successfully guided New England to six Super Bowl titles. In 2006, Eric Mangini, an assistant under Belichick, left New England to join the Jets as their head coach. Under Mangini, the infamous Spygate incident took place, further escalating tensions between both clubs. When Rex Ryan was hired as the team's head coach, the rivalry further escalated due to an increased war of words between both teams. In January 2011, the two met in a Divisional Round playoff game. The visiting Jets pulled a 28\u201321 upset to advance to the AFC Championship Game, which they ultimately lost one week later to the Pittsburgh Steelers. As of the 2024 season, the Patriots lead the all-time series 75\u201356\u20131.\nBuffalo Bills.\nThe Jets and the Bills represent the same state (although the Jets play in New Jersey), and this rivalry represents the differences between New York City and Upstate New York. The teams are both charter members of the American Football League and have generally stayed in the same division since, even after the NFL and AFL merged. The first meeting between the two teams saw the New York Titans, later the Jets, defeat the Bills 27\u20133. Aside from a few notable moments, such as O. J. Simpson breaking an NFL rushing record against the Jets, the lone playoff game in the series between the two teams in the 1981 , and ex-Jets coach Rex Ryan coaching the Bills for two years, the rivalry has otherwise been characterized by shared mediocrity and uncompetitive games, including notable blunders by quarterbacks Mark Sanchez of the Jets, and J. P. Losman of the Bills. However, in recent years, the series has heated up again due to a friendly rivalry between quarterbacks Sam Darnold and Josh Allen, who were selected in the first round of the 2018 draft. As of the 2024 season, the Bills lead the all-time series 71\u201358.\nMiami Dolphins.\nNew York has maintained a rivalry with the Miami Dolphins since the Dolphins' inception in 1966. The lone tie in the series took place in Week 5 of the 1981 season with a 28\u201328 draw. The Jets' best chance to reach the Super Bowl after the Super Bowl III victory was thwarted by A.J. Duhe in 1983 whose interception return for touchdown on a rain-soaked field in the conference championship game was the decisive score. This remains as the lone postseason meeting in the series. One of the most famous games in Jets history took place in 1994 when the Dolphins ran the Fake Spike play, giving them an improbable victory and halting the Jets' momentum that season, serving as a precursor to the Jets' next two unsuccessful years under Rich Kotite. The Jets went on to complete an improbable victory of their own on October 23, 2000, in what is known as The Monday Night Miracle. The Jets, trailing the Dolphins 30\u20137 at the end of the third quarter, rallied in the fourth quarter scoring 23 unanswered points, eventually winning in overtime with a 40-yard John Hall kick.\nWhen Rex Ryan became New York's head coach, there was an increased war of words between the clubs culminating with Ryan flashing an obscene gesture to heckling Dolphins fans in January 2010. The rivalry continued between both teams when Sal Alosi, then the strength and conditioning coach of the Jets, tripped Dolphins cornerback Nolan Carroll. Carroll was not seriously injured and Alosi resigned nearly two months later. As of the 2024 season, the Miami Dolphins lead the all-time series, 61\u201357\u20131.\nInterconference.\nNew York Giants.\nThe New York Jets previously maintained a high tension rivalry against their in-town counterparts, the New York Giants, that has since diminished due to the infrequency of the teams meeting in the regular season. The pinnacle of the rivalry came on August 17, 1969, when the Jets and Giants met for the first time, in a preseason game which was viewed as a \"turf war\" by both sides. The Giants, considered a mediocre team at the time, were regarded as underdogs and faced considerable scrutiny from their fans and the media. The Jets 37\u201314 win resulted in the firing of Giants coach Allie Sherman.\nThe Jets met the Giants in 1988 for the final game of the regular season. The Jets, with a 7\u20137\u20131 record, had little to lose as their hopes for playoff contention had vanished. The 10\u20135 Giants were fighting for a playoff spot, and a victory would have clinched a division title and playoff berth. Although the six point favorites, the Giants were unable to overcome a Jets defense that sacked their quarterback Phil Simms eight times. With the Jets' victory and wins by the Rams and Eagles, the Giants were eliminated from playoff contention and the Jets gained respect in the eyes of many.\nIn spite of the big sibling rivalry that has resulted in trash talk between the players, both teams have formed an unexpected and consequently strong partnership sharing Giants Stadium for 26 years and MetLife Stadium, a venture in which both teams own a 50% share of the venue. The rivalry regained much of its tension in the 2011 NFL season when the Jets and Giants met in Week 16. Both teams needed a victory to keep their playoffs hope alive and there was significant trash talk between Rex Ryan and his players and many of the Giants in the weeks leading up to the game. Ryan and Giants running back Brandon Jacobs reportedly came close to blows after the game, a 29\u201314 Giants win. The two teams met again on December 6, 2015, with the Jets coming from behind and winning 23\u201320 in overtime. The teams met again in 2019, with the Jets taking the win 34\u201327. On October 29, 2023, the Jets won 13\u201310 in overtime as the visitors. As of the 2023 season, the Giants lead the all-time series 8\u20137.\nLogos and uniforms.\nThe Jets' original uniforms, as the Titans of New York in 1960, were navy blue with old gold numerals, gold pants with two parallel blue stripes on each side, and navy blue helmets with a single gold stripe down the center and no logo decals. The white jerseys had navy blue numerals. In 1961, the Titans added UCLA-style shoulder stripes (gold and white on the blue jerseys, gold and navy blue on the white jerseys), changed the pants striping to a blue stripe flanked by white stripes, and employed a somewhat brighter shade of gold.\nWhen the Titans became the Jets in 1963, navy and gold were abandoned in favor of kelly green and white. The jerseys had opposite-colored sleeves with thick stripes on the shoulders and cuffs, above and below the TV numerals, and the pants were white with two parallel green stripes on each side. The new helmets were white with a single green stripe down the center; the logo on each side was a silhouette of a jet airplane in green, with the word \"JETS\" in thick white sans-serif italics along the fuselage. In 1964 the single green center stripe became two parallel stripes, and the jet-plane decal was replaced with a white football shape outlined in green, with the word \"JETS\" in thick green sans-serif italics in front of \"NY\" in green outline serif lettering, and a miniature football at bottom center. The decals were difficult to see from a distance (or on television), so the colors were reversed and the decals slightly enlarged in 1965. This design remained largely unchanged through 1977, apart from some variations to the numeral and lettering typefaces, the angle of the helmet decals, and adjustments to the shoulder and sleeve striping due to changes in NFL jersey tailoring and materials.\nThe Jets' first major design change was made for the 1978 season. The kelly green and white color scheme was retained; the new helmets were solid green with white facemasks, no stripes, and a stylized \"JETS\" wordmark in white on each side. The mark featured angular lettering and a silhouette of a modern jet airplane extending horizontally to the right from the top of the \"J\" above the \"ETS.\" The jerseys featured large TV numerals on the shoulders and two thick parallel stripes on the sleeves, while the pants had a single green stripe from hip to knee on each side. In 1990 the Jets modified this design by adding thin black outlines to the numerals, lettering, stripes, and helmet decals, changing the facemasks from white to black, and adding a set of green pants and white socks to be worn with the white jerseys.\nThe Jets were the first NFL team to wear a \"throwback\" uniform, in 1993 for a home game against the Cincinnati Bengals, celebrating the 25th anniversary of the 1968 championship team. The jersey and pants mimicked the 1963\u201377 design, although the team wore its regular green helmets with a white-outlined version of the 1965\u201377 logo decal. In 1994, as part of the NFL's 75th Anniversary celebration, the Jets wore both home and road versions of this uniform in select games, again using their regular green helmets with the 1965\u201377 logo but with two parallel white stripes down the center.\nThe Jets adopted a new uniform and logo design in 1998, a modernization of the 1965\u201377 set with a darker hunter green replacing the bright kelly green, and the primary logo now oval rather than football-shaped and updated with starker lines. Green pants and striped white socks were added in 2002, and were worn with both the white and green jerseys.\nIn 2007, the Jets introduced a new \"throwback\" uniform evoking the original Titans of New York and combining elements of the 1960 and 1961\u201362 uniforms, with navy blue helmets and jerseys, old gold numerals and helmet stripes, gold and white shoulder stripes, and gold pants with blue and white stripes on each side. These uniforms appeared again in 2008, 2009 and 2011, with a white-jersey variation also appearing in 2009 as part of the NFL's celebration of the American Football League's 50th anniversary.\nThe Jets abandoned their classic look for a second time in 2019, with a new uniform design featuring a medium shade of green which the franchise called \"Gotham Green,\" reincorporating black as a third/trim color, and reverting to green helmets with a metallic paint finish and black facemasks. The jerseys and pants now had tapered striping, a \"NEW YORK\" wordmark on the upper chest, and a new sans-serif block-style numeral font. The primary logo reverted to a football shape, and eliminated the background \"NY\" initials in favor of \"NEW YORK\" in sans-serif italics above \"JETS,\" which was modified to make the \"J\" the same height as the other letters and moved slightly downward, with the revised football graphic now covering the lower portion of the letters \"E\" and \"T\"; the helmet decal was a secondary logo featuring only the \"JETS\" wordmark and football. The team also introduced a black alternate uniform with green striping and white numerals outlined in green. In 2022, with league rule changes allowing for a second helmet shell, the black uniform was paired with a matte-black alternate helmet with a metallic-green facemask and the \"JETS\" logo in green outlined in white.\nIn 2023, the Jets introduced a \"legacy white\" throwback uniform resembling the 1978\u201389 design, then announced at the end of the season that this would become the team's primary uniform in 2024, with green and black versions added to complete the set. For this rebrand the 1978 \"JETS\" logo was slightly modified to condense the spacing between the letters, and to widen the tail and streamline the nose of the jet-plane silhouette. The primary uniforms resemble the 1978\u201389 design in most respects, although the \"Gotham Green\" shade (renamed \"Legacy Green\") and metallic-finish helmet shells were carried over and the set includes a green pants option; the black alternates apply the same color scheme as the outgoing set to the new template. The Jets also released a \"Classic\" white uniform which is based on the 1965\u201377 and 1998\u20132018 designs.\nIn 2025 the Jets were one of eight teams to add a \"Rivalries\" uniform as part of a program by the NFL and Nike, to be worn in one home game against a divisional opponent. The base color of the jerseys and pants is a slightly green-tinted shade of black, with silver numerals outlined in dark grey in a custom \"Gothic\" typeface, black-grey-black stripes over the shoulders and along the pants seams, and black sleeves with a grey pattern meant to resemble New York City manhole covers; the helmets are black with black facemasks, grey-outlined silver wordmark decals, and a dark grey center stripe with the manhole-cover pattern.\nCheerleading squad.\nThe original Jets Flag Crew was established in 2006. In 2007, the group underwent an expansion and was renamed the Jets Flight Crew. The squad regularly performs choreographed routines during the team's home contests. Auditions have been held annually since their inception to attract new members.\nThe Jets Junior Flight Crew was established in 2010, offering children the opportunity to train with the Flight Crew while improving their \"talent and abilities in a non-competitive environment.\"\nRadio and television.\nThe Jets' current flagship radio station is WAXQ, which is owned by iHeartMedia. The station became the Jets' flagship in February 2024 after Good Karma Brands, the owner of former flagship station WPEN-AM, elected to end its agreement with Emmis Communications to operate WEPN-FM and stop simulcasting its programming on the station.\nAs of the 2024 season, Bob Wischusen is the play-by-play announcer, with Anthony Becht as the analyst. Wischusen has been the voice of the Jets since the 2002 season, taking over the role when Howard David became the voice of the Miami Dolphins. Becht, the former Jets tight end, took over the analyst role for 2024 after Marty Lyons, a former member of the New York Sack Exchange from the 1980s Jets, resigned his position to take on a new role with the team as a brand ambassador.\nAny preseason games not nationally televised are shown on WCBS-TV. SportsNet New York, which serves as the official home of the Jets, airs over 250 hours of \"exclusive, in depth\" material on the team in high definition.\n\"Monday Night Football\" games are televised in a simulcast with ESPN by either sister station WABC-TV, or WPIX-TV if WABC chooses to waive the game to another station to carry regularly scheduled programming. \"Thursday Night Football\" games streamed by Amazon Prime are carried locally by WNYW.\nSeason-by-season record.\nThis is a partial list of the Jets' last five completed seasons.\n\"Note: The finish, wins, losses, and ties columns list regular season results and exclude any postseason play.\"\nPlayers.\nPro Football Hall of Famers.\nEwbank, Hill, Klecko, Martin, Mawae, Maynard, Namath, and Revis are recognized based upon their achievements with the Jets. Ewbank is also recognized based upon his achievements with the Baltimore Colts, coaching them to NFL championships in 1958 and 1959. Riggins is recognized primarily for his seasons with the Washington Redskins (1976\u20131979, 1981\u20131985), as is Monk (1980\u20131993), who won three Super Bowl championships with Washington. Lott is in the Hall of Fame primarily for his exploits as a member of the San Francisco 49ers. Baugh and Turner are recognized based upon their achievements as players with other teams, rather than their head coaching stints with the Jets. While Parcells reversed the fortunes of the Jets, he had major impact for the New York Giants, coaching them to two Super Bowl victories. Wolf only had a brief stint with the Jets between 1990 and 1991, while most of his major contributions occurred as an executive and player personnel director with the Oakland Raiders (1963\u20131974, 1979\u20131989), and later as General Manager of the Green Bay Packers (1991\u20132001). Favre only played one season as a member of the Jets in 2008, between most of his career with the Packers (1992\u20132007) and his last two NFL seasons with the Minnesota Vikings (2009\u20132010). Namath, Riggins, Klecko, and Revis are the only Hall of Famers who were drafted by the Jets.\nRetired numbers.\nAdditionally, the Jets have not reissued the #80 jersey of Wayne Chrebet (WR, 1995\u20132005) since he suffered a career-ending concussion in the 2005 season, and it has long been understood that it will not be worn again in the foreseeable future. Along similar lines, Byrd's #90 had not been reissued since he suffered a career-ending neck injury in 1992, and it had been understood long before his number was formally retired that no Jet would ever wear it again. Further, the Jets have not reissued #24 since the release of Darrelle Revis in 2016.\nRing of Honor.\nThe Jets established a Ring of Honor on July 20, 2010, to commemorate former players. Each season, players will be nominated by an internal committee and then inducted into the Ring. There is no specific amount of honorees to be selected each year.\nAmerican Football League All-Time Team.\nThese Titans/Jets were picked for the American Football League All-Time Team on January 14, 1970. The first and second teams were determined by a panel of members of the AFL's Hall of Fame Board of Selectors: Bold indicates players elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame.\nAll-Time Four Decade Team.\nNew York announced their official All-Time Four Decade team in 2003, which was determined by the fans of the team. Bold indicates those elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame.\nNotable first-round draft picks.\nPerhaps the most famous of the Jets' first round picks came in 1965 when they selected Alabama quarterback Joe Namath who boosted the Jets into the national spotlight with his boisterous personality and lifestyle. His physical talents on the field helped improve the Jets' fortunes, leading them to victory over the Baltimore Colts in Super Bowl III. Though injuries hampered the latter part of Namath's career, he is best remembered, according to former teammate John Dockery, as \"a guy that came along and broke a lot of the conventions.\" Namath was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1985.\nThe Jets have had a history of selecting players who turned out to be draft busts. Perhaps one of the most disappointing players in Jets history was running back Blair Thomas. Thomas, who averaged 5.4 yards (4.94 m \ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddfa) per carry at Penn State, was an intriguing prospect the Jets were interested in using to help their cumbersome offense. Confident in their decision, the Jets drafted Thomas with the second overall pick in 1990, expecting him to be a solid player for years to come. Thomas ran for only 620\u00a0yards in 1990, and failed to meet the high expectations. By the time Thomas left the team as an unrestricted free agent in 1993, he had rushed for 2,009 yards (1837.03 m \ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddfa) and only five touchdowns. The 2008 first round pick, outside linebacker Vernon Gholston, followed a similar path, failing to record a sack during his three-year tenure with the team.\nKyle Brady in 1995, who was drafted ahead of Warren Sapp, one of many disappointments during Rich Kotite's tenure as coach. However, in the same draft, the Jets did better with Hugh Douglas. Dewayne Robertson was a fourth overall selection in 2003 by the Jets. The defensive tackle out of Kentucky failed to make a big impact with the team. He accounted for 14.5 sacks in his 5 seasons with the team, a rather underwhelming player given what the Jets had hoped for. At quarterback, the Jets found themselves dealing with the consequences of drafting University of Alabama quarterback Richard Todd in 1976. In his tenure with the Jets, he threw for more interceptions than he did touchdowns. In the 1982 season, the Jets played vs the Miami Dolphins in the AFC Championship Game. Todd threw for five interceptions and the Jets lost the game. A year later, Todd would be traded to the New Orleans Saints. The most recent bust, Dee Milliner, was drafted by the team in 2013. Milliner played his college career at the University of Alabama and had high expectations after being drafted. Lasting just 3 years with the team, Milliner's career was plagued by injuries and inconsistency, recording only 3 interceptions during his brief Jets career.\nIn the 2013 and 2014 seasons, one of the Jets' strongest units was their defensive line, manned by first round selections Muhammad Wilkerson (2011) and Sheldon Richardson (2013). In 2013, Wilkerson ended the season with 10.5 sacks, matching the last Jets player to have more than 10 sacks in a single season, John Abraham in 2005. Also that year, Richardson was honored with an award from the AP for Defensive Rookie of the Year. The Jets' run defense was stout with all three in the line up, finishing fifth as a team in rushing yards allowed in 2014.\nIn the 2017 NFL draft, the Jets selected Jamal Adams with the sixth overall pick out of LSU. Adams had a strong start to his early career, making the Pro Bowl in the 2018 season and winning the Defensive MVP Award alongside Kansas City Chiefs' quarterback Patrick Mahomes as the Offensive MVP.\nIn the 2019 NFL draft, the Jets selected Quinnen Williams from Alabama with the third overall pick. Williams had been touted as the best overall prospect leading up to the draft, being compared to defensive tackle superstar Aaron Donald. Williams ended up being the final first-round pick by then general manager Mike Maccagnan, who was fired shortly after the draft. Williams struggled in his rookie year with injuries and inconsistent play, but showed promise as a defensive anchor in his 2020 season: he recorded 7.0 sacks and 55 total tackles before being added to the Injured Reserved list in the final weeks of the season.\nIn the 2022 NFL draft, the Jets made three selections in the first round. The Jets selected cornerback Sauce Gardner from the University of Cincinnati fourth overall. He made the 2022 All-Pro Team as a rookie, the first to do so at his position since Ronnie Lott in 1981. The second of their three first round selections was wide receiver Garrett Wilson from Ohio State, who was selected 10th overall. The Jets third and final selection in the first round was defensive end Jermaine Johnson II of Florida State University.\nCoaches and staff.\nHead coaches.\nThe Jets have had 21 head coaches in their history coach at least one game for the franchise. 18 of their head coaches have served in a full-time role.\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\nrole=\"presentation\" class=\"wikitable succession-box noprint\" style=\"margin:0.5em auto; font-size:small;clear:both;\""}
{"id": "21723", "revid": "7611264", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21723", "title": "Nonlinear optics", "text": "Branch of physics\nNonlinear optics (NLO) is a branch of optics that studies the case when optical properties of matter depend on the intensity of the input light. Nonlinear phenomena become relevant only when the input light is very intense. Typically, in order to observe nonlinear phenomena, an intensity of the electromagnetic field of light larger than 108 V/m (and thus comparable to the atomic electric field of ~1011 V/m) is required. In this case, the polarization density P responds non-linearly to the electric field E of light. In order to obtain an electromagnetic field that is sufficiently intense, laser sources must be used. In nonlinear optics, the superposition principle no longer holds, and the polarization of the material is no longer linear in the electric field intensity. Instead, in the perturbative limit, it can be expressed by a polynomial sum of order n. Many different physical mechanisms can cause nonlinearities in the optical behaviour of a material, i.e. the motion of bound electrons, field-induced vibrational or orientational motions, optically-induced acoustic waves and thermal effects. The motion of bound electrons, in particular, has a very short response timescale, so it is of particular relevance in the context of ultrafast nonlinear optics. The simplest way to picture this behaviour in a semiclassical way is to use a phenomenological model: an anharmonic oscillator can model the forced oscillations of a bound electron inside the medium. In this picture, the binding interaction between the ion core and the electron is the Coulomb force and nonlinearities appear as changes in the elastic constant of the system (which behaves similarly to a mass attached to a spring) when the stretching or compression of the oscillator is large enough. \nIt must be pointed out that Maxwell's equations are linear in vacuum, so, nonlinear processes only occur in media. However, the theory of quantum electrodynamics (QED) predicts that, above the Schwinger limit, vacuum itself can behave in a nonlinear way.\nThe description of nonlinear optics usually presented in textbooks is the perturbative regime, which is valid when the input intensity remains below 1014 W/cm2, which implies that the electric field is well below the intensity of interatomic fields. This approach allows to use a Taylor series to write down the polarization density as a polynomial sum. It is also possible to study the laser-matter interaction at a much higher intensity of light: this field is referred to as nonperturbational nonlinear optics or extreme nonlinear optics and investigates the generation of extremely high-order harmonics, attosecond pulse generation and relativistic nonlinear effects.\nHistory.\nThe first nonlinear optical effect to be predicted was two-photon absorption, by Maria Goeppert Mayer for her PhD in 1931, but it remained an unexplored theoretical curiosity until 1961 and the almost simultaneous observation of two-photon absorption at Bell Labs\nand the discovery of second-harmonic generation by Peter Franken \"et al.\" at University of Michigan, both shortly after the construction of the first laser by Theodore Maiman. However, some nonlinear effects were discovered before the development of the laser. The theoretical basis for many nonlinear processes was first described in Bloembergen's monograph \"Nonlinear Optics\".\nNonlinear optical processes.\nNonlinear optics explains nonlinear response of properties such as frequency, polarization, phase or path of incident light. These nonlinear interactions give rise to a host of optical phenomena:\nRelated processes.\nIn these processes, the medium has a linear response to the light, but the properties of the medium are affected by other causes:\nParametric processes.\nNonlinear effects fall into two qualitatively different categories, parametric and non-parametric effects. A parametric non-linearity\nis an interaction in which the quantum state of the nonlinear material is not changed by the interaction with the optical field. As a consequence of this, the process is \"instantaneous\". Energy and momentum are conserved in the optical field, making phase matching important and polarization-dependent.\nTheory.\nParametric and \"instantaneous\" (i.e. material must be lossless and dispersionless through the Kramers\u2013Kronig relations) nonlinear optical phenomena, in which the optical fields are not too large, can be described by a Taylor series expansion of the dielectric polarization density (electric dipole moment per unit volume) P(\"t\") at time \"t\" in terms of the electric field E(\"t\"):\nformula_3\nwhere the coefficients \u03c7(\"n\") are the \"n\"-th-order susceptibilities of the medium, and the presence of such a term is generally referred to as an \"n\"-th-order nonlinearity. Note that the polarization density P(\"t\") and electrical field E(\"t\") are considered as scalar quantities for simplicity. In a full treatment of nonlinear optics, both the polarization density and the field must be vectors, while \u03c7(\"n\") becomes an (\"n\"\u00a0+\u00a01)-th-rank tensor representing both the polarization-dependent nature of the parametric interaction and the symmetries (or lack of symmetries) of the nonlinear material.\nWave equation in a nonlinear material.\nCentral to the study of electromagnetic waves is the wave equation. Starting with Maxwell's equations in an isotropic medium, containing no free charge, it can be shown that\nformula_4\nwhere PNL is the nonlinear part of the polarization density, and \"n\" is the refractive index, which comes from the linear term in P.\nNote that one can normally use the vector identity\nformula_5\nand Gauss's law (assuming no free charges, formula_6),\nformula_7\nto obtain the more familiar wave equation\nformula_8\nFor a nonlinear medium, Gauss's law does not imply that the identity\nformula_9\nis true in general, even for an isotropic medium. However, even when this term is not identically 0, it is often negligibly small and thus in practice is usually ignored, giving us the standard nonlinear wave equation:\nformula_10\nNonlinearities as a wave-mixing process.\nThe nonlinear wave equation is an inhomogeneous differential equation. The general solution comes from the study of partial differential equations and can be obtained by the use of a Green's function. Physically, one gets the electromagnetic wave solutions to the homogeneous part of the wave equation:\nformula_11\nand the inhomogeneous term\nformula_12\nacts as a driver/source of the electromagnetic waves. One of the consequences of this is a nonlinear interaction that results in energy being mixed or coupled between different frequencies, which is often called a \"wave mixing\".\nIn general, an \"n\"-th order nonlinearity will lead to (\"n\"\u00a0+\u00a01)-wave mixing. As an example, if we consider only a second-order nonlinearity (three-wave mixing), then the polarization P takes the form\nformula_13\nIf we assume that \"E\"(\"t\") is made up of two components at frequencies \"\u03c9\"1 and \"\u03c9\"2, we can write \"E\"(\"t\") as\nformula_14\nand using Euler's formula to convert to exponentials,\nformula_15\nwhere \"c.c.\" stands for complex conjugate. Plugging this into the expression for P gives\nformula_16\nwhich has frequency components at 2\"\u03c9\"1, 2\"\u03c9\"2, \"\u03c9\"1\u00a0+\u00a0\"\u03c9\"2, \"\u03c9\"1\u00a0\u2212\u00a0\"\u03c9\"2, and 0. These three-wave mixing processes correspond to the nonlinear effects known as second-harmonic generation, sum-frequency generation, difference-frequency generation and optical rectification respectively.\nNote: Parametric generation and amplification is a variation of difference-frequency generation, where the lower frequency of one of the two generating fields is much weaker (parametric amplification) or completely absent (parametric generation). In the latter case, the fundamental quantum-mechanical uncertainty in the electric field initiates the process.\nPhase matching.\nThe above ignores the position dependence of the electrical fields. In a typical situation, the electrical fields are traveling waves described by\nformula_17\nat position formula_18, with the wave vector formula_19, where formula_20 is the velocity of light in vacuum, and formula_21 is the index of refraction of the medium at angular frequency formula_22. Thus, the second-order polarization at angular frequency formula_23 is\nformula_24\nAt each position formula_18 within the nonlinear medium, the oscillating second-order polarization radiates at angular frequency formula_26 and a corresponding wave vector formula_27. Constructive interference, and therefore a high-intensity formula_26 field, will occur only if\nformula_29\nThe above equation is known as the \"phase-matching condition\". Typically, three-wave mixing is done in a birefringent crystalline material, where the refractive index depends on the polarization and direction of the light that passes through. The polarizations of the fields and the orientation of the crystal are chosen such that the phase-matching condition is fulfilled. This phase-matching technique is called angle tuning. Typically a crystal has three axes, one or two of which have a different refractive index than the other one(s). Uniaxial crystals, for example, have a single preferred axis, called the extraordinary (e) axis, while the other two are ordinary axes (o) (see crystal optics). There are several schemes of choosing the polarizations for this crystal type. If the signal and idler have the same polarization, it is called \"type-I phase matching\", and if their polarizations are perpendicular, it is called \"type-II phase matching\". However, other conventions exist that specify further which frequency has what polarization relative to the crystal axis. These types are listed below, with the convention that the signal wavelength is shorter than the idler wavelength.\nMost common nonlinear crystals are negative uniaxial, which means that the \"e\" axis has a smaller refractive index than the \"o\" axes. In those crystals, type-I and -II phase matching are usually the most suitable schemes. In positive uniaxial crystals, types VII and VIII are more suitable. Types II and III are essentially equivalent, except that the names of signal and idler are swapped when the signal has a longer wavelength than the idler. For this reason, they are sometimes called IIA and IIB. The type numbers V\u2013VIII are less common than I and II and variants.\nOne undesirable effect of angle tuning is that the optical frequencies involved do not propagate collinearly with each other. This is due to the fact that the extraordinary wave propagating through a birefringent crystal possesses a Poynting vector that is not parallel to the propagation vector. This would lead to beam walk-off, which limits the nonlinear optical conversion efficiency. Two other methods of phase matching avoid beam walk-off by forcing all frequencies to propagate at a 90\u00b0 with respect to the optical axis of the crystal. These methods are called temperature tuning and quasi-phase-matching.\nTemperature tuning is used when the pump (laser) frequency polarization is orthogonal to the signal and idler frequency polarization. The birefringence in some crystals, in particular lithium niobate is highly temperature-dependent. The crystal temperature is controlled to achieve phase-matching conditions.\nThe other method is quasi-phase-matching. In this method the frequencies involved are not constantly locked in phase with each other, instead the crystal axis is flipped at a regular interval \u039b, typically 15 micrometres in length. Hence, these crystals are called periodically poled. This results in the polarization response of the crystal to be shifted back in phase with the pump beam by reversing the nonlinear susceptibility. This allows net positive energy flow from the pump into the signal and idler frequencies. In this case, the crystal itself provides the additional wavevector \"k\"\u00a0=\u00a02\u03c0/\u039b (and hence momentum) to satisfy the phase-matching condition. Quasi-phase-matching can be expanded to chirped gratings to get more bandwidth and to shape an SHG pulse like it is done in a dazzler. SHG of a pump and self-phase modulation (emulated by second-order processes) of the signal and an optical parametric amplifier can be integrated monolithically.\nHigher-order frequency mixing.\nThe above holds for formula_30 processes. It can be extended for processes where formula_1 is nonzero, something that is generally true in any medium without any symmetry restrictions; in particular resonantly enhanced sum or difference frequency mixing in gasses is frequently used for extreme or \"vacuum\" ultra-violet light generation. In common scenarios, such as mixing in dilute gases, the non-linearity is weak and so the light beams are focused which, unlike the plane wave approximation used above, introduces a pi phase shift on each light beam, complicating the phase-matching requirements. Conveniently, difference frequency mixing with formula_1 cancels this focal phase shift and often has a nearly self-canceling overall phase-matching condition, which relatively simplifies broad wavelength tuning compared to sum frequency generation. In formula_1 all four frequencies are mixing simultaneously, as opposed to sequential mixing via two formula_30 processes.\nThe Kerr effect can be described as a formula_1 as well. At high peak powers the Kerr effect can cause filamentation of light in air, in which the light travels without dispersion or divergence in a self-generated waveguide. At even high intensities the Taylor series, which led the domination of the lower orders, does not converge anymore and instead a time based model is used. When a noble gas atom is hit by an intense laser pulse, which has an electric field strength comparable to the Coulomb field of the atom, the outermost electron may be ionized from the atom. Once freed, the electron can be accelerated by the electric field of the light, first moving away from the ion, then back toward it as the field changes direction. The electron may then recombine with the ion, releasing its energy in the form of a photon. The light is emitted at every peak of the laser light field which is intense enough, producing a series of attosecond light flashes. The photon energies generated by this process can extend past the 800th harmonic order up to a few KeV. This is called high-order harmonic generation. The laser must be linearly polarized, so that the electron returns to the vicinity of the parent ion. High-order harmonic generation has been observed in noble gas jets, cells, and gas-filled capillary waveguides.\nExample uses.\nFrequency doubling.\nOne of the most commonly used frequency-mixing processes is frequency doubling, or second-harmonic generation. With this technique, the 1064\u00a0nm output from Nd:YAG lasers or the 800\u00a0nm output from Ti:sapphire lasers can be converted to visible light, with wavelengths of 532\u00a0nm (green) or 400\u00a0nm (violet) respectively.\nPractically, frequency doubling is carried out by placing a nonlinear medium in a laser beam. While there are many types of nonlinear media, the most common media are crystals. Commonly used crystals are BBO (\u03b2-barium borate), KDP (potassium dihydrogen phosphate), KTP (potassium titanyl phosphate), and lithium niobate. These crystals have the necessary properties of being strongly birefringent (necessary to obtain phase matching, see below), having a specific crystal symmetry, being transparent for both the impinging laser light and the frequency-doubled wavelength, and having high damage thresholds, which makes them resistant against the high-intensity laser light.\nOptical phase conjugation.\nIt is possible, using nonlinear optical processes, to exactly reverse the propagation direction and phase variation of a beam of light. The reversed beam is called a \"conjugate\" beam, and thus the technique is known as optical phase conjugation (also called \"time reversal\", \"wavefront reversal\" and is significantly different from \"retroreflection\").\nA device producing the phase-conjugation effect is known as a phase-conjugate mirror (PCM).\nPrinciples.\nOne can interpret optical phase conjugation as being analogous to a real-time holographic process. In this case, the interacting beams simultaneously interact in a nonlinear optical material to form a dynamic hologram (two of the three input beams), or real-time diffraction pattern, in the material. The third incident beam diffracts at this dynamic hologram, and, in the process, reads out the \"phase-conjugate\" wave. In effect, all three incident beams interact (essentially) simultaneously to form several real-time holograms, resulting in a set of diffracted output waves that phase up as the \"time-reversed\" beam. In the language of nonlinear optics, the interacting beams result in a nonlinear polarization within the material, which coherently radiates to form the phase-conjugate wave.\nReversal of wavefront means a perfect reversal of photons' linear momentum and angular momentum. The reversal of angular momentum means reversal of both polarization state and orbital angular momentum. Reversal of orbital angular momentum of optical vortex is due to the perfect match of helical phase profiles of the incident and reflected beams. Optical phase conjugation is implemented via stimulated Brillouin scattering, four-wave mixing, three-wave mixing, static linear holograms and some other tools.\nThe most common way of producing optical phase conjugation is to use a four-wave mixing technique, though it is also possible to use processes such as stimulated Brillouin scattering.\nFour-wave mixing technique.\nFor the four-wave mixing technique, we can describe four beams (\"j\" = 1, 2, 3, 4) with electric fields:\nformula_36\nwhere \"Ej\" are the electric field amplitudes. \u039e1 and \u039e2 are known as the two pump waves, with \u039e3 being the signal wave, and \u039e4 being the generated conjugate wave.\nIf the pump waves and the signal wave are superimposed in a medium with a non-zero \u03c7(3), this produces a nonlinear polarization field:\nformula_37\nresulting in generation of waves with frequencies given by \u03c9 = \u00b1\u03c91 \u00b1 \u03c92 \u00b1 \u03c93 in addition to third-harmonic generation waves with \u03c9 = 3\u03c91, 3\u03c92, 3\u03c93.\nAs above, the phase-matching condition determines which of these waves is the dominant. By choosing conditions such that \u03c9 = \u03c91 + \u03c92 \u2212 \u03c93 and k = k1 + k2 \u2212 k3, this gives a polarization field:\nformula_38\nThis is the generating field for the phase-conjugate beam, \u039e4. Its direction is given by k4 = k1 + k2 \u2212 k3, and so if the two pump beams are counterpropagating (k1 = \u2212k2), then the conjugate and signal beams propagate in opposite directions (k4 = \u2212k3). This results in the retroreflecting property of the effect.\nFurther, it can be shown that for a medium with refractive index \"n\" and a beam interaction length \"l\", the electric field amplitude of the conjugate beam is approximated by\nformula_39\nwhere \"c\" is the speed of light. If the pump beams \"E\"1 and \"E\"2 are plane (counterpropagating) waves, then\nformula_40\nthat is, the generated beam amplitude is the complex conjugate of the signal beam amplitude. Since the imaginary part of the amplitude contains the phase of the beam, this results in the reversal of phase property of the effect.\nNote that the constant of proportionality between the signal and conjugate beams can be greater than 1. This is effectively a mirror with a reflection coefficient greater than 100%, producing an amplified reflection. The power for this comes from the two pump beams, which are depleted by the process.\nThe frequency of the conjugate wave can be different from that of the signal wave. If the pump waves are of frequency \u03c91 = \u03c92 = \u03c9, and the signal wave is higher in frequency such that \u03c93 = \u03c9 + \u0394\u03c9, then the conjugate wave is of frequency \u03c94 = \u03c9\u00a0\u2212 \u0394\u03c9. This is known as \"frequency flipping\".\nAngular and linear momenta in optical phase conjugation.\nClassical picture.\nIn \"classical Maxwell electrodynamics\" a phase-conjugating mirror performs reversal of the Poynting vector:\nformula_41\n(\"in\" means incident field, \"out\" means reflected field) where\nformula_42\nwhich is a linear momentum density of electromagnetic field.\nIn the same way a phase-conjugated wave has an opposite angular momentum density vector formula_43 \nwith respect to incident field:\nformula_44\nThe above identities are valid \"locally\", i.e. in each space point formula_45 in a given moment formula_46 for an \"ideal phase-conjugating mirror\".\nQuantum picture.\nIn \"quantum electrodynamics\" the photon with energy formula_47 also possesses linear momentum formula_48 and angular momentum, whose projection on propagation axis is formula_49, where formula_50 is \"topological charge\" of photon, or winding number, formula_51 is propagation axis. The angular momentum projection on propagation axis has \"discrete values\" formula_52.\nIn \"quantum electrodynamics\" the interpretation of phase conjugation is much simpler compared to \"classical electrodynamics\". The photon reflected from phase conjugating-mirror (out) has opposite directions of linear and angular momenta with respect to incident photon (in):\nformula_53\nNonlinear optical pattern formation.\nOptical fields transmitted through nonlinear Kerr media can also display pattern formation owing to the nonlinear medium amplifying spatial and temporal noise. The effect is referred to as optical modulation instability. This has been observed both in photo-refractive, photonic lattices, as well as photo-reactive systems. In the latter case, optical nonlinearity is afforded by reaction-induced increases in refractive index. Examples of pattern formation are spatial solitons and vortex lattices in framework of nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger equation.\nMolecular nonlinear optics.\nThe early studies of nonlinear optics and materials focused on the inorganic solids. With the development of nonlinear optics, molecular optical properties were investigated, forming molecular nonlinear optics. The traditional approaches used in the past to enhance nonlinearities include extending chromophore \u03c0-systems, adjusting bond length alternation, inducing intramolecular charge transfer, extending conjugation in 2D, and engineering multipolar charge distributions. Recently, many novel directions were proposed for enhanced nonlinearity and light manipulation, including twisted chromophores, combining rich density of states with bond alternation, microscopic cascading of second-order nonlinearity, etc. Due to the distinguished advantages, molecular nonlinear optics have been widely used in the biophotonics field, including bioimaging, phototherapy, biosensing, etc.\nConnecting bulk properties to microscopic properties\nMolecular nonlinear optics relate optical properties of bulk matter to their microscopic molecular properties. Just as the polarizability can be described as a Taylor series expansion, one can expand the induced dipole moment in powers of the electric field: formula_54, where \u03bc is the polarizability, \u03b1 is the first hyperpolarizability, \u03b2 is the second hyperpolarizability, and so on.\nNovel Nonlinear Media\nCertain molecular materials have the ability to be optimized for their optical nonlinearity at the microscopic and bulk levels. Due to the delocalization of electrons in \u03c0 bonds electrons are more easily responsive to applied optical fields and tend to produce larger linear and nonlinear optical responses than those in single (\ud835\udf0e) bonds. In these systems linear response scales with the length of the conjugated pi system, while nonlinear response scales even more rapidly.\nOne of the many applications of molecular nonlinear optics is the use in nonlinear bioimaging. These nonlinear materials, like multi-photon chromophores, are used as biomarkers for two-photon spectroscopy, in which\u00a0 the attenuation of incident light intensity as it passes through the sample is written as formula_55.\nwhere N is the number of particles per unit volume, I is intensity of light, and \u03b4 is the two photon absorption cross section. The resulting signal adopts a Lorentzian lineshape with a cross-section proportional to the difference in dipole moments of ground and final states.\nSimilar highly conjugated chromophores with strong donor-acceptor characteristics are used due to their large difference in the dipole moments, and current efforts in extending their pi-conjugated systems to enhance their nonlinear optical properties are being made.\nCommon second-harmonic-generating (SHG) materials.\nOrdered by pump wavelength:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "21724", "revid": "24902", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21724", "title": "Normandy", "text": "Geographical and cultural region of France\nNormandy is a geographical and cultural region in northwestern Europe, roughly coextensive with the historical Duchy of Normandy.\nNormandy comprises mainland Normandy (a part of France) and insular Normandy (mostly the British Channel Islands). It covers . Its population in 2017 was 3,499,280. The inhabitants of Normandy are known as Normans; the region is the historic homeland of the Norman language. Large settlements include Rouen, Caen, Le Havre and Cherbourg.\nThe cultural region of Normandy is roughly similar to the historical Duchy of Normandy, which includes small areas now part of the departments of Mayenne and Sarthe. The Channel Islands (French: \"\u00celes Anglo-Normandes\") are also historically part of Normandy; they cover and comprise two bailiwicks: Guernsey and Jersey, which are British Crown Dependencies.\nNormandy's name comes from the settlement of the territory by Vikings (\"Northmen\") starting in the 9th century, and confirmed by treaty in the 10th century between King Charles III of France and the Viking \"jarl\" Rollo. For almost 150 years following the Norman conquest of England in 1066, Normandy and England were linked by having the same person reign as both Duke of Normandy and King of England.\nHistory.\nPrehistory.\nArchaeological finds, such as cave paintings, prove that humans were present in the region in prehistoric times. Normandy also has many megalithic monuments.\nHuman presence in the region does not date back earlier than the end of the Lower Paleolithic (before that, this region was extremely cold). In the Middle Paleolithic, it is attested by numerous finds of lithic industry. But, in the Upper Paleolithic, the region was occupied by tundra, which was not very favorable to human life. However, it would be inhabited again, as shown by the Gouy cave near Rouen, which, due to its parietal engravings dated to the Magdalenian, happens to be the northernmost decorated cave in Europe. In addition, many still-visible megaliths are scattered quite regularly throughout the Norman countryside. The Rozel archaeological site presents exceptional traces of footprints and handprints of \"Homo neanderthalensis\".\nBut it is truly only in the Bronze Age (between 2300 and 800 BC) that Normandy began to be developed. At this time, farms, field systems, and vast necropolises were established in the territory, forming an initial network of sites covering the whole of Norman land.\nThe discovery of objects such as the golden Gallic helmet of Amfreville-sous-les-Monts or the iron one from the Louviers museum, as well as sites such as the large P\u00eetres necropolis (Eure), with its cremation urns, coiled swords and traces of chariot tombs, or the necropolis of Ifs (Calvados), dating from the end of the Hallstatt period or the beginning of the La T\u00e8ne period, testify to Celtic presence in Normandy. The Celtic peoples of present-day Normandy were part of Armorica, a confederation of culturally close peoples along the shores of the English Channel and the Atlantic Ocean, from the estuary of the Seine to that of the Loire.\nThe testimony of Julius Caesar (in the \"Gallic Wars\") allows us to identify the different Gallic groups occupying the region. In 56 or 57 BC, these populations gathered to resist the invasion of the Roman legions. After the Gallic defeat at the siege of Alesia, the peoples of Normandy continued the struggle for some time, but by 51 BC, all of Gaul was subdued by Rome.\nBetween 27 BC and 15 BC, Emperor Augustus reorganized the Gallic territory and moved the Caletes and the Veliocasses into the province of Gallia Lugdunensis, whose capital was Lyon. The Romanization of Normandy, as elsewhere in the West, involved the construction of roads and towns.\nMany Gallo-Roman villas are known in Norman territory. Builders used local materials: flint, chalk, limestone, brick, wattle and daub. Heating of baths or certain rooms used the Roman hypocaust system (suburban villa at Vieux-la-Romaine).\nAgriculture provided wheat and flax, according to Pliny the Elder. Finally, in the Norman countryside of Antiquity, the \"fana\" (small square-centered temples of Celtic tradition) were numerous. One example is located west of Harfleur. Excavations have also revealed many terracotta statuettes of mother goddesses in Norman tombs and houses. Thus, at Vieil-\u00c9vreux, there existed one of the most important pilgrimage centers in Europe, which included a forum, Roman baths, a monumental basilica, two \"fana\" and the second largest theater in Gaul.\nFrom the second third of the 3rd century, \"barbarian\" raids devastated many places in the Norman region. The coastline had to face maritime piracy from the Saxons, but also from the Franks and Frisians. Germanic contingents were therefore recruited by the Roman army to fight against other Germans, and these immigrants were granted permission to settle in the Empire.\nDuring the reforms of Emperor Diocletian (285\u2013305), the future Normandy became distinct by forming the Lyonnaise Secunda, whose borders foreshadowed those of ducal Normandy seven centuries later: it stretched from the Couesnon to the Bresle and was bounded to the south by the upper courses of the Sarthe and the Avre. The only significant difference was that Lyonnaise Secunda included the future Vexin fran\u00e7ais, with the land of the Veliocasses then remaining undivided, and these immigrants were granted permission to settle in the Empire.\nCeltic period.\nCelts (also known as Belgae and Gauls) have populated Normandy since at least the Bronze Age. When Julius Caesar invaded Gaul (58\u201350 BC), there were nine different Celtic tribes living in this part of Gaul.\nRomanisation.\nThe Romanisation of this region partly included in the \"Gallia Celtica\" and in the \"Gallia Belgica\" (the Seine being more or less the limit between them) was achieved by the usual methods: Roman roads and a policy of urbanisation. Classicists mention many Gallo-Roman villas and archeology found their traces in the past 30 years. In the Late Roman Empire a new province was created and called \"Lugdunensis Secunda\", it sketched the later ecclesiastical province of Rouen, with the \"Metropolis civitas Rotomagensium\"\n(Rouen), \"Civitas Baiocassium\" (\"Augustodorum\", Bayeux), \"Civitas Abrincatum\" (\"Ingena\", Avranches), \"Civitas Ebroicorum\" (\"Mediolanum\", \u00c9vreux), \"Civitas Saiorum\" (S\u00e9es), \"Civitas Lexoviorum\" (\"Noviomagus\", Lisieux / Lieuvin) and \"Civitas Constantia\" (Coutances).\nGermanic invasions and settlements.\nIn the late 3rd century AD, Germanic raids devastated Lugdunensis Secunda, as the modern area of Normandy was known at the time. The Romans built a system of coastal defences known as Saxon Shore on both sides of the English Channel. Coastal settlements were raided by Saxon pirates that finally settled mainly in the Bessin region. Modern archeology reveals their presence in different Merovingian cemeteries excavated east of Caen. Christianity also began to enter the area during this period and Rouen already had a metropolitan bishop by the 4th century. The ecclesiastical province of Rouen was based on the frame of the Roman \"Lugdunensis Secunda\", whose limits corresponded almost exactly to the future duchy of Normandy. In 406, Germanic tribes began invading from the east, followed by dispersed settlements mainly in the Pays de Bray, Pays de Caux and Vexin. As early as 487, the area between the rivers Somme and Loire came under the control of the Frankish lord Clovis.\nThe Franks and the Scandinavian invasions.\nFrankish rule after Rome.\nFollowing the disintegration of Roman power in northern Gaul, the region that would later become Normandy passed under the control of the Franks. By the sixth and seventh centuries it was integrated into the Merovingian and later Carolingian realms. Large rural estates, episcopal sees such as Rouen, and fiscal centres marked Frankish authority. The Capitulary legislation and royal courts extended Frankish law and institutions into the area, though local aristocracies maintained significant autonomy.\nBy the ninth century, Carolingian kings such as Charlemagne and Louis the Pious maintained river defenses and fleets, but the weakening of central power after 840 created vulnerabilities. Political divisions between the heirs of Louis the Pious, as codified in the Treaty of Verdun (843), fractured the Frankish kingdom and left the Seine valley especially exposed to external attack.\nViking raids on the Seine.\nFrom the late eighth century, Scandinavian raiders targeted the coasts of northern Gaul. Monastic centres such as Jumi\u00e8ges Abbey and Saint-Wandrille were plundered repeatedly; Rouen itself was attacked and temporarily abandoned in 841. Viking fleets exploited the navigability of the Seine and its tributaries, sailing upriver to raid Paris in 845 under a leader recorded as Ragnar. Annals such as the \"Annales Bertiniani\" describe the devastation of monasteries and towns and the payment of tribute by Frankish rulers to secure temporary peace.\nOver time, groups of Scandinavians began to overwinter in the lower Seine valley, constructing fortified encampments and establishing trading outposts. Archaeological finds of weapon deposits, silver hoards and Scandinavian-style burials indicate semi-permanent settlement before 911.\nViking raids and foundation of the Norman state.\nVikings started to raid along the river Seine during the middle of the 9th century. As early as 841, a Viking fleet appeared at the mouth of the Seine, the principal route by which they entered the kingdom. After attacking and destroying monasteries, including one at Jumi\u00e8ges, they took advantage of the power vacuum created by the disintegration of Charlemagne's empire to take Northern France. The fiefdom of Normandy was created for the Viking leader \"Hr\u00f3lfr\", known in Medieval Latin as \"Rollo\". Rollo had besieged Paris but in 911 entered vassalage to the king of the West Franks, Charles the Simple, through the Treaty of Saint-Clair-sur-Epte. In exchange for his homage and fealty, Rollo legally gained the territory that he and his Viking allies had previously conquered. The name \"Normandy\" reflects Rollo's Viking (\"Norseman\") origins.\nThe Treaty of Saint-Clair-sur-Epte (911).\nThe turning point came in 911, when a major Viking host under the leadership of Rollo (Old Norse \"Hr\u00f3lfr\", Latin \"Rollo\" or \"Rolf\") clashed with West Frankish forces near Chartres. Following negotiations, King Charles the Simple and Rollo concluded an agreement, known as the Treaty of Saint-Clair-sur-Epte. According to later tradition, the treaty granted Rollo and his followers land around the lower Seine, centered on Rouen, in return for conversion to Christianity, homage to the king, and an obligation to defend the coast against further Viking attacks.\nWhile the exact extent of the original grant is debated, it likely encompassed the Rouen region and surrounding territory. Over subsequent decades, Rollo's successors expanded this domain westward to include the Cotentin and eastward into the Pays de Caux, laying the foundations of the Duchy of Normandy.\nThe descendants of \"Rollo\" and his followers created an aristocracy that step by step adopted the local Gallo-Romance language, intermarried with the area's native Gallo-Frankish inhabitants, and adopted Christianity. Nevertheless, the first generations of Scandinavian and Anglo-Scandinavian settlers brought slaves, mainly from the British Isles, and often turned the women into \"frilla\", a Scandinavian tradition which became known as \"more Danico\", medieval Latin meaning \"Danish marriage\". The first counts of Rouen and the dukes of Normandy had concubines too. While very little archeological excavations about the Vikings were done in Normandy, the Norman toponymy retains a large Scandinavian and Anglo-Scandinavian heritage, due to a constant use of Old Norse during four or five generations in certain parts of Normandy.\nThey then became the Normans \u2013 a Norman French-speaking mixture of Norsemen and indigenous Gallo-Franks.\nRollo's descendant William became king of England in 1066 after defeating Harold Godwinson, the last of the Anglo-Saxon kings, at the Battle of Hastings, while retaining the fiefdom of Normandy for himself and his descendants.\nNorman chroniclers and historical memory.\nThe earliest extended narrative of the Norman foundation is the \"Historia Normannorum\" of Dudo of Saint-Quentin, composed around 1015\u20131030 for Duke Richard I and Richard II. Dudo presents Rollo as a pious founder and constructs a genealogy linking the dukes with both Frankish royalty and heroic Scandinavian origins. Though literary and partisan, Dudo's account shaped later chronicles such as those of William of Jumi\u00e8ges and Orderic Vitalis, and influenced medieval and modern views of the Norman beginnings.\nNorman expansion.\nAside from the conquest of England and the subsequent invasions of Wales and Ireland, the Normans expanded into other areas. Norman families, such as that of Tancred of Hauteville, Rainulf Drengot and Guimond de Moulins played important parts in the conquest of southern Italy and the Crusades.\nThe Drengot lineage, de Hauteville's sons William Iron Arm, Drogo, and Humphrey, Robert Guiscard and Roger the Great Count progressively claimed territories in southern Italy until founding the Kingdom of Sicily in 1130. They also carved out a place for themselves and their descendants in the Crusader states of Asia Minor and the Holy Land.\nThe 14th-century explorer Jean de B\u00e9thencourt established a kingdom in the Canary Islands in 1404. He received the title King of the Canary Islands from Pope Innocent VII but recognized Henry III of Castile as his overlord, who had provided him with military and financial aid during the conquest.\nIntegration and the rise of the Norman duchy.\nOver the tenth century the Scandinavian newcomers gradually merged with the Frankish population. Rollo's baptism and the establishment of a Norman episcopate symbolized Christianization, while intermarriage and bilingualism facilitated cultural assimilation. By the mid-eleventh century the dukes of Normandy commanded a polity that blended Scandinavian martial traditions with Frankish legal, ecclesiastical and feudal practices.\n13th to 17th centuries.\nIn 1204, during the reign of John, King of England, mainland Normandy was captured from the English by the forces of Philip II of France, ending some 293 years of relative Norman independence from the French crown. Insular Normandy (the Channel Islands) remained under control of the English, though still attached to the ecclesiastical province of Rouen. In the 1259 Treaty of Paris, Henry III of England recognized the legitimacy of the French possession of mainland Normandy. His successors, however, often fought to regain control of their ancient fiefdom.\nThe \"Charte aux Normands\" granted by Louis X of France in 1315 (and later re-confirmed in 1339) \u2013 like the analogous Magna Carta granted in England in the aftermath of 1204 \u2013 guaranteed the liberties and privileges of the province of Normandy.\nNormandy was devastated by various civil wars and the Hundred Years' War. Between 1419 and 1450, the English controlled all of Normandy apart from Mont-Saint-Michel, and made Rouen the seat of their power in France. Normandy ultimately saw its population decline by three quarters as a result of the various conflicts which took place in the region during the late Middle Ages. Afterwards, prosperity returned to Normandy until the Wars of Religion. When many Norman towns (Alen\u00e7on, Rouen, Caen, Coutances, Bayeux) joined the Protestant Reformation, battles ensued throughout the province. In the Channel Islands, a period of Calvinism following the Reformation was suppressed when Anglicanism was imposed following the Stuart Restoration.\nSamuel de Champlain left the port of Honfleur in 1604 and founded Acadia. Four years later, he founded the City of Qu\u00e9bec. From then onwards, Normans engaged in a policy of expansion in North America. They continued the exploration of the New World: Ren\u00e9-Robert Cavelier de La Salle travelled in the area of the Great Lakes, then on the Mississippi River. Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville and his brother Lemoyne de Bienville founded Louisiana, Biloxi, Mobile and New Orleans. Territories located between Qu\u00e9bec and the Mississippi Delta were opened up to establish Canada and Louisiana. Colonists from Normandy were among the most active in New France, comprising Acadia, Canada, and Louisiana.\nHonfleur and Le Havre were two of the principal slave trade ports of France.\n18th century to present.\nAlthough agriculture remained important, industries such as weaving, metallurgy, sugar refining, ceramics, and shipbuilding were introduced and developed.\nIn the 1780s, the economic crisis and the crisis of the \"Ancien R\u00e9gime\" struck Normandy as well as other parts of the nation, leading to the French Revolution. Bad harvests, technical progress and the effects of the Eden Agreement signed in 1786 affected employment and the economy of the province. Normans laboured under a heavy fiscal burden.\nIn 1790, the five departments of Normandy replaced the former province.\nOn 13 July 1793, the Norman Charlotte Corday assassinated Jean-Paul Marat.\nThe Normans reacted little to the many political upheavals which characterized the 19th century. Overall, they warily accepted the changes of r\u00e9gime (First French Empire, Bourbon Restoration, July Monarchy, French Second Republic, Second French Empire, French Third Republic).\nFollowing the French Revolutionary Wars and the Napoleonic Wars (1792\u20131815), there was an economic revival that included the mechanization of textile manufacturing and the introduction of the first trains.\nAlso, with seaside tourism in the 19th century came the advent of the first beach resorts.\nDuring the Second World War, following the armistice of 22 June 1940, continental Normandy was part of the German occupied zone of France. The Channel Islands were occupied by German forces between 30 June 1940 and 9 May 1945. The town of Dieppe was the site of the unsuccessful Dieppe Raid by Allied forces.\nThe Allies coordinated a massive build-up of troops and supplies to support a large-scale invasion of Normandy in the D-Day landings on 6 June 1944 under the code name Operation Overlord. German forces dug into fortified emplacements above the beaches. Caen, Cherbourg, Carentan, Falaise and other Norman towns endured many casualties in the Battle of Normandy, which continued until the closing of the so-called Falaise gap between Chambois and Mont Ormel. The liberation of Le Havre followed. This was a significant turning point in the war in western Europe and led to the restoration of the French Republic.\nThe remainder of Normandy was liberated by Allied forces only on 9 May 1945 at the end of the war, when the Channel Island occupation effectively ended.\nDespite the renunciation of the Duke of Normandy title by Henry III of England in the 1259 Treaty of Paris, and the extinction of the duchy itself in modern-day, republican France, in the Channel Islands the monarch of the United Kingdom (whether a king or queen) is regardless still sometimes informally referred to by the title \"Duke of Normandy\".\nGeography.\nThe historical Duchy of Normandy was a formerly independent duchy occupying the lower Seine area, the Pays de Caux and the region to the west through the Pays d'Auge as far as the Cotentin Peninsula and Channel Islands.\nWestern Normandy belongs to the Armorican Massif, while most of the region lies in the Paris Basin. France's oldest rocks are exposed in Jobourg, on the Cotentin peninsula. The region is bounded to the north and west by the English Channel. There are granite cliffs in the west and limestone cliffs in the east. There are also long stretches of beach in the centre of the region. The \"bocage\" typical of the western areas caused problems for the invading forces in the Battle of Normandy. A notable feature of the landscape is created by the meanders of the Seine as it approaches its estuary.\nThe highest point is the Signal d'\u00c9couves (417\u00a0m), in the Armorican Massif.\nNormandy is sparsely forested: 12.8% of the territory is wooded, compared to a French average of 23.6%, although the proportion varies between the departments. Eure has the most cover, at 21%, while Manche has the least, at 4%, a characteristic shared with the Channel Islands.\nSub-regions.\nInsular Normandy (Channel Islands).\nThe Channel Islands are considered culturally and historically a part of Normandy. However, they are British Crown Dependencies, and are not part of the modern French administrative region of Normandy.\nAlthough the British surrendered claims to mainland Normandy, France, and other French possessions in 1801, the monarch of the United Kingdom retains the title Duke of Normandy in respect to the Channel Islands. The Channel Islands (except for Chausey) remain Crown Dependencies of the British Crown in the present era. Thus the Loyal Toast in the Channel Islands is \"Le Roi, notre Duc\" (\"The King, our Duke\"). The British monarch is understood to \"not\" be the Duke with regards to mainland Normandy described herein, by virtue of the Treaty of Paris of 1259, the surrender of French possessions in 1801, and the belief that the rights of succession to that title are subject to Salic Law which excludes inheritance through female heirs.\nRivers.\nRivers in Normandy include:\nAnd many coastal rivers:\nPolitics.\nMainland Normandy.\nThe modern region of Normandy was created by the territorial reform of French Regions in 2014 by the merger of Lower Normandy, and Upper Normandy. The new region took effect on 1 January 2016, after the regional elections in December 2015.\nThe Regional Council has 102 members who are elected under a system of proportional representation. The executive consists of a president and vice-presidents. Herv\u00e9 Morin from the Centre party was elected president of the council in January 2016.\nChannel Islands.\nThe Channel Islands are not part of French territory, but are instead British Crown Dependencies. They are self-governing, each having its own parliament, government and legal system. The head of state of both territories is Charles III and each have an appointed Lieutenant-Governor.\nThe Bailiwick of Guernsey comprises three separate jurisdictions: Guernsey, Alderney and Sark. Administratively, Herm forms part of Guernsey.\nEconomy.\nMuch of Normandy is predominantly agricultural in character, with cattle breeding the most important sector (although in decline from the peak levels of the 1970s and 1980s). The \"bocage\" is a patchwork of small fields with high hedges, typical of western areas. Areas near the Seine (the former Upper Normandy region) contain a higher concentration of industry. Normandy is a significant cider-producing region, and also produces calvados, a distilled cider or apple brandy. Other activities of economic importance are dairy produce, flax (60% of production in France), horse breeding (including two French national stud farms), fishing, seafood, and tourism. The region contains three French nuclear power stations.\nThere is also easy access to and from the UK using the ports of Cherbourg, Caen (Ouistreham), Le Havre and Dieppe. Jersey and Guernsey are often considered to be tax havens, due to having large financial services sectors and low tax rates.\nDemographics.\nIn January 2006 the population of French Normandy (including the part of Perche which lies inside the Orne \"d\u00e9partement\" but excluding the Channel Islands) was estimated at 3,260,000 with an average population density of 109 inhabitants per km2, just under the French national average, but rising to 147 for Upper Normandy. The population of the Channel Islands is estimated around 174,000 (2021).\nThe main cities (population given from the 1999 census) are Rouen (518,316 in the metropolitan area), the capital since 2016 of the province and formerly of Upper Normandy; Caen (420,000 in the metropolitan area) and formerly the capital of Lower Normandy; Le Havre (296,773 in the metropolitan area); and Cherbourg (117,855 in the metropolitan area).\nCulture.\nFlag.\nThe traditional provincial flag of Normandy, \"gules, two leopards passant or\", is used in the region and its predecessors. The three-leopard version (known in the Norman language as \"les treis cats\", \"the three cats\") is used by some associations and individuals, especially those who support cultural links with the Channel Islands and England. Jersey and Guernsey use three leopards in their national symbols. The leopards represents the strength and courage Normandy has towards the neighbouring provinces.\nThe unofficial anthem of the region is the song \"Ma Normandie\".\nLanguage.\nThe Norman language, including its insular variations J\u00e8rriais and Guern\u00e9siais, is a regional language, spoken by a minority of the population on the continent and the islands, with a concentration in the Cotentin Peninsula in the far west (the Cotentinais dialect), and in the Pays de Caux in the East (the Cauchois dialect).\nMany words and place names demonstrate the Old English and Norse (Anglo-Scandinavian) influence in this O\u00efl language; for example, words : \"mauve\" (seagull), \"fifotte\" (starfish), \"h\u00e2\" (catshark), \"mucre\" (humid, wet), \"(\u00e9)griller\" (slide, slip), \"fale\" (throat), etc. place-names : \"-bec\" (stream), \"-fleur\" (river), \"-hou\" (island), \"-tot\" (homestead), \"-dal\" / \"-dalle\" (valley), \"Hogue\" / \"Hougue\" (hill, mound), \"-lon\" / \"-londe\" (grove, wood), \"-vy\" / \"-vic\" (bay, cove), \"-mare\" (pond), \"-beuf\" (booth, cabin), etc. French is the only official language in continental Normandy and English is also an official language in the Channel Islands.\nArchitecture.\nArchitecturally, Norman cathedrals, abbeys (such as the Abbey of Bec) and castles characterise the former duchy in a way that mirrors the similar pattern of Norman architecture in England following the Norman Conquest of 1066.\nDomestic architecture in upper Normandy is typified by half-timbered buildings that also recall vernacular English architecture, although the farm enclosures of the more harshly landscaped Pays de Caux are a more idiosyncratic response to socio-economic and climatic imperatives. Much urban architectural heritage was destroyed during the Battle of Normandy in 1944 \u2013 post-war urban reconstruction, such as in Le Havre and Saint-L\u00f4, could be said to demonstrate both the virtues and vices of modernist and brutalist trends of the 1950s and 1960s. Le Havre, the city rebuilt by Auguste Perret, was added to Unesco's World Heritage List in 2005.\nVernacular architecture in lower Normandy takes its form from granite, the predominant local building material. The Channel Islands also share this influence \u2013 Chausey was for many years a source of quarried granite, including that used for the construction of Mont Saint-Michel.\nThe south part of Bagnoles-de-l'Orne is filled with bourgeois villas in \"Belle \u00c9poque\" style with polychrome fa\u00e7ades, bow windows and unique roofing. This area, built between 1886 and 1914, has an authentic \"Bagnolese\" style and is typical of high-society country vacation of the time. The Chapel of Saint Germanus (\"Chapelle Saint-Germain\") at Querqueville with its trefoil floorplan incorporates elements of one of the earliest surviving places of Christian worship in the Cotentin \u2013 perhaps second only to the Gallo-Roman baptistry at Port-Bail. It is dedicated to Germanus of Normandy.\nGastronomy.\nParts of Normandy consist of rolling countryside typified by pasture for dairy cattle and apple orchards. A wide range of dairy products are produced and exported. Norman cheeses include Camembert, Livarot, Pont l'\u00c9v\u00eaque, Brillat-Savarin, Neufch\u00e2tel, Petit Suisse and Boursin. Normandy butter and Normandy cream are lavishly used in gastronomic specialties. Jersey and Guernsey cattle are famous cattle breeds worldwide, especially to North America.\nTurbot and oysters from the Cotentin Peninsula are major delicacies throughout France. Normandy is the chief oyster-cultivating, scallop-exporting, and mussel-raising region in France.\nNormandy is a major cider-producing region (very little wine is produced). Perry is also produced, but in less significant quantities. Apple brandy, of which the most famous variety is calvados, is also popular. The mealtime \"trou normand\", or \"Norman hole\", is a pause between meal courses in which diners partake of a glassful of calvados in order to improve the appetite and make room for the next course, and this is still observed in many homes and restaurants. \"Pommeau\" is an \"ap\u00e9ritif\" produced by blending unfermented cider and apple brandy. Another aperitif is the \"kir normand\", a measure of cr\u00e8me de cassis topped up with cider. \"B\u00e9n\u00e9dictine\" is produced in F\u00e9camp.\nOther regional specialities include \"tripes \u00e0 la mode de Caen\", \"andouilles\" and \"andouillettes\", , salt meadow (\"pr\u00e9 sal\u00e9\") lamb, seafood (mussels, scallops, lobsters, mackerel...), and \"teurgoule\" (spiced rice pudding).\nNormandy dishes include duckling \"\u00e0 la rouennaise\", saut\u00e9ed chicken \"yvetois\", and goose \"en daube\". Rabbit is cooked with morels, or \"\u00e0 la havraise\" (stuffed with truffled pigs' trotters). Other dishes are sheep's trotters \"\u00e0 la rouennaise\", casseroled veal, larded calf's liver braised with carrots, and veal (or turkey) in cream and mushrooms.\nNormandy is also noted for its pastries. Normandy turns out \"douillons\" (pears baked in pastry), \"craquelins\", \"roulettes\" in Rouen, \"fouaces\" in Caen, \"fallues\" in Lisieux, \"sabl\u00e9s\" in Lisieux. It is the birthplace of brioches (especially those from \u00c9vreux and Gisors). Confectionery of the region includes Rouen apple sugar, Isigny caramels, Bayeux mint chews, Falaise berlingots, Le Havre marzipans, Argentan \"croquettes\", and Rouen macaroons.\nNormandy is the native land of Taillevent, cook of the kings of France Charles V and Charles VI. He wrote the earliest French cookery book named \"Le Viandier\". \"Confiture de lait\" was also made in Normandy around the 14th century.\nLiterature.\nThe dukes of Normandy commissioned and inspired epic literature to record and legitimise their rule. Wace, Orderic Vitalis and Stephen of Rouen were among those who wrote in the service of the dukes. After the division of 1204, French literature provided the model for the development of literature in Normandy. Olivier Basselin wrote of the Vaux de Vire, the origin of literary \"vaudeville\". Notable Norman writers include Jean Marot, R\u00e9my Belleau, Guy de Maupassant, Jules Barbey d'Aurevilly, Gustave Flaubert, Octave Mirbeau, and Remy de Gourmont, and Alexis de Tocqueville. The Corneille brothers, Pierre and Thomas, born in Rouen, were great figures of French classical literature.\nDavid Ferrand (1591\u20131660) in his \"Muse Normande\" established a landmark of Norman language literature. In the 16th and 17th centuries, the workers and merchants of Rouen established a tradition of polemical and satirical literature in a form of language called the \"parler purin\". At the end of the 18th century and beginning of the 19th century, a new movement arose in the Channel Islands, led by writers such as George M\u00e9tivier, which sparked a literary renaissance on the Norman mainland. In exile in Jersey and then Guernsey, Victor Hugo took an interest in the vernacular literature. \"Les Travailleurs de la mer\" is a well-known novel by Hugo set in the Channel Islands. The boom in insular literature in the early 19th century encouraged production especially in La Hague and around Cherbourg, where Alfred Rossel, Louis Beuve and C\u00f4tis-Capel became active. The typical medium for literary expression in Norman has traditionally been newspaper columns and almanacs. The novel \"Zabeth\" by Andr\u00e9 Louis which appeared in 1969 was the first novel published in Norman.\nPainting.\nNormandy has a rich tradition of painting and gave to France some of its most important artists.\nIn the 17th century, some major French painters were Normans like Nicolas Poussin, born in Les Andelys and Jean Jouvenet.\nRomanticism drew painters to the Channel coasts of Normandy. Richard Parkes Bonington and J. M. W. Turner crossed the Channel from Great Britain, attracted by the light and landscapes. Th\u00e9odore G\u00e9ricault, a native of Rouen, was a notable figure in the Romantic movement, its famous \"Radeau de la M\u00e9duse\" being considered come the breakthrough of pictorial romanticism in France when it was officially presented at the Salon of 1819. The competing Realist tendency was represented by Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Millet, a native of La Hague. The landscape painter Eug\u00e8ne Boudin, born in Honfleur, was a determining influence on the impressionists and was highly considered by Monet.\nBreaking away from the more formalised and classical themes of the early part of the 19th century, Impressionist painters preferred to paint outdoors, in natural light, and to concentrate on landscapes, towns and scenes of daily life.\nLeader of the movement and father of modern painting, Claude Monet is one of the best known Impressionists and a major character in Normandy's artistic heritage. His house and gardens at Giverny are one of the region's major tourist sites, much visited for their beauty and their water lilies, as well as for their importance to Monet's artistic inspiration. Normandy was at the heart of his creation, from the paintings of Rouen's cathedral to the famous depictions of the cliffs at \u00c9tretat, the beach and port at F\u00e9camp and the sunrise at Le Havre. It was \"Impression, Sunrise\", Monet's painting of Le Havre, that led to the movement being dubbed Impressionism. After Monet, all the main avant-garde painters of the 1870s and 1880s came to Normandy to paint its landscapes and its changing lights, concentrating along the Seine valley and the Norman coast.\nLandscapes and scenes of daily life were also immortalised on canvas by artists that have included : William Turner, Gustave Courbet, the Honfleur born Eug\u00e8ne Boudin, Camille Pissarro, Alfred Sisley, Auguste Renoir, Gustave Caillebotte, Eug\u00e8ne Chigot, Paul Gauguin, Georges Seurat, Paul Signac, Pierre Bonnard, Georges Braque and Pablo Picasso. While Monet's work adorns galleries and collections all over the world, a remarkable quantity of Impressionist works can be found in galleries throughout Normandy, such as the Museum of Fine Arts in Rouen, the Mus\u00e9e Eug\u00e8ne Boudin in Honfleur or the Andr\u00e9 Malraux Museum in Le Havre.\nMaurice Denis, one of the leaders and theoricists of the Nabis movement in the 1890s, was a native of Granville, in the department of Manche. Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Auffray, an expressionist painter and member of the French resistance during WWII, lived and painted in the village of \u00c9chauffour.\nThe \"Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Normande de Peinture Moderne\" was founded in 1909 by Pierre Dumont, Robert Antoine Pinchon, Yvonne Barbier and Eug\u00e8ne Tirvert. Among members were Raoul Dufy, a native of Le Havre, Albert Marquet, Francis Picabia and Maurice Utrillo. Also in this movement were the Duchamp brothers, Jacques Villon and Marcel Duchamp, considered one of the father of modern art, also natives of Normandy. Jean Dubuffet, one of the leading French artist of the 1940s and the 1950s was born in Le Havre.\nReligion.\nChristian missionaries implanted monastic communities in the territory in the 5th and 6th centuries. Some of these missionaries came from across the Channel. The influence of Celtic Christianity can still be found in the Cotentin. By the terms of the treaty of Saint-Clair-sur-Epte, Rollo, a Viking pagan, accepted Christianity and was baptised. The Duchy of Normandy was therefore formally a Christian state from its foundation. The cathedrals of Normandy have exerted influence down the centuries in matters of both faith and politics. King Henry II of England did penance at the cathedral of Avranches on 21 May 1172 and was absolved from the censures incurred by the assassination of Thomas Becket. Mont Saint-Michel is a historic pilgrimage site.\nNormandy does not have one generally agreed patron saint, although this title has been ascribed to Saint Michael, and to Saint Ouen. Many saints have been revered in Normandy down the centuries, including:\nSince the 1905 French law on the Separation of the Churches and the State, there is no established church in mainland Normandy. In the Channel Islands, the Church of England is the established church.\n\"See \"\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "21725", "revid": "50997522", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21725", "title": "Neuromancer", "text": "1984 science fiction novel by William Gibson\nNeuromancer is a 1984 science fiction novel by American-Canadian author William Gibson. Set in a near-future dystopia, the narrative follows Case, a computer hacker enlisted into a crew by a powerful artificial intelligence and a traumatised former soldier to complete a high-stakes heist. It was Gibson's debut novel and, after its success, served as the first entry in the Sprawl trilogy, followed by \"Count Zero\" (1986) and \"Mona Lisa Overdrive\" (1988).\nGibson had primarily written countercultural short stories for science-fiction periodicals before \"Neuromancer\". Influences on the novel include the detective stories of Raymond Chandler, the comic art of Jean Giraud, and William S. Burroughs's \"Naked Lunch\" (1959). \"Neuromancer\" expanded and popularised the setting and concepts of an earlier Gibson story, \"Burning Chrome\" (1981), which introduced cyberspace\u2014a digital space traversable by humans\u2014and \"jacking in\", a bio-mechanical method of interfacing with computers.\n\"Neuromancer\" is a foundational work of early cyberpunk, although critics differ on whether the novel ignited the genre or if it was lifted by its inevitable rise. They agree it highlighted the genre's key features, like the placement of technological advancement against societal decay and criminality. Gibson's novel also defined the major conventions and terminology of the genre\u2014cyberspace, jacking in, and Intrusion Countermeasure Electronics (ICE). Critics discuss the novel in the historical context of the 1970s and 1980s, a period marked by conservatism, deregulation, and free-market economics.\n\"Neuromancer\" was released without significant hype but became an underground hit through word of mouth. Following release, it received critical acclaim and transformed the science-fiction genre. Mainstream recognition raised Gibson from relative obscurity. It remains the first and only novel to win all three of the Hugo Award, the Nebula Award for Best Novel, and the Philip K. Dick Award. It has been regarded as a classic work of the cyberpunk genre and, in 2005, was named one of \"Time\"'s All-Time 100 Novels.\nBackground.\nAuthor and composition.\nIn 1981, William Gibson worked as a teaching assistant at his alma mater, the University of British Columbia. In the same year, his Nebula Award-nominated short story \"Johnny Mnemonic\" introduced one of \"Neuromancer\"'s main characters, Molly. \"Johnny Mnemonic\" infused elements of crime fiction, like marginalised communities and criminal society, with technology, blurring the boundary of human and machine. The setting of the Sprawl and the concept of cyberspace first appeared in \"Omni\" the following year in his short story \"Burning Chrome\", and were popularised by \"Neuromancer\". Later in 1981, Gibson was commissioned to write a novel by science-fiction editor Terry Carr for his second series of Ace Science Fiction Specials; he submitted an outline later that year with the working title \"Jacked In\", eventually renaming it \"Neuromancer\". Gibson did not understand computing or networking in much detail, primarily wanting the shared vocabulary surrounding the topics.\nThe novel underwent considerable revision, with Gibson saying he rewrote the first two-thirds twelve times to ensure there was both stylistic consistency and a \"vaguely plausible\" plot. Gibson sought to eliminate \"clunk\", contracting his prose to ensure \"individual parts carry more weight\". He did not write the novel with a concrete outline, or initially know how it would end, writing the novel in \"blind animal panic\" because he thought it would fail if he did not hold the reader's attention. Gibson added the novel's final sentence (\"He never saw Molly again.\") to prevent himself from writing a sequel.\nInspiration.\n\"Neuromancer\" has many literary progenitors. Detective fiction, like the work of Raymond Chandler, is frequently cited as an influence on \"Neuromancer.\" For example, critics note similarities between Gibson's Case and Chandler's Philip Marlowe: Case is described as a \"cowboy\" and a \"detective\" and is involved in a heist; Molly, the novel's primary female character, has connections to the \"molls\" of 1940s film noir. Case's illegal practices, like theft and murder, situate him within a wider tradition of transgressive detectives, like the opiate addiction of Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes. Gibson stated that the pulp noir core of the novel was key to engaging his readers, and cited the works of Dashiell Hammett and Robert Stone as major influences on its style. For dialogue, the author incorporated late 1960s Toronto drug dealer and biker slang into the novel. Gibson imagined the novel's time frame as the 2030s but purposefully omitted explicit dates; he said the novel, and its sequels, were written to reflect the 1980s.\nGibson's prose style\u2014fast-paced, fragmented imagery\u2014resembles the styles of William S. Burroughs and J. G. Ballard. Burroughs's \"Naked Lunch\" (1959) is frequently cited by critics as an influence on \"Neuromancer\", including by one as its \"principal source\", as a literary predecessor of Gibson's \"cyberspace\". Gibson's conception of cyberspace was compared by Samuel R. Delany to Roger Zelazny's early short stories; Delany and other critics have explored the character of Molly as a development on the cyborg assassin of Joanna Russ's \"The Female Man\" (1975).\nVisual media likewise impacted the style of \"Neuromancer\". Gibson has repeatedly mentioned the artwork of the 1970s French magazine \"M\u00e9tal Hurlant\", with critics noting the proto-cyberpunk aesthetic of Jean \"Moebius\" Giraud's \"The Long Tomorrow\" (1976), republished in the American \"Heavy Metal\" magazine in 1977. John Carpenter's \"Escape from New York\" (1981) influenced Gibson's approach to world-building, pointing to throwaway lines that suggested much about the film's world and its history beyond the narrative itself. Upon seeing Ridley Scott's \"Blade Runner\" (1982), Gibson worried readers would think he had copied the film's \"fine visual texture\". Gibson wrote in his introduction to the graphic novel of \"Neuromancer\" that \"Blade Runner\" was not a conscious influence; in a later interview, he recounted a lunch with Scott where they both acknowledged a shared debt to Moebius's work in \"M\u00e9tal Hurlant\".\nPlot.\nCase is a low-level hustler in the dystopian underworld of Chiba City, Japan. Once a talented computer hacker and \"console cowboy\", Case was caught stealing from his employer, who retaliated by damaging Case's central nervous system, leaving him unable to access the virtual reality dataspace called the \"matrix\". Case is approached by Molly, an augmented \"razorgirl\" and mercenary on behalf of a shadowy US ex-military officer named Armitage, who offers to cure Case in exchange for his services as a hacker. Case undergoes the cure, but discovers that Armitage has sabotaged him with a time-delayed poison. If Case completes the job, Armitage will disarm the poison; if not, he will find himself crippled again.\nArmitage has Case and Molly steal a ROM module that contains the saved consciousness of one of Case's mentors, legendary hacker McCoy Pauley. Suspicious of his motives and the unusual nature of the job, Molly and Case begin to investigate Armitage on the side. They discover that Armitage is actually Colonel Willis Corto, the only survivor of the failed anti-Soviet mission \"Screaming Fist\". He was returned to the United States for extensive psychotherapy and reconstructive surgery, but snapped after learning that the government had been aware the mission would likely fail and went ahead with it regardless. He killed his handler and disappeared into the criminal underworld, eventually resurfacing under the name Armitage.\nIn Istanbul, the team recruits Peter Riviera, a sociopathic thief and drug addict. The trail leads Case to Wintermute, an artificial intelligence created by the eccentric Tessier-Ashpool family. The Tessier-Ashpools spend their time in rotating cryonic preservation in their home, the Villa Straylight. The Villa is located on Freeside, a cylindrical space habitat which functions as a Las Vegas-style space resort for the wealthy.\nWintermute reveals itself to Case and explains that it is one half of a super-AI entity planned by the family. It is programmed with a need to merge with its other half, Neuromancer, but because of the severe restrictions placed on AI programs by the Turing Registry, it cannot achieve this on its own. It has manipulated and recruited Armitage and his team to bring it into contact with Neuromancer, access to which is physically secured within the Villa Straylight. Case is tasked with entering cyberspace to pierce the software barriers around Neuromancer with an icebreaker program. Riviera is to obtain the password to the physical terminal from Lady 3Jane Marie-France Tessier-Ashpool, the only member of the family awake and at the Villa. The group solicits help from a Rastafarian cluster on board Freeside, living in a separate area they call Zion.\nArmitage's personality starts to disintegrate and he begins to believe he is back in Screaming Fist. It is revealed that Wintermute had originally contacted Corto through a computer during his psychotherapy, during which time he manipulated Corto to create the Armitage persona. As Corto breaks through, he becomes violently unstable and Wintermute ejects him into space.\nRiviera meets Lady 3Jane and betrays the team, helping Lady 3Jane and Hideo, her ninja bodyguard, capture Molly. Under orders from Wintermute, Case tracks Molly down. Neuromancer traps Case within a simulated reality after he enters cyberspace. He finds the consciousness of Linda Lee, his girlfriend from Chiba City, who was murdered by one of his underworld contacts. He also meets Neuromancer, who takes the form of a young boy. Neuromancer tries to convince Case to remain in the virtual world with Linda, but Case refuses.\nWith Wintermute guiding them, Case goes to confront Lady 3Jane, Riviera, and Hideo. Riviera tries to kill Case, but Lady 3Jane is sympathetic towards Case and Molly, and Hideo protects him. Riviera flees, and Molly explains that he is doomed anyway, as she had spiked his drugs with a lethal toxin. The team makes it to the computer terminal. Case enters cyberspace to guide the icebreaker; Lady 3Jane gives her password, and the lock opens. Wintermute unites with Neuromancer, becoming a superconsciousness. The poison in Case's bloodstream is washed out and he and Molly are profusely paid, while Pauley's ROM construct is apparently erased at his own request.\nMolly leaves Case, who finds a new girlfriend and resumes his hacking work. Wintermute/Neuromancer contacts him, claiming it has become \"the sum total of the works, the whole show\" and is looking for others like itself. Having scanned recorded transmissions, the super-AI finds a transmission from the Alpha Centauri star system, not decoded or interpreted before. This implies that there is an alien super-AI in the Centauri system, so first contact is being made between AI's, instead of humankind and alien lifeforms.\nWhile logged into cyberspace, Case glimpses Neuromancer standing in the distance with Linda Lee, and himself. He also hears inhuman laughter, which suggests that Pauley still lives. The sighting implies that Neuromancer created a copy of Case's consciousness, which now exists in cyberspace with those of Linda and Pauley.\nContext and interpretation.\nPolitical and economic.\n\"Neuromancer\", its sequels and other cyberpunk stories are often discussed within the socio-economic context of the 1980s, a period of economic restructuring, corporate globalization, and government deregulation. In the 1990s, a particularly influential view was that the novel reflected the \"dilemmas of post-Fordist work and life\", with Gibson reflecting or recreating the societal change brought on by the economic and industrial changes of the 1970s and 1980s. Cyberspace's reliance on the circulation of data can be understood as a metaphor for the global circulation of financial capital, and its addictiveness parodies the culture of workaholism among Silicon Valley developers. His protagonists have been identified as resembling contract workers, with Case dependent on diazepam to cope with the barrage of \"relentless and fragmented data [and] get through the workday\". The novel's characters represent the professional\u2013managerial class and the novel was popular with the demographic.\nWhile the novel represents anxiety about societal change, it is not generally viewed as being about resisting it. Gibson's protagonists do not threaten the social order of his worlds. Corporations view the novel's freelance criminal protagonists as another tool at their disposal. Gibson's inexperience as an author led to the novel capturing the essence of 1980s inequality but reinforcing and appealing to the dominant power structure, leaving his \"dead-cynicism [and] fashionable survival\". Caroline Alphin writes that human life is worth whatever it is worth to an employer. After his nervous system is damaged and he loses his ability to work as a hacker, Case must murder people for money to replenish his human capital because of Chiba City's neoliberalist order; Caroline Alpin describes this death in the novel as \"failure to maximise one's human capital\". The novel shows that human minds can be saved to read-only memory, preserving deceased or unwilling people's technical skills for at-will use by corporations.\nTechnological.\nGibson's generation was the first to write science fiction at a time when the genre's concepts were becoming part of daily life. Gibson recognised, and benefitted from, the growing public fascination with the evolving technology landscape, and used these concerns to \"create an entire cultural vocabulary\", merging the language of human experience with the electronic. Bruce Sterling relates the cyborg to the increasing use of technology that directly interfaces with the human body, citing contact lenses and the Sony Walkman.\nRacial.\nSeveral critics have explored the in-orbit Rastafarian cluster called Zion. Scholar Andrew Strombeck writes that their vocabulary is distinct from the jargon used elsewhere, but notes that the portrayal embodies stereotypes about Rastafarians. He highlights both the group's origin as a labor protest movement and that they are the only group to perform manual labor in the novel. Their society could provide an alternative to corporate hegemony but ultimately form \"another node in the capitalist network\". Samuel R. Delany, an African-American writer, criticized the portrayal, but described \"Neuromancer\" as \"an extraordinary book\". He regarded Zion as a stereotyped and marginalized group with \"shrunken hearts\", easily manipulated by the AI Wintermute. He describes Gibson's portrayal of their spirituality as reductive and superficial. Tom Moylan notes that \"Neuromancer\" loses its \"critical edge\" in exploring Zion's within the primary narrative, and describes a pattern in Gibson's \"Sprawl\" trilogy of including the racial Other but limiting their role to \"happy helper\".\nGenre.\nWhen Gibson was writing \"Neuromancer\", the term \"cyberpunk\" did not exist. Coined by Bruce Bethke for a short-story title, the term \"cyberpunk\" was popularised by Gardner Dozois in a 1984 \"The Washington Post\" article, using the term to describe Gibson, Bruce Sterling, Lewis Shiner, and Greg Bear. Gibson exchanged letters with Sterling, Shiner, and Rudy Rucker, sharing ideas, criticism and praise of each other's work. This created a kind of shared outlook through recurring themes and motifs. As with the New Wave, the term could reflect a desire for the writers to be distinguished from the \"old farts\" previously eminent in science fiction. The cyberpunk style contrasted control and communications technologies with the rebellious, countercultural punk aesthetic. Istvan Csicsery-Ronay, Jr. writes that Gibson's subtle use of metaphor, in line with the wider cyberpunk style, blurs the boundaries of human and machine intelligence.\nAlthough frequently cited as the quintessential cyberpunk novel, \"Neuromancer\"'s prototype status has provided wider analytical significance, extending beyond the cyberpunk movement. Owing to its clear influences, critics have discussed the novel and its structure in relation to pulp literature.\nReception.\nReleased without any special attention as a mass-market paperback, \"Neuromancer\"'s release coincided with the boom in personal computing, and gained an audience primarily through word of mouth. \"The Observer\" noted that \"The New York Times\" did not mention the novel until 10 years after release, but contemporary reviews were largely positive. \"The Observer\" and \"The Evening Sun\" agreed that the novel presented a compelling image of a near-future. One critic compared Gibson's cyberspace to Disney's \"Tron\" (1982). It appealed to people who were fans of Gibson's short stories, and found success with readers who were not previously interested in computer fiction. Gibson recorded an abridged version of the novel as cassette-based audiobook in 1995, which a reviewer for \"Wired\" found somewhat disappointing but repeated praise for the novel itself.\n\"Neuromancer\" became the only novel ever to win the \"triple crown\"\u2014Hugo Award for Best Novel, the Nebula Award for Best Novel and the Philip K. Dick Award for original paperback fiction. It was nominated or shortlisted for virtually every other science-fiction prize, including the 1984 BSFA Award for Best Novel.\nImpact.\nThe novel catalysed the cyberpunk movement, influencing artists across virtually all forms of media, including film, literature, visual art, fashion and video gaming. It has been described as \"the quintessential cyberpunk novel\", and the \"archetypal cyberpunk work\", and the most notable 1980s science-fiction novel. Edward Bryant sarcastically referred to subsequent cyberpunk works as NOGS\u2014novels of Gibsonian sensibility. In 2005, \"Time\" named \"Neuromancer\" one of its All-Time 100 Novels.\nThe novel's immense success, alongside the continuous output work of other early cyberpunk writers\u2014most commonly listed as Bruce Sterling, Lewis Shiner, John Shirley and Rudy Rucker\u2014virtually guaranteed the genre's immediate survival. In particular, \"Neuromancer\" provided future cyberpunk stories with a basic structure and vocabulary: protagonists who interface with computer hardware using a biological port, circumvent anti-hacking protocols (Intrusion Countermeasures Electronics, or ICE) and navigate a three-dimensional virtual world (cyberspace).\nMotifs and terminology popularised by the novel\u2014the matrix, flatlining, cranial jack, biological microchips and traversal in cyberspace\u2014were replicated or parodied by other authors. Developments anticipated by the novel include reality TV, nanomachines and virtual communities. It inspired early computer programmers in the creation of the Internet and impacted early computer culture. Gibson has rejected the novel's characterisation as impactful on real-life technologists, reasoning that the ideas came \"from the same place [he] got them\". In 1992, John Perry Barlow, co-founder of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, introduced the term \"cyberspace\" to the US Intelligence Community during a speech in 1992, mentioning \"Neuromancer\" directly. To Gibson's dismay, the term provided a name for a product by Autodesk. \nAdaptations.\nComic, video game and audio dramatisations.\nIn 1989, Marvel's Epic Comics imprint published a 48-page graphic novel version by Tom de Haven and Bruce Jensen. It only covers the first two chapters, \"Chiba City Blues\" and \"The Shopping Expedition\", and was never continued. A loosely based video game adaptation of the same name was published in 1988 by Interplay Entertainment for the Apple II and Commodore 64. \nTimothy Leary, who worked on the Interplay video game, had previously worked on a previous video game adaptation. Leary's plans included writing by William S. Burroughs, photography by Helmut Newton, and a score provided by the rock band Devo. Artist Keith Haring was intended to provide the physical likeness of Case. The game was planned as a tie-in to an unproduced film adaptation.\nIn 2002, a two-part radio adaptation of \"Neuromancer\" by Mike Walker was produced for the BBC World Service. The cast featured Owen McCarthy as Case, Nicola Walker as Molly, James Laurenson as Armitage, John Shrapnel as Wintermute, Colin Stinton as Dixie, David Webber as Maelcum, David Holt as Riviera, Peter Marinker as Ashpool, and Andrew Scott as The Finn.\nFilm attempts.\nWhile \"Neuromancer\" has never been adapted into a film, there have been several attempts; several journalists have described the novel as \"unfilmable\". British director Chris Cunningham and musician Aphex Twin were attached to the project, providing the script and soundtrack, respectively. While Cunningham's script gained Gibson's blessing, Cunningham ultimately withdrew over not being given final cut privilege. Actor Hayden Christensen was rumoured to be attached. Other directors with previous connections to aborted film projects include Chuck Russell, Vincenzo Natali and Tim Miller. Natali, who also had Gibson's blessing, worked for several years on the project; offers were extended to actors Liam Neeson and Mark Wahlberg until Natali became unavailable.\nTelevision.\nIn February 2024, Apple announced that it had greenlit a 10-episode series for Apple TV+, co-produced by Skydance Television, Anonymous Content, and DreamCrew Entertainment, with J. D. Dillard joining Graham Roland as co-showrunners. The announced cast includes Callum Turner as Case, Briana Middleton as Molly, Joseph Lee as Hideo, Mark Strong as Armitage, and Cl\u00e9mence Po\u00e9sy as Marie-France Tessier.\"\" In July 2025, Apple released a short video of a neon-lit bar with the caption \"Welcome to the Chatsubo, cowboy. \"Neuromancer\" is in production\".\nNotes and references.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\nBooks.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nArticles.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nNews.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReviews.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWebsites.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "21728", "revid": "17847680", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21728", "title": "New York Mets", "text": "Major League Baseball franchise in New York City\nThe New York Mets are an American professional baseball team based in the New York City borough of Queens. The Mets compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member club of the National League (NL) East Division. They are one of two major league clubs based in New York City alongside the American League (AL)'s New York Yankees. One of baseball's first expansion teams, the Mets were founded in 1962 to replace New York's departed NL teams, the Brooklyn Dodgers and the New York Giants. The team's colors evoke the blue of the Dodgers and the orange of the Giants.\nFor the 1962 and 1963 seasons, the Mets played home games at the Polo Grounds in Manhattan before moving to Queens. From 1964 to 2008, the Mets played their home games at Shea Stadium, named after William Shea, the founder of the Continental League, a proposed third major league, the announcement of which prompted their admission as an NL expansion team. Since 2009, the Mets have played their home games at Citi Field next to the site where Shea Stadium once stood.\nIn their inaugural season, the Mets posted a record of 40\u2013120, the second most regular-season losses since MLB went to a 162-game schedule. The team never finished better than second-to-last in the 1960s until the \"Miracle Mets\" beat the Baltimore Orioles in the 1969 World Series, considered one of the biggest upsets in World Series history despite the Mets having won 100 games that season. The Mets have qualified for the postseason eleven times, winning the World Series twice (1969 and 1986) and winning five National League pennants (most recently in 2000 and 2015), and six National League East division titles.\nSince 2020, the Mets have been owned by billionaire hedge fund manager Steve Cohen, who purchased the team for $2.4 billion. As of 2025, \"Forbes\" ranked the Mets as the sixth most valuable MLB team, valued at $3.2 billion.\nAs of the end of the 2025 regular season, the team's overall win\u2013loss record is 4,899\u20135,227\u20138 ().\nHistory.\n1960s: Founding and first World Series.\nAfter the 1957 season, the Brooklyn Dodgers and New York Giants relocated from New York to California to become the Los Angeles Dodgers and San Francisco Giants, leaving the largest city in the United States with no National League franchise and only one major league team, the New York Yankees of the American League (AL). With the threat of a New York team joining the new Continental League, the National League expanded by adding the New York Mets following a proposal from William Shea. In a symbolic reference to New York's earlier National League teams, the new team took as its primary colors the blue of the Dodgers and the orange of the Giants, both of which are colors also featured on the flag of New York City. The nickname \"Mets\" was adopted: being a natural shorthand to the club's corporate name, the \"New York Metropolitan Baseball Club, Inc.\", which hearkened back to the \"Metropolitans\" (a New York team in the American Association from 1880 to 1887), and its brevity was advantageous for newspaper headlines.\nThe 1962 Mets posted a 40\u2013120 record, the second most losses by a post-1900 MLB team behind the 2024 Chicago White Sox. During the 1963 season the team featured a pitcher, Carlton Willey, who was having a great year, pitching four shut-outs, when he incurred an injury and finished with a 9\u201314 win\u2013loss record. The '63 squad also had Duke Snider, who hit his 2,000th hit and later his 400th home run and earned a berth to the 1963 All-Star Game. In 1964, the Mets hired Yogi Berra as a coach under Casey Stengel's coaching staff.\nIn 1966, the Mets famously bypassed future Hall of Famer Reggie Jackson in the amateur draft, instead selecting Steve Chilcott, who never played in the majors. But the following year, they acquired future Hall of Famer Tom Seaver in a lottery. Seaver helped the 1969 \"Miracle Mets\" win the new National League East division title, then defeat the Atlanta Braves to win the National League pennant and the heavily favored Baltimore Orioles to win the 1969 World Series.\n1970s: Second pennant and the \"Midnight Massacre\".\nIn 1973, the Mets rallied from 5th place to win the division, despite a record of only 82\u201379. They shocked the heavily favored Cincinnati Reds' \"Big Red Machine\" in the NLCS and pushed the defending World Series champion Oakland Athletics to a seventh game, but lost the series. Notably, 1973 was the only NL East title between 1970 and 1980 that was not won by either the Philadelphia Phillies or the Pittsburgh Pirates. Star pitcher Tom Seaver was traded in 1977, on a day remembered as \"the Midnight Massacre\", and the Mets fell into last place for several years.\n1980s: Success, Wilpon takes over and second World Series championship.\nIn January 1980, the Payson heirs sold the Mets franchise to the Doubleday publishing company for $21.1 million, a record amount at that time. Nelson Doubleday, Jr. was named chairman of the board while minority shareholder Fred Wilpon took the role of club president. In February, Wilpon hired longtime Baltimore Orioles executive Frank Cashen as general manager who began the process of rebuilding the Mets much in the same way he developed the Orioles in the late 1960s and early 1970s.\nThe franchise turned around in the mid-1980s. During this time the Mets drafted slugger Darryl Strawberry (#1 in 1980) and 1985 Cy Young Award winner Dwight Gooden (#5 in 1982). Former National League MVP and perennial Gold Glove winner Keith Hernandez was obtained by the Mets in 1983 from the St. Louis Cardinals. This began a rivalry between the two teams that lasted throughout the rest of the 1980s, during which the teams would swap NL East titles between 1985 and 1988, Mets players openly trolled the Cardinals, and Cardinals fans nicknamed the Mets \"pond scum.\"\nAfter finishing their first three campaigns of the 1980s decade in either 5th or 6th (last) place, in 1984, new manager Davey Johnson was promoted from the helm of the AAA Tidewater Tides. He led the Mets to a second-place, 90\u201372 record, their first winning season since 1976.\nIn 1985, they acquired Hall of Fame catcher Gary Carter from the Montreal Expos and won 98 games, but narrowly missed the playoffs. In 1986, they won the division with a record of 108\u201354, one of the best in National League history. They then won a dramatic NLCS in six games over the Houston Astros. The sixth game of the series lasted sixteen innings, the longest playoff game in history until 2005. The Mets came within one strike of losing the World Series against the Boston Red Sox before a series of hits and defensive miscues ultimately led to an error by Boston's Bill Buckner which gave the Mets a Game 6 victory. The Mets won their second World Series title in seven games.\nIn 1987 the Mets declined to re-sign World Series MVP Ray Knight, who then signed with the Baltimore Orioles and also traded away the flexible Kevin Mitchell to the Padres for long-ball threat Kevin McReynolds. Weeks later Mets' ace Dwight Gooden was admitted to a drug clinic after testing positive for cocaine. Despite Gooden struggling in the first few months of the 1987 season, \"Dr. K\" rebounded, as did the team. It was during the tough times that the Mets made a great long-term deal, trading Ed Hearn to the Kansas City Royals for pitcher David Cone.\nThe rivalry with the Cardinals culminated in the 1987 season, when the Mets surged to challenge them for the NL East title but suffered two painful losses. The first came on Seat Cushion Night where Tom Herr hit a walk-off grand slam. A greater loss came on September 11 in a game against St. Louis, 3rd baseman Terry Pendleton hit a homer to give the Cardinals a lead, and eventually the NL East title. One highlight of the year was Darryl Strawberry and Howard Johnson becoming the first teammates' ever to hit 30 homers and steal 30 bases in the same season.\nThe Mets rebounded the following year to post a 100\u201360 overall record and win their division in 1988, but lost in the NLCS that year to the Los Angeles Dodgers and declined into the 1990s.\n1990s: Struggles and return to the postseason.\n1991\u20131992.\nDuring the 1991 season, the Mets were actually in contention for much of the season, closing to within 2.5 games of the front-running Pirates at one point. In the latter half, however, the bottom completely fell out and Harrelson was fired with a week left to go in the season, replaced by third base coach Mike Cubbage for the final games. Gregg Jefferies, once considered a promising young player, became a distraction as he released a controversial statement to be read on WFAN radio:When a pitcher is having trouble getting players out, when a hitter is having trouble hitting, or when a player makes an error, I try to support them in whatever way I can. I don't run to the media to belittle them or to draw more attention to their difficult times. I can only hope that one day those teammates who have found it convenient to criticize me will realize that we are all in this together. If only we can concentrate more on the games, rather than complaining and bickering and pointing fingers, we would all be better off. This was seen as the end for Jefferies in New York as he would be traded to the Kansas City Royals in the offseason. The season ended on a high note, however, as David Cone pitched a one-hit shutout against the Phillies at Veterans Stadium, in which he struck out 19 batters, tying the National League regulation game record (first set by former Met Tom Seaver). With all of the personal problems swirling around the Mets after the 1986 championship, the Mets tried to rebuild using experienced superstars. They picked up Eddie Murray for over $3 million, Bobby Bonilla for over $6 million. They also traded McReynolds and Jefferies for one-time World Series hero Bret Saberhagen and his $3 million contract, along with signing veteran free agent pitcher Frank Tanana for $1.5 million. The rebuilding was supported by the slogan, \"Hardball Is Back\".\nThe experiment of building a team via free agency quickly flopped as Saberhagen and Vince Coleman were soon injured and spent more time on the disabled list than on the field, and Bonilla exhibited unprofessional behavior towards members of the press, once threatening a reporter by saying, \"I'll show you The Bronx\". https://. At the beginning of the 1991 season, Coleman, Gooden and outfielder Daryl Boston were named in an alleged sexual abuse incident against a woman near the Mets' spring training facility; the charges were later dropped. Meanwhile, popular pitcher David Cone was dealt to the Toronto Blue Jays during the 1992 season for Ryan Thompson and Jeff Kent. While the move was widely criticized by fans of both teams, the Jays went on to win the 1992 World Series.Their descent was chronicled by the book \"The Worst Team Money Could Buy: The Collapse Of The New York Mets\" () by Mets beat writers Bob Klapisch and John Harper.\n1993.\nThe lowest point of the experiment was the 1993 season when the Mets lost 103 games. In April of that year, Coleman accidentally hit Gooden's shoulder with a golf club while practicing his swing. In July, Saberhagen threw a firecracker under a table near reporters. Their young pitching prospect Anthony Young started the 1993 season at 0\u201313 and his overall streak of 27 straight losses over two years set a new record. After Young's record-setting loss, Coleman threw a firecracker out of the team bus window and injured three people resulting in felony charges that effectively ended his Mets career; the Mets placed him on paid administrative leave for the remainder of the season, and announced less than a month before the end of the season that he would never play for them again. Only a few days later, Saberhagen was in trouble again, this time for spraying bleach at three reporters. The meltdown season resulted in the worst record for a Mets team since 1965. In addition, two of the three remaining links to the 1986 team, Howard Johnson and Sid Fernandez, departed after the season via free agency.\n1994 shortened season.\nThe following season saw some promise for the troubled Mets, as first baseman Rico Brogna and second baseman Jeff Kent became fan favorites with their solid glove work and potential 20\u201325 home run power, Bonilla started to become the player the Mets expected, and a healthy Saberhagen, along with promising young starter Bobby Jones and John Franco, helped the Mets pitching staff along. In the strike-shortened 1994 season the Mets were in 3rd place behind first-place Montreal and Atlanta when the season ended on August 12.\n1995\u20131997: Working their way back.\n1995 season.\nWhen the strike finally ended in 1995, the Mets finally showed some promise again, finishing in 2nd place (but still 6 games under .500) behind eventual World Series champion Atlanta.\nThe 1995 season marked the emergence of pitchers Bill Pulsipher, Jason Isringhausen, and Paul Wilson. The trio were dubbed Generation K, a group of talented young hurlers who were destined to bring the Mets into greatness, much like Tom Seaver, Jerry Koosman and Nolan Ryan did in the 1960s. However, all three players succumbed to injury, preventing them from reaching their full potential. Of the three of them, only Isringhausen would accomplish much of significance in the majors, but as a reliever, eventually reaching 300 career saves.\n1996 season.\nThe Mets dismal 1996 season was highlighted by the play of switch hitting catcher Todd Hundley breaking the Major League Baseball single season record for home runs hit by catcher with 41. Center fielder Lance Johnson set single-season franchise records in hits (227), triples (21), at bats (682), runs scored (117). Johnson's 21 triples also led the National League, the highest amount by an NL player since 1930.\n1997.\nIn the off season, the Mets acquired first baseman John Olerud from the Toronto Blue Jays for pitcher Robert Person.\nIn 1997, the Mets finally bounced back with an 88\u201374 record, missing the playoffs by only four games, and the team improved by 17 wins from 1996. On June 16, the Mets beat the New York Yankees at Yankee Stadium in the first ever regular-season game played between the crosstown rivals 6\u20130. Mets starter Dave Mlicki pitched a complete game shutout to pick up the win. In 1997, Hundley's great season was derailed by a devastating elbow injury and required Tommy John surgery.\n1998.\nThe Mets season in 1998 began with an unforgettable opening day game at Shea Stadium on March 31 against their division rival Philadelphia Phillies, marking the first time that a regular season baseball game was played in New York in March. Both of them were involved in the longest scoreless opening day game in the National League and the longest one in the MLB since 1926 when the Washington Senators beat the Philadelphia Athletics 1\u20130 in 15 innings. The Mets won the game 1\u20130 in 14 innings when backup catcher Alberto Castillo delivered a full-count, two-out, pinch-hit single to right with the bases loaded off Philadelphia closer Ricky Bottalico.\nDuring the season, the Mets acquired Mike Piazza in a blockbuster trade that immediately brought star power and credibility to the Mets that had been lacking in recent years.\nAfter the Piazza trade, the Mets played well, but missed the 1998 postseason by only one game. With five games left in the season, the Mets could not win a single game against both the Montreal Expos at home and the Atlanta Braves on the road.Following the 1998 season the Mets re-signed Mike Piazza to a seven-year, $91 million contract, the Mets traded Todd Hundley to the Los Angeles Dodgers. Trades netted the Mets Roger Cede\u00f1o, Armando Ben\u00edtez, and the Mets signed free agents Robin Ventura, Rickey Henderson, and Bobby Bonilla.\n1999.\nThe Mets started the 1999 season well, going 17\u20139, but after an eight-game losing streak, including the last two to the New York Yankees, the Mets fired their entire coaching staff except for manager Bobby Valentine.The Mets, in front of a national audience on \"Sunday Night Baseball\", beat the New York Yankees 7\u20132 in the turning point of the 1999 season. Both Mike Piazza and Robin Ventura had MVP-type seasons and Benny Agbayani emerged as an important role player. It was a breakout year for Mets second baseman Edgardo Alfonzo and Roger Cede\u00f1o, who broke the single season steals record for the Mets.\nAfter the regular season ended, the Mets played a one-game playoff against the Cincinnati Reds, Al Leiter pitched the best game of his Met career as he hurled a two-hit complete-game shutout to advance the Mets to the playoffs. In the NLDS, the Mets defeated the Arizona Diamondbacks 3 games to 1. The series-clinching victory included a walk-off home run by backup catcher Todd Pratt. The Mets would lose however in the 1999 National League Championship Series to the Atlanta Braves, in six exciting games which included the famous Grand Slam Single by Robin Ventura to win game 5 for the Mets. The Mets were at one point down 3\u20130 in the series.\nThe Mets struggled for much of the 1990s, finishing with a losing record for six consecutive seasons between 1991 and 1996.\n2000s: The Subway World Series and new ballpark.\nIn 2000, the Mets finished the season with a 94\u201368 record and clinched a wild card spot in the playoffs. In the NLDS, the Mets defeated the San Francisco Giants 3\u20131 in the series and the St Louis Cardinals in the NLCS. After winning the National League pennant, the Mets earned a trip to the 2000 World Series against their crosstown rivals, the New York Yankees, for a \"Subway Series\". The Mets were defeated by the Yankees in five games. The most memorable moment of the 2000 World Series occurred during the first inning of Game 2 at Yankee Stadium. Piazza fouled off a pitch which shattered his bat, sending a piece of the barrel toward the pitcher's mound. Pitcher Roger Clemens seized the piece and hurled it in the direction of Piazza as the catcher trotted to first base. Benches briefly cleared before the game was resumed with no ejections.\nDuring the 2001 season, the Mets finished with a record of 82\u201380 finishing third in the division. After the September 11 terrorist attacks Shea Stadium was used as a relief center and then saw the first sporting event in New York City since the attacks, in a game vs. the Atlanta Braves on September 21. In the bottom of the 8th inning the Mets were trailing 2\u20131 when Mike Piazza came to bat with a runner on first. Piazza dramatically sent Shea into a frenzy by crushing a home run to give the Mets a 3\u20132 lead and the eventual win. The game is considered to be one of the greatest moments in the history of the franchise.\nIn 2002, despite the off-season signings of Tom Glavine, Mo Vaughn, and Roberto Alomar, the Mets finished the 2002 season with a 75\u201386 overall record and last in the NL East. During that same season the Mets dealt with off field distractions when co-owners Wilpon and Doubleday were in a legal battle which was later settled with Wilpon becoming the sole owner on August 23 that year.\nIn the aftermath of the 2004 season, the Mets hired a new general manager, Omar Minaya, who immediately turned the franchise around by signing pitcher Pedro Mart\u00ednez and hiring a new manager, Willie Randolph. The Mets finished 2005 four games over .500, and the franchise's resurgence was complete by 2006 as they won 97 games and the NL East title behind new acquisitions Carlos Beltr\u00e1n and Carlos Delgado, as well as young superstars Jos\u00e9 Reyes and David Wright. The Mets eventually succumbed to the St. Louis Cardinals in Game 7 of the National League Championship Series.\nIn 2007, the Mets entered the final 17 games in the season with a seven-game lead in the NL East. But the team went on an ill-timed losing streak, losing 11 of the next 15 games, resulting in the Philadelphia Phillies winning the division by one game.\nThe Mets held a more modest 3.5-game lead after 145 games of the 2008 season, their final season at Shea Stadium. On June 16, Omar Minaya fired Willie Randolph, Rick Peterson, and Tom Nieto. Jerry Manuel was named interim manager. While their 7\u201310 mark down the stretch was better than the previous season's 5\u201312, it still allowed the Phillies to pass them once again for the division crown.\nIn 2009, the Mets moved into the newly constructed Citi Field. On April 17, Gary Sheffield, who just days earlier was signed by the Mets as a free agent, hit his 500th home run against the Milwaukee Brewers. Sheffield became the first pinch hitter to reach this milestone, as well as the first to do it in a Mets uniform. The season was mainly a tough one for the Mets which was marred by numerous injuries suffered by its players, with 20 of them having been on the disabled list at one point or another during the season and losing star (and also replacement) players like J. J. Putz, John Maine, \u00d3liver P\u00e9rez, Jos\u00e9 Reyes, Carlos Beltr\u00e1n, David Wright, Carlos Delgado, Johan Santana, and Gary Sheffield.\nAs a result, the Mets finished in fourth place, with a record of 70\u201392 and failed to qualify for the playoffs for the third straight season. Mets players spent more than 1,480 days in the disabled list in 2009, more than any other team in the majors. Second-half turnarounds of Jeff Francoeur and Daniel Murphy helped the Mets finish the season with the best batting average in the National League, tied with the Los Angeles Dodgers.\n2010s: Wilpon sells the team and fifth trip to the World Series.\nIn 2012, Mets owners Fred Wilpon and Saul Katz settled a lawsuit brought against them on behalf of the victims of Bernard Madoff's Ponzi scheme for $162\u00a0million. As a result of this agreement the liquidator, Irving Picard, agreed to drop the charges that Wilpon and Katz blindly went along with the scheme for their personal benefit. Picard had originally sought to recover $1\u00a0billion from the Wilpon family and Katz, but settled for $162\u00a0million along with the admission that neither the Wilpons nor Katz had any knowledge of the Ponzi scheme. In 2011\u20132012, Mets ownership sold twelve minority 4% shares (totaling 48%) of the franchise at $20\u00a0million apiece to provide a cash infusion of $240\u00a0million for the team.\nThough the first half of the 2010s saw limited success for the Mets, who failed to finish with a winning record between 2009 and 2014, this period coincided with a number of milestones for the franchise, including the first no-hitter in franchise history by Johan Santana in 2012. R.A. Dickey won the NL Cy Young Award pitching for the Mets that same season.\nOn September 26, 2015, the Mets clinched the NL East division title, and thus their first postseason berth since 2006, by defeating the Cincinnati Reds 10\u20132. They defeated the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NLDS, three games to two, and swept the Chicago Cubs in the NLCS for their first pennant in 15 years. In the 2015 World Series, they were defeated by the Kansas City Royals in five games.\nThe Mets returned to the postseason in 2016, marking only the second time in franchise history that the team qualified for the postseason in consecutive years. With an 87\u201375 record, the team qualified for the wild-card game, only to lose 3\u20130 to the San Francisco Giants. The Mets failed to make the playoffs for the rest of the decade, finishing no higher than third place in 2019 when they finished with a winning record of 86\u201376 (the highest of any team not to qualify for the postseason).\nThe end of the decade also coincided with David Wright's retirement, Jacob deGrom being awarded two consecutive Cy Young Awards (including for the 2018 season when the pitcher finished the year with a 1.70 ERA) and first-baseman Pete Alonso winning the 2019 Rookie of the Year Award and finishing the season with a major-league-leading 53 home runs, the most by any rookie in MLB history. On October 3, 2019, the Mets fired manager Mickey Callaway. On November 1, 2019, the Mets named Carlos Beltr\u00e1n as the new manager replacing Callaway.\n2020s: Steve Cohen era.\nOn January 16, 2020, Beltr\u00e1n stepped down as manager before the start of the 2020 MLB season due to his involvement in the Houston Astros sign stealing scandal. Two days later, the Mets hired Luis Rojas as manager. The team finished the shortened 2020 season with a 26\u201334 record and a last-place finish in the NL East.\nOn October 30, 2020, Steve Cohen became the majority owner of the Mets, owning 95% of the team, making him the current richest owner in baseball. He bought the team from the Wilpon family for $2.4 billion, with the Wilpons keeping the remaining 5%. On January 7, 2021, the Mets acquired pitcher Carlos Carrasco and All-Star shortstop Francisco Lindor in a trade with the Cleveland Indians. On March 31, Lindor and the Mets agreed to a 10-year extension worth $341 million. At the trade deadline, the Mets acquired All-Star infielder &amp; World Series champion Javier B\u00e1ez in trade with the Chicago Cubs. The Mets finished third place in the NL East with an overall record of 77\u201385.\nOn November 19, the Mets hired Billy Eppler as their new general manager. During the offseason, the Mets signed free agents Nick Plummer, Starling Marte, Eduardo Escobar, and Mark Canha. On December 1, the Mets signed three-time Cy Young Award winner Max Scherzer with a three-year, $130 million deal. On December 18, the Mets announced that they hired Buck Showalter as their new manager via owner Steve Cohen's Twitter account.\nOn April 29, 2022, Tylor Megill, Drew Smith, Joely Rodr\u00edguez, Seth Lugo and Edwin D\u00edaz pitched the second no-hitter in franchise history in a 3\u20130 win against the Philadelphia Phillies. On September 18, during a game against the Pittsburgh Pirates, Jacob deGrom set a new MLB record by allowing three or less earned runs in 40 consecutive games, breaking a record that was held by Jim Scott for over 100 years.\nOn the following day, the Mets clinched their first postseason berth since 2016, and their 10th in franchise history. On September 25, Pete Alonso broke the Mets single-season RBI record which was previously set by former franchise stars Mike Piazza and David Wright. Also during the season, the Mets called up three of their top prospects Brett Baty, Mark Vientos, and Francisco \u00c1lvarez. The Mets won 101 games and tied with the Atlanta Braves for the best record in the NL East; however, the Mets were designated as a Wild Card team due to them getting swept by the Braves. The Mets lost the 2022 National League Wild Card Series to the San Diego Padres. They also became the first team in MLB history to produce only one hit in a winner-take-all playoff game.\nIn the offseason, the Mets lost deGrom to the Texas Rangers via free agency, but quickly replaced him by signing Japanese ace Kodai Senga to a five-year, $75 million contract, and three-time Cy Young Award winner Justin Verlander to a two-year, $86.7 million contract. Despite this the Mets were unable to gain momentum from the previous season and missed the playoffs in the process. The team ended the 2023 season with a 75\u201387 record and finished fourth-place in the NL East.\nOn September 12, 2023, the Mets hired David Stearns as their new president of baseball operations. On October 1, after the final game of the season, the Mets fired manager Buck Showalter. They would then introduce their new president Stearns on the following day. On October 5, Billy Eppler resigned as general manager. On November 13, the Mets named former New York Yankees bench coach Carlos Mendoza as their new manager. During the offseason, the Mets signed free agents Luis Severino, Joey Wendle, Jorge L\u00f3pez, Harrison Bader and Sean Manaea.\nIn the season, the Mets started off with a dismal 22\u201333 record. However, after a players-only meeting was held by shortstop Francisco Lindor on May 29, the Mets significantly improved the rest of the way, mainly from the McDonald's character Grimace putting the Mets on a winning path, and the song \"OMG\" by infielder Jose Iglesias under the stage name Candelita, becoming a rallying cry for the whole team. The Mets finished with a record of 89\u201373 and qualified for the playoffs for the second time in three years. They reached as far as the 2024 National League Championship Series before losing to the eventual World Series champion Los Angeles Dodgers in six games.\nOn December 8, 2024, the Mets signed superstar outfielder Juan Soto to a 15-year, $765 million contract in the offseason, the largest contract in professional sports history. It is also said that the contract has ushered in a new era in Mets history and in all of New York baseball.\nWorld Series championships.\nThroughout the 60-year history of the franchise, the Mets have won two World Series championships in total.\nCulture.\nFan support.\nIn 1998, the Independent Budget Office of the city of New York published a study on the economic effect of the city's two Major League Baseball teams. The study found that 43% of Mets fans lived in one of the five boroughs of New York, 39% in the tri-state area outside the city, and 12% elsewhere. Mets fans were more likely to be found in Queens, Brooklyn, and the Long Island counties of Nassau and Suffolk. Mets, Yankees, and Toronto Blue Jays fans are shared in Western New York. Notable fans of the Mets include Jerry Seinfeld, Kevin James, Julia Stiles, Ty Burrell, Bill Maher, Ben Stiller, Jimmy Kimmel, Hank Azaria, Jim Breuer, Jon Stewart, Chris Rock, Matthew Broderick, Dylan O'Brien, Glenn Close, Billy Joel, Ad-Rock, MCA, Nas, 50 Cent, Nicki Minaj, Chris Christie, Patrick Mahomes, and Donovan Mitchell.\nThe 7 Line Army.\nThe \"7 Line Army\" are a group primarily consisting of passionate and die-hard Mets fans occupying the Big Apple Section of Citi Field during home games for the Mets. The group was founded in 2012 by Darren Meenan who owns The 7 Line, an apparel company that produces Mets-themed clothing.\nMascots.\nMr. Met is the official mascot of the New York Mets. He was introduced on the cover of game programs in 1963, when the Mets were still playing at the Polo Grounds in northern Manhattan. When the Mets moved to Shea Stadium in 1964, fans were introduced to a live costumed version. Mr. Met is believed to have been the first mascot in Major League Baseball to exist in human (as opposed to artistically rendered) form.\nMrs. Met (formerly Lady Met) is the female counterpart to Mr. Met, and the couple sometimes appears with 2\u20133 smaller \"children\".\nThe Mets have had two mascots other than Mr. and Mrs. Met at different points in its history. The franchise's original official mascot was Homer, a beagle trained by Rudd Weatherwax that lived at the Waldorf-Astoria, was sponsored by Rheingold Beer and had his own platform behind home plate at the Polo Grounds. The dog was not included in the transition to Shea Stadium. The brainchild of team owner Lorinda de Roulet's daughter Bebe, Mettle the mule represented the Mets for only the 1979 season. The name was the result of a contest won by Dolores Mapps of Mercerville, New Jersey whose explanation was that it typified the team's \"spirit, ardor, stamina and courage, all of which the Mets have in abundance.\" Mettle was not retained after the franchise was sold to Nelson Doubleday Jr. and Fred Wilpon the following year.\nTheme song.\n\"Meet the Mets\" is the Mets' signature song, written in 1961, one year before the first season, by Bill Katz and Ruth Roberts. It is played on the radio, during television broadcasts and at Mets' home games. Other songs traditionally sung at Mets home games include \"Take Me Out to the Ball Game\" and the Sicilian song \"Lazy Mary\" during the seventh-inning stretch and Billy Joel's \"Piano Man\" in the middle of the eighth inning.\n\"Let's go Mets\" meme.\nIn 2021, an internet meme involving the fan chant \"let's go, Mets\" began spreading through social media, particularly Twitter and TikTok. The meme is largely based around fictional characters unexpectedly expressing support for the team, such as Kingpin from \"\" and characters from the video game \"Genshin Impact\".\nUniform and logo symbolism.\nThe Mets' colors are blue and orange, originally chosen to honor the city's history of National League baseball; blue for the Brooklyn Dodgers, and orange for the New York Giants. Blue and orange are also the colors of New York City, as seen on its flag.\nIn 1998, black was added to the color scheme. Beginning with 2012 the black elements in the uniform began to be phased out, and were eliminated in 2013. In 2021, the team reintroduced black in their alternate uniforms.\nLogo.\nThe primary logo, designed by sports cartoonist Ray Gotto, consists of \"Mets\" written in orange script trimmed in white across a blue representation of the New York City skyline with a white suspension bridge in the foreground, all contained in an orange circle with orange baseball stitching across the image. Each part of the skyline has special meaning\u2014at the left is a church spire, symbolic of Brooklyn, the borough of churches; the second building from the left is the Williamsburgh Savings Bank Building, the tallest building in Brooklyn at the time of the team's founding; next is the Woolworth Building; after a general skyline view of midtown comes the Empire State Building; at the far right is the headquarters of the United Nations. The suspension bridge in the center symbolizes that the Mets, by bringing National League baseball back to New York, represent all five boroughs; many of New York's major bridges are suspension designs. In 1999, the logo received a slight alteration; a small \"NY\" originally placed to the left of the team script was removed.\nWith the introduction of black as an official color, an alternate team logo was created in 1999. It is identical to the original logo, but the skyline is black instead of blue and the \"Mets\" script is blue trimmed in orange and white instead of orange trimmed in white (the alternate black jerseys displayed the primary blue and orange logo on the left sleeves in 1998; in 1999 this was changed to the alternate black and blue logo). The logo fell into disuse after the Mets dropped the alternate black jerseys and caps in 2012. When the team brought back the black jerseys in 2021, they feature the blue and orange logo patch instead of the black and blue logo.\nToward the end of the 2014 season, the Mets made a slight alteration to their logo on their Facebook and Twitter accounts. The roof of the building to the far right was tilted, changing it from the United Nations building to the Citigroup Center. Negative fan reaction to this change resulted in the building being immediately reverted to the UN building. No other notable changes have been made to the logo since.\nThe cap logo consists of an orange, interlocking \"NY\" identical to the logo used by the New York Giants in their final years, and is on a blue cap reminiscent of the caps worn by the Brooklyn Dodgers.\nUniform color and design.\nCurrently, the Mets wear an assortment of uniforms.\nThe home uniforms are white with blue pinstripes and feature \"Mets\" in blue script with an orange outline across the chest, block letter player names and numbers also in blue with an orange outline and a sleeve patch with the team logo. The uniforms are paired with a blue cap featuring an \"NY\" logo in orange, plus blue undersleeves, belts and socks.\nThe road uniforms, introduced in its current form in 2025, are gray with blue, orange and blue stripes on the collar, sleeves and pants and feature a radially-arched \"NEW YORK\" in Tiffany-style letters across the chest in blue outlined in orange, block letter player numerals and names also in blue outlined in orange and the team logo patch. Like the home uniforms, the road grays are worn with the same blue caps, undersleeves, belts and socks.\nThe black alternate home jersey, introduced in its current form in 2024, is a modified version of the one worn from 1998 to 2012 and reintroduced for Friday home games in 2021. They feature the \"Mets\" script and the block letter player names and numbers in blue outlined in orange and the team logo patch. The set is worn with an alternate black cap featuring the \"NY\" logo in blue trimmed in orange. Belts, undersleeves and socks worn with it are also black. The black alternate home jerseys are worn with plain white pants with blue piping.\nThe blue alternate road jersey, introduced in 2025, features a pullover jersey with \"New York\" in script across the chest and block letter player names and numbers in blue with orange outline, with blue, orange and blue stripes on the collar and sleeves and the team logo patch. The blue alternate road jerseys are worn with the same road gray pants with blue, orange and blue stripes and with the blue caps, undersleeves, belts and socks.\nThe dark gray City Connect jersey with black and purple accents was introduced in 2024. The uniform contains the \"NYC\" wordmark in black patterned after the team's road uniform, along with black pinstripes and a black subway token patch containing the purple \"NY\" logo. The dark gray cap features the \"NY\" logo in black trimmed in white, along with a silhouette of the Queensboro Bridge. The purple color was inspired by the 7 Line that runs to Citi Field.\nThe Mets' standard blue batting helmet, with the \"NY\" in metallic orange, is currently used for games worn with the primary home, road and blue alternate jerseys. A black alternate helmet is used in games with the black jerseys, and a dark gray alternate helmet is paired with the City Connect jerseys.\nAchievements.\nRetired numbers.\nThe Mets have retired ten numbers in the history of the franchise.\nMajor League Baseball retired Jackie Robinson's number 42 on April 15, 1997, when the Mets played the Dodgers at Shea Stadium. Butch Huskey wore the number throughout the rest of his Mets career because of a grandfather clause placed on the retired number by MLB. Mo Vaughn also wore 42 during his stint with the Mets, because of the same clause.\nOn the final opening day at Shea Stadium, April 8, 2008, the Mets unveiled a sign bearing the name \"Shea\" next to the team's retired numbers honoring William Shea and his contributions to the franchise.\nIn 2014, a special memorial logo honoring broadcaster Ralph Kiner, depicting a microphone along with his name and the years 1922\u20132014, was displayed on the left-field wall adjacent to, but not as a part of, the Mets' retired numbers, from 2014 to 2016. In the 2016 Mets yearbook, a sidebar in an article on Mike Piazza's upcoming number retirement implies that Kiner has been \"retired\" next to William Shea. This was confirmed when the Mets' retired numbers were moved to the roof facade during the 2016 season to accommodate Mike Piazza's number 31; the Kiner logo was placed next to the Shea and Jackie Robinson numbers, no longer separated from the others. \nOn August 28, 2021, the Mets retired Jerry Koosman's number 36. On July 9, 2022, the Mets retired Keith Hernandez's number 17. That same year, on August 27, the Mets retired Willie Mays' number 24. On April 5, 2023, the Mets honored broadcaster Bob Murphy with a microphone logo alongside Kiner. The Mets retired Dwight Gooden's number 16 on April 14, 2024, and Darryl Strawberry's number 18 later that year on June 1. On July 19, 2025, the Mets retired David Wright's number 5.\nThe uniform number 8 has not been issued since Gary Carter was elected to the Hall of Fame in 2003 as an Expo, after requesting to go in as a Met. When the Mets honored Carter, they did not retire number 8, but instead gave him a replica of his Hall of Fame plaque depicting him as a Met instead of an Expo. Desi Relaford and Matt Galante were the last Mets player and coach, respectively, to wear the number. After Carter's death, the Mets honored him in a ceremony on Opening Day in 2012, where they unveiled the \"Kid 8\" memorial logo (also worn on the uniform sleeve) on the outfield fence. The number is still not officially retired.\nTeam captains.\nFour players have been team captains for the Mets:\nBaseball Hall of Famers.\nNew York Mets Hall of Famers\nAffiliation according to the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum\nNew York Mets\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Plainlist/styles.css\"/&gt;\nFord C. Frick Award recipients.\nNew York Mets Ford C. Frick Award recipients\nAffiliation according to the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Plainlist/styles.css\"/&gt;\nRivalries.\nThe Mets have notable rivalries with the Atlanta Braves, the New York Yankees, and the Philadelphia Phillies. The Braves rivalry is due to division realignment that put both teams in the National League East in . Their rivalry with the Yankees has its roots in the histories of the New York Giants, Brooklyn Dodgers, and the Yankees and the fierce Subway Series matchups between the two teams. The rivalry with the Phillies stems from the geographic New York-Philadelphia rivalry, which is also seen in other sports.\nSubway Series.\nThe Mets\u00a0\u2013 New York Yankees rivalry is the latest incarnation of the Subway Series, the competition between New York City's teams, the American League New York Yankees and the National League Mets. Until Interleague play started, the two teams had only met in exhibition games. Since the inception of interleague play the two teams have met every regular season since 1997, and since 1999 they have met six times each season, playing two three-game series, one in each team's ballpark. From the 2013 season however the number of games was reduced to four, two at each ballpark with the Mets winning six of the last eight games in that span. They have made the postseason in the same year six times: 1999, 2000, 2006, 2015, 2022, and 2024, and faced off in the 2000 World Series.\nAtlanta Braves.\nThe Braves\u2013Mets rivalry is a rivalry between two teams in the National League East, featuring the Atlanta Braves and the Mets.\nAlthough their first major confrontation occurred when the Mets swept the Braves in the 1969 NLCS, en route to their first World Series championship, the first playoff series won by an expansion team (also the first playoff appearance by an expansion team), the rivalry did not become especially heated until the 1990s, when a division realignment in 1994 put the Mets and the Braves in the NL East together (from 1969 to 1993, the Braves were in the NL West). The two teams faced each other again in the 1999 NLCS, and the Braves won the series four games to two. However, they would go on to lose to the Yankees in the 1999 World Series.\nPhiladelphia Phillies.\nDuring the mid to late 2000s, the rivalry between the Mets and the Philadelphia Phillies from 2006 to 2008 was said to be among the \"hottest\" rivalries in the National League.\nAside from several brawls in the 1980s, the rivalry remained low-key before the 2006 season, as the teams had seldom been equally good at the same time. Since 2006, the teams have battled for playoff position. The Mets won the division in 2006 and contended in 2007 and 2008, while the Phillies won five consecutive division titles from 2007 to 2011. The Phillies' 2007 Eastern Division Title was won on the last day of the season as the Mets lost a seven-game lead with 17 games remaining while losing 12 of 18 games that season to the Phillies, including being swept at home in the first 3 games of the remaining 17, dropping their lead from 7 games to 3.5.\nThere is a long-standing rivalry between the sports fans from New York City and Philadelphia, which are approximately two hours apart by car, which is also seen between New York Giants and the Philadelphia Eagles in the National Football League, and the New York Rangers and the Philadelphia Flyers in National Hockey League. Games between the two teams at Citi Field and Citizens Bank Park are often very intense, hard-hitting affairs, as each home crowd does its best to create an unfriendly, sometimes volatile atmosphere for any visiting-team fans.\nSt. Louis Cardinals.\nThe rivalry between the St. Louis Cardinals and the Mets peaked during the 1980s when both teams contended for National League East supremacy. The rivalry began with the 1983 trade that brought Keith Hernandez from the Cardinals to the Mets, essentially turning the latter into contenders. Between 1985 and 1988, the division was dominated by either of the two teams, and in three of those years, the NL East winner went on to the World Series. In 1994, the Cardinals were moved to the National League Central, and the rivalry faded soon after. The two teams would meet in the 2000 and 2006 National League Championship Series, briefly rekindling the rivalry.\nNew York Mets Foundation.\nA registered 501(c)(3) charity, the New York Mets Foundation is the philanthropic organization of the New York Mets. Founded in 1963, it funds and promotes charitable causes in the Mets community. One of these causes is Tuesday's Children, is a non-profit family service organization that \"has made a long term commitment to meet the needs of every family who lost a loved one in the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001\". The Mets host the annual Welcome Home Dinner, which raised over $550,000 for the Mets Foundation in 2012. All proceeds were distributed to Katz Institute for Women's Health and Katz Women's Hospitals of North Shore-LIJ Health System and The Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society.\nRadio and television.\nTelevision.\nThe majority of Mets games are carried by SportsNet New York (SNY), a joint venture of the Mets and NBC Sports Regional Networks launched in 2006. The primary play-by-play announcer is Gary Cohen, with former Mets Keith Hernandez and Ron Darling working as the primary color commentators. Steve Gelbs serves as the field reporter for most games, and would periodically fill in for Cohen on play-by-play. Todd Zeile, Jerry Blevins, and Daniel Murphy also occasionally fill in as color commentators on select games.\nCohen had called Mets' games on the radio since 1989, moving to television upon the establishment of SNY in 2006. Hernandez had previously worked as a color commentator on the Mets' television broadcasts since 1998, and Darling as a broadcaster and color commentator for the Oakland Athletics and the Washington Nationals. From 2007 to 2015, Kevin Burkhardt served as a field reporter and fill-in play-by-play announcer on SNY broadcasts before moving to Fox Sports full time.\nFor the twenty years following the team's inception in 1962, Mets' games were simulcasted on radio and television. Until 1978, almost all Mets games were called by the trio of Lindsey Nelson, Bob Murphy, and Ralph Kiner on both radio and television. Nelson left the broadcast after the 1978 season and was replaced by Steve Albert, with Murphy assuming the primary play-by-play duties.\nIn 1982, when the team separated its radio and television broadcasts, Kiner became the lead television play-by play voice of the Mets, with Tim McCarver, Fran Healy, and Rusty Staub among those working as color commentators. Gary Thorne, who had previously been a radio announcer for the Mets, joined the television broadcast in 1994 as a secondary play-by-play announcer. \nIn 1996, Thorne and Howie Rose began splitting the primary play-by-play duties, with Kiner scaling back his workload to a color commentary role. Over the next few years, former Mets Tom Seaver and Keith Hernandez would also begin working as color commentators. Thorne left the broadcast in 2003, at which point Ted Robinson, Matt Loughlin, and Dave O'Brien began alternating play-by-play duties with Rose until he departed for the Mets' radio booth the following year in 2004. \nThe team has broadcast games over-the-air on WPIX since 1999, and still airs approximately thirty SNY-produced telecasts on the station per season. Games on WPIX are syndicated across New York and Connecticut to WCCT-TV (Hartford, CT), WCWN/WRGB (Albany, NY), WYCI (Saranac Lake, NY), WSYT-MY43 (Syracuse, NY), WPNY-LD (Utica, NY), WICZ-DT2 (Binghamton, NY), WQMY (Williamsport, PA), WOLF-DT3 (Scranton, PA) and WHAM-DT2 (Rochester, NY).\nRadio.\nHowie Rose has been the Mets' primary radio play-by-play announcer since 2004, and has been partnered with former Brooklyn Cyclones play-by-play announcer Keith Raad since 2023. Patrick McCarthy, the son of former Mets radio voice and current Philadelphia Phillies television broadcaster Tom McCarthy, has served as the host of the radio pre- and post-game shows since 2023, in addition to providing play-by-play for select games.\nAs of late August 2024, Mets radio broadcasts are produced by Audacy, Inc. on the Mets Radio Network, airing locally on WHSQ 880 AM and nationally on the Audacy Mets Radio streaming service. Mets games have aired over the 880 AM frequency since 2019, when the station was still known as WCBS-AM. Spanish-language broadcasts are aired on WINS-FM-HD2 featuring Max Perez-Jimenez and Nestor Rosario, along with MLB.tv and SNY's second audio program channels. They had previously been on WEPN 1050. It was formerly broadcast on WQBU-FM 92.7, Que Buena from 2020 to 2021. Both English and Spanish broadcasts are also aired on the Audacy internet radio service.\nThe Mets' previous radio flagship was WOR from 2014 to 2018. The Mets were previously carried by WFAN, which inherited the team's broadcast rights from WHN when it took over its frequency in 1987, and in later years by WFAN-FM which simulcasted the AM signal. In 2019, coinciding with their move to WCBS, the Mets abruptly stopped syndicating its games to other stations outside the New York City area, effectively shutting down the New York Mets Radio Network.\nAfter having broadcast Mets' games for twenty years, most notably alongside Lindsey Nelson and Ralph Kiner, Bob Murphy became the Mets' lead play-by-play announcer in 1982, when the team stopped simulcasting its games. He was partnered with Steve LaMar until the 1984 season, and with Gary Thorne beginning with the 1985 season.\nUpon Thorne's move to ABC's \"Thursday Night Baseball\" in 1989, Gary Cohen became Murphy's broadcast partner, and the pair continued to call games until Murphy's retirement in 2003. In 2004, after having served as the primary television play-by-play announcer since 1996, Howie Rose joined the radio broadcast as Murphy's successor. \nIn 2006, Cohen left the radio booth to become the primary play-by-play announcer of the Mets on the newly-launched SportsNet New York (SNY) television network. He was replaced by Tom McCarthy, who departed after just two seasons with the broadcast in 2008, with Wayne Hagin taking his place. In 2011, Josh Lewin joined the broadcast after the team parted ways with Hagin following the previous season. Wayne Randazzo began hosting the pre- and post-game shows in 2015, and later became Rose's play-by-play partner upon Lewin's departure in 2019, when the broadcast moved to WCBS. That same year, longtime Mets beat reporter Ed Coleman took over hosting duties for the pre- and post-game shows, a position he previously held from 1996 to 2013. Randazzo left the Mets in 2022 to become the primary television play-by-play voice of the Los Angeles Angels and of \"Friday Night Baseball\" on Apple TV+.\nMinor league affiliations.\nThe New York Mets farm system consists of seven minor league affiliates.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The term Mother Goose rhymes is interchangeable with nursery rhymes.\nFrom the mid-16th century nursery rhymes began to be recorded in English plays, and most popular rhymes date from the 17th and 18th centuries. The first English collections, \"Tommy Thumb's Song Book\" and a sequel, \"Tommy Thumb's Pretty Song Book\", were published by Mary Cooper in 1744. Publisher John Newbery's stepson, Thomas Carnan, was the first to use the term Mother Goose for nursery rhymes when he published a compilation of English rhymes, \"Mother Goose's Melody, or Sonnets for the Cradle\" (London, 1780).\nHistory.\nLullabies.\nThe oldest children's songs for which records exist are lullabies, intended to help a child fall asleep. Lullabies can be found in every human culture. The English term lullaby is thought to come from \"lu, lu\" or \"la la\" sounds made by mothers or nurses to calm children, and \"by by\" or \"bye bye\", either another lulling sound or a term for a good night. Until the modern era, lullabies were usually recorded only incidentally in written sources. The Roman nurses' lullaby, \"Lalla, Lalla, Lalla, aut dormi, aut lacta\", is recorded in a scholium on Persius and may be the oldest to survive.\nMany medieval English verses associated with the birth of Jesus take the form of a lullaby, including \"Lullay, my liking, my dere son, my sweting\" and may be versions of contemporary lullabies. However, most of those used today date from the 17th century. For example, a well-known lullaby such as \"Rock-a-bye Baby\", could not be found in records until the late-18th century when it was printed by John Newbery (c. 1765).\nEarly nursery rhymes.\nA French poem, similar to \"Thirty days hath September\", numbering the days of the month, was recorded in the 13th century. From the later Middle Ages, there are records of short children's rhyming songs, often as marginalia. From the mid-16th century, they began to be recorded in English plays. \"Pat-a-cake\" is one of the oldest surviving English nursery rhymes. The earliest recorded version of the rhyme appears in Thomas d'Urfey's play \"The Campaigners\" from 1698. Most nursery rhymes were not written down until the 18th century when the publishing of children's books began to move from polemic and education towards entertainment, but there is evidence for many rhymes existing before this, including \"To market, to market\" and \"Cock a doodle doo\", which date from at least the late 16th century. Nursery rhymes with 17th-century origins include, \"Jack Sprat\" (1639), \"The Grand Old Duke of York\" (1642), \"Lavender's Blue\" (1672) and \"Rain Rain Go Away\" (1687).\nThe first English collection, \"Tommy Thumb's Song Book\" and a sequel, \"Tommy Thumb's Pretty Song Book\", were published by Mary Cooper in London in 1744, with such songs becoming known as \"Tommy Thumb's songs\". A copy of the latter is held in the British Library. John Newbery's stepson, Thomas Carnan, was the first to use the term Mother Goose for nursery rhymes when he published a compilation of English rhymes, \"Mother Goose's Melody, or, Sonnets for the Cradle\" (London, 1780). These rhymes seem to have come from a variety of sources, including traditional riddles, proverbs, ballads, lines of Mummers' plays, drinking songs, historical events, and, it has been suggested, ancient pagan rituals. One example of a nursery rhyme in the form of a riddle is \"As I was going to St Ives\", which dates to 1730. About half of the currently recognised \"traditional\" English rhymes were known by the mid-18th century. More English rhymes were collected by Joseph Ritson in \"Gammer Gurton's Garland or The Nursery Parnassus\" (1784), published in London by Joseph Johnson.\n19th century.\nIn the early 19th century, printed collections of rhymes began to spread to other countries, including Robert Chambers' \"Popular Rhymes of Scotland\" (1826) and in the United States, \"Mother Goose's Melodies\" (1833). From this period, the origins and authors of rhymes are sometimes known\u2014for instance, in \"Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star\" which combines the melody of an 18th-century French tune \"Ah vous dirai-je, Maman\" with a 19th-century English poem by Jane Taylor entitled \"The Star\" used as lyrics.\nEarly folk song collectors also often collected (what is now known as) nursery rhymes, including in Scotland Sir Walter Scott and in Germany Clemens Brentano and Achim von Arnim in \"Des Knaben Wunderhorn\" (1806\u20131808). The first, and possibly the most important academic collection to focus in this area was James Halliwell-Phillipps' \"The Nursery Rhymes of England\" (1842) and \"Popular Rhymes and Tales\" in 1849, in which he divided rhymes into antiquities (historical), fireside stories, game-rhymes, alphabet-rhymes, riddles, nature-rhymes, places and families, proverbs, superstitions, customs, and nursery songs (lullabies). By the time of Sabine Baring-Gould's \"A Book of Nursery Songs\" (1895), folklore was an academic study full of comments and footnotes. A professional anthropologist, Andrew Lang (1844\u20131912) produced \"The Nursery Rhyme Book\" in 1897.\n20th century.\nThe early years of the 20th century are notable for the illustrations of children's books, including Randolph Caldecott's \"Hey Diddle Diddle Picture Book\" (1909) and Arthur Rackham's \"Mother Goose\" (1913). The definitive study of English rhymes remains the work of Iona and Peter Opie.\nMeanings of nursery rhymes.\nMany nursery rhymes have been argued to have hidden meanings and origins. John Bellenden Ker (1764\u20131842), for example, wrote four volumes arguing that English nursery rhymes were written in \"Low Saxon\", a hypothetical early form of Dutch. He then \"translated\" them back into English, revealing in particular a strong tendency to anti-clericalism. Many of the ideas about the links between rhymes and historical persons, or events, can be traced back to Katherine Elwes' book \"The Real Personages of Mother Goose\" (1930), in which she linked famous nursery rhyme characters with real people, on little or no evidence. She posited that children's songs were a peculiar form of coded historical narrative, propaganda or covert protest, and did not believe that they were written simply for entertainment.\nNursery rhyme revisionism.\nThere have been several attempts across the world to revise nursery rhymes (along with fairy tales and popular songs). As recently as the late 18th century, rhymes like \"Little Robin Redbreast\" were occasionally cleaned up for a young audience. In the late 19th century, the major concern seems to have been violence and crime, which led some children's publishers in the United States like Jacob Abbot and Samuel Goodrich to change Mother Goose rhymes.\nIn the early and mid-20th centuries, this was a form of bowdlerisation, concerned with some of the more violent elements of nursery rhymes and led to the formation of organisations like the British \"Society for Nursery Rhyme Reform\". Psychoanalysts such as Bruno Bettelheim strongly criticised this revisionism, because it weakened their usefulness to both children and adults as ways of symbolically resolving issues and it has been argued that revised versions may not perform the functions of catharsis for children, or allow them to imaginatively deal with violence and danger.\nIn the late 20th century, revisionism of nursery rhymes became associated with the idea of political correctness. Most attempts to reform nursery rhymes on this basis appear to be either very small scale, light-hearted updating, like Felix Dennis's \"When Jack Sued Jill \u2013 Nursery Rhymes for Modern Times\" (2006), or satires written as if from the point of view of political correctness to condemn reform. The controversy in Britain in 1986 over changing the language of \"Baa, Baa, Black Sheep\" because it was alleged in the popular press, that it was seen as racially dubious, was based only on a rewriting of the rhyme in one private nursery, as an exercise for the children.\nNursery rhymes and education.\nIt has been argued that nursery rhymes set to music aid in a child's development. In the German \"Kniereitvers\", the child is put in mock peril, but the experience is a pleasurable one of care and support, which over time the child comes to command for itself. Research also supports the assertion that music and rhyme increase a child's ability in spatial reasoning, which aids mathematics skills.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources"}
{"id": "21732", "revid": "2304267", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21732", "title": "Ninja Tune", "text": "English record label\nNinja Tune is an independent record label based in London, with a satellite office in Los Angeles. It was founded in 1990 by musicians Matt Black and Jonathan More, known collectively as Coldcut. The label was established as an outlet for Coldcut to explore a style distinct from that of the mainstream music industry.\nHistory.\n1990\u20131999.\nFollowing a Coldcut tour in Japan with Norman Cook (a.k.a. Fatboy Slim, then of Beats International) the label lifted its moniker and aesthetic from the Japanese TV shows of the 1950s and 1960s based on the Ninja. With their first releases in the early 1990s, Ninja Tune went on to \"usher in trip-hop/instrumental hip hop.\" according to Pitchfork.\nAfter Coldcut's success with their first label, \"Ahead of Our Time\", contractual issues prevented them from releasing anything under their name. Ninja Tune's inaugural release was Coldcut's (under the name Bogus Order) house break collection \"Zen Brakes Vol. 1\" in 1990. The label's profile increased when Coldcut, as DJ Food, released their funky hip-hop jazz-breaks album, \"Jazz Brakes Vol. 1\", which \"blew up\" in the DJ circuit, according to \"Record Collector\". DJ Food's \"Jazz Brakes\" series were intended as source material for DJs and producers who worked with breaks and beats.\nIn 1992, Peter Quicke joined as label manager, as did Patrick Carpenter, a.k.a. PC, who joined Coldcut as a sound engineer. Steinski, a big inspiration behind Coldcut's initial forays into music, released his first Ninja Tune EP as Steinski and Mass Media in the same year. According to Nate Patrin, the single \"builds on a catchy loop of the Jackson 5's 'It's Great to Be Here' and creates one of the few anti-Gulf War protest songs of the era, transforming [U.S. President George H. W.] Bush's speech into a pop hook ('Regrettably, we now believe/ That only force will make him leave') and interspersing quotes from Jello Biafra ('don't hate the media, become the media!') and Mario Savio's famous 1964 address to the Berkeley Free Speech Movement.\"\nBetween 1994 and 1997, Ninja explored the instrumental hip hop beats sound (often known as trip hop). Its pioneering influence on the genre became more prevalent with the label's first compilation, \"Funkjazztical Tricknology\", in 1995. The genre originated in England as a successor to acid house, taking influence from acid jazz and funk, and using hip hop style breakbeats rather than the mechanical '4 on the floor' drum rhythm of the house. \nThe ongoing success of Solid Steel, and its subsequent syndication across the globe, broadcast the Ninja brand across the airwaves. The late-night Saturday show cut all manner of beats, samples, and loops into a chaotic musical blend. The show's 'everything but the kitchen sink' approach continued through Coldcut's \"utterly brilliant\" \"Journeys by DJ\" series of mix compilations in 1995. The title \"70 Minutes of Madness\" was a nod to Coldcut's earlier Eric B &amp; Rakim remix, and included sounds from Depth Charge, DJ Food, Plastikman, Mantronix, Harold Budd and the Doctor Who theme.\nIn 1994, Matt Black's close friend Mixmaster Morris introduced Matt to Openmind \u2013 a DJ &amp; design collective in Camberwell \u2013 at the Telepathic Fish chill-out club they were running. Openmind included Kevin Foakes a.k.a. Strictly Kev of DJ Food. After submitting a re-styled company logo he was employed by Ninja Tune in the capacity of overall design consultant. Matt Black also invited Foakes to Ninja's recording studio, where he eventually joined the many hands at work on DJ Food's 1995 album, \"Recipe for Disaster\" (which also included Patrick Carpenter a.k.a. PC, Isaac Elliston, Paul Rabiger and Paul Brooks). \nWith their two 1994 albums, \"Paradise Blown\" and \"Electric Lazyland\", 9 Lazy 9 helped spawn the funky, subterranean sound for which Ninja Tune would earn its early acclaim, combining hip hop and funk breakbeats with jazz-influenced sound. \nColdcut's \"Timber\" video \u2013 an AV collage piece using analogous techniques to audio sample collage \u2013 was put on heavy rotation on MTV, and won awards for its innovative use of repetitive video clips synced to the music, including being shortlisted at the Edinburgh Television and Film Festival in their top five music videos of the year in 1998.\nIn 1995, Matt Black created \"Pipe\", Ninja's first website. The label's current website, ninja tune.net, was developed by the following year.\nAlso in 1996, Ninja Tune expanded across the ocean, opening its Montreal office to manage distribution across North America.he book \"Integrated Performance Management\" described Ninja Tunes as devising \"a term that perfectly expresses the antitheses between chaos and order.\"\nn 1997 Ninja Tune's sister label Big Dada was launched. Coldcut's fourth album \"Let Us Play!\" was released in September 1997, making its way to the Top 40, reaching No. 33 in the UK Charts. \"Let Us Play!\" paid homage to the greats that inspired them. Their first album to be released on Ninja Tune, it featured guest appearances by Grandmaster Flash, Steinski, Jello Biafra, Jimpster, The Herbaliser, Talvin Singh, Daniel Pemberton and Selena Saliva. Hex collaborated with Coldcut to produce the multimedia CD-ROM for the album. Hex later evolved the software into the engine that was used on the \"Let Us Play!\" world tour.\nIn 1999, \"Let Us Replay!\" was released, a double-disc remix album where Coldcut's classic tunes were remixed by Cornelius (the opener of the album, which was heralded as a highlight of the album), Irresistible Force, Shut Up and Dance, Carl Craig and J Swinscoe. \"Spin Magazine\" stated that \"Let Us Replay!\" pieces together \"short sharp shocks that put the mental in 'experimental' and still bring the breaks till the breakadawn.\" It also includes a few live tracks from the duo's innovative world tour. The CD-ROM of the album, which also contained a free demo disc of the VJamm software, was one of the earliest audiovisual CD- Roms on the market, and Muzik claimed deserved to \"have them canonized...it's like buying an entire mini studio for under $15.\"\nMr. Scruff's \"Keep It Unreal\" was released in the summer of 1999. Filled with bubbly breakbeats, slick horn sizzles, and bristling house beats, the album opened with BBC Radio 1 DJ Mary Ann Hobbes asking, \"Are you ready Mr. Scruff?\"\nAt some point in 1999, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission decided that DJ Vadim and Sarah Jones' pro-women empowerment record \"Your Revolution\" was \"indecent\" for radio. The decision ended up in court in 2002, where arguments were advanced for freedom of speech, freedom of expression and to argue the double standards of the ban and fine.\n2000\u20132010.\nIn 2000, Ninja Tune celebrated its first decade of music with \"Xen Cuts\", a three CD, 6 x LP box set that provided a collection of their artists. Mark Richardson with Pitchfork called the effort a \"mostly downtempo affair.\" It featured the likes of Latyrx (Lyrics Born and Lateef), The Herbaliser, Kid Koala and Luke Vibert, Clifford Gilberto, Amon Tobin and Funki Porcini.\nAlso in 2000, Kid Koala released \"Carpal Tunnel Syndrome\", \"a playfully arranged montage of quirky sound bites, rhythmic scratching, and fluid hip hop beats.\" Deriving sample material from both comedy albums and sound effects records, and jazz and funk vinyl, the release received much critical success. It was called \"brilliant\" and \"humorous\" in the book \"Minority Report: An Alternative History of English-language Arts in Quebec.\" Kid Koala cut two further highly acclaimed albums for Ninja, 2003's \"Some of My Best Friends Are DJs\" and 2006's \"Your Mom's Favorite DJ\".\nIn 2001, Roots Manuva delivered his second album, \"Run Come Save Me\", which was deemed one of the albums of the year by \"The Independent.\" Similarly, \"Mojo\" described it as \"not just a landmark UK hip hop album, but a landmark hip hop album period\". The album charted at number 33 in the UK Charts. \"Witness (1 Hope)\", the first single off the album, charted at No. 45 and was declared by AllMusic as being \"the best British rap single since Tricky's 'Aftermath'.\" \"Run Come Save Me\" won a nomination for the 2002 Mercury Music Award, and was called by \"The Times\" \"Too maverick, too brilliantly original a talent to be tethered by mere genre or geography.\" \nAlso in 2001 Cornwall's Luke Vibert joined Ninja Tune. Growing up amongst contemporaries Aphex Twin and Tom Middleton/Global Communication, Vibert had made a name for himself in experimental electronica, though his name has always been hard to pin down: he operates under several different aliases. With the moniker Wagon Christ, Vibert released \"Musipal\" on Ninja, which \"NME\" called \"an intriguing procession of cheeky collages.\"\nMr. Scruff's second album on Ninja Tune, \"Trouser Jazz\", was released on 9 September 2002. It charted at 29 on the UK Chart.\nIn 2003, Simon Green, a.k.a. Bonobo, released his first proper Ninja album, \"Dial 'M' for Monkey\", a subliminally seductive collection of atmospheric instrumentals. A live version of Bonobo soon took to the road, which seeped into the production of 2006's \"Days to Come,\" an album that blurs the line between a programmed and live sound and created \"a daydream vibe embedded within its moodiness.\"\nBlurring lines further, Coldcut collaborated with American video mashup artist TV Sheriff in 2004 to produce their cut-up entitled \"Revolution USA\". The tactical-media project (coordinated with Canadian art duo NomIg) followed on from the UK version and extended the premise \"into an open access participatory project,\" according to author Graham Meikle. Through the multimedia political art project, over 12 gigabytes of footage from the last 40 years of US politics were made accessible to download, allowing participants to create a cut-up over a Coldcut beat. Coldcut also collaborated with TV Sheriff and NomIg to produce two audiovisual pieces \"World of Evil\" (2004) and \"Revolution '08\" (2008), both composed of footage from the United States presidential elections of respective years. The music used was composed by Coldcut, with \"Revolution '08\" featuring a remix by The Qemists.\nRoots Manuva climbed back into the limelight at the beginning of 2005, with his deft album \"Awfully Deep\". His third album, which reached number 24 in the UK Charts, was celebrated by critics for his growth as an artist, with \"NME\" calling it \"a set of immense maturity that never rubs your nose in its thematic complexity, compositional innovation, and thunderous thump-beats.\"\nThe Cinematic Orchestra scored a new soundtrack, Man with a Movie Camera, for a screening of the visionary 1929 Russian silent feature, \"Man with a Movie Camera\", for the 2000 Portuguese Film Festival Fantasporto. The following year it was performed at the opening gala of Portugal's year as European Capital of Culture in Porto in front of 3000 people. The material written for this film score laid the groundwork for what would be The Cinematic Orchestra's second full-length, \"Every Day\", released in May 2002, and one of Ninja's best-selling albums. Roots Manuva featured on the track \"All Things to All Men\", which later soundtracked the final scenes of the 2006 movie \"Kidulthood\". The Cinematic Orchestra's albums grew increasingly ambitious over the years, with 2007's \"Ma Fleur\" album marking a move away from beats, and embracing folk influences. The album was based on the work of photographer Maya Hayuk (who commissioned 11 pictures based on three short stories recounting the journey from birth to death), and conceived by Swinscoe as the premise for the score of an imaginary film. Album track \"To Build a Home\" became one of Ninja's top tracks of all time (with its fan video clocking up nearly 9 million plays), and track \"TBAH\" features vocals from Patrick Watson, which became the band's most successful song.\nFollowing Jason Swinscoe's vocal appreciation of Jaga Jazzist's 2001 album \"A Livingroom Hush\", the Norwegian jazz band signed to Ninja Tune to re-release \"A Livingroom Hush\" in 2002, followed by \"The Stix\" later that year, and their fourth album \"What We Must\" in 2005.\nColdcut returned with the single \"Everything Is Under Control\" at the end of 2005, featuring Jon Spencer (of Jon Spencer Blues Explosion) and Mike Ladd. It was followed in 2006 by their fifth studio album \"Sound Mirrors\", which was quoted as being \"one of the most vital and imaginative records Jon More and Matt Black have ever made\", and saw the duo \"continue, impressively, to find new ways to present political statements through a gamut of pristine electronics and breakbeats.\" The fascinating array of guest vocalists included Soweto Kinch, Annette Peacock, Amiri Baraka, and Saul Williams.\nNinja connected with L.A. filmmaker and photographer B+, who had filmed \"Keepintime: Talking Drums Whispering Vinyl\", a short movie documenting a meeting between jazz/funk drummers Paul Humphrey and James Gadson, and a bunch of turntablists who now scratched and sampled their breakbeats, including DJ Shadow, Cut Chemist and the Beat Junkies. This project snowballed into a live concert featuring the drum duo jamming along with the turntablists \u2013 and included extra guests Madlib and DJ Numark. In 2005, Ninja released \"Keep in Time: A Live Recording\", a CD/DVD package that included remixes from King Britt, Oh No, J Rocc, and AmmonContact.\nBack in London, having previously scored a place with his college band E.V.A. on the 1996 Ninja 12\" \"One Track Mind\", Fin Greenall subsequently signed to the label as a solo artist, under the name Fink. First releasing \"Fresh Produce\" \u2013 an atmospheric set of downtempo instrumental hip hop tracks \u2013 on sister label Ntone in 2000, it was 2006's \"Biscuits for Breakfast\" album that set Fink officially on Ninja Tune. And it set him far apart from the rest of the label, going his way to becoming a full-blown, guitar-picking singer-songwriter. Two subsequent full-lengths \u2013 2007's \"Distance and Time\" and 2009's \"Sort of Revolution\" (which featured song-writing collaborations with John Legend) have seen Fink further develop this new sound.\nOn the topic of sound, noise manipulator Amon Tobin came back around at the beginning of 2007 with \"Foley Room\", his sixth studio album, and a long player that was called his \"darkest work yet.\" Tobin was inspired by the work of Foley artists: a Foley room is where the sound effects are recorded for films; Foley artists use their imagination and ingenuity to make the right noise for the situation they are presented with. Amon and a team of assistants headed out into the streets with high-sensitivity microphones and recorded found sounds from tigers roaring to cats eating rats, from wasps to falling chickpeas, kitchen utensils to motorbikes to water dripping from a tap. Added to this were the sounds of The Kronos Quartet, Stefan Schneider (of To Rococo Rot), and Sarah Pag\u00e9, Tobin traveling from Foley rooms in Montreal to San Francisco to Seattle and back as he collected them (the CD release is accompanied by a short DVD, \"Foley Room: Found Footage\", documenting the recording process).\nKevin Martin began developing his sound further as The Bug, after other projects such as GOD, Techno Animal, Ice, and Curse of the Golden Vampire. The Bug's second album in 2003, \"Pressure\", demonstrated a fully formed aesthetic \u2013 stark spaces, gleefully subsonic bass \u2013 holding collaborations with vocalists such as Toastie Taylor, Wayne Lonesome and Daddy Freddy. 2008's \"London Zoo\", meanwhile, was The Bug's third album \u2013 and first for Ninja Tune. Recorded over three years with its maker living in his studio, without a kitchen or shower, the album included collaborations with Warrior Queen, Tippa Irie, Burial, Kode9 collaborator Spaceape, and even singer-toaster Ricky Ranking showing up on three tracks. Erik Martiny said it is a \"multivocal, spoken-sung, collaborative album.\" It appeared in many outlets' \"best of 2008\" lists.\nThe year 2008 launched Ninja Tune's \"You Don't Know\", their sixth official label sampler, and, like its predecessors, contained high-quality picks from their major releases, with select remixes and a few rarities. While 2007's \"Well Deep\" multimedia package shed light on Big Dada, Ninja Cuts drew a healthy cross-section from all three Ninja-associated labels.\n2008 also marked Daedelus' first official Ninja album, \"Love to Make Music To\", after their previous albums \"Exquisite Corpse\" and \"Denies the Day's Demise\" had been licensed by Ninja Tune. The album showcased the L.A. artist's diverse nature and their skills as a multi-instrumentalist as well as their engrossing stylistic shifts. Additionally that year (a year after their 2007 \"Stompbox\" 12\"), The Qemists released their debut album, \"Join the Q.\" AllMusic said that the group had constructed \"some of the most energetic breakbeats of the late 2000s\".\nIn 2008, an international group of party organizers, activists, and artists \u2013 including Coldcut \u2013 received a grant from the Intelligent Energy Department of the European Union, to create a project that promoted intelligent energy and environmental awareness to the youth of Europe. The result was \"Energy Union\", a piece of VJ cinema, a political campaign, a music tour, a party, an art exhibition, and social media hub. \"Energy Union\" toured 12 EU countries throughout 2009 and 2010, completing 24 events in total. Coldcut created the \"Energy Union\" show for the tour, a one-hour Audio/Visual montage on the theme of Intelligent Energy. In presenting new ideas for climate, environmental, and energy communication strategies, the \"Energy Union\" tour was well received, and reached a widespread audience in cities across the UK, Germany, Belgium, The Netherlands, Croatia, Slovenia, Austria, Hungary, Bulgaria, Spain, and the Czech Republic.\nSpeech Debelle's debut album, 2009's \"Speech Therapy\", finally scored Big Dada a Mercury Prize, after prior nominations for Roots Manuva's \"Run Come Save Me\" and Ty's \"Upwards\". With the album, NME called her: \"one to seriously watch.\"\n2010\u2013present.\nA book entitled Ninja Tune: \"20 Years of Beats and Pieces\" was released on 12 August 2010, and an exhibition was held at Black Dog Publishing's Black Dog Space in London showcasing artwork, design, and photography from the label's 20-year history. A \"stunning futurespective\" compilation album was released on 20 September in two formats \u2013 a regular version consisting of two 2-disc volumes, and a limited edition (of 3,500 copies), containing six CDs, six 7\" vinyl singles, a hardback copy of the book, a poster, and additional items. It featured new music from Amon Tobin (also as Two Fingers), Roots Manuva, The Cinematic Orchestra, Kid Koala, Mr. Scruff, The Bug, King Geedorah, Zomby, Bonobo, Toddla T, Daedelus, Dorian Concept, Floating Points, Wagon Christ, cLOUDDEAD and many others. It also included new remixes from Switch, Autechre, Benga, Cut Chemist, Modeselektor, Roots Manuva, Diplo, Gold Panda, Mark Pritchard, Rustie, Prefuse 73, 808 State, Joe Goddard, King Jammy, The Orb, Micachu, Gaslamp Killer, Kronos Quartet, Mala, El-P (and El-B) and many more. In The Independent's \"Album of the Week\" review, the compilation was deemed \"a glorious celebration of Ninja Tune's audio splendor.\"\nAs part of the 20th anniversary, Ninja Tune produced 20 different events around the world. Ninja Tune sold out Royal Albert Hall in London, with The Cinematic Orchestra, Amon Tobin, and Dorian Concept all presenting a one-off orchestral performance with the London Metropolitan Orchestra arranged by composer Ilan Eshkeri. For a separate London event, Ninja also placed a legendary rave in 3 rooms in a car park behind the Tate Modern with all of their artists in one place for the first time (artists included Coldcut, Mr. Scruff, Roots Manuva, Toddla T, The Bug, Daedelus, Kid Koala, Bonobo, Dj Food + DK, Mark Pritchard, DJ Kentaro, Dorian Concept, XXXchange (Spank Rock), DELS, Floating Points, Jammer, Dark Sky, and Offshore). For the Ninja XX gig in New York, the label's venue (Santos Party House) was shut down unexpectedly, moving the event at the last minute to the Bowery.\nIn October 2011, Ninja Tune's massive \"Ninja Tune XX\" campaign won \"Innovative Marketing Campaign of the Year\" at the 2011 AIM Awards.\nIt was around this time that Ninja Tune began expanding its roster in an interesting new direction, co-signing underground labels with whom they felt artistically aligned. In February 2010, LA-based producer Flying Lotus, a.k.a. Steven Ellison, announced his Brainfeeder imprint had partnered with Ninja Tune to handle manufacturing, marketing, and distribution for Brainfeeder everywhere outside the US. In April 2010, Sheffield-born producer and DJ Toddla T (who had originally arrived at Ninja having produced parts of Roots Manuva's 2008 album, \"Slime &amp; Reason\", which reached number 22 in the UK Charts) also signed his Girls Music record label to Ninja Tune for distribution, manufacturing, and marketing, in addition to signing a three-album deal. In June 2012, Ninja announced a partnership with underground artist Actress and his Werkdiscs imprint, home to Zomby's \"Where Were U in 92?\", Actress's \"Hazyville\", and various records by Lukid and Lone.\nAlso in 2010, Bonobo's own \"Black Sands\" album marked his fourth full-length. It pushed Bonobo's sound \"much more steeped in beat-making, creating deluxe, post-dance soundscapes\", and achieved worldwide commercial success. In February 2012, Ninja followed up with a remix album, \"Black Sands Remixed\", which featured re-imaginings from producers such as Lapalux, Mark Pritchard, Machinedrum and FaltyDL.\nA couple of months before, in November 2011, New York producer FaltyDL had made his debut on the Ninja roster with his \"Atlantis\" EP, a \"smoother and shuffler\" ride than most of his earlier work. His work for Ninja was deemed \"calm and focused, a trend that continued on his third album\", \"Hardcourage\", released in January 2012. Ruth Saxelby with Pitchfork said the album was \"sure-footed and big-hearted, accessible and yet cerebral.\"\nJaga Jazzist returned in 2010 with their strongest release to date, \"One-Armed Bandit\", which featured new members within Jaga Jazzist's ranks and included \"tropical polyrhythms, modernist patterns, and even techno-inspired synth sequences.\"\nAnother release that pushed Ninja to new sonic territories came from London-based artist Floating Points at the end of 2010 with 'Post Suite / Almost in Profile'. The Floating Points Ensemble is an instrumental ensemble headed by himself on Fender Rhodes and Sequential Circuits Pro One and Prophet keyboards. The double A-side 10\" vinyl single featured two tracks by the full Ensemble, recorded and mixed at Abbey Road Studios for the Ninja Tune XX twentieth anniversary celebration.\nIn 2010, a sound designer from Berlin (by way of Bristol), Emika, brought a new sound to the label, with her melodic, R&amp;B tinged bass-heavy 'Double Edge.' Her self-titled debut was later released in 2011, Billboard said that Emika came close to \"bridging the minimalist menace\" of Bristol dubstep to \" breathy accessible vocals and classical piano.\" On her 2013 follow-up, 'DVA,' Emika shifted her song writing style, focusing on political and personal themes.\nIn March 2011, another exploratory bass cadet \u2013 Dorian Concept \u2013 released his first Ninja EP, \"Her Tears Taste Like Pears\". It proved to be a \"solid example of the kind of genius Concept, himself something of a child piano prodigy, is capable of.\"\nThe following May saw the release of a much-awaited album from Amon Tobin, \"ISAM\", which set a new benchmark for live electronic music. Tobin decided to step away from previous DJ centric performances, and instead provided a large-scale live audio/visual experience to select cities around the world. Developed alongside V Squared Labs, Leviathan, Vello Virkhaus &amp; Matt Daly, Alex Lazarus, Vitamotus Design Studio, and Stefano Novelli, the show featured a 25' x 14' x 8' multi-dimensional/ shape shifting 3D art installation surrounding Tobin and enveloping him and the audience in a 3D experience. Tobin conceptualized the show as a projection-mapped \"visual score\" to the music from \"ISAM\". The show completed a sold-out 15-show run through US and Canada, in addition to five sold-out UK/EU shows. In 2012, ISAM Live returned with a larger tour, starting at Coachella and traveling to Sydney Opera House, London's Brixton Academy, New York's Hammerstein Ballroom, Greek Theatre (Los Angeles), Sonar (Barcelona), as well as full European and US tours throughout summer and fall. In May 2012, Ninja Tune released an Amon Tobin box set (7 \u00d7 CD, 2 \u00d7 DVD, 6 \u00d7 Vinyl, 10\").\nAt the beginning of 2012, Speech Debelle returned to Big Dada, after much critical speculation about leaving the label. She returned from her Mercury Prize win to release another critically acclaimed album, 'Freedom of Speech.' According to Scottish magazine The Skinny, this album had \"a verve and vigor that more than justify the early hype.\" The \"refreshingly outspoken\" album went on to \"trounce all expectations\" and was awarded CD of the week by Evening Standard.\nIn 2009, Ninja's longest-serving artist, DJ Food a.k.a. Strictly Kev, released the 2009 EP 'One Man's Weird Is Another Man's World,' and its 2010 follow-up 'The Shape of Things That Hum' made up two-thirds of a forthcoming album. In January 2012, 'The Search Engine' was released as the first DJ Food album in 11 years. As an album release event, DJ Food created his most ambitious live gig to date: a bespoke AV live show for London's only public planetarium, in conjunction with astronomers from The Royal Observatory Greenwich, using art from The Search Engine, images from Kev's visual archive, plus a wealth of material provided by the astronomers themselves. Kev adapted his content to fit Montreal's Stratosphere in July.\nIn mid-2012, The Bug announced that after \"London Zoo,\" he set out a new genre and sub-label with Ninja Tune: Acid Ragga. Releasing a set of 7\"s, in June the first Bug track \u2013 \"Can't Take This No More\" \u2013 unleashed featuring the legendary Daddy Freddy, while on the flip \"Rise\" featured Inga Copeland of Hype Williams. The \"Ganja Baby\" 7-inch was released shortly afterward, featuring Daddy Freddy, followed by the 2 x 10\" Filthy EP featuring rapper Danny Brown and long-time collaborator Flowdan.\nIn August 2012, London-based band The Invisible dropped their second album, the \"cerebral yet instantly accessible\" 'Rispah,' on Ninja Tune, having been recorded in Brighton \u2013 with producer Richard File. The trio's self-titled debut album (produced by Matthew Herbert) in 2009 was nominated for the Mercury Prize and selected as critics choice for iTunes album of the year. The band's tongue-in-cheek definition of their style of music is 'Experimental Genre-Spanning Spacepop'.\nIn 2012, Ninja Tune also struck a deal with the game developer United Front Games and their publisher Square Enix for their game \"Sleeping Dogs\". Ninja Tune was featured as an in-game radio channel available to the player during gameplay, one of the ten total. The station featured a select group of works by the real-life Ninja Tune record and their then-artist lineup, including works by Bonobo, Lorn, Emika, Stateless, Two Fingers, and Cinematic Orchestra among others, for a total of 18 tracks.\nNinja Tune scored well at Gilles Peterson's Worldwide Awards 2013, with Brainfeeder winning \"Label of the Year\" \u2013 and Ninja Tune scoring 2nd \u2013 with the public vote. Invisible's \"Rispah\" also won Album of the Year.\nIn typical pioneering fashion, in February 2013, Ninja Tune spearheaded the launch of Beat Delete \u2013 a new service for out-of-press vinyl. The demise of Sony DADC warehouse in Edmonton (destroyed during the London riots in the summer of 2011), left many independent labels ravaged. Ninja Tune launched a website Beat Delete as a pledge scheme enabling fans to partially fund the release of rare collectibles.\nIn April 2013, Coldcut released Ninja Jamm, an iOS music remix app, in collaboration with London-based arts and technology firm Seeper. Geared toward both casual listeners and more experienced DJs and music producers, the freemium app allows users to download and remix \"Tunepacks\" that feature original tracks and mixes by Coldcut, as well as other Ninja artists, creating something new altogether. With what Billboard called the \"intuitive yet deep\" remixer, users can turn instruments on and off, swap between clips, add glitches and effects, trigger and pitch-bend stabs and one-off samples, and change the tempo of the track instantly. Users can additionally record as they mix and instantly upload to SoundCloud or save the mixes locally. Tunepack releases for Ninja Jamm are increasingly synchronized with Ninja Tune releases on conventional formats. To date over 20 tune packs have been released, including Amon Tobin, Bonobo, Coldcut, DJ Food, Martyn, Emika, Machinedrum, Raffertie, Irresistible Force, Falty DL.\nIn March 2013, Bonobo unleashed his highly anticipated follow-up to \"Black Sands\", the triumphant and revelatory \"The North Borders\". Hailed as being sumptuous and accomplished, the album featured Erykah Badu, Motion Audio artist Grey Reverend, British singer Szjerdene and Swedish singer-songwriter Cornelia. Visual artist Cyriak's video for Bonobo's \"Cirrus\" was a cascading visual mantra that hit over 1 million views. The album charted at number 29 on the UK Album Charts. The following November, Bonobo released his contribution to the \"\" series with a 21-track selection, which Bonobo described as ranging \"from neo-classical to more abstract electronic pieces to spiritual jazz.\" Bonobo's popularity in the live spectrum continues to grow, having sold out a Roundhouse Ninja Tune festival in 2013 and Sydney Opera House. He has a live performance scheduled at Alexandra Palace in November 2014.\nAnother popular Ninja Tune artist, Travis Stewart, a.k.a. NYC/Berlin artist Machinedrum signed up with the label in 2013, first releasing \"Eyesdontlie\" that July, a single which XLR8R donned \"quite possibly deeper and more ambitious than anything we've heard from Stewart to date.\" After releasing a second 12\" (\"Gunshotta Ave\") the following month, Machinedrum released his full LP \"Vapor City\" at the end of September 2013. With Pitchfork calling the album \"visceral,\" it is n album about an imaginary metropolis, \"Vapor City\" received much acclaim from critics and DJs alike, even landing three live performances on the Boiler Room (New York, Berlin, and London). Machinedrum claimed it was his biggest and boldest project to date.\nIn January 2014, Big Dada released a deluxe European edition of Killer Mike and El-P's Run the Jewels album, featuring new artwork, a new colour vinyl LP + 12\" release plus deluxe CD and download editions.\nNinja Tune also released Actress' fourth album, \"Ghettoville\" in January 2014. The exquisite\nIn April 2014, new Ninja Tune signing Kelis released a raw soul record entirely produced by TV on the Radio's Dave Sitek. Kelis says of the signing: \"I'm really happy to be partnering with Ninja Tune on my new record. This is the album I've wanted to make for a long time.\"\nIn May 2014, \"UK festival favorite\" Mr. Scruff released his fifth LP on Ninja Tune, entitled \"Friendly Bacteria\". Meanwhile, The Bug is continuing his series of \"Acid Ragga\" singles throughout 2014, leading up to his next full-length later in the year, \"Angels &amp; Devils\". Names that The Bug has worked with on the project (in addition to Inga Copeland and Daddy Freddy) include Death Grips, Gonjasufi, Grouper, JK Flesh (Godflesh/Jesu), The Spaceape, Flowdan, Warrior Queen and Earth's Dylan Carlson.\nOn 2 November 2014, Young Fathers' \"Dead\" entered the official Top 100 UK album chart for the first time, four days after their Mercury success, debuting at 35.\nOn 30 October 2015, Big Dada's Roots Manuva released his 9th studio album entitled \"Bleeds\", receiving positive reviews in most publications, currently holding an 80% score on Metacritic.\nKamasi Washington debut solo recording, \"The Epic\", was released in May 2015 via Flying Lotus' Brainfeeder to critical acclaim.

The album and the track \"Bambro Koyo Ganda\" were nominated for the 60th Annual Grammy Awards for Best Dance Recording and Best Dance/Electronic Album. The album peaked higher in the UK chart (number 5) and in the US (number 59). In 2018, Bonobo's \"Migration\" album also won Album of the Year at the 2017 Electronic Music Awards and Bonobo was also nominated for Live Act of the Year.

The album was released to critical acclaim on 9 March 2018. The album entered the UK Albums Chart at number 28, making it the band's highest-charting album. Due to their support of Palestinians through the BDS movement, the band was dropped from the 2018 Ruhrtriennale line-up.\nBerlin based South Korean Dj and Producer Peggy Gou released her EP \"Once\" in March 2018, with lead single \"It Makes You Forget (Itgehane)\", on which she sings in Korean, receiving widespread radio play on stations like BBC Radio 1, BBC 6 Music and more. This earned Peggy a place on the publication Dazed's top 100 artists of the year.\nFollowing the release of the 'Audio Track 5' EP and live performances at the Strelka Institute (Moscow), Barbican Centre and the Tate Modern, electronic producer and musician Darren Cunningham AKA Actress and the London Contemporary Orchestra released a full album of their collaboration on 25 May 2018 entitled 'LAGEOS'.

She was also rated number 1 in Crack Magazine's \"50 Most Exciting DJs Right Now\" 2017. On 3 August 2018 the Hamburg-based Techno producer and DJ released her album \"Qualm.\" The album currently holds an 82% rating on Metacritic indicating \"Universal acclaim\", with five-star write-ups in publications such as The Guardian.\nThe subsidiary label Technicolour released Yu Su's \"Watermelon Woman\" EP in 2019.\nDesign.\nAs the imprint grew, Ninja became an 'anti-corporate' brand, supporting the work of visual artists, filmmakers, and mavericks of all media through running its club nights and helping disseminate the work of its artists across the globe. From its very beginnings, Ninja Tune sought a strong visual identity. This is in part due to Michael Bartalos (whose original logo was a monochrome woodcut of a hooded ninja brandishing his long sword) and Mark Porter, Matt Black's friend from Oxford, Ninja's first art director who defined the logo and overall aesthetic (in addition to creating Ninja's striking yellow and black in-house record bags), and subsequently became Art Director at The Guardian. It was the arrival of Kevin Foakes as an in-house designer in 1994 that developed the logo to its current international recognition and became largely responsible for some of the label's most iconic artwork. Working as Openmind, Foakes has designed many of Ninja's album sleeves, including memorable covers for Amon Tobin, Coldcut, and Funki Porcini's 2002 album \"Fast Asleep\". He's also commissioned acclaimed outside talent for several key projects.\nFoakes' Ninja logo has found its way in diverse remix forms onto DJ bags (the \"Wax Sack\"), cigarette lighters, T-shirts, turntable slip-mats, iPod skins (bearing the slogan \"Remember vinyl?\"), sunglasses by Japanese company Less Than Human and the label's brand of cigarette rolling papers (\"Ninja Skins\"). French urban vinyl specialists Rolito also marketed a Foakes-designed toy Ninja, who came armed with a 3\" CD of Ninja Tunes.\nEwan Robertson (a.k.a. Offshore) and Oscar Bauer, were integral co-designers for Ninja Tune or Big Dada, responsible for iconic covers such as Wiley's Playtime Is Over\", the Roots Manuva slime-head for \"Slime &amp; Reason\" and Bonobo's \"Black Sands\" triptych.\nSome Ninja Tune artists, meanwhile, design their sleeves. One example is Mr. Scruff, whose cartoon illustrations are emblazoned across much of his catalog and merchandise. Another prodigious cartoonist who designs his sleeves is Kid Koala. Kid Koala's \"Nufonia Must Fall\" graphic novel, published in 2003 by ECW Press in association with Ninja Tune, 2000 debut album, \"Carpal Tunnel Syndrome\", and its 2003 follow-up \"Some of My Best Friends Are DJs\" came accompanied by Koala-illustrated comic books.\nOther unique promotional Ninja Tune items include Coldcut's Top Trump-inspired \"Control Cards\", Amon Tobin ear-plugs, Kid Koala-illustrated playing cards, Mr. Scruff-designed jigsaw puzzles, Scruff-branded tins of tuna-in-brine (to promote his 2008 LP \"Ninja Tuna\", which was available pre-loaded on a tuna-shaped USB stick), The Heavy and TTC-branded condoms, and plastic travelcard wallets emblazoned with artwork from Big Dada's \"Well Deep\" compilation and Roots Manuva's \"Slime &amp; Reason\" album.\nAs part of Ninja Tune's 20th Anniversary in 2010, 3500 Ninja Tune XX box sets were released, all housed in limited edition hi-spec packaging designed and conceived by Ninja artwork legend Openmind. In May 2013, golden ticket holders for Bonobo's Camden Roundhouse gig in London were given a limited edition 12\" for Bonobo's \"Cirrus\", which came in a gatefold plastic cover with \"zoetrope\" viewer stand and art print, with picture disc art by Cyriak. In January 2014, Werkdiscs boss Actress released a boxset for a collection of photos presented by Hard Format, which included \"Ghettoville\" as vinyl and CD, as well as\u2014for the first time on vinyl\u2014a 2 LP white vinyl edition of \"Hazyville\" and CD. The box set also contained a 40-page art book, all carefully encased in a black \"elephant-skinned\" outer box.\nBonobo has collaborated with art director Leif Podhajsky and photographer Pelle Cr\u00e9pin to create covers for some of his albums. The cover of his 2010 album \"Black Sands\" was designed by design studio Oscar &amp; Ewan and features an image taken by Cr\u00e9pin. The three cover photographs form a triptych around Derwentwater in the Lake District. They were taken at each point on the map with each view capturing the place of the next photograph and the last photograph capturing the place of the first. The abstract cover for Bonobo's 2013 follow-up album The North Borders was created by Leif Podhajsky using a polaroid image of a wave. Podhajsky also provides the artwork for Bonobo's Flashlight EP in 2014, its cover art is a gold lava effect forming the inside sleeve glimpsed through tiny holes in a dark grey die-cut cover for the vinyl product. Leif Podhajsky again collaborated with Ninja Tune on the artwork for Kelis' 2014 album \"Food\".\nFor the release of Bonobo's sixth album \"Migration\" in January 2017, the album artwork was designed by Neil Krug. The physical artwork included photography of the Mojave Desert, with Krug capturing footage using a drone. This drone footage would come to form the video for \"Break Apart feat. Rhye\". He drove to the desert in the middle of the night to photograph the area just before sunrise, avoiding the sun's intense heat. The shots were then superimposed with various effects such as flames. The LP was accompanied by a special edition booklet containing meditations on themes from the album, the deluxe version housed in a gold-embossed PVC sleeve.\nIn 2017, Belfast-based duo Bicep released their debut album \"Bicep\", with artwork created by design team Royal Studio in partnership with AnaTypes Type, Xesta Studio and Lyft Studio. Photographs of textures were digitally transformed, modulated, coloured, gridded, and gridded over and over again in hundreds of different formations. These arrangements of textures in different colourways were then sent to Bicep, who would select their highlights from each.\nThe artwork for Young Fathers' 2018 album \"Cocoa Sugar\" was created by photographer Noni Julia &amp; creative director Tom Hingston.\nPartnerships.\nSolid Steel.\nPre-dating Ninja Tune is the radio show Solid Steel, set up by Coldcut in 1988, and later joined by DJ Food and DK. What initially began as a radio show on then-pirate Kiss FM went on to become a weekly 2-hour mix show broadcast online and syndicated to numerous radio stations around the world, with highlights available as a podcast on iTunes. Solid Steel is also the name of a series of DJ mix CDs from the label and various club nights showcasing the talents of the Solid Steel DJs and several Ninja Tune artists.\nThe show, which celebrated its 25th anniversary in 2013, showcases a varied blend of left-field tunes, the broadest beats, and forward-thinking selections. Being a freestyle eclectic mix, the weekly two-hour show was described by The Quietus as being \"the past mashed with the present plus a dash of the future.\"\nIn addition to Solid Steel, Ninja Tune has conducted regularly podcast interviews with their roster under the name \"The Ninja Tune Podcast\".\nBig Dada.\nHip hop label Big Dada was set up by journalist and writer Will Ashon in 1997. Big Dada was created with a similarly open-minded remit to sister label Ninja Tune, traversing the boundaries between hip hop, grime and ragga. Born out of frustration over acts going unappreciated elsewhere, Big Dada swiftly cemented itself as a force in its own right. The name came up about Ashton's love of Kool Keith, who he had described in print as the \"Mac Dada\", as a combination of mac daddy and Dadaism.\nBig Dada began releasing 12\"'s in the summer of 1997, the first couple of which were produced by Luke Vibert. The label's debut release, \"Misanthropic\", featured Alpha Prhyme, a.k.a. Juice Aleem, soon to become a member of crew New Flesh for Old, who would release their own \"Electronic Bombardment\" on Big Dada that September. Since then, Big Dada has become home to some of the most maverick, forward-thinking, and innovative artists in hip hop and beyond, including essential British hip hop artist Roots Manuva (Mercury Prize nominee), Mercury Prize winner Speech Debelle, UK hip hop artist TY (whose 2003 \"Upwards\" album was also Mercury nominated). Roots Manuva's album releases have been integral to the label, including \"Brand New Second Hand\", \"Run Come Save Me\", \"Awfully Deep\", \"Slime &amp; Reason\" and \"4everevolution\". Other notable artists include Diplo, cLOUDDEAD, Juice Aleem, DELS, Young Fathers (Mercury Prize Winner 2014), and Spank Rock, with a roster that's as prolific as it is varied. In the words of The Guardian, \"Heaven help the music hack who tries to pigeonhole Big Dada's output.\"\nIn 2021, the label was relaunched as \"a label run by Black, POC &amp; Minority Ethnic people for Black, POC &amp; Minority Ethnic artists.\"\nBrainfeeder.\nBrainfeeder is an independent record label based in Los Angeles, California, founded by Warp Records recording artist Flying Lotus in 2008, focusing on electronic music and instrumental hip hop amongst other styles of music.\nWerkdiscs.\nWerkdiscs (formerly spelled as Werk Discs) is a British independent record label based in London. Originally a club night started by Darren J. Cunningham a.k.a. Actress, Ben Casey and Gavin Weale in the early 2000s,[11] Werkdiscs released their first record in the summer of 2004.\nNtone.\nNtone, Ninja Tune's first sister label, debuted in 1994, specializing in avant-garde music and more electronically inclined ambiance. Animals on Wheels, Cabbageboy, Hexstatic and Neotropic were among the artists on the bill. According to Peter Quicke, Ntone was \"for ambient and techno and other stuff that did not quite fit Ninja Tune, but that we liked and did not want to limit ourselves from releasing.\" The earliest release, \"AntiStatic\" (TONE 1) by Hex in February 1994, and the final, \"Sunflower\" \"Girl\" (NTONE 45) by Neotropic in 2001, were a collision of spacey dub and mellow ambient house.\nNotable artists.\nNinja Tune: current.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNinja Tune: alumni.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nBig Dada: alumni.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Published by Biblica, the complete NIV was released on October 27, 1978, with a minor revision in 1984 and a major revision in 2011. The NIV relies on recently published critical editions of the original Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek texts.\nBiblica claims that \"the NIV delivers the very best combination of accuracy and readability.\" Over 450 million printed copies of the translation had been distributed as of March 2013, and over 500 million as of March 2023. The NIV is the best-selling translation in the United States.\nHistory.\nBeginnings.\nIn 1955, businessman Howard Long was convinced of the need for a contemporary English translation of the Bible while sharing the gospel with a business associate. He was unhappy with the King James Version that he used to communicate the gospel and was frustrated with its archaic language. He thought, \"Everywhere I go, in Canada, the U.S., anywhere, there are people who would like to read their Bible to their children at night. And they don't have something the children can grasp.\" He shared the frustration with his pastor, Reverend Peter DeJong. Inspired by the need for a Bible in contemporary English, the two men petitioned their denomination, Christian Reformed Church (CRC). After initial rejection and deferral, the CRC endorsed a committee to investigate the issue in 1957.\nThe NIV began with the formation of a small committee to study the value of producing a translation in the common language of the American people and a project of the National Association of Evangelicals in 1957. In 1964, a joint committee of representatives from the Christian Reformed Church and National Association of Evangelicals issued invitations to a translation conference, which met in August 1965 at Trinity Christian College in Palos Heights, Illinois, and made two key decisions. The first was that \"a contemporary English translation of the Bible should be undertaken as a collegiate endeavor of evangelical scholars.\" The second was that a \"continuing committee of fifteen\" should be established to move the work forward. The \"committee of fifteen\" was ultimately named the Committee on Bible Translation (CBT), and the \"Contemporary English Translation\" became the NIV. \nIn 1967, the New York Bible Society (now called Biblica) took responsibility for the project and hired a team of 15 scholars from various Evangelical Christian denominations and from various countries. The initial \"Committee on Bible Translation\" consisted of Leslie Carlson, Edmund Clowney, Ralph Earle, Jr., Burton L. Goddard, R. Laird Harris, Earl S. Kalland, Kenneth Kantzer, Robert H. Mounce, Charles F. Pfeiffer, Charles Caldwell Ryrie, Francis R. Steele, John H. Stek, J. C. Wenger, Stephen W. Paine, and Marten Woudstra. The New Testament was released in 1973 and the full Bible in 1978. A UK version was also released to accommodate differences between American English and British English. \nThe NIV underwent a minor revision in 1984.\nInclusive-language editions.\nIn 1995, a new version of the New Testament and Psalms was published in the UK, and the full Bible followed in 1996 as the \"New International Version Inclusive Language Edition\", but it was not published in the US because of opposition from conservative evangelical groups there to gender-neutral language. A further edition with minor edits was published in 1999.\nA revised English edition, \"Today's New International Version\" (TNIV), again used gender-neutral language and was released as a New Testament in March 2002, with the complete Bible being published in February 2005.\n2011 update.\nIn 2011, an updated version of the NIV was released, with both the 1984 version and the TNIV being discontinued.\nThe update modified and dropped some of the gender-neutral language compared to TNIV, which included going back to using \"mankind\" and \"man,\" rather than \"human beings\" and \"people.\" Keith Danby, the president and chief executive officer of Biblica, speaking of the TNIV, said that they had failed to convince people that revisions were needed and that they had underestimated their readers' loyalty to the 1984 edition.\nDerivative versions.\nPlain English version (NIrV).\nAn easier to read version, \"New International Reader's Version\" (NIrV), was published in 1996. It was written at a third-grade reading level to grant the ability to read the Bible to those with limited English literacy.\nSpanish version (NVI).\nIn 1979, the decision was made to produce a version of the New Testament in Spanish with the title La Santa Biblia, Nueva Versi\u00f3n Internacional (often abbreviated NVI), but that version was based only on the former English translation of the historic manuscripts. In 1990, the committee on Bible translation headed by Drs. Ren\u00e9 Padilla and Luciano Jaramillo conducted a translation of both testaments from the historic manuscripts directly into Spanish, bypassed English altogether, and produced a complete Spanish NVI Bible in 1999.\nPortuguese version (NVI).\nIn 2001, the Nova Vers\u00e3o Internacional in Portuguese was published.\nTextual basis.\nThe manuscript base for the Old Testament was the Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia Masoretic Hebrew Text. Other ancient texts consulted were the Dead Sea Scrolls, the Septuagint, the Samaritan Pentateuch, the Aquila, Symmachus and Theodotion, the Latin Vulgate, the Syriac Peshitta, the Aramaic Targum, and, for the Psalms, the Juxta Hebraica of Jerome. The manuscript base for the New Testament was the Koine Greek language editions of the United Bible Societies and of Nestle-Aland. The deuterocanonical books are not included in the translation.\nTranslation methodology.\nThe core translation group consisted of fifteen Biblical scholars using Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek texts whose goal was to produce a more modern English language text than the King James Version. The translation took ten years and involved a team of over 100 scholars from the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa. The range of those participating included many different denominations, such as Anglican, Catholic, Assemblies of God, Baptist, Christian Reformed, Lutheran and Presbyterian.\nThe NIV is a balance between word-for-word and thought-for-thought or literal and phrase-by-phrase translations.\nRecent archaeological and linguistic discoveries helped in understanding passages that have traditionally been difficult to translate. Familiar spellings of traditional translations were generally retained.\nReception.\nAccording to NIV translator Mark Strauss, the New International Version has become the most popular selling English translation of the Bible, having sold more than 500 million copies worldwide.\nThere are numerous study Bibles available with extensive notes on the text and background information to make the Biblical stories more comprehensible. Among these are the \"NIV Spirit of the Reformation Study Bible\", \"Concordia Study Bible\", the Zondervan published \"NIV Study Bible\", the Wesleyan revision, \"Reflecting God Study Bible\", as well as the \"Life Application Study Bible\".\nIn 2009, the New Testament scholar N. T. Wright wrote that the NIV obscured what Paul the Apostle was saying and ensured that Paul's words conformed to Protestant and Evangelical tradition. He claimed, \"if a church only, or mainly, relies on the NIV it will, quite simply, never understand what Paul was talking about,\" especially in Galatians and Romans.\nIn support of that claim, Wright specifically mentioned several verses of Romans 3, which he suggested not to convey how \"righteousness\" refers to the covenant faithfulness of God or reflect his own thinking about the \"pistis Christou\" debate. All editions of the NIV have given \"God's Faithfulness\" as the heading for Romans 3:1\u20138. Wright's specific objections concerning verses later in the chapter no longer apply to the 2011 revision of the NIV, which moreover offers \"the faithfulness of Jesus Christ\" as an alternative translation to \"faith in Jesus Christ\" in Romans 3:22.\nMark Given, a professor of religious studies at Missouri State University, criticized the NIV for \"several inaccurate and misleading translations\" since many sentences and clauses are paraphrased, rather than translated from Hebrew and Greek.\nMichael Marlowe, a scholar in biblical languages, criticized as \"indefensible\" the footnote provided in the NIV for , which replaced multiple instances of \"head covering\" with \"long hair\" to \"harmonize this passage with modern habits of dress.\" Church historian David Bercot, whose focus is early Christianity, likewise deemed the footnote a \"fanciful interpretation\" that \"is in no way an alternate translation of the Greek text.\"\nOthers have also criticized the NIV. In Genesis 2:19, a translation such as the New Revised Standard Version uses \"formed\" in the simple past tense: \"So out of the ground the LORD God formed every animal.\" Some have questioned the NIV's choice to use the pluperfect: \"Now the LORD God had formed out of the ground all the wild animals\" to try to make it appear that the animals had already been created. Theologian John Sailhamer stated, \"Not only is such a translation[...] hardly possible[...] but it misses the very point of the narrative, namely, that the animals were created in response to God's declaration that it was not good that the man should be alone.\"\nBiblical scholar Bruce M. Metzger criticized the NIV 1984 edition for the addition of \"just\" into Jeremiah 7:22 in which the verse becomes \"For when I brought your forefathers/ancestors out of Egypt and spoke to them, I did not \"just\" give them commands about burnt offerings and sacrifices.\" Metzger also criticized the addition of \"your\" into Matthew 13:32, which becomes \"Though it [the mustard seed] is the smallest of all \"your\" seeds.\" The word \"your\" was removed from that verse in the 2011 revision.\n2011 revision.\nProfessor of New Testament Studies Daniel B. Wallace praised the 2011 update and called it \"a well-thought out translation, with checks and balances through rigorous testing, overlapping committees to ensure consistency and accuracy, and a publisher willing to commit significant resources to make this Bible appealing to the Christian reader.\" The Southern Baptist Convention rejected the 2011 update because of gender-neutral language, although the update had dropped some gender-neutral language used in the 2005 revision.\nSouthern Baptist publisher LifeWay declined the Southern Baptist Convention's censor request to remove the NIV from its stores. While the Lutheran Church\u2013Missouri Synod rejected its use, some in the Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod (WELS) believe many of the translations changes are right and defensible.\nProfessor of New Testament Studies Rodney J. Decker wrote in the \"Themelios Journal\" review of the NIV 2011:\nBy taking a mediating position between formal and functional equivalence (though tending, I think, closer to the formal end of the spectrum), the NIV has been able to produce a text that is clearer than many translations, especially those weighted more heavily with formal equivalence... If we are serious about making the word of God a vital tool in the lives of English-speaking Christians, then we must aim for a translation that communicates clearly in the language of the average English-speaking person. It is here that the NIV excels. It not only communicates the meaning of God's revelation accurately, but does so in English that is easily understood by a wide range of English speakers. It is as well-suited for expository preaching as it is for public reading and use in Bible classes and children's ministries.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Its precursor, the German Workers' Party (; DAP), existed from 1919 to 1920. The Nazi Party emerged from the extremist German nationalist (\"\"V\u00f6lkisch\" nationalist\"), racist, and populist paramilitary culture, which fought against communist uprisings in post\u2013World War\u00a0I Germany. The party was created to draw workers away from communism and into nationalism. Initially, Nazi political strategy focused on anti-big business, anti-bourgeoisie, and anti-capitalism, disingenuously using socialist rhetoric to gain the support of the lower middle class; that was later downplayed to gain the support of business leaders. By the 1930s, the party's main focus shifted to antisemitic and anti-Marxist themes. The party had little popular support until the Great Depression, when worsening living standards and widespread unemployment drove Germans into political extremism.\nCentral to Nazism were themes of racial segregation expressed in the idea of a \"people's community\" (). The party aimed to unite \"racially desirable\" Germans as national comrades while excluding those deemed to be either political dissidents, physically or intellectually inferior, or of a foreign race (). The Nazis sought to strengthen the Germanic people, the \"Aryan master race\", through racial purity and eugenics, broad social welfare programs, and a collective subordination of individual rights, which could be sacrificed for the good of the state on behalf of the people. To protect the supposed purity and strength of the Aryan race, the Nazis sought to disenfranchise, segregate, and eventually exterminate Jews, Romani, Slavs, the physically and mentally disabled, homosexuals, Jehovah's Witnesses, and political opponents. The persecution reached its climax when the party-controlled German state set in motion the Final Solution \u2013 an industrial system of genocide that carried out mass murders of around 6\u00a0million Jews and millions of other targeted victims in what has become known as the Holocaust.\nAdolf Hitler, the party's leader since 1921, was appointed Chancellor of Germany by President Paul von Hindenburg on 30\u00a0January 1933, and quickly seized power afterwards. Hitler established a totalitarian regime known as the Third Reich and became dictator with absolute power. \nFollowing the military defeat of Germany in World War II, the party was declared illegal. The Allies attempted to purge German society of Nazi elements in a process known as denazification. Several top leaders were tried and found guilty of crimes against humanity in the Nuremberg trials, and executed. The use of symbols associated with the party is still outlawed in many European countries, including Germany and Austria.\nName.\nThe renaming of the German Workers' Party (DAP) to the National Socialist German Workers' Party (NSDAP) was partially driven by a desire to draw upon both left-wing and right-wing ideals, with \"Socialist\" and \"Workers'\" appealing to the left, and \"National\" and \"German\" appealing to the right. , the informal and originally derogatory term for a party member, abbreviates the party's name ( ), and was coined in analogy with (pronounced ), an abbreviation of (member of the rival Social Democratic Party of Germany). Members of the party referred to themselves as (National Socialists), but some did occasionally embrace the colloquial (such as Leopold von Mildenstein in his article series \"Ein Nazi f\u00e4hrt nach Pal\u00e4stina\" published in in 1934). The term (party member) was commonly used among Nazis, with its corresponding feminine form .\nBefore the rise of the party, these terms had been used as colloquial and derogatory words for a backward peasant, or an awkward and clumsy person. It derived from Ignaz, a shortened version of Ignatius, which was a common name in the Nazis' home region of Bavaria. Opponents seized on this, and the long-existing , to attach a dismissive nickname to the National Socialists.\nIn 1933, when Adolf Hitler assumed power in the German government, the usage of \"Nazi\" diminished in Germany, although Austrian anti-Nazis continued to use the term. The use of \"Nazi Germany\" and \"Nazi regime\" was popularised by anti-Nazis and German exiles abroad. Thereafter, the term spread into other languages and eventually was brought back to Germany after World War II. In English, the term is not considered slang and has such derivatives as Nazism and denazification.\nHistory.\nOrigins and early years: 1918\u20131923.\nThe Nazi Party grew out of smaller political groups with a nationalist orientation that formed in the last years of World War\u00a0I. In 1918, a league called the (Free Workers' Committee for a good Peace) was created in Bremen, Germany. On 7 March 1918, Anton Drexler, an avid German nationalist, formed a branch of this league in Munich. Drexler was a local locksmith who had been a member of the militarist Fatherland Party during World War I and was bitterly opposed to the armistice of November 1918 and the revolutionary upheavals that followed. Drexler followed the views of militant nationalists of the day, such as opposing the Treaty of Versailles, having antisemitic, anti-monarchist and anti-Marxist views, as well as believing in the superiority of Germans whom they claimed to be part of the Aryan \"master race\" (). However, he also accused international capitalism of being a Jewish-dominated movement and denounced capitalists for war profiteering in World War I. Drexler saw the political violence and instability in Germany as the result of the Weimar Republic being out-of-touch with the masses, especially the lower classes. Drexler emphasised the need for a synthesis of nationalism with a form of economic socialism, in order to create a popular nationalist-oriented workers' movement that could challenge the rise of communism and internationalist politics. These were all well-known themes popular with various Weimar paramilitary groups such as the .\nDrexler's movement received attention and support from some influential figures. Supporter Dietrich Eckart, a well-to-do journalist, brought military figure Felix Graf von Bothmer, a prominent supporter of the concept of \"national socialism\", to address the movement. Later in 1918, Karl Harrer (a journalist and member of the Thule Society) convinced Drexler and several others to form the (Political Workers' Circle). The members met periodically for discussions with themes of nationalism and racism directed against Jewish people. In December 1918, Drexler decided that a new political party should be formed, based on the political principles that he endorsed, by combining his branch of the Workers' Committee for a good Peace with the Political Workers' Circle.\nOn 5 January 1919, Drexler created a new political party and proposed it should be named the \"German Socialist Workers' Party\", but Harrer objected to the term \"socialist\"; so the term was removed and the party was named the German Workers' Party (, DAP). To ease concerns among potential middle-class supporters, Drexler made clear that unlike Marxists the party supported the middle-class and that its socialist policy was meant to give social welfare to German citizens deemed part of the Aryan race. They became one of many \"v\u00f6lkisch\" movements that existed in Germany. Like other groups, the DAP advocated the belief that through profit-sharing instead of socialisation Germany should become a unified \"people's community\" () rather than a society divided along class and party lines. This ideology was explicitly antisemitic. As early as 1920, the party was raising money by selling a tobacco called .\nFrom the outset, the DAP was opposed to non-nationalist political movements, especially on the left, including the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) and the Communist Party of Germany (KPD). Members of the DAP saw themselves as fighting against \"Bolshevism\" and anyone considered a part of or aiding so-called \"international Jewry\". The DAP was also deeply opposed to the Treaty of Versailles. The DAP did not attempt to make itself public and meetings were kept in relative secrecy, with public speakers discussing what they thought of Germany's present state of affairs, or writing to like-minded societies in Northern Germany.\nThe DAP was a comparatively small group with fewer than 60 members. Nevertheless, it attracted the attention of the German authorities, who were suspicious of any organisation that appeared to have subversive tendencies. In July 1919, while stationed in Munich, army Adolf Hitler was appointed a (intelligence agent) of an (reconnaissance unit) of the (army) by Captain Mayr, the head of the \"Education and Propaganda Department\" (Dept Ib/P) in Bavaria. Hitler was assigned to influence other soldiers and to infiltrate the DAP. While Hitler was initially unimpressed by the meetings and found them disorganised, he enjoyed the discussion that took place. While attending a party meeting on 12 September 1919 at Munich's Sterneckerbr\u00e4u, Hitler became involved in a heated argument with a visitor, Professor Baumann, who questioned the soundness of Gottfried Feder's arguments against capitalism; Baumann proposed that Bavaria should break away from Prussia and found a new South German nation with Austria. In vehemently attacking the man's arguments, Hitler made an impression on the other party members with his oratorical skills; according to Hitler, the \"professor\" left the hall acknowledging unequivocal defeat. Drexler encouraged him to join the DAP. On the orders of his army superiors, Hitler applied to join the party and within a week was accepted as party member 555 (the party began counting membership at 500 to give the impression they were a much larger party). Among the party's earlier members were Ernst R\u00f6hm of the Army's District Command VII; Dietrich Eckart, who has been called the spiritual father of National Socialism; then-University of Munich student Rudolf Hess; soldier Hans Frank; and Alfred Rosenberg, often credited as the philosopher of the movement. All were later prominent in the Nazi regime.\nHitler later claimed to be the seventh party member. He was, in fact, the seventh executive member of the party's central committee and he would later wear the Golden Party Badge number one. Anton Drexler drafted a letter to Hitler in 1940\u2014which was never sent\u2014that contradicts Hitler's later claim:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;No one knows better than you yourself, my F\u00fchrer, that you were never the seventh member of the party, but at best the seventh member of the committee... And a few years ago I had to complain to a party office that your first proper membership card of the DAP, bearing the signatures of Sch\u00fcssler and myself, was falsified, with the number 555 being erased and number 7 entered.\nAlthough Hitler initially wanted to form his own party, he claimed to have been convinced to join the DAP because it was small and he could eventually become its leader. He consequently encouraged the organisation to become less of a debating society, which it had been previously, and more of an active political party. Normally, enlisted army personnel were not allowed to join political parties. In this case, Hitler had Captain Karl Mayr's permission to join the DAP. Further, Hitler was allowed to stay in the army and receive his weekly pay of 20 gold marks a week. Unlike many other members of the organisation, this continued employment provided him with enough money to dedicate himself more fully to the DAP.\nHitler's first DAP speech was held in the Hofbr\u00e4ukeller on 16 October 1919. He was the second speaker of the evening, and spoke to 111 people. Hitler later declared that this was when he realised he could really \"make a good speech\". At first, Hitler spoke only to relatively small groups, but his considerable oratory and propaganda skills were appreciated by the party leadership. With the support of Anton Drexler, Hitler became chief of propaganda for the party in early 1920. Hitler began to make the party more public, and organised its biggest meeting yet of 2,000 people on 24 February 1920 in the . Such was the significance of this particular move in publicity that Karl Harrer resigned from the party in disagreement. It was in this speech that Hitler enunciated the twenty-five points of the German Workers' Party manifesto that had been drawn up by Drexler, Feder and himself. Through these points he gave the organisation a much bolder stratagem with a clear foreign policy (abrogation of the Treaty of Versailles, a Greater Germany, Eastern expansion and exclusion of Jews from citizenship) and among his specific points were: confiscation of war profits, abolition of unearned incomes, the State to share profits of land and land for national needs to be taken away without compensation. In general, the manifesto was antisemitic, anti-capitalist, anti-democratic, anti-Marxist and anti-liberal. To increase its appeal to larger segments of the population, on the same day as Hitler's speech on 24 February 1920, the DAP changed its name to the (\"National Socialist German Workers' Party\", or Nazi Party). The name was intended to draw upon both left-wing and right-wing ideals, with \"Socialist\" and \"Workers'\" appealing to the left, and \"National\" and \"German\" appealing to the right. The word \"Socialist\" was added by the party's executive committee (at the suggestion of Rudolf Jung), over Hitler's initial objections, in order to help appeal to left-wing workers.\nIn 1920, the Nazi Party officially announced that only persons of \"pure Aryan descent []\" could become party members and if the person had a spouse, the spouse also had to be a \"racially pure\" Aryan. Party members could not be related either directly or indirectly to a so-called \"non-Aryan\". Even before it had become legally forbidden by the Nuremberg Laws in 1935, the Nazis banned sexual relations and marriages between party members and Jews. Party members found guilty of (\"racial defilement\") were persecuted heavily. Some members were even sentenced to death.\nHitler quickly became the party's most active orator, appearing in public as a speaker 31 times within the first year after his self-discovery. Crowds began to flock to hear his speeches. Hitler always spoke about the same subjects: the Treaty of Versailles and the Jewish question. This deliberate technique and effective publicising of the party contributed significantly to his early success, about which a contemporary poster wrote: \"Since Herr Hitler is a brilliant speaker, we can hold out the prospect of an extremely exciting evening\". Over the following months, the party continued to attract new members, while remaining too small to have any real significance in German politics. By the end of the year, party membership was recorded at 2,000, many of whom Hitler and R\u00f6hm had brought into the party personally, or for whom Hitler's oratory had been their reason for joining.\nHitler's talent as an orator and his ability to draw new members, combined with his characteristic ruthlessness, soon made him the dominant figure. However, while Hitler and Eckart were on a fundraising trip to Berlin in June 1921, a mutiny broke out within the party in Munich. Members of its executive committee wanted to merge with the rival German Socialist Party (DSP). Upon returning to Munich on 11 July, Hitler angrily tendered his resignation. The committee members realised that his resignation would mean the end of the party. Hitler announced he would rejoin on condition that he would replace Drexler as party chairman, and that the party headquarters would remain in Munich. The committee agreed, and he rejoined the party on 26 July as member 3,680. Hitler continued to face some opposition within the NSDAP, as his opponents had Hermann Esser expelled from the party and they printed 3,000 copies of a pamphlet attacking Hitler as a traitor to the party. In the following days, Hitler spoke to several packed houses and defended himself and Esser to thunderous applause.\nHitler's strategy proved successful; at a special party congress on 29 July 1921, he replaced Drexler as party chairman by a vote of 533to1. The committee was dissolved, and Hitler was granted nearly absolute powers in the party as its sole leader. He would hold the post for the remainder of his life. Hitler soon acquired the title (\"leader\") and after a series of sharp internal conflicts it was accepted that the party would be governed by the (\"leader principle\"). Under this principle, the party was a highly centralised entity that functioned strictly from the top down, with Hitler at the apex. Hitler saw the party as a revolutionary organisation, whose aim was the overthrow of the Weimar Republic, which he saw as controlled by the socialists, Jews and the \"November criminals\", a term invented to describe alleged elements of society who had 'betrayed the German soldiers' in 1918. The SA (\"storm troopers\", also known as \"Brownshirts\") were founded as a party militia in 1921 and began violent attacks on other parties.\nFor Hitler, the twin goals of the party were always German nationalist expansionism and antisemitism. These two goals were fused in his mind by his belief that Germany's external enemies\u2014Britain, France and the Soviet Union\u2014were controlled by the Jews and that Germany's future wars of national expansion would necessarily entail a war of annihilation against them. For Hitler and his principal lieutenants, national and racial issues were always dominant. This was symbolised by the adoption as the party emblem of the swastika. In German nationalist circles, the swastika was considered a symbol of an \"Aryan race\" and it symbolised the replacement of the Christian Cross with allegiance to a National Socialist State.\nThe Nazi Party grew significantly during 1921 and 1922, partly through Hitler's oratorical skills, partly through the SA's appeal to unemployed young men, and partly because there was a backlash against socialist and liberal politics in Bavaria as Germany's economic problems deepened and the weakness of the Weimar regime became apparent. The party recruited former World War\u00a0I soldiers, to whom Hitler as a decorated frontline veteran could particularly appeal, as well as small businessmen and disaffected former members of rival parties. Nazi rallies were often held in beer halls, where downtrodden men could get free beer. The Hitler Youth was formed for the children of party members. The party also formed groups in other parts of Germany. Julius Streicher in Nuremberg was an early recruit and became editor of the racist magazine . In December 1920, the Nazi Party had acquired a newspaper, the , of which its leading ideologist Alfred Rosenberg became editor. Others to join the party around this time were Heinrich Himmler and World War I flying ace Hermann G\u00f6ring.\nAdoption of Italian fascism: The Beer Hall Putsch.\nOn 31 October 1922, a fascist party with similar policies and objectives came into power in Italy, the National Fascist Party, under the leadership of the charismatic Benito Mussolini. The Fascists, like the Nazis, promoted a national rebirth of their country, as they opposed communism and liberalism; appealed to the working-class; opposed the Treaty of Versailles; and advocated the territorial expansion of their country. Hitler was inspired by Mussolini and the Fascists, beginning to adopt elements of their program for the Nazi Party and himself. The Italian Fascists also used a straight-armed Roman salute and wore black-shirted uniforms; Hitler would later borrow their use of the straight-armed salute as a Nazi salute.\nWhen the Fascists took control of Italy through their coup d'\u00e9tat called the \"March on Rome\", Hitler began planning his own coup less than a month later. In January 1923, France occupied the Ruhr industrial region as a result of Germany's failure to meet its reparations payments. This led to economic chaos, the resignation of Wilhelm Cuno's government and an attempt by the German Communist Party (KPD) to stage a revolution. The reaction to these events was an upsurge of nationalist sentiment. Nazi Party membership grew sharply to about 20,000, compared to the approximate 6,000 at the beginning of 1923. By November 1923, Hitler had decided that the time was right for an attempt to seize power in Munich, in the hope that the (the post-war German military) would mutiny against the Berlin government and join his revolt. In this, he was influenced by former General Erich Ludendorff, who had become a supporter\u2014though not a member\u2014of the Nazis.\nOn the night of 8 November, the Nazis used a patriotic rally in a Munich beer hall to launch an attempted (\"coup d'\u00e9tat\"). This so-called Beer Hall Putsch attempt failed almost at once when the local commanders refused to support it. On the morning of 9 November, the Nazis staged a march of about 2,000 supporters through Munich in an attempt to rally support. The two groups exchanged fire, after which 15 putschists, four police officers, and a bystander lay dead. Hitler, Ludendorff and a number of others were arrested and were tried for treason in March 1924. Hitler and his associates were given very lenient prison sentences. While Hitler was in prison, he wrote his semi-autobiographical political manifesto (\"My Struggle\").\nThe Nazi Party was banned on 9 November 1923; however, with the support of the nationalist V\u00f6lkisch-Social Bloc (), it continued to operate under the name \"German Party\" ( or DP) from 1924 to 1925. The Nazis failed to remain unified in the DP, as in the north, the right-wing Volkish nationalist supporters of the Nazis moved to the new German V\u00f6lkisch Freedom Party, leaving the north's left-wing Nazi members, such as Joseph Goebbels retaining support for the party.\nRise to power: 1925\u20131933.\nPardoned by the Bavarian Supreme Court, Hitler was released from prison on 20 December 1924, against the state prosecutor's objections. On 16 February 1925, Hitler convinced the Bavarian authorities to lift the ban on the NSDAP and the party was formally refounded on 26 February 1925, with Hitler as its undisputed leader. It was at this time Hitler began referring to himself as \"der F\u00fchrer\". The new Nazi Party was no longer a paramilitary organisation and disavowed any intention of taking power by force. In any case, the economic and political situation had stabilised and the extremist upsurge of 1923 had faded, so there was no prospect of further revolutionary adventures. Instead, Hitler intended to alter the party's strategy to achieving power through what he called the \"path of legality\". The Nazi Party of 1925 was divided into the \"Leadership Corps\" () appointed by Hitler and the general membership (). The party and the SA were kept separate and the legal aspect of the party's work was emphasised. In a sign of this, the party began to admit women. The SA and the SS members (the latter founded in 1925 as Hitler's bodyguard, and known originally as the ) had to all be regular party members.\nIn the 1920s the Nazi Party expanded beyond its Bavarian base. At this time, it began surveying voters in order to determine what they were dissatisfied with in Germany, allowing Nazi propaganda to be altered accordingly. Catholic Bavaria maintained its right-wing nostalgia for a Catholic monarch; and Westphalia, along with working-class \"Red Berlin\", were always the Nazis' weakest areas electorally, even during the Third Reich itself. The areas of strongest Nazi support were in rural Protestant areas such as Schleswig-Holstein, Mecklenburg, Pomerania and East Prussia. Depressed working-class areas such as Thuringia also produced a strong Nazi vote, while the workers of the Ruhr and Hamburg largely remained loyal to the Social Democrats, the Communist Party of Germany or the Catholic Centre Party. Nuremberg remained a Nazi Party stronghold, and the first Nuremberg Rally was held there in 1927. These rallies soon became massive displays of Nazi paramilitary power and attracted many recruits. The Nazis' strongest appeal was to the lower middle-classes\u2014farmers, public servants, teachers and small businessmen\u2014who had suffered most from the inflation of the 1920s, so who feared Bolshevism more than anything else. The small business class was receptive to Hitler's antisemitism, since it blamed Jewish big business for its economic problems. University students, disappointed at being too young to have served in the War of 1914\u20131918 and attracted by the Nazis' radical rhetoric, also became a strong Nazi constituency. By 1929, the party had 130,000 members.\nThe party's nominal Deputy Leader was Rudolf Hess, but he had no real power in the party. By the early 1930s, the senior leaders of the party after Hitler were Heinrich Himmler, Joseph Goebbels and Hermann G\u00f6ring. Beneath the Leadership Corps were the party's regional leaders, the , each of whom commanded the party in his (\"region\"). Goebbels began his ascent through the party hierarchy as of Berlin-Brandenburg in 1926. Streicher was of Franconia, where he published his antisemitic newspaper . Beneath the were lower-level officials, the (\"county leaders\"), (\"cell leaders\") and (\"block leaders\"). This was a strictly hierarchical structure in which orders flowed from the top and unquestioning loyalty was given to superiors. Only the SA retained some autonomy. Being composed largely of unemployed workers, many SA men took the Nazis' socialist rhetoric seriously. At this time, the Hitler salute (borrowed from the Italian fascists) and the greeting \"Heil Hitler!\" were adopted throughout the party.\nThe Nazis contested elections to the national parliament (the ) and to the state legislature (the ) from 1924, although at first with little success. The \"National Socialist Freedom Movement\" polled 3% of the vote in the December 1924 \"Reichstag\" elections and this fell to 2.6% in 1928. State elections produced similar results. Despite these poor results and despite Germany's relative political stability and prosperity during the later 1920s, the Nazi Party continued to grow. This was partly because Hitler, who had no administrative ability, left the party organisation to the head of the secretariat, Philipp Bouhler, the party treasurer Franz Xaver Schwarz and business manager Max Amann. The party had a capable propaganda head in Gregor Strasser, who was promoted to national organizational leader in January 1928. These men gave the party efficient recruitment and organizational structures. The party also owed its growth to the gradual fading away of competitor nationalist groups, such as the German National People's Party (DNVP). As Hitler became the recognised head of the German nationalists, other groups declined or were absorbed. In the late 1920s, seeing the party's lack of breakthrough into the mainstream, Goebbels proposed that instead of focusing all of their propaganda in major cities where there was competition from other political movements, they should instead begin holding rallies in rural areas where they would be more effective.\nDespite these strengths, the Nazi Party might never have come to power had it not been for the Great Depression and its effects on Germany. By 1930, the German economy was beset with mass unemployment and widespread business failures. The Social Democrats and Communists were bitterly divided and unable to formulate an effective solution: this gave the Nazis their opportunity and Hitler's message, blaming the crisis on the Jewish financiers and the Bolsheviks, resonated with wide sections of the electorate. At the September 1930 \"Reichstag\" elections, the Nazis won 18% of the votes and became the second-largest party in the after the Social Democrats. Hitler proved to be a highly effective campaigner, pioneering the use of radio and aircraft for this purpose. His dismissal of Strasser and his appointment of Goebbels as the party's propaganda chief were major factors. While Strasser had used his position to promote his own leftish version of national socialism, Goebbels was completely loyal to Hitler, and worked only to improve Hitler's image.\nThe 1930 elections changed the German political landscape by weakening the traditional nationalist parties, the DNVP and the DVP, leaving the Nazis as the chief alternative to the discredited Social Democrats and the Zentrum, whose leader, Heinrich Br\u00fcning, headed a weak minority government. The inability of the democratic parties to form a united front, the self-imposed isolation of the Communists and the continued decline of the economy, all played into Hitler's hands. He now came to be seen as \"de facto\" leader of the opposition and donations poured into the Nazi Party's coffers. Some major business figures, such as Fritz Thyssen, were Nazi supporters and gave generously and some Wall Street figures were allegedly involved, but many other businessmen were suspicious of the extreme nationalist tendencies of the Nazis and preferred to support the traditional conservative parties instead.\nIn 1930, as the price for joining a coalition government of the \"Land\" (state) of Thuringia, the Nazi Party received the state ministries of the Interior and Education. On 23 January 1930, Wilhelm Frick was appointed to these ministries, becoming the first Nazi to hold a ministerial-level post at any level in Germany.\nIn 1931 the Nazi Party altered its strategy to engage in perpetual campaigning across the country, even outside of election time. During 1931 and into 1932, Germany's political crisis deepened. Hitler ran for president against the incumbent Paul von Hindenburg in March 1932, polling 30% in the first round and 37% in the second against Hindenburg's 49% and 53%. By now the SA had 400,000 members and its running street battles with the SPD and Communist paramilitaries (who also fought each other) reduced some German cities to combat zones. Paradoxically, although the Nazis were among the main instigators of this disorder, part of Hitler's appeal to a frightened and demoralised middle class was his promise to restore law and order. Overt antisemitism was played down in official Nazi rhetoric, but was never far from the surface. Germans voted for Hitler primarily because of his promises to revive the economy (by unspecified means), to restore German greatness and overturn the Treaty of Versailles and to save Germany from communism. On 24 April 1932, the Free State of Prussia elections to the Landtag resulted in 36% of the votes and 162 seats for the NSDAP.\nOn 20 July 1932, the Prussian government was ousted by a coup, the ; a few days later at the July 1932 \"Reichstag\" election the Nazis made another leap forward, polling 37% and becoming the largest party in parliament by a wide margin. Furthermore, the Nazis and the Communists between them won 52% of the vote and a majority of seats. Since both parties opposed the established political system and neither would join or support any ministry, this made the formation of a majority government impossible. The result was weak ministries governing by decree. Under Comintern directives, the Communists maintained their policy of treating the Social Democrats as the main enemy, calling them \"social fascists\", thereby splintering opposition to the Nazis. Later, both the Social Democrats and the Communists accused each other of having facilitated Hitler's rise to power by their unwillingness to compromise.\nChancellor Franz von Papen called another election in November, hoping to find a way out of this impasse. The electoral result was the same, with the Nazis and the Communists winning 50% of the vote between them and more than half the seats, rendering this no more workable than its predecessor. However, support for the Nazis had fallen to 33.1%, suggesting that the Nazi surge had passed its peak\u2014possibly because the worst of the Depression had passed, possibly because some middle-class voters had supported Hitler in July as a protest, but had now drawn back from the prospect of actually putting him into power. The Nazis interpreted the result as a warning that they must seize power before their moment passed. Had the other parties united, this could have been prevented, but their shortsightedness made a united front impossible. Papen, his successor Kurt von Schleicher and the nationalist press magnate Alfred Hugenberg spent December and January in political intrigues that eventually persuaded President Hindenburg that it was safe to appoint Hitler as Reich Chancellor, at the head of a cabinet including only a minority of Nazi ministers\u2014which he did on 30 January 1933.\nAscension and consolidation.\nIn \"Mein Kampf\", Hitler directly attacked both left-wing and right-wing politics in Germany. However, a majority of scholars identify Nazism in practice as being a far-right form of politics. When asked in an interview in 1934 whether the Nazis were \"bourgeois right-wing\" as alleged by their opponents, Hitler responded that Nazism was not exclusively for any class and indicated that it favoured neither the left nor the right, but preserved \"pure\" elements from both \"camps\" by stating: \"From the camp of bourgeois tradition, it takes national resolve, and from the materialism of the Marxist dogma, living, creative Socialism\".\nThe votes that the Nazis received in the 1932 elections established the Nazi Party as the largest parliamentary faction of the Weimar Republic government. Hitler was appointed as Chancellor of Germany on 30 January 1933.\nThe \"Reichstag\" fire on 27 February 1933 gave Hitler a pretext for suppressing his political opponents. The following day he persuaded the Reich's President Paul von Hindenburg to issue the \"Reichstag\" Fire Decree, which suspended most civil liberties. The NSDAP won the parliamentary election on 5 March 1933 with 44% of votes, but failed to win an absolute majority. After the election, hundreds of thousands of new members joined the party for opportunistic reasons, most of them civil servants and white-collar workers. They were nicknamed the \"casualties of March\" () or \"March violets\" (). To protect the party from too many non-ideological turncoats who were viewed by the so-called \"old fighters\" with some mistrust, the party issued a freeze on admissions that remained in force from May 1933 to 1937.\nOn 23 March, the parliament passed the Enabling Act of 1933, which gave the cabinet the right to enact laws without the consent of parliament. In effect, this gave Hitler dictatorial powers. Now possessing virtually absolute power, the Nazis established totalitarian control as they abolished labour unions and other political parties and imprisoned their political opponents, first at , improvised camps, then in concentration camps. Nazi Germany had been established, yet the remained impartial. Nazi power over Germany remained virtual, not absolute.\nAfter taking power: intertwining of party and state.\nThe Nazis embarked on a campaign of (coordination) to exert their control over all aspects of German government and society. During June and July 1933, all competing parties were either outlawed or dissolved themselves and subsequently the Law Against the Formation of Parties of 14 July 1933 legally established the Nazi Party's monopoly. On 1 December 1933, the Law to Secure the Unity of Party and State entered into force, which was the base for a progressive intertwining of party structures and state apparatus. By this law, the SA\u2014actually a party division\u2014was given quasi-governmental authority and their \"Stabschef\" became a cabinet minister without portfolio. By virtue of the 30 January 1934 Law on the Reconstruction of the Reich, the (states) lost their sovereignty and were demoted to administrative divisions of the government. Effectively, they lost most of their power to the that were originally just regional divisions of the party, but took over most competencies of the state administration in their respective sectors.\nDuring the R\u00f6hm Purge of 30 June to 2 July 1934 (also known as the \"Night of the Long Knives\"), Hitler disempowered the SA's leadership\u2014most of whom belonged to the Strasserist (national revolutionary) faction within the NSDAP\u2014and ordered them killed. He accused them of having conspired to stage a \"coup d'\u00e9tat\", but it is believed that this was only a pretense to justify the suppression of any intraparty opposition. The purge was executed by the SS, assisted by the Gestapo and Reichswehr units. Aside from Strasserist Nazis, they also murdered anti-Nazi conservative figures like former chancellor von Schleicher. After this, the SA continued to exist but lost much of its importance, while the role of the SS grew significantly. Formerly only a sub-organisation of the SA, it was made into a separate organisation of the NSDAP in July 1934.\nUpon the death of President Hindenburg on 2 August 1934, Hitler merged the offices of party leader, head of state and chief of government in one, taking the title of by passage of the Law Concerning the Head of State of the German Reich. The Chancellery of the F\u00fchrer, officially an organisation of the Nazi Party, took over the functions of the Office of the President (a government agency), blurring the distinction between structures of party and state even further. The SS increasingly exerted police functions, a development which was formally documented by the merger of the offices of and Chief of the German Police on 17 June 1936, as the position was held by Heinrich Himmler who derived his authority directly from Hitler. The (SD, formally the \"Security Service of the Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS\") that had been created in 1931 as an intraparty intelligence became the \"de facto\" intelligence agency of Nazi Germany. It was put under the Reich Security Main Office (RSHA) in 1939, which then coordinated SD, Gestapo and criminal police, therefore functioning as a hybrid organisation of state and party structures.\nDefeat and abolition.\nOfficially, Nazi Germany lasted only 12 years. The Instrument of Surrender was signed by representatives of the German High Command at Berlin, on 8 May 1945, when the war ended in Europe. The party was formally abolished on 10 October 1945 by the Allied Control Council, followed by the process of denazification along with trials of major war criminals before the International Military Tribunal (IMT) in Nuremberg. Part of the Potsdam Agreement called for the destruction of the Nazi Party alongside the requirement for the reconstruction of the German political life. In addition, the Control Council Law no. 2 Providing for the Termination and Liquidation of the Nazi Organization specified the abolition of 52 other Nazi affiliated and supervised organisations and outlawed their activities. The denazification was carried out in Germany and continued until the onset of the Cold War.\nBetween 1939 and 1945, the Nazi Party led regime, assisted by collaborationist governments and recruits from occupied countries, was responsible for the deaths of at least twenty million people, including 5.5 to 6\u00a0million Jews (representing two-thirds of the Jewish population of Europe), and between 200,000 and 1,500,000 Romani people. The estimated total number includes the killing of nearly two million non-Jewish Poles, over three million Soviet prisoners of war, communists, and other political opponents, homosexuals, the physically and mentally disabled.\nPolitical programme.\nThe National Socialist Programme was a formulation of the policies of the party. It contained 25 points and is therefore also known as the \"25-point plan\" or \"25-point programme\". It was the official party programme, with minor changes, from its proclamation as such by Hitler in 1920, when the party was still the German Workers' Party, until its dissolution.\nParty composition.\nCommand structure.\nTop leadership.\nAt the top of the Nazi Party was the party chairman (\"\"), who held absolute power and full command over the party. All other party offices were subordinate to his position and had to depend on his instructions. In 1934, Hitler founded a separate body for the chairman, Chancellery of the F\u00fchrer, with its own sub-units.\nBelow the F\u00fchrer's chancellery was first the \"Staff of the Deputy F\u00fchrer\", headed by Rudolf Hess from 21 April 1933 to 10 May 1941; and then the \"Party Chancellery\" (), headed by Martin Bormann.\nFollowing Hitler's suicide on 30 April 1945, Bormann would be named as Party Minister, which gave him the top position in the Nazi Party itself; unlike Hitler, however, Bormann would not have a leadership role over the government of Nazi Germany. Bormann, whose fate would remain unknown for several decades, would soon afterwards commit suicide as well on 2 May 1945 while trying to flee Berlin around the time Soviet Union forces captured the city. His remains were first identified in 1972, then again in 1998 through DNA testing.\n\"Reichsleiter\".\nDirectly subjected to the F\u00fchrer were the (\"Reich Leader(s)\"\u2014the singular and plural forms are identical in German), whose number was gradually increased to eighteen. They held power and influence comparable to the Reich Ministers' in Hitler's Cabinet. The eighteen formed the \"Reich Leadership of the Nazi Party\" (), which was established at the so-called Brown House in Munich. Unlike a , a did not have individual geographic areas under their command, but were responsible for specific spheres of interest.\nNazi Party offices.\nThe Nazi Party had a number of party offices dealing with various political and other matters. These included:\nParamilitary groups.\nIn addition to the Nazi Party proper, several paramilitary groups existed which \"supported\" Nazi aims. All members of these paramilitary organisations were required to become regular Nazi Party members first and could then enlist in the group of their choice. An exception was the Waffen-SS, considered the military arm of the SS and Nazi Party, which during the Second World War allowed members to enlist without joining the Nazi Party. Foreign volunteers of the Waffen-SS were also not required to be members of the Nazi Party, although many joined local nationalist groups from their own countries with the same aims. Police officers, including members of the Gestapo, frequently held SS rank for administrative reasons (known as \"rank parity\") and were likewise not required to be members of the Nazi Party.\nA vast system of Nazi Party paramilitary ranks developed for each of the various paramilitary groups. This was part of the process of with the paramilitary and auxiliary groups swallowing existing associations and federations after the Party was flooded by millions of membership applications.\nThe major Nazi Party paramilitary groups were as follows:\nThe Hitler Youth was a paramilitary group divided into an adult leadership corps and a general membership open to boys aged fourteen to eighteen. The League of German Girls was the equivalent group for girls.\nAffiliated organisations.\nCertain nominally independent organisations had their own legal representation and own property, but were supported by the Nazi Party. Many of these associated organisations were labour unions of various professions. Some were older organisations that were Nazified according to the policy after the 1933 takeover.\nThe employees of large businesses with international operations such as Deutsche Bank, Dresdner Bank, and Commerzbank were mostly party members. All German businesses abroad were also required to have their own Nazi Party liaison men, which enabled the party leadership to obtain updated and excellent intelligence on the actions of the global corporate elites.\nRegional administration.\nFor the purpose of centralisation in the process, a rigidly hierarchal structure was established in the Nazi Party, which it later carried through in the whole of Germany in order to consolidate total power under the person of Hitler (). It was regionally sub-divided into a number of (singular: ) headed by a , who received their orders directly from Hitler. The name (originally a term for sub-regions of the Holy Roman Empire headed by a ) for these new provincial structures was deliberately chosen because of its mediaeval connotations. The term is approximately equivalent to the English .\nWhile the Nazis maintained the nominal existence of state and regional governments in Germany itself, this policy was not extended to territories acquired after 1937. Even in German-speaking areas such as Austria, state and regional governments were formally disbanded as opposed to just being dis-empowered.\nAfter the a new type of administrative unit was introduced called a . In these territories the also held the position of (Reich Governor) thereby formally combining the spheres of both party and state offices. The establishment of this type of district was subsequently carried out for any further territorial annexations of Germany both before and during World War II. Even the former territories of Prussia were never formally re-integrated into what was then Germany's largest state after being re-taken in the 1939 Polish campaign.\nThe and (state or province) were further sub-divided into (counties) headed by a , which were in turn sub-divided into (cells) and (blocks), headed by a and respectively.\nA reorganisation of the \"Gaue\" was enacted on 1 October 1928. The given numbers were the official ordering numbers. The statistics are from 1941, for which the \"Gau\" organisation of that moment in time forms the basis. Their size and populations are not exact; for instance, according to the official party statistics the \"Gau\" Kurmark/Mark Brandenburg was the largest in the German Reich. By 1941, there were 42 territorial \"Gaue\" for Greater Germany. Of these, 10 were designated as Reichsgaue: 7 of them for Austria, one for the Sudetenland (annexed from Czechoslovakia) and two for the areas annexed from Poland and the Free City of Danzig after the joint invasion of Poland by Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union in 1939 at the onset of World War II. Getting the leadership of the individual \"Gaue\" to co-operate with one another proved difficult at times since there was constant administrative and financial jockeying for control going on between them.\nThe first table below describes the organizational structure for the \"Gaue\" that existed before their dissolution in 1945. Information on former \"Gaue\" (that were either renamed, or dissolved by being divided or merged with other \"Gaue\") is provided in the second table.\nNazi Party \"Gaue\".\nLater Gaue:\n* Flanders, existed from 15 December 1944 (\"Gauleiter\" in German exile: Jef van de Wiele)\n* Wallonia, existed from 8 December 1944 (\"Gauleiter\" in German exile: L\u00e9on Degrelle)\n\"Gaue\" dissolved before 1945.\nThe numbering is not based on any official former ranking, but merely listed alphabetically. that were simply renamed without territorial changes bear the designation RN in the column \"later became.\" that were divided into more than one bear the designation D in the column \"later became.\" that were merged with other (or occupied territory) bear the designation M in the column \"together with.\"\nAssociated organisations abroad.\n\"Gaue\" in Switzerland.\nThe irregular Swiss branch of the Nazi Party also established a number of Party in that country, most of them named after their regional capitals. These included , , , and . The (East Switzerland) combined the territories of three cantons: St. Gallen, Thurgau and Appenzell.\nMembership.\nGeneral membership.\nThe general membership of the Nazi Party mainly consisted of the urban and rural lower middle classes. 7% belonged to the upper class, another 7% were peasants, 35% were industrial workers and 51% were what can be described as middle class. In early 1933, just before Hitler's appointment to the chancellorship, the party showed an under-representation of \"workers\", who made up 30% of the membership but 46% of German society. Conversely, white-collar employees (19% of members and 12% of Germans), the self-employed (20% of members and 10% of Germans) and civil servants (15% of members and 5% of the German population) had joined in proportions greater than their share of the general population. These members were affiliated with local branches of the party, of which there were 1,378 throughout the country in 1928. In 1932, the number had risen to 11,845, reflecting the party's growth in this period.\nWhen it came to power in 1933, the Nazi Party had over 2 million members. In 1939, the membership total rose to 5.3 million with 81% being male and 19% being female. It continued to attract many more and by 1945 the party reached its peak of 8 million with 63% being male and 37% being female (about 10% of the German population of 80 million).\nMilitary membership.\nNazi members with military ambitions were encouraged to join the Waffen-SS, but a great number enlisted in the and even more were drafted for service after World War II began. Early regulations required that all members be non-political and any Nazi member joining in the 1930s was required to resign from the Nazi Party.\nHowever, this regulation was soon waived and full Nazi Party members served in the in particular after the outbreak of World War II. The Reserves also saw a high number of senior Nazis enlisting, with Reinhard Heydrich and Fritz Todt joining the , as well as Karl Hanke who served in the army.\nThe British historian Richard J. Evans wrote that junior officers in the army were inclined to be especially zealous National Socialists with a third of them having joined the Nazi Party by 1941. Reinforcing the work of the junior leaders were the National Socialist Leadership Guidance Officers, which were created with the purpose of indoctrinating the troops for the \"war of extermination\" against Soviet Russia. Among higher-ranking officers, 29% were NSDAP members by 1941.\nStudent membership.\nIn 1926, the party formed a special division to engage the student population, known as the National Socialist German Students' League (NSDStB). A group for university lecturers, the National Socialist German University Lecturers' League (NSDDB), also existed until July 1944.\nWomen membership.\nThe National Socialist Women's League was the women's organization of the party and by 1938 it had approximately 2 million members.\nMembership outside Germany.\nParty members who lived outside Germany were pooled into the (NSDAP/AO, \"Foreign Organization\"). The organisation was limited only to so-called \"Imperial Germans\" (citizens of the German Empire); and \"Ethnic Germans\" (), who did not hold German citizenship were not permitted to join.\nUnder Bene\u0161 decree No. 16/1945 Coll., in case of citizens of Czechoslovakia membership of the Nazi Party was punishable by between five and twenty years of imprisonment.\n\"Deutsche Gemeinschaft\".\n was a branch of the Nazi Party founded in 1919, created for Germans with status.

{"id": "21742", "revid": "35119144", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21742", "title": "New Age", "text": "Range of new religious beliefs and practices\nNew Age is a range of spiritual or religious practices and beliefs that rapidly grew in Western society during the early 1970s. Its highly eclectic and unsystematic structure makes a precise definition difficult. Although many scholars consider it a religious movement, its adherents typically see it as spiritual or as a unification of mind, body, and spirit, and rarely use the term \"New Age\" themselves. Scholars often call it the New Age movement, although others contest this term and suggest it is better seen as a \"milieu\" or \"zeitgeist\".\nAs a form of Western esotericism, the New Age drew heavily upon esoteric traditions such as the occultism of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, including the work of Emanuel Swedenborg and Franz Mesmer, as well as Spiritualism, New Thought, and Theosophy. More immediately, it arose from mid-20th-century influences such as the UFO religions of the 1950s, the counterculture of the 1960s, and the Human Potential Movement. Its exact origins remain contested, but it became a major movement in the 1970s, at which time it was centered largely in the United Kingdom. It expanded widely in the 1980s and 1990s, in particular in the United States. By the start of the 21st century, the term \"New Age\" was increasingly rejected within this milieu, with some scholars arguing that the New Age phenomenon had ended.\nDespite its eclectic nature, the New Age has several main currents. Theologically, the New Age typically accepts a holistic form of divinity that pervades the universe, including human beings themselves, leading to a strong emphasis on the spiritual authority of the self. This is accompanied by a common belief in a variety of semi-divine non-human entities such as angels, with whom humans can communicate, particularly by channeling through a human intermediary. Typically viewing history as divided into spiritual ages, a common New Age belief posits a forgotten age of great technological advancement and spiritual wisdom that declined into periods of increasing violence and spiritual degeneracy, which will now be remedied by the emergence of an Age of Aquarius, from which the milieu gets its name. There is also a strong focus on healing, particularly using forms of alternative medicine, and an emphasis on unifying science with spirituality.\nThe dedication of New Agers varied considerably, from those who adopted a number of New Age ideas and practices to those who fully embraced and dedicated their lives to it. The New Age has generated criticism from Christians as well as modern Pagan and Indigenous communities. From the 1990s onward, the New Age became the subject of research by academic scholars of religious studies.\nDefinitions.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nOne of the few things on which all scholars agree concerning New Age is that it is difficult to define. Often, the definition given actually reflects the background of the scholar giving the definition. Thus, the New Ager views New Age as a revolutionary period of history dictated by the stars; the Christian apologist has often defined new age as a cult; the historian of ideas understands it as a manifestation of the perennial tradition; the philosopher sees New Age as a monistic or holistic worldview; the sociologist describes New Age as a new religious movement (NRM); while the psychologist describes it as a form of narcissism.\n\u2014 Scholar of religion Daren Kemp, 2004\nThe New Age phenomenon has proved difficult to define, with much scholarly disagreement as to its scope. The scholars Steven J. Sutcliffe and Ingvild S\u00e6lid Gilhus have even suggested that it remains \"among the most disputed of categories in the study of religion\".\nThe scholar of religion Paul Heelas characterised the New Age as \"an eclectic hotch-potch of beliefs, practices, and ways of life\" that can be identified as a singular phenomenon through their use of \"the same (or very similar) \"lingua franca\" to do with the human (and planetary) condition and how it can be transformed.\" Similarly, the historian of religion Olav Hammer termed it \"a common denominator for a variety of quite divergent contemporary popular practices and beliefs\" that have emerged since the late 1970s and are \"largely united by historical links, a shared discourse and an \"air de famille\"\". According to Hammer, this New Age was a \"fluid and fuzzy cultic milieu\". The sociologist of religion Michael York described the New Age as \"an umbrella term that includes a great variety of groups and identities\" that are united by their \"expectation of a major and universal change being primarily founded on the individual and collective development of human potential.\"\nThe scholar of religion Wouter Hanegraaff adopted a different approach by asserting that \"New Age\" was \"a \"label\" attached indiscriminately to whatever seems to fit it\" and that as a result it \"means very different things to different people\". He thus argued against the idea that the New Age could be considered \"a unified ideology or \"Weltanschauung\"\", although he believed that it could be considered a \"more or less unified 'movement'.\" Other scholars have suggested that the New Age is too diverse to be a singular \"movement\". The scholar of religion George D. Chryssides called it \"a counter-cultural \"Zeitgeist\"\", while the sociologist of religion Steven Bruce suggested that New Age was a milieu; Heelas and scholar of religion Linda Woodhead called it the \"holistic milieu\".\nThere is no central authority within the New Age phenomenon that can determine what counts as New Age and what does not. Many of those groups and individuals who could analytically be categorised as part of the New Age reject the term \"New Age\" in reference to themselves. Some even express active hostility to the term. Rather than terming themselves \"New Agers\", those involved in this milieu commonly describe themselves as spiritual \"seekers\", and some self-identify as a member of a different religious group, such as Christianity, Judaism, or Buddhism. In 2003 Sutcliffe observed that the use of the term \"New Age\" was \"optional, episodic and declining overall\", adding that among the very few individuals who did use it, they usually did so with qualification, for instance by placing it in quotation marks. Other academics, such as Sara MacKian, have argued that the sheer diversity of the New Age renders the term too problematic for scholars to use. MacKian proposed \"everyday spirituality\" as an alternate term.\nWhile acknowledging that \"New Age\" was a problematic term, the scholar of religion James R. Lewis stated that it remained a useful etic category for scholars to use because \"There exists no comparable term which covers all aspects of the movement.\" Similarly, Chryssides argued that the fact that \"New Age\" is a \"theoretical concept\" does not \"undermine its usefulness or employability\"; he drew comparisons with \"Hinduism\", a similar \"Western etic piece of vocabulary\" that scholars of religion used despite its problems.\nReligion, spirituality, and esotericism.\nIn discussing the New Age, academics have varyingly referred to \"New Age spirituality\" and \"New Age religion\". Those involved in the New Age rarely consider it to be \"religion\"\u2014negatively associating that term solely with organized religion\u2014and instead describe their practices as \"spirituality\". Religious studies scholars, however, have repeatedly referred to the New Age milieu as a \"religion\". York described the New Age as a new religious movement (NRM). Conversely, both Heelas and Sutcliffe rejected this categorisation; Heelas believed that while elements of the New Age represented NRMs, this did not apply to every New Age group. Similarly, Chryssides stated that the New Age could not be seen as \"a religion\" in itself.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe New Age movement is the cultic milieu having become conscious of itself, in the later 1970s, as constituting a more or less unified \"movement\". All manifestations of this movement are characterized by a popular western culture criticism expressed in terms of a secularized esotericism.\n\u2014 Scholar of esotericism Wouter Hanegraaff, 1996.\nThe New Age is also a form of Western esotericism. Hanegraaff regarded the New Age as a form of \"popular culture criticism\", in that it represented a reaction against the dominant Western values of Judeo-Christian religion and rationalism, adding that \"New Age religion formulates such criticism not at random, but falls back on\" the ideas of earlier Western esoteric groups.\nThe New Age has also been identified by various scholars of religion as part of the cultic milieu. This concept, developed by the sociologist Colin Campbell, refers to a social network of marginalized ideas. Through their shared marginalization within a given society, these disparate ideas interact and create new syntheses.\nHammer identified much of the New Age as corresponding to the concept of \"folk religions\" in that it seeks to deal with existential questions regarding subjects like death and disease in \"an unsystematic fashion, often through a process of bricolage from already available narratives and rituals\". York also heuristically divides the New Age into three broad trends. The first, the \"social camp\", represents groups that primarily seek to bring about social change, while the second, the \"occult camp\", instead focuses on contact with spirit entities and channeling. York's third group, the \"spiritual camp\", represents a middle ground between these two camps that focuses largely on individual development.\nTerminology.\nThe term \"new age\", along with related terms like \"new era\" and \"new world\", long predate the emergence of the New Age movement, and have widely been used to assert that a better way of life for humanity is dawning. It occurs commonly, for instance, in political contexts; the Great Seal of the United States, designed in 1782, proclaims a \"new order of ages\", while in the 1980s the Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev proclaimed that \"all mankind is entering a new age\". The term has also appeared within Western esoteric schools of thought, having a scattered use from the mid-nineteenth century onward. In 1864 the American Swedenborgian Warren Felt Evans published \"The New Age and its Message\" about the teachings of the unity/correspondence of natural and spiritual worlds of the Swedish mystic Emanuel Swedenborg, while in 1907 Alfred Orage and Holbrook Jackson began editing a weekly journal of Christian liberalism and socialism titled \"The New Age\". The concept of a coming \"new age\" that would be inaugurated by the return to Earth of Jesus Christ was a theme in the poetry of Wellesley Tudor Pole (1884\u20131968) and of Johanna Brandt (1876\u20131964), and then also appeared in the work of the British-born American Theosophist Alice Bailey (1880\u20131949), featuring in titles such as \"Discipleship in the New Age\" (1944) and \"Education in the New Age\" (1954).\nBetween the 1930s and 1960s, a small number of groups and individuals became preoccupied with the concept of a coming \"New Age\" and used the term accordingly. The term had thus become a recurring motif in the esoteric spirituality milieu. Sutcliffe, therefore, expressed the view that while the term \"New Age\" had originally been an \"apocalyptic emblem\", it would only be later that it became \"a tag or codeword for a 'spiritual' idiom\".\nHistory.\nAntecedents in occult and theosophy.\nAccording to scholar Nevill Drury, the New Age has a \"tangible history\", although Hanegraaff expressed the view that most New Agers were \"surprisingly ignorant about the actual historical roots of their beliefs\". Similarly, Hammer thought that \"source amnesia\" was a \"building block of a New Age worldview\", with New Agers typically adopting ideas with no awareness of where those ideas originated.\nAs a form of Western esotericism, the New Age has antecedents that stretch back to southern Europe in Late Antiquity. Following the Age of Enlightenment in 18th-century Europe, new esoteric ideas developed in response to the development of scientific rationality. Scholars call this new esoteric trend \"occultism\", and this occultism was a key factor in the development of the worldview from which the New Age emerged.\nOne of the earliest influences on the New Age was the Swedish 18th-century Christian mystic Emanuel Swedenborg, who professed the ability to communicate with angels, demons, and spirits. Swedenborg's attempt to unite science and religion and his prediction of a coming era in particular have been cited as ways that he prefigured the New Age. Another early influence was the late 18th and early 19th century German physician and hypnotist Franz Mesmer, who wrote about the existence of a force known as \"animal magnetism\" running through the human body. The establishment of Spiritualism, an occult religion influenced by both Swedenborgianism and Mesmerism, in the U.S. during the 1840s has also been identified as a precursor to the New Age, in particular through its rejection of established Christianity, representing itself as a scientific approach to religion, and its emphasis on channeling spirit entities.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nMost of the beliefs which characterise the New Age were already present by the end of the 19th century, even to such an extent that one may legitimately wonder whether the New Age brings anything new at all.\n\u2014 Historian of religion Wouter Hanegraaff, 1996. \nA further major influence on the New Age was the Theosophical Society, an occult group co-founded by the Russian Helena Blavatsky in the late 19th century. In her books \"Isis Unveiled\" (1877) and \"The Secret Doctrine\" (1888), Blavatsky wrote that her Society was conveying the essence of all world religions, and it thus emphasized a focus on comparative religion. Serving as a partial bridge between Theosophical ideas and those of the New Age was the American esotericist Edgar Cayce, who founded the Association for Research and Enlightenment. Another partial bridge was the Danish mystic Martinus who is popular in Scandinavia.\nAnother influence was New Thought, which developed in late nineteenth-century New England as a Christian-oriented healing movement before spreading throughout the United States. Another influence was the psychologist Carl Jung.\nDrury also identified as an important influence upon the New Age the Indian Swami Vivekananda, an adherent of the philosophy of Vedanta who first brought Hinduism to the West in the late 19th century.\nHanegraaff believed that the New Age's direct antecedents could be found in the UFO religions of the 1950s, which he termed a \"proto-New Age movement\". Many of these new religious movements had strong apocalyptic beliefs regarding a coming new age, which they typically asserted would be brought about by contact with extraterrestrials. Examples of such groups included the Aetherius Society, founded in the UK in 1955, and the Heralds of the New Age, established in New Zealand in 1956.\n1960s.\nFrom a historical perspective, the New Age phenomenon is most associated with the counterculture of the 1960s. According to author Andrew Grant Jackson, George Harrison's adoption of Hindu philosophy and Indian instrumentation in his songs with the Beatles in the mid-1960s, together with the band's highly publicised study of Transcendental Meditation, \"truly kick-started\" the Human Potential Movement that subsequently became New Age. Although not common throughout the counterculture, usage of the terms \"New Age\" and \"Age of Aquarius\"\u2014used in reference to a coming era\u2014were found within it, for instance appearing on adverts for the Woodstock festival of 1969, and in the lyrics of \"Aquarius\", the opening song of the 1967 musical \"Hair: The American Tribal Love-Rock Musical\".\nThis decade also witnessed the emergence of a variety of new religious movements and newly established religions in the United States, creating a spiritual milieu from which the New Age drew upon; these included the San Francisco Zen Center, Transcendental Meditation, Soka Gakkai, the Inner Peace Movement, the Church of All Worlds, and the Church of Satan. Although there had been an established interest in Asian religious ideas in the U.S. from at least the eighteenth-century, many of these new developments were variants of Hinduism, Buddhism, and Sufism, which had been imported to the West from Asia following the U.S. government's decision to rescind the Asian Exclusion Act in 1965. In 1962 the Esalen Institute was established in Big Sur, California. Esalen and similar personal growth centers had developed links to humanistic psychology, and from this, the human potential movement emerged and strongly influenced the New Age.\nIn Britain, a number of small religious groups that came to be identified as the \"light\" movement had begun declaring the existence of a coming new age, influenced strongly by the Theosophical ideas of Blavatsky and Bailey. The most prominent of these groups was the Findhorn Foundation, which founded the Findhorn Ecovillage in the Scottish area of Findhorn, Moray in 1962. Although its founders were from an older generation, Findhorn attracted increasing numbers of countercultural baby boomers during the 1960s, to the extent that its population had grown sixfold to c. 120 residents by 1972. In October 1965, the co-founder of Findhorn Foundation, Peter Caddy, a former member of the occult Rosicrucian Order Crotona Fellowship, attended a meeting of various figures within Britain's esoteric milieu; advertised as \"The Significance of the Group in the New Age\", it was held at Attingham Park over the course of a weekend.\nAll of these groups created the backdrop from which the New Age movement emerged. As James R. Lewis and J. Gordon Melton point out, the New Age phenomenon represents \"a synthesis of many different preexisting movements and strands of thought\". Nevertheless, York asserted that while the New Age bore many similarities with both earlier forms of Western esotericism and Asian religion, it remained \"distinct from its predecessors in its own self-consciousness as a new way of thinking\".\nEmergence and development: c. 1970\u20132000.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe late 1950s saw the first stirrings within the cultic milieu of a belief in a coming new age. A variety of small movements arose, revolving around revealed messages from beings in space and presenting a synthesis of post-Theosophical and other esoteric doctrines. These movements might have remained marginal, had it not been for the explosion of the counterculture in the 1960s and early 1970s. Various historical threads ... began to converge: nineteenth century doctrinal elements such as Theosophy and post-Theosophical esotericism as well as harmonious or positive thinking were now eclectically combined with ... religious psychologies: transpersonal psychology, Jungianism and a variety of Eastern teachings. It became perfectly feasible for the same individuals to consult the I Ching, practice Jungian astrology, read Abraham Maslow's writings on peak experiences, etc. The reason for the ready incorporation of such disparate sources was a similar goal of exploring an individualized and largely non-Christian religiosity.\n\u2014 Scholar of esotericism Olav Hammer, 2001.\nBy the early 1970s, use of the term \"New Age\" was increasingly common within the cultic milieu. This was because\u2014according to Sutcliffe\u2014the \"emblem\" of the \"New Age\" had been passed from the \"subcultural pioneers\" in groups like Findhorn to the wider array of \"countercultural baby boomers\" between c.\u20091967 and 1974. He noted that as this happened, the meaning of the term \"New Age\" changed; whereas it had once referred specifically to a coming era, at this point it came to be used in a wider sense to refer to a variety of spiritual activities and practices. In the latter part of the 1970s, the New Age expanded to cover a wide variety of alternative spiritual and religious beliefs and practices, not all of which explicitly held to the belief in the Age of Aquarius, but were nevertheless widely recognized as broadly similar in their search for \"alternatives\" to mainstream society. In doing so, the \"New Age\" became a banner under which to bring together the wider \"cultic milieu\" of American society.\nThe counterculture of the 1960s had rapidly declined by the start of the 1970s, in large part due to the collapse of the commune movement, but it would be many former members of the counter-culture and hippie subculture who subsequently became early adherents of the New Age movement.\nThe exact origins of the New Age movement remain an issue of debate; Melton asserted that it emerged in the early 1970s, whereas Hanegraaff instead traced its emergence to the latter 1970s, adding that it then entered its full development in the 1980s. This early form of the movement was based largely in Britain and exhibited a strong influence from theosophy and Anthroposophy. Hanegraaff termed this early core of the movement the \"New Age sensu stricto\", or \"New Age in the strict sense\".\nHanegraaff terms the broader development the \"New Age sensu lato\", or \"New Age in the wider sense\". Stores that came to be known as \"New Age shops\" opened up, selling related books, magazines, jewelry, and crystals, and they were typified by the playing of New Age music and the smell of incense.This probably influenced several thousand small metaphysical book- and gift-stores that increasingly defined themselves as \"New Age bookstores\", while New Age titles came to be increasingly available from mainstream bookstores and then websites like Amazon.com.\nNot everyone who came to be associated with the New Age phenomenon openly embraced the term \"New Age\", although it was popularised in books like David Spangler's 1977 work \"Revelation: The Birth of a New Age\" and Mark Satin's 1979 book \"New Age Politics: Healing Self and Society\". Marilyn Ferguson's 1982 book \"The Aquarian Conspiracy\" has also been regarded as a landmark work in the development of the New Age, promoting the idea that a new era was emerging. Other terms that were employed synonymously with \"New Age\" in this milieu included \"Green\", \"Holistic\", \"Alternative\", and \"Spiritual\".\n1971 witnessed the foundation of est by Werner H. Erhard, a transformational training course that became a part of the early movement. Melton suggested that the 1970s witnessed the growth of a relationship between the New Age movement and the older New Thought movement, as evidenced by the widespread use of Helen Schucman's \"A Course in Miracles\" (1975), New Age music, and crystal healing in New Thought churches. Some figures in the New Thought movement were skeptical, challenging the compatibility of New Age and New Thought perspectives. During these decades, Findhorn had become a site of pilgrimage for many New Agers, and greatly expanded in size as people joined the community, with workshops and conferences being held there that brought together New Age thinkers from across the world.\nSeveral key events occurred, which raised public awareness of the New Age subculture: publication of Linda Goodman's best-selling astrology books \"Sun Signs\" (1968) and \"Love Signs\" (1978); the release of Shirley MacLaine's book \"Out on a Limb\" (1983), later adapted into a television mini-series with the same name (1987); and the \"Harmonic Convergence\" planetary alignment on August 16 and 17, 1987, organized by Jos\u00e9 Arg\u00fcelles in Sedona, Arizona. The Convergence attracted more people to the movement than any other single event. Heelas suggested that the movement was influenced by the \"enterprise culture\" encouraged by the U.S. and U.K. governments during the 1980s onward, with its emphasis on initiative and self-reliance resonating with any New Age ideas.\nChannelers Jane Roberts (Seth Material), Helen Schucman (\"A Course in Miracles\"), J. Z. Knight (Ramtha), Neale Donald Walsch (\"Conversations with God\") contributed to the movement's growth. The first significant exponent of the New Age movement in the U.S. has been cited as Ram Dass. Core works in the propagating of New Age ideas included Jane Roberts's Seth series, published from 1972 onward, Helen Schucman's 1975 publication \"A Course in Miracles\", and James Redfield's 1993 work \"The Celestine Prophecy\". A number of these books became best sellers, such as the Seth book series which quickly sold over a million copies. Supplementing these books were videos, audiotapes, compact discs and websites. The development of the internet in particular further popularized New Age ideas and made them more widely accessible.\nNew Age ideas influenced the development of rave culture in the late 1980s and 1990s. In Britain during the 1980s, the term \"New Age Travellers\" came into use, although York characterised this term as \"a misnomer created by the media\". These New Age Travellers had little to do with the New Age as the term was used more widely, with scholar of religion Daren Kemp observing that \"New Age spirituality is not an essential part of New Age Traveller culture, although there are similarities between the two worldviews\". The term \"New Age\" came to be used increasingly widely by the popular media in the 1990s.\nDecline or transformation: 1990\u2013present.\nBy the late 1980s, some publishers dropped the term \"New Age\" as a marketing device. In 1994, the scholar of religion Gordon J. Melton presented a conference paper in which he argued that, given that he knew of nobody describing their practices as \"New Age\" anymore, the New Age had died. In 2001, Hammer observed that the term \"New Age\" had increasingly been rejected as either pejorative or meaningless by individuals within the Western cultic milieu. He also noted that within this milieu it was not being replaced by any alternative and that as such a sense of collective identity was being lost.\nOther scholars disagreed with Melton's idea; in 2004 Daren Kemp stated that \"New Age is still very much alive\". Hammer himself stated that \"the New Age \"movement\" may be on the wane, but the wider New Age \"religiosity\"... shows no sign of disappearing\". MacKian suggested that the New Age \"movement\" had been replaced by a wider \"New Age sentiment\" which had come to pervade \"the socio-cultural landscape\" of Western countries. Its diffusion into the mainstream may have been influenced by the adoption of New Age concepts by high-profile figures: U.S. First Lady Nancy Reagan consulted an astrologer, British Princess Diana visited spirit mediums, and Norwegian Princess M\u00e4rtha Louise established a school devoted to communicating with angels.\nNew Age shops continued to operate, although many have been remarketed as \"Mind, Body, Spirit\".\nIn 2015, the scholar of religion Hugh Urban argued that New Age spirituality is growing in the United States and can be expected to become more visible: \"According to many recent surveys of religious affiliation, the 'spiritual but not religious' category is one of the fastest-growing trends in American culture, so the New Age attitude of spiritual individualism and eclecticism may well be an increasingly visible one in the decades to come\".\nAustralian scholar Paul J. Farrelly, in his 2017 doctoral dissertation at Australian National University, argued that, while the term New Age may become less popular in the West, it is actually booming in Taiwan, where it is regarded as something comparatively new and is being exported from Taiwan to the Mainland China, where it is more or less tolerated by the authorities.\nBeliefs and practices.\nEclecticism and self-spirituality.\nThe New Age places strong emphasis on the idea that the individual and their own experiences are the primary source of authority on spiritual matters. It exhibits what Heelas termed \"unmediated individualism\", and reflects a world-view that is \"radically democratic\". It places an emphasis on the freedom and autonomy of the individual. This emphasis has led to ethical disagreements; some New Agers believe helping others is beneficial, although another view is that doing so encourages dependency and conflicts with a reliance on the self. Nevertheless, within the New Age, there are differences in the role accorded to voices of authority outside of the self. Hammer stated that \"a belief in the existence of a core or true Self\" is a \"recurring theme\" in New Age texts. The concept of \"personal growth\" is also greatly emphasised among New Agers, while Heelas noted that \"for participants spirituality \"is\" life-itself\".\nNew Age religiosity is typified by its eclecticism. Generally believing that there is no one true way to pursue spirituality, New Agers develop their own worldview \"by combining bits and pieces to form their own individual mix\", seeking what Drury called \"a spirituality without borders or confining dogmas\". The anthropologist David J. Hess noted that in his experience, a common attitude among New Agers was that \"any alternative spiritual path is good because it is spiritual and alternative\". This approach that has generated a common jibe that New Age represents \"supermarket spirituality\". York suggested that this eclecticism stemmed from the New Age's origins within late modern capitalism, with New Agers subscribing to a belief in a free market of spiritual ideas as a parallel to a free market in economics.\nAs part of its eclecticism, the New Age draws ideas from many different cultural and spiritual traditions from across the world, often legitimising this approach by reference to \"a very vague claim\" about underlying global unity. Certain societies are more usually chosen over others; examples include the ancient Celts, ancient Egyptians, the Essenes, Atlanteans, and ancient extraterrestrials. As noted by Hammer: \"to put it bluntly, no significant spokespersons within the New Age community claim to represent ancient Albanian wisdom, simply because beliefs regarding ancient Albanians are not part of our cultural stereotypes\". According to Hess, these ancient or foreign societies represent an exotic \"Other\" for New Agers, who are predominantly white Westerners.\nTheology, cosmogony, and cosmology.\nA belief in divinity is integral to New Age ideas, although understandings of this divinity vary. New Age theology exhibits an inclusive and universalistic approach that accepts all personal perspectives on the divine as equally valid. This intentional vagueness as to the nature of divinity also reflects the New Age idea that divinity cannot be comprehended by the human mind or language. New Age literature nevertheless displays recurring traits in its depiction of the divine: the first is the idea that it is holistic, thus frequently being described with such terms as an \"Ocean of Oneness\", \"Infinite Spirit\", \"Primal Stream\", \"One Essence\", and \"Universal Principle\". A second trait is the characterisation of divinity as \"Mind\", \"Consciousness\", and \"Intelligence\", while a third is the description of divinity as a form of \"energy\". A fourth trait is the characterisation of divinity as a \"life force\", the essence of which is creativity, while a fifth is the concept that divinity consists of love.\nMost New Age groups believe in an Ultimate Source from which all things originate, which is usually conflated with the divine. Various creation myths have been articulated in New Age publications outlining how this Ultimate Source created the universe and everything in it. In contrast, some New Agers emphasize the idea of a universal inter-relatedness that is not always emanating from a single source. The New Age worldview emphasises holism and the idea that everything in existence is intricately connected as part of a single whole, in doing so rejecting both the dualism of the Christian division of matter and spirit and the reductionism of Cartesian science. A number of New Agers have linked this holistic interpretation of the universe to the Gaia hypothesis of James Lovelock. The idea of holistic divinity results in a common New Age belief that humans themselves are divine in essence, a concept described using such terms as \"droplet of divinity\", \"inner Godhead\", and \"divine self\". Influenced by Theosophical and Anthroposophical ideas regarding 'subtle bodies', a common New Age idea holds to the existence of a Higher Self that is a part of the human but connects with the divine essence of the universe, and which can advise the human mind through intuition.\nCosmogonical creation stories are common in New Age sources, with these accounts reflecting the movement's holistic framework by describing an original, primal oneness from which all things in the universe emanated. An additional common theme is that human souls\u2014once living in a spiritual world\u2014then descended into a world of matter.\nThe New Age movement typically views the material universe as a meaningful illusion, which humans should try to use constructively rather than focus on escaping into other spiritual realms. This physical world is hence seen as \"a domain for learning and growth\" after which the human soul might pass on to higher levels of existence. There is thus a widespread belief that reality is engaged in an ongoing process of evolution; rather than Darwinian evolution, this is typically seen as either a teleological evolution which assumes a process headed to a specific goal or an open-ended, creative evolution.\nSpirit and channeling.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIn the flood of channeled material which has been published or delivered to \"live\" audiences in the last two decades, there is much indeed that is trivial, contradictory, and confusing. The authors of much of this material make claims that, while not necessarily untrue or fraudulent, are difficult or impossible for the reader to verify. A number of other channeled documents address issues more immediately relevant to the human condition. The best of these writings are not only coherent and plausible, but eloquently persuasive and sometimes disarmingly moving.\n\u2014 Academic Suzanne Riordan, 1992.\nA \"conduit\", in esoterism, and spiritual discourse, is a specific object, person, location, or process (such as engaging in a s\u00e9ance or entering a trance, or using psychedelic medicines) which allows a person to connect or communicate with a spiritual realm, metaphysical energy, or spiritual entity, or vice versa. The use of such a conduit may be entirely metaphoric or symbolic, or it may be earnestly believed to be functional.\nMacKian argued that a central, but often overlooked, element of the phenomenon was an emphasis on \"spirit\", and in particular participants' desire for a relationship with spirit. Many practitioners in her UK-focused study described themselves as \"workers \"for\" spirit\", expressing the desire to help people learn about spirit. They understood various material signs as marking the presence of spirit, for instance, the unexpected appearance of a feather. New Agers often call upon this spirit to assist them in everyday situations, for instance, to ease the traffic flow on their way to work.\nNew Age literature often refers to benevolent non-human spirit-beings who are interested in humanity's spiritual development; these are variously referred to as angels, guardian angels, personal guides, masters, teachers, and contacts. New Age angelology is nevertheless unsystematic, reflecting the idiosyncrasies of individual authors. The figure of Jesus Christ is often mentioned within New Age literature as a mediating principle between divinity and humanity, as well as an exemplar of a spiritually advanced human being.\nAlthough not present in every New Age group, a core belief within the milieu is in channeling. This is the idea that humans beings, sometimes (although not always) in a state of trance, can act \"as a channel of information from sources other than their normal selves\". These sources are varyingly described as being God, gods and goddesses, ascended masters, spirit guides, extraterrestrials, angels, devas, historical figures, the collective unconscious, elementals, or nature spirits. Hanegraaff described channeling as a form of \"articulated revelation\", and identified four forms: trance channeling, automatisms, clairaudient channeling, and open channeling.\nA notable channeler in the early 1900s was Rose Edith Kelly, wife of the English occultist and ceremonial magician Aleister Crowley (1875\u20131947). She allegedly channeled the voice of a non-physical entity named Aiwass during their honeymoon in Cairo, Egypt (1904). Others purport to channel spirits from \"future dimensions\", ascended masters, or, in the case of the trance mediums of the Brahma Kumaris, God. Another channeler in the early 1900s was Edgar Cayce, who said that he was able to channel his higher self while in a trance-like state.\nIn the later half of the 20th century, Western mediumship developed in two different ways. One type involves clairaudience, in which the medium is said to hear spirits and relay what they hear to their clients. The other is a form of channeling in which the channeler seemingly goes into a trance, and purports to leave their body allowing a spirit entity to borrow it and then speak through them. When in a trance the medium appears to enter into a cataleptic state, although modern channelers may not. Some channelers open the eyes when channeling, and remain able to walk and behave normally. The rhythm and the intonation of the voice may also change completely.\nExamples of New Age channeling include Jane Roberts' belief that she was contacted by an entity called Seth, and Helen Schucman's belief that she had channeled Jesus Christ. The academic Suzanne Riordan examined a variety of these New Age channeled messages, noting that they typically \"echoed each other in tone and content\", offering an analysis of the human condition and giving instructions or advice for how humanity can discover its true destiny.\nFor many New Agers, these channeled messages rival the scriptures of the main world religions as sources of spiritual authority, although often New Agers describe historical religious revelations as forms of \"channeling\" as well, thus attempting to legitimate and authenticate their own contemporary practices. Although the concept of channeling from discarnate spirit entities has links to Spiritualism and psychical research, the New Age does not feature Spiritualism's emphasis on proving the existence of life after death, nor psychical research's focus of testing mediums for consistency.\nOther New Age channels include:\nAstrological cycles and the Age of Aquarius.\nNew Age thought typically envisions the world as developing through cosmological cycles that can be identified astrologically. It adopts this concept from Theosophy, although often presents it in a looser and more eclectic way than is found in Theosophical teaching. New Age literature often proposes that humanity once lived in an age of spiritual wisdom. In the writings of New Agers like Edgar Cayce, the ancient period of spiritual wisdom is associated with concepts of supremely-advanced societies living on lost continents such as Atlantis, Lemuria, and Mu, as well as the idea that ancient societies like those of Ancient Egypt were far more technologically advanced than modern scholarship accepts. New Age literature often posits that the ancient period of spiritual wisdom gave way to an age of spiritual decline, sometimes termed the Age of Pisces. Although characterised as being a negative period for humanity, New Age literature views the Age of Pisces as an important learning experience for the species. Hanegraaff stated that New Age perceptions of history were \"extremely sketchy\" in their use of description, reflecting little interest in historiography and conflating history with myth. He also noted that they were highly ethnocentric in placing Western civilization at the centre of historical development.\nA common belief among the New Age is that humanity has entered, or is coming to enter, a new period known as the Age of Aquarius, which Melton has characterised as a \"New Age of love, joy, peace, abundance, and harmony[...] the Golden Age heretofore only dreamed about.\" In accepting this belief in a coming new age, the milieu has been described as \"highly positive, celebratory, [and] utopian\", and has also been cited as an apocalyptic movement. Opinions about the nature of the coming Age of Aquarius differ among New Agers. There are for instance differences in belief about its commencement; New Age author David Spangler wrote that it began in 1967, others placed its beginning with the Harmonic Convergence of 1987, author Jos\u00e9 Arg\u00fcelles predicted its start in 2012, and some believe that it will not begin until several centuries into the third millennium.\nThere are also differences in how this new age is envisioned. Those adhering to what Hanegraaff termed the \"moderate\" perspective believed that it would be marked by an improvement to current society, which affected both New Age concerns\u2014through the convergence of science and mysticism and the global embrace of alternative medicine\u2014to more general concerns, including an end to violence, crime and war, a healthier environment, and international co-operation. Other New Agers adopt a fully utopian vision, believing that the world will be wholly transformed into an \"Age of Light\", with humans evolving into totally spiritual beings and experiencing unlimited love, bliss, and happiness. Rather than conceiving of the Age of Aquarius as an indefinite period, many believe that it would last for around two thousand years before being replaced by a further age.\nThere are various beliefs within the milieu as to how this new age will come about, but most emphasise the idea that it will be established through human agency; others assert that it will be established with the aid of non-human forces such as spirits or extraterrestrials. Ferguson, for instance, said that there was a vanguard of humans known as the \"Aquarian conspiracy\" who were helping to bring the Age of Aquarius forth through their actions. Participants in the New Age typically express the view that their own spiritual actions are helping to bring about the Age of Aquarius, with writers like Ferguson and Arg\u00fcelles presenting themselves as prophets ushering forth this future era.\nHealing and alternative medicine.\nAnother recurring element of New Age is an emphasis on healing and alternative medicine. The general New Age ethos is that health is the natural state for the human being and that illness is a disruption of that natural balance. Hence, New Age therapies seek to heal \"illness\" as a general concept that includes physical, mental, and spiritual aspects; in doing so it critiques mainstream Western medicine for simply attempting to cure disease, and thus has an affinity with most forms of traditional medicine. Its focus of self-spirituality has led to the emphasis of self-healing, although also present are ideas on healing both others and the Earth itself.\nThe healing elements of the movement are difficult to classify given that a variety of terms are used, with some New Age authors using different terms to refer to the same trends, while others use the same term to refer to different things. However, Hanegraaff developed a set of categories into which the forms of New Age healing could be roughly categorised. The first of these was the Human Potential Movement, which argues that contemporary Western society suppresses much human potential, and accordingly professes to offer a path through which individuals can access those parts of themselves that they have alienated and suppressed, thus enabling them to reach their full potential and live a meaningful life. Hanegraaff described transpersonal psychology as the \"theoretical wing\" of this Human Potential Movement; in contrast to other schools of psychological thought, transpersonal psychology takes religious and mystical experiences seriously by exploring the uses of altered states of consciousness. Closely connected to this is the shamanic consciousness current, which argues that the shaman was a specialist in altered states of consciousness and seeks to adopt and imitate traditional shamanic techniques as a form of personal healing and growth.\nHanegraaff identified the second main healing current in the New Age movement as being holistic health. This emerged in the 1970s out of the free clinic movement of the 1960s, and has various connections with the Human Potential Movement. It emphasises the idea that the human individual is a holistic, interdependent relationship between mind, body, and spirit, and that healing is a process in which an individual becomes whole by integrating with the powers of the universe. A very wide array of methods are utilised within the holistic health movement, with some of the most common including acupuncture, reiki, biofeedback, chiropractic, yoga, applied kinesiology, homeopathy, aromatherapy, iridology, massage and other forms of bodywork, meditation and visualisation, nutritional therapy, psychic healing, herbal medicine, healing using crystals, metals, music, chromotherapy, and reincarnation therapy. Although the use of crystal healing has become a visual trope within the New Age, this practice was not common in esotericism prior to their adoption in the New Age milieu.\nThe mainstreaming of the Holistic Health movement in the UK is discussed by Maria Tighe. The inter-relation of holistic health with the New Age movement is illustrated in Jenny Butler's ethnographic description of \"Angel therapy\" in Ireland.\nNew Age science.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe New Age is essentially about the search for spiritual and philosophical perspectives that will help transform humanity and the world. New Agers are willing to absorb wisdom teachings wherever they can find them, whether from an Indian guru, a renegade Christian priest, an itinerant Buddhist monk, an experiential psychotherapist or a Native American shaman. They are eager to explore their own inner potential with a view to becoming part of a broader process of social transformation. Their journey is towards totality of being.\nNevill Drury\nAccording to Drury, the New Age attempts to create \"a worldview that includes both science and spirituality\", while Hess noted how New Agers have \"a penchant for bringing together the technical and the spiritual, the scientific and the religious\".\nAlthough New Agers typically reject rationalism, the scientific method, and the academic establishment, they employ terminology and concepts borrowed from science and particularly from new physics. Moreover, a number of influences on New Age, such as David Bohm and Ilya Prigogine, had backgrounds as professional scientists. Hanegraaff identified \"New Age science\" as a form of \"Naturphilosophie\".\nIn this, the milieu is interested in developing unified world views to discover the nature of the divine and establish a scientific basis for religious belief. Figures in the New Age movement\u2014most notably Fritjof Capra in his \"The Tao of Physics\" (1975) and Gary Zukav in \"The Dancing Wu Li Masters\" (1979)\u2014have drawn parallels between theories in the New Physics and traditional forms of mysticism, thus arguing that ancient religious ideas are now being proven by contemporary science. Many New Agers have adopted James Lovelock's Gaia hypothesis that the Earth acts akin to a single living organism, going further to propound that the Earth has a consciousness and intelligence.\nDespite New Agers' appeals to science, most of the academic and scientific establishments dismiss \"New Age science\" as pseudo-science, or at best existing in part on the fringes of genuine scientific research. This is an attitude also shared by many active in the field of parapsychology. In turn, New Agers often accuse the scientific establishment of pursuing a dogmatic and outmoded approach to scientific enquiry, believing that their own understandings of the universe will replace those of the academic establishment in a paradigm shift.\nEthics and afterlife.\nThere is no ethical cohesion within the New Age phenomenon, although Hanegraaff argued that the central ethical tenet of the New Age is to cultivate one's own divine potential. Given that the movement's holistic interpretation of the universe prohibits a belief in a dualistic good and evil, negative events that happen are interpreted not as the result of evil but as lessons designed to teach an individual and enable them to advance spiritually.\nIt rejects the Christian emphasis on sin and guilt, believing that these generate fear and thus negativity, which in turn hinder spiritual evolution. It also typically criticises the blaming and judging of others for their actions, believing that if an individual adopts these negative attitudes it harms their own spiritual evolution. Instead, the movement emphasizes positive thinking, although beliefs regarding the power behind such thoughts vary within New Age literature. Common New Age examples of how to generate such positive thinking include the repeated recitation of mantras and statements carrying positive messages, and the visualisation of a white light.\nAccording to Hanegraaff, the question of death and afterlife is not a \"pressing problem requiring an answer\" in the New Age. A belief in reincarnation is very common, where it is often viewed as being part of an individual's progressive spiritual evolution toward realisation of their own divinity. In New Age literature, the reality of reincarnation is usually treated as self-evident, with no explanation as to why practitioners embrace this afterlife belief over others, although New Agers endorse it in the belief that it ensures cosmic justice. Many New Agers believe in karma, treating it as a law of cause and effect that assures cosmic balance, although in some cases they stress that it is not a system that enforces punishment for past actions.\nMuch New Age literature on reincarnation says that part of the human soul, that which carries the personality, perishes with the death of the body, while the Higher Self\u2014that which connects with divinity\u2014survives in order to be reborn into another body. It is believed that the Higher Self chooses the body and circumstances into which it will be born, in order to use it as a vessel through which to learn new lessons and thus advance its own spiritual evolution. New Age writers like Shakti Gawain and Louise Hay therefore express the view that humans are responsible for the events that happen to them during their life, an idea that many New Agers regard as empowering. At times, past life regression are employed within the New Age in order to reveal a Higher Soul's previous incarnations, usually with an explicit healing purpose. Some practitioners espouse the idea of a \"soul group\" or \"soul family\", a group of connected souls who reincarnate together as family of friendship units. Rather than reincarnation, another afterlife belief found among New Agers holds that an individual's soul returns to a \"universal energy\" on bodily death.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBy the early twenty-first century... [the New Age phenomenon] has an almost entirely white, middle-class demography largely made up of professional, managerial, arts, and entrepreneurial occupations.\n\u2014 Religious studies scholar Steven J. Sutcliffe.\nIn the mid-1990s, the New Age was found primarily in the United States and Canada, Western Europe, and Australia and New Zealand. The fact that most individuals engaging in New Age activity do not describe themselves as \"New Agers\" renders it difficult to determine the total number of practitioners. Heelas highlighted the range of attempts to establish the number of New Age participants in the U.S. during this period, noting that estimates ranged from 20,000 to 6 million; he believed that the higher ranges of these estimates were greatly inflated by, for instance, an erroneous assumption that all Americans who believed in reincarnation were part of the New Age. He nevertheless suggested that over 10 million people in the U.S. had had some contact with New Age practices or ideas. Between 2000 and 2002, Heelas and Woodhead conducted research into the New Age in the English town of Kendal, Cumbria; they found 600 people actively attended New Age activities on a weekly basis, representing 1.6% of the town's population. From this, they extrapolated that around 900,000 Britons regularly took part in New Age activities. In 2006, Heelas stated that New Age practices had grown to such an extent that they were \"increasingly rivaling the sway of Christianity in Western settings\".\nSociological investigation indicates that certain sectors of society are more likely to engage in New Age practices than others. In the United States, the first people to embrace the New Age belonged to the baby boomer generation, those born between 1946 and 1964.\nSutcliffe noted that although most influential New Age figureheads were male, approximately two-thirds of its participants were female. Heelas and Woodhead's Kendal Project found that of those regularly attending New Age activities in the town, 80% were female, while 78% of those running such activities were female. They attributed this female dominance to \"deeply entrenched cultural values and divisions of labour\" in Western society, according to which women were accorded greater responsibility for the well-being of others, thus making New Age practices more attractive to them. They suggested that men were less attracted to New Age activities because they were hampered by a \"masculinist ideal of autonomy and self-sufficiency\" which discouraged them from seeking the assistance of others for their inner development.\nThe majority of New Agers are from the middle and upper-middle classes of Western society. Heelas and Woodhead found that of the active Kendal New Agers, 57% had a university or college degree. Their Kendal Project also determined that 73% of active New Agers were aged over 45, and 55% were aged between 40 and 59; it also determined that many got involved while middle-aged. Comparatively few were either young or elderly. Heelas and Woodhead suggested that the dominance of middle-aged people, particularly women, was because at this stage of life they had greater time to devote to their own inner development, with their time previously having been dominated by raising children. They also suggested that middle-aged people were experiencing more age-related ailments than the young, and thus more keen to pursue New Age activities to improve their health.\nHeelas added that within the baby boomers, the movement had nevertheless attracted a diverse clientele. He typified the typical New Ager as someone who was well-educated yet disenchanted with mainstream society, thus arguing that the movement catered to those who believe that modernity is in crisis. He suggested that the movement appealed to many former practitioners of the 1960s counter-culture because while they came to feel that they were unable to change society, they were nonetheless interested in changing the self. He believed that many individuals had been \"culturally primed for what the New Age has to offer\", with the New Age attracting \"expressive\" people who were already comfortable with the ideals and outlooks of the movement's self-spirituality focus. It could be particularly appealing because the New Age suited the needs of the individual, whereas traditional religious options that are available primarily catered for the needs of a community. He believed that although the adoption of New Age beliefs and practices by some fitted the model of religious conversion, others who adopted some of its practices could not easily be considered to have converted to the religion. Sutcliffe described the \"typical\" participant in the New Age milieu as being \"a religious individualist, mixing and matching cultural resources in an animated spiritual quest\".\nThe degree to which individuals are involved in the New Age varies. Heelas argued that those involved could be divided into three broad groups; the first comprised those who were completely dedicated to it and its ideals, often working in professions that furthered those goals. The second consisted of \"serious part-timers\" who worked in unrelated fields but who nevertheless spent much of their free time involved in movement activities. The third was that of \"casual part-timers\" who occasionally involved themselves in New Age activities but for whom the movement was not a central aspect of their life. MacKian instead suggested that involvement could be seen as being layered like an onion; at the core are \"consultative\" practitioners who devote their life to New Age practices, around that are \"serious\" practitioners who still invest considerable effort into New Age activities, and on the periphery are \"non-practitioner consumers\", individuals affected by the general dissemination of New Age ideas but who do not devote themselves more fully to them. Many New Age practices have filtered into wider Western society, with a 2000 poll, for instance, revealing that 39% of the UK population had tried alternative therapies.\nIn 1995, Kyle stated that on the whole, New Agers in the United States preferred the values of the Democratic Party over those of the Republican Party. He added that most New Agers \"soundly rejected\" the agenda of former Republican President Ronald Reagan.\nSocial communities.\nMacKian suggested that this phenomenon was \"an inherently \"social\" mode of spirituality\", one which cultivated a sense of belonging among its participants and encouraged relations both with other humans and with non-human, otherworldly spirit entities.\nMacKian suggested that these communities \"may look very different\" from those of traditional religious groups.\nOnline connections were one of the ways that interested individuals met new contacts and established networks.\nCommercial aspects.\nSome New Agers advocate living in a simple and sustainable manner to reduce humanity's impact on the natural resources of Earth; and they shun consumerism. The New Age movement has been centered around rebuilding a sense of community to counter social disintegration; this has been attempted through the formation of intentional communities, where individuals come together to live and work in a communal lifestyle. New Age centres have been set up in various parts of the world, representing an institutionalised form of the movement. Notable examples include the Naropa Institute in Boulder, Colorado, Holly Hock Farm near to Vancouver, the Wrekin Trust in West Malvern, Worcestershire, and the Skyros Centre in Skyros. Criticising mainstream Western education as counterproductive to the ethos of the movement, many New Age groups have established their own schools for the education of children, although in other cases such groups have sought to introduce New Age spiritual techniques into pre-existing establishments.\nBruce argued that in seeking to \"denying the validity of externally imposed controls and privileging the divine within\", the New Age sought to dismantle pre-existing social order, but that it failed to present anything adequate in its place. Heelas, however, cautioned that Bruce had arrived at this conclusion based on \"flimsy evidence\", and Aldred argued that only a minority of New Agers participate in community-focused activities; instead, she argued, the majority of New Agers participate mainly through the purchase of books and products targeted at the New Age market, positioning New Age as a primarily consumerist and commercial movement.\nFairs and festivals.\nNew Age spirituality has led to a wide array of literature on the subject and an active niche market, with books, music, crafts, and services in alternative medicine available at New Age stores, fairs, and festivals.\nNew Age fairs\u2014sometimes known as \"Mind, Body, Spirit fairs\", \"psychic fairs\", or \"alternative health fairs\"\u2014are spaces in which a variety of goods and services are displayed by different vendors, including forms of alternative medicine and esoteric practices such as palmistry or tarot card reading. An example is the Mind Body Spirit Festival, held annually in the United Kingdom, at which\u2014the religious studies scholar Christopher Partridge noted\u2014one could encounter \"a wide range of beliefs and practices from crystal healing to ... Kirlian photography to psychic art, from angels to past-life therapy, from Theosophy to UFO religion, and from New Age music to the vegetarianism of Suma Chign Hai.\" Similar festivals are held across Europe and in Australia and the United States.\nApproaches to financial prosperity and business.\nA number of New Age proponents have emphasised the use of spiritual techniques as a tool for attaining financial prosperity, thus moving the movement away from its counter-cultural origins. Commenting on this \"New Age capitalism\", Hess observed that it was largely small-scale and entrepreneurial, focused around small companies run by members of the petite bourgeoisie, rather than being dominated by large scale multinational corporations. The links between New Age and commercial products have resulted in the accusation that New Age itself is little more than a manifestation of consumerism. This idea is generally rejected by New Age participants, who often reject any link between their practices and consumerist activities.\nEmbracing this attitude, various books have been published espousing such an ethos, established New Age centres have held spiritual retreats and classes aimed specifically at business people, and New Age groups have developed specialised training for businesses. During the 1980s, many U.S. corporations\u2014among them IBM, AT&amp;T, and General Motors\u2014embraced New Age seminars, hoping that they could increase productivity and efficiency among their workforce, although in several cases this resulted in employees bringing legal action against their employers, saying that such seminars had infringed on their religious beliefs or damaged their psychological health. However, the use of spiritual techniques as a method for attaining profit has been an issue of major dispute within the wider New Age movement, with New Agers such as Spangler and Matthew Fox criticising what they see as trends within the community that are narcissistic and lack a social conscience. In particular, the movement's commercial elements have caused problems given that they often conflict with its general economically egalitarian ethos; as York highlighted, \"a tension exists in New Age between socialistic egalitarianism and capitalistic private enterprise\".\nGiven that it encourages individuals to choose spiritual practices on the grounds of personal preference and thus encourages them to behave as a consumer, the New Age has been considered to be well suited to modern society.\nMusic.\nThe term \"new-age music\" is applied, sometimes negatively, to forms of ambient music, a genre that developed in the 1960s and was popularised in the 1970s, particularly with the work of Brian Eno. The genre's relaxing nature resulted in it becoming popular within New Age circles, with some forms of the genre having a specifically New Age orientation. Studies have determined that new-age music can be an effective component of stress management.\nThe style began in the late 1960s and early 1970s with the works of free-form jazz groups recording on the ECM label; such as Oregon, the Paul Winter Consort, and other pre-ambient bands; as well as ambient music performer Brian Eno, classical avant-garde musician Daniel Kobialka, and the psychoacoustic \"environments\" recordings of Irv Teibel. In the early 1970s, it was mostly instrumental with both acoustic and electronic styles. New-age music evolved to include a wide range of styles from electronic space music using synthesizers and acoustic instrumentals using Native American flutes and drums, singing bowls, Australian didgeridoos and world music sounds to spiritual chanting from other cultures.\nPolitics.\nWhile many commentators have focused on the spiritual and cultural aspects of the New Age movement, it also has a political component. The New Age political movement became visible in the 1970s, peaked in the 1980s, and continued into the 1990s. The sociologist of religion Steven Bruce noted that the New Age provides ideas on how to deal with \"our socio-psychological problems\". Scholar of religion James R. Lewis observed that, despite the common caricature of New Agers as narcissistic, \"significant numbers\" of them were \"trying to make the planet a better place on which to live,\" and scholar J. Gordon Melton's \"New Age Encyclopedia\" (1990) included an entry called \"New Age politics\". Some New Agers have entered the political system in an attempt to advocate for the societal transformation that the New Age promotes.\nIdeas.\nAlthough New Age activists have been motivated by New Age concepts like holism, interconnectedness, monism, and environmentalism, their political ideas are diverse, ranging from far-right and conservative through to liberal, socialist, and libertarian. Accordingly, Kyle stated that \"New Age politics is difficult to describe and categorize. The standard political labels\u2014left or right, liberal or conservative\u2014miss the mark.\" MacKian suggested that the New Age operated as a form of \"world-realigning infrapolitics\" that undermines the disenchantment of modern Western society.\nThe extent to which New Age spokespeople mix religion and politics varies. New Agers are often critical of the established political order, regarding it as \"fragmented, unjust, hierarchical, patriarchal, and obsolete\". The New Ager Mark Satin for instance spoke of \"New Age politics\" as a politically radical \"third force\" that was \"neither left nor right\". He believed that in contrast to the conventional political focus on the \"institutional and economic symptoms\" of society's problems, his \"New Age politics\" would focus on \"psychocultural roots\" of these issues. Ferguson regarded New Age politics as \"a kind of Radical Centre\", one that was \"not neutral, not middle-of-the-road, but a view of the whole road.\" Fritjof Capra argued that Western societies have become sclerotic because of their adherence to an outdated and mechanistic view of reality, which he calls the \"Newtonian/Cartesian paradigm\". In Capra's view, the West needs to develop an organic and ecological \"systems view\" of reality in order to successfully address its social and political issues. Corinne McLaughlin argued that politics need not connote endless power struggles, that a new \"spiritual politics\" could attempt to synthesize opposing views on issues into higher levels of understanding.\nMany New Agers advocate globalisation and localisation, but reject nationalism and the role of the nation-state. Some New Age spokespeople have called for greater decentralisation and global unity, but are vague about how this might be achieved; others call for a global, centralised government. Satin for example argued for a move away from the nation-state and towards self-governing regions that, through improved global communication networks, would help engender world unity. Benjamin Creme conversely argued that \"the Christ\", a great Avatar, Maitreya, the World Teacher, expected by all the major religions as their \"Awaited One\", would return to the world and establish a strong, centralised global government in the form of the United Nations; this would be politically re-organised along a spiritual hierarchy. Kyle observed that New Agers often speak favourably of democracy and citizens' involvement in policy making but are critical of representative democracy and majority rule, thus displaying elitist ideas to their thinking.\nGroups.\nScholars have noted several New Age political groups. Self-Determination: A Personal/Political Network, lauded by Ferguson and Satin, was described at length by sociology of religion scholar Steven Tipton. Founded in 1975 by California state legislator John Vasconcellos and others, it encouraged Californians to engage in personal growth work and political activities at the same time, especially at the grassroots level. Hanegraaff noted another California-based group, the Institute of Noetic Sciences, headed by the author Willis Harman. It advocated a change in consciousness\u2014in \"basic underlying assumptions\"\u2014in order to come to grips with global crises. Kyle said that the New York City\u2013based Planetary Citizens organization, headed by United Nations consultant and \"Earth at Omega\" author Donald Keys, sought to implement New Age political ideas.\nScholar J. Gordon Melton and colleagues focused on the New World Alliance, a Washington, DC\u2013based organization founded in 1979 by Mark Satin and others. According to Melton et al., the Alliance tried to combine left- and right-wing ideas as well as personal growth work and political activities. Group decision-making was facilitated by short periods of silence. Sponsors of the Alliance's national political newsletter included Willis Harman and John Vasconcellos. Scholar James R. Lewis counted \"Green politics\" as one of the New Age's more visible activities. One academic book says that the U.S. Green Party movement began as an initiative of a handful of activists including Charlene Spretnak, co-author of a \"'new age' interpretation\" of the German Green movement (Capra and Spretnak's \"Green Politics\"), and Mark Satin, author of \"New Age Politics\". Another academic publication says Spretnak and Satin largely co-drafted the U.S. Greens' founding document, the \"Ten Key Values\" statement.\nIn the 21st century.\nWhile the term \"New Age\" may have fallen out of favor, scholar George Chryssides notes that the New Age by whatever name is \"still alive and active\" in the 21st century. In the realm of politics, New Ager Mark Satin's book \"Radical Middle\" (2004) reached out to mainstream liberals. York (2005) identified \"key New Age spokespeople\" including William Bloom, Satish Kumar, and Starhawk who were emphasizing a link between spirituality and environmental consciousness. Former Esalen Institute staffer Stephen Dinan's \"Sacred America, Sacred World\" (2016) prompted a long interview of Dinan in \"Psychology Today\", which called the book a \"manifesto for our country's evolution that is both political and deeply spiritual\".\nIn 2013 longtime New Age author Marianne Williamson launched a campaign for a seat in the United States House of Representatives, telling \"The New York Times\" that her type of spirituality was what American politics needed. \"America has swerved from its ethical center\", she said. Running as an independent in west Los Angeles, she finished fourth in her district's open primary election with 13% of the vote. In early 2019, Williamson announced her candidacy for the Democratic Party nomination for president of the United States in the 2020 United States presidential election. A 5,300-word article about her presidential campaign in \"The Washington Post\" said she had \"plans to fix America with love. Tough love\". In January 2020 she withdrew her bid for the nomination. She ran for the Presidency again beginning in March 2023, but ended her bid in July 2024.\nIn the 2020s, several longtime New Age political thinkers and activists wrote books attempting to draw lessons from their experiences. Among them: \"Far Out Man: Tales of Life in the Counterculture\", by \"New Age Journal\" co-founder and \"Utne Reader\" founder Eric Utne; \"Up From Socialism: My 60-Year Search for a Healing New Radical Politics\", by \"New Age Politics\" author and New World Alliance co-founder Mark Satin; and \"From Vision to Action: Remaking the World Through Social Entrepreneurship\", by Search for Common Ground founder John D. Marks.\nReception.\nPopular media.\nMainstream periodicals tended to be less than sympathetic; sociologist Paul Ray and psychologist Sherry Anderson discussed in their 2000 book \"The Cultural Creatives\", what they called the media's \"zest for attacking\" New Age ideas, and offered the example of a 1996 Lance Morrow essay in \"Time\" magazine. Nearly a decade earlier, \"Time\" had run a long cover story critical of New Age culture; the cover featured a headshot of a famous actress beside the headline, \"Om... THE NEW AGE starring Shirley MacLaine, faith healers, channelers, space travelers, and crystals galore\". The story itself, by former \"Saturday Evening Post\" editor Otto Friedrich, was sub-titled, \"A Strange Mix of Spirituality and Superstition Is Sweeping Across the Country\". In 1988, the magazine \"The New Republic\" ran a four-page critique of New Age culture and politics by a journalist Richard Blow entitled simply, \"Moronic Convergence\".\nSome New Agers and New Age sympathizers responded to such criticisms. For example, sympathizers Ray and Anderson said that much of it was an attempt to \"stereotype\" the movement for idealistic and spiritual change, and to cut back on its popularity. New Age theoretician David Spangler tried to distance himself from what he called the \"New Age glamour\" of crystals, talk-show channelers, and other easily commercialized phenomena, and sought to underscore his commitment to the New Age as a vision of genuine social transformation.\nAcademia.\nInitially, academic interest in the New Age was minimal. The earliest academic studies of the New Age phenomenon were performed by specialists in the study of new religious movements such as Robert Ellwood. This research was often scanty because many scholars regarded the New Age as an insignificant cultural fad. Having been influenced by the U.S. anti-cult movement, much of it was also largely negative and critical of New Age groups. The \"first truly scholarly study\" of the phenomenon was an edited volume put together by James R. Lewis and J. Gordon Melton in 1992. From that point on, the number of published academic studies steadily increased.\nIn 1994, Christoph Bochinger published his study of the New Age in Germany, \"\"New Age\" und moderne Religion\". This was followed by Michael York's sociological study in 1995 and Richard Kyle's U.S.-focused work in 1995. In 1996, Paul Heelas published a sociological study of the movement in Britain, being the first to discuss its relationship with business. That same year, Wouter Hanegraaff published \"New Age Religion and Western Culture\", a historical analysis of New Age texts; Hammer later described it as having \"a well-deserved reputation as the standard reference work on the New Age\". Most of these early studies were based on a textual analysis of New Age publications, rather than on an ethnographic analysis of its practitioners.\nSutcliffe and Gilhus argued that 'New Age studies' could be seen as having experienced two waves; in the first, scholars focused on \"macro-level analyses of the content and boundaries\" of the \"movement\", while the second wave featured \"more variegated and contextualized studies of particular beliefs and practices\". Sutcliffe and Gilhus have also expressed concern that, as of 2013, 'New Age studies' has yet to formulate a set of research questions scholars can pursue.\nThe New Age has proved a challenge for scholars of religion operating under more formative models of what \"religion\" is. By 2006, Heelas noted that the New Age was so vast and diverse that no scholar of the subject could hope to keep up with all of it.\nChristian perspectives.\nMainstream Christianity has typically rejected the ideas of the New Age; Christian critiques often emphasise that the New Age places the human individual before God. Most published criticism of the New Age has been produced by Christians, particularly those on the religion's fundamentalist wing. In the United States, the New Age became a major concern of evangelical Christian groups in the 1980s, an attitude that influenced British evangelical groups. During that decade, evangelical writers such as Constance Cumbey, Dave Hunt, Gary North, and Douglas Groothuis published books criticising the New Age; a number propagated conspiracy theories regarding its origin and purpose. The most successful such publication was Frank E. Peretti's 1986 novel \"This Present Darkness\", which sold over a million copies; it depicted the New Age as being in league with feminism and secular education as part of a conspiracy to overthrow Christianity. Modern Christian critics of the New Age include Doreen Virtue, a former New Age writer from California who converted to fundamentalist Christianity in 2017.\nOfficial responses to the New Age have been produced by major Christian organisations like the Roman Catholic Church, the Church of England, and the Methodist Church. The Roman Catholic Church published \"A Christian reflection on the New Age\" in 2003, following a six-year study; the 90-page document criticizes New Age practices such as yoga, meditation, feng shui, and crystal healing. According to the Vatican, euphoric states attained through New Age practices should not be confused with prayer or viewed as signs of God's presence. Cardinal Paul Poupard, then-president of the Pontifical Council for Culture, said the New Age is \"a misleading answer to the oldest hopes of man\". Monsignor Michael Fitzgerald, then-president of the Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue, stated at the Vatican conference on the document: the \"Church avoids any concept that is close to those of the New Age\". On the contrary, some fringe Christian groups have adopted a more positive view of the New Age, among them the Christaquarians, and Christians Awakening to a New Awareness, all of which believe that New Age ideas can enhance a person's Christian faith.\nContemporary Pagan perspectives.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nNeopagan practices highlight the centrality of the relationship between humans and nature and reinvent religions of the past, while New Agers are more interested in transforming individual consciousness and shaping the future.\n\u2014 Religious studies scholar Sarah Pike.\nThere is academic debate about the connection between the New Age and Modern Paganism, sometimes termed \"Neo-paganism\". The two phenomena have often been confused and conflated, particularly in Christian critiques. Religious studies scholar Sarah Pike asserted that there was a \"significant overlap\" between the two religious movements, while Aidan A. Kelly stated that Paganism \"parallels the New Age movement in some ways, differs sharply from it in others, and overlaps it in some minor ways\". Other scholars have identified them as distinct phenomena that share overlap and commonalities. Hanegraaff suggested that whereas various forms of contemporary Paganism were not part of the New Age movement\u2014particularly those that pre-dated the movement\u2014other Pagan religions and practices could be identified as New Age. Partridge portrayed both Paganism and the New Age as different streams of occulture (occult culture) that merge at points.\nVarious differences between the two movements have been highlighted; the New Age movement focuses on an improved future, whereas the focus of Paganism is on the pre-Christian past. Similarly, the New Age movement typically propounds a universalist message that sees all religions as fundamentally the same, whereas Paganism stresses the difference between monotheistic religions and those embracing a polytheistic or animistic theology. While the New Age emphasises a light-centred image, Paganism acknowledges both light and dark, life and death, and recognises the savage side of the natural world. Many Pagans have sought to distance themselves from the New Age movement, even using \"New Age\" as an insult within their community, while conversely many involved in the New Age have expressed criticism of Paganism for emphasizing the material world over the spiritual. Many Pagans have expressed criticism of the high fees charged by New Age teachers, something not typically present in the Pagan movement.\nNon-Western and Indigenous criticism.\nNew Age often adopts spiritual ideas and practices from other, particularly non-Western cultures. According to York, these may include \"Hawaiian Kahuna magic, Australian Aboriginal dream-working, South American Amerindian \"ayahuasca\" and \"San Pedro\" ceremonies, Hindu Ayurveda and yoga, Chinese Feng Shui, Qi Gong, and Tai Chi.\"\nThe New Age has been accused of cultural imperialism, misappropriating sacred ceremonies, and exploitation of the intellectual and cultural property of Indigenous peoples. Indigenous American spiritual leaders, such as Elders councils of the Lakota, Cheyenne, Navajo, Creek, Hopi, Chippewa, and Haudenosaunee have denounced New Age misappropriation of their sacred ceremonies and other intellectual property, stating that \"[t]he value of these instructions and ceremonies [when led by unauthorized people] are questionable, maybe meaningless, and hurtful to the individual carrying false messages\". Traditional leaders of the Lakota, Dakota, and Nakota peoples have reached consensus to reject \"the expropriation of [their] ceremonial ways by non-Indians\". They see the New Age movement as either not fully understanding, deliberately trivializing, or distorting their way of life, and strongly disapprove of all such \"plastic medicine people\" who are appropriating their spiritual ways.\nIndigenous leaders have spoken out against individuals from within their own communities who may go out into the world to become a \"white man's shaman\", and any \"who are prostituting our spiritual ways for their own selfish gain, with no regard for the spiritual well-being of the people as a whole\". The terms \"plastic shaman\" and \"plastic medicine person\" have been used to describe an outsider who identifies or promotes themselves as a shaman, holy person, or other traditional spiritual leader, yet has no genuine connection to the traditions or cultures represented.\nPolitical writers and activists.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nNew Age politics might be seen not as a wayward, pathological creature of the New Left's imagination, but as a political innocent in candid, questioning dialogue with the unclaimed mainstream territory of progressive, rather than atomistic, individualism. Indeed, if we were to examine some of the social and political threads that run through the aery fabric of New Age thinking, we would find certain themes that resonate with the necessary conditions for a left version of progressive individualism. Generally speaking, New Age addresses its adherents as active participants, with a measure of control over their everyday lives. ... The New Age \"person\" is also in many respects an individual whose personal growth is indissociable from the environment; a link fleshed out in a variety of ecotopian stories and romances. So, too, the small-scale imperative of New Age's cooperative communitarianism brings with it a host of potentially critical positions. ...\n\u2014 Scholar of cultural studies Andrew Ross, 1991 \nToward the end of the 20th century, some social and political analysts and activists were arguing that the New Age political perspective had something to offer mainstream society. In 1987, some political scientists launched the \"Section on Ecological and Transformational Politics\" of the American Political Science Association, and an academic book prepared by three of them stated that the \"transformational politics\" concept was meant to subsume such terms as \"new age\" and \"new paradigm\". In 1991, scholar of cultural studies Andrew Ross suggested that New Age political ideas\u2014however muddled and na\u00efve\u2014could help progressives construct an appealing alternative to both atomistic individualism and self-denying collectivism. In 2005, British researcher Stuart Rose urged scholars of alternative religions to pay more attention to the New Age's interest in such topics as \"new socio-political thinking\" and \"New Economics\", topics Rose discussed in his book \"Transforming the World: Bringing the New Age Into Focus\", issued by a European academic publisher.\nOther political thinkers and activists saw New Age politics less positively. On the political right, author George Weigel argued that New Age politics was just a retooled and pastel-colored version of leftism. Conservative evangelical writer Douglas Groothuis, discussed by scholars Hexham and Kemp, warned that New Age politics could lead to an oppressive world government. On the left, scholars argued that New Age politics was an oxymoron: that personal growth has little or nothing to do with political change. One political scientist said New Age politics fails to recognize the reality of economic and political power. Another academic, Dana L. Cloud, wrote a lengthy critique of New Age politics as a political ideology; she faulted it for not being opposed to the capitalist system, or to liberal individualism.\nA criticism of New Age often made by leftists is that its focus on individualism deflects participants from engaging in socio-political activism. This perspective regards New Age as a manifestation of consumerism that promotes elitism and indulgence by allowing wealthier people to affirm their socio-economic status through consuming New Age products and therapies. New Agers who do engage in socio-political activism have also been criticized. Journalist Harvey Wasserman suggested that New Age activists were too averse to social conflict to be effective politically. Melton et al. found that New Age activists' commitment to the often frustrating process of consensus decision-making led to \"extended meetings and minimal results\", and a pair of futurists concluded that one once-promising New Age activist group had been both \"too visionary and too vague\" to last.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWorks cited.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

She is best known as the author of \"Sailor Moon\", one of the most popular manga series of all time. She has won several awards, including the 1993 Kodansha Manga Award for \"Sailor Moon\".\nTakeuchi is married to Yoshihiro Togashi, the author of \"YuYu Hakusho\" and \"Hunter \u00d7 Hunter\".\nEarly life.\nTakeuchi was born in Kofu, Yamanashi, Japan to Kenji and Ikuko Takeuchi. She has a younger brother, Shingo. She gave the names of her relatives to the characters she created for \"Sailor Moon\", and mentions this in interviews and in several comic strips she produced, in place of author notes.\nTakeuchi attended Kofu Ichi High School, where she wore a sailor uniform and joined the astronomy and manga clubs. These experiences influenced her work for \"Sailor Moon\", in addition to her other pieces, such as \"Love Call\" and \"Rain Kiss\". Her formative high school experiences influenced her trajectory to become a manga artist. Takeuchi's father encouraged her to pursue other career paths, in case she wouldn't find success as a professional artist, which is why she attended university to study chemistry.\nTakeuchi graduated from the Kyoritsu College of Pharmacy, where she received a degree in chemistry and became a licensed pharmacist. Her senior thesis was called \"Heightened Effects of Thrombolytic Actions Due to Ultrasound\".\nCareer.\n1986\u20131997: Early work and success.\nAfter graduating from the Kyoritsu College of Pharmacy, at the age of 19, Takeuchi entered the manga industry by submitting her work \"Love Call\" to Kodansha; Takeuchi received Nakayoshi's New Artist award for \"Love Call\". She worked steadily on one-shot pieces until writing \"Maria\", which was published in \"Nakayoshi\" from early to mid-1990. This work, Takeuchi's first serial comic, was loosely based on Jean Webster's 1912 novel \"Daddy-Long-Legs\" and on her friend Marie Koizumi, who helped write it.\nAfter completing \"Maria\", Takeuchi worked on the ice-skating series \"The Cherry Project\", which was serialized in \"Nakayoshi\" from late 1990 to 1991. While working on \"The Cherry Project\", Takeuchi wanted to do a manga on outer space and girl fighters. Her editor, Fumio Osano, asked her to put the fighters in sailor suits. This concept would later become a one-shot called \"\", which would later begin serialization in \"RunRun\". When Toei Animation planned to adapt her manga into an anime series, she reworked \"Sailor V\" and added four other superheroines.\nIn December 1991, \"Nakayoshi\" began serializing \"Sailor Moon\", which became an instant hit. The success encouraged Takeuchi to work on both \"Sailor Moon\" and \"Sailor V\" from 1991 to 1997. However, \"RunRun\" was canceled with the November 1997 issue, and the planned \"Sailor V\" anime adaptation was canceled along with it. During that six-year period, she produced 60 chapters, which were collected in 18 volumes. The success of the manga led to a 200-episode anime adaptation, three animated films, numerous video games, and wide-ranging merchandising.\nShe had an interview with Silent M\u00f6bius creator, Kia Asamiya.\nAt the series' end, Takeuchi worked on \"PQ Angels\" for \"Nakayoshi\". This gained a fair amount of popularity, but was canceled due to Kodansha losing seven pages of her manuscript. Takeuchi said that Toei Animation had the manuscript, therefore it would have been possible to create an anime adaptation of the series.\nTakeuchi's own studio is called \"Princess Naoko Planning\" (PNP). Takeuchi established PNP to manage her properties, mainly \"Sailor Moon\". The studio later encompassed Yoshihiro Togashi's work as well and appeared in the credits for such anime as \"Level E\" and \"Hunter \u00d7 Hunter\". Its name also appears on the musical credits for \"Shin Kaguya Shima Densetsu\" and other projects.\n1998\u20132009.\nFollowing the loss of seven pages of Takeuchi's \"PQ Angels\" manuscript, Osano departed Kodansha and the plans for the \"Materials Collection\" were canceled. Takeuchi departed Kodansha for Shueisha.\nOn August 13, 1998, Takeuchi made her first appearance in the United States at San Diego Comic-Con for three days. That same year, she published the first \"Sailor Moon\" artbook since her departure from Kodansha, \"Sailor Moon Infinity Collection Art Book\" with limited releases.\nWhile working on her short comic strip \"Princess Naoko Takeuchi Back-to-Work Punch!!\", Takeuchi met Yoshihiro Togashi at a \"Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump\" meeting hosted by Kazushi Hagiwara, and had a meeting arranged between them by voice actress Megumi Ogata. She collaborated with Togashi as an assistant (doing screentone) and as a manager on volume 1 of \"Hunter \u00d7 Hunter\". However, the work and the demands proved more than she had expected, and as a result, Takeuchi left Shueisha.\nAround this time, Takeuchi conceived the idea for a one-shot called \"Toki\u2606Meka\", which eventually turned into \"Toki\u2606Meca\". Togashi had a similar idea at the same time as her, but never fully brought it to fruition. He helped somewhat with \"Toki\u2606Meka\" at this point in developing the idea by drawing some concept sketches, which Takeuchi showed in \"Toki\u2606Meca\" volume 1.\nTogashi and Takeuchi married in 1999. From this marriage, the couple have two children: a son, born in January 2001, and a daughter, born in 2009.\nAfter Kodansha's rights to \"Sailor Moon\" expired, Takeuchi returned to the publisher in 1999 to develop and publish the \"Materials Collection\". She also began serializing \"Love Witch\", but it was cancelled. Takeuchi started to work on the reprints of \"Sailor Moon\" and \"Sailor V\", and published \"Toki\u2606Meca\" in \"Nakayoshi\".\nIn 2003, Takeuchi became heavily involved in producing \"Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon\", a tokusatsu television series based on \"Sailor Moon\", as she had an interest in learning more about the anime industry. This culminated in the creation of \"Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon\". The series displays a plot that is heavily reliant on the manga and also explores many themes that the manga was unable to explore. She showed up at the official conference with a fist up, meaning \"good luck\", in Act Zero.\nAfter the production of \"Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon\" ended in 2004, Takeuchi continued to work on \"Toki\u2606Meca\". During the manga's serialization, Osano returned as her editor. Takeuchi also worked more closely with managing PNP and gave talks to college students. At the same time, she wrote a children's book titled \"Oboo-nu- to Chiboo-nu-\" as a birthday present to her son. (Togashi provided illustrations for the book; Takeuchi made mention of this in the back of the first volume of \"Toki\u2606Meca\".) She still works on the website, updating it about once a month with new flash animations or profiles.\n2010\u20132019.\nIn 2012, it was announced that a new \"Sailor Moon\" anime adaptation was in development. With it, Takeuchi started a \"Kanzenban\" version of the manga, which was announced by Osano, and will include fixed past mistakes and new covers for the manga. Color pages are also included for the title pages. There was also an artbook announced, and she has been working on merchandise, which was announced by Osano on his Twitter feed.\nThe new reboot anime, \"Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon Crystal\", debuted in July 2014. It streamed on Niconico bi-weekly, and ended in July 2015, spanning a total of 26 episodes, which cover the \"Dark Kingdom\" and \"Black Moon\" arc of the manga. Takeuchi wrote the ending theme song, , under her penname, . The series eventually gained its 13-episode third season, \"Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon Crystal Season III\", covering the \"Infinity\" arc of the manga (known as \"Death Busters\" in Japan), and aired weekly on Japanese television from April to June 2016.\n2020\u2013present.\nIn 2020, the two volumes of official of the \"Sailor Moon\" manga was released on June 29, with Takeuchi providing new illustrations for both covers.\nIn 2021, Takeuchi chief supervised the production of the two-part anime film, \"Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon Eternal The Movie\", which adapted the \"Dream\" arc of the manga (known as \"Dead Moon\" in Japan), and acted as a \"fourth season\" for the \"Sailor Moon Crystal\" series. Both films were released in 2021 in Japanese theaters, with the first film on January 8, and the second film on February 11. Takeuchi also provided the lyrics for the theme song, , under the name of \"Sumire Shirobara\".\nIn 2022, Takeuchi chief supervised the production of the sequel to \"Sailor Moon Eternal\", titled \"Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon Cosmos The Movie\". The two-part film covered the \"Stars\" arc of the manga (known as \"Shadow Galactica\" in Japan), and acted as a \"fifth and final season\" for the \"Sailor Moon Crystal\" series. Both films were released in June 2023, with the first film on the 9th, and the second film on the 30th.\nWorks.\nSong lyrics.\nTakeuchi wrote the lyrics for a number of songs featured in the \"Sailor Moon\" anime and live-action series. Though mainly character-based image songs, they include a few theme songs.\nThese include:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAwards.\nTakeuchi has won several awards, including the 2nd Nakayoshi Comic Prize for Newcomers for \"Yume ja Nai no Ne\" in 1985. She also won for \"Love Call\", which won Nakayoshi's New Artist award which debuted in the Nakayoshi Deluxe September 1986 issue. In 1993 she won the 17th Kodansha Manga Award for sh\u014djo for \"Sailor Moon\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is also referred to as a plea of no contest or no defense. It is a plea where the defendant neither admits nor disputes a charge, serving as an alternative to a pleading of guilty or not guilty. A no-contest plea means that defendants refuse to admit guilt but accept punishment as if guilty, and is often offered as a part of a plea bargain.\nThe plea is recognized in United States federal criminal courts, and many state criminal courts. In many jurisdictions, a plea of ' is not a typical right and carries various restrictions on its use. ' originated from the Latin phrase for \"I do not wish to contend\" (, ).\nUnited States.\nIn the United States, state law determines whether, and under what circumstances, a defendant may plead no contest in state criminal cases. In federal court, the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure only allow a \"\" plea to be entered with the court's consent; before accepting the plea, the court is required to \"consider the parties' views and the public interest in the effective administration of justice\".\nResidual effects.\nA ' plea has the same \"immediate\" effects as a plea of guilty, but may have different \"residual\" effects or consequences in future actions. For instance, a conviction arising from a ' plea is subject to any and all penalties, fines, and forfeitures of a conviction from a guilty plea in the same case, and can be considered as an aggravating factor in future criminal actions. However, unlike a guilty plea, a defendant in a ' plea may not be required to allocute the charges. This means that a ' conviction typically may not be used to establish either negligence \"per se\", malice, or whether the acts were committed at all in later civil proceedings related to the same set of facts as the criminal prosecution.\nUnder the Federal Rules of Evidence, and in those states whose rules of evidence are similar or identical to them, \"\" pleas may not be used to defeat the hearsay prohibition if offered as an \"admission by [a] party-opponent\". Assuming the appropriate gravity of the charge, and all other things being equal, a guilty plea to the same charge would cause the reverse effect: An opponent at trial could introduce the plea, over a hearsay objection, as evidence to establish a certain fact.\nCompared with Alford plea.\n' plea is similar to an Alford plea (also known as a \"best interest plea\"). An Alford plea allows a criminal defendant to formally record an admission of guilt for the charges, yet\u2014at the same time\u2014 declare their innocence regarding those charges. Under an Alford plea, the defendant agrees to accept all the consequences of a guilty verdict\u2014such as accepting punishment. An Alford plea bypasses the full process of a criminal trial. The primary distinction between an Alford plea and a ' plea is that, in an Alford plea, the defendant pleads guilty (in a formal sense) yet in a \"\" plea, the defendant does not assert innocence or guilt. A formal admission of guilt under an Alford plea can be used against the defendant in future civil suits, whereas nolo contendere pleas cannot.\nIndividual states.\nAlaska.\nIn Alaska, a criminal conviction based on a \"\" plea may be used against the defendant in future civil actions. The Alaska Supreme Court ruled in 2006 that a \"conviction based on a no contest plea will collaterally estop the criminal defendant from denying any element in a subsequent civil action against him that was necessarily established by the conviction, as long as the prior conviction was for a serious criminal offense and the defendant in fact had the opportunity for a full and fair hearing\".\nCalifornia.\nIn California, a ' plea is known as a \"West plea\" after a seminal case involving plea bargains, \"People v. West\" (1970) 3 Cal.3d 595. The state Board of Pharmacy considers a plea of ' to be deemed a conviction with regard to issuing licenses for pharmacies, pharmacists and drug wholesalers.\nA \"nolo contendere\" plea to any felony is considered exactly equivalent to a guilty plea for the purposes of civil actions; this plea to any non-felony is not admissible to a civil action.\nFlorida.\nIn Florida, the Supreme Court held in 2005 that no-contest convictions may be treated as prior convictions for the purposes of future sentencing.\nMichigan.\nIn Michigan, \"A \"nolo contendere\" plea does not admit guilt, it merely communicates to the court that the criminal defendant does not wish to contest the state's accusations and will acquiesce in the imposition of punishment.\" A \"nolo contendere\" plea may be appropriate \"where the defendant would not be able to supply a sufficient factual basis for a guilty plea because he or she was intoxicated on the night of the incident, where there is the possibility of future civil litigation resulting from the offense, or where a defendant cannot remember the events which led to his or her being charged with a crime\".\nA no contest plea prevents the court from eliciting a defendant's admission of guilt, but the result of the defendant's plea not to contest the charges against him or her is the same as if the defendant had admitted guilt. If a defendant pleads no contest to a charged offense, with the exception of questioning the defendant about his or her role in the charged offense, the court must proceed in the same manner as if the defendant had pleaded guilty. A plea of no contest to a felony offense requires the court's consent.\nA defendant's no contest plea to criminal charges does not \"estop\" that defendant from denying responsibility in a later civil action arising from the same conduct.\nSouth Carolina.\nAccording to South Carolina code, the defendant in any misdemeanor case in any of the courts may enter a plea of \"nolo contendere\" with the consent of the court. The plea of guilty will be recorded on defendant records and will not affect sentencing.\nTexas.\nIn Texas, the right to appeal the results of a plea bargain taken from a plea of either ' or \"guilty\" is highly restricted. Defendants who have entered a plea of ' may only appeal the judgment of the court if the appeal is based on written pretrial motions ruled upon by the court.\nVirginia.\nThe Virginia Rules of Evidence differ from the parallel federal rules in that a \" plea entered in a criminal case is admissible in a related civil proceeding.\nCommonwealth.\nIn the Commonwealth countries\u2014such as England and Wales, Scotland, Canada, and Australia\u2014the plea of \" is not permitted. The defendant must enter a plea of \"guilty\" or \"not guilty\". If a defendant refuses to enter a plea, the court will record a plea of \"not guilty\"."}

As a movement, it presupposes the existence and tends to promote the interests of a particular nation, especially with the aim of gaining and maintaining its sovereignty (self-determination) over its perceived homeland to create a nation-state. It holds that the nation should govern itself, free from outside interference (self-governance), that a nation is a natural and ideal basis for a polity, and that the nation is the only rightful source of political power. It further aims to build and maintain a single national identity, based on a combination of shared social characteristics such as culture, ethnicity, homeland, language, politics (or government), religion, traditions or belief in a shared singular history, and to promote national unity or solidarity. There are various definitions of a \"nation\", which leads to different types of nationalism. The two main divergent forms are ethnic nationalism and civic nationalism.\nThe moral value of nationalism, the relationship between nationalism and patriotism, and the compatibility of nationalism and cosmopolitanism are all subjects of philosophical debate. Nationalism can be combined with diverse political goals and ideologies such as conservatism (national conservatism and right-wing populism) or socialism (left-wing nationalism). \nNationalism is seen as positive or negative depending on its ideology and outcomes. Nationalism has been a feature of movements for freedom and justice, has been associated with cultural revivals, and encourages pride in national achievements. It has also been used to legitimize racial, ethnic, and religious divisions, suppress or attack minorities, undermine human rights and democratic traditions, and start wars, being frequently cited as a cause of both world wars.\nTerminology.\nThe terminological use of \"nations\", \"sovereignty\" and associated concepts was significantly refined with the writing by Hugo Grotius of \"De jure belli ac pacis\" in the early 17th century. Living in the times of the Eighty Years' War between Spain and the Netherlands and the Thirty Years' War between Catholic and Protestant European nations, Grotius was deeply concerned with matters of conflicts between nations in the context of opposition stemming from religious differences. The word \"nation\" was also applied before 1800 in Europe in reference to the inhabitants of a country as well as to collective identities that could include shared history, law, language, political rights, religion and traditions, in a sense more akin to the modern conception.\n\"Nationalism\" as derived from the noun designating 'nations' is a newer word; in the English language, dating to around 1798. The term gained wider prominence in the 19th century. The term increasingly became negative in its connotations after 1914. Glenda Sluga notes that \"The twentieth century, a time of profound disillusionment with nationalism, was also the great age of globalism.\"\nAcademics define nationalism as a political principle that holds that the nation and state should be congruent. According to Lisa Weeden, nationalist ideology presumes that \"the people\" and the state are congruent.\nHistory.\nBeginning in the late 18th century, particularly with the French Revolution and the spread of the principle of popular sovereignty or self determination, the idea that \"the people\" should rule was developed by political theorists. Three main theories have been used to explain the emergence of nationalism:\nIntellectual origins.\nAnthony D. Smith describes how intellectuals played a primary role in generating cultural perceptions of nationalism and providing the ideology of political nationalism:&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Wherever one turns in Europe, their seminal position in generating and analysing the concepts, myths, symbols and ideology of nationalism is apparent. This applies to the first appearance of the core doctrine and to the antecedent concepts of national character, genius of the nation and national will.\nSmith posits the challenges posed to traditional religion and society in the Age of Revolution propelled many intellectuals to \"discover alternative principles and concepts, and a new mythology and symbolism, to legitimate and ground human thought and action\". He discusses the simultaneous concept of 'historicism' to describe an emerging belief in the birth, growth, and decay of specific peoples and cultures, which became \"increasingly attractive as a framework for inquiry into the past and present and [...] an explanatory principle in elucidating the meaning of events, past and present\".\nThe Prussian scholar Johann Gottfried Herder (1744\u20131803) originated the term in 1772 in his \"Treatise on the Origin of Language\" stressing the role of a common language. He attached exceptional importance to the concepts of nationality and of patriotism \u00a0\u2013 \"he that has lost his patriotic spirit has lost himself and the whole world about himself\", whilst teaching that \"in a certain sense every human perfection is national\". Erica Benner identifies Herder as the first philosopher to explicitly suggest \"that identities based on language should be regarded as the primary source of legitimate political authority or locus of political resistance\". Herder also encouraged the creation of a common cultural and language policy amongst the separate German states.\nDating the emergence of nationalism.\nScholars frequently place the beginning of nationalism in the late 18th century or early 19th century with the American Declaration of Independence or with the French Revolution, though there is ongoing debate about its existence in varying forms during the Middle Ages and even antiquity. \nThe consensus is that nationalism as a concept was firmly established by the 19th century. In histories of nationalism, the French Revolution (1789) is seen as an important starting point, not only for its impact on French nationalism but even more for its impact on Germans and Italians and on European intellectuals. The template of nationalism, as a method for mobilizing public opinion around a new state based on popular sovereignty, went back further than 1789: philosophers such as Rousseau and Voltaire, whose ideas influenced the French Revolution, had themselves been influenced or encouraged by the example of earlier constitutionalist liberation movements, notably the Corsican Republic (1755\u20131768) and American Revolution (1775\u20131783).\nDue to the Industrial Revolution, there was an emergence of an integrated, nation-encompassing economy and a national public sphere, where British people began to mobilize on a state-wide scale, rather than just in the smaller units of their province, town or family. The early emergence of a popular patriotic nationalism took place in the mid-18th century and was actively promoted by the British government and by the writers and intellectuals of the time. National symbols, anthems, myths, flags and narratives were assiduously constructed by nationalists and widely adopted. The Union Jack was adopted in 1801 as the national flag. Thomas Arne composed the patriotic song \"Rule, Britannia!\" in 1740, and the cartoonist John Arbuthnot invented the character of John Bull as the personification of the English national spirit in 1712.\nThe political convulsions of the late 18th century associated with the American and French revolutions massively augmented the widespread appeal of patriotic nationalism. Napoleon Bonaparte's rise to power further established nationalism when he invaded much of Europe. Napoleon used this opportunity to spread revolutionary ideas, resulting in much of the 19th-century European Nationalism.\nSome scholars argue that variants of nationalism emerged prior to the 18th century. American philosopher and historian Hans Kohn wrote in 1944 that nationalism emerged in the 17th century. In \"\", Linda Colley explores how the role of nationalism emerged in about 1700 and developed in Britain reaching full form in the 1830s. Writing shortly after World War I, the popular British author H. G. Wells traced the origin of European nationalism to the aftermath of the Reformation, when it filled the moral void left by the decline of Christian faith:[A]s the idea of Christianity as a world brotherhood of men sank into discredit because of its fatal entanglement with priestcraft and the Papacy on the one hand and with the authority of princes on the other, and the age of faith passed into our present age of doubt and disbelief, men shifted the reference of their lives from the kingdom of God and the brotherhood of mankind to these apparently more living realities, France and England, Holy Russia, Spain, Prussia... **** In the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries the general population of Europe was religious and only vaguely patriotic; by the nineteenth it had become wholly patriotic.\n19th century.\nThe political development of nationalism and the push for popular sovereignty culminated with the ethnic/national revolutions of Europe and in the Ottoman Empire.\nDuring the 19th century nationalism became one of the most significant political and social forces in history; it is typically listed among the top causes of World War I.\nNapoleon's conquests of the German and Italian states around 1800\u20131806 played a major role in stimulating nationalism and the demands for national unity.\nEnglish historian J. P. T. Bury argues:\nBetween 1830 and 1870 nationalism had thus made great strides. It inspired great literature, quickened scholarship, and nurtured heroes. It had shown its power both to unify and to divide. It had led to great achievements of political construction and consolidation in Germany and Italy; but it was more clear than ever a threat to the Ottoman and Habsburg empires, which were essentially multi-national. European culture had been enriched by the new vernacular contributions of little-known or forgotten peoples, but at the same time such unity as it had was imperiled by fragmentation. Moreover, the antagonisms fostered by nationalism had made not only for wars, insurrections, and local hatreds\u2014they had accentuated or created new spiritual divisions in a nominally Christian Europe.\nFrance.\nNationalism in France gained early expressions in France's revolutionary government. In 1793, that government declared a mass conscription (\"lev\u00e9e en masse\") with a call to service:\nHenceforth, until the enemies have been driven from the territory of the Republic, all the French are in permanent requisition for army service. The young men shall go to battle; the married men shall forge arms in the hospitals; the children shall turn old linen to lint; the old men shall repair to the public places, to stimulate the courage of the warriors and preach the unity of the Republic and the hatred of kings.\nThis nationalism gained pace after the French Revolution came to a close. Defeat in war, with a loss in territory, was a powerful force in nationalism. In France, revenge and return of Alsace-Lorraine was a powerful motivating force for a quarter century after their defeat by Germany in 1871. After 1895, French nationalists focused on Dreyfus and internal subversion, and the Alsace issue petered out.\nThe French reaction was a famous case of \"Revanchism\" (\"revenge\") which demands the return of lost territory that \"belongs\" to the national homeland. Revanchism draws its strength from patriotic and retributionist thought and it is often motivated by economic or geo-political factors. Extreme revanchist ideologues often represent a hawkish stance, suggesting that their desired objectives can be achieved through the positive outcome of another war. It is linked with irredentism, the conception that a part of the cultural and ethnic nation remains \"unredeemed\" outside the borders of its appropriate nation state. Revanchist politics often rely on the identification of a nation with a nation state, often mobilizing deep-rooted sentiments of ethnic nationalism, claiming territories outside the state where members of the ethnic group live, while using heavy-handed nationalism to mobilize support for these aims. Revanchist justifications are often presented as based on ancient or even autochthonous occupation of a territory since \"time immemorial\", an assertion that is usually inextricably involved in revanchism and irredentism, justifying them in the eyes of their proponents.\nThe Dreyfus Affair in France 1894\u20131906 made the battle against treason and disloyalty a central theme for conservative Catholic French nationalists. Dreyfus, a Jew, was an outsider, that is in the views of intense nationalists, not a true Frenchman, not one to be trusted, not one to be given the benefit of the doubt. True loyalty to the nation, from the conservative viewpoint, was threatened by liberal and republican principles of liberty and equality that were leading the country to disaster.\nRussia.\nBefore 1815, the sense of Russian nationalism was weak\u2014what sense there was focused on loyalty and obedience to the tsar. The Russian motto \"Orthodoxy, Autocracy, and Nationality\" was coined by Count Sergey Uvarov and it was adopted by Emperor Nicholas I as the official ideology of the Russian Empire. Three components of Uvarov's triad were:\nBy the 1860s, as a result of educational indoctrination, and due to conservative resistance to ideas and ideologies which were transmitted from Western Europe, a pan-Slavic movement had emerged and it produced both a sense of Russian nationalism and a nationalistic mission to support and protect pan-Slavism. This Slavophile movement became popular in 19th-century Russia. Pan-Slavism was fueled by, and it was also the fuel for Russia's numerous wars against the Ottoman Empire which were waged in order to achieve the alleged goal of liberating Orthodox nationalities, such as Bulgarians, Romanians, Serbs and Greeks, from Ottoman rule. Slavophiles opposed the Western European influences which had been transmitted to Russia and they were also determined to protect Russian culture and traditions. Aleksey Khomyakov, Ivan Kireyevsky, and Konstantin Aksakov are credited with co-founding the movement.\nLatin America.\nAn upsurge in nationalism in Latin America in the 1810s and 1820s sparked revolutions that cost Spain nearly all of its colonies which were located there. Spain was at war with Britain from 1798 to 1808, and the British Royal Navy cut off its contacts with its colonies, so nationalism flourished and trade with Spain was suspended. The colonies set up temporary governments or juntas which were effectively independent from Spain. These juntas were established as a result of Napoleon's resistance failure in Spain. They served to determine new leadership and, in colonies like Caracas, abolished the slave trade as well as the Indian tribute. The division exploded between Spaniards who were born in Spain (called \"peninsulares\") versus those of Spanish descent born in New Spain (called \"criollos\" in Spanish or \"creoles\" in English). The two groups wrestled for power, with the criollos leading the call for independence. Spain tried to use its armies to fight back but had no help from European powers. Indeed, Britain and the United States worked against Spain, enforcing the Monroe Doctrine. Spain lost all of its American colonies, except Cuba and Puerto Rico, in a complex series of revolts from 1808 to 1826.\nGermany.\nIn the German states west of Prussia, Napoleon abolished many of the old or medieval relics, such as dissolving the Holy Roman Empire in 1806. He imposed rational legal systems and demonstrated how dramatic changes were possible. His organization of the Confederation of the Rhine in 1806 promoted a feeling of nationalism.\nNationalists sought to encompass masculinity in their quest for strength and unity. It was Prussian chancellor Otto von Bismarck who achieved German unification through a series of highly successful short wars against Denmark, Austria and France which thrilled the pan-German nationalists in the smaller German states. They fought in his wars and eagerly joined the new German Empire, which Bismarck ran as a force for balance and peace in Europe after 1871.\nIn the 19th century, German nationalism was promoted by Hegelian-oriented academic historians who saw Prussia as the true carrier of the German spirit, and the power of the state as the ultimate goal of nationalism. The three main historians were Johann Gustav Droysen (1808\u20131884), Heinrich von Sybel (1817\u20131895) and Heinrich von Treitschke (1834\u20131896). Droysen moved from liberalism to an intense nationalism that celebrated Prussian Protestantism, efficiency, progress, and reform, in striking contrast to Austrian Catholicism, impotency and backwardness. He idealized the Hohenzollern kings of Prussia. His large-scale \"History of Prussian Politics\" (14 vol 1855\u20131886) was foundational for nationalistic students and scholars. Von Sybel founded and edited the leading academic history journal, \"Historische Zeitschrift\" and as the director of the Prussian state archives published massive compilations that were devoured by scholars of nationalism.\nThe most influential of the German nationalist historians, was Treitschke who had an enormous influence on elite students at Heidelberg and Berlin universities. Treitschke vehemently attacked parliamentarianism, socialism, pacifism, the English, the French, the Jews, and the internationalists. The core of his message was the need for a strong, unified state\u2014a unified Germany under Prussian supervision. \"It is the highest duty of the State to increase its power,\" he stated. Although he was a descendant of a Czech family, he considered himself not Slavic but German: \"I am 1000 times more the patriot than a professor.\"\nGerman nationalism, expressed through the ideology of Nazism, may also be understood as trans-national in nature. This aspect was primarily advocated by Adolf Hitler, who later became the leader of the Nazi Party. This party was devoted to what they identified as an Aryan race, residing in various European countries, but sometime mixed with alien elements such as Jews.\nMeanwhile, the Nazis rejected many of the well-established citizens within those same countries, such as the Romani and Jews, whom they did not identify as Aryan. A key Nazi doctrine was (living space), which was a vast undertaking to transplant Aryans throughout Poland, much of Eastern Europe and the Baltic nations, and all of western Russia and Ukraine. was thus a vast project for advancing the Aryan race far outside of any particular nation or national borders. Nazi goals were focused on advancing the Aryan race as they perceived it, the modification of the human race via eugenics, and the eradication of human beings that they deemed inferior. But their goals were trans-national and intended to spread across as much of the world as they could achieve. Although Nazism glorified German history, it also embraced the supposed virtues and achievements of the Aryan race in other countries, including India. The Nazis' Aryanism longed for now-extinct species of superior bulls once used as livestock by Aryans and other features of Aryan history that never resided within the borders of Germany as a nation.\nItaly.\nItalian nationalism emerged in the 19th century and was the driving force for Italian unification or the \"Risorgimento\" (meaning the \"Resurgence\" or \"Revival\"). It was the political and intellectual movement that consolidated the different states of the Italian peninsula into the single state of the Kingdom of Italy in 1861. The memory of the \"Risorgimento\" is central to Italian nationalism but it was based in the liberal middle classes and ultimately proved a bit weak. The new government treated the newly annexed South as a kind of underdeveloped province due to its \"backward\" and poverty-stricken society, its poor grasp of standard Italian (as Italo-Dalmatian dialects of Neapolitan and Sicilian were prevalent in the common use) and its local traditions. The liberals had always been strong opponents of the pope and the very well organized Catholic Church. The liberal government under the Sicilian Francesco Crispi sought to enlarge his political base by emulating Otto von Bismarck and firing up Italian nationalism with an aggressive foreign policy. It partially crashed and his cause was set back. Of his nationalistic foreign policy, historian R. J. B. Bosworth says:\n[Crispi] pursued policies whose openly aggressive character would not be equaled until the days of the Fascist regime. Crispi increased military expenditure, talked cheerfully of a European conflagration, and alarmed his German or British friends with these suggestions of preventative attacks on his enemies. His policies were ruinous, both for Italy's trade with France, and, more humiliatingly, for colonial ambitions in East Africa. Crispi's lust for territory there was thwarted when on 1 March 1896, the armies of Ethiopian Emperor Menelik routed Italian forces at Adowa [...] in what has been defined as an unparalleled disaster for a modern army. Crispi, whose private life and personal finances [...] were objects of perennial scandal, went into dishonorable retirement.\nItaly joined the Allies in the First World War after getting promises of territory, but its war effort was not honored after the war and this fact discredited liberalism paving the way for Benito Mussolini and a political doctrine of his own creation, Fascism. Mussolini's 20-year dictatorship involved a highly aggressive nationalism that led to a series of wars with the creation of the Italian Empire, an alliance with Hitler's Germany, and humiliation and hardship in the Second World War. After 1945, the Catholics returned to government and tensions eased somewhat, but the former two Sicilies remained poor and partially underdeveloped (by industrial country standards). In the 1950s and early 1960s, Italy had an economic boom that pushed its economy to the fifth place in the world.\nThe working class in those decades voted mostly for the Communist Party, and it looked to Moscow rather than Rome for inspiration and was kept out of the national government even as it controlled some industrial cities across the North. In the 21st century, the Communists have become marginal but political tensions remained high as shown by Umberto Bossi's Padanism in the 1980s (whose party Lega Nord has come to partially embrace a moderate version of Italian nationalism over the years) and other separatist movements spread across the country.\nSpain.\nAfter the War of the Spanish Succession, rooted in the political position of the Count-Duke of Olivares and the absolutism of Philip V, the assimilation of the Crown of Aragon by the Castilian Crown through the Decrees of Nova planta was the first step in the creation of the Spanish nation-state. As in other contemporary European states, political union was the first step in the creation of the Spanish nation-state, in this case not on a uniform ethnic basis, but through the imposition of the political and cultural characteristics of the dominant ethnic group, in this case the Castilians, over those of other ethnic groups, who became national minorities to be assimilated. In fact, since the political unification of 1714, Spanish assimilation policies towards Catalan-speaking territories (Catalonia, Valencia, the Balearic Islands, part of Aragon) and other national minorities, as Basques and Galicians, have been a historical constant.\nThe nationalization process accelerated in the 19th century, in parallel to the origin of Spanish nationalism, the social, political and ideological movement that tried to shape a Spanish national identity based on the Castilian model, in conflict with the other historical nations of the State. Politicians of the time were aware that despite the aggressive policies pursued up to that time, the uniform and monocultural \"Spanish nation\" did not exist, as indicated in 1835 by Antonio Alcal\u00e0 Galiano, when in the Cortes del Estatuto Real he defended the effort:\"To make the Spanish nation a nation that neither is nor has been until now.\"Building the nation (as in France, it was the state that created the nation, and not the opposite process) is an ideal that the Spanish elites constantly reiterated, and, one hundred years later than Alcal\u00e1 Galiano, for example, we can also find it in the mouth of the fascist Jos\u00e9 Pemart\u00edn, who admired the German and Italian modeling policies:\"There is an intimate and decisive dualism, both in Italian fascism and in German National Socialism. On the one hand, the Hegelian doctrine of the absolutism of the state is felt. The State originates in the Nation, educates and shapes the mentality of the individual; is, in Mussolini's words, the soul of the soul.\"And will be found again two hundred years later, from the socialist Josep Borrell:\"The modern history of Spain is an unfortunate history that meant that we did not consolidate a modern State. Independentists think that the nation makes the State. I think the opposite. The State makes the nation. A strong State, which imposes its language, culture, education.\"The creation of the tradition of the political community of Spaniards as common destiny over other communities has been argued to trace back to the Cortes of C\u00e1diz. From 1812 on, revisiting the previous history of Spain, Spanish liberalism tended to take for granted the national conscience and the Spanish nation.\nA by-product of 19th-century Spanish nationalist thinking is the concept of \"Reconquista\", which holds the power of propelling the weaponized notion of Spain being a nation shaped against Islam. The strong interface of nationalism with colonialism is another feature of 19th-century nation building in Spain, with the defence of slavery and colonialism in Cuba being often able to reconcile tensions between mainland elites of Catalonia and Madrid throughout the period.\nDuring the first half of 20th century (notably during the dictatorship of Primo de Rivera and the dictatorship of Franco), a new brand of Spanish nationalism with a marked military flavour and an authoritarian stance (as well as promoting policies favouring the Spanish language against the other languages in the country) as a means of modernizing the country was developed by Spanish conservatives, fusing regenerationist principles with traditional Spanish nationalism. The authoritarian national ideal resumed during the Francoist dictatorship, in the form of National-Catholicism, which was in turn complemented by the myth of Hispanidad. \nA distinct manifestation of Spanish nationalism in modern Spanish politics is the interchange of attacks with competing regional nationalisms. Initially present after the end of Francoism in a rather diffuse and reactive form, the Spanish nationalist discourse has been often self-branded as \"constitutional patriotism\" since the 1980s. Often ignored as in the case of other State nationalisms, its alleged \"non-existence\" has been a commonplace espoused by prominent figures in the public sphere as well as the mass-media in the country.\nGreece.\nDuring the early 19th century, inspired by romanticism, classicism, former movements of Greek nationalism and failed Greek revolts against the Ottoman Empire (such as the Orlofika revolt in southern Greece in 1770, and the Epirus-Macedonian revolt of Northern Greece in 1575), Greek nationalism led to the Greek war of independence. The Greek drive for independence from the Ottoman Empire in the 1820s and 1830s inspired supporters across Christian Europe, especially in Britain, which was the result of western idealization of Classical Greece and romanticism. France, Russia and Britain critically intervened to ensure the success of this nationalist endeavor.\nSerbia.\nFor centuries the Orthodox Christian Serbs were ruled by the Muslim Ottoman Empire. The success of the Serbian Revolution against Ottoman rule in 1817 marked the birth of the Principality of Serbia. It achieved \"de facto\" independence in 1867 and finally gained international recognition in 1878. Serbia had sought to liberate and unite with Bosnia and Herzegovina to the west and Old Serbia (Kosovo and Vardar Macedonia) to the south. Nationalist circles in both Serbia and Croatia (part of Austria-Hungary) began to advocate for a greater South Slavic union in the 1860s, claiming Bosnia as their common land based on shared language and tradition. In 1914, Serb revolutionaries in Bosnia assassinated Archduke Ferdinand. Austria-Hungary, with German backing, tried to crush Serbia in 1914, thus igniting the First World War in which Austria-Hungary dissolved into nation states.\nIn 1918, the region of Banat, Ba\u010dka and Baranja came under control of the Serbian army, later the Great National Assembly of Serbs, Bunjevci and other Slavs voted to join Serbia; the Kingdom of Serbia joined the union with State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs on 1 December 1918, and the country was named Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes. It was renamed Yugoslavia in 1929, and a Yugoslav identity was promoted, which ultimately failed. After the Second World War, Yugoslav Communists established a new socialist republic of Yugoslavia. That state broke up again in the 1990s.\nPoland.\nThe cause of Polish nationalism was repeatedly frustrated before 1918. In the 1790s, the Habsburg monarchy, Prussia and Russia\ninvaded, annexed, and subsequently partitioned Poland. Napoleon set up the Duchy of Warsaw, a new Polish state that ignited a spirit of nationalism. Russia took it over in 1815 as Congress Poland with the tsar proclaimed as \"King of Poland\". Large-scale nationalist revolts erupted in 1830 and 1863\u201364 but were harshly crushed by Russia, which tried to make the Polish language, culture and religion more like Russia's. The collapse of the Russian Empire in the First World War enabled the major powers to re-establish an independent Poland, which survived until 1939. Meanwhile, Poles in areas controlled by Germany moved into heavy industry but their religion came under attack by Bismarck in the Kulturkampf of the 1870s. The Poles joined German Catholics in a well-organized new Centre Party, and defeated Bismarck politically. He responded by stopping the harassment and cooperating with the Centre Party.\nIn the late 19th and early 20th century, many Polish nationalist leaders endorsed the Piast Concept. It held there was a Polish utopia during the Piast Dynasty a thousand years before, and modern Polish nationalists should restore its central values of Poland for the Poles. Jan Poplawski had developed the \"Piast Concept\" in the 1890s, and it formed the centerpiece of Polish nationalist ideology, especially as presented by the National Democracy Party, known as the \"Endecja,\" which was led by Roman Dmowski. In contrast with the Jagiellon concept, there was no concept for a multi-ethnic Poland.\nThe Piast concept stood in opposition to the \"Jagiellon Concept,\" which allowed for multi-ethnicism and Polish rule over numerous minority groups such as those in the Kresy. The Jagiellon Concept was the official policy of the government in the 1920s and 1930s. Soviet dictator Josef Stalin at Tehran in 1943 rejected the Jagiellon Concept because it involved Polish rule over Ukrainians and Belarusians. He instead endorsed the Piast Concept, which justified a massive shift of Poland's frontiers to the west. After 1945 the Soviet-back puppet communist regime wholeheartedly adopted the Piast Concept, making it the centerpiece of their claim to be the \"true inheritors of Polish nationalism\". After all the killings, including Nazi German occupation, terror in Poland and population transfers during and after the war, the nation was officially declared as 99% ethnically Polish.\nIn current Polish politics, Polish nationalism is most openly represented by parties linked in the Liberty and Independence Confederation coalition. As of 2020 the Confederation, composed of several smaller parties, had 11 deputies (under 7%) in the Sejm.\nBulgaria.\nBulgarian modern nationalism emerged under Ottoman rule in the late 18th and early 19th century, under the influence of western ideas such as liberalism and nationalism, which trickled into the country after the French Revolution.\nThe Bulgarian national revival started with the work of Saint Paisius of Hilendar, who opposed Greek domination of Bulgaria's culture and religion. His work \"Istoriya Slavyanobolgarskaya\" (\"History of the Slav-Bulgarians\"), which appeared in 1762, was the first work of Bulgarian historiography. It is considered Paisius' greatest work and one of the greatest pieces of Bulgarian literature. In it, Paisius interpreted Bulgarian medieval history with the goal of reviving the spirit of his nation.\nHis successor was Saint Sophronius of Vratsa, who started the struggle for an independent Bulgarian church. An autonomous Bulgarian Exarchate was established in 1870/1872 for the Bulgarian diocese wherein at least two-thirds of Orthodox Christians were willing to join it.\nIn 1869 the Internal Revolutionary Organization was initiated.\nThe April Uprising of 1876 indirectly resulted in the re-establishment of Bulgaria in 1878.\nJewish nationalism.\nAntisemitism has been a problem since the middle ages, however, it became more prevalent as the percent of the population that was Jewish increased in western countries. Increased antisemitism would lead to further exclusion and discrimination. In the 19th century, Jews in Western Europe saw increased access to civil rights and liberties. Among these were the right to vote, hold office, own land, and serve in the armed forces. Meanwhile, Jews in Eastern Europe often faced mass persecution, particularly in Russian Empire. Anti-Jewish riots, referred to as Pogroms, triggered mass emigration of Jews, who fled to America and Western Europe. At the dawn of the 20th century antisemitism would become an increasing problem in the West as well, as more Jews immigrated to the West. \nWhile a majority of Jews wanted to continue integrating into western society, some felt that Jews should return to the biblical promise land of Palestine. These Jews, later known as Zionists, believed that antisemitism was an existential and permanent threat to Judaism and that a Jewish state was the only solution. Jewish settlement of Palestine occurred in waves, with Jews from both Western and Eastern Europe settling in the area starting after 1882.\nHowever, as the Jews arrived, there were still many discrepancies in beliefs that had to be rectified to ensure a concise national identity. Political theorists state that there are four key elements necessary for a group to suffice as a nationality; a shared territory, a shared culture, a shared economy, and a shared language. Many of these attributes were heavily debated as Zionism increased in popularity. The official language of Israel was originally debated between Hebrew and Yiddish. However, many Eastern European Jews had already begun teaching Hebrew as the official language of Israel and completely rejected Yiddish. Eventually Hebrew would become the official language of the state of Israel. While some Jews had begun settling in Palestine, they had not officially claimed the territory as their own as it remained in possession of the British Mandate. Furthermore, some Zionists debated the exact location of a potential Jewish state, with many possible locations being proposed. In 1948, Israel was officially declared and recognized as the official Jewish state, solving the territorial question. From the beginning the economic question was brought into play as labour zionists hoped to create a socialist state, while religious zionists came to Israel for varying reasons and with holding different economic beliefs. In the early 20th century the Jewish socialist movement of Bundism sought to increase the number of Jews speaking Yiddish, on top of pursuing Marxist economics, across Europe. However, the movement would dissipate after World War 2 as the Nazis targeted and murdered Bundists. After Israel's founding in 1948, it was uncertain where they would side in the cold war, with both the United States and the USSR supporting Israel. Meanwhile right-wing revisionists had gained mainstream attraction in opposition to the socialist movements that were predominant in the early years of the Zionist state. By the 1960s, the USSR had cut off relations with Israel who had begun liberalizing their economy. Thus, Israel finally achieved a shared language, economy, culture, and territory, allowing for Jewish nationalism to be achieved.\n20th century.\nChina.\nThe awakening of nationalism across Asia helped shape the history of the continent. The key episode was the decisive defeat of Russia by Japan in 1905, demonstrating the military advancement of non-Europeans in a modern war. The defeat quickly led to manifestations of a new interest in nationalism in China, as well as Turkey and Persia. In China Sun Yat-sen (1866\u20131925) launched his new party the Kuomintang (National People's Party) in defiance of the decrepit Empire, which was run by outsiders. The Kuomintang recruits pledged:\n[F]rom this moment I will destroy the old and build the new, and fight for the self-determination of the people, and will apply all my strength to the support of the Chinese Republic and the realization of democracy through the Three Principles, ... for the progress of good government, the happiness and perpetual peace of the people, and for the strengthening of the foundations of the state in the name of peace throughout the world.\nThe Kuomintang largely ran China until the Communists took over in 1949. But the latter had also been strongly influenced by Sun's nationalism as well as by the May Fourth Movement in 1919. It was a nationwide protest movement about the domestic backwardness of China and has often been depicted as the intellectual foundation for Chinese Communism. The New Culture Movement stimulated by the May Fourth Movement waxed strong throughout the 1920s and 1930s. Historian Patricia Ebrey says:\nNationalism, patriotism, progress, science, democracy, and freedom were the goals; imperialism, feudalism, warlordism, autocracy, patriarchy, and blind adherence to tradition were the enemies. Intellectuals struggled with how to be strong and modern and yet Chinese, how to preserve China as a political entity in the world of competing nations.\nIn 1911, following the Xinhai Revolution, Sun's multicultural form of Chinese nationalism manifested as Zhonghua minzu, a concept that promoted the idea of Five Races Under One Union, that sidelined Han Chinese supremacy in favor of coexistence alongside Manchus, Mongols, Chinese Muslims (Hui/Uyghurs), and Tibetans, all of which were supposedly equal branches of the Chinese nation.19 The rhetorical move, as China historian Joseph Esherick points out, was based on practical concerns about imperial threats from the international environment and conflicts on the Chinese frontiers.\nGreece.\nNationalist irredentist movements Greek advocating for Enosis (unity of ethnically Greek states with the Hellenic Republic to create a unified Greek state), used today in the case of Cyprus, as well as the Megali Idea, the Greek movement that advocated for the reconquering of Greek ancestral lands from the Ottoman Empire (such as Crete, Ionia, Pontus, Northern Epirus, Cappadocia, Thrace among others) that were popular in the late 19th and early to 20th centuries, led to many Greek states and regions that were ethnically Greek to eventually unite with Greece and the Greco-Turkish war of 1919.\nThe 4th of August regime was a fascist or fascistic nationalist authoritarian dictatorship inspired by Mussolini's Fascist Italy and Hitler's Germany and led by Greek general Ioannis Metaxas from 1936 to his death in 1941. It advocated for the Third Hellenic Civilization, a culturally superior Greek civilization that would be the successor of the First and Second Greek civilizations, that were Ancient Greece and the Byzantine empire respectively. It promoted Greek traditions, folk music and dances, classicism as well as medievalism.\nAfrica.\nIn the 1880s the European powers divided up almost all of Africa (only Ethiopia and Liberia were independent). They ruled until after World War II when forces of nationalism grew much stronger. In the 1950s and the 1960s, colonial holdings became independent states. The process was usually peaceful but there were several long bitter bloody civil wars, as in Algeria, Kenya and elsewhere.\nAcross Africa, nationalism drew upon the organizational skills that natives had learned in the British and French, and other armies during the world wars. It led to organizations that were not controlled by or endorsed by either the colonial powers or the traditional local power structures that had been collaborating with the colonial powers. Nationalistic organizations began to challenge both the traditional and the new colonial structures and finally displaced them. Leaders of nationalist movements took control when the European authorities exited; many ruled for decades or until they died off. These structures included political, educational, religious, and other social organizations. In recent decades, many African countries have undergone the triumph and defeat of nationalistic fervor, changing in the process the loci of the centralizing state power and patrimonial state.\nSouth Africa, a British colony, was exceptional in that it became virtually independent by 1931. From 1948, it was controlled by white Afrikaner nationalists, who focused on racial segregation and white minority rule, known as apartheid. It lasted until 1994, when multiracial elections were held. The international anti-apartheid movement supported black nationalists until success was achieved, and Nelson Mandela was elected president.\nMiddle East.\nArab nationalism, a movement toward liberating and empowering the Arab peoples of the Middle East, emerged during the late 19th century, inspired by other independence movements of the 18th and 19th centuries. As the Ottoman Empire declined and the Middle East was carved up by the Great Powers of Europe, Arabs sought to establish their own independent nations ruled by Arabs, rather than foreigners. Syria was established in 1920; Transjordan (later Jordan) gradually gained independence between 1921 and 1946; Saudi Arabia was established in 1932; and Egypt achieved gradually gained independence between 1922 and 1952. The Arab League was established in 1945 to promote Arab interests and cooperation between the new Arab states.\nThe Zionist movement, emerged among European Jews in the 19th century. In 1882, Jews, from Europe, began to emigrate to Ottoman Palestine with the goal of establishing a new Jewish homeland. The majority and local population in Palestine, Palestinian Arabs were demanding independence from the British Mandate.\nBreakup of Yugoslavia.\nThere was a rise in extreme nationalism after the Revolutions of 1989 had triggered the collapse of communism in the 1990s. That left many people with no identity. The people under communist rule had to integrate, but they now found themselves free to choose. That made long-dormant conflicts rise and create sources of serious conflict. When communism fell in Yugoslavia, serious conflict arose, which led to a rise in extreme nationalism.\nThe academic Steven Berg felt that the root of nationalist conflicts was the demand for autonomy and a separate existence. That nationalism can give rise to strong emotions, which may lead to a group fighting to survive, especially as after the fall of communism, political boundaries did not match ethnic boundaries. Serious conflicts often arose and escalated very easily, as individuals and groups acted upon their beliefs and caused death and destruction.\n21st century.\nThe rise of globalism in the late 20th century led to a rise in nationalism and populism in Europe and North America. That trend was further fueled by increased terrorism in the West (the September 11 attacks in the United States being a prime example), increasing unrest and civil wars in the Middle East, and waves of Muslim refugees, especially from the Syrian Civil War, flooding into Europe (as of 2016[ [update]] the refugee crisis appears to have peaked). Nationalist groups like Germany's Pegida, France's National Front and the UK Independence Party gained prominence in their respective nations advocating restrictions on immigration to protect the local populations.\nSince 2010, Catalan nationalists have led a renewed Catalan independence movement and declared Catalan independence. The movement has been opposed by Spanish nationalists. In the 2010s, the Greek economic crisis and waves of immigration have led to a significant rise of Fascism and Greek nationalism across Greece, especially among the youth.\nIn Russia, exploitation of nationalist sentiments allowed Vladimir Putin to consolidate power. This nationalist sentiment was used in Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014 and other actions in Ukraine. Nationalist movements gradually began to rise in Central Europe as well, particularly Poland, under the influence of the ruling party, Law and Justice (led by Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski). In Hungary, the anti-immigration rhetoric and stance against foreign influence is a powerful national glue promoted the ruling Fidesz party (led by Viktor Orb\u00e1n). Nationalist parties have also joined governing coalitions in Bulgaria, Slovakia, Latvia and Ukraine.\nIn India, Hindu nationalism has grown in popularity with the rise of the Bharatiya Janata Party, a right-wing party which has been ruling India at the national level since 2014. The rise in religious nationalism comes with the rise of right-wing populism in India, with the election and re-election of populist leader Narendra Modi as Prime Minister, who promised economic prosperity for all and an end to corruption. Militant Buddhist nationalism is also on the rise in Myanmar, Thailand and Sri Lanka.\nIn Japan, nationalist influences in the government developed over the course of the early 21st century, largely from the far right ultra-conservative Nippon Kaigi organization. The new movement has advocated re-establishing Japan as a military power and pushed revisionist historical narratives denying events such as the Nanking Massacre.\nA referendum on Scottish independence from the United Kingdom was held on 18 September 2014. The proposal was defeated, with 55.3% voting against independence. In a 2016 referendum, the British populace unexpectedly voted to withdraw the United Kingdom from the European Union (known as \"Brexit\"). As the promise of continued European Union membership was a core feature of the anti-independence campaign during the Scottish referendum, there have been calls for a second referendum on Scottish independence.\nThe 2016 United States presidential campaign saw the unprecedented rise of Donald Trump, a businessman with no political experience who ran on a populist/nationalist platform and struggled to gain endorsements from mainstream political figures, even within his own party. Trump's slogans \"\"Make America Great Again\" and \"America First\"\" exemplified his campaign's repudiation of globalism and its staunchly nationalistic outlook. His unexpected victory in the election was seen as part of the same trend that had brought about the Brexit vote. On 22 October 2018, two weeks before the mid-term elections President Trump openly proclaimed that he was a nationalist to a cheering crowd at a rally in Texas in support of re-electing Senator Ted Cruz who was once an adversary. On 29 October 2018 Trump equated nationalism to patriotism, saying \"I'm proud of this country and I call that \"nationalism.\"\nIn 2016, Rodrigo Duterte became president of the Philippines running a distinctly nationalist campaign. Contrary to the policies of his recent predecessors, he distanced the country from the Philippines' former ruler, the United States, and sought closer ties with China (as well as Russia).\nIn 2017, Turkish nationalism propelled President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan to gain unprecedented power in a national referendum. Reactions from world leaders were mixed, with Western European leaders generally expressing concern while the leaders of many of the more authoritarian regimes as well as President Trump offered their congratulations.\nPolitical science.\nMany political scientists have theorized about the foundations of the modern nation-state and the concept of sovereignty. The concept of nationalism in political science draws from these theoretical foundations. Philosophers like Machiavelli, Locke, Hobbes, and Rousseau conceptualized the state as the result of a \"social contract\" between rulers and individuals. Max Weber provides the most commonly used definition of the state, \"that human community which successfully lays claim to the monopoly of legitimate physical violence within a certain territory\". According to Benedict Anderson, nations are \"Imagined Communities\", or socially constructed institutions.\nMany scholars have noted the relationship between state-building, war, and nationalism. John Etherington argues nationalism is inherently exclusionary and thus potentially violent, while Jeffrey Herbst posits that external threats can foster nationalist sentiment: \"External threats have such a powerful effect on nationalism because people realize in a profound manner that they are under threat because of who they are as a nation; they are forced to recognize that it is only as a nation that they can successfully defeat the threat\". With increased external threats, the state's extractive capacities increase. He links the lack of external threats to countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, post-independence, to weak state nationalism and state capacity. Barry Posen argues that nationalism increases the intensity of war, and that states deliberately promote nationalism with the aim of improving their military capabilities. Most new nation-states since 1815 have emerged through decolonization.\nAdria Lawrence has argued that nationalism in the colonial world was spurred by failures of colonial powers to extend equal political rights to the subjects in the colonies, thus prompting them to pursue independence. Michael Hechter has argued similarly that \"peripheral nationalisms\" formed when empires prevented peripheral regions from having autonomy and local rule.\nSociology.\nThe sociological or modernist interpretation of nationalism and nation-building argues that nationalism arises and flourishes in modern societies that have an industrial economy capable of self-sustainability, a central supreme authority capable of maintaining authority and unity, and a centralized language understood by a community of people. Modernist theorists note that this is only possible in modern societies, while traditional societies typically lack the prerequisites for nationalism. They lack a modern self-sustainable economy, have divided authorities, and use multiple languages resulting in many groups being unable to communicate with each other.\nProminent theorists who developed the modernist interpretation of nations and nationalism include: Carlton J. H. Hayes, Henry Maine, Ferdinand T\u00f6nnies, Rabindranath Tagore, \u00c9mile Durkheim, Max Weber, Arnold Joseph Toynbee and Talcott Parsons.\nIn his analysis of the historical changes and development of human societies, Henry Maine noted that the key distinction between traditional societies defined as \"status\" societies based on family association and functionally diffuse roles for individuals and modern societies defined as \"contract\" societies where social relations are determined by rational contracts pursued by individuals to advance their interests. Maine saw the development of societies as moving away from traditional status societies to modern contract societies.\nIn his book \"Gemeinschaft und Gesellschaft\" (1887), Ferdinand T\u00f6nnies defined a \"Gemeinschaft\" (\"community\") as being based on emotional attachments as attributed with traditional societies while defining a \"Gesellschaft\" (\"society\") as an impersonal society that is modern. Although he recognized the advantages of modern societies, he also criticized them for their cold and impersonal nature that caused alienation while praising the intimacy of traditional communities.\n\u00c9mile Durkheim expanded upon T\u00f6nnies' recognition of alienation and defined the differences between traditional and modern societies as being between societies based upon \"mechanical solidarity\" versus societies based on \"organic solidarity\". Durkheim identified mechanical solidarity as involving custom, habit, and repression that was necessary to maintain shared views. Durkheim identified organic solidarity-based societies as modern societies where there exists a division of labour based on social differentiation that causes alienation. Durkheim claimed that social integration in traditional society required authoritarian culture involving acceptance of a social order. Durkheim claimed that modern society bases integration on the mutual benefits of the division of labour, but noted that the impersonal character of modern urban life caused alienation and feelings of anomie.\nMax Weber claimed the change that developed modern society and nations is the result of the rise of a charismatic leader to power in a society who creates a new tradition or a rational-legal system that establishes the supreme authority of the state. Weber's conception of charismatic authority has been noted as the basis of many nationalist governments.\nPrimordialist evolutionary interpretation.\nThe primordialist perspective is based upon evolutionary theory. This approach has been popular with the general public but is typically rejected by experts. Laland and Brown report that \"the vast majority of professional academics in the social sciences not only ... ignore evolutionary methods but in many cases [are] extremely hostile to the arguments\" that draw vast generalizations from rather limited evidence.\nThe evolutionary theory of nationalism perceives nationalism to be the result of the evolution of human beings into identifying with groups, such as ethnic groups, or other groups that form the foundation of a nation. Roger Masters in \"The Nature of Politics\" describes the primordial explanation of the origin of ethnic and national groups as recognizing group attachments that are thought to be unique, emotional, intense, and durable because they are based upon kinship and promoted along lines of common ancestry.\nThe primordialist evolutionary views of nationalism often reference the evolutionary theories of Charles Darwin as well as Social Darwinist views of the late nineteenth century. Thinkers like Herbert Spencer and Walter Bagehot reinterpreted Darwin's theory of natural selection \"often in ways inconsistent with Charles Darwin's theory of evolution\" by making unsupported claims of biological difference among groups, ethnicities, races, and nations. Modern evolutionary sciences have distanced themselves from such views, but notions of long-term evolutionary change remain foundational to the work of evolutionary psychologists like John Tooby and Leda Cosmides.\nApproached through the primordialist perspective, the example of seeing the mobilization of a foreign military force on the nation's borders may provoke members of a national group to unify and mobilize themselves in response. There are proximate environments where individuals identify nonimmediate real or imagined situations in combination with immediate situations that make individuals confront a common situation of both subjective and objective components that affect their decisions. As such proximate environments cause people to make decisions based on existing situations and anticipated situations.\nCritics argue that primordial models relying on evolutionary psychology are based not on historical evidence but on assumptions of unobserved changes over thousands of years and assume stable genetic composition of the population living in a specific area and are incapable of handling the contingencies that characterize every known historical process. Robert Hislope argues:\n[T]he articulation of cultural evolutionary theory represents theoretical progress over sociobiology, but its explanatory payoff remains limited due to the role of contingency in human affairs and the significance of non-evolutionary, proximate causal factors. While evolutionary theory undoubtedly elucidates the development of all organic life, it would seem to operate best at macro-levels of analysis, \"distal\" points of explanation, and from the perspective of the long-term. Hence, it is bound to display shortcomings at micro-level events that are highly contingent in nature.\nIn 1920, English historian G. P. Gooch argued that \"[while patriotism is as old as human association and has gradually widened its sphere from the clan and the tribe to the city and the state, nationalism as an operative principle and an articulate creed only made its appearance among the more complicated intellectual processes of the modern world.\"\nMarxist interpretations.\nIn \"The Communist Manifesto\", Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels declared that \"the working men have no country\". Vladimir Lenin supported the concept of self-determination. Joseph Stalin's \"Marxism and the National Question\" (1913) declares that \"a nation is not a racial or tribal, but a historically constituted community of people;\" \"a nation is not a casual or ephemeral conglomeration, but a stable community of people\"; \"a nation is formed only as a result of lengthy and systematic intercourse, as a result of people living together generation after generation\"; and, in its entirety: \"a nation is a historically constituted, stable community of people, formed on the basis of a common language, territory, economic life, and psychological make-up manifested in a common culture.\"\nTypes.\nHistorians, sociologists and anthropologists have debated different types of nationalism since at least the 1930s. Generally, the most common way of classifying nationalism has been to describe movements as having either \"civic\" or \"ethnic\" nationalist characteristics. This distinction was popularized in the 1950s by Hans Kohn who described \"civic\" nationalism as \"Western\" and more democratic while depicting \"ethnic\" nationalism as \"Eastern\" and undemocratic. Since the 1980s, scholars of nationalism have pointed out numerous flaws in this rigid division and proposed more specific classifications and numerous varieties.\nAnti-colonial.\nAnti-colonial nationalism is an intellectual framework that preceded, accompanied and followed the process of decolonization in the mid-1900s. Benedict Anderson defined a nation as a socially constructed community that is co-created by individuals who imagine themselves as part of this group. He points to the New World as the site that originally conceived of nationalism as a concept, which is defined by its imagination of an ahistorical identity that negates colonialism by definition. This concept of nationalism was exemplified by the transformation of settler colonies into nations, while anti-colonial nationalism is exemplified by movements against colonial powers in the 1900s.\nNationalist mobilization in French colonial Africa and British colonial India developed \"when colonial regimes refused to cede rights to their increasingly well-educated colonial subjects\", who formed indigenous elites and strategically adopted and adapted nationalist tactics. New national identities may cross pre-existing ethnic or linguistic divisions. Anti-colonial independence movements in Africa and Asia in the 1900s were led by individuals who had a set of shared identities and imagined a homeland without external rule. Anderson argues that the racism often experienced as a result of colonial rule and attributed to nationalism is rather due to theories of class.\nGellner's theory of nationalism argues that nationalism works for combining one culture or ethnicity in one state, which leads to that state's success. For Gellner, nationalism is ethnic, and state political parties should reflect the ethnic majority in the state. This definition of nationalism also contributes to anti-colonial nationalism, if one conceives of anti-colonial movements to be movements consisting of one specific ethnic group against an outside ruling party. Edward Said also saw nationalism as ethnic, at least in part, and argued that nationalist narratives often go hand in hand with racism, as communities define themselves in relation to the other.\nAnti-colonial nationalism is not static and is defined by different forms of nationalism depending on location. In the anti-colonial movement that took place in the Indian subcontinent, Mahatma Gandhi and his allies in the Indian independence movement argued for a composite nationalism, not believing that an independent Indian nation should be defined by its religious identity. Despite large-scale opposition by the Indian National Congress supporters, the insistence of the Muslims under the separatist Muslim League resulted in the Indian subcontinent being partitioned into two states in 1947 along religious lines into the Muslim-majority Dominion of Pakistan and the Hindu-majority Dominion of India.\nBecause of colonialism's creation of state and country lines across ethnic, religious, linguistic and other historical boundaries, anti-colonial nationalism is largely related to land first. After independence, especially in countries with particularly diverse populations with historic enmity, there have been a series of smaller independence movements that are also defined by anti-colonialism.\nPhilosopher and scholar Achille Mbembe argues that post-colonialism is a contradictory term, because colonialism is ever present. Those that participate in this intellectual practice envision a post-colonialism despite its being the defining frame for the world. This is the case with anti-colonialism as well. Anti-colonial nationalism as an intellectual framework persisted into the late 20th century with the resistance movements in Soviet satellite states and continues with independence movements in the Arab world in the 21st century.\nCivic and liberal.\nCivic nationalism defines the nation as an association of people who identify themselves as belonging to the nation, who have equal and shared political rights, and allegiance to similar political procedures. According to the principles of civic nationalism, the nation is not based on common ethnic ancestry, but is a political entity whose core identity is not ethnicity. This civic concept of nationalism is exemplified by Ernest Renan in his lecture in 1882 \"What is a Nation?\", where he defined the nation as a \"daily referendum\" (frequently translated \"daily plebiscite\") dependent on the will of its people to continue living together.\nCivic nationalism is normally associated with liberal nationalism, although the two are distinct, and did not always coincide. On the one hand, until the late 19th and early 20th century adherents to anti-Enlightenment movements such as French Legitimism or Spanish Carlism often rejected the liberal, national unitary state, yet identified themselves not with an ethnic nation but with a non-national dynasty and regional feudal privileges. Xenophobic movements in long-established Western European states indeed often took a 'civic national' form, rejecting a given group's ability to assimilate with the nation due to its belonging to a cross-border community (Irish Catholics in Britain, Ashkenazic Jews in France). On the other hand, while subnational separatist movements were commonly associated with ethnic nationalism, this was not always so, and such nationalists as the Corsican Republic, United Irishmen, Breton Federalist League or Catalan Republican Party could combine a rejection of the unitary civic-national state with a belief in liberal universalism.\nLiberal nationalism is commonly considered to be compatible with liberal values of freedom, tolerance, equality, and individual rights. Ernest Renan and John Stuart Mill are often thought to be early liberal nationalists. Liberal nationalists often defend the value of national identity by saying that individuals need a national identity to lead meaningful, autonomous lives, and that liberal democratic polities need national identity to function properly.\nCivic nationalism lies within the traditions of rationalism and liberalism, but as a form of nationalism it is usually contrasted with ethnic nationalism. Civic nationalism is correlated with long-established states whose dynastic rulers had gradually acquired multiple distinct territories, with little change to boundaries, but which contained historical populations of multiple linguistic and/or confessional backgrounds. Since individuals living within different parts of the state territory might have little obvious common ground, civic nationalism developed as a way for rulers to both explain a contemporary reason for such heterogeneity and to provide a common purpose (Ernest Renan's classic description in What is a Nation? (1882) as a voluntary partnership for a common endeavor). Renan argued that factors such as ethnicity, language, religion, economics, geography, ruling dynasty and historic military deeds were important but not sufficient. Needed was a spiritual soul that allowed as a \"daily referendum\" among the people. Civic-national ideals influenced the development of representative democracy in multiethnic countries such as the United States and France, as well as in constitutional monarchies such as Great Britain, Belgium and Spain.\nCreole.\nCreole nationalism is the ideology that emerged in independence movements among the creoles (descendants of the colonizers), especially in Latin America in the early 19th century. It was facilitated when French Emperor Napoleon seized control of Spain and Portugal, breaking the chain of control from the Spanish and Portuguese kings to the local governors. Allegiance to the Napoleonic states was rejected, and increasingly the creoles demanded independence. They achieved it after civil wars 1808\u20131826.\nEthnic.\nEthnic nationalism, also known as ethno-nationalism, is a form of nationalism wherein the \"nation\" is defined in terms of ethnicity. The central theme of ethnic nationalists is that \"nations are defined by a shared heritage, which usually includes a common language, a common faith, and a common ethnic ancestry\". It also includes ideas of a culture shared between members of the group, and with their ancestors. It is different from a purely cultural definition of \"the nation,\" which allows people to become members of a nation by cultural assimilation; and from a purely linguistic definition, according to which \"the nation\" consists of all speakers of a specific language.\nWhereas nationalism in and of itself does not imply a belief in the superiority of one ethnicity or country over others, some nationalists support ethnocentric supremacy or protectionism.\nThe humiliation of being a second-class citizen led regional minorities in multiethnic states, such as Great Britain, Spain, France, Germany, Russia and the Ottoman Empire, to define nationalism in terms of loyalty to their minority culture, especially language and religion. Forced assimilation was anathema.\nFor the politically dominant cultural group, assimilation was necessary to minimize disloyalty and treason and therefore became a major component of nationalism. A second factor for the politically dominant group was competition with neighboring states\u2014nationalism involved a rivalry, especially in terms of military prowess and economic strength.\nEconomic.\nEconomic nationalism, or economic patriotism, is an ideology that favors state interventionism in the economy, with policies that emphasize domestic control of the economy, labor, and capital formation, even if this requires the imposition of tariffs and other restrictions on the movement of labor, goods and capital.\nGendered and muscular.\nFeminist critique interprets nationalism as a mechanism through which sexual control and repression are justified and legitimized, often by a dominant masculine power. The gendering of nationalism through socially constructed notions of masculinity and femininity not only shapes what masculine and feminine participation in the building of that nation will look like, but also how the nation will be imagined by nationalists. A nation having its own identity is viewed as necessary, and often inevitable, and these identities are gendered. The physical land itself is often gendered as female (i.e. \"Motherland\"), with a body in constant danger of violation by foreign males, while national pride and protectiveness of \"her\" borders is gendered as masculine.\nHistory, political ideologies, and religions place most nations along a continuum of muscular nationalism. Muscular nationalism conceptualizes a nation's identity as being derived from muscular or masculine attributes that are unique to a particular country. If definitions of nationalism and gender are understood as socially and culturally constructed, the two may be constructed in conjunction by invoking an \"us\" versus \"them\" dichotomy for the purpose of the exclusion of the so-called \"other,\" who is used to reinforce the unifying ties of the nation. The empowerment of one gender, nation or sexuality tends to occur at the expense and disempowerment of another; in this way, nationalism can be used as an instrument to perpetuate heteronormative structures of power. The gendered manner in which dominant nationalism has been imagined in most states in the world has had important implications on not only individual's lived experience, but on international relations. Colonialism has historically been heavily intertwined with muscular nationalism, from research linking hegemonic masculinity and empire-building, to intersectional oppression being justified by colonialist images of the \"other\", a practice integral in the formation of Western identity. This \"othering\" may come in the form of orientalism, whereby the East is feminized and sexualized by the West. The imagined feminine East, or \"other,\" exists in contrast to the masculine West.\nThe status of conquered nations can become a causality dilemma: the nation was \"conquered because they were effeminate and seen as effeminate because they were conquered.\" In defeat they are considered militaristically unskilled, not aggressive, and thus not muscular. In order for a nation to be considered \"proper\", it must possess the male-gendered characteristics of virility, as opposed to the stereotypically female characteristics of subservience and dependency. Muscular nationalism is often inseparable from the concept of a warrior, which shares ideological commonalities across many nations; they are defined by the masculine notions of aggression, willingness to engage in war, decisiveness, and muscular strength, as opposed to the feminine notions of peacefulness, weakness, non-violence, and compassion. This masculinized image of a warrior has been theorized to be \"the culmination of a series of gendered historical and social processes\" played out in a national and international context. Ideas of cultural dualism\u2014of a martial man and chaste woman\u2014which are implicit in muscular nationalism, underline the raced, classed, gendered, and heteronormative nature of dominant national identity.\nNations and gender systems are mutually supportive constructions: the nation fulfils the masculine ideals of comradeship and brotherhood. Masculinity has been cited as a notable factor in producing political militancy. A common feature of national crisis is a drastic shift in the socially acceptable ways of being a man, which then helps to shape the gendered perception of the nation as a whole.\nIntegral, pan and irredentism.\nThere are different types of nationalism including Risorgimento nationalism and Integral nationalism. Whereas risorgimento nationalism applies to a nation seeking to establish a liberal state (for example the Risorgimento in Italy and similar movements in Greece, Germany, Poland during the 19th century or the civic American nationalism), integral nationalism results after a nation has achieved independence and has established a state. Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany, according to Alter and Brown, were examples of integral nationalism.\nSome of the qualities that characterize integral nationalism are anti-individualism, statism, radical extremism, and aggressive-expansionist militarism. The term Integral Nationalism often overlaps with fascism, although many natural points of disagreement exist. Integral nationalism arises in countries where a strong military ethos has become entrenched through the independence struggle, when, once independence is achieved, it is believed that a strong military is required to ensure the security and viability of the new state. Also, the success of such a liberation struggle results in feelings of national superiority that may lead to extreme nationalism.\nPan-nationalism is unique in that it covers a large area span. Pan-nationalism focuses more on \"clusters\" of ethnic groups. Pan-Slavism is one example of Pan-nationalism. The goal is to unite all Slavic people into one country. They did succeed by uniting several south Slavic people into Yugoslavia in 1918.\nLeft-wing.\nLeft-wing nationalism, occasionally known as socialist nationalism, not to be confused with the German fascist \"National Socialism\", is a political movement that combines left-wing politics with nationalism.\nMany nationalist movements are dedicated to national liberation, in the view that their nations are being persecuted by other nations and thus need to exercise self-determination by liberating themselves from the accused persecutors. Anti-revisionist Marxism\u2013Leninism is closely tied with this ideology, and practical examples include Stalin's early work \"Marxism and the National Question\" and his socialism in one country edict, which declares that nationalism can be used in an internationalist context, fighting for national liberation without racial or religious divisions.\nOther examples of left-wing nationalism include Fidel Castro's 26th of July Movement that launched the Cuban Revolution in 1959, Cornwall's Mebyon Kernow, Ireland's Sinn F\u00e9in, Wales's Plaid Cymru, Galicia's Galician Nationalist Bloc, the Awami League in Bangladesh, the African National Congress in South Africa and numerous movements in Eastern Europe.\nNational-anarchism.\nAmong the first advocates of national-anarchism were Hans Cany, Peter T\u00f6pfer and former National Front activist Troy Southgate, founder of the National Revolutionary Faction, a since disbanded British-based organization which cultivated links to certain far-left and far-right circles in the United Kingdom and in post-Soviet states, not to be confused with the national-anarchism of the Black Ram Group. In the United Kingdom, national-anarchists worked with \"Albion Awake\", \"Alternative Green\" (published by former \"Green Anarchist\" editor Richard Hunt) and Jonathan Boulter to develop the Anarchist Heretics Fair. Those national-anarchists cite their influences primarily from Mikhail Bakunin, William Godwin, Peter Kropotkin, Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, Max Stirner and Leo Tolstoy.\nA position developed in Europe during the 1990s, national-anarchist groups have seen arisen worldwide, most prominently in Australia (New Right Australia/New Zealand), Germany (International National Anarchism) and the United States (BANA). National-anarchism has been described as a radical right-wing nationalist ideology which advocates racial separatism and white racial purity. National-anarchists claim to syncretize neotribal ethnic nationalism with philosophical anarchism, mainly in their support for a stateless society whilst rejecting anarchist social philosophy. The main ideological innovation of national-anarchism is its anti-state palingenetic ultranationalism. National-anarchists advocate homogeneous communities in place of the nation state. National-anarchists claim that those of different ethnic or racial groups would be free to develop separately in their own tribal communes while striving to be politically meritocratic, economically non-capitalist, ecologically sustainable and socially and culturally traditional.\nAlthough the term \"national-anarchism\" dates back as far as the 1920s, the contemporary national-anarchist movement has been put forward since the late 1990s by British political activist Troy Southgate, who positions it as being \"beyond left and right\". The few scholars who have studied national-anarchism conclude that it represents a further evolution in the thinking of the radical right rather than an entirely new dimension on the political spectrum. National-anarchism is considered by anarchists as being a rebranding of totalitarian fascism and an oxymoron due to the inherent contradiction of anarchist philosophy of anti-fascism, abolition of unjustified hierarchy, dismantling of national borders and universal equality between different nationalities as being incompatible with the idea of a synthesis between anarchism and fascism.\nNational-anarchism has elicited scepticism and outright hostility from both left-wing and far-right critics. Critics, including scholars, accuse national-anarchists of being nothing more than white nationalists who promote a communitarian and racialist form of ethnic and racial separatism while wanting the militant chic of calling themselves \"anarchists\" without the historical and philosophical baggage that accompanies such a claim, including the anti-racist egalitarian anarchist philosophy and the contributions of Jewish anarchists. Some scholars are sceptical that implementing national-anarchism would result in an expansion of freedom and describe it as an authoritarian anti-statism that would result in authoritarianism and oppression, only on a smaller scale.\nNativist.\nNativist nationalism is a type of nationalism similar to creole or territorial types of nationalism, but which defines belonging to a nation solely by being born on its territory. In countries where strong nativist nationalism exists, people who were not born in the country are seen as lesser nationals than those who were born there and are called \"immigrants\" even if they became naturalized. It is cultural as people will never see a foreign-born person as one of them and is legal as such people are banned for life from holding certain jobs, especially government jobs. In scholarly studies, \"nativism\" is a standard technical term, although those who hold this political view do not typically accept the label. \"[N]ativists . . . do not consider themselves nativists. For them it is a negative term and they rather consider themselves as 'Patriots'.\"\nRacial.\nRacial nationalism is an ideology that advocates a racial definition of national identity. Racial nationalism seeks to preserve a given race through policies such as banning race mixing and the immigration of other races. Its ideas tend to be in direct conflict with those of anti-racism and multiculturalism. Specific examples are black nationalism and white nationalism.\nReligious.\nReligious nationalism is the relationship of nationalism to a particular religious belief, dogma, or affiliation where a shared religion can be seen to contribute to a sense of national unity, a common bond among the citizens of the nation. Saudi Arabian, Iranian, Egyptian, Iraqi, and the Pakistani-Islamic nationalism (Two-Nation Theory) are some examples.\nTerritorial.\nSome nationalists exclude certain groups. Some nationalists, defining the national community in ethnic, linguistic, cultural, historic, or religious terms (or a combination of these), may then seek to deem certain minorities as not truly being a part of the 'national community' as they define it. Sometimes a mythic homeland is more important for the national identity than the actual territory occupied by the nation.\nTerritorial nationalists assume that all inhabitants of a particular nation owe allegiance to their country of birth or adoption. A sacred quality is sought in the nation and in the popular memories it evokes. Citizenship is idealized by territorial nationalists. A criterion of a territorial nationalism is the establishment of a mass, public culture based on common values, codes and traditions of the population.\nSport.\nSport spectacles like football's World Cup command worldwide audiences as nations battle for supremacy and the fans invest intense support for their national team. Increasingly people have tied their loyalties and even their cultural identity to national teams. The globalization of audiences through television and other media has generated revenues from advertisers and subscribers in the billions of dollars, as the FIFA Scandals of 2015 revealed. Jeff Kingston looks at football, the Commonwealth Games, baseball, cricket, and the Olympics and finds that, \"The capacity of sports to ignite and amplify nationalist passions and prejudices is as extraordinary as is their power to console, unify, uplift and generate goodwill.\" The phenomenon is evident across most of the world. The British Empire strongly emphasized sports among its soldiers and agents across the world, and often the locals joined in enthusiastically. It established a high prestige competition in 1930, named the British Empire Games from 1930 to 1950, the British Empire and Commonwealth Games from 1954 to 1966, British Commonwealth Games from 1970 to 1974 and since then the Commonwealth Games.\nThe French Empire was not far behind the British in the use of sports to strengthen colonial solidarity with France. Colonial officials promoted and subsidized gymnastics, table games, and dance and helped football spread to French colonies.\nCriticism.\nCritics of nationalism have argued that it is often unclear what constitutes a nation, or whether a nation is a legitimate unit of political rule. Nationalists hold that the boundaries of a nation and a state should coincide with one another, thus nationalism tends to oppose multiculturalism. It can also lead to conflict when more than one national group finds itself claiming rights to a particular territory or seeking to take control of the state.\nPhilosopher A. C. Grayling describes nations as artificial constructs, \"their boundaries drawn in the blood of past wars\". He argues that \"there is no country on earth which is not home to more than one different but usually coexisting culture. Cultural heritage is not the same thing as national identity\".\nNationalism is considered by its critics to be inherently divisive, as adherents may draw upon and highlight perceived differences between people, emphasizing an individual's identification with their own nation. They also consider the idea to be potentially oppressive, because it can submerge individual identity within a national whole and give elites or political leaders potential opportunities to manipulate or control the masses. Much of the early opposition to nationalism was related to its geopolitical ideal of a separate state for every nation. The classic nationalist movements of the 19th century rejected the very existence of the multi-ethnic empires in Europe, contrary to an ideological critique of nationalism which developed into several forms of internationalism and anti-nationalism. The Islamic revival of the 20th century also produced an Islamist critique of the nation-state. (see Pan-Islamism)\nAt the end of the 19th century, Marxists and other socialists and communists (such as Rosa Luxemburg) produced political analyses that were critical of the nationalist movements then active in Central and Eastern Europe, although a variety of other contemporary socialists and communists, from Vladimir Lenin (a communist) to J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski (a socialist), were more sympathetic to national self-determination.\nIn his classic essay on the topic, George Orwell distinguishes nationalism from patriotism (which he defines as devotion to a particular place). More abstractly, nationalism is \"power-hunger tempered by self-deception\". For Orwell, the nationalist is more likely than not dominated by irrational negative impulses:\nA nationalist is one who thinks solely, or mainly, in terms of competitive prestige. He may be a positive or a negative nationalist\u2014that is, he may use his mental energy either in boosting or in denigrating\u2014but at any rate his thoughts always turn on victories, defeats, triumphs and humiliations. He sees history, especially contemporary history, as the endless rise and decline of great power units and every event that happens seems to him a demonstration that his own side is on the upgrade and some hated rival is on the downgrade. But finally, it is important not to confuse nationalism with mere worship of success. The nationalist does not go on the principle of simply ganging up with the strongest side. On the contrary, having picked his side, he persuades himself that it is the strongest and is able to stick to his belief even when the facts are overwhelmingly against him.\nIn the liberal political tradition, there was mostly a negative attitude toward nationalism as a dangerous force and a cause of conflict and war between nation-states. The historian Lord Acton put the case for \"nationalism as insanity\" in 1862. He argued that nationalism suppresses minorities, places country above moral principles and creates a dangerous individual attachment to the state. He opposed democracy and tried to defend the pope from Italian nationalism. Since the late 20th century, liberals have been increasingly divided, with some philosophers such as Michael Walzer, Isaiah Berlin, Charles Taylor and David Miller emphasizing that a liberal society needs to be based in a stable nation state.\nThe pacifist critique of nationalism also concentrates on the violence of some nationalist movements, the associated militarism, and on conflicts between nations inspired by jingoism or chauvinism. National symbols and patriotic assertiveness are in some countries discredited by their historical link with past wars, especially in Germany. British pacifist Bertrand Russell criticized nationalism for diminishing the individual's capacity to judge his or her fatherland's foreign policy. Albert Einstein stated that \"Nationalism is an infantile disease. It is the measles of mankind\". Jiddu Krishnamurti stated that \"Nationalism is merely the glorification of tribalism\".\nTranshumanists have also expressed their opposition to nationalism, to the extent that some transhumanists believe national identities should be dissolved entirely. The influential transhumanist FM-2030 refused to identify with any nationality, referring to himself as 'universal'. Furthermore, in \"The Transhumanist Handbook\", Kate Levchuk stated that a transhumanist \"doesn't believe in nationality\".\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Some nations are constructed around ethnicity (see ethnic nationalism) while others are bound by political constitutions (see civic nationalism).\nA nation is generally more overtly political than an ethnic group. Benedict Anderson defines a nation as \"an imagined political community [\u2026] imagined because the members of even the smallest nation will never know most of their fellow-members, meet them, or even hear of them, yet in the minds of each lives the image of their communion\", while Anthony D. Smith defines nations as cultural-political communities that have become conscious of their autonomy, unity and particular interests. \"Black's Law Dictionary\" also defines nation as a community of people inhabiting a defined territory and organized under an independent government. Thus, nation can be synonymous with state or country. Indeed, according to Thomas Hylland Eriksen, what distinguishes nations from other forms of collective identity, like ethnicity, is this very relationship with the state.\nThe consensus among scholars is that nations are socially constructed, historically contingent, organizationally flexible, and a distinctly modern phenomenon. Throughout history, people have had an attachment to their kin group and traditions, territorial authorities and their homeland, but nationalism \u2013 the belief that state and nation should align as a nation state \u2013 did not become a prominent ideology until the end of the 18th century.\nEtymology and terminology.\nThe English word \"nation\" from Middle English c. 1300, \"nacioun\" \"a race of people, large group of people with common ancestry and language,\" from Old French \"nacion\" \"birth (\"naissance\"), rank; descendants, relatives; country, homeland\" (12c.) and directly from Latin \"nationem\" (nominative \"natio\" \"(n\u0101t\u012d\u014d), supine of verb nascar \u00ab to birth \u00bb (supine : natum)\") \"birth, origin; breed, stock, kind, species; race of people, tribe,\" literally \"that which has been born,\" from \"natus\", past participle of \"nasci\" \"be born\" (Old Latin \"gnasci\"), from PIE root *gene- \"give birth, beget,\" with derivatives referring to procreation and familial and tribal groups.\nIn Latin, \"natio\" represents the children of the same birth and also a human group of same origin. By Cicero, \"natio\" is used for \"people\".\nNations in History.\nThe existence of earlier nations.\nThe broad consensus amongst scholars of nationalism is that nations are a recent phenomenon. However, some historians argue that their existence can be traced to the medieval period, or a minority believe even to antiquity.\nAdrian Hastings argued that nations and nationalism are predominantly Christian phenomena, with Jews being the sole exception. He viewed them as the \"true proto-nation\" that provided the original model of nationhood through the foundational example of ancient Israel in the Hebrew Bible, despite losing their political sovereignty for nearly two millennia. The Jews, however, maintained a cohesive national identity throughout this period, which ultimately culminated in the emergence of Zionism and the establishment of modern lsrael. Anthony D. Smith wrote that the Jews of the late Second Temple period provide \"a closer approximation to the ideal type of the nation ... perhaps anywhere else in the ancient world.\"\nSusan Reynolds has argued that many European medieval kingdoms were nations in the modern sense, except that political participation in nationalism was available only to a limited prosperous and literate class, while Hastings claims England's Anglo-Saxon kings mobilized mass nationalism in their struggle to repel Norse invasions. He argues that Alfred the Great, in particular, drew on biblical language in his law code and that during his reign selected books of the Bible were translated into Old English to inspire Englishmen to fight to turn back the Norse invaders. Hastings argues for a strong renewal of English nationalism (following a hiatus after the Norman conquest) beginning with the translation of the complete bible into English by the Wycliffe circle in the 1380s, positing that the frequency and consistency in usage of the word nation from the early fourteenth century onward strongly suggest English nationalism and the English nation have been continuous since that time.\nHowever, John Breuilly criticizes Hastings's assumption that continued usage of a term such as 'English' means continuity in its meaning. Patrick J. Geary agrees, arguing names were adapted to different circumstances by different powers and could convince people of continuity, even if radical discontinuity was the lived reality.\nFlorin Curta cites Medieval Bulgarian nation as another possible example. Danubian Bulgaria was founded in 680-681 as a continuation of Great Bulgaria. After the adoption of Orthodox Christianity in 864 it became one of the cultural centres of Slavic Europe. Its leading cultural position was consolidated with the invention of the Cyrillic script in its capital Preslav on the eve of the 10th century. Hugh Poulton argues the development of Old Church Slavonic literacy in the country had the effect of preventing the assimilation of the South Slavs into neighboring cultures and stimulated the development of a distinct ethnic identity. A symbiosis was carried out between the numerically weak Bulgars and the numerous Slavic tribes in that broad area from the Danube to the north, to the Aegean Sea to the south, and from the Adriatic Sea to the west, to the Black Sea to the east, who accepted the common ethnonym \"Bulgarians\". During the 10th century the Bulgarians established a form of national identity that was far from modern nationalism but helped them to survive as a distinct entity through the centuries.\nAnthony Kaldellis asserts in \"Hellenism in Byzantium\" (2008) that what is called the Byzantine Empire was the Roman Empire transformed into a nation-state in the Middle Ages.\nAzar Gat also argues China, Korea and Japan were nations by the time of the European Middle Ages.\nCriticisms.\nIn contrast, Geary rejects the conflation of early medieval and contemporary group identities as a myth, arguing it is a mistake to conclude continuity based on the recurrence of names. He criticizes historians for failing to recognize the differences between earlier ways of perceiving group identities and more contemporary attitudes, stating they are \"trapped in the very historical process we are attempting to study\".\nSimilarly, Sami Zubaida notes that many states and empires in history ruled over ethnically diverse populations, and \"shared ethnicity between ruler and ruled did not always constitute grounds for favour or mutual support\". He goes on to argue ethnicity was never the primary basis of identification for the members of these multinational empires.\nPaul Lawrence criticises Hastings's reading of Bede's \"Ecclesiastical History of the English People\" as evidence of an early English national identity, instead observing that those writing so-called 'national' histories may have \"been working with a rather different notion of 'the nation' to those writing history in the modern period\". Lawrence goes on to argue that such documents do not demonstrate how ordinary people identified themselves, pointing out that, while they serve as texts in which an elite defines itself, \"their significance in relation to what the majority thought and felt was likely to have been minor\".\nUse of term \"nationes\" by medieval universities and other medieval institutions.\nA significant early use of the term \"nation\", as \"natio\", occurred at medieval universities to describe the colleagues in a college or students, above all at the University of Paris, who were all born within a \"pays\", spoke the same language and expected to be ruled by their own familiar law. In 1383 and 1384, while studying theology at Paris, Jean Gerson was elected twice as a procurator for the French \"natio\". The University of Prague adopted the division of students into \"nationes\": from its opening in 1349 the \"studium generale\" which consisted of Bohemian, Bavarian, Saxon and Polish \"nations\".\nIn a similar way, the \"nationes\" were segregated by the Knights Hospitaller of Jerusalem, who maintained at Rhodes the hostels from which they took their name \"where foreigners eat and have their places of meeting, each nation apart from the others, and a Knight has charge of each one of these hostels, and provides for the necessities of the inmates according to their religion\", as the Spanish traveller Pedro Tafur noted in 1436.\nEarly modern nations.\nIn his article, \"The Mosaic Moment: An Early Modernist Critique of the Modernist Theory of Nationalism\", Philip S. Gorski argues that the first modern nation-state was the Dutch Republic, created by a fully modern political nationalism rooted in the model of biblical nationalism. In a 2013 article \"Biblical nationalism and the sixteenth-century states\", Diana Muir Appelbaum expands Gorski's argument to apply to a series of new, Protestant, sixteenth-century nation states. A similar, albeit broader, argument was made by Anthony D. Smith in his books, \"Chosen Peoples: Sacred Sources of National Identity\" and \"Myths and Memories of the Nation\".\nIn her book \"Nationalism: Five Roads to Modernity\", Liah Greenfeld argued that nationalism was invented in England by 1600. According to Greenfeld, England was \u201cthe first nation in the world\".\nFor Smith, creating a 'world of nations' has had profound consequences for the global state system, as a nation comprises both a cultural and political identity. Therefore, he argues, \"any attempt to forge a national identity is also a political action with political consequences, like the need to redraw the geopolitical map or alter the composition of political regimes and states\".\nSocial science.\nThere are three notable perspectives on how nations developed. Primordialism (perennialism), which reflects popular conceptions of nationalism but has largely fallen out of favour among academics, proposes that there have always been nations and that nationalism is a natural phenomenon. Ethnosymbolism explains nationalism as a dynamic, evolving phenomenon and stresses the importance of symbols, myths and traditions in the development of nations and nationalism. Modernization theory, which has superseded primordialism as the dominant explanation of nationalism, adopts a constructivist approach and proposes that nationalism emerged due to processes of modernization, such as industrialization, urbanization, and mass education, which made national consciousness possible.\nProponents of modernization theory describe nations as \"imagined communities\", a term coined by Benedict Anderson. A nation is an imagined community in the sense that the material conditions exist for imagining extended and shared connections and that it is objectively impersonal, even if each individual in the nation experiences themselves as subjectively part of an embodied unity with others. For the most part, members of a nation remain strangers to each other and will likely never meet. Nationalism is consequently seen an \"invented tradition\" in which shared sentiment provides a form of collective identity and binds individuals together in political solidarity. A nation's foundational \"story\" may be built around a combination of ethnic attributes, values and principles, and may be closely connected to narratives of belonging.\nScholars in the 19th and early 20th century offered constructivist criticisms of primordial theories about nations. A prominent lecture by Ernest Renan, \"What is a Nation?\", argues that a nation is \"a daily referendum\", and that nations are based as much on what the people jointly forget as on what they remember. Carl Darling Buck argued in a 1916 study, \"Nationality is essentially subjective, an active sentiment of unity, within a fairly extensive group, a sentiment based upon real but diverse factors, political, geographical, physical, and social, any or all of which may be present in this or that case, but no one of which must be present in all cases.\"\nIn the late 20th century, many social scientists argued that there were two types of nations, the civic nation of which French republican society was the principal example and the ethnic nation exemplified by the German peoples. The German tradition was conceptualized as originating with early 19th-century philosophers, like Johann Gottlieb Fichte, and referred to people sharing a common language, religion, culture, history, and ethnic origins, that differentiate them from people of other nations. On the other hand, the civic nation was traced to the French Revolution and ideas deriving from 18th-century French philosophers. It was understood as being centred in a willingness to \"live together\", this producing a nation that results from an act of affirmation. This is the vision, among others, of Ernest Renan.\nDebate about a potential future of nations.\nThere is an ongoing debate about the future of nations \u2212 about whether this framework will persist as is and whether there are viable or developing alternatives.\nThe theory of the clash of civilizations lies in direct contrast to cosmopolitan theories about an ever more-connected world that no longer requires nation states. According to political scientist Samuel P. Huntington, people's cultural and religious identities will be the primary source of conflict in the post\u2013Cold War world.\nThe theory was originally formulated in a 1992 lecture at the American Enterprise Institute, which was then developed in a 1993 \"Foreign Affairs\" article titled \"The Clash of Civilizations?\", in response to Francis Fukuyama's 1992 book, \"The End of History and the Last Man\". Huntington later expanded his thesis in a 1996 book \"The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order\".\nHuntington began his thinking by surveying the diverse theories about the nature of global politics in the post\u2013Cold War period. Some theorists and writers argued that human rights, liberal democracy and capitalist free market economics had become the only remaining ideological alternative for nations in the post\u2013Cold War world. Specifically, Francis Fukuyama, in \"The End of History and the Last Man\", argued that the world had reached a Hegelian \"end of history\".\nHuntington believed that while the age of ideology had ended, the world had reverted only to a normal state of affairs characterized by cultural conflict. In his thesis, he argued that the primary axis of conflict in the future will be along cultural and religious lines. Postnationalism is the process or trend by which nation states and national identities lose their importance relative to supranational and global entities. Several factors contribute to the trend Huntington identifies, including economic globalization, a rise in importance of multinational corporations, the internationalization of financial markets, the transfer of socio-political power from national authorities to supranational entities, such as multinational corporations, the United Nations and the European Union and the advent of new information and culture technologies such as the Internet. However attachment to citizenship and national identities often remains important.\nJan Zielonka of the University of Oxford states that \"the future structure and exercise of political power will resemble the medieval model more than the Westphalian one\" with the latter being about \"concentration of power, sovereignty and clear-cut identity\" and neo-medievalism meaning \"overlapping authorities, divided sovereignty, multiple identities and governing institutions, and fuzzy borders\".\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
