Codd, where all data are represented in terms of tuples, grouped into relations. A database organized in terms of the relational model is a relational database.\nThe purpose of the relational model is to provide a declarative method for specifying data and queries: users directly state what information the database contains and what information they want from it, and let the database management system software take care of describing data structures for storing the data and retrieval procedures for answering queries.\nMost relational databases use the SQL data definition and query language; these systems implement what can be regarded as an engineering approximation to the relational model. A \"table\" in a SQL database schema corresponds to a predicate variable; the contents of a table to a relation; key constraints, other constraints, and SQL queries correspond to predicates. However, SQL databases deviate from the relational model in many details, and Codd fiercely argued against deviations that compromise the original principles.\nHistory.\nThe relational model was developed by Edgar F. Codd as a general model of data, and subsequently promoted by Chris Date and Hugh Darwen among others. In their 1995 \"The Third Manifesto\", Date and Darwen try to demonstrate how the relational model can accommodate certain \"desired\" object-oriented features.\nExtensions.\nSome years after publication of his 1970 model, Codd proposed a three-valued logic (True, False, Missing/NULL) version of it to deal with missing information, and in his \"The Relational Model for Database Management Version 2\" (1990) he went a step further with a four-valued logic (True, False, Missing but Applicable, Missing but Inapplicable) version.\nConceptualization.\nBasic concepts.\nA \"relation\" consists of a \"heading\" and a \"body\". The heading defines a set of \"attributes\", each with a \"name\" and \"data type\" (sometimes called a \"domain\"). The number of attributes in this set is the relation's \"degree\" or \"arity\". The body is a set of \"tuples\". A tuple is a collection of \"n\" \"values\", where \"n\" is the relation's degree, and each value in the tuple corresponds to a unique attribute. The number of tuples in this set is the relation's \"cardinality\".\nRelations are represented by \"relational variables\" or \"relvars\", which can be reassigned. A \"database\" is a collection of relvars.\nIn this model, databases follow the \"Information Principle\": At any given time, all information in the database is represented solely by values within tuples, corresponding to attributes, in relations identified by relvars.\nConstraints.\nA database may define arbitrary boolean expressions as constraints. If all constraints evaluate as \"true\", the database is \"consistent\"; otherwise, it is \"inconsistent\". If a change to a database's relvars would leave the database in an inconsistent state, that change is illegal and must not succeed.\nIn general, constraints are expressed using relational comparison operators, of which just one, \"is subset of\" (\u2286), is theoretically sufficient.\nTwo special cases of constraints are expressed as \"keys\" and \"foreign keys\":\nKeys.\nA \"candidate key\", or simply a \"key\", is the smallest subset of attributes guaranteed to uniquely differentiate each tuple in a relation. Since each tuple in a relation must be unique, every relation necessarily has a key, which may be its complete set of attributes. A relation may have multiple keys, as there may be multiple ways to uniquely differentiate each tuple.\nAn attribute may be unique across tuples without being a key. For example, a relation describing a company's employees may have two attributes: ID and Name. Even if no employees currently share a name, if it is possible to eventually hire a new employee with the same name as a current employee, the attribute subset {Name} is not a key. Conversely, if the subset {ID} is a key, this means not only that no employees \"currently\" share an ID, but that no employees \"will ever\" share an ID.\nForeign keys.\nA \"foreign key\" is a subset of attributes \"A\" in a relation \"R1\" that corresponds with a key of another relation \"R2\", with the property that the projection of \"R1\" on \"A\" is a subset of the projection of \"R2\" on \"A\". In other words, if a tuple in \"R1\" contains values for a foreign key, there must be a corresponding tuple in \"R2\" containing the same values for the corresponding key.\nRelational operations.\nUsers (or programs) request data from a relational database by sending it a query. In response to a query, the database returns a result set.\nOften, data from multiple tables are combined into one, by doing a join. Conceptually, this is done by taking all possible combinations of rows (the Cartesian product), and then filtering out everything except the answer.\nThere are a number of relational operations in addition to join. These include project (the process of eliminating some of the columns), restrict (the process of eliminating some of the rows), union (a way of combining two tables with similar structures), difference (that lists the rows in one table that are not found in the other), intersect (that lists the rows found in both tables), and product (mentioned above, which combines each row of one table with each row of the other). Depending on which other sources you consult, there are a number of other operators\u00a0\u2013 many of which can be defined in terms of those listed above. These include semi-join, outer operators such as outer join and outer union, and various forms of division. Then there are operators to rename columns, and summarizing or aggregating operators, and if you permit relation values as attributes (relation-valued attribute), then operators such as group and ungroup.\nThe flexibility of relational databases allows programmers to write queries that were not anticipated by the database designers. As a result, relational databases can be used by multiple applications in ways the original designers did not foresee, which is especially important for databases that might be used for a long time (perhaps several decades). This has made the idea and implementation of relational databases very popular with businesses.\nDatabase normalization.\nRelations are classified based upon the types of anomalies to which they're vulnerable. A database that is in the first normal form is vulnerable to all types of anomalies, while a database that is in the domain/key normal form has no modification anomalies. Normal forms are hierarchical in nature. That is, the lowest level is the first normal form, and the database cannot meet the requirements for higher level normal forms without first having met all the requirements of the lesser normal forms.\nLogical interpretation.\nThe relational model is a formal system. A relation's attributes define a set of logical propositions. Each proposition can be expressed as a tuple. The body of a relation is a subset of these tuples, representing which propositions are true. Constraints represent additional propositions which must also be true. Relational algebra is a set of logical rules that can validly infer conclusions from these propositions.\nThe definition of a \"tuple\" allows for a unique empty tuple with no values, corresponding to the empty set of attributes. If a relation has a degree of 0 (i.e. its heading contains no attributes), it may have either a cardinality of 0 (a body containing no tuples) or a cardinality of 1 (a body containing the single empty tuple). These relations represent Boolean truth values. The relation with degree 0 and cardinality 0 is \"False\", while the relation with degree 0 and cardinality 1 is \"True\".\nExample.\nIf a relation of Employees contains the attributes \"{Name, ID}\", then the tuple \"{Alice, 1}\" represents the proposition: \"There exists an employee named \"Alice\" with ID \"1\"\". This proposition may be true or false. If this tuple exists in the relation's body, the proposition is true (there is such an employee). If this tuple is not in the relation's body, the proposition is false (there is no such employee).\nFurthermore, if \"{ID}\" is a key, then a relation containing the tuples \"{Alice, 1}\" and \"{Bob, 1}\" would represent the following contradiction:\nUnder the principle of explosion, this contradiction would allow the system to prove that any arbitrary proposition is true. The database must enforce the key constraint to prevent this.\nExamples.\nDatabase.\nAn idealized, very simple example of a description of some relvars (relation variables) and their attributes:\nIn this design we have three relvars: Customer, Order, and Invoice. The bold, underlined attributes are \"candidate keys\". The non-bold, underlined attributes are \"foreign keys\".\nUsually one candidate key is chosen to be called the primary key and used in preference over the other candidate keys, which are then called alternate keys.\nA \"candidate key\" is a unique identifier enforcing that no tuple will be duplicated; this would make the relation into something else, namely a bag, by violating the basic definition of a set. Both foreign keys and superkeys (that includes candidate keys) can be composite, that is, can be composed of several attributes. Below is a tabular depiction of a relation of our example Customer relvar; a relation can be thought of as a value that can be attributed to a relvar.\nCustomer relation.\nIf we attempted to \"insert\" a new customer with the ID \"123\", this would violate the design of the relvar since Customer ID is a \"primary key\" and we already have a customer \"123\". The DBMS must reject a transaction such as this that would render the database inconsistent by a violation of an integrity constraint. However, it is possible to insert another customer named \"Alice\", as long as this new customer has a unique ID, since the Name field is not part of the primary key.\n\"Foreign keys\" are integrity constraints enforcing that the value of the attribute set is drawn from a \"candidate key\" in another relation. For example, in the Order relation the attribute Customer ID is a foreign key. A \"join\" is the operation that draws on information from several relations at once. By joining relvars from the example above we could \"query\" the database for all of the Customers, Orders, and Invoices. If we only wanted the tuples for a specific customer, we would specify this using a restriction condition. If we wanted to retrieve all of the Orders for Customer \"123\", we could query the database to return every row in the Order table with Customer ID \"123\" .\nThere is a flaw in our database design above. The Invoice relvar contains an Order ID attribute. So, each tuple in the Invoice relvar will have one Order ID, which implies that there is precisely one Order for each Invoice. But in reality an invoice can be created against many orders, or indeed for no particular order. Additionally the Order relvar contains an Invoice ID attribute, implying that each Order has a corresponding Invoice. But again this is not always true in the real world. An order is sometimes paid through several invoices, and sometimes paid without an invoice. In other words, there can be many Invoices per Order and many Orders per Invoice. This is a many-to-many relationship between Order and Invoice (also called a \"non-specific relationship\"). To represent this relationship in the database a new relvar should be introduced whose role is to specify the correspondence between Orders and Invoices:\n OrderInvoice (Order ID, Invoice ID)\nNow, the Order relvar has a \"one-to-many relationship\" to the OrderInvoice table, as does the Invoice relvar. If we want to retrieve every Invoice for a particular Order, we can query for all orders where Order ID in the Order relation equals the Order ID in OrderInvoice, and where Invoice ID in OrderInvoice equals the Invoice ID in Invoice.\nApplication to relational databases.\nA data type in a relational database might be the set of integers, the set of character strings, the set of dates, etc. The relational model does not dictate what types are to be supported.\nAttributes are commonly represented as columns, tuples as rows, and relations as tables. A table is specified as a list of column definitions, each of which specifies a unique column name and the type of the values that are permitted for that column. An attribute \"value\" is the entry in a specific column and row.\nA database relvar (relation variable) is commonly known as a base table. The heading of its assigned value at any time is as specified in the table declaration and its body is that most recently assigned to it by an update operator (typically, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE). The heading and body of the table resulting from evaluating a query are determined by the definitions of the operators used in that query.\nSQL and the relational model.\nSQL, initially pushed as the standard language for relational databases, deviates from the relational model in several places. The current ISO SQL standard doesn't mention the relational model or use relational terms or concepts.\nAccording to the relational model, a Relation's attributes and tuples are mathematical sets, meaning they are unordered and unique. In a SQL table, neither rows nor columns are proper sets. A table may contain both duplicate rows and duplicate columns, and a table's columns are explicitly ordered. SQL uses a Null value to indicate missing data, which has no analog in the relational model. Because a row can represent unknown information, SQL does not adhere to the relational model's \"Information Principle\".\nSet-theoretic formulation.\nBasic notions in the relational model are \"relation names\" and \"attribute names\". We will represent these as strings such as \"Person\" and \"name\" and we will usually use the variables formula_1 and formula_2 to range over them. Another basic notion is the set of \"atomic values\" that contains values such as numbers and strings.\nOur first definition concerns the notion of \"tuple\", which formalizes the notion of row or record in a table:\n A tuple is a partial function from attribute names to atomic values.\n A header is a finite set of attribute names.\n The projection of a tuple formula_3 on a finite set of attributes formula_4 is formula_5.\nThe next definition defines \"relation\" that formalizes the contents of a table as it is defined in the relational model.\n A relation is a tuple formula_6 with formula_7, the header, and formula_8, the body, a set of tuples that all have the domain formula_7.\nSuch a relation closely corresponds to what is usually called the extension of a predicate in first-order logic except that here we identify the places in the predicate with attribute names. Usually in the relational model a database schema is said to consist of a set of relation names, the headers that are associated with these names and the constraints that should hold for every instance of the database schema.\n A relation universe formula_10 over a header formula_7 is a non-empty set of relations with header formula_7.\n A relation schema formula_13 consists of a header formula_7 and a predicate formula_15 that is defined for all relations formula_16 with header formula_7. A relation satisfies a relation schema formula_13 if it has header formula_7 and satisfies formula_20.\nKey constraints and functional dependencies.\nOne of the simplest and most important types of relation constraints is the \"key constraint\". It tells us that in every instance of a certain relational schema the tuples can be identified by their values for certain attributes.\nA superkey is a set of column headers for which the values of those columns concatenated are unique across all rows. Formally:\n A superkey is written as a finite set of attribute names.\n A superkey formula_21 holds in a relation formula_6 if:\n* formula_23 and\n* there exist no two distinct tuples formula_24 such that formula_25.\n A superkey holds in a relation universe formula_10 if it holds in all relations in formula_10.\n Theorem: A superkey formula_21 holds in a relation universe formula_10 over formula_7 if and only if formula_23 and formula_32 holds in formula_10.\nA candidate key is a superkey that cannot be further subdivided to form another superkey.\n A superkey formula_21 holds as a candidate key for a relation universe formula_10 if it holds as a superkey for formula_10 and there is no proper subset of formula_21 that also holds as a superkey for formula_10.\nFunctional dependency is the property that a value in a tuple may be derived from another value in that tuple.\n A functional dependency (FD for short) is written as formula_39 for formula_40 finite sets of attribute names.\n A functional dependency formula_39 holds in a relation formula_6 if:\n* formula_43 and\n* formula_44 tuples formula_24, formula_46\n A functional dependency formula_39 holds in a relation universe formula_10 if it holds in all relations in formula_10.\n A functional dependency is trivial under a header formula_7 if it holds in all relation universes over formula_7.\n Theorem: An FD formula_39 is trivial under a header formula_7 if and only if formula_54.\n Armstrong's axioms: The closure of a set of FDs formula_55 under a header formula_7, written as formula_57, is the smallest superset of formula_55 such that:\n* formula_59 (reflexivity)\n* formula_60 (transitivity) and\n* formula_61 (augmentation)\n Theorem: Armstrong's axioms are sound and complete; given a header formula_7 and a set formula_55 of FDs that only contain subsets of formula_7, formula_65 if and only if formula_39 holds in all relation universes over formula_7 in which all FDs in formula_55 hold.\n The completion of a finite set of attributes formula_69 under a finite set of FDs formula_55, written as formula_71, is the smallest superset of formula_69 such that:\n* formula_73\n The completion of an attribute set can be used to compute if a certain dependency is in the closure of a set of FDs.\n Theorem: Given a set formula_55 of FDs, formula_65 if and only if formula_76.\n An irreducible cover of a set formula_55 of FDs is a set formula_78 of FDs such that:\n* formula_79\n* there exists no formula_80 such that formula_81\n* formula_82 is a singleton set and\n* formula_83.\nAlgorithm to derive candidate keys from functional dependencies.\n algorithm derive candidate keys from functional dependencies is\n input: a set \"S\" of FDs that contain only subsets of a header \"H\"\n output: the set \"C\" of superkeys that hold as candidate keys in\n all relation universes over \"H\" in which all FDs in \"S\" hold\n \"C\" := \u2205 // found candidate keys\n \"Q\" := { \"H\" } // superkeys that contain candidate keys\n while \"Q\" &lt;&gt; \u2205 do\n let \"K\" be some element from \"Q\"\n \"minimal\" := true\n for each \"X-&gt;Y\" in \"S\" do\n \"K' \":= (\"K\"\u00a0\u2013 \"Y\") \u222a \"X\" // derive new superkey\n if \"K' \"\u2282 \"K\" then\n \"minimal\" := false\n end if\n end for\n if \"minimal\" and there is not a subset of \"K\" in \"C\" then\n remove all supersets of \"K\" from \"C\"\n end if\n end while\nAlternatives.\nOther models include the hierarchical model and network model. Some systems using these older architectures are still in use today in data centers with high data volume needs, or where existing systems are so complex and abstract that it would be cost-prohibitive to migrate to systems employing the relational model. Also of note are newer object-oriented databases. and Datalog.\n\"Datalog\" is a database definition language, which combines a relational view of data, as in the relational model, with a logical view, as in logic programming. Whereas relational databases use a relational calculus or relational algebra, with relational operations, such as \"union\", \"intersection\", \"set difference\" and \"cartesian product\" to specify queries, Datalog uses logical connectives, such as \"if\", \"or\", \"and\" and \"not\" to define relations as part of the database itself.\nIn contrast with the relational model, which cannot express recursive queries without introducing a least-fixed-point operator, recursive relations can be defined in Datalog, without introducing any new logical connectives or operators.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

From 1949 until 1990 it served as the seat of the state senate of West Berlin and from 1949 until 1991 as the seat of the Governing Mayor.\nHistory.\nThe sandstone building was constructed between 1911 and 1914, when it replaced the old town hall of Sch\u00f6neberg, at that time an independent city () not yet incorporated into Greater Berlin, which took place in 1920. The Nazi authorities had a series of war murals by Franz Eichhorst added to the interior in 1938. In World War II the building was severely damaged by Allied bombing and during the final Battle of Berlin.\nAfter the war the undestroyed \"Neues Stadthaus\", former head office of Berlin's municipal fire insurance \"Feuersoziet\u00e4t\", on Parochialstra\u00dfe in Mitte, served as intermittent city hall, replacing the ruined Rotes Rathaus (Red City Hall, also in East Berlin), the traditional seat of the Berlin government. With the division of Berlin's city government and administration in September 1948 the \"Neues Stadthaus\" was in the Communist \"Ostsektor\" (eastern sector) and became off limits to West Berlin. As a \"temporary\" measure the barely repaired Rathaus Sch\u00f6neberg on Rudolph-Wilde-Platz became the city hall for West Berlin. In 1950 the Freedom Bell (\"Freiheitsglocke\"), a gift by the United States, was installed in the rebuilt tower.\nDuring the Berlin Blockade, the Uprising of 1953, and the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, Rudolph-Wilde-Platz in front of the building became a gathering place for protest rallies. After the construction of the Berlin Wall in 1961, the steps of Rathaus Sch\u00f6neberg were the location where U.S. President John F. Kennedy spoke on 26 June 1963, proclaiming \"Ich bin ein Berliner\". On the night of his assassination, several thousand Berliners spontaneously gathered at the square, which was officially renamed John-F.-Kennedy-Platz three days later. A large memorial plaque, mounted on a column at the entrance of the building, and the room above the entrance overlooking the square are dedicated to Kennedy and his visit.\nThere was a large assembly in front of the Rathaus on 10 November 1989, the day after the fall of the Berlin Wall. Prominent people attending were chancellor Helmut Kohl, former chancellor Willy Brandt, and foreign minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher.\nAfter reunification, Rathaus Sch\u00f6neberg reverted to its original purpose of being Sch\u00f6neberg Borough Town Hall. Upon the 2001 Berlin administrative reform, Rathaus Sch\u00f6neberg became the town hall for the newly constituted borough of Tempelhof-Sch\u00f6neberg.\nIt was also the permanent home to an exhibition of the life of Willy Brandt (1913\u20131992), Mayor of West Berlin from 1957 to 1966 and Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany 1969\u201374. The exhibition was closed as from January 2010; it is planned to open again at another site in the city.\nSince 2005, the exhibition called \"Wir waren Nachbarn \u2013 Biografien j\u00fcdischer Zeitzeugen\" (English title:\"We were Neighbours once \u2013 Biographies of Jews in Sch\u00f6neberg and Tempelhof under the Nazi Regime\") takes place in the exhibition hall of the Rathaus Sch\u00f6neberg.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "26225", "revid": "11096", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26225", "title": "R\u00e6dwald of East Anglia", "text": "King of East Anglia (ruled c. 599\u2013624)\nR\u00e6dwald (, ; 'power in counsel'), also written as Raedwald or Redwald (), (died c. AD 624) was a king of East Anglia, an Anglo-Saxon kingdom which included the present-day English counties of Norfolk and Suffolk. He was the son of Tytila of East Anglia and a member of the Wuffingas dynasty (named after his grandfather, Wuffa), who were the first kings of the East Angles. Details about R\u00e6dwald's reign are scarce, primarily because the Viking invasions of the 9th century destroyed the monasteries in East Anglia where many documents would have been kept. R\u00e6dwald reigned from about 599 until his death around 624, initially under the overlordship of \u00c6thelberht of Kent. In 616, as a result of fighting the Battle of the River Idle and defeating \u00c6thelfrith of Northumbria, he was able to install Edwin, who was acquiescent to his authority, as the new king of Northumbria. During the battle, both \u00c6thelfrith and R\u00e6dwald's son, R\u00e6genhere, were killed.\nFrom around 616 R\u00e6dwald was the most powerful of the English kings south of the Humber estuary. According to Bede, he was the fourth ruler to hold \"imperium\" over other southern Anglo-Saxon kingdoms: he was referred to in the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\", written centuries after his death, as a \"bretwalda\" (an Old English term meaning 'Britain-ruler' or 'wide-ruler'). He was the first king of the East Angles to become a Christian, converting at \u00c6thelberht's court some time before 605, while also maintaining a pagan temple. He helped Christianity to survive in East Anglia during the apostasy of the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms of Essex and Kent. Historians consider him the most likely occupant of the Sutton Hoo ship-burial, although other theories have been advanced. A smaller ship-burial was also discovered in 1998 close to the original Sutton Hoo site, which is thought to have contained the body of his son R\u00e6genhere, who died in battle in 616.\nSources.\nThe kingdom of East Anglia () was a small independent Anglo-Saxon kingdom that comprised what are now the English counties of Norfolk and Suffolk and perhaps the eastern part of the Cambridgeshire Fens. Much less documentary evidence survives from East Anglia than from other Anglo-Saxon kingdoms. The historian Barbara Yorke argues that East Anglia almost certainly produced a similar range of written materials, but they were destroyed during the Viking conquest in the 9th century.\nR\u00e6dwald is the first king of the East Angles of whom more than a name is known, though no details of his life before his accession are known. The earliest and most substantial source for R\u00e6dwald is the \"Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum\" (\"Ecclesiastical History of the English People\"), completed in 731 by Bede, a Northumbrian monk. Bede placed R\u00e6dwald's reign between the advent of the Gregorian mission to Kent in 597 and the marriage and conversion of Edwin of Northumbria during 625\u2013626.\nLater medieval chroniclers, such as Roger of Wendover, gave some information about East Anglian events, but Yorke suggests that the annalistic format used forced these writers to guess the dates of the key events they recorded. Such later sources are therefore treated with caution. The \"Anglian collection\", which dates from the late 8th century, contains an East Anglian genealogical tally, but R\u00e6dwald is not included. R\u00e6dwald is however referred to in the 8th century \"Vita\" of St Gregory the Great, written by a member of the religious community at Whitby. The Battle of the River Idle, in which R\u00e6dwald and his forces defeated the Northumbrians, is described in the 12th century \"Historia Anglorum\", written by Henry of Huntingdon.\nThe context of R\u00e6dwald's kingdom.\nThe Anglo-Saxons, who are known to have included Angles, Saxons, Jutes and Frisians, began to arrive in Britain in the 5th century. By 600, a number of kingdoms had begun to form in the conquered territories. By the beginning of the 7th century, the southern part of what became England was almost entirely under their control.\nDuring R\u00e6dwald's youth, the establishment of other ruling houses was accomplished. Sometime before 588, \u00c6thelberht of Kent married Bercta, the Christian daughter of the Frankish ruler Charibert I. As early as 568, Ceawlin of Wessex, the most powerful ruler south of the Humber estuary, repulsed \u00c6thelberht. According to later sources, Mercia was founded by Creoda in 585, although a paucity of sources makes it difficult to know how the Mercian royal line became established.\nNorth of the Humber, the kingdoms of Deira and Bernicia possessed rival royal dynasties. \u00c6lla ruled Deira until his death in 588, leaving his daughter Acha, his son Edwin, and another unknown sibling. The Bernician dynasty, allied by kinship to the kingdom of Wessex, gained ascendancy over Deira, forcing Edwin to live in exile in the court of Cadfan ap Iago of Gwynedd. In various wars, \u00c6thelfrith of Bernicia consolidated the Northumbrian state, and in around 604 he was able to bring Deira under his dominion.\nFamily.\nR\u00e6dwald, which in Old English means 'power in counsel', was born around 560\u2013580. The son of Tytila, whom he succeeded, he was the elder brother of Eni. According to Bede, he was descended from Wuffa, the founder of the Wuffingas dynasty: \"filius Tytili, cuius pater fuit UUffa\" ('the son of Tytil, whose father was Wuffa').\nAt some time during the 590s, R\u00e6dwald married a woman whose name is unknown, though it is known from Bede that she was pagan. By her he fathered at least two sons, R\u00e6genhere and Eorpwald. He also had an older son, Sigeberht, whose name is unlike other Wuffingas names but which is typical of the East Saxon dynasty. It has been suggested that R\u00e6dwald's queen had previously been married to a member of the Essex royal family and that Sigeberht was R\u00e6dwald's stepson, as was stated by William of Malmesbury in the 12th century. Sigeberht earned the enmity of his step-father, who drove him into exile in Gaul, possibly to protect the Wuffingas bloodline.\nFor a family tree that includes the descendants of Eni, see Wuffingas.\nEarly reign and baptism.\nIn 597 in the early years of R\u00e6dwald's reign Augustine of Canterbury arrived on mission from Rome, leading to the conversion of the bretwalda \u00c6thelberht of Kent as well as Saeberht of Essex, and the establishment of new bishoprics in their kingdoms. \nBede states that R\u00e6dwald also converted to Christianity, presumably at the invitation of \u00c6thelberht who may have been his baptismal sponsor. The date of his conversion is unknown, but it is likely to have been around 604 or later. Since it is claimed that Augustine, who died in about 605, dedicated a church near Ely, it may have swiftly followed Saebert's conversion in 604. R\u00e6dwald's marriage to a member of the royal dynasty of Essex helped form a diplomatic alliance between the neighbouring kingdoms of East Anglia and Essex. His conversion in Kent would have affiliated him with \u00c6thelberht, bringing him directly into the sphere of Kent.\nBede describes R\u00e6dwald's relationship with \u00c6thelberht in an ambiguous passage which implies that R\u00e6dwald retained \"ducatus\", or military command of his people, while \u00c6thelberht held \"imperium\". This implies that being a \"bretwalda\" usually included holding the military command of other kingdoms and also that it was more than that, since \u00c6thelberht is \"bretwalda\" despite R\u00e6dwald's control of his own troops. R\u00e6dwald did not fully abandon his pagan beliefs which together with the fact that he retained military independence, implies that \u00c6thelberht's overlordship of East Anglia was much weaker than his influence with the East Saxons. An alternative interpretation, however, is that the passage in Bede should be translated as \"R\u00e6dwald, king of the East Angles, who while \u00c6thelberht lived, even conceded to him the military leadership of his people\"; if this is Bede's intent, then East Anglia firmly was under \u00c6thelberht's overlordship.\nIn East Anglia, R\u00e6dwald's conversion was not universally accepted by his household or his own queen. According to the historian Steven Plunkett, she and her pagan teachers persuaded him to default in part from his commitment to the Christian faith. As a result, he kept in the temple two altars, one dedicated to pagan gods and the other to Christ. Bede, writing decades later, described how Ealdwulf of East Anglia, a grandson of R\u00e6dwald's brother Eni, recalled seeing the temple when he was a boy. It may have been located at Rendlesham, emerging focus of the \"regio\" of the Wuffing dynasty, according to Plunkett. Barbara Yorke argues that R\u00e6dwald was not willing to fully embrace Christianity because conversion via \u00c6thelberht would have been acknowledgment of an inferior status to the Kentish king. R\u00e6dwald's lack of commitment towards Christianity earned him the enmity of Bede, who regarded him as a renouncer of the faith.\nR\u00e6dwald and Edwin of Northumbria.\nEdwin's exile.\n\u00c6thelfrith of Northumbria may have married Acha, who was the mother of his son Oswald (born in about 604), according to Bede. \u00c6thelfrith pursued Acha's exiled brother Edwin in an attempt to destroy him and ensure that the Bernician rulership of Northumbria would be unchallenged. Edwin found hospitality in the household of Cearl of Mercia and later married Cearl's daughter. Edwin's nephew Hereric, an exile in the British kingdom of Elmet, was slain there under treacherous circumstances. Edwin eventually sought the protection of R\u00e6dwald, where he was received willingly. R\u00e6dwald promised to protect him, and Edwin lived with the king amongst his royal companions. When news of Edwin reached \u00c6thelfrith in Northumbria, he sent messengers to R\u00e6dwald offering money in return for Edwin's death, but R\u00e6dwald refused to comply. \u00c6thelfrith sent messengers a second and a third time, offering even greater gifts of silver and promising war if these were not accepted. R\u00e6dwald then weakened and promised either to kill Edwin or to hand him over to ambassadors.\nWhen a chance arose for him to escape to a safe country, Edwin chose to remain at R\u00e6dwald's court. He was then visited by a stranger who was aware of R\u00e6dwald's deliberations. The source for this story, written at Whitby, stated that the stranger was Paulinus of York, a member of the Canterbury mission, who offered Edwin the hope of R\u00e6dwald's support and held out the prospect that Edwin might someday attain greater royal power than any previous English king. Paulinus was assured by Edwin that he would accept his religious teaching. His vision of Paulinus was afterwards made the means of his decision to embrace Christianity, on the condition that he survived and achieved power. If, as is supposed by some, Paulinus appeared to him in the flesh, the bishop's presence at R\u00e6dwald's court would throw some light on the king's position regarding religion.\nR\u00e6dwald's pagan queen admonished him for acting in a manner dishonourable for a king by betraying his trust for the sake of money and wanting to sell his imperiled friend in exchange for riches. As a result of her admonishment, once \u00c6thelfrith's ambassadors had gone, R\u00e6dwald resolved on war.\nThe Battle of the River Idle.\nIn 616 or 617 R\u00e6dwald assembled an army and marched north, accompanied by his son R\u00e6genhere, to confront \u00c6thelfrith. They met on the western boundary of the kingdom of Lindsey, on the east bank of the River Idle. The battle was fierce and was long commemorated in the saying, 'The river Idle was foul with the blood of Englishmen'. During the fighting, \u00c6thelfrith and R\u00e6dwald's son R\u00e6genhere were both slain. Edwin then succeeded \u00c6thelfrith as the king of Northumbria, and \u00c6thelfrith's sons were subsequently forced into exile.\nA separate account of the battle, given by Henry of Huntingdon, stated that R\u00e6dwald's army was split into three formations, led by R\u00e6dwald, R\u00e6genhere, and Edwin. With more experienced fighters, \u00c6thelfrith attacked in loose formation. At the sight of R\u00e6genhere, perhaps thinking he was Edwin, \u00c6thelfrith's men cut their way through to him and slew him. After the death of his son, R\u00e6dwald furiously breached his lines, killing \u00c6thelfrith amid a great slaughter of the Northumbrians.\nThe historian David Peter Kirby has argued that the battle was more than a clash between two kings over the treatment of an exiled nobleman but was \"part of a protracted struggle to determine the military and political leadership of the Anglian peoples\" at that time.\nR\u00e6dwald's \"imperium\".\nOn 24 February 616, the year of the Battle of the River Idle, \u00c6thelberht of Kent died and was succeeded by his pagan son Eadbald. After the death of the Christian Saebert of Essex, his three sons shared the kingdom, returning it to pagan rule, and drove out the Gregorian missionaries led by Mellitus. The Canterbury mission had removed to Gaul before Eadbald was brought back into the fold. During this period the only royal Christian altar in England belonged to R\u00e6dwald. By the time of his death, the mission in Kent had been fully re-established.\nR\u00e6dwald's power became great enough for Bede to recognise him as the successor to the \"imperium\" of \u00c6thelberht. Bede also called him \"Rex Anglorum\", the 'King of the Angles', a term that R\u00e6dwald's contemporaries would have used for their overlord. It is unclear where his power was centred or even how he established his authority over the Angles of eastern England.\nBy Edwin's debt of allegiance to him, R\u00e6dwald became the first foreign king to hold direct influence in Northumbria. He would have been instrumental in Edwin's secure establishment as king of both Deira and Bernicia.\nThe development of Gipeswic.\nDuring the first quarter of the 7th century, the quayside settlement at Gipeswic (Ipswich) became an important estuarine trading centre, receiving imported goods such as pottery from other trading markets situated around the coasts of the North Sea. Steven Plunkett suggests that the founding of Gipeswic took place under the supervision of Wuffingas . It took another hundred years for the settlement to develop into a town, but its beginnings can be seen as a reflection of the personal importance of R\u00e6dwald during the period of his supremacy.\nThe excavated grave-goods of the Anglo-Saxon cemetery at Gipeswic, including those found in burials under small barrows, were not particularly wealthy or elaborate. They lacked the strong characterization of a neighbouring late 6th century cemetery at a higher crossing of the river. One exception was a furnished grave that has been suggested to be that of a visitor from the Rhineland.\nDeath.\nR\u00e6dwald is believed to have died around 624: his death date can be narrowed down to only within a few years. He must have reigned for some time after \u00c6thelberht died, in order for him to have been noted as a \"bretwalda\". Barbara Yorke suggests that he died before Edwin converted to Christianity in 627 and also before Paulinus became Bishop of Northumbria in 625. His death is recorded twice by Roger of Wendover, in 599 and in 624, in a history that dates from the 13th century but appears to include earlier annals of unknown origin and reliability. Plunkett notes that the earlier date of 599 is now taken as a mistaken reference to the death of R\u00e6dwald's father, Tytila, and the later date is commonly given for the death of R\u00e6dwald.\nLegacy.\nIt was R\u00e6dwald's conversion to Christianity rather than his apostasy that was to take hold. He was succeeded by his pagan son Eorpwald although a pagan when he succeeded to the throne, converted to Christianity persuaded by Edwin of Northumbria. However it was not until Eorpwald's brother Sigeberht took the throne that the ruling house of East Anglia's conversion to Christianity became permanent.\nSutton Hoo.\nSince the excavation of Mound 1 in 1939 at Sutton Hoo, near Woodbridge, Suffolk there has been speculation that R\u00e6dwald was the person either buried or commemorated in the main chamber.\nR\u00e6dwald lived at a time when eminent individuals were buried in barrows at the cemetery at Sutton Hoo three still visible large mounds overlooking the upper estuary of the River Deben. In 1939 the largest mound at Sutton Hoo was found to contain a uniquely rich Anglo-Saxon ship-burial in the centre of which was a chamber containing grave goods for a very wealthy man with items pointing to imperial claims such as consular sceptre which may have been a symbol of the office of \"bretwalda\" and gold and garnet body-equipment which employed a goldsmith at the top level in Europe which could project an image of imperial power.\nThe symbolism and the wealth displayed point to the death of a person connected with the royal court, with Rupert Bruce-Mitford, first positing the burial as \"very likely the monument of the High King or \"bretwalda\" R\u00e6dwald\". Yorke suggests that the treasures buried with the ship reflect the size of the tribute paid to R\u00e6dwald by subject kings during his period as \"bretwalda\". Bruce-Mitford has suggested that the inclusion of bowls and spoons amongst the treasures fits with Bede's account of R\u00e6dwald's conversion: the spoons may have been a present for a convert from paganism and the bowls had Christian significance. Coins found in the burial have been dated to the approximate date of R\u00e6dwald's death. \nAlthough this is a likely explanation it is still controversial, as reflected in the comments in the article on R\u00e6dwald in the \"Oxford Dictionary of National Biography\" (\"It has been argued, more strongly than convincingly, that R\u00e6dwald must be the man buried in Mound 1 at Sutton Hoo\") and by McClure and Collins, who note that the evidence for R\u00e6dwald is \"almost non-existent\". Alternative suggestions as candidates include other East Anglian kings or a prestigious foreign visitor, or a wealthy status-seeker, rather than a king, though Rendlesham, a known residence of the East Anglian kings, is only away.\nSwedish cultural influence has been detected at Sutton Hoo: there are strong similarities in both the armour and the burial with Vendel Period finds from Sweden. Bruce-Mitford suggested that the connection is close enough to imply that the Wuffingas dynasty came from that part of Scandinavia. There are also significant differences, and exact parallels with the workmanship and style of the Sutton Hoo artefacts cannot be found elsewhere; as a result the connection is generally regarded as unproven.\nIf the mound is a cenotaph rather than a grave, this may mean R\u00e6dwald could have received a Christian burial with the mound, whether completed before or after his conversion, being used as a memorial and as symbol of the status of the Kingship of East Anglia.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n63. ^The Anglo-Saxons - A history of the beginnings of England by Marc Morris, p.\u00a068\nSources.\nPrimary sources\nSecondary sources"}

Most often, this kind of rhyming (\"perfect rhyming\") is consciously used for a musical or aesthetic effect in the final position of lines within poems or songs. More broadly, a rhyme may also variously refer to other types of similar sounds near the ends of two or more words. Furthermore, the word \"rhyme\" has come to be sometimes used as a shorthand term for any brief poem, such as a nursery rhyme or Balliol rhyme.\nEtymology.\nThe word derives from or , which might be derived from , a Germanic term meaning \"series\", or \"sequence\" attested in Old English (Old English: meaning \"enumeration\", series\", or \"numeral\") and , ultimately cognate to , ( \"number\"). Alternatively, the Old French words may derive from , from (, rhythm).\nThe spelling \"rhyme\" (from the original rime) was introduced at the beginning of the Modern English period from a scholarly but likely etymologically incorrect association with Latin . The older spelling \"rime\" survives in Modern English as a rare alternative spelling; cf. \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner\". A distinction between the spellings is also sometimes made in the study of linguistics and phonology for which \"rime\" or \"rhyme\" is used to refer to the \"nucleus\" and \"coda\" of a syllable. Some prefer to spell it \"rime\" to distinguish it from the poetic rhyme covered by this article (see \"syllable rime\").\nFunction of rhyming words.\nRhyme partly seems to be enjoyed simply as a repeating pattern that is pleasant to hear. Rhyme is a form of art that one can use to communicate to the reader or audience. It also serves as a powerful mnemonic device, facilitating short-term memory. The regular use of tail rhyme helps to mark off the ends of lines, thus clarifying the metrical structure for the listener. As with other poetic techniques, poets use it to suit their own purposes; for example, William Shakespeare often used a rhyming couplet to mark off the end of a scene in a play.\nTypes of rhyme.\nThe word \"rhyme\" can be used in a specific and a general sense. In the specific sense, two words rhyme if their final stressed vowel and all following sounds are identical; two lines of poetry rhyme if their final strong positions are filled with rhyming words. Examples are \"sight\" and \"flight\", \"deign\" and \"gain\", \"madness\" and \"sadness\", \"love\" and \"dove\".\nPerfect rhymes.\nPerfect rhymes can be classified by the location of the final stressed syllable.\nFeminine and dactylic rhymes may also be realized as compound (or mosaic) rhymes (\"poet\", \"know it\").\nGeneral rhymes.\nIn the general sense, \"general rhyme\" can refer to various kinds of phonetic similarity between words, and the use of such similar-sounding words in organizing verse. Rhymes in this general sense are classified according to the degree and manner of the phonetic similarity:\nIdentical rhymes.\nIdentical rhymes are considered less than perfect in English poetry; but are valued more highly in other literatures such as, for example, \"rime riche\" in French poetry.\nThough homophones and homonyms satisfy the first condition for rhyming\u2014that is, that the stressed vowel sound is the same\u2014they do not satisfy the second: that the preceding consonant be different. In a perfect rhyme, the last stressed vowel and all following sounds are identical in both words.\nIf the sound preceding the stressed vowel is also identical, the rhyme is sometimes considered to be inferior and not a perfect rhyme after all. An example of such a \"super-rhyme\" or \"more than perfect rhyme\" is the \"identical rhyme\", in which not only the vowels but also the onsets of the rhyming syllables are identical, as in \"gun\" and \"begun\". Punning rhymes, such as \"bare\" and \"bear\" are also identical rhymes. The rhyme may extend even farther back than the last stressed vowel. If it extends all the way to the beginning of the line, so that there are two lines that sound very similar or identical, it is called a \"holorhyme\" (\"For I scream/For ice cream\").\nIn poetics these would be considered \"identity\", rather than rhyme.\nEye rhyme.\nEye rhymes or sight rhymes or spelling rhymes refer to similarity in spelling but not in sound where the final sounds are spelled identically but pronounced differently. Examples in English are \"cough\", \"bough\", and \"love\", \"move\".\nSome early written poetry appears to contain these, but in many cases the words used rhymed at the time of writing, and subsequent changes in pronunciation have meant that the rhyme is now lost.\nMind rhyme.\nMind rhyme is a kind of substitution rhyme similar to rhyming slang, but it is less generally codified and is \"heard\" only when generated by a specific verse context. For instance, \"this sugar is neat / and tastes so sour.\" If a reader or listener anticipates the word \"sweet\" instead of \"sour\", a mind rhyme has occurred.\nClassification by position.\nRhymes may be classified according to their position in the verse:\nA rhyme scheme is the pattern of rhyming lines in a poem.\nHistory.\nIn many languages, including modern European languages and Arabic, poets use rhyme in set patterns as a structural element for specific poetic forms, such as ballads, sonnets and rhyming couplets. Some rhyming schemes have become associated with a specific language, culture or period, while other rhyming schemes have achieved use across languages, cultures or time periods. However, the use of structural rhyme is not universal even within the European tradition. Much modern poetry avoids traditional rhyme schemes.\nThe earliest surviving evidence of rhyming is the Chinese Shi Jing (ca. 10th century BCE). Rhyme is also occasionally used in the Bible. In classical Greek and Latin poetry, rhyme was only an occasional feature. For instance, Catullus includes partial rhymes in the poem \"Cui dono lepidum novum libellum\". The ancient Greeks knew rhyme, and rhymes in \"The Wasps\" by Aristophanes are noted by a translator.\nRhyme became a permanent - even obligatory - feature of poetry in Hebrew language, around the 4th century CE. It is found in the Jewish liturgical poetry written in the Byzantine empire era. This was realized by scholars only recently, thanks to the thousands of piyyuts that have been discovered in the Cairo Geniza. It is assumed that the principle of rhyme was transferred from Hebrew liturgical poetry to the poetry of the Syriac Christianity (written in Aramaic), and through this mediation introduced into Latin poetry and then into all other languages of Europe.\nRhyme is central to classical Arabic poetry tracing back to its pre-Islamic roots. According to some archaic sources, Irish literature introduced the rhyme to Early Medieval Europe, but that is a disputed claim. In the 7th century, the Irish had brought the art of rhyming verses to a high pitch of perfection. The leonine verse is notable for introducing rhyme into High Medieval literature in the 12th century.\nRhyme entered European poetry in the High Middle Ages under the influence of the Arabic language in Al Andalus (modern Spain). Arabic language poets used rhyme extensively from the first development of literary Arabic in the sixth century, as in their long, rhyming qasidas.\nSince dialects vary and languages change over time, lines that rhyme in a given register or era may not rhyme in another, and it may not be clear how one should pronounce the words so that they rhyme. An example is this couplet from Handel's Judas Maccabaeus:\nRejoice, O Judah, and in songs divine\nWith cherubim and seraphim harmonious join.\nRhyme in various languages.\nArabic.\nRhymes were widely spread in the Arabic language in pre-Islamic times, in letters, poems and songs, as well as long, rhyming qasidas. In addition, the Quran uses a form of rhymed prose named saj'.\nCeltic languages.\nRhyming in the Celtic languages takes a drastically different course from most other Western rhyming schemes despite strong contact with the Romance and English patterns. Even today, despite extensive interaction with English and French culture, Celtic rhyme continues to demonstrate native characteristics. Brian \u00d3 Cu\u00edv sets out the rules of rhyme in Irish poetry of the classical period: the last stressed vowel and any subsequent long vowels must be identical in order for two words to rhyme. Consonants are grouped into six classes for the purpose of rhyme: they need not be identical, but must belong to the same class. Thus 'b' and 'd' can rhyme (both being 'voiced plosives'), as can 'bh' and 'l' (which are both 'voiced continuants') but 'l', a 'voiced continuant', cannot rhyme with 'ph', a 'voiceless continuant'. Furthermore, \"for perfect rhyme a palatalized consonant may be balanced only by a palatalized consonant and a velarized consonant by a velarized one.\" In the post-Classical period, these rules fell out of use, and in popular verse simple assonance often suffices, as can be seen in an example of Irish Gaelic rhyme from the traditional song \"Br\u00edd \u00d3g N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Verse translation/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Screen reader-only/styles.css\" /&gt;Translation:\nHere the vowels are the same, but the consonants, although both palatalized, do not fall into the same class in the bardic rhyming scheme.\nChinese.\nBesides the vowel/consonant aspect of rhyming, Chinese rhymes often include tone quality (that is, tonal contour) as an integral linguistic factor in determining rhyme.\nUse of rhyme in Classical Chinese poetry typically but not always appears in the form of paired couplets, with end-rhyming in the final syllable of each couplet.\nAnother important aspect of rhyme in regard to Chinese language studies is the study or reconstruction of past varieties of Chinese, such as Middle Chinese.\nEnglish.\nOld English poetry is mostly alliterative verse. One of the earliest rhyming poems in English is The Rhyming Poem.\nAs stress is important in English, lexical stress is one of the factors that affects the similarity of sounds for the perception of rhyme. Perfect rhyme can be defined as the case when two words rhyme if their final stressed vowel and all following sounds are identical.\nSome words in English, such as \"orange\" and \"silver\", are commonly regarded as having no rhyme. Although a clever writer can get around this (for example, by obliquely rhyming \"orange\" with combinations of words like \"door hinge\" or \"more range\", or with lesser-known words like \"Blorenge\" [a hill in Wales], or the surname Gorringe). Because it is generally easier to move the word out of rhyming position or replace it with a synonym (\"orange\" could become \"amber\", while \"silver\" could become a combination of \"bright and argent\"). A skilled orator might be able to tweak the pronunciation of certain words to facilitate a stronger rhyme (for example, pronouncing \"orange\" as \"oringe\" to rhyme with \"door hinge\").\nOne view of rhyme in English is from John Milton's preface to \"Paradise Lost\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The Measure is \"English\" Heroic Verse without Rime, as that of \"Homer\" in \"Greek\", and of \"Virgil\" in \"Latin\"; Rime being no necessary Adjunct or true Ornament of Poem or good Verse, in longer Works especially, but the Invention of a barbarous Age, to set off wretched matter and lame Meeter; grac't indeed since by the use of some famous modern Poets, carried away by Custom\u00a0...\nA more tempered view is taken by W. H. Auden in The Dyer's Hand:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Rhymes, meters, stanza forms, etc., are like servants. If the master is fair enough to win their affection and firm enough to command their respect, the result is an orderly happy household. If he is too tyrannical, they give notice; if he lacks authority, they become slovenly, impertinent, drunk and dishonest.\nForced or clumsy rhyme is often a key ingredient of doggerel.\nFrench.\nIn French poetry, unlike in English, it is common to have \"identical rhymes\", in which not only the vowels of the final syllables of the lines rhyme, but their onset consonants (\"consonnes d'appui\") as well. To the ear of someone accustomed to English verse, this often sounds like a very weak rhyme. For example, an English perfect rhyme of homophones, \"flour\" and \"flower\", would seem weak, whereas a French rhyme of homophones \"doigt\" (\"finger\") and \"doit\" (\"must\") or \"point\" (\"point\") and \"point\" (\"not\") is not only acceptable but quite common.\nRhymes are sometimes classified into the categories of \"rime pauvre\" (\"poor rhyme\"), \"rime suffisante\" (\"sufficient rhyme\"), \"rime riche\" (\"rich rhyme\") and \"rime richissime\" (\"very rich rhyme\"), according to the number of rhyming sounds in the two words or in the parts of the two verses. For example, to rhyme \"tu\" with \"vu\" would be a poor rhyme (the words have only the vowel in common), to rhyme \"pas\" with \"bras\" a sufficient rhyme (with the vowel and the silent consonant in common), and \"tante\" with \"attente\" a rich rhyme (with the vowel, the onset consonant, and the coda consonant with its mute \"e\" in common). Authorities disagree, however, on exactly where to place the boundaries between the categories.\nClassical French rhyme not only differs from English rhyme in its different treatment of onset consonants. It also treats coda consonants in a distinctive way.\nFrench spelling includes several final letters that are no longer pronounced and that in many cases have never been pronounced. Such final unpronounced letters continue to affect rhyme according to the rules of Classical French versification.\nThe most important \"silent\" letter is the \"mute e\". In spoken French today, final \"e\" is, in some regional accents (in Paris for example), omitted after consonants; but in Classical French prosody, it was considered an integral part of the rhyme even when following the vowel. \"Joue\" could rhyme with \"boue\", but not with \"trou\". Rhyming words ending with this silent \"e\" were said to make up a \"double rhyme\", while words not ending with this silent \"e\" made up a \"single rhyme\". It was a principle of stanza-formation that single and double rhymes had to alternate in the stanza. Virtually all 17th-century French plays in verse alternate masculine and feminine couplets.\nThe now-silent final consonants present a more complex case. They, too, were traditionally an integral part of the rhyme, such that \"pont\" rhymed with \"vont\" but not with \"long\". (The voicing of consonants was lost in liaison and thus ignored, so \"pont\" also rhymed with \"rond\".) There are a few rules that govern most word-final consonants in archaic French pronunciation:\nHolorime.\n\"Holorime\" is an extreme example of \"rime richissime\" spanning an entire verse. Alphonse Allais was a notable exponent of holorime. Here is an example of a holorime couplet from Marc Monnier:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Verse translation/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Screen reader-only/styles.css\" /&gt;Translation:\nGerman.\nBecause German phonology features a wide array of vowel sounds, certain imperfect rhymes are widely admitted in German poetry. These include rhyming \"e\" with \"\u00e4\" and \"\u00f6\", rhyming \"i\" with \"\u00fc\", rhyming \"ei\" with \"eu\" (spelled \"\u00e4u\" in some words) and rhyming a long vowel with its short counterpart.\nSome examples of imperfect rhymes (all from Friedrich Schiller's \"An die Freude\"):\n\"See Homoioteleuton\"\nGreek.\nAncient Greek poetry was strictly metrical, based on matching the rhythms of syllables with long and short vowels between lines. Rhyme is used, if at all, only as an occasional rhetorical flourish.\nThe first Greek to write rhyming poetry was the fourteenth-century Cretan Stephanos Sachlikis. However in modern Greek poetry, rhyme is a common fixture.\nHebrew.\nAncient Hebrew rarely employed rhyme, e.g., in Exodus 29 35: \u05d5\u05e2\u05e9\u05d9\u05ea \u05dc\u05d0\u05d4\u05e8\u05df \u05d5\u05dc\u05d1\u05e0\u05d9\u05d5 \u05db\u05b8\u05bc\u05db\u05d4, \u05db\u05db\u05dc \u05d0\u05e9\u05e8 \u05e6\u05d5\u05d9\u05ea\u05d9 \u05d0\u05b9\u05ea\u05b8\u05db\u05d4 (the identical part in both rhyming words being / 'axa/ ). Rhyme became a permanent - even obligatory - feature of poetry in Hebrew language, around the 4th century CE. It is found in the Jewish liturgical poetry written in the Byzantine empire era. This was realized by scholars only recently, thanks to the thousands of piyyuts that have been discovered in the Cairo Geniza. It is assumed that the principle of rhyme was transferred from Hebrew liturgical poetry to the poetry of the Syriac Christianity (written in Aramaic), and through this mediation introduced into Latin poetry and then into all other languages of Europe.\nLatin.\nIn Latin rhetoric and poetry homeoteleuton and alliteration were frequently used devices.\nTail rhyme was occasionally used, as in this piece of poetry by Cicero:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Verse translation/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Screen reader-only/styles.css\" /&gt;Translation:\nBut tail rhyme was not used as a prominent structural feature of Latin poetry until it was introduced under the influence of local vernacular traditions in the early Middle Ages. This is the Latin hymn \"Dies Irae\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Verse translation/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Screen reader-only/styles.css\" /&gt;Translation:\nMedieval poetry may mix Latin and vernacular languages. Mixing languages in verse or rhyming words in different languages is termed macaronic.\nPolish.\nIn Polish literature rhyme was used from the beginning. Unrhymed verse was never popular, although it was sometimes imitated from Latin. Homer's, Virgil's and even Milton's epic poems were furnished with rhymes by Polish translators. Because of paroxytonic accentuation in Polish, feminine rhymes always prevailed. Rules of Polish rhyme were established in 16th century. Then only feminine rhymes were allowed in syllabic verse system. Together with introducing syllabo-accentual metres, masculine rhymes began to occur in Polish poetry. They were most popular at the end of 19th century. The most frequent rhyme scheme in Old Polish (16th - 18th centuries) was couplet AABBCCDD..., but Polish poets, having perfect knowledge of Italian language and literature, experimented with other schemes, among others ottava rima (ABABABCC) and sonnet (ABBA ABBA CDC DCD or ABBA ABBA CDCD EE).\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Verse translation/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\u2014Adam Mickiewicz,&lt;br&gt;\", \", lines 1\u20134\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Screen reader-only/styles.css\" /&gt;Translation:\u2014\"The Ackerman Steppe\", \"Sonnets from the Crimea\",&lt;br&gt;translated by Edna Worthley Underwood\nThe metre of Mickiewicz's sonnet is the Polish alexandrine (tridecasyllable, in Polish \"trzynastozg\u0142oskowiec\"): 13(7+6) and its rhymes are feminine: [anu] and [odzi].\nPortuguese.\nPortuguese classifies rhymes in the following manner:\nRussian.\nRhyme was introduced into Russian poetry in the 18th century. Folk poetry had generally been unrhymed, relying more on dactylic line endings for effect. Two words ending in an accented vowel are only considered to rhyme if they share a preceding consonant. Vowel pairs rhyme\u2014even though non-Russian speakers may not perceive them as the same sound. Consonant pairs rhyme if both are devoiced. As in French, formal poetry traditionally alternates between masculine and feminine rhymes.\nEarly 18th-century poetry demanded perfect rhymes that were also grammatical rhymes\u2014namely that noun endings rhymed with noun endings, verb endings with verb endings, and so on. Such rhymes relying on morphological endings become much rarer in modern Russian poetry, and greater use is made of approximate rhymes.\nThe rules for rhyming used by Alexander Pushkin and subsequent Russian poets owe much to French verse. The basic rules, as laid out by Vladimir Nabokov in his \"Notes on Prosody\", are as follows:\nSanskrit.\nPatterns of rich rhyme (\"pr\u0101sa\") play a role in modern Sanskrit poetry, but only to a minor extent in historical Sanskrit texts. They are classified according to their position within the \"pada\" (metrical foot): \"\u0101dipr\u0101sa\" (first syllable), \"dvit\u012by\u0101k\u1e63ara pr\u0101sa\" (second syllable), \"antyapr\u0101sa\" (final syllable) etc.\nSpanish.\nSpanish mainly differentiates two types of rhymes:\nSpanish rhyme is also classified by stress type since different types cannot rhyme with each other:\nTamil.\nThere are some unique rhyming schemes in Dravidian languages like Tamil. Specifically, the rhyme called \"etukai\" (anaphora) occurs on the second consonant of each line.\nThe other rhyme and related patterns are called \"m\u014dnai\" (alliteration), \"to\u1e6dai\" (epiphora) and \"ira\u1e6d\u1e6dai ki\u1e37avi\" (parallelism).\nSome classical Tamil poetry forms, such as \"ve\u1e47p\u0101\", have rigid grammars for rhyme to the point that they could be expressed as a context-free grammar.\nUrdu.\nRhymes are called Qafiya in Urdu. Qafiya has a very important place in Urdu Poetry. No couplet of Urdu Ghazal is complete without a Qafiya. Following is an example of an Urdu couplet from Faiz Ahmed Faiz's ghazal\ndono jahaan teri mohabbat mein \"haar\" ke,&lt;br&gt;\nwo jaa rahaa hai koi shab e ghum \"guzaar\" ke\n\"haar\" and \"guzaar\" are qafiyas in this couplet because of rhyming.\nVietnamese.\nRhymes are used in Vietnamese to produce similes. The following is an example of a Rhyming Simile:\nNgh\u00e8o nh\u01b0 con m\u00e8o\n&lt;br&gt;/\u014b\u025bu \u0272\u026f k\u0254n m\u025bu/ \n&lt;br&gt;\"Poor as a cat\"\nCompare the above Vietnamese example, which is a \"rhyming\" simile, to the English phrase \"(as) poor as a church mouse\", which is only a \"semantic\" simile.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

This general meaning of regular recurrence or pattern in time can apply to a wide variety of cyclical natural phenomena having a periodicity or frequency of anything from microseconds to several seconds (as with the riff in a rock music song); to several minutes or hours, or, at the most extreme, even over many years.\nThe Oxford English Dictionary defines rhythm as \"The measured flow of words or phrases in verse, forming various patterns of sound as determined by the relation of long and short or stressed and unstressed syllables in a metrical foot or line; an instance of this\".\nRhythm is related to and distinguished from pulse, meter, and beats:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Rhythm may be defined as the way in which one or more unaccented beats are grouped in relation to an accented one. ... A rhythmic group can be apprehended only when its elements are distinguished from one another, rhythm...always involves an interrelationship between a single, accented (strong) beat and either one or two unaccented (weak) beats.\nIn the performance arts, rhythm is the timing of events on a human scale; of musical sounds and silences that occur over time, of the steps of a dance, or the meter of spoken language and poetry. In some performing arts, such as hip hop music, the rhythmic delivery of the lyrics is one of the most important elements of the style. Rhythm may also refer to visual presentation, as \"timed movement through space\" and a common language of pattern unites rhythm with geometry. For example, architects can speak of the rhythm of a building, referring to patterns in the spacing of windows, columns, and other elements of the fa\u00e7ade. Rhythm and meter have become an important area of research among music scholars. Recent work in these areas includes books by Maury Yeston, Fred Lerdahl, Ray Jackendoff, Godfried Toussaint, William Rothstein, Joel Lester, Guerino Mazzola, and Steffen Krebber.\nAnthropology.\nIn his television series \"How Music Works\", Howard Goodall presents theories that human rhythm recalls the regularity with which we walk and the heartbeat. Other research suggests that it does not relate to the heartbeat directly, but rather the speed of emotional affect, which also influences heartbeat. Yet other researchers suggest that since certain features of human music are widespread, it is \"reasonable to suspect that beat-based rhythmic processing has ancient evolutionary roots\". Justin London writes that musical metre \"involves our initial perception as well as subsequent anticipation of a series of beats that we abstract from the rhythm surface of the music as it unfolds in time\". The \"perception\" and \"abstraction\" of rhythmic measure is the foundation of human instinctive musical participation, as when we divide a series of identical clock-ticks into \"tick-tock-tick-tock\".\n&lt;score raw=\"1\" sound=\"1\"&gt;\n\\version \"2.22.0\"\n\\score {\n \\repeat volta 2 {\n \\tempo 4 = 80-160\n \\bar \". A simple [quadr]duple drum pattern, which lays a foundation of duration common in popular music\nJoseph Jordania recently suggested that the sense of rhythm was developed in the early stages of hominid evolution by the forces of natural selection. Plenty of animals walk rhythmically and hear the sounds of the heartbeat in the womb, but only humans have the ability to be engaged (entrained) in rhythmically coordinated vocalizations and other activities. According to Jordania, development of the sense of rhythm was central for the achievement of the specific neurological state of the battle trance, crucial for the development of the effective defense system of early hominids. Rhythmic war cry, rhythmic drumming by shamans, rhythmic drilling of the soldiers and contemporary professional combat forces listening to the heavy rhythmic rock music all use the ability of rhythm to unite human individuals into a shared collective identity where group members put the interests of the group above their individual interests and safety.\nSome types of parrots can know rhythm. Neurologist Oliver Sacks states that chimpanzees and other animals show no similar appreciation of rhythm yet posits that human affinity for rhythm is fundamental, so that a person's sense of rhythm cannot be lost (e.g. by stroke). \"There is not a single report of an animal being trained to tap, peck, or move in synchrony with an auditory beat\", Sacks write, \"No doubt many pet lovers will dispute this notion, and indeed many animals, from the Lipizzaner horses of the Spanish Riding School of Vienna to performing circus animals appear to 'dance' to music. It is not clear whether they are doing so or are responding to subtle visual or tactile cues from the humans around them.\" Human rhythmic arts are possibly to some extent rooted in courtship ritual.\nThe establishment of a basic beat requires the perception of a regular sequence of distinct short-duration pulses and, as a subjective perception of loudness is relative to background noise levels, a pulse must decay to silence before the next occurs if it is to be really distinct. For this reason, the fast-transient sounds of percussion instruments lend themselves to the definition of rhythm. Musical cultures that rely upon such instruments may develop multi-layered polyrhythm and simultaneous rhythms in more than one time signature, called polymeter. Such are the cross-rhythms of Sub-Saharan Africa and the interlocking \"kotekan\" rhythms of the gamelan.\nFor information on rhythm in Indian music see Tala (music). For other Asian approaches to rhythm see Rhythm in Persian music, Rhythm in Arabic music and \"Usul\"\u2014Rhythm in Turkish music and Dumbek rhythms.\nTerminology.\nPulse, beat and measure.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;As a piece of music unfolds, its rhythmic structure is perceived not as a series of discrete independent units strung together in a mechanical, additive, way like beads [or \"pulses\"], but as an organic process in which smaller rhythmic motives, whole possessing a shape and structure of their own, also function as integral parts of a larger [\"architectonic\"] rhythmic organization.\nMost music, dance and oral poetry establishes and maintains an underlying \"metric level\", a basic unit of time that may be audible or implied, the pulse or \"tactus\" of the mensural level, or \"beat level\", sometimes simply called the beat. This consists of a (repeating) series of identical yet distinct periodic short-duration stimuli perceived as points in time. The \"beat\" pulse is not necessarily the fastest or the slowest component of the rhythm but the one that is perceived as fundamental: it has a tempo to which listeners entrain as they tap their foot or dance to a piece of music. It is currently most often designated as a crotchet or quarter note in western notation (see time signature). Faster levels are \"division levels\", and slower levels are \"multiple levels\". Maury Yeston clarified \"Rhythms of recurrence\" arise from the interaction of two levels of motion, the faster providing the pulse and the slower organizing the beats into repetitive groups. \"Once a metric hierarchy has been established, we, as listeners, will maintain that organization as long as minimal evidence is present\".\nUnit and gesture.\nA durational pattern that synchronises with a pulse or pulses on the underlying metric level may be called a \"rhythmic unit\". These may be classified as:\n&lt;score lang=\"lilypond\" sound=\"1\"&gt;\n \\new RhythmicStaff {\n \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\tempo 8 = 108\n \\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\"woodblock\"\n \\xNotesOn\n \\time 2/4\n \\bar \" From left to right: \"metric\", \"intrametric\", \"contrametric\", and \"extrametric\" rhythmic units\nA rhythmic gesture is any durational pattern that, in contrast to the rhythmic unit, does not occupy a period of time equivalent to a pulse or pulses on an underlying metric level. It may be described according to its beginning and ending or by the rhythmic units it contains. Rhythms that begin on a strong pulse are \"thetic\", those beginning on a weak pulse are \"anacrustic\" and those beginning after a rest or tied-over note are called \"initial rest\". Endings on a strong pulse are \"strong\", on a weak pulse, \"weak\" and those that end on a strong or weak upbeat are \"upbeat\".\nAlternation and repetition.\nRhythm is marked by the regulated succession of opposite elements: the dynamics of the strong and weak beat, the played beat and the inaudible but implied rest beat, or the long and short note. As well as perceiving rhythm humans must be able to anticipate it. This depends on repetition of a pattern that is short enough to memorize.\nThe alternation of the strong and weak beat is fundamental to the ancient language of poetry, dance and music. The common poetic term \"foot\" refers, as in dance, to the lifting and tapping of the foot in time. In a similar way musicians speak of an upbeat and a downbeat and of the \"on\" and \"off\" beat. These contrasts naturally facilitate a dual hierarchy of rhythm and depend on repeating patterns of duration, accent and rest forming a \"pulse-group\" that corresponds to the poetic foot. Normally such pulse-groups are defined by taking the most accented beat as the first and counting the pulses until the next accent. A rhythm that accents another beat and de-emphasises the downbeat as established or assumed from the melody or from a preceding rhythm is called syncopated rhythm.\nNormally, even the most complex of meters may be broken down into a chain of duple and triple pulses either by addition or division. According to Pierre Boulez, beat structures beyond four, in western music, are \"simply not natural\".\nTempo and duration.\nThe tempo of the piece is the speed or frequency of the \"tactus\", a measure of how quickly the beat flows. This is often measured in 'beats per minute' (bpm): 60\u00a0bpm means a speed of one beat per second, a frequency of 1\u00a0Hz. A rhythmic unit is a durational pattern that has a period equivalent to a pulse or several pulses. The duration of any such unit is inversely related to its tempo.\nMusical sound may be analyzed on five different time scales, which Moravscik has arranged in order of increasing duration.\nCurtis Roads takes a wider view by distinguishing nine-time scales, this time in order of decreasing duration. The first two, the infinite and the supra musical, encompass natural periodicities of months, years, decades, centuries, and greater, while the last three, the sample and subsample, which take account of digital and electronic rates \"too brief to be properly recorded or perceived\", measured in millionths of seconds (microseconds), and finally the infinitesimal or infinitely brief, are again in the extra-musical domain. Roads' Macro level, encompassing \"overall musical architecture or form\" roughly corresponds to Moravcsik's \"very long\" division while his Meso level, the level of \"divisions of form\" including movements, sections, phrases taking seconds or minutes, is likewise similar to Moravcsik's \"long\" category. Roads' Sound object: \"a basic unit of musical structure\" and a generalization of note (Xenakis' mini structural time scale); fraction of a second to several seconds, and his Microsound (see granular synthesis) down to the threshold of audible perception; thousandths to millionths of seconds, are similarly comparable to Moravcsik's \"short\" and \"supershort\" levels of duration.\nRhythm\u2013tempo interaction.\nOne difficulty in defining rhythm is the dependence of its perception on tempo, and, conversely, the dependence of tempo perception on rhythm. Furthermore, the rhythm\u2013tempo interaction is context dependent, as explained by Andranik Tangian using an example of the leading rhythm of \"Promenade\" from Moussorgsky's \"Pictures at an Exhibition\":\nThis rhythm is perceived as it is, rather than as the first three events repeated at a double tempo (denoted as R012 = repeat from 0, one time, twice faster):\nR012\nHowever, the motive with this rhythm in the Moussorgsky's piece\nis rather perceived as a repeat\nR012\nThis context-dependent perception of rhythm is explained by the principle of correlative perception, according to which data are perceived in the simplest way. From Kolmogorov's complexity theory, this means a representation of the data that minimizes the amount of memory.\nThe example considered suggests two alternative representations of the same rhythm: as it is, and as the rhythm-tempo interaction \u2013 a two-level representation in terms of a generative rhythmic pattern and a \"tempo curve\". Table 1 displays these possibilities both with and without pitch, assuming that one duration requires one byte of information, one byte is needed for the pitch of one tone, and invoking the repeat algorithm with its parameters R012 takes four bytes. As shown in the bottom row of the table, the rhythm without pitch requires fewer bytes if it is \"perceived\" as it is, without repetitions and tempo leaps. On the contrary, its melodic version requires fewer bytes if the rhythm is \"perceived\" as being repeated at a double tempo.\nThus, the loop of interdependence of rhythm and tempo is overcome due to the simplicity criterion, which \"optimally\" distributes the complexity of perception between rhythm and tempo. In the above example, the repetition is recognized because of additional repetition of the melodic contour, which results in a redundancy of the musical structure, making the recognition of the rhythmic pattern \"robust\" under tempo deviations. Generally speaking, the more redundant the \"musical support\" of a rhythmic pattern, the better its recognizability under augmentations and diminutions, that is, its distortions are perceived as tempo variations rather than rhythmic changes:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;By taking into account melodic context, homogeneity of accompaniment, harmonic pulsation, and other cues, the range of admissible tempo deviations can be extended further, yet still not preventing musically normal perception. For example, Skrjabin's own performance of his \"Poem\" op. 32 no. 1 transcribed from a piano-roll recording contains tempo deviations within . \n 19/119, a span of 5.5 times. Such tempo deviations are strictly prohibited, for example, in Bulgarian or Turkish music based on so-called additive rhythms with complex duration ratios, which can also be explained by the principle of correlativity of perception. If a rhythm is not structurally redundant, then even minor tempo deviations are not perceived as \"accelerando\" or \"ritardando\" but rather given an impression of a change in rhythm, which implies an inadequate perception of musical meaning.\nMetric structure.\nThe study of rhythm, stress, and pitch in speech is called prosody (see also: prosody (music)): it is a topic in linguistics and poetics, where it means the number of lines in a verse, the number of syllables in each line and the arrangement of those syllables as long or short, accented or unaccented. Music inherited the term \"meter or metre\" from the terminology of poetry.)\nThe metric structure of music includes meter, tempo and all other rhythmic aspects that produce temporal regularity against which the foreground details or durational patterns of the music are projected. The terminology of western music is notoriously imprecise in this area. MacPherson preferred to speak of \"time\" and \"rhythmic shape\", Imogen Holst of \"measured rhythm\".\nDance music has instantly recognizable patterns of beats built upon a characteristic tempo and measure. The Imperial Society of Teachers of Dancing defines the tango, for example, as to be danced in time at approximately 66 beats per minute. The basic slow step forwards or backwards, lasting for one beat, is called a \"slow\", so that a full \"right\u2013left\" step is equal to one measure. (\"See Rhythm and dance\".)\nThe general classifications of \"metrical rhythm\", \"measured rhythm\", and \"free rhythm\" may be distinguished. Metrical or divisive rhythm, by far the most common in Western music calculates each time value as a multiple or fraction of the beat. Normal accents re-occur regularly providing systematical grouping (measures). Measured rhythm (additive rhythm) also calculates each time value as a multiple or fraction of a specified time unit but the accents do not recur regularly within the cycle. Free rhythm is where there is neither, such as in Christian chant, which has a basic pulse but a freer rhythm, like the rhythm of prose compared to that of verse. \"See Free time (music)\".\nFinally some music, such as some graphically scored works since the 1950s and non-European music such as Honkyoku repertoire for shakuhachi, may be considered \"ametric\". \"Senza misura\" is an Italian musical term for \"without meter\", meaning to play without a beat, using time to measure how long it will take to play the bar.\nComposite rhythm.\nA composite rhythm is the durations and patterns (rhythm) produced by amalgamating all sounding parts of a musical texture. In music of the common practice period, the composite rhythm usually confirms the meter, often in metric or even-note patterns identical to the pulse on a specific metric level. White defines \"composite rhythm\" as, \"the resultant overall rhythmic articulation among all the voices of a contrapuntal texture\". This concept was concurrently defined as \"attack point rhythm\" by Maury Yeston in 1976 as \"the extreme rhythmic foreground of a composition \u2013 the absolute surface of articulated movement\".\nCounter rhythm.\nFrom 1927 and forward the recognized definition of \"Counter Rhythm\" is \"A subordinate rhythm acting as a counterbalance to the main rhythm\" (OED). Counter Rhythm is not a common word or phrase in the English Language, appearing approximately 0.01 times per million words in modern written English. Counter Rhythm has been on a steady decrease in usage since its conception, with the exception of a spike in usage in the 1970s. Previous definitions that have been phased out include, \"The musical counter-rhythms which Marlowe introduced\" and \"Splashes of counter-rhythms, flashing tremolos\" (OED).\nIn different traditions.\nAfrican.\nIn the Griot tradition of Africa everything related to music has been passed on orally. Babatunde Olatunji (1927\u20132003) developed a simple series of spoken sounds for teaching the rhythms of the hand-drum, using six vocal sounds, \"Goon, Doon, Go, Do, Pa, Ta\", for three basic sounds on the drum, each played with either the left or the right hand. The debate about the appropriateness of staff notation for African music is a subject of particular interest to outsiders while African scholars from Kyagambiddwa to Kongo have, for the most part, accepted the conventions and limitations of staff notation, and produced transcriptions to inform and enable discussion and debate.\nJohn Miller has argued that West African music is based on the tension between rhythms, polyrhythms created by the simultaneous sounding of two or more different rhythms, generally one dominant rhythm interacting with one or more independent competing rhythms. These often oppose or complement each other and the dominant rhythm. Moral values underpin a musical system based on repetition of relatively simple patterns that meet at distant cross-rhythmic intervals and on call-and-response form. Collective utterances such as proverbs or lineages appear either in phrases translated into \"drum talk\" or in the words of songs. People expect musicians to stimulate participation by reacting to people dancing. Appreciation of musicians is related to the effectiveness of their upholding community values.\nIndian.\nIndian music has also been passed on orally. Tabla players would learn to speak complex rhythm patterns and phrases before attempting to play them. Sheila Chandra, an English pop singer of Indian descent, made performances based on her singing these patterns. In Indian classical music, the Tala of a composition is the rhythmic pattern over which the whole piece is structured.\nWestern.\nIn the 20th century, composers like Igor Stravinsky, B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k, Philip Glass, and Steve Reich wrote more rhythmically complex music using odd meters, and techniques such as phasing and additive rhythm. At the same time, modernists such as Olivier Messiaen and his pupils used increased complexity to disrupt the sense of a regular beat, leading eventually to the widespread use of irrational rhythms in New Complexity. This use may be explained by a comment of John Cage's where he notes that regular rhythms cause sounds to be heard as a group rather than individually; the irregular rhythms highlight the rapidly changing pitch relationships that would otherwise be subsumed into irrelevant rhythmic groupings. La Monte Young also wrote music in which the sense of a regular beat is absent because the music consists only of long sustained tones (drones). In the 1930s, Henry Cowell wrote music involving multiple simultaneous periodic rhythms and collaborated with Leon Theremin to invent the rhythmicon, the first electronic rhythm machine, in order to perform them. Similarly, Conlon Nancarrow wrote for the player piano.\nLinguistics.\nIn linguistics, rhythm or isochrony is one of the three aspects of prosody, along with stress and intonation. Languages can be categorized according to whether they are syllable-timed, mora-timed, or stress-timed. Speakers of syllable-timed languages such as Spanish and Cantonese put roughly equal time on each syllable; in contrast, speakers of stressed-timed languages such as English and Mandarin Chinese put roughly equal time lags between stressed syllables, with the timing of the unstressed syllables in between them being adjusted to accommodate the stress timing.\nNarmour describes three categories of prosodic rules that create rhythmic successions that are additive (same duration repeated), cumulative (short-long), or countercumulative (long-short). Cumulation is associated with closure or relaxation, countercumulation with openness or tension, while additive rhythms are open-ended and repetitive. Richard Middleton points out this method cannot account for syncopation and suggests the concept of transformation.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is essential to the formation of two major coenzymes, flavin mononucleotide and flavin adenine dinucleotide. These coenzymes are involved in energy metabolism, cellular respiration, and antibody production, as well as normal growth and development. The coenzymes are also required for the metabolism of niacin, vitamin B6, and folate. Riboflavin is prescribed to treat corneal thinning, and taken orally, may reduce the incidence of migraine headaches in adults.\nRiboflavin deficiency is rare and is usually accompanied by deficiencies of other vitamins and nutrients. It may be prevented or treated by oral supplements or by injections. As a water-soluble vitamin, any riboflavin consumed in excess of nutritional requirements is not stored; it is either not absorbed or is absorbed and quickly excreted in urine, causing the urine to have a bright yellow tint. Natural sources of riboflavin include meat, fish and fowl, eggs, dairy products, green vegetables, mushrooms, and almonds. Some countries require its addition to grains.\nIn its purified, solid form, it is a water-soluble yellow-orange crystalline powder. In addition to its function as a vitamin, it is used as a food coloring agent. Biosynthesis takes place in bacteria, fungi and plants, but not animals. Industrial synthesis of riboflavin was initially achieved using a chemical process, but current commercial manufacturing relies on fermentation methods using strains of fungi and genetically modified bacteria.\nIn 2023, riboflavin was the 294th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 400,000 prescriptions.\nDefinition.\nRiboflavin, also known as vitamin B2, is a water-soluble vitamin and is one of the B vitamins. Unlike folate and vitamin B6, which occur in several chemically related forms known as vitamers, riboflavin is only one chemical compound. It is a starting compound in the synthesis of the coenzymes flavin mononucleotide (FMN, also known as riboflavin-5'-phosphate) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD). FAD is the more abundant form of flavin, reported to bind to 75% of the number of flavin-dependent protein encoded genes in the all-species genome (the flavoproteome) and serves as a co-enzyme for 84% of human-encoded flavoproteins.\nIn its purified, solid form, riboflavin is a yellow-orange crystalline powder with a slight odor and bitter taste. It is soluble in polar solvents, such as water and aqueous sodium chloride solutions, and slightly soluble in alcohols. It is not soluble in non-polar or weakly polar organic solvents such as chloroform, benzene or acetone. In solution or during dry storage as a powder, riboflavin is heat stable if not exposed to light. When heated to decompose, it releases toxic fumes containing nitric oxide.\nFunctions.\nRiboflavin is essential to the formation of two major coenzymes, FMN and FAD. These coenzymes are involved in energy metabolism, cell respiration, antibody production, growth and development. Riboflavin is essential for the metabolism of carbohydrates, protein and fats. FAD contributes to the conversion of tryptophan to niacin (vitamin B3) and the conversion of vitamin B6 to the coenzyme pyridoxal 5'-phosphate requires FMN. Riboflavin is involved in maintaining normal circulating levels of homocysteine; in riboflavin deficiency, homocysteine levels increase, elevating the risk of cardiovascular diseases.\nRedox reactions.\nRedox reactions are processes that involve the transfer of electrons. The flavin coenzymes support the function of roughly 70-80 flavoenzymes in humans (and hundreds more across all organisms, including those encoded by archeal, bacterial and fungal genomes) that are responsible for one- or two-electron redox reactions which capitalize on the ability of flavins to be converted between oxidized, half-reduced and fully reduced forms. FAD is also required for the activity of glutathione reductase, an essential enzyme in the formation of the endogenous antioxidant, glutathione.\nMicronutrient metabolism.\nRiboflavin, FMN, and FAD are involved in the metabolism of niacin, vitamin B6, and folate. The synthesis of the niacin-containing coenzymes, NAD and NADP, from tryptophan involves the FAD-dependent enzyme, kynurenine 3-monooxygenase. Dietary deficiency of riboflavin can decrease the production of NAD and NADP, thereby promoting niacin deficiency. Conversion of vitamin B6 to its coenzyme, pyridoxal 5'-phosphate, involves the enzyme, pyridoxine 5'-phosphate oxidase, which requires FMN. An enzyme involved in folate metabolism, 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase, requires FAD to form the amino acid, methionine, from homocysteine.\nRiboflavin deficiency appears to impair the metabolism of the dietary mineral, iron, which is essential to the production of hemoglobin and red blood cells. Alleviating riboflavin deficiency in people who are deficient in both riboflavin and iron improves the effectiveness of iron supplementation for treating iron-deficiency anemia.\nSynthesis.\nBiosynthesis.\nBiosynthesis takes place in bacteria, fungi and plants, but not animals. The biosynthetic precursors to riboflavin are ribulose 5-phosphate and guanosine triphosphate. The former is converted to L-3,4-dihydroxy-2-butanone-4-phosphate. Guanosine is degraded to 4-hydroxy-2,4,5-triaminopyrimidine, which is transformed into 5-amino-6-(D-ribitylamino)uracil. These two compounds are then the substrates for the penultimate step in the pathway, catalysed by the enzyme lumazine synthase in reaction EC https://.\nIn the final step of the biosynthesis, two molecules of 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine are combined by the enzyme riboflavin synthase in a dismutation reaction. This generates one molecule of riboflavin and one of 5-amino-6-(D-ribitylamino) uracil. The latter is recycled to the previous reaction in the sequence.\nConversions of riboflavin to the cofactors FMN and FAD are carried out by the enzymes riboflavin kinase and FAD synthetase acting sequentially.\nIndustrial synthesis.\nThe industrial-scale production of riboflavin uses various microorganisms, including filamentous fungi such as \"Ashbya gossypii\", \"Candida famata\" and \"Candida flaveri\", as well as the bacteria \"Corynebacterium ammoniagenes\" and \"Bacillus subtilis\". \"B. subtilis\" that has been genetically modified to both increase the production of riboflavin and to introduce an antibiotic (ampicillin) resistance marker, is employed at a commercial scale to produce riboflavin for feed and food fortification. By 2012, over 4,000 tonnes per annum were produced by such fermentation processes.\nIn the presence of high concentrations of hydrocarbons or aromatic compounds, some bacteria overproduce riboflavin, possibly as a protective mechanism. One such organism is \"Micrococcus luteus\" (American Type Culture Collection strain number ATCC 49442), which develops a yellow color due to production of riboflavin while growing on pyridine, but not when grown on other substrates, such as succinic acid.\nLaboratory synthesis.\nThe first total synthesis of riboflavin was carried out by Richard Kuhn's group. A substituted aniline, produced by reductive amination using D-ribose, was condensed with alloxan in the final step:\nUses.\nTreatment of corneal thinning.\nKeratoconus is the most common form of corneal ectasia, a progressive thinning of the cornea. The condition is treated by corneal collagen cross-linking, which increases corneal stiffness. Cross-linking is achieved by applying a topical riboflavin solution to the cornea, which is then exposed to ultraviolet A light.\nMigraine prevention.\nIn its 2012 guidelines, the American Academy of Neurology stated that high-dose riboflavin (400\u00a0mg) is \"probably effective and should be considered for migraine prevention,\" a recommendation also provided by the UK National Migraine Centre. A 2017 review reported that daily riboflavin taken at 400\u00a0mg per day for at least three months may reduce the frequency of migraine headaches in adults. Research on high-dose riboflavin for migraine prevention or treatment in children and adolescents is inconclusive, and so supplements are not recommended.\nFood coloring.\nRiboflavin is used as a food coloring (yellow-orange crystalline powder), and is designated with the E number, E101, in Europe for use as a food additive.\nDietary recommendations.\nThe National Academy of Medicine updated the Estimated Average Requirements (EARs) and Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for riboflavin in 1998. The EARs[ [update]] for riboflavin for women and men aged 14 and over are 0.9\u00a0mg/day and 1.1\u00a0mg/day, respectively; the RDAs are 1.1 and 1.3\u00a0mg/day, respectively. RDAs are higher than EARs to provide adequate intake levels for individuals with higher than average requirements. The RDA during pregnancy is 1.4\u00a0mg/day and the RDA for lactating females is 1.6\u00a0mg/day. For infants up to the age of 12 months, the Adequate Intake (AI) is 0.3\u20130.4\u00a0mg/day and for children aged 1\u201313 years the RDA increases with age from 0.5 to 0.9\u00a0mg/day. As for safety, the IOM sets tolerable upper intake levels (ULs) for vitamins and minerals when evidence is sufficient. In the case of riboflavin there is no UL, as there is no human data for adverse effects from high doses. Collectively the EARs, RDAs, AIs and ULs are referred to as Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs).\nThe European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) refers to the collective set of information as Dietary Reference Values, with Population Reference Intake (PRI) instead of RDA, and Average Requirement instead of EAR. AI and UL are defined the same as in United States. For women and men aged 15 and older the PRI is set at 1.6\u00a0mg/day. The PRI during pregnancy is 1.9\u00a0mg/day and the PRI for lactating females is 2.0\u00a0mg/day. For children aged 1\u201314 years the PRIs increase with age from 0.6 to 1.4\u00a0mg/day. These PRIs are higher than the U.S. RDAs. The EFSA also considered the maximum safe intake and like the U.S. National Academy of Medicine, decided that there was not sufficient information to set an UL.\nSafety.\nIn humans, there is no evidence for riboflavin toxicity produced by excessive intakes and absorption becomes less efficient as dosage increases. Any excess riboflavin is excreted via the kidneys into urine, resulting in a bright yellow color known as flavinuria. During a clinical trial on the effectiveness of riboflavin for treating the frequency and severity of migraines, subjects were given up to 400\u00a0mg of riboflavin orally per day for periods of 3\u201312 months. Abdominal pains and diarrhea were among the side effects reported.\nLabeling.\nFor U.S. food and dietary supplement labeling purposes the amount in a serving is expressed as a percent of Daily Value (%DV). For riboflavin labeling purposes 100% of the Daily Value was 1.7\u00a0mg, but as of 27 May 2016, it was revised to 1.3\u00a0mg to bring it into agreement with the RDA. A table of the old and new adult daily values is provided at Reference Daily Intake.\nSources.\nThe United States Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service maintains a food composition database from which riboflavin content in hundreds of foods can be searched.\nThe white flour produced after milling of wheat has only 67% of its original riboflavin amount left, so white flour is enriched in some countries. Riboflavin is also added to ready-to-eat breakfast cereals. It is difficult to incorporate riboflavin into liquid products because it has poor solubility in water, hence the requirement for riboflavin-5'-phosphate (FMN, also called E101 when used as colorant), a more soluble form of riboflavin. The enrichment of bread and ready-to-eat breakfast cereals contributes significantly to the dietary supply of the vitamin. Free riboflavin is naturally present in animal-sourced foods along with protein-bound FMN and FAD. Cows' milk contains mainly free riboflavin, but both FMN and FAD are present at low concentrations.\nFortification.\nSome countries require or recommend fortification of grain foods. As of 2024, 57 countries, mostly in North and South America and southeast Africa, require food fortification of wheat flour or maize (corn) flour with riboflavin or riboflavin-5'-phosphate sodium. The amounts stipulated range from 1.3 to 5.75\u00a0mg/kg. An additional 16 countries have a voluntary fortification program. For example, the Indian government recommends 4.0\u00a0mg/kg for \"maida\" (white) and \"atta\" (whole wheat) flour.\nAbsorption, metabolism, excretion.\nMore than 90% of riboflavin in the diet is in the form of protein-bound FMN and FAD. Exposure to gastric acid in the stomach releases the coenzymes, which are subsequently enzymatically hydrolyzed in the proximal small intestine to release free riboflavin.\nAbsorption occurs via a rapid active transport system, with some additional passive diffusion occurring at high concentrations. Bile salts facilitate uptake, so absorption is improved when the vitamin is consumed with a meal. The majority of newly absorbed riboflavin is taken up by the liver on the first pass, indicating that postprandial appearance of riboflavin in blood plasma may underestimate absorption. Three riboflavin transporter proteins have been identified: RFVT1 is present in the small intestine and also in the placenta; RFVT2 is highly expressed in brain and salivary glands; and RFVT3 is most highly expressed in the small intestine, testes, and prostate. Infants with mutations in the genes encoding these transport proteins can be treated with riboflavin administered orally.\nRiboflavin is reversibly converted to FMN and then FAD. From riboflavin to FMN is the function of zinc-requiring riboflavin kinase; the reverse is accomplished by a phosphatase. From FMN to FAD is the function of magnesium-requiring FAD synthase; the reverse is accomplished by a pyrophosphatase. FAD appears to be an inhibitory end-product that down-regulates its own formation.\nWhen excess riboflavin is absorbed by the small intestine, it is quickly removed from the blood and excreted in urine. Urine color is used as a hydration status biomarker and, under normal conditions, correlates with urine specific gravity and urine osmolality. However, riboflavin supplementation in large excess of requirements causes urine to appear more yellow than normal. With normal dietary intake, about two-thirds of urinary output is riboflavin, the remainder having been partially metabolized to hydroxymethylriboflavin from oxidation within cells, and as other metabolites. When consumption exceeds the ability to absorb, riboflavin passes into the large intestine, where it is catabolized by bacteria to various metabolites that can be detected in feces. There is speculation that unabsorbed riboflavin could affect the large intestine microbiome.\nDeficiency.\nPrevalence.\nRiboflavin deficiency is uncommon in the United States and in other countries with wheat flour or corn meal fortification programs. From data collected in biannual surveys of the U.S. population, for ages 20 and over, 22% of women and 19% of men reported consuming a supplement that contained riboflavin, typically a vitamin-mineral multi-supplement. For the non-supplement users, the dietary intake of adult women averaged 1.74\u00a0mg/day and men 2.44\u00a0mg/day. These amounts exceed the RDAs for riboflavin of 1.1 and 1.3\u00a0mg/day respectively. For all age groups, on average, consumption from food exceeded the RDAs. A 2001-02 U.S. survey reported that less than 3% of the population consumed less than the Estimated Average Requirement of riboflavin.\nSigns and symptoms.\nRiboflavin deficiency (also called ariboflavinosis) results in stomatitis, symptoms of which include chapped and fissured lips, inflammation of the corners of the mouth (angular stomatitis), sore throat, painful red tongue, and hair loss. The eyes can become itchy, watery, bloodshot, and sensitive to light. Riboflavin deficiency is associated with anemia. Prolonged riboflavin insufficiency may cause degeneration of the liver and nervous system. Riboflavin deficiency may increase the risk of preeclampsia in pregnant women. Deficiency of riboflavin during pregnancy can result in fetal birth defects, including heart and limb deformities.\nRisk factors.\nPeople at risk of having low riboflavin levels include alcoholics, vegetarian athletes, and practitioners of veganism. Pregnant or lactating women and their infants may also be at risk, if the mother avoids meat and dairy products. Anorexia and lactose intolerance increase the risk of riboflavin deficiency. People with physically demanding lives, such as athletes and laborers, may require higher riboflavin intake. The conversion of riboflavin into FAD and FMN is impaired in people with hypothyroidism, adrenal insufficiency, and riboflavin transporter deficiency.\nCauses.\nRiboflavin deficiency is usually found together with other nutrient deficiencies, particularly of other water-soluble vitamins. A deficiency of riboflavin can be primary (i.e. caused by poor vitamin sources in the regular diet) or secondary, which may be a result of conditions that affect absorption in the intestine. Secondary deficiencies are typically caused by the body not being able to use the vitamin, or by an increased rate of excretion of the vitamin. Diet patterns that increase risk of deficiency include veganism and low-dairy vegetarianism. Diseases such as cancer, heart disease and diabetes may cause or exacerbate riboflavin deficiency.\nThere are rare genetic defects that compromise riboflavin absorption, transport, metabolism or use by flavoproteins. One of these is riboflavin transporter deficiency, previously known as Brown\u2013Vialetto\u2013Van Laere syndrome. Variants of the genes SLC52A2 and SLC52A3 which code for transporter proteins RDVT2 and RDVT3, respectively, are defective. Infants and young children present with muscle weakness, cranial nerve deficits including hearing loss, sensory symptoms including sensory ataxia, feeding difficulties, and respiratory distress caused by a sensorimotor axonal neuropathy and cranial nerve pathology. When untreated, infants with riboflavin transporter deficiency have labored breathing and are at risk of dying in the first decade of life. Treatment with oral supplementation of high amounts of riboflavin is lifesaving.\nOther inborn errors of metabolism include riboflavin-responsive multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency, also known as a subset of glutaric acidemia type 2, and the C677T variant of the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase enzyme, which in adults has been associated with risk of high blood pressure.\nDiagnosis and assessment.\nThe assessment of riboflavin status is essential for confirming cases with non-specific symptoms whenever deficiency is suspected. Total riboflavin excretion in healthy adults with normal riboflavin intake is about 120 micrograms per day, while excretion of less than 40 micrograms per day indicates deficiency. Riboflavin excretion rates decrease as a person ages, but increase during periods of chronic stress and the use of some prescription drugs.\nIndicators used in humans are erythrocyte glutathione reductase (EGR), erythrocyte flavin concentration and urinary excretion. The \"erythrocyte glutathione reductase activity coefficient\" (EGRAC) provides a measure of tissue saturation and long-term riboflavin status. Results are expressed as an activity coefficient ratio, determined by enzyme activity with and without the addition of FAD to the culture medium. An EGRAC of 1.0 to 1.2 indicates that adequate amounts of riboflavin are present; 1.2 to 1.4 is considered low, greater than 1.4 indicates deficient. For the less sensitive \"erythrocyte flavin method\", values greater than 400 nmol/L are considered adequate and values below 270 nmol/L are considered deficient. Urinary excretion is expressed as nmol of riboflavin per gram of creatinine. Low is defined as in the range of 50 to 72 nmol/g. Deficient is below 50 nmol/g. Urinary excretion load tests have been used to determine dietary requirements. For adult men, as oral doses were increased from 0.5\u00a0mg to 1.1\u00a0mg, there was a modest linear increase in urinary riboflavin, reaching 100 micrograms for a subsequent 24-hour urine collection. Beyond a load dose of 1.1\u00a0mg, urinary excretion increased rapidly, so that with a dose of 2.5\u00a0mg, urinary output was 800 micrograms for a 24-hour urine collection.\nHistory.\nThe name \"riboflavin\" comes from \"ribose\" (the sugar whose reduced form, ribitol, forms part of its structure) and \"flavin\", the ring-moiety that imparts the yellow color to the oxidized molecule (from Latin \"flavus\", \"yellow\"). The reduced form, which occurs in metabolism along with the oxidized form, appears as orange-yellow needles or crystals. The earliest reported identification, predating any concept of vitamins as essential nutrients, was by Alexander Wynter Blyth. In 1879, Blyth isolated a water-soluble component of cows' milk whey, which he named \"lactochrome\", that fluoresced yellow-green when exposed to light.\nIn the early 1900s, several research laboratories were investigating constituents of foods, essential to maintain growth in rats. These constituents were initially divided into fat-soluble \"vitamine\" A and water-soluble \"vitamine\" B. (The \"e\" was dropped in 1920.) Vitamin B was further thought to have two components, a heat-labile substance called B1 and a heat-stable substance called B2. Vitamin B2 was tentatively identified to be the factor necessary for preventing pellagra, but that was later confirmed to be due to niacin (vitamin B3) deficiency. The confusion was due to the fact that riboflavin (B2) deficiency causes stomatitis symptoms similar to those seen in pellagra, but without the widespread peripheral skin lesions. For this reason, early in the history of identifying riboflavin deficiency in humans the condition was sometimes called \"pellagra sine pellagra\" (pellagra without pellagra).\nIn 1935, Paul Gyorgy, in collaboration with chemist Richard Kuhn and physician T. Wagner-Jauregg, reported that rats kept on a B2-free diet were unable to gain weight. Isolation of B2 from yeast revealed the presence of a bright yellow-green fluorescent product that restored normal growth when fed to rats. The growth restored was directly proportional to the intensity of the fluorescence. This observation enabled the researchers to develop a rapid chemical bioassay in 1933, and then isolate the factor from egg white, calling it ovoflavin. The same group then isolated the a similar preparation from whey and called it lactoflavin. In 1934, Kuhn's group identified the chemical structure of these flavins as identical, settled on \"riboflavin\" as a name, and were also able to synthesize the vitamin.\nCirca 1937, riboflavin was also referred to as \"Vitamin G\". In 1938, Richard Kuhn was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his work on vitamins, which had included B2 and B6. In 1939, it was confirmed that riboflavin is essential for human health through a clinical trial conducted by William H. Sebrell and Roy E. Butler. Women fed a diet low in riboflavin developed stomatitis and other signs of deficiency, which were reversed when treated with synthetic riboflavin. The symptoms returned when the supplements were stopped.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The museum is located at the Museum Square in the borough of Amsterdam South, close to the Van Gogh Museum, the Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam, and the Royal Concertgebouw.\nThe Rijksmuseum was founded in The Hague on 19 November 1798 and moved to Amsterdam in 1808, where it was first located in the Royal Palace and later in the Trippenhuis. The current main building was designed by Pierre Cuypers and first opened in 1885. On 13 April 2013, after a ten-year renovation which cost \u20ac375\u00a0million, the main building was reopened by Queen Beatrix. In 2013 and 2014, it was the most visited museum in the Netherlands with record numbers of 2.2\u00a0million and 2.47\u00a0million visitors. It is also the largest art museum in the country.\nThe museum has on display 8,000 objects of art and history, from their total collection of 1\u00a0million objects from the years 1200\u20132000, among which are some masterpieces by Rembrandt, Frans Hals, and Johannes Vermeer. The museum also has a small Asian collection, which is on display in the Asian pavilion.\nHistory.\nThe collection of the Rijksmuseum was built over a period of 200 years and did not originate from a royal collection incorporated into a national museum. Its origins were modest, with its collection fitting into five rooms at the Huis ten Bosch palace in The Hague. Although the seventeenth century was beginning to be recognized as the key period in Dutch art, the museum did not then hold paintings by Frans Hals, Rembrandt, Jan Steen, Johannes Vermeer, or Jacob van Ruisdael. The collection was built up by purchase and donation. Napoleon had carried off the stadholder's collection to Paris; the paintings were returned to The Netherlands in 1815 but housed in the Mauritshuis in The Hague rather than the Rijksmuseum. With the founding of the Rijksmuseum in 1885, holdings from other entities were brought together to establish the Rijksmuseum's major collections.\n18th century.\nIn 1795, the Batavian Republic was proclaimed; its Minister of Finance Isaac Gogel argued that a national museum, following the French example of The Louvre, would serve the national interest. On 19 November 1798, the government decided to found the museum.\n19th century.\nOn 31 May 1800, the National Art Gallery (Dutch: \"Nationale Kunst-Galerij\"), precursor of the Rijksmuseum, opened in Huis ten Bosch in The Hague. The museum exhibited around 200 paintings and historic objects from the collections of the Dutch stadtholders. \nIn 1805, the National Art Gallery moved within The Hague to the Prince William V Gallery, on the Buitenhof. In 1806, the Kingdom of Holland was established by Napoleon Bonaparte. On the orders of king Louis Bonaparte, brother of Napoleon, the museum moved to Amsterdam in 1808. Paintings owned by that city, such as \"The Night Watch\" by Rembrandt, became part of the collection. In 1809, the museum opened in the Royal Palace in Amsterdam.\nIn 1817, the museum moved to the Trippenhuis. The Trippenhuis turned out to be unsuitable as a museum. In 1820, the historical objects were moved to the Mauritshuis in The Hague and in 1838, the 19th-century paintings \"of living masters\" were moved to King Louis Bonaparte's former summer palace Paviljoen Welgelegen in Haarlem.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"Did you know that a large, new building will take the place of the Trippenhuis in Amsterdam? That's fine with me; the Trippenhuis is too small, and many paintings hang in such a way that one can't see them properly.\"\n\u00a0\u2013 Vincent van Gogh in a letter to his brother Theo in 1873. Vincent himself would later become a painter and some of his works would be hanging in the museum.\nIn 1863, there was a design contest for a new building for the Rijksmuseum, but none of the submissions was considered to be of sufficient quality. Pierre Cuypers also participated in the contest and his submission reached the second place.\nIn 1890, a new building was added a short distance to the south-west of the Rijksmuseum. As the building was made out of fragments of demolished buildings, the building offers an overview of the history of Dutch architecture and has come to be known informally as the 'fragment building'. It is also known as the 'south wing' and is currently (in 2013) branded the \"Philips Wing\".\n20th century.\nIn 1906, the hall for \"The Night Watch\" was rebuilt. In the interior more changes were made between the 1920s and 1950s \u2013 most multi-coloured wall decorations were painted over. In the 1960s exposition rooms and several floors were built into the two courtyards. The building had some minor renovations and restorations in 1984, 1995\u20131996 and 2000.\nA renovation of the south wing of the museum, also known as the 'fragment building' or 'Philips Wing', was completed in 1996, the same year that the museum held its first major photography exhibition featuring its extensive collection of 19th-century photos.\n21st century.\nIn December 2003, the main building of the museum closed for a major renovation. During this renovation, about 400 objects from the collection were on display in the 'fragment building', including Rembrandt's \"The Night Watch\" and other 17th-century masterpieces.\nThe restoration and renovation of the Rijksmuseum are based on a design by Spanish architects Antonio Cruz and Antonio Ortiz. Many of the old interior decorations were restored and the floors in the courtyards were removed. The renovation would have initially taken five years, but was delayed and eventually took almost ten years to complete. The renovation cost \u20ac375\u00a0million.\nThe reconstruction of the building was completed on 16 July 2012. In March 2013, the museum's main pieces of art were moved back from the 'fragment building' (Philips Wing) to the main building. \"The Night Watch\" returned to the Night Watch Room, at the end of the Hall of Fame. On 13 April 2013, the main building was reopened by Queen Beatrix. On 1 November 2014, the Philips Wing reopened with the exhibition \"\".\nBuilding.\nThe building of the Rijksmuseum was designed by Pierre Cuypers and opened in 1885. It consists of two squares with an atrium in each centre. In the central axis is a tunnel with the entrances at ground level and the Gallery of Honour at the first floor. The building also contains a library. The fragment building, branded Philips wing, contains building fragments that show the history of architecture in the Netherlands. The Rijksmuseum is a \"rijksmonument\" (national heritage site) since 1970 and was listed in the Top 100 Dutch heritage sites in 1990. The Asian pavilion was designed by Cruz y Ortiz and opened in 2013.\nAccording to Muriel Huisman, Project Architect for the Rijksmuseum's renovation, \"Cruz y Ortiz always like to look for synergy between old and new, and we try not to explain things with our architecture\". With the Rijks, \"there\u2019s no cut between old and new; we\u2019ve tried to merge it. We did this by looking for materials that were true to the original building, resulting in a kind of silent architecture.\"\nCollection.\nThe collection of the Rijksmuseum consists of 1\u00a0million objects and is dedicated to arts, crafts, and history from the years 1200 to 2000. Around 8,000 objects are currently on display in the museum.\nThe collection contains more than 2,000 paintings from the Dutch Golden Age by notable painters such as Jacob van Ruisdael, Frans Hals, Johannes Vermeer, Jan Steen, Rembrandt, and Rembrandt's pupils.\nThe museum also has a small Asian collection which is on display in the Asian pavilion.\nSome of the more unusual items in the collection include the royal crest from the stern of {{HMS|Royal Charles|1660|6}} which was captured in the Raid on the Medway, the Hartog plate and the FK35 \"Bantam\" biplane.\nIn 2012, the museum made some 125,000 high-resolution images available for download via its Rijksstudio webplatform, with plans to add another 40,000 images per year until the entire collection of one million works is available, according to Taco Dibbits, director of collections. As of January 2021, the Rijksstudio hosts 700,000 works, available under a Creative Commons 1.0 Universal license, essentially copyright-free and royalty-free.\nSpecial exhibitions.\nRembrandt.\nIn 2019, to mark the 350th anniversary of the artist's death, the museum mounted an exhibition of all the works by Rembrandt in its collection. Consisting of 22 paintings, 60 drawings and over 300 prints, this was the first time they had all been exhibited together. Principal features were the marriage portraits of Marten Soolmans and Oopjen Coppit along with the presentation of the \"Night Watch\" immediately before its planned restoration. The exhibition ran from February to June.\nSlavery in the Dutch Empire.\nAfter previous temporary exhibitions on art historical themes, the Rijksmuseum in 2021 presented an exhibition on the history of slavery in the Dutch colonial empire, focusing on the more than 1.6 million people who were enslaved by Dutch slave traders. It covered trans-Atlantic slavery from the 17th to the 19th century in Suriname, Brazil and the Caribbean, as well as Dutch colonial slavery in South Africa and Asia, where the Dutch West India Company (WIC) and the Dutch East India Company (VOC) were engaged in slavery. Besides objects, such as a wooden block for locking slaves, paintings, archival documents, oral sources, poems and music, the exhibition also presented connections of the slavery system at home in the Netherlands. In the permanent collection, labels were added to 77 paintings and objects that had been seen as symbols of the country's wealth and power to indicate previously hidden links to slavery.\nThe exhibition was presented both physically in the museum from May to August 2021 and in an online version. It was complemented by audio tours and videos relating personal and real-life stories as well as an accompanying book titled \"Slavery\".\nVermeer.\nFrom 10 February until June 2023 the Rijksmuseum began to exhibit the biggest collection of Vermeers ever, with 28 of the known 37 works on display. Curator Pieter Roelofs called it a \"once in a lifetime\" event. All time slot reservations were quickly sold out.\nNumber of visitors.\nThe 20th-century visitor record of 1,412,000 was reached in the year 1975.\nIn the 1990s and early 2000s, the Rijksmuseum was annually visited by 0.9 to 1.3\u00a0million people. On 7 December 2003, the main building of the museum was closed for a renovation until 13 April 2013. In the preceding decade, the number of visitors had slightly decreased to 0.8 to 1.1\u00a0million people. The museum says after the renovation, the museum's capacity is 1.5 to 2.0\u00a0million visitors annually. Within eight months since the reopening in 2013, the museum was visited by 2\u00a0million people.\nThe museum had 2.2\u00a0million visitors in 2013 and reached an all-time record of 2.47\u00a0million visitors in 2014. The museum was the most visited museum in the Netherlands and the 19th most visited art museum in the world in 2013 and 2014.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic forced the closure of the museum from 15 December 2020, until 4 June 2021.\nLibrary.\nThe Rijksmuseum Research Library is part of the Rijksmuseum, and is the best and the largest public art history research library in The Netherlands.\nRestaurant.\nRijks, stylized as RIJKS\u00ae, is a restaurant with 140 seats in the Philips Wing. Joris Bijdendijk has been the chef de cuisine since the opening in 2014. The restaurant was awarded a Michelin star in 2017."}

He was the main leader of the Iranian Revolution, which overthrew Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and transformed Iran into a theocratic Islamic republic.\nBorn in Khomeyn, in what is now Iran's Markazi province, his father was murdered when Khomeini was two years old. He began studying the Quran and Arabic from a young age assisted by his relatives. Khomeini became a high ranking cleric in Twelver Shi'ism, an \"ayatollah\", a \"marja\"' (\"source of emulation\"), a \"mujtahid\" or \"faq\u012bh\" (an expert in \"fiqh\"), and author of more than 40 books. His opposition to the White Revolution resulted in his state-sponsored expulsion to Bursa in 1964. Nearly a year later, he moved to Najaf, where speeches he gave outlining his religiopolitical theory of Guardianship of the Jurist were compiled into \"Islamic Government\".\nAfter the success of the Iranian Revolution, Khomeini served as the country's \"de facto\" head of state from February 1979 until his appointment as supreme leader in December of that same year. Khomeini was \"Time\" magazine's Man of the Year in 1979 for his international influence and in the next decade was described as the \"virtual face of Shia Islam in Western popular culture\". He was known for his support of the hostage takers during the Iran hostage crisis; his fatwa calling for the murder of British Indian novelist Salman Rushdie for Rushdie's description of Islamic prophet Muhammad in his novel \"The Satanic Verses\", which Khomeini considered blasphemous; pursuing the overthrow of Saddam Hussein in the Iran\u2013Iraq War; and for referring to the United States as the \"Great Satan\" and Israel as the \"Little Satan\".\nThe subject of a pervasive cult of personality, Khomeini held the title Ayatollah and is officially known as Imam Khomeini inside Iran and by his supporters internationally. His state funeral was attended by up to 10 million people, one fifth of Iran's population, and is considered the second-largest funeral in history. In Iran, he is legally considered \"inviolable\"\u2014insulting him is punishable with imprisonment; his gold-domed tomb in Tehran's Behesht-e Zahra cemetery has become a shrine for his adherents. His supporters view him as a champion of Islamic revival, independence, anti-imperialism, and resistance to foreign influence in Iran. Conversely, he has been criticized for anti-Western and anti-Semitic rhetoric, anti-democratic actions, human rights violations including the 1988 execution of thousands of Iranian political prisoners, and for using child soldiers extensively during the Iran\u2013Iraq War for human wave attacks.\nEarly years.\nBackground.\nRuhollah Khomeini came from a lineage of small land owners, clerics, and merchants. His ancestors migrated towards the end of the 18th century from their original home in Nishapur, then part of Khorasan province, in northeastern Iran for a short stay to the Kingdom of Awadh, a region in the modern state of Uttar Pradesh, India, whose rulers were Twelver Shi'a Muslims of Persian origin. During their rule, they extensively invited and received a steady stream of Persian scholars, poets, jurists, architects, and painters. The family eventually settled in the small town of Kintoor, near Lucknow, the capital of Awadh.\nAyatollah Khomeini's paternal grandfather, Ahmad Hindi, was born in Kintoor. He left Lucknow in 1830, on a pilgrimage to the tomb of Ali in Najaf, Ottoman Iraq (now Iraq), and never returned. According to biographer Baqer Moin, this migration was to escape from the spread of British power in India. In 1834, Seyyed Ahmad Musavi Hindi visited Iran, and in 1839, he settled in Khomein. Although he stayed and settled in Iran, he continued to be known as \"Hindi\", indicating his stay in India, and Ruhollah Khomeini even used \"Hindi\" as a pen name in some of his ghazals. Khomeini's grandfather, Mirza Ahmad Mojtahed-e Khonsari was the cleric issuing a fatwa to forbid usage of tobacco during the Tobacco Protest.\nChildhood.\nAccording to his birth certificate, Ruhollah Musavi Khomeini, whose first name means \"spirit of Allah\", was born on 17 May 1900 in Khomeyn, Markazi province, although his brother Mortaza (later known as Ayatollah Pasandideh) gives his birth date of 24 September 1902, the birth anniversary of Muhammad's daughter, Fatima. He was raised by his mother, Agha Khanum, and his aunt, Sahebeth, following the murder of his father, Mustafa Musawi, over two years after his birth in 1903.\nRuhollah began to study the Qur'an and elementary Persian at the age of six. The following year, he began to attend a local school, where he learned religion, \"noheh khani\" (lamentation recital), and other traditional subjects. Throughout his childhood, he continued his religious education with the assistance of his relatives, including his mother's cousin, Ja'far, and his elder brother, Morteza Pasandideh.\nEducation and lecturing.\nAfter World War I, arrangements were made for him to study at the Islamic seminary in Isfahan, but he was attracted instead to the seminary in Arak. He was placed under the leadership of Ayatollah Abdolkarim Haeri Yazdi. In 1920, Khomeini moved to Arak and commenced his studies. The following year, Ayatollah Haeri Yazdi transferred to the Islamic seminary in the holy city of Qom, southwest of Tehran, and invited his students to follow. Khomeini accepted the invitation, moved, and took up residence at the Dar al-Shafa school in Qom. Khomeini's studies included Islamic law (\"sharia\") and jurisprudence (\"fiqh\"), but by that time, Khomeini had also acquired an interest in poetry and philosophy (\"irfan\"). So, upon arriving in Qom, Khomeini sought the guidance of Mirza Ali Akbar Yazdi, a scholar of philosophy and mysticism. Yazdi died in 1924, but Khomeini continued to pursue his interest in philosophy with two other teachers, Javad Aqa Maleki Tabrizi and Rafi'i Qazvini. However, perhaps Khomeini's biggest influences were another teacher, Mohammad Ali Shah Abadi, and a variety of historic Sufi mystics, including Mulla Sadra and Ibn Arabi.\nKhomeini studied ancient Greek philosophy and was influenced by both the philosophy of Aristotle, whom he regarded as the founder of logic, and Plato, whose views \"in the field of divinity\" he regarded as \"grave and solid\". Among Islamic philosophers, Khomeini was mainly influenced by Avicenna and Mulla Sadra. Apart from philosophy, Khomeini was interested in literature and poetry. His poetry collection was released after his death. Beginning in his adolescent years, Khomeini composed mystic, political and social poetry. His poetry works were published in three collections: \"The Confidant\", \"The Decanter of Love and Turning Point\", and \"Divan\". His knowledge of poetry is further attested by the modern poet Nader Naderpour (1929\u20132000), who \"had spent many hours exchanging poems with Khomeini in the early 1960s\". Naderpour remembered: \"For four hours we recited poetry. Every single line I recited from any poet, he recited the next.\"\nRuhollah Khomeini was a lecturer at Najaf and Qom seminaries for decades before he was known on the political scene. He soon became a leading scholar of Shia Islam. He taught political philosophy, Islamic history and ethics. Several of his students, for example Morteza Motahhari, later became leading Islamic philosophers and also \"marja\"'. As a scholar and teacher, Khomeini produced numerous writings on Islamic philosophy, law, and ethics. He showed an exceptional interest in subjects like philosophy and mysticism that not only were usually absent from the curriculum of seminaries but were often an object of hostility and suspicion.\nInaugurating his teaching career at the age of 27 by giving private lessons on irfan and Mulla Sadra to a private circle, around the same time, in 1928, he also released his first publication, \"Sharh Du'a al-Sahar\" (Commentary on the Du'a al-Baha), \"a detailed commentary, in Arabic, on the prayer recited before dawn during Ramadan by Imam Ja'far al-Sadiq\", followed, some years later, by \"Sirr al-Salat\" (Secret of the Prayer), where \"the symbolic dimensions and inner meaning of every part of the prayer, from the ablution that precedes it to the salam that concludes it, are expounded in a rich, complex, and eloquent language that owes much to the concepts and terminology of Ibn 'Arabi. As Sayyid Fihri, the editor and translator of \"Sirr al-Salat\", has remarked, the work is addressed only to the foremost among the spiritual elite (akhass-i khavass) and establishes its author as one of their number.\" The second book has been translated by Sayyid Amjad H. Shah Naqavi and released by Brill Publishers in 2015 under the title \"The Mystery of Prayer: The Ascension of the Wayfarers and the Prayer of the Gnostics\".\nPolitical aspects.\nHis seminary teaching often focused on the importance of religion to practical social and political issues of the day, and he worked against secularism in the 1940s. His first political book \"Kashf al-Asrar\" (\"Uncovering of Secrets\"), published in 1942, was a point-by-point refutation of \"Asrar-e Hezar Sale\" (\"Secrets of a Thousand Years\"), a tract written by a disciple of Iran's leading anti-clerical historian Ahmad Kasravi, as well as a condemnation of innovations such as international time zones, \nand the banning of hijab by Reza Shah, whom he always blamed for his father's murder. In addition, he went from Qom to Tehran to listen to Ayatullah Hasan Mudarris, the leader of the opposition majority in Iran's parliament during the 1920s. Khomeini became a \"marja'\" in 1963, following the death of Grand Ayatollah Seyyed Husayn Borujerdi. Khomeini also valued the ideals of Islamists such as Sheikh Fazlollah Noori and Abol-Ghasem Kashani. Khomeini saw Fazlollah Nuri as a \"heroic figure\", and his own objections to constitutionalism and a secular government derived from Nuri's objections to the 1907 constitution.\nEarly political activity.\nBackground.\nIn the late 19th century, the clergy had shown themselves to be a powerful political force in Iran initiating the Tobacco Protest against a concession to a foreign (British) interest. At the age of 61, Khomeini found the arena of leadership open following the deaths of Ayatollah Sayyed Husayn Borujerdi (1961), the leading, although quiescent, Shi'ah religious leader; and Ayatollah Abol-Ghasem Kashani (1962), an activist cleric. The clerical class had been on the defensive ever since the 1920s when the secular, anti-clerical modernizer Reza Shah Pahlavi rose to power. Reza Shah's son Mohammad Reza Shah instituted the White Revolution, which was a further challenge to the Ulama.\nOpposition to the White Revolution.\nIn January 1963, the Shah announced the White Revolution, a multi-point programme of reform calling for land reform, nationalization of the forests, the sale of state-owned enterprises to private interests, electoral changes to enfranchise women and allow non-Muslims to hold office, profit-sharing in industry, a literacy campaign in the nation's schools, etc. Some of these initiatives were regarded as Westernising trends and a threat by traditionalists. Khomeini viewed them as \"an attack on Islam\". The powerful Shi'a ulama (religious scholars) had much to lose from land redistribution to peasants as they administered and earned much of their revenue huge tracts of land as charitable trusts (\"vaqf\"). Khomeini also attacked reform measures such as the elimination of the restriction that only male Muslims could be judges, complaining that \"henceforth, Jews, Christians, and the enemies of Islam and the Muslims are to decide on affairs concerning the honor and person of the Muslims\". Khomeini summoned a meeting of the other senior Marja's of Qom and persuaded them to decree a boycott of the referendum on the White Revolution. On 22 January 1963, Khomeini issued a strongly worded declaration denouncing both the Shah and his reform plan. Two days later, the Shah took an armored column to Qom, and delivered a speech harshly attacking the ulama as a class.\nKhomeini continued his denunciation of the Shah's programmes, issuing a manifesto that bore the signatures of eight other senior Shia religious scholars. Khomeini's manifesto argued that the Shah had violated the constitution in various ways, he condemned the spread of moral corruption in the country and accused the Shah of submission to the United States and Israel. He also decreed that the Nowruz celebrations for the Iranian year 1342 (which fell on 21 March 1963) be canceled as a sign of protest against government policies.\nOn the afternoon of 'Ashura (3 June 1963), Khomeini delivered a speech at the Feyziyeh madrasah drawing parallels between the Caliph Yazid I, who is perceived as a \"tyrant\" by Shias, and the Shah, denouncing the Shah as a \"wretched, miserable man\", and warning him that if he did not change his ways the day would come when the people would offer up thanks for his departure from the country. On 5 June 1963 (15 of Khordad) at 3:00am, two days after this public denunciation of the Shah, Khomeini was detained in Qom and transferred to Tehran. Following this action, there were three days of major riots throughout Iran and the deaths of some 400 people. That event is now referred to as the Movement of 15 Khordad. Khomeini remained under house arrest until August.\nOpposition to capitulation.\nOn 26 October 1964, Khomeini denounced both the Shah and the United States. This time it was in response to the \"capitulations\" or diplomatic immunity granted by the Shah to American military personnel in Iran. What Khomeini labeled a capitulation law was in fact a \"Status of forces agreement\", stipulating that U.S. servicemen facing criminal charges stemming from a deployment in Iran were to be tried before a U.S. court martial, not an Iranian court. Khomeini was arrested in November 1964 and held for half a year. Upon his release, Khomeini was brought before Prime Minister Hassan Ali Mansur, who tried to convince him to apologize for his harsh rhetoric and going forward, cease his opposition to the Shah and his government. When Khomeini refused, Mansur slapped him in the face in a fit of rage. Two months later, Mansur was assassinated on his way to parliament. Four members of the Fadayan-e Islam, a Shia militia sympathetic to Khomeini, were later executed for the murder.\nLife in exile.\nKhomeini spent more than 14 years in exile, mostly in the holy Iraqi city of Najaf. Initially, he was sent to Turkey on 4 November 1964 where he stayed in Bursa in the home of Colonel Ali Cetiner of the Turkish Military Intelligence. In October 1965, after less than a year, he was allowed to move to Najaf, Iraq, where he stayed until 1978, when he was expelled by then-Vice President Saddam Hussein. By this time, discontent with the Shah was becoming intense and Khomeini visited Neauphle-le-Ch\u00e2teau, a suburb of Paris, France, on a tourist visa on 6 October 1978.\nBy the late 1960s, Khomeini was a marja-e taqlid (model for imitation) for \"hundreds of thousands\" of Shia, one of six or so models in the Shia world at the time. While in the 1940s Khomeini accepted the idea of a limited monarchy under the Persian Constitution of 1906 \u2013 as evidenced by his book \"Kashf al-Asrar\" \u2013 by the 1970s he had rejected the idea. In early 1970, Khomeini gave a series of lectures in Najaf on Islamic government, later published as a book titled variously \"Islamic Government\" or \"\" (\"Hokumat-e Islami: Velayat-e faqih\"). This principle, though not known to the wider public before the revolution, was integrated into the new Iranian constitution after the revolution.\n\"Vel\u00e2yat-e Faqih\".\n\"Vel\u00e2yat-e Faqih\" was his best known and most influential work, and laid out his ideas on governance (at that time):\nPre-revolutionary political activity.\nA modified form of this \"wilayat al-faqih\" system was adopted after Khomeini and his followers took power, and Khomeini was the Islamic Republic's first \"Guardian\" Islamic scholar or \"Supreme Leader\". In the meantime, Khomeini talked only about \"Islamic Government\", never spelling out what exactly that meant. Khomenei was careful not to publicize his ideas for clerical rule outside of his Islamic network of opposition to the Shah and so not frighten away the secular middle class from his movement. His network may have been learning about the necessity of rule by Jurists, but \"in his interview, speeches, messages and fatvas during this period, there is not a single reference to velayat-e faqih.\" Publicly his movement emphasized populism, talking about fighting for the \"mustazafin\", (a Quranic term for the oppressed or deprived), that in this context came to mean \"just about everyone in Iran except the shah and the imperial court\".\nIn Iran, a number of missteps by the Shah including his repression of opponents began to build opposition to his regime. Cassette copies of his lectures fiercely denouncing the Shah, for example as \"the Jewish agent, the American serpent whose head must be smashed with a stone\", became common items in the markets of Iran, helping to demythologize the power and dignity of the Shah and his reign. As Iran became more polarized and opposition more radical, Khomeini \"was able to mobilize the entire network of mosques in Iran\", along with their pious faithful, regular gatherings, hitherto skeptical Mullah leaders, and the support of \"over 20,000 properties and buildings throughout Iran\"\u2014a political resource the secular middle class and Shiite socialists could not hope to compete with.\nAware of the importance of broadening his base, Khomeini reached out to Islamic reformists and secular enemies of the Shah, groups that he and his supporters would suppress after taking and consolidating power. After the 1977 death of Ali Shariati, an Islamic reformist and political revolutionary author, academic, and philosopher who greatly accelerated the Islamic revival among young educated Iranians, Khomeini became the most influential leader of the opposition to the Shah. Adding to his mystique was the circulation among Iranians in the 1970s of an old Shia saying attributed to the seventh Imam, Musa al-Kazim. Prior to his death in 799, al-Kazim was said to have prophesied that \"[a] man will come out from Qom and he will summon people to the right path\". In late 1978, a rumour swept the country that Khomeini's face could be seen in the full moon. Millions of people were said to have seen it and the event was celebrated in thousands of mosques. The phenomenon was thought to demonstrate that by late 1978 he was increasingly regarded as a messianic figure in Iran and perceived by many as the spiritual as well as political leader of the revolt.\nAs protests grew, so did his profile and importance. Although several thousand kilometers away from Iran in Paris, Khomeini set the course of the revolution, urging Iranians not to compromise and ordering work stoppages against the regime. During the last few months of his exile, Khomeini received a constant stream of reporters, supporters, and notables, eager to hear the spiritual leader of the revolution. While in exile, Khomeini developed what historian Ervand Abrahamian described as a \"populist clerical version of Shii Islam\". Khomeini modified previous Shii interpretations of Islam in a number of ways that included aggressive approaches to espousing the general interests of the mostazafin, forcefully arguing that the clergy's sacred duty was to take over the state so that it could implement shari'a, and exhorting followers to protest. Despite their ideological differences, Khomeini also allied with the People's Mujahedin of Iran during the early 1970s and started funding their armed operations against the Shah.\nKhomeini's contact with the United States.\nIn the \"official\" narrative of the Iranian revolution, Khomeini \"bravely defied\" the U.S. and \"defeated 'the Great Satan'\", \"staunchly\" resisting any direct contact with the US. However U.S. government documents \u2014 \"diplomatic cables, policy memos, meeting records\" declassified in 2016 and published by the BBC \u2014 indicate Khomeini did send messages to the US two weeks prior to the revolution, and that these may have been successful in facilitating his return from exile to Iran. According to the documents, Khomeini told an American in France to convey a message to Washington that \"You will see we are not in any particular animosity with the Americans,\" said that his Islamic Republic will be \"a humanitarian one, which will benefit the cause of peace and tranquillity for all mankind\". Khomeini also \"pledged not to destroy the military\". The Carter administration helped Khomeini return to Iran by preventing the Iranian army from launching a military coup.\nA CIA analysis report titled \"Islam in Iran\", also indicates that years earlier, in November 1963, Khomeini (while under house arrest for rallying opposition to the shah's White Revolution reforms as a foreign inspired \"attack on Islam\"), contacted the administration of U.S. president John F. Kennedy, sending a message through cleric and Tehran University professor Haj Mirza Khalil Kamarah'i. In it, he stated that he \"was not opposed to American interests in Iran\", and that \"on the contrary, he thought the American presence was necessary as a counterbalance to Soviet and possibly British influence\".\nAccording to Kambiz Fattahi of the BBC, the document show that Carter's gullible attempts to understand Khomeini's plans were a \"massive blunder\" underestimating Khomeini's mendacious shrewdness, while Khomeini \"played his hand masterfully\". Within a year large numbers of high level Iranian military were executed, Khomeini was holding the US Charge d'Affaires and dozens of other Americans hostage in Tehran under the slogan \"America can't do a damn thing,\" and establishing an anti-American legacy that lasted for decades. Supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei denied the report, and described the documents as \"fabricated\". Other Iranian politicians including Ebrahim Yazdi, who was Khomeini's spokesman and adviser at the time of the revolution, denounced the documents and the BBC's report.\nSupreme Leader of Iran.\nReturn to Iran.\nOn 16 January 1979, the Shah left the country for medical treatment (ostensibly \"on vacation\"), never to return. Two weeks later, on Thursday, 1 February 1979, Khomeini returned in triumph to Iran, welcomed by a joyous crowd reported to be of up to five million people. On his chartered Air France flight back to Tehran, he was accompanied by 120 journalists, including three women. One of the journalists, Peter Jennings, asked: \"Ayatollah, would you be so kind as to tell us how you feel about being back in Iran?\" Khomeini answered via his aide Sadegh Ghotbzadeh: \"Hichi\" (Nothing). This statement \u2013 much discussed at the time and since \u2013 was considered by some to be reflective of his mystical beliefs and non-attachment to ego, by others to be a warning to Iranians who hoped he would be a \"mainstream nationalist leader\" that they were in for disappointment, or of Khomeini's disinterest in the desires, beliefs, or the needs of the Iranian populace. He was \"Time\" magazine's Man of the Year in 1979 for his international influence.\nRevolution.\nKhomeini adamantly opposed the provisional government of Shapour Bakhtiar, promising \"I shall kick their teeth in. I appoint the government.\" On 11 February (Bahman 22), Khomeini appointed his own competing interim prime minister, Mehdi Bazargan, demanding, \"since I have appointed him, he must be obeyed\". He warned it was \"God's government\", and disobedience against him or Bazargan was considered a \"revolt against God\", and \"revolt against God is Blasphemy\".\nAs Khomeini's movement gained momentum, soldiers began to defect to his side and Khomeini declared ill fortune on troops who did not surrender. On 11 February, as revolt spread and armories were taken over, the military declared neutrality and the Bakhtiar regime collapsed. On 30 and 31 March 1979, a referendum to replace the monarchy with an Islamic Republic\u2014with the question: \"should the monarchy be abolished in favour of an Islamic Government?\"\u2014passed with 98% voting in favour of the replacement.\nBeginning of the consolidation of power.\nWhile in Paris, Khomeini had \"promised a democratic political system\" for Iran but once in power advocated for the creation of theocracy, which was based on the \"Velayat-e faqih\". This began the process of suppression of groups inside his broad coalition but outside his religious network\u2014groups that had placed their hopes in Khomeini but whose support was no longer needed. This also led to the purge or replacement of many secular politicians in Iran, with Khomeini and his close associates taking the following steps: establishing Islamic Revolutionary courts; replacing the previous military and police force; placing Iran's top theologians and Islamic intellectuals in charge of writing a theocratic constitutions, with a central role for \"Velayat-e faqih\"; creating the Islamic Republic Party (IRP) through Khomeini's \"Motjaheds\" with the aim of establishing a theocratic government and tearing down any secular opposition; replacing all secular laws with Islamic laws; and neutralising or punishing top theologians (\"Khomeini's competitors in the religious hierarchy\"), whose ideas conflicted with Khomeini's, including Mohammad Kazem Shariatmadari, Hassan Tabatabaei Qomi, and Hossein Ali Montazeri. Some newspapers were closed, and those protesting the closings were attacked. Opposition groups such as the National Democratic Front and Muslim People's Republican Party were attacked and finally banned.\nIslamic constitution and becoming Supreme Leader.\nAs part of the pivot from being the guide of a broad political movement to a strict clerical ruler, Khomeini first expressed approval of the provisional constitution for the Islamic Republic that included no position of supreme Islamic clerical ruler. After his supporters gained an overwhelming majority of the seats in the body making final changes in the draft (the Assembly of Experts), they rewrote the proposed constitution to include an Islamic jurist Supreme Leader of the country, and a more powerful Council of Guardians to veto un-Islamic legislation and screen candidates for office, disqualifying those found un-Islamic. The Supreme Leader followed closely but not completely Khomeini ideas in his 1970 book \"\" (\"Islamic Government: Governance of the Jurist\") that had been distributed to his supporters and kept from the public. In November 1979, the new constitution of the Islamic Republic was adopted by national referendum. Khomeini himself became instituted as the Supreme Leader of Iran, and officially became known as the \"Leader of the Revolution\". On 4 February 1980, Abolhassan Banisadr was elected as the first president of Iran. Critics complained that Khomeini had gone back on his word to advise, rather than rule the country.\nHostage crisis.\nBefore the constitution was approved, on 22 October 1979, the United States admitted the exiled and ailing Shah into the country for cancer treatment. In Iran, there was an immediate outcry, with both Khomeini and leftist groups demanding the Shah's return to Iran for trial and execution. On 4 November, a group of Iranian college students calling themselves the Muslim Student Followers of the Imam's Line took control of the American Embassy in Tehran, holding 52 embassy staff hostage for 444 days, an event known as the Iran hostage crisis. In the United States, the hostage-taking was seen as a flagrant violation of international law and aroused intense anger and anti-Iranian sentiment.\nIn Iran, the takeover was immensely popular and earned the support of Khomeini under the slogan \"America can't do a damn thing against us\". The seizure of the embassy of a country he called the \"Great Satan\" helped to advance the cause of theocratic government and outflank politicians and groups who emphasized stability and normalized relations with other countries. Khomeini is reported to have told his president: \"This action has many benefits ... this has united our people. Our opponents do not dare act against us. We can put the constitution to the people's vote without difficulty, and carry out presidential and parliamentary elections.\" The new constitution was successfully passed by referendum a month after the hostage crisis began.\nThe crisis had the effect of splitting of the opposition into two groups: radicals supporting the hostage taking, and the moderates opposing it. On 23 February 1980, Khomeini proclaimed Iran's Majlis would decide the fate of the American embassy hostages, and demanded that the United States hand over the Shah for trial in Iran for crimes against the nation. Although the Shah died a few months later, during the summer, the crisis continued. In Iran, supporters of Khomeini named the embassy a \"Den of Espionage\", publicizing details regarding armaments, espionage equipment and many volumes of official and classified documents which they found there.\nRelationship with Islamic and non-aligned countries.\nKhomeini believed in Muslim unity and solidarity, in the export of his revolution throughout the world, and eventually in \"establishing the Islamic state world-wide\", one of \"the great goals of the revolution.\". He believed Shia and the significantly more numerous Sunni Muslims should be \"united and stand firmly against Western and arrogant powers\". He declared the birth week of Muhammad (the week between 12th to 17th of Rabi' al-awwal) as the Unity Week and the last Friday of Ramadan as Quds Day in 1981.\nIran\u2013Iraq War.\nShortly after assuming power, Khomeini began calling for Islamic revolutions across the Muslim world, including Iran's Arab neighbor Iraq, the one large state besides Iran with a Shia majority population. At the same time Saddam Hussein, Iraq's secular Sunni Arab nationalist Ba'athist leader, was eager to take advantage of Iran's weakened military and (what he assumed was) revolutionary chaos, and in particular to occupy Iran's adjacent oil-rich province of Khuzestan, and to undermine Iranian Islamic revolutionary attempts to incite the Shi'a majority of his country. In September 1980, Iraq launched a full-scale invasion of Iran, beginning the Iran\u2013Iraq War (September 1980 \u2013 August 1988). A combination of fierce resistance by Iranians and military incompetence by Iraqi forces soon stalled the Iraqi advance and, despite Saddam's internationally condemned use of poison gas, Iran had by early 1982 regained almost all of the territory lost to the invasion. The invasion rallied Iranians behind the new regime, enhancing Khomeini's stature and allowing him to consolidate and stabilize his leadership. After this reversal, Khomeini refused an Iraqi offer of a truce, instead demanding reparations and the toppling of Saddam Hussein from power. In 1982, there was an attempted military coup against Khomeini.\nAlthough Iran's population and economy were three times the size of Iraq's, the latter was aided by neighboring Persian Gulf Arab states, as well as the Soviet Bloc and Western countries. The Persian Gulf Arabs and the West wanted to be sure the Islamic revolution did not spread across the Persian Gulf, while the Soviet Union was concerned about the potential threat posed to its rule in central Asia to the north; however, Iran had large amounts of ammunition provided by the United States of America during the Shah's era and the United States secretly and illegally smuggled arms to Iran during the 1980s despite Khomeini's anti-Western policy (see Iran\u2013Contra affair).\nDuring the war, the Iranians used human wave attacks (people walking to certain death included child soldiers), with Khomeini promising that they would automatically go to paradise\u2014al Jannah\u2014if they died in battle. Khomeini's pursuit of victory ultimately proved futile. By March 1984, two million of Iran's most educated citizens had left the country. In July 1988, Khomeini, in his words, \"drank the cup of poison\" and accepted a truce mediated by the United Nations. Despite the high cost of the war, including 450,000 to 950,000 Iranian casualties and US$300\u00a0billion, Khomeini insisted that extending the war into Iraq in an attempt to overthrow Saddam had not been a mistake. In a \"Letter to Clergy\", he wrote that \"we do not repent, nor are we sorry for even a single moment for our performance during the war. Have we forgotten that we fought to fulfill our religious duty and that the result is a marginal issue?\"\nFatwa against chemical weapons.\nIn an interview with Gareth Porter, Mohsen Rafighdoost, head of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps from 1982 until 1989, insisted Khomeini had opposed his proposal for beginning work on both nuclear and chemical weapons by a fatwa which had never been made public in details of when and how it was issued.\nRushdie fatwa.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"Fatwa\" issued 14 February 1989\nI would like to inform all the intrepid Muslims in the world that the author of the book entitled \"The Satanic Verses\", which has been compiled, printed and published in opposition to Islam, the Prophet and the Qur'an, as well as those publishers who were aware of its contents, have been declared \"madhur el dam\" [those whose blood must be shed]. I call on all zealous Muslims to execute them quickly, wherever they find them, so that no-one will dare to insult Islam again. Whoever is killed in this path will be regarded as a martyr.\nIn early 1989, Khomeini issued a fatw\u0101 (juristic ruling) calling for the assassination of Salman Rushdie, an India-born British author. Rushdie's book, \"The Satanic Verses\", published in 1988, was alleged to commit blasphemy against Islam. Khomeini's fatw\u0101 required not only Rushdie's execution, but of \"all those involved in the publication\" of the book.\nKhomeini's fatw\u0101 was condemned across the Western world by governments on the grounds that it violated the universal human rights of free speech and freedom of religion. The fatw\u0101 has also been attacked for violating the rules of fiqh by not allowing the accused an opportunity to defend himself, and because \"even the most rigorous and extreme of the classical jurist only require a Muslim to kill anyone who insults the Prophet in his hearing and in his presence.\"\nAlthough Rushdie publicly regretted \"the distress that publication has occasioned to sincere followers of Islam\", the fatwa was not revoked. The fatwa was followed by a number of killings and attempted killings. Hitoshi Igarashi, the Japanese translator of the book, was stabbed to death in 1991. Rushdie himself and two other translators of the book survived murder attempts, the last (in Rushdie's case) in August 2022. The fatwa and subsequent unrest also coincided with a surge in sales for Rushdie's work.\nLife under Khomeini.\nIn a speech on 1 February 1979 delivered to a huge crowd after returning to Iran from exile, Khomeini made a variety of promises to Iranians for his coming Islamic regime: a popularly elected government that would represent the people of Iran and with which the clergy would not interfere. He promised that \"no one should remain homeless in this country\", and that Iranians would have free telephone, heating, electricity, bus services and free oil at their doorstep.\nUnder Khomeini's rule, Iran was Islamicized. S\"haria\" (Islamic law) was introduced, with the Islamic dress code enforced for both men and women by Islamic Revolutionary Guards and other Islamic groups. Women were required to cover their hair, and men were forbidden to wear shorts. Alcoholic drinks, most Western movies, and the practice of men and women swimming or sunbathing together were banned. The Iranian educational curriculum was Islamized at all levels with the Islamic Cultural Revolution; this was out thoroughly by the Committee for Islamization of Universities. The broadcasting of any music other than martial or religious on Iranian radio and television was banned by Khomeini in July 1979. The ban lasted 10 years (approximately the rest of his life). According to Janet Afari, \"the newly established regime of Ayatollah Khomeini moved quickly to repress feminists, ethnic and religious minorities, liberals, and leftists \u2013 all in the name of Islam.\" Unfortunately in the economic sphere, promised free services did not materialize, and with rising prices, real wages for Iranians fell below a middle-class standard, pushing people into de facto poverty.\nWomen and child rights.\nKhomeini took on extensive and proactive support of the female populace during the ousting of the Shah and his subsequent homecoming, advocating for mainstreaming of women into all spheres of life and even hypothesizing about a woman head of state; however, once he returned, his stances on women's rights exhibited drastic changes. Khomeini revoked Iran's 1967 divorce law, considering any divorce granted under this law to be invalid. Nevertheless, Khomeini supported women's right to divorce as allowed by Islamic law. Khomeini reaffirmed the traditional position of rape in Islamic law in which rape by a spouse was not equivalent to rape or zina, under certain circumstances. Several fatwas by him on Women's issues include: \nA mere three weeks after assuming power, under the pretext of reversing the Shah's affinity for westernization and backed by a vocal conservative section of Iranian society, he revoked the divorce law. Under Khomeini the minimum age of marriage was lowered to 15 for boys and 13 for girls; nevertheless, the average age of women at marriage continued to increase. Laws were passed that continued to allow polygamy, and treated adultery as a high form of criminal offense. Women were compelled to wear veils and the image of Western women was carefully reconstructed as a symbol of impiety. Morality and modesty were perceived as fundamental womanly traits that needed state protection, and concepts of individual gender rights were relegated to women's social rights as ordained in Islam. Fatima was widely presented as the ideal emulatable woman. At the same time, amidst the religious orthodoxy, there was an active effort to rehabilitate women into employment. Female participation in healthcare, education and the workforce increased drastically during his regime. Reception among women of his regime has been mixed. Whilst a section were dismayed at the increasing Islamisation and concurrent degradation of women's rights, others did notice more opportunities and mainstreaming of relatively religiously conservative women.\nLGBTQ persecution.\nShortly after his accession as supreme leader in February 1979, Khomeini imposed capital punishment on homosexuals. Between February and March, sixteen Iranians were executed due to offenses related to sexual violations. Khomeini also created the Revolutionary Tribunals. According to historian Ervand Abrahamian, Khomeini encouraged the clerical courts to continue implementing their version of the Shari'a. As part of the campaign to \"cleanse\" the society, these courts executed over 100 drug addicts, prostitutes, homosexuals, rapists, and adulterers on the charge of \"sowing corruption on earth\". According to author Arno Schmitt, \"Khomeini asserted that 'homosexuals' had to be exterminated because they were parasites and corruptors of the nation by spreading the 'stain of wickedness.'\" In 1979, he had declared that the execution of homosexuals (as well as prostitutes and adulterers) was reasonable in a moral civilization in the same sense as cutting off decayed skin.\nBeing transgender, however, was designated by Khomeini as a sickness that was able to be cured through gender-affirming surgery. Since the mid-1980s, the Iranian government has legalized the practice of sex reassignment surgery (under medical approval) and the modification of pertinent legal documents to reflect the reassigned gender. In 1983, Khomeini passed a fatwa allowing gender reassignment operations as a cure for \"diagnosed transsexuals\", allowing for the basis of this practice becoming legal.\nEmigration and economy.\nKhomeini is said to have stressed \"the spiritual over the material\". Six months after his first speech he expressed exasperation with complaints about the sharp drop in Iran's standard of living, saying that: \"I cannot believe that the purpose of all these sacrifices was to have less expensive melons.\" On another occasion emphasizing the importance of martyrdom over material prosperity, he said: \"Could anyone wish his child to be martyred to obtain a good house? This is not the issue. The issue is another world.\" He also reportedly answered a question about his economic policies by declaring that 'economics is for donkeys'. This disinterest in economic policy is said to be \"one factor explaining the inchoate performance of the Iranian economy since the revolution.\" Other factors include the long war with Iraq, the cost of which led to government debt and inflation, eroding personal incomes, and unprecedented unemployment, ideological disagreement over the economy, and \"international pressure and isolation\" such as US sanctions following the hostage crisis.\nDue to the Iran\u2013Iraq War, poverty is said to have risen by nearly 45% during the first 6 years of Khomeini's rule. Emigration from Iran also developed, reportedly for the first time in the country's history. Since the revolution and war with Iraq, an estimated \"two to four million entrepreneurs, professionals, technicians, and skilled craftspeople (and their capital)\" have emigrated to other countries.\nSuppression of opposition.\nKhomeini's strategy to overthrow the shah has been described as assembling a broad coalition of disparate supporters (liberals, moderate Muslims, leftist Muslims, Marxists, poor urban youth, etc.), by never exactly explaining what he was going to do once in power, (and in fact by making promisings he could not keep). But having taken power, he not only liquidated the Shah and his apparatus of power, but began to shed his now unwanted (and incompatible) allies one-by-one (the National Democratic Front, the Provisional Government, then president Abolhassan Banisadr and the MeK guerillas, etc.), using as much force as necessary. Eventually only one faction was left\u2014namely merchants of the bazaar, often linked to the political\u2013religious hierarchy, and prospering financially from the new order. In the process many people were killed or had their human rights violated.\nMohammad Reza Shah and his family left Iran and escaped harm but hundreds of former members of the overthrown monarchy and military were executed by firing squads, with exiled critics complaining of \"secrecy, vagueness of the charges, the absence of defense lawyers or juries\", or the opportunity of the accused \"to defend themselves\".\nIn a talk at the Fayzieah School in Qom a few months after his return to Iran (on 30 August 1979), Khomeini threatened his democratic opponents: \"Those who are trying to bring corruption and destruction to our country in the name of democracy will be oppressed. They are worse than Bani-Ghorizeh Jews, and they must be hanged. We will oppress them by God's order and God's call to prayer.\"\nThe suppression of democrats was followed in later years by larger numbers of the erstwhile revolutionary allies of Khomeini's movement\u2014Marxists and socialists, mostly university students\u2014who opposed the theocratic regime. From 1980 to 1981, the People's Mojahedin Organization of Iran and other opposition groups (including leftist and moderate groups) rallied against the takeover of the Islamic Republic Party through large demonstrations. On Khomeini's order, forces of the Islamic Republic responded by shooting the demonstrators and arresting them, including their leaders. The 1981 Hafte Tir bombing escalated the conflict, leading to increasing arrests, torture, and executions of thousands of Iranians. Targets also included \"innocent, non political civilians, such as members of the Baha'i religious minority, and others deemed problematic by the IRP\". The number of those executed between 1981 and 1985's \"reign of terror\" is reported to be between 8,000 and 10,000. \nIn 1983, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) reportedly provided Khomeini with a list of Soviet KGB agents and collaborators operating in Iran, who then executed up to 200 suspects and closed down the Communist Tudeh Party of Iran.\nIn the 1988 executions of Iranian political prisoners, following the People's Mujahedin of Iran's unsuccessful attack, known as Operation Mersad, against Iran from Iraq and their support of Iraq during the Iran-Iraq war, Khomeini issued an order to judicial officials to judge every Iranian political prisoner (mostly but not all Mujahedin), and kill those judged to be apostates from Islam (\"mortad\") or \"waging war on God\" (\"moharebeh\"). Almost all of those interrogated were killed, 1,000 to 30,000 of them. Because of the large number, prisoners were loaded into forklift trucks in groups of six and hanged from cranes in half-hour intervals.\nIn 2024, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Human Rights in Iran published a report in which it categorised the purges under Khomeini, including the 1981\u20131982 massacres and the 1988 executions, as a genocide of Iran's political and religious minorities.\nMinority religions.\nZoroastrians, Jews, and Christians are officially recognized and protected by the government. Shortly after Khomeini's return from exile in 1979, he issued a fatwa ordering that Jews and other minorities (except those of the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith) be treated well. In power, Khomeini distinguished between Zionism as a secular political movement that employs Jewish symbols and ideals and Judaism as the religion of Moses. Senior government posts were reserved for Muslims. Schools set up by Jews, Christians and Zoroastrians had to be run by Muslim principals. Conversion to Islam was encouraged by entitling converts to inherit the entire share of their parents or even uncle's estate if their siblings or cousins remain non-Muslim. Iran's non-Muslim population has decreased. For example, the Jewish population in Iran dropped from 80,000 to 30,000. The Zoroastrian population has also decreased, due to suffering from renewed persecution and the revived legal contrasts between a Muslim and Zoroastrian, which mirrors the laws that Zoroastrians experienced under earlier Islamic regimes. The view that Zoroastrians are \"najis\" (\"unclean\") has also been renewed. Four of the 270 seats in Parliament were reserved for each three non-Muslim minority religions, under the Islamic constitution that Khomeini oversaw. Khomeini also called for unity between Sunni and Shi'a Muslims. Sunni Muslims make up 9% of the entire Muslim population in Iran.\nOne non-Muslim group treated differently were the 300,000 members of the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith. Starting in late 1979, the new government systematically targeted the leadership of the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed community by focusing on the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed National Spiritual Assembly (NSA) and Local Spiritual Assemblies (LSAs); prominent members of NSAs and LSAs were often detained and even executed, and \"[s]ome 200 of whom have been executed and the rest forced to convert or subjected to the most horrendous disabilities\". Like most conservative Muslims, Khomeini believed Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed to be apostates. He argued that they were a political rather than a religious movement, declaring that \"the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds are not a sect but a party, which was previously supported by Britain and now the United States. The Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds are also spies just like the Tudeh [Communist Party].\"\nEthnic minorities.\nIn a 1979 speech Khomeini hinted that the new government's attitude towards ethnicity in Iran were to curb differences instead of accepting them. \nKhomeini has been quoted as saying: \"Sometimes the word minorities is used to refer to people such as Kurds, Lurs, Turks, Persians, Baluchis, and such. These people should not be called minorities because this term assumes there is a difference between these brothers.\"\nIn 1979, before Khommeini had consolidated power, a Kurdish delegation traveled to Qom to present the Kurds' demands to Khomeini. Their demands included language rights and the provision for a degree of political autonomy. Khomeini responded that such demands were unacceptable since it involved the division of the Iranian nation. The following months saw numerous clashes between Kurdish militia groups and the Revolutionary Guards. The referendum on the Islamic Republic was massively boycotted in Kurdistan, where it was thought 85 to 90% of voters abstained. Khomeini ordered additional attacks later on in the year, and by September most of Iranian Kurdistan was under direct martial law.\nDeath and funeral.\nKhomeini's health declined several years prior to his death. After spending eleven days in Jamaran hospital, he died on 3 June 1989 after suffering five heart attacks in ten days.\nLarge numbers of Iranians took to the streets to publicly mourn his death and in the scorching summer heat, fire trucks sprayed water on the crowds to cool them. At least 10 mourners were trampled to death, more than 400 were badly hurt and several thousand more were treated for injuries sustained in the ensuing pandemonium.\nOn 5 June, the coffin with Khomeini's body was put on display in north Tehran allowing hundreds of thousands of mourners to see the body. \nThe next day it was determined that the planned funeral procession to the cemetery would be impossible because several million mourners had gathered and blocked the streets. Eventually after the Salat al-Janazah (funeral prayer) lead by Grand Ayatollah Mohammad-Reza Golpaygani, the body was flown by helicopter to the cemetery.\nAt the cemetery, the crowd surged past the makeshift barriers and the authorities lost control of the events. According to journalist John Kifner of \"The New York Times\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The crowd, much of it made up of Revolutionary Guards detailed to maintain order, pulled the coffin from the helicopter and began parading it around the makeshift compound surrounding the gravesite. As the excitement grew, the body of the Ayatollah, wrapped in a white burial shroud, fell out of the flimsy wooden coffin, and in a mad scene people in the crowd reached to touch the shroud. The soldiers pushed and wrestled, finally firing warning shots, to get the body back. Ayatollah Khomeini's son, Ahmad, was knocked from his feet. But even as the soldiers pushed the body back into the helicopter, the crowd swarmed over the craft, dragging it back down as it tried to take off. Others jumped into the hole dug for the Ayatollah's body. The troops drove the crowd back, finally clearing the compound enough to allow the helicopter to take off, its rotors scattering more mourners.\nThe second funeral was held under much tighter security five hours later. This time, Khomeini's casket was made of steel, and in accordance with Islamic tradition, the casket was only to carry the body to the burial site. In 1995, his son Ahmad was buried next to him. Khomeini's grave is now housed within a larger mausoleum complex.\nSuccession.\nGrand Ayatollah Hussein-Ali Montazeri, a former student of Khomeini and a major figure of the Revolution, was chosen by Khomeini to be his successor as Supreme Leader and approved as such by the Assembly of Experts in November 1985. The principle of \"velayat-e faqih\" and the Islamic constitution called for the Supreme Leader to be a \"marja\" (a grand ayatollah), and of the dozen or so grand ayatollahs living in 1981 only Montazeri qualified as a potential Leader (this was either because only he accepted totally Khomeini's concept of rule by Islamic jurists, or, as at least one other source stated, because only Montazeri had the \"political credentials\" Khomeini found suitable for his successor). The execution of Mehdi Hashemi in September 1987 on charges of counterrevolutionary activities was a blow to Ayatollah Montazeri, who knew Hashemi since their childhood. In 1989 Montazeri began to call for liberalization, freedom for political parties. Following the execution of thousands of political prisoners by the Islamic government, Montazeri told Khomeini: \"Your prisons are far worse than those of the Shah and his SAVAK.\" After a letter of his complaints was leaked to Europe and broadcast on the BBC, a furious Khomeini ousted him in March 1989 from his position as official successor. His portraits were removed from offices and mosques.\nTo deal with the disqualification of the only suitable \"marja\", Khomeini called for an \"Assembly for Revising the Constitution\" to be convened. An amendment was made to Iran's constitution removing the requirement that the Supreme Leader be a Marja and this allowed Ali Khamenei, the new favoured jurist who had suitable revolutionary credentials but lacked scholarly ones and who was not a Grand Ayatollah, to be designated as successor. Ayatollah Khamenei was elected Supreme Leader by the Assembly of Experts on 4 June 1989. Montazeri continued his criticism of the regime and in 1997 was put under house arrest for questioning what he regarded to be an unaccountable rule exercised by the supreme leader.\nAnniversary.\nThe anniversary of Khomeini's death is a public holiday. To commemorate Khomeini, people visit his mausoleum placed on Behesht-e Zahra to hear sermons and practice prayers on his death day.\nReception, political thought and legacy.\nAccording to at least one scholar (Ali Reza Eshraghi), politics in the Islamic Republic of Iran \"are largely defined by attempts to claim Khomeini's legacy\" and that \"staying faithful to his ideology has been the litmus test for all political activity\" there. Throughout his many writings and speeches, Khomeini's views on governance evolved. Originally declaring rule by monarchs or others permissible so long as sharia law was followed, Khomeini later opposed Shah adamantly opposed monarchy, arguing that only rule by a leading Islamic jurist (a marja') would ensure Sharia was properly followed (vel\u00e2yat-e faqih), before finally insisting the ruling jurist need not be a leading one and Sharia rule could be overruled by that jurist if necessary to serve the interests of Islam and the \"divine government\" of the Islamic state.\nKhomeini's concept of (\u0648\u0644\u0627\u06cc\u062a \u0641\u0642\u06cc\u0647, \"velayat-e faqih\") as Islamic government did not win the support of the leading Iranian Shi'i clergy of the time. Towards the 1979 Revolution, many clerics gradually became disillusioned with the rule of the Shah, although none came around to supporting Khomeini's vision of a theocratic Islamic Republic.\nDemocracy.\nThere is much debate to as whether Khomeini's ideas are or are not compatible with democracy and whether he intended the Islamic Republic to be a democratic republic. According to the state-run \"Aftab News\", both ultraconservative supporters (Mohammad Taghi Mesbah Yazdi) and reformist opponents of the regime (Akbar Ganji and Abdolkarim Soroush) believe he did not while regime officials and supporters, such as Ali Khamenei, Mohammad Khatami, and Mortaza Motahhari, maintain the Islamic republic is democratic as Khomeini intended it to be. Khomeini himself also made statements at different times indicating both support and opposition to democracy.\nOne scholar, Shaul Bakhash, explains this contradiction as coming from Khomeini's belief that the huge turnout of Iranians in anti-Shah demonstrations during the revolution constituted a \"referendum\" in favor of an Islamic republic, more important than any elections. Khomeini also wrote that since Muslims must support a government based on Islamic law, Sharia-based government will always have more popular support in Muslim countries than any government based on elected representatives.\nKhomeini's policies aimed to position Iran as the \"champion of all Muslims, regardless of sect\", by making Iran to be the main \"hardline opponent of the Jewish state\". Khomeini offered himself as a \"champion of Islamic revival\" and unity, emphasizing issues Muslims agreed upon\u2014the fight against Zionism and imperialism\u2014and downplaying Shia issues that would divide Shia from Sunni. The Egyptian Jihadist ideologue Sayyid Qutb was an important source of influence to Khomeini and the 1979 Iranian Revolution. The Islamic Republic of Iran under Khomeini honoured Qutb's \"martyrdom\" by issuing an iconic postage stamp in 1984, and before the revolution prominent figures in the Khomeini network translated Qutb's works into Persian. While he publicly spoke of Islamic unity and minimized differences with Sunni Muslims, he is accused by some of privately rebuking Sunni Islam as heretical and covertly promoted an anti-Sunni foreign policy in the region.\nPublic image.\nKhomeini has been lauded as politically astute, a \"charismatic leader of immense popularity\", a \"champion of Islamic revival\" by Shia scholars, and a major innovator in political theory and religious-oriented populist political strategy. Khomeini strongly opposed close relations with either Eastern or Western Bloc nations, believing the Islamic world should be its own bloc or rather converge into a single unified power. He viewed Western culture as being inherently decadent and a corrupting influence upon the youth. The Islamic Republic banned or discouraged popular Western fashions, music, cinema, and literature.\nIn the Western world it is said \"his glowering visage became the virtual face of Islam in Western popular culture\" and \"inculcated fear and distrust towards Islam\", making the word \"Ayatollah\" \"a synonym for a dangerous madman ... in popular parlance\". This has particularly been the case in the United States where some Iranians complained that even at universities, they felt the need to hide their Iranian identity for fear of physical attack. There Khomeini and the Islamic Republic are remembered for the American embassy hostage taking and are accused of sponsoring hostage-taking and terrorist attacks, leading to the American government levying economic sanctions against Iran.\nClash with liberals and leftists.\nBefore taking power, Khomeini expressed support for the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, saying: \"We would like to act according to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. We would like to be free. We would like independence.\" Once in power, Khomeini took a firm line against dissent, threatening opponents of theocracy for example: \"I repeat for the last time: abstain from holding meetings, from blathering, from publishing protests. Otherwise I will break your teeth.\"\nPrior to the revolution, many of Khomeini's political and religious ideas were considered to be progressive and reformist by leftist intellectuals and activists. Once in power, his ideas often clashed with those of modernist or secular Iranian intellectuals. This conflict came to a head during the writing of the Islamic constitution when many newspapers were closed by the government. Khomeini angrily told the intellectuals: \"Yes, we are reactionaries, and you are enlightened intellectuals: You intellectuals do not want us to go back 1400 years. You, who want freedom, freedom for everything, the freedom of parties, you who want all the freedoms, you intellectuals: freedom that will corrupt our youth, freedom that will pave the way for the oppressor, freedom that will drag our nation to the bottom.\"\nThird world solidarity.\nIn contrast to his alienation from Iranian intellectuals, and \"in an utter departure from all other Islamist movements\", Khomeini embraced international revolution and Third World solidarity, giving it \"precedence over Muslim fraternity\". From the time Khomeini's supporters gained control of the media until his death, the Iranian media \"devoted extensive coverage to non-Muslim revolutionary movements (from the Sandinistas to the African National Congress and the Irish Republican Army) and downplayed the role of the Islamic movements considered conservative, such as the Afghan mujahidin.\" Khomeini's supporters and pro-government media in Iran also argue that he was a fighter against racism, as Khomeini was a staunch critic of the Apartheid regime in South Africa. After the 1979 Iranian Revolution, anti-Apartheid activist and African National Congress president Oliver Tambo sent a letter to congratulate Khomeini for the success of the revolution. Former South African President Nelson Mandela stated several times that Khomeini served as an inspiration for the anti-apartheid movement. During the 1979 Iran hostage crisis, Khomeini ordered the release of all female and African-American staff working there.\nEconomics.\nKhomeini's legacy to the economy of the Islamic Republic has been expressions of concern for the \"mustazafin\" (a Quranic term for the oppressed or deprived), but not always results that aided them. During the 1990s, the \"mustazafin\" and disabled war veterans rioted on several occasions, protesting the demolition of their shantytowns and rising food prices, among others. Khomeini's disdain for the science of economics is said to have been \"mirrored\" by the populist redistribution policies of former president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who allegedly wears \"his contempt for economic orthodoxy as a badge of honour\", and has overseen sluggish growth and rising inflation and unemployment.\nTranssexuality.\nIn 1963, Khomeini wrote a book in which he stated that there is no religious restriction on corrective surgery for transgender individuals. At the time Khomeini was an anti-Shah revolutionary and his fatwas did not carry any weight with the imperial government, which did not have any specific policies regarding transsexual individuals.\nAfter 1979, his fatwa \"formed the basis for a national policy\" and perhaps in part because of a penal code that \"allows for the execution of homosexuals\". As of 2005, Iran \"permits and partly finances seven times as many gender reassignment operations as the entire European Union\".\nAppearance and habits.\nKhomeini was described as \"slim\", but athletic and \"heavily boned\". He was also known for his punctuality:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;He's so punctual that if he doesn't turn up for lunch at exactly ten past everyone will get worried, because his work is regulated in such a way that he turned up for lunch at exactly that time every day. He goes to bed exactly on time. He eats exactly on time. And he wakes up exactly on time. He changes his cloak every time he comes back from the mosque.\nKhomeini was known for his aloofness and austere demeanor. He is said to have had \"variously inspired admiration, awe, and fear from those around him.\" His practice of moving \"through the halls of the madresehs never smiling at anybody or anything; his practice of ignoring his audience while he taught, contributed to his charisma.\" Khomeini adhered to traditional beliefs of Islamic hygienical jurisprudence holding that things like urine, excrement, blood, wine, and also non-Muslims were some of the eleven ritualistically \"impure\" things that physical contact with which while wet required ritual washing or Ghusl before prayer or salat. He is reported to have refused to eat or drink in a restaurant unless he knew for sure the waiter was a Muslim.\nMystique.\nAccording to Baqer Moin, with the success of the revolution, not only had a personality cult developed around Khomeini, but he \"had been transformed into a semi-divine figure. He was no longer a grand ayatollah and deputy of the Imam, one who represents the Hidden Imam, but simply \"The Imam\". Khomeini's cult of personality fills a central position in foreign- and domestically targeted Iranian publications. The methods used to create his personality cult have been compared to those used by such figures as Joseph Stalin, Mao Zedong and Fidel Castro. An 8th-century Hadith attributed to the Imam Musa al-Kazim that said \"A man will come out from Qom and he will summon people to the right path. There will rally to him people resembling pieces of iron, not to be shaken by violent winds, unsparing and relying on God\" was repeated in Iran as a tribute to Khomeini. (In Lebanon, however, this saying was also attributed to Musa al-Sadr.)\nKhomeini was the first and only Iranian cleric to be addressed as \"Imam\", a title hitherto reserved in Iran for the twelve infallible leaders of the early Shi'a. He was also associated with the \"Mahdi\" or 12th Imam of Shia belief in a number of ways. One of his titles was \"Na'eb-e Imam\" (Deputy to the Twelfth Imam). His enemies were often attacked as \"taghut\" and \"Mofsed-e-filarz\", religious terms used for enemies of the Twelfth Imam. Many of the officials of the overthrown Shah's government executed by Revolutionary Courts were convicted of \"fighting against the Twelfth Imam\". When a deputy in the majlis asked Khomeini directly if he was the \"promised Mahdi\", Khomeini did not answer, \"astutely\" neither confirming nor denying the title.\nAs the revolution gained momentum, even some non-supporters exhibited awe towards Khomeini, called him \"magnificently clear-minded, single-minded and unswerving\". His image was as \"absolute, wise, and indispensable leader of the nation\":\nThe Imam, it was generally believed, had shown by his uncanny sweep to power that he knew how to act in ways which others could not begin to understand. His timing was extraordinary, and his insight into the motivation of others, those around him as well as his enemies, could not be explained as ordinary knowledge. This emergent belief in Khomeini as a divinely guided figure was carefully fostered by the clerics who supported him and spoke up for him in front of the people.\nEven many secularists who firmly disapproved of his policies were said to feel the power of his \"messianic\" appeal. Comparing him to a father figure who retains the enduring loyalty even of children he disapproves of, journalist Afshin Molavi writes that defenses of Khomeini are \"heard in the most unlikely settings\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;A whiskey-drinking professor told an American journalist that Khomeini brought pride back to Iranians. A women's rights activist told me that Khomeini was not the problem; it was his conservative allies who had directed him wrongly. A nationalist war veteran, who held Iran's ruling clerics in contempt, carried with him a picture of 'the Imam'.\nAnother journalist tells the story of listening to bitter criticism of the regime by an Iranian who tells her of his wish for his son to leave the country and who \"repeatedly\" makes the point \"that life had been better\" under the Shah. When his complaint is interrupted by news that \"the Imam\" \u2013 over 85 years old at the time and known to be ailing \u2013 might be dying, the critic becomes \"ashen faced\" and speechless, pronouncing the news to be \"terrible for my country\". Non-Iranians were not immune from the effect. In 1982, after listening to a half-hour-long speech on the Quran by him, a Muslim scholar from South Africa, Sheikh Ahmad Deedat gushed:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;... the electric effect he had on everybody, his charisma, was amazing. You just look at the man and tears come down your cheek. You just look at him and you get tears. I never saw a more handsome old man in my life, no picture, no video, no TV could do justice to this man, the handsomest old man I ever saw in my life was this man.\nFamily and descendants.\nIn 1929, or possibly 1931, Khomeini married Khadijeh Saqafi, the daughter of a cleric in Tehran. Some sources report that Khomeini married Saqafi when she was ten years old, while others state that she was fifteen years old. By all accounts, their marriage was harmonious and happy. She died on 21 March 2009 at the age of 93. They had seven children, though only five survived infancy. His daughters all married into either merchant or clerical families, and both his sons entered into religious life. Mostafa, the elder son, died in 1977 while in exile in Najaf, Iraq with his father and was rumored by supporters of his father to have been murdered by SAVAK. Ahmad Khomeini, who died in 1995 at the age of 50, was also rumoured to be a victim of foul play but this time at the hands of Ali Khamenei's regime. Zahra Mostafavi, a professor at the University of Tehran and still alive, is perhaps his \"most prominent daughter\".\nKhomeini's fifteen grandchildren include:\nBibliography.\nKhomeini was a writer and speaker (200 of his books are online) who authored commentaries on the Qur'an, on Islamic jurisprudence, the roots of Islamic law, and Islamic traditions. He also released books about philosophy, gnosticism, poetry, literature, government, and politics. His books include:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "26239", "revid": "42407475", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26239", "title": "Rhineland-Palatinate", "text": "State in Germany\nRhineland-Palatinate ( , ; ; ; ) is a western state of Germany. It covers and has about 4.05 million residents. It is the ninth largest and sixth most populous of the sixteen states. Mainz is the capital and largest city. Other cities are Ludwigshafen am Rhein, Koblenz, Trier, Kaiserslautern, Worms, and Neuwied. It is bordered by North Rhine-Westphalia, Saarland, Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg and Hesse and by France, Luxembourg and Belgium.\nRhineland-Palatinate was established in 1946 after World War II, from parts of the former states of Prussia (part of its Rhineland and Nassau provinces), Hesse (Rhenish Hesse) and Bavaria (its former outlying Palatinate kreis or district), by the French military administration in Allied-occupied Germany. Rhineland-Palatinate became part of the Federal Republic of Germany in 1949 and shared the country's only border with the Saar Protectorate until the latter was returned to German control in 1957. Rhineland-Palatinate's natural and cultural heritage includes the extensive Palatinate winegrowing region, picturesque landscapes, and many castles and palaces.\nRhineland-Palatinate is currently the only federal state in Germany where nuclear weapons are stored extraterritorially under the responsibility and supervision of US forces at B\u00fcchel Air Base.\nSeveral German-American ethnicities originated from this state, such as the Pennsylvania Dutch, Maryland Palatines, Ohio Rhinelanders, and Missouri Rhinelanders.\nHistory.\nThe state of Rhineland-Palatinate was founded shortly after the Second World War, on 30 August 1946. It was formed mainly from the southern part of the Prussian Rhine Province (the of Koblenz and Trier), from Rhenish Hesse, from the western part of Nassau and the Bavarian Rhenish Palatinate minus the county of Saarpfalz. The Joint German-Luxembourg Sovereign Region () is the only unincorporated area of the state of Rhineland-Palatinate. This condominium is formed by the rivers Moselle, Sauer, and Our, where they run along the border between Luxembourg and Rhineland-Palatinate or the Saarland. The region has a vast history, from the control of the Franks, to the control of the Holy Roman Empire, and saw fighting during the First and Second World Wars.\nEmergence.\nThe present state of Rhineland-Palatinate formed part of the French Zone of Occupation (1945\u20131949) after the Second World War. It comprised the former Bavarian Palatinate, the (\"government districts\") of Koblenz and Trier (which formed the southern part of the Prussian Rhine Province), the parts of the Province of Rhenish Hesse () west of the River Rhine and belonged to the People's State of Hesse (), parts of the Prussian province of Hesse-Nassau (Montabaur), and the former Oldenburg region around Birkenfeld (Principality of Birkenfeld).\nOn 10 July 1945, the occupation authority on the soil of the present-day Rhineland-Palatinate transferred from the Americans to the French. To begin with, the French divided the region provisionally into two \"upper presidiums\" (), Rhineland-Hesse-Nassau (for the hitherto Prussian government districts and regions of Koblenz, Trier, and Montabaur) and Hesse-Palatinate (for the hitherto Bavarian Palatinate and old Hessian-Darmstadt province of Rhenish Hesse). The formation of the state was ordained on 30 August 1946, the last state in the Western Zone of Occupation to be established, by Regulation No. 57 of the French military government under General Marie-Pierre K\u0153nig. It was initially called Rhenish-Palatinate ( or ); the name Rhineland-Palatinate () was first confirmed in the constitution of 18 May 1947.\nThe provisional French government at that time wanted originally to leave the option open of annexing further areas west of the Rhine after the Saarland was turned into a protectorate. When the Americans and British, however had led the way with the establishment of German states, the French came under increasing pressure and eventually followed their example by setting up the states of Baden, W\u00fcrttemberg-Hohenzollern, and Rhineland-Palatinate. However the French military government forbade the Saarland from joining Rhineland-Palatinate. Mainz was named as the state capital in the regulation; the \"Mixed Commission\" (), named as the highest organ of state charged with the administration of the new state and with the preparation of an advisory state assembly, started its work in Mainz. However war damage and destruction meant that Mainz did not have enough administrative buildings, so the headquarters of the state government and parliament was provisionally established in Koblenz. On 22 November 1946, the constituent meeting of the Advisory State Assembly () took place there, and a draft constitution was drawn up. Previously, local elections had been held. Wilhelm Boden was (after a short term of office as the of Rhineland-Hesse-Nassau) nominated on 2 December as the minister president of the new state by the French military government.\nEarly years.\nAdolf S\u00fcsterhenn submitted to the Advisory State Assembly a draft constitution, which was passed after several rounds of negotiation on 25 April 1947 in a final vote, with the absolute majority of the CDU voting for and the SPD and KPD voting against. A point of contention involved the draft constitution providing for separate schools based on Christian denomination. On 18 May 1947, 53% of the electorate adopted the Constitution for Rhineland-Palatinate in a referendum. While the Catholic north and west of the new state adopted the constitution by a majority, the majority in Rhenish Hesse and the Palatinate voted against it. On the same date the first elections took place for the state parliament, the Landtag of Rhineland-Palatinate. The inaugural assembly of parliament took place on 4 June 1947 in the large city hall at Koblenz. Wilhelm Boden was elected the first minister-president of Rhineland-Palatinate. Just one month later, Peter Altmeier succeeded him.\nThe constitutional bodies \u2013 the Government (), the Parliament () and the Constitutional Court () \u2013 established their provisional seat in Koblenz. In the following period, Koblenz and Mainz each emphasized their suitability as the state capital in a public debate. From the beginning, Minister-President Altmeier pressed for Mainz as the capital because he knew that the south of the country, especially the Palatinate, would not accept Koblenz, which was far to the north and formerly Prussian. On 16 May 1950, the decided to relocate itself and the from Koblenz to Mainz.\nAfter the government and parliament moved to Mainz, many state authorities and courts remained in Koblenz, including the Constitutional Court and the State Archives. In addition, the German Federal Archives and Federal Office of Hydrology were established in Koblenz in 1952.\nConsolidation.\nA sense of community developed only very gradually in the \"land of the retort\", which had been established largely without regard to the historical affiliations of its inhabitants. It was given little chance of survival, especially as it had very few large industrial centres. However, the establishment of numerous military bases, both Allied and , helped to some extent to boost the economy. In 1956, under Article 29 of the Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany, petitions were made in the regions of Koblenz, Trier, Montabaur, Rhenish Hesse, and Palatinate for their separation from the state and incorporation into the respective states of North Rhine-Westphalia, Hesse, Bavaria, and Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg. All petitions for a referendum except those in the administrative district of Palatinate won the necessary majority; however, almost 20 years passed before the referendums finally took place. On 19 January 1975, none of the regions concerned returned a majority for being transferred to another state. This put an end to decades of discussion. Only the AKK conflict, a dispute over the districts of Mainz-Am\u00f6neburg, Mainz-Kastel, and Mainz-Kostheim, has continued to exercise politicians up to the present day.\nGeography.\nRhineland-Palatinate shares international borders with France (Grand Est), Luxembourg (Clervaux, Diekirch, Echternach, Grevenmacher, Remich, and Vianden), and Belgium (Wallonia). Within Germany, its neighbors are Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, Hesse, North Rhine-Westphalia, and the Saarland. It is the ninth-largest state by area. Rhineland-Palatinate is part of the SaarLorLux euregion.\nWith 42% of its area covered by forests, it is the most forested state along with Hesse. The state's major rivers are the Rhine, including the UNESCO World Heritage Site Middle Rhine, and the Moselle. Several crater lakes of volcanic origin are in the Eifel, the largest of which is the Laacher See.\nClimatically, Rhineland-Palatinate can be divided into two areas:\nThe Rhenish Massif with a typically humid continental climate (Dfb). Summers here are usually warm with much precipitation and winters tend to be dry and cold. Snowfall is a common occasion.\nThe deep valleys of Rhine and Moselle with an oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification: \"Cfb\"). Summers are hot and moist, while winters are cool. Freezing temperatures are rare and snow usually melts within hours. The mild climate allows palm trees, fig trees, stone pines, oleander shrubs, olive trees, almond trees and other exotic plants to be grown in this area.\nThe forests in this region are home to common pests such as \"Melolontha hippocastani\", that cause damage to the foliage and soil.\nThe Rhenish Massif forms roughly the northern half of the state, including the regions Eifel, Moselle Valley, Hunsr\u00fcck, Westerwald, and parts of the Taunus. The Palatinate forms the biggest part of the southern half along with Rhenish Hesse. The Nahe Valley separates both parts.\nAdministration.\nRhineland-Palatinate is divided into 24 districts (\"Landkreise\"), 12 independent cities (\"Kreisfreie St\u00e4dte\").\nDistricts.\nListing with Vehicle registration plates of Germany\nIndependent cities.\nListing with Vehicle registration plates of Germany\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nLargest cities.\nThe following table shows the ten largest cities of Rhineland-Palatinate:\nReligion.\nIn 2018, 40.3% of the population of the state adhered to the Roman Catholic Church and 26.8% to the Protestant Church in Germany; 32.9% of the population was irreligious or adheres to other religions. Muslims made up 5.0% of the total.\nJewish culture.\nThe league of ShUM-cities in the later Rhineland-Palatinate comprised the Jewish communities of Mainz, Speyer, and Worms, which became the center of Jewish life during medieval times. The \"Takkanot Shum\" (), or Enactments of ShU\"M were a set of decrees formulated and agreed upon over a period of decades by their Jewish community leaders. Today, there are approximately 20,000 Jews (0.5% of the population) living in the state.\nEconomy.\nThe gross domestic product (GDP) of the state was 147.0 billion euros in 2018, accounting for 4.4% of German economic output. GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was 33,100 euros or 110% of the EU27 average in the same year. The GDP per employee was 102% of the EU average.\nIndustry.\nRhineland-Palatinate leads all German states with an export rate around 50%. Important sectors are the winegrowing, chemical, pharmaceutical, and auto parts industries. \"Distinctive regional industries\" includes gemstones, ceramics and glass, and leather. Small and medium enterprises are considered the \"backbone\" of the economy in Rhineland-Palatinate. The principal employer is the chemical and plastics processing industry, which is represented by BASF in Ludwigshafen. Boehringer, BioNTech, Joh. A. Benckiser, SGE Deutsche Holding, and Schott Glassworks conclude the top five companies in the state.\nAgriculture and viticulture.\nRhineland-Palatinate is Germany's leading producer of wine in terms of grape cultivation and wine export. Its capital, Mainz, may be called the capital of the German wine industry, being the home of the German Wine Institute, the German Wine Fund in the {{lang|de|Haus des Deutschen Weines}} (House of German Wine), and the {{lang|de|Verband Deutscher Pr\u00e4dikatsweing\u00fcter}} (VDP) Wine Bourse, which brings together the top winemakers of Germany and the wine merchants of the world.\nOf 13 wine regions producing quality wine in Germany, six ({{lang|de|Rheinhessen, Pfalz, Mosel, Nahe, Mittelrhein}}, and {{lang|de|Ahr}}) are located in Rhineland-Palatinate, with 65 to 70% of the production of wine grapes in Germany having their origin within the state. About 13,000 wine producers generate 80 to 90% of the German wine export. The total estimated production from the six Rhineland-Palatinate regions was nearly 7\u00a0million\u00a0hectoliters in 2018.\nTraditional grape varieties and a wide range of varieties developed during the last 125 years are characteristic for the region.\nClassical white varieties are cultivated at {{convert|63683|ha|acre}}. These comprise the famous Rieslings {{convert|14446|ha|acre}}, {{lang|de|M\u00fcller-Thurgau}} ({{convert|8663|ha|acre}}), {{lang|de|Silvaner}} ({{convert|3701|ha|acre}}), and {{lang|de|Kerner}} ({{convert|3399|ha|acre}}).\nThe share of red varieties grew constantly during the last decades and amounts to {{convert|20000|ha|acre}}. {{lang|de|Dornfelder}}, a recent cultivar, is the leading red grape cultivated on {{convert|7626|ha|acre}}, which is more than a third. {{lang|de|Blauer Portugieser}} ({{convert|4446|ha|acre}}) and {{lang|de|Sp\u00e4tburgunder}} ({{convert|3867|ha|acre}}) show also appreciable cultivated shares.\nIn addition, {{lang|fr|Pinot blanc}}, {{lang|fr|Pinot gris}}, Chardonnay as white varieties and Regent and St. Laurent as red varieties have been increasing their share, as the growing conditions improve in Rhineland-Palatinate.\nThe state supports the wine industry by providing a comprehensive consultancy and education program in the service supply centers ({{langx|de|DLR|links=no}}) of the land. The Geilweilerhof Institute for Grape Breeding is fully financed by the state. Many well-known new varieties such as {{lang|de|Morio-Muskat}}, Bacchus, Optima, and Regent have been created in these institutes.\nThe worldwide leader in sparkling wine production, producing 224,4\u00a0million bottles in 2017/18, is the renowned {{lang|de|Schloss Wachenheim}} Group. This company is headquartered in Trier, with operations in several locations in Rhineland-Palatinate and three sites in France (Compagnie Fran\u00e7aise des Grands Vins (CFGV)).\nOther renowned sparkling wine producers such as {{lang|de|Kupferberg}}, {{lang|de|Deinhard}}, and {{lang|de|Henkell}} also had their roots in the region, but now belong to companies outside the state as a result of business consolidation.\nUnemployment.\nThe unemployment rate stood at 4.4% in October 2018 and was lower than the German average.\nTransport.\nAir.\nThe state is served by Hahn Airport located in Lautzenhausen, the airport provides flights to some European destinations which are operated by low cost airlines. Residents of the state normally use other airports such as Frankfurt Airport, Luxembourg Airport, Saarbr\u00fccken Airport, and Cologne Bonn Airport to fly to other domestic and international destinations."}
{"id": "26240", "revid": "7611264", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26240", "title": "House of Romanov", "text": "Imperial dynasty of Russia (1613\u20131917)\nThe House of Romanov (also transliterated as Romanoff. , ) was the reigning imperial house of Russia from 1613 to 1917. They achieved prominence after Anastasia Romanovna married Ivan the Terrible, the first crowned tsar of all Russia. Nicholas II, the last Emperor of Russia, and his immediate family were executed in 1918, but there are still living descendants of other members of the imperial house.\nThe house consisted of boyars in Russia (the highest rank in the Russian nobility at the time) under the reigning Rurik dynasty, which became extinct upon the death of Feodor I in 1598. The Time of Troubles, caused by the resulting succession crisis, saw several pretenders and imposters lay claim to the Russian throne during the Polish-Lithuanian occupation. On 21 February 1613, the Zemsky Sobor elected Michael Romanov as tsar, establishing the Romanovs as Russia's second reigning dynasty.\nMichael's grandson, Peter I, who took the title of emperor and proclaimed the Russian Empire in 1721, transformed the country into a great power through a series of wars and reforms. The direct male line of the Romanovs ended when Elizabeth died childless in 1762. As a result, her nephew Peter III, an agnatic member of the House of Holstein-Gottorp (a cadet branch of the German House of Oldenburg), ascended to the throne and adopted his Romanov mother's house name. Officially known as members of the House of Romanov, descendants after Elizabeth are sometimes referred to as \"Holstein-Gottorp-Romanov\".\nPaul I became the first heir to the throne, having the title \"tsesarevich\", which was subsequently used for all main heirs.\nThe abdication of Nicholas II on 15 March\u00a0[O.S. 2 March]\u00a01917 as a result of the February Revolution ended 304 years of Romanov rule and led to the establishment of the Russian Republic under the Russian Provisional Government in the lead-up to the Russian Civil War of 1917\u20131922. In 1918, the Bolsheviks executed Nicholas II and his family. Of the House of Romanov's 65 members, 47 survivors went into exile abroad. In 1924, Grand Duke Kirill Vladimirovich, the senior surviving male-line descendant of Alexander II of Russia by primogeniture, claimed the headship of the defunct Imperial House of Russia.\nSurname usage.\nLegally, it remains unclear whether any \"ukase\" ever abolished the surname of Michael Romanov (or of his subsequent male-line descendants) after his accession to the Russian throne in 1613, although by tradition members of reigning dynasties seldom use surnames, being known instead by dynastic titles (\"Tsarevich Ivan Alexeevich\", \"Grand Duke Nikolai Nikolaevich\", etc.). From January 1762 [O.S. December 1761], the monarchs of the Russian Empire claimed the throne as relatives of Grand Duchess Anna Petrovna of Russia (1708\u20131728), who had married Charles Frederick, Duke of Holstein-Gottorp. Thus they were no longer Romanovs by patrilineage, belonging instead to the Holstein-Gottorp cadet branch of the German House of Oldenburg that reigned in Denmark. The 1944 edition of the \"Almanach de Gotha\" records the name of Russia's ruling dynasty from the time of Peter\u00a0III (reigned 1761\u20131762) as \"Holstein-Gottorp-Romanov\". However, the terms \"Romanov\" and \"House of Romanov\" often occurred in official references to the Russian imperial family. The coat-of-arms of the Romanov boyars was included in legislation on the imperial dynasty,\nand in a 1913 jubilee, Russia officially celebrated the \"300th Anniversary of the Romanovs' rule\".\nAfter the February Revolution of 1917, a special decree of the Provisional Government of Russia granted all members of the imperial family the surname \"Romanov\". The only exceptions, the morganatic descendants of the Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich (1891\u20131942), took (in exile) the surname .\nHistory.\nOrigins.\nThe Romanovs share their origin with two dozen other Russian noble families. Their earliest common ancestor is one Andrei Kobyla, attested around 1347 as a boyar in the service of Simeon, the prince of Moscow and grand prince of Vladimir. Later generations assigned to Kobyla an illustrious pedigree. An 18th-century genealogy claimed that he was the son of the Old Prussian prince Glanda Kambila, who came to Russia in the second half of the 13th century, fleeing the invading Germans. Indeed, one of the leaders of the Old Prussian rebellion of 1260\u20131274 against the Teutonic order was named Glande. This legendary version of the Romanov's origin is contested by another version of descent from a boyar family from Novgorod.\nOne of Kobyla's sons, Feodor, a member of the boyar duma of Dmitry Donskoy, was nicknamed Koshka (\"cat\"). His descendants took the surname Koshkin, then changed it to Zakharin (descendants of Zakhary), which later split into two branches: Zakharin-Yakovlev (descendants of Yakov Zakharyevich) and Zakharin-Yuriev (descendants of Yuri Zakharyevich). During the reign of Ivan the Terrible, the former became known as Yakovlev (Alexander Herzen among them), whereas the grandchildren of Roman Yurievich Zakharyin-Yuriev changed their name to \"Romanov\".\nFeodor Nikitich Romanov was descended from the Rurik dynasty through the female line. His mother, Evdokiya Gorbataya-Shuyskaya, was a Rurikid princess from the Shuysky branch, daughter of Alexander Gorbatyi-Shuisky. A ninth generation ancestor of Michael I Romanov is Dimitri Konstantinovich.\nRise to power.\nThe family fortunes soared when Roman's daughter, Anastasia Zakharyina, married Ivan IV (\"the Terrible\") on 3 (13) February 1547. Since her husband had assumed the title of Tsar of all Russia, which derives from the title \"Caesar\", on 16 January 1547, she was crowned as the first tsaritsa of Russia. Her mysterious death in 1560 changed Ivan's character for the worse. Suspecting the boyars of having poisoned his beloved, Ivan launched a reign of terror against them. Among his children by Anastasia, the eldest, Ivan, was murdered by the tsar in a quarrel; the younger Feodor, a pious but lethargic prince, inherited the throne upon his father's death in 1584.\nThroughout Feodor's reign (1584\u20131598), the tsar's brother-in-law, Boris Godunov, and his Romanov cousins contested the \"de facto\" rule of Russia. Upon the childless death of Feodor, the 700-year-old line of the Rurik dynasty came to an end, ushering in the Time of Troubles. After a long struggle, the party of Boris Godunov prevailed over the Romanovs, and the \"Zemsky Sobor\" elected Godunov as tsar in 1598. Godunov's revenge on the Romanovs led to all the family and its relations being deported to remote corners of the Russian North and Urals, where most of them died of hunger or in chains. The family's leader, Feodor Nikitich Romanov, was exiled to the Antoniev Siysky Monastery and forced to take monastic vows with the name Filaret.\nThe Romanovs' fortunes again changed dramatically with the fall of the Godunov dynasty in June 1605. As a former leader of the anti-Godunov party and cousin of the last legitimate tsar, Filaret Romanov's recognition was sought by several impostors who attempted to claim the Rurikid legacy and throne during the Time of Troubles. False Dmitriy I made him a metropolitan, and False Dmitriy II raised him to the dignity of patriarch. Upon the expulsion of the Polish army from Moscow in 1612, the \"Zemsky Sobor\" offered the Russian crown to several Rurikid and Gediminian princes, but all declined the honour.\nOn being offered the Russian crown, Filaret's 16-year-old son Mikhail Romanov, then living at the Ipatiev Monastery of Kostroma, burst into tears of fear and despair. He was finally persuaded to accept the throne by his mother Kseniya Ivanovna Shestova, who blessed him with the holy image of Our Lady of St. Theodore. Feeling how insecure his throne was, Mikhail attempted to emphasize his ties with the last Rurikid tsars and sought advice from the \"Zemsky Sobor\" on every important issue. This strategy proved successful. The early Romanovs were generally accepted by the population as in-laws of Ivan the Terrible and viewed as innocent martyrs of Godunov's wrath.\nDynastic crisis.\nMikhail was succeeded by his only son Alexei, who steered the country quietly through numerous troubles. Upon Alexei's death, there was a period of dynastic struggle between his children by his first wife Maria Ilyinichna Miloslavskaya (Feodor III, Sofia Alexeyevna, Ivan V) and his son by his second wife Nataliya Kyrillovna Naryshkina, the future Peter the Great. Peter ruled from 1682 until his death in 1725. In numerous successful wars he expanded the tsardom into a huge empire that became a major European power. He led a cultural revolution that replaced some of the traditionalist and medieval social and political system with a modern, scientific, Europe-oriented, and rationalist system.\nNew dynastic struggles followed the death of Peter. His only son to survive into adulthood, Tsarevich Alexei, did not support Peter's modernization of Russia. He had previously been arrested and died in prison shortly thereafter. Near the end of his life, Peter managed to alter the succession tradition of male heirs, allowing him to choose his heir. Power then passed into the hands of his second wife, Empress Catherine, who ruled until her death in 1727. Peter II, the son of Tsarevich Alexei, took the throne but died in 1730, ending the Romanov male line. He was succeeded by Anna I, daughter of Peter the Great's half-brother and co-ruler, Ivan V. Before she died in 1740 the empress declared that her grandnephew, Ivan VI, should succeed her. This was an attempt to secure the line of her father, while excluding descendants of Peter the Great from inheriting the throne. Ivan VI was only a one-year-old infant at the time of his succession to the throne, and his parents, Grand Duchess Anna Leopoldovna and Duke Anthony Ulrich of Brunswick, the ruling regent, were detested for their German counselors and relations. As a consequence, shortly after Empress Anna's death, Elizabeth Petrovna, a legitimized daughter of Peter I, managed to gain the favor of the populace and dethroned Ivan VI in a \"coup d'\u00e9tat\", supported by the Preobrazhensky Regiment and the ambassadors of France and Sweden. Ivan VI was murdered in 1764 while imprisoned, and his parents died from illness during their captivity.\nHolstein-Gottorp-Romanov.\nThe Holstein-Gottorps of Russia retained the Romanov surname, emphasizing their matrilineal descent from Peter the Great, through Anna Petrovna (Peter I's elder daughter by his second wife). In 1742, Empress Elizabeth of Russia brought Anna's son, her nephew Peter of Holstein-Gottorp, to St. Petersburg and proclaimed him her heir. In time, she married him off to a German princess, Sophia of Anhalt-Zerbst. In 1762, shortly after the death of Empress Elizabeth, Sophia, who had taken the Russian name Catherine upon her marriage, overthrew her unpopular husband, with the aid of her lover, Grigory Orlov. She reigned as Catherine the Great. Catherine's son, Paul I, who succeeded his mother in 1796, was particularly proud to be a great-grandson of Peter the Great, although his mother's memoirs arguably insinuate that Paul's natural father was, in fact, her lover Sergei Saltykov, rather than her husband, Peter. Painfully aware of the hazards resulting from battles of succession, Paul decreed house laws for the Romanovs \u2013 the so-called Pauline Laws, among the strictest in Europe \u2013 which established semi-Salic primogeniture as the rule of succession to the throne, requiring Orthodox faith for the monarch and dynasts, and for the consorts of the monarchs and their near heirs. Later, Alexander I, responding to the 1820 morganatic marriage of his brother and heir, added the requirement that consorts of all Russian dynasts in the male line had to be of equal birth (i.e., born to a royal or sovereign dynasty).\nAge of Autocracy.\nPaul I was murdered in his palace in Saint Petersburg in 1801. Alexander I, succeeded him on the throne and later died without leaving a son. His brother, crowned Nicholas I, succeeded him on the throne in 1825. The succession was far from smooth, however, as hundreds of troops took the oath of allegiance to Nicholas's elder brother, Constantine Pavlovich who, unbeknownst to them, had renounced his claim to the throne in 1822, following his marriage. The confusion, combined with opposition to Nicholas's accession, led to the Decembrist revolt. Nicholas I fathered four sons, educating them for the prospect of ruling Russia and for military careers, from whom the last branches of the dynasty descended.\nAlexander II, son of Nicholas I, became the next Russian emperor in 1855, in the midst of the Crimean War. While Alexander considered it his charge to maintain peace in Europe and Russia, he believed only a strong Russian military could keep the peace. By developing the Imperial Russian Army, giving increased autonomy to Finland, and freeing the serfs in 1861, he gained much popular support for his reign.\nDespite his popularity, however, his family life began to unravel by the mid-1860s. In 1864, his eldest son, and heir, Tsarevich Nicholas, died suddenly. His wife, Empress Maria Alexandrovna, who suffered from tuberculosis, spent much of her time abroad. Alexander eventually turned to a mistress, Princess Catherine Dolgorukova. Immediately following the death of his wife in 1880, he contracted a morganatic marriage with Dolgorukova. His legitimization of their children, and rumors that he was contemplating crowning his new wife as empress, caused tension within the dynasty. In particular, the grand duchesses were scandalized at the prospect of deferring to a woman who had borne Alexander several children during his wife's lifetime. Before Princess Catherine could be elevated in rank, however, on 13 March 1881 Alexander was assassinated by a hand-made bomb hurled by Ignacy Hryniewiecki. Slavic patriotism, cultural revival, and Panslavist ideas grew in importance in the latter half of this century, evoking expectations of a more Russian than cosmopolitan dynasty. Several marriages were contracted with members of other reigning Slavic or Orthodox dynasties (Greece, Montenegro, Serbia). In the early 20th century, two Romanov princesses were allowed to marry Russian high noblemen \u2013 whereas, until the 1850s, practically all marriages had been with German princelings.\nHis son Alexander III succeeded Alexander II. This tsar, the second-to-last Romanov emperor, was responsible for conservative reforms in Russia. Not expected to inherit the throne, he was educated in matters of state only after the death of his older brother, Nicholas. Lack of diplomatic training may have influenced his politics as well as those of his son, Nicholas II. Alexander III was physically impressive, being not only tall (1.93 m or 6'4\", according to some sources), but of large physique and considerable strength. His beard hearkened back to the likeness of tsars of old, contributing to an aura of brusque authority, awe-inspiring to some, alienating to others. Alexander, fearful of the fate which had befallen his father, strengthened autocratic rule in Russia. Some of the reforms the more liberal Alexander II had pushed through were reversed.\nAlexander had inherited not only his dead brother's position as \"Tsesarevich\", but also his brother's Danish fianc\u00e9e, Princess Dagmar. Taking the name Maria Feodorovna upon her conversion to Orthodoxy, she was the daughter of King Christian IX of Denmark and the sister of the future kings Frederik VIII and George I of Greece, as well as of Britain's Queen Alexandra, consort of Edward VII. Despite contrasting natures and backgrounds, the marriage was considered harmonious, producing six children and acquiring for Alexander the reputation of being the first tsar not known to take mistresses.\nHis eldest son, Nicholas, became emperor upon Alexander III's death due to kidney disease at age 49 in November 1894. Nicholas reputedly said, \"I am not ready to be tsar...\" Just a week after the funeral, Nicholas married his fianc\u00e9e, Alix of Hesse-Darmstadt, a favorite grandchild of Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom. Though a kind-hearted man, he tended to leave intact his father's harsh policies. For her part, the shy Alix, who took the name Alexandra Feodorovna, became a devout convert to Orthodoxy as well as a devoted wife to Nicholas and mother to their five children, yet avoided many of the social duties traditional for Russia's tsarinas. Seen as distant and severe, unfavorable comparisons were drawn between her and her popular mother-in-law, Maria Fyodorovna. When, in September 1915, Nicholas took command of the army at the front lines during World War I, Alexandra sought to influence him toward an authoritarian approach in government affairs even more than she had done during peacetime. His well-known devotion to her injured both his and the dynasty's reputation during World War I, due to both her German origin and her unique relationship with Rasputin, whose role in the life of her only son was not widely known. Alexandra was a carrier of the gene for haemophilia, inherited from her maternal grandmother, Queen Victoria. Her son, Alexei, the long-awaited heir to the throne, inherited the disease and suffered agonizing bouts of protracted bleeding, the pain of which was sometimes partially alleviated by Rasputin's ministrations. Nicholas and Alexandra also had four daughters: the Grand Duchesses Olga, Tatiana, Maria and Anastasia.\nThe six crowned representatives of the Holstein-Gottorp-Romanov line were: Paul (1796\u20131801), Alexander I (1801\u20131825), Nicholas I (1825\u20131855), Alexander II (1855\u20131881), Alexander III (1881\u20131894), and Nicholas II (1894\u20131917).\nConstantine Pavlovich and Michael Alexandrovich, both morganatically married, are occasionally counted among Russia's emperors by historians who observe that the Russian monarchy did not legally permit interregnums. Yet neither was crowned; Constantine renounced the throne before his brother's death, and Michael deferred his acceptance of the throne, effectively ending the monarchy.\nDownfall.\nThe February Revolution of 1917 resulted in the abdication of Nicholas II in favor of his brother Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovich. The latter declined to accept imperial authority save to delegate it to the Provisional Government pending a future democratic referendum, effectively terminating the Romanov dynasty's rule over Russia.\nAfter the February Revolution, Nicholas II and his family were placed under house arrest in the Alexander Palace. While several members of the imperial family managed to stay on good terms with the Provisional Government and were eventually able to leave Russia, Nicholas II and his family were sent into exile in the Siberian town of Tobolsk by Alexander Kerensky in August 1917. In the October Revolution of 1917 the Bolsheviks ousted the Provisional Government. In April 1918, the Romanovs were moved to the Russian town of Yekaterinburg, in the Urals, where they were placed in the Ipatiev House. Here, on the night of 16\u201318 July 1918, the entire Russian Imperial Romanov family, along with several of their retainers, were executed by Bolshevik revolutionaries, most likely on the orders of Vladimir Lenin.\nExecutions.\nLate on the night of 16 July, Nicholas, Alexandra, their five children and four servants were ordered to dress quickly and go down to the cellar of the house in which they were being held. There, the family and servants were arranged in two rows for a photograph they were told was being taken to quell rumors that they had escaped. Suddenly, a dozen armed men burst into the room and gunned down the imperial family in a hail of gunfire. Those who survived the shooting were stabbed to death.\nThe remains of Nicholas, Alexandra and three of their children were excavated in a forest near Yekaterinburg in 1991 and positively identified two years later using DNA analysis. The Crown Prince Alexei and one Romanov daughter were not accounted for, fueling the persistent legend that Anastasia, the youngest Romanov daughter, had survived the execution of her family. Of the several \"Anastasias\" that surfaced in Europe in the decade after the Russian Revolution, Anna Anderson, who died in the United States in 1984, was the most convincing. In 1994, however, scientists used DNA testing to prove that Anna Anderson was not the tsar's daughter but a Polish woman named Franziska Schanzkowska.\nInitially, gunmen shot at Nicholas who immediately fell dead as a result of multiple bullet wounds. Then the dark room where the family was held filled with smoke and dust from the spray of bullets. With limited visibility, the gunmen shot blindly, often hitting the ceiling and walls, creating more dust and debris. As a result of this many of the gunmen themselves were injured. Alexandra was soon shot in the head by military commissar Peter Ermakov and was killed. It was not until after the room had been cleared of smoke that the shooters re-entered to find the remaining imperial family still alive and uninjured. Maria attempted to escape through the doors at the rear of the room, leading to a storage area, but the doors were nailed shut. The noise produced as she rattled the doors attracted the attention of Ermakov. Some of the family were shot in the head, but several of the others, including the young and frail tsarevich, would not die either from multiple close-range bullet wounds or bayonet stabs. The gunmen then proceeded to shoot each family member once again. Even so, two of the daughters were still alive 10 minutes later, and were then bludgeoned to death with the butt of a rifle. Later it was discovered that the bullets and bayonet stabs had been partially blocked by diamonds sewn into the children's clothing.\nFollowing the murder of the Romanov family, the Bolsheviks made several attempts to dispose of the bodies. Initially the bodies were to be thrown down a mineshaft; however, the location of the disposal site was revealed to locals, causing them to change the location. Instead of a burial, the Bolsheviks decided to burn two of the corpses of the former royal family. Burning the corpses proved to be difficult as it took significant time, so the group resorted to disfiguring the pair with acid. In a rush, the Bolsheviks threw nine additional bodies into a grave and covered them with acid as well.\nThe bodies of the Romanovs were then hidden and moved several times before being interred in an unmarked pit where they remained until the summer of 1979 when amateur enthusiasts disinterred and re-buried some of them, and then decided to conceal the find until the fall of the USSR. In 1991 the grave site was excavated and the bodies were given a state funeral under the nascent democracy of post-Soviet Russia, and several years later DNA and other forensic evidence was used by Russian and international scientists to make accurate identifications.\nThe Ipatiev House has the same name as the Ipatiev Monastery in Kostroma, where Mikhail Romanov had been offered the Russian Crown in 1613. The large memorial church \"on the blood\" has been built on the spot where the Ipatiev House once stood.\nNicholas II and his family were proclaimed passion-bearers by the Russian Orthodox Church in 2000. In Orthodoxy, a passion-bearer is a saint who was not killed \"because\" of his faith, like a martyr; but who died \"in\" faith at the hand of murderers.\nRemains.\nIn the mid-1970s, Dr. Alexander Avdonin discovered the mass grave containing the remains of Nicholas II, Alexandra Feodorovna, and three of five Romanov children. The remains were found near Old Koptyaki road in Yekaterinburg, Russia. The grave contained 44 heavily degraded bone and tooth fragments. Avdonin released his discovery following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 prompting investigation by the Russian government.\nThe area where the remains were found was near the old Koptyaki Road, under what appeared to be double bonfire sites about 70 meters (230 ft) from the mass grave in Pigs Meadow near Yekaterinburg. The archaeologists stated that the bones were from a boy who approximately between the ages of 10 and 13 years at the time of his death and of a young woman who was between the ages of 18 and 23 years old. At the time, Anastasia was 17 years old while Maria was 19 years. Their brother Alexei was just a few weeks away from turning 14. Alexei's elder sisters Olga and Tatiana were 22 and 21 years old at the time of the murder respectively. The bones were found using metal detectors and metal rods as probes. Also, striped material was found that appeared to have been from a blue-and-white striped cloth; Alexei commonly wore a blue-and-white striped undershirt.\nIn mid-2007, a Russian archaeologist announced a discovery by one of his workers. The excavation uncovered the following items in the two pits which formed a \"T\":\nGeneticists used a combination of autosomal STR and mtDNA sequencing to detect relationships between the family members' remains. Using a DNA sample from Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, a grand nephew of Alexandra, scientists matched his DNA to her and her children's remains found in the mass grave. The investigation concluded that Alexei and one Romanov daughter were missing. Experts continue to debate which daughter was missing from the grave; those from the United States believe the missing child to be Anastasia, while those from Russia believe it to be Maria. However, \"conspiracy theories\" persisted throughout the 20th century, with some authors still contending that \"somehow the real Anastasia, Maria, or perhaps Aleksei, might have survived the Russian Revolution\" even after the discovery of the bodies and the confirmation of their identities was made public. Additionally, despite their discovery in 2007, the remains of the two bodies found in the separate grave did not \"receive a proper burial due to the Russian Orthodox Church's unsubstantiated doubts about their authenticity.\"\nAs for Nicholas II, scientists used mtDNA heteroplasmy using samples from Princess Xenia Cheremeteff Sfiri and the Duke of Fife. In the early 1990s, considerable controversy surrounded the accuracy of mtDNA heteroplasmy for DNA testing particularly for distant relatives. In an attempt to refine the results of the investigation, Russian authorities exhumed the remains of Nicholas II's brother, George Alexandrovich. George's remains matched the heteroplasmy of the remains found in the grave, indicating that they did in fact belong to Tsar Nicholas II.\nAfter the bodies were exhumed in June 1991, they remained in laboratories until 1998, while there was a debate as to whether they should be reburied in Yekaterinburg or St. Petersburg. A commission eventually chose St. Petersburg. The remains were transferred with full military honor guard and accompanied by members of the Romanov family from Yekaterinburg to St. Petersburg. In St. Petersburg remains of the imperial family were moved by a formal military honor guard cortege from the airport to St Petersburg's Saints Peter and Paul Cathedral where they (along with several loyal servants who were killed with them) were interred in a special chapel near the tombs of their ancestors. At the cathedral, the remaining Romanov family hosted a formal funeral for Tsar Nicholas II attended by many relatives and representatives from nations worldwide.\nOther executions.\nOn 18 July 1918, the day after the killing at Yekaterinburg of the tsar and his family, members of the extended Russian imperial family were killed near Alapayevsk by Bolsheviks. They included: Grand Duke Sergei Mikhailovich of Russia, Prince Ioann Konstantinovich of Russia, Prince Konstantin Konstantinovich of Russia, Prince Igor Konstantinovich of Russia and Prince Vladimir Pavlovich Paley, Grand Duke Sergei's secretary Varvara Yakovleva, and Grand Duchess Elisabeth Feodorovna, a granddaughter of Queen Victoria and elder sister of Tsarina Alexandra. Following the 1905 assassination of her husband, Grand Duke Sergei Alexandrovich, Elisabeth Feodorovna had ceased living as a member of the Imperial family and took up life as a serving nun, but was nonetheless arrested and slated for death with other Romanovs. They were thrown down a mine shaft into which explosives were then dropped, all being left to die there slowly.\nThe bodies were recovered from the mine by the White Army in 1918, who arrived too late to rescue them. Their remains were placed in coffins and moved around Russia during struggles between the White and the opposing Red Army. By 1920, the coffins were interred in a former Russian mission in Beijing, now beneath a parking area. In 1981 Grand Duchess Elisabeth was canonized by the Russian Orthodox Church Outside of Russia, and in 1992 by the Moscow Patriarchate. In 2006, representatives of the Romanov family were making plans to re-inter the remains elsewhere. The town became a place of pilgrimage to the memory of Elisabeth Fyodorovna, whose remains were eventually re-interred in Jerusalem.\nOn 13 June 1918, Bolshevik revolutionary authorities killed Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovich of Russia and Nicholas Johnson (Michael's secretary) in Perm. Their bodies have never been found.\nThe exiled Grand Duke Nicholas Konstantinovich of Russia died on 26 January 1918, with some rumors claiming he was killed by the Bolsheviks. His morganatic son Prince Artemy Nikolayevich Romanovsky-Iskander was killed the following year in the Russian Civil War.\nIn January 1919, revolutionary authorities killed Grand Dukes Dmitry Konstantinovich, Nikolai Mikhailovich, Paul Alexandrovich and George Mikhailovich, who had been held in the prison of the Saint Peter and Paul Fortress in Petrograd. The four Grand Dukes were buried in a mass grave in the fortress, though Dmitry Konstantinovich's body was collected by his former adjutant, rolled up in a rug and taken away for a private burial in the garden of a house in Petrograd, where he remains to this day.\nExiles.\nDowager Empress Maria Fyodorovna.\nIn 1919, Maria Feodorovna, widow of Alexander III, and mother of Nicholas II, managed to escape Russia aboard , which her nephew, King George V of the United Kingdom, had sent to rescue her, at the urging of his own mother, Queen Alexandra, who was Maria's elder sister. After a stay in England with Queen Alexandra, she returned to her native Denmark, first living at Amalienborg Palace, with her nephew, King Christian X, and later, at Villa Hvid\u00f8re. Upon her death in 1928, her coffin was placed in the crypt of Roskilde Cathedral, the burial site of members of the Danish royal family.\nIn 2005, the coffin with her remains was moved to the Peter and Paul Fortress to be buried beside that of her husband. The transfer of her remains was accompanied by an elaborate ceremony at Saint Isaac's Cathedral officiated by Patriarch Alexy II of Moscow. Descendants and relatives of the Dowager Empress attended, including her great-grandson Prince Michael Andreevich, :Princess Catherine Ivanovna of Russia, the last living member of the Imperial Family born before the fall of the dynasty, and Prince Dmitri and Prince Nicholas Romanov.\nOther exiles.\nAmong the other exiles who managed to leave Russia were Maria Feodorovna's two daughters, the Grand Duchesses Xenia Alexandrovna and Olga Alexandrovna, with their husbands, Grand Duke Alexander Mikhailovich and Nikolai Kulikovsky, respectively, and their children, as well as the spouses of Xenia's elder two children and her granddaughter. Xenia remained in England, following her mother's return to Denmark, although after their mother's death Olga moved to Canada with her husband, both sisters dying in 1960. Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna, widow of Nicholas II's uncle, Grand Duke Vladimir, and her children the Grand Dukes Kiril, Boris and Andrei, and Kiril's wife Victoria Melita and children, also managed to flee Russia. Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich, a cousin of Nicholas II, had been exiled to the Caucasus in 1916 for his part in the murder of Grigori Rasputin, and managed to escape Russia. Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolaievich, who was supreme commander of Russian troops during World War I prior to Nicholas II taking command, along with his brother, Grand Duke Peter, and their wives, Grand Duchesses Anastasia and Militza, who were sisters, and Peter's children, son-in-law, and granddaughter also fled the country.\nElizaveta Mavrikievna, widow of Konstantin Konstantinovich, escaped with her daughter Vera Konstantinovna and her son Georgii Konstantinovich, as well as her grandson Prince Vsevolod Ivanovich and her granddaughter Princess Catherine Ivanovna to Sweden. Her other daughter, Tatiana Konstantinovna, also escaped with her children Natasha and Teymuraz, as well as her uncle's aide-de-camp Alexander Korochenzov. They fled to Romania and then Switzerland. Gavriil Konstantinovich was imprisoned before fleeing to Paris.\nIoann Konstantinovich's wife, Elena Petrovna, was imprisoned in Alapayevsk and Perm, before escaping to Sweden and Nice, France.\nOlga Constantinovna of Russia, Dowager Queen of Greece, who had returned to Russia in her widowhood, was able to escape to Switzerland with the help of the Danish embassy. Her daughter Maria Georgievna, wife of George Mikhailovich, had been vacationing in England with her daughters Nina and Xenia when the war broke out and chose not to return to Russia.\nContemporary Romanovs.\nThere have been numerous post-Revolution reports of Romanov survivors and unsubstantiated claims by individuals to be members of the deposed Tsar Nicholas II's family, the best known of whom was Anna Anderson. Nonetheless, proven research has confirmed that all of the Romanovs held prisoners inside the Ipatiev House in Yekaterinburg were killed.\nGrand Duke Kirill Vladimirovich, a male-line grandson of Tsar Alexander II, claimed the headship of the deposed Imperial House of Russia, and assumed, as pretender, the title \"Emperor and Autocrat of all the Russias\" in 1924 when the evidence appeared conclusive that all Romanovs higher in the line of succession had been killed. Kirill was followed by his only son Vladimir Kirillovich, married to Princess Leonida Bagration of Mukhrani. Vladimir's only child is Maria Vladimirovna (born 1953), who had one child in her marriage with Prince Franz Wilhelm of Prussia, George Mikhailovich. Since 1991, the succession to the former Russian throne has been in dispute, largely due to disagreements over the validity of dynasts' marriages. When Vladimir Kirillovich died on 21 April 1992, his daughter Maria claimed to succeed him as head of the Russian Imperial Family on the grounds that she was the only child of the last male dynast of the Imperial house according to the Romanovs' Pauline laws, which granted succession rights only to the offspring born out of equal unions with other reigning or mediatised houses. Since then, her son George Mikhailovich has contracted a morganatic marriage with the Italian citizen Rebecca Bettarini, leaving him and his mother as the last remaining members of the Imperial House (according to their claims).\nOthers have argued in support of the rights of the late Prince Nicholas Romanov, whose brother Prince Dimitri Romanov was the next male heir of his branch after whom it was passed to Prince Andrew Romanov and then to his son Alexis Romanoff. All of them were born out of unequal marriages and are or were members of the Romanov Family Association formed in 1979, a private organization of most living male-line descendants of Emperor Paul I of Russia (other than Maria Vladimirovna and her son), which publicly acknowledges that dynastic claims of family members should not be advanced, and is officially committed to support whichever form of government is chosen by the Russian people.\nAlternatively, Prince Karl Emich of Leiningen (a great-nephew of Vladimir Kirillovich through his sister, Maria) has been a claimant to the defunct Russian throne since 2013. He and his supporters argue that the marriage of Maria Vladimirovna's parents was in contravention of the Pauline Laws. They maintain that the House of Bagration-Mukhrani did not possess sovereign status and was not recognized as equal by Nicholas II for the purpose of dynastic marriages at the time of the union of Princess Tatiana Constantinovna of Russia and Prince Constantine Bagration-Mukhransky in 1911, thirty seven years prior to that of Princess Leonida and Grand Duke Vladimir Kirillovich. Therefore, as the next of kin to Vladimir (in the exclusion of his daughter), the Russian Monarchist Party recognises Karl Emich as the heir to the Russian throne, since he and his wife converted on 1 June 2013, from Lutheranism to Eastern Orthodox Christianity, enabling his accession.\nBranches.\nMain article: Branches of the Russian Imperial Family\nThe Russian Imperial Family was split into four main branches named after the sons of Emperor Nicholas I:\nWealth and finances.\nThe Imperial House Laws of Russia set out the financial entitlements of members of the extended Imperial Family. A range of sources cite various figures for the income and lump-sum payments which the descendants of the Emperor were entitled to.\nThe 1912 edition of the \"Svod Zakonov\" (the Russian Empire\u2019s official Digest of Laws) reprints the revised Statute on the Imperial Family which was approved on 2/14 July 1886. This defines who qualified for titles and how support was structured. The Brockhaus &amp; Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary (1890s), a standard Russian reference work, summarizes the administrative stipend scales then in force for imperial children and grandchildren. These sources are examined in Mikhail Dolbilov\u2019s 2023 peer-reviewed study \"Managing the Ruling House: Royals, Bureaucrats, and the Emergence of the 1886 Statute on the Imperial Family of the Russian Empire\", which offers a detailed examination of the post-1886 financial provisions for the Imperial Family, with reference to the 1886 \"\u201cNorms of financing\u201d (RGIA)\" section. These sources provide the following data on the annuities and financial entitlements of the wider Romanov Family during the period from 1886 to 1917:\nFollowing the Russian Revolution, the reputed size of the deposed Emperor's personal fortune was subject to various rumours and estimates, many of which were likely exaggerated. As Emperor of All The Russias, and an autocrat, the resources under his command were virtually incalculable. However, the vast majority of this was owned by the state as crown property; the Romanov family's \"personal wealth\" was only a fraction of this. As monarch, the income of Nicholas was 24 million gold roubles per annum: this derived from a yearly allowance from the treasury, and from the profits of crown farmland. From this income, he had to fund staff, the upkeep of imperial palaces and imperial theatres, annuities for the royal family, pensions, bequests, and other outgoings; consequently \"before the end of the year, the Tsar was usually penniless; sometimes he reached this embarrassing state by autumn.\" According to the Grand Marshal of the Court, Count Paul Benckendorff, the family's total financial resources amounted to between 12.5 and 17.5 million roubles. As a comparison, Prince Felix Yusupov estimated his family's worth in real estate holdings alone as amounting to 50 million gold roubles.\nThe mystery and rumours surrounding the finances of the Romanov Dynasty during the early 20th century were addressed at length in the 1932 memoir of Nicholas II's brother-in-law (and first-cousin once-removed) Grand Duke Alexander Michailovich \"Once a Grand Duke\". Alexander Mikhailovich claimed that the income of the Russian Emperor prior to the First World War was derived from three main sources:\nAlexander Mikhailovich estimated that the aggregate annual income of the Russian Emperor prior to the First World War was $10\u2013$12 million in total. In addition to these sources of income, the 'frozen' assets of the Dynasty (which took the form of a hoard of jewels, gemstones etc) was worth an estimated $80 million in the early 20th century. From this annual income, the Emperor was required to maintain the costs of the Imperial Court, multiple residences, as well as the annual allowances which members of the Imperial Family were entitled to:\nOther sources suggest that the annuity paid to each Grand Duke was 280,000 roubles, whilst Grand Duchesses received an annuity of 50,000 roubles from birth, increased to 100,000 roubles in adulthood, and that a one-off 1,000,000 rouble payment was made to all Grand Duchesses \"and\" Grand Dukes when they married. Variations in the figures cited regarding the incomes of the Russian Imperial Family are likely further compounded due to fluctuations in the exchange rate of the Russian Rouble relative to other major currencies during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The approximate exchange rate during the late 19th century between the Rouble and the American Dollar and British Pound was \u20bd2:$1 and \u20bd10:\u00a31 in the late 19th century; during the period of 1914 - 1917 this had fallen \u20bd3:$1 and \u20bd15:\u00a31.\nGrand Duke Alexander Mikhailovich also claimed that the oft-cited private fortune of \u00a320,000,000 which the Tsars had invested in London Merchant Banks had been depleted during the First World War. This fortune, reportedly kept in London since the reign of Alexander II, \"had been entirely spent to support the hospitals and various other charities patronized by the imperial family during the war (1915 - 1917).\" Alexander Mikhailovich also asserted in his memoirs that in 1914 an \"overcareful Minister of the Imperial Court, acting against the orders of the Czar,\" had transferred the sums held from the annual allowances paid to Emperor Nicholas II's five children to Berlin, amounting to some 7,000,000 roubles; as a result, this part of the Romanov Family's wealth was lost as of result of the hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic which occurred during the early 1920's.\nRomanov family jewelry.\nMost of the treasures are in the diamond fund of Russia and are the most expensive exhibits in museums. The collection of jewels and jewelry collected by the Romanov family during their reign are commonly referred to as the \"Russian Crown Jewels\" and they include official state regalia as well as personal pieces of jewelry worn by Romanov rulers and their family. After the Tsar was deposed and his family murdered, their jewels and jewelry became the property of the new Soviet government. A select number of pieces from the collection were sold at auction by Christie's in London in March 1927. The remaining collection is on view today in the Kremlin Armoury in Moscow.\nOn 28 August 2009, a Swedish public news outlet reported that a collection of over 60 jewel-covered cigarette cases and cufflinks owned by Grand Duchess Vladimir had been found in the archives of the Swedish Ministry for Foreign Affairs, and was returned to the descendants of Grand Duchess Vladimir. The jewelry was allegedly turned over to the Swedish embassy in St. Petersburg in November 1918 by Duchess Marie of Mecklenburg-Schwerin to keep it safe. The value of the jewelry has been estimated at 20 million Swedish krona (about 2.6 million US dollars).\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He also wrote a relatively small amount of science fiction. His writing career lasted 60 years, including more than 30 years in television and film. He began his professional writing career immediately after graduation from high school, aged 17. He is best known as the writer of the novel \"Psycho\" (1959), the basis for the 1960 film \"Psycho\" directed by Alfred Hitchcock. Bloch wrote hundreds of short stories and over 30 novels. He was a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of H. P. Lovecraft, who was the first to seriously encourage his talent. However, while he started emulating Lovecraft and his brand of cosmic horror, he later specialized in crime and horror stories, often emphasizing psychological aspects of the characters within.\nBloch was a contributor to pulp magazines such as \"Weird Tales\" in his early career, and was also a prolific screenwriter and a major contributor to science fiction fanzines and fandom in general.\nHe won the Hugo Award (for his story \"That Hell-Bound Train\"), the Bram Stoker Award, and the World Fantasy Award. He served a term as president of the Mystery Writers of America (1970) and was a member of that organization and of Science Fiction Writers of America, the Writers Guild of America, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and the Count Dracula Society. In 2008, The Library of America selected Bloch's essay \"The Shambles of Ed Gein\" (1962) for inclusion in its two-century retrospective of American true crime.\nHis favorites among his own novels were \"The Kidnapper\", \"The Star Stalker\", \"Psycho\", \"Night-World,\" and \"Strange Eons\". His work has been extensively adapted into films, television productions, comics, and audiobooks.\nEarly life and education.\nBloch was born in Chicago, the son of Raphael \"Ray\" Bloch (1884\u20131952), a bank cashier, and his wife Stella Loeb (1880\u20131944), a social worker, both of German Jewish descent. Bloch's family moved to Maywood, a Chicago suburb, when he was five; he lived there until he was ten. He attended the Methodist Church there, despite his parents' Jewish heritage, and studied at Emerson Grammar School. In 1925, at eight years of age, living in Maywood, he attended (alone at night) a screening of Lon Chaney, Sr.'s film \"The Phantom of the Opera\" (1925). The scene of Chaney removing his mask terrified the young Bloch (\"it scared the living hell out of me and I ran all the way home to enjoy the first of about two years of recurrent nightmares\"). It also sparked his interest in horror. Bloch was a precocious child and found himself in fourth grade when he was eight. He also obtained a pass into the adult section of the public library, where he read omnivorously. Bloch considered himself a budding artist and worked in pencil sketching and watercolours, but myopia in adolescence seemed to effectively bar art as a career. He had passions for German-made lead toy soldiers and for silent cinema.\nIn 1929, Bloch's father Ray Bloch lost his bank job, and the family moved to Milwaukee, where Stella worked at the Milwaukee Jewish Settlement settlement house. Robert attended Washington, then Lincoln High School, where he met lifelong friend Harold Gauer. Gauer was editor of \"The Quill\", Lincoln's literary magazine, and accepted Bloch's first published short story, a horror story titled \"The Thing\" (the \"thing\" of the title was Death). Both Bloch and Gauer graduated from Lincoln in 1934 during the height of the Great Depression. Bloch was involved in the drama department at Lincoln and wrote and performed in school vaudeville skits.\nCareer.\n\"Weird Tales\" magazine and the influence of H. P. Lovecraft.\nDuring the 1930s, Bloch was an avid reader of the pulp magazine \"Weird Tales\", which he had discovered at the age of ten in 1927. In the Chicago Northwestern Railroad depot with his parents and aunt Lil, his aunt offered to buy him any magazine he wanted and he picked \"Weird Tales\" (Aug 1927 issue) off the newsstand over her shocked protest. He began his readings of the magazine with the first instalment of Otis Adelbert Kline's \"The Bride of Osiris\" which dealt with a secret Egyptian city called Karneter located beneath Bloch's birth city of Chicago. The Depression came in the early 1930s. He later recalled, in accepting the Lifetime Achievement Award at the First World Fantasy Convention (1975), how \"times were very hard. \"Weird Tales\" cost twenty-five cents in a day when most pulp magazines cost a dime. I remember that meant a lot to me.\" He went on to relate how he would get up very early on the last day of the month, with twenty-five cents saved from his monthly allowance of one dollar, and would run all the way to a combination tobacco/magazine store and buy the new \"Weird Tales\" issue, sometimes smuggling it home under his coat if the cover was particularly risqu\u00e9. His parents were not impressed with Hugh Doak Rankin's sexy covers for the magazine, and when the Bloch family moved to Milwaukee in 1928 young Bloch gradually abandoned his interest. But by the time he had entered high school, he returned to reading \"Weird Tales\" during convalescence from flu.\nH. P. Lovecraft, a frequent contributor to \"Weird Tales\", became one of his favorite writers. The first of Lovecraft's stories he had read was \"Pickman's Model\", in \"Weird Tales\" for October 1927. Bloch wrote: \"In school I was forced to squirm my way through the works of Oliver Wendell Holmes, James Lowell and Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. In 'Pickman's Model', the ghouls ate all three. Now that, I decided, was poetic justice.\" As a teenager, Bloch wrote a fan letter to Lovecraft (1933), asking where he could find copies of earlier stories of Lovecraft's that Bloch had missed. Lovecraft lent them to him. Lovecraft also gave Bloch advice on his early fiction-writing efforts, asking whether Bloch had written any weird work and, if so, whether he might see samples of it. Bloch took up Lovecraft's offer in late April 1933, sending him two short items, \"The Gallows\" and another work whose title is unknown.\nLovecraft also suggested Bloch write to other members of the Lovecraft Circle, including August Derleth, R. H. Barlow, Clark Ashton Smith, Donald Wandrei, Frank Belknap Long, Henry S. Whitehead, E. Hoffmann Price, Bernard Austin Dwyer and J. Vernon Shea. Bloch's first completed tales were \"Lilies\", \"The Laughter of a Young Ghoul\" and \"The Black Lotus\". Bloch submitted these to \"Weird Tales\"; editor Farnsworth Wright summarily rejected them all. However Bloch successfully placed \"Lilies\" in the semi-professional magazine \"Marvel Tales\" (Winter 1934) and \"Black Lotus\" in \"Unusual Stories\" (1935). Bloch later commented, \"I figured I'd better do something different or I'd end up as a florist.\"\nBloch graduated from high school in June 1934. He then wrote a story which promptly (six weeks later) sold to \"Weird Tales.\" Bloch's first publication in \"Weird Tales\" was a letter criticising the Conan stories of Robert E. Howard. His first professional sales, at the age of 17 (July 1934), to \"Weird Tales,\" were the short stories \"The Feast in the Abbey\" and \"The Secret in the Tomb\". \"Feast ...\" appeared first, in the January 1935 issue, which actually went on sale November 1, 1934; \"The Secret in the Tomb\" appeared in the May 1935 \"Weird Tales\".\nBloch's correspondence with Derleth led to a visit to Derleth's home in Sauk City, Wisconsin (the headquarters of Arkham House). Bloch was impressed by Derleth who \"fulfilled my expectations as a writer by wearing this purple velvet smoking jacket. That impressed me even more because Derleth didn't even smoke.\" Following this, and continued correspondence with Lovecraft, Bloch went to Chicago and met Farnsworth Wright, the then editor of \"Weird Tales\". He also met the first \"Weird Tales\" writer outside of Derleth he had encountered - Otto Binder.\nBloch's early stories were strongly influenced by Lovecraft. Indeed, a number of his stories were set in, and extended, the world of Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos. These include \"The Dark Demon\", in which the character Gordon is a figuration of Lovecraft, and which features Nyarlathotep; \"The Faceless God\" (features Nyarlathotep); \"The Grinning Ghoul\" (written after the manner of Lovecraft) and \"The Unspeakable Betrothal\" (vaguely attached to the Cthulhu Mythos). It was Bloch who invented, for example, the oft-cited Mythos texts \"De Vermis Mysteriis\" and \"Cultes des Goules\". Many other stories influenced by Lovecraft were later collected in Bloch's volume \"Mysteries of the Worm\" (now in its third, expanded edition). In 1935, Bloch wrote the tale \"Satan's Servants\", on which Lovecraft lent much advice, but none of the prose was by Lovecraft; this tale did not appear in print until 1949, in \"Something About Cats and Other Pieces\".\nThe young Bloch appears, thinly disguised, as the character Robert Blake in Lovecraft's story \"The Haunter of the Dark\" (1936), which is dedicated to Bloch. Bloch was the only individual to whom Lovecraft ever dedicated a story. In this story, Lovecraft kills off Robert Blake, the Bloch-based character, repaying a \"courtesy\" Bloch earlier paid Lovecraft with his 1935 tale \"The Shambler from the Stars\", in which the Lovecraft-inspired figure dies; the story goes so far as to use Bloch's then-current address (620 East Knapp Street) in Milwaukee. (Bloch even had a signed certificate from Lovecraft [and some of his creations] giving Bloch permission to kill Lovecraft off in a story.) Bloch later recalled \"believe me, beyond all doubt, I don't know anyone else I'd rather be killed by.\" Bloch later wrote a third tale, \"The Shadow From the Steeple\", picking up where \"The Haunter of the Dark\" finished (\"Weird Tales\" Sept 1950).\nLovecraft's death in 1937 deeply affected Bloch, who was then aged only 20. He recalled \"Part of me died with him, I guess, not only because he was not a god, he was mortal, that is true, but because he had so little recognition in his own lifetime. There were no novels or collections published, no great realization, even here in Providence, of what was lost.\" Elsewhere he wrote, \"the news of his fate came to me as a shattering blow; all the more so because the world at large ignored his passing. Only my parents and a few correspondents seemed to sense my shock, and my feeling that a part of me had died with him.\"\nAfter Lovecraft's death in 1937, Bloch continued writing for \"Weird Tales\", where he became one of its most popular authors. He also began contributing to other pulps, such as the science fiction magazine \"Amazing Stories\". Bloch broadened the scope of his fiction. His horror themes included voodoo (\"Mother of Serpents\"), the conte cruel (\"The Mandarin's Canaries\"), demonic possession (\"Fiddler's Fee\"), and black magic (\"Return to the Sabbat\"). Bloch visited Henry Kuttner in California in 1937. Bloch's first science fiction story, \"Secret of the Observatory\", was published in \"Amazing Stories\" (August 1938).\nMilwaukee Fictioneers and the Depression.\nIn 1935 Bloch joined a writers' group, The Milwaukee Fictioneers, members of which included Stanley Weinbaum, Ralph Milne Farley and Raymond A. Palmer. Another member of the group was Gustav Marx, who offered Bloch a job writing copy in his advertising firm, also allowing Bloch to write stories in his spare time in the office. Bloch was close friends with C. L. Moore and her husband Henry Kuttner, who visited him in Milwaukee.\nDuring the years of the Depression, Bloch appeared regularly in dramatic productions, writing and performing in his own sketches. Around 1936 he sold some gags to radio comedians Stoopnagle and Budd, and to Roy Atwell. Also in 1936, his tale \"The Grinning Ghoul\" was published in \"Weird Tales\" (June); \"The Opener of the Way\" appeared in \"Weird Tales\" (Oct); \"Mother of Serpents\" appeared in the December issue. The December issue also contained Lovecraft's tale \"The Haunter of the Dark\" in which he killed off young author \"Robert Blake\".\nIn 1937, following Lovecraft's death, \"The Mannikin\" appeared in \"Weird Tales\" for April. \"Weird Tales\" published \"Return to the Sabbath\" in July 1938. Bloch's first science fiction story, \"The Secret of the Observatory\" appeared in \"Amazing Stories\" (Aug 1938). In a profile accompanying this tale, Bloch described himself as \"tall, dark, unhandsome\" with \"all the charm and personality of a swamp adder\". He noted that \"I hate everything\", but reserved particular dislike for \"bean soup, red nail polish, house-cleaning, and optimists\".\nCampaign manager for Carl Zeidler.\nIn 1939, Bloch was contacted by James Doolittle, who was managing the campaign for Mayor of Milwaukee of a little-known assistant city attorney named Carl Zeidler. He was asked to work on Zeidler's speechwriting, advertising, and photo ops, in collaboration with his long-time friend Harold Gauer. They created elaborate campaign shows; in Bloch's 1993 autobiography, \"Once Around the Bloch\", he gives an inside account of the campaign, and the innovations he and Gauer came up with \u2013 for instance, the original releasing-balloons-from-the-ceiling schtick. He comments bitterly on how, after Zeidler's victory, they were ignored and not even paid their promised salaries. He ends the story with a wryly philosophical point:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;If Carl Zeidler had not asked Jim Doolittle to manage his campaign, Doolittle would never have contacted me about it. And the only reason Doolittle knew me to begin with was because he read my yarn (\"The Cloak\") in \"Unknown\". Rattling this chain of circumstances, one may stretch it a bit further. If I had not written a little vampire story called \"The Cloak\", Carl Zeidler might never have become mayor of Milwaukee.\nAlso in 1939, two of Bloch's tales were published: \"The Strange Flight of Richard Clayton\" (\"Amazing Stories,\" August) and \"The Cloak\" (\"Unknown,\" March). Many of the stories Bloch published in \"Strange Stories\" in 1939 as by 'Tarleton Fiske' were fantasy/horror hybrids of the \"contes cruels\" type.\n1940s and 1950s.\nIn October 1941, the tale \"A Good Knight's Work\" in \"Unknown Worlds\" first appeared. Shortly thereafter, Bloch created the Damon Runyon-esque humorous series character Lefty Feep in the story \"Time Wounds All Heels\" \"Fantastic Adventures\" (April 1942). This magazine, along with \"Weird Tales,\" published most of the over 100 stories Bloch wrote in the first decade of his career. Around the same time, he began work as an advertising copywriter at the Gustav Marx Advertising Agency, a position he held until 1953. Marx allowed Bloch to write stories in the office in quiet times. Bloch published a total of 23 Lefty Feep stories in \"Fantastic Adventures\", the last one published in 1950, but the bulk appeared during World War II. Feep's character name had actually been coined by Bloch's friend/collaborator Harold Gauer for their unpublished novel \"In the Land of Sky-Blue Ointments\", Bloch also worked for a time in local vaudeville and tried to break into writing for nationally-known performers.\nBloch gradually evolved away from Lovecraftian imitations towards a unique style of his own. One of the first distinctly \"Blochian\" stories was \"Yours Truly, Jack the Ripper\" (\"Weird Tales\", July 1943). The story was Bloch's take on the Jack the Ripper legend, and was filled out with more genuine factual details of the case than many other fictional treatments. It cast the Ripper as an eternal being who must make human sacrifices to extend his immortality. It was adapted for both radio (in \"Stay Tuned for Terror\") and television (as an episode of \"Thriller\" in 1961 adapted by Barr\u00e9 Lyndon). Bloch followed up this story with a number of others in a similar vein dealing with half-historic, half-legendary figures such as the Man in the Iron Mask (\"Iron Mask\", 1944), the Marquis de Sade (\"The Skull of the Marquis de Sade\", 1945) and Lizzie Borden (\"Lizzie Borden Took an Axe ...\", 1946).\nIn 1944, Laird Cregar performed Bloch's tale \"Yours Truly, Jack the Ripper\" over a coast-to-coast radio network.\nTowards the end of World War Two, in 1945, Bloch was asked to write 39 15-minute episodes of his own radio horror show called \"Stay Tuned for Terror\". Many of the programs were adaptations of his own pulp stories. (All episodes were broadcast, but recordings were thought to be lost. However, in 2020, two episodes, \"The Bogeyman Will Get You\" and \"Lizzie Borden Took an Axe\" were re-discovered amongst the archives of an old-time radio enthusiast. These episodes have now been posted on YouTube and Internet Archive).http://http://. The same year he published \"The Skull of the Marquis de Sade\" (\"Weird Tales,\" September issue). August Derleth's Arkham House, Lovecraft's publisher, published Bloch's first collection of short stories, \"The Opener of the Way\", in an edition of 2,000 copies, with jacket art by Ronald Clyne. At the same time, his best-known early tale, \"Yours Truly, Jack the Ripper\", received considerable attention through dramatization on radio and reprinting in anthologies. This story, as noted below, involving a Ripper who has found literal immortality through his crimes, has been widely imitated (or plagiarized); Bloch himself would return to the theme (see below). Stories published in 1946 include \"Enoch\" (September issue of \"Weird Tales\") and \"Lizzie Borden Took an Axe\" (\"Weird Tales\", November).\nBloch's first novel was published in hardcover \u2013 the thriller \"The Scarf\" (The Dial Press 1947; the Fawcett Gold medal paperback of 1966 features a revised text). It tells the story of a writer, Daniel Morley, who uses real women as models for his characters. But as soon as he is done writing the story, he is compelled to murder them, and always the same way: with the maroon scarf he has had since childhood. The story begins in Minneapolis and follows him and his trail of dead bodies to Chicago, New York City, and finally Hollywood, where his hit novel is going to be turned into a movie, and where his self-control may have reached its limit.\nIn 1948, Bloch was the Guest of Honor at Torcon I, World Science Fiction Convention, Toronto, Canada. In 1952 he published \"Lucy Comes to Stay\" (\"Weird Tales\", January issue). Bloch popularised the \"Auction Bloch\" at science fiction conventions during the 1950s, a practice in which fans bid on professionals, buying an hour of their time. Bloch would auction off an hour of some well-known writer's time at a convention to raise money for a worthy cause. (The time gave the winner an hour of personal interaction with the writer at the convention.) https://\nBloch published three novels in 1954 \u2013 \"Spiderweb\", \"The Kidnapper\" and \"The Will to Kill\" as he endeavored to support his family. That same year he was a weekly guest panelist on the TV quiz show \"It's a Draw\". \"Shooting Star\" (1958), a mainstream novel, was published in a double volume with a collection of Bloch's stories titled \"Terror in the Night\". \"This Crowded Earth\" (1958) was science fiction.\nWith the demise of \"Weird Tales\", Bloch continued to have his fiction published in \"Amazing\", \"Fantastic\", \"The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction\", and \"Fantastic Universe\"; he was a particularly frequent contributor to \"Imagination\" and \"Imaginative Tales\". His output of thrillers increased and he began to appear regularly in \"The Saint\", \"Ellery Queen\" and similar mystery magazines, and to such suspense and horror-fiction magazine projects as \"Shock\".\nJack the Ripper.\nBloch continued to revisit the Jack the Ripper theme. His contribution to Harlan Ellison's 1967 science fiction anthology \"Dangerous Visions\" was a story, \"A Toy for Juliette\", which evoked both Jack the Ripper and the Marquis de Sade in a time-travel story. The same anthology had Ellison's sequel to it titled \"The Prowler in the City at the Edge of the World\". His earlier idea of the Ripper as an immortal being resurfaced in Bloch's contribution to the original \"Star Trek\" series episode \"Wolf in the Fold\". His 1984 novel \"Night of the Ripper\" is set during the reign of Queen Victoria and follows the investigation of Inspector Frederick Abberline in attempting to apprehend the Ripper, and includes some famous Victorians such as Sir Arthur Conan Doyle within the storyline.\n\"Psycho\".\nBloch won the Hugo Award for Best Short Story for \"That Hellbound Train\" in 1959, the same year that his sixth novel, \"Psycho,\" was published. Bloch had written an earlier short story involving dissociative identity disorder, \"The Real Bad Friend\", which appeared in the February 1957 \"Mike Shayne Mystery Magazine\", that foreshadowed the 1959 novel \"Psycho\". However, \"Psycho\" also has thematic links to the story \"Lucy Comes to Stay\". Also in 1959, Bloch delivered a lecture titled \"Imagination and Modern Social Criticism\" at the University of Chicago; this was reprinted in the critical volume \"The Science Fiction Novel\" (Advent Publishers). His story \"The Hungry Eye\" appeared in \"Fantastic\" (May). This was also the year in which, despite having graduated from painting watercolours to oils, he gave up painting completely.\nNorman Bates, the main character in \"Psycho\", was very loosely based on two people. First was the real-life killer Ed Gein, about whom Bloch later wrote a fictionalized account, \"The Shambles of Ed Gein\". (The story can be found in \"Crimes and Punishments: The Lost Bloch, Volume 3\"). Second, it has been indicated by several people, including Noel Carter (wife of Lin Carter) and Chris Steinbrunner, as well as allegedly by Bloch himself, that Norman Bates was partly based on Calvin Beck, publisher of \"Castle of Frankenstein\". Bloch's basing of the character of Norman Bates on Ed Gein is discussed in the documentary \"Ed Gein: The Ghoul of Plainfield\", which can be found on Disc 2 of the DVD release of the remake of \"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre\" (2003). However, Bloch also commented that it was the situation itself \u2013 a mass murderer living undetected and unsuspected in a typical small town in middle America \u2013 rather than Gein himself who sparked Bloch's storyline. He writes: \"Thus the real-life murderer was not the role model for my character Norman Bates. Ed Gein didn't own or operate a motel. Ed Gein didn't kill anyone in the shower. Ed Gein wasn't into taxidermy. Ed Gein didn't stuff his mother, keep her body in the house, dress in a drag outfit, or adopt an alternative personality. These were the functions and characteristics of Norman Bates, and Norman Bates didn't exist until I made him up. Out of my own imagination, I add, which is probably the reason so few offer to take showers with me.\"\nThough Bloch had little involvement with the film version of his novel, which was directed by Alfred Hitchcock from an adapted screenplay by Joseph Stefano, he was to become most famous as its author. Bloch was awarded a special Mystery Writers of America scroll for the novel in 1961.\nThe novel is one of the first examples at full length of Bloch's use of modern urban horror relying on the horrors of interior psychology rather than the supernatural. \"By the mid-1940s, I had pretty well mined the vein of ordinary supernatural themes until it had become varicose,\" Bloch explained to Douglas E. Winter in an interview. \"I realized, as a result of what went on during World War II and of reading the more widely disseminated work in psychology, that the real horror is not in the shadows, but in that twisted little world inside our own skulls.\" While Bloch was not the first horror writer to utilise a psychological approach (it originates in the work of Edgar Allan Poe), Bloch's psychological approach in modern times was comparatively unique.\nBloch's agent, Harry Altshuler, received a \"blind bid\" for the novel \u2013 the buyer's name was not mentioned \u2013 of $7,500 for screen rights to the book. The bid eventually went to $9,500, which Bloch accepted. Bloch had never sold a book to Hollywood before. His contract with Simon &amp; Schuster included no bonus for a film sale. The publisher took 15 percent according to contract, while the agent took his 10%; Bloch wound up with about $6,750 before taxes. Despite the enormous profits generated by Hitchcock's film, Bloch received no further direct compensation.\nOnly Hitchcock's film was based on Bloch's novel. The later films in the \"Psycho\" series bear no relation to either of Bloch's sequel novels. Indeed, Bloch's proposed script for the film \"Psycho II\" was rejected by the studio (as were many other submissions), and it was this that he subsequently adapted for his own sequel novel.\nThe film \"Hitchcock\" (2012) tells the story of Alfred Hitchcock's making of the film version of \"Psycho\". Although it mentions Bloch and his novel, Bloch himself is not a character in the movie.\nThe early 1960s: Screenwriting and fiction.\nFollowing his move to Hollywood, around 1960, Bloch had multiple assignments from various television companies. However, he was not allowed to write for five months when the Writers Guild had a strike. After the strike was over, he became a frequent scriptwriter for television and film projects in the mystery, suspense, and horror genre. His first assignments were for the Macdonald Carey vehicle, \"Lock-Up\", (penning five episodes) as well as one for \"Whispering Smith\". Further TV work included an episode of \"Bus Stop\" (\"I Kiss Your Shadow\"), 10 episodes of \"Thriller\" (1960\u201362, several based on his own stories), and 10 episodes of \"Alfred Hitchcock Presents\" (1960\u201362). His short story collection \"Pleasant Dreams - Nightmares\" was published by Arkham House in 1960.\nBloch wrote the screenplay for \"The Cabinet of Caligari\" (1962), which is only very loosely related to the 1920 German silent film, and proved to be an unhappy experience. The same year, Bloch penned the story and teleplay \"The Sorcerer's Apprentice\" for \"Alfred Hitchcock Presents\". The episode was shelved when the NBC Television Network and sponsor Revlon called its ending \"too gruesome\" (by 1960s standards) for airing. Bloch was pleased later when the episode was included in the program's syndication package to affiliate stations, where not one complaint was registered. Today, due to public domain status, the episode is readily available in home media formats from numerous distributors and is even available on free video on demand.\nHis TV work did not slow Bloch's fictional output. In the early 1960s he published several novels, including \"The Dead Beat\" (1960), and \"Firebug\" (1961), for which Harlan Ellison, then an editor at Regency Books, contributed the first 1,200 words. In 1962 numerous works appeared in book form. Bloch's novel \"The Couch\" (1962) (the basis for the screenplay of his first movie, filmed the same year) was published. That year several Bloch short story collections \u2013 \"Atoms and Evil\", \"More Nightmares\" and \"Yours Truly, Jack the Ripper\" \u2013 were published, as well as another novel, \"Terror\" (whose working titles included \"Amok\" and \"Kill for Kali\"). Editor Earl Kemp assembled a selection of Bloch's prolific output for fan magazines as \"The Eight Stage of Fandom: Selections from 25 years of Fan Writing\" (Advent Publishers). In this era, Stephen King later wrote, \"What Bloch did with such novels as \"The Deadbeat\", \"The Scarf\", \"Firebug\", \"Psycho\", and \"The Couch\" was to re-discover the suspense novel and reinvent the antihero as first discovered by James Cain.\"\nDuring 1963, Bloch saw into print two further collections of short stories, \"Bogey men\" and \"Horror-7\". In 1964 Bloch married Eleanor Alexander and wrote original screenplays for two films produced and directed by William Castle, \"Strait-Jacket\" (1964) and \"The Night Walker\" (also 1964), along with \"The Skull\" (1965). The latter film was based on his short story \"The Skull of the Marquis de Sade\".\nThe 1960s and 1970s: Film &amp; TV writing.\nBloch's further TV writing in this period included \"The Alfred Hitchcock Hour\" (7 episodes, 1962\u20131965), \"I Spy\" (1 episode, 1966), \"Run for Your Life\" (1 episode, 1966), and \"The Girl from U.N.C.L.E.\" (1 episode, 1967). He penned three scripts for the original \"\" series which were screened in 1966 and 1967: \"What Are Little Girls Made Of?\", \"Wolf in the Fold\" (another Jack the Ripper variant), and \"\".\nIn 1968, Bloch returned to London to do two episodes for the English Hammer Films series \"Journey to the Unknown\" for Twentieth Century Fox. One of the episodes, \"The Indian Spirit Guide\", was included in the American TV movie \"Journey to Midnight\" (1968). The other episode was \"Girl of My Dreams\", co-scripted with Michael J. Bird and based on the eponymous story by Richard Matheson.\nFollowing the movie \"The Skull\" (1965), which was based on a Bloch story but scripted by Milton Subotsky, he wrote the screenplays for five feature films produced by Amicus Productions \u2013 \"The Psychopath\" (1966), \"The Deadly Bees\" (co-written with Anthony Marriott, 1967), \"Torture Garden\" (also 1967), \"The House That Dripped Blood\" (1971) and \"Asylum\" (1972). The last two films featured stories written by Bloch that were printed first in collections he published in the 1940s and early 1950s.\nDuring the 1970s, Bloch wrote two TV movies for director Curtis Harrington \u2013 \"The Cat Creature\" (1973) (an \"ABC Movie of the Week\") and \"The Dead Don't Die\". \"The Cat Creature\" was an unhappy production experience for Bloch. Producer Doug Cramer wanted to do an update of \"Cat People\" (1942), the Val Lewton-produced film. Bloch commented: \"Instead, I suggested a blending of the elements of several well-remembered films, and came up with a story line which dealt with the Egyptian cat-goddess (Bast), reincarnation and the first bypass operation ever performed on an artichoke heart.\" A detailed account of the troubled production of the film is described in Bloch's autobiography.\nBloch meanwhile (interspersed between his screenplays for Amicus Productions and other projects), penned single episodes for \"Night Gallery\" (1971), \"Ghost Story\" (1972), \"The Manhunter\" (1974), and \"Gemini Man\" (1976).\nThe later 1960s and 1970s: Fiction.\nIn 1965, two further collections of short stories appeared - \"The Skull of the Marquis de Sade\" and \"Tales in a Jugular Vein\". 1966 saw Bloch win the Ann Radcliffe Award for Television and publisher yet another collection of shorts - \"Chamber of Horrors\". Bloch returned to the site of his childhood home at 620 East Knapp St, Milwaukee (the address used by Lovecraft for the character Robert Blake in \"The Haunter of the Dark\") only to find the neighborhood razed and the entire neighborhood leveled and replaced by expressway approaches.\nIn 1967, another Bloch collection, \"The Living Demons\" was issued. He also published another classic story of Jack the Ripper, \"A Toy for Juliette\" in Harlan Ellison's \"Dangerous Visions\" anthology. In 1968 he published a duo of long sf novellas as \"Ladies' Day\" and \"This Crowded Earth\". His novel \"The Star Stalker\" was published, and \"Dragons and Nightmares\" (the first collection of Lefty Feep stories) appeared in hardcover (Mirage Press).\nThe collection \"Bloch and Bradbury\" (a collaboration with Ray Bradbury) and the hardcover novel \"The Todd Dossier\", originally as by Collier Young, were published in 1969.\nBloch won a second Ann Radcliffe Award, this time for Literature, in 1969. That same year, Bloch was invited to the Second International Film Festival in Rio de Janeiro, March 23\u201331, along with other science fiction writers from the United States, Britain and Europe.\nIn 1971, Bloch served as president of the Mystery Writers of America, meanwhile publishing the novel \"Sneak Preview\", the collection \"Fear Today, Gone Tomorrow,\" and the short novel \"It's All in Your Mind\". In 1972 he published another novel, \"Night-World\". In 1973 Bloch was the Guest of Honor at Torcon II, World Science Fiction Convention, Toronto. 1974 saw the publication of his novel \"American Gothic\", inspired by the true life story of serial killer H. H. Holmes.\nIn 1975, Bloch won the Lifetime Achievement Award at the First World Fantasy Convention held in Providence, Rhode Island. The award was a bust of H. P. Lovecraft. The occasion of this convention was the first time Bloch actually visited the city of Providence. An audio recording was made of Robert Bloch during that 1975 convention, accessible online.https://\nIn 1976, two records of Bloch recordings of his stories were released by Alternate World recordings \u2013 \"\"\"Gravely, Robert Bloch!\" and \"Blood! The Life and Times of Jack the Ripper! (with Harlan Ellison). In 1977, Lester del Rey edited \"The Best of Robert Bloch\" for Del Rey books. Two further short story collections appeared \u2013 \"Cold Chills\" and \"The King of Terrors.\"\nBloch continued to published short story collections throughout this period. His \"Selected Stories\" (reprinted in paperback with the incorrect title \"The Complete Stories\") appeared in three volumes just prior to his death, although many previously uncollected tales have appeared in volumes published since 1997 (see below). Bloch also contributed the story \"Heir Apparent\", set in Andre Norton's Witch World, to \"Tales of the Witch World\" (Vol. 1), NY: Tor, 1987.\n1979 saw the publication of Bloch's novel \"There is a Serpent in Eden\" (also reissued as \"The Cunning\"), and two more short story collections, \"Out of the Mouths of graves\" and \"Such Stuff as Screams Are Made Of.\"\nHis numerous novels of the 1970s demonstrate Bloch's thematic range, from science fiction \u2013 \"Sneak Preview\" (1971) \u2013 through horror novels such as the loving Lovecraftian tribute \"Strange Eons\" (Whispers Press, 1978) and the non-supernatural mystery \"There is a Serpent in Eden\" (1979).\nThe 1980s.\nBloch's screenplay-writing career continued active through the 1980s, with teleplays for \"Tales of the Unexpected\" (one episode, 1980), \"Darkroom\" (two episodes,1981), \"Alfred Hitchcock Presents\" (1 episode, 1986), \"Tales from the Darkside\" (three episodes, 1984\u201387: \"Beetles\", \"A Case of the Stubborns\" and \"Everybody Needs a Little Love\") and \"Monsters\" (three episodes, 1988\u20131989: \"The Legacy\", \"Mannikins of Horror\", and \"Reaper\"). No further screen work appeared in the last five years before his death, although an adaptation of his \"collaboration\" with Edgar Allan Poe, \"The Lighthouse\", was filmed as an episode of \"The Hunger\" in 1998.\n\"The First World Fantasy Convention: Three Authors Remember\" (Necronomicon Press, 1980) features reminiscences of that important event by Bloch, T.E.D. Klein and Fritz Leiber. In 1981, Zebra Books issued the first edition of the Cthulhu Mythos-themed collection \"Mysteries of the Worm\". This item was reprinted some years later in an expanded edition by Chaosium.\nBloch's sequel to the original \"Psycho\", \"Psycho II\", was published in 1982 and in 1983 he novelized \"\". His novel \"Night of the Ripper\" (1984), was another return to one of Bloch's favourite themes, the Jack the Ripper murders of 1888.\nIn 1986, Scream Press published the hardcover omnibus \"Unholy Trinity\", collecting three by now scarce Bloch novels, \"The Scarf\", \"The Dead Beat\", and \"The Couch.\" A second retrospective selection of Bloch's nonfiction was published by NESFA Press as \"Out of My Head.\"\nIn 1987, Bloch celebrated his 70th birthday. Underwood-Miller issued the three-volume hardcover set \"The Selected Stories of Robert Bloch\" (individual volumes titled \"Final Reckonings\", \"Bitter Ends\" and \"Last Rites\"). When Citadel Press reissued this in paperback they incorrectly named it \"The Collected Stories of Robert Bloch.\" The same year a collection, \"Midnight Pleasures\" appeared from Doubleday, and \"Lost in Time and Space with Lefty Feep\" (Creatures at Large Press) collected a number of the stories on the Lefty Feep series. The latter was the first of a projected series of three volumes, but the further volumes were never published. In 1988, Tor Books reissued Bloch's scarce second novel, \"The Kidnapper.\"\nIn 1989, several works were published: the collection \"Fear and Trembling\", the thriller novel \"Lori\" (later adapted as a standalone graphic novel) and another omnibus of long out-of-print early novels, \"Screams\" (containing \"The Will to Kill\", \"Firebug\", and \"The Star Stalker\"). Randall D. Larson issued \"The Robert Bloch Companion: Collected Interviews 1969-1986\" (Starmont House), together with \"Robert Bloch\" (Starmont Reader's Guide No 37), an exhaustive study of Bloch's work, and \"The Complete Robert Bloch: An Illustrated, Comprehensive Bibliography\" (Fandom Unlimited Enterprises). Larson's three books were bound in hardcover and distributed by Borgo Press.\nThe 1990s: Last works.\nBloch's novel, \"The Jekyll Legacy\" (1990), was a collaboration with Andre Norton and a sequel to Robert Louis Stevenson's \"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\". The same year he returned to the Norman Bates \"mythos\" with \"Psycho House\" (Tor), the third Psycho novel. As with the second novel in the sequence, it bears no relation to the film titled \"Psycho III\". It would prove to be his last published novel.\nIn February 1991, he was given the Honor of Master of Ceremonies at the first World Horror Convention held in Nashville, Tennessee. Weird Tales issued a special Robert Bloch issue in Spring, including his screenplay for the televised version of his tale \"Beetles\"\". A standalone chapbook of the story \"Yours Truly, Jack the Ripper\" was issued in both hardcover and paperback by Pulphouse, and Bloch co-edited with Martin H. Greenberg the original anthology \"Psycho-Paths\" (Tor). In 1991 Bloch contributed an Introduction to \"In Search of Lovecraft\" by J. Vernon Shea.\nIn 1992, Bloch celebrated his 75th birthday with a bash at a Los Angeles mystery/horror bookstore which was attended by many sf/horror notables. In 1993, he published his \"unauthorized autobiography\", \"Once Around the Bloch\" (Tor) and edited the original anthology \"Monsters in Our Midst\".\nIn early 1994, Fedogan and Bremer published a collection of 39 of his stories, \"The Early Fears\". Bloch began editing a new original anthology, \"Robert Bloch's Psychos\" but was unable to complete work on it prior to his death; Martin H. Greenberg finished the work posthumously and the book appeared several years later (1997).\nPersonal life.\nOn October 2, 1940, Bloch married Marion Ruth Holcombe; it was reportedly a marriage of convenience designed to keep Bloch out of the army. During their marriage, she suffered (initially undiagnosed) from tuberculosis of the bone, which affected her ability to walk.\nAfter working for 11 years for the Gustav Marx Advertising Agency in Milwaukee, Bloch left in 1953 and moved to Weyauwega, Marion's home town, so she could be close to friends and family. Although she was eventually cured of tuberculosis, she and Bloch divorced in 1963. Bloch's daughter Sally (born 1943) elected to stay with him.\nOn January 18, 1964, Bloch met recently widowed Eleanor (\"Elly\") Alexander (n\u00e9e Zalisko), who had lost her first husband, writer/producer John Alexander, to a heart attack three months earlier, and married her in a civil ceremony on the following October 16. Elly was a fashion model and cosmetician. They honeymooned in Tahiti, and in 1965 visited London, then British Columbia. They remained happily married until Bloch's death. Elly remained in the Los Angeles area for several years after selling their Laurel Canyon Home to fans of Bloch, eventually choosing to go home to Canada to be closer to her own family. She died March 7, 2007, at the Betel Home in Selkirk, Manitoba, Canada. Her ashes have been placed next to Bloch's in a similar book-shaped urn at Pierce Brothers in Westwood, California.\nBloch died on September 23, 1994 from cancer aged 77. He survived by seven months the death of another member of the original \"Lovecraft Circle\", Frank Belknap Long, who had died in January 1994.\nBloch was cremated and his ashes interred in the Room of Prayer columbarium at Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery in Los Angeles. His wife Elly is also interred there.\nThe Robert Bloch Award is presented at the annual NecronomiCon convention. Its recipient in 2013 was editor and scholar S.T. Joshi. The award is in the shape of the Shining Trapezohedron as described in H. P. Lovecraft's tale dedicated to Bloch, \"The Haunter of the Dark\".\nComic adaptations.\nA number of Bloch's works have been adapted in graphic form for comics. These include:\nThe comic \"Aardwolf\" (No 2, Feb 1995) is a special tribute issue to Bloch. It contains brief tributes to Bloch from Harlan Ellison, Ray Bradbury, Richard Matheson, Julius Schwartz and Peter Straub incorporated within a piece called \"Robert Bloch: A Retrospective\" compiled by Clifford Lawrence. The first part of the text of Bloch's story \"The Past Master\" is also reprinted in this issue.\nBloch also contributed a script as part of the DC one-shot benefit comic \"Heroes Against Hunger\".\nThe character Inspector Bloch in the Italian comic \"Dylan Dog\" is partly inspired by Robert Bloch.\nAudio adaptations.\nA number of Bloch's works have been adapted for audio productions.\nOther adaptations include:\nVarious recordings of Bloch speaking at fantasy and sf conventions are also extant.

{"id": "26244", "revid": "31876559", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26244", "title": "Recorder (musical instrument)", "text": "Woodwind instrument\nThe recorder is a family of woodwind musical instruments and a member of the family of duct flutes that includes tin whistles and flageolets. It is the most prominent duct flute in the western classical tradition. A recorder can be distinguished from other duct flutes by the presence of a thumb-hole for the upper hand and holes for seven fingers: three for the upper hand and four for the lower. \nRecorders are made in various sizes and ranges. The sizes most commonly in use today are the soprano (also known as descant, lowest note C5), alto (also known as treble, lowest note F4), tenor (lowest note C4), and bass (lowest note F3). Recorders were traditionally constructed from wood or ivory. Modern professional instruments are wooden, often boxwood; student and scholastic recorders are commonly made of moulded plastic. The recorders' internal and external proportions vary, but the bore is generally reverse conical (i.e. tapering towards the foot) to cylindrical, and all recorder fingering systems make extensive use of forked fingerings.\nThe recorder is first documented in Europe in the Middle Ages, and continued to enjoy wide popularity in the Renaissance and Baroque periods, but was little used in the Classical and Romantic periods. It was revived in the twentieth century as part of the historically informed performance movement, and became a popular amateur and educational instrument. Composers who have written for the recorder include Monteverdi, Lully, Purcell, Handel, Vivaldi, Telemann, Bach, Hindemith, and Berio. There are many professional recorder players who demonstrate the full solo range of the instrument, and a large community of amateurs.\nThe sound of the recorder is often described as clear and sweet, and has historically been associated with birds and shepherds. It is notable for its quick response and its corresponding ability to produce a wide variety of articulations. This ability, coupled with its open finger holes, allow it to produce a wide variety of tone colours and special effects. Acoustically, its tone is relatively pure and, when the edge is positioned in the center of the airjet, odd harmonics predominate in its sound (when the edge is decidedly off-center, an even distribution of harmonics occurs).\nName.\nThe instrument has been known by its modern English name since the fourteenth century. David Lasocki reports the earliest use of \"recorder\" in the household accounts of the Earl of Derby (later King Henry IV) in 1388, which register (1. a pipe called a 'Recordour').\nBy the fifteenth century, the name had appeared in English literature. The earliest references are in John Lydgate's Temple of Glas (c.\u00a01430): \"These lytylle herdegromys Floutyn al the longe day..In here smale recorderys, In floutys.\" ('These little shepherds fluting all day long ... on these small recorders, on flutes.') and in Lydgate's Fall of Princes (c. 1431\u20131438): \"Pan, god off Kynde, with his pipes seuene, / Off recorderis fond first the melodies.\" ('Pan, god of Nature, with his pipes seven, / of recorders found first the melodies.')\nEtymology.\nAppending the name \"recorder\" to the instrument itself is uniquely English: In Middle-French there is no equivalent noun sense of referring to a musical instrument. The English verb \"record\" (from Middle-French , early thirteenth century) meant \"to learn by heart, to commit to memory, to go over in one's mind, to recite\"; but the term did not refer to \"playing music\" until the sixteenth century. It was long after the English recorder was so-named that it gained two additional meanings: \"silently practicing a tune\", or \"sing or render in song\"\u2014both referring almost-exclusively to songbirds.\nPartridge indicates that the use of the instrument by led to its association with the verb: the minstrel's action, a \"recorder\" the minstrel's tool. The reason is uncertain why this flute instrument\u2014rather than some other instrument played by the \u2014is known as the recorder.\n\"Flute\" and \"recorder\".\nThe introduction of the Baroque recorder to England by a group of French professionals in 1673 popularised the French name for the instrument, , or simply , a name previously (and subsequently) reserved for the transverse instrument. Until about 1695, the names \"recorder\" and \"flute\" overlapped, but from 1673 to the late 1720s in England, the word \"flute\" always meant recorder. In the 1720s, as the transverse flute overtook the recorder in popularity, English adopted the convention already present in other European languages of qualifying the word \"flute\", calling the recorder variously the \"common flute\", \"common English-flute\", or simply \"English flute\" while the transverse instrument was distinguished as the \"German flute\" or simply \"flute\". Until at least 1765, some writers still used \"flute\" to mean recorder.\nOther languages.\nUntil the mid-eighteenth century, musical scores written in Italian refer to the instrument as , whereas the transverse instrument was called . This distinction, like the English switch from \"recorder\" to \"flute\", has caused confusion among modern editors, writers and performers.\nIndeed, in most European languages, the first term for the recorder was the word for flute alone. In the present day, cognates of the word \"flute\", when used without qualifiers, remain ambiguous and may refer to either the recorder, the modern concert flute, or other non-western flutes. Starting in the 1530s, these languages began to add qualifiers to specify this particular flute.\nNomenclature.\nSince the fifteenth century, a variety of sizes of recorder have been documented, but a consistent terminology and notation for the different sizes was not formulated until the twentieth century.\nModern recorders.\nToday, recorder sizes are named after the different vocal ranges. This is not, however, a reflection of sounding pitch, and serves primarily to denote the pitch relationships between the different instruments. Groups of recorders played together are referred to as \"consorts\". Recorders are also often referred to by their lowest sounding note: \"recorder in F\" refers to a recorder with lowest note F, in any octave.\nThe table in this section shows the standard names of modern recorders in F and C and their respective ranges. Music composed after the modern revival of the recorder most frequently uses soprano, alto, tenor, and bass recorders, although sopranino and great bass are also fairly common. Consorts of recorders are often referred to using the terminology of organ registers: 8\u2032 (8 foot) pitch referring to a consort sounding as written, 4\u2032 pitch a consort sounding an octave above written, and 16\u2032 a consort sounding an octave below written. The combination of these consorts is also possible.\nAs a rule of thumb, the tessitura of a baroque recorder lies approximately one octave above the tessitura of the human voice type after which it is named. For example, the tessitura of a soprano voice is roughly C4\u2013C6, while the tessitura of a soprano recorder is C5\u2013C7.\nModern variations include standard British terminology, due to Arnold Dolmetsch, which refers to the recorder in C5 (soprano) as the descant and the recorder in F4 (alto) as the treble. As conventions and instruments vary, especially for larger and more uncommon instruments, it is often practical to state the recorder's lowest note along with its name to avoid confusion.\nNotation.\nModern recorder parts are notated in the key they sound in. Parts for alto, tenor and contrabass recorders are notated at pitch, while parts for sopranino, soprano, bass, and great bass are typically notated an octave below their sounding pitch. As a result, soprano and tenor recorders are notated identically; alto and sopranino are notated identically; and bass and contrabass recorders are notated identically. Octave clefs may be used to indicate the sounding pitch, but usage is inconsistent.\nRare sizes and notations include the garklein flutlein, which may be notated two octaves below its sounding pitch, and the sub-contrabass, which may be notated an octave above its sounding pitch.\nHistorical recorders.\nThe earliest known document mentioning \"a pipe called Recordour\" dates from 1388.\nHistorically, recorders were used to play vocal music and parts written for other instruments, or for a general instrument. As a result, it was frequently the performers' responsibility to read parts not specifically intended for the instrument and to choose appropriate instruments. When such consorts consisted only of recorders, the pitch relationships between the parts were typically preserved, but when recorders were combined with other instruments, octave discrepancies were often ignored.\nRecorder consorts in the sixteenth century were tuned in fifths and only occasionally employed tuning by octaves as seen in the modern C, F recorder consort. This means that consorts could be composed of instruments nominally in B\u266d, F, C, G, D, A and even E, although typically only three or four distinct sizes were used simultaneously. To use modern terminology, these recorders were treated as transposing instruments: consorts would be read identically to a consort made up of F3, C4, and G4 instruments. This is made possible by the fact that adjacent sizes are separated by fifths, with few exceptions. These parts would be written using \"chiavi naturali\", allowing the parts to roughly fit in the range of a single staff, and also in the range of the recorders of the period. (see Renaissance structure)\nTranspositions (\"registers\"), such as C3\u2013G3\u2013D4, G3\u2013D4\u2013A4, or B\u266d2\u2013F3\u2013C4, all read as F3\u2013C4\u2013G4 instruments, were possible as described by Praetorius in his \"Syntagma Musicum\". Three sizes of instruments could be used to play four-part music by doubling the middle size, e.g. F3\u2013C4\u2013C4\u2013G4, or play six-part music by doubling the upper size and tripling the middle size, e.g. F3\u2013C4\u2013C4\u2013C4\u2013G4\u2013G4. Modern nomenclature for such recorders refers to the instruments' relationship to the other members of consort, rather than their absolute pitch, which may vary. The instruments from lowest to highest are called \"great bass\", \"bass\", \"basset\", \"tenor\", \"alto\", and \"soprano\". Potential sizes include: great bass in F2; bass in B\u266d2 or C3; basset in F3 or G3; tenor in B\u266d3, C4 or D4; alto in F4, G4 or A4; and soprano in C5 or D5.\nThe alto in F4 is the standard recorder of the Baroque, although there is a small repertoire written for other sizes. In seventeenth-century England, smaller recorders were named for their relationship to the alto and notated as transposing instruments with respect to it: third flute (A4), fifth flute (soprano; C5), sixth flute (D5), and octave flute (sopranino; F5). The term \"flute du quart\", or fourth flute (B\u266d4), was used by Charles Dieupart, although curiously he treated it as a transposing instrument in relation to the soprano rather than the alto. In Germanic countries, the equivalent of the same term, \"Quartfl\u00f6te\", was applied both to the tenor in C4, the interval being measured down from the alto in F4, and to a recorder in C5 (soprano), the interval of a fourth apparently being measured up from an alto in G4. Recorder parts in the Baroque were typically notated using the treble clef, although they may also be notated in French violin clef (G clef on the bottom line of the staff).\nIn modern usage, recorders not in C or F are alternatively referred to using the name of the closest instrument in C or F, followed by the lowest note. For example, a recorder with lowest note G4 may be known as a G-alto or alto in G, a recorder with lowest note D5 (also \"sixth flute\") as a D-soprano or soprano in D, and a recorder in G3 as a G-bass or G-basset. This usage is not totally consistent. Notably, the baroque recorder in D4 is not commonly referred to as a D-tenor nor a D-alto; it is most commonly referred to using the historical name \"voice flute\".\nStructure.\nMaterials.\nRecorders have historically been constructed from hardwoods and ivory, sometimes with metal tone keys. Since the modern revival of the recorder, plastics have been used in the mass manufacture of recorders, as well as by a few individual makers.\nToday, a wide variety of hardwoods are used to make recorder bodies. Relatively fewer varieties of wood are used to make recorder blocks, which are often made of red cedar, chosen because of its rot resistance, ability to absorb water, and low expansion when wet. A recent innovation is the use of synthetic ceramics in the manufacture of recorder blocks. Instruments fitted with this device were marketed by Moeck in the 1970s.\nLarger recorders.\nSome recorders have tone holes too far apart for a player's hands to reach, or too large to cover with the pads of the fingers. In either case, more ergonomically placed keys can be used to cover the tone holes. Keys also allow the design of longer instruments with larger tone holes. Keys are most common in recorders larger than the alto. Instruments larger than the tenor need at least one key so the player can cover all eight holes. Keys are sometimes also used on smaller recorders to allow for comfortable hand stretch, and acoustically improved hole placement and size.\nWhen playing a larger recorder, a player may not be able to simultaneously reach the keys or tone holes with the fingers and reach the windway with the mouth. In this case, a bocal may be used to allow the player to blow into the recorder while maintaining a comfortable hand position. Alternatively, some recorders have a bent bore that positions the windway closer to the keys or finger holes so the player can comfortably reach both. Instruments with a single bend are known as \"knick\" or bent-neck recorders.\nModern developments.\nSome newer designs of recorder are now being produced. Recorders with a square cross-section may be produced more cheaply and in larger sizes than comparable recorders manufactured by turning. Another area is the development of instruments with a greater dynamic range and more powerful bottom notes. These modern designs make it easier to be heard in concertos. Finally, recorders with a downward extension of a semitone are becoming available; such instruments can play a full three octaves in tune.\nGerman fingering.\nIn the early twentieth century, Peter Harlan developed a recorder with apparently simpler fingering, called German fingering. A recorder designed for German fingering has a hole five that is smaller than hole four, whereas baroque and neo-baroque recorders have a hole four that is smaller than hole five. The immediate difference in fingering is for F (soprano) or B\u266d (alto), which on a neo-baroque instrument must be fingered 0 123 4\u201367. With German fingering, this becomes a simpler 0 123 4 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013. Unfortunately, however, this makes many other chromatic notes too out of tune to be usable. German fingering became popular in Europe, especially Germany, in the 1930s, but rapidly became obsolete in the 1950s as people began to treat the recorder more seriously, and the limitations of German fingering became more widely appreciated. Recorders with German fingering are today manufactured exclusively for educational purposes.\nPitch.\nModern recorders are most commonly pitched at A=440\u00a0Hz, but among serious amateurs and professionals, other pitch standards are often found. For the performance of baroque music, A=415\u00a0Hz is the \"de facto\" standard, while pre-Baroque music is often performed at A=440\u00a0Hz or A=466\u00a0Hz. These pitch standards are intended to reflect the broad variation in pitch standards throughout the history of the recorder. In various regions, contexts, and time periods, pitch standards have varied from A=~392\u00a0Hz to A=~520\u00a0Hz. The pitches A=415\u00a0Hz and A=466\u00a0Hz, a semitone lower and a semitone higher than A=440\u00a0Hz respectively, were chosen because they may be used with harpsichords or chamber organs that transpose up or down a semitone from A=440. These pitch standards allow recorder players to collaborate with other instrumentalists at a pitch other than A=440\u00a0Hz.\nSome recorder makers produce instruments at pitches other than the three standard pitches above, and recorders with interchangeable bodies at different pitches.\nAcoustics.\nBasic sound production.\nThe recorder produces sound in the manner of a whistle or an organ flue pipe. In normal play, the player blows into the \"windway\" (B), a narrow channel in the \"head joint\", which directs a stream of air across a gap called the \"window\", at a sharp edge called the \"labium\" (C). The air stream alternately travels above and below the labium, exciting standing waves in the bore of the recorder, and producing sound waves that emanate away from the window. Feedback from the resonance of the tube regulates the pitch of the sound.\nIn recorders, as in all woodwind instruments, the air column inside the instrument behaves like a vibrating string, to use a musical analogy, and has multiple modes of vibration. These waves produced inside the instrument are not travelling waves, like those the ear perceives as sound, but rather stationary standing waves consisting of areas of high pressure and low pressure inside the tube, called nodes. The perceived pitch is the lowest, and typically loudest, mode of vibration in the air column. The other pitches are \"harmonics\", or \"overtones\". Players typically describe recorder pitches by the number of nodes in the air column. Notes with a single node are in the \"first register,\" notes with two nodes in the \"second register,\" etc. As the number of nodes in the tube increases, the number of notes a player can produce in a given register decreases because of the physical constraint of the spacing of the nodes in the bore. On a Baroque recorder, the first, second, and third registers span about a major ninth, a major sixth, and a minor third respectively.\nHarmonic profile.\nThe recorder sound, for the most part, lacks high harmonics and odd harmonics predominate in its sound with the even harmonics being almost entirely absent, although the harmonic profile of the recorder sound varies from recorder to recorder, and from fingering to fingering. As a result of the lack of high harmonics, writers since Praetorius have remarked that it is difficult for the human ear to perceive correctly the sounding octave of the recorder.\nAir.\nAs in organ flue pipes, the sounding pitch of duct type whistles is affected by the velocity of the air stream as it impinges upon the labium. The pitch generally increases with velocity of the airstream, up to a point.\nAir speed can also be used to influence the number of pressure nodes in a process called over blowing. At higher airstream velocities, lower modes of vibration of the air column become unstable, resulting in a change of register.\nThe air stream is affected by the shaping of the surfaces in the head of the recorder (the \"voicing\"), and the way the player blows air into the windway. Recorder voicing is determined by physical parameters such as the proportions and curvature of the windway along both the longitudinal and latitudinal axes, the bevelled edges (\"chamfers\") of the windway facing towards the labium, the length of the window, the sharpness of the labium (i.e. the steepness of the ramp) among other parameters. The player is able to control the speed and turbulence of the airstream using the diaphragm and vocal tract.\nFingers.\nThe finger holes, used in combination or partially covered, affect the sounding pitch of the instrument.\nAt the most basic level, the sequential uncovering of finger holes increases the sounding pitch of the instrument by decreasing the effective sounding length of the instrument, and vice versa for the sequential covering of holes. In the fingering 01234567, only the bell of the instrument is open, resulting in a low pressure node at the bell end of the instrument. The fingering 0123456 sounds at a higher pitch because the seventh hole and the bell both release air, creating a low pressure node at the seventh hole.\nBesides sequential uncovering, recorders can use forked fingering to produce tones other than those produced by simple sequential lifting of fingers. In the fingering 0123, air leaks from the open holes 4,5,6, and 7. The pressure inside the bore is higher at the fourth hole than at the fifth, and decreases further at the 6th and 7th holes. Consequently, the most air leaks from the fourth hole and the least air leaks from the seventh hole. As a result, covering the fourth hole affects the pitch more than covering any of the holes below it. Thus, at the same air pressure, the fingering 01235 produces a pitch between 0123 and 01234. Forked fingerings allow recorder players to obtain fine gradations in pitch and timbre.\nA recorder's pitch is also affected by the partial covering of holes. This technique is an important tool for intonation, and is related to the fixed process of tuning a recorder, which involves the adjustment of the size and shape of the finger holes through carving and the application of wax.\nOne essential use of partial covering is in \"leaking\", or partially covering, the thumb hole to destabilise low harmonics. This allows higher harmonics to sound at lower air pressures than by over-blowing alone, as on simple whistles. The player may also leak other holes to destabilise lower harmonics in place of the thumb hole (hole 0). This technique is demonstrated in the fingering tables of Ganassi's \"Fontegara\" (1535), which illustrate the simultaneous leaking of holes 0, 2, and 5 to produce some high notes. For example, Ganassi's table produces the 15th (third octave tonic) as the fourth harmonic of the tonic, leaking holes 0, 2 and 5 and produces the 16th as the third harmonic of the fifth, leaking holes 0 and 2. On some Baroque recorders, the 17th can be produced as the third harmonic of the sixth, leaking hole 0 as well as hole 1, 2 or both.\nTechnique.\nAlthough the design of the recorder has changed over its 700-year history, notably in fingering and bore profile (see History), the technique of playing recorders of different sizes and periods is much the same. Indeed, much of what is known about the technique of playing the recorder is derived from historical treatises and manuals dating from the sixteenth to eighteenth centuries. The following describes the commonalities of recorder technique across all time periods.\nPlaying position.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Stack/styles.css\"/&gt;\nIn normal playing position, the recorder is held with both hands, covering the finger holes or depressing the keys with the pads of the fingers: four fingers on the lower hand; and the index, middle, and ring fingers and thumb on the upper hand. In standard modern practice, the right hand is the lower hand, while the left hand is the upper hand, although this was not standardized before the modern revival of the recorder.\nThe recorder is supported by the lips, which loosely seal around the beak of the instrument, the thumb of the lower hand, and, depending on the note fingered, by the other fingers and the upper thumb. A practice documented in many historical fingering charts is the use of finger seven or eight to support the recorder when playing notes for which the coverage of this hole negligibly affects the sounding pitch (e.g., notes with many holes uncovered). Larger recorders may have a thumb rest, or a neck strap for extra support, and can use a bocal to direct air from the player's mouth to the windway.\nRecorders are typically held at an angle between vertical and horizontal, the attitude depending on the size and weight of the recorder, and personal preference.\nFingers.\nPitches are produced on the recorder by covering the holes while blowing into the instrument. Modern terminology refers to the holes on the front of the instrument using the numbers 1 through 7, starting with the hole closest to the beak, with the thumbhole numbered hole 0. At the most basic level, the fingering technique of the recorder involves the sequential uncovering of the holes from lowest to highest (i.e., uncovering 7, then uncovering 7 and 6, then uncovering 7, 6, and 5, etc.) producing even higher pitches. In practice, however, the uncovering of the holes is not strictly sequential, and the half covering or uncovering of holes is an essential part of recorder technique.\nForked fingerings.\nA forked fingering is a fingering in which an open hole has covered holes below it: fingerings for which the uncovering of the holes is not sequential. For example, the fingering 0123 (G5) is not a forked fingering, while 0123 56 (F\u266f5) is a forked fingering because the open hole 4 has holes covered below it\u00a0\u2013 holes 5 and 6. Forked fingerings allow for smaller adjustments in pitch than the sequential uncovering of holes alone would allow. For example, at the same air speed the fingering 0123 5 sounds higher than 01234 but lower than 0123. Many standard recorder fingerings are forked fingerings. Forked fingerings may also be used to produce microtonal variations in pitch.\nForked fingerings have a different harmonic profile from non-forked fingerings, and are generally regarded as having a weaker sound. Forked fingerings that have a different tone color or are slightly sharp or flat can provide so-called \"alternate fingerings\". For example, the fingering 0123 has a slightly sharper forked variant 012 4567.\nPartial covering of holes.\nPartial covering of the holes is an essential part of the playing technique of all recorders. This is variously known as \"leaking\", \"shading\", \"half-holing\", and in the context of the thumb hole, \"pinching\".\nThe primary function of the thumbhole is to serve as an octaving vent. When it is leaked, the first mode of vibration of the air column becomes unstable: i.e., the register changes. In most recorders, this is required for the playing of every note higher than a ninth above the lowest note. The player must adjust the position of the thumb for these notes to sound stable and in tune.\nThe partial opening of the thumbhole may be achieved by sliding or rolling the thumb off the hole, or by bending the thumb at the first knuckle. To partially uncover a covered hole, the player may slide the finger off the hole, bend or roll the finger away from the hole, gently lift the finger from the hole, or a combination of these. To partially cover an open hole, the reverse is possible.\nGenerally speaking, the partial opening of covered finger holes raises the pitch of the sounding note while the partial closure of open finger holes lowers the pitch.\nHoles 6 and 7.\nOn most models of \"baroque\" modern recorders, the lower two fingers of the lower hand actually cover two holes each (called \"double holes\"). Whereas on the vast majority of baroque recorders and all earlier recorders these two fingers covered a single hole (\"single holes\"), double holes have become standard for baroque modelled modern recorders.\nBy covering one or both of these two, smaller holes, a recorder player can play the notes a semitone above the lowest note and a minor third above the lowest note, notes that are possible on single holed recorders only through the partial covering of those holes, or the covering of the bell.\nCovering the bell.\nThe open end of the bore facing away from the player (the \"bell\") may be covered to produce extra notes or effects. Because both hands are typically engaged in holding the recorder or covering the finger holes, the covering of the bell is normally achieved by bringing the end of the recorder in contact with the leg or knee, typically achieved through a combination of bending of the torso and/or raising of the knee. Alternatively, in rare cases instruments may be equipped with a key designed to cover the bell (\"bell key\"), operated by one of the fingers, typically the pinky finger of the upper hand, which is not normally used to cover a hole. Fingerings with a covered bell extend the recorder's chromatic playable range above and below the nominal fingered range.\nAir.\nThe pitch and volume of the recorder sound are influenced by the speed of the air travelling through the windway, which may be controlled by varying the breath pressure and the shape of the vocal tract. The sound is also affected by the turbulence of the air entering the recorder. Generally speaking, faster air in the windway produces a higher pitch. Thus blowing harder causes a note to sound sharp whereas blowing the note gently causes it to sound flat. Knowledge of this fact and the recorder's individual tonal differences over its full range will help recorders play in tune with other instruments by knowing which notes will need slightly more or less air to stay in tune. As mentioned above at \"Harmonic profile\", blowing much harder can result in overblowing.\nBreath.\nThe technique of inhalation and exhalation for the recorder differs from that of many other wind instruments in that the recorder requires very little air pressure to produce a sound, unlike reed or brasswind instruments.\nThus, it is often necessary for a recorder player to produce long, controlled streams of air at a very low pressure. Recorder breathing technique focuses on the controlled release of air rather than on maintaining diaphragmatic pressure.\nTongue, mouth and throat.\nThe use of the tongue to stop and start the air is called \"articulation\". In this capacity, the tongue has two basic functions: to control the start of the note (the attack) and the end, or the length of the note (legato, staccato). Articulations are roughly analogous to consonants. Practically any consonant that may be produced with the tongue, mouth, and throat may be used to articulate on the recorder. Transliterations of common articulation patterns include \"du du du du\" (using the tip of the tongue, \"single tonguing\"), \"du gu du gu\" (alternating between the tip and the back of the tongue, \"double tonguing\"), and \"du g'll du g'll\" (articulation with the tip and the sides of the tongue, \"triple tonguing\"). The attack of the note is governed by such factors as the pressure buildup behind the tongue and shape of the articulant, while the length of the note governed by the stoppage of the air by the tongue. Each articulation pattern has a different natural pattern of attack and length, and recorder technique seeks to produce a wide variety of lengths and attacks using these articulation patterns. Patterns such as these have been used since at least the time of Ganassi (1535).\nMouth and throat shapes are roughly analogous to vowels. The shape of the vocal tract affects the velocity and turbulence of the air entering the recorder. The shape of the mouth and vocal tract is closely related to the consonant used to articulate.\nCoordination.\nThe player must coordinate fingers and tongue to align articulations with finger movements. In normal play, articulated attacks should align with the proper fingering, even in legato passages or in difficult finger transitions and the fingers move in the brief silence between the notes (silence d'articulation) created by the stoppage of the air by the tongue.\nBoth fingers and the breath can be used to control the pitch of the recorder. Coordinating the two is essential to playing the recorder in tune and with a variety of dynamics and timbres. On an elementary level, breath pressure and fingerings must accord with each other to provide an in-tune pitch. As an example of a more advanced form of coordination, a gradual increase in breath pressure combined with the shading of holes, when properly coordinated, results in an increase in volume and change in tone color without a change in pitch. The reverse is possible, decreasing breath pressure and gradually lifting fingers.\nBasic fingering.\n\u25cf means to cover the hole. \u25cb means to uncover the hole. \u25d0 means half-cover.\nThe range of a modern \"baroque\" model recorder is usually considered two octaves and a tone. See the table above for \"English\" fingerings for the standard range. The numbers at the top correspond to the fingers and the holes on the recorder. The vast majority of recorders manufactured today are designed to play using these fingerings, with slight variations. Nonetheless, recorder fingerings vary widely between models and are mutable even for a single recorder: recorder players may use three or more fingerings for the same note along with partial covering of the holes to achieve proper intonation, in coordination with the breath or in faster passages where some fingerings are unavailable. This chart is a general guide, but by no means a definitive or complete fingering chart for the recorder, an impossible task. Rather, it is the basis for a much more complex fingering system, which is still being added to today.\nSome fonts show miniature glyphs of complete recorder fingering charts in TrueType format. Since Unicode does not have values for complete recorder fingering charts, these fonts are custom encoded.\nHistory.\nGeneral.\nDuct flutes and recorders are found in almost every musical tradition around the world. The earliest extant duct flutes date to the Neolithic period. While classifying early instruments has proved controversial, recorders are typically distinguished from other duct flutes by the thumb hole\u2014used as an octaving vent\u2014and seven finger holes. The playing of the recorder in its earliest history is not well documented owing to the lack of surviving records from the time.\nMiddle Ages.\nStructure.\nOur present knowledge of the shape and structure of recorders in the Middle Ages is based on the few instruments now preserved, and on artworks, including iconography, from the period.\nSurviving instruments.\nRecorders surviving from the Middle Ages are heterogeneous. The first instrument discovered is the \"Dordrecht recorder\". Made of fruitwood, it was excavated in 1940 from a well (not a moat) in the ruin of the \"Huis te Merwede\" (\"House on the Merwede\"), near the town of Dordrecht in the Netherlands. As the house was inhabited only from 1335 to 1418, and the site was not disturbed until the modern excavation, so the recorder has been dated to the period of occupation. \nThe instrument itself presents a cylindrical bore of diameter about ; and it is about long with a vibrating air column of about . The block has survived but the labium is damaged, making the instrument unplayable. There are \"tenons\" on both ends of the instrument, suggesting the presence of \"ferrules\" (or \"turnings\"), now lost. Uncertainty about details of these fittings has hindered reconstruction of the instrument's original state.\nA structurally different instrument (the \"G\u00f6ttingen recorder\") was discovered in 1987 in an archaeological excavation of the latrine of a medieval house dated to between 1246 and 1322 in G\u00f6ttingen, Germany. It is fruitwood of one piece with turnings measuring about long. It presents a cylindrical bore growing to at the second highest measurable point, then progressively narrowing to the seventh finger hole, before \"flaring\" again to at the bottom of the instrument, which has a bulbous foot. Unusually, the finger holes taper conically outwards, the opposite of the undercutting found in later Baroque recorders. \nThe top of the instrument is damaged; only a cut side of the windway survives and the block has been lost. A reconstruction model by Hans Reiners produces a strident, penetrating sound rich in overtones, and has a range of two octaves. With the thumb hole and the first three finger holes covered, the reconstruction produces a pitch of ca. 450\u00a0Hz.\nMore instruments and fragments dated to the medieval period have come to light in the 21st century. These include: a 14th century headjoint fragment excavated in Esslingen, Germany (the \"Esslingen fragment\"); a birch instrument dated to the second half of the 14th century, unearthed in Tartu, Estonia (the \"Tartu recorder\"); and the \"Elbl\u0105g recorder\", a fruitwood instrument dated to the 15th century, as found in Elbl\u0105g, Poland.\nCommon features of surviving instruments include: a narrow cylindrical bore (except the G\u00f6ttingen recorder); a doubled seventh hole for the little finger of the lower hand, (except the Tartu recorder), which feature allows for both right- or left-handed playing; a flat or truncated head instead of the narrow beak found on later instruments; and a seventh hole that produces a semitone instead of a tone. Additionally, the Esslingen fragment has turnings similar to the G\u00f6ttingen recorder. No complete instrument longer than has been uncovered, although the Esslingen fragment may represent a larger recorder.\nThe widely-spaced doubled seventh hole was problematic, and persisted into later instruments and later periods\u2014the hole not used was plugged with wax, according to Virdung (1511). It was during the Baroque period that instruments with adjustable footjoints were developed, rendering the doubled holes obsolete.\nClassifying duct flute instruments is further complicated by recorders with seventh holes that produce a semitone instead of a tone. Chromatic fingerings then are difficult, requiring extensive \"half-holing\". Such instruments share similarities with the six-holed flageolet, which used three fingers on each hand, but with \"no thumb hole\". Anthony Rowland-Jones suggested the recorder's thumb hole was (intended as) an improvement over the flageolet, providing stronger fingering for the note one octave above the tonic, while the seventh finger hole provided a leading tone to the tonic. As a result, he suggests describing these flutes instead as \"improved flageolets\", and proposes that \"true recorders\" should produce a full tone (rather than a semitone) when the seventh finger is lifted. \nControversies aside, these instruments very likely are, at least, precursors to later instruments that indisputably are duct flute recorders. Surely all recorders are duct flutes. Duct-flutes which are not Consensus is unlikely as there is sparse documentary evidence from the earliest history of the instrument. That maybe so; and yet, if you let the surviving half-dozen or so surviving medieval recorders speak for themselves you will observe that the lowest interval of most of them was a semitone. Historically, there was no need for an all-inclusive definition that encompassed every form of the instrument past and present. But we may find it useful to make such distinctions, today.\nIconography.\nRecorders with a cylindrical profile are depicted in many medieval paintings; however, their representions appear stylised, and do not easily correspond to surviving instruments. The earliest depiction of the recorder is probably in \"The Mocking of Christ\", a painting from the monastery church of St George in Staro Nagori\u010dano near Kumanovo, Macedonia, in which a man is playing a cylindrical recorder. (The painting of the church began in 1315.) And there is the center pan el of the \"Virgin and Child\", attributed to Pedro (Pere) Serra (c. 1390), as painted for the church of Santa Clara, Tortosa, Spain and now in the Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya, Barcelona\u2014a group of angels gathered around the Virgin Mary, playing musical instruments, one of them playing a cylindrical recorder.\nStarting in the Middle Ages, angels have frequently been depicted as playing one or more recorders, often grouped around the Virgin; and, in several notable paintings, \"trios\" of angels play recorders. Such is perhaps a sign of the trinity, although perhaps of the music itself, which also was typically in three parts.\nRepertoire.\nNo music marked for the recorder survives from prior to 1500. Groups, particularly trios, of flutists playing recorders and of \"angels\" playing recorders, are depicted in paintings from the 15th century, indicating the recorder was used in these configurations and with other instruments. Some of the earliest music must have been vocal repertory. \nModern recorder players have taken up playing instrumental music, some anachronistically, from the period\u2014such as the monophonic \"estampies\" (prints) from the Chansonnier du Roi (13th century), the British Library's Add MS 29987 (14th or 15th century), or the Codex Faenza (15th century). And they have arranged keyboard music of the period for recorder ensembles, including the estampies from the Robertsbridge codex (14th century), or the vocal works of composers Guillaume de Machaut, Johannes Ciconia, and others.\nRenaissance.\nIn the sixteenth century, the structure, repertoire, and performing practice of the recorder is better documented than in prior epochs. The recorder was one of the most important wind instruments of the Renaissance, and many instruments dating to the sixteenth century survive, including some matched consorts. This period also produced the first extant books describing the recorder, including the treatises of Virdung (1511), Agricola (1529), Ganassi (1535), Cardano (c.1546), Jambe de Fer (1556), and Praetorius (1619). Nonetheless, understanding of the instrument and its practice in this period is still developing.\nStructure.\nIn the sixteenth century, the recorder saw important developments in its structure. As in the recorders of the Middle Ages, the etiology of these changes remains uncertain, development was regional and multiple types of recorder existed simultaneously. Our knowledge is based on documentary sources and surviving instruments.\nSurviving instruments.\nFar more recorders survive from the Renaissance than from the Middle Ages. Most of the surviving instruments from the period have a wide, cylindrical bore from the blockline to the uppermost fingerhole, an inverted conical portion down to around the lowest finger hole (the \"choke\"), then a slight flare to the bell. Externally, they have a curved shape similar to the bore, with a profile like a stretched hourglass. Their sound is warm, rich in harmonics, and somewhat introverted. Surviving consorts of this type, identified by their makers marks, include those marked \"HIER S\u2022\" or \"HIE\u2022S\" found in Vienna, Sibiu and Verona; and those marked with variations on a rabbit's footprint, designated \"!!\" by Adrian Brown, which are dispersed among various museums. The pitch of these recorders is often generally grouped around A\u00a0=\u00a0466\u00a0Hz, however little pitch standardisation existed in the period. This type of recorder is described by Praetorius in \"De Organographia\" (1619). A surviving consort by \"!!\" follows the exact size configuration suggested by Praetorius: stacked fifths up from the basset in F3, and down a fifth then a fourth to bass in B\u266d2 and great bass in F2. Instruments marked \"HIER S\u2022\" or \"HIE\u2022S\" are in stacked fifths from great bass in F2 to soprano in E5. Many of these instruments are pitched around A\u00a0=\u00a0440\u00a0Hz or A\u00a0=\u00a0466\u00a0Hz, although pitch varied regionally and between consorts.\nThe range of this type is normally an octave plus a minor 7th, but as remarked by Praetorius (1619) and demonstrated in the fingering tables of Ganassi's \"Fontegara\" (1535), experienced players on particular instruments were capable of playing up to a fourth or even a seventh higher (see ). Their range is more suitable for the performance of vocal music, rather than purely instrumental music. This type is the recorder typically referred to as the \"normal\" Renaissance recorder, however this modern appellation does not fully capture the heterogeneity of instruments of the sixteenth century.\nAnother surviving Renaissance type has a narrow cylindrical bore and cylindrical profile like the medieval exemplars but a choke at the last hole. The earliest surviving recorders of this type were made by the Rafi family, instrument makers active in Lyons in Southern France in the early sixteenth century. Two recorders marked \"C.RAFI\" were acquired by the Accademia Filarmonica, Bologna in 1546, where they remain today. A consort of recorders or similar make, marked \"P.GRE/C/E\", was donated to the Accademia in 1675, expanding the pair marked \"C.RAFI\". Other recorders by the Rafi family survive in Northern Europe, notably a pair in Brussels. It is possible that Grece worked in the Rafi workshop, or was a member of the Rafi family. The pitch of the Rafi/Grece instruments is around A\u00a0=\u00a0440\u00a0Hz. They have a relatively quiet sound with good pitch stability favouring dynamic expression.\nIn 1556, French author Philibert Jambe de Fer gave a set of fingerings for hybrid instruments such as the Rafi and Grece instruments that give a range of two octaves. Here, the 15th was now produced, as on most later recorders, as a variant of the 14th instead of as the fourth harmonic of the tonic, as in Ganassi's tables.\nDocumentary evidence: treatises.\nThe first two treatises of the sixteenth century show recorders that differ from the surviving instruments dating to the century: these are Sebastian Virdung's (b. 1465?) (1511), and Martin Agricola's (1486\u20131556) similar (1529), published in Basel and Saxony respectively.\n, the earliest printed treatise on western musical instruments, is an extract of an earlier, now lost, manuscript treatise by Virdung, a chaplain, singer, and itinerant musician. The printed version was written in a vernacular form of Early New High German, and was aimed at wealthy urban amateur musicians: the title translates, briefly, as \"Music, translated into German ... Everything there is to know about [music] \u2013 made simple.\" When a topic become too complex for Virdung to discuss briefly, he refers the reader to his lost larger work, an unhelpful practice for modern readers. While the illustrations have been called \"maddeningly inaccurate\" and his perspectives quirky, Virdung's treatise gives us an important source on the structure and performing practice of the recorder in northern Europe in the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries.\nThe recorders described by Virdung have cylindrical profiles with flat heads, narrow windows and long ramps, ring-like turnings on the feet, and a slight external flare at the bell (above, far left and middle left). Virdung depicts four recorders together: a or (basset) in F3 with an anchor shaped key and a perforated fontanelle, two tenors in C4 and a (alto) in G4. According to Virdung, the configurations F\u2013C\u2013C\u2013G or F\u2013C\u2013G\u2013G should be used for four-part music, depending on the range of the bass part. As previously mentioned, the accuracy of these woodcuts cannot be verified as no recorders fitting this description survive. Virdung also provides the first ever fingering chart for a recorder with a range of an octave and a seventh, though he says that the bass had a range of only an octave and sixth. In his fingering chart, he numbers which fingers to lift rather than those to put down and, unlike in later charts, numbers them from bottom (1) to top (8). His only other technical instruction is that the player must blow into the instrument and \"learn how to coordinate the articulations ... with the fingers\".\nMartin Agricola's (\"A German instrumental music, in which is contained how to learn to play ... all kinds of ... instruments\"), written in rhyming German verse (ostensibly to improve the understanding and retention of its contents), provides a similar account and copies most of its woodcuts directly from . Agricola also calls the tenor \"altus\", mistakenly depicting it as a little smaller than the tenor in the woodcut (above, middle right). Like Virdung, Agricola takes it for granted that recorders should be played in four-part consorts. Unlike , which provides a single condensed fingering chart, Agricola provides separate, slightly differing, fingering charts for each instrument, leading some to suppose that Agricola experimented on three different instruments, rather than copying the fingerings from one size to the other two. Agricola adds that graces (), which make the melody , must be learned from a professional (), and that the manner of ornamentation () of the organist is best of all. A substantial 1545 revision of approvingly mentions the use of vibrato () for woodwind instruments, and includes an account of articulation, recommending the syllables \"de\" for semiminims and larger, \"di ri\" for semiminims and smaller, and the articulation \"tell ell ell ell el le\", which he calls the \"flutter-tongue\" () for the smallest of note values, found in \"passagi (Colorirn)\".\nThe next treatise comes from Venice: Silvestro Ganassi dal Fontego's (1492\u2013mid-1500s) \"Opera Intitulata Fontegara\" (1535), which is the first work to focus specifically on the technique of playing the recorder, and perhaps the only historical treatise ever published that approaches a description of a professional or virtuoso playing technique. Ganassi was a musician employed by the Doge and at the Basilica di San Marco at the time of the work's publication, an indication of his high level of accomplishment, and later wrote two works on the playing the viol and the violone, although he does not mention being employed by the Doge after \"Fontegara\".\n\"Fontegara\" can be broadly divided into two parts: the first concerns the technique of playing the recorder, the second demonstrated divisions (regole, passagi, ornaments), some of great complexity, which the player may use to ornament a melody or, literally, \"divide\" it into smaller notes. In all aspects, Ganassi emphasises the importance of imitating the human voice, declaring that \"the aim of the recorder player is to imitate as closely as possible all the capabilities of the human voice\", maintaining that the recorder is indeed able to do this. For Ganassi, imitation of the voice has three aspects: \"a certain artistic proficiency\", which seems to be the ability to perceive the nature of the music, (dexterity or fluency), achieved \"by varying the pressure of the breath and shading the tone by means of suitable fingering,\" and (elegance or grace), achieved by articulation, and by the use of ornaments, the \"simplest ingredient\" of them being the trill, which varies according to the expression.\nGanassi gives fingering tables for a range of an octave and a seventh, the standard range also remarked by Praetorius, then tells the reader that he has discovered, through long experimentation, more notes not known to other players due to their lack of perseverance, extending the range to two octaves and a sixth. Ganassi gives fingerings for three recorders with different makers' marks, and advises the reader to experiment with different fingerings, as recorders vary in their bore. The maker's mark of one of the recorders, in the form of a stylised letter \"A\", has been associated with the Schnitzer family of instrument makers in Germany, leading Hermann Moeck to suppose that Ganassi's recorder might have been Northern European in origin. (see also Note on \"Ganassi\" recorders)\nGanassi uses three basic kinds of syllables \"te che\", \"te re\", and \"le re\" and also varies the vowel used with the syllable, suggesting the effect of mouth shape on the sound of the recorder. He gives many combinations of these syllables and vowels, and suggests the choice of the syllables according to their smoothness, \"te che\" being least smooth and \"le re\" being most so. He does not, however, demonstrate how the syllables should be used to music.\nMost of the treatise consists of tables of diminutions of intervals, small melodies and cadences, categorised by their meter. These several hundred divisions use quintuplets, septuplets, note values from whole notes to 32nd notes in modern notation, and demonstrate immense variety and complexity.\nThe frontispiece to \"Fontegara\" shows three recorder players play together with two singers. Like Agricola and Virdung, Ganassi takes for granted that recorders should be played in groups of four, and come in three sizes: F3, C4 and G4. He makes a distinction between solo playing and ensemble playing, noting that what he has said is for solo players, and that when playing with others, it is most important to match them. Unfortunately, Ganassi gives only a few ornamented examples with little context for their use. Nonetheless, Ganassi offers a tantalising glimpse at a highly developed professional culture and technique of woodwind playing that modern players can scarcely be said to have improved upon.\nGerolamo Cardano's \"De Musica\" was written around 1546, but not published until 1663 when it was published along with other works by Cardan, who was an eminent philosopher, mathematician and physician as well as a keen amateur recorder player who learned from a professional teacher, Leo Oglonus, as a child in Milan.\nHis account corroborates that of Ganassi, using the same three basic syllables and emphasising the importance of breath control and ornamentation in recorder playing, but also documents several aspects of recorder technique otherwise undocumented until the twentieth century. These include multiple techniques using the partial closing of the bell: to produce a tone or semitone below the tonic, and to change semitones into dieses (half semitones), which he says can also be produced by \"repercussively bending back the tongue\". He also adds that the position of the tongue, either extended or turned up towards the palate, can be used to improve, vary, and color notes. He is the first to differentiate between the amount of the breath (full, shallow, or moderate) and the force (relaxed or slow, intense, and the median between them) as well as the different amount of air required for each instrument, and describes a trill or vibrato called a in which \"a tremulous quality in the breath\" is combined with a trilling of the fingers to vary the interval from anything between a major third and a diesis. He is also the first writer to mention the recorder in D5 (\"discantus\"), which he leaves unnamed.\nComposer and singer Philibert Jambe de Fer (c. 1515\u00a0\u2013 c. 1566) was the only French author of the sixteenth century to write about the recorder, in his \"Epitome musical\". He complains of the French name for the instrument, ('flute with nine holes') as, in practice, one of the lowermost holes must be plugged, leaving only eight open holes. He prefers or the Italian . His fingering chart is notable for two reasons, first for describing fingerings with the 15th produced as a variant on the 14th, and for using the third finger of the lower hand as a buttress finger, although only for three notes in the lower octave. (See also Renaissance structure.)\nAurelio Virgiliano's \"\" (c. 1600) presents ricercars intended for or playable on the recorder, a description of other musical instruments, and a fingering chart for a recorder in G4 similar to Jambe de Fer's.\nThe \"Syntagma musicum\" (1614\u201320) of Michael Praetorius (1571\u20131621) in three volumes (a fourth was intended but never finished) is an encyclopaedic survey of music and musical instruments. Volume II, \"De Organographia\" (1619) is of particular interest for its description of no fewer than eight sizes of recorder ( or \"exilent\" in G5, \"discant\" in C5 or D5, \"alt\" in G4, \"tenor\" in C4, \"basset\" in F3, \"bass\" in B\u266d2, and in F2) as well as the four-holed .\nPraetorius was the first author to explain that recorders can confuse the ear into believing that they sound an octave lower than pitch, which phenomenon has more recently been explained in relation to the recorder's lack of high harmonics. He also shows the different \"registers\" of consort possible, 2\u2032 (discant, alt, and tenor), 4\u2032 (alt, tenor, and basset), and 8\u2032 (tenor, basset, and bass) (see also Nomenclature). Additionally, he proposed cutting the recorder between the beak and the first finger hole to allow for a kind of tuning slide to raise or lower its pitch, similar to the Baroque practice of adjusting a recorder's pitch by \"pulling out\" the top joint of the recorder.\nThe recorders described in Praetorius are of the \"stretched hourglass\" profile (see above, far right). He gives fingerings like those of Ganassi, and remarks that they normally have a range of an octave and a sixth, although exceptional players could extend that range by a fourth.\n\"Double recorder\".\nSome paintings from the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries depict musicians playing what appear to be two end-blown flutes simultaneously. In some cases, the two flutes are evidently disjoint, separate flutes of similar make, played angled away from each other, one pipe in each hand. In others, flutes of the same length have differing hand positions. In a final case, the pipes are parallel, in contact with each other, and differ in length. While the iconographic criteria for a recorder are typically a clearly recognisable labium and a double handed vertical playing technique, such criteria are not prescriptive, and it is uncertain whether any of these depictions should be considered a single instrument, or constitute a kind of recorder. The identification of the instrument depicted is further complicated by the symbolism of the aulos, a double piped instrument associated with the satyr Marsyas of Greek mythology.\nAn instrument consisting of two attached, parallel, end-blown flutes of differing length, dating to the fifteenth or sixteenth century, was found in poor condition near All Souls College in Oxford. The instrument has four holes finger-holes and a thumb hole for each hand. The pipes have an inverted conical \"choke\" bore (see Renaissance structure). Bob Marvin has estimated that the pipes played a fifth apart, at approximately C5 and G5. The instrument is sui generis. Although the instrument's pipes have thumb holes, the lack of organological precedent makes classification of the instrument difficult. Marvin has used the terms \"double recorder\" and the categorisation-agnostic (double flute) to describe the Oxford instrument.\nMarvin has designed a based on the Oxford instrument, scaled to play at F4 and C5. Italian recorder maker Francesco Livirghi has designed a double recorder or with connected, angled pipes of the same length but played with different hand positions, based on iconographic sources. Its pipes play at F4 and B\u266d4. Both instruments use fingerings of the makers' design.\nNote on \"Ganassi\" recorders.\nIn the 1970s, when recorder makers began to make the first models of recorders from the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, such models were not always representative of the playing characteristics of the original instruments. Especially notable is Fred Morgan's much copied \"Ganassi\" model, based loosely on an instrument in the Vienna Kunsthistorisches museum (inventory number SAM 135), which was designed to use the fingerings for the highest notes in Ganassi's tables in Fontegara. As Morgan knew, these notes were not in standard use; indeed Ganassi uses them in only a few of the hundreds of diminutions contained in Fontegara. Historically, such recorders did not exist as a distinct type, and the fingerings given by Ganassi were those of a skilled player particularly familiar with his instruments. When modern music is written for 'Ganassi recorders' it means this type of recorder.\nRepertoire.\nRecorders were probably first used to play vocal music, later adding purely instrumental forms such as dance music to their repertoire. Much of the vocal music of the fifteenth, sixteenth and seventeenth centuries can be played on recorder consorts, and as illustrated in treatises from Virdung to Praetorius, the choice appropriate instruments and transpositions to play vocal music was common practice in the Renaissance. Additionally, some collections such as those of Pierre Attaingnant and Anthony Holborne, indicate that their instrumental music was suitable for recorder consorts. This section first discusses repertoire marked for the recorder, then briefly, other repertoire played on recorder.\nIn 1505 Giovanni Alvise, a Venetian wind player, offered Francesco Gonzaga of Mantua a motet for eight recorders, however the work has not survived.\nPierre Attaingnant's (fl. 1528\u20131549) (1533) collects 28 (not 27, as in the title) four-part instrumental motets, nine of which he says were suitable for performance on flutes (, German flutes), two on recorders (\",\" nine-holed flutes, \"recorders\"), and twelve suitable for both. Of the twelve marked for both, seven use \"chiavi naturali\", or low-clefs typically used for recorders, while the others use the clefs used in the motets marked for flutes. Hence, the seven notated in could be considered more appropriate for recorders. is the first published music marked for a recorder consort. Earlier is a part for Jacobus Barbireau's song \"\", apparently for recorder, accompanying the recorder fingering chart in \"...\" (Antwerp, 1529), a partial French translation of Virdung's .\nJacques Moderne's published in the 1530s, depicts a four-part recorder consort such as those described in Virdung, Agricola, Ganassi and others, however the dances are not marked for recorders. His (1550) contains ricercares and dances for performance on \", &amp; \".\nIn 1539\u201340, Henry VIII of England, also a keen amateur player (see Cultural significance), imported five brothers of the Bassano family from Venice to form a consort, expanded to six members in 1550, forming a group that maintained an exceptional focus on the recorder until at least 1630 when the recorder consort was combined with the other wind groups. Most wind bands consisted of players playing sackbutts, shawms, and other loud instruments doubling on recorder. Some music probably intended for this group survives, including dance music by Augustine and Geronimo Bassano from the third quarter of the sixteenth century, and the more elaborate fantasias of Jeronimo Bassano (c. 1580), four in five parts and one in six parts. Additionally, the Fitzwilliam wind manuscript (\"GB-Cfm\" 734) contains wordless motets, madrigals and dance pieces, including some by the Bassano family, probably intended for a recorder consort in six parts.\nThe English members of the Bassano family, having originated in Venice, were also probably familiar with the vocal style, advanced technique, and complex improvised ornamentation described in Ganassi's \"Fontegara\", and they were probably among the recorder players whom Ganassi reports having worked and studied with: when they were brought to England, they were regarded as some of the best wind players in Venice. While most of the music attributed to the consort uses only a range of a thirteenth, it is possible that the Bassano's were familiar with Ganassi's extended range.\nRecorders were also played with other instruments, especially in England, where it was called a mixed consort or \"broken consort\".\nOther sixteenth-century composers whose instrumental music can be played well on recorder consorts include:\nOther notable composers of the Renaissance whose music may be played on the recorder include:\nCultural significance.\nThe recorder was widely used in the sixteenth century, and was one of the most common instruments of the Renaissance. From the fifteenth century onwards, paintings show upper-class men and women playing recorder, and Virdung's didactic treatise (1511), the first of its kind, was aimed at the amateur (see also Documentary evidence). Henry VIII was a recorder player; at his death in 1547 an inventory of his possessions included 76 recorders in consorts of various sizes and materials. Some Italian paintings from the sixteenth century show aristocracy of both sexes playing the recorder, however many gentlemen found it unbecoming to play because it uses the mouth, preferring the lute and later the viol.\nShakespeare mentions the recorder in \"Hamlet\", written at the turn of the seventeenth century, as does Milton in \"Paradise Lost\" published in 1667, in which fallen angels in Hell \"move / in perfect phalanx to the Dorian mood / of flutes and soft recorders\".\nBaroque recorders.\nStructure.\nSeveral changes in the construction of recorders took place in the seventeenth century, resulting in the type of instrument generally referred to as \"Baroque\" recorders, as opposed to the earlier \"Renaissance\" recorders. These innovations allowed baroque recorders to possess a tone regarded as \"sweeter\" than that of the earlier instruments, at the expense of a reduction in volume, particularly in the lowest notes.\nThe evolution of the Renaissance recorder into the Baroque instrument is generally attributed to the Hotteterre family, in France. They developed the ideas of a more tapered bore, bringing the finger-holes of the lowermost hand closer together, allowing greater range, and enabling the construction of instruments in several jointed sections. The last innovation allowed more accurate shaping of each section and also offered the player minor tuning adjustments, by slightly pulling out one of the sections to lengthen the instrument.\nThe French innovations were taken to London by Pierre Bressan, a set of whose instruments survive in the Grosvenor Museum, Chester, as do other examples in various American, European and Japanese museums and private collections. Bressan's contemporary, Thomas Stanesby, was born in Derbyshire but became an instrument maker in London. He and his son (Thomas Stanesby junior) were the other important British-based recorder-makers of the early eighteenth century.\nIn continental Europe, the Denner family of Nuremberg were the most celebrated makers of this period.\nThe baroque recorder produces a most brilliant and projecting sound in the second octave, which is more facile and extended than that of earlier recorders, while the lowest notes in its range are relatively weak. Composers such as Bach, Telemann and Vivaldi exploit this property in their concertos for the instrument.\nMeasured from its lowest to its highest playable note, the baroque alto recorder has a range of at most two octaves and a fifth with many instruments having a smaller range. Even the most developed instruments of the period, however, cannot produce the augmented tonic, third and fourth of the third octave. Notably, Georg Philipp Telemann's concerto TWV 51:F1 makes use some of these notes in the third octave, posing significant technical challenges to the player, perhaps requiring the covering of the bell or other unusual techniques.\nRepertoire.\nJacob van Eyck composed a collection of about 140 melodies, each with a number of diminutions or variations, for solo soprano recorder.\nDuring the baroque period, the recorder was traditionally associated with pastoral scenes, miraculous events, funerals, marriages, and amorous scenes. Images of recorders can be found in literature and artwork associated with all of these. Purcell, J.\u00a0S. Bach, Telemann, and Vivaldi used the recorder to suggest shepherds and imitate birds in their music.\nAlthough the recorder achieved a greater level of standardisation in the Baroque than in previous periods, indeed it is the first period in which there was a \"standard\" size of recorder, ambiguous nomenclature and uncertain organological evidence have led to controversy regarding which instruments should be used in some \"flute\" parts from the period.\nFourth Brandenburg Concerto BWV 1049.\nThe concertino group of Bach's fourth Brandenburg Concerto in G major, BWV 1049, consists of a , and , with ripieno strings. His later harpsichord transcription of this concerto, BWV 1057, lowers the key by a tone, as in all of Bach's harpsichord transcriptions, and is scored for solo harpsichord, two and ripieno strings. The desired instrument for the parts in BWV 1049 has been a matter of perennial musicological and organological debate for two primary reasons: first, the term is not mentioned in dictionaries or tutors of the period; and second, the first part uses F#6, a note which is difficult to produce on a Baroque alto recorder in F4.\nThe instrumentation of BWV 1057 is uncontroversial: unambiguously specifies recorders, and both parts have been modified to fit comfortably on altos in F4, avoiding, for example, an unplayable Eb4 in the second that would have resulted from a simple transposition of a tone.\nFor the first and last movements of the concerto, two opinions predominate: first, that both recorder parts should be played on alto recorders in F4; and second, that the first part should be played on an alto recorder in G and the second part on an alto in F. Tushaar Power has argued for the alto in G4 on the basis that Bach uses the high F#6, which can be easily played on an alto in G4, but not the low F4, a note not playable on the alto in G4. He corroborates this with other alto recorder parts in Bach's cantatas. Michael Marissen reads the repertoire differently, demonstrating that in other recorder parts, Bach used both the low F4 and F#6, as well as higher notes. Marissen argues that Bach was not as consistent as Power asserts, and that Bach would have almost certainly had access to only altos in F. He corroborates this with examinations of pitch standards and notation in Bach's cantatas, in which the recorder parts are sometimes written as transposing instruments to play with organs that sounded as much as a minor third above written pitch. Marissen also reads Bach's revisions to the recorder parts in BWV 1057 as indicative of his avoidance of F#6 in BWV 1049, a sign that he only used the difficult note when necessary in designing the part for an alto recorder in F4. He posits that Bach avoided F#6 in BWV 1049, at the cost of inferior counterpoint, reinstating them as E6 in BWV 1057.\nIn the second movement, breaking of beaming in the parts, markings of \"f\" and \"p,\" the fermata over the final double bar of the first movement, and the 21 bars of rest at the beginning of the third have led some musicologists to argue that Bach intended the use of \"echo flutes\" distinct from normal recorders in the second movement in particular. The breaking of beaming could be an indication of changes in register or tonal quality, the rests introduced to allow the players time to change instruments, and the markings of \"f\" and \"p\" further indicative of register or sound changes. Marissen has demonstrated that the \"f\" and \"p\" markings probably indicated tutti and solo sections rather than loud and soft ones.\nA number of instruments other than normal recorders have been suggested for the . One of the earliest proposed alternatives, by Thurston Dart, was the use of double flageolets, a suggestion since revealed to be founded on unsteady musicological grounds. Dart did, however, bring to light numerous newspaper references to Paisible's performance on an \"echo flute\" between 1713 and 1718. Another contemporary reference to the \"echo flute\" is in Etienne Louli\u00e9's (Amsterdam, 1696): (The sounds of two echo flutes are different, because one is strong and the other is weak). Louli\u00e9 is unclear on why one would need two echo flutes to play strongly and weakly, and on why it is that echo flutes differ. Perhaps the echo flute was composed in two halves: one which plays strongly, the other weakly? On this we can only speculate.\nSurviving instruments which are candidates for echo flutes include an instrument in Leipzig which consists of two recorders of different tonal characteristics joined at the head and footjoints by brass flanges. But this particular instrument consists of two soprano recorders in d\u2019. There is also evidence of double recorders tuned in thirds, but these are not candidates for the parts in BWV 1049.\n\"\" RV 443, 444, 445.\nVivaldi wrote three concertos for the , possibly for performance by students at the Ospedale della Piet\u00e0 in Venice, where he taught and composed in the early eighteenth century. They feature virtuosic solo writing, and along with his concerto RV 441 and trio sonata RV 86 are his most virtuosic recorder works. They each survive a single hastily written manuscript copy, each titled (Concerto for little flute) with the additional note (The instruments transpose by a fourth) in RV 443 and (The instruments lower by a fourth) in RV 445. The three concertos RV 443, 444, and 445 are notated in C major, C major and A minor respectively. Also of note is the occasional use of notes outside the normal two octave compass of the recorder: the range of the solo sections is two octaves from notated F4 to notated F6, however there is a single notated C4 in the first movement of RV 444, a notated E4 in a tutti section in the first movement of RV 443 and low E4 in multiple tutti sections of RV 445.\nA number of possible have been proposed as the instrument intended for the performance of these concertos. The first suggestion was the use of the one keyed piccolo, or another small transverse flute, however such instruments had fallen out of use in Venice by the generally accepted time of composition of these concertos in the 1720s, and this opinion is no longer considered well supported. Another suggestion, first proposed by Peter Thalheimer, is the \"French\" flageolet (see Flageolets below) in G5, which was notated in D4, appearing a fourth lower, possibly explaining the note in the margins of RV 443 and RV 445 () and supported by Bismantova (1677 rev. 1694) and Bonanni (1722) which equate to the flageolet. However this suggestion has been opposed by the presence of notated F4 and F\u266f4 which are not within the typical compass of the flageolet, although they may be produced through the covering of the bell, sometimes combined with underblowing, as attested by theorists as early as Cardano (c.\u00a01546) and as late as Bellay (c.\u00a01800).\nTwo instruments are conventionally accepted today for the performance of these concertos, the sopranino recorder, notated like an alto but sounding an octave higher, and the soprano recorder, following the instruction to transpose the parts down by a fourth. Winfried Michel was first to argue in favour of the soprano recorder in 1983, when he proposed to take Vivaldi at his word and transpose the string parts down a fourth and play the part on a soprano recorder in C5 (also \"fifth-flute\") using the English practice of notating such flutes as transposing instruments using the fingerings of an alto recorder. Michel notes that this transposition allows for the use of the violins' and viola's lowest strings (in sections where they provide the accompaniment without bass) and the lowest two notes of the 'cello. He attributes the presence of notes not in the recorder's normal compass to Vivaldi's haste, noting that these notes do not appear in the solo sections. He has edited editions of RV 443 and RV 445 for soprano recorder in G major and E minor respectively. Federico Maria Sardelli concurs with Michel in supposing that the margin note was intended to allow the performance of the concertos on the soprano recorder on a specific occasion, however concludes that they were probably written for the sopranino recorder in F5, noting that small transverse flutes had fallen out of use in Italy by Vivaldi's time, the paucity of flageolets in Italy, the range of the parts, and uses of the in vocal arias.\nClassical and Romantic.\nThe recorder was little used in art music of the Classical and Romantic periods. Researchers have long debated why this change occurred, and to what extent the recorder remained use in the late eighteenth century, and later the nineteenth century. A significant question in this debate is which, if any, duct flutes of this period are recorders or successors to recorders.\nRepertoire.\nThe recorder work of the latter half of the eighteenth century most known today is probably a trio sonata by C.\u00a0P.\u00a0E. Bach, Wq.163, composed in 1755\u00a0\u2013 an arrangement of a trio sonata for two violins and continuo, scored for the unusual ensemble of viola, bass recorder and continuo. This work is also notable for being perhaps the only significant surviving historical solo work for bass recorder. Also of note are the works of Johann Christoph Schultze (c. 1733\u20131813), who wrote two concertos for the instrument, one in G major and another in B\u266d major, written around 1740. The last occurrences of the recorder in art music are apparently by Carl Maria von Weber in \"Peter Schmoll und seine Nachbarn\" (1801) and (1806). Hector Berlioz may have intended \"\" from \"L'enfance du Christ\" (1853) for the instrument. Donizetti owned three recorders. Rossini owned two. \nDecline.\nMany reasons supporting the conventional view that the recorder declined have been proposed. The first significant explanation for the recorder's decline was proposed by Waitzman (1967), who proposed six reasons:\nIn the Baroque, the majority of professional recorder players were primarily oboists or string players. For this reason, the number of professional exponents of the recorder was smaller than that of other woodwinds.\nOthers attribute the decline of the recorder in part to the flute innovators of the time, such as Grenser, and Tromlitz, who extended the transverse flute's range and evened out its tonal consistency through the addition of keys, or to the supposedly greater dynamic range and volume of the flute. Similar developments occurring in many other orchestral instruments to make them louder, increase their range, and increase their tonal consistency did not simultaneously occur in the case of the recorder.\nA complementary view recently advanced by Nikolaj Tarasov is that the recorder, rather than totally disappearing, evolved in similar ways to other wind instruments through the addition of keys and other devices, and remained in use throughout the nineteenth century, with its direct descendant's popularity overlapping with the late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century recorder revival. Support for this view rests on the organological classification of some nineteenth century duct flutes as recorders. For more on this question, see \"Other duct flutes\".\nOther duct flutes.\nDuct flutes remained popular even as the recorder waned in the eighteenth century. As in the instrument's earliest history, questions of the instrument's quiddity are at the forefront of modern debate. The modification and renaming of recorders in the eighteenth century in order to prolong their use, and the uncertainty of the extent of the recorder's use the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries have fuelled these debates. Some recent researchers contend that some nineteenth-century duct flutes are actually recorders. This article briefly discusses the duct flutes presented as successors to the recorder: the English flageolet and the csakan, which were popular among amateurs in the second half of the eighteenth century, and the whole of the nineteenth.\nFlageolets.\nThe word \"flageolet\" has been used since the sixteenth century to refer to small duct flutes, and the instrument is sometimes designated using general terms such as and , complicating identification of its earliest form. It was first described by Mersenne in (1636) as having four fingers holes on the front and two thumb holes on the back, with a lowest note C6 and a compass of two octaves. Like the recorder, the upper thumb hole is used as an octaving vent. Flageolets were generally small flutes; however, their lowest note varies. They were initially popular in France, and it is from there that the flageolet first arrived in England in the seventeenth century, becoming a popular amateur instrument, as the recorder later did. Indeed, when the recorder was introduced to England, it was presented as an easy instrument for those who already played the flageolet, and the earliest English recorder tutors are notated in the flageolet tablature of the time, called \"dot-way\". Notably, the diarist and naval administrator Samuel Pepys (1633\u20131703) and his wife were both amateur players of the flageolet, and Pepys was later an amateur recorder player.\nStarting in the early 1800s, a number of innovations were introduced to the flageolet, including the addition of keys to extend its range and allow it to more easily play accidentals. They also included solutions to the problem of condensation: most commonly, a sea sponge was placed inside the wind chamber (the conical chamber above the windway) to soak up moisture. More novel solutions such as the insertion of a thin wooden wedge into the windway, the drilling of little holes in the side of the block to drain condensation, and a complex system for draining condensation through a hollowed-out block were also developed. Around 1800 in England, the recorder (\"English flute\", see Name) came to be called an \"English flageolet\", appropriating the name of the more fashionable instrument. From at least this time to the present, the flageolet in its first form has been called the French flageolet to differentiate it from the so-called English flageolet.\nFrom around 1803, when the London instrument maker William Bainbridge obtained a number of patents for improvements to the English flageolet, instruments were often referred as \"improved\" or \"patent\" flageolets with little reference to how they actually differed from their predecessors. In this period, the instrument had six finger holes and single thumb hole, and had as many as six keys. Tarasov reports that the English flageolets of the late eighteenth century had six finger holes and no thumb hole, and later regained the thumb hole and seventh finger hole (see above, right). The English flageolet never reached the level of popularity that the \"French\" flageolet enjoyed in the nineteenth century, possibly because the latter instrument was louder. Both remained popular until the beginning of the twentieth century.\nA significant amount of music was written for the flageolet in the nineteenth century, such as the etudes of Narcisse Bousquet, although much of it was directed at amateurs.\nEnglish flageolets that may qualify as recorders are of two types: those early instruments, called \"English flageolets\", which were actually recorders, and nineteenth-century instruments with seven finger holes and a thumb hole. These instruments are not typically regarded as recorders; however, Tarasov has argued for their inclusion in the family.\nCsakan.\nThe csakan (from Hung. 'pickaxe'), also known by the recorder's old French name , was a duct flute in the shape of a walking stick or oboe popular in Vienna from about 1800 to the 1840s. The csakan was played using the fingerings of a recorder in C, and was typically pitched in A\u266d or G and played as a transposing instrument. The first documented appearance of the csakan was at a concert in Budapest on 18 February 1807 in a performance by its billed inventor, Anton Heberle (fl. 1806\u201316). Tarasov has contested Heberle's status as the inventor of the instrument, and has argued that the csakan grew out of a Hungarian war hammer of the same name, which was converted into a recorder, perhaps for playing military music. Around 1800, it was highly fashionable for make walking sticks with additional functions (e.g., umbrellas, swords, flutes, oboes, clarinets, horns) although the csakan was the most popular of these, and the only one that became a musical instrument in its own right.\nThe earliest instruments were shaped like a walking stick with a mouthpiece in the handle and had no keys, although they could eventually have up to thirteen keys, along with a tuning slide and a device for narrowing the thumb hole. In the 1820s a csakan \"in the pleasing shape of an oboe\" was introduced in a \"simple\" form with a single key and a \"complex\" form with up to twelve keys like those found on contemporaneous flutes. Well-known makers of the csakan included Johann Ziegler and Stephan Koch in Vienna, and Franz Sch\u00f6llnast in Pressburg. According to accounts left by Sch\u00f6llnast, the csakan was primarily an amateur instrument, purchased by those who wanted something simple and inexpensive, however there were also accomplished professionals, such as Viennese court oboist Ernst Kr\u00e4hmer (1795\u20131837) who toured as far afield as Russia, playing the csakan with acclaimed virtuosity.\nAround 400 works for the csakan were published in the first half of the nineteenth century, mainly for csakan solo, csakan duet or csakan with guitar or piano. The csakan's repertoire has not yet been fully explored. Notable composers for the instrument include Heberle and Kr\u00e4hmer, and Tarasov notes that piano works by Beethoven were arranged for csakan and guitar (Beethoven is reported to have owned a walking-stick csakan). Modern recorder makers such as Bernhard Mollenhauer and Martin Wenner have made csakan copies.\nSimilarities in fingering and design make the csakan at least a close relative of the recorder. Accounts of Kr\u00e4hmer's playing, which report his \"diminishing and swelling the notes, up to an almost unbelievable loudness\" imply a developed technique using shading and alternate fingerings, far beyond a purely amateur culture of house music. Additionally, Tarasov reports that some recorders by Baroque makers were modified, around 1800, through the addition of keys, including a J.\u00a0C. Denner (1655\u20131707) basset recorder in Budapest and an alto by Nikolaus Staub (1664\u20131734) with added G\u266f keys, like the D\u266f key on a baroque two-key flute. Another modification is the narrowing of the thumb hole, by way of an ivory plug on the J.\u00a0C. Denner basset and an alto by Benedikt Gahn (1674\u20131711), to allow it to serve purely as an octaving vent, as found on many flageolets and csakans. These changes may be archetypal to those found on csakans and flageolets, and constitute an inchoate justification for the continuous development of the Baroque recorder into its nineteenth-century relatives.\nModern revival.\nThe \"revival\".\nThe concept of a recorder \"revival\" must be considered in the context of the decline of the recorder in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. The craft of recorder making was continued in some form by a number of families, such as the produced by the Oeggle family, which traces its lineage to the Walch family of recorder makers the careers of the Schlosser family of Zwota. Heinrich Oskar Schlosser (1875\u20131947) made instruments sold by the firm of Moeck in Celle and helped to design their Tuju series of recorders. The firm Mollenhauer, currently headed by Bernhard Mollenhauer, can trace its origins to historical instrument makers.\nThe recorder, if it did persist through the nineteenth century, did so in a manner quite unlike the success it enjoyed in previous centuries, or that it would enjoy in the century to come in. Among the earliest ensembles to begin use of recorders in the twentieth century was the Bogenhauser K\u00fcnstlerkapelle (Bogenhausen Artists' Band) which from 1890 to 1939 used antique recorders and other instruments to play music of all ages, including arrangements of classical and romantic music. Nonetheless, the recorder was considered primarily an instrument of historical interest.\nThe eventual success of the recorder in the modern era is often attributed to Arnold Dolmetsch. While he was responsible for broadening interest in the United Kingdom beyond the small group of early music specialists, Dolmetsch was not solely responsible for the recorder's broader revival. On the continent his efforts were preceded by those of musicians at the Brussels Conservatoire (where Dolmetsch received his training), and by the German Bogenhauser K\u00fcnstlerkapelle. Also in Germany, the work of Willibald Gurlitt, Werner Danckerts and Gustav Scheck proceeded quite independently of the Dolmetsches.\nPlayers.\nCarl Dolmetsch, the son of Arnold Dolmetsch, became one of the first virtuoso recorder players in the 1920s; but more importantly he began to commission recorder works from leading composers of his day, especially for performance at the Haslemere festival which his father ran. Initially as a result of this, and later as a result of the development of a Dutch school of recorder playing led by Kees Otten, the recorder was introduced to serious musicians as a virtuoso solo instrument both in Britain and in northern Europe.\nAmong the influential virtuosos who figure in the revival of the recorder as a serious concert instrument in the latter part of the twentieth century are Ferdinand Conrad, Kees Otten, Frans Br\u00fcggen, Roger Cotte, Hans-Martin Linde, Bernard Krainis, and David Munrow. Br\u00fcggen recorded most of the landmarks of the historical repertoire and commissioned a substantial number of new works for the recorder. Munrow's 1975 double album \"The Art of the Recorder\" remains as an important anthology of recorder music through the ages.\nAmong late twentieth-century and early 21st-century recorder ensembles, the trio Sour Cream (led by Frans Br\u00fcggen), Flautando K\u00f6ln, the Flanders Recorder Quartet, Amsterdam Loeki Stardust Quartet and Quartet New Generation have programmed remarkable mixtures of historical and contemporary repertoire. Soloists such as Piers Adams, Dan Laurin and Dorothee Oberlinger, Michala Petri, Maurice Steger.\nIn the 2012 Charlotte Barbour-Condini became the first recorder player to reach the final of the biennial BBC Young Musician of the Year competition. Recorder player Sophie Westbrooke was a finalist in the 2014 competition.\nStructure.\nThe first recorders to be played in the modern period were antique instruments from previous periods. Anecdotally, Arnold Dolmetsch was motivated to make his own recorders after losing a bag containing his antique instruments. Recorders made in the early twentieth century were imitative of baroque models in their exterior form, but differed significantly in their structure. Dolmetsch introduced English fingering, the now standard fingering for \"baroque\" model instruments, and standardised the doubled 6th and 7th holes found on a handful of antique instruments by the English makers Stanesby and Bressan. Dolmetsch instruments generally had a large rectangular windway, unlike the curved windways of all historical instruments, and played at modern pitch.\nRepertoire.\nNearly twice as many pieces have been written for the recorder since its modern revival as were written in all previous epochs. Many of these were composed by avant-garde composers of the latter half of the twentieth century who used the recorder for the variety of extended techniques which are possible using its open holes and its sensitivity to articulation.\nModern composers of great stature have written for the recorder, including Paul Hindemith, Luciano Berio, J\u00fcrg Baur, Markus Zahnhausen, Josef Tal, John Tavener, Michael Tippett, Benjamin Britten, Leonard Bernstein, Gordon Jacob, Malcolm Arnold, Steven Stucky, Sean Hickey, and Edmund Rubbra.\nOwing to its ubiquity as a teaching instrument and the relative ease of sound production, the recorder has occasionally been used in popular music by groups such as The Beatles; the Rolling Stones (see, for example, \"Ruby Tuesday\"); Yes, for example, in the song \"I've Seen All Good People\"; Jefferson Airplane with Grace Slick on \"Surrealistic Pillow\"; Led Zeppelin (\"Stairway to Heaven\"); Jimi Hendrix; Siouxsie and the Banshees; Judy Dyble of Fairport Convention; Dido (e.g. \"Grafton Street\" on \"Safe Trip Home\").\nManufacture.\nThe trade of recorder making was traditionally transmitted via apprenticeship. Notable historical makers include the Rafi, Schnitzer and Bassano families in the renaissance; Stanesby (Jr. and Sr.), J.C. and J. Denner, Hotteterre, Bressan, Haka, Heitz, Rippert, Rottenburgh, Steenbergen and Terton. Most of these makers also built other wind instruments such as oboes and transverse flutes. Notably, Jacob Denner is credited with the development of the clarinet from the chalumeau.\nRecorder making declined with the instrument's wane in the late eighteenth century, essentially severing the craft's transmission to the modern age. With few exceptions, the duct flutes manufactured in the nineteenth and late eighteenth centuries were intended for amateur or educational use, and were not constructed to the high standard of earlier epochs.\nArnold Dolmetsch, the first to achieve commercial production in the twentieth century, began to build recorders in 1919. While these early recorders played at a low pitch like that of the available originals, he did not strive for exactitude in reproduction, and by the 1930s the Dolmetsch family firm, then under the direction of Arnold's son Carl Dolmetsch, was mass-producing recorders at modern pitch with wide, straight windways, and began to produce bakelite recorders shortly after the Second World War. Nonetheless, the Dolmetsch models were innovative for their time and proved influential, particularly in standardising the English fingering system now standard for modern baroque-style instruments and doubled 6th and 7th holes, which are rare on antique instruments.\nIn Germany, Peter Harlan began to market recorders provided by various makers in the 1920s, primarily for educational use in the youth movement. Contrary to popular belief, he never made recorders himself. Following Harlan's success, numerous makers such as Adler and Mollenhauer began commercial production of recorders, fuelling an explosion in the instrument's popularity in Germany. These recorders shared little in common with antiques, with large straight windways, anachronistically pitched consorts, modified fingering systems and other innovations.\nIn the latter half of the twentieth century, historically informed performance practice was on the rise and recorder makers increasingly sought to imitate the sound and character of antiques. The German-American maker Friedrich von Huene was among the first to research recorders held in European collections and produce instruments intended to reproduce the qualities of the antiques. Von Huene and his Australian colleague Frederick Morgan sought to connect the tradition of the historical wind-makers to the modern day with the understanding that doing so creates the best instruments, and those most suited to ancient music.\nVirtually all recorders manufactured today claim ascendancy to an antique model and most makers active today can trace their trade directly to one of these pioneering makers.\nToday, makers maintaining individual workshops include Ammann, Blezinger, Bolton, Boudreau, Breukink (dead), Brown, Coomber (discontinued), Cranmore, de Paolis, Ehlert, Holmblat, Meyer (dead), Musch, Netsch, Prescott (discontinued), Rohmer, Takeyama, von Huene, Wenner and Willman. French maker Philippe Bolton created an electroacoustic recorder and is among the last to offer mounted bell-keys and double bell-keys for both tenor and alto recorders. Those bell-keys extend easily the range of the instrument to more than three octaves. A bell key as such was probably first made in 1953 by John W.F. Juritz, a physics lecturer and bassoonist in Cape Town, whose invention was not patented. It was reinvented by Carl Dolmetsch in 1957 who first used the bell-key system publicly in 1958.\nUse in schools.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Stack/styles.css\"/&gt;\nIn the 20th century, Carl Orff used the recorder as part of his Orff-Schulwerk didactic approach. His five-volume \"Musik f\u00fcr Kinder\", published between 1950 and 1954, contains pieces for recorders, often in combination with other instruments.\nManufacturers have made recorders out of bakelite and other more modern plastics; they are thus easy to produce, hence inexpensive. Because of this, recorders are popular in schools, as they are one of the cheapest instruments to buy in bulk.\nIn the 1940s and 1950s, the mid-20th century recorder revival was driven in part by manufacturers utilizing plastic injection molding to mass produce recorders, which were sold to schools for a US dollar each ().\nRecorders are also relatively easy to play at a basic level because sound production needs only breath, and pitch is primarily determined by fingering (although excessive breath pressure will tend to drive the pitch sharp).\nMost Japanese students are taught to play the recorder.\nRecorder ensembles.\nThe recorder is a very social instrument. Many recorder players participate in large groups or in one-to-a-part chamber groups, and there is a wide variety of music for such groupings including many modern works. Groups of different sized instruments help to compensate for the limited note range of the individual instruments. Four part arrangements with a soprano, alto, tenor and bass part played on the corresponding recorders are common, although more complex arrangements with multiple parts for each instrument and parts for lower and higher instruments may also be regularly encountered. A recorder carved from a carrot is a regular instrument in the London Vegetable Orchestra.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is also commonly referred to as the Queen's English or King's English. The study of RP is concerned only with matters of pronunciation, while other features of standard British English, such as vocabulary, grammar, and style, are not considered.\nLanguage scholars have long disagreed on RP's exact definition, how geographically neutral it is, how many speakers there are, the nature and classification of its sub-varieties, how appropriate a choice it is as a standard, how the accent has changed over time, and even its name. Furthermore, RP has changed to such a degree over the last century that many of its early 20th-century traditions of transcription and analysis have become outdated or are no longer considered evidence-based by linguists. Standard Southern British English (SSBE) is a label some linguists use for the variety that gradually evolved from RP in the late 20th century and replaced it as the commonplace standard variety of Southern England, while others now simply use SSBE and RP as synonyms. Still, the older traditions of RP analysis continue to be commonly taught and used, for instance in language education and comparative linguistics, and RP remains a popular umbrella term in British society.\nHistory.\nIn the first edition of the British phonetician Daniel Jones's \"English Pronouncing Dictionary\" (1917), he named the accent \"Public School Pronunciation\"; for the second edition in 1926 he wrote: \"In what follows I call it Received Pronunciation, for want of a better term\". However, the term had been used much earlier by P. S. Du Ponceau in 1818 and the Oxford English Dictionary cites quotations back to about 1710. A similar term, \"received standard,\" was coined by Henry C. K. Wyld in 1927. The early phonetician Alexander John Ellis used both terms interchangeably, but with a much broader definition than Jones's, saying, \"There is no such thing as a uniform educated pron. of English, and rp. and rs is a variable quantity differing from individual to individual, although all its varieties are 'received', understood and mainly unnoticed\".\nAlthough a form of Standard English had been established in the City of London by the end of the 15th century, it did not begin to resemble RP until the late 19th century. RP has most in common with the dialects of what has been termed the South East Midlands, in particular the Golden Triangle of universities, namely London, Oxford and Cambridge, and the public schools that fed them, such as Eton, Harrow and Rugby. In 1922, the BBC selected RP as its broadcasting standard, citing its being widely understood globally as a reason.\nAccording to \"Fowler's Modern English Usage\" (1965), \"the correct term is 'the Received Pronunciation'. The word 'received' conveys its original meaning of 'accepted' or 'approved', as in 'received wisdom'.\"\nAlternative names.\nSome linguists have used the term \"RP\" while expressing reservations about its suitability. The Cambridge-published \"English Pronouncing Dictionary\" (aimed at those learning English as a foreign language) uses the phrase \"BBC Pronunciation\", on the basis that the name \"Received Pronunciation\" is \"archaic\" and that BBC News presenters no longer suggest high social class and privilege to their listeners. Other writers have also used the name \"BBC Pronunciation\". The term 'The Queen's English' has also been used by some writers.\nThe phonetician Jack Windsor Lewis frequently criticised the name \"Received Pronunciation\" in his blog: he has called it \"invidious\", a \"ridiculously archaic, parochial and question-begging term\" and noted that American scholars find the term \"quite curious\". He used the term \"General British\" (to parallel \"General American\") in his 1970s publication of \"A Concise Pronouncing Dictionary of American and British English\" and in subsequent publications. The name \"General British\" is adopted in the latest revision of Gimson's \"Pronunciation of English\". Beverley Collins and Inger Mees use the term \"Non-Regional Pronunciation\" for what is often otherwise called RP, and reserve the term \"Received Pronunciation\" for the \"upper-class speech of the twentieth century\". Received Pronunciation has sometimes been called \"Oxford English\", as it used to be the accent of most members of the University of Oxford. The \"Handbook of the International Phonetic Association\" uses the name \"Standard Southern British\". Page 4 reads:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Standard Southern British (where 'Standard' should not be taken as implying a value judgment of 'correctness') is the modern equivalent of what has been called 'Received Pronunciation' ('RP'). It is an accent of the south east of England which operates as a prestige norm there and (to varying degrees) in other parts of the British Isles and beyond.\nSub-varieties.\nFaced with the difficulty of defining a single standard of RP, some researchers have tried to distinguish between sub-varieties:\nPrevalence and perceptions.\nTraditionally, Received Pronunciation has been associated with high social class. It was the \"everyday speech in the families of Southern English persons whose men-folk [had] been educated at the great public boarding-schools\" and which conveyed no information about that speaker's region of origin before attending the school. An 1891 teacher's handbook stated, \"It is the business of educated people to speak so that no-one may be able to tell in what county their childhood was passed\". Nevertheless, in the 19th century some British prime ministers, such as William Ewart Gladstone, still spoke with some regional features.\nOpinions differ over the proportion of Britons who speak RP. Trudgill estimated 3% in 1974, but that rough estimate has been questioned by J. Windsor Lewis. Upton notes higher estimates of 5% (Romaine, 2000) and 10% (Wells, 1982) but refers to these as \"guesstimates\" not based on robust research.\nThe claim that RP is non-regional is disputed, since it is most commonly found in London and the southeast of England. It is defined in the \"Concise Oxford English Dictionary\" as \"the standard accent of English as spoken in the South of England\", and alternative names such as \"Standard Southern British\" have been used.\nDespite RP's historic high social prestige in Britain, being seen as the accent of those with power, money, and influence, it may be perceived negatively by some as being associated with undeserved, or accidental, privilege and as a symbol of the southeast's political power in Britain. Based on a 1997 survey, Jane Stuart-Smith wrote, \"RP has little status in Glasgow, and is regarded with hostility in some quarters\". A 2007 survey found that residents of Scotland and Northern Ireland tend to dislike RP. It is shunned by some with left-wing political views, who may be proud of having accents more typical of the working classes.\nSince the Second World War, and increasingly since the 1960s, a wider acceptance of regional English varieties has taken hold in education and public life. Nonetheless, surveys from 1969 to 2022 consistently show that RP is perceived as the most prestigious accent of English in the United Kingdom. In 2022, 25% of British adults reported being mocked for their regional accent at work, and 46% in social situations.\nUse.\nMedia.\nIn the early days of British broadcasting, speakers of English origin almost universally used RP. The first director-general of the BBC, Lord Reith, encouraged the use of a 'BBC accent' because it was a \"style or quality of English which would not be laughed at in any part of the country\". He distinguished the BBC accent from the 'Oxford accent', to which he was \"vehemently opposed\". In 1926 the BBC established an Advisory Committee on Spoken English with distinguished experts, including Daniel Jones, to advise on the correct pronunciation and other aspects of broadcast language. The Committee proved unsuccessful and was dissolved after the Second World War. \nWhile the BBC did advise its speakers on pronunciation, there was never a formalised official BBC pronunciation standard. A notable departure from the use of RP came with the Yorkshire-born newsreader Wilfred Pickles during the Second World War; his accent allowing listeners to more clearly distinguish BBC broadcasts from German propaganda, though Pickles had modified his accent to be closer to RP.\nSince the Second World War RP has played a much smaller role in broadcast speech. RP remains the accent most often heard in the speech of announcers and newsreaders on BBC Radio 3 and Radio 4, and in some TV channels, but non-RP accents are now more widely encountered.\nDictionaries.\nMost English dictionaries published in Britain (including the Oxford English Dictionary) now give phonetically transcribed RP pronunciations for all words. Pronunciation dictionaries represent a special class of dictionary giving a wide range of possible pronunciations: British pronunciation dictionaries are all based on RP, though not necessarily using that name. Daniel Jones transcribed RP pronunciations of words and names in the English Pronouncing Dictionary. Cambridge University Press continues to publish this title, as of 1997 edited by Peter Roach. Two other pronunciation dictionaries are in common use: the \"Longman Pronunciation Dictionary\", compiled by John C. Wells (using the name \"Received Pronunciation\"), and Clive Upton's \"Oxford Dictionary of Pronunciation for Current English\", (now republished as \"The Routledge Dictionary of Pronunciation for Current English\").\nLanguage teaching.\nPronunciation forms an essential component of language learning and teaching; a \"model accent\" is necessary for learners to aim at, and to act as a basis for description in textbooks and classroom materials. RP has been the traditional choice for teachers and learners of British English. However, the choice of pronunciation model is difficult, and the adoption of RP is in many ways problematic.\nPhonology.\nConsonants.\nNasals and liquids (, , , , ) may be syllabic in unstressed syllables. The consonant in RP is generally a postalveolar approximant, which would normally be expressed with the sign in the International Phonetic Alphabet, but the sign is nonetheless traditionally used for RP in most of the literature on the topic.\nVoiceless plosives (, , , ) are aspirated at the beginning of a syllable, unless a completely unstressed vowel follows. (For example, the is aspirated in \"impasse\", with primary stress on \"-passe\", but not \"compass\", where \"-pass\" has no stress.) Aspiration does not occur when precedes in the same syllable, as in \"spot\" or \"stop\". When a sonorant , , , or follows, this aspiration is indicated by partial devoicing of the sonorant. is a fricative when devoiced.\nSyllable final , , , and may be either preceded by a glottal stop (glottal reinforcement) or, in the case of , fully replaced by a glottal stop, especially before a syllabic nasal (\"bitten\" ). The glottal stop may be realised as creaky voice; thus, an alternative phonetic transcription of \"attempt\" could be .\nAs in other varieties of English, voiced plosives (, , , ) are partly or even fully devoiced at utterance boundaries or adjacent to voiceless consonants. The voicing distinction between voiced and voiceless sounds is reinforced by a number of other differences, with the result that the two of consonants can clearly be distinguished even in the presence of devoicing of voiced sounds:\nAs a result, some authors prefer to use the terms \"fortis\" and \"lenis\" in place of \"voiceless\" and \"voiced\". However, the latter are traditional and in more frequent usage.\nThe voiced dental fricative () is more often a weak dental plosive; the sequence is often realised as (a long dental nasal). has velarised allophone () in the syllable rhyme. becomes voiced () between voiced sounds.\nVowels.\nExamples of short vowels: in \"kit\", \"mirror\" and \"rabbit\", in \"foot\" and \"cook\", in \"dress\" and \"merry\", in \"strut\" and \"curry\", in \"trap\" and \"marry\", in \"lot\" and orange\", in ago\" and \"sofa\".\nExamples of long vowels: in \"fleece\", in \"goose\", in \"bear\", in \"nurse\" and \"furry\", in \"north\", \"force\" and \"thought\", in \"father\" and \"start\".\nThe long mid front vowel is elsewhere transcribed with the traditional symbols \u27e8\u27e9. The predominant realisation in contemporary RP is monophthongal.\n\"Long\" and \"short\" vowels.\nMany conventional descriptions of the RP vowel system group the non-diphthongal vowels into the categories \"long\" and \"short\". This should not be taken to mean that RP has minimal pairs in which the only difference is vowel length. \"Long\" and \"short\" are convenient cover terms for a number of phonetic features. The long-short pairings shown above include also differences in vowel quality.\nThe vowels called \"long\" high vowels in RP and are slightly diphthongized, and are often narrowly transcribed in phonetic literature as diphthongs and . The starting point of the diphthongal can be either close to or a more centralised and even unrounded , and its narrow transcriptions could be either or .\nVowels may be phonologically long or short (i.e. belong to the long or the short group of vowel phonemes) but their length is influenced by their context: in particular, they are shortened if a voiceless (fortis) consonant follows in the syllable, so that, for example, the vowel in \"bat\" is shorter than the vowel in \"bad\" . The process is known as \"pre-fortis clipping\". Thus phonologically short vowels in one context can be phonetically \"longer\" than phonologically long vowels in another context. For example, the vowel called \"long\" in \"reach\" (which ends with a voiceless consonant) may be shorter than the vowel called \"short\" in the word \"ridge\" (which ends with a voiced consonant). Wiik, cited in , published durations of English vowels with a mean value of 172 ms for short vowels before voiced consonants but a mean value of 165\u00a0ms for long vowels preceding voiceless consonants.\nIn natural speech, the plosives and often have no audible release utterance-finally, and voiced consonants are partly or completely devoiced (as in ); thus the perceptual distinction between pairs of words such as \"bad\" and \"bat\", or \"seed\" and \"seat\" rests mostly on vowel length (though the presence or absence of glottal reinforcement provides an additional cue).\nUnstressed vowels are both shorter and more centralised than stressed ones. In unstressed syllables occurring before vowels and in final position, contrasts between long and short high vowels are neutralised and short and occur (e.g. \"happy\" , \"throughout\" ). The neutralisation is common throughout many English dialects, though the phonetic realisation of e.g. rather than (a phenomenon called \"happy\"-tensing) is not as universal.\nAccording to phonetician Jane Setter, the typical pronunciation of the short variant of is a weakly rounded near-close near-back rounded vowel .\nDiphthongs and triphthongs.\nThe centring diphthongs are gradually being eliminated in RP. The vowel (as in \"door\", \"boar\") had largely merged with by the Second World War, and the vowel (as in \"poor\", \"tour\") has more recently merged with as well among most speakers, although the sound is still found in conservative speakers, and in less common words such as \"boor\". See CURE\u2013FORCE merger. More recently has become a pure long vowel , as explained above. is increasingly pronounced as a monophthong , although without merging with any existing vowels.\nThe diphthong is pronounced by some RP speakers in a noticeably different way when it occurs before , if that consonant is syllable-final and not followed by a vowel (the context in which is pronounced as a \"dark l\"). The realisation of in this case begins with a more back, rounded and sometimes more open vowel quality; it may be transcribed as or . It is likely that the backness of the diphthong onset is the result of allophonic variation caused by the raising of the back of the tongue for the . If the speaker has \"l-vocalization\" the is realised as a back rounded vowel, which again is likely to cause backing and rounding in a preceding vowel as coarticulation effects. This phenomenon has been discussed in several blogs by John C. Wells. In the recording included in this article the phrase \"fold his cloak\" contains examples of the diphthong in the two different contexts. The onset of the pre- diphthong in \"fold\" is slightly more back and rounded than that in \"cloak\".\nRP also possesses the triphthongs as in \"tire\", as in \"tower\", as in \"lower\", as in \"layer\" and as in \"loyal\". There are different possible realisations of these items: in slow, careful speech they may be pronounced as two syllables with three distinct vowel qualities in succession, or as a monosyllabic triphthong. In more casual speech the middle vowel may be considerably reduced, by a process known as smoothing, and in an extreme form of this process the triphthong may even be reduced to a single long vowel. In such a case the difference between , , and in \"tower\", \"tire\", and \"tar\" may be neutralised with all three units realised as or . This type of smoothing is known as the \"tower\"\u2013\"tire\", \"tower\"\u2013\"tar\" and \"tire\"\u2013\"tar\" mergers.\nBATH vowel.\nThere are differing opinions as to whether in the lexical set can be considered RP. The pronunciations with are invariably accepted as RP. The \"English Pronouncing Dictionary\" does not admit in words and the \"Longman Pronunciation Dictionary\" lists them with a \u00a7 marker of non-RP status. John Wells wrote in a blog entry on 16 March 2012 that when growing up in the north of England he used in \"bath\" and \"glass\", and considers this the only acceptable phoneme in RP. Others have argued that is too categorical in the north of England to be excluded. Clive Upton believes that in these words must be considered within RP and has called the opposing view \"south-centric\". Upton's \"Oxford Dictionary of Pronunciation for Current English\" gives both variants for words. A. F. Gupta's survey of mostly middle-class students found that was used by almost everyone who was from clearly north of the isogloss for words. She wrote, \"There is no justification for the claims by Wells and Mugglestone that this is a sociolinguistic variable in the north, though it is a sociolinguistic variable on the areas on the border [the isogloss between north and south]\". In a study of speech in West Yorkshire, K. M. Petyt wrote that \"the amount of usage is too low to correlate meaningfully with the usual factors\", having found only two speakers (both having attended boarding schools in the south) who consistently used .\nJack Windsor Lewis has noted that the Oxford Dictionary's position has changed several times on whether to include short within its prescribed pronunciation. The \"BBC Pronouncing Dictionary of British Names\" uses only , but its author, Graham Pointon, has stated on his blog that he finds both variants to be acceptable in place names.\nSome research has concluded that many people in the North of England have a dislike of the vowel in words. A. F. Gupta wrote, \"Many of the northerners were noticeably hostile to , describing it as 'comical', 'snobbish', 'pompous' or even 'for morons'.\" On the subject, K. M. Petyt wrote that several respondents \"positively said that they did not prefer the long-vowel form or that they really detested it or even that it was incorrect\". Mark Newbrook has assigned this phenomenon the name \"conscious rejection\", and has cited the BATH vowel as \"the main instance of conscious rejection of RP\" in his research in West Wirral.\nFrench words.\nJohn Wells has argued that, as educated British speakers often attempt to pronounce French names in a French way, there is a case for including (as in ), and and (as in ), as marginal members of the RP vowel system. He also argues against including other French vowels on the grounds that not many British speakers succeed in distinguishing the vowels in and , or in and . However, the \"Cambridge English Pronouncing Dictionary\" draws a distinction between (there rendered as ) and the unrounded of for a total of four nasal vowels.\nAlternative notations.\nNot all reference sources use the same system of transcription. Clive Upton devised a modified system for the \"Shorter Oxford English Dictionary\" (1993) based on contemporary pronunciation. His changes to five symbols from the traditional Gimson system are now used in many other Oxford University Press dictionaries; the differences are shown in the table below.\nGeoff Lindsey, arguing that the system of transcription for RP has become outdated, has proposed a new system (which he calls Standard Southern British, or SSB) as a replacement. Lindsey's system is as follows\u2014differences between it and standard transcription are depicted with the traditional transcription in parentheses.\nHistorical variation.\nLike all accents, RP has changed with time. For example, sound recordings and films from the first half of the 20th century demonstrate that it was usual for speakers of RP to pronounce the sound, as in \"land\", with a vowel close to , so that \"land\" would sound similar to a present-day pronunciation of \"lend\". RP is sometimes known as \"the Queen's English\", but recordings show that even Queen Elizabeth II shifted her pronunciation over the course of her reign, ceasing to use an -like vowel in words like \"land\". The change in RP may be observed in the home of \"BBC English\". The BBC accent of the 1950s is distinctly different from today's: a news report from the 1950s is recognisable as such, and a mock-1950s BBC voice is used for comic effect in programmes wishing to satirise 1950s social attitudes such as the Harry Enfield Show and its \"Mr. Cholmondley-Warner\" sketches.\nA few illustrative examples of changes in RP during the 20th century and early 21st are given below. A more comprehensive list (using the name \"General British\" in place of \"RP\") is given in \"Gimson's Pronunciation of English\".\nWord-specific changes.\nA number of cases can be identified where changes in the pronunciation of individual words, or small groups of words, have taken place.\nSpoken specimen.\nThe \"Journal of the International Phonetic Association\" regularly publishes \"Illustrations of the IPA\" which present an outline of the phonetics of a particular language or accent. It is usual to base the description on a recording of the traditional story of the North Wind and the Sun. There is an IPA illustration of British English (Received Pronunciation).\nThe female speaker is described as having been born in 1953 and educated at Oxford University. To accompany the recording there are three transcriptions: orthographic, phonemic and allophonic.\nPhonemic\nAllophonic\nOrthographic\nThe North Wind and the Sun were disputing which was the stronger, when a traveller came along wrapped in a warm cloak. They agreed that the one who first succeeded in making the traveller take his cloak off should be considered stronger than the other. Then the North Wind blew as hard as he could, but the more he blew the more closely did the traveller fold his cloak around him, and at last the North Wind gave up the attempt. Then the Sun shone out warmly, and immediately the traveller took off his cloak. And so the North Wind was obliged to confess that the Sun was the stronger of the two.\nNotable speakers.\nThe following people have been described as RP speakers:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\nSources of regular comment on RP\nAudio files"}

As a teenager, he was briefly involved with the Globewide Network Academy. Lackey attended MIT and majored in Course 18 (mathematics), eventually dropping out due to financial constraints. While there, Lackey became interested in electronic cash and distributed systems, originally for massively multiplayer online gaming. This interest led to attending several conferences (Financial Cryptography 98, various MIT presentations), participating on mailing lists such as \"cypherpunks\" and \"dbs\", and, with Ian Goldberg, eventually implementing patented Chaumian digital cash in an underground library, HINDE, which was named after Hinde ten Berge, a Dutch cypherpunk also present at FC98. He contributed to the cypherpunks movement as one of the longest anonymous remailer operators.\nCareer.\nIn 1999 Lackey lived in the San Francisco Bay Area before moving to the self-proclaimed state of Sealand and establishing HavenCo.

{"id": "26253", "revid": "34444074", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26253", "title": "Revised Julian calendar", "text": "Calendar used by some Eastern Orthodox churches\nThe Revised Julian calendar, or less formally the new calendar and also known as the Milankovi\u0107 calendar, is a calendar proposed in 1923 by the Serbian scientist Milutin Milankovi\u0107 as a more accurate alternative to both Julian and Gregorian calendars. At the time, the Julian calendar was still in use by all of the Eastern Orthodox Church and affiliated nations, while the Catholic and Protestant nations were using the Gregorian calendar. Thus, Milankovi\u0107's aim was to discontinue the divergence between the naming of dates in Eastern and Western churches and nations. It was intended to replace the Julian calendar in Eastern Orthodox Churches and nations. From 1 March 1600 through 28 February 2800, the Revised Julian calendar aligns its dates with the Gregorian calendar, which had been proclaimed in 1582 by Pope Gregory XIII.\nThe Revised Julian calendar has been adopted for ecclesiastical use by the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople, the Orthodox Autocephalous Church of Albania, the Greek Orthodox Church of Alexandria, the Greek Orthodox Church of Antioch, the Bulgarian Orthodox Church, the Romanian Orthodox Church, the Cypriot Orthodox Church, the Church of Greece, the Orthodox Church of the Czech Lands and Slovakia, the Orthodox Church of Ukraine, the Orthodox Church in America. It has not been adopted by the Russian Orthodox Church, the Serbian Orthodox Church, the Macedonian Orthodox Church, the Georgian Orthodox Church, the Polish Orthodox Church and the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem. It has not been adopted by any nation as an official calendar. Instead, all of the Eastern Orthodox nations have adopted the Gregorian calendar as the official state calendar.\nThe Revised Julian calendar has the same months and month lengths as the Julian and Gregorian calendar, but, in the Revised Julian version, years evenly divisible by 100 are not leap years, except that years with remainders of 200 or 600 when divided by 900 remain leap years, e.g. 2000 and 2400 as in the Gregorian calendar.\nBackground.\nIn the history of Christianity, divisions on which calendar to use were initiated after 1582, when the Catholic Church transitioned from the ancient Julian calendar to the new Gregorian calendar.\nEventually, by the 18th century, the Gregorian Calendar was officially adopted even in Protestant countries as the civil calendar, but still faced some opposition from smaller groups. In the Kingdom of Great Britain, the Gregorian calendar was officially introduced in 1752.\nAround the same time, debates between those wanting to adopt the Gregorian Calendar and traditionalists wanting to keep the Julian calendar were also going on within several Eastern Catholic Churches. Those debates were focused mainly on ritual questions and ended in various compromises. The need for preservation of ritual differences, including various questions related to liturgical calendar, was consequently acknowledged by Rome.\nImplementation.\nComparison of Revised Julian and Gregoriancalendar century years. (In the original Juliancalendar, every century year is a leap year.)\nA committee composed of members of the Greek government and Greek Orthodox Church was set up to look into the question of calendar reform. It reported in January 1923. In the end, for civil purposes, the Gregorian calendar was adopted; the changeover went into effect on 16 February 1923/1 March 1923.\nAfter the promulgation of the royal decree, the Ecumenical Patriarch, Patriarch Meletius IV of Constantinople, issued an encyclical on 3 February recommending the calendar's adoption by Orthodox churches, which is why it is sometimes also known as the Meletian Calendar. The matter came up for discussion at the Council of Constantinople (1923), which deliberated in May and June. Subsequently, it was adopted by several of the autocephalous Orthodox churches. The synod was chaired by Meletius IV and representatives were present from the churches of Cyprus, Greece, Romania and Serbia. There were no representatives of the other members of the original Orthodox Pentarchy (the Patriarchates of Jerusalem, Antioch, and Alexandria) or from the largest Orthodox church, the Russian Orthodox Church.\nThe Serbian delegation presented a proposal by Maksim Trpkovi\u0107, which had a leap year rule in which century years would become common years, except those with remainders of 0 or 400 when divided by 900, which would remain leap years. However, it was rejected because the proposal would omit a leap year in 2000, which would cause it to differ from the Gregorian after only 77 years. Milankovi\u0107 proposed a small modification of Trpkovic's proposal, changing the timing of the century leap years to those with remainder 200 or 600 when divided by 900 in order to maximise the amount of time before it would differ from the Gregorian.\nMilankovi\u0107's arguments won the day. In its decision the conference noted that \"the difference between the length of the political year of the new calendar and the Gregorian is so small that only after 877 years it is observed difference of dates.\" The same decision provided that the coming 1 October should be called 14 October, thus dropping thirteen days. It then adopted the leap year rule of Milankovi\u0107. The proposed calendar was preferred over the Gregorian because its mean year was within two seconds of the then current length of the \"mean\" tropical year. The present \"vernal equinox\" year, however, is about 12 seconds longer, in terms of mean solar days.\nThe synod also proposed the adoption of an astronomical rule for Easter: Easter was to be the Sunday after the midnight-to-midnight day at the meridian of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem (35\u00b013\u203247.2\u2033\u00a0E or UT+2h20m55s for the small dome) during which the first full moon after the vernal equinox occurs. Although the instant of the full moon must occur after the instant of the vernal equinox, it may occur on the same day. If the full moon occurs on a Sunday, Easter is the following Sunday. Churches that adopted this calendar did so on varying dates. However, all Eastern Orthodox churches continue to use the Julian calendar to determine the date of Easter (except for the Finnish Orthodox Church, which now uses the Gregorian Easter; the Estonian Orthodox Church used the Gregorian Easter from 1923 to 1945).\nThere were attempts to introduce Revised Julian as a religious calendar in the Soviet Union. On 12 June 1923, it was accepted by the short-lived schismatic Renovationist Church, which had seized church buildings with the support of the Soviet government while Patriarch Tikhon was under house arrest. After his release, on 15 July 1923, he declared that all Renovationist decrees were without grace. On 15 October 1923, Patriarch Tikhon accepted the new calendar, but it caused disagreement among clergy, and 24 days later he reverted the decision. The present Russian Orthodox Church continues to use the Julian calendar for both its fixed festivals and for Easter.\nArithmetic.\nThe following are Gregorian minus Revised Julian date differences, calculated for the beginning of January and March in each century year, which is where differences arise or disappear, until AD 10000. These are exact arithmetic calculations, not depending on any astronomy. A negative difference means that the proleptic Revised Julian calendar was behind the proleptic Gregorian calendar. The Revised Julian calendar is the same as the Gregorian calendar from 1 March 1600 to 28 February 2800, but the following day would be 1 March 2800 (RJ) or 29 February 2800 (G); this difference is denoted as '+1' in the table. 2900 is a leap year in Revised Julian, but not Gregorian: 29 February 2900 (RJ) is the same as 28 February 2900 (G) and the next day will be 1 March 2900 in both calendars - hence the '0' notation.\nIn 900 Julian years there are &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;900\u20444 = 225 leap days. The Revised Julian leap rule omits seven of nine century leap years, leaving 225\u22127 = 218 leap days per 900-year cycle. Thus the calendar mean year is 365\u00a0+\u00a0&lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;218\u2044900 days, but this is actually a double-cycle that reduces to 365\u00a0+\u00a0&lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;109\u2044450 = 365.242 days, or exactly 365 days 5 hours 48 minutes 48 seconds, which is exactly 24 seconds shorter than the Gregorian mean year of 365.2425 days, so in the long term on \"average\" the Revised Julian calendar pulls ahead of the Gregorian calendar by one day in 3600 years.\nThe number of days per Revised Julian cycle = 900 \u00d7 365 + 218 = 328,718 days. Taking mod 7 leaves a remainder of 5, so like the Julian calendar, but unlike the Gregorian calendar, the Revised Julian calendar cycle does not contain a whole number of weeks. Therefore, a full repetition of the Revised Julian leap cycle with respect to the seven-day weekly cycle is seven times the cycle length = 7 \u00d7 900 = 6300 years.\nMarch equinox.\nThe following is a scatter plot of actual astronomical northward equinox moments as numerically integrated by SOLEX 11 using DE421 mode with extended (80-bit) floating point precision, high integration order (18th order), and forced solar mass loss (\"forced\" means taken into account at all times). SOLEX can automatically search for northern hemisphere spring equinox moments by finding when the solar declination crosses the celestial equator northward, and then it outputs that data as the Terrestrial Time day and fraction of day relative to 1 January 2000 at noon (J2000.0 epoch). The progressive tidal slowing of the Earth rotation rate was accounted for by subtracting \u0394\"T\" as calculated by the Espenak-Meeus polynomial set recommended at the NASA Eclipses web site to obtain the J2000.0-relative Universal Time moments, which were then properly converted to Revised Julian dates and Jerusalem local apparent time, taking local apparent midnight as the beginning of each calendar day. The year range of the chart was limited to dates before the year AD 4400: by then \u0394\"T\" is expected to accumulate to about six hours, with an uncertainty of less than &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;2+1\u20442 hours.\nThe chart shows that the long-term equinox drift of the Revised Julian calendar is quite satisfactory, at least until AD 4400. The medium-term wobble spans about two days because, like the Gregorian calendar, the leap years of the Revised Julian calendar are not smoothly spread: they occur mostly at intervals of four years but there are occasional eight-year gaps (at 7 out of 9 century years). Evidently each of the authorities responsible for the Gregorian and Revised Julian calendars, respectively, accepted a modest amount of medium-term equinox wobble for the sake of traditionally perceived leap rule mental arithmetic simplicity. Therefore, the wobble is essentially a curiosity that is of no practical or ritual concern.\nAdoption.\nIn 1923, the Revised Julian calendar was devised. Since then, several Eastern Orthodox Churches have introduced partial changes into their liturgical calendars. Those changes were based on the application of the Revised Julian calendar for the liturgical celebration of immovable feasts (including Christmas), thus reducing the use of the old Julian calendar to liturgical celebration of moveable feasts (feasts of the Easter cycle).\nThe new calendar has been adopted by Orthodox churches as follows:\nAs of 2025, the Revised Julian Calendar has been adopted by 11 Churches, known as the New Calendarists:\nThe new calendar has not been adopted by the Old Calendarists and by the following Churches:\nIn Eastern Orthodoxy, issues related to calendar reform did not produce break of communion or schisms between the mainstream churches, but they did cause disputes and internal schisms within some churches. The result of those conflicts was the emergence of the Old Calendarist movement, and consequent creation of separate churches, thus breaking the communion with those mother churches that accepted the calendar reform.\nDefense.\nThe basic justification for the new calendar is the known errors of the Julian calendar, which will in the course of time lead to a situation in which those following the Julian calendar (in the Northern Hemisphere) will be reckoning the month of December (and the feast of Christ's Nativity) during the heat of summer, August and its feasts during the deep cold of winter, Easter during the autumn season, and the November feasts in the springtime. This would conflict with the Church's historic practice of celebrating Christ's birth on 25 December, a date chosen for a number of reasons. One of the reasons mentioned by Bennet is the time of the winter solstice, when the days begin to lengthen again as the physical sun makes its reappearance, along with the fact that Christ has traditionally been recognized by Christians as the metaphorical and spiritual sun who fulfills Malachi's prophetic words: \"the sun of righteousness will shine with healing in its wings\" (Malachi 4:2). The identification, based on this prophecy, of Jesus Christ as the \"sun of righteousness\" is found many times in writings of the early Church fathers and follows from many New Testament references linking Jesus with imagery of sun and light.\nCriticism.\nCritics see the change in calendar as an unwarranted innovation, influenced by Western society. They say that no sound theological reason has been given for changing the calendar, that the only reasons advanced are social. The proposal for change was introduced by Meletios Metaxakis, Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople, a patriarch whose canonical status has been disputed.\nThe argument is also made that since the use of the Julian calendar was implicit in the decision of the First Ecumenical Council at Nicaea (325), which standardized the calculation of the date of Easter, no authority less than an Ecumenical Council may change it. It is further argued that the adoption of the new calendar in some countries and not in others has broken the liturgical unity of the Eastern Orthodox churches, undoing the decision made by the council of bishops at Nicaea to decree that all local churches celebrate Easter on the same day. The emperor Constantine, writing to the bishops absent from the council to notify them of the decision, argued, \"Think, then, how unseemly it is, that on the same day some should be fasting whilst others are seated at a banquet\".\nFrom a spiritual perspective, Old Calendarists also point to a number of miraculous occurrences that occur on the old calendar exclusively, such as the \"descent of the cloud on the mount\" on the feast of the Transfiguration. After the calendar change was instituted, the followers of the old calendar in Greece apparently witnessed the appearance of a cross in the sky, visible to thousands on the feast of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross, 1925, of which eyewitness accounts were recorded.\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

These proposals include setting a fixed date or agreeing between Eastern and Western Christendom a common basis for calculating the date of Easter so that all Christians celebrate the Festival on the same day. As of 2025, no such agreement has been reached.\nThe term may also refer to historic reforms of the Computus, such as the adoption of the epact tables by Dionysius Exiguus in the 6th century and by Bede in the 8th century.\nDescription.\nA reform of the date of Easter has been proposed several times because the current system for determining the date of Easter is seen as presenting two significant problems:\nThere have been controversies about the \"correct\" date of Easter since antiquity, but most Christian churches today agree on certain points. The Roman Catholic Church explains:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The Council of Nicaea in 325 determined, among other things, that the Church would no longer follow the Jewish calendar and that Easter was to be celebrated on a common day throughout the world. (\u2026)\nThe council did not say what that day was to be but at the time Easter was celebrated on a Sunday virtually everywhere.\nTo justify his calendar reform, which involved removing ten days, in 1582 Pope Gregory XIII claimed that the council had decreed that Easter should be celebrated:\nThere is less agreement whether Easter also should occur:\nThe disagreements have been particularly about the determination of moon phases and the equinox, some preferring astronomical observation from a certain location (usually Jerusalem, Alexandria, Rome or local), most others following nominal approximations of these in either the Hebrew, Julian or Gregorian calendar using different lookup tables and cycles in their algorithms. Deviations may also result from different customs for the start of the \"day\", i.e. dusk, sunset, midnight, dawn or sunrise. Furthermore, it may be accepted to have the respective starts of the astronomical season, the full moon and the Sunday occur on the same date as long as they are observed in that order.\nFixed date.\nIt has been proposed that the first problem could be resolved by making Easter occur on a date fixed relative to the western Gregorian calendar every year, or alternatively on a Sunday within a fixed range of seven or eight dates. While tying Easter to one fixed date would serve to underline the belief that it commemorates an actual historical event, without an accompanying calendar reform that changes the pattern of the days of the week (itself a subject of religious controversy) or adopts a leap week, it would also break the tradition of Easter always being on a Sunday, established since the 2nd century and by now deeply embedded in the liturgical practice and theological understanding of almost all Christian denominations.\nThe Second Vatican Council agreed in 1963 to accept a fixed Sunday in the Gregorian calendar as the date for Easter as long as other Christian churches agreed on it as well. They also agreed in principle to adopt a civil calendar reform as long as there were never any days outside the cycle of seven days per week.\nIn 1977, some Eastern Orthodox representatives objected to separating the date of Easter from lunar phases.\nThe Montanists, a 5th-century sect, celebrated Easter on the Sunday following April 6 (in the Julian calendar). This is equivalent to the Sunday closest to April 9. The April 6 date was apparently chosen because it was equivalent to the 14th day of Artemisios in an earlier local calendar, hence, the 14th of the first month of spring.\nThe two most widespread proposals for fixing the date of Easter would set it on either the second Sunday in April (8 to 14, week 14 or 15), or the Sunday after the second Saturday in April (9 to 15). They only differ in years with dominical letter G or AG where 1 April is a Sunday. In both schemes, account has been taken of the fact that\u2014in spite of the many difficulties in establishing the dates of the historical events involved\u2014many scholars attribute a high degree of probability to Friday 7 April 30, as the date of the crucifixion of Jesus, which would make 9 April the date of the Resurrection. Another date which is supported by many scholars is 3 April 33, making 5 April the date of the Resurrection.\nIn the late 1920s and 1930s, this idea gained some momentum along with other calendar reform proposals, such as the International Fixed Calendar (IFC) and the World Calendar. In 1928, a law was passed in the United Kingdom authorising an Order in Council which would fix the nationwide date of Easter on the Sunday after the second Saturday in April. However, this was never implemented, but remains popular at least within the Church of England. In a 2001 article for the WCC, Dagmar Heller, who was the only woman to participate in the 1997 Aleppo Conference, states that Western churches previously preferred a \"third option\", i.e. a fixed Sunday in April, but tried to accommodate Eastern churches by giving this up.\nThe Sunday of an ordinal ISO week \"n\" is also the \"n\"th Sunday of the year, except in A/AG, B/BA and C/CB years where it is the \"n\"+1st Sunday. Therefore, both major proposals put Easter on the 15th Sunday of the year. The exception to this is either in common years starting on Monday (G), where 8 April, i.e. the second Sunday in April, is the 14th Sunday of the year, or in leap years starting on Sunday (AG), where 15 April, i.e. the Sunday after the second Saturday in April, is the 16th Sunday of the year. That means, the Saturday-based rule approximates the 15th Sunday better.\nThe Sunday after the first Wednesday in April would always be in ISO week W14, except for leap years starting on Thursday (DC) where the week count is one higher than in otherwise equivalent common years after February. The Symmetry454 Calendar proposes a fixed date of Easter in week 14, which would agree with the aforementioned proposals in most years, but would be 1 week earlier in F/GF years (like the only deviation of the Montanist definition) and also in DC, D/ED and E/FE years.\nThe first possible Gregorian date for Easter, 22 March, is also one of the dates with (almost) fixed ISO week number, i.e. W12, which is usually also the week of the equinox a day or two earlier. If the 52 weeks of a usual year are grouped into 13 nominal lunation phases of 4 weeks each (similar to IFC), then the equinox week concludes the third of these months and the next nominal full moon in the middle of the month would occur on Sunday of W14, making it the fixed date for Passover. Easter Sunday would follow seven days later, in W15, which is between 11 and 18 April.\nSince Candlemas, which traditionally concludes Christmastide, is always on 2 February, it is almost always in W05 (with the exception of W06 if on a Monday), a W15 Easter would ensure the three pre-Lenten Sundays, i.e. Septuagesima, Sexagesima and Quinquagesima, existed in all years, and not more than these.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Legend/styles.css\" /&gt;\u00a0\u00a0major proposals around 15th Sunday\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Legend/styles.css\" /&gt;\u00a0\u00a0deviations of the 2 major proposals\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Legend/styles.css\" /&gt;\u00a0\u00a0week-based proposals\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Legend/styles.css\" /&gt;\u00a0\u00a0clashes with other holidays, to be avoided\nUnified date.\nProposals to resolve the second problem have made greater progress, but they are yet to be adopted.\n1923 proposal.\nAn astronomical rule for Easter was proposed by the 1923 Pan-Orthodox Congress of Constantinople that also proposed the Revised Julian calendar: Easter was to be the Sunday after the midnight-to-midnight day at the meridian of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem (35\u00b0\u200913\u2032\u200947.2\u2033\u2009E or UT\u2009+\u20092h\u200920m\u200955s for the small dome over the Greek quire) during which the first full moon after the vernal equinox occurs.\nAlthough the instant of the full moon must occur after the instant of the vernal equinox, it may occur on the same day. If the full moon occurs on a Sunday, Easter is the following Sunday. This proposed astronomical rule was rejected by all Orthodox churches, and was never considered by any Western church.\n1997 proposal.\nThe World Council of Churches (WCC) proposed a reform of the method of determining the date of Easter at a summit in Aleppo, Syria, in 1997: Easter would be defined as the first Sunday following the first astronomical full moon following the astronomical vernal equinox, as determined from the meridian of Jerusalem. The reform would have been implemented starting in 2001, since in that year the Eastern and Western dates of Easter would coincide.\nThis reform has not been implemented. It would have relied mainly on the co-operation of the Eastern Orthodox Church, since the date of Easter would change for them immediately; whereas for the Western churches, the new system would not differ from that currently in use until 2019. However, Eastern Orthodox support was not forthcoming, and the reform failed. The much greater impact that this reform would have had on the Eastern churches in comparison with those of the West led some Orthodox to suspect that the WCC's decision was an attempt by the West to impose its viewpoint unilaterally on the rest of the world under the guise of ecumenism. However, it could also be argued that it is fair to ask a significant change of Eastern Christians, as they would be simply making the same substantial changes the various Western Churches have already made in 1582 (when the Catholic Church first adopted the Gregorian calendar) and subsequent years so as to bring the calendar and Easter more in line with the seasons.\n2008\u20132009 proposals.\nIn 2008 and 2009, there was a new attempt to reach a consensus on a unified date on the part of Catholic, Orthodox and Protestant leaders. This effort largely relies on earlier work carried out during the 1997 Aleppo conference. It was organized by academics working at the Institute of Ecumenical Studies of Lviv University.\nPart of this attempt was reportedly influenced by ecumenical efforts in Syria and Lebanon, where the Greek-Melkite Church has played an important role in improving ties with the Orthodox. There is also a series of apparition phenomena known as Our Lady of Soufanieh that has urged for a common date of Easter.\n2014\u2013present proposals.\nIn May\u00a02015, on the anniversary of the meeting between him and Pope Francis, Coptic Pope Tawadros II wrote a letter to Pope Francis asking for him to consider renewing effort at a unified date for Easter.\nIn response, on 12\u00a0June 2015, Catholic Pope Francis remarked to the International Catholic Charismatic Renewal Services 3rd World Retreat of Priests at the Basilica of Saint John Lateran in Rome that \"we have to come to an agreement\" for a common date on Easter. Lucetta Scaraffia, a historian, writing in the Vatican daily newspaper \"L'Osservatore Romano\", said the Pope offered this initiative to change the date of Easter \"as a gift of unity with the other Christian churches\" adding that a common date for Easter would encourage \"reconciliation between the Christian churches and ... a sort of making sense out of the calendar\". A week later Aphrem II, the Syriac Orthodox Patriarch of Antioch, met with Pope Francis and noted that the celebration of Easter \"on two different dates is a source of great discomfort and weakens the common witness of the church in the world.\"\nIn January\u00a02016, the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, announced that he on behalf of the Anglican Communion had joined discussions with Catholic, Coptic, and Orthodox representatives over a fixed date for Easter, and that he hoped it would happen within the next 5\u201310\u00a0years. Welby suggested that Easter be fixed on either the second or third Sunday of April, relative to the Gregorian calendar. This proposal remains to be approved, especially by Eastern churches, which currently determine Easter using the Julian calendar.\nStatements in 2021 and 2025 by the Vatican and Orthodox churches state the goal to achieve consensus by 2025, just in time for the 1700th anniversary of the Council of Nicaea, but without publishing any specific plans or who would adopt which changes. The Faith and Order Commission of the World Council of Churches has arranged conferences to mark the event.\nOn November 10, 2022, Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew of Constantinople stated that both the Orthodox and Catholic sides have a good intention to finally establish a common date for the celebration of Easter before the celebration of the 1700th anniversary of the First Council of Nicaea, which took place in 325; however, it was too early to talk about details. In 2024 he again called on \"Western and Eastern Christians to celebrate Easter on the same date, starting from 2025\".\nAccording to international standards, Easter Sunday ends the week containing Good Friday and the week of the second Sunday in April has the ordinal number 14 or 15\u00a0(dominical letters D/DC, E/ED, F/FE and GF, i.e. 46.25% of years), hence the third Sunday is one respective week later. There currently is no public proposal under discussion that used a fixed week of the year for Easter and dependent feasts. The second Sunday in April is usually the 15th\u00a0Sunday of the year (except for dominical letter G, 10.75%), which is almost always also the Sunday after the second Saturday in April (except for dominical letter AG, 3.75%).\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was educated at Winchester College and became a scholar of New College, Oxford in 1729. Lowth obtained his BA in 1733 and his Master of Arts degree in 1737. In 1735, while still at Oxford, Lowth took orders in the Anglican Church and was appointed vicar of Ovington, Hampshire, a position he retained until 1741, when he was appointed Oxford Professor of Poetry.\nBishop Lowth made a translation of the Book of Isaiah, first published in 1778. The Seventh-day Adventist theologian E. J. Waggoner said in 1899 that Lowth's translation of Isaiah was \"without doubt, as a whole, the best English translation of the prophecy of Isaiah\".\nIn 1750 he was appointed Archdeacon of Winchester. In 1752 he resigned the professorship at Oxford and married Mary Jackson. Shortly afterwards, in 1753, Lowth was appointed rector of East Woodhay. In 1754 he was awarded a Doctorate in Divinity by Oxford University, for his treatise on Hebrew poetry entitled \"Praelectiones Academicae de Sacra Poesi Hebraeorum\" (\"On the Sacred Poetry of the Hebrews\"). This derives from a series of lectures and was originally published in Latin. An English translation was published by George Gregory in 1787 as \"Lectures on the Sacred Poetry of the Hebrews\". This and subsequent editions include the life of Bishop Lowth as a preface. There was a further edition issued in 1815. This was republished in North America in 1829 with some additional notes. However, apart from those notes, the 1829 edition is less useful to a modern reader. This is because the editor of that edition chose to revert to citing many of the scriptural passages that Lowth uses as examples, and some of the annotations by Michaelis) and others, in Latin.\nLowth was appointed a fellow of the Royal Societies of London and G\u00f6ttingen in 1765. He was consecrated bishop of St\u00a0Davids in Wales in 1766; however, before the end of the year he was translated to the English see of Oxford. He remained Bishop of Oxford until 1777 when he was appointed Bishop of London as well as dean of the chapel royal and privy councillor. In 1783 he was offered the chance to become Archbishop of Canterbury, but declined due to failing health.\nLowth was good friends with the Scottish Enlightenment figure David Hume, as noted by the prominent Scottish bookseller Andrew Millar. Millar commented that \"Hume and he are very great, tho' one orthodox and ye other Hedretox\".\nLowth wrote a Latin epitaph, \"Cara, Vale\" (\"Dear one, farewell!\") on the death of his daughter Maria. Much admired in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, it was set to music by the English composer John Wall Callcott.\nLowth died in 1787, and was buried in the churchyard of All Saints Church, Fulham. Lowth's library was sold by auction by R. H. Evans on 15 January 1823 and five following days, along with the books of his son (also Robert, Rector of Hinton Ampnor, d. 1822). There is a copy of the catalogue at Cambridge University Library (shelfmark Munby.c.126(1)).\nOld Testament scholarship.\nLowth seems to have been the first modern Bible scholar to notice or draw attention to the poetic structure of the Psalms and much of the prophetic literature of the Old Testament. In Lecture 19 he sets out the classic statement of parallelism, which remains the most fundamental category for understanding Hebrew poetry. He identifies three forms of parallelism, the synonymous, antithetic and synthetic (i.e., balance only in the manner of expression without either synonymy or antithesis). This idea has been influential in Old Testament Studies to the present day.\nWork on English grammar.\nLowth is also remembered for his publication in 1762 of \"A Short Introduction to English Grammar\". Prompted by the absence of simple and pedagogical grammar textbooks in his day, Lowth set out to remedy the situation. Lowth's grammar is the source of many of the prescriptive shibboleths that are studied in schools, and established him as the first of a long line of usage commentators who judge the English language in addition to describing it. An example of both is one of his footnotes: \"\"Whose\" is by some authors made the possessive case of \"which\", and applied to things as well as persons; I think, improperly.\"\nHis most famous contribution to the study of grammar may have been his tentative suggestion that sentences ending with a preposition\u2014such as \"what did you ask for?\"\u2014are inappropriate in formal writing. (This is known as preposition stranding.) In what may have been intentional self-reference, Lowth used that very construction in discussing it. \"This is an Idiom which our language is strongly inclined to; it prevails in common conversation, and suits very well with the familiar style in writing; but the placing of the Preposition before the Relative is more graceful, as well as more perspicuous; and agrees much better with the solemn and elevated Style.\"2 Others had previously expressed this opinion; the earliest known is John Dryden in 1672.\nLowth's method included criticising \"false syntax\"; his examples of false syntax were culled from Shakespeare, the King James Bible, John Donne, John Milton, Jonathan Swift, Alexander Pope, and other famous writers. His understanding of grammar, like that of all linguists of his period, was influenced by the study of Latin, though he was aware that this was problematic and condemned \"forcing the English under the rules of a foreign Language\"1. Thus Lowth condemns Addison's sentence \"Who should I meet the other night, but my old friend?\" on the grounds that the thing acted upon should be in the \"Objective Case\" (corresponding, as he says earlier, to an oblique case in Latin), rather than taking this example and others as evidence from noted writers that \"who\" can refer to direct objects.\nLowth's dogmatic assertions appealed to those who wished for certainty and authority in their language. Lowth's grammar was not written for children; however, within a decade after it appeared, versions of it adapted for the use of schools had appeared, and Lowth's stylistic opinions acquired the force of law in the schoolroom. The textbook remained in standard usage throughout educational institutions until the early 20th century.\nLiterary critic.\nLowth has been regarded as the first imagery critic of Shakespeare's plays and highlighted the importance of the imagery in the interpretation of motives and actions of characters and dramatic movement of the plot and narrative structure.3"}

He was born in 1907 as Robin William Askin, but always disliked his first name and changed it by deed poll in 1971. Before being knighted in 1972, however, he was generally known as Bob Askin. Born in Sydney in 1907, Askin was educated at Sydney Technical High School. After serving as a bank officer and as a sergeant in the Second World War, Askin joined the Liberal Party and was elected to the seat of Collaroy at the 1950 election.\nAskin quickly rose through party ranks, eventually becoming deputy leader following Walter Howarth's resignation in July 1954. When long-serving party leader Vernon Treatt announced his resignation in August 1954, Askin put his name forward to replace him. At the vote, he became deadlocked against Pat Morton and Askin asked his former commanding officer Murray Robson to take the leadership instead. Robson did not live up to expectations and was deposed in September 1955 by Morton, who then became leader. Askin remained as deputy until, after leading the party to a second electoral defeat in 1959, Morton was deposed and Askin was elected to succeed him. At the May 1965 election, Askin presented the Liberal Party as a viable alternative government. He won a narrow victory, ending a 24-year Labor hold on government.\nAskin's time in office was marked by a significant increase in public works programs, strong opposition to an increase in Commonwealth powers, laissez-faire economic policies and wide-ranging reforms in laws and regulations such as the Law Reform Commission, the introduction of consumer laws, legal aid, breath-testing of drivers, the liberalisation of liquor laws and the restoration of postal voting in NSW elections. More controversial changes included the 1967 abolition of Sydney City Council and increased rates of development in Sydney, often at the expense of architectural heritage and historic buildings. This culminated in the 'Green ban' movement of the 1970s led by the union movement to conserve the heritage of Sydney.\nAt the end of his term, after winning another three elections, Askin was the second longest serving Premier of New South Wales (after Henry Parkes) and served the longest contiguous term of any premier. This record has since been overtaken by Neville Wran and Bob Carr. Askin remains the longest-serving Leader of the New South Wales Liberal Party. Since his death in 1981, however, Askin's legacy has been tarnished by persistent allegations that he was involved in organised crime and official corruption.\nEarly years.\nRobin William Askin was born in Sydney, New South Wales on 4 April 1907, at the Crown Street Women's Hospital, the eldest of three sons of Ellen Laura Halliday (n\u00e9e Rowe) and William James Askin, an Adelaide-born sailor and worker for New South Wales Railways. His parents later married on 29 September 1916. Askin spent his early years in Stuart Town before his family moved to Glebe, a working-class inner-city suburb of Sydney. After primary education at Glebe Public School, Askin was awarded a bursary to study at Sydney Technical High School, where he sat in the same class as the future aviator Charles Kingsford Smith. At school he gained good marks, with a particular interest in Mathematics and History, and enjoyed swimming and Rugby League. He completed his Intermediate Certificate in 1921.\nAt the age of 15, after a short time in the electrical trade, in 1922 Askin joined the Government Savings Bank of New South Wales as a Clerk. However, when the Savings Bank closed due to the Great Depression in 1931, he joined the Rural Bank of New South Wales. Between 1925 and 1929 Askin served part-time as a lieutenant in the 55th Battalion, Citizens Military Forces. On 5 February 1937 Askin married Mollie Isabelle Underhill, a typist at the bank, at Gilbert Park Methodist Church, Manly. They lived in Manly for the rest of their lives. He began his interest in politics by assisting in Percy Spender's successful campaign for Askin's local seat of Warringah as an Independent candidate at the 1937 Federal election. In 1940 Askin was appointed manager of the bank service department, which focused on public relations. He served as vice-president from 1939 to 1940 and president from 1940 to 1941 of the Rural Bank branch of the United Bank Officers' Association.\nAskin enlisted as a private in the Second Australian Imperial Force on 30 March 1942. An instructor with the 14th Infantry Training Battalion at Dubbo, he was appointed acting corporal, then reverted to private. In November 1942 he joined the 2/31st Infantry Battalion in New Guinea, where he served for two months. He was in New Guinea for another six months from July 1943. Landing at Balikpapan, Borneo, in July 1945, Askin was promoted to sergeant under Lieutenant Colonel Murray Robson. When hostilities ceased, he unsuccessfully attempted to set up an import business in Bandjermasin. Returning to Australia in February 1946, he was demobilised on 22 March.\nEarly political career.\nUpon demobilisation, Askin returned to work at the Rural Bank, managing its travel department. However, his interest in politics arose again when he assisted his former commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Robson, in retaining his seat of Vaucluse at the 1947 state election for the newly formed Liberal Party, which Askin then joined. Rapidly rising through the party ranks, Askin soon became President of the Liberals' Manly branch and supported Bill Wentworth's successful bid for the new seat of Mackellar at the 1949 election.\nAskin gained preselection for and won the newly created seat of Collaroy, located in the Northern Beaches, at the 17 June 1950 election, gaining 63.69% of the vote. The leader of the Liberal Party since 1946, Vernon Treatt led the Liberal/Country Coalition at the election, which resulted in a hung parliament, with Treatt's Coalition gaining 12 seats and a swing of 6.7% for a total of 46 seats. With the Labor Party also holding 46 seats, the balance of power lay with the two re-elected Independent Labor member, James Geraghty and John Seiffert, who had been expelled from the party for disloyalty during the previous parliament. Under a legalistic interpretation of the ALP rules, Seiffert was readmitted to the party and, together with the support of Geraghty, Premier James McGirr and Labor were able to stay in power. As the new local member for a constituency covering most of the Northern Beaches from North Manly to Pittwater, Askin protested against the lack of government development and services in the area, such as sewerage, education, and transport.\nLabor's near-defeat weakened McGirr's position and he was replaced as premier by Joseph Cahill in April 1952. Cahill had won popular support as a vigorous and impressive minister who had resolved problems with New South Wales' electricity supply and in his first 10 months as premier had reinvigorated the party. He appeared decisive and brought order to the government's chaotic public works program. In addition, he attacked the increasingly unpopular federal Coalition government of Robert Menzies. All this contributed to Treatt's Coalition being defeated at the 14 February 1953 election, with a total loss of ten seats and a swing against them of 7.2%. Askin retained his seat with 63.35%.\nDeputy Leader.\nWith confidence in his leadership demolished, Treatt's Liberal Party descended into factional in-fighting culminating in the resignation of Deputy Leader Walter Howarth on 22 July 1954, who publicly announced it on 4 July citing that he felt that Treatt doubted his loyalty. He was replaced by now-Party Whip Askin. The resignation split the party and sparked a leadership challenge from Pat Morton. At the party meeting on 6 July, Treatt narrowly defeated Morton with 12 votes to 10. With party support eroded, Treatt did not remain long as leader afterwards. On Friday 6 August 1954, Treatt announced that he would resign as leader. At the following party meeting, after a deadlocked vote between Askin and Morton, Askin asked his friend Murray Robson to nominate and subsequently he was elected to succeed Treatt.\nLike other senior members of the party, after having no conservative government since Alexander Mair in 1941, Robson had no experience in government, had little interest in policy and alienated many party members by trying to forge a closer alliance with Michael Bruxner's Country Party. Over a year after Robson assumed the leadership, at a party meeting on 20 September 1955, senior party member Ken McCaw moved that the leadership be declared vacant, citing that Robson's leadership lacked the qualities necessary for winning the next election. The motion was carried 15 votes to 5. Morton was then elected unopposed as leader, with Askin remaining as deputy leader.\nMorton then led the party to defeat at the election on 3 March 1956. The Coalition gained six seats, reducing the government's majority from twenty to six. Askin retained Collaroy with 70.14%. Morton again led the opposition to the ballot at the 21 March 1959 election, which resulted in an overall gain of three seats but the loss of two seats to Labor. After counting was finalised the Cahill Government was left with an overall majority of four seats. Askin retained his seat with 71.09%.\nLeader of the Opposition.\nMorton's refusal to give up his many business interests while as leader led many to accuse him of being a 'part-time leader' and together with his second election loss, eroded confidence in his leadership. On 14 July 1959, three Liberal MLAs called on Morton to resign, stating that the party needed a full-time leader and that Morton no longer commanded the majority support of his colleagues. Morton refused and instead called an emergency meeting on 17 July to confirm his leadership.\nBy this time, Askin had emerged as one of the main opponents to his longtime friend and former commander. However, he and the other major challenger to Morton's leadership, Eric Willis declared that they would only take the leadership if they were given an absolute majority of 28 votes. At the party meeting, a spill motion to remove Morton as leader carried by two votes. Willis then surprised many by deciding not to put his name forward for nomination, leaving Askin to take the leadership unopposed. Willis was eventually elected as deputy leader. Upon election, Askin declared that \"One of my main tasks will be to sell our [Liberal Party] ideas and principles to the working man.\"\nWhen Premier Cahill died on 22 October 1959, he was replaced by Askin's friend and parliamentary contemporary, Robert \"Bob\" Heffron, which tended to calm his aggression and opposition towards the government. At the March 1962 election, Labor had been in power for 21 years and Heffron had since been Premier for 2 and a half years. Heffron was 72 at the time of the election and his age and the longevity of the government were made issues by the Askin's opposition which described it as being composed of \"tired old men\". The standing of Heffron's government suffered when the electors rejected its proposal to abolish the New South Wales Legislative Council at a referendum in April 1961, being the first time Labor had lost a state electoral poll in 20 years. Askin's successful opposition campaign centred on warning of a Labor-dominated single house subject to \"Communist and Trades Hall influence\".\nLabor's policies for the election included the establishment of a Department of Industrial Development to reduce unemployment, free school travel, aid to home buyers and commencing the construction of the Sydney\u2013Newcastle Freeway as a toll-road. By contrast, Askin put forward a wide-ranging program of reform and addressed contentious issues including the introduction of State Aid for private schools, making rent control fairer and the legalisation of off-course betting on horse races. Askin accused the state government of allowing the transport infrastructure of the state to decline and promised to build the Newcastle freeway without a toll, to construct the Eastern Suburbs Railway and to plan for a second crossing of Sydney Harbour. Askin also made promises for more resources in mental health and district hospitals.\nDespite these promises, Askin and the new Country Party Leader, Charles Cutler, lost the election to Heffron, mainly due to the adverse reactions of voters towards the November 1960 \"horror budget\" and credit squeeze made by the federal Coalition government under Menzies. The Coalition lost five seats, despite a small swing of 0.16% and the Coalition gaining the support of prominent media businessman, Frank Packer, who helped project the image of Askin and the Liberals as a viable alternative government. Askin retained his seat with 72.53%.\nThe 1965 campaign against the Labor Government\u2014led since April 1964 by Jack Renshaw\u2014a government widely perceived to be tired and devoid of ideas, was notable for being one of Australia's first \"presidential-style\" campaigns, with Askin being the major focus of campaigning and a main theme of \"With Askin You'll Get Action\".\nHe received vigorous support from the newspapers and TV stations owned by Packer. At the May 1965 election, the Liberal/Country Coalition gained 49.8% of the vote to 43.3% to the ALP. While the Liberals took only two seats from Labor, Askin got the support of the two independent members, Douglas Darby (Manly) and Harold Coates (Hartley), giving him enough support to end Labor's 24-year run in power. He officially took office on 1 May, with Charles Cutler of the Country Party as deputy premier.\nPremier of New South Wales.\nThe Askin Government was sworn in by the governor of New South Wales, Sir Eric Woodward, on 13 May 1965 at Government House. It was the first to be headed by the Liberal Party since the main non-Labor party in the state adopted the Liberal banner; being one of only three Liberals to win power from Labor. Askin, who served as his own treasurer, heavily involved himself in the business of Government, while also maintaining a range of social agendas and regular outings to the racetrack or Rugby League games. One of the privileges of office was the access to a Ministerial car and personal driver, which became particularly important for Askin, who did not drive. On one occasion when Askin was supposed to drive a new Holden from the factory assembly line during a visit, Askin arranged for his driver, Russ Ferguson, to be hidden on the car floor working the controls while Askin held the wheel.\nAskin's government was marked by strong opposition to an increase in Commonwealth powers, a tough stance on \"law and order\" issues, laissez-faire economic policies, and aggressive support for industrial and commercial development. At his first Cabinet meeting, Askin restored direct air services between Sydney and Dubbo, and required J\u00f8rn Utzon, the Danish architect then working on the Sydney Opera House, to provide a final price and completion date for the Opera House, which had gone past the original estimates for both. His Public Works Minister Davis Hughes began to assert control over the project and demanded that costs be reined in. This brought him into direct conflict with Utzon and in February 1966, after a bitter standoff and the suspension of progress payments by Hughes, Utzon resigned, sparking a major public outcry. Two weeks after the first Government meeting, the Askin Government abolished the tow-away system for Sydney and Newcastle. In 1966 the University of New South Wales awarded him an honorary Doctor of Letters (D.Litt.).\nLaw reform.\nDespite a hostile Legislative Council, an extended drought and various industrial disputes, Askin and his Government passed several reforms. Among them were the removal of trading-hours restrictions on small businesses, abolishing juries for motor accident damage cases, extending the hours for liquor trading, thereby bringing an end to the \"Six o'clock swill\". The Government also moved into legal and local government reforms, attacking pollution and restoring the previously abolished postal voting rights in state elections. Askin also addressed the demands of the New England New State Movement by holding a referendum in 1967, which was defeated by a large margin.\nMany of his government's reforms were due to his minister for justice, John Maddison, and Attorney-General Sir Kenneth McCaw, who initiated the establishment of the Law Reform Commission of New South Wales, the introduction of consumer laws, an ombudsman, legal aid, health labels on cigarette packs, breath-testing of drivers, limits on vehicle emissions, the liberalisation of liquor laws, and compensation for victims of violent crime. There was also a new National Parks and Wildlife Service to assist environment conservation and protection. Despite these positive reforms, Askin's government maintained a brutal prison and corrective regime that was to culminate in the Bathurst Gaol riots in 1970 and 1974.\nLocal government and planning.\nAskin, along with his minister for local government, Pat Morton, oversaw the rapid escalation of building development in inner-city Sydney and the central business district, which followed in the wake of his controversial 1967 abolition of Sydney City Council and a redistribution of municipal electoral boundaries that was aimed at reducing the power of the rival Labor Party. On its abolition, Morton commented that it was \"essential for Sydney's progress\" and replaced the city council with a commission, headed by another former Liberal leader, Vernon Treatt.\nThe Sydney metropolitan area at the time was marked by increasing strains on state infrastructure and Askin's Government's pro-development stance was largely attributed as an attempt to alleviate these problems. Despite this, the newly established State Planning Authority were continuously criticised for not being totally accountable to the public, particularly as the pro-business Sydney Commissioners worked side by side with the Planning authority to increase developments in the Sydney CBD to their highest levels ever, embodied by the construction of the MLC Centre, the demolition of the Theatre Royal, Sydney and the Australia Hotel. Other controversial schemes proposed by his government were a massive freeway system that was planned to be driven through the hearts of historic inner-city suburbs including Glebe and Newtown and an equally ambitious scheme of 'slum clearance' that would have brought about the wholescale destruction of the historic areas of Woolloomooloo and The Rocks. This eventually culminated in the 1970s Green ban movement led by Unions Leader Jack Mundey, to protect the architectural heritage of Sydney.\nSecond term.\nAt the 24 February 1968 election, Askin increased his previously tenuous majority, scoring a six-seat swing against Labor's Renshaw and an overall majority of 12 over the Labor Party and the two Independents. Askin retained his seat with 70.97%. It was the first time since the UAP/Country Coalition won three consecutive elections from 1932 to 1938 that a non-Labor government in New South Wales had been reelected.\nIn mid-1968 Askin famously became embroiled in a media controversy over the reporting of several words spoken to the United States Chamber of Commerce lunch in Sydney on 32 July 1968 (also the day Opposition Leader Renshaw resigned, to be replaced by Pat Hills), in which he spoke of the October 1966 state visit by United States president Lyndon B. Johnson. Askin had joined Prime Minister Harold Holt, President Johnson and the American ambassador, Ed Clark, in a drive through the Sydney CBD. As Johnson's motorcade drove into Liverpool Street, several anti-Vietnam War protesters, including Graeme Dunstan, threw themselves in front of the car carrying them. As Askin later recalled, a police officer had informed him that some communists were obstructing the route. Askin claimed he had instructed the officer to drag them off. As the car moved on, he then said to Johnson \"half-jocularly\": \"what I ought to have told him was to ride over them\", to which Johnson replied \"a man after my own heart\". At the subsequent luncheon, Askin instead reported that he had said the remark to the police officer, which a journalist attending the event later reported it as \"Run over the bastards.\"\nFederal relations.\nAs Treasurer, Askin focused on the state budget and on Commonwealth-State financial relations. His attitude towards the Commonwealth and the Federal Government was shaped by his first premiers' conference in 1965 when Prime Minister Menzies negotiated with the Victorian premier Henry Bolte to achieve an extra grant of funds for Victoria at the expense of the other states and closed the conference before the other Premiers could object. At subsequent premiers' conferences he opposed the 'centralising' tendencies of Canberra and became a strong advocate of the rights of the states.\nWith John Gorton becoming prime minister after Holt's death, Askin came into conflict with the Commonwealth Government over Gorton's determination to maintain federal command over taxation and in June 1968 declared that he could veto any form of state taxation. In late 1969, Askin, with Bolte, organised an 'emergency' premiers' conference, without Gorton, to publicise the disadvantages of the States, a move that was partly responsible for the party deposition of Gorton in 1971.\nAskin had a greater dislike for Gorton's successor, William McMahon and received financial support from McMahon only when Askin threatened to release a NSW \"horror budget\" that could damage Federal Liberal voting intentions. However, when McMahon lost the 1972 election to Labor Leader Gough Whitlam, relations between Sydney and Canberra got even worse. Whitlam's centralising economic policies and decision to end legal appeals to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council drew criticism from Askin.\nThird and Fourth terms.\nAt the 13 February 1971 state election, the Coalition suffered a swing of four seats, but still managed a narrow win against Labor and new leader Pat Hills, taking 49 seats \u2013 a bare majority of one \u2013 in the expanded 96-seat Legislative Assembly.\nThroughout his time as premier, Askin was assisted by Charles Cutler as deputy premier and leader of the Country Party. Cutler served as acting premier at times when Askin was suffering from illness, having suffered two heart attacks in 1969 and 1973. In 1972 the Eastern Orthodox Church of Antioch presented Askin with the Order of St Peter and St Paul for his services to ethnic minorities.\nIn 1971 Askin changed his name from \"Robin\" to \"Robert\" by a deed poll. On 1 January 1972, he was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG). Later that year, taking advantage of unease at the increasingly erratic Labor government of Gough Whitlam and the increasing economic problems seen to be caused by it, Askin called an early election for 1973. A setback arose for the government in the northern Sydney seat of Gordon, when the Liberal member and education minister, Harry Jago, forgot to lodge a formal nomination of his candidacy. This resulted in the Liberals losing the seat to the Democratic Labor Party before the election took place. Nevertheless, Askin's government went to a record fourth win against the ALP (still led by Pat Hills), increasing the Liberal/Country majority by four seats and making Askin the only major party leader to win four consecutive terms for premier until Neville Wran of the ALP. At this election, Askin ran in Pittwater, essentially a reconfigured version of his old seat of Collaroy, which had been abolished in a redistribution. Pittwater was as safely Liberal as Collaroy, and Askin retained it easily. In 1973 he was appointed an Officer of the Lebanese National Order of the Cedar.\nAskin's last term in office was marked by tension between the NSW and Victorian Governments, and by a widespread view that Askin was getting out of touch with the voters. Late in 1974, Askin announced his resignation, and his last intervention was to support his minister for lands, Thomas Lewis, in his bid to be Askin's successor instead of the deputy leader and minister for education, Sir Eric Willis. It was reported that Lewis had offered to upgrade Askin's knighthood from Knight Commander (KCMG) to Knight Grand Cross (GCMG) of the Order of St Michael and St George, while Willis was uncommitted on the topic. In any event, Askin retired from politics in January 1975 and was succeeded by Lewis as premier. On 14 June 1975 he was elevated to Knight Grand Cross, for his service as premier.\nThe departure of Askin began a turbulent year for the government. Lewis was ousted in a party room coup by Willis in 1976, but Willis only lasted four months before losing the 1976 election to Labor, ending the longest unbroken run for a non-Labor government since World War I.\nLater life.\nAskin's health declined still further after 1975, and he died of heart failure on 9 September 1981 in St Vincent's Hospital, Sydney. The next day, the \"Sydney Morning Herald\" editorialised that he was \"one of the ablest, most industrious and colourful political leaders of Australia's post-war era\".\nHis state funeral, held on 14 September, was attended by over 1,000 mourners, including Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser, Premier Neville Wran, Mervyn Wood, Justice Lionel Murphy and former NSW Labor Premier and former governor-general Sir William McKell.\nAllegations of corruption.\nThere have been persistent allegations that Askin, allegedly assisted by then Police Commissioner Norman Allan, oversaw the creation of a lucrative network of corruption and bribery that involved politicians, public servants, police, and the nascent Sydney organised crime syndicates.\nWhen questioned about his wealth, Askin always attributed it to the salary from his high public office, his frugal lifestyle, good investments and canny punting. After his death the Australian Taxation Office audited his estate and, although it made no finding of criminality, it determined that a substantial part of it came from undisclosed income derived from sources other than shares or gambling.\nWith Askin's death in 1981, investigative journalists were freed from the threat of legal action under Australia's defamation laws. Stories about his reputed corruption were published almost immediately. Most notable of those was an article that appeared in \"The National Times\" co-written by David Marr and David Hickie. Headlined \"Askin: friend of organised crime\", it was published on the day of Askin's funeral. That was followed by David Hickie's book \"The Prince and The Premier\", which detailed Askin's long involvement in illegal bookmaking, and allegations that he had received substantial and long-running payoffs from organised crime figures.\nIn 2007, the centenary of Askin's birth, went largely unnoticed, with the Liberal Party distancing itself from him.\nThe allegations of corruption against Askin were revived in 2008 when Alan Saffron, the son of the late Sydney crime boss Abe Saffron, published a biography of his father in which he alleged that Saffron had paid bribes to major public officials, including Askin, former police commissioner Norman Allan, and other leading figures, whom he claimed he could not name because they were still alive. Alan Saffron alleged that his father made payments of between A$5000 and $10,000 per week to both men over many years, that Askin and Allan both visited Saffron's office on several occasions, that Allan also visited the Saffron family home, and that Abe Saffron paid for an all-expenses overseas trip for Allan and a young female \"friend\". He also alleged that, later in Askin's premiership, Abe Saffron became the \"bagman\" for Sydney's illegal liquor and prostitution rackets, and most illegal gambling activities, collecting payoffs that were then passed to Askin, Allan and others, in return for which his father was completely protected.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n\u00a0"}

The opposite change, a decrease in wavelength and increase in frequency and energy, is known as a blueshift.\nThree forms of redshift occur in astronomy and cosmology: Doppler redshifts due to the relative motions of radiation sources, gravitational redshift as radiation escapes from gravitational potentials, and cosmological redshifts caused by the universe expanding. In astronomy, the value of a redshift is often denoted by the letter \"z\", corresponding to the fractional change in wavelength (positive for redshifts, negative for blueshifts), and by the wavelength ratio 1 + \"z\" (which is greater than 1 for redshifts and less than 1 for blueshifts). Automated astronomical redshift surveys are an important tool for learning about the large-scale structure of the universe. Redshift and blueshift can also be related to photon energy and, via Planck's law, to a corresponding blackbody temperature.\nExamples of strong redshifting are a gamma ray perceived as an X-ray, or initially visible light perceived as radio waves. The initial 3000 kelvin (K) radiation from the Big Bang has redshifted far down to become the 3K cosmic microwave background. Subtler redshifts are seen in the spectroscopic observations of astronomical objects, and are used in terrestrial technologies such as Doppler radar and radar guns. \nGravitational waves, which also travel at the speed of light, are subject to the same redshift phenomena.\nOther physical processes exist that can lead to a shift in the frequency of electromagnetic radiation, including scattering and optical effects; however, the resulting changes are distinguishable from (astronomical) redshift and are not generally referred to as such.\nConcept.\nUsing a telescope and a spectrometer, the variation in intensity of star light with frequency can be measured. The resulting spectrum can be compared to the spectrum from hot gases expected in stars, such as hydrogen, in a laboratory on Earth. As illustrated with the idealised spectrum in the top-right, to determine the redshift, features in the two spectra such as absorption lines, emission lines, or other variations in light intensity may be shifted.\nRedshift (and blueshift) may be characterised by the relative difference between the observed and emitted wavelengths (or frequency) of an object. In astronomy, it is customary to refer to this change using a dimensionless quantity called \"z\". If \"\u03bb\" represents wavelength and \"f\" represents frequency (note, \"\u03bbf\" \n \"c\" where \"c\" is the speed of light), then \"z\" is defined by the equations:\nDoppler effect blueshifts (\"z\" &lt; 0) are associated with objects approaching (moving closer to) the observer with the light shifting to greater energies. Conversely, Doppler effect redshifts (\"z\" &gt; 0) are associated with objects receding (moving away) from the observer with the light shifting to lower energies. Likewise, gravitational blueshifts are associated with light emitted from a source residing within a weaker gravitational field as observed from within a stronger gravitational field, while gravitational redshifting implies the opposite conditions.\nHistory.\nThe history of the subject began in the 19th century, with the development of classical wave mechanics and the exploration of phenomena which are associated with the Doppler effect. The effect is named after the Austrian mathematician Christian Doppler, who offered the first known physical explanation for the phenomenon in 1842. In 1845, the hypothesis was tested and confirmed for sound waves by the Dutch scientist Christophorus Buys Ballot. Doppler correctly predicted that the phenomenon would apply to all waves and, in particular, suggested that the varying colors of stars could be attributed to their motion with respect to the Earth.\nUnaware of Doppler's work, French physicist Hippolyte Fizeau suggested in 1848 that a shift in spectral lines from stars might be used to measure their motion relative to Earth. In 1850, Fran\u00e7ois-Napol\u00e9on-Marie Moigno analysed both Doppler's and Fizeau's ideas in a publication read by both James Clerk Maxwell and William Huggins, who initially stuck to the idea that the color of stars related to their chemistry, however by 1868, Huggins was the first to determine the velocity of a star moving away from the Earth by the analysis of spectral shifts.\nIn 1871, optical redshift was confirmed when the phenomenon was observed in Fraunhofer lines, using solar rotation, about 0.1 \u00c5 in the red. In 1887, Hermann Carl Vogel and Julius Scheiner discovered the \"annual Doppler effect\", the yearly change in the Doppler shift of stars located near the ecliptic, due to the orbital velocity of the Earth. In 1901, Aristarkh Belopolsky verified optical redshift in the laboratory using a system of rotating mirrors.\nBeginning with observations in 1912, Vesto Slipher discovered that the Andromeda Galaxy had a blue shift, indicating that it was moving towards the Earth. Slipher first reported his measurement in the inaugural volume of the \"Lowell Observatory Bulletin\". Three years later, he wrote a review in the journal \"Popular Astronomy\". In it he stated that \"the early discovery that the great Andromeda spiral had the quite exceptional velocity of \u2013300 km[/s] showed the means then available, capable of investigating not only the spectra of the spirals but their velocities as well.\" Slipher reported the velocities for 15 spiral nebulae spread across the entire celestial sphere, all but three having observable \"positive\" (that is recessional) velocities.\nUntil 1923 the nature of the nebulae was unclear. By that year Edwin Hubble had established that these were galaxies and worked out a procedure to measure distance based on the period-luminosity relation of variable Cepheids stars. This made it possible to test a prediction by Willem de Sitter in 1917 that redshift would be correlated with distance. In 1929 Hubble combined his distance estimates with redshift data from Slipher's reports and measurements by Milton Humason to report an approximate relationship between the redshift and distance, a result now called Hubble's law.\nTheories relating to the redshift-distance relation also evolved during the 1920s. The solution to the equations of general relativity described by de Sitter contained no matter, but in 1922 Alexander Friedmann derived dynamic solutions, now called the Friedmann equations, based on frictionless fluid models. Independently Georges Lema\u00eetre derived similar equations in 1927 and his analysis became widely known around the time of Hubble's key publication.\nBy early 1930 the combination of the redshift measurements and theoretical models established a major breakthrough in the new science of cosmology: the universe had a history and its expansion could be investigated with physical models backed up with observational astronomy.\nWhen cosmological redshifts were first discovered, Fritz Zwicky proposed an effect known as tired light. However this model has largely been ruled out by timescale stretch observations in type Ia supernovae.\nArthur Eddington used the term \"red shift\" as early as 1923, which is the oldest example of the term reported by the \"Oxford English Dictionary\". Willem de Sitter used the single-word version \"redshift\" in 1934.\nIn the 1960s the discovery of quasars, which appear as very blue point sources and thus were initially thought to be unusual stars, led to the idea that they were as bright as they were because they were closer than their redshift data indicated. A flurry of theoretical and observational work concluded that these objects were very powerful but distant astronomical objects.\nPhysical origins.\nRedshifts are differences between two wavelength measurements and wavelengths are a property of both the photons and the measuring equipment. Thus redshifts characterise differences between two measurement locations. These differences are commonly organised in three groups, attributed to relative motion between the source and the observer, to the expansion of the universe, and to gravity. The following sections explain these groups.\nDoppler effect.\nIf a source of the light is moving away from an observer, then redshift (\"z\" &gt; 0) occurs; if the source moves towards the observer, then blueshift (\"z\" &lt; 0) occurs. This is true for all electromagnetic waves and is explained by the Doppler effect. Consequently, this type of redshift is called the \"Doppler redshift\". If the source moves away from the observer with velocity \"v\", which is much less than the speed of light (\"v\" \u226a \"c\"), the redshift is given by\nformula_1\nwhere \"c\" is the speed of light (since formula_2). In the classical Doppler effect, the frequency of the source is not modified, but the recessional motion causes the illusion of a lower frequency.\nA more complete treatment of the Doppler redshift requires considering relativistic effects associated with motion of sources close to the speed of light. A complete derivation of the effect can be found in the article on the relativistic Doppler effect. In brief, objects moving close to the speed of light will experience deviations from the above formula due to the time dilation of special relativity which can be corrected for by introducing the Lorentz factor \"\u03b3\" into the classical Doppler formula as follows (for motion solely in the line of sight):\nformula_3\nThis phenomenon was first observed in a 1938 experiment performed by Herbert E. Ives and G. R. Stilwell, called the Ives\u2013Stilwell experiment.\nSince the Lorentz factor is dependent only on the magnitude of the velocity, this causes the redshift associated with the relativistic correction to be independent of the orientation of the source movement. In contrast, the classical part of the formula is dependent on the projection of the movement of the source into the line-of-sight which yields different results for different orientations. If \"\u03b8\" is the angle between the direction of relative motion and the direction of emission in the observer's frame (zero angle is directly away from the observer), the full form for the relativistic Doppler effect becomes:\nformula_4\nand for motion solely in the line of sight (\"\u03b8\" \n 0\u00b0), this equation reduces to:\nformula_5\nFor the special case that the light is moving at right angle (\"\u03b8\" \n 90\u00b0) to the direction of relative motion in the observer's frame, the relativistic redshift is known as the transverse redshift, and a redshift:\nformula_6\nis measured, even though the object is not moving away from the observer. Even when the source is moving towards the observer, if there is a transverse component to the motion then there is some speed at which the dilation just cancels the expected blueshift and at higher speed the approaching source will be redshifted.\nCosmological.\nThe observations of increasing redshifts from more and more distant galaxies can be modelled assuming a homogeneous and isotropic universe combined with general relativity. This cosmological redshift can be written as a function of \"a\", the time-dependent cosmic scale factor:\nformula_7\nThe scale factor is monotonically increasing as time passes. Thus \"z\" is positive, close to zero for local stars, and increasing for distant galaxies that appear redshifted.\nUsing a Friedmann\u2013Robertson\u2013Walker model of the expansion of the universe, redshift can be related to the age of an observed object, the so-called \"cosmic time\u2013redshift relation\". Denote a density ratio as \u03a90:\nformula_8\nwith \"\u03c1\"crit the critical density demarcating a universe that eventually crunches from one that simply expands. This density is about three hydrogen atoms per cubic meter of space. At large redshifts, \"1 + z\" &gt; \u03a90\u22121, one finds:\nformula_9\nwhere \"H\"0 is the present-day Hubble constant, and \"z\" is the redshift.\nThe cosmological redshift is commonly attributed to stretching of the wavelengths of photons due to the stretching of space. This interpretation can be misleading. \nAs required by general relativity, the cosmological expansion of space has no effect on local physics. There is no term related to expansion in Maxwell's equations that govern light propagation. The cosmological redshift can be interpreted as an accumulation of infinitesimal Doppler shifts along the trajectory of the light.\nThere are several websites for calculating various times and distances from redshift, as the precise calculations require numerical integrals for most values of the parameters.\nDistinguishing between cosmological and local effects.\nThe redshift of a galaxy includes both a component related to recessional velocity from expansion of the universe, and a component related to the peculiar motion of the galaxy with respect to its local universe. The redshift due to expansion of the universe depends upon the recessional velocity in a fashion determined by the cosmological model chosen to describe the expansion of the universe, which is very different from how Doppler redshift depends upon local velocity. Describing the cosmological expansion origin of redshift, cosmologist Edward Robert Harrison said, \"Light leaves a galaxy, which is stationary in its local region of space, and is eventually received by observers who are stationary in their own local region of space. Between the galaxy and the observer, light travels through vast regions of expanding space. As a result, all wavelengths of the light are stretched by the expansion of space. It is as simple as that...\" Steven Weinberg clarified, \"The increase of wavelength from emission to absorption of light does not depend on the rate of change of \"a\"(\"t\") [the scale factor] at the times of emission or absorption, but on the increase of \"a\"(\"t\") in the whole period from emission to absorption.\"\nGravitational redshift.\nIn the theory of general relativity, there is time dilation within a gravitational well. Light emitted within the well will appear to have fewer cycles per second when measured outside of the well, due to differences in the two clocks. This is known as the gravitational redshift or \"Einstein shift\". The theoretical derivation of this effect follows from the Schwarzschild solution of the Einstein equations which yields the following formula for redshift associated with a photon travelling in the gravitational field of an uncharged, nonrotating, spherically symmetric mass:\nformula_10\nwhere\nThis gravitational redshift result can be derived from the assumptions of special relativity and the equivalence principle; the full theory of general relativity is not required.\nThe effect is very small but measurable on Earth using the M\u00f6ssbauer effect and was first observed in the Pound\u2013Rebka experiment. However, it is significant near a black hole, and as an object approaches the event horizon the red shift becomes infinite. It is also the dominant cause of large angular-scale temperature fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background radiation (see Sachs\u2013Wolfe effect).\nSummary table.\nSeveral important special-case formulae for redshift in certain special spacetime geometries are summarised in the following table. In all cases the magnitude of the shift (the value of \"z\") is independent of the wavelength.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nObservations in astronomy.\nThe redshift observed in astronomy can be measured because the emission and absorption spectra for atoms are distinctive and well known, calibrated from spectroscopic experiments in laboratories on Earth. When the redshifts of various absorption and emission lines from a single astronomical object are measured, \"z\" is found to be remarkably constant. Although distant objects may be slightly blurred and lines broadened, it is by no more than can be explained by thermal or mechanical motion of the source. For these reasons and others, the consensus among astronomers is that the redshifts they observe are due to some combination of the three established forms of Doppler-like redshifts.\nSpectroscopy, as a measurement, is considerably more difficult than simple photometry, which measures the brightness of astronomical objects through certain filters. When photometric data is all that is available (for example, the Hubble Deep Field and the Hubble Ultra Deep Field), astronomers rely on a technique for measuring photometric redshifts. Due to the broad wavelength ranges in photometric filters and the necessary assumptions about the nature of the spectrum at the light-source, errors for these sorts of measurements can range up to \u03b4\"z\" \n 0.5, and are much less reliable than spectroscopic determinations.\nHowever, photometry does at least allow a qualitative characterisation of a redshift. For example, if a Sun-like spectrum had a redshift of \"z\" \n 1, it would be brightest in the infrared (1000\u00a0nm) rather than at the blue-green (500\u00a0nm) color associated with the peak of its blackbody spectrum, and the light intensity will be reduced in the filter by a factor of four, (1 + \"z\")2. Both the photon count rate and the photon energy are redshifted. (See K correction for more details on the photometric consequences of redshift.)\nDetermining the redshift of an object with spectroscopy requires the wavelength of the emitted light in the rest frame of the source. Astronomical applications rely on distinct spectral lines. Redshifts cannot be calculated by looking at unidentified features whose rest-frame frequency is unknown, or with a spectrum that is featureless or white noise (random fluctuations in a spectrum). Thus gamma-ray bursts themselves cannot be used for reliable redshift measurements, but optical afterglow associated with the burst can be analysed for redshifts.\nLocal observations.\nIn nearby objects (within our Milky Way galaxy) observed redshifts are almost always related to the line-of-sight velocities associated with the objects being observed. Observations of such redshifts and blueshifts enable astronomers to measure velocities and parametrise the masses of the orbiting stars in spectroscopic binaries. Similarly, small redshifts and blueshifts detected in the spectroscopic measurements of individual stars are one way astronomers have been able to diagnose and measure the presence and characteristics of planetary systems around other stars and have even made very detailed differential measurements of redshifts during planetary transits to determine precise orbital parameters. Some approaches are able to track the redshift variations in multiple objects at once.\nFinely detailed measurements of redshifts are used in helioseismology to determine the precise movements of the photosphere of the Sun. Redshifts have also been used to make the first measurements of the rotation rates of planets, velocities of interstellar clouds, the rotation of galaxies, and the dynamics of accretion onto neutron stars and black holes which exhibit both Doppler and gravitational redshifts. The temperatures of various emitting and absorbing objects can be obtained by measuring Doppler broadening\u2014effectively redshifts and blueshifts over a single emission or absorption line. By measuring the broadening and shifts of the 21-centimeter hydrogen line in different directions, astronomers have been able to measure the recessional velocities of interstellar gas, which in turn reveals the rotation curve of our Milky Way. Similar measurements have been performed on other galaxies, such as Andromeda.\nExtragalactic observations.\nThe most distant objects exhibit larger redshifts corresponding to the Hubble flow of the universe. The largest-observed redshift, corresponding to the greatest distance and furthest back in time, is that of the cosmic microwave background radiation; the numerical value of its redshift is about \"z\" \n 1089 (\"z\" \n 0 corresponds to present time), and it shows the state of the universe about 13.8 billion years ago, and 379,000 years after the initial moments of the Big Bang.\nThe luminous point-like cores of quasars were the first \"high-redshift\" (\"z\" &gt; 0.1) objects discovered before the improvement of telescopes allowed for the discovery of other high-redshift galaxies.\nFor galaxies more distant than the Local Group and the nearby Virgo Cluster, but within a thousand megaparsecs or so, the redshift is approximately proportional to the galaxy's distance. This correlation was first observed by Edwin Hubble and has come to be known as Hubble's law. Vesto Slipher was the first to discover galactic redshifts, in about 1912, while Hubble correlated Slipher's measurements with distances he measured by other means to formulate his law. Because it is usually not known how luminous objects are, measuring the redshift is easier than more direct distance measurements, so redshift is sometimes in practice converted to a crude distance measurement using Hubble's law.\nGravitational interactions of galaxies with each other and clusters cause a significant scatter in the normal plot of the Hubble diagram. The peculiar velocities associated with galaxies superimpose a rough trace of the mass of virialised objects in the universe. This effect leads to such phenomena as nearby galaxies (such as the Andromeda Galaxy) exhibiting blueshifts as we fall towards a common barycenter, and redshift maps of clusters showing a fingers of god effect due to the scatter of peculiar velocities in a roughly spherical distribution. These \"redshift-space distortions\" can be used as a cosmological probe in their own right, providing information on how structure formed in the universe, and how gravity behaves on large scales.\nThe Hubble law's linear relationship between distance and redshift assumes that the rate of expansion of the universe is constant. However, when the universe was much younger, the expansion rate, and thus the Hubble \"constant\", was larger than it is today. For more distant galaxies, then, whose light has been travelling to us for much longer times, the approximation of constant expansion rate fails, and the Hubble law becomes a non-linear integral relationship and dependent on the history of the expansion rate since the emission of the light from the galaxy in question. Observations of the redshift-distance relationship can be used, then, to determine the expansion history of the universe and thus the matter and energy content.\nIt was long believed that the expansion rate has been continuously decreasing since the Big Bang, but observations beginning in 1988 of the redshift-distance relationship using Type Ia supernovae have suggested that in comparatively recent times the expansion rate of the universe has begun to accelerate.\nHighest redshifts.\nThe most reliable redshifts are from spectroscopic data, and the highest-confirmed spectroscopic redshift of a galaxy is that of JADES-GS-z14-0 with a redshift of \"z\" \n 14.32, corresponding to 290 million years after the Big Bang. The previous record was held by GN-z11, with a redshift of \"z\" \n 11.1, corresponding to 400 million years after the Big Bang.\nSlightly less reliable are Lyman-break redshifts, the highest of which is the lensed galaxy A1689-zD1 at a redshift \"z\" \n 7.5 and the next highest being \"z\" \n 7.0. The most distant-observed gamma-ray burst with a spectroscopic redshift measurement was GRB 090423, which had a redshift of \"z\" \n 8.2. The most distant-known quasar, ULAS J1342+0928, is at \"z\" \n 7.54. The highest-known redshift radio galaxy (TGSS1530) is at a redshift \"z\" \n 5.72 and the highest-known redshift molecular material is the detection of emission from the CO molecule from the quasar SDSS J1148+5251 at \"z\" \n 6.42.\n\"Extremely red objects\" (EROs) are astronomical sources of radiation that radiate energy in the red and near infrared part of the electromagnetic spectrum. These may be starburst galaxies that have a high redshift accompanied by reddening from intervening dust, or they could be highly redshifted elliptical galaxies with an older (and therefore redder) stellar population. Objects that are even redder than EROs are termed \"hyper extremely red objects\" (HEROs).\nThe cosmic microwave background has a redshift of z \n 1089, corresponding to an age of approximately 379,000 years after the Big Bang and a proper distance of more than 46 billion light-years. This redshift corresponds to a shift in average temperature from 3000\u00a0K down to 3\u00a0K. The yet-to-be-observed first light from the oldest Population III stars, not long after atoms first formed and the CMB ceased to be absorbed almost completely, may have redshifts in the range of 20 &lt; \"z\" &lt; 100. Other high-redshift events predicted by physics but not presently observable are the cosmic neutrino background from about two seconds after the Big Bang (and a redshift in excess of \"z\" &gt; 1010) and the cosmic gravitational wave background emitted directly from inflation at a redshift in excess of \"z\" &gt; 1025.\nIn June 2015, astronomers reported evidence for Population III stars in the Cosmos Redshift 7 galaxy at \"z\" \n 6.60. Such stars are likely to have existed in the very early universe (i.e., at high redshift), and may have started the production of chemical elements heavier than hydrogen that are needed for the later formation of planets and life as we know it.\nRedshift surveys.\nWith advent of automated telescopes and improvements in spectroscopes, a number of collaborations have been made to map the universe in redshift space. By combining redshift with angular position data, a redshift survey maps the 3D distribution of matter within a field of the sky. These observations are used to measure properties of the large-scale structure of the universe. The Great Wall, a vast supercluster of galaxies over 500 million light-years wide, provides a dramatic example of a large-scale structure that redshift surveys can detect.\nThe first redshift survey was the CfA Redshift Survey, started in 1977 with the initial data collection completed in 1982. More recently, the 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey determined the large-scale structure of one section of the universe, measuring redshifts for over 220,000 galaxies; data collection was completed in 2002, and the final data set was released 30 June 2003. The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) began collecting data in 1998 and published its eighteenth data release in 2023. SSDS has measured redshifts for galaxies as high as 0.8, and has recorded over 100,000 quasars at \"z\" \n 3 and beyond. The DEEP2 Redshift Survey used the Keck telescopes with the \"DEIMOS\" spectrograph; a follow-up to the pilot program DEEP1, DEEP2 was designed to measure faint galaxies with redshifts 0.7 and above, and it recorded redshifts of over 38,000 objects by its conclusion in 2013.\nEffects from physical optics or radiative transfer.\nThe interactions and phenomena summarised in the subjects of radiative transfer and physical optics can result in shifts in the wavelength and frequency of electromagnetic radiation. In such cases, the shifts correspond to a physical energy transfer to matter or other photons rather than being by a transformation between reference frames. Such shifts can be from such physical phenomena as coherence effects or the scattering of electromagnetic radiation whether from charged elementary particles, from particulates, or from fluctuations of the index of refraction in a dielectric medium as occurs in the radio phenomenon of radio whistlers. While such phenomena are sometimes referred to as \"redshifts\" and \"blueshifts\", in astrophysics light-matter interactions that result in energy shifts in the radiation field are generally referred to as \"reddening\" rather than \"redshifting\" which, as a term, is normally reserved for the effects discussed above.\nIn many circumstances scattering causes radiation to redden because entropy results in the predominance of many low-energy photons over few high-energy ones (while conserving total energy). Except possibly under carefully controlled conditions, scattering does not produce the same relative change in wavelength across the whole spectrum; that is, any calculated \"z\" is generally a function of wavelength. Furthermore, scattering from random media generally occurs at many angles, and \"z\" is a function of the scattering angle. If multiple scattering occurs, or the scattering particles have relative motion, then there is generally distortion of spectral lines as well.\nIn interstellar astronomy, visible spectra can appear redder due to scattering processes in a phenomenon referred to as interstellar reddening\u2014similarly Rayleigh scattering causes the atmospheric reddening of the Sun seen in the sunrise or sunset and causes the rest of the sky to have a blue colour. This phenomenon is distinct from redshifting because the spectroscopic lines are not shifted to other wavelengths in reddened objects and there is an additional dimming and distortion associated with the phenomenon due to photons being scattered in and out of the line of sight.\nBlueshift.\nThe opposite of a redshift is a blueshift. A blueshift is any decrease in wavelength (increase in energy), with a corresponding increase in frequency, of an electromagnetic wave. In visible light, this shifts a color towards the blue end of the spectrum.\nDoppler blueshift.\nDoppler blueshift is caused by movement of a source towards the observer. The term applies to any decrease in wavelength and increase in frequency caused by relative motion, even outside the visible spectrum. Only objects moving at near-relativistic speeds toward the observer are noticeably bluer to the naked eye, but the wavelength of any reflected or emitted photon or other particle is shortened in the direction of travel.\nDoppler blueshift is used in astronomy to determine relative motion:\nGravitational blueshift.\nUnlike the \"relative\" Doppler blueshift, caused by movement of a source towards the observer and thus dependent on the received angle of the photon, gravitational blueshift is \"absolute\" and does not depend on the received angle of the photon:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIt is a natural consequence of conservation of energy and mass\u2013energy equivalence, and was confirmed experimentally in 1959 with the Pound\u2013Rebka experiment. Gravitational blueshift contributes to cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy via the Sachs\u2013Wolfe effect: when a gravitational well evolves while a photon is passing, the amount of blueshift on approach will differ from the amount of gravitational redshift as it leaves the region.\nBlue outliers.\nThere are far-away active galaxies that show a blueshift in their [O III] emission lines. One of the largest blueshifts is found in the narrow-line quasar, PG 1543+489, which has a relative velocity of \u22121150\u00a0km/s. These types of galaxies are called \"blue outliers\".\nCosmological blueshift.\nIn a hypothetical universe undergoing a runaway Big Crunch contraction, a cosmological blueshift would be observed, with galaxies further away being increasingly blueshifted\u2014the exact opposite of the actually observed cosmological redshift in the present expanding universe.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

As an actor, Reiner first came to national prominence with the role of Mike \"Meathead\" Stivic on the CBS sitcom \"All in the Family\" (1971\u20131979), a performance that earned him two Primetime Emmy Awards. His other acting credits include \"Throw Momma from the Train\" (1987), \"Sleepless in Seattle\" (1993), \"Bullets Over Broadway\" (1994), \"The First Wives Club\" (1996), \"Primary Colors\" (1998), \"EDtv\" (1999), \"Everyone's Hero\" (2006), and \"The Wolf of Wall Street\" (2013).\nReiner made his directorial film debut with heavy metal mockumentary \"This Is Spinal Tap\" (1984). He then earned acclaim directing the romantic comedy \"The Sure Thing\" (1985), coming of age drama \"Stand by Me\" (1986), fantasy adventure \"The Princess Bride\" (1987), romantic comedy \"When Harry Met Sally...\" (1989), psychological horror-thriller \"Misery\" (1990), military courtroom drama \"A Few Good Men\" (1992) which was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture, and romantic comedy-drama \"The American President\" (1995). He has earned nominations for four Golden Globe Awards for Best Director, and three Directors Guild of America Awards.\nEarly life.\nReiner was born into a Jewish family in the Bronx, New York, on March 6, 1947. His parents were Estelle and Carl Reiner. As a child, Reiner lived at 48 Bonnie Meadow Road in New Rochelle, New York. He studied at the UCLA Film School.\nCareer.\nIn the early 1960s Reiner served as a trainee/apprentice at the Bucks County Playhouse in New Hope, Pennsylvania. He is credited (as Robert Reiner) with the non-speaking role of Thomas, who is the horse wrangler (appointed by the bloodthirsty Sergeant Wesley Kiles played by Charles McGraw) in \"Wagon Train\", Season 5, Episode 22 \"The Lieutenant Burton Story\" starring Dean Jones in the title role, which aired on 2/27/1962. In the late 1960s, Reiner acted in bit roles in several television shows including \"Batman\", \"That Girl\", \"The Andy Griffith Show\", \"Room 222\", \"Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C.\" and \"The Beverly Hillbillies\". During this time he also appeared in several films, including some by his father such as \"Where's Poppa?\" (1970). He began his career writing for the \"Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour\" in 1968 and 1969, with Steve Martin as his writing partner as the two youngest writers on the show.\nTwo years later, Reiner became famous playing Michael Stivic, Archie Bunker's liberal son-in-law, on Norman Lear's 1970s situation comedy \"All in the Family\", which was inspired by the British sitcom \"Till Death Us Do Part\". It was the most-watched television program in the United States for five seasons (1971\u20131976). The character's nickname \"Meathead\" (given to him by his cantankerous father-in-law Archie) became closely associated with him, even after he had left the role and went on to build a career as a director. Reiner has stated, \"I could win the Nobel Prize and they'd write 'Meathead wins the Nobel Prize'.\" For his performance, Reiner won two Emmy Awards, in addition to three other nominations, and five Golden Globe nominations. After an extended absence, Reiner returned to television acting with a recurring role on \"New Girl\" (2012\u20132018).\nIn October 1971, he had a guest role in an episode of \"The Partridge Family\". In 1972, Reiner, Phil Mishkin, and Gerry Isenberg created the situation comedy \"The Super\" for ABC. Starring Richard S. Castellano, the show depicted the life of the harried Italian American superintendent of a New York City apartment building and ran for 10 episodes in the summer of 1972. Reiner and Mishkin co-wrote the premiere episode.\nBeginning in the 1980s, Reiner became known as a director of several successful Hollywood films that spanned many different genres. Some of his earlier films include cult classics such as the rock-band mockumentary \"This Is Spinal Tap\" (1984) and the comedic fantasy film \"The Princess Bride\" (1987), as well as his period piece coming of age tale \"Stand by Me\" (1986). He often collaborates with film editor Robert Leighton, whom he also shares with fellow director-actor Christopher Guest as their go-to editor.\nReiner has gone on to direct other critically and commercially successful films with his own company, Castle Rock Entertainment. These include the romantic comedy \"When Harry Met Sally...\" (1989), which has been critically ranked among the all-time best of its genre, the tense thriller \"Misery\" (1990), for which Kathy Bates won the Academy Award for Best Actress, and his most commercially successful work, the military courtroom drama \"A Few Good Men\" (1992), which was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture. Subsequent films directed by Reiner include the political romance \"The American President\" (1995), the courtroom drama \"Ghosts of Mississippi\" (1996), and the uplifting comedy \"The Bucket List\" (2007).\nReiner has continued to act in supporting roles in a number of films and television shows, including \"Throw Momma from the Train\" (1987), \"Sleepless in Seattle\" (1993), \"Bullets Over Broadway\" (1994), \"The First Wives Club\" (1996), \"Primary Colors\" (1998), \"EDtv\" (1999), \"New Girl\" (2012\u20132018), and \"The Wolf of Wall Street\" (2013). He has also acted in several of his own films, most notably as faux-documentarian Marty DeBirgi in \"This is Spinal Tap\". Other acting roles in his movies include \"The Story of Us\" (1999), \"Alex &amp; Emma\" (2001), and a major supporting role in his journalism drama \"Shock and Awe\" (2017), among others. Reiner has also parodied himself with cameos in works such as \"\" (2003), and \"30 Rock\" (2010).\nIn December 2023 Reiner opened the primetime CBS special \"Dick Van Dyke: 98 Years of Magic\" with a tribute to, and conversation with, Dick Van Dyke.\nPolitical views.\nReiner has devoted considerable time and energy to liberal activism.\nReiner is a co-founder of the American Foundation for Equal Rights, which initiated the court challenge against California Proposition 8 that banned same-sex marriage in the state.\nIn 1998, Reiner chaired the campaign to pass Prop 10, the California Children and Families Initiative, which created First 5 California, a program of early childhood development services, funded by a tax on tobacco products. He served as the first chairman of First 5 California, from 1999 to 2006. His lobbying, particularly as an anti-smoking advocate, prompted his likeness to be used in a satirical role in a \"South Park\" episode titled \"Butt Out\", in which he is depicted as a morbidly obese, hypocritical tyrant. Reiner came under criticism for campaigning for a ballot measure (Prop 82) to fund state-run preschools while still chair of the First Five Commission, causing him to resign from his position on March 29, 2006. An audit was conducted, and it concluded that the state commission did not violate state law and that it had clear legal authority to conduct its public advertising campaigns related to preschool. Prop 82 failed to win approval, garnering only 39.1% support.\nReiner is a member of the Social Responsibility Task Force, an organization advocating moderation where social issues (such as violence and tobacco use) and the entertainment industry meet. He is also active in environmental issues, and he successfully led the effort to establish California's Ahmanson Ranch as a state park and wildlife refuge rather than as a commercial real estate development. He introduced Spinal Tap at the London Live Earth concert in July 2007.\nReiner was mentioned as a possible candidate to run against California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger in 2006 but decided not to run for personal reasons. He campaigned extensively for Democratic presidential nominee Al Gore in the 2000 presidential election, and he campaigned in Iowa for Democratic presidential candidate Howard Dean just before the 2004 Iowa caucuses. He endorsed Hillary Clinton for president for the 2008 election. In 2015, he donated $10,000 to Correct the Record, a political action committee that supported Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign. Since the 2016 election, he has continued to campaign against Donald Trump, calling him racist, sexist, anti-gay, and anti-Semitic. Reiner said that Harvey Weinstein is a \"bad guy\" but Trump is \"also an abuser\".\nReiner serves on the advisory board of the \"Committee to Investigate Russia\". He and David Frum launched the site in September 2017 with Morgan Freeman warning people that \"We are at war\" and that Russia has attacked the United States. Others on the committee's advisory board at the time of launch included James Clapper, Max Boot, Charles Sykes, and Norman Ornstein. Additionally, in early November 2020, the advisory board included Evelyn Farkas, Michael Hayden, Michael Morrell, Leon Panetta, and Clint Watts.\nReiner endorsed Joe Biden for president for the 2020 election.\nIn June 2021, Reiner said that he was working on a 10- to 13-episode TV project covering the relationship between Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump. The project, he said, would cover the leaders' childhoods up until the point where their lives cross. Reiner said he is working with writer Ward Parry on the project, which he is calling \"The Spy and the Asset\".\nPersonal life.\nRob Reiner married actress/director Penny Marshall in 1971. He adopted Marshall's daughter, actress Tracy Reiner (\"A League of Their Own\"), from a previous marriage to Michael Henry. Reiner and Marshall divorced in 1981.\nReiner was introduced to his future wife, photographer Michele Singer, while directing \"When Harry Met Sally\". The meeting not only resulted in his decision to change the ending of that film, but he also married Singer in 1989. They have three children, Jake (born 1991), Nick (born 1993), and Romy (born 1997).\nIn 1997, Reiner and Singer founded the \"I Am Your Child Foundation\", and in 2004, they founded the \"Parents' Action for Children\", a non-profit organization with a dual purpose: 1) to raise awareness of the importance of a child's early years by producing and distributing celebrity-hosted educational videos for parents, and 2) to advance public policy through parental education and advocacy.\nReiner has stated that his childhood home was not observantly Jewish, although he did have a bar mitzvah ceremony; Reiner's father Carl acknowledged that he himself had become atheistic as the Holocaust progressed. Reiner identified himself as having no religious affiliation and as atheistic on the January 13, 2012, episode of \"Real Time with Bill Maher\". Reiner later said that while he rejected organized religion, he was sympathetic to the ideas of Buddhism.\nFilmography.\nTelevision.\nTV writer\nTV movies\nAwards and nominations.\nTelevision\nFilm\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Peter Debruge in a review for Variety wrote: \"So bless Wright for paring \u201cLand\u201d down to a beautiful haiku, and for delivering a performance that's ambiguous and understated in all the right ways,\" and \"in a directorial debut so pure and simple it speaks to enormous self-confidence, has better instincts than to reveal outright.\"\nIn 2022, Wright directed the final two episodes of the first part of season 4 of the Netflix show, \"Ozark\". The episodes were titled: \"Sangre Sobre Todo\" and \"Sanctified\". Kayla Cobb for \"Decider\" praised Wright's direction in the latter episode as \"powerful\" with the pairing of her direction, the script and actress Julia Garner's performance as a \"masterful collaboration.\"\nWright will next star in and produce Ben Young's thriller \"Where All Light Tends to Go\", an adaptation of the book of the same name by David Joy. In April 2022, Wright joined the cast of Netflix's fantasy film \"Damsel\" directed by Juan Carlos Fresnadillo. Wright also starred in a Sony Pictures Classics and Miramax adaptation of Richard McGuire's \"Here\" in a \"Forrest Gump\" reteam with director Robert Zemeckis, actor Tom Hanks and writer Eric Roth coming on November 1, 2024.\nPersonal life.\nFrom 1986 to 1988, Wright was married to actor Dane Witherspoon, whom she met in 1984 on the set of the soap opera \"Santa Barbara\".\nIn 1989, Wright became involved with actor Sean Penn following his divorce from Madonna. Wright was offered the role of Maid Marian in the film \"\", but turned it down because she was pregnant. Their daughter, Dylan Penn, was born in April 1991. She backed out of the role of Abby McDeere in \"The Firm\" (1993) due to her pregnancy with her second child. Their son, Hopper Jack, was born in August 1993.\nAfter breaking up and getting back together, Wright and Penn married in 1996. Their on-and-off relationship seemingly ended in divorce plans, announced in December 2007. The divorce petition was withdrawn four months later at the couple's request. In February 2009, Wright and Penn attended the 81st Academy Awards together, at which Penn won the Best Actor award. Penn filed for legal separation in April 2009, but withdrew the petition in May. In August 2009, Wright filed for divorce, declaring she had no plans to reconcile. The divorce was finalized in July 2010.\nIn February 2012, Wright began dating actor Ben Foster. Their engagement was announced in January 2014. The couple called off their engagement in November 2014, but reunited in January 2015. In August 2015, they announced they were ending their second engagement.\nIn 2017, Wright began dating Cl\u00e9ment Giraudet, an Yves Saint Laurent executive. They secretly wed in August 2018 in La Roche-sur-le-Buis, France. Wright filed for divorce from Giraudet in September 2022.\nRobin is currently dating British-Australian architect Henry Smith. The couple moved to England, and Wright described Smith as \"a sweet guy and a decent, good adult.\" Although she is happy in the relationship, the actress considers marrying again unnecessary.\nPhilanthropy and activism.\nWright is the honorary spokesperson for the Dallas, Texas-based non-profit The Gordie Foundation.\nIn 2014, she co-partnered with two California-based companies: Pour Les Femmes and The SunnyLion. The SunnyLion donates a portion of its profits to the Raise Hope For Congo movement.\nWright is an activist for human rights in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. She is the narrator and executive producer of the documentary \"When Elephants Fight\", which highlights how multinational mining corporations and politicians in the Democratic Republic of the Congo threaten human rights, and perpetuate conflict in the region.\nShe is a supporter of \"Stand with Congo\", the human rights campaign behind the film. In 2016, Wright spoke publicly in support of the campaign at a film-screening at the Tribeca Film Institute in New York City, in media interviews, with journalists, and across her social media accounts.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He pursued a diverse range of styles as a solo artist and as a member of the synth-based band Yellow Magic Orchestra (YMO). With his YMO bandmates Haruomi Hosono and Yukihiro Takahashi, Sakamoto influenced and pioneered a number of electronic music genres. As a film score composer, Sakamoto won an Academy Award (Oscar), BAFTA, Grammy and two Golden Globe Awards.\nSakamoto began his career as a session musician, producer, and arranger while he was at the Tokyo National University of Fine Arts and Music in the mid 1970s. His first major success came in 1978 as co-founder of YMO. He pursued a solo career at the same time, releasing the experimental electronic fusion album \"Thousand Knives\" in that year, and the album \"B-2 Unit\" in 1980. \"B-2 Unit\" includes the track \"Riot in Lagos\", which had a significant influence on the development of electro, hip hop and dance music. He went on to produce more solo records, and collaborate with many international artists, including David Sylvian, DJ Spooky, Carsten Nicolai, Youssou N'Dour, and Fennesz. Sakamoto composed music for the opening ceremony of the 1992 Barcelona Summer Olympic Games, and his composition \"Energy Flow\" (1999) was the first instrumental number-one single in Japan's Oricon charts history.\n\"Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence\" (1983) marked his debut as both an actor and a film score composer; its main theme was adapted into the single \"Forbidden Colours\" which became an international hit. His most successful work as a film composer was \"The Last Emperor\" (1987), for which he won the Academy Award for Best Original Score, making him the first Japanese composer to win an Academy Award. He continued earning accolades composing for films such as \"The Sheltering Sky\" (1990), \"Little Buddha\" (1993), and \"The Revenant\" (2015). On occasion, Sakamoto also worked as a composer and a scenario writer on anime and video games. He was awarded the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres from the Ministry of Culture of France in 2009 for his contributions to music. Sakamoto died on March 28, 2023 from colorectal cancer at the age of 71.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nEarly life.\nRyuichi Sakamoto was born on January 17, 1952, in Tokyo. His father, Kazuki Sakamoto, was a well-known literary editor, and his mother, Keiko (Shimomura) Sakamoto, designed women's hats. He began taking piano lessons at age 6, and started to compose at age 10. His early influences included Johann Sebastian Bach and Claude Debussy \u2014 whom he once called \"the door to all 20th century music.\" He also said, \"Asian music\" (Javanese Gamelan) \"heavily influenced Debussy, and Debussy heavily influenced me. So, the music goes around the world and comes full circle.\"\nHe discovered jazz and rock and roll as a teenager, when he fell in with a crowd of hipster rebels. He was also influenced by jazz musicians such as John Coltrane and Ornette Coleman, and by rock bands such as The Beatles and The Rolling Stones. He described his political leanings during his time as a student as \"not a 100 percent Marxist, but kind of\". At the height of the Japanese student protest movement, he and Yasuhisa Shiozaki along with dozens of other classmates barricaded themselves in their high school principals's office, seeking changes to the way the school was run.\nSakamoto entered the Tokyo National University of Fine Arts and Music in 1970, earning a B.A. in music composition in 1974 and a M.A. in 1976, with special emphasis on both electronic and ethnic music. He studied ethnomusicology there with the intention of becoming a researcher in the field, due to his interest in various world music traditions, particularly the Japanese, Okinawan, Indian, Indonesian and African musical traditions. He was also trained in classical music and began experimenting with the electronic music equipment available at the university, including synthesizers such as the Buchla, Moog, and ARP.\nSolo career.\n1970s.\nIn 1975, Sakamoto collaborated with percussionist Tsuchitori Toshiyuki to release \"Disappointment-Hateruma\". In 1977, Sakamoto began working as a session musician with Haruomi Hosono and Yukihiro Takahashi. Together, the trio formed the electronic band Yellow Magic Orchestra (YMO) in 1978.\nIn mid-1978, Sakamoto released his first solo album \"Thousand Knives of Ry\u016bichi Sakamoto\", with the help of Hideki Matsutake\u2014Hosono also contributed to the song \"Thousand Knives\". The album experimented with different styles, such as \"Thousand Knives\" and \"The End of Asia\"\u2014in which electronic music was fused with traditional Japanese music\u2014while \"Grasshoppers\" is a more minimalistic piano song. The album was recorded from April to July 1978 with a variety of electronic musical instruments, including various synthesizers, such as the KORG PS-3100, a polyphonic synthesizer; the Oberheim Eight Voice; the Moog III-C; the Polymoog, the Minimoog; the Micromoog; the Korg VC-10, which is a vocoder; the KORG SQ-10, which is an analog sequencer; the Syn-Drums, an electronic drum kit; and the microprocessor-based Roland MC-8 Microcomposer, which is a music sequencer that was programmed by Matsutake and played by Sakamoto.\n1980s.\nIn 1980, Sakamoto released his second solo album, \"B-2 Unit\", which has been referred to as his \"edgiest\" record and is known for the electronic track \"Riot in Lagos\", which is considered an early example of electro music (electro-funk), as Sakamoto anticipated the beats and sounds of electro. Early electro and hip hop artists, such as Afrika Bambaataa and Kurtis Mantronik, were influenced by the album\u2014especially \"Riot in Lagos\"\u2014with Mantronik citing the work as a major influence on his electro hip hop group Mantronix. \"Riot in Lagos\" was later included in Playgroup's compilation album \"Kings of Electro\" (2007), alongside other significant electro compositions, such as Hashim's \"Al-Naafyish\" (1983). The album is also credited with introducing the influential Roland TR-808 drum machine \"in the clubs for the first time\" with \"a new body music\" that \"foretold the future\" of music according to Mary Anne Hobbs of BBC Radio 6 Music.\nAccording to \"Dusted Magazine\", Sakamoto's use of squelching bounce sounds and mechanical beats was later incorporated in early electro and hip hop productions, such as \"Message II (Survival)\" by Melle Mel and Duke Bootee (1982), \"Magic's Wand\" (1982) by Whodini and Thomas Dolby, \"Electric Kingdom\" (1983) by Twilight 22, and \"The Album\" (1985) by Mantronix. The 1980 release of \"Riot in Lagos\" was listed by \"The Guardian\" in 2011 as one of the 50 key important events in the history of dance music, at number six on its list. \"Resident Advisor\" said the track anticipated the sounds of techno and hip hop music, and that it inspired numerous artists from cities such as Tokyo, New York City and Detroit. Peter Tasker of \"Nikkei Asia\" said it was influential on techno, hip hop and house music.\nOne of the tracks on \"B-2 Unit\", \"Differencia\" has, according to \"Fact\", \"relentless tumbling beats and a stabbing bass synth that foreshadows jungle by nearly a decade\". Some tracks on the album also foreshadow genres such as IDM, broken beat, and industrial techno, and the work of producers such as Actress and Oneohtrix Point Never. For several tracks on the album, Sakamoto worked with UK reggae producer Dennis Bovell, incorporating elements of Afrobeat and dub music. According to\" Pitchfork\", \"\"B-2 Unit\" still sounds futuristic\" with tracks such as \"E-3A\" looking \"ahead to Mouse on Mars\u2019 idyllic \u201990s electronica.\"\nAlso in 1980, Sakamoto released the single \"War Head/Lexington Queen\", an experimental synthpop and electro record. His collaboration with Kiyoshiro Imawano, \"Ikenai Rouge Magic\", also topped the Oricon singles chart. Sakamoto also began a long-standing collaboration with David Sylvian, when he co-wrote and performed on the Japan track \"Taking Islands in Africa\" in 1980.\nIn 1981, Sakamoto collaborated with Talking Heads and King Crimson guitarist Adrian Belew and Robin Scott for an album titled \"Left-Handed Dream\". According to \"The Baffler\", the album combined \"slow, simmering, primeval\" techno with \"sprawling, raw-edged sci-fi gagaku\" using traditional Japanese taiko drums.\nSakamoto worked on another collaboration with Sylvian, a single entitled \"Bamboo Houses/Bamboo Music\" in 1982. The song \"Bamboo Houses\" in particular \"accidentally predicted\" grime music according to \"Fact\" magazine, calling it \"the earliest example of proto-grime\" with similarities to the Sinogrime subgenre which Wiley and Jammer were known for in the 2000s. Sakamoto's earlier 1978 songs \"Grasshoppers\" and \"The End of Asia\" from \"Thousand Knives\" also have melodic lines similar to grime or Sinogrime.\nSakamoto began work on his next album \"Ongaku Zukan\" in 1982, but it didn't release until 1984. During production, he was one of the first musicians to use the Yamaha DX7, the same year the digital synthesizer released in 1983. He initially used the DX7 for Mari Iijima's debut city pop album \"Ros\u00e9\", released in 1983, before using it for his solo album \"Ongaku Zukan\", which eventually released in 1984.\nSakamoto broadened his musical range with a number of solo albums such \"Ongaku Zukan\" (1984), \"Neo Geo\" (1987), and \"Beauty\" (1989). These albums included collaborations with artists such as Thomas Dolby, Iggy Pop, Youssou N'Dour, and Brian Wilson.\nIn 1985, Sakamoto was commissioned to score a dance composition by New York choreographer Molissa Fenley called \"Esperanto\". The performance itself debuted at the Joyce Theater, to mixed reviews from Anna Kisselgoff at \"The New York Times\" which said of Sakamoto's music, that \"The sound often resembles a radio shut on and off.\"\nThe score was subsequently released in Japan by Midi, Inc., and includes contributions from Arto Lindsay and YAS-KAZ. Jen Monroe of \"The Baffler\" said the sample-based music \"manages to be unremittingly gorgeous, aggressive, angular, and lush.\"\n1990s.\n\"Heartbeat\" (1991) and \"Sweet Revenge\" (1994) feature Sakamoto's collaborations with a global range of artists such as Roddy Frame, Dee Dee Brave, Marco Prince, Arto Lindsay, Youssou N'Dour, David Sylvian, and Ingrid Chavez. In 1992, Sakamoto composed music for the opening ceremony of the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, Spain.\nIn 1995, Sakamoto released \"Smoochy\", described by the \"Sound on Sound\" website as Sakamoto's \"excursion into the land of easy-listening and Latin\", followed by the \"1996\" album, which featured a number of previously released pieces arranged for solo piano, violin, and cello. During December 1996 Sakamoto, composed the entirety of an hour-long orchestral work entitled \"Untitled 01\" and released as the album \"Discord\" (1998). The Sony Classical release of \"Discord\" was sold in a jewel case that was covered by a blue-colored slipcase made of foil, while the CD also contained a data video track. In 1998 the Ninja Tune record label released the \"Prayer/Salvation Remixes\", for which prominent electronica artists such as Ashley Beedle and Andrea Parker remixed sections from the \"Prayer\" and \"Salvation\" parts of \"Discord\". Sakamoto collaborated primarily with guitarist David Torn and DJ Spooky\u2014artist Laurie Anderson provides spoken word on the composition\u2014and the recording was condensed from nine live performances of the work, recorded during a Japanese tour. \"Discord\" was divided into four parts: \"Grief\", \"Anger\", \"Prayer\", and \"Salvation\"; Sakamoto explained in 1998 that he was \"not religious, but maybe spiritual\" and \"The Prayer is to anybody or anything you want to name.\" Sakamoto further explained:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The themes of Prayer and Salvation came out of the feelings of sadness and frustration that I expressed in the first two movements, about the fact that people are starving in the world, and we are not able to help them. People are dying, and yet the political and economical and historical situations are too complicated and inert for us to do much about it. So I got really angry with myself. I asked myself what I could do, and since there's not a lot I can do on the practical level, all that's left for me is to pray. But it's not enough just to pray; I also had to think about actually saving those people, so the last movement is called Salvation. That's the journey of the piece.\nIn 1998, Italian ethnomusicologist Massimo Milano published \"Ryuichi Sakamoto. Conversazioni\" through the Padova, Arcana imprint. All three editions of the book were published in the Italian language. Sakamoto's next album, \"BTTB\" (1999)\u2014an acronym for \"Back to the Basics\" is comprised a series of original pieces on solo piano influenced by Debussy and Satie and includes \"Energy Flow\" (a major hit in Japan) and an arrangement of the Yellow Magic Orchestra classic \"Tong Poo\".\nSakamoto's long-awaited \"opera\" \"LIFE\" was released in 1999, with visual direction by Shiro Takatani, artistic director of Dumb Type. This ambitious multi-genre multi-media project featured contributions from Pina Bausch, Bernardo Bertolucci, Josep Carreras, Salif Keita, the Dalai Lama, Salman Rushdie and Daniel Taylor. In 2007, they \"deconstructed\" all the visual images and the sound, to create an art installation.\n2000s.\nIn the early 2000s, Sakamoto did extensive work in experimental ambient and glitch music. His works in these genres at the time include collaborations with Fennesz.\nSakamoto teamed with cellist Jaques Morelenbaum and singer Paula Morelenbaum, on a pair of albums celebrating the work of bossa nova pioneer Antonio Carlos Jobim. They recorded their first album, \"Casa\" (2001), mostly in Jobim's home studio in Rio de Janeiro, with Sakamoto performing on the late Jobim's grand piano. The album was well received, having been included in the list of \"The New York Times\"'s top albums of 2002. A live album, \"Live in Tokyo\", and a second album, \"A Day in New York\", soon followed. Sakamoto and the Morelenbaums would also collaborate on N.M.L. No More Landmine, an international effort to raise awareness for the removal of landmines. The trio would release the single \"Zero Landmine\", which also featured David Sylvian, Brian Eno, Kraftwerk, Cyndi Lauper, and Haruomi Hosono and Yukihiro Takahashi, the other two founding members of Yellow Magic Orchestra.\nSakamoto collaborated with Alva Noto (an alias of Carsten Nicolai) to release \"Vrioon\", an album of Sakamoto's piano clusters treated by Nicolai's unique style of digital manipulation, involving the creation of \"micro-loops\" and minimal percussion. The two produced this work by passing the pieces back and forth until both were satisfied with the result. This debut, released on German label Raster-Noton, was voted record of the year 2004 in the electronica category by British magazine \"The Wire\". They then released \"Insen\" (2005)\u2014while produced in a similar manner to Vrioon, this album is somewhat more restrained and minimalist. After further collaboration, they released two more albums: \"utp_\" (2008) and \"Summvs\" (2011).\nIn 2005, Finnish mobile phone manufacturer Nokia hired Sakamoto to compose ring and alert tones for their high-end phone, the Nokia 8800. In 2006, Nokia offered the ringtones for free on their website. Around this time, a reunion with YMO cofounders Hosono and Takahashi caused a stir in the Japanese press. They released a single \"Rescue\" in 2007 and a DVD \"HAS/YMO\" in 2008. In July 2009, Sakamoto was honored as Officier of Ordre des Arts et des Lettres at the French embassy in Tokyo.\n2010s.\nThroughout the latter part of the 2000s, Sakamoto collaborated on several projects with visual artist Shiro Takatani, including the installations \"LIFE \u2013 fluid, invisible, inaudible...\" (2007\u20132013), commissioned by YCAM, Yamaguchi, \"collapsed\" and \"silence spins\" at the Museum of Contemporary Art Tokyo in 2012 and 2013 Sharjah Biennial (U.A.E.), \"LIFE-WELL\" in 2013, and a special version for Park Hyatt Tokyo's 20th anniversary in 2014, and he did music for the joint performance \"LIFE-WELL\" featuring the actor Noh/Kyogen Mansai Nomura, and for Shiro Takatani's performance \"ST/LL\" in 2015.\nIn 2013, Sakamoto was a jury member at the 70th Venice International Film Festival. The jury viewed 20 films and was chaired by filmmaker Bernardo Bertolucci.\nOn April 14, 2013, he also participated in a performance of film and music by video pioneer Nam June Paik, selected by musicians and composers who knew him well: himself, Stephen Vitiello, and Steina Vasulka.\nIn 2014, Sakamoto became the first guest artistic director of the Sapporo International Art Festival 2014 (SIAF2014). On July 10, Sakamoto released a statement indicating that he had been diagnosed with oropharyngeal cancer in late June of the same year. He announced a break from his work while he sought treatment and recovery. On August 3, 2015, Sakamoto posted on his website that he was \"in great shape ... I am thinking about returning to work\" and announced that he would be providing music for Yoji Yamada's \"Haha to Kuraseba\" (\"Living with My Mother\"). In 2015, Sakamoto also composed the score for the Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu's film, \"The Revenant\", for which he received a Golden Globe nomination.\nIn January 2017 it was announced that Sakamoto would release a solo album in April 2017 through Milan Records; the new album, titled \"async\", was released on March 29, 2017, to critical acclaim. In February 2018, he was selected to be on the jury for the main competition section of the 68th Berlin International Film Festival.\nOn June 14, 2018, a documentary about the life and work of Sakamoto, entitled \"\", was released. The film follows Sakamoto as he recovers from cancer and resumes creating music, protests nuclear power plants following the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Disaster, and creates field recordings in a variety of locales. He also elucidates the influence of Russian director Andrei Tarkovsky on the making of his then upcoming album async. Sakamoto says, \"When I started making the album, the sound that was in my mind was the Bach theme from \"Solaris\", arranged on synthesizers by Eduard Artemyev. I arranged the same piece in the beginning of the process for \"async\", and it sounded really good. It was very different from Artemyev's version, so I was very happy. Then I arranged four more Bach chorales next to that, and they all sounded really good. So I thought, maybe this is the album? Then I thought I needed to do something more, to write my own chorale. I tried, and that became the song \"solari\", obviously, with no \"s\". Directed by Stephen Nomura Schible, the documentary was met with critical praise. \nHe later said, \"As I've been making music and trying to go deeper and deeper, I was finally able to understand what the Tarkovsky movies are about \u2013 how symphonic they are \u2013 it's almost music. Not just the sounds \u2013 it's a symphony of moving images and sounds. They are more complex than music.\" He calls Tarkovsky and French director Robert Bresson his favorites, claiming their books \u2013 \"Notes on the Cinematographer\" and \"Sculpting in Time\", respectively \u2013 as \"[his] bible.\"\n2020s.\nIn 2021 he was associate artist of Holland Festival in Amsterdam where he presented the world premiere of \"TIME\", his last collaboration with his long-term collaborator Shiro Takatani. This \"wordless opera\", featuring dancer and actor Min Tanaka and sh\u00f4 player Mayumi Miyata was inspired by the first tale from Soseki Natsume's collection of short stories \"Ten Nights of Dreams\".\nIn 2022 he took part in the creation of Dumb Type's new installation \"2022\" as a new member of the Japanese collective, for the Japan Pavilion at the 59th International Art Exhibition \u2013 La Biennale di Venezia.\nThe same year Sakamoto collaborated with the young Ukrainian violinist Illia Bondarenko on the single \"Piece for Illia\" as part of the compilation fundraiser \"Ukraine (volume 2)\" for relief for victims of the Russian Invasion of Ukraine.\nOn April 24, 2023, the song \"Snooze\" was released by Agust D (Suga of BTS), which was dedicated to Sakamoto, who featured in the song as a keyboardist. Sakamoto also appears in the music trailers leading up to the Agust D album, \"D-Day\".\nIn 2023, filmmaker Neo Sora\u2013Sakamoto's son\u2013directed a final performance of Sakomoto playing solo piano, released as \"\". It premiered at the Venice Film Festival in 2023.\nYellow Magic Orchestra.\nAfter working as a session musician with Haruomi Hosono and Yukihiro Takahashi in 1977, the trio formed the internationally successful electronic band Yellow Magic Orchestra (YMO) in 1978. Known for their seminal influence on electronic music, the group helped pioneer electronic genres such as electropop/technopop, synthpop, cyberpunk music, ambient house, and electronica. The group's work has had a lasting influence across genres, ranging from hip hop and techno to acid house and melodic music. Sakamoto was the songwriter and composer for a number of the band's hit songs\u2014including \"Yellow Magic (Tong Poo)\" (1978), \"Technopolis\" (1979), \"Nice Age\" (1980), \"Ongaku\" (1983), and \"You've Got to Help Yourself\" (1983)\u2014while playing keyboards for many of their other songs, including international hits such as \"Computer Game/Firecracker\" (1978) and \"Rydeen\" (1979). He also sang on several songs, such as \"Kimi ni Mune Kyun\" (1983). Sakamoto's composition \"Technopolis\" (1979) was credited as a contribution to the development of techno music.\nSakamoto's internationally successful composition \"Behind the Mask\" (1978)\u2014a synthpop song in which he sang vocals through a vocoder\u2014was later covered by a number of international artists, including Michael Jackson and Eric Clapton. \"Behind the Mask\" was one of the first songs to use a gated reverb effect on the snare drum, a technique that later became popular in 1980s pop music.\nA version of Sakamoto's 1978 song \"Thousand Knives\" was released on Yellow Magic Orchestra's 1981 album \"BGM\". This version was one of the earliest uses of the Roland TR-808 drum machine, for YMO's live performance of \"1000 Knives\" in 1980 and their \"BGM\" album release in 1981.\nProduction career.\nSakamoto's production credits represent a prolific career in this role. In 1977, he was the arranger and lead keyboardist for Taeko Ohnuki's city pop album \"Sunshower\". In 1983, he produced Mari Iijima's debut city pop album \"Ros\u00e9\", shortly before Yellow Magic Orchestra disbanded. This was the first album where Sakamoto used a Yamaha DX7, making him one of the digital synthesizer's first users in its year of release, before using it for his solo album \"Ongaku Zukan\" released the following year.\nSakamoto worked with artists such as Thomas Dolby; Aztec Camera, on the \"Dreamland\" (1993) album; and Imai Miki, co-producing her 1994 album \"A Place In The Sun\". In 1996, Sakamoto produced \"Mind Circus\", the first single from actress Miki Nakatani, leading to a collaboration period spanning 9 singles and 7 albums though 2001.\nRoddy Frame, who worked with Sakamoto as a member of Aztec Camera, explained in a 1993 interview preceding the release of \"Dreamland\" that he had had to wait a lengthy period of time before he was able to work with Sakamoto, who wrote two soundtracks, a solo album and music for the opening ceremony at the Barcelona Olympics, prior to working with Frame over four weeks in a New York studio. Frame said that he was impressed by the work of YMO and the \"Merry Christmas Mr Lawrence\" soundtrack, explaining: \"That's where you realise that the atmosphere around his compositions is actually in the writing \u2013 it's got nothing to do with synthesisers.\" Frame's decision to ask Sakamoto was finalized after he saw his performance at the Japan Festival that was held in London, United Kingdom. Of his experience recording with Sakamoto, Frame said:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;He's got this reputation as a boffin, a professor of music who sits in front of a computer screen. But he's more intuitive than that, and he's always trying to corrupt what he knows. Halfway through the day in the studio, he will stop and play some hip hop or some house for 10 minutes, and then go back to what he was doing. He's always trying to trip himself up like that, and to discover new things. Just before we worked together he'd been out in Borneo, I think, with a DAT machine, looking for new sounds.\nIn 1994, Japan Football Association asked Ryuichi Sakamoto to compose the instrumental song \"Japanese Soccer Anthem\". The composition was played at the beginning of Japan Football Association-sponsored events.\nSakamoto also produced video game music. In 1989, he composed music for one of the first CD-ROM games, ' for the PC Engine. In 1998, he composed the startup sound for Sega's Dreamcast console. In the 2000s, he composed music for the Dreamcast game ' (2000) and the PlayStation 2 games \"Seven Samurai 20XX\" (2004) and \"Dawn of Mana\" (2006).\nFilm career.\nSakamoto began working in films, as a composer and actor, in Nagisa Oshima's \"Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence\" (1983), where he starred alongside David Bowie. The film's score is best known for Sakamoto's \"Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence\" instrumental theme. He collaborated with David Sylvian on a vocal version of the theme, \"Forbidden Colours\"\u2013which became a chart hit in the UK. In a 2016 interview, Sakamoto reflected on his time acting in the film, saying he \"hung out\" with Bowie every evening for a month while filming on location. He remembered Bowie as \"straightforward\" and \"nice\" while lamenting that he never mustered the courage to ask for Bowie's help while scoring the film's soundtrack as he believed Bowie was too \"concentrated\" on acting.\nHe was the subject of Elizabeth Lennard's 1985 documentary \"Tokyo Melody\", which mixes studio footage and interviews with Sakamoto about his musical philosophy in a nonlinear format, against a backdrop of 1980s Tokyo. Sakamoto later composed Bernardo Bertolucci's \"The Last Emperor\" (1987), which earned him an Academy Award and Grammy Award with fellow composers David Byrne and Cong Su. In that same year, Sakamoto composed the score to the cult-classic anime film \"\". He also composed the music for the original Japanese version of \"The Adventures of Chatran\".\nOther films scored by Sakamoto include Bertolucci's \"The Sheltering Sky\" (1990) and \"The Little Buddha\" (1993); Pedro Almod\u00f3var's \"High Heels\" (1991); Oliver Stone's \"Wild Palms\" (1993); John Maybury's \"\" (1998); Brian De Palma's \"Snake Eyes\" (1998) and \"Femme Fatale\" (2002); Oshima's \"Gohatto\" (1999); Jun Ichikawa's (director of the Mitsui ReHouse commercial from 1997 to 1999 starring Chizuru Ikewaki and Mao Inoue) \"Tony Takitani\" (2005);, Hwang Dong-hyuk's, \"The Fortress\" (2017); and Andrew Levitas's \"Minamata\" (2020) starring Johnny Depp, Minami, and Bill Nighy.\nSeveral tracks from Sakamoto's earlier solo albums have also appeared in film soundtracks. In particular, variations of \"Chinsagu No Hana\" (from \"Beauty\") and \"Bibo No Aozora\" (from \"1996\") provide the poignant closing pieces for Sue Brooks's \"Japanese Story\" (2003) and Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu's \"Babel\" (2006), respectively. In 2015, Sakamoto teamed up with I\u00f1\u00e1rritu to score his film, \"The Revenant\", starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hardy. The film \"Monster\" by director Hirokazu Kore-eda, released in 2023, was Sakamoto's final score; the film is dedicated to his memory.\nAccording to \"Resident Advisor\", Sakamoto's classical compositions were influential in helping to define modern classical music. Sakamoto's classical compositions\u2014especially \"Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence\" and \"Bibi no Aozara\"\u2014have been covered and sampled by numerous musicians.\nSakamoto also acted in several films: perhaps his most notable performance was as the conflicted Captain Yonoi in \"Merry Christmas Mr Lawrence\", alongside Takeshi Kitano and British rock singer David Bowie. He also played roles in \"The Last Emperor\" (as Masahiko Amakasu) and Madonna's \"Rain\" music video.\nPersonal life.\nIn 1972, Sakamoto married Natsuko Sakamoto, with whom he had a daughter. The couple divorced in 1982, when Sakamoto married Japanese pianist and singer Akiko Yano, following several musical collaborations with her including touring work with the Yellow Magic Orchestra. Together, they had a daughter, the singer Miu Sakamoto. Sakamoto's second marriage ended in August 2006, 14 years after a mutual decision to live separately. He then married his manager, Norika Sora, with whom he had one child, Neo Sora, an artist and filmmaker. Sakamoto lived primarily in New York City from 1990 until 2020, when he returned to Tokyo.\nHealth and death.\nBeginning in June 2014, Sakamoto took a year-long break after he was diagnosed with oropharyngeal cancer. In 2015, he returned, saying, \"Right now I'm good. I feel better. Much, much better. I feel energy inside, but you never know. The cancer might come back in three years, five years, maybe 10 years. Also the radiation makes your immune system really low. It means I'm very susceptible to another cancer in my body.\"\nOn January 21, 2021, Sakamoto shared a letter on his website announcing that though his throat cancer had gone into remission, he had been diagnosed with rectal cancer, and was undergoing treatment after a successful surgery. He wrote, \"From now on, I will be living alongside cancer. But, I am hoping to make music for a little while longer.\"\nSakamoto died from cancer on March 28, 2023, at the age of 71. His death was announced on April 2, after his funeral had taken place.\nActivism.\nSakamoto was a member of the anti-nuclear organization Stop Rokkasho and demanded the closing of the Hamaoka Nuclear Power Plant. In 2012, he organized the No Nukes 2012 concert, which featured performances by 18 groups, including Yellow Magic Orchestra and Kraftwerk. Sakamoto was also known as a critic of copyright law, arguing in 2009 that it is antiquated in the Information Age. He argued that in \"the last 100 years, only a few organizations have dominated the music world and ripped off both fans and creators\" and that \"with the internet we are going back to having tribal attitudes towards music.\"\nIn 2015, Sakamoto also supported opposition to the relocation of Marine Corps Air Station Futenma in the \u014cmura Bay in Henoko, with a new and Okinawan version of his 2004 single \"Undercooled\" whose sales partially contributed to the \"Henoko Fund\", aimed to stop the relocation of the base on Okinawa.\nSakamoto was also an environmentalist. In one of his last public activities before his death, he sent a letter to Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike in early March 2023 calling for the suspension and review of the planned redevelopment of the Jing\u016bmae neighborhood in Tokyo due to environmental concerns.\ncommmons.\nIn 2006, Sakamoto, in collaboration with Japanese music company Avex Group, founded , a record label seeking to change the manner in which music is produced. Sakamoto explained that \"commmons\" was not his label but is a platform for all aspiring artists to join as equal collaborators to share the benefits of the music industry. On the initiative's \"About\" page, the label is described as a project that \"aims to find new possibilities for music, while making meaningful contribution to culture and society\". The name \"commmons\" is spelt with three \"m\"s because the third \"m\" stands for music.\nAwards and nominations.\nSakamoto won a number of awards for his work as a film composer, beginning with the BAFTA Award for Best Film Music for his score for \"Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence,\" in 1984. His greatest award success was for scoring \"The Last Emperor\" (1987), which won him the Academy Award for Best Original Score, Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score, and Grammy Award for Best Score Soundtrack Album for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media, as well as a BAFTA nomination in 1989.\nHis score for \"The Sheltering Sky\" (1990) won him his second Golden Globe Award, and his score for \"Little Buddha\" (1993) received another Grammy Award nomination. In 1997, his collaboration with Toshio Iwai, \"Music Plays Images X Images Play Music\", was awarded the Golden Nica, the grand prize of the Prix Ars Electronica competition. He also contributed to the Academy Award winning soundtrack for \"Babel\" (2006) with several pieces of music, including the closing theme \"Bibo no Aozora\". In 2009, he was awarded the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres from France's Ministry of Culture for his musical contributions. His score for \"The Revenant\" (2015) was nominated for the Golden Globe and BAFTA, and won Best Musical Score from the Dallas\u2013Fort Worth Film Critics Association.\nSakamoto won the Golden Pine Award (Lifetime Achievement) at the 2013 International Samobor Film Music Festival, along with Clint Eastwood and Gerald Fried.\nDiscography.\nSolo studio albums\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He first appeared in his eponymous comic strip in 1953, and is one of the longest-running characters, characterised by his tactics for avoiding responsibility and his parents' rules, or simply making chores easier, usually with the help of instructional \"dodge\" books.\nCharacter background.\nKen Reid was recommended to DC Thomson by his brother-in-law Bill Holroyd, who illustrated for \"The Beano\". Reid travelled to Dundee and was first tasked to design comic strip panels for a new character: a boy who did anything to evade responsibilities and favours.\nAfter the design was approved, a three-panel advertisement printed in issue 560, showing Roger failing to sneak out the house before his father noticing, finding out instantly that his father had set up a tripwire. The caption revealed this was a teaser to a new comic strip called \"Roger the Dodger\", boasting, \"You really think his dad has really caught him dodging his homework, don't you? JUST YOU WAIT! ROGER ISN'T FINISHED YET!\"\nCharacteristics.\nUnlike most Beano characters, Roger does not intentionally cause chaos and mayhem, despite his attempts at dodging responsibilities and punishments often creating it. Ken Reid's early stories frequently had Roger get caught by his family members, that do not hesitate with the cruelty of their vengeance. Reid's final panels would show Roger being forced to do his chore (or clean up after his antics create more damage than intended) as a family member (usually his father) supervises with a smirk. In earlier strips, Roger would often be spanked by his father's slipper as punishment.\nRoger has dark hair with a shaggy tuft at the front. He wears a red-and-black chequered jumper over his white, collared shirt. Initially he wore a tie, but this was discontinued in the 21st century, as well as the black shorts he also wore, that were changed to black trousers in the 1970s.\nPublication history.\nHe first appeared in issue 561, dated 18 April 1953. His appearance is vaguely similar to that of Dennis the Menace from the same magazine: he wears a black-and-red chequered jumper and black trousers, but takes better care of his hair than his equally mischievous counterpart. He also used to have a white tie, but it seems to have disappeared. Originally drawn by Ken Reid, Gordon Bell took over in 1959, but Roger dodged his way out of the Beano in 1960. He returned, drawn by Bob McGrath, in April 1961. Ken Reid was re-commissioned to draw the strip in 1962, and Robert Nixon when Reid left D. C. Thomson &amp; Co. in 1964. When Nixon left in 1973, Tom Lavery began drawing the strip, who was then followed by Frank McDiarmid in 1976.\nTen years later, after Euan Kerr took over as Beano editor, Nixon returned, drawing in a noticeably different style from the one before. Roger's strip was given a second page in 1986. Between 1986 and 1992, a spin-off strip appeared at the end called \"Roger the Dodger's Dodge Clinic\". Readers would write in with problems, and Roger would try to find a dodge for it (which would usually go wrong). Winning suggestions would win a transistor radio and special scroll. Roger is often shown in other Beano characters' stories offering \"help\", which he took to a new level in Beano issue 2648 from April 1993. This issue marked Roger's 40th birthday, and to celebrate he made appearances in every strip in the comic.\nNixon continued drawing it until his death in October 2002, though due to the strips being drawn months in advance, his strips continued appearing in the Beano until the end of January 2003, when artist Barrie Appleby took over. He drew the strip until 2011, when he stopped to concentrate on Dennis and Gnasher, though Trevor Metcalfe drew a few strips in 2003 and 2004, and there have also been some Robert Nixon reprints during 2005 and 2006. Since Appleby stopped drawing Roger, the comic has run reprints of Robert Nixon strips from the 1980s. Along with the Nixon reprints, Roger's Dodge Diary was introduced on the second half of Roger's pages, where Beano readers can send in their own dodges. In each one, Roger says a good thing, a bad thing and the results of the dodge. When the Beano was revamped on 8 August 2012, Appleby started drawing Roger again and Roger's parents were made younger. In the 75th birthday issue released on 24 July 2013, Jamie Smart took over as artist. On 9 April 2014, Wayne Thompson replaced Jamie Smart as Roger's artist, until Barrie Appleby returned to draw the strip temporarily, before Wayne Thompson surprisingly returned. In 2017, writing duties for the strip were taken over by Danny Pearson.\nRoger is currently the second-longest-running character in the Beano, behind only Dennis the Menace. However, if taken into account the strip's absence in 1960 then he would be the third-longest-running behind Minnie the Minx.\nTimeline.\n18 April 1953: Roger The Dodger made his debut in issue 561, drawn by Ken Reid.\n1959: Gordon Bell becomes the artist.\n1960: Roger's first series ends.\nApril 1961: Roger returns to the Beano, drawn by Bob McGrath.\n1962: Reid becomes Roger's artist again.\n1964: Robert Nixon takes over.\n1973: Tom Lavery takes over.\ncirca.1975 Roger starts wearing trousers full-time&lt;br&gt;\n1976: Frank McDiarmid takes over.\n1986: Nixon returns to draw Roger again, he moves to two pages and Roger The Dodger's Dodge Clinic is introduced.\n1992: Roger The Dodger's Dodge Clinic ends.\nApril 1993: Roger's 40th anniversary is celebrated.\nJanuary 2003: Barrie Appleby takes over after Nixon's death.\n2011: Appleby stops drawing Roger to focus on Dennis and Gnasher, and Roger's Dodge Diary is introduced alongside Nixon reprints.\n2012: Appleby resumes drawing Roger after Nigel Parkinson takes over Dennis and Gnasher.\nJuly 2013: Jamie Smart takes over as artist.\nApril 2014: Wayne Thompson takes over as artist.\nJuly 2014: Barrie Appleby returns as artist.\nApril 2023: Roger's 70th anniversary is celebrated.\nIn other media.\nTV.\nRoger appears on the cover of 1994's \"Beano Videostars\" but not on the video itself.

{"id": "26275", "revid": "49353319", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26275", "title": "Robert Nozick", "text": "American political philosopher (1938\u20132002)\nRobert Nozick (; November 16, 1938\u00a0\u2013 January 23, 2002) was an American philosopher. He held the Joseph Pellegrino University Professorship at Harvard University, and was president of the American Philosophical Association. He is best known for his book \"Anarchy, State, and Utopia\" (1974), a libertarian answer to John Rawls' \"A Theory of Justice\" (1971), in which Nozick proposes his minimal state as the only justifiable form of government. His later work \"Philosophical Explanations\" (1981) advanced notable epistemological claims, namely his counterfactual theory of knowledge. It won Phi Beta Kappa society's Ralph Waldo Emerson Award the following year.\nNozick's other work involved ethics, decision theory, philosophy of mind, metaphysics and epistemology. His final work before his death, \"Invariances\" (2001), introduced his theory of evolutionary cosmology, by which he argues invariances, and hence objectivity itself, emerged through evolution across possible worlds.\nPersonal life.\nNozick was born in Brooklyn to a family of Jewish descent. His mother was born Sophie Cohen, and his father was a Jew from a Russian shtetl who had been born with the name Cohen and who ran a small business.\nNozick attended the public schools in Brooklyn. He was then educated at Columbia University (A.B. 1959, \"summa cum laude\"), where he studied with Sidney Morgenbesser; Princeton University (PhD 1963) under Carl Hempel; and at Oxford University as a Fulbright Scholar (1963\u20131964). He was a visiting fellow at St Catherine's College, Oxford in 1997.\nAt one point, Nozick joined the Young People's Socialist League, and at Columbia University he founded the local chapter of the Student League for Industrial Democracy. He began to move away from socialist ideals when exposed to Friedrich Hayek's \"The Constitution of Liberty\", claiming he \"was pulled into libertarianism reluctantly\" when he found himself unable to form satisfactory responses to libertarian arguments. Nozick was initiated into the Alpha-Tau chapter of the Kappa Sigma fraternity while at Columbia in 1956.\nAfter receiving his undergraduate degree in 1959, he married Barbara Fierer. They had two children, Emily and David. The Nozicks eventually divorced; Nozick later married the poet Gjertrud Schnackenberg.\nNozick died in 2002 after a prolonged struggle with stomach cancer. He was interred at Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge, Massachusetts.\nCareer and works.\nPolitical philosophy.\nNozick's first book, \"Anarchy, State, and Utopia\" (1974), argues that only a minimal state limited to the functions of protection against \"force, fraud, theft, and administering courts of law\" can be justified, as any more extensive state would violate people's individual rights.\nNozick believed that a distribution of goods is just when brought about by free exchange among consenting adults, trading from a baseline position where the principles of entitlement theory are upheld. In one example, Nozick uses the example of basketball player Wilt Chamberlain to show that even when large inequalities subsequently emerge from the processes of free transfer (i.e. paying extra money just to watch Wilt Chamberlain play), the resulting distributions are just so long as all consenting parties have freely consented to such exchanges.\n\"Anarchy, State, and Utopia\" is often contrasted to John Rawls's \"A Theory of Justice\" in popular academic discourse, as it challenged the partial conclusion of Rawls's difference principle, that \"social and economic inequalities are to be arranged so that they are to be of greatest benefit to the least-advantaged members of society\".\nNozick's philosophy also claims to heritage from John Locke's \"Second Treatise on Government\" and seeks to ground Locke's state of nature, but breaks distinctly with Locke on the question of self-ownership by attempting to secularize his doctrine of natural law without accepting it. Instead, Nozick appealed to the second formulation of Immanuel Kant's categorical imperative: that people should be treated as an end in themselves, not merely as a means to an end. Nozick terms this the 'separateness of persons', saying that \"there is no social entity...there are only individual people\", and that we ought to \"respect and take account of the fact that [each individual] is a separate person\".\nMost controversially, Nozick argued that consistent application of libertarian self-ownership would allow for consensual, non-coercive enslavement contracts between adults. He rejected the notion of inalienable rights advanced by Locke and most contemporary capitalist-oriented libertarian academics, writing in \"Anarchy, State, and Utopia\" that the typical notion of a \"free system\" would allow individuals to voluntarily enter into non-coercive slave contracts.\n\"Anarchy, State, and Utopia\" received a National Book Award in the category of Philosophy and Religion in the year following its original publication.\nThought experiments regarding utilitarianism.\nEarly sections of \"Anarchy, State, and Utopia\", akin to the introduction of \"A Theory of Justice\", see Nozick implicitly join Rawls's attempts to discredit utilitarianism. Nozick's case differs somewhat in that it mainly targets hedonism and relies on a variety of thought experiments, although both works draw from Kantian principles.\nMost famously, Nozick introduced the experience machine in an attempt to show that ethical hedonism is not truly what individuals desire, nor what we ought to desire:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;There are also substantial puzzles when we ask what matters other than how people's experiences feel \"from the inside.\" Suppose there were an experience machine that would give you any experience you desired. Superduper neuropsychologists could stimulate your brain so that you would think and feel you were writing a great novel, or making a friend, or reading an interesting book. All the time you would be floating in a tank, with electrodes attached to your brain. Should you plug into this machine for life, preprogramming your life's experiences?\nNozick claims that life in an experience machine would have no value, and provides several explanations as to why this might be, including (but not limited to): the want to do certain things, and not just have the experience of doing them; the want to actually become a certain sort of person; and that plugging into an experience machine limits us to a man-made reality.\nAnother thought experiment Nozick proposes is the utility monster, designed to show that average utilitarianism could lead to a situation where the needs of the vast majority were sacrificed for one individual. In his exploration of deontological ethics and animal rights, Nozick coins the phrase \"utilitarianism for animals, Kantianism for people\", wherein the separateness of individual humans is acknowledged but the only moral metric assigned to animals is that of maximizing pleasure:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;[Utilitarianism for animals, Kantianism for people] says: (1) maximize the total happiness of all living beings; (2) place stringent side constraints on what one may do to human beings.\nBefore introducing the utility monster, Nozick raises a hypothetical scenario where someone might, \"by some strange causal connection\", kill 10,000 unowned cows painlessly by snapping their fingers, asking whether it would be morally wrong to do so. On the calculus of pleasure that \"utilitarianism for animals, Kantianism for people\" uses, assuming the death of these cows could be used to provide pleasure for humans in some way, then the (painless) deaths of the cows would be morally permissible as it has no negative impact upon the utilitarian equation.\nNozick later explicitly raises the example of utility monsters to \"embarrass [utilitarian theory]\": since humans benefit from the mass sacrifice and consumption of animals, and also possess the ability to kill them painlessly (i.e., without any negative effect on the utilitarian calculation of net pleasure), it is permissible to humans to maximize their consumption of meat so long as they derive pleasure from it. Nozick takes issue with this as it makes animals \"too subordinate\" to humans, counter to his view that animals ought to \"count for something\".a\nEpistemology.\nIn \"Philosophical Explanations\" (1981), Nozick provided novel accounts of knowledge, free will, personal identity, the nature of value, and the meaning of life. He also put forward an epistemological system which attempted to deal with both the Gettier problem and those posed by skepticism. This highly influential argument eschewed justification as a necessary requirement for knowledge.\nNozick gives four conditions for S's knowing that P (S=Subject / P=Proposition):\nNozick's third and fourth conditions are counterfactuals. He called this the \"tracking theory\" of knowledge. Nozick believed the counterfactual conditionals bring out an important aspect of our intuitive grasp of knowledge: For any given fact, the believer's method (M) must reliably track the truth despite varying relevant conditions. In this way, Nozick's theory is similar to reliabilism. Due to certain counterexamples that could otherwise be raised against these counterfactual conditions, Nozick specified that:\nA major feature of Nozick's theory of knowledge is his rejection of the principle of deductive closure. This principle states that if S knows X and S knows that X implies Y, then S knows Y. Nozick's truth tracking conditions do not allow for the principle of deductive closure.\nLater works.\n\"The Examined Life\" (1989), aimed towards a more general audience, explores themes of love, the impact of death, questions of faith, the nature of reality, and the meaning of life. The book takes its name from the quote by Socrates, that \"the unexamined life is not worth living\". In it, Nozick attempts to find meaning in everyday experiences, and considers how we might come to feel \"more real\". In this pursuit, Nozick discusses the death of his father, reappraises the experience machine, and proposes \"the matrix of reality\" as a means of understanding how individuals might better connect with reality in their own lives.\n\"The Nature of Rationality\" (1993) presents a theory of practical reason that attempts to embellish classical decision theory. In this work, Nozick grapples with Newcomb's problem and the Prisoner's Dilemma, and introduces the concept of symbolic utility to explain how actions might symbolize certain ideas, rather than being carried out to maximize expected utility in the future.\n\"Socratic Puzzles\" (1997) is a collection of Nozick's previous papers alongside some new essays. While the discussions are quite disparate, the essays generally draw from Nozick's previous interests in both politics and philosophy. Notably, this includes Nozick's 1983 review of \"The Case for Animal Rights\" by Tom Regan, where he says animal rights activists are often considered \"cranks\" and appears to go back on the vegetarian position he previously maintained in \"Anarchy, State and Utopia\".\nNozick's final work, \"Invariances\" (2001), applies insights from physics and biology to questions of objectivity in such areas as the nature of necessity and moral value. Nozick introduces his theory of truth, in which he leans towards a deflationary theory of truth, but argues that objectivity arises through being invariant under various transformations. For example, space-time is a significant objective fact because an interval involving both temporal and spatial separation is invariant, whereas no simpler interval involving only temporal or only spatial separation is invariant under Lorentz transformations. Nozick argues that invariances, and hence objectivity itself, emerged through a theory of evolutionary cosmology across possible worlds.\nLater reflections on libertarianism.\nNozick pronounced some misgivings about libertarianism \u2013 specifically his own work \"Anarchy, State and Utopia\" \u2013 in his later publications. Some later editions of \"The Examined Life\" advertise this fact explicitly in the blurb, saying Nozick \"refutes his earlier claims of libertarianism\" in one of the book's essays, \"The Zigzag of Politics\". In the introduction of \"The Examined Life\", Nozick says his earlier works on political philosophy \"now [seem] seriously inadequate\", and later repeats this claim in the first chapter of \"The Nature of Rationality\".\nIn these works, Nozick also praised political ideals which ran contrary to the arguments canvassed in \"Anarchy, State and Utopia\". In \"The Examined Life\", Nozick proposes wealth redistribution via an inheritance tax and upholds the value of liberal democracy. In \"The Nature of Rationality\", Nozick calls truth a primary good, explicitly appropriating Rawls' \"A Theory of Justice\". In the same work, however, Nozick implies that minimum wage laws are unjust,b and later denigrates Marxism before vindicating capitalism, making reference to Adam Smith's \"The Wealth of Nations\".\nNozick also broke away from libertarian principles in his own personal life, invoking rent control laws against Erich Segal \u2013 who was at one point Nozick's landlord \u2013 and winning over $30,000 in a settlement. Nozick later claimed to regret doing this, saying he was moved by \"intense irritation\" with Segal and his legal representatives at the time, and was quoted in an interview saying \"sometimes you have to do what you have to do\".\nSome of Nozick's later works seem to endorse libertarian principles. In \"Invariances\", Nozick advances the \"four layers of ethics\", which at its core maintains an explicitly libertarian underpinning. In \"Socratic Puzzles\", Nozick republished some of his old essays with a libertarian grounding, such as \"Coercion\" and \"On The Randian Argument\", alongside new essays such as \"On Austrian Methodology\" and \"Why Do Intellectuals Oppose Capitalism?\". However, Nozick does allude to some continued reservations about libertarianism in its introduction, saying that \"it is disconcerting to be known primarily for an early work\".\nScholars and journalists have since debated what Nozick's true political position was before the end of his life. Writing for Slate, Stephen Metcalf notes one of Nozick's core claims in \"The Examined Life\", that actions done through government serve as markers of \"our human solidarity\". Metcalf then postulates that Nozick felt this was threatened by neoliberal politics. Libertarian journalist Julian Sanchez, who interviewed Nozick shortly before his death, claims that Nozick \"always thought of himself as a libertarian in a broad sense, right up to his final days, even as his views became somewhat less 'hardcore'\".\nPhilosophical method.\nNozick was sometimes admired for the exploratory style of his philosophizing, often content to raise tantalizing philosophical possibilities and then leave judgment to the reader. In his review of \"The Nature of Rationality\", Anthony Gottlieb praised this style, noting its place in Nozick's approach to writing philosophy:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"From Mr. Nozick you always expect fireworks, even if some of them go off in their box...Start pondering a sentence and you will find yourself led away prematurely by a parenthetical question; think about the question and you will be dragged into a discursive footnote...Yet it is worth the effort \u2013 certainly for regular readers of philosophy, and often for others.\"\nJason Brennan has related this point to Nozick's \"surprising amount of humility, at least in his writings\". Brennan makes a point of showing how this enabled Nozick to reach surprising conclusions while also drawing attention to one of Nozick's more famous quotes which also made the headline of his obituary in \"The Economist\", that \"there is room for words on subjects other than last words\".\nNozick was also notable for drawing from literature outside of philosophy, namely economics, physics, evolutionary biology, decision theory, anthropology, and computer science, amongst other disciplines.\na.&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;^ Nozick's discussion of animal rights pre-dates Peter Singer's more comprehensive \"Animal Liberation\".

With a living at Cranbrook, Kent, he wrote anti-Catholic works and cultivated a local circle among the Kent gentry.\nBiography.\nRobert Abbot received his education at Cambridge University, and later at\nOxford University. The details of Abbot's ecclesiastical career are somewhat unclear, and can only be pieced together from fragmentary evidence, but based on something he wrote in his work \"Bee Thankfull London and her Sisters\", it is probable that he began his church service with a posting as \"assistant to a reverend divine\". A note in the margin indicates that the priest in question was \"Master Haiward of Wool Church\", in Dorset. In 1616 he was appointed by George Abbot to the vicarage of Cranbrook in Kent. His ministry at Cranbrook was regarded as successful, but he was noted for his lack of tolerance towards nonconformists. In 1643, Abbot left Cranbrook, becoming vicar of Southwick, Hampshire. Later, he became pastor at the \"extruded\" Udall of St Austin's, in London, where he apparently still served in 1657. Between 1657 and 1658, and in 1662, Abbot appears to vanish from record, and his activities are unknown.\nWritten works.\nRobert Abbot's books are conspicuous amongst the works of his time by their terseness and variety. In addition to those mentioned above he wrote \"Triall of our Church-Forsakers\" (1639), \"Milk for Babes, or a Mother's Catechism for her Children\" (1646), and \"A Christian Family builded by God, or Directions for Governors of Families\" (1653).\nIdentification of father.\nAbbot is sometimes mistakenly described as the son of the Archbishop of Canterbury of the same surname, George Abbot. The misunderstanding may stem from a passage in Robert Abbot's work \"A Hand of Fellowship to Helpe Keepe out Sinne and Antichrist\", in which he thanks the Archbishop for \"worldly maintenance,\" \"best earthly countenance\" and \"fatherly incouragements.\"\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was the last king of the Plantagenet dynasty and its cadet branch the House of York. His defeat and death at the Battle of Bosworth Field marked the end of the Middle Ages in England.\nRichard was created Duke of Gloucester in 1461 after the accession to the throne of his older brother Edward IV. This was during the period known as the Wars of the Roses, an era when two branches of the royal family contested the throne; Edward and Richard were Yorkists, and their side of the family faced off against their Lancastrian cousins. In 1472, Richard married Anne Neville, daughter of Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick, and widow of Edward of Lancaster, son of Henry VI, a Lancastrian. He governed northern England during Edward's reign, and played a role in the invasion of Scotland in 1482. When Edward IV died in April 1483, Richard was named Lord Protector of the realm for Edward's eldest son and successor, the 12-year-old Edward V. Before arrangements were complete for Edward V's coronation, scheduled for 22 June 1483, the marriage of his parents was declared bigamous and therefore invalid. Now officially illegitimate, Edward and his siblings were barred from inheriting the throne. On 25 June, an assembly of lords and commoners endorsed a declaration to this effect, and proclaimed Richard as the rightful king. He was crowned on 6 July 1483. Edward and his younger brother Richard of Shrewsbury, Duke of York, called the \"Princes in the Tower\", disappeared from the Tower of London around August 1483.\nThere were two major rebellions against Richard during his reign. In October 1483, an unsuccessful revolt was led by staunch allies of Edward IV and Richard's former ally, Henry Stafford, 2nd Duke of Buckingham. Then, in August 1485, Henry Tudor and his uncle, Jasper Tudor, landed in Wales with a contingent of French troops, and marched through Pembrokeshire, recruiting soldiers. Henry's forces defeated Richard's army near the Leicestershire town of Market Bosworth. Richard was slain, making him the last English king to die in battle. Henry Tudor then ascended the throne as Henry VII.\nRichard's corpse was taken to the nearby town of Leicester and buried without ceremony. His original tomb monument is believed to have been removed during the English Reformation, and his remains were wrongly thought to have been thrown into the River Soar. In 2012, an archaeological excavation was commissioned by Ricardian author Philippa Langley with the assistance of the Richard III Society on the site previously occupied by Grey Friars Priory. The University of Leicester identified the human skeleton found at the site as that of Richard III as a result of radiocarbon dating, comparison with contemporary reports of his appearance, identification of trauma sustained at Bosworth and comparison of his mitochondrial DNA with that of two matrilineal descendants of his sister Anne. He was reburied in Leicester Cathedral in 2015.\nEarly life.\nRichard was born on 2 October 1452, at Fotheringhay Castle in Northamptonshire, the eleventh of the twelve children of Richard, 3rd Duke of York, and Cecily Neville, and the youngest to survive infancy. His childhood coincided with the beginning of what has traditionally been labelled the 'Wars of the Roses', a period of political instability and periodic open civil war in England during the second half of the fifteenth century, between the Yorkists, who supported Richard's father (a potential claimant to the throne of King Henry VI from birth) and opposed the regime of Henry VI and his wife, Margaret of Anjou, and the Lancastrians, who were loyal to the crown. In 1459, his father and the Yorkists were forced to flee England, whereupon Richard and his older brother George were placed in the custody of their aunt Anne Neville, Duchess of Buckingham, and possibly of Cardinal Thomas Bourchier, Archbishop of Canterbury.\nWhen their father and elder brother Edmund, Earl of Rutland, were killed at the Battle of Wakefield on 30 December 1460, Richard and George were sent by their mother to the Low Countries. They returned to England following the defeat of the Lancastrians at the Battle of Towton. They participated in the coronation of their eldest brother as King Edward IV on 28 June 1461, when Richard was named Duke of Gloucester and made both a Knight of the Garter and a Knight of the Bath. Edward appointed him the sole Commissioner of Array for the Western Counties in 1464 when he was 11. By the age of 17, he had an independent command.\nRichard spent several years during his childhood at Middleham Castle in Wensleydale, Yorkshire, under the tutelage of his cousin Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick, later known as 'the Kingmaker' because of his role in the Wars of the Roses. Warwick supervised Richard's training as a knight; in the autumn of 1465, Edward IV granted Warwick \u00a31,000 for the expenses of his younger brother's tutelage. With some interruptions, Richard stayed at Middleham either from late 1461 until early 1465, when he was 12 or from 1465 until his coming of age in 1468, when he turned 16. While at Warwick's estate, it is likely that he met both Francis Lovell, who was his firm supporter later in his life, and Warwick's younger daughter, his future wife Anne Neville.\nIt is possible that even at this early stage Warwick was considering the king's brothers as strategic matches for his daughters, Isabel and Anne: young aristocrats were often sent to be raised in the households of their intended future partners, as had been the case for the young dukes' father, Richard of York. As the relationship between the king and Warwick became strained, Edward IV opposed the match. During Warwick's lifetime, George was the only royal brother to marry one of his daughters, the elder, Isabel, on 12 July 1469, without the king's permission. George joined his father-in-law's revolt against the king, while Richard remained loyal to Edward, even though he was rumoured to have been having an affair with Anne.\nRichard and Edward were forced to flee to Burgundy in October 1470 after Warwick defected to the side of the former Lancastrian queen Margaret of Anjou. In 1468, Richard's sister Margaret had married Charles the Bold, the Duke of Burgundy, and the brothers could expect a welcome there. Edward was restored to the throne in the spring of 1471, following the battles of Barnet and Tewkesbury, in both of which the 18-year-old Richard played a crucial role.\nDuring his adolescence, and due to a cause that is unknown, Richard developed scoliosis, a sideways curvature of the spine. In 2014, after the discovery of Richard's remains, the osteoarchaeologist Dr. Jo Appleby, of Leicester University's School of Archaeology and Ancient History, imaged the spinal column, and reconstructed a model using 3D printing, and concluded that though the spinal scoliosis looked dramatic, it probably did not cause any major physical deformity that could not be disguised by clothing.\nMarriage and family relationships.\nFollowing a decisive Yorkist victory over the Lancastrians at the Battle of Tewkesbury, Richard married Anne Neville on 12 July 1472. Anne had previously been wedded to Edward of Westminster, only son of Henry VI, to seal her father's allegiance to the Lancastrian party. Edward died at the Battle of Tewkesbury on 4 May 1471, while Warwick had died at the Battle of Barnet on 14 April 1471. Richard's marriage plans brought him into conflict with his brother George. John Paston's letter of 17 February 1472 makes it clear that George was not happy about the marriage but grudgingly accepted it on the basis that \"he may well have my Lady his sister-in-law, but they shall part no livelihood\". The reason was the inheritance Anne shared with her elder sister Isabel, whom George had married in 1469. It was not only the earldom that was at stake; Richard Neville had inherited it as a result of his marriage to Anne Beauchamp, 16th Countess of Warwick. The Countess, who was still alive, was technically the owner of the substantial Beauchamp estates, her father having left no male heirs.\nThe Croyland Chronicle records that Richard agreed to a prenuptial contract in the following terms: \"the marriage of the Duke of Gloucester with Anne before-named was to take place, and he was to have such and so much of the earl's lands as should be agreed upon between them through the mediation of arbitrators; while all the rest were to remain in the possession of the Duke of Clarence\". The date of Paston's letter suggests the marriage was still being negotiated in February 1472. In order to win George's final consent to the marriage, Richard renounced most of the Earl of Warwick's land and property including the earldoms of Warwick (which the Kingmaker had held in his wife's right) and Salisbury and surrendered to George the office of Great Chamberlain of England. Richard retained Neville's forfeit estates he had already been granted in the summer of 1471: Penrith, Sheriff Hutton and Middleham, where he later established his marital household.\nThe requisite papal dispensation was obtained dated 22 April 1472. Michael Hicks has suggested that the terms of the dispensation deliberately understated the degrees of consanguinity between the couple, and the marriage was therefore illegal on the ground of first-degree consanguinity following George's marriage to Anne's sister Isabel. However, the first-degree consanguinity would have been only if Richard had sought to marry Isabel (in case of widowhood) after she had married his brother George, but no such consanguinity applied for Anne and Richard. Richard's marriage to Anne was never declared null, and it was public to everyone including secular and canon lawyers for 13 years.\nIn June 1473, Richard persuaded his mother-in-law to leave the sanctuary and come to live under his protection at Middleham. Later in the year, under the terms of the 1473 Act of Resumption, George lost some of the property he held under royal grant and made no secret of his displeasure. John Paston's letter of November 1473 says that King Edward planned to put both his younger brothers in their place by acting as \"a stifler atween them\". Early in 1474, Parliament assembled and Edward attempted to reconcile his brothers by stating that both men, and their wives, would enjoy the Warwick inheritance just as if the Countess of Warwick \"was naturally dead\". The doubts cast by George on the validity of Richard and Anne's marriage were addressed by a clause protecting their rights in the event they were divorced (i.e. of their marriage being declared null and void by the Church) and then legally remarried to each other, and also protected Richard's rights while waiting for such a valid second marriage with Anne. The following year, Richard was rewarded with all the Neville lands in the north of England, at the expense of Anne's cousin, George Neville, 1st Duke of Bedford. From this point, George seems to have fallen steadily out of King Edward's favour, his discontent coming to a head in 1477 when, following Isabel's death, he was denied the opportunity to marry Mary of Burgundy, the stepdaughter of his sister Margaret, even though Margaret approved the proposed match. There is no evidence of Richard's involvement in George's subsequent conviction and execution on a charge of treason.\nReign of Edward IV.\nEstates and titles.\nRichard was granted the Dukedom of Gloucester on 1 November 1461, and on 12 August the next year was awarded large estates in northern England, including the lordships of Richmond in Yorkshire, and Pembroke in Wales. He gained the forfeited lands of the Lancastrian John de Vere, 12th Earl of Oxford, in East Anglia. In 1462, on his birthday, he was made Constable of Gloucester and Corfe Castles and Admiral of England, Ireland and Aquitaine and appointed Governor of the North, becoming the richest and most powerful noble in England. On 17 October 1469, he was made Constable of England. In November, he replaced William Hastings, 1st Baron Hastings, as Chief Justice of North Wales. The following year, he was appointed Chief Steward and Chamberlain of Wales. On 18 May 1471, Richard was named Great Chamberlain and Lord High Admiral of England. Other positions followed: High Sheriff of Cumberland for life, Lieutenant of the North and Commander-in-Chief against the Scots and hereditary Warden of the West March. Two months later, on 14 July, he gained the Lordships of the strongholds Sheriff Hutton and Middleham in Yorkshire and Penrith in Cumberland, which had belonged to Warwick the Kingmaker. It is possible that the grant of Middleham seconded Richard's personal wishes.\nExile and return.\nDuring the latter part of Edward IV's reign, Richard demonstrated his loyalty to the king, in contrast to their brother George who had allied himself with the Earl of Warwick when the latter rebelled towards the end of the 1460s. Following Warwick's 1470 rebellion, before which he had made peace with Margaret of Anjou and promised the restoration of Henry VI to the English throne, Richard, the Baron Hastings and Anthony Woodville, 2nd Earl Rivers, escaped capture at Doncaster by Warwick's brother, John Neville, 1st Marquess of Montagu. On 2 October they sailed from King's Lynn in two ships; Edward landed at Marsdiep and Richard at Zeeland. It was said that, having left England in such haste as to possess almost nothing, Edward was forced to pay their passage with his fur cloak; certainly, Richard borrowed three pounds from Zeeland's town bailiff. They were attainted by Warwick's only Parliament on 26 November. They resided in Bruges with Louis de Gruthuse, who had been the Burgundian Ambassador to Edward's court, but it was not until Louis XI of France declared war on Burgundy that Charles, Duke of Burgundy, assisted their return, providing, along with the Hanseatic merchants, 20,000 pounds, 36 ships and 1,200 men. They left Flushing for England on 11 March 1471. Warwick's arrest of local sympathisers prevented them from landing in Yorkist East Anglia and on 14 March, after being separated in a storm, their ships ran ashore at Holderness. The town of Hull refused Edward entry. He gained entry to York by using the same claim as Henry of Bolingbroke had before deposing Richard II in 1399; that is, that he was merely reclaiming the Dukedom of York rather than the crown. It was in Edward's attempt to regain his throne that Richard began to demonstrate his skill as a military commander.\n1471 military campaign.\nOnce Edward had regained the support of his brother George, he mounted a swift and decisive campaign to regain the crown through combat; it is believed that Richard was his principal lieutenant as some of the king's earliest support came from members of Richard's affinity, including Sir James Harrington and Sir William Parr, who brought 600 men-at-arms to them at Doncaster. Richard may have led the vanguard at the Battle of Barnet, in his first command, on 14 April 1471, where he outflanked the wing of Henry Holland, 3rd Duke of Exeter, although the degree to which his command was fundamental may have been exaggerated. That Richard's personal household sustained losses indicate he was in the thick of the fighting. A contemporary source is clear about his holding the vanguard for Edward at Tewkesbury, deployed against the Lancastrian vanguard under Edmund Beaufort, 4th Duke of Somerset, on 4 May 1471, and his role two days later, as Constable of England, sitting alongside John Howard as Earl Marshal, in the trial and sentencing of leading Lancastrians captured after the battle.\n1475 invasion of France.\nAt least in part resentful of King Louis XI's previous support of his Lancastrian opponents, and possibly in support of his brother-in-law Charles the Bold, Duke of Burgundy, Edward went to parliament in October 1472 for funding a military campaign, and eventually landed in Calais on 4 July 1475. Richard's was the largest private contingent of his army. Although well known to have publicly been against the eventual treaty signed with Louis XI at Picquigny (and absent from the negotiations, in which one of his rank would have been expected to take a leading role), he acted as Edward's witness when the king instructed his delegates to the French court, and received 'some very fine presents' from Louis on a visit to the French king at Amiens. In refusing other gifts, which included 'pensions' in the guise of 'tribute', he was joined only by Cardinal Bourchier. He supposedly disapproved of Edward's policy of personally benefiting\u2014politically and financially\u2014from a campaign paid for out of a parliamentary grant, and hence out of public funds. Any military prowess was therefore not to be revealed further until the last years of Edward's reign.\nThe North, and the Council in the North.\nRichard was the dominant magnate in the north of England until Edward IV's death. There, and especially in the city of York, he was highly regarded; although it has been questioned whether this view was reciprocated by Richard. Edward IV delegated significant authority to Richard in the region. Kendall and later historians have suggested that this was with the intention of making Richard the \"Lord of the North\"; Peter Booth, however, has argued that \"instead of allowing his brother Richard \"carte blanche\", [Edward] restricted his influence by using his own agent, Sir William Parr.\" Following Richard's accession to the throne, he first established the Council of the North and made his nephew John de la Pole, 1st Earl of Lincoln, president and formally institutionalised this body as an offshoot of the royal Council; all its letters and judgements were issued on behalf of the king and in his name. The council had a budget of 2,000 marks per annum and had issued \"Regulations\" by July of that year: councillors to act impartially, declare vested interests and to meet at least every three months. Its main focus of operations was Yorkshire and the north-east and its responsibilities included land disputes, keeping of the king's peace and punishing lawbreakers.\nWar with Scotland.\nRichard's increasing role in the north from the mid-1470s to some extent explains his withdrawal from the royal court. He had been Warden of the West March on the Scottish border since 10 September 1470, and again from May 1471; he used Penrith as a base while 'taking effectual measures' against the Scots, and 'enjoyed the revenues of the estates' of the Forest of Cumberland while doing so. It was at the same time that the Duke of Gloucester was appointed High Sheriff of Cumberland for five consecutive years, being described as 'of Penrith Castle' in 1478.\nBy 1480, war with Scotland was looming; on 12 May that year, he was appointed Lieutenant-General of the North (a position created for the occasion) as fears of a Scottish invasion grew. Louis XI of France had attempted to negotiate a military alliance with Scotland (in the tradition of the \"Auld Alliance\"), with the aim of attacking England, according to a contemporary French chronicler. Richard had the authority to summon the Border Levies and issue Commissions of Array to repel the Border raids. Together with the Earl of Northumberland, he launched counter-raids, and when the king and council formally declared war in November 1480, he was granted 10,000 pounds for wages.\nThe king failed to arrive to lead the English army and the result was intermittent skirmishing until early 1482. Richard witnessed the treaty with Alexander, Duke of Albany, brother of King James III of Scotland. Northumberland, Stanley, Dorset, Sir Edward Woodville, and Richard with approximately 20,000 men took the town of Berwick as part of the English invasion of Scotland. The castle held out until 24 August 1482, when Richard recaptured Berwick-upon-Tweed from the Kingdom of Scotland. Although it is debatable whether the English victory was due more to internal Scottish divisions rather than any outstanding military prowess by Richard, it was the last time that the Royal Burgh of Berwick changed hands between the two realms.\nLord Protector.\nOn the death of Edward IV on 9 April 1483, his 12-year-old son, Edward V, succeeded him, with Richard being named Lord Protector of the Realm. At Baron Hastings' urging, Richard left his base in Yorkshire for London in order to assume his role. On 29 April, as previously agreed, Richard and his cousin, Henry Stafford, 2nd Duke of Buckingham, met Queen Elizabeth's brother Anthony Woodville, 2nd Earl Rivers, at Northampton. At the queen's request, Earl Rivers was escorting the young king to London with an armed escort of 2,000 men, while Richard and Buckingham's joint escort was 600 men. Edward V had been sent further south to Stony Stratford. At first convivial, Richard had Earl Rivers, his nephew Richard Grey and his associate, Thomas Vaughan, arrested. They were taken to Pontefract Castle, where they were executed on 25 June on the charge of treason against the Lord Protector after appearing before a tribunal led by Henry Percy, 4th Earl of Northumberland. Rivers had appointed Richard as executor of his will.\nAfter having Rivers arrested, Richard and Buckingham moved to Stony Stratford, where Richard informed Edward V of a plot aimed at denying him his role as protector and whose perpetrators had been dealt with. He proceeded to escort the king to London. They entered the city on 4 May, displaying the carriages of weapons Rivers had taken with his 2,000-man army. Richard first accommodated Edward in the Bishop's apartments; then, on Buckingham's suggestion, the king was moved to the royal apartments of the Tower of London, where kings customarily awaited their coronation. Within the year 1483, Richard had moved himself to the grandeur of Crosby Hall, London, then in Bishopsgate in the City of London. Robert Fabyan, in his 'The new chronicles of England and of France', writes that \"the Duke caused the King (Edward V) to be removed unto the Tower and his broder with hym, and the Duke lodged himselfe in Crosbyes Place in Bisshoppesgate Strete.\" In \"Holinshed's Chronicles\" of England, Scotland, and Ireland, he accounts that \"little by little all folke withdrew from the Tower, and drew unto Crosbies in Bishops gates Street, where the Protector kept his houshold. The Protector had the resort; the King in maner desolate.\"\nOn hearing the news of her brother's 30 April arrest, the dowager queen fled to sanctuary in Westminster Abbey. Joining her were her son by her first marriage, Thomas Grey, 1st Marquess of Dorset; her five daughters; and her youngest son, Richard of Shrewsbury, Duke of York. On 10/11 June, Richard wrote to Ralph, Lord Neville, the City of York and others asking for their support against \"the Queen, her blood adherents and affinity\" whom he suspected of plotting his murder. At a council meeting on 13 June at the Tower of London, Richard accused Hastings and others of having conspired against him with the Woodvilles and accusing Jane Shore, lover to both Hastings and Thomas Grey, of acting as a go-between. According to Thomas More, Hastings was taken out of the council chambers and summarily executed in the courtyard, while others, like Lord Thomas Stanley and John Morton, Bishop of Ely, were arrested. Hastings was not attainted and Richard sealed an indenture that placed Hastings' widow, Katherine, under his protection. Bishop Morton was released into the custody of Buckingham. On 16 June, the dowager queen agreed to hand over the Duke of York to the Archbishop of Canterbury so that he might attend his brother Edward's coronation, still planned for 22 June.\nKing of England.\nRobert Stillington, the Bishop of Bath and Wells, is said to have informed Richard that Edward IV's marriage to Elizabeth Woodville was invalid because of Edward's earlier union with Eleanor Butler, making Edward V and his siblings illegitimate. The identity of Stillington was known only through the memoirs of the French diplomat, Philippe de Commines. On 22 June, a sermon was preached outside Old St. Paul's Cathedral by Ralph Shaa, declaring Edward IV's children bastards and Richard the rightful king. Shortly after, the citizens of London, nobles and commons, convened and drew up a petition asking Richard to assume the throne. He accepted on 26 June and was crowned at Westminster Abbey on 6 July. His title to the throne was confirmed by Parliament in January 1484 by the document \"Titulus Regius\".\nThe princes, who were still lodged in the royal residence of the Tower of London at the time of Richard's coronation, disappeared from sight after the summer of 1483. Although after his death Richard III was accused of having Edward and his brother killed, notably by More and in Shakespeare's play, the facts surrounding their disappearance remain unknown. Other culprits have been suggested, including Buckingham and even Henry VII, although Richard remains the primary suspect.\nAfter the coronation ceremony, Richard and Anne set out on a royal progress to meet their subjects. During this journey through the country, the king and queen endowed King's College and Queens' College at Cambridge University, and made grants to the church. Still feeling a strong bond with his northern estates, Richard later planned the establishment of a large chantry chapel in York Minster with over 100 priests. He also founded the College of Arms.\nBuckingham's rebellion of 1483.\nIn 1483, a conspiracy arose among a number of disaffected gentry, many of whom had been supporters of Edward IV and the \"whole Yorkist establishment\". The conspiracy was nominally led by Richard's former ally, the Duke of Buckingham, although it had begun as a Woodville-Beaufort conspiracy (being \"well underway\" by the time of the Duke's involvement). Davies has suggested that it was \"only the subsequent parliamentary attainder that placed Buckingham at the centre of events\", to blame a disaffected magnate motivated by greed, rather than \"the embarrassing truth\" that those opposing Richard were actually \"overwhelmingly Edwardian loyalists\". It is possible that they planned to depose Richard III and place Edward V back on the throne, and that when rumours arose that Edward and his brother were dead, Buckingham proposed that Henry Tudor should return from exile, take the throne and marry Elizabeth, eldest daughter of Edward IV. It has also been pointed out that as this narrative stems from Richard's parliament of 1484, it should probably be treated \"with caution\". For his part, Buckingham raised a substantial force from his estates in Wales and the Marches. Henry, in exile in Brittany, enjoyed the support of the Breton treasurer Pierre Landais, who hoped Buckingham's victory would cement an alliance between Brittany and England.\nSome of Henry Tudor's ships ran into a storm and were forced to return to Brittany or Normandy, while Henry anchored off Plymouth for a week before learning of Buckingham's failure. Buckingham's army was troubled by the same storm and deserted when Richard's forces came against them. Buckingham tried to escape in disguise but was either turned in by a retainer for the bounty Richard had put on his head, or was discovered in hiding with him. He was convicted of treason and beheaded in Salisbury, near the Bull's Head Inn, on 2 November. His widow, Catherine Woodville, later married Jasper Tudor, the uncle of Henry Tudor. Richard made overtures to Landais, offering military support for Landais's weak regime under Francis II, Duke of Brittany, in exchange for Henry. Henry fled to Paris, where he secured support from the French regent Anne of Beaujeu, who supplied troops for an invasion in 1485.\nDeath at the Battle of Bosworth Field.\nOn 22 August 1485, Richard met the outnumbered forces of Henry Tudor at the Battle of Bosworth Field. Richard rode a white courser (an especially swift and strong horse). The size of Richard's army has been estimated at 8,000 and Henry's at 5,000, but exact numbers are not known, though the royal army is believed to have \"substantially\" outnumbered Henry's. The traditional view of the king's famous cries of \"Treason!\" before falling was that during the battle Richard was abandoned by Baron Stanley (made Earl of Derby in October), Sir William Stanley, and Henry Percy, 4th Earl of Northumberland. The role of Northumberland is unclear; his position was with the reserve\u2014behind the king's line\u2014and he could not easily have moved forward without a general royal advance, which did not take place.\nThe physical confines behind the crest of Ambion Hill, combined with a difficulty of communications, probably physically hampered any attempt he made to join the fray. Despite appearing \"a pillar of the Ricardian regime\" and his previous loyalty to Edward IV, Baron Stanley was the stepfather of Henry Tudor and Stanley's inaction combined with his brother's entering the battle on Tudor's behalf was fundamental to Richard's defeat. The death of Richard's close companion John Howard, Duke of Norfolk, may have had a demoralising effect on the king and his men. Either way, Richard led a cavalry charge deep into the enemy ranks in an attempt to end the battle quickly by striking at Henry Tudor.\nAll accounts note that King Richard fought bravely and ably during this manoeuvre, unhorsing Sir John Cheyne, a well-known jousting champion, killing Henry's standard bearer Sir William Brandon and coming within a sword's length of Henry Tudor before being surrounded by Sir William Stanley's men and killed. Polydore Vergil, Henry VII's official historian, recorded that \"King Richard, alone, was killed fighting manfully in the thickest press of his enemies\". The Burgundian chronicler Jean Molinet states that a Welshman struck the death blow with a halberd while Richard's horse was stuck in the marshy ground. It was said that the blows were so violent that the king's helmet was driven into his skull. The contemporary Welsh poet Guto'r Glyn implies a leading Welsh Lancastrian, Rhys ap Thomas, or one of his men killed the king, writing that he \"killed the boar, shaved his head\".\nThe identification in 2013 of King Richard's body shows that the skeleton had 11 wounds, eight of them to the skull, clearly inflicted in battle and suggesting he had lost his helmet. Professor Guy Rutty, from the University of Leicester, said: \"The most likely injuries to have caused the king's death are the two to the inferior aspect of the skull\u2014a large sharp force trauma possibly from a sword or staff weapon, such as a halberd or bill, and a penetrating injury from the tip of an edged weapon.\" The skull showed that a blade had hacked away part of the rear of the skull. Richard III was the last English king to be killed in battle. Henry Tudor succeeded Richard as King Henry VII. He married the Yorkist heiress Elizabeth of York, Edward IV's daughter and Richard III's niece.\nAfter the Battle of Bosworth, Richard's naked body was then carried back to Leicester tied to a horse, and early sources strongly suggest that it was displayed in the collegiate Church of the Annunciation of Our Lady of the Newarke, prior to being hastily and discreetly buried in the choir of Greyfriars Church in Leicester. In 1495, Henry VII paid 50 pounds for a marble and alabaster monument. According to a discredited tradition, during the Dissolution of the Monasteries, his body was thrown into the River Soar, although other evidence suggests that a memorial stone was visible in 1612, in a garden built on the site of Greyfriars. The exact location was then lost, owing to more than 400 years of subsequent development, until archaeological investigations in 2012 revealed the site of the garden and Greyfriars Church. There was a memorial ledger stone in the choir of the cathedral, since replaced by the tomb of the king, and a stone plaque on Bow Bridge where tradition had falsely suggested that his remains had been thrown into the river.\nAccording to another tradition, Richard consulted a seer in Leicester before the battle who foretold that \"where your spur should strike on the ride into battle, your head shall be broken on the return\". On the ride into battle, his spur struck the bridge stone of Bow Bridge in the city; legend states that as his corpse was carried from the battle over the back of a horse, his head struck the same stone and was broken open.\nLegacy.\nRichard's Council of the North, described as his \"one major institutional innovation\", derived from his ducal council following his own viceregal appointment by Edward IV; when Richard himself became king, he maintained the same conciliar structure in his absence. It officially became part of the royal council machinery under the presidency of John de la Pole, Earl of Lincoln in April 1484, based at Sandal Castle in Wakefield. It is considered to have greatly improved conditions for northern England, as it was intended to keep the peace and punish lawbreakers, as well as resolve land disputes. Bringing regional governance directly under the control of central government, it has been described as the king's \"most enduring monument\", surviving unchanged until 1641.\nIn December 1483, Richard instituted what later became known as the Court of Requests, a court to which poor people who could not afford legal representation could apply for their grievances to be heard. He also improved bail in January 1484, to protect suspected felons from imprisonment before trial and to protect their property from seizure during that time. He founded the College of Arms in 1484, he banned restrictions on the printing and sale of books, and he ordered the translation of the written Laws and Statutes from the traditional French into English. During his reign, Parliament ended the arbitrary benevolence (a device by which Edward IV raised funds), made it punishable to conceal from a buyer of land that a part of the property had already been disposed of to somebody else, required that land sales be published, laid down property qualifications for jurors, restricted the abusive Courts of Piepowders, regulated cloth sales, instituted certain forms of trade protectionism, prohibited the sale of wine and oil in fraudulent measure, and prohibited fraudulent collection of clergy dues, among others. Churchill implies he improved the law of trusts.\nRichard's death at Bosworth marked the end of the Plantagenet dynasty, which had ruled England since the succession of Henry II in 1154. The last legitimate male Plantagenet, Richard's nephew Edward, Earl of Warwick (son of his brother George, Duke of Clarence), was executed by Henry VII in 1499.\nReputation.\nThere are numerous contemporary, or near-contemporary, sources of information about the reign of Richard III. These include the \"Croyland Chronicle\", Commines' \"M\u00e9moires\", the report of Dominic Mancini, the Paston Letters, the Chronicles of Robert Fabyan and numerous court and official records, including a few letters by Richard himself. However, the debate about Richard's true character and motives continues, both because of the subjectivity of many of the written sources, reflecting the generally partisan nature of writers of this period, and because none was written by men with an intimate knowledge of Richard.\nDuring Richard's reign, the historian John Rous praised him as a \"good lord\" who punished \"oppressors of the commons\", adding that he had \"a great heart\". In 1483, the Italian observer Mancini reported that Richard enjoyed a good reputation and that both \"his private life and public activities powerfully attracted the esteem of strangers\". His bond to the City of York, in particular, was such that on hearing of Richard's demise at the battle of Bosworth the City Council officially deplored the king's death, at the risk of facing the victor's wrath.\nDuring his lifetime he was the subject of some attacks. Even in the North in 1482, a man was prosecuted for offences against the Duke of Gloucester, saying he did \"nothing but grin at\" the city of York. In 1484, attempts to discredit him took the form of hostile placards, the only surviving one being William Collingbourne's lampoon of July 1484 \"The Cat, the Rat, and Lovell the Dog, all rule England under a Hog\" which was pinned to the door of St. Paul's Cathedral and referred to Richard himself (the Hog) and his most trusted councillors William Catesby, Richard Ratcliffe and Francis, Viscount Lovell. On 30 March 1485 Richard felt forced to summon the Lords and London City Councillors to publicly deny the rumours that he had poisoned Queen Anne and that he had planned marriage to his niece Elizabeth, at the same time ordering the Sheriff of London to imprison anyone spreading such slanders. The same orders were issued throughout the realm, including York where the royal pronouncement recorded in the City Records dates 5 April 1485 and carries specific instructions to suppress seditious talk and remove and destroy evidently hostile placards unread.\nAs for Richard's physical appearance, most contemporary descriptions bear out the evidence that aside from having one shoulder higher than the other (with chronicler Rous not able to correctly remember which one, as slight as the difference was), Richard had no other noticeable bodily deformity. John Stow talked to old men who, remembering him, said \"that he was of bodily shape comely enough, only of low stature\" and a German traveller, Nicolas von Poppelau, who spent ten days in Richard's household in May 1484, describes him as \"three fingers taller than himself...much more lean, with delicate arms and legs and also a great heart.\" Six years after Richard's death, in 1491, a schoolmaster named William Burton, on hearing a defence of Richard, launched into a diatribe, accusing the dead king of being \"a hypocrite and a crookback...who was deservedly buried in a ditch like a dog.\"\nRichard's death encouraged the furtherance of this later negative image by his Tudor successors due to the fact that it helped to legitimise Henry VII's seizure of the throne. The Richard III Society contends that this means that \"a lot of what people thought they knew about Richard III was pretty much propaganda and myth building.\" The Tudor characterisation culminated in the famous fictional portrayal of him in Shakespeare's play \"Richard III\" as a physically deformed, Machiavellian villain, ruthlessly committing numerous murders in order to claw his way to power; Shakespeare's intention perhaps being to use Richard III as a vehicle for creating his own Marlowesque protagonist. Rous himself in his \"History of the Kings of England\", written during Henry VII's reign, initiated the process. He reversed his earlier position, and now portrayed Richard as a freakish individual who was born with teeth and shoulder-length hair after having been in his mother's womb for two years. His body was stunted and distorted, with one shoulder higher than the other, and he was \"slight in body and weak in strength\". Rous also attributes the murder of Henry VI to Richard, and claims that he poisoned his own wife. Jeremy Potter, a former Chair of the Richard III Society, claims that \"At the bar of history Richard III continues to be guilty because it is impossible to prove him innocent. The Tudors ride high in popular esteem.\"\nPolydore Vergil and Thomas More expanded on this portrayal, emphasising Richard's outward physical deformities as a sign of his inwardly twisted mind. More describes him as \"little of stature, ill-featured of limbs, crook-backed\u00a0... hard-favoured of visage\". Vergil also says he was \"deformed of body\u00a0... one shoulder higher than the right\". Both emphasise that Richard was devious and flattering, while planning the downfall of both his enemies and supposed friends. Richard's good qualities were his intelligence and bravery. All these characteristics are repeated by Shakespeare, who portrays him as having a hunch, a limp and a withered arm. With regard to the \"hunch\", the second quarto edition of \"Richard III\" (1598) used the term \"hunched-backed\" but in the First Folio edition (1623) it became \"bunch-backed\".\nRichard's reputation as a promoter of legal fairness persisted, however. William Camden in his \"Remains Concerning Britain\" (1605) states that Richard, \"albeit he lived wickedly, yet made good laws\". Francis Bacon also states that he was \"a good lawmaker for the ease and solace of the common people\". In 1525, Cardinal Wolsey upbraided the aldermen and Mayor of London for relying on a statute of Richard to avoid paying an extorted tax (benevolence) but received the reply \"although he did evil, yet in his time were many good acts made.\"\nRichard was a practising Catholic, as shown by his personal Book of Hours, surviving in the Lambeth Palace library. As well as conventional aristocratic devotional texts, the book contains a Collect of Saint Ninian, referencing a saint popular in the Anglo-Scottish Borders.\nDespite this, the image of Richard as a ruthless tyrant remained dominant in the 18th and 19th centuries. The 18th-century philosopher and historian David Hume described him as a man who used dissimulation to conceal \"his fierce and savage nature\" and who had \"abandoned all principles of honour and humanity\". Hume acknowledged that some historians have argued \"that he was well qualified for government, had he legally obtained it; and that he committed no crimes but such as were necessary to procure him possession of the crown\", but he dismissed this view on the grounds that Richard's exercise of arbitrary power encouraged instability. The most important late 19th century biographer of the king was James Gairdner, who also wrote the entry on Richard in the \"Dictionary of National Biography\". Gairdner stated that he had begun to study Richard with a neutral viewpoint, but became convinced that Shakespeare and More were essentially correct in their view of the king, despite some exaggerations.\nRichard was not without his defenders, the first of whom was Sir George Buck, a descendant of one of the king's supporters, who completed \"The history of King Richard the Third\" in 1619. The authoritative Buck text was published only in 1979, though a corrupted version was published by Buck's great-nephew in 1646. Buck attacked the \"improbable imputations and strange and spiteful scandals\" related by Tudor writers, including Richard's alleged deformities and murders. He located lost archival material, including the Titulus Regius, but also claimed to have seen a letter written by Elizabeth of York, according to which Elizabeth sought to marry the king. Elizabeth's supposed letter was never produced. Documents which later emerged from the Portuguese royal archives show that after Queen Anne's death, Richard's ambassadors were sent on a formal errand to negotiate a double marriage between Richard and the Portuguese king's sister Joanna, of Lancastrian descent, and between Elizabeth of York and Joanna's cousin Manuel, Duke of Viseu (later King of Portugal).\nSignificant among Richard's defenders was Horace Walpole. In \"Historic Doubts on the Life and Reign of King Richard the Third\" (1768), Walpole disputed all the alleged murders and argued that Richard may have acted in good faith. He also argued that any physical abnormality was probably no more than a minor distortion of the shoulders. However, he retracted his views in 1793 after the Terror, stating he now believed that Richard could have committed the crimes he was charged with, although Pollard observes that this retraction is frequently overlooked by later admirers of Richard. Other defenders of Richard include the noted explorer Clements Markham, whose \"Richard III: His Life and Character\" (1906) replied to the work of Gairdner. He argued that Henry VII killed the princes and that the bulk of evidence against Richard was nothing more than Tudor propaganda. An intermediate view was provided by Alfred Legge in \"The Unpopular King\" (1885). Legge argued that Richard's \"greatness of soul\" was eventually \"warped and dwarfed\" by the ingratitude of others.\nSome 20th-century historians have been less inclined to moral judgement, seeing Richard's actions as a product of the unstable times. In the words of Charles Ross, \"the later fifteenth century in England is now seen as a ruthless and violent age as concerns the upper ranks of society, full of private feuds, intimidation, land-hunger, and litigiousness, and consideration of Richard's life and career against this background has tended to remove him from the lonely pinnacle of Villainy Incarnate on which Shakespeare had placed him. Like most men, he was conditioned by the standards of his age.\" The Richard III Society, founded in 1924 as \"The Fellowship of the White Boar\", is the oldest of several Ricardian groups dedicated to improving his reputation. Other historians still describe him as a \"power-hungry and ruthless politician\" who was most probably \"ultimately responsible for the murder of his nephews.\"\nIn culture.\nRichard III is the protagonist of \"Richard III\", one of William Shakespeare's history/tragedy plays. Apart from Shakespeare, he appears in many other works of literature. Two other plays of the Elizabethan era predated Shakespeare's work. The Latin-language drama \"Richardus Tertius\" (first known performance in 1580) by Thomas Legge is believed to be the first history play written in England. The anonymous play \"The True Tragedy of Richard III\" (c.\u20091590), performed in the same decade as Shakespeare's work, was probably an influence on Shakespeare. Neither of the two plays places any emphasis on Richard's physical appearance, though the \"True Tragedy\" briefly mentions that he is \"A man ill shaped, crooked backed, lame armed\" and \"valiantly minded, but tyrannous in authority\". Both portray him as a man motivated by personal ambition, who uses everyone around him to get his way. Ben Jonson is also known to have written a play \"Richard Crookback\" in 1602, but it was never published and nothing is known about its portrayal of the king.\nMarjorie Bowen's 1929 novel \"Dickon\" set the trend for pro-Ricardian literature. Particularly influential was \"The Daughter of Time\" (1951) by Josephine Tey, in which a modern detective concludes that Richard III is innocent in the death of the Princes. Other novelists such as Valerie Anand in the novel \"Crown of Roses\" (1989) have also offered alternative versions to the theory that he murdered them. Sharon Kay Penman, in her historical novel \"The Sunne in Splendour\", attributes the death of the Princes to the Duke of Buckingham. In the mystery novel \"The Murders of Richard III\" by Elizabeth Peters (1974) the central plot revolves around the debate as to whether Richard III was guilty of these and other crimes. A sympathetic portrayal is given in \"The Founding\" (1980), the first volume in \"The Morland Dynasty\" series by Cynthia Harrod-Eagles.\nOne film adaptation of Shakespeare's play \"Richard III\" is the 1955 version directed and produced by Laurence Olivier, who also played the lead role. Also notable are the 1995 film version starring Ian McKellen, set in a fictional 1930s fascist England, and \"Looking for Richard\", a 1996 documentary film directed by Al Pacino, who plays the title character as well as himself. The play has been adapted for television on several occasions.\nDiscovery of remains.\nOn 24 August 2012, the University of Leicester, Leicester City Council, and the Richard III Society announced that they were initiating a search for the remains of King Richard. The project was managed by Philippa Langley of the Society's Looking for Richard Project with the archaeology run by University of Leicester Archaeological Services (ULAS). The participants looked for the lost site of the former Greyfriars Church (demolished during Henry VIII's dissolution of the monasteries) to find his remains. By comparing fixed points between maps, the church was found, where Richard's body had been hastily buried without pomp in 1485, its foundations identifiable beneath a modern city centre car park.\nIn 1975 Audrey Strange of the Richard III Society had predicted that the lost grave lay beneath one of the three car parks that partly cover the site of the former Grey Friars Priory. In the mid-1980s, academic David Baldwin, a medieval historian formerly of Leicester University, concluded that the burial site lay further to the east, beneath the northern (St Martin's) end of Grey Friars Street, or the buildings that face it on either side.\nThe excavators found Greyfriars Church by 5 September 2012 and two days later announced that they had found Robert Herrick's garden, where the memorial to Richard III stood in the early 17th century. A human skeleton was found beneath the Church's choir.\nThe excavators found the remains in the course of the first excavation at the car park.\nOn 12 September, it was announced that the skeleton might be that of Richard III. Several reasons were given: the body was of an adult male, it was buried beneath the choir of the church, and there was severe scoliosis of the spine, possibly making one shoulder higher than the other. There was also what appeared to be an arrowhead embedded in the spine, and there were perimortem injuries to the skull. These included a shallow orifice which was probably caused by a rondel dagger, and a scooping depression to the skull that was probably inflicted by a sword.\nFurther, the bottom of the skull had a gaping hole, where a halberd had entered. Forensic pathologist Stuart Hamilton with APT, Matthew Rogers, said this injury would have left the man's brain visible and certainly would have killed him. Jo Appleby, the osteo-archaeologist who excavated the skeleton, said it was \"a mortal battlefield wound in the back of the skull\". The base of the skull had another fatal wound from a bladed weapon thrust, leaving a jagged hole. Inside the skull, there was evidence that the blade penetrated to a depth of .\nIn total, the skeleton had 10 wounds: four minor injuries on the top of the skull, one dagger blow on the cheekbone, one cut on the lower jaw, two fatal injuries on the base of the skull, one cut on a rib bone, and one final wound on the pelvis that was probably inflicted after death. It is generally accepted that Richard's naked corpse was tied to the back of a horse, with his arms slung over one side and his legs and buttocks over the other. The angle of the blow on the pelvis suggests that one of those present stabbed Richard's right buttock with substantial force, as the cut extends from the back to the front of the pelvic bone, an action intended to humiliate. It is also possible that Richard and his corpse suffered other injuries which left no trace on the skeleton.\nBritish historian John Ashdown-Hill had used genealogical research in 2004 to trace matrilineal descendants of Anne of York, Duchess of Exeter, Richard's elder sister. A British-born woman who emigrated to Canada after the Second World War, Joy Ibsen (n\u00e9e\u00a0Brown), was found to be a 16th-generation great-niece of the king in the same direct maternal line. Her mitochondrial DNA was tested and belongs to mitochondrial DNA haplogroup J, which by deduction, should also be the mitochondrial DNA haplogroup of Richard III. Joy Ibsen died in 2008. Her son Michael Ibsen gave a mouth-swab sample to the research team on 24 August 2012. His mitochondrial DNA, passed down the direct maternal line, was compared to samples from the human remains found at the excavation site and used to identify King Richard.\nOn 4 February 2013, the University of Leicester confirmed that the skeleton was beyond reasonable doubt that of King Richard III. This conclusion was based on mitochondrial DNA evidence, soil analysis, and dental tests (there were some molars missing as a result of caries), as well as physical characteristics of the skeleton which are highly consistent with contemporary accounts of Richard's appearance. The team announced that the \"arrowhead\" discovered with the body was a Roman-era nail, probably disturbed when the body was first interred. However, there were numerous perimortem wounds on the body, and part of the skull had been sliced off with a bladed weapon; this would have caused rapid death. The team concluded that it is unlikely the king was wearing a helmet in his last moments. Soil taken from the remains was found to contain microscopic roundworm eggs. Several eggs were found in samples taken from the pelvis, where the king's intestines were, but not from the skull, and only very small numbers were identified in soil surrounding the grave. The findings suggest that the higher concentration of eggs in the pelvic area probably arose from a roundworm infection the king suffered in his life, rather than from human waste dumped in the area at a later date, researchers said. The mayor of Leicester announced that the king's skeleton would be re-interred at Leicester Cathedral in early 2014, but a judicial review of that decision delayed the reinterment for a year. A museum to Richard III was opened in July 2014 in the Victorian school buildings next to the Greyfriars grave site.\nOn 5 February 2013 Caroline Wilkinson of the University of Dundee conducted a facial reconstruction of Richard III, commissioned by the Richard III Society, based on 3D mappings of his skull. The face is described as \"warm, young, earnest and rather serious\". On 11 February 2014 the University of Leicester announced the project to sequence the entire genome of Richard III and one of his living relatives, Michael Ibsen, whose mitochondrial DNA confirmed the identification of the excavated remains. Richard III thus became the first ancient person of known historical identity whose genome has been sequenced.\nIn November 2014, the results of the DNA testing were published, confirming that the maternal side was as previously thought. The paternal side, however, demonstrated some variance from what had been expected, with the DNA showing no links between Richard and Henry Somerset, 5th Duke of Beaufort, a purported descendant of Richard's great-great-grandfather Edward III of England. This could be the result of covert illegitimacy that does not reflect the accepted genealogies between Edward III and either Richard III or the 5th Duke of Beaufort.\nReburial and tomb.\nAfter his death in battle in 1485, Richard III's body was buried in Greyfriars Church in Leicester. Following the discoveries of Richard's remains in 2012, it was decided that they should be reburied at Leicester Cathedral, despite feelings in some quarters that he should have been reburied in York Minster. Those who challenged the decision included fifteen \"collateral [non-direct] descendants of Richard III\", represented by the Plantagenet Alliance, who believed that the body should be reburied in York, as they claim the king wished. In August 2013, they filed a court case in order to contest Leicester's claim to re-inter the body within its cathedral, and propose the body be buried in York instead. However, Michael Ibsen, who gave the DNA sample that identified the king, gave his support to Leicester's claim to re-inter the body in their cathedral. On 20 August, a judge ruled that the opponents had the legal standing to contest his burial in Leicester Cathedral, despite a clause in the contract which had authorized the excavations requiring his burial there. He urged the parties, though, to settle out of court in order to \"avoid embarking on the Wars of the Roses, Part Two\". The Plantagenet Alliance, and the supporting fifteen collateral descendants, also faced the challenge that \"Basic maths shows Richard, who had no surviving children but five siblings, could have millions of 'collateral' descendants\" undermining the group's claim to represent \"the only people who can speak on behalf of him\". A ruling in May 2014 decreed that there are \"no public law grounds for the Court interfering with the decisions in question\". The remains were taken to Leicester Cathedral on 22 March 2015 and reinterred on 26 March.\nHis remains were carried in procession to the cathedral on 22 March 2015, and reburied on 26 March 2015 at a religious re-burial service at which both Tim Stevens, the Bishop of Leicester, and Justin Welby, the Archbishop of Canterbury, officiated. Also present at the ceremony was Archbishop of Westminster and Roman Catholic Primate of England, Cardinal Vincent Nichols, as Richard III professed Catholicism. The British royal family was represented by the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester and the Countess of Wessex. The actor Benedict Cumberbatch, who later portrayed him in \"The Hollow Crown\" television series, read a poem by poet laureate Carol Ann Duffy.\nRichard's cathedral tomb was designed by the architects van Heyningen and Haward. The tombstone is deeply incised with a cross, and consists of a rectangular block of white Swaledale fossil stone, quarried in North Yorkshire. It sits on a low plinth made of dark Kilkenny marble, incised with Richard's name, dates and motto (\"Loyaulte me lie\" \u2013 loyalty binds me). The plinth also carries his coat of arms in \"pietra dura\". On top is a funeral crown commissioned specifically for the reinterment, and made by George Easton. The remains of Richard III are in a lead-lined inner casket, inside an outer English oak coffin crafted by Michael Ibsen, a direct descendant of Richard's sister Anne, and laid in a brick-lined vault below the floor, and below the plinth and tombstone. The original 2010 raised tomb design had been proposed by Langley's \"Looking For Richard Project\" and fully funded by members of the Richard III Society. The proposal was publicly launched by the Society on 13 February 2013 but rejected by Leicester Cathedral in favour of a memorial slab. However, following a public outcry, the Cathedral changed its position and on 18 July 2013 announced its agreement to give King Richard III a raised tomb monument.\nIssue.\nRichard and Anne had one son, Edward of Middleham, who was born between 1474 and 1476. He was created Earl of Salisbury on 15 February 1478, and Prince of Wales on 24 August 1483, and died on 9 April 1484, less than two months after he had been formally declared heir apparent. After the death of his son, Richard appointed his nephew John de la Pole, Earl of Lincoln, as Lieutenant of Ireland, an office previously held by his son Edward. Lincoln was the son of Richard's older sister, Elizabeth, Duchess of Suffolk. After his wife's death, Richard commenced negotiations with John II of Portugal to marry John's sister Joanna. The pious princess had already turned down several suitors because of her preference for the religious life.\nRichard had two acknowledged illegitimate children, John of Gloucester and Katherine Plantagenet. Also known as 'John of Pontefract', John of Gloucester was appointed Captain of Calais in 1485. Katherine married William Herbert, 2nd Earl of Pembroke, in 1484. Neither the birth dates nor the names of the mothers of either of the children are known. Katherine was old enough to be wedded in 1484, when the age of consent was twelve, and John was knighted in September 1483 in York Minster, and so most historians agree that they were both fathered when Richard was a teenager. There is no evidence of infidelity on Richard's part after his marriage to Anne Neville in 1472 when he was around 20. This has led to a suggestion by the historian A. L. Rowse that Richard \"had no interest in sex\".\nMichael Hicks and Josephine Wilkinson have suggested that Katherine's mother may have been Katherine Haute, on the basis of the grant of an annual payment of 100 shillings made to her in 1477. The Haute family was related to the Woodvilles through the marriage of Elizabeth Woodville's aunt, Joan Wydeville, to William Haute. One of their children was Richard Haute, Comptroller of the Prince's Household. Their daughter, Alice, married Sir John Fogge; they were ancestors to Catherine Parr, sixth wife of King Henry VIII.\nHicks and Wilkinson also suggest that John's mother may have been Alice Burgh. Richard visited Pontefract from 1471, in April and October 1473, and in early March 1474, for a week. On 1 March 1474, he granted Alice Burgh 20 pounds a year for life \"for certain special causes and considerations\". She later received another allowance, apparently for being engaged as a nurse for his brother George's son, Edward of Warwick. Richard continued her annuity when he became king. John Ashdown-Hill has suggested that John was conceived during Richard's first solo expedition to the eastern counties in the summer of 1467 at the invitation of John Howard and that the boy was born in 1468 and named after his friend and supporter. Richard himself noted John was still a minor (not being yet 21) when he issued the royal patent appointing him Captain of Calais on 11 March 1485, possibly on his seventeenth birthday.\nBoth of Richard's illegitimate children survived him, but they seem to have died without issue and their fate after Richard's demise at Bosworth is not certain. John received a 20-pound annuity from Henry VII, but there are no mentions of him in contemporary records after 1487 (the year of the Battle of Stoke Field). He may have been executed in 1499, though no record of this exists beyond an assertion by George Buck over a century later. Katherine apparently died before her cousin Elizabeth of York's coronation on 25 November 1487, since her husband Sir William Herbert is described as a widower by that time. Katherine's burial place was located in the London parish church of St James Garlickhithe, between Skinner's Lane and Upper Thames Street.\nThe mysterious Richard Plantagenet, who was first mentioned in Francis Peck's \"Desiderata Curiosa\" (a two-volume miscellany published 1732\u20131735) was said to be a possible illegitimate child of Richard III and is sometimes referred to as \"Richard the Master-Builder\" or \"Richard of Eastwell\", but it has also been suggested he could have been Richard, Duke of York, one of the missing Princes in the Tower. He died in 1550.\nTitles, styles, honours and arms.\nOn 1 November 1461, Richard gained the title of Duke of Gloucester; in late 1461, he was invested as a Knight of the Garter. Following the death of King Edward IV, he was made Lord Protector of England. Richard held this office from 30 April to 26 June 1483, when he became king.

{"id": "26285", "revid": "1319526961", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26285", "title": "Restriction fragment length polymorphism", "text": "Molecular biology technique\nIn molecular biology, restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) is a technique that exploits variations in homologous DNA sequences, known as polymorphisms, populations, or species in order to pinpoint the locations of genes within a sequence. The term may refer to a polymorphism itself, as detected through the differing locations of restriction enzyme sites, or to a related laboratory technique by which such differences can be illustrated. In RFLP analysis, a DNA sample is digested into fragments by one or more restriction enzymes, and the resulting \"restriction fragments\" are then separated by gel electrophoresis according to their size.\nRFLP analysis is now largely obsolete due to the emergence of inexpensive DNA sequencing technologies, but it was the first DNA profiling technique inexpensive enough to see widespread application. RFLP analysis was an important early tool in genome mapping, localization of genes for genetic disorders, determination of risk for disease, and paternity testing.\nRFLP analysis.\nThe basic technique for the detection of RFLPs fragmenting a sample of DNA with the application of a restriction enzyme, which can selectively cleave a DNA molecule wherever a short, specific sequence is recognized in a process known as a restriction digest. The DNA fragments produced by the digest are then separated by length through a process known as agarose gel electrophoresis and transferred to a membrane via the Southern blot procedure. Hybridization of the membrane to a labeled DNA probe then determines the length of the fragments which are complementary to the probe. A restriction fragment length polymorphism is said to occur when the length of a detected fragment varies between individuals, indicating non-identical sequence homologies. Each fragment length is considered an allele, whether it actually contains a coding region or not, and can be used in subsequent genetic analysis.\nExamples.\nThere are two common mechanisms by which the size of a particular restriction fragment can vary. In the first schematic, a small segment of the genome is being detected by a DNA probe (thicker line). In allele \"A\", the genome is cleaved by a restriction enzyme at three nearby sites (triangles), but only the rightmost fragment will be detected by the probe. In allele \"a\", restriction site 2 has been lost by a mutation, so the probe now detects the larger fused fragment running from sites 1 to 3. The second diagram shows how this fragment size variation would look on a Southern blot, and how each allele (two per individual) might be inherited in members of a family.\nIn the third schematic, the probe and restriction enzyme are chosen to detect a region of the genome that includes a variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) segment (boxes in schematic diagram). In allele \"c\", there are five repeats in the VNTR, and the probe detects a longer fragment between the two restriction sites. In allele \"d\", there are only two repeats in the VNTR, so the probe detects a shorter fragment between the same two restriction sites. Other genetic processes, such as insertions, deletions, translocations, and inversions, can also lead to polymorphisms. RFLP tests require much larger samples of DNA than do short tandem repeat (STR) tests.\nApplications.\nAnalysis of RFLP variation in genomes was formerly a vital tool in genome mapping and genetic disease analysis. If researchers were trying to initially determine the chromosomal location of a particular disease gene, they would analyze the DNA of members of a family afflicted by the disease, and look for RFLP alleles that show a similar pattern of inheritance as that of the disease (see genetic linkage). Once a disease gene was localized, RFLP analysis of other families could reveal who was at risk for the disease, or who was likely to be a carrier of the mutant genes. RFLP test is used in identification and differentiation of organisms by analyzing unique patterns in genome. It is also used in identification of recombination rate in the loci between restriction sites.\nRFLP analysis was also the basis for early methods of genetic fingerprinting, useful in the identification of samples retrieved from crime scenes, in the determination of paternity, and in the characterization of genetic diversity or breeding patterns in animal populations.\nAlternatives.\nThe technique for RFLP analysis is, however, slow and cumbersome. It requires a large amount of sample DNA, and the combined process of probe labeling, DNA fragmentation, electrophoresis, blotting, hybridization, washing, and autoradiography can take up to a month to complete. A limited version of the RFLP method that used oligonucleotide probes was reported in 1985. The results of the Human Genome Project have largely replaced the need for RFLP mapping, and the identification of many single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in that project (as well as the direct identification of many disease genes and mutations) has replaced the need for RFLP disease linkage analysis (see SNP genotyping). The analysis of VNTR alleles continues, but is now usually performed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods. For example, the standard protocols for DNA fingerprinting involve PCR analysis of panels of more than a dozen VNTRs.\nRFLP is still used in marker-assisted selection. Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (TRFLP or sometimes T-RFLP) is a technique initially developed for characterizing bacterial communities in mixed-species samples. The technique has also been applied to other groups including soil fungi. TRFLP works by PCR amplification of DNA using primer pairs that have been labeled with fluorescent tags. The PCR products are then digested using RFLP enzymes and the resulting patterns visualized using a DNA sequencer. The results are analyzed either by simply counting and comparing bands or peaks in the TRFLP profile, or by matching bands from one or more TRFLP runs to a database of known species. A number of different software tools have been developed to automate the process of band matching, comparison and data basing of TRFLP profiles.\nThe technique is similar in some aspects to temperature gradient or denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (TGGE and DGGE).\nThe sequence changes directly involved with an RFLP can also be analyzed more quickly by PCR. Amplification can be directed across the altered restriction site, and the products digested with the restriction enzyme. This method has been called Cleaved Amplified Polymorphic Sequence (CAPS). Alternatively, the amplified segment can be analyzed by allele-specific oligonucleotide (ASO) probes, a process that can often be done by a simple dot blot."}

Most RPGs can be carried by an individual soldier, and are frequently used as anti-tank weapons. These warheads are affixed to a rocket motor which propels the RPG towards the target, stabilized in flight with fins. Some types of RPG are reloadable with new anti-tank grenades, while others are single-use. RPGs are generally loaded from the front.\nRPGs with high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) warheads are very effective against lightly armored vehicles such as armored personnel carriers (APCs) and armored cars. However, modern, heavily-armored vehicles, such as upgraded APCs and main battle tanks, are generally too well-protected (with thick composite or reactive armor) to be penetrated by an RPG, unless less armored sections of the vehicle are exploited. Various warheads are also capable of causing secondary damage to vulnerable systems (especially sights, tracks, rear and roof of turrets) and other unarmored targets.\nThe term \"rocket-propelled grenade\" is a backronym from the Russian acronym (, tr. ), meaning 'hand-held anti-tank grenade launcher', the name given to early Soviet designs.\nHistory.\nPredecessor weapons.\nThe static nature of trench warfare in World War I encouraged the use of shielded defenses, even including personal armor, that were impenetrable by standard rifle ammunition. This led to some isolated experiments with higher caliber rifles, similar to elephant guns, using armor-piercing ammunition. The first tanks, the British Mark I, could be penetrated by these weapons under the right conditions. Mark IV tanks, however, had slightly thicker armor. In response, the Germans rushed to create an upgraded version of these early anti-armor rifles, the Tankgewehr M1918, the first anti-tank rifle. In the inter-war years, tank armor continued to increase overall, to the point that anti-tank rifles could no longer be effective against anything but light tanks; any rifle made powerful enough for heavier tanks would exceed the ability of a soldier to carry and fire the weapon.\nEven with the first tanks, artillery officers often used field guns depressed to fire directly at armored targets. However, this practice expended much valuable ammunition and was of increasingly limited effectiveness as tank armor became thicker. This led to the concept of anti-tank guns, a form of artillery specifically designed to destroy armored fighting vehicles, normally from static defensive positions (that is, immobile during a battle).\nThe first dedicated anti-tank artillery began appearing in the 1920s, and by World War II was a common appearance in most armies. In order to penetrate armor they fired specialized ammunition from proportionally longer barrels to achieve a higher muzzle velocity than field guns. Most anti-tank guns were developed in the 1930s as improvements in tanks were noted, and nearly every major arms manufacturer produced one type or another.\nAnti-tank guns deployed during World War II were manned by specialist infantry rather than artillery crews, and issued to infantry units accordingly. The anti-tank guns of the 1930s were of small caliber; nearly all major armies possessing them used ammunition, except for the British Army, which had developed the Ordnance QF 2-pounder. As World War II progressed, the appearance of heavier tanks rendered these weapons obsolete and anti-tank guns likewise began firing larger calibre and more effective armor-piercing shells. Although a number of large caliber guns were developed during the war that were capable of knocking out the most heavily armored tanks, they proved slow to set up and difficult to conceal. The latter generation of low-recoil anti-tank weapons, which allowed projectiles the size of an artillery shell to be fired from a man's shoulder, was considered a far more viable option for arming infantrymen.\nFirst shaped charge, portable weapons.\nThe RPG has its roots in the 20th century with the early development of the explosive shaped charge, in which the explosive is made with a conical hollow, which concentrates its power on the impact point. Before the adoption of the shaped charge, anti-tank guns and tank guns relied primarily on kinetic energy of metal projectiles to defeat armor. Soldier-carried anti-tank rifles such as the Boys anti-tank rifle could be used against lightly-armored tankettes and light armored vehicles. However, as tank armor increased in thickness and effectiveness, the anti-tank guns needed to defeat them became increasingly heavy, cumbersome and expensive. During WW II, as tank armor got thicker, larger calibre anti-tank guns were developed to defeat this thicker armor.\nWhile larger anti-tank guns were more effective, their weight meant that they increasingly were mounted on wheeled, towed platforms. This meant that if the infantry was on foot, they might not have access to these wheeled, vehicle-towed anti-tank guns. This led to situations where infantry could find themselves defenseless against tanks and unable to attack tanks. Armies found that they needed to give infantry a human-portable (i.e., carried by one soldier) weapon to defeat enemy armor when no wheeled anti-tank guns were available, since anti-tank rifles were no longer effective. Initial attempts to put such weapons in the hands of the infantry resulted in weapons like the Soviet RPG-40 \"blast effect\" hand grenade (where \"RPG\" stood for \"ruchnaya protivotankovaya granata\", meaning hand-held anti-tank grenade). However, being hand thrown weapons, they still had to be deployed at suicidally close range to be effective. What was needed was a means of delivering the shaped charge warhead from a distance. Different approaches to this goal would lead to the anti-tank spigot mortar, the recoilless rifle, and, from the development of practical rocketry, the RPG.\nResearch occasioned by World War II produced such weapons as the American bazooka, British/Allied PIAT and German Panzerfaust, which combined portability with effectiveness against armored vehicles, such as tanks. The Soviet-developed RPG-7 is the most widely distributed, recognizable and used RPG in the world. The basic design of this RPG was developed by the Soviets shortly after World War II in the form of the RPG-2, which is similar in function to the bazooka (due to the reloadability) and the Panzerfaust (due to an oversized grenade that protrudes outside of a smaller launch tube and the recoilless launch), though the rounds it fires lack a form of propulsion in addition to the launch charge (unlike the RPG-7 rounds, which also feature a sustainer motor, effectively making the rounds rocket propelled grenades).\nSoviet RPGs were used extensively during the Vietnam War (by the Vietnam People's Army and Vietcong), as well as during the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan by the Mujahideen and against South Africans in Angola and Namibia (formerly South West Africa) by SWAPO guerillas during what the South Africans called the South African Border War. In the 2000s, they were still being used widely in conflict areas such as Chechnya, Iraq, and Sri Lanka. Militants have also used RPGs against helicopters: Taliban fighters shot down U.S. CH-47 Chinook helicopters in June 2005 and August 2011; and Somali militiamen shot down two U.S. UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters during the Battle of Mogadishu in 1993.\nRPGs were used by militants to destroy \"hundreds\" of vehicles (AFVs, armored Humvees etc) in the War in Afghanistan (2001\u20132021).\nDesign.\nThe RPG warhead being used against tanks and other armor often has a shaped charge explosive warhead. A shaped charge is an explosive charge shaped to focus the effect of the explosive's energy. Various types are used to penetrate tank armor; typical modern lined shaped charge can penetrate steel armor to a depth of seven or more times the diameter of the charge (charge diameters, CD), though greater depths of 10 CD and above have been achieved. Despite the popular misconception that shaped charges \"melt\" tank armor, the shaped charge does not depend in any way on heating or melting for its effectiveness; that is, the superplastic metal jet from a shaped charge impact on armor forms mainly due to a sudden and intense mechanical stress and does not melt its way through armor, as its effect is purely due to kinetic energy in nature.\nAn RPG comprises two main parts: the launcher and a rocket equipped with a warhead that follows a ballistic trajectory after the rocket motor has completed its burn. The most common types of warheads are high explosive (HE) and high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) rounds. HE rounds can be used against troops or unarmored structures or vehicles. HEAT rounds can be used against armored vehicles. These warheads are affixed to a rocket motor and stabilized in flight with fins. Some types of RPG are single-use disposable units, such as the RPG-22 and M72 LAW; with these units, once the rocket is fired, the entire launcher is disposed of. Others are reloadable, such as the Soviet RPG-7 and the Israeli B-300. With reloadable RPGs, a new rocket can be inserted into the muzzle of the weapon after firing.\nAn issue that affected the earliest RPG weapon systems such as the German Panzerschreck was that rocket motor propellant could harm the operator. The weapon therefore featured a metal shield attached to the launch tube to protect the operator\u2019s face from the blast. With later designs such as the RPG-7, the rocket exits the launcher with a low-powered gunpowder charge, and the main rocket motor then fires after the rocket has travelled . In some other designs, the propellant charge burns completely within the tube.\nAn RPG is an inexpensive way for an infantryman to safely deliver an explosive payload or warhead over a short distance with reasonable accuracy. Substantially more expensive guided anti-tank missiles are used at larger distances when accuracy or an overfly top attack are paramount. Anti-tank missiles such as the Malyutka can be guided by the operator after firing by sight, heat sensors or IR signatures; an RPG however is not guided towards the target. Nor can RPG rockets be controlled in flight after being aimed and launched. While the lack of active targeting technologies or after-firing guidance input can be viewed as a weakness, it also makes RPGs cheap and hard to defend against with electronic countermeasures or decoying. For example, if a soldier or other fighter launches an RPG at a hovering helicopter, even if the helicopter releases flares to confuse optical seekers, chaff to confuse radar, or engages in signal jamming, these will have no effect on an in-flight RPG warhead, even though these measures might protect against more sophisticated surface-to-air missiles.\nWarheads.\nThe HEAT (high-explosive anti-tank) round is a standard shaped charge warhead , similar in concept to those used in many tank cannon rounds. In this type of warhead, the shape of the explosive material within the warhead focuses the explosive energy on a copper (or similar metal) lining. This heats the metal lining and propels some of it forward at a very high velocity in a highly plastic state. The resulting narrow jet of metal can defeat armor equivalent to several hundred millimeters of RHA, such as that used in light and medium armored vehicles. However, heavily armored vehicles, such as main battle tanks, are generally too well armored to be penetrated by an RPG, unless weaker sections of the armor are exploited. Various warheads are also capable of causing secondary damage to vulnerable systems (especially sights, tracks, rear and roof of turrets) and other soft targets. The warhead detonates on impact or when the fuse runs out; usually the fuse is set to the maximum burn of the rocket motor, but it can be shortened for improvised anti aircraft purposes.\nSpecialized warheads are available for illumination, smoke, tear gas, and white phosphorus. Russia, China, and many former Warsaw Pact nations have also developed a fuel-air explosive (thermobaric) warhead. Another recent development is a tandem HEAT warhead capable of penetrating reactive armor.\nSo-called PRIGs (propelled recoilless improvised grenade) were improvised warheads used by the Provisional IRA.\nEffectiveness.\nThe RPG-29 uses a tandem-charge high-explosive anti-tank warhead to penetrate explosive reactive armor (ERA) as well as composite armor behind it.\nIn August 2006, in al-Amarah, in Iraq, a Soviet RPG-29 damaged the front underside of a Challenger 2 tank, detonating ERA in the area of the driver's cabin. The driver lost part of a foot and two more of the crew were injured, but the driver was able to reverse to an aid post. The incident was not made public until May 2007; in response to accusations, the MoD said \"We have never claimed that the Challenger 2 is impenetrable.\" Since then, the ERA has been replaced with a Dorchester block and the steel underbelly lined with armor, as part of the 'Streetfighter' upgrade, which was a direct response to this incident. In May 2008, \"The New York Times\" disclosed that an American M1 tank had also been damaged by an RPG-29 in Iraq. The American army is ranking the RPG-29 threat to American armor as high; they have refused to allow the newly formed Iraqi army to buy it, fearing that it would fall into the hands of insurgents.\nVarious armies and manufacturers have developed add-on tank armor and other systems for urban combat, such as the Tank Urban Survival Kit (TUSK) for M1 Abrams, slat armor for the Stryker, ERA kit for the FV432, AZUR for Leclerc, and others. Similar solutions are active protection systems (APS), engaging and destroying closing projectiles, such as the Russian Drozd and Arena, as well as the recent Israeli Trophy Active Protection System.\nThe RPG-30 was designed to address the threat of active protection systems on tanks by using a false target to trick the APS. The RPG-30 shares a close resemblance with the RPG-27 in that it is a man-portable, disposable anti-tank rocket launcher with a single-shot capacity. However, unlike the RPG-27, there is a smaller diameter precursor round in a smaller side barrel tube in addition to the main round in the main tube. This precursor round acts as a false target, tricking the target's active protection system into engaging it, allowing the main round a clear path into the target, while the APS is stuck in the 0.2\u20130.4 second delay it needs to start its next engagement. Recent German systems were able to reduce reaction delay to mere milliseconds, cancelling this advantage.\nThe PG-30 is the main round of the RPG-30. The round is a tandem shaped charge with a weight of and has a range of and a stated penetration capability in excess of rolled homogeneous armor (RHA) (after ERA), reinforced concrete, , and of soil. Reactive armor, including explosive reactive armor (ERA), can be defeated with multiple hits into the same place, such as by tandem-charge weapons, which fire two or more shaped charges in rapid succession.\nProtection.\nAn early method of disabling shaped charges developed during World War II was to apply thin skirt armor or meshwire at a distance around the hull and turret of the tank. The skirt or mesh armor (cage armor) triggers the RPG on contact and much of the energy that a shaped charge produces dissipates before coming into contact with the main armor of the vehicle. Well-sloped armor also gives some protection because the shaped charge is forced to penetrate a greater amount of armor due to the oblique angle. The benefits of cage armor are still considered great in modern battlefields in the Middle East, and although similar effects can be obtained using spaced armor, either as a part of the original design or as appliqu\u00e9 armor fitted later, cage armor is preferable due to its low weight and ease of repair.\nToday, technologically advanced armies have implemented composite armors such as Chobham armour, which provide superior protection to steel. For added protection, vehicles may be retrofitted with reactive armor; on impact, reactive tiles explode or deform, disrupting the normal function of the shaped charge. Russian and Israeli vehicles also use active protection systems such as Drozd, Arena APS or Trophy. Such a system detects and shoots down incoming projectiles before they reach the vehicle. As in all arms races, these developments in armor countermeasures have led to the development of RPG rounds designed specifically to defeat them, with methods such as a tandem-charge warhead, which has two shaped charges, of which the first is meant to activate any reactive armor, and the second to penetrate the vehicle.\nWeapons by country.\nSoviet Union and Russian Federation.\nSpecific types of RPGs (current, past and under development) include:\nUnited States.\nThe United States Army developed a lightweight antitank weapon (LAW) in the middle 1950s. By 1961, the M72 LAW was in use. It is a shoulder-fired, disposable rocket launcher with HEAT warhead. It is a recoilless weapon, which is easy to use, and effective against armored vehicles. It was used during the Vietnam War, and is still in use today. It uses a fin-stabilized rocket. In response to the threat of thicker armor, this weapon was replaced by the AT4 recoilless gun, a larger &amp; non-collapsible\u00a0\u2013 albeit still single-shot weapon.\nThe United States Army and Marine Corps also use a different launcher, which is reloadable\u00a0\u2013 the (MAAWs) derived from the 84mm Carl Gustav and the 83mm Shoulder-Launched Multipurpose Assault Weapon (SMAW) derived from the Israeli B-300. Unlike the RPG, they are both reloaded from the breech-end rather than the muzzle.\nTactics.\nOne of the first instances the weapon was used by militants was on January 13, 1975, at Orly Airport in France, when Carlos the Jackal, together with another member from the PFLP, used two Soviet RPG-7 grenades to attack an Israeli El Al airliner. Both missed the target, with one hitting a Yugoslav Airlines's DC-9 instead.\nIn Afghanistan, Mujahideen guerrillas used RPG-7s to destroy Soviet vehicles. To assure a kill, two to four RPG operators would be assigned to each vehicle. Each armored-vehicle hunter-killer team can have as many as 15 RPGs. In areas where vehicles were confined to a single path (a mountain road, swamps, snow, urban areas), RPG teams trapped convoys by destroying the first and last vehicles in line, preventing movement of the other vehicles. This tactic was especially effective in cities. Convoys learned to avoid approaches with overhangs and to send infantrymen forward in hazardous areas to detect the RPG teams.\nMultiple shooters were also effective against heavy tanks with reactive armor: The first shot would be against the driver's viewing prisms. Following shots would be in pairs, one to set off the reactive armor, the second to penetrate the tank's armor. Favored weak spots were the top and rear of the turret.\nAfghans sometimes used RPG-7s at extreme range, exploded by their 4.5-second self-destruct timer, which translates to roughly flight distance, as a method of long distance approach denial for infantry and reconnaissance. The most noteworthy use of RPGs against aircraft in Afghanistan occurred on August 6, 2011, when Taliban fighters shot down a U.S. CH-47 Chinook helicopter killing all 38 personnel on board including SEAL Team 6 from a range of . An earlier anti-aircraft kill by the Taliban occurred during Operation Red Wings, on June 28, 2005, when a Chinook helicopter was destroyed by unguided RPG.\nIn the period following the 2003 invasion of Iraq, the RPG-7 became a favorite weapon of the insurgent forces fighting U.S. troops. Since most of the readily available RPG-7 rounds cannot penetrate M1 Abrams tank armor from almost any angle, it is primarily effective against soft-skinned or lightly armored vehicles, and infantry. Even if the RPG hit does not completely disable the tank or kill the crew, it can still damage external equipment, lowering the tank's effectiveness or forcing the crew to abandon and destroy it. Newer RPG-7 rounds are more capable, and in August 2006, an RPG-29 round penetrated the frontal ERA of a Challenger 2 tank during an engagement in al-Amarah, Iraq, and wounded several crew members.\nRPGs were a main tool used by the FMLN's guerrilla forces in the Salvadoran Civil War. For example, during the June 19, 1986, overrun of the San Miguel Army base, FMLN sappers dressed only in black shorts, their faces blacked out with grease, sneaked through barbed wire at night, avoiding the searchlights, they made it to within firing range of the outer wall. Using RPGs to initiate the attack, they blew through the wall and killed a number of Salvadorean soldiers. They eliminated the outermost sentries and searchlights with the rockets, then made it into the inner wall, which they also punched through. They were then able to create mayhem as their comrades attacked from the outside.\nDuring the First (1994\u20131996) and Second Chechen Wars (1999\u20132009), Chechen rebels used RPGs to attack Russian tanks from basements and high rooftops. This tactic was effective because tank main guns could not be depressed or raised far enough to return fire, in addition, armor on the very top and bottom of tanks is usually the weakest. Russian forces had to rely on artillery suppression, good crew gunners and infantry screens to prevent such attacks. Tank columns were eventually protected by attached self-propelled anti-aircraft guns (ZSU-23-4 Shilka, 9K22 Tunguska) used in the ground role to suppress and destroy Chechen ambushes. Chechen fighters formed independent \"cells\" that worked together to destroy a specific Russian armored target. Each cell contained small arms and some form of RPG (RPG-7V or RPG-18, for example). The small arms were used to button the tank up and keep any infantry occupied, while the RPG gunner struck at the tank. While doing so, other teams would attempt to fire at the target in order to overwhelm the Russians' ability to effectively counter the attack. To further increase the chance of success, the teams took up positions at different elevations where possible. Firing from the third and higher floors allowed good shots at the weakest armor (the top). When the Russians began moving in tanks fitted with explosive reactive armor (ERA), the Chechens had to adapt their tactics, because the RPGs they had access to were unlikely to result in the destruction of the tank.\nUsing RPGs as improvised anti-aircraft batteries has proved successful in Somalia, Afghanistan, and Chechnya. Helicopters are typically ambushed as they land, take off or hover. In Afghanistan, the Mujahideen often modified RPGs for use against Soviet helicopters by adding a curved pipe to the rear of the launcher tube, which diverted the backblast, allowing the RPG to be fired upward at aircraft from a prone position. This made the operator less visible prior to firing and decreased the risk of injury from hot exhaust gases. The Mujahideen also utilized the 4.5-second timer on RPG rounds to make the weapon function as part of a flak battery, using multiple launchers to increase hit probabilities. At the time, Soviet helicopters countered the threat from RPGs at landing zones by first clearing them with anti-personnel saturation fire. The Soviets also varied the number of accompanying helicopters (two or three) in an effort to upset Afghan force estimations and preparation. In response, the Mujahideen prepared dug-in firing positions with top cover, and again, Soviet forces altered their tactics by using air-dropped thermobaric fuel-air bombs on such landing zones. As the U.S.-supplied Stinger surface-to-air missiles became available to them, the Afghans abandoned RPG attacks as the smart missiles proved especially efficient in the destruction of unarmed Soviet transport helicopters, such as Mil Mi-17. In Somalia, both of the UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters lost by U.S. forces during the Battle of Mogadishu in 1993 were downed by RPG-7s.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

At various times a Member of Parliament (MP) for the Labour Party and the Social Democratic Party (SDP), and a peer for the Liberal Democrats, he was Chancellor of the Exchequer and Home Secretary under the Wilson and Callaghan Governments.\nThe son of Arthur Jenkins, a coal-miner and Labour MP, Jenkins was educated at the University of Oxford and served as an intelligence officer during the Second World War. Initially elected as MP for Southwark Central in 1948, he moved to become MP for Birmingham Stechford in 1950. On the election of Harold Wilson after the 1964 election, Jenkins was appointed Minister of Aviation. A year later, he was promoted to the Cabinet to become Home Secretary. In this role, Jenkins embarked on a major reform programme; he sought to build what he described as \"a civilised society\", overseeing measures such as the effective abolition in Britain of both capital punishment and theatre censorship, the partial decriminalisation of homosexuality, relaxing of divorce law, suspension of birching and the liberalisation of abortion law.\nFollowing the devaluation crisis in November 1967, Jenkins replaced James Callaghan as Chancellor of the Exchequer. Throughout his time at the Treasury, Jenkins oversaw a tight fiscal policy in an attempt to control inflation, and oversaw a particularly tough Budget in 1968 which saw major tax rises. As a result of this, the Government's current account entered a surplus in 1969. After Labour unexpectedly lost the 1970 election, Jenkins was elected as Deputy Leader of the Labour Party in 1970. He resigned from the position in 1972 after the Labour Party decided to oppose Britain's entry to the European Communities, which he strongly supported. When Labour returned to power following the 1974 election, Wilson appointed Jenkins as Home Secretary for the second time. Two years later, when Wilson resigned as prime minister, Jenkins stood in the leadership election to succeed him, finishing third behind Michael Foot and the winner James Callaghan. He subsequently chose to resign from Parliament and leave British politics, to accept appointment as the first-ever (and so far, only) British President of the European Commission, a role he took up in January 1977.\nAfter completing his term at the Commission in 1981, Jenkins announced a surprise return to British politics; dismayed with the Labour Party's move further left under the leadership of Michael Foot, he became one of the \"Gang of Four\", senior Labour figures who broke away from the party and founded the SDP. In 1982, Jenkins won a by-election to return to Parliament as MP for Glasgow Hillhead, taking the seat from the Conservatives in a famous result. He became leader of the SDP ahead of the 1983 election, during which he formed an electoral alliance with the Liberal Party. Following his disappointment with the performance of the SDP in the election, he resigned as leader. He subsequently lost his seat in Parliament at the 1987 election to Labour's George Galloway, and accepted a life peerage shortly afterwards; he sat in the House of Lords as a Liberal Democrat.\nJenkins was later elected to succeed former prime minister Harold Macmillan as Chancellor of the University of Oxford following the latter's death; he would hold this position until his own death sixteen years later. In the late 1990s, he served as a close adviser to Prime Minister Tony Blair and chaired a major commission on electoral reform. In addition to his political career, he was also a noted historian, biographer, and writer. David Marquand described Jenkins's autobiography, \"A Life at the Centre\" (1991), as one which \"will be read with pleasure long after most examples of the genre have been forgotten\".\nEarly life (1920\u20131945).\nBorn in Abersychan, Monmouthshire, in southeastern Wales, as an only child, Roy Jenkins was the son of a National Union of Mineworkers official, Arthur Jenkins. His father was imprisoned during the 1926 General Strike for his alleged involvement in disturbances. Arthur Jenkins later became President of the South Wales Miners' Federation and Member of Parliament for Pontypool, Parliamentary Private Secretary to Clement Attlee, and briefly a minister in the 1945 Labour government. Roy Jenkins' mother, Hattie Harris, was the daughter of a steelworks foreman.\nJenkins was educated at Pentwyn Primary School, Abersychan County Grammar School, University College, Cardiff, and at Balliol College, Oxford, where he was twice defeated for the Presidency of the Oxford Union, but took a first-class degree in Politics, Philosophy and Economics (PPE). His university colleagues included Tony Crosland, Denis Healey and Edward Heath, and he became friends with all three, although he was never particularly close to Healey.\nIn John Campbell's biography, \"A Well-Rounded Life\", a romantic relationship between Jenkins and Crosland was detailed. Other figures whom he met at Oxford who would become notable in public life included Madron Seligman, Nicholas Henderson and Mark Bonham Carter.\nDuring the Second World War, Jenkins received his officer training at Alton Towers and was posted to the 55th West Somerset Yeomanry at West Lavington, Wiltshire. Through the influence of his father, in April 1944, Jenkins was sent to Bletchley Park to work as a codebreaker; while there he befriended the historian Asa Briggs.\nEarly political career (1945\u20131965).\nHaving failed to win Solihull in 1945, after which he spent a brief period working for the Industrial and Commercial Finance Corporation, he was elected to the House of Commons in a 1948 by-election as the Member of Parliament for Southwark Central, becoming the \"Baby of the House\". His constituency was abolished in boundary changes for the 1950 general election, when he stood instead in the new Birmingham Stechford constituency. He won the seat, and represented the constituency until 1977.\nIn 1947, he edited a collection of Clement Attlee's speeches, published under the title \"Purpose and Policy\". Attlee then granted Jenkins access to his private papers so that he could write his biography, which appeared in 1948 (\"Mr Attlee: An Interim Biography\"). The reviews were generally favourable, including George Orwell's in \"Tribune\".\nIn 1950, he advocated a large capital levy, abolition of public schools and introduction of a measure of industrial democracy to nationalised industries as key policy objectives for the Labour government. In 1951 \"Tribune\" published his pamphlet \"Fair Shares for the Rich\". Here, Jenkins advocated the abolition of large private incomes by taxing them, graduating from 50 per cent for incomes between \u00a320,000 and \u00a330,000 to 95 per cent for incomes over \u00a3100,000. He also proposed further nationalisations and said: \"Future nationalisations will be more concerned with equality than with planning, and this means that we can leave the monolithic public corporation behind us and look for more intimate forms of ownership and control\". He later described this \"almost Robespierrean\" pamphlet as \"the apogee of my excursion to the left\".\nJenkins contributed an essay on 'Equality' to the 1952 collection \"New Fabian Essays\". In 1953 appeared \"Pursuit of Progress\", a work intended to counter Bevanism. Retreating from what he had demanded in \"Fair Shares for the Rich\", Jenkins now argued that the redistribution of wealth would occur over a generation and abandoned the goal of public school abolition. However, he still proposed further nationalisations: \"It is quite impossible to advocate both the abolition of great inequalities of wealth and the acceptance of a one-quarter public sector and three-quarters private sector arrangement. A mixed economy there will undoubtedly be, certainly for many decades and perhaps permanently, but it will need to be mixed in very different proportions from this\". He also opposed the Bevanites' neutralist foreign policy platform: \"Neutrality is essentially a conservative policy, a policy of defeat, of announcing to the world that we have nothing to say to which the world will listen. ... Neutrality could never be acceptable to anyone who believes that he has a universal faith to preach\". Jenkins argued that the Labour leadership needed to take on and defeat the neutralists and pacifists in the party; it would be better to risk a split in the party than face \"the destruction, by schism, perhaps for a generation, of the whole progressive movement in the country\".\nBetween 1951 and 1956, he wrote a weekly column for the Indian newspaper \"The Current\". Here he advocated progressive reforms such as equal pay, the decriminalisation of homosexuality, the liberalisation of the obscenity laws and the abolition of capital punishment. \"Mr Balfour's Poodle\", a short account of the House of Lords crisis of 1911 that culminated in the Parliament Act 1911, was published in 1954. Favourable reviewers included A. J. P. Taylor, Harold Nicolson, Leonard Woolf and Violet Bonham Carter. After a suggestion by Mark Bonham Carter, Jenkins then wrote a biography of the Victorian radical, Sir Charles Dilke, which was published in October 1958. Between 1955 and 1958 Jenkins served on the Board of Governors of the British Film Institute.\nDuring the 1956 Suez Crisis, Jenkins denounced Anthony Eden's \"squalid imperialist adventure\" at a Labour rally in Birmingham Town Hall. Three years later he claimed that \"Suez was a totally unsuccessful attempt to achieve unreasonable and undesirable objectives by methods which were at once reckless and immoral; and the consequences, as was well deserved, were humiliating and disastrous\".\nJenkins praised Anthony Crosland's 1956 work \"The Future of Socialism\" as \"the most important book on socialist theory\" since Evan Durbin's \"The Politics of Democratic Socialism\" (1940). With much of the economy now nationalised, Jenkins argued, socialists should concentrate on eliminating the remaining pockets of poverty and on the removal of class barriers, as well as promoting libertarian social reforms. Jenkins was principal sponsor, in 1959, of the bill which became the liberalising Obscene Publications Act, responsible for establishing the \"liable to deprave and corrupt\" criterion as a basis for a prosecution of suspect material and for specifying literary merit as a possible defence.\nIn July 1959, Penguin published Jenkins' \"The Labour Case\", timed to anticipate the upcoming election. Jenkins argued that Britain's chief danger was that of \"living sullenly in the past, of believing that the world has a duty to keep us in the station to which we are accustomed, and showing bitter resentment if it does not do so\". He added: \"Our neighbours in Europe are roughly our economic and military equals. We would do better to live gracefully with them than to waste our substance by trying unsuccessfully to keep up with the power giants of the modern world\". Jenkins claimed that the Attlee government concentrated \"too much towards the austerity of fair shares, and too little towards the incentives of free consumers' choice\". Although he still believed in the elimination of poverty and more equality, Jenkins now argued that these aims could be achieved by economic growth. In the final chapter ('Is Britain Civilised?') Jenkins set out a list of necessary progressive social reforms: the abolition of the death penalty, decriminalisation of homosexuality, abolition of the Lord Chamberlain's powers of theatre censorship, liberalisation of the licensing and betting laws, liberalisation of the divorce laws, legalisation of abortion, decriminalisation of suicide and more liberal immigration laws. Jenkins concluded:\nLet us be on the side of those who want people to be free to live their own lives, to make their own mistakes, and to decide, in an adult way and provided they do not infringe the rights of others, the code by which they wish to live; and on the side of experiment and brightness, of better buildings and better food, of better music (jazz as well as Bach) and better books, of fuller lives and greater freedom. In the long run these things will be more important than the most perfect of economic policies.\nIn the aftermath of Labour's 1959 defeat, Jenkins appeared on \"Panorama\" and argued that Labour should abandon further nationalisation, question its connection with the trade unions and not dismiss a closer association with the Liberal Party. In November he delivered a Fabian Society lecture in which he blamed Labour's defeat on the unpopularity of nationalisation and he repeated this in an article for \"The Spectator\". His \"Spectator\" article also called for Britain to accept its diminished place in the world, to grant colonial freedom, to spend more on public services and to promote the right of individuals to live their own lives free from the constraints of popular prejudices and state interference. Jenkins later called it a \"good radical programme, although...not a socialist one\".\nIn May 1960, Jenkins joined the Campaign for Democratic Socialism, a Gaitskellite pressure group designed to fight against left-wing domination of the Labour Party. In July 1960 Jenkins resigned from his frontbench role in order to be able to campaign freely for British membership of the Common Market. At the 1960 Labour Party conference in Scarborough, Jenkins advocated rewriting Clause IV of the party's constitution but he was booed. In November he wrote in \"The Spectator\" that \"unless the Labour Party is determined to abdicate its role as a mass party and become nothing more than a narrow sectarian society, its paramount task is to represent the whole of the Leftward-thinking half of the country\u2014and to offer the prospect of attracting enough marginal support to give that half some share of power\".\nDuring 1960\u201362, his main campaign was British membership of the Common Market, where he became Labour's leading advocate of entry. When Harold Macmillan initiated the first British application to join the Common Market in 1961, Jenkins became deputy chairman of the all-party Common Market Campaign and then chairman of the Labour Common Market Committee. At the 1961 Labour Party conference Jenkins spoke in favour of Britain's entry.\nSince 1959, Jenkins had been working on a biography of the Liberal Prime Minister, H. H. Asquith. For Jenkins, Asquith ranked with Attlee as the embodiment of the moderate, liberal intelligence in politics that he most admired. Through Asquith's grandson, Mark Bonham Carter, Jenkins had access to Asquith's letters to his mistress, Venetia Stanley. Kenneth Rose, Michael Foot, Asa Briggs and John Grigg all favourably reviewed the book when it was published in October 1964. However, Violet Bonham Carter wrote a defence of her father in \"The Times\" against the few criticisms of Asquith in the book, and Robert Rhodes James wrote in \"The Spectator\" that \"Asquith was surely a tougher, stronger, more acute man...than Mr. Jenkins would have us believe. The fascinating enigma of his complete decline is never really analysed, nor even understood. ... We required a Sutherland: but we have got an Annigoni\". John Campbell claims that \"for half a century it has remained unchallenged as the best biography and is rightly regarded as a classic\".\nLike Healey and Crosland, he had been a close friend of Hugh Gaitskell and for them Gaitskell's death and the elevation of Harold Wilson as Labour Party leader was a setback. For Jenkins, Gaitskell would remain his political hero. After the 1964 general election Jenkins was appointed Minister of Aviation and was sworn of the Privy Council. While at Aviation he oversaw the high-profile cancellations of the BAC TSR-2 and Concorde projects (although the latter was later reversed after strong opposition from the French Government). In January 1965 Patrick Gordon Walker resigned as Foreign Secretary and in the ensuing reshuffle Wilson offered Jenkins the Department for Education and Science; however, he declined it, preferring to stay at Aviation.\nHome Secretary (1965\u20131967).\nIn the summer of 1965, Jenkins eagerly accepted an offer to replace Frank Soskice as Home Secretary. However Wilson, dismayed by a sudden bout of press speculation about the potential move, delayed Jenkins' appointment until December. Once Jenkins took office \u2013 the youngest Home Secretary since Churchill \u2013 he immediately set about reforming the operation and organisation of the Home Office. The Principal Private Secretary, Head of the Press and Publicity Department and Permanent Under-Secretary were all replaced. He also redesigned his office, famously replacing the board on which condemned prisoners were listed with a fridge.\nFollowing the 1966 general election, in which Labour won a comfortable majority, Jenkins pushed through a series of police reforms which reduced the number of separate forces from 117 to 49. \"The Times\" called it \"the greatest upheaval in policing since the time of Peel\". His visit to Chicago in September (to study their policing methods) convinced him of the need to introduce two-way radios to the police; whereas the Metropolitan Police possessed 25 radios in 1965, Jenkins increased this to 2,500, and provided similar numbers of radios to the rest of the country's police forces. Jenkins also provided the police with more car radios, which made the police more mobile but reduced the amount of time they spent patrolling the streets. His Criminal Justice Act 1967 introduced more stringent controls on the purchase of shotguns, outlawed last-minute alibis and introduced majority verdicts in juries in England and Wales. The Act was also designed to lower the prison population by the introduction of release under licence, easier bail, suspended sentences and earlier parole.\nImmigration was a divisive and provocative issue during the late 1960s and on 23 May 1966 Jenkins delivered a speech on race relations, which is widely considered to be one of his best. Addressing a London meeting of the National Committee for Commonwealth Immigrants he notably defined Integration:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;...\u00a0not as a flattening process of assimilation but as equal opportunity, accompanied by cultural diversity, in an atmosphere of mutual tolerance.\nBefore going on to ask:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Where in the world is there a university which could preserve its fame, or a cultural centre which could keep its eminence, or a metropolis which could hold its drawing power, if it were to turn inwards and serve only its own hinterland and its own racial group?\nAnd concluding that:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBy the end of 1966, Jenkins was the Cabinet's rising star; the \"Guardian\" called him the best Home Secretary of the century \"and quite possibly the best since Peel\", the \"Sunday Times\" called him Wilson's most likeliest successor and the \"New Statesman\" labelled him \"Labour's Crown Prince\".\nIn a speech to the London Labour Conference in May 1967, Jenkins said his vision was of \"a more civilised, more free and less hidebound society\" and he further claimed that \"to enlarge the area of individual choice, socially, politically and economically, not just for a few but for the whole community, is very much what democratic socialism is about\". He gave strong personal support to David Steel's Private Member's Bill for the legalisation of abortion, which became the Abortion Act 1967, telling the Commons that \"the existing law on abortion is uncertain and...harsh and archaic\", adding that \"the law is consistently flouted by those who have the means to do so. It is, therefore, very much a question of one law for the rich and one law for the poor\". When the Bill looked likely to be dropped due to insufficient time, Jenkins helped ensure that it received enough parliamentary time to pass and he voted for it in every division.\nJenkins also supported Leo Abse's bill for the decriminalisation of homosexuality, which became the Sexual Offences Act 1967. Jenkins told the Commons: \"It would be a mistake to think...that by what we are doing tonight we are giving a vote of confidence or congratulation to homosexuality. Those who suffer from this disability carry a great weight of loneliness, guilt and shame. The crucial question...is, should we add to those disadvantages the full rigour of the criminal law? By its overwhelming decisions, the House has given a fairly clear answer, and I hope that the Bill will now make rapid progress towards the Statute Book. It will be an important and civilising Measure\".\nJenkins also abolished the use of flogging in prisons. In July 1967 Jenkins recommended to the Home Affairs Select Committee a bill to end the Lord Chamberlain's power to censor the theatre. This was passed as the Theatres Act 1968 under Jenkins' successor as Home Secretary, James Callaghan. Jenkins also announced that he would introduce legislation banning racial discrimination in employment, which was embodied in the Race Relations Act 1968 passed under Callaghan. In October 1967 Jenkins planned to introduce legislation that would enable him to keep out the 20,000 Kenyan Asians who held British passports (this was passed four months later under Callaghan as the Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1968, which was based on Jenkins' draft).\nJenkins is often seen as responsible for the most wide-ranging social reforms of the late 1960s, with popular historian Andrew Marr claiming \"the greatest changes of the Labour years\" were thanks to Jenkins. These reforms would not have happened when they did, earlier than in most other European countries, if Jenkins had not supported them. In a speech in Abingdon in July 1969, Jenkins said that the \"permissive society\" had been allowed to become a dirty phrase: \"A better phrase is the 'civilized society', based on the belief that different individuals will wish to make different decisions about their patterns of behaviour and that, provided these do not restrict the freedom of others, they should be allowed to do so within a framework of understanding and tolerance\". Jenkins' words were immediately reported in the press as \"The permissive society is the civilised society\", which he later wrote \"was not all that far from my meaning\".\nFor some conservatives, such as Peter Hitchens, Jenkins' reforms remain objectionable. In his book \"The Abolition of Britain\", Hitchens accuses him of being a \"cultural revolutionary\" who takes a large part of the responsibility for the decline of \"traditional values\" in Britain. During the 1980s Margaret Thatcher and Norman Tebbit would blame Jenkins for family breakdowns, the decline of respect for authority and the decline of social responsibility. Jenkins replied by pointing out that Thatcher, with her large parliamentary majorities, never attempted to reverse his reforms.\nChancellor of the Exchequer (1967\u20131970).\nFrom 1967 to 1970 Jenkins served as Chancellor of the Exchequer, replacing James Callaghan following the devaluation crisis of November 1967. Jenkins' ultimate goal as Chancellor was economic growth, which depended on restoring stability to sterling at its new value after devaluation. This could only be achieved by ensuring a surplus in the balance of payments, which had been in a deficit for the previous five years. Therefore, Jenkins pursued deflation, including cuts in public expenditure and increases in taxation, in order to ensure that resources went into exports rather than domestic consumption. Jenkins warned the House of Commons in January 1968 that there was \"two years of hard slog ahead\".\nHe quickly gained a reputation as a particularly tough Chancellor with his 1968 budget increasing taxes by \u00a3923\u00a0million, more than twice the increase of any previous budget to date. Jenkins had warned the Cabinet that a second devaluation would occur in three months if his budget did not restore confidence in sterling. He restored prescription charges (which had been abolished when Labour returned to office in 1964) and postponed the raising of the school leaving age to 16 to 1973 instead of 1971. Housing and road building plans were also heavily cut, and he also accelerated Britain's withdrawal East of Suez. Jenkins ruled out increasing the income tax and so raised the taxes on: drinks and cigarettes (except on beer), purchase tax, petrol duty, road tax, a 50 per cent rise in Selective Employment Tax and a one-off Special Charge on personal incomes. He also paid for an increase in family allowances by cutting child tax allowances.\nDespite Edward Heath claiming it was a \"hard, cold budget, without any glimmer of warmth\" Jenkins' first budget broadly received a warm reception, with Harold Wilson remarking that \"it was widely acclaimed as a speech of surpassing quality and elegance\" and Barbara Castle that it \"took everyone's breath away\". Richard Crossman said it was \"genuinely based on socialist principles, fair in the fullest sense by really helping people at the bottom of the scale and by really taxing the wealthy\". In his budget broadcast on 19 March, Jenkins said that Britain had been living in a \"fool's paradise\" for years and that it was \"importing too much, exporting too little and paying ourselves too much\", with a lower standard of living than France or West Germany.\nJenkins' supporters in the Parliamentary Labour Party became known as the \"Jenkinsites\". These were usually younger, middle-class and university-educated ex-Gaitskellites such as Bill Rodgers, David Owen, Roy Hattersley, Dick Taverne, John Mackintosh and David Marquand. In May\u2013July 1968, some of his supporters, led by Patrick Gordon Walker and Christopher Mayhew, plotted to replace Wilson with Jenkins as Labour leader but he declined to challenge Wilson. A year later his supporters again attempted to persuade Jenkins to challenge Wilson for the party leadership but he again declined. He later wrote in his memoirs that the 1968 plot was \"for me...the equivalent of the same season of 1953 for Rab Butler. Having faltered for want of single-minded ruthlessness when there was no alternative to himself, he then settled down to a career punctuated by increasingly wide misses of the premiership. People who effectively seize the prime ministership \u2013 Lloyd George, Macmillan, Mrs Thatcher \u2013 do not let such moments slip\".\nIn April 1968, with Britain's reserves declining by approximately \u00a3500 million every quarter, Jenkins went to Washington to obtain a $1,400 million loan from the International Monetary Fund. Following a further sterling crisis in November 1968, Jenkins was forced to raise taxes by a further \u00a3250\u00a0million. After this the currency markets slowly began to settle and his 1969 budget represented more of the same with a \u00a3340\u00a0million increase in taxation to further limit consumption.\nBy May 1969, Britain's current account position was in surplus, thanks to a growth in exports, a drop in overall consumption and, in part, the Inland Revenue correcting a previous underestimation in export figures. In July Jenkins was also able to announce that the size of Britain's foreign currency reserves had been increased by almost $1\u00a0billion since the beginning of the year. It was at this time that he presided over Britain's only excess of government revenue over expenditure in the period 1936\u20137 to 1987\u20138. Thanks in part to these successes, there was a high expectation that the 1970 budget would be a more generous one. Jenkins, however, was cautious about the stability of Britain's recovery and decided to present a more muted and fiscally neutral budget. It is often argued that this, combined with a series of bad trade figures, contributed to the Conservative victory at the 1970 general election. Historians and economists have often praised Jenkins for presiding over the transformation in Britain's fiscal and current account positions towards the end of the 1960s. Andrew Marr, for example, described him as one of the 20th century's \"most successful chancellors\". Alec Cairncross considered Jenkins \"the ablest of the four Chancellors I served\".\nPublic expenditure as a proportion of GDP rose from 44 per cent in 1964 to around 50 per cent in 1970. Despite Jenkins' warnings about inflation, wage settlements in 1969\u201370 increased on average by 13 per cent and contributed to the high inflation of the early 1970s and consequently negated most of Jenkins' efforts to obtain a balance of payments surplus.\nShadow Cabinet (1970\u20131974).\nAfter Labour unexpectedly lost power in 1970, Jenkins was appointed Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer by Harold Wilson. Jenkins was also subsequently elected to the deputy leadership of the Labour Party in July 1970, defeating future Labour Leader Michael Foot and former Leader of the Commons Fred Peart at the first ballot. At this time he appeared the natural successor to Harold Wilson, and it appeared to many only a matter of time before he inherited the leadership of the party, and the opportunity to become prime minister.\nThis changed completely, however, as Jenkins refused to accept the tide of anti-European feeling that became prevalent in the Labour Party in the early 1970s. After a special conference on the EEC was held by the Labour Party on 17 July 1971, which Jenkins was forbidden to address, he delivered one of the most powerful speeches of his career. Jenkins told a meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party on 19 July: \"At conference the only alternative [to the EEC] we heard was 'socialism in one country'. That is always good for a cheer. Pull up the drawbridge and revolutionize the fortress. That's not a policy either: it's just a slogan, and it is one which becomes not merely unconvincing but hypocritical as well when it is dressed up as our best contribution to international socialism\". This reopened the old Bevanite\u2013Gaitskellite divide in the Party; Wilson told Tony Benn the day after Jenkins' speech that he was determined to smash the Campaign for Democratic Socialism.\nAt the 1971 Labour Party conference in Brighton, the NEC's motion to reject the \"Tory terms\" of entry into the EEC was carried by a large majority. Jenkins told a fringe meeting that this would have no effect on his continued support for Britain's entry. Benn said Jenkins was \"the figure dominating this Conference; there is no question about it\". On 28 October 1971, he led 69 Labour MPs through the division lobby in support of the Heath government's motion to take Britain into the EEC. In so doing, they were defying a three-line whip and a five-to-one vote at the Labour Party annual conference. Jenkins later wrote: \"I was convinced that it was one of the decisive votes of the century, and had no intention of spending the rest of my life answering the question of what did I do in the great division by saying 'I abstained'. I saw it in the context of the first Reform Bill, the repeal of the Corn Laws, Gladstone's Home Rule Bills, the Lloyd George Budget and the Parliament Bill, the Munich Agreement and the May 1940 votes\".\nJenkins' action gave the European cause a legitimacy that would have otherwise been absent had the issue been considered solely as a party political matter. However, he was now regarded by the left as a \"traitor\". James Margach wrote in the \"Sunday Times\": \"The unconcealed objective of the Left now is either to humiliate Roy Jenkins and his allies into submission \u2013 or drive them from the party\". At this stage, however, Jenkins would not fully abandon his position as a political insider, and chose to stand again for deputy leader, an act his colleague David Marquand claimed he later came to regret. Jenkins promised not to vote with the government again and he narrowly defeated Michael Foot on a second ballot.\nIn accordance with the party whip, Jenkins voted against European Communities Bill 55 times. However, he resigned both the deputy leadership and his shadow cabinet position in April 1972, after the party committed itself to holding a referendum on Britain's membership of the EEC. This led to some former admirers, including Roy Hattersley, choosing to distance themselves from Jenkins. Hattersley later claimed that Jenkins' resignation was \"the moment when the old Labour coalition began to collapse and the eventual formation of a new centre party became inevitable\". In his resignation letter to Wilson, Jenkins said that if there were a referendum \"the Opposition would form a temporary coalition of those who, whatever their political views, were against the proposed action. By this means we would have forged a more powerful continuing weapon against progressive legislation than anything we have known in this country since the curbing of the absolute powers of the old House of Lords\".\nJenkins' lavish lifestyle\u00a0\u2014 Wilson once described him as \"more a socialite than a socialist\"\u00a0\u2014 had already alienated much of the Labour Party from him.\nIn May 1972, he collected the Charlemagne Prize, which he had been awarded for promoting European unity. In September an ORC opinion poll found that there was considerable public support for an alliance between the 'moderate' wing of the Labour Party and the Liberals; 35 per cent said they would vote for a Labour\u2013Liberal alliance, 27 per cent for the Conservatives and 23.5 per cent for 'Socialist Labour'. \"The Times\" claimed that there were \"twelve million Jenkinsites\". During the spring and summer of 1972, Jenkins delivered a series of speeches designed to set out his leadership credentials. These were published in September under the title \"What Matters Now\", which sold well. In the book's postscript, Jenkins said that Labour should not be a narrow socialist party advocating unpopular left-wing policies but must aim to \"represent the hopes and aspirations of the whole leftward thinking half of the country\", adding that a \"broad-based, international, radical, generous-minded party could quickly seize the imagination of a disillusioned and uninspired British public\".\nFollowing Dick Taverne's victory in the 1973 Lincoln by-election, where he stood as \"Democratic Labour\" in opposition to the official Labour candidate, Jenkins gave a speech to the Oxford University Labour Club denouncing the idea of a new centre party. Jenkins was elected to the shadow cabinet in November 1973 as Shadow Home Secretary. During the February 1974 election, Jenkins rallied to Labour and his campaign was described by David Butler and Dennis Kavanagh as sounding \"a note of civilised idealism\". Jenkins was disappointed that the Liberal candidate in his constituency won 6000 votes; he wrote in his memoirs that \"I already regarded myself as such a closet Liberal that I na\u00efvely thought they ought nearly all to have come to me\".\nJenkins wrote a series of biographical essays that appeared in \"The Times\" during 1971\u201374 and which were published as \"Nine Men of Power\" in 1974. Jenkins chose Gaitskell, Ernest Bevin, Stafford Cripps, Adlai Stevenson II, Robert F. Kennedy, Joseph McCarthy, Lord Halifax, L\u00e9on Blum and John Maynard Keynes. In 1971 Jenkins delivered three lectures on foreign policy at Yale University, published a year later as \"Afternoon on the Potomac?\"\nHome Secretary (1974\u20131976).\nWhen Labour returned to power in early 1974, Jenkins was appointed Home Secretary for the second time. Earlier, he had been promised the treasury; however, Wilson later decided to appoint Denis Healey as Chancellor instead. Upon hearing from Bernard Donoughue that Wilson had reneged on his promise, Jenkins reacted angrily. Despite being on a public staircase, he is reported to have shouted \"You tell Harold Wilson he must bloody well come to see me\u00a0...and if he doesn't watch out, I won't join his bloody government\u00a0... This is typical of the bloody awful way Harold Wilson does things!\" The Jenkinsites were dismayed by Jenkins' refusal to insist upon the Chancellorship and began to look elsewhere for leadership, thus ending the Jenkinsites as a united group.\nJenkins served from 1974 to 1976. Whereas during his first period as Home Secretary in the 1960s the atmosphere had been optimistic and confident, the climate of the 1970s was much more fractious and disillusioned. After two Northern Irish sisters, Marian Price and Dolours Price, were imprisoned for 20 years for the 1973 Old Bailey bombing, they went on hunger strike in order to be transferred to a prison in Northern Ireland. In a television broadcast in June 1974, Jenkins announced that he would refuse to give in to their demands, although in March 1975 he discreetly transferred them to a Northern Irish prison.\nHe undermined his previous liberal credentials to some extent by pushing through the controversial Prevention of Terrorism Act in the aftermath of the Birmingham pub bombings of November 1974, which, among other things, extended the length of time suspects could be held in custody and instituted exclusion orders. Jenkins also resisted calls for the death penalty to be restored for terrorist murderers. On 4 December he told the Cabinet committee on Northern Ireland that \"everything he heard made him more convinced that Northern Ireland had nothing to do with the rest of the UK\". When reviewing Garret FitzGerald's memoirs in 1991, Jenkins proclaimed: \"My natural prejudices, such as they are, are much more green than orange. I am a poor unionist, believing intuitively that even Paisley and Haughey are better at dealing with each other than the English are with either\".\nThe Sex Discrimination Act 1975 (which legislated for gender equality and set up the Equal Opportunities Commission) and the Race Relations Act 1976 (which extended to private clubs the outlawing of racial discrimination and founded the Commission for Racial Equality) were two notable achievements during his second time as Home Secretary.\nJenkins opposed Michael Foot's attempts to grant pickets the right to stop lorries during strikes and he was dismayed by Anthony Crosland's decision to grant an amnesty to the 11 Labour councillors at Clay Cross who had been surcharged for refusing to increase council rents in accordance with the Conservatives' Housing Finance Act 1972. After two trade unionists, Ricky Tomlinson and Des Warren (known as the \"Shrewsbury Two\"), were imprisoned for intimidation and affray for their part in a strike, Jenkins refused to accede to demands from the labour movement that they should be released. This demonstrated Jenkins' increasing estrangement from much of the labour movement and for a time he was heckled in public by people chanting \"Free the Two\". Jenkins also unsuccessfully tried to persuade the Cabinet to adopt electoral reform in the form of proportional representation and to have the Official Secrets Act 1911 liberalised to facilitate more open government.\nAlthough becoming increasingly disillusioned during this time by what he considered the party's drift to the left, he was the leading Labour figure in the EEC referendum of June 1975 (and was also president of the 'Yes' campaign). In September 1974 he had followed Shirley Williams in stating that he \"could not stay in a Cabinet which had to carry out withdrawal\" from the EEC. During the referendum campaign, Tony Benn claimed that 500,000 jobs had been lost due to Britain's membership; Jenkins replied on 27 May that \"I find it increasingly difficult to take Mr Benn seriously as an economics minister\". He added that Britain outside the EEC would enter \"an old people's home for fading nations. ... I do not even think it would be a comfortable or agreeable old people's home. I do not much like the look of some of the prospective wardens\". The two men debated Britain's membership together on \"Panorama\", which was chaired by David Dimbleby. According to David Butler and Uwe Kitzinger, \"they achieved a decidedly more lucid and intricate level of discussion than is commonly seen on political television\". Jenkins found it congenial to work with the centrists of all parties in the campaign and the 'Yes' campaign won by two to one.\nAfter the referendum, Wilson demoted Benn to Energy Secretary and attempted to balance the downgrading of Benn with the dismissal of the right-wing minister Reg Prentice from the Department of Education, despite already promising Jenkins that he had no intention of sacking Prentice. Jenkins threatened to resign if Prentice was sacked, telling Wilson that he was \"a squalid little man who was using squalid little arguments in order to explain why he was performing so much below the level of events\". Wilson quickly backed down. In September Jenkins delivered a speech in Prentice's constituency of Newham to demonstrate solidarity with him after he was threatened with deselection by left-wingers in the constituency party. Jenkins was heckled by both far-left and far-right demonstrators and he was hit in the chest by a flour bomb thrown by a member of the National Front. Jenkins warned that if Prentice was deselected \"it is not just the local party that is undermining its own foundations by ignoring the beliefs and feelings of ordinary people, the whole legitimate Labour Party, left as well as right, is crippled if extremists have their way\". He added that if \"tolerance is shattered formidable consequences will follow. Labour MPs will either have to become creatures of cowardice, concealing their views, trimming their sails, accepting orders, stilling their consciences, or they will all have to be men far far to the left of those whose votes they seek. Either would make a mockery of parliamentary democracy\".\nIn January 1976, he further distanced himself from the left with a speech in Anglesey, where he repudiated ever-higher public spending: \"I do not think you can push public expenditure significantly above 60 per cent [of GNP] and maintain the values of a plural society with adequate freedom of choice. We are here close to one of the frontiers of social democracy\". A former supporter, Roy Hattersley, distanced himself from Jenkins after this speech.\nIn May 1976, he told the Police Federation conference to \"be prepared first to look at the evidence and to recognize how little the widespread use of prison reduces our crime or deals effectively with many of the individuals concerned\". He also responded to the Federation's proposals on law and order: \"I respect your right to put them to me. You will no doubt respect my right to tell you that I do not think all the points in sum amount to a basis for a rational penal policy\".\nWhen Wilson suddenly resigned as prime minister in March 1976, Jenkins was one of six candidates for the leadership of the Labour Party but came third in the first ballot, behind Callaghan and Michael Foot. Realising that his vote was lower than expected, and sensing that the parliamentary party was in no mood to overlook his actions five years before, he immediately withdrew from the contest. On issues such as the EEC, trade union reform and economic policy he had proclaimed views opposite to those held by the majority of Labour Party activists, and his libertarian social views were at variance with the majority of Labour voters. A famous story alleged that when one of Jenkins' supporters canvassed a group of miners' MPs in the Commons' tea-room, he was told: \"Nay, lad, we're all Labour here\".\nJenkins had wanted to become Foreign Secretary, but Foot warned Callaghan that the party would not accept the pro-European Jenkins as Foreign Secretary. Callaghan instead offered Jenkins the Treasury in six months' time (when it would be possible to move Denis Healey to the Foreign Office). Jenkins turned the offer down. Jenkins then accepted an appointment as President of the European Commission (succeeding Fran\u00e7ois-Xavier Ortoli) after Callaghan appointed Anthony Crosland to the Foreign Office.\nPresident of the European Commission (1977\u20131981).\nIn an interview with \"The Times\" in January 1977, Jenkins said that: \"My wish is to build an effective united Europe. ... I want to move towards a more effectively organized Europe politically and economically and as far as I am concerned I want to go faster, not slower\". The main development overseen by the Jenkins Commission was the development of the Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union from 1977, which began in 1979 as the European Monetary System, a forerunner of the Single Currency or Euro. His biographer calls Jenkins \"the godfather of the euro\" and claims that among his successors only Jacques Delors has made more impact.\nIn a speech in Florence in October 1977, Jenkins argued that monetary union would facilitate \"a more efficient and developed rationalisation of industry and commerce than is possible under a Customs Union alone\". He added that \"a major new international currency\" would form \"a joint and alternative pillar of the world monetary system\" which would lead to greater international stability. Monetary union would also combat inflation by controlling the money supply. Jenkins conceded that this would involve the diminution of national sovereignty but he pointed out that \"governments which do not discipline themselves already find themselves accepting very sharp surveillance\" from the IMF. Monetary union would also promote employment and diminish regional differences. Jenkins ended the speech by quoting Jean Monnet's statement that politics was \"not only the art of the possible, but...the art of making possible tomorrow what may seem impossible today\".\nPresident Jenkins was the first president to attend a G8 summit on behalf of the Community. He received an Honorary Degree (Doctor of Laws) from the University of Bath in 1978.\nIn October 1978, \"Tribune\" reported (falsely) that Jenkins and his wife had not paid their Labour Party subscription for several years. After this was repeated in the national press, Jenkins' drafted his wife's letter to \"The Times\" that refuted the allegation. Jenkins blamed the story on a \"malicious Trot in the North Kensington Labour Party\". Jenkins was disillusioned with the Labour Party and he was almost certain that he could not stand again as a Labour candidate; in January 1979 he told Shirley Williams that the \"big mistake we had made was not to go and support Dick Taverne in 1973; everything had got worse since then\".\nHe did not vote in the 1979 election. After the Conservatives won the election Margaret Thatcher contemplated appointing Jenkins Chancellor of the Exchequer on the strength of his success at cutting public expenditure when he was Chancellor. However, his friend Woodrow Wyatt claimed that Jenkins \"had other and fresh fish to fry\".\nThe Director-General of the BBC, Ian Trethowan, invited Jenkins to deliver the Richard Dimbleby Lecture for 1979, which he did on 22 November. The title Jenkins gave to his lecture, \"Home Thoughts from Abroad\", derived from a Robert Browning poem. He delivered it in the Royal Society of Arts and it was broadcast live on television. Jenkins analysed the decline of the two-party system since 1951 and criticised the excessive partisanship of British politics, which he claimed alienated the bulk of voters, who were more centrist. He advocated proportional representation and the acceptance of \"the broad line of division between the public and private sectors\", a middle way between Thatcherism and Bennism. Jenkins said that the private sector should be encouraged without too much interference to create as much wealth as possible \"but use the wealth so created both to give a return for enterprise and to spread the benefits throughout society in a way that avoids the disfigurements of poverty, gives a full priority to public education and health services, and encourages co-operation and not conflict in industry and throughout society\". He then reiterated his long-standing commitment to libertarianism:\nYou also make sure that the state knows its place...in relation to the citizen. You are in favour of the right of dissent and the liberty of private conduct. You are against unnecessary centralization and bureaucracy. You want to devolve decision-making wherever you sensibly can. ... You want the nation to be self-confident and outward-looking, rather than insular, xenophobic and suspicious. You want the class system to fade without being replaced either by an aggressive and intolerant proletarianism or by the dominance of the brash and selfish values of a 'get rich quick' society. ... These are some of the objectives which I believe could be assisted by a strengthening of the radical centre.\n\"The Listener\" reprinted the text along with assessments by Enoch Powell, Paul Johnson, Jack Jones, J. A. G. Griffith, Bernard Crick, Neil Kinnock and Jo Grimond. They were all critical; Kinnock thought him misguided as Britain had already suffered from centrist rule for thirty years and Grimond complained that Jenkins' clarion call had come 20 years too late.\nJenkins' last year as President of the European Commission was dominated by Margaret Thatcher's fight for a rebate on Britain's contribution to the EEC budget. He believed that the quarrel was unnecessary and regretted that it soured Britain's relationship with the Community for years. In November 1980 Jenkins delivered the Winston Churchill memorial lecture in Luxembourg, where he proposed a solution to the British budgetary question. The proportion of the Community's budget spent on agriculture should be reduced by extending Community spending into new areas where Britain would receive more benefit, such as regional spending. The size of the Community's budget would, in his scheme, be tripled by transferring from the nation states to the Community competence over social and industrial policy.\nSocial Democratic Party (1981\u20131987).\nFollowing his Dimbleby Lecture, Jenkins increasingly favoured the formation of a new social democratic party. He publicly aired these views in a speech to the Parliamentary Press Gallery in June 1980, where he repeated his criticisms of the two-party system and attacked Labour's move to the left. At the previous month's Wembley conference, Labour had adopted a programme which included non-cooperation with the EEC and \"a near neutralist and unilateralist\" defence policy that would, Jenkins argued, render meaningless Britain's NATO membership. Labour's proposals for further nationalisation and anti-private enterprise policies, Jenkins claimed, were more extreme than in any other democratic country and it was not \"by any stretch of the imagination a social democratic programme\". He added that a new party could reshape politics and lead to the \"rapid revival of liberal social democratic Britain\".\nThe Labour Party conference at Blackpool in September 1980 adopted a unilateralist defence policy, withdrawal from the EEC and further nationalisation, along with Tony Benn's demands for the mandatory reselection of MPs and an electoral college to elect the party leader. In November Labour MPs elected the left-winger Michael Foot over the right-wing Denis Healey and in January 1981 Labour's Wembley conference decided that the electoral college that would elect the leader would give the trade unions 40 per cent of the vote, with MPs and constituency parties 30 per cent each. Jenkins then joined David Owen, Bill Rodgers and Shirley Williams (known as the \"Gang of Four\") in issuing the Limehouse Declaration. This called for the \"realignment of British politics\". They then formed the Social Democratic Party (SDP) on 26 March.\nJenkins delivered a series of speeches setting out the SDP's alternative to Thatcherism and Bennism and argued that the solution to Britain's economic troubles lay in the revenue from North Sea oil, which should be invested in public services. He attempted to re-enter Parliament at the Warrington by-election in July 1981 and campaigned on a six-point programme which he put forward as a Keynesian alternative to Thatcherism and Labour's \"siege economy\", but Labour retained the seat with a small majority.\nDespite it being a defeat, the by-election demonstrated that the SDP was a serious force. Jenkins said after the count that it was the first parliamentary election that he had lost in many years, but was \"by far the greatest victory in which I have ever participated\".\nAt the SDP's first annual conference in October 1981, Jenkins called for \"an end to the futile frontier war between public and private sectors\" and proposed an \"inflation tax\" on excessive pay rises that would restrain rising wages and prices. After achieving this, an SDP government would be able to embark on economic expansion to reduce unemployment.\nIn March 1982, he fought the Glasgow Hillhead by-election, in what had previously been a Conservative-held seat. Polls at the beginning of the campaign put Jenkins in third place but after a series of ten well-attended public meetings which Jenkins addressed, the tide began to turn in Jenkins' favour, and he was elected with a majority of just over 2,000 on a swing of 19 per cent. The evening after his victory in Hillhead Jenkins told a celebration dinner of 200 party members held at the North British Hotel in Edinburgh \"that the SDP had a great opportunity to become the majority party\". Jenkins' first intervention in the House of Commons following his election, on 31 March, was seen as a disappointment. The Conservative MP Alan Clark wrote in his diary:\nJenkins, with excessive and almost unbearable gravitas, asked three very heavy statesman-like non-party-political questions of the PM. I suppose he is very formidable, but he was so portentous and long-winded that he started to lose the sympathy of the House about halfway through and the barracking resumed. The Lady replied quite brightly and freshly, as if she did not particularly know who he was, or care.\nWhereas earlier in his career, Jenkins had excelled in the traditional set-piece debates in which he spoke from the dispatch box, the focus of parliamentary reporting had now moved to the point-scoring of Prime Minister's Questions, which he struggled with. Seated in the traditional place for third parties in the Commons (the second or third row below the gangway), and without a dispatch box and the gravitas it could have conferred, Jenkins was situated near (and shared the same microphone with) Labour's \"awkward squad\" that included Dennis Skinner and Bob Cryer, who regularly heckled abuse (\"Roy, your flies are undone\").\nSeven days after Jenkins' by-election victory, Argentina invaded the Falklands and the Falklands War transformed British politics, increased substantially the public's support for the Conservatives and ended any chance that Jenkins' election would reinvigorate the SDP's support. In the SDP leadership election, Jenkins was elected with 56.44 per cent of the vote, with David Owen coming second. The SDP's momentum was also seen to have stalled as a result of its poor performance in the 1983 Darlington by-election, shortly before that year's general election, a contest which was seen as one where the party could do well. Despite much campaigning in the Labour-held seat, the SDP candidate finished a poor third.\nDuring the 1983 election campaign, his position as the prime minister-designate for the SDP\u2013Liberal Alliance was questioned by his close colleagues, as his campaign style was now regarded as ineffective; the Liberal leader David Steel was considered to have a greater rapport with the electorate. During the campaign, Steel called Jenkins to a meeting at his home in Ettrickbridge and proposed that Jenkins take a lower profile and that Steel take over as leader of the campaign. According to Steve Richards while Jenkins rejected Steel's view, the meeting meant Jenkins' \"confidence was undermined and he staggered to the finishing line with less verve than he had displayed in the early days of the SDP\" and showed little sign of his earlier \"exuberance\". Jenkins held on to his seat in Hillhead, which was the subject of boundary changes. While on the old boundaries the Conservatives had held the seat prior to Jenkins' victory, it was estimated by the BBC and ITN that on the new boundaries Labour would have captured the seat with a majority of just over 2,000 votes in 1979. Jenkins was challenged by Neil Carmichael, the sitting Labour MP for the Glasgow Kelvingrove constituency which had been abolished and a ministerial colleague of Jenkins in the Wilson governments. Jenkins defeated Carmichael by 1,164 votes to retain his seat in the House of Commons. According to \"The Glasgow Herald\", Labour supporters at the election count in the Kelvin Hall booed and jeered when Jenkins' victory was announced, and he and his wife were \"dismayed as police pushed back jostling crowds\".\nFollowing the general election, Owen succeeded him unopposed. Jenkins was disappointed with Owen's move to the right, and his acceptance and backing of some of Thatcher's policies. At heart, Jenkins remained an unrepentant Keynesian. In his July 1984 Tawney Lecture, Jenkins said that the \"whole spirit and outlook\" of the SDP \"must be profoundly opposed to Thatcherism. It could not go along with the fatalism of the Government's acceptance of massive unemployment\". He also delivered a series of speeches in the Commons attacking the Thatcherite policies of the Chancellor, Nigel Lawson. Jenkins called for more government intervention to support industry and for North Sea oil revenues to be channelled into rebuilding Britain's infrastructure and into educating a skilled workforce. He also attacked the Thatcher government for failing to join the European Exchange Rate Mechanism.\nIn 1985, he wrote to \"The Times\" to advocate the closing down of the political surveillance role of MI5. During the controversy surrounding Peter Wright's \"Spycatcher\", in which he alleged that Harold Wilson had been a Soviet spy, Jenkins rubbished the allegation and reiterated his call for the end of MI5's powers of political surveillance.\nIn 1986, he won \"The Spectator\"'s Parliamentarian of the Year award. He continued to serve as SDP Member of Parliament for Glasgow Hillhead until his defeat at the 1987 general election by the Labour candidate George Galloway, after boundary changes in 1983 had changed the character of the constituency. After his defeat was announced, \"The Glasgow Herald\" reported that he indicated he would not stand for parliament again. In 1986, his biography of Harry S. Truman was published and the following year his biography of Stanley Baldwin was published.\nPeerage, achievements, books and death (1987\u20132003).\nFrom 1987, Jenkins remained in politics as a member of the House of Lords as a life peer with the title Baron Jenkins of Hillhead, of Pontypool in the County of Gwent. Also in 1987, Jenkins was elected Chancellor of the University of Oxford. He was leader of the Liberal Democrats in the Lords from 1988 until 1997.\nIn 1988, he fought and won an amendment to the Education Reform Act 1988, guaranteeing academic freedom of speech in further and higher education establishments. This affords and protects the right of students and academics to \"question and test received wisdom\" and has been incorporated into the statutes or articles and instruments of governance of all universities and colleges in Britain.\nIn 1991, his memoirs, \"A Life at the Centre\", was published by Macmillan, who paid Jenkins a \u00a3130,000 advance. He was magnanimous to most of those colleagues with whom he had clashed in the past, except for David Owen, whom he blamed for destroying the idealism and cohesion of the SDP. In the last chapter ('Establishment Whig or Persistent Radical?') he reaffirmed his radicalism, placing himself \"somewhat to the left of James Callaghan, maybe Denis Healey and certainly of David Owen\". He also proclaimed his political credo:\nMy broad position remains firmly libertarian, sceptical of official cover-ups and uncompromisingly internationalist, believing sovereignty to be an almost total illusion in the modern world, although both expecting and welcoming the continuance of strong differences in national traditions and behaviour. I distrust the deification of the enterprise culture. I think there are more limitations to the wisdom of the market than were dreamt of in Mrs Thatcher's philosophy. I believe that levels of taxation on the prosperous, having been too high for many years (including my own period at the Treasury), are now too low for the provision of decent public services. And I think the privatisation of near monopolies is about as irrelevant as (and sometimes worse than) were the Labour Party's proposals for further nationalisation in the 1970s and early 1980s.\n\"A Life at the Centre\" was generally favourably reviewed: in the \"Times Literary Supplement\" John Grigg said it was a \"marvellous account of high politics by a participant writing with honesty, irony and sustained narrative verve\". In \"The Spectator\" Anthony Quinton remarked that Jenkins was \"not afraid to praise himself and earns the right to do so by unfudged self-criticism\". However, there were critical voices: John Smith in \"The Scotsman\" charged that Jenkins never had any loyalty to the Labour Party and was an ambitious careerist intent only on furthering his career. John Campbell claims that \"A Life at the Centre\" is now generally recognised as one of the best political memoirs. David Cannadine ranked it alongside Duff Cooper's \"Old Men Forget\", R. A. Butler's \"The Art of the Possible\" and Denis Healey's \"The Time of My Life\" as one of the four best political memoirs of the post-war period.\nIn 1993, he was appointed to the Order of Merit. Also that year, his \"Portraits and Miniatures\" was published. The main body of the book is a set of 6 biographical essays (Rab Butler, Aneurin Bevan, Iain Macleod, Dean Acheson, Konrad Adenauer, Charles de Gaulle), along with lectures, articles and book reviews.\nA television documentary about Jenkins was made by Michael Cockerell, titled \"Roy Jenkins: A Very Social Democrat\", and broadcast on 26 May 1996. Although an admiring portrait overall, Cockerell was frank about Jenkins' affairs and both Jenkins and his wife believed that Cockerell had betrayed their hospitality.\nJenkins hailed Tony Blair's election as Labour Party leader in July 1994 as \"the most exciting Labour choice since the election of Hugh Gaitskell\". He argued that Blair should stick \"to a constructive line on Europe, in favour of sensible constitutional innovation...and in favour of friendly relations with the Liberal Democrats\". He added that he hoped Blair would not move Labour further to the right: \"Good work has been done in freeing it from nationalisation and other policies. But the market cannot solve everything and it would be a pity to embrace the stale dogmas of Thatcherism just when their limitations are becoming obvious\".\nJenkins and Blair had been in touch since the latter's time as Shadow Home Secretary, when he admired Jenkins' reforming tenure at the Home Office. Jenkins told Paddy Ashdown in October 1995: \"I think Tony treats me as a sort of father figure in politics. He comes to me a lot for advice, particularly about how to construct a Government\". Jenkins tried to persuade Blair that the division in the centre-left vote between the Labour and Liberal parties had enabled the Conservatives to dominate the 20th century, whereas if the two left-wing parties entered into an electoral pact and adopted proportional representation, they could dominate the 21st century. Jenkins was an influence on the thinking of New Labour and both Peter Mandelson and Roger Liddle in their 1996 work \"The Blair Revolution\" and Philip Gould in his \"Unfinished Revolution\" recognised Jenkins' influence.\nBefore the 1997 election, Blair had promised an enquiry into electoral reform. In December 1997, Jenkins was appointed chair of a Government-appointed Independent Commission on the Voting System, which became known as the \"Jenkins Commission\", to consider alternative voting systems for the UK. The Jenkins Commission reported in favour of a new uniquely British mixed-member proportional system called \"Alternative vote top-up\" or \"limited AMS\" in October 1998, although no action was taken on this recommendation. Blair told Ashdown that Jenkins' recommendations would not pass the Cabinet.\nBritish membership of the European single currency, Jenkins believed, was the supreme test of Blair's statesmanship. However, he was disappointed with Blair's timidity in taking on the Eurosceptic tabloid press. He told Blair in October 1997: \"You have to choose between leading Europe or having Murdoch on your side. You can have one but not both\". Jenkins was also critical of New Labour's authoritarianism, such as the watering down of the Freedom of Information Act 2000 and their intention to ban fox hunting. By the end of his life Jenkins believed that Blair had wasted his enormous parliamentary majority and would not be recorded in history as a great prime minister; he ranked him between Harold Wilson and Stanley Baldwin.\nAfter Gordon Brown attacked Oxford University for indulging in \"old school tie\" prejudices because it rejected a state-educated pupil, Laura Spence, Jenkins told the House of Lords in June 2000 that \"Brown's diatribe was born of prejudice out of ignorance. Nearly every fact he adduced was false\". Jenkins voted for the equalisation of the homosexual age of consent and for repealing Section 28.\nJenkins wrote 19 books, including a biography of Gladstone (1995), which won the 1995 Whitbread Award for Biography, and a much-acclaimed biography of Winston Churchill (2001). His then-designated official biographer, Andrew Adonis, was to have finished the Churchill biography had Jenkins not survived the heart surgery he underwent towards the end of its writing. Historian Paul Johnson called it the best one-volume biography on its subject.\nJenkins underwent heart surgery in the form of a heart valve replacement on 12 October 2000 and postponed his 80th birthday celebrations whilst recovering, by having a celebratory party on 7 March 2001. He died on 5 January 2003, after suffering a heart attack at his home at East Hendred, in Oxfordshire. His last words, to his wife, were, \"Two eggs, please, lightly poached\". At the time of his death, Jenkins was working on a biography of US President Franklin D. Roosevelt.\nAfter his death, Blair paid tribute to \"one of the most remarkable people ever to grace British politics\", who had \"intellect, vision and an integrity that saw him hold firm to his beliefs of moderate social democracy, liberal reform and the cause of Europe throughout his life. He was a friend and support to me\". James Callaghan and Edward Heath also paid tribute and Tony Benn said that as \"a founder of the SDP he was probably the grandfather of New Labour\". However, he was strongly criticised by others including Denis Healey, who condemned the SDP split as a \"disaster\" for the Labour Party which prolonged their time in opposition and allowed the Tories to have an unbroken run of 18 years in government.\nWriting in \"The Guardian\", Professor of Government at Oxford University Vernon Bogdanor provided this assessment of Jenkins:\nRoy Jenkins was both radical and contemporary; and this made him the most influential exponent of the progressive creed in politics in postwar Britain. Moreover, the political creed for which he stood belongs as much to the future as to the past. For Jenkins was the prime mover in the creation of a form of social democracy which, being internationalist, is peculiarly suited to the age of globalisation and, being liberal, will prove to have more staying power than the statism of Lionel Jospin or the corporatist socialism of Gerhard Schr\u00f6der. ... Roy Jenkins was the first leading politician to appreciate that a liberalised social democracy must be based on two tenets: what Peter Mandelson called an aspirational society (individuals must be allowed to regulate their personal lives without interference from the state); and that a post-imperial country like Britain could only be influential in the world as part of a wider grouping (the EU).\nHis alma mater, Cardiff University, honoured the memory of Roy Jenkins by naming one of its halls of residence Roy Jenkins Hall.\nMarriage and personal life.\nOn 20 January 1945, Jenkins married Mary Jennifer (Jennifer) Morris (18 January 1921 \u2013 2 February 2017). They were married for almost 58 years until his death, although he had \"several affairs\", including one with Jackie Kennedy's sister Lee Radziwill. Among his long-term mistresses were Leslie Bonham Carter and Caroline Gilmour, wives of fellow MPs and close friends Mark Bonham Carter and Ian Gilmour. However, these extra-marital relationships were conditional on his lovers having a good relationship with his wife: he later stated that he \"could not imagine loving anyone who was not very fond of Jennifer\".\nShe was made a DBE for services to ancient and historical buildings. They had two sons, Charles and Edward, and a daughter, Cynthia.\nEarly in his life, Jenkins had a relationship with Anthony Crosland. According to the former Liberal Democrat Leader Vince Cable, Jenkins was bisexual.\nIn popular culture.\nJenkins was a main character in Steve Waters' 2017 play \"Limehouse\", which premiered at the Donmar Warehouse; Jenkins was portrayed by Roger Allam.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

During the latter period, a tradition of free election of monarchs made it a uniquely electable position in Europe (16th to 18th centuries).\nThe first Polish ruler whose existence is not debatable was Duke Mieszko I, who adopted Christianity under the authority of Rome in the year 966. He was succeeded by his son, Boles\u0142aw I the Brave, who greatly expanded the boundaries of the Polish state and ruled as the first king in 1025. The following centuries gave rise to the mighty Piast dynasty, consisting of both kings such as Mieszko II Lambert, Przemys\u0142 II or W\u0142adys\u0142aw I the Elbow-high and dukes like Boles\u0142aw III Wrymouth. The dynasty's rule over Poland ceased with the death of Casimir III the Great in 1370. In the same year, the Capetian House of Anjou became the ruling house with Louis I as king of both Poland and Hungary. His daughter, Jadwiga, later married Jogaila, the pagan Grand Duke of Lithuania, who in 1386 was baptized and crowned as W\u0142adys\u0142aw II Jagie\u0142\u0142o, thus creating the Jagiellonian dynasty and a personal union between Poland and Lithuania.\nDuring the reign of Casimir IV Jagiellon and Sigismund I the Old, culture flourished and cities developed. This era of progress, also known as the Polish Renaissance, continued until the Union of Lublin under Sigismund II Augustus, which unofficially marked the end of the Polish Golden Age. After the death of the last Jagiellonian king, the united Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth became an elective monarchy with mostly foreigners elected as monarchs such as Henry III of France, who witnessed the introduction of the Golden Liberty system and Stephen B\u00e1thory, a capable military commander who strengthened the nation. The meaningful rule of the Vasa dynasty initially expanded the Commonwealth as the arts and crafts developed, as well as trade and commerce. King Sigismund III Vasa, a talented but somewhat despotic ruler, involved the country in many wars, which subsequently resulted in the successful capture of Moscow and the loss of Livonia to Sweden. His son, W\u0142adys\u0142aw IV Vasa, fiercely defended the Commonwealth's borders and continued the policy of his father until his death, unlike John II Casimir whose tragic rule resulted in his abdication.\nThe election of John III Sobieski to the Polish throne proved to be beneficial for the Commonwealth. A brilliant military tactician, John III led the coalition forces to victory at Vienna in 1683 and he partially recaptured land from the Ottoman Empire. However, the years that followed were not as successful. The long and ineffective rule of the Wettin dynasty (Augustus II the Strong and Augustus III) placed the Commonwealth under the influence of Saxony and the Russian Empire. Additional feuds with rebel nobility (szlachta) and most notably Stanislaus I Leszczy\u0144ski and France diminished the influence of Poland\u2013Lithuania in the region, which led to the partitions that occurred under King Stanislaus II Augustus, yet another enlightened, but ineffective monarch. The last true sovereign of Poland was Frederick Augustus I as Duke of Warsaw, who throughout his political career attempted to rehabilitate the Polish state. \nFollowing the Napoleonic Wars, many sovereigns claimed the title of Polish king, duke or ruler, notably German (the King of Prussia was also the sovereign of the Grand Duchy of Posen 1815-1918), Russian (the Congress Kingdom of Poland was founded in 1815 with the widely unrecognized title of King of Poland to the Emperor of Russia until 1915) and Austrian emperors (the Emperor of Austria was sovereign of the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria between 1772 and 1918, and the Grand Duchy of Krak\u00f3w between 1846 and 1918). The new Kingdom of Poland was proclaimed as an independent state in 1916 with a Regency Council but the monarchy was abolished and a parliamentary republican authority was established when Poland was re-constituted as a sovereign state in 1918.\nLegendary.\nMost of the legendary Polish rulers appear for the first time in chronicles from the 13th century and their existence has not been determined.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"template:sticky header/styles.css\"/&gt;\nDebatable rulers.\nThe three direct predecessors of Mieszko I are known only from the account of Gallus Anonymus, who wrote the oldest Polish chronicle, at the beginning of the 12th century. Though their historicity was once debatable, now historians tend to consider them actually existing rulers.\nHouse of Piast.\nMieszko I started his reign as leader of Polans tribe, while other parts of future Poland were settled by other tribes, such as Masovians, Vistulans, Lendians, Silesians or Pomeranians. During his reign Mieszko united polish lands and adopted Christianity connecting Poland with western Europe. His descendents ruled the state as natural lords and Poland was seen as their hereditary property. Because of that, the state was often divided between sons of deceased ruler and eventually united by one of them. Early polish rulers were not considered equal to western European kings, so their title is translated as a duke. Some of them managed to prepare a coronation and adopted title of king, but effects of those efforts were short lived.&lt;templatestyles src=\"template:sticky header/styles.css\"/&gt;\nFragmentation of Poland (1138\u20131320).\nAfter period of fights between brothers and unstable inheritance Boles\u0142aw III Wrymouth decided to formalize succession. According to his testament the state was divided into provinces - one for every son and Senioral Province with capital city \u2013 Krak\u00f3w. The testament established two principles on which new order in Poland was based - principate and seniorate. According to principate one duke - princeps (also called in English high duke) had supreme authority over other dukes and ruled in senioral province. According to seniorate princeps should be the oldest member of the dynasty, not necessarily son of the predecessor. During time of feudal fragmentation, as this period is called, both principles were abolished. Seniorate was formally abolished in 1180 during assembly of dukes and bishops in \u0141\u0119czyca, where Casimir II the Just was made hereditary high duke. Principate was de facto abolished in 1227 with assassination of Leszek the White, after which local dukes no longer respected suzereinity of high duke, whose title became only prestigious.\nAttempt at restoration (1295\u20131296).\nIn XIII c. the idea of reunification of Poland under single ruler started to gain popularity. It was often connected with coronation and establishment of hereditary kingdom. First attempts were made by Henry II the Pious and Henry Probus but both of them died before they manage to achieve their goals. First duke, who became king in this period was Przemys\u0142 II. He ruled briefly as high duke but didn't manage to unite polish lands. He crowned himself when ruling in his hereditary province - Greater Poland and in province of Eastern Pomerania. His assassination in 1296 prolonged unification of Poland by 20 years.\nP\u0159emyslid House.\nHouse of P\u0159emyslid were natural lords of Bohemia and had many family connections with Piast dynasty. In 1291], Wenceslaus II of Bohemia exploited the weakness of internally divided Poland and conquered Krak\u00f3w, basing his claim on loose family connection with one of the previous high dukes. He later legitimize his rule by marrying daughter of Przemys\u0142 II, which also gave him claims to Polish Kingdom. \nHouse of Piast (restored).\nNear the end of the reign of Wenceslaus II his rule over Poland was undermined by remaining polish dukes - especially by Ladislaus the Short, who was exiled by Wenceslauss and had strong claim to inheritance of Przemys\u0142 II, and by Henry III of G\u0142og\u00f3w, who also was successor of Przemys\u0142. Assassination of Wenceslaus III of Bohemia, which led to extinction of P\u0159emyslid dynasty and succession crisis in Bohemia, left Poland for Wenceslaus opponents. His successors in Bohemia called themselves kings of Poland until Congress of Visegr\u00e1d in 1335. Eventually Ladislaus the Short managed to unite two main provinces of Poland - Greater Poland and Lesser Poland and crowned himself king in 1320 ending the period of feudal fragmentation.\nHouse of Anjou.\nCasimir III the Great died without male heir. According to previous agreements his successor became his nephew, king of Hungary Louis I, beginning Polish-Hungarian personal union. After Louis death his kingdoms were separated - his younger daughter, Hedwig became king of Poland after brief interregnum (she is called king because in Poland title \"queen\" is reserved only for kings wife, not for sole ruler) and older daughter, Mary became queen of Hungary. \nHouse of Jagiellon.\nFemale king Hedwig started her reign young and unmarried, which gave Poland a huge opportunity. She eventually married the pagan Grand Duke of Lithuania Jogaila, who adopted the name W\u0142adys\u0142aw after baptism. This event led to the creation of the Polish-Lithuanian personal union. After Hedwigs death, W\u0142adys\u0142aw remained king of Poland, but he and his successors were no longer considered natural lords of Poland and often had to give privileges to nobility in exchange for support of succession of their children.\nPolish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth, 1569\u20131795.\nIn 1569, king Sigismund II Augustus, knowing that he had no heir, united Poland and Lithuania into single entity - the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, to ensure that after his death both nations will remain under the same monarch. He also declared that after his death, the nobility would elect his successor, beginning the elective monarchy not constricted to members of one dynasty, like during Jagiellons. He also ensured, that all nobles would decide the next king, not only the richest and most powerful ones. The first post-Jagiellonic elective king, Henry of Valois, signed the Henrician Articles, which guaranteed free elections and the rule of the nobility over the state. He, and every ruler after him, had to sign a 'pacta conventa' - a document of policies that the king promised to implement. After death of every king, an interregnum would be announced and the primate of Poland became an interrex; a temporary head of state, until a new king was elected.\nDuchy of Warsaw, 1807\u20131815.\nAfter long period of instability and anarchy, the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth was divided among its neighbours - Russia, Prussia and Austria. During the Napoleonic Wars, Napoleon created the Duchy of Warsaw from the lands of the Prussian partition. Some parts of Austrian partition were later added to the Duchy. The Duchy had its own duke and government, but was fully dependent on France. After the fall of Napoleon, the duchy was divided between Russia and Prussia.\nPoland from 1815 to 1918.\nAfter fall of the Duchy of Warsaw, the Polish lands were reorganised. Prussia annexed Greater Poland and created the Grand Duchy of Posen, Krak\u00f3w became a free city and the rest of the former Duchy of Warsaw became part of the Russian Empire, as Congress Poland. In 1846, Krak\u00f3w was annexed by Austria and in 1848, the Grand Duchy of Posen was dissolved. In 1867, after the failed January Uprising, the remaining autonomy of Congress Poland was abolished. During World War I, in German occupied Congress Poland, the Regency Kingdom was formed and lasted from 1917 to 1918. After Poland regained independence in 1918, a republican system with the president as head of state was established.\nSee the list of rulers of partitioned Poland.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Lee also served a one-year term as the president of the Continental Congress, proposed and was a signatory to the Continental Association, signed the Articles of Confederation, and was a United States Senator from Virginia from 1789 to 1792, serving part of that time as the second president \"pro tempore\" of the upper house. He was a member of the Lee family, a historically influential family in Virginia politics.\nEarly life and education.\nLee was born in Westmoreland County, Virginia, to Colonel Thomas Lee and Hannah Harrison Ludwell Lee on January 20, 1732. He came from a line of military officers, diplomats, and legislators. His father served on the Governor's council and briefly as an interim governor of Virginia before his death in 1750. Lee spent most of his early life in Stratford, Virginia, at Stratford Hall. Here he was tutored and taught a variety of skills. To develop his political career, his father sent him around to neighboring planters with the intention for Lee to become associated with neighboring men of like prominence. In 1748, at 16, Lee left Virginia for Yorkshire, England, to complete his formal education at Queen Elizabeth Grammar School, Wakefield. Both of his parents died in 1750. In 1753, after touring Europe, he returned to Virginia to help his brothers settle the estate his parents had left behind.\nCareer.\nIn 1757, Lee was appointed justice of the peace of Westmoreland County. In 1758, he was elected to the Virginia House of Burgesses, where he met Patrick Henry. Lee remained a \"valuable ally of ... Henry and Samuel Adams\" throughout the American Revolutionary War. An early advocate of independence, Lee became one of the first to create a Committees of Correspondence among the many independence-minded Americans in the various colonies. In 1766, almost ten years before the American Revolutionary War, Lee is credited with having authored the Westmoreland Resolution against enforcement of the British Stamp Act 1765, which was publicly signed by prominent landowners who met at Leedstown, Virginia, on February 27, 1766. Among the signers were three brothers and one close cousin of George Washington.\nAmerican Revolution.\nIn August 1774, Lee was chosen as a delegate to the First Continental Congress in Philadelphia. In Lee's Resolution on June 7, 1776, during the Second Continental Congress, Lee put forth the motion to the Continental Congress to declare Independence from Great Britain, which read (in part):\nResolved: That these united colonies are, and of right ought to be, free and independent States, that they are absolved from all allegiance to the British crown, and that all political connection between them and the state of great Britain is, and ought to be, totally dissolved.\nLee had returned to Virginia by the time Congress voted on and adopted the Declaration of Independence, but he signed the document when he returned to Congress.\nPresident of Congress.\nLee was elected the sixth president of Congress under the Articles of Confederation on November 30, 1784, in the French Arms Tavern, Trenton, New Jersey. Congress convened on January 11, 1785, in the old New York City Hall, with Lee presiding until November 23, 1785. Although he was not paid a salary, his household expenses were covered in the amount of $12,203.13.\nLee abhorred the notion of imposing federal taxes and believed that continuing to borrow foreign money was imprudent. Throughout his term, he maintained that the states should relinquish their claims in the Northwest Territory, enabling the federal government to fund its obligations through land sales. He wrote to friend and colleague Samuel Adams:\nI hope we shall shortly finish our plan for disposing of the western Lands to discharge the oppressive public debt created by the war &amp; I think that if this source of revenue be rightly managed, that these republics may soon be discharged from that state of oppression and distress that an indebted people must invariably feel.\nDebate began on the expansion of the Land Ordinance of 1784 and Thomas Jefferson's survey method; namely, \"hundreds of ten geographical miles square, each mile containing 6086 and 4-10ths of a foot\" and \"sub-divided into lots of one mile square each, or 850 and 4-10ths of an acre\" on April 14. On May 3, 1785, William Grayson of Virginia made a motion, seconded by James Monroe, to change \"seven miles square\" to \"six miles square.\"\nThe Land Ordinance of 1785 passed on May 20, 1785, yet the federal government lacked the resources to manage the newly surveyed lands. Not only did Native Americans refuse to relinquish their hold on the platted territory, but much of the remaining land was occupied by squatters. With Congress unable to muster magistrates or troops to enforce the dollar-per-acre title fee, Lee's plan ultimately failed, although the survey system developed under the Land Ordinance of 1785 has endured.\nUS Senate.\nLee served in the United States Senate in the First and Second Congresses from 1789 to 1792. In 1792 he became the second president \"pro tempore\", but later that year he was obliged to resign due to his failing health, and he retired from public life.\nPersonal life and family.\nLee's mother Hannah Harrison Ludwell died in 1750. On December 5, 1757, he married Anne Aylett, daughter of William Aylett. Anne died on December 12, 1768. The couple had six children, four of whom survived infancy, including Thomas Jesse Lee and Ludwell Lee. Lee remarried in June or July 1769 to Anne (Gaskins) Pinckard. The couple had seven children, five of whom survived infancy.\nLee honored his brother, Francis Lightfoot Lee (another signer of the Articles of Confederation and the Declaration of Independence), by naming one of his sons after him.\nDeath and legacy.\nLee died on June 19, 1794, at the age of 62. Schools in Rossmoor, California, and Glen Burnie, Maryland, are named after him, and Richard Henry Lee School in Chicago is named in his honor. The World War II Liberty Ship was named in his honor. The Chantilly Archaeological Site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971. He is portrayed in Sherman Edwards' 1969 musical \"1776\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

'Land of Kings') is a state in northwestern India. It is the largest Indian state by area and the seventh largest by population. It covers or 10.4 per cent of India's total geographical area. It is on India's northwestern side, where it comprises most of the wide and inhospitable Thar Desert (also known as the Great Indian Desert) and shares a border with the Pakistani provinces of Punjab to the northwest and Sindh to the west, along the Sutlej-Indus River valley. It is bordered by five other Indian states: Punjab to the north; Haryana and Uttar Pradesh to the northeast; Madhya Pradesh to the southeast; and Gujarat to the southwest. Its geographical location is 23\u00b03' to 30\u00b012' North latitude and 69\u00b030' to 78\u00b017' East longitude, with the Tropic of Cancer passing through its southernmost tip.\nIts major features include the ruins of the Indus Valley civilisation at Kalibangan and Balathal, the Dilwara Temples, a Jain pilgrimage site at Rajasthan's only hill station, Mount Abu, in the ancient Aravalli mountain range and eastern Rajasthan, the Keoladeo National Park of Bharatpur, a World Heritage Site known for its bird life. Rajasthan is also home to five national tiger reserves, the Ranthambore National Park in Sawai Madhopur, Sariska Tiger Reserve in Alwar, the Mukundra Hills Tiger Reserve in Kota, Ramgarh Vishdhari Tiger reserve and Karauli Dholpur tiger reserve.\nThe State of Rajasthan was formed on 30 March 1949 when the states of the Rajputana Agency of the erstwhile British Empire in India were merged into the new Indian Union. Its capital and largest city is Jaipur. Other important cities are Jodhpur, Kota, Bikaner, Ajmer, Bhilwara, Sawai Madhopur, Bharatpur and Udaipur. The economy of Rajasthan is the seventh-largest state economy in India with () in gross domestic product and a per capita GDP of (). Rajasthan ranks 22nd among Indian states in human development index.\nEtymology.\nRajasthan means \"Land of Kings\" and is a portmanteau of Sanskrit \"R\u0101j\u0101\" ('King') and Sanskrit \"Sth\u0101na\" ('Land') or Persian \"St(h)\u0101n\", with the same meaning.\"\" The first printed mention of the name \"Rajasthan\" appears in the 1829 publication \"Annals and Antiquities of Rajasthan or the Central and Western Rajpoot States of India\", while the earliest known record of \"Rajputana\" as a name for the region is in George Thomas's 1800 memoir \"Military Memories\". John Keay, in his book \"India: A History\", stated that \"Rajputana\" was coined by the British in 1829, John Briggs, translating Ferishta's history of early Islamic India, used the phrase \"Rajpoot (Rajput) princes\" rather than \"Indian princes\".\nHistory.\nAncient times.\nParts of what is now Rajasthan were partly part of the Vedic Civilisation and the Indus Valley civilisation. Kalibangan, in Hanumangarh district, was a major provincial capital of the Indus Valley Civilisation. Topsfield writes that the Rajputs first entered India from the north west in the first millennium A.D. They established kingdoms in western India in the region that is now known as Rajasthan.\nAn archaeological excavation at the Balathal site in Udaipur district shows a settlement contemporary with the Harrapan civilisation dating back to 3000\u20131500 BCE. Stone Age tools dating from 5,000 to 200,000 years were found in Bundi and Bhilwara districts of the state.\nThe Matsya kingdom of the Vedic civilisation of India is said to roughly corresponded to the former state of Jaipur in Rajasthan and included the whole of Alwar with portions of Bharatpur. The capital of Matsya was at Viratanagar (modern Bairat), which is said to have been named after its founder King Virata.\nBhargava identifies the two districts of Jhunjhunu and Sikar and parts of Jaipur district along with Haryana districts of Mahendragarh and Rewari as part of Vedic state of Brahmavarta. Bhargava also locates the present day Sahibi River as the Vedic Drishadwati River, which along with Saraswati River formed the borders of the Vedic state of Brahmavarta. Manu and Bhrigu narrated the Manusmriti to a congregation of seers in this area. The ashrams of Vedic seers Bhrigu and his son Chayvan Rishi, for whom Chyawanprash was formulated, were near Dhosi Hill, part of which lies in Dhosi village of Jhunjhunu district of Rajasthan and part of which lies in Mahendragarh district of Haryana.\nThe Western Kshatrapas (405\u201335 BCE), the Saka rulers of the western part of India, were successors to the Indo-Scythians and were contemporaneous with the Kushans, who ruled the northern part of the Indian subcontinent. The Indo-Scythians invaded the area of Ujjain and established the Saka era (with their calendar), marking the beginning of the long-lived Saka Western Satraps state.\nThe Allahabad Pillar Inscription (also known as the Prayaga Pillar Inscription) of Samudragupta, AD 360, records that the Abhiras were a powerful tribe who ruled over the whole of Rajasthan.\nClassical era.\nGurjara-Pratihara.\nThe Pratiharas ruled for many dynasties in this part of the country; the region was known as \"Gurjaratra\". Up to the 10th century, almost all of North India acknowledged the supremacy of the Imperial Pratiharas, with their seat of power at Kannauj.\nThe Gurjara Pratihar Empire acted as a barrier for Arab invaders from the 8th to the 11th century. The chief accomplishment of the Gurjara-Pratihara Empire lies in its successful resistance to foreign invasions from the west, starting in the days of Junaid. Historian R. C. Majumdar says that this was openly acknowledged by the Arab writers. He further notes that historians of India have wondered at the slow progress of Muslim invaders in India, as compared with their rapid advance in other parts of the world. Now there seems little doubt that it was the power of the Pratihara army that effectively barred the progress of the Arabs beyond the confines of Sindh, their only conquest for nearly 300 years.\nMedieval and early modern eras.\nThe Ghurids had made an attempt to invade India through southern Rajasthan, however they were defeated in the Battle of Kasahrada on 1178 by a confederacy of Rajputs under Mularaja II of the Kingdom of Gujarat. Prithviraj Chauhan led a confederacy of Rajput clans and defeated the invading Ghruids under Muhammad Ghori in the First Battle of Tarain in 1191. In 1192, Muhammad Ghori decisively defeated Prithviraj at the Second Battle of Tarain. After the defeat of Chauhan in the same year, a part of Rajasthan came under Muslim rulers. The principal centres of their powers were Nagaur and Ajmer. Ranthambhore was also under their suzerainty. At the beginning of the 13th century, the most prominent and powerful state of Rajasthan was Mewar. Since the invasion of the Muslim Turks from the 13th century onwards, the Rajputs resisted the Muslim incursions into India, and preserved Hindu culture at their courts.\nThe Rajputs put up resistance to the Islamic invasions with their warfare and chivalry for centuries. The Ranas of Mewar led other kingdoms in their resistance to outside rule. Rana Hammir Singh defeated the Tughlaq dynasty and recovered a large portion of Rajasthan. The indomitable Rana Kumbha defeated the Sultans of Malwa, Nagaur and Gujarat and made Mewar the most powerful Rajput Kingdom in India. The ambitious Rana Sanga united the various Rajput clans, including the Muslim Khanzadas of Mewat under Raja Hasan Khan Mewati, and fought against the foreign powers in India. Rana Sanga defeated the Afghan Lodi Empire of Delhi and crushed the Turkic Sultanates of Malwa and Gujarat. Rana Sanga then tried to create an Indian empire but was defeated by the first Mughal Emperor Babur at Khanwa. The defeat was due to betrayal by the Tomar King Silhadi of Raisen. After Rana Sanga's death, Marwar rose as a power centre in Rajasthan under Rao Maldeo Rathore. He conquered Jaisalmer, parts of Gujarat, Jalore, Nagaur, Ajmer, Sanchore, Bhinmal, Radhanpur, Bayana, Tonk, Toda and Nabhara. He expanded the territories of Marwar up to Sindh-Cholistan in west and his northern boundary was just fifty kilometres from Delhi. After defeating Humayun, Sher Shah came towards Rajputana. He defeated Chiefs of Rathore army by trickery in Battle of Sammel and captured some territory of Marwar but it was recovered by Rathores in 1545.\nHem Chandra Vikramaditya, the Hindu emperor, was born in the village of Machheri in Alwar District in 1501. He won 22 battles against Afghans, from Punjab to Bengal including the states of Ajmer and Alwar in Rajasthan, and defeated Akbar's forces twice, first at Agra and then at Delhi in 1556 at Battle of Delhi before acceding to the throne of Delhi and establishing the \"Hindu Raj\" in North India, albeit for a short duration, from Purana Qila in Delhi. Hem Chandra was killed in the battlefield at Second Battle of Panipat fighting against Mughals on 5 November 1556.\nDuring Akbar's reign most of the Rajput kings accepted Mughal suzerainty, but the rulers of Mewar (Rana Udai Singh II) and Marwar (Rao Chandrasen Rathore) refused to have any form of alliance with the Mughals. To teach the Rajputs a lesson Akbar attacked Udai Singh and killed Rajput commander Jaimal of Chitor and the citizens of Mewar in large numbers. Akbar killed 20,000\u201325,000 unarmed citizens in Chittor on the grounds that they had actively helped in the resistance.\nMaharana Pratap took an oath to avenge the citizens of Chittor; he fought the Mughal empire till his death and liberated most of Mewar apart from Chittor itself. Maharana Pratap soon became the most celebrated warrior of Rajasthan and became famous all over India for his sporadic warfare and noble actions. According to Satish Chandra, \"Rana Pratap's defiance of the mighty Mughal empire, almost alone and unaided by the other Rajput states, constitutes a glorious saga of Rajput valor and the spirit of self-sacrifice for cherished principles. Rana Pratap's methods of sporadic warfare were later elaborated further by Malik Ambar, the Deccani general, and by Shivaji\".\nRana Amar Singh I continued his ancestor's war against the Mughals under Jehangir, he repelled the Mughal armies at Dewar. Later an expedition was again sent under the leadership of Prince Khurram, which caused much damage to life and property of Mewar. Many temples were destroyed, several villages were put on fire and women and children were captured and tortured to make Amar Singh accept surrender.\nDuring Aurangzeb's rule Rana Raj Singh I, Veer Durgadas Rathore and Patshah Akheraj Singh Rajpurohit were chief among those who defied the intolerant emperor of Delhi. They took advantage of the Aravalli hills and caused heavy damage to the Mughal armies that were trying to occupy Rajasthan.\nAfter Aurangzeb's death Bahadur Shah I tried to subjugate Rajasthan like his ancestors but his plan backfired when the three Rajput Rajas of Amber, Udaipur, and Jodhpur made a joint resistance to the Mughals. The Rajputs first expelled the commandants of Jodhpur and Bayana and recovered Amer by a night attack. They next killed Sayyid Hussain Khan Barha, the commandant of Mewat and many other Mughal officers. Bahadur Shah I, then in the Deccan was forced to patch up a truce with the Rajput Rajas. The Jats, under Suraj Mal, overran the Mughal garrison at Agra and plundered the city taking with them the two great silver doors of the entrance of the famous Taj Mahal which were then melted down by Suraj Mal in 1763.\nOver the years, the Mughals began to have internal disputes which greatly distracted them at times. The Mughal Empire continued to weaken, and with the decline of the Mughal Empire in the late 18th century, Rajputana came under the influence of the Marathas. The Maratha Empire, which had replaced the Mughal Empire as the overlord of the subcontinent, was finally replaced by the British Empire in 1818.\nIn the 19th century, the Rajput kingdoms were exhausted financially and in manpower after continuous wars and due to heavy tributes exacted by the Maratha Empire. To save their kingdoms from instability, rebellions and banditry the Rajput kings concluded treaties with the British in the early 19th century, accepting British suzerainty and control over their external affairs in return for internal autonomy.\nModern era.\nThe State of Rajasthan was formed on 30 March 1949 when the states of the Rajputana Agency of the erstwhile British Empire in India were merged into the new Indian Union. Modern Rajasthan includes most of Rajputana, which comprises the erstwhile nineteen princely states, three chiefships, and the British district of Ajmer-Merwara. Jaisalmer, Marwar (Jodhpur), Bikaner, Mewar (Chittorgarh), Alwar and Dhundhar (Jaipur) were some of the main Rajput princely states. Bharatpur and Dholpur were Jat princely states whereas Tonk was a princely state under Pathans. The three chiefships were Lawa, Neemrana and Kushalgarh.\nGeography.\nThe geographic features of Rajasthan are the Thar Desert and the Aravalli Range, which runs through the state from southwest to northeast, almost from one end to the other, for more than . Mount Abu lies at the southwestern end of the range, separated from the main ranges by the West Banas River. Although a series of broken ridges continues into Haryana in the direction of Delhi where it can be seen as outcrops in the form of the Raisina Hill and the ridges farther north. About three-fifths of Rajasthan lies northwest of the Aravallis, leaving two-fifths on the east and south direction.\nThe Aravalli Range runs across the state from the southwest peak Guru Shikhar (Mount Abu), which is in height, to Khetri in the northeast. This range divides the state into 60% in the northwest of the range and 40% in the southeast. The northwest tract is sandy and unproductive with little water but improves gradually from desert land in the far west and northwest to comparatively fertile and habitable land towards the east. The south-eastern area, higher in elevation (100 to 350\u00a0m above sea level) and more fertile, has a very diversified topography. In the south lies the hilly tract of Mewar. In the southeast, a large area within the districts of Kota and Bundi forms a tableland. To the northeast of these districts is a rugged region (badlands) following the line of the Chambal River. Farther north the country levels out; the flat plains of the northeastern Bharatpur district are part of an alluvial basin. Merta City lies in the geographical centre of Rajasthan.\nThe Aravalli Range and the lands to the east and southeast of the range are generally more fertile and better watered. This region is home to the Khathiar-Gir dry deciduous forests ecoregion, with tropical dry broadleaf forests that include teak, \"Acacia\", and other trees. The hilly Vagad region, home to the cities of Dungarpur, Pratapgarh, and Banswara lies in southernmost Rajasthan, on the border with Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh. With the exception of Mount Abu, Vagad is the wettest region in Rajasthan, and the most heavily forested. North of Vagad lies the Mewar region, home to the cities of Udaipur and Chittaurgarh. The Hadoti region lies to the southeast, on the border with Madhya Pradesh. North of Hadoti and Mewar lies the Dhundhar region, home to the state capital of Jaipur. Mewat, the easternmost region of Rajasthan, borders Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. Eastern and southeastern Rajasthan is drained by the Banas and Chambal rivers, tributaries of the Ganges.\nThe northwestern portion of Rajasthan is generally sandy and dry. Most of this region is covered by the Thar Desert which extends into adjoining portions of Pakistan. The Aravalli Range does not intercept the moisture-giving southwest monsoon winds off the Arabian Sea, as it lies in a direction parallel to that of the coming monsoon winds, leaving the northwestern region in a rain shadow. The Thar Desert is thinly populated; the City of Jodhpur is the largest city in the desert and a major metropolitan area of India which is known as the gateway of the Thar desert. The desert has some major districts like Jodhpur, Jaisalmer, Barmer, Bikaner, and Nagaur. This area is also important from a defence point of view. Jodhpur airbase is one of the largest airbases in India, BSF and Military bases are also situated here. Currently four civil airports are located here: Jodhpur, Jaisalmer, Bikaner and Nagaur, of which Jodhpur is the major civil airport, being the 44th busiest airport in India and one of the oldest air strips of India, being built in the 1920s.\nThe Northwestern thorn scrub forests lie in a band around the Thar Desert, between the desert and the Aravallis. This region receives less than 400\u00a0 mm of rain annually. Temperatures can sometimes exceed 45\u00a0\u00b0C in the summer months and drop below freezing point in the winter. The Godwar, Marwar, and Shekhawati regions lie in the thorn scrub forest zone, along with the city of Jodhpur. The Luni River and its tributaries are the major river system of Godwar and Marwar regions, draining the western slopes of the Aravallis and emptying southwest into the great Rann of Kutch wetland in neighbouring Gujarat. This river is saline in the lower reaches and remains potable only up to Balotara in Barmer district. The Ghaggar River, which originates in Haryana, is an intermittent stream that disappears into the sands of the Thar Desert in the northern corner of the state and is seen as a remnant of the primitive Sarasvati river.\nFlora and fauna.\nThe Desert National Park in Jaisalmer, spread over an area of , is an excellent example of the ecosystem of the Thar Desert and its diverse fauna. Seashells and massive fossilised tree trunks in this park record the geological history of the desert. The region is a haven for migratory and resident birds of the desert. One can see many eagles, harriers, falcons, buzzards, kestrels and vultures. Short-toed snake eagles (\"Circaetus gallicus\"), tawny eagles (\"Aquila rapax\"), spotted eagles (\"Aquila clanga\"), laggar falcons (\"Falco jugger\") and kestrels are some of the raptor species seen in Desert National Park. Road traffic inside the Park is, however, a threat to several wild species of the park with several species of amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals reported to have died as roadkill.\nThe Ranthambore National Park located in Sawai Madhopur, one of the well known tiger reserves in the country, became a part of Project Tiger in 1973.\nTal Chhapar Sanctuary is a very small sanctuary in Sujangarh, Churu District, from Jaipur in the Shekhawati region. This sanctuary is home to a large population of blackbuck.

He is best known for having been first Eastern Orthodox bishop of America, for his staunch critiques of ethnophyletism, exclusivism and Greek nepotism in the Eastern Orthodox Church, as well as being precursor to the Arab Orthodox Movement and being among the first to integrate the Eastern Orthodox Church into multimedia with the first-ever published Eastern Orthodox magazine.\nLife.\nHe was born in modern-day Lebanon to Damascene Syrian Arab (Antiochian Greek Christian) parents of the Orthodox faith who had come to Beirut fleeing the 1860 Syrian Civil War in Damascus. He was first educated at the Damascus Patriarchal School that had become the leading Greek Orthodox institution of higher learning in the Levant under the leadership of Joseph of Damascus. He furthered his study of Christian theology at the Patriarchal Halki seminary in Constantinople, and at the Theological Academy in Kiev, Russian Empire (now Kyiv, Ukraine).\nAfter having been expelled from the Greek Orthodox Church when it was discovered that he had written polemics under a pseudonym against the ethnic exclusivism of the Greek clergy in the church of his day, he was welcomed by the Russian Orthodox Church, where he served as a professor at the Kazan Theological Academy, and was commissioned to write anti-Islamic apologetics.\nAfterwards, Father Raphael was sent to New York City in 1895 by Tsar Nicholas II of Russia to administer the local Orthodox Christian community which then included mainly Russian, Greek, Romanian and Arab immigrants, responding specifically to a request by local Arabic-speaking Orthodox Christians for a priest who could minister to them in their own language.\nFrom 1903 onwards, after having been elected the \"Syria-Arabian Vicariot of America\", he began his notoriously ambitious missionary journey, wherein he adopted a semi-nomadic lifestyle, in which he was known to have travelled by foot, by horse, by donkey and by train among freighthopping tramps and hobos, even having gone so far as to extend his mission to Cuba and the Caribbean towards the end; during his travels, he organized his journey around letters he received from scattered Orthodox Christians in America, and would use them as a guideline for his travels, coming in-and-out of cities to perform spontaneous baptisms, marriages and blessings.\nIn 1904, he became the first Orthodox bishop to be consecrated in North America; the consecration was performed in New York City by Archbishop Tikhon (Bellavin) and Bishop Innocent (Pustynsky). He served as Bishop of Brooklyn until his death. During the course of his ministry as an auxiliary bishop of the Russian Orthodox Church in America, Raphael founded the present-day St. Nicholas Antiochian Orthodox Cathedral (Brooklyn), established thirty parishes, built over 30 Churches and assisted in the founding of St. Tikhon's Orthodox Monastery.\nBishop Raphael founded the official magazine of the Antiochian Orthodox Archdiocese, \"The Word\", in 1905 in Arabic (\u0627\u0644\u0643\u0644\u0645\u0629), and wrote many works of his own, most of which remain both untranslated and unpublished.\nGlorification and honors.\nBishop Raphael was originally buried in New York until August 1988, when his relics were translated to the Antiochian Village Camp in Ligonier, Pennsylvania, on property of the Antiochian Archdiocese, along with several other bishops and clergy.\nRaphael was glorified by the Holy Synod of the Orthodox Church in America (OCA) in its March 2000 session. He is commemorated by the OCA on February 27, the anniversary of his death and by the Antiochian Orthodox Church on the first Saturday of November near the Synaxis of the Archangels Michael, Gabriel, Raphael and all the bodiless powers of heaven. His feast days are both a vigil-rank commemeration.\nIn 2015, the Antiochian Archdiocese, OCA and ROCOR celebrated the 100th Anniversary of the dormition of St. Raphael.\nHe is commemorated on 14 February and on 27 October - Synaxis of All Saints of Kiev Theological Academy and Kiev Theological Seminary in Ukrainian Orthodox Church.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It resulted in the formation of the Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic and later the Soviet Union in most of its territory. Its finale marked the end of the Russian Revolution, which was one of the key events of the 20th century.\nThe Russian monarchy ended with the abdication of Tsar Nicholas II during the February Revolution, and Russia was in a state of political flux. A tense summer culminated in the October Revolution, where the Bolsheviks overthrew the provisional government of the new Russian Republic. Bolshevik seizure of power was not universally accepted, and the country descended into a conflict which became a full-scale civil war in May\u2013June 1918. The two largest combatants were the Red Army, fighting for the establishment of a Bolshevik-led socialist state headed by Vladimir Lenin, and the forces known as the White movement (and its White Army), led mainly by the right-leaning officers of the Russian Empire, united around the figure of Alexander Kolchak. In addition, rival militant socialists, notably the Ukrainian anarchists of the Makhnovshchina and Left Socialist-Revolutionaries, were involved in conflict against the Bolsheviks. They, as well as non-ideological green armies, opposed the Bolsheviks, the Whites and the foreign interventionists. Thirteen foreign states intervened against the Red Army, notably the Allied intervention, whose primary goal was re-establishing the Eastern Front of World War I. Three foreign states of the Central Powers also intervened, rivaling the Allied intervention with the main goal of retaining the territory they had received in the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk with Soviet Russia.\nThe Bolsheviks initially consolidated control over most of the former empire. The Treaty of Brest-Litovsk was an emergency peace with the German Empire, who had captured vast swathes of the Russian territory during the chaos of the revolution. In May 1918, the Czechoslovak Legion in Russia revolted in Siberia. In reaction, the Allies began their North Russian and Siberian interventions. That, combined with the creation of the Provisional All-Russian Government, saw the reduction of Bolshevik-controlled territory to most of European Russia and parts of Central Asia. In 1919, the White Army launched several offensives from the east in March, the south in July, and west in October. The advances were later checked by the Eastern Front counteroffensive, the Southern Front counteroffensive, and the defeat of the Northwestern Army.\nBy 1919, the White armies were in retreat and by the start of 1920 were defeated on all three fronts. Although the Bolsheviks were victorious, the territorial extent of the Russian state had been reduced, for many non-Russian ethnic groups had used the disarray to push for national independence. In March 1921, during a related war against Poland, the Peace of Riga was signed, splitting disputed territories in Belarus and Ukraine between the Republic of Poland on one side and Soviet Russia and Soviet Ukraine on the other. Soviet Russia invaded all the newly independent nations of the former empire or supported the Bolshevik and socialist forces there, although the success of such invasions was limited. Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania all repelled Soviet invasions, Ukraine and Belarus were divided (as a result of the Polish\u2013Soviet War), while Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia were occupied by the Red Army. By 1921, the Bolsheviks had defeated the national movements in Ukraine and the Caucasus, although anti-Bolshevik uprisings in Central Asia lasted until the late 1920s.\nThe armies under Kolchak were eventually forced on a mass retreat eastward. Bolshevik forces advanced east, despite encountering resistance in Chita, Yakut and Mongolia. Soon the Red Army split the Don and Volunteer armies, forcing evacuations in Novorossiysk in March and Crimea in November 1920. After that, fighting was sporadic until the war ended with the capture of Vladivostok in October 1922, but anti-Bolshevik resistance continued with the Muslim Basmachi movement in Central Asia and Khabarovsk Krai until 1934. There were an estimated 7 to 12\u00a0million casualties during the war, mostly civilians.\nBackground.\nFrom World War I to the Russian Revolution.\nThe Russian Empire fought in World War I from 1914 alongside France and the United Kingdom (Triple Entente) against Germany, Austria-Hungary and the Ottoman Empire (Central Powers).\nThe February Revolution of 1917 resulted in the abdication of Emperor Nicholas II of Russia. As a result, the Russian Provisional Government formed by a coalition of centrist parties was established, and soviets, elected councils of workers, soldiers, and peasants, were organized throughout the country, leading to a situation of dual power. The Russian Republic was proclaimed in September of the same year.\nOctober Revolution.\nThe Provisional Government, led by Socialist Revolutionary Party politician Alexander Kerensky, was unable to solve the most pressing issues of the country, most importantly to end the war with the Central Powers. A failed military coup by General Lavr Kornilov in September 1917 led to a surge in support for the Bolsheviks, who took control of the soviets, which until then had been controlled by the Socialist Revolutionaries. Promising an end to the war and \"all power to the Soviets\", the Bolsheviks then ended dual power by overthrowing the Provisional Government in late October, on the eve of the Second All-Russian Congress of Soviets of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies, in what would be the second Revolution of 1917. The initial stage of the October Revolution which involved the assault on Petrograd occurred largely without any human casualties. Despite the Bolsheviks' seizure of power, they lost to the Socialist Revolutionary Party in the 1917 Russian Constituent Assembly election, and the Constituent Assembly was dissolved by the Bolsheviks in retaliation. The Bolsheviks soon lost the support of other far-left allies, such as the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries, after their acceptance of the terms of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk presented by the German Empire. Conversely, a number of prominent members of the Left Socialist Revolutionaries had assumed positions in Lenin's government and led commissariats in several areas. This included agriculture (Kolegaev), property (Karelin), justice (Steinberg), post offices and telegraphs (Proshian) and local government (Trutovsky). The Bolsheviks also reserved a number of vacant seats in the Soviets and Central Executive for the Menshevik and Left Socialist Revolutionaries parties in proportion to their vote share at the Congress. The dissolution of the Constituent Assembly was also approved by the Left Socialist Revolutionaries and anarchists, both groups were in favour of a more radical democracy.\nFormation of the Red Army.\nFrom mid-1917 onwards, the Russian Army, the successor-organisation of the old Imperial Russian Army, started to disintegrate; the Bolsheviks used the volunteer-based Red Guards as their main military force, augmented by an armed military component of the Cheka (the Bolshevik state secret police). In January 1918, after significant Bolshevik reverses in combat, the future Russian People's Commissar for Military and Naval Affairs Leon Trotsky headed the reorganization of the Red Guards into a \"Workers' and Peasants' Red Army\" in order to create a more effective fighting force. The Bolsheviks appointed political commissars to each unit of the Red Army to maintain morale and to ensure loyalty.\nIn June 1918, when it had become apparent that a revolutionary army composed solely of workers would not suffice, Trotsky instituted mandatory conscription of the rural peasantry into the Red Army. The Bolsheviks overcame opposition of rural Russians to Red Army conscription units by taking hostages and shooting them when necessary in order to force compliance. The forced conscription drive had mixed results, successfully creating a larger army than the Whites, but with members indifferent towards communist ideology.\nThe Red Army also utilized former Tsarist officers as \"military specialists\" (\"voenspetsy\"); sometimes their families were taken hostage in order to ensure their loyalty. At the start of the civil war, former Tsarist officers formed three-quarters of the Red Army officer-corps. By its end, 83% of all Red Army divisional and corps commanders were ex-Tsarist soldiers.\nConstituent Assembly opposition.\nDissolution of the Constituent Assembly, early Constituent Assembly rebellions.\nThe Russian Constituent Assembly had been a demand of the Bolsheviks against the Provisional Government, which kept delaying it. After the October Revolution the elections were run by the body appointed by the previous Provisional Government. It was based on universal suffrage but used party lists from before the Left-Right SR split. The anti-Bolshevik Right SRs won the elections with the majority of the seats, after which Lenin's \"Theses on the Constituent Assembly\" argued in \"Pravda\" that formal democracy was impossible because of class conflicts, conflicts with Ukraine and the Kadet-Kaledin uprising. He argued the Constituent Assembly must unconditionally accept sovereignty of the soviet government or it would be dealt with \"by revolutionary means\".\nOn 30 December 1917, the SR Nikolai Avksentiev and some followers were arrested for organizing a conspiracy. This was the first time Bolsheviks used this kind of repression against a socialist party. \"Izvestia\" said the arrest was not related to his membership in the Constituent Assembly.\nOn 4 January 1918, the All-Russian Central Executive Committee made a resolution saying the slogan \"all power to the constituent assembly\" was counterrevolutionary and equivalent to \"down with the soviets\".\nThe Constituent Assembly met on 18 January 1918. The Right SR Viktor Chernov was elected president defeating the Bolshevik supported candidate, the Left SR Maria Spiridonova (she would later break with the Bolsheviks and after the decades of gulag, she was shot on Stalin's orders in 1941). The Bolsheviks subsequently disbanded the Constituent Assembly and proceeded to rule the country as a one-party state with all opposition parties outlawed in 1921. A simultaneous demonstration in favor of the Constituent Assembly was dispersed with force, but there was little protest afterwards.\nThe first large Cheka repression involving the killing of libertarian socialists in Petrograd began in April 1918. On 1 May 1918, a pitched battle took place in Moscow between the anarchists and the Bolshevik police.\nConstituent Assembly uprising.\nThe Union of Regeneration was founded in Moscow in April 1918 as an underground organization of \"democratic resistance\" to the Bolsheviks, composed of the Popular Socialists and \"personal representatives\" of Right Socialist Revolutionaries, Kadets and Defensists, among others. They were tasked with propping up anti-Bolshevik forces and to create a Russian state system based on \"state consciousness, patriotism and civil liberties\" with the goal to liberate the country from the \"Germano-Bolshevik\" yoke.\nOn 7 May 1918, the Eighth Party Council of the Socialist Revolutionary Party commenced in Moscow and recognized the Union's leading role, putting aside political ideology and class for the purpose of Russia's salvation. They decided to start an uprising against the Bolsheviks with the goal of reconvening the Russian Constituent Assembly. While preparations were under way, the Czechoslovak Legions overthrew Bolshevik rule in Siberia, the Urals and the Volga region in late May-early June 1918 and the center of SR activity shifted there. On 8 June 1918, five Constituent Assembly members formed the All-Russian Committee of Members of the Constituent Assembly (\"Komuch\") in Samara and declared it the new supreme authority in the country. The Social Revolutionary Provisional Government of Autonomous Siberia came to power on 29 June 1918, after the uprising in Vladivostok.\nWhite movement and foreign interventions.\nFrom \"democratic counter-revolution\" to the White movement.\nThe main Russian military and political force opposing the Bolsheviks was known as the White movement, or simply the Whites; its armed formations were known as the White Army.\nSome historians distinguish the White movement from the so-called \"democratic counter-revolution\" led mainly by the Right SRs and the Mensheviks that adhered to the values of parliamentary democracy and maintained anti-Bolshevik counter-governments (Komuch, Ufa Directory) on the basis with alliance with the right-wing parties of Russia until November 1918. Until this period, parliamentary democracy was the main tendency of the anti-Bolshevik forces on the East (but not the South) of Russia, but since then, the White movement unified on an authoritarian-right platform around the figure of Alexander Kolchak, who rose to power through a military coup as its principal leader and his All-Russian government. After the Kolchak coup, the Right SRs and the Mensheviks went to opposition to the Whites and co-operated with both factions of the Civil War on a tactical level, while also attempting to overthrow White administrations or establish themselves as \"the third force\" of the war: for example, they attempted to stage an anti-Kolchak mutiny in November 1919 with the help of the Czech general Radola Gajda, and in 1920, they formed an organisation called 'Political Centre' and successfully overthrew the White administration in Irkutsk.\nAlthough the White movement included a variety of political opinions, from the liberals through monarchists to the ultra-nationalist Black Hundreds, and did not have universally-accepted leader or doctrine, the main force behind the movement were the conservative officers, and the resulting movement shared many traits with widespread right-wing counter-revolutionary movements of the time, namely nationalism, racism, distrust of liberal and democratic politics, clericalism, contempt for the common man and dislike of industrial civilization; although not all of the participants of the movement wanted a restoration of Tsarism, it generally preferred it to the revolution, and its main goal became to establish an order which would share the main features of the imperial one; its positive program was largely summarized in the slogan of \"united and indivisible Russia\" which meant the restoration of imperial state borders (excluding Poland and Finland) and its denial of the right to self-determination and the resulting hostility towards the movements for national independence; the movement is associated with pogroms and antisemitism, although its relations with the Jews were more complex, as at first, for example, Jewish proprietors supported the anti-Bolsheviks, but later the movement became known for its antisemitic pogroms and propaganda and discrimination against the Jews.\nWhen the White Army was created, the structure of the Russian Army of the Provisional Government period was used, while almost every individual formation had its own characteristics. The military art of the White Army was based on the experience of World War I, which, however, left a strong imprint on the specifics of the Civil War.\nAllied intervention.\nThe Western Allies armed and supported the Whites. They were worried about a possible Russo-German alliance, the prospect of the Bolsheviks making good on their threats to default on Imperial Russia's massive foreign debts and the possibility that Communist revolutionary ideas would spread (a concern shared by many Central Powers). Hence, many of the countries expressed their support for the Whites, including the provision of troops and supplies. Winston Churchill declared that Bolshevism must be \"strangled in its cradle\". The British and French had supported Russia during World War I on a massive scale with war materials.\nAfter the treaty, it looked like much of that material would fall into the hands of the Germans. To meet that danger, the Allies intervened with Great Britain and France sending troops into Russian ports. There were violent clashes with the Bolsheviks. Britain intervened in support of the White forces to defeat the Bolsheviks and prevent the spread of communism across Europe.\nCentral Powers anti-Bolshevik intervention.\nThe Central Powers also supported the anti-Bolshevik forces and the Whites; after the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, the main goals of the intervention were to maintain the newly conquered territories and prevent a re-establishment of the Eastern Front. After the defeat of the Central Powers, many armies that stayed mostly helped the Russian White Guard eradicate communists in the Baltics until their eventual withdrawal and defeat. Pro-German factions fought against the newly independent Baltic states until their defeat by the Baltic States, backed by the victorious Allies.\nPro-independence movements and German protectorates.\nThe German Empire created several short-lived buffer states within its sphere of influence after the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk: the United Baltic Duchy, Duchy of Courland and Semigallia, Kingdom of Lithuania, Kingdom of Poland, the Belarusian People's Republic, and the Ukrainian State. Following Germany's Armistice in World War I in November 1918, the states were abolished.\nFinland was the first republic that declared its independence from Russia in December 1917 and established itself in the ensuing Finnish Civil War between nationalist German-supported White Guards and socialist Bolshevik-supported Red Guards from January\u2013May 1918. The Second Polish Republic, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia formed their own armies immediately after the abolition of the Brest-Litovsk Treaty and the start of the Soviet westward offensive and subsequent Polish-Soviet War in November 1918.\nOpposition and repression in Soviet Russia.\nExclusion of Mensheviks and SRs.\nAt the Fifth All\u2013Russian Congress of Soviets of 4 July 1918, the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries had 352 delegates compared to 745 Bolsheviks out of 1132 total. The Left SRs raised disagreements on the suppression of rival parties, the death penalty, and mainly, the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. The Bolsheviks excluded the Right SRs and Mensheviks from the government on 14 June for associating with counterrevolutionaries and seeking to \"organize armed attacks against the workers and peasants\" (though Mensheviks did not exist as a united movement and were split into the left-wing \"internationalist\" and more right-wing factions), while the Left SRs advocated forming a government of all socialist parties. The Left SRs agreed with extrajudicial execution of political opponents to stop the counterrevolution, but opposed having the government legally pronouncing death sentences, an unusual position that is best understood within the context of the group's terrorist past. The Left SRs strongly opposed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk and opposed Trotsky's insistence that no one try to attack German troops in Ukraine.\nAccording to historian Marcel Liebman, Lenin's wartime measures such as banning opposition parties was prompted by the fact that several political parties either took up arms against the new Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, or participated in sabotage, collaboration with the deposed Tsarists, or made assassination attempts against Lenin and other Bolshevik leaders. Liebman noted that opposition parties such as the Cadets and Mensheviks who were democratically elected to the Soviets in some areas, then proceeded to use their mandate to welcome in Tsarist and foreign capitalist military forces. In one incident in Baku, the British military, once invited in, proceeded to execute members of the Bolshevik Party who had peacefully stood down from the Soviet when they failed to win the elections. As a result, the Bolsheviks banned each opposition party when it turned against the Soviet government. In some cases, bans were lifted. This banning of parties did not have the same repressive character as later bans enforced under the Stalinist regime.\nRepression.\nIn December 1917, Felix Dzerzhinsky was appointed to the duty of rooting out counter-revolutionary threats to the Soviet government. He was the director of the All-Russian Extraordinary Commission (aka Cheka), a predecessor of the KGB that served as the secret police for the Soviets.\nThe Bolsheviks had begun to see the anarchists as a legitimate threat and associate criminality such as robberies, expropriations and murders with anarchist associations. Subsequently, the Council of People's Commissars (Sovnarkom) decided to liquidate criminal recklessness associated with anarchists and disarm all anarchist groups in the face of their militancy.\nFrom early 1918, the Bolsheviks started physical elimination of opposition, other socialist and revolutionary fractions. Anarchists were among the first:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Of all the revolutionary elements in Russia it is the Anarchists who now suffer the most ruthless and systematic persecution. Their suppression by the Bolsheviki began already in 1918, when \u2014 in the month of April of that year \u2014 the Communist Government attacked, without provocation or warning, the Anarchist Club of Moscow and by the use of machine guns and artillery \"liquidated\" the whole organisation. It was the beginning of Anarchist hounding, but it was sporadic in character, breaking out now and then, quite planless, and frequently self-contradictory.\u2014\u200a\nPrior to the events that would officially catalyze the Red Terror, Lenin issued orders and made speeches which included harsh descriptions of brutal measures to be taken against the \"class enemies\", which often were not actual orders or were not carried out as such. For example, in a telegram which became known as \"Lenin's hanging order\" he demanded people \"crush\" landowners in Penza and publicly hang \"at least 100 kulaks, rich bastards, and known bloodsuckers\" in response to an uprising there. Yet only the 13 organizers of the murder of local authorities and the uprising were arrested, while the uprising ended. In 1920, having received information that in Estonia and Latvia, with which Soviet Russia had concluded peace treaties, volunteers were being enrolled in anti-Bolshevik detachments, Lenin offered to \"advance by 10\u201320 miles (versts) and hang kulaks, priests, landowners\" \"while pretending to be greens\", but instead, his government confined itself to sending diplomatic notes. Leonid Kannegisser, a young military cadet of the Imperial Russian Army, assassinated Moisey Uritsky on 17 August 1918, outside the Petrograd Cheka headquarters in retaliation for the execution of his friend and other officers.\nOn 30 August, the SR Fanny Kaplan unsuccessfully attempted to assassinate Lenin. who sought to eliminate political dissent, opposition, and any other threat to Bolshevik power. During interrogation by the Cheka, she made the following statement:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nKaplan referenced the Bolsheviks' growing authoritarianism, citing their forcible shutdown of the Constituent Assembly in January 1918, the elections to which they had lost. When it became clear that Kaplan would not implicate any accomplices, she was executed in Alexander Garden. The order was carried out by the commander of the Kremlin, the former Baltic sailor P. D. Malkov and a group of Latvian Bolsheviks on 3 September 1918, with a bullet to the back of the head. Her corpse was bundled into a barrel and set alight. The order came from Yakov Sverdlov, who only six weeks earlier had ordered the murder of the Tsar and his family.\nThese events persuaded the government to heed Dzerzhinsky's lobbying for greater terror against opposition. As a result of the failed attempt on Lenin's life, he began to crack down on his political enemies in an event known as the Red Terror, considered to have begun between 17-30 August 1918. More broadly, the term is applied to Bolshevik political repression throughout the Civil War (1917\u201322). The campaign of mass repressions would officially begin thereafter.\nRevolts against grain requisitioning.\nProtests against grain requisitioning of the peasantry were a major component of the Tambov Rebellion and similar uprisings; Lenin's New Economic Policy was introduced as a concession.\nThe policies of \"food dictatorship\" proclaimed by the Bolsheviks in May 1918 sparked violent resistance in numerous districts of European Russia: revolts and clashes between the peasants and the Red Army were reported in Voronezh, Tambov, Penza, Saratov and in the districts of Kostroma, Moscow, Novgorod, Petrograd, Pskov and Smolensk. The revolts were bloodily crushed by the Bolsheviks: in the Voronezh Oblast, the Red Guards killed sixteen peasants during the pacification of the village, while another village was shelled with artillery in order to force the peasants to surrender and in the Novgorod Oblast the rebelling peasants were dispersed with machine-gun fire from a train sent by a detachment of Latvian Red Army soldiers. While the Bolsheviks immediately denounced the rebellion as orchestrated by the SRs, there is actually no evidence that they were involved into peasant violence, which they deemed as counterproductive.\nGeography and chronology.\nIn the European part of Russia the war was fought across three main fronts: the eastern, the southern and the northwestern. It can also be roughly split into the following periods.\nThe first period lasted from the Revolution until the Armistice, or roughly March 1917 to November 1918. Already on the date of the Revolution, Cossack General Alexey Kaledin refused to recognize it and assumed full governmental authority in the Don region, where the Volunteer Army began amassing support. The signing of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk also resulted in direct Allied intervention in Russia and the arming of military forces opposed to the Bolshevik government. There were also many German commanders who offered support against the Bolsheviks, fearing a confrontation with them was impending as well.\nDuring the first period, the Bolsheviks took control of Central Asia out of the hands of the Provisional Government and White Army, setting up a base for the Communist Party in the Steppe and Turkestan, where nearly two million Russian settlers were located.\nMost of the fighting in the first period was sporadic, involved only small groups and had a fluid and rapidly shifting strategic situation. Among the antagonists were the Czechoslovak Legion, the Poles of the 4th and 5th Rifle Divisions and the pro-Bolshevik Red Latvian riflemen.\nThe second period of the war lasted from January to November 1919. At first the White armies' advances from the south (under Denikin), the east (under Kolchak) and the northwest (under Yudenich) were successful, forcing the Red Army and its allies back on all three fronts. In July 1919 the Red Army suffered another reverse after a mass defection of units in the Crimea to the anarchist Insurgent Army under Nestor Makhno, enabling anarchist forces to consolidate power in Ukraine. Leon Trotsky soon reformed the Red Army, concluding the first of two military alliances with the anarchists. In June the Red Army first checked Kolchak's advance. After a series of engagements, assisted by an Insurgent Army offensive against White supply lines, the Red Army defeated Denikin's and Yudenich's armies in October and November.\nThe third period of the war was the extended siege of the last White forces in the Crimea in 1920. General Wrangel had gathered the remnants of Denikin's armies, occupying much of the Crimea. An attempted invasion of southern Ukraine was rebuffed by the Insurgent Army under Makhno's command. Pursued into Crimea by Makhno's troops, Wrangel went over to the defensive in the Crimea. After an abortive move north against the Red Army, Wrangel's troops were forced south by Red Army and Insurgent Army forces; Wrangel and the remains of his army were evacuated to Constantinople in November 1920.\nWarfare.\nOctober Revolution.\nIn the October Revolution, the Bolshevik Party directed the Red Guard (armed groups of workers and Imperial army deserters) to seize control of Petrograd and immediately began the armed takeover of cities and villages throughout the former Russian Empire. In January 1918 the Bolsheviks dissolved the Russian Constituent Assembly and proclaimed the Soviets (workers' councils) as the new government of Russia.\nInitial anti-Bolshevik uprisings.\nThe first attempt to regain power from the Bolsheviks was made by the Kerensky-Krasnov uprising in October 1917. It was supported by the Junker Mutiny in Petrograd but was quickly put down by the Red Guard, notably including the Latvian Rifle Division.\nThe initial groups that fought against the Communists were local Cossack armies that had declared their loyalty to the Provisional Government. Kaledin of the Don Cossacks and General Grigory Semenov of the Siberian Cossacks were prominent among them. The leading Tsarist officers of the Imperial Russian Army also started to resist. In November, General Mikhail Alekseev, the Tsar's Chief of Staff during the First World War, began to organize the Volunteer Army in Novocherkassk. Volunteers of the small army were mostly officers of the old Russian army, military cadets and students. In December 1917, Alekseev was joined by General Lavr Kornilov, Denikin and other Tsarist officers who had escaped from the jail, where they had been imprisoned following the abortive Kornilov affair just before the Revolution. On 9 December, the Military Revolutionary Committee in Rostov rebelled, with the Bolsheviks controlling the city for five days until the Alekseev Organization supported Kaledin in recapturing the city. According to Peter Kenez, \"The operation, begun on December 9, can be regarded as the beginning of the Civil War.\"\nHaving stated in the November 1917 \"Declaration of Rights of Nations of Russia\" that any nation under imperial Russian rule should be immediately given the power of self-determination, the Bolsheviks had begun to usurp the power of the Provisional Government in the territories of Central Asia soon after the establishment of the Turkestan Committee in Tashkent. In April 1917 the Provisional Government set up the committee, which was mostly made up of former Tsarist officials. The Bolsheviks attempted to take control of the Committee in Tashkent on 12 September 1917 but it was unsuccessful, and many leaders were arrested. However, because the Committee lacked representation of the native population and poor Russian settlers, they had to release the Bolshevik prisoners almost immediately because of a public outcry, and a successful takeover of that government body took place two months later in November. The Leagues of Mohammedam Working People (which Russian settlers and natives who had been sent to work behind the lines for the Tsarist government in 1916 formed in March 1917) had led numerous strikes in the industrial centers throughout September 1917. However, after the Bolshevik destruction of the Provisional Government in Tashkent, Muslim elites formed an autonomous government in Turkestan, commonly called the \"Kokand autonomy\" (or simply Kokand). The White Russians supported that government body, which lasted several months because of Bolshevik troop isolation from Moscow. In January 1918 the Soviet forces, under Lt. Col. Muravyov, invaded Ukraine and invested Kiev, where the Central Council of Ukraine held power. With the help of the Kiev Arsenal Uprising, the Bolsheviks captured the city on 26 January.\nPeace with the Central Powers.\nThe Bolsheviks decided to immediately make peace with the Central Powers, as they had promised the Russian people before the Revolution. Vladimir Lenin's political enemies attributed that decision to his sponsorship by the Foreign Office of Wilhelm II, German Emperor, offered to Lenin in hope that, with a revolution, Russia would withdraw from World War I. That suspicion was bolstered by the German Foreign Ministry's sponsorship of Lenin's return to Petrograd. However, after the military fiasco of the summer offensive (June 1917) by the Russian Provisional Government had devastated the structure of the Russian Army, it became crucial that Lenin realize the promised peace. Even before the failed summer offensive the Russian population was very skeptical about the continuation of the war. Western socialists had promptly arrived from France and from the UK to convince the Russians to continue the fight, but could not change the new pacifist mood of Russia.\nOn 16 December 1917 an armistice was signed between Russia and the Central Powers in Brest-Litovsk and peace talks began. As a condition for peace, the proposed treaty by the Central Powers conceded huge portions of the former Russian Empire to the German Empire and the Ottoman Empire, greatly upsetting nationalists and conservatives. Leon Trotsky, representing the Bolsheviks, refused at first to sign the treaty while continuing to observe a unilateral cease-fire, following the policy of \"No war, no peace\".\nTherefore, on 18 February 1918, the Germans began Operation Faustschlag on the Eastern Front, encountering virtually no resistance in a campaign that lasted 11 days. Signing a formal peace treaty was the only option in the eyes of the Bolsheviks because the Russian Army was demobilized, and the newly formed Red Guard could not stop the advance. The Soviets acceded to a peace treaty, and the formal agreement, the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, was ratified on 3 March. The Soviets viewed the treaty as merely a necessary and expedient means to end the war.\nUkraine, South Russia, and Caucasus (1918).\nIn Ukraine, the German-Austrian Operation Faustschlag had by April 1918 removed the Bolsheviks from Ukraine. The German and Austro-Hungarian victories in Ukraine were caused by the apathy of the locals and the inferior fighting skills of Bolsheviks troops to their Austro-Hungarian and German counterparts.\nUnder Soviet pressure, the Volunteer Army embarked on the epic Ice March from Yekaterinodar to Kuban on 22 February 1918, where they joined with the Kuban Cossacks to mount an abortive assault on Yekaterinodar. The Soviets recaptured Rostov on the next day. Kornilov was killed in the fighting on 13 April, and Denikin took over command. Fighting off its pursuers without respite, the army succeeded in breaking its way through back towards the Don by May, where the Cossack uprising against the Bolsheviks had started.\nThe Baku Soviet Commune was established on 13 April. Germany landed its Caucasus Expedition troops in Poti on 8 June. The Ottoman Army of Islam (in coalition with Azerbaijan) drove them out of Baku on 26 July 1918. Subsequently, the Dashanaks, Right SRs and Mensheviks started negotiations with Gen. Dunsterville, the commander of the British troops in Persia. The Bolsheviks and their Left SR allies were opposed to it, but on 25 July the majority of the Soviets voted to call in the British and the Bolsheviks resigned. The Baku Soviet Commune ended its existence and was replaced by the Central Caspian Dictatorship.\nIn June 1918 the Volunteer Army, numbering some 9,000 men, started its Second Kuban campaign, capturing Yekaterinodar on 16 August, followed by Armavir and Stavropol. By early 1919, they controlled the Northern Caucasus.\nOn 8 October, Alekseev died. On 8 January 1919, Denikin became the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces of South Russia, uniting the Volunteer Army with Pyotr Krasnov's Don Army. Pyotr Wrangel became Denikin's Chief of Staff.\nIn December, three-fourths of the army was in the Northern Caucasus. That included three thousand of Vladimir Liakhov's soldiers around Vladikavkaz, thirteen thousand soldiers under Wrangel and Kazanovich in the center of the front, Stankevich's almost three thousand men with the Don Cossacks, while Vladimir May-Mayevsky's three thousand were sent to the Donets basin, and de Bode commanded two thousand in Crimea.\nEastern Russia, Siberia and the Far East (1918).\nThe revolt of the Czechoslovak Legion broke out in May 1918, and proceeded to occupy the Trans-Siberian Railway from Ufa to Vladivostok. Uprisings overthrew other Bolshevik towns. On 7 July, the western portion of the legion declared itself to be a new eastern front, anticipating allied intervention. According to William Henry Chamberlin, \"Two governments emerged as a result of the first successes of the Czechs: the West Siberian Commissariat and the Government of the Committee of Members of the Constituent Assembly in Samara.\" On 17 July, shortly before the fall of Yekaterinburg, the former tsar and his family were murdered.\nThe Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries supported peasants fighting against Soviet control of food supplies. In May 1918, with the support of the Czechoslovak Legion, they took Samara and Saratov, establishing the Committee of Members of the Constituent Assembly\u2014known as the \"Komuch\". By July the authority of the Komuch extended over much of the area controlled by the Czechoslovak Legion. The Komuch pursued an ambivalent social policy, combining democratic and socialist measures, such as the institution of an eight-hour working day, with \"restorative\" actions, such as returning both factories and land to their former owners. After the fall of Kazan, Vladimir Lenin called for the dispatch of Petrograd workers to the Kazan Front: \"We must send down the \"maximum\" number of Petrograd workers: (1) a few dozen 'leaders' like Kayurov; (2) a few thousand militants 'from the ranks'\".\nAfter a series of reverses at the front, the Bolsheviks' War Commissar, Trotsky, instituted increasingly harsh measures in order to prevent unauthorised withdrawals, desertions, and mutinies in the Red Army. In the field, the Cheka Special Investigations Forces (termed the \"Special Punitive Department of the All-Russian Extraordinary Commission for Combat of Counter-Revolution and Sabotage\" or \"Special Punitive Brigades\") followed the Red Army, conducting field tribunals and summary executions of soldiers and officers who deserted, retreated from their positions, or failed to display sufficient offensive zeal. The Cheka Special Investigations Forces were also charged with the detection of sabotage and counter-revolutionary activity by Red Army soldiers and commanders. Trotsky extended the use of the death penalty to the occasional political commissar whose detachment retreated or broke in the face of the enemy. In August, frustrated at continued reports of Red Army troops breaking under fire, Trotsky authorised the formation of barrier troops \u2013 stationed behind unreliable Red Army units and given orders to shoot anyone withdrawing from the battle line without authorisation.\nIn September 1918, the Komuch, the Siberian Provisional Government, and other anti-Bolshevik Russians agreed during the State Meeting in Ufa to form a new Provisional All-Russian Government in Omsk, headed by a Directory of five: two Socialist-Revolutionaries. Nikolai Avksentiev and Vladimir Zenzinov, the Kadet lawyer V. A. Vinogradov, Siberian premier Vologodskii, and General Vasily Boldyrev.\nBy the fall of 1918, anti-Bolshevik forces in the east included the People's Army (Komuch), the Siberian Army (of the Siberian Provisional Government) and insurgent Cossack units of Orenburg, the Urals, Siberia, Semirechye, Baikal, and Amur and Ussuri Cossacks, nominally under the orders of Gen. V.G. Boldyrev, Commander-in-Chief, appointed by the Ufa Directorate.\nOn the Volga, Col. Kappel's White detachment captured Kazan on 7 August, but Red Forces recaptured the city on 8 September 1918 following a counteroffensive. On the 11th Simbirsk fell, and on 8 October Samara. The Whites fell back eastwards to Ufa and Orenburg.\nIn Omsk, the Russian Provisional Government quickly came under the influence and later the dominance of its new War Minister, the rear-admiral Kolchak. On 18 November, a coup d'\u00e9tat established Kolchak as supreme leader. Two members of the Directory were arrested, and subsequently deported, while Kolchak was proclaimed \"Supreme Ruler\", and \"Commander-in-Chief of all Land and Naval Forces of Russia.\" By mid-December 1918, the White armies had to leave Ufa, but they balanced that failure with a successful drive towards Perm, which they took on 24 December.\nBarrier troops.\nIn the Red Army, the concept of barrier troops first arose in August 1918 with the formation of the \"blocking troops\" or \"anti-retreat detachments\", ( / \"zagraditelnye otriady\"). The barrier troops comprised personnel drawn from the Cheka punitive detachments or from regular Red Army infantry regiments. \nThe first use of the barrier troops by the Red Army occurred in the late summer and fall of 1918 in the Eastern front during the Russian Civil War, when Leon Trotsky authorized Mikhail Tukhachevsky, the commander of the 1st Army, to station blocking detachments behind unreliable Red Army infantry regiments in the 1st Red Army, with orders to shoot if front-line troops either deserted or retreated without permission.\nIn December 1918, Trotsky ordered that detachments of additional barrier troops be raised for attachment to each infantry formation in the Red Army. On 18 December he cabled: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;How do things stand with the blocking units? As far as I am aware they have not been included in our establishment and it appears they have no personnel. It is absolutely essential that we have at least an embryonic network of blocking units and that we work out a procedure for bringing them up to strength and deploying them.\nIn 1919, 616 \"hardcore\" deserters of the total 837,000 draft dodgers and deserters were executed following Trotsky's draconian measures. According to Figes, \"a majority of deserters (most registered as \"weak-willed\") were handed back to the military authorities, and formed into units for transfer to one of the rear armies or directly to the front\". Even those registered as \"malicious\" deserters were returned to the ranks when the demand for reinforcements became desperate\". Figes also noted that the Red Army instituted amnesty weeks to prohibit punitive measures against desertion which encouraged the voluntary return of 98,000-132,000 deserters to the army.\nThe barrier troops were also used to enforce Bolshevik control over food supplies in areas controlled by the Red Army as part of Lenin's war communism policies, a role which soon earned them the hatred of the Russian civilian population.\nThese policies in part led to the Russian famine of 1921\u20131922, which killed about five million people. However, the famine was preceded by bad harvests, harsh winter, drought especially in the Volga Valley which was exacerbated by a range of factors including the war, the presence of the White Army and the methods of war communism. The outbreaks of diseases such as cholera and typhus were also contributing factors to the famine casualties.\nCentral Asia (1918).\nIn February 1918, the Red Army overthrew the White Russian-supported Kokand Autonomy of Turkestan. Although that move seemed to solidify Bolshevik power in Central Asia, more troubles soon arose for the Red Army as the Allied Forces began to intervene. British support of the White Army provided the greatest threat to the Red Army in Central Asia during 1918. Britain sent three prominent military leaders to the area. One was Lieutenant Colonel Frederick Marshman Baile, who recorded a mission to Tashkent, from where the Bolsheviks forced him to flee. Another was General Wilfrid Malleson, leading the Malleson Mission, who assisted the Mensheviks in Ashkhabad (now the capital of Turkmenistan) with a small Anglo-Indian force. However, he failed to gain control of Tashkent, Bukhara and Khiva. The third was Major General Dunsterville, who was driven out by the Bolsheviks of Central Asia only a month after his arrival in August 1918. Despite setbacks as a result of British invasions during 1918, the Bolsheviks continued to make progress in bringing the Central Asian population under their influence. The first regional congress of the Russian Communist Party convened in the city of Tashkent in June 1918 in order to build support for a local Bolshevik Party.\nLeft SR Uprising.\nOn 6 July 1918, two Left Socialist-Revolutionaries and Cheka employees, Yakov Blumkin and Nikolai Andreyev, assassinated the German ambassador, Count Mirbach. In Moscow a Left SR uprising was put down by the Bolsheviks, mass arrests of Socialist-Revolutionaries followed, and executions became more frequent. Chamberlin noted, \"The time of relative leniency toward former fellow-revolutionists was over. The Left Socialist Revolutionaries, of course, were no longer tolerated as members of the Soviets; from this time the Soviet regime became a pure and undiluted dictatorship of the Communist Party.\" Similarly, Boris Savinkov's surprise attacks were suppressed, and many of the conspirators executed, as \"Mass Red Terror\" became a reality.\nEstonia, Latvia and Petrograd.\nEstonia cleared its territory of the Red Army by January 1919. Baltic German volunteers captured Riga from the Red Latvian Riflemen on 22 May, but the Estonian 3rd Division defeated the Baltic Germans a month later, aiding the establishment of the Republic of Latvia.\nThat rendered possible another threat to the Red Army, from General Yudenich, who had spent the summer organizing the Northwestern Army in Estonia with local and British support. In October 1919, he tried to capture Petrograd in a sudden assault with a force of around 20,000 men. The attack was well-executed, using night attacks and lightning cavalry maneuvers to turn the flanks of the defending Red Army. Yudenich also had six British tanks, which caused panic whenever they appeared. The Allies gave large quantities of aid to Yudenich, but he complained of receiving insufficient support.\nBy 19 October, Yudenich's troops had reached the outskirts of the city. Some members of the Bolshevik central committee in Moscow were willing to give up Petrograd, but Trotsky refused to accept the loss of the city and personally organized its defenses. Trotsky himself declared, \"It is impossible for a little army of 15,000 ex-officers to master a working-class capital of 700,000 inhabitants.\" He settled on a strategy of urban defense, proclaiming that the city would \"defend itself on its own ground\" and that the White Army would be lost in a labyrinth of fortified streets and there \"meet its grave\".\nTrotsky armed all available workers, men and women, and ordered the transfer of military forces from Moscow. Within a few weeks, the Red Army defending Petrograd had tripled in size and outnumbered Yudenich three to one. Yudenich, short of supplies, then decided to call off the siege of the city and withdrew. He repeatedly asked permission to withdraw his army across the border to Estonia. However, units retreating across the border were disarmed and interned by orders of the Estonian government, which had entered into peace negotiations with the Soviet Government on 16 September and had been informed by the Soviet authorities of their 6 November decision that if the White Army was allowed to retreat into Estonia, it would be pursued across the border by the Reds. In fact, the Reds attacked Estonian army positions and fighting continued until a ceasefire went into effect on 3 January 1920. After the Treaty of Tartu, most of Yudenich's soldiers went into exile. Former Imperial Russian and then Finnish General Mannerheim planned an intervention to help the Whites in Russia capture Petrograd. However, he did not gain the necessary support for the endeavour. Lenin considered it \"completely certain, that the slightest aid from Finland would have determined the fate of [the city]\".\nNorthern Russia (1919).\nThe British occupied Murmansk and seized Arkhangelsk alongside United States forces. With the retreat of Kolchak in Siberia, they pulled their troops out of the cities before the winter trapped them in the port. The remaining White forces under Yevgeny Miller evacuated the region in February 1920.\nSiberia (1919).\nAt the beginning of March 1919, the general offensive of the Whites on the eastern front began. Ufa was retaken on 13 March; by mid-April, the White Army stopped at the Glazov\u2013Chistopol\u2013Bugulma\u2013Buguruslan\u2013Sharlyk line. Reds started their counteroffensive against Kolchak's forces at the end of April. The Red 5th Army, led by the capable commander Tukhachevsky, captured Elabuga on 26 May, Sarapul on 2 June and Izevsk on the 7th and continued to push forward. Both sides had victories and losses, but by the middle of summer the Red Army was larger than the White Army and had managed to recapture territory previously lost.\nFollowing the abortive offensive at Chelyabinsk, the White armies withdrew beyond the Tobol. In September 1919 a White offensive was launched against the Tobol Front, the last attempt to change the course of events. However, on 14 October the Reds counterattacked, and thus began the uninterrupted retreat of the Whites to the east. On 14 November 1919 the Red Army captured Omsk. Adm. Kolchak lost control of his government shortly after the defeat; White Army forces in Siberia had essentially ceased to exist by December. Retreat of the eastern front by White armies lasted three months, until mid-February 1920, when the survivors, after crossing Lake Baikal, reached the Chita area and joined Ataman Semenov's forces.\nSouth Russia (1919).\nThe Cossacks had been unable to organise and capitalise on their successes at the end of 1918. By 1919 they had begun to run short of supplies. Consequently, when the Soviet Russian counteroffensive began in January 1919 under the Bolshevik commander Antonov-Ovseenko, the Cossack forces rapidly fell apart. The Red Army captured Kiev on 3 February 1919.\nDenikin's military strength continued to grow in 1919, with significant munitions supplied by the British empire. In January, Denikin's Armed Forces of South Russia (AFSR) completed the elimination of Red forces in the northern Caucasus and moved north, in an effort to protect the Don district.\nOn 18 December 1918, French forces landed in Odessa and Crimea, but evacuated Odessa on 6 April 1919, and the Crimea by the end of the month. According to Chamberlin, \"France gave far less practical aid to the Whites than did England; its sole independent venture in intervention, at Odessa, ended in a complete fiasco.\"\nDenikin then reorganized the Armed Forces of South Russia under the leadership of Vladimir May-Mayevsky, Vladimir Sidorin, and Pyotr Wrangel. On 22 May, Wrangel's Caucasian army defeated the 10th Army (RSFSR) in the battle for Velikoknyazheskaya, and then captured Tsaritsyn on 1 July. Sidorin advanced north toward Voronezh, increasing his army's strength in the process. On 25 June, May\u2013Mayevsky captured Kharkov, and then Ekaterinoslav on 30 June, which forced the Reds to abandon Crimea. On 3 July, Denikin issued his Moscow directive, in which his armies would converge on Moscow.\nAlthough Britain had withdrawn its own troops from the theatre, it continued to give significant military aid (money, weapons, food, ammunition and some military advisers) to the White Armies during 1919. Major Ewen Cameron Bruce of the British Army had volunteered to command a British tank mission assisting the White Army. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Order for his bravery during the June 1919 Battle of Tsaritsyn for single-handedly storming and capturing the fortified city of Tsaritsyn, under heavy shell fire in a single tank, which led to the capture of over 40,000 prisoners. The fall of Tsaritsyn is viewed \"as one of the key battles of the Russian Civil War\" and greatly helped the White Russian cause. The notable historian Sir Basil Henry Liddell Hart comments that Bruce's tank action during the battle is to be seen as \"one of the most remarkable feats in the whole history of the Tank Corps\".\nOn 14 August, the Bolsheviks launched their Southern Front counteroffensive. After six weeks of heavy fighting the counteroffensive failed, and Denikin was able to capture more territory. By November, White Forces had reached the Zbruch, the Ukrainian-Polish border.\nDenikin's forces constituted a real threat and for a time threatened to reach Moscow. The Red Army, stretched thin by fighting on all fronts, was forced out of Kiev on 30 August. Kursk and Orel were taken, on 20 September and 14 October, respectively. The latter, only from Moscow, was the closest the AFSR would come to its target. The Cossack Don Army under the command of General Vladimir Sidorin continued north towards Voronezh, but Semyon Budyonny's cavalrymen defeated them there on 24 October. That allowed the Red Army to cross the Don River, threatening to split the Don and Volunteer Armies. Fierce fighting took place at the key rail junction of Kastornoye, which was taken on 15 November. Kursk was retaken two days later.\nKenez states, \"In October Denikin ruled more than forty million people and controlled the economically most valuable parts of the Russian Empire.\" Yet, \"The White armies, which had fought victoriously during the summer and early fall, fell back in disorder in November and December.\" Denikin's front line was overstretched, while his reserves dealt with Makhno's anarchists in the rear. Between September and October, the Reds mobilized one hundred thousand new soldiers and adopted the Trotsky-V\u0101cietis strategy with the Ninth and Tenth armies forming V. I. Shorin's Southeastern Front between Tsaritsyn and Bobrov, while the Eighth, Twelfth, Thirteenth, and Fourteenth armies formed A. I. Egorov's Southern Front between Zhitomir and Bobrov. Sergey Kamenev was in overall command of the two fronts. On Denikin's left was Abram Dragomirov, while in his center was Vladimir May-Mayevsky's Volunteer Army, Vladimir Sidorin's Don Cossacks were further east, with Wrangel's Caucasian army at Tsaritsyn, and an additional was in the Northern Caucasus attempting to capture Astrakhan. On 20 October, May\u2013Mayevsky was forced to evacuate Orel during the Orel-Kursk operation. On 24 October, Semyon Budyonny captured Voronezh, and Kursk on 15 November, during the Voronezh-Kastornoye operation (1919). On 6 January, the Reds reached the Black Sea at Mariupol and Taganrog, and on 9 January, they reached Rostov. According to Kenez, \"The Whites had now lost all the territories which they had captured in 1919, and held approximately the same area in which they had started two years before.\"\nCentral Asia (1919).\nBy February 1919 the British government had pulled its military forces out of Central Asia. Despite the success for the Red Army, the White Army's assaults in European Russia and other areas broke communication between Moscow and Tashkent. For a time, Central Asia was completely cut off from Red Army forces in Siberia. Although the communication failure weakened the Red Army, the Bolsheviks continued their efforts to gain support for the Bolshevik Party in Central Asia by holding a second regional conference in March. During the conference, a regional bureau of Muslim organisations of the Russian Bolshevik Party was formed. The Bolshevik Party continued to try to gain support among the native population by giving it the impression of better representation for the Central Asian population and throughout the end of the year could maintain harmony with the Central Asian people.\nCommunication difficulties with Red Army forces in Siberia and European Russia ceased to be a problem by mid-November 1919. Red Army successes north of Central Asia caused communication with Moscow to be re-established and the Bolsheviks to claim victory over the White Army in Turkestan.\nIn the Ural-Guryev operation of 1919\u20131920, the Red Turkestan Front defeated the Ural Army. During winter 1920, Ural Cossacks and their families, totaling about 15,000 people, headed south along the eastern coast of the Caspian Sea towards Fort Alexandrovsk. Only a few hundred of them reached Persia in June 1920. The Orenburg Independent Army was formed from Orenburg Cossacks and other troops who rebelled against the Bolsheviks. During the winter 1919\u201320, the Orenburg Army retreated to Semirechye in what is known as the Starving March, as half of the participants perished. In March 1920 her remnants crossed the border into the Northwestern region of China.\nSouth Russia, Ukraine and Kronstadt (1920\u20131921).\nAt the beginning of 1920, Denikin was reduced to defending Novorossia, the Crimean peninsula, and the Northern Caucasus. On 26 January, the Caucasian army retreated beyond the Manych. On 7 February, the Reds occupied Odessa, but then Makhno's anarchists started fighting the Fourteenth Red Army. On 20 February, Denikin succeeded in recapturing Rostov, his last victory, before giving it up soon after.\nBy the beginning of 1920, the main body of the Armed Forces of South Russia was rapidly retreating towards the Don, to Rostov. Denikin hoped to hold the crossings of the Don, then rest and reform his troops, but the White Army was not able to hold the Don area, and at the end of February 1920 started a retreat across Kuban towards Novorossiysk. Slipshod evacuation of Novorossiysk proved to be a dark event for the White Army. Russian and Allied ships evacuated about 40,000 of Denikin's men from Novorossiysk to the Crimea, without horses or any heavy equipment, while about 20,000 men were left behind and either dispersed or were captured by the Red Army. Following the disastrous Novorossiysk evacuation, Denikin stepped down and the military council elected Wrangel as the new Commander-in-Chief of the White Army. He was able to restore order to the dispirited troops and reshape an army that could fight as a regular force again. It remained an organized force in the Crimea throughout 1920.\nAfter Moscow's Bolshevik government signed a military and political alliance with Nestor Makhno and the Ukrainian anarchists, the Insurgent Army attacked and defeated several regiments of Wrangel's troops in southern Ukraine, forcing him to retreat before he could capture that year's grain harvest.\nStymied in his efforts to consolidate his hold, Wrangel then attacked north in an attempt to take advantage of recent Red Army defeats at the close of the Polish\u2013Soviet War of 1919\u20131920. The Red Army eventually halted the offensive, and Wrangel's troops had to retreat to Crimea in November 1920, pursued by both the Red and Black cavalry and infantry. Wrangel's fleet evacuated him and his army to Constantinople on 14 November 1920, ending the struggle of Reds and Whites in Southern Russia.\nAfter the defeat of Wrangel, the Red Army immediately repudiated its 1920 treaty of alliance with Nestor Makhno and attacked the anarchist Insurgent Army; the campaign to liquidate Makhno and the Ukrainian anarchists began with an attempted assassination of Makhno by Cheka agents. Anger at continued repression by the Bolshevik Communist government and at its liberal use of the Cheka to put down anarchist elements led to a naval mutiny at Kronstadt in March 1921, followed by peasant revolts \u2013 all of which were put down by the Bolsheviks. The outset of the year was marked by strikes and demonstrations \u2013 in both Moscow and Petrograd, as well as the countryside \u2013 due to discontent with the results of policies that made up war communism. The Bolsheviks, in response to the protests, enacted martial law and sent the Red Army to disperse the workers. This was followed up by mass arrests executed by the Cheka. Repression and minor concessions only temporarily quelled the discontent as Petrograd protests continued that year in March. This time the factory workers were joined by sailors stationed on the nearby island-fort of Kronstadt. Disappointed in the direction of the Bolshevik government, the rebels demanded a series of reforms including: reduction in Bolshevik privileges, newly elected soviets to include socialist and anarchist groups, economic freedom for peasants and workers, dissolution of the bureaucratic governmental organs created during the civil war, and the restoration of worker rights for the working class. The workers and sailors of the Kronstadt rebellion were promptly crushed by Red Army forces, with a thousand rebels killed in battle and another thousand executed the following weeks, with many more fleeing abroad and to the countryside. These events coincided with the 10th Congress of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks). There, Lenin argued that the soviets and the principle of democratic centralism within the Bolshevik party still assured democracy. However, faced with support for Kronstadt within Bolshevik ranks, Lenin also issued a \"temporary\" ban on factions in the Russian Communist Party. This ban remained until the revolutions of 1989 and, according to some critics, made the democratic procedures within the party an empty formality, and helped Stalin to consolidate much more authority under the party. Soviets were transformed into the bureaucratic structure that existed for the rest of the history of the Soviet Union and were completely under the control of party officials and the politburo. Red Army attacks on the anarchist forces and their sympathisers increased in ferocity throughout 1921.\nSiberia and the Far East (1920\u20131923).\nIn Siberia, Admiral Kolchak's army had disintegrated. He himself gave up command after the loss of Omsk and designated Gen. Grigory Semyonov as the new leader of the White Army in Siberia. Not long afterward, Kolchak was arrested by the disaffected Czechoslovak Legion as he traveled towards Irkutsk without the protection of the army and was turned over to the socialist Political Centre in Irkutsk. Six days later, the regime was replaced by a Bolshevik-dominated Military-Revolutionary Committee. On 6\u20137 February Kolchak and his prime minister Victor Pepelyaev were shot, and their bodies were thrown through the ice of the frozen Angara River, just before the arrival of the White Army in the area.\nRemnants of Kolchak's army reached Transbaikalia and joined Semyonov's troops, forming the Far Eastern army. With the support of the Japanese army, it was able to hold Chita, but after the withdrawal of Japanese soldiers from Transbaikalia, Semenov's position became untenable and in November 1920 he was driven by the Red Army from Transbaikalia and took refuge in China. The Japanese, who had plans to annex the Amur Krai, finally pulled their troops out as Bolshevik forces gradually asserted control over the Russian Far East. On 25 October 1922 Vladivostok fell to the Red Army, and the Provisional Priamur Government was soon extinguished:\nWhen the Japanese withdrew from the Priamurye (June to October 1922), the Soviet army of the Far Eastern Republic retook most of the Priamurye Government territory. \nThe Ayano-Maysky District was controlled by Anatoly Pepelyayev at that time; its surrender in June 1923 marked the end of the Russian Civil War.\nAftermath.\nWith the end of the war, the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) no longer faced an acute military threat to its existence and power. However, the perceived threat of continued popular discontent, combined with the failure of socialist revolutions in other countries, such as the German revolution of 1918\u20131919, contributed to the continued militarization of Soviet society.\nThe Bolsheviks managed to consolidate control over Russia, but were only partially successful at re-establishing territorial control of the other provinces of the former Russian Empire. The treaty of Riga, which was signed in March 1921 after the Polish\u2013Soviet War, split the territories in Belarus and Ukraine between the Republic of Poland and Soviet Russia. Estonia, Finland, Latvia, and Lithuania all repelled Soviet invasions, while Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia were occupied by the Red Army. In 1925, the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) changed its name to the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks).\nEvacuations.\nAround one to two million people known as the White \u00e9migr\u00e9s fled Russia, many with General Wrangel, some through the Far East and others west into the newly independent Baltic countries. The \u00e9migr\u00e9s included a large percentage of the educated and skilled population of Russia.\nEnsuing rebellion.\nIn Central Asia, Red Army troops continued to face resistance into 1923, where \"basmachi\" (armed bands of Islamic guerrillas) had formed to fight the Bolshevik takeover. The Soviets engaged non-Russian peoples in Central Asia, like Magaza Masanchi, commander of the Dungan Cavalry Regiment, to fight against the Basmachis. The Communist Party did not completely dismantle the group until 1934.\nGeneral Anatoly Pepelyayev continued armed resistance in the Ayano-Maysky District until June 1923. The regions of Kamchatka and Northern Sakhalin remained under Japanese occupation until their treaty with the Soviet Union in 1925, when their forces were finally withdrawn.\nCasualties.\nThe results of the civil war were momentous. In total, the Red Army lost 939,755 killed and missing, the White Army also suffered high losses of 650,000 killed Soviet demographer Boris Urlanis estimated that 300,000 men were killed in action during the Civil War and Polish-Soviet War \u2013 125,000 in the Red Army, 175,500 White armies and Poles \u2013 and the total number of military personnel from both sides dead from disease as 450,000. Boris Sennikov estimated the total losses among the population of Tambov region in 1920 to 1922 resulting from the war, executions, and imprisonment in concentration camps as approximately 240,000. By 1922, there were at least 7,000,000 street children in Russia as a result of nearly ten years of devastation from World War I and the civil war.\nAt the end of the Civil War the Russian SFSR was exhausted and near ruin. The droughts of 1920 and 1921, as well as the Russian famine of 1921, worsened the disaster still further, killing roughly 5 million people. Disease had reached pandemic proportions, with 3,000,000 dying of typhus throughout the war. Millions more also died of widespread starvation, wholesale massacres by both sides and pogroms against Jews in Ukraine and southern Russia.\nCivilian casualties.\nAs many as 10 million people died as a result of the Russian Civil War, and the overwhelming majority of these were civilian casualties. There is no consensus among the Western historians on the number of deaths from the Red Terror. One source gives estimates of 28,000 executions per year from December 1917 to February 1922. Estimates for the number of people shot during the initial period of the Red Terror are at least 10,000. Estimates for the whole period go for a low of 50,000 to highs of 140,000 and 200,000 executed. Most estimations for the number of executions in total put the number at about 100,000. According to Vadim Erlikhman's investigation, the number of the Red Terror's victims is at least 1,200,000 people. According to Robert Conquest, a total of 140,000 people were shot in 1917\u20131922, but Jonathan D. Smele estimates they were considerably fewer, \"perhaps less than half that many\". Candidate of Historical Sciences Nikolay Zayats states that the number of people shot by the Cheka in 1918\u20131922 is about 37,300 people, shot in 1918\u20131921 by the verdicts of the tribunals \u2014 14,200, i.e. about 50,000\u201355,000 people in total, although executions and atrocities were not limited to the Cheka, having been organized by the Red Army as well. In 1924, an anti-Bolshevik Popular Socialist Sergei Melgunov (1879\u20131956) published a detailed account on the Red Terror in Russia, where he cited Professor Charles Sarol\u00e9a's estimates of 1,766,188 deaths from the Bolshevik policies. He questioned the accuracy of the figures, but endorsed Sarol\u00e9a's \"characterisation of terror in Russia\", stating it matches reality. Modern historian Sergei Volkov, assessing the Red Terror as the entire repressive policy of the Bolsheviks during the years of the Civil War (1917\u20131922), estimates the direct death toll of the Red Terror at 2 million people. Volkov's calculations, however, do not appear to have been confirmed by other major scholars.\nEthnic violence.\nSome 10,000\u2013500,000 Cossacks were killed or deported during Decossackization, out of a population of around three million. An estimated 100,000 Jews were killed in Ukraine. Punitive organs of the All Great Don Cossack Host sentenced 25,000 people to death between May 1918 and January 1919. Kolchak's government shot 25,000 people in Ekaterinburg province alone. The White Terror, as it would become known, killed about 300,000 people in total.\nEconomic impact.\nThe civil war had a devastating impact on the Russian economy. A black market emerged in Russia, despite the threat of martial law against profiteering. The ruble collapsed, with barter increasingly replacing money as a medium of exchange and, by 1921, heavy industry output had fallen to 20% of 1913 levels. 90% of wages were paid with goods rather than money. 70% of locomotives needed repair, and food requisitioning, combined with the effects of seven years of war and a severe drought, contributed to a famine that caused between 3 and 10 million deaths. Coal production decreased from 27.5 million tons (1913) to 7 million tons (1920), while overall factory production also declined from 10,000 million roubles to 1,000 million roubles. According to the noted historian David Christian, the grain harvest was also slashed from 80.1 million tons (1913) to 46.5 million tons (1920).\nWar communism saved the Soviet government during the Civil War, but much of the Russian economy had ground to a standstill. Some peasants responded to food requisitions by refusing to till the land. By 1921, cultivated land had shrunk to 62% of the pre-war area, and the harvest yield was only about 37% of normal. The number of horses declined from 35\u00a0million in 1916 to 24\u00a0million in 1920 and cattle from 58 to 37\u00a0million. The exchange rate with the US dollar declined from two roubles in 1914 to 1,200\u00a0Rbls in 1920. Although Russia experienced extremely rapid economic growth in the 1930s, the combined effect of World War I and the Civil War left a lasting scar on Russian society and had permanent effects on the development of the Soviet Union.\nPolitical impact.\nThe complete failure of the Communist International-inspired revolutions was a sobering experience in Moscow, and the Bolsheviks moved from world revolution to socialism in one country, the Soviet Union.\nThe Treaty of Rapallo (1922) was an agreement signed on 16 April 1922 between the Weimar Republic and Soviet Union, under which both renounced all territorial and financial claims against each other and opened friendly diplomatic relations.\nIn fiction.\nLiterature.\nThe Civil War was a popular theme among the Socialist realism writers; it was championed in the works of such authors as Dmitri Furmanov (\"\", 1923), Alexander Serafimovich, Vsevolod Vishnevsky (\"An Optimistic Tragedy\", 1933) and Aleksandr Fadeyev; one of the best-known examples is the novel \"How the Steel Was Tempered\" (1934) by Nikolai Ostrovsky.\nOther prominent works of fiction by the Soviet writers that didn't follow the methods and doctrine of Socialist realism include:\nby the White \"\u00e9migr\u00e9\" authors:\nWorks by the Western and contemporary authors:\nFilm.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Rising to the rank of lieutenant general in the British army, he also served as the Commander-in-Chief, Ireland and was noted for his military service during the French Revolutionary Wars, which included defeating the French invasion of Egypt and Syria. His strategies are ranked amongst the most daring and brilliant exploits of the British army.\nEarly life.\nRalph Abercromby was born on 7 October 1734 at Menstrie Castle, Clackmannanshire. He was the second (but eldest surviving) son of George Abercromby (1705-1800), a lawyer and descendant of the Abercromby family of Birkenbog, Aberdeenshire and Mary Dundas (died 1767), daughter of Ralph Dundas of Manour, Perthshire. His younger brothers include the advocate Alexander Abercromby, Lord Abercromby and General Robert Abercromby.\nThe family had acquired Menstrie Castle in 1719 but their main family house was the nearby Tullibody House which they had built around 1700. Much of Ralph's childhood was spent in the latter.\nAbercromby's education was begun by a private tutor, then continued at the school of Mr Moir in Alloa, then considered one of the best in Scotland despite its Jacobite leanings. Ralph attended Rugby School from 12 June 1748, where he remained until he was 18. Between 1752 and 1753, he was a student at the University of Edinburgh. There he studied moral and natural philosophy and civil law, and was regarded by his professors as sound rather than brilliant. He completed his studies at Leipzig University in Germany from autumn 1754, taking more detailed studies in civil law with a view to a career as an advocate.\nCareer.\nOn returning from the continent, Abercromby expressed a strong preference for the military profession, and a cornet's commission was accordingly obtained for him (March 1756) in the 3rd Dragoon Guards. He served with his regiment in the Seven Years' War, and thus, the opportunity afforded him of studying the methods of Frederick the Great, which moulded his military character and formed his tactical ideas. Abercromby rose through the intermediate grades to the rank of lieutenant-colonel of the regiment (1773) and brevet colonel in 1780, and in 1781, he became colonel of the newly raised 103rd Regiment of Foot. When the regiment was disbanded in 1783, he retired on half pay. \nIn 1774, Abercromby entered Parliament as MP for Clackmannanshire (1774\u20131780). In 1791 he commissioned a large townhouse at 66 Queen Street, Edinburgh. During the American War of Independence, he was a strong supporter of the Patriot cause and chose to serve in Ireland to avoid having to fight in North America. \nWhen France declared war on Great Britain in 1793, Abercromby returned to active duty. He was appointed commander of a brigade under the Duke of York for service in the Netherlands, where he commanded the advanced guard in the action at Le Cateau. During the 1794 withdrawal to Holland, he commanded the allied forces in the action at Boxtel and was wounded directing operations at Fort St Andries on the Waal. In 1795 he commissioned a townhouse at 66 Queen Street, Edinburgh.\nIn July 1795, Abercromby was nominated by Secretary of State for War Henry Dundas to lead an expedition to the West Indies. That same month he had been made a Knight of the Bath and in August Lieutenant Governor of the Isle of Wight \u2013 a reward for his services but also possibly an incentive to lead the army in the Caribbean. The appointment of Abercromby as Commander-in-Chief of the Leeward and Windward Islands was officially announced on 5 August.\nOn 17 March 1796 Abercromby arrived in Carlisle Bay, Barbados onboard HMS \"Arethusa\". A third of the 6,000 troops that had arrived on the island before him had already been sent on to Saint Vincent and Grenada, leaving the general with 3,700 soldiers at his disposal. Control of much of Saint Vincent had been lost to rebelling French planters and native Caribs since early 1795, while Grenada was in the midst of an insurrection led by Julien F\u00e9don. The reinforcements to Grenada allowed General Nicolls to attack enemy posts south of Port Royal on 25 March, preventing further French reinforcements from Guadeloupe. Three months later Abercromby arrived with further reinforcements and attacked F\u00e9don's camp on 19 June, routing the insurgents and ending the rebellion.\nThe British fleet sailed on 25 April 1796 for Saint Lucia, landing the following day and establishing a beachhead. The French were soon repelled and retreated to the fort at Morne Fortune, which Abercromby decided to besiege. The garrison under General Goyrand surrendered to the British army 26 May. The island had been retaken at the cost of 566 men. A force of around 4,000 was left to hold Saint Lucia under the command of Colonel John Moore before Abercromby left for Saint Vincent at the beginning of June.\nAbercromby arrived on Saint Vincent 7 June with a force of just over 4,000. He marched his troops near to the insurgent base at Vigie Ridge and camped nearby as the British started to execute an encircling movement: Quartermaster General John Knox manoeuvred his men on the seaward side in order to prevent the enemy retreating north, and Lieutenant Colonel Dickens used the 34th Regiment as a diversion on the opposite side. Knox was able to cut off communications with the Vigie, whilst Dickens ousted the nearby Caribs to complete the encirclement. The black French commander, Marinier, signed terms of surrender on 11 June and the Caribs did 4 days later. The British took around 200 prisoners, with another 200 escaping into the jungle. Although some of the Caribs would remain in resistance until October, the rebellion had effectively been put down at the cost of 17 officers and 168 men killed or wounded.\nIn February 1797, the General Abercromby launched the invasion of Trinidad. His squadron sailed through the Bocas and anchored off the coast of Chaguaramas. The Spanish Governor Chac\u00f3n decided to capitulate without fighting. Trinidad thus became a British crown colony, with a French-speaking population of Catholic faith and Spanish laws. British rule was formalized under the Treaty of Amiens (1802).\nAfterwards, Abercromby secured possession of the settlements of Demerara and Essequibo in South America. A major assault on the port of San Juan, Puerto Rico, in April 1797 failed after fierce fighting where both sides suffered heavy losses.\nAbercromby returned to Europe and, in reward for his services, was appointed colonel of the 2nd (Royal North British) Regiment of Dragoons. He was also made Lieutenant-Governor of the Isle of Wight, Governor of Fort George and Fort Augustus in the Scottish Highlands, and promoted to the rank of Lieutenant-general. He again entered Parliament as the member for Clackmannanshire from 1796 to 1798.\nIn 1798, Abercromby was made Commander-in-Chief of the forces in Ireland, then in rebellion and anticipating French intervention. He took the unusual step of publicly criticising the command of his predecessor, The 2nd Earl of Carhampton, for bequeathing an army \"in a state of licentiousness, which must render it formidable to everyone but the enemy\". To quote the biographic entry in the 1888 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt; Abercromby was replaced in Ireland by Gerrard Lake who favoured an aggressive approach in putting down the rebellion, as opposed to Abercromby's attempts at conciliation.\nAfter holding for a short period the office of commander-in-chief in Scotland, Abercromby was again called to command under the Duke of York in the 1799 Anglo-Russian expedition against the Napoleonic Dutch Republic. Abercromby conducted a textbook amphibious landing at Callantsoog establishing a beachhead and driving the Franco-Dutch army inland at Krabbendam. The high watermark of British success came when a squadron of the Dutch fleet then surrendered and the Anglo-Russian army advanced through North Holland capturing the cities of Hoorn, Enkhuizen and Medemblik. However, with the Duke of York now in overall command Anglo-Russian fortunes turned sour following the reverse at Castricum. The expected Orangist uprising in the North Holland peninsula never materialized and allies withdrew to their original positions. The expedition ended with the signing of the Convention of Alkmaar in which the Anglo-Russian force was allowed to withdraw.\nAfter spending time with Dundas over Christmas, Abercromby was summoned to London 21 January 1800. The Portuguese, concerned that they were under threat from Spain, requested British support and wanted Abercromby to lead their army. However, Abercromby refused to serve under a foreign ruler and would only take command of a joint army. Before he could leave for Portugal to inspect their defences and army, the resignation of General Charles Stuart in the Mediterranean in April led to a change of plans. The Austrian plan was that Abercromby could create a distraction from the activities of General Michael von Melas in North Italy by landing at various points on the Italian coast. Abercromby received instruction from London to send 2,500\u20133,000 men to take French-occupied Malta. Thereafter, he was to receive a further 6,000 men to assist the Austrians. General Charles O'Hara in Gibraltar was pleased with the appointment, for while Stuart had been hot-tempered and difficult to work with, Abercromby was \"a reasonable, considerate good soldier, and listens with temper and patience to every proposal made to him\". However, delays caused by the weather meant that the situation in Italy had changed drastically by the time that Abercromby reached Minorca 22 June.\nIn 1801, Abercromby was sent with an army to recover Egypt from France. His experience in the Netherlands and the West Indies particularly fitted him for this new command, as was proved when he carried his army in health, in spirits, and with the requisite supplies to the destined scene of action despite great difficulties. The debarkation of the troops at Aboukir, in the face of strenuous opposition, is justly ranked among the most daring and brilliant exploits of the British army.\nBattle of Alexandria, 1801.\nAbercromby commanded the expedition to the Mediterranean in 1800, and after successfully landing the army at Aboukir and driving the French inland, defeated an attempted French counter-attack at Alexandria, 21 March 1801. Jacques-Fran\u00e7ois Menou had arrived from Cairo and was determined to defeat the British advance. On 20 March, the British forces extended across the isthmus, the right wing resting upon the ruins of Nicopolis and the sea, the left on the lake of Abukir. The line faced generally south-west towards the city, the reserve division under Major-General Sir John Moore.\nAbercromby anticipated a night attack, so the British slept in position under arms. At 3:30\u00a0a.m. French forces attacked and drove in the British outposts. Moving forward rapidly with great gallantry from the left, Lanusse launched the attack with Valentin's brigade in column along the seashore, and to their right Silly's brigade against the British entrenchments around the roman ruins. The brunt of the attack fell upon Moore's command, and in particular upon the 28th (North Gloucestershire) Regiment of Foot. The British repulsed this first assault, during which both Silly and Lanusse were hit.\n\u201cGeneral Lanusse saw that General Valentin had left the seashore, and was within the re-entering angle of the redoubt and the Roman camp, where the cross fire of the enemy held him back. General Lanusse marched to this spot, encouraged the men, and made them advance. The worthy general was hit in the thigh by a ball from a gun-boat; four grenadiers tried to carry him off, but a second ball killed two of these brave fellows\u201d. Soon Rampon's command in the centre was engaged, and despite disorientation in the dark, penetrated between the front and rear wing of the 42nd Regiment of Foot. A confused fight ensued in the ruins, in which the French troops were all either killed or captured with the 42nd taking their colour. Other British regiments engaged were the 23rd Regiment of Foot, 40th (the 2nd Somersetshire) Regiment of Foot and 58th (Rutlandshire) Regiment of Foot, together with Stuart's Minorca Regiment.\nThe front and rear ranks of the 28th Foot were simultaneously engaged to both their front and rear. During the attack of Roize's second line, Abercromby was briefly captured by French dragoons, but quickly rescued by a highlander of the 42nd. About this time he received a bullet wound to the thigh which would eventually prove fatal, though he remained on the field and in command to the end. Rampon's renewed infantry attack on the centre was repulsed by the Guards brigade, supported by Coote's brigade, and the left wing maintained its position with ease, but the French cavalry for the second time came to close quarters with the reserve. The 42nd, twice charged by cavalry, had but 13 men wounded by the sabre. Part of the French losses were caused by the gunboats which lay close inshore and cannonaded the left flank of the French columns, and by a heavy naval gun which was placed in battery near the position of 28 March. The battle was won and was a great victory, with Menou forced to retreat to the city of Alexandria. On 17 August, British forces laid siege to Alexandria and later captured the city which effectively ended French control of Egypt and Syria.\nDeath.\nDuring the action of the battle Abercromby was struck by a musket-ball in the thigh; but not until the battle had been won and he saw the enemy retreating did he allow himself to be relieved of command so he could receive medical aid. He was eventually borne from the field in a hammock, cheered by the blessings of the soldiers as he passed, and conveyed on board the flag-ship HMS \"Foudroyant\" which was moored in the harbour. The ball could not be extracted; mortification ensued, and seven days later, on 28 March 1801, he died.\nAbercromby's old friend and commander, the Duke of York, paid tribute to Abercromby's memory in general orders:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"His steady observance of discipline, his ever-watchful attention to the health and wants of his troops, the persevering and unconquerable spirit which marked his military career, the splendour of his actions in the field and the heroism of his death, are worthy the imitation of all who desire, like him, a life of heroism and a death of glory.\"\u2014\u200a\nHe was buried on St John's Bastion within Fort Saint Elmo in Valletta, Malta. The British military renamed it \"Abercrombie's Bastion\" in his honour. The adjacent curtain wall linking this bastion to the fortifications of Valletta, originally called Santa Ubaldesca Curtain, was also renamed \"Abercrombie's Curtain\".\nRecognition.\nBy a vote of the House of Commons, a monument was erected in Abercromby's honour in St Paul's Cathedral in London. His widow was created Baroness Abercromby of Tullibody and Aboukir Bay, and a pension of \u00a32,000 a year was settled on her and her two successors in the title.\nAbercromby Place in Edinburgh's New Town and Abercromby Square in Liverpool are named in his honour.\nFamily.\nOn 17 November 1767, Abercromby married Mary Anne, daughter of John Menzies and Ann, daughter of Patrick Campbell. They had seven children. Of four sons, all four entered Parliament, and two saw military service.\nPopular culture.\nNumerous works have been written about Abercromby. A public house in central Manchester, the \"Sir Ralph Abercromby\", is named after him. There is also a primary school and pub in Tullibody. There is also another 'General Abercrombie' pub with his portrait by John Hoppner as the sign off of the Blackfriars Bridge Road in London.\nThree ships have been named HMS \"Abercrombie\" after the general but using the variant spelling of his name.\nThe ballad song \"The Banks of the Nile\", perhaps most notably recorded by Sandy Denny and Fotheringay, refers to Sir Ralph Abercrombie's campaign in Egypt.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The method compares the abundance of a naturally occurring radioactive isotope within the material to the abundance of its decay products, which form at a known constant rate of decay. Radiometric dating of minerals and rocks was pioneered by Ernest Rutherford (1906) and Bertram Boltwood (1907). Radiometric dating is now the principal source of information about the absolute age of rocks and other geological features, including the age of fossilized life forms or the age of Earth itself, and can also be used to date a wide range of natural and man-made materials.\nTogether with stratigraphic principles, radiometric dating methods are used in geochronology to establish the geologic time scale. Among the best-known techniques are radiocarbon dating, potassium\u2013argon dating and uranium\u2013lead dating. By allowing the establishment of geological timescales, it provides a significant source of information about the ages of fossils and the deduced rates of evolutionary change. Radiometric dating is also used to date archaeological materials, including ancient artifacts.\nDifferent methods of radiometric dating vary in the timescale over which they are accurate and the materials to which they can be applied.\nFundamentals.\nRadioactive decay.\nAll ordinary matter is made up of combinations of chemical elements, each with its own atomic number, indicating the number of protons in the atomic nucleus. Additionally, elements may exist in different isotopes, with each isotope of an element differing in the number of neutrons in the nucleus. A particular isotope of a particular element is called a nuclide. Some nuclides are inherently unstable. That is, at some point in time, an atom of such a nuclide will undergo radioactive decay and spontaneously transform into a different nuclide. This transformation may be accomplished in a number of different ways, including alpha decay (emission of alpha particles) and beta decay (electron emission, positron emission, or electron capture). Another possibility is spontaneous fission into two or more nuclides.\nWhile the moment in time at which a particular nucleus decays is unpredictable, a collection of atoms of a radioactive nuclide decays exponentially at a rate described by a parameter known as the half-life, usually given in units of years when discussing dating techniques. After one half-life has elapsed, one half of the atoms of the nuclide in question will have decayed into a \"daughter\" nuclide or decay product. In many cases, the daughter nuclide itself is radioactive, resulting in a decay chain, eventually ending with the formation of a stable (nonradioactive) daughter nuclide; each step in such a chain is characterized by a distinct half-life. In these cases, usually the half-life of interest in radiometric dating is the longest one in the chain, which is the rate-limiting factor in the ultimate transformation of the radioactive nuclide into its stable daughter. Isotopic systems that have been exploited for radiometric dating have half-lives ranging from only about 10 years (e.g., tritium) to over 100 billion years (e.g., samarium-147).\nFor most radioactive nuclides, the half-life depends solely on nuclear properties and is essentially constant. This is known because decay constants measured by different techniques give consistent values within analytical errors and the ages of the same materials are consistent from one method to another. It is not affected by external factors such as temperature, pressure, chemical environment, or presence of a magnetic or electric field. The only exceptions are nuclides that decay by the process of electron capture, such as beryllium-7, strontium-85, and zirconium-89, whose decay rate may be affected by local electron density. For all other nuclides, the proportion of the original nuclide to its decay products changes in a predictable way as the original nuclide decays over time. This predictability allows the relative abundances of related nuclides to be used as a clock to measure the time from the incorporation of the original nuclides into a material to the present.\nDecay constant determination.\nThe radioactive decay constant, the probability that an atom will decay per year, is the solid foundation of the common measurement of radioactivity. The accuracy and precision of the determination of an age (and a nuclide's half-life) depends on the accuracy and precision of the decay constant measurement. The in-growth method is one way of measuring the decay constant of a system, which involves accumulating daughter nuclides. Unfortunately for nuclides with high decay constants (which are useful for dating very old samples), long periods of time (decades) are required to accumulate enough decay products in a single sample to accurately measure them. A faster method involves using particle counters to determine alpha, beta or gamma activity, and then dividing that by the number of radioactive nuclides. However, it is challenging and expensive to accurately determine the number of radioactive nuclides. Alternatively, decay constants can be determined by comparing isotope data for rocks of known age. This method requires at least one of the isotope systems to be very precisely calibrated, such as the Pb\u2013Pb system.\nAccuracy of radiometric dating.\nThe basic equation of radiometric dating requires that neither the parent nuclide nor the daughter product can enter or leave the material after its formation. The possible confounding effects of contamination of parent and daughter isotopes have to be considered, as do the effects of any loss or gain of such isotopes since the sample was created. It is therefore essential to have as much information as possible about the material being dated and to check for possible signs of alteration. Precision is enhanced if measurements are taken on multiple samples from different locations of the rock body. Alternatively, if several different minerals can be dated from the same sample and are assumed to be formed by the same event and were in equilibrium with the reservoir when they formed, they should form an isochron. This can reduce the problem of contamination. In uranium\u2013lead dating, the concordia diagram is used which also decreases the problem of nuclide loss. Finally, correlation between different isotopic dating methods may be required to confirm the age of a sample. For example, the age of the Amitsoq gneisses from western Greenland was determined to be 3.60 \u00b1 0.05 Ga (billion years ago) using uranium\u2013lead dating and 3.56 \u00b1 0.10 Ga (billion years ago) using lead\u2013lead dating, results that are consistent with each other.\nAccurate radiometric dating generally requires that the parent has a long enough half-life that it will be present in significant amounts at the time of measurement (except as described below under \"Dating with short-lived extinct radionuclides\"), the half-life of the parent is accurately known, and enough of the daughter product is produced to be accurately measured and distinguished from the initial amount of the daughter present in the material. The procedures used to isolate and analyze the parent and daughter nuclides must be precise and accurate. This normally involves isotope-ratio mass spectrometry.\nThe precision of a dating method depends in part on the half-life of the radioactive isotope involved. For instance, carbon-14 has a half-life of 5,730 years. After an organism has been dead for 60,000 years, so little carbon-14 is left that accurate dating cannot be established. On the other hand, the concentration of carbon-14 falls off so steeply that the age of relatively young remains can be determined precisely to within a few decades.\nClosure temperature.\nThe closure temperature or blocking temperature represents the temperature below which the mineral is a closed system for the studied isotopes. If a material that selectively rejects the daughter nuclide is heated above this temperature, any daughter nuclides that have been accumulated over time will be lost through diffusion, resetting the isotopic \"clock\" to zero. As the mineral cools, the crystal structure begins to form and diffusion of isotopes is less easy. At a certain temperature, the crystal structure has formed sufficiently to prevent diffusion of isotopes. Thus an igneous or metamorphic rock or melt, which is slowly cooling, does not begin to exhibit measurable radioactive decay until it cools below the closure temperature. The age that can be calculated by radiometric dating is thus the time at which the rock or mineral cooled to closure temperature. This temperature varies for every mineral and isotopic system, so a system can be closed for one mineral but open for another. Dating of different minerals and/or isotope systems (with differing closure temperatures) within the same rock can therefore enable the tracking of the thermal history of the rock in question with time, and thus the history of metamorphic events may become known in detail. These temperatures are experimentally determined in the lab by artificially resetting sample minerals using a high-temperature furnace. This field is known as thermochronology or thermochronometry.\nThe age equation.\nThe mathematical expression that relates radioactive decay to geologic time is\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;\nwhere\nThe equation is most conveniently expressed in terms of the measured quantity \"N\"(\"t\") rather than the constant initial value \"No\".\nTo calculate the age, it is assumed that the system is closed (neither parent nor daughter isotopes have been lost from system), \"D\"0 either must be negligible or can be accurately estimated, \"\u03bb\" is known to high precision, and one has accurate and precise measurements of D* and \"N\"(\"t\").\nThe above equation makes use of information on the composition of parent and daughter isotopes at the time the material being tested cooled below its closure temperature. This is well established for most isotopic systems. However, construction of an isochron does not require information on the original compositions, using merely the present ratios of the parent and daughter isotopes to a standard isotope. An isochron plot is used to solve the age equation graphically and calculate the age of the sample and the original composition.\nModern dating methods.\nRadiometric dating has been carried out since 1905 when it was invented by Ernest Rutherford as a method by which one might determine the age of the Earth. In the century since then the techniques have been greatly improved and expanded. Dating can now be performed on samples as small as a nanogram using a mass spectrometer. The mass spectrometer was invented in the 1940s and began to be used in radiometric dating in the 1950s. It operates by generating a beam of ionized atoms from the sample under test. The ions then travel through a magnetic field, which diverts them into different sampling sensors, known as \"Faraday cups,\" depending on their mass and level of ionization. On impact in the cups, the ions set up a very weak current that can be measured to determine the rate of impacts and the relative concentrations of different atoms in the beams.\nUranium\u2013lead dating method.\nUranium\u2013lead radiometric dating involves using uranium-235 or uranium-238 to date a substance's absolute age. This scheme has been refined to the point that the error margin in dates of rocks can be as low as less than two million years in two-and-a-half billion years. An error margin of 2\u20135% has been achieved on younger Mesozoic rocks.\nUranium\u2013lead dating is often performed on the mineral zircon (ZrSiO4), though it can be used on other materials, such as baddeleyite and monazite (see: monazite geochronology). Zircon and baddeleyite incorporate uranium atoms into their crystalline structure as substitutes for zirconium, but strongly reject lead. Zircon has a very high closure temperature, is resistant to mechanical weathering and is very chemically inert. Zircon also forms multiple crystal layers during metamorphic events, which each may record an isotopic age of the event. \"In situ\" micro-beam analysis can be achieved via laser ICP-MS or SIMS techniques.\nOne of its great advantages is that any sample provides two clocks, one based on uranium-235's decay to lead-207 with a half-life of about 700 million years, and one based on uranium-238's decay to lead-206 with a half-life of about 4.5 billion years, providing a built-in crosscheck that allows accurate determination of the age of the sample even if some of the lead has been lost. This can be seen in the concordia diagram, where the samples plot along an errorchron (straight line) which intersects the concordia curve at the age of the sample.\nSamarium\u2013neodymium dating method.\nThis involves the alpha decay of 147Sm to 143Nd with a half-life of 1.06 x 1011 years. Accuracy levels of within twenty million years in ages of two-and-a-half billion years are achievable.\nPotassium\u2013argon dating method.\nThis involves electron capture or positron decay of potassium-40 to argon-40. Potassium-40 has a half-life of 1.3 billion years, so this method is applicable to the oldest rocks. Radioactive potassium-40 is common in micas, feldspars, and hornblendes, though the closure temperature is fairly low in these materials, about 350\u00a0\u00b0C (mica) to 500\u00a0\u00b0C (hornblende).\nRubidium\u2013strontium dating method.\nThis is based on the beta decay of rubidium-87 to strontium-87, with a half-life of 50 billion years. This scheme is used to date old igneous and metamorphic rocks, and has also been used to date lunar samples. Closure temperatures are so high that they are not a concern. Rubidium-strontium dating is not as precise as the uranium\u2013lead method, with errors of 30 to 50 million years for a 3-billion-year-old sample. Application of in situ analysis (Laser-Ablation ICP-MS) within single mineral grains in faults have shown that the Rb-Sr method can be used to decipher episodes of fault movement.\nUranium\u2013thorium dating method.\nA relatively short-range dating technique is based on the decay of uranium-234 into thorium-230, a substance with a half-life of about 80,000 years. It is accompanied by a sister process, in which uranium-235 decays into protactinium-231, which has a half-life of 32,760 years.\nWhile uranium is water-soluble, thorium and protactinium are not, and so they are selectively precipitated into ocean-floor sediments, from which their ratios are measured. The scheme has a range of several hundred thousand years. A related method is ionium\u2013thorium dating, which measures the ratio of ionium (thorium-230) to thorium-232 in ocean sediment.\nRadiocarbon dating method.\n Radiocarbon dating is also simply called carbon-14 dating. Carbon-14 is a radioactive isotope of carbon, with a half-life of 5,730 years (which is very short compared with the above isotopes), and decays into nitrogen. In other radiometric dating methods, the heavy parent isotopes were produced by nucleosynthesis in supernovas, meaning that any parent isotope with a short half-life should be extinct by now. Carbon-14, though, is continuously created through collisions of neutrons generated by cosmic rays with nitrogen in the upper atmosphere and thus remains at a near-constant level on Earth. The carbon-14 ends up as a trace component in atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2).\nA carbon-based life form acquires carbon during its lifetime. Plants acquire it through photosynthesis, and animals acquire it from consumption of plants and other animals. When an organism dies, it ceases to take in new carbon-14, and the existing isotope decays with a characteristic half-life (5730 years). The proportion of carbon-14 left when the remains of the organism are examined provides an indication of the time elapsed since its death. This makes carbon-14 an ideal dating method to date the age of bones or the remains of an organism. The carbon-14 dating limit lies around 58,000 to 62,000 years.\nThe rate of creation of carbon-14 appears to be roughly constant, as cross-checks of carbon-14 dating with other dating methods show it gives consistent results. However, local eruptions of volcanoes or other events that give off large amounts of carbon dioxide can reduce local concentrations of carbon-14 and give inaccurate dates. The releases of carbon dioxide into the biosphere as a consequence of industrialization have also depressed the proportion of carbon-14 by a few percent; in contrast, the amount of carbon-14 was increased by above-ground nuclear bomb tests that were conducted into the early 1960s. Also, an increase in the solar wind or the Earth's magnetic field above the current value would depress the amount of carbon-14 created in the atmosphere.\nFission track dating method.\nThis involves inspection of a polished slice of a material to determine the density of \"track\" markings left in it by the spontaneous fission of uranium-238 impurities. The uranium content of the sample has to be known, but that can be determined by placing a plastic film over the polished slice of the material, and bombarding it with slow neutrons. This causes induced fission of 235U, as opposed to the spontaneous fission of 238U. The fission tracks produced by this process are recorded in the plastic film. The uranium content of the material can then be calculated from the number of tracks and the neutron flux.\nThis scheme has application over a wide range of geologic dates. For dates up to a few million years micas, tektites (glass fragments from volcanic eruptions), and meteorites are best used. Older materials can be dated using zircon, apatite, titanite, epidote and garnet which have a variable amount of uranium content. Because the fission tracks are healed by temperatures over about 200\u00a0\u00b0C the technique has limitations as well as benefits. The technique has potential applications for detailing the thermal history of a deposit.\nChlorine-36 dating method.\nLarge amounts of otherwise rare 36Cl (half-life ~300ky) were produced by irradiation of seawater during atmospheric detonations of nuclear weapons between 1952 and 1958. The residence time of 36Cl in the atmosphere is about 1 week. Thus, as an event marker of 1950s water in soil and ground water, 36Cl is also useful for dating waters less than 50 years before the present. 36Cl has seen use in other areas of the geological sciences, including dating ice and sediments.\nLuminescence dating methods.\nLuminescence dating methods are not radiometric dating methods in that they do not rely on abundances of isotopes to calculate age. Instead, they are a consequence of background radiation on certain minerals. Over time, ionizing radiation is absorbed by mineral grains in sediments and archaeological materials such as quartz and potassium feldspar. The radiation causes charge to remain within the grains in structurally unstable \"electron traps\". Exposure to sunlight or heat releases these charges, effectively \"bleaching\" the sample and resetting the clock to zero. The trapped charge accumulates over time at a rate determined by the amount of background radiation at the location where the sample was buried. Stimulating these mineral grains using either light (optically stimulated luminescence or infrared stimulated luminescence dating) or heat (thermoluminescence dating) causes a luminescence signal to be emitted as the stored unstable electron energy is released, the intensity of which varies depending on the amount of radiation absorbed during burial and specific properties of the mineral.\nThese methods can be used to date the age of a sediment layer, as layers deposited on top would prevent the grains from being \"bleached\" and reset by sunlight. Pottery shards can be dated to the last time they experienced significant heat, generally when they were fired in a kiln.\nOther methods.\nOther methods include:\nDating with decay products of short-lived extinct radionuclides.\nAbsolute radiometric dating requires a measurable fraction of parent nucleus to remain in the sample rock. For rocks dating back to the beginning of the Solar System, this requires extremely long-lived parent isotopes, making measurement of such rocks' exact ages imprecise. To be able to distinguish the relative ages of rocks from such old material, and to get a better time resolution than that available from long-lived isotopes, short-lived isotopes that are no longer present in the rock can be used.\nAt the beginning of the solar system, there were several relatively short-lived radionuclides like 26Al, 60Fe, 53Mn, and 129I present within the solar nebula. These radionuclides\u2014possibly produced by the explosion of a supernova\u2014are extinct today, but their decay products can be detected in very old material, such as that which constitutes meteorites. By measuring the decay products of extinct radionuclides with a mass spectrometer and using isochronplots, it is possible to determine relative ages of different events in the early history of the solar system. Dating methods based on extinct radionuclides can also be calibrated with the U\u2013Pb method to give absolute ages. Thus both the approximate age and a high time resolution can be obtained. Generally a shorter half-life leads to a higher time resolution at the expense of timescale.\nThe 129I \u2013 129Xe chronometer.\nI beta-decays to Xe with a half-life of . The iodine-xenon chronometer is an isochron technique. Samples are exposed to neutrons in a nuclear reactor. This converts the only stable isotope of iodine (I) into Xe via neutron capture followed by beta decay (of I). After irradiation, samples are heated in a series of steps and the xenon isotopic signature of the gas evolved in each step is analysed. When a consistent Xe/Xe ratio is observed across several consecutive temperature steps, it can be interpreted as corresponding to a time at which the sample stopped losing xenon.\nSamples of a meteorite called Shallowater are usually included in the irradiation to monitor the conversion efficiency from I to Xe. The difference between the measured Xe/Xe ratios of the sample and Shallowater then corresponds to the different ratios of I/I when they each stopped losing xenon. This in turn corresponds to a difference in age of closure in the early solar system.\nThe 26Al \u2013 26Mg chronometer.\nAnother example of short-lived extinct radionuclide dating is the [&lt;noinclude /&gt;[aluminium-26|Al]&lt;noinclude /&gt;] \u2013 Mg chronometer, which can be used to estimate the relative ages of chondrules. Al decays to Mg with a half-life of 720 000 years. The dating is simply a question of finding the deviation from the natural abundance of Mg (the product of Al decay) in comparison with the ratio of the stable isotopes Al/Mg.\nThe excess of Mg (often designated Mg*) is found by comparing the Mg/Mg ratio to that of other Solar System materials.\nThe Al \u2013 Mg chronometer gives an estimate of the time period for formation of primitive meteorites of only a few million years (1.4 million years for Chondrule formation).\nA terminology issue.\nIn a July 2022 paper in the journal \"Applied Geochemistry\", the authors proposed that the terms \"parent isotope\" and \"daughter isotope\" be avoided in favor of the more descriptive \"precursor isotope\" and \"product isotope\", analogous to \"precursor ion\" and \"product ion\" in mass spectrometry.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

A rocket engine produces thrust by reaction to exhaust expelled at high speed. Unlike jet engines, rockets are fuelled entirely by propellant which they carry, without the need for oxygen from air; consequently a rocket can fly in the vacuum of space. Rockets suffer deceleration by atmospheric drag in air, and operate more efficiently outside the atmosphere.\nMultistage rockets are capable of attaining escape velocity from Earth and therefore can achieve unlimited maximum altitude. Compared with airbreathing engines, rockets are lightweight and powerful and capable of generating large accelerations. To control their flight, rockets may use momentum, airfoils, auxiliary reaction engines, gimballed thrust, momentum wheels, deflection of the exhaust stream, propellant flow, and spin, or may simply fly in a ballistic trajectory under the influence of gravity.\nRockets for military and recreational uses date back to at least 13th-century China. Significant scientific, interplanetary and industrial use did not occur until the 20th century, when rocketry was the enabling technology for the Space Age, including setting foot on the Moon. Rockets are now used for fireworks, missiles and other weaponry, ejection seats, launch vehicles for artificial satellites, human spaceflight, and space exploration.\nChemical rockets are the most common type of high power rocket, typically creating a high speed exhaust by the combustion of fuel with an oxidizer. The stored propellant can be a simple pressurized gas or a single liquid fuel that disassociates in the presence of a catalyst (monopropellant), two liquids that spontaneously react on contact (hypergolic propellants), two liquids that must be ignited to react (like kerosene (RP1) and liquid oxygen, used in most liquid-propellant rockets), a solid combination of fuel with oxidizer (solid fuel), or solid fuel with liquid or gaseous oxidizer (hybrid propellant system). Chemical rockets store a large amount of energy in an easily released form, and the consequences of accidents can be severe.\nThe term \"rocket\" is also used for small fireworks, which are the subject of article rocket (firework).\nHistory.\n Gunpowder-powered rockets evolved in medieval China under the Song dynasty by the 13th century. They also developed an early form of multiple rocket launcher during this time. The Mongols adopted Chinese rocket technology and the invention spread via the Mongol invasions to the Middle East and to Europe in the mid-13th century. According to Joseph Needham, the Song navy used rockets in a military exercise dated to 1245. Internal-combustion rocket propulsion is mentioned in a reference to 1264, recording that the \"ground-rat\", a type of firework, had frightened the Empress-Mother Gongsheng at a feast held in her honor by her son the Emperor Lizong. Subsequently, rockets are included in the military treatise \"Huolongjing\", also known as the Fire Drake Manual, written by the Chinese artillery officer Jiao Yu in the mid-14th century. This text mentions the first known multistage rocket, the 'fire-dragon issuing from the water' (Huo long chu shui), thought to have been used by the Chinese navy. \nMedieval and early modern rockets were used militarily as incendiary weapons in sieges. Between 1270 and 1280, Hasan al-Rammah wrote \"al-furusiyyah wa al-manasib al-harbiyya\" (\"The Book of Military Horsemanship and Ingenious War Devices\"), which included 107 gunpowder recipes, 22 of them for rockets. In Europe, Roger Bacon mentioned firecrackers made in various parts of the world in the \"Opus Majus\" of 1267. Between 1280 and 1300, the Liber Ignium (\"Book of Fire\") gave instructions for constructing devices that are similar to firecrackers based on second-hand accounts. Konrad Kyeser described rockets in his military treatise \"Bellifortis\" around 1405. Giovanni Fontana, a Paduan engineer in 1420, created rocket-propelled animal figures.\nThe name \"rocket\" comes from the Italian \"rocchetta\", meaning \"bobbin\" or \"little spindle\", given due to the similarity in shape to the bobbin or spool used to hold the thread from a spinning wheel. Leonhard Fronsperger and Conrad Haas adopted the Italian term into German in the mid-16th century; \"rocket\" appears in English by the early 17th century. \"Artis Magnae Artilleriae pars prima\", an important early modern work on rocket artillery, by Casimir Siemienowicz, was first printed in Amsterdam in 1650.\nThe Mysorean rockets were the first successful iron-cased rockets, developed in the late 18th century in the Kingdom of Mysore (part of present-day India) under the rule of Hyder Ali. \nThe Congreve rocket was a British weapon designed and developed by Sir William Congreve in 1804. This rocket was based directly on the Mysorean rockets, used compressed powder and was fielded in the Napoleonic Wars. It was Congreve rockets to which Francis Scott Key was referring, when he wrote of the \"rockets' red glare\" while held captive on a British ship that was laying siege to Fort McHenry in 1814. Together, the Mysorean and British innovations increased the effective range of military rockets from .\nThe first mathematical treatment of the dynamics of rocket propulsion is due to William Moore (1813). In 1814, Congreve published a book in which he discussed the use of multiple rocket launching apparatus. In 1815 Alexander Dmitrievich Zasyadko constructed rocket-launching platforms, which allowed rockets to be fired in salvos (6 rockets at a time), and gun-laying devices. William Hale in 1844 greatly increased the accuracy of rocket artillery. Edward Mounier Boxer further improved the Congreve rocket in 1865.\nWilliam Leitch first proposed the concept of using rockets to enable human spaceflight in 1861. Leitch's rocket spaceflight description was first provided in his 1861 essay \"A Journey Through Space\". The essay was published in a journal in Edinburgh that year before being included in his book \"God's Glory in the Heavens\" (1862). Konstantin Tsiolkovsky later (in 1903) also conceived this idea, and extensively developed a body of theory that has provided the foundation for subsequent spaceflight development.\nThe British Royal Flying Corps designed a guided rocket during World War I. Archibald Low stated \"...in 1917 the Experimental Works designed an electrically steered rocket\u2026 Rocket experiments were conducted under my own patents with the help of Cdr. Brock.\" The patent \"Improvements in Rockets\" was raised in July 1918 but not published until February 1923 for security reasons. Firing and guidance controls could be either wire or wireless. The propulsion and guidance rocket eflux emerged from the deflecting cowl at the nose.\nIn 1920, Professor Robert Goddard of Clark University published proposed improvements to rocket technology in \"A Method of Reaching Extreme Altitudes\". In 1923, Hermann Oberth (1894\u20131989) published \"Die Rakete zu den Planetenr\u00e4umen\" (\"The Rocket into Planetary Space\"). Modern rockets originated in 1926 when Goddard attached a supersonic (de Laval) nozzle to a high pressure combustion chamber. These nozzles turn the hot gas from the combustion chamber into a cooler, hypersonic, highly directed jet of gas, more than doubling the thrust and raising the engine efficiency from 2% to 64%. His use of liquid propellants instead of gunpowder greatly lowered the weight and increased the effectiveness of rockets.\nIn 1921, the Soviet research and development laboratory Gas Dynamics Laboratory began developing solid-propellant rockets, which resulted in the first launch in 1928, which flew for approximately 1,300 metres. These rockets were used in 1931 for the world's first successful use of rockets for jet-assisted takeoff of aircraft and became the prototypes for the Katyusha rocket launcher, which were used during World War II.\nIn 1929, Fritz Lang's German science fiction film \"Woman in the Moon\" was released. It showcased the use of a multi-stage rocket, and also pioneered the concept of a rocket launch pad (a rocket standing upright against a tall building before launch having been slowly rolled into place) and the rocket-launch countdown clock. \"The Guardian\" film critic Stephen Armstrong states Lang \"created the rocket industry\". Lang was inspired by the 1923 book \"The Rocket into Interplanetary Space\" by Hermann Oberth, who became the film's scientific adviser and later an important figure in the team that developed the V-2 rocket. The film was thought to be so realistic that it was banned by the Nazis when they came to power for fear it would reveal secrets about the V-2 rockets.\nIn 1943 production of the V-2 rocket began in Germany. It was designed by the Peenem\u00fcnde Army Research Center with Wernher von Braun serving as the technical director. The V-2 became the first artificial object to travel into space by crossing the K\u00e1rm\u00e1n line with the vertical launch of MW 18014 on 20 June 1944. Doug Millard, space historian and curator of space technology at the Science Museum, London, where a V-2 is exhibited in the main exhibition hall, states: \"The V-2 was a quantum leap of technological change. We got to the Moon using V-2 technology but this was technology that was developed with massive resources, including some particularly grim ones. The V-2 programme was hugely expensive in terms of lives, with the Nazis using slave labour to manufacture these rockets\". In parallel with the German guided-missile programme, rockets were also used on aircraft, either for assisting horizontal take-off (RATO), vertical take-off (Bachem Ba 349 \"Natter\") or for powering them (Me 163, see list of World War II guided missiles of Germany). The Allies' rocket programs were less technological, relying mostly on unguided missiles like the Soviet Katyusha rocket in the artillery role, and the American anti tank bazooka projectile. These used solid chemical propellants.\nThe Americans captured a large number of German rocket scientists, including Wernher von Braun, in 1945, and brought them to the United States as part of Operation Paperclip. After World War II scientists used rockets to study high-altitude conditions, by radio telemetry of temperature and pressure of the atmosphere, detection of cosmic rays, and further techniques; note too the Bell X-1, the first crewed vehicle to break the sound barrier (1947). Independently, in the Soviet Union's space program research continued under the leadership of the chief designer Sergei Korolev (1907\u20131966).\nDuring the Cold War rockets became extremely important militarily with the development of modern intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs). The 1960s saw rapid development of rocket technology, particularly in the Soviet Union (Vostok, Soyuz, Proton) and in the United States (e.g. the X-15). Rockets came into use for space exploration. American crewed programs (Project Mercury, Project Gemini and later the Apollo programme) culminated in 1969 with the first crewed landing on the Moon \u2013 using equipment launched by the Saturn V rocket.\nTypes.\nRocket vehicles are often constructed in the archetypal tall thin \"rocket\" shape that takes off vertically, but there are actually many different types of rockets including:\nDesign.\nA rocket design can be as simple as a cardboard tube filled with black powder, but to make an efficient, accurate rocket or missile involves overcoming a number of difficult problems. The main difficulties include cooling the combustion chamber, pumping the fuel (in the case of a liquid fuel), and controlling and correcting the direction of motion.\nComponents.\nRockets consist of a propellant, a place to put propellant (such as a propellant tank), and a nozzle. They may also have one or more rocket engines, directional stabilization device(s) (such as fins, vernier engines or engine gimbals for thrust vectoring, gyroscopes) and a structure (typically monocoque) to hold these components together. Rockets intended for high speed atmospheric use also have an aerodynamic fairing such as a nose cone, which usually holds the payload.\nAs well as these components, rockets can have any number of other components, such as wings (rocketplanes), parachutes, wheels (rocket cars), even, in a sense, a person (rocket belt). Vehicles frequently possess navigation systems and guidance systems that typically use satellite navigation and inertial navigation systems.\nEngines.\nRocket engines employ the principle of jet propulsion. The rocket engines powering rockets come in a great variety of different types; a comprehensive list can be found in the main article, Rocket engine. Most current rockets are chemically powered rockets (usually internal combustion engines, but some employ a decomposing monopropellant) that emit a hot exhaust gas. A rocket engine can use gas propellants, solid propellant, liquid propellant, or a hybrid mixture of both solid and liquid. Some rockets use heat or pressure that is supplied from a source other than the chemical reaction of propellant(s), such as steam rockets, solar thermal rockets, nuclear thermal rocket engines or simple pressurized rockets such as water rocket or cold gas thrusters. With combustive propellants a chemical reaction is initiated between the fuel and the oxidizer in the combustion chamber, and the resultant hot gases accelerate out of a rocket engine nozzle (or nozzles) at the rearward-facing end of the rocket. The acceleration of these gases through the engine exerts force (\"thrust\") on the combustion chamber and nozzle, propelling the vehicle (according to Newton's third law). This actually happens because the force (pressure times area) on the combustion chamber wall is unbalanced by the nozzle opening; this is not the case in any other direction. The shape of the nozzle also generates force by directing the exhaust gas along the axis of the rocket.\nPropellant.\nRocket propellant is mass that is stored, usually in some form of propellant tank or casing, prior to being used as the propulsive mass that is ejected from a rocket engine in the form of a fluid jet to produce thrust. For chemical rockets often the propellants are a fuel such as liquid hydrogen or kerosene burned with an oxidizer such as liquid oxygen or nitric acid to produce large volumes of very hot gas. The oxidiser is either kept separate and mixed in the combustion chamber, or comes premixed, as with solid rockets.\nSometimes the propellant is not burned but still undergoes a chemical reaction, and can be a 'monopropellant' such as hydrazine, nitrous oxide or hydrogen peroxide that can be catalytically decomposed to hot gas.\nAlternatively, an inert propellant can be used that can be externally heated, such as in steam rocket, solar thermal rocket or nuclear thermal rockets.\nFor smaller, low performance rockets such as attitude control thrusters where high performance is less necessary, a pressurised fluid is used as propellant that simply escapes the spacecraft through a propelling nozzle.\nPendulum rocket fallacy.\nThe first liquid-fuel rocket, constructed by Robert H. Goddard, differed significantly from modern rockets. The rocket engine was at the top and the fuel tank at the bottom of the rocket, based on Goddard's belief that the rocket would achieve stability by \"hanging\" from the engine like a pendulum in flight. However, the rocket veered off course and crashed away from the launch site, indicating that the rocket was no more stable than one with the rocket engine at the base.\nUses.\nRockets or other similar reaction devices carrying their own propellant must be used when there is no other substance (land, water, or air) or force (gravity, magnetism, light) that a vehicle may usefully employ for propulsion, such as in space. In these circumstances, it is necessary to carry all the propellant to be used.\nHowever, they are also useful in other situations:\nMilitary.\nSome military weapons use rockets to propel warheads to their targets. A rocket and its payload together are generally referred to as a \"missile\" when the weapon has a guidance system (not all missiles use rocket engines, some use other engines such as jets) or as a \"rocket\" if it is unguided. Anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles use rocket engines to engage targets at high speed at a range of several miles, while intercontinental ballistic missiles can be used to deliver multiple nuclear warheads from thousands of miles, and anti-ballistic missiles try to stop them. Rockets have also been tested for reconnaissance, such as the Ping-Pong rocket, which was launched to surveil enemy targets, however, recon rockets have never come into wide use in the military.\nScience and research.\nSounding rockets are commonly used to carry instruments that take readings from to above the surface of the Earth.\nThe first images of Earth from space were obtained from a V-2 rocket in 1946 (flight #13).\nRocket engines are also used to propel rocket sleds along a rail at extremely high speed. The world record for this is Mach 8.5.\nSpaceflight.\nLarger rockets are normally launched from a launch pad that provides stable support until a few seconds after ignition. Due to their high exhaust velocity\u2014\u2014rockets are particularly useful when very high speeds are required, such as orbital speed at approximately . Spacecraft delivered into orbital trajectories become artificial satellites, which are used for many commercial purposes. Indeed, rockets remain the only way to launch spacecraft into orbit and beyond. They are also used to rapidly accelerate spacecraft when they change orbits or de-orbit for landing. Also, a rocket may be used to soften a hard parachute landing immediately before touchdown (see retrorocket).\nRescue.\nRockets were used to propel a line to a stricken ship so that a Breeches buoy can be used to rescue those on board. Rockets are also used to launch emergency flares.\nSome crewed rockets, notably the Saturn V and Soyuz, have launch escape systems. This is a small, usually solid rocket that is capable of pulling the crewed capsule away from the main vehicle towards safety at a moments notice. These types of systems have been operated several times, both in testing and in flight, and operated correctly each time.\nThis was the case when the Safety Assurance System (Soviet nomenclature) successfully pulled away the L3 capsule during three of the four failed launches of the Soviet Moon rocket, N1 vehicles 3L, 5L and 7L. In all three cases the capsule, albeit uncrewed, was saved from destruction. Only the three aforementioned N1 rockets had functional Safety Assurance Systems. The outstanding vehicle, 6L, had dummy upper stages and therefore no escape system giving the N1 booster a 100% success rate for egress from a failed launch.\nA successful escape of a crewed capsule occurred when Soyuz T-10, on a mission to the Salyut 7 space station, exploded on the pad.\nSolid rocket propelled ejection seats are used in many military aircraft to propel crew away to safety from a vehicle when flight control is lost.\nHobby, sport, and entertainment.\nA model rocket is a small rocket designed to reach low altitudes (e.g., for model) and be recovered by a variety of means.\nAccording to the United States National Association of Rocketry (nar) Safety Code, model rockets are constructed of paper, wood, plastic and other lightweight materials. The code also provides guidelines for motor use, launch site selection, launch methods, launcher placement, recovery system design and deployment and more. Since the early 1960s, a copy of the Model Rocket Safety Code has been provided with most model rocket kits and motors. Despite its inherent association with extremely flammable substances and objects with a pointed tip traveling at high speeds, model rocketry historically has proven to be a very safe hobby and has been credited as a significant source of inspiration for children who eventually become scientists and engineers.\nHobbyists build and fly a wide variety of model rockets. Many companies produce model rocket kits and parts but due to their inherent simplicity some hobbyists have been known to make rockets out of almost anything. Rockets are also used in some types of consumer and professional fireworks. A water rocket is a type of model rocket using water as its reaction mass. The pressure vessel (the engine of the rocket) is usually a used plastic soft drink bottle. The water is forced out by a pressurized gas, typically compressed air. It is an example of Newton's third law of motion.\nThe scale of amateur rocketry can range from a small rocket launched in one's own backyard to a rocket that reached space. Amateur rocketry is split into three categories according to total engine impulse: low-power, mid-power, and high-power.\nHydrogen peroxide rockets are used to power jet packs, and have been used to power cars and a rocket car holds the all time (albeit unofficial) drag racing record.\nCorpulent Stump is the most powerful non-commercial rocket ever launched on an Aerotech engine in the United Kingdom.\nFlight.\nLaunches for orbital spaceflights, or into interplanetary space, are usually from a fixed location on the ground, but would also be possible from an aircraft or ship.\nRocket launch technologies include the entire set of systems needed to successfully launch a vehicle, not just the vehicle itself, but also the firing control systems, mission control center, launch pad, ground stations, and tracking stations needed for a successful launch or recovery or both. These are often collectively referred to as the \"ground segment\".\nOrbital launch vehicles commonly take off vertically, and then begin to progressively lean over, usually following a gravity turn trajectory.\nOnce above the majority of the atmosphere, the vehicle then angles the rocket jet, pointing it largely horizontally but somewhat downwards, which permits the vehicle to gain and then maintain altitude while increasing horizontal speed. As the speed grows, the vehicle will become more and more horizontal until at orbital speed, the engine will cut off.\nAll current vehicles \"stage\", that is, jettison hardware on the way to orbit. Although vehicles have been proposed which would be able to reach orbit without staging, none have ever been constructed, and, if powered only by rockets, the exponentially increasing fuel requirements of such a vehicle would make its useful payload tiny or nonexistent. Most current and historical launch vehicles \"expend\" their jettisoned hardware, typically by allowing it to crash into the ocean, but some have recovered and reused jettisoned hardware, either by parachute or by propulsive landing.\nWhen launching a spacecraft to orbit, a \"&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;dogleg\" is a guided, powered turn during ascent phase that causes a rocket's flight path to deviate from a \"straight\" path. A dogleg is necessary if the desired launch azimuth, to reach a desired orbital inclination, would take the ground track over land (or over a populated area, e.g. Russia usually does launch over land, but over unpopulated areas), or if the rocket is trying to reach an orbital plane that does not reach the latitude of the launch site. Doglegs are undesirable due to extra onboard fuel required, causing heavier load, and a reduction of vehicle performance.\nNoise.\nRocket exhaust generates a significant amount of acoustic energy. As the supersonic exhaust collides with the ambient air, shock waves are formed. The sound intensity from these shock waves depends on the size of the rocket as well as the exhaust velocity. The sound intensity of large, high performance rockets could potentially kill at close range.\nThe Space Shuttle generated 180\u00a0dB of noise around its base. To combat this, NASA developed a sound suppression system which can flow water at rates up to 900,000 gallons per minute (57\u00a0m3/s) onto the launch pad. The water reduces the noise level from 180\u00a0dB down to 142\u00a0dB (the design requirement is 145\u00a0dB). Without the sound suppression system, acoustic waves would reflect off of the launch pad towards the rocket, vibrating the sensitive payload and crew. These acoustic waves can be so severe as to damage or destroy the rocket.\nNoise is generally most intense when a rocket is close to the ground, since the noise from the engines radiates up away from the jet, as well as reflecting off the ground. This noise can be reduced somewhat by flame trenches with roofs, by water injection around the jet and by deflecting the jet at an angle.\nFor crewed rockets various methods are used to reduce the sound intensity for the passengers, and typically the placement of the astronauts far away from the rocket engines helps significantly. For the passengers and crew, when a vehicle goes supersonic the sound cuts off as the sound waves are no longer able to keep up with the vehicle.\nPhysics.\nOperation.\nThe effect of the combustion of propellant in the rocket engine is to increase the internal energy of the resulting gases, utilizing the stored chemical energy in the fuel. As the internal energy increases, pressure increases, and a nozzle is used to convert this energy into a directed kinetic energy. This produces thrust against the ambient environment to which these gases are released. The ideal direction of motion of the exhaust is in the direction so as to cause thrust. At the top end of the combustion chamber the hot, energetic gas fluid cannot move forward, and so, it pushes upward against the top of the rocket engine's combustion chamber. As the combustion gases approach the exit of the combustion chamber, they increase in speed. The effect of the convergent part of the rocket engine nozzle on the high pressure fluid of combustion gases, is to cause the gases to accelerate to high speed. The higher the speed of the gases, the lower the pressure of the gas (Bernoulli's principle or conservation of energy) acting on that part of the combustion chamber. In a properly designed engine, the flow will reach Mach 1 at the throat of the nozzle. At which point the speed of the flow increases. Beyond the throat of the nozzle, a bell shaped expansion part of the engine allows the gases that are expanding to push against that part of the rocket engine. Thus, the bell part of the nozzle gives additional thrust. Simply expressed, for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction, according to Newton's third law with the result that the exiting gases produce the reaction of a force on the rocket causing it to accelerate the rocket.\nIn a closed chamber, the pressures are equal in each direction and no acceleration occurs. If an opening is provided in the bottom of the chamber then the pressure is no longer acting on the missing section. This opening permits the exhaust to escape. The remaining pressures give a resultant thrust on the side opposite the opening, and these pressures are what push the rocket along.\nThe shape of the nozzle is important. Consider a balloon propelled by air coming out of a tapering nozzle. In such a case the combination of air pressure and viscous friction is such that the nozzle does not push the balloon but is \"pulled\" by it. Using a convergent/divergent nozzle gives more force since the exhaust also presses on it as it expands outwards, roughly doubling the total force. If propellant gas is continuously added to the chamber then these pressures can be maintained for as long as propellant remains. Note that in the case of liquid propellant engines, the pumps moving the propellant into the combustion chamber must maintain a pressure larger than the combustion chamber\u2014typically on the order of 100 atmospheres.\nAs a side effect, these pressures on the rocket also act on the exhaust in the opposite direction and accelerate this exhaust to very high speeds (according to Newton's third law). From the principle of conservation of momentum the speed of the exhaust of a rocket determines how much momentum increase is created for a given amount of propellant. This is called the rocket's \"specific impulse\". Because a rocket, propellant and exhaust in flight, without any external perturbations, may be considered as a closed system, the total momentum is always constant. Therefore, the faster the net speed of the exhaust in one direction, the greater the speed of the rocket can achieve in the opposite direction. This is especially true since the rocket body's mass is typically far lower than the final total exhaust mass.\nForces on a rocket in flight.\nThe general study of the forces on a rocket is part of the field of ballistics. Spacecraft are further studied in the subfield of astrodynamics.\nFlying rockets are primarily affected by the following:\nIn addition, the inertia and centrifugal pseudo-force can be significant due to the path of the rocket around the center of a celestial body; when high enough speeds in the right direction and altitude are achieved a stable orbit or escape velocity is obtained.\nThese forces, with a stabilizing tail (the \"empennage\") present will, unless deliberate control efforts are made, naturally cause the vehicle to follow a roughly parabolic trajectory termed a gravity turn, and this trajectory is often used at least during the initial part of a launch. (This is true even if the rocket engine is mounted at the nose.) Vehicles can thus maintain low or even zero angle of attack, which minimizes transverse stress on the launch vehicle, permitting a weaker, and hence lighter, launch vehicle.\nDrag.\nDrag is a force opposite to the direction of the rocket's motion relative to any air it is moving through. This slows the speed of the vehicle and produces structural loads. The deceleration forces for fast-moving rockets are calculated using the drag equation.\nDrag can be minimised by an aerodynamic nose cone and by using a shape with a high ballistic coefficient (the \"classic\" rocket shape\u2014long and thin), and by keeping the rocket's angle of attack as low as possible.\nDuring a launch, as the vehicle speed increases, and the atmosphere thins, there is a point of maximum aerodynamic drag called max Q. This determines the minimum aerodynamic strength of the vehicle, as the rocket must avoid buckling under these forces.\nNet thrust.\nA typical rocket engine can handle a significant fraction of its own mass in propellant each second, with the propellant leaving the nozzle at several kilometres per second. This means that the thrust-to-weight ratio of a rocket engine, and often the entire vehicle can be very high, in extreme cases over 100. This compares with other jet propulsion engines that can exceed 5 for some of the better engines.\nThe net thrust of a rocket is\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;\nwhere\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;\nThe effective exhaust velocity formula_1 is more or less the speed the exhaust leaves the vehicle, and in the vacuum of space, the effective exhaust velocity is often equal to the actual average exhaust speed along the thrust axis. However, the effective exhaust velocity allows for various losses, and notably, is reduced when operated within an atmosphere.\nThe rate of propellant flow through a rocket engine is often deliberately varied over a flight, to provide a way to control the thrust and thus the airspeed of the vehicle. This, for example, allows minimization of aerodynamic losses and can limit the increase of \"g\"-forces due to the reduction in propellant load.\nTotal impulse.\nImpulse is defined as a force acting on an object over time, which in the absence of opposing forces (gravity and aerodynamic drag), changes the momentum (integral of mass and velocity) of the object. As such, it is the best performance class (payload mass and terminal velocity capability) indicator of a rocket, rather than takeoff thrust, mass, or \"power\". The total impulse of a rocket (stage) burning its propellant is:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;\nWhen there is fixed thrust, this is simply:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;\nThe total impulse of a multi-stage rocket is the sum of the impulses of the individual stages.\nSpecific impulse.\nAs can be seen from the thrust equation, the effective speed of the exhaust controls the amount of thrust produced from a particular quantity of fuel burnt per second.\nAn equivalent measure, the net impulse per weight unit of propellant expelled, is called specific Impulse, formula_2, and this is one of the most important figures that describes a rocket's performance. It is defined such that it is related to the effective exhaust velocity by:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;\nwhere:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;formula_2 has units of seconds\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;formula_4 is the acceleration at the surface of the Earth\nThus, the greater the specific impulse, the greater the net thrust and performance of the engine. formula_2 is determined by measurement while testing the engine. In practice the effective exhaust velocities of rockets varies but can be extremely high, ~4500\u00a0m/s, about 15 times the sea level speed of sound in air.\nDelta-v (rocket equation).\nThe delta-v capacity of a rocket is the theoretical total change in velocity that a rocket can achieve without any external interference (without air drag or gravity or other forces).\nWhen formula_6 is constant, the delta-v that a rocket vehicle can provide can be calculated from the Tsiolkovsky rocket equation:\nformula_7\nwhere:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;formula_8 is the initial total mass, including propellant, in kg (or lb)\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;formula_9 is the final total mass in kg (or lb)\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;formula_6 is the effective exhaust velocity in m/s (or ft/s)\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;formula_11 is the delta-v in m/s (or ft/s)\nWhen launched from the Earth practical delta-vs for a single rockets carrying payloads can be a few km/s. Some theoretical designs have rockets with delta-vs over 9\u00a0km/s.\nThe required delta-v can also be calculated for a particular manoeuvre; for example the delta-v to launch from the surface of the Earth to low Earth orbit is about 9.7\u00a0km/s, which leaves the vehicle with a sideways speed of about 7.8\u00a0km/s at an altitude of around 200\u00a0km. In this manoeuvre about 1.9\u00a0km/s is lost in air drag, gravity drag and gaining altitude.\nThe ratio formula_12 is sometimes called the \"mass ratio\".\nMass ratios.\nAlmost all of a launch vehicle's mass consists of propellant. Mass ratio is, for any 'burn', the ratio between the rocket's initial mass and its final mass. Everything else being equal, a high mass ratio is desirable for good performance, since it indicates that the rocket is lightweight and hence performs better, for essentially the same reasons that low weight is desirable in sports cars.\nRockets as a group have the highest thrust-to-weight ratio of any type of engine; and this helps vehicles achieve high mass ratios, which improves the performance of flights. The higher the ratio, the less engine mass is needed to be carried. This permits the carrying of even more propellant, enormously improving the delta-v. Alternatively, some rockets such as for rescue scenarios or racing carry relatively little propellant and payload and thus need only a lightweight structure and instead achieve high accelerations. For example, the Soyuz escape system can produce 20\u00a0\"g\".\nAchievable mass ratios are highly dependent on many factors such as propellant type, the design of engine the vehicle uses, structural safety margins and construction techniques.\nThe highest mass ratios are generally achieved with liquid rockets, and these types are usually used for orbital launch vehicles, a situation which calls for a high delta-v. Liquid propellants generally have densities similar to water (with the notable exceptions of liquid hydrogen and liquid methane), and these types are able to use lightweight, low pressure tanks and typically run high-performance turbopumps to force the propellant into the combustion chamber.\nSome notable mass fractions are found in the following table (some aircraft are included for comparison purposes):\nStaging.\nThus far, the required velocity (delta-v) to achieve orbit has been unattained by any single rocket because the propellant, tankage, structure, guidance, valves and engines and so on, take a particular minimum percentage of take-off mass that is too great for the propellant it carries to achieve that delta-v carrying reasonable payloads. Since Single-stage-to-orbit has so far not been achievable, orbital rockets always have more than one stage.\nFor example, the first stage of the Saturn V, carrying the weight of the upper stages, was able to achieve a mass ratio of about 10, and achieved a specific impulse of 263 seconds. This gives a delta-v of around 5.9\u00a0km/s whereas around 9.4\u00a0km/s delta-v is needed to achieve orbit with all losses allowed for.\nThis problem is frequently solved by staging\u2014the rocket sheds excess weight (usually empty tankage and associated engines) during launch. Staging is either \"serial\" where the rockets light after the previous stage has fallen away, or \"parallel\", where rockets are burning together and then detach when they burn out.\nThe maximum speeds that can be achieved with staging is theoretically limited only by the speed of light. However the payload that can be carried goes down geometrically with each extra stage needed, while the additional delta-v for each stage is simply additive.\nAcceleration and thrust-to-weight ratio.\nFrom Newton's second law, the acceleration, formula_13, of a vehicle is simply:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;\nwhere m is the instantaneous mass of the vehicle and formula_14 is the net force acting on the rocket (mostly thrust, but air drag and other forces can play a part).\nAs the remaining propellant decreases, rocket vehicles become lighter and their acceleration tends to increase until the propellant is exhausted. This means that much of the speed change occurs towards the end of the burn when the vehicle is much lighter. However, the thrust can be throttled to offset or vary this if needed. Discontinuities in acceleration also occur when stages burn out, often starting at a lower acceleration with each new stage firing.\nPeak accelerations can be increased by designing the vehicle with a reduced mass, usually achieved by a reduction in the fuel load and tankage and associated structures, but obviously this reduces range, delta-v and burn time. Still, for some applications that rockets are used for, a high peak acceleration applied for just a short time is highly desirable.\nThe minimal mass of vehicle consists of a rocket engine with minimal fuel and structure to carry it. In that case the thrust-to-weight ratio of the rocket engine limits the maximum acceleration that can be designed. It turns out that rocket engines generally have truly excellent thrust to weight ratios (137 for the NK-33 engine; some solid rockets are over 1000), and nearly all really high-g vehicles employ or have employed rockets.\nThe high accelerations that rockets naturally possess means that rocket vehicles are often capable of vertical takeoff, and in some cases, with suitable guidance and control of the engines, also vertical landing. For these operations to be done it is necessary for a vehicle's engines to provide more than the local gravitational acceleration.\nEnergy.\nEnergy efficiency.\nThe energy density of a typical rocket propellant is often around one-third that of conventional hydrocarbon fuels; the bulk of the mass is (often relatively inexpensive) oxidizer. Nevertheless, at take-off the rocket has a great deal of energy in the fuel and oxidizer stored within the vehicle. It is of course desirable that as much of the energy of the propellant end up as kinetic or potential energy of the body of the rocket as possible.\nEnergy from the fuel is lost in air drag and gravity drag and is used for the rocket to gain altitude and speed. However, much of the lost energy ends up in the exhaust.\nIn a chemical propulsion device, the engine efficiency is simply the ratio of the kinetic power of the exhaust gases and the power available from the chemical reaction:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;\n100% efficiency within the engine (engine efficiency formula_15) would mean that all the heat energy of the combustion products is converted into kinetic energy of the jet. This is not possible, but the near-adiabatic high expansion ratio nozzles that can be used with rockets come surprisingly close: when the nozzle expands the gas, the gas is cooled and accelerated, and an energy efficiency of up to 70% can be achieved. Most of the rest is heat energy in the exhaust that is not recovered. The high efficiency is a consequence of the fact that rocket combustion can be performed at very high temperatures and the gas is finally released at much lower temperatures, and so giving good Carnot efficiency.\nHowever, engine efficiency is not the whole story. In common with the other jet-based engines, but particularly in rockets due to their high and typically fixed exhaust speeds, rocket vehicles are extremely inefficient at low speeds irrespective of the engine efficiency. The problem is that at low speeds, the exhaust carries away a huge amount of kinetic energy rearward. This phenomenon is termed propulsive efficiency (formula_16).\nHowever, as speeds rise, the resultant exhaust speed goes down, and the overall vehicle energetic efficiency rises, reaching a peak of around 100% of the engine efficiency when the vehicle is travelling exactly at the same speed that the exhaust is emitted. In this case the exhaust would ideally stop dead in space behind the moving vehicle, taking away zero energy, and from conservation of energy, all the energy would end up in the vehicle. The efficiency then drops off again at even higher speeds as the exhaust ends up traveling forwards \u2013 trailing behind the vehicle.\nFrom these principles it can be shown that the propulsive efficiency formula_16 for a rocket moving at speed formula_18 with an exhaust velocity formula_19 is:\nAnd the overall (instantaneous) energy efficiency formula_20 is:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;\nFor example, from the equation, with an formula_21 of 0.7, a rocket flying at Mach 0.85 (which most aircraft cruise at) with an exhaust velocity of Mach 10, would have a predicted overall energy efficiency of 5.9%, whereas a conventional, modern, air-breathing jet engine achieves closer to 35% efficiency. Thus a rocket would need about 6\u00d7 more energy; and allowing for the specific energy of rocket propellant being around one third that of conventional air fuel, roughly 18\u00d7 more mass of propellant would need to be carried for the same journey. This is why rockets are rarely if ever used for general aviation.\nSince the energy ultimately comes from fuel, these considerations mean that rockets are mainly useful when a very high speed is required, such as ICBMs or orbital launch. For example, NASA's Space Shuttle fired its engines for around 8.5 minutes, consuming 1,000\u00a0tonnes of solid propellant (containing 16% aluminium) and an additional 2,000,000\u00a0litres of liquid propellant (106,261\u00a0kg of liquid hydrogen fuel) to lift the 100,000\u00a0kg vehicle (including the 25,000\u00a0kg payload) to an altitude of 111\u00a0km and an orbital velocity of 30,000\u00a0km/h. At this altitude and velocity, the vehicle had a kinetic energy of about 3\u00a0TJ and a potential energy of roughly 200\u00a0GJ. Given the initial energy of 20\u00a0TJ, the Space Shuttle was about 16% energy efficient at launching the orbiter.\nThus jet engines, with a better match between speed and jet exhaust speed (such as turbofans\u2014in spite of their worse formula_21)\u2014dominate for subsonic and supersonic atmospheric use, while rockets work best at hypersonic speeds. On the other hand, rockets serve in many short-range \"relatively\" low speed military applications where their low-speed inefficiency is outweighed by their extremely high thrust and hence high accelerations.\nOberth effect.\nOne subtle feature of rockets relates to energy. A rocket stage, while carrying a given load, is capable of giving a particular delta-v. This delta-v means that the speed increases (or decreases) by a particular amount, independent of the initial speed. However, because kinetic energy is a square law on speed, this means that the faster the rocket is travelling before the burn the more orbital energy it gains or loses.\nThis fact is used in interplanetary travel. It means that the amount of delta-v to reach other planets, over and above that to reach escape velocity can be much less if the delta-v is applied when the rocket is travelling at high speeds, close to the Earth or other planetary surface; whereas waiting until the rocket has slowed at altitude multiplies up the effort required to achieve the desired trajectory.\nSafety, reliability and accidents.\nThe reliability of rockets, as for all physical systems, is dependent on the quality of engineering design and construction.\nBecause of the enormous chemical energy in rocket propellants (greater energy by weight than explosives, but lower than gasoline), consequences of accidents can be severe. Most space missions have some problems; for example, a cabin fire during a launch rehearsal of the 1967 Apollo I spacecraft killed all three crew members. In 1986, following the Space Shuttle \"Challenger\" disaster, American physicist Richard Feynman, having served on the Rogers Commission, estimated that the chance of an unsafe condition for a launch of the Shuttle was very roughly 1%; more recently the historical per person-flight risk in orbital spaceflight has been calculated to be around 2% or 4%.\nIn May 2003 the astronaut office made clear its position on the need and feasibility of improving crew safety for future NASA crewed missions indicating their \"consensus that an order of magnitude reduction in the risk of human life during ascent, compared to the Space Shuttle, is both achievable with current technology and consistent with NASA's focus on steadily improving rocket reliability\".\nCosts and economics.\nThe costs of rockets can be roughly divided into propellant costs, the costs of obtaining and/or producing the 'dry mass' of the rocket, and the costs of any required support equipment and facilities.\nMost of the takeoff mass of a rocket is normally propellant. However propellant is seldom more than a few times more expensive than gasoline per kilogram (as of 2009 gasoline was about or less), and although substantial amounts are needed, for all but the very cheapest rockets, it turns out that the propellant costs are usually comparatively small, although not completely negligible. With liquid oxygen costing and liquid hydrogen , the Space Shuttle in 2009 had a liquid propellant expense of approximately $1.4 million for each launch that cost $450 million from other expenses (with 40% of the mass of propellants used by it being liquids in the external fuel tank, 60% solids in the SRBs).\nEven though a rocket's non-propellant, dry mass is often only between 5\u201320% of total mass, nevertheless this cost dominates. For hardware with the performance used in orbital launch vehicles, expenses of $2000\u2013$10,000+ per kilogram of dry weight are common, primarily from engineering, fabrication, and testing; raw materials amount to typically around 2% of total expense. For most rockets except reusable ones (shuttle engines) the engines need not function more than a few minutes, which simplifies design.\nExtreme performance requirements for rockets reaching orbit correlate with high cost, including intensive quality control to ensure reliability despite the limited safety factors allowable for weight reasons. Components produced in small numbers if not individually machined can prevent amortization of R&amp;D and facility costs over mass production to the degree seen in more pedestrian manufacturing. Amongst liquid-fueled rockets, complexity can be influenced by how much hardware must be lightweight, like pressure-fed engines can have two orders of magnitude lesser part count than pump-fed engines but lead to more weight by needing greater tank pressure, most often used in just small maneuvering thrusters as a consequence.\nTo change the preceding factors for orbital launch vehicles, proposed methods have included mass-producing simple rockets in large quantities or on large scale, or developing reusable rockets meant to fly very frequently to amortize their up-front expense over many payloads, or reducing rocket performance requirements by constructing a non-rocket spacelaunch system for part of the velocity to orbit (or all of it but with most methods involving some rocket use).\nThe costs of support equipment, range costs and launch pads generally scale up with the size of the rocket, but vary less with launch rate, and so may be considered to be approximately a fixed cost.\nRockets in applications other than launch to orbit (such as military rockets and rocket-assisted take off), commonly not needing comparable performance and sometimes mass-produced, are often relatively inexpensive.\n2010s emerging private competition.\nSince the early 2010s, new private options for obtaining spaceflight services emerged, bringing substantial price pressure into the existing market.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nLists\nGeneral rocketry\nRocket propulsion\nRecreational rocketry\nWeaponry\nRockets for research\nMiscellaneous\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\nGoverning agencies\nInformation sites"}

He was one of the founders of New Criticism. He was also a charter member of the Fellowship of Southern Writers. He founded the literary journal \"The Southern Review\" with Cleanth Brooks in 1935. He received the 1947 Pulitzer Prize for the Novel for \"All the King's Men\" (1946) and the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry in 1958 and 1979. He is the only person to have won Pulitzer Prizes for both fiction and poetry. Yale awarded Warren an honorary Doctor of Letters degree in 1973.\nEarly years.\nWarren was born in Guthrie, Kentucky, very near the Tennessee-Kentucky border, to Robert Warren and Anna Penn. Warren's mother's family had roots in Virginia, having given their name to the community of Penn's Store in Patrick County, Virginia, and she was a descendant of Revolutionary War soldier Colonel Abram Penn.\nAfter he had graduated from a private high school at age 15, his mother enrolled him in Clarksville High School in Clarksville, Tennessee for a year because she thought he was too young to go to college. In 1921 his left eye was removed after an accident, which canceled his appointment to the U.S. Naval Academy. That summer, he published in \"The Messkit\" his first poem \"Prophecy.\" In the fall of 1921, at age 16, he entered Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, graduating in the summer of 1925 \"summa cum laude\", Phi Beta Kappa, and Founder's Medalist. That fall, he entered the University of California, Berkeley, as a graduate student and teaching assistant, and upon receiving his M.A. in 1927, entered Yale University on a fellowship. In October 1928 he entered New College, Oxford, in England as a Rhodes Scholar and received his B.Litt. in the spring of 1930. He also received a Guggenheim Fellowship to study in Italy during the rule of Benito Mussolini. That same year he began his teaching career at Southwestern College (now Rhodes College) in Memphis, Tennessee.\nCareer.\nWhile still an undergraduate at Vanderbilt University, Warren became associated with the group of poets there known as the Fugitives, and somewhat later, during the early 1930s, Warren and some of the same writers formed a group known as the Southern Agrarians. He contributed \"The Briar Patch\" to the Agrarian manifesto \"I'll Take My Stand\" along with 11 other Southern writers and poets (including fellow Vanderbilt poet/critics John Crowe Ransom, Allen Tate, and Donald Davidson). In \"The Briar Patch\" the young Warren defends racial segregation, in line with the political leanings of the Agrarian group, although Davidson deemed Warren's stances in the essay so progressive that he argued for excluding it from the collection. However, Warren recanted these views in an article on the civil rights movement, \"Divided South Searches Its Soul\", which appeared in the July 9, 1956 issue of \"Life\" magazine. A month later, Warren published an expanded version of the article as a small book titled \"Segregation: The Inner Conflict in the South\". He subsequently adopted a high profile as a supporter of racial integration. In 1965, he published \"Who Speaks for the Negro?\", a collection of interviews with black civil rights leaders including Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr., thus further distinguishing his political leanings from the more conservative philosophies associated with fellow Agrarians such as Tate, Cleanth Brooks, and particularly Davidson. Warren's interviews with civil rights leaders are at the Louie B. Nunn Center for Oral History at the University of Kentucky.\nWarren's best-known work is \"All the King's Men\", a novel that won the Pulitzer Prize in 1947. Main character Willie Stark resembles Huey Pierce Long (1893\u20131935), the radical populist governor of Louisiana whom Warren was able to observe closely while teaching at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge from 1933 to 1942. The 1949 film by the same name was highly successful, starring Broderick Crawford and winning the Academy Award for Best Picture in 1949. There was another film adaptation in 2006 featuring Sean Penn as Willie Stark. The opera \"Willie Stark\" by Carlisle Floyd, to his own libretto based on the novel, was first performed in 1981.\nWarren served as the Consultant in Poetry to the Library of Congress, 1944\u20131945 (later termed Poet Laureate), and won two Pulitzer Prizes in poetry, in 1958 for \"Promises: Poems 1954\u20131956\" and in 1979 for \"Now and Then\". \"Promises\" also won the annual National Book Award for Poetry.\nIn 1974, the National Endowment for the Humanities selected him for the Jefferson Lecture, the U.S. federal government's highest honor for achievement in the humanities. Warren's lecture was entitled \"Poetry and Democracy\" (subsequently published under the title \"Democracy and Poetry\"). In 1977, Warren was awarded the St. Louis Literary Award from the Saint Louis University Library Associates. In 1980, Warren was presented with the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Jimmy Carter. In 1981, Warren was selected as a MacArthur Fellow and later was named as the first U.S. Poet Laureate Consultant in Poetry on February 26, 1986. In 1987, he was awarded the National Medal of Arts. Warren was an elected member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the American Philosophical Society.\nWarren was co-author, with Cleanth Brooks, of \"Understanding Poetry\", an influential literature textbook. It was followed by other similarly co-authored textbooks, including \"Understanding Fiction\", which was praised by Southern Gothic and Roman Catholic writer Flannery O'Connor, and \"Modern Rhetoric\", which adopted what can be called a New Critical perspective.\nPersonal life.\nHis first marriage was to Emma Brescia. His second marriage was in 1952 to Eleanor Clark, with whom he had two children, Rosanna Phelps Warren (born 1953) and Gabriel Penn Warren (born 1955). During his tenure at Louisiana State University he resided at Twin Oaks (otherwise known as the Robert Penn Warren House) in Prairieville, Louisiana.\nWarren was a lifelong Democrat who cast his first vote for Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1932. Formerly a segregationist, he renounced these views in the 1950s and began to advocate for African American civil rights, condemning Dwight D. Eisenhower for not taking a firmer stance on the subject.\nHe lived the latter part of his life in Fairfield, Connecticut, and Stratton, Vermont, where he died of complications from prostate cancer. He is buried at Stratton, Vermont, and, at his request, a memorial marker is situated in the Warren family gravesite in Guthrie, Kentucky.\nLegacy.\nIn April 2005, the United States Postal Service issued a commemorative stamp to mark the 100th anniversary of Warren's birth. Introduced at the post office in his native Guthrie, it depicts the author as he appeared in a 1948 photograph, with a background scene of a political rally designed to evoke the setting of \"All the King's Men\".
