The literal meaning of \"perestroika\" is \"restructuring\", referring to the restructuring of the political economy of the Soviet Union in an attempt to end the Era of Stagnation.\n\"Perestroika\" allowed more independent actions from various ministries and introduced many market-like reforms. The purported goal of \"perestroika\" was not to end the planned economy, but rather to make socialism work more efficiently to better meet the needs of Soviet citizens by adopting elements of liberal economics. The process of implementing \"perestroika\" added to existing shortage and created political, social, and economic tensions within the Soviet Union. Furthermore, it is often blamed for the political ascent of nationalism and nationalist political parties in the constituent republics.\nThe motivation for perestroika stemmed from a combination of entrenched economic stagnation, political sclerosis, and growing social dissatisfaction that had taken root in the early 1980s. These conditions compelled Gorbachev and his allies to initiate broad reforms to save the system from collapse.\nGorbachev first used the term during a speech on December 10, 1984, and began implementing his reforms 3 months later when coming to power. \"Perestroika\" lasted from 1985 until 1991, and is often argued to be a significant cause of the collapse of the Eastern Bloc and the dissolution of the Soviet Union.\nRussian-British sociologist Mikhail Anipkin views \"perestroika\" as a revolution of quadragenarians. In his 2024 book, \"Party Worker: The Rise of a Soviet Regional Leader\", Anipkin argues that \"perestroika\" was desperately sought by the younger generation of Party functionaries, and Mikhail Gorbachev sensed that demand. Anipkin draws his arguments from the political biography of his own father, Alexander Anipkin, a high-ranking Party apparatchik, who enthusiastically accepted \"perestroika\" and sought to further democracy within the Party.\nWith respect to the foreign policy Gorbachev promoted \"new political thinking\": de-ideologization of international politics, abandoning the concept of class struggle, priority of universal human interests over the interests of any class, increasing interdependence of the world, and mutual security based on political rather than military instruments. The doctrine constituted a significant shift from the previous principles of the Soviet foreign politics. This marked the end of the Cold War.\nPolitical reforms.\nGorbachev had concluded that implementing his reforms outlined at the Twenty-Seventh Party Congress in February 1986 required more than discrediting the \"Old Guard\", those with a Marxist-Leninist political orientation. He changed his strategy from trying to work through the CPSU as it existed and instead embraced a degree of political liberalization. In January 1987, he appealed over the heads of the party to the people and called for democratization. Earlier members of local soviets were appointed by local Communist Party branches; now they were to be elected by the people from among various candidates.\nThe March 1989 election of the Congress of People's Deputies of the Soviet Union marked the first time that voters of the Soviet Union ever chose the membership of a national legislative body. The results of the election stunned the ruling elite. Throughout the country, voters crossed unopposed Communist candidates off the ballot, many of them prominent party officials, taking advantage of the nominal privilege of withholding approval of the listed candidates.\nBy the time of the Twenty-Eighth Party Congress in July 1990, it was clear that Gorbachev's reforms came with sweeping, unintended consequences, as nationalities of the constituent republics of the Soviet Union pulled harder than ever to break away from the Union and ultimately dismantle the Communist Party.\nEconomic reforms.\nIn May 1985, Mikhail Gorbachev gave a speech in Leningrad in which he admitted the slowing of economic development, and inadequate living standards.\nThe program was furthered at the 27th Congress of the Communist Party in Gorbachev's report to the congress, in which he spoke about \"\"perestroika\", \"uskoreniye\"\" (acceleration), \"human factor\", \"glasnost\" (transparency), and \"expansion of the \"khozraschyot\"\" (accounting).\nDuring the initial period (1985\u20131987) of Mikhail Gorbachev's time in power, he talked about modifying central planning but did not make any truly fundamental changes (\"uskoreniye\"; \"acceleration\"). Gorbachev and his team of economic advisors then introduced more fundamental reforms, which became known as \"perestroika\" (restructuring).\nAt the June 1987 plenary session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Gorbachev presented his \"basic theses\", which laid the political foundation of economic reform for the remainder of the existence of the Soviet Union.\nIn July 1987, the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union passed the Law on State Enterprise. The law stipulated that state enterprises were free to determine output levels based on demand from consumers and other enterprises. Enterprises had to fulfil state orders, but they could dispose of the remaining output as they saw fit. However, at the same time the state still held control over the means of production for these enterprises, thus limiting their ability to enact full-cost accountability. Enterprises bought input from suppliers at negotiated contract prices. Under the law, enterprises became self-financing; that is, they had to cover expenses (wages, taxes, supplies, and debt service) through revenues. Finally, the law shifted control over the enterprise operations from ministries to elected workers' collectives. Gosplan's responsibilities were to supply general guidelines and national investment priorities.\nThe Law on Cooperatives, enacted in May 1988, was perhaps the most radical of the economic reforms during the early part of the Gorbachev era. For the first time since Vladimir Lenin's New Economic Policy was abolished in 1928, the law permitted private ownership of businesses in the services, manufacturing, and foreign-trade sectors. The law initially imposed high taxes and employment restrictions, but it later revised these to avoid discouraging private-sector activity. Under this provision, cooperative restaurants, shops, and manufacturers became part of the Soviet scene.\nAlexander Yakovlev was considered to be the intellectual force behind Gorbachev's reform program of \"glasnost\" and \"perestroika\". In the summer of 1985, Yakovlev became head of the propaganda department of the CPSU Central Committee. He argued in favor of the reform programs and played a key role in executing those policies.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\u2014\u200a\nThe most significant of Gorbachev's reforms in the foreign economic sector allowed foreigners to invest in the Soviet Union in the form of joint ventures with Soviet ministries, state enterprises, and cooperatives. The original version of the Soviet Joint Venture Law, which went into effect in June 1987, limited foreign shares of a Soviet venture to 49 percent and required that Soviet citizens occupy the positions of chairman and general manager. After potential Western partners complained, the government revised the regulations to allow majority foreign ownership and control. Under the terms of the Joint Venture Law, the Soviet partner supplied labor, infrastructure, and a potentially large domestic market. The foreign partner supplied capital, technology, entrepreneurial expertise, and in many cases, products and services of world competitive quality.\nGorbachev's economic changes did not do much to improve the country's sluggish economy in the late 1980s. The reforms decentralized things to some extent, although price controls remained, as did the ruble's inconvertibility and most government controls over the means of production.\nComparison with China.\n\"Perestroika\" and Deng Xiaoping's economic reforms have similar origins but very different effects on their respective countries' economies. Both efforts occurred in large socialist countries attempting to liberalize their economies, but while China's GDP has grown consistently since the late 1980s (albeit from a much lower level), national GDP in the USSR and in many of its successor states fell precipitously throughout the 1990s, a period often referred to as the wild nineties. Gorbachev's reforms were gradualist and maintained many of the macroeconomic aspects of the planned economy (including price controls, inconvertibility of the ruble, exclusion of private property ownership, and the government monopoly over most means of production).\nReform was largely focused on industry and on cooperatives, and a limited role was given to the development of foreign investment and international trade. Factory managers were expected to meet state demands for goods, but to find their own funding. \"Perestroika\" reforms went far enough to create new bottlenecks in the Soviet economy but arguably did not go far enough to effectively streamline it.\nChinese economic reform was, by contrast, a bottom-up attempt at reform, focusing on light industry and agriculture (namely allowing peasants to sell produce grown on private holdings at market prices). Economic reforms were fostered through the development of \"Special Economic Zones\", designed for export and to attract foreign investment, municipally managed Township and Village Enterprises and a \"dual pricing\" system leading to the steady phasing out of state-dictated prices. Greater latitude was given to managers of state-owned factories, while capital was made available to them through a reformed banking system and through fiscal policies (in contrast to the fiscal anarchy and fall in revenue experienced by the Soviet government during \"perestroika\"). \"Perestroika\" was expected to lead to results such as market pricing and privately sold produce, but the Union dissolved before advanced stages were reached.\nAnother fundamental difference is that where \"perestroika\" was accompanied by greater political freedoms under Gorbachev's \"glasnost\" policies, Chinese economic reform has been accompanied by continued authoritarian rule and a suppression of political dissidents, most notably at Tiananmen Square. Gorbachev acknowledged this difference but maintained that it was unavoidable and that \"perestroika\" would have been doomed to defeat and revanchism by the \"nomenklatura\" without \"glasnost\", because conditions in the Soviet Union were not identical to those in China. Gorbachev cited a line from a 1986 newspaper article that he felt encapsulated this reality: \"The apparatus broke Khrushchev's neck and the same thing will happen now.\"\nAnother difference is that Soviet Union faced strong secession threats from its ethnic regions and a primacy challenge by the RSFSR. Gorbachev's extension of regional autonomy removed the suppression from existing ethnic-regional tension, while Deng's reforms did not alter the tight grip of the central government on any of their autonomous regions. The Soviet Union's dual nature, part supranational union of republics and part unitary state, played a part in the difficulty of controlling the pace of restructuring, especially once the new Russian Communist Party was formed and posed a challenge to the primacy of the CPSU. Gorbachev described this process as a \"parade of sovereignties\" and identified it as the factor that most undermined the gradualism of restructuring and the preservation of the Soviet Union.\n\"Perestroika\" and \"glasnost\".\nOne of the final important measures taken on the continuation of the movement was a report from the central committee meeting of the CPSU titled \"On Reorganization and the Party's Personnel Policy\". Gorbachev emphasized the need of a faster political personnel turnover and of a policy of democratization that opened the political elections to multiple candidates and to non-party members.\nThis report was in such high demand in Prague and Berlin that many people could not get a copy. One effect was the abrupt demand for Russian dictionaries in order to understand the content of Gorbachev's report.\nIn an interview with Mieczyslaw Rakowski he states the success of \"perestroika\" was impossible without \"glasnost\".\nDespite early enthusiasm, the reforms of perestroika and glasnost ultimately failed to deliver lasting improvements. By the late 1980s, the Soviet Union faced deepening economic crisis, with widespread shortages and deficits. Gorbachev\u2019s leadership lost credibility as the public saw little tangible progress. Scholars argue that he and his advisors underestimated the severity of the crisis and the political risks of decentralization. Without a clear strategy and amid rising public disillusionment, these reforms contributed to growing instability and the eventual collapse of the Soviet Union.\nThe role of the West in \"Perestroika\".\nDuring the 1980s and 1990s the United States President George H. W. Bush pledged solidarity with Gorbachev, but never brought his administration into supporting Gorbachev's reform. In fact, \"no bailout for Gorbachev\" was a consistent policy line of the Bush administration, further demonstrating the lack of true support from the West. President Bush had a financial policy to aid \"perestroika\" that was shaped by a minimalist approach, foreign-policy convictions that set Bush up against other U.S. internal affairs, and a frugal attitude, all influencing his unwillingness to aid Gorbachev. Other factors influenced the West's lack of aid, for example; the \"in-house Gorbi-skeptics\" advocacy, the expert community's consensus about the undesirability of rushing U.S. aid to Gorbachev, strong opposition to any bailout at many levels including foreign-policy conservatives, the U.S. Congress, and the American public at large. The West seemed to miss an opportunity to gain significant influence over the Soviet government. The Soviets aided in the expansion of Western capitalism to allow for an inflow of Western investments, but the \"perestroika\" managers failed. President Bush had the opportunity to aid the Soviet Union in a way to bring closer ties between the governments, like Harry S. Truman did for many nations in Western Europe.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Early on, as \"perestroika\" was getting under way, I felt like the West might come along and find it a sensible thing to do\u2014easing Russia's difficult transition from totalitarianism to democracy. What I had in mind in the first place, was the participation [of the West] in conversion of defense industries, the modernization of light and food industries, and Russia's inclusion on an equal-member footing in the frameworks of the international economic relations\u00a0... [U]nlike some democrats, I did not expect \"manna from Heaven\", but counted on the Western statesmen to use their common sense.\nPresident George H. W. Bush continued to dodge helping the Russians and the President of Czechoslovakia, V\u00e1clav Havel, laid bare the linkage for the Americans in his address to a joint session of Congress on 21 February 1990:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;... I often hear the question: How can the United States of America help us today? My reply is as paradoxical as the whole of my life has been: You can help us most of all if you help the Soviet Union on its irreversible, but immensely complicated road to democracy.\u00a0... [T]he sooner, the more quickly, and the more peacefully the Soviet Union begins to move along the road toward genuine political pluralism, respect for the rights of nations to their own integrity and to a working\u2014that is a market\u2014economy, the better it will be, not just for Czechs and Slovaks, but for the whole world.\nWhen the United States needed help with Germany's reunification, Gorbachev proved to be instrumental in bringing solutions to the \"German problem\" and Bush acknowledged that \"Gorbachev was moving the USSR in the right direction\". Bush, in his own words, even gave praise to Gorbachev \"to salute the man\" in acknowledgment of the Soviet leader's role as \"the architect of \"perestroika\"\u00a0... [who had] conducted the affairs of the Soviet Union with great restraint as Poland and Czechoslovakia and GDR\u00a0... and other countries [that had] achieved their independence\", and who was \"under extraordinary pressure at home, particularly on the economy\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Baroque forms such as fugue, which might be called polyphonic, are usually described instead as contrapuntal. Also, as opposed to the \"species\" terminology of counterpoint, polyphony was generally either \"pitch-against-pitch\" / \"point-against-point\" or \"sustained-pitch\" in one part with melismas of varying lengths in another. In all cases the conception was probably what Margaret Bent (1999) calls \"dyadic counterpoint\", with each part being written generally against one other part, with all parts modified if needed in the end. This point-against-point conception is opposed to \"successive composition\", where voices were written in an order with each new voice fitting into the whole so far constructed, which was previously assumed.\nThe term \"polyphony\" is also sometimes used more broadly, to describe any musical texture that is not monophonic. Such a perspective considers homophony as a sub-type of polyphony.\nAntecedents.\nTraditional (non-professional) polyphony has a wide, if uneven, distribution among the peoples of the world. Most polyphonic regions of the world are in sub-Saharan Africa, Europe and Oceania. Currently there are two contradictory approaches to the problem of the origins of vocal polyphony: the Cultural Model, and the Evolutionary Model. According to the Cultural Model, the origins of polyphony are connected to the development of human musical culture; polyphony came as the natural development of the primordial monophonic singing; therefore polyphonic traditions are bound to gradually replace monophonic traditions. According to the Evolutionary Model, the origins of polyphonic singing are much deeper, and are connected to the earlier stages of human evolution; polyphony was an important part of a defence system of the hominids, and traditions of polyphony are gradually disappearing all over the world.\nOrigins of written polyphony.\nAlthough the exact origins of polyphony in the Western church traditions are unknown, the treatises ' and ', both authored c.\u2009900, are usually considered the oldest extant written examples of polyphony. These treatises provided examples of two-voice note-against-note embellishments of chants using parallel octaves, fifths, and fourths. Rather than being fixed works, they indicated ways of improvising polyphony during performance. The \"Winchester Troper\", from , is generally considered to be the oldest extant example of notated polyphony for chant performance, although the notation does not indicate precise pitch levels or durations. However, a two-part antiphon to Saint Boniface recently discovered in the British Library, is thought to have originated in a monastery in north-west Germany and has been dated to the early tenth century.\nEuropean polyphony.\nHistorical context.\nEuropean polyphony rose out of melismatic ', the earliest harmonization of the chant. During the 12th century, composers such as L\u00e9onin and P\u00e9rotin developed the that had been introduced centuries earlier, and also added a third and fourth voice to the now homophonic chant. In the 13th century, the chant-based tenor was becoming altered, fragmented, and hidden beneath secular tunes, obscuring the sacred texts as composers continued to develop polyphonic techniques. The lyrics of love poems might be sung above sacred texts in the form of a trope, or the sacred text might be placed within a familiar secular melody. The oldest surviving piece of six-part music is the English rota ' ().\nWestern Europe and Roman Catholicism.\nEuropean polyphony rose prior to, and during the period of the Western Schism. Avignon, the seat of popes and then antipopes, was a vigorous center of secular music-making, much of which influenced sacred polyphony.\nThe notion of secular and sacred music merging in the papal court also offended some medieval ears. It gave church music more of a jocular performance quality supplanting the solemnity of worship they were accustomed to. The use of and attitude toward polyphony varied widely in the Avignon court from the beginning to the end of its religious importance in the 14th century.\nHarmony was considered frivolous, impious, lascivious, and an obstruction to the audibility of the words. Instruments, as well as certain modes, were actually forbidden in the church because of their association with secular music and pagan rites. After banishing polyphony from the Liturgy in 1322, Pope John XXII warned against the unbecoming elements of this musical innovation in his 1324 bull \". In contrast Pope Clement VI indulged in it.\nThe oldest extant polyphonic setting of the mass attributable to one composer is Guillaume de Machaut's \", dated to 1364, during the pontificate of Pope Urban V. The Second Vatican Council said Gregorian chant should be the focus of liturgical services, without excluding other forms of sacred music, including polyphony.\nProtestant Britain and the United States.\nEnglish Protestant west gallery music included polyphonic multi-melodic harmony, including fuguing tunes, by the mid-18th century. This tradition passed with emigrants to North America, where it was proliferated in tunebooks, including shape-note books like \"The Southern Harmony\" and \"The Sacred Harp\". While this style of singing has largely disappeared from British and North American sacred music, it survived in the rural Southern United States, until it again began to grow a following throughout the United States and even in places such as the United Kingdom, Germany, Poland, and Australia, among others.\nBalkan region.\nPolyphonic singing is traditional folk singing of this part of southern Europe. It is also called \"ancient\", \"archaic\" or \"old-style\" singing.\nIncipient polyphony (previously primitive polyphony) includes antiphony and call and response, drones, and parallel intervals.\nBalkan drone music is described as polyphonic due to Balkan musicians using a literal translation of the Greek ('many voices'). In terms of Western classical music, it is not strictly polyphonic, due to the drone parts having no melodic role, and can better be described as \"multipart\".\nThe polyphonic singing tradition of Epirus is a form of traditional folk polyphony practiced among Aromanians, Albanians, Greeks, Bulgarians and ethnic Macedonians in southern Albania and northwestern Greece. This type of folk vocal tradition is also found in North Macedonia and Bulgaria.\nAlbanian polyphonic singing can be divided into two major stylistic groups as performed by the Tosks and Labs of southern Albania. The drone is performed in two ways: among the Tosks, it is always continuous and sung on the syllable 'e', using staggered breathing; while among the Labs, the drone is sometimes sung as a rhythmic tone, performed to the text of the song. It can be differentiated between two-, three- and four-voice polyphony.\nIn Aromanian music, polyphony is common, and polyphonic music follows a set of common rules.\nThe phenomenon of Albanian folk iso-polyphony (Albanian iso-polyphony) has been proclaimed by UNESCO a \"Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity\". The term \"iso\" refers to the drone, which accompanies the iso-polyphonic singing and is related to the ison of Byzantine church music, where the drone group accompanies the song.\nCorsica.\nThe French island of Corsica has a unique style of music called Paghjella that is known for its polyphony. Traditionally, Paghjella contains a staggered entrance and continues with the three singers carrying independent melodies. This music tends to contain much melisma and is sung in a nasal temperament. Additionally, many paghjella songs contain a picardy third. After paghjella's revival in the 1970s, it mutated. In the 1980s it had moved away from some of its more traditional features as it became much more heavily produced and tailored towards western tastes. There were now four singers, significantly less melisma, it was much more structured, and it exemplified more homophony. To the people of Corsica, the polyphony of paghjella represented freedom; it had been a source of cultural pride in Corsica and many felt that this movement away from the polyphonic style meant a movement away from paghjella's cultural ties. This resulted in a transition in the 1990s. Paghjella again had a strong polyphonic style and a less structured meter.\nSardinia.\nCantu a tenore is a traditional style of polyphonic singing in Sardinia.\nCaucasus region.\nGeorgia.\nPolyphony in the Republic of Georgia is arguably the oldest polyphony in the Christian world. Georgian polyphony is traditionally sung in three parts with strong dissonances, parallel fifths, and a unique tuning system based on perfect fifths. Georgian polyphonic singing has been proclaimed by UNESCO an Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. Popular singing has a highly valued place in Georgian culture. There are three types of polyphony in Georgia: complex polyphony, which is common in Svaneti; polyphonic dialogue over a bass background, prevalent in the Kakheti region in Eastern Georgia; and contrasted polyphony with three partially improvised sung parts, characteristic of western Georgia. The Chakrulo song, which is sung at ceremonies and festivals and belongs to the first category, is distinguished by its use of metaphor and its yodel, the krimanchuli and a \"cockerel\u2019s crow\", performed by a male falsetto singer. Some of these songs are linked to the cult of the grapevine and many date back to the eighth century. The songs traditionally pervaded all areas of everyday life, ranging from work in the fields (the Naduri, which incorporates the sounds of physical effort into the music) to songs to curing of illnesses and to Christmas Carols (Alilo). Byzantine liturgical hymns also incorporated the Georgian polyphonic tradition to such an extent that they became a significant expression of it.\nChechens and Ingushes.\nChechen and Ingush traditional music can be defined by their tradition of vocal polyphony. Chechen and Ingush polyphony is based on a drone and is mostly three-part, unlike most other north Caucasian traditions' two-part polyphony. The middle part carries the main melody accompanied by a double drone, holding the interval of a fifth around the melody. Intervals and chords are often dissonances (sevenths, seconds, fourths), and traditional Chechen and Ingush songs use sharper dissonances than other North Caucasian traditions. The specific cadence of a final, dissonant three-part chord, consisting of fourth and the second on top (c-f-g), is almost unique. (Only in western Georgia do a few songs finish on the same dissonant c-f-g chord.)\nOceania.\nParts of Oceania maintain rich polyphonic traditions. The peoples of New Guinea Highlands including the Moni, Dani, and Yali use vocal polyphony, as do the people of Manus Island. Many of these styles are drone-based or feature close, secondal harmonies dissonant to western ears. Guadalcanal and the Solomon Islands are host to instrumental polyphony, in the form of bamboo panpipe ensembles. Europeans were surprised to find drone-based and dissonant polyphonic singing in Polynesia. Polynesian traditions were then influenced by Western choral church music, which brought counterpoint into Polynesian musical practice.\nAfrica.\nNumerous Sub-Saharan African music traditions host polyphonic singing, typically moving in parallel motion. While the Maasai people traditionally sing with drone polyphony, other East African groups use more elaborate techniques. The Dorze people, for example, sing with as many as six parts, and the Wagogo use counterpoint. The music of African Pygmies (e.g. that of the Aka people) is typically ostinato and contrapuntal, featuring yodeling. Other Central African peoples tend to sing with parallel lines rather than counterpoint. In Burundi, rural women greet each other with akazehe, a two-part interlocking vocal rhythm. The singing of the San people, like that of the pygmies, features melodic repetition, yodeling, and counterpoint. The singing of neighboring Bantu peoples, like the Zulu, is more typically parallel. The peoples of tropical West Africa traditionally use parallel harmonies rather than counterpoint.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "24145", "revid": "50865678", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24145", "title": "Pun", "text": "Form of word play\nA pun, also known as a paronomasia in the context of linguistics, is a form of word play that exploits multiple meanings of a term, or of similar-sounding words, for an intended humorous or rhetorical effect. These ambiguities can arise from the intentional use of homophonic, homographic, metonymic, or figurative language. A pun differs from a malapropism in that a malapropism is an incorrect variation on a correct expression, while a pun involves expressions with multiple (correct or fairly reasonable) interpretations. Puns may be regarded as in-jokes or idiomatic constructions, especially as their usage and meaning are usually specific to a particular language or its culture.\nPuns have a long history in writing. For example, the Roman playwright Plautus was famous for his puns and word games.\nTypes of puns.\nHomophonic.\nA homophonic pun is one that uses word pairs which sound alike (homophones) but are not synonymous. Walter Redfern summarized this type with his statement \"To pun is to treat homonyms as synonyms.\" For example, in George Carlin's phrase \"atheism is a non-prophet institution\", the word \"prophet\" is put in place of its homophone \"profit\", altering the common phrase \"non-profit institution\". Similarly, the Cold War era joke \"Question: Why do we still have troops in Germany? Answer: To keep the Russians in Czech\" relies on the aural ambiguity of the homophones \"check\" and \"Czech\". Often, puns are not strictly homophonic, but play on words of similar, not identical, sound as in the example from the \"Pinky and the Brain\" cartoon film series: \"I think so, Brain, but if we give peas a chance, won't the lima beans feel left out?\" which plays with the similar\u2014but not identical\u2014sound of \"peas\" and \"peace\" in the anti-war slogan \"Give Peace a Chance\".\nHomographic.\nA \"homographic\" pun exploits words that are spelled the same (homographs) but possess different meanings and sounds. Because of their origin, they rely on sight more than hearing, contrary to homophonic puns. They are also known as \"heteronymic puns\". Examples in which the punned words typically exist in two different parts of speech often rely on unusual sentence construction, as in the anecdote: \"When asked to explain his large number of children, the pig answered simply: 'The wild oats of my sow gave us many piglets.'\" An example that combines homophonic and homographic punning is Douglas Adams's line \"You can tune a guitar, but you can't tuna fish. Unless of course, you play bass.\" The phrase uses the homophonic qualities of \"tune a\" and \"tuna\", as well as the homographic pun on \"bass\", in which ambiguity is reached through the identical spellings of (a string instrument), and (a kind of fish). Homographic puns do not necessarily need to follow grammatical rules and often do not make sense when interpreted outside the context of the pun.\nHomonymic.\n\"Homonymic\" puns, another common type, arise from the exploitation of words that are both homographs and homophones. The statement \"Being in politics is just like playing golf: you are trapped in one bad lie after another\" puns on the two meanings of the word \"lie\" as \"a deliberate untruth\" and as \"the position in which something rests\". An adaptation of a joke repeated by Isaac Asimov gives us \"Did you hear about the little moron who strained himself while running into the screen door?\" playing on \"strained\" as \"to give much effort\" and \"to filter\". A homonymic pun may also be polysemic, in which the words must be homonymic and also possess related meanings, a condition that is often subjective. However, lexicographers define polysemes as listed under a single dictionary lemma (a unique numbered meaning) while homonyms are treated in separate lemmata.\nCompounded.\nA compound pun is a statement that contains two or more puns. In this case, the wordplay cannot go into effect by utilizing the separate words or phrases of the puns that make up the entire statement. For example, a complex statement by Richard Whately includes four puns: \"Why can a man never starve in the Great Desert? Because he can eat the sand which is there. But what brought the sandwiches there? Why, Noah sent Ham, and his descendants mustered and bred.\" This pun uses \"sand which is there/sandwiches there\", \"Ham/ham\", \"mustered/mustard\", and \"bred/bread\". Similarly, the phrase \"piano is not my forte\" links two meanings of the words \"forte\" and \"piano\", one for the dynamic markings in music and the second for the literal meaning of the sentence, as well as alluding to \"pianoforte\", the older name of the instrument. Compound puns may also combine two phrases that share a word. For example, \"Where do mathematicians go on weekends? To a M\u00f6bius strip club!\" puns on the terms \"M\u00f6bius strip\" and \"strip club\".\nRecursive.\nA recursive pun is one in which the second aspect of a pun relies on the understanding of an element in the first. For example, the statement \"\u03c0 is only half a pie\" (\u03c0 radians is 180 degrees, or half a circle, and a pie is a complete circle). Another example is \"Infinity is not in finity\", which means infinity is not in finite range. Another example is \"a Freudian slip is when you say one thing but mean your mother\". The recursive pun \"Immanuel doesn't pun, he Kant\" is attributed to Oscar Wilde.\nVisual.\nVisual puns are sometimes used in logos, emblems, insignia, and other graphic symbols, in which one or more of the pun aspects is replaced by a picture. In European heraldry, this technique is called canting arms. Visual and other puns and word games are also common in Dutch gable stones as well as in some cartoons, such as \"Lost Consonants\" and \"The Far Side\". Another type of visual pun exists in languages that use non-phonetic writing. For example, in Chinese, a pun may be based on a similarity in shape of the written character, despite a complete lack of phonetic similarity in the words punned upon. Mark Elvin describes how this \"peculiarly Chinese form of visual punning involved comparing written characters to objects\".\nVisual puns on the bearer's name are used extensively as forms of heraldic expression, they are called canting arms. They have been used for centuries across Europe and have even been used recently by members of the British royal family, such as on the arms of Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother and of Princess Beatrice of York. The arms of U.S. Presidents Theodore Roosevelt and Dwight D. Eisenhower are also canting. In the context of non-phonetic texts, 4 Pics 1 Word, is an example of visual paronomasia where the players are supposed to identify the word in common from the set of four images.\nParonomastic.\nParonomasia is the formal term for punning, playing with words to create humorous or rhetorical effect. Paronomastic puns often manipulate well-known idioms, proverbs, or phrases to deliver a punned twist. The classic structure of a joke, with a setup leading to a punchline, is a common format for paronomastic puns, where the punchline alters the expected phrase in a way that plays on multiple meanings of a word. For instance, in the sentence \"I used to be a baker, but I couldn't make enough dough\", the word \"dough\" is used paronomastically to refer both to the substance used to make bread and to slang for money.\nThis type of pun is frequently used in advertisements, comedy, and literature to provide a clever and memorable message. One notable example comes from an advertising slogan for a moving company: \"We don't charge an arm and a leg. We want your tows.\" Here, the familiar phrase \"an arm and a leg\" is paronomastically punned upon with \"tows\", playing on the phonetic similarity to \"toes\" while referring to the company's service of towing belongings.\nMetonymic.\nMetonymic puns exploit the metonymic relationship between words \u2013 where a word or phrase is used to represent something it's closely associated with. In such puns, one term is substituted for another term with which it's closely linked by a concept or idea. The humor or wit of the pun often comes from the unexpected yet apt connection made between the two concepts.\nFor instance, consider a hypothetical news headline: \"The White House loses its balance.\" In this case, \"The White House\" is used metonymically to represent the U.S. government, and \"balance\" could be interpreted both as physical stability (as if the building itself is tipping over) or fiscal balance (as in the budget), thereby creating a pun.\nWhile metonymic puns may not be as widely recognized as a specific category of pun, they represent a sophisticated linguistic tool that can bring an additional layer of nuance to wordplay.\nSylleptic/heteronymic.\nSyllepsis, or heteronymy, is a form of punning where a single word simultaneously affects the rest of the sentence, while it changes the meaning of the idiom it is used in. This form of punning uses the word in its literal and metaphorical senses at once, creating a surprising and often humorous effect.\nAn example of a sylleptic pun is in the sentence \"She lowered her standards by raising her glass, her courage, her eyes and his hopes.\" In this case, \"raising\" applies in different ways to each of the items listed, creating a series of linked puns. This type of punning can often be seen in literature, particularly in works that play extensively with language. (She razed his self-esteem in how she raised the children.)\nNotable practitioners of the sylleptic pun include authors such as P. G. Wodehouse, who once wrote: \"If not actually disgruntled, he was far from being gruntled\", playing on the dichotomy of \"disgruntled\" and \"gruntled\", where the latter is not typically used.\nAntanaclasistic.\nAntanaclasis is a type of pun where a single word or phrase is repeated, but the meaning changes each time. The humor or wit derives from the surprising shift in meaning of a familiar word or phrase. This form of punning often relies on homophones, homonyms, or simply the contextual flexibility of a word or phrase.\nA classic example is Benjamin Franklin's statement \"We must, indeed, all hang together or, most assuredly, we shall all hang separately.\" In this quote, the word \"hang\" is first used to mean \"stay\" or \"work together\", but then, it is repeated with the meaning \"be executed\".\nThis punning style is prevalent in both humorous and serious contexts, adding layers of complexity to the language by highlighting the multifaceted nature of words. Such puns are frequently used in literature, speeches, and advertising to deliver memorable and impactful lines.\nOther.\nRichard J. Alexander notes two additional forms that puns may take: graphological (sometimes called visual) puns, such as concrete poetry; and morphological puns, such as portmanteaux. Morphological puns may make use of rebracketing, where for instance \"distressed\" is parsed as \"dis-tressed\" (having hair cut off), or in the self-referential pun \"I entered ten puns in a pun competition hoping one would win, but no pun in ten did\" (parsed as \"no pun intended\").\nUse.\nComedy and jokes.\nPuns are a common source of humour in jokes and comedy shows. They are often used in the punch line of a joke, where they typically give a humorous meaning to a rather perplexing story. These are also known as feghoots. The following example comes from the movie \"\", though the punchline stems from far older Vaudeville roots. The final line puns on the stock phrase \"the lesser of two evils\". After Aubrey offers his pun (to the enjoyment of many), Dr. Maturin shows a disdain for the craft with his reply \"One who would pun would pick-a-pocket.\"\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCaptain Aubrey: \"Do you see those two weevils, Doctor?... Which would you choose?\"\nDr. Maturin: \"Neither. There's not a scrap of difference between them. They're the same species of \"Curculio\".\"\nCaptain Aubrey: \"If you had to choose. If you were forced to make a choice. If there were no other option.\"\nDr. Maturin: \"Well, then, if you're going to push me. I would choose the right-hand weevil. It has significant advantage in both length and breadth.\"\nCaptain Aubrey: \"There, I have you!...Do you not know that in the Service, one must always choose \"the lesser of the two weevils\".\"\nNot infrequently, puns are used in the titles of comedic parodies. A parody of a popular song, movie, etc., may be given a title that hints at the title of the work being parodied, replacing some of the words with ones that sound or look similar. For example, collegiate a cappella groups are often named after musical puns to attract fans through attempts at humor. Such a title can immediately communicate both that what follows is a parody and also that work is about to be parodied, making any further \"setup\" (introductory explanation) unnecessary.\nBooks never written.\nSometimes called \"books never written\" or \"world's greatest books\", these are jokes that consist of fictitious book titles with authors' names that contain a pun relating to the title. Perhaps the best-known example is: \"\"Tragedy on the Cliff\" by Eileen Dover\", which according to one source was devised by humourist Peter De Vries. It is common for these puns to refer to taboo subject matter, such as \"\"What Boys Love\" by E. Norma Stitts\".\nPun competitions\n2014 saw the inaugural UK Pun Championships, at the Leicester Comedy Festival, hosted by Lee Nelson. The winner was Darren Walsh. Walsh went on to take part in the O. Henry Pun-Off World Championships in Austin, Texas. In 2015 the UK Pun Champion was Leo Kearse. Other pun competitions include Minnesota\u2019s Pundamonium, Orlando Punslingers, the Almost Annual Pun-Off in Eureka, and Brooklyn\u2019s Punderdome, led by Jo Firestone and her father, Fred Firestone. In \"Away with Words: An Irreverent Tour Through the World of Pun Competitions\", Joe Berkowitz deems Austin's O. Henry Pun-Off the \"Olympics\" of pun competitions, and Brooklyn's Punderdome the \"X Games\". GQ described the crowd at Brooklyn's Punderdome as \"passionate, to a level that feels dangerous\".\nLiterature.\nNon-humorous puns were and are a standard poetic device in English literature. Puns and other forms of wordplay have been used by many famous writers, such as Alexander Pope, James Joyce, Vladimir Nabokov, Robert Bloch, Lewis Carroll, John Donne, and William Shakespeare.\nIn the poem \"A Hymn to God the Father\", John Donne, whose wife's name was Anne More, puns repeatedly: \"Son/sun\" in the second quoted line, and two compound puns on \"Done/done\" and \"More/more\". All three are homophonic, with the puns on \"more\" being both homographic and capitonymic. The ambiguities introduce several possible meanings into the verses.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAlfred Hitchcock stated: \"Puns are the highest form of literature.\"\nShakespeare.\nShakespeare is estimated to have used over 3,000 puns in his plays. Even though many of the puns were bawdy, Elizabethan literature considered puns and wordplay to be a \"sign of literary refinement\" more so than humor. This is evidenced by the deployment of puns in serious or \"seemingly inappropriate\" scenes, like when a dying Mercutio quips \"Ask for me tomorrow, and you shall find me a grave man\" in \"Romeo and Juliet\".\nShakespeare was also noted for his frequent play with less serious puns, the \"quibbles\" of the sort that made Samuel Johnson complain: \"A quibble is to Shakespeare what luminous vapours are to the traveller! He follows it to all adventures; it is sure to lead him out of his way, sure to engulf him in the mire. It has some malignant power over his mind, and its fascinations are irresistible.\" Elsewhere, Johnson disparagingly referred to punning as the lowest form of humour.\nRhetoric.\nPuns can function as a rhetorical device, where the pun serves as a persuasive instrument for an author or speaker. Although puns are sometimes perceived as trite or silly, if used responsibly a pun \"can be an effective communication tool in a variety of situations and forms\". A major difficulty in using puns in this manner is that the meaning of a pun can be interpreted very differently according to the audience's background with the possibility of detracting from the intended message.\nDesign.\nLike other forms of wordplay, paronomasia is occasionally used for its attention-getting or mnemonic qualities, making it common in titles and the names of places, characters, and organizations, and in advertising and slogans.\nMany restaurant and shop names use puns: Cane &amp; Able mobility healthcare, Sam &amp; Ella's Chicken Palace, Tiecoon tie shop, Planet of the Grapes wine and spirits, Curl Up and Dye hair salon, as do books such as \"Pies and Prejudice\", webcomics like (\"\") and feature films such as (\"Good Will Hunting\"). The Japanese anime \"Speed Racer's\" original Japanese title, \"Mach GoGoGo!\" refers to the English word itself, the Japanese word for five (the Mach Five's car number), and the name of the show's main character, Go Mifune. This is also an example of a multilingual pun, full understanding of which requires knowledge of more than one language on the part of the listener.\nNames of fictional characters also often carry puns, such as Ash Ketchum, the protagonist of the anime series \"Pok\u00e9mon\", and Goku (\"Kakarrot\"), the protagonist of the manga series \"Dragon Ball\". Both franchises are known for including second meanings in the names of characters. A recurring motif in the \"Austin Powers\" films repeatedly puns on names that suggest male genitalia. In the science fiction television series \"Star Trek\", \"B-4\" is used as the name of one of four androids models constructed \"before\" the android Data, a main character. A librarian in another \"Star Trek\" episode was named \"Mr. Atoz\" (A to Z).\nThe parallel sequel \"The Lion King 1\u00bd\" advertised with the phrase \"You haven't seen the 1/2 of it!\". Wyborowa Vodka employed the slogan \"Enjoyed for centuries straight\", while Northern Telecom used \"Technology the world calls on\".\nOn 1 June 2015 the BBC Radio 4 \"You and Yours\" included a feature on \"Puntastic Shop Titles\". Entries included a Chinese Takeaway in Ayr town centre called \"Ayr's Wok\", a kebab shop in Ireland called \"Abra Kebabra\" and a tree-surgeon in Dudley called \"Special Branch\". The winning entry, selected by Lee Nelson, was a dry cleaner's in Fulham and Chelsea called \"Starchy and Starchy\", a pun on Saatchi &amp; Saatchi.\nIn the media.\nParonomasia has found a strong foothold in the media. William Safire of \"The New York Times\" suggests that \"the root of this pace-growing [use of paronomasia] is often a headline-writer's need for quick catchiness, and has resulted in a new tolerance for a long-despised form of humor\". It can be argued that paronomasia is common in media headlines, to draw the reader's interest. The rhetoric is important because it connects people with the topic. A notable example is the \"New York Post\" headline \"Headless Body in Topless Bar\". \"New York Post\" headlines for sex scandal articles have included \"Cloak and Shag Her\" (General Petraeus), \"Obama Beats Weiner\" (Congressman Weiner), and \"Bezos Exposes Pecker\".\nParonomasia is prevalent orally as well. Salvatore Attardo believes that puns are verbal humor. He talks about Pepicello and Weisberg's linguistic theory of humor and believes the only form of linguistic humor is limited to puns. This is because a pun is a play on the word itself. Attardo believes that only puns are able to maintain humor and this humor has significance. It is able to help soften a situation and make it less serious, it can help make something more memorable, and using a pun can make the speaker seem witty.\nParonomasia is strong in print media and oral conversation so it can be assumed that paronomasia is strong in broadcast media as well. Examples of paronomasia in media are sound bites. They could be memorable because of the humor and rhetoric associated with paronomasia, thus making the significance of the soundbite stronger.\nConfusion and alternative uses.\nThere exist subtle differences between paronomasia and other literary techniques, such as the double entendre. While puns are often simple wordplay for comedic or rhetorical effect, a double entendre alludes to a second meaning that is not contained within the statement or phrase itself, often one that purposefully disguises the second meaning. As both exploit the use of intentional double meanings, puns can sometimes be double entendres, and vice versa. Puns also bear similarities with paraprosdokian, syllepsis, and eggcorns. In addition, homographic puns are sometimes compared to the stylistic device antanaclasis, and homophonic puns to polyptoton. Puns can be used as a type of mnemonic device to enhance comprehension in an educational setting. Used discreetly, puns can effectively reinforce content and aid in the retention of material. Some linguists have encouraged the creation of neologisms to decrease the instances of confusion caused by puns.\nHistory and global usage.\nPuns were found in ancient Egypt, where they were heavily used in the development of myths and interpretation of dreams.\nIn China, Shen Dao (ca. 300 BC) used \"shi\", meaning \"power\", and \"shi\", meaning \"position\" to say that a king has power because of his position as king.\nIn ancient Mesopotamia around 2500 BC, punning was used by scribes to represent words in cuneiform.\nThe Hebrew-language version of the Old Testament contains well over one hundred puns on proper names. For example, Genesis 9:27 says \"May God expand Japheth\", which is a pun on the Hebrew words 'yapt' (to expand) and 'yepet' (Japheth). The Greek-language version of the New Testament also includes several puns on proper names: Christ as \"Anointed\", Legion as \"Many\", Jerusalem as \"City of Peace\", Barnabas as \"Son of Exhortation\", Peter as \"Rock\", Onesimus as \"Useful\", and so forth.\nThe Maya are known for having used puns in their hieroglyphic writing, and for using them in their modern languages.\nIn Japan, \"graphomania\" was one type of pun. More commonly, wordplay in modern Japan is known as \"dajare\".\nIn Tamil, \"Sledai\" is the word used to mean pun in which a word with two different meanings. This is also classified as a poetry style in ancient Tamil literature. Similarly, in Telugu, \"Slesha\" is the equivalent word and is one of several poetry styles in Telugu literature.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He thus became known for building the new fa\u00e7ade of the Basilica of Saint John Lateran, beginning construction of the Trevi Fountain, and the purchase of Cardinal Alessandro Albani's collection of antiquities for the papal gallery. In his 1738 bull , he provides the first public papal condemnation of Freemasonry.\nEarly life.\nLorenzo Corsini was born in Florence in 1652 as the son of Bartolomeo Corsini, Marquis of Casigliano, and Elisabetta Strozzi, the sister of the Duke of Bagnuolo. Both of his parents belonged to the old Florentine nobility. He was a nephew of Cardinal Neri Corsini and was a distant relative of Saint Andrew Corsini.\nCorsini studied at the Jesuit Roman College in Rome and also at the University of Pisa where he earned a doctorate in both civil law and canon law.\nCareer.\nCorsini practised law under the able direction of his uncle, Cardinal Neri Corsini. After the death of his uncle and his father, in 1685, Corsini, now thirty-three, would have become head of the Corsini. Instead, he renounced his right of primogeniture and from Pope Innocent XI (1676\u20131689) he purchased, according to the custom of the time, for 30,000 scudi, a position of prelatial rank and devoted his wealth and leisure to the enlargement of the library bequeathed to him by his uncle. Corsini's home on the Piazza Navona was the centre of Rome's scholarly and artistic life.\nIn 1690 he was made titular Archbishop of Nicomedia and chosen nuncio to Vienna, receiving a dispensation from Pope Alexander VIII since he had not yet been ordained a priest. He did not proceed to the imperial court, because Leopold I, the Holy Roman Emperor, maintained that he had the right to select the nuncio from a list of three names furnished by the pope.\nIn 1696, Corsini was appointed treasurer-general and governor of the Castel Sant'Angelo. His good fortune increased during the pontificate of Pope Clement XI (1700\u20131721), who employed his talents as a courtier and named him Cardinal-Priest of \"Santa Susanna\" on 17 May 1706, retaining his services as papal treasurer.\nHe advanced still further under Pope Benedict XIII (1724\u20131730), who made him Prefect of the Apostolic Signatura, a judicial branch of the Roman Curia. He was successively appointed as the Cardinal-Priest of San Pietro in Vincoli and Cardinal-Bishop of Frascati.\nPontificate.\nPapal election.\nUnder Benedict XIII, the finances of the Papal States had been delivered into the hands of Cardinal Niccol\u00f2 Coscia and other members of the curia, who had drained the financial resources of the see. Benedict died in 1730, and in the conclave that followed his death, after deliberating for four months, the College of Cardinals selected Corsini, 78 years old and with failing eyesight, who had held all the important offices of the Roman Curia. No pope has since been elected at an older age than Clement XII when he was elected.\nAs a Corsini, with his mother a Strozzi, the new pope represented a family at the highest level of Florentine society, with a cardinal in every generation for the previous hundred years.\nOn 1 May 1730, several of the cardinals initially settled upon electing Cardinal Gianantonio Davia but had been unable to secure the necessary support. To that end, they refocused their efforts on getting Corsini elected, securing him 31 votes. Corsini, however, was not seriously considered as a candidate until about early July when the candidacy of Pietro Marcellino Corradini started to waver. Meanwhile, the French, Spanish, and Germans were perfectly amenable to Corsini's election.\nCorsini took his papal name in memorial to Pope Clement XI, who created him cardinal.\nFinances.\nHis first moves as Pope Clement XII were to restore the papal finances. He demanded restitution from the ministers who had abused the confidence of his predecessor. The chief culprit, Cardinal Niccol\u00f2 Coscia, was heavily fined, excommunicated and sentenced to ten years' imprisonment. Papal finances were also improved through reviving the public lottery, which had been suppressed by the severe morality of Benedict XIII. Soon money poured into Clement XII's treasury, an annual sum amounting to nearly a half million \"scudi\", enabling him to undertake the extensive building programs for which he is chiefly remembered, but which he was never able to see.\nArt and architecture.\nA competition for the majestic fa\u00e7ade of the Basilica of Saint John Lateran was won by architect Alessandro Galilei. The fa\u00e7ade he designed is perhaps more palatial than ecclesiastic, and was finished by 1735. Clement XII erected in that ancient basilica a magnificent chapel dedicated to his 14th-century kinsman, St. Andrew Corsini. He restored the Arch of Constantine and built the Palazzo della Consulta on the Quirinal Hill. He purchased from Cardinal Alessandro Albani for 60,000 scudi a famous collection of statues, inscriptions, etc., and opened it to the public as the Capitoline Museums. He paved the streets of Rome and the roads leading from the city and widened the Via del Corso. He began the triumphant Baroque Trevi Fountain, one of the noted ornaments of Rome. Under his reign, a port was built at Ancona, with a highway that gave easy access to the interior. He drained the malarial marshes of the Chiana near Lake Trasimeno.The pope founded in 1732 the Italo-Albanian College Library of San Demetrio Corone in Calabria.\nForeign policy.\nPolitically, however, this was not a successful papacy among the secular powers of Europe. When the attempt of Papal forces to take over the ancient independent Republic of San Marino failed, Clement XII disavowed the arbitrary action of his legate, Cardinal Giulio Alberoni, in seizing San Marino, and restored its independence. He was also rebuffed in Papal claims over the Duchy of Parma and Piacenza.\nIn August 1730, he gave permission for Victor Amadeus II of Savoy to carry out a morganatic marriage to Anna Canalis di Cumiana. Victor Amadeus II subsequently abdicated his throne, causing great unrest in Savoy.\nEcclesial activities.\nIn ecclesiastic affairs he issued \"In eminenti apostolatus\", the first papal decree against the Freemasons, on 28 April 1738. He canonized Saint Vincent de Paul and proceeded with vigour against the French Jansenists. He campaigned for the reunion of the Roman and Orthodox churches, received the Patriarch of the Coptic Church and persuaded the Armenian Patriarch to remove the anathema against the Council of Chalcedon and Pope Leo I (440\u2013461). He dispatched Joseph Simeon Assemani to the East for the twofold purpose of continuing his search for manuscripts and presiding as legate over the Lebanese Council of 1736. He created the youngest Cardinal ever when, on 19 December 1735, he named Luis Antonio Jaime de Borb\u00f3n y Farnesio, Royal Infante of Spain, age 8, to the Sacred College.\nThough he was blind and compelled to keep to his bed, from which he gave audiences and transacted affairs of state, he surrounded himself with capable officials, many of them his Corsini relatives, but he did little for his family except to purchase and enlarge the palace built in Trastevere for the Riarii, and now known as the Palazzo Corsini (the seat of the Accademia dei Lincei). In 1754, his nephew, Cardinal Neri Maria Corsini, founded therein the famous Corsini Library.\nConsistories.\nClement XII created 35 cardinals in fifteen consistories held throughout his pontificate. The first individual he raised into the cardinalate was his nephew Neri Maria Corsini while he also raised his future successor Carlo della Torre di Rezzonico (Pope Clement XIII) to the cardinalate. He also raised his nephew Giovanni Antonio Guadagni to the cardinalate in 1731.\nCanonizations and beatifications.\nThe pope named five new saints during his reign, the most notable being Vincent de Paul. He also beatified eight others, including his predecessor Pope Benedict XI.\nDeath and burial.\nClement XII died on 6 February 1740 at 9:30 am due to complications from gout. His remains were transferred to his tomb in the Basilica of Saint John Lateran on 20 July 1742. Pope Clement XII's tomb is in the Capella Corsini of the Basilica of St. John Lateran and was completed by the sculptors Giovanni Battista Maini and Carlo Monaldi. His bust was completed by Filippo della Valle.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "24147", "revid": "750091", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24147", "title": "Palindrome", "text": "Sequence that reads the same forwards and backwards\nA palindrome () is a word, number, phrase, or other sequence of symbols that reads the same backwards as forwards, such as \"madam\" or \"racecar\", the date \"22/02/2022\" and the sentence: \"A man, a plan, a canal \u2013 Panama\". The 19-letter Finnish word \"saippuakivikauppias\" (a soapstone vendor) is the longest single-word palindrome in everyday use, while the 12-letter term \"tattarrattat\" (from James Joyce in \"Ulysses\") is the longest in English.\nThe word \"palindrome\" was introduced by English poet and writer Henry Peacham in 1638. The concept of a palindrome can be dated to the 3rd-century BC, although no examples survive. The earliest known examples are the 1st-century AD Latin acrostic word square, the Sator Square (which contains both word and sentence palindromes), and the 4th-century Greek Byzantine sentence palindrome \"nipson anomemata me monan opsin.\"\nPalindromes are also found in music (the table canon and crab canon) and biological structures (most genomes include palindromic gene sequences). In automata theory, the set of all palindromes over an alphabet is a context-free language, but it is not regular.\nEtymology.\nThe word \"palindrome\" was introduced by English poet and writer Henry Peacham in 1638. It is derived from the Greek roots 'again' and 'way, direction'; a different word is used in Greek, \u03ba\u03b1\u03c1\u03ba\u03b9\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 'carcinic' (lit.\u2009'crab-like') to refer to letter-by-letter reversible writing.\nHistorical development.\nThe ancient Greek poet Sotades (3rd-century BC) invented a form of Ionic meter called Sotadic or Sotadean verse, which is sometimes said to have been palindromic, since it is sometimes possible to make a sotadean line by reversing a dactylic hexameter.\nA 1st-century Latin palindrome was found as a graffito at Pompeii. This palindrome, known as the Sator Square, consists of a sentence written in Latin: \"sator arepo tenet opera rotas\" 'The sower Arepo holds with effort the wheels'. It is also an acrostic where the first letters of each word form the first word, the second letters form the second word, and so forth. Hence, it can be arranged into a word square that reads in four different ways: horizontally or vertically from either top left to bottom right or bottom right to top left. Other palindromes found at Pompeii include \"Roma-Olim-Milo-Amor\", which is also written as an acrostic square. Indeed, composing palindromes was \"a pastime of Roman landed gentry\".\nByzantine baptismal fonts were often inscribed with the 4th-century Greek palindrome, (or ) (\"Nipson anom\u0113mata m\u0113 monan opsin\") 'Wash [your] sin(s), not only [your] face', attributed to Gregory of Nazianzus; most notably in the basilica of Hagia Sophia in Constantinople. The inscription is found on fonts in many churches in Western Europe: Orl\u00e9ans (St. Menin's Abbey); Dulwich College; Nottingham (St. Mary's); Worlingworth; Harlow; Knapton; London (St Martin, Ludgate); and Hadleigh (Suffolk).\nA 12th-century palindrome with the same square property is the Hebrew palindrome, \u05e4\u05e8\u05e9\u05e0\u05d5\u00a0\u05e8\u05e2\u05d1\u05ea\u05df\u00a0\u05e9\u05d1\u05d3\u05d1\u05e9\u00a0\u05e0\u05ea\u05d1\u05e2\u05e8\u00a0\u05d5\u05e0\u05e9\u05e8\u05e3 \"perashnu: ra`avtan shebad'vash nitba`er venisraf\" 'We explained the glutton who is in the honey was burned and incinerated', credited in 1924 to the medieval Jewish philosopher Abraham ibn Ezra, and referring to the halachic question as to whether a fly landing in honey makes the honey \"treif\" (non-kosher).\nThe palindromic Latin riddle \"In girum imus nocte et consumimur igni\" 'we go in a circle at night and are consumed by fire' describes the behavior of moths. It is likely that this palindrome is from medieval rather than ancient times. The second word, borrowed from Greek, should properly be spelled \"gyrum\".\nIn English, there are many palindrome \"words\" such as \"eye\", \"madam\", and \"deified\", but English writers generally cited Latin and Greek palindromic sentences in the early 19th century; though John Taylor had coined one in 1614: \"Lewd did I live, &amp; evil I did dwel\" (with the ampersand being something of a \"fudge\"). This is generally considered the first English-language palindrome sentence and was long reputed, notably by the grammarian James \"Hermes\" Harris, to be the \"only\" one, despite many efforts to find others. (Taylor had also composed two other, \"rather indifferent\", palindromic lines of poetry: \"Deer Madam, Reed\", \"Deem if I meed\".) Then in 1848, a certain \"J.T.R.\" coined \"Able was I ere I saw Elba\", which became famous after it was (implausibly) attributed to Napoleon (alluding to his exile on Elba). Other well-known English palindromes are: \"A man, a plan, a canal \u2013 Panama\" (1948), \"Madam, I'm Adam\" (1861), and \"Never odd or even\" (1930).\nTypes.\nCharacters, words, or lines.\nThe most familiar palindromes in English are character-unit palindromes, where the characters read the same backward as forward. Examples are \"civic\", \"radar\", \"level\", \"rotor\", \"kayak\", \"madam\", and \"refer\". The longest common ones are \"rotator, deified, racecar\", and \"reviver\"; longer examples such as \"redivider\", \"kinnikinnik\", and \"tattarrattat\" are orders of magnitude rarer.\nThere are also word-unit palindromes in which the unit of reversal is the word (\"Is it crazy how saying sentences backwards creates backwards sentences saying how crazy it is?\"). Word-unit palindromes were made popular in the recreational linguistics community by J. A. Lindon in the 1960s. Occasional examples in English were created in the 19th century. Several in French and Latin date to the Middle Ages.\nThere are also line-unit palindromes, most often poems. These possess an initial set of lines which, precisely halfway through, is repeated in reverse order, without alteration to word order within each line, and in a way that the second half continues the \"story\" related in the first half in a way that makes sense, this last being key.\nSentences and phrases.\nPalindromes often consist of a sentence or phrase, e.g., \"A man, a plan, a canal, Panama\", \"Mr. Owl ate my metal worm\", \n\"Do geese see God?\", or \"Was it a car or a cat I saw?\". Punctuation, capitalization, and spaces are usually ignored. Some, such as \"Rats live on no evil star\", \"Live on time, emit no evil\", and \"Step on no pets\", include the spaces.\nNames.\nSome names are palindromes, such as the given names Hannah, Ava, Aviva, Anna, Eve, Bob, and Otto, or the surnames Harrah, Renner, Salas, and Nenonen.\nLon Nol (1913\u20131985) was Prime Minister of Cambodia. Nisio Isin is a Japanese novelist and manga writer, whose pseudonym (\u897f\u5c3e \u7dad\u65b0, \"Nishio Ishin\") is a palindrome when romanized using the Kunrei-shiki or the Nihon-shiki systems, and is often written as NisiOisiN to emphasize this. Some people have changed their name in order to make it palindromic (including as the actor Robert Trebor and rock-vocalist Ola Salo), while others were given a palindromic name at birth (such as the philologist Revilo P. Oliver, the flamenco dancer Sara Baras, the runner Anu\u021ba C\u0103tun\u0103, the creator of the Eden Project Tim Smit, and the Mexican racing driver Noel Le\u00f3n).\nThere are also palindromic names in fictional media. \"Stanley Yelnats\" is the name of the main character in \"Holes\", a 1998 novel and 2003 film. Five of the fictional \"Pok\u00e9mon\" species have palindromic names in English (Eevee, Girafarig, Farigiraf, Ho-Oh, and Alomomola), as does the region Alola.\nThe 1970s pop band ABBA is a palindrome using the starting letter of the first name of each of the four band members.\nNumbers.\nThe digits of a palindromic number are the same read backwards as forwards, for example, 91019; decimal representation is usually assumed. In recreational mathematics, palindromic numbers with special properties are sought. For example, 191 and 313 are palindromic primes.\nWhether Lychrel numbers exist is an unsolved problem in mathematics about whether all numbers become palindromes when they are continuously reversed and added. For example, 56 is not a Lychrel number as 56 + 65 = 121, and 121 is a palindrome. The number 59 becomes a palindrome after three iterations: 59 + 95 = 154; 154 + 451 = 605; 605 + 506 = 1111, so 59 is not a Lychrel number either. Numbers such as 196 are thought to never become palindromes when this reversal process is carried out and are therefore suspected of being Lychrel numbers. If a number is not a Lychrel number, it is called a \"delayed palindrome\" (56 has a delay of 1 and 59 has a delay of 3). In January 2017 the number 1,999,291,987,030,606,810 was published in OEIS as , and described as \"The Largest Known Most Delayed Palindrome\", with a delay of 261. Several smaller 261-delay palindromes were published separately as .\nEvery positive integer can be written as the sum of three palindromic numbers in every number system with base 5 or greater.\nDates.\nA day or timestamp is a palindrome when its digits are the same when reversed. Only the digits are considered in this determination and the component separators (hyphens, slashes, and dots) are ignored. Short digits may be used as in \"11/11/11 11:11\" or long digits as in \"2 February 2020\".\nA notable palindrome day is this century's 2 February 2020 because this date is a palindrome regardless of the date format by country (yyyy-mm-dd, dd-mm-yyyy, or mm-dd-yyyy) used in various countries. For this reason, this date has also been termed as a \"Universal Palindrome Day\". Other universal palindrome days include, almost a millennium previously, \"11/11/1111\", the future \"12/12/2121\", and in a millennium \"03/03/3030\".\nIn speech.\nA phonetic palindrome is a portion of speech that is identical or roughly identical when reversed. It can arise in context where language is played with, for example in slang dialects like \"verlan\". In the French language, there is the phrase \"\" (\"a Slavic woman waltzes naked\"), phonemically . John Oswald discussed his experience of phonetic palindromes while working on audio tape versions of the cut-up technique using recorded readings by William S. Burroughs. A list of phonetic palindromes discussed by word puzzle columnist O.V. Michaelsen (Ove Ofteness) include \"crew work\"/\"work crew\", \"dry yard\", \"easy\", \"Funny enough\", \"Let Bob tell\", \"new moon\", \"selfless\", \"Sorry, Ross\", \"Talk, Scott\", \"to boot\", \"top spot\" (also an orthographic palindrome), \"Y'all lie\", \"You're caught. Talk, Roy\", and \"You're damn mad, Roy\". \nLongest palindromes.\nThe longest single-word palindrome in the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" is the 12-letter onomatopoeic word \"tattarrattat\", coined by James Joyce in \"Ulysses\" (1922) for a knock on the door. The \"Guinness Book of Records\" gives the title to the 11-letter \"detartrated\", the preterite and past participle of \"detartrate\", a chemical term meaning to remove tartrates. The 9-letter word Rotavator, a trademarked name for an agricultural machine, is listed in dictionaries as being the longest single-word palindrome. The 9-letter term \"redivider\" is used by some writers, but appears to be an invented or derived term; only \"redivide\" and \"redivision\" appear in the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary; the 9-letter word \"Malayalam\", a language of southern India, is also of equal length.\nAccording to Guinness World Records, the Finnish 19-letter word \"saippuakivikauppias\" (a soapstone vendor), is the world's longest palindromic word in everyday use.\nEnglish palindrome sentences of notable length include mathematician Peter Hilton's \"Doc, note: I dissent. A fast never prevents a fatness. I diet on cod\", and Scottish poet Alastair Reid's \"T. Eliot, top bard, notes putrid tang emanating, is sad; I'd assign it a name: gnat dirt upset on drab pot toilet.\"\nIn English, two palindromic novels have been published: \"Satire: Veritas\" by David Stephens (1980, 58,795 letters), and \"Dr Awkward &amp; Olson in Oslo\" by Lawrence Levine (1986, 31,954 words). Another palindromic English work is a 224-word long poem, \"Dammit I'm Mad\", written by Demetri Martin. \"Weird Al\" Yankovic's song \"Bob\" is composed entirely of palindromes.\nOther occurrences.\nClassical music.\nJoseph Haydn's Symphony No. 47 in G is nicknamed \"the Palindrome\". In the third movement, a minuet and trio, the second half of the minuet is the same as the first but backwards, the second half of the ensuing trio similarly reflects the first half, and then the minuet is repeated.\nThe interlude from Alban Berg's opera \"Lulu\" is a palindrome, as are sections and pieces, in arch form, by many other composers, including James Tenney, and most famously B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k. George Crumb also used musical palindrome to text paint the Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca poem \"\u00bfPor qu\u00e9 nac\u00ed?\", the first movement of three in his fourth book of Madrigals. Igor Stravinsky's final composition, \"The Owl and the Pussy Cat\", is a palindrome.\nThe first movement from Constant Lambert's ballet \"Horoscope\" (1938) is entitled \"Palindromic Prelude\". Lambert claimed that the theme was dictated to him by the ghost of Bernard van Dieren, who had died in 1936.\nBritish composer Robert Simpson also composed music in the palindrome or based on palindromic themes; the slow movement of his Symphony No. 2 is a palindrome, as is the slow movement of his String Quartet No. 1. His hour-long String Quartet No. 9 consists of thirty-two variations and a fugue on a palindromic theme of Haydn (from the minuet of his Symphony No. 47). All of Simpson's thirty-two variations are themselves palindromic.\n\"Hin und Zur\u00fcck\" (\"There and Back\": 1927) is an operatic 'sketch' (Op. 45a) in one scene by Paul Hindemith, with a German libretto by Marcellus Schiffer. It is essentially a dramatic palindrome. Through the first half, a tragedy unfolds between two lovers, involving jealousy, murder and suicide. Then, in the reversing second half, this is replayed with the lines sung in reverse order to produce a happy ending.\nThe music of Anton Webern is often palindromic. Webern, who had studied the music of the Renaissance composer Heinrich Isaac, was extremely interested in symmetries in music, be they horizontal or vertical. An example of horizontal or linear symmetry in Webern's music is the first phrase in the second movement of the symphony, Op. 21. A striking example of vertical symmetry is the second movement of the Piano Variations, Op. 27, in which Webern arranges every pitch of this dodecaphonic work around the central pitch axis of A4. From this, each downward reaching interval is replicated exactly in the opposite direction. For example, a G\u266f3\u201413 half-steps down from A4 is replicated as a B\u266d5\u201413 half-steps above.\nJust as the letters of a verbal palindrome are not reversed, so are the elements of a musical palindrome usually presented in the same form in both halves. Although these elements are usually single notes, palindromes may be made using more complex elements. For example, Karlheinz Stockhausen's composition \"Mixtur\", originally written in 1964, consists of twenty sections, called \"moments\", which may be permuted in several different ways, including retrograde presentation, and two versions may be made in a single program. When the composer revised the work in 2003, he prescribed such a palindromic performance, with the twenty moments first played in a \"forwards\" version, and then \"backwards\". Each moment is a complex musical unit and is played in the same direction in each half of the program. By contrast, Karel Goeyvaerts's 1953 electronic composition, \"Nummer 5 (met zuivere tonen)\" is an \"exact\" palindrome: not only does each event in the second half of the piece occur according to an axis of symmetry at the centre of the work, but each event itself is reversed, so that the note attacks in the first half become note decays in the second, and vice versa. It is a perfect example of Goeyvaerts's aesthetics, the perfect example of the imperfection of perfection.\nIn classical music, a crab canon is a canon in which one line of the melody is reversed in time and pitch from the other.\nA large-scale musical palindrome covering more than one movement is called \"chiastic\", referring to the cross-shaped Greek letter \"\u03c7\" (pronounced /\u02c8ka\u026a/.) This is usually a form of reference to the crucifixion; for example, the \"\" movement of Bach's Mass in B minor. The purpose of such palindromic balancing is to focus the listener on the central movement, much as one would focus on the centre of the cross in the crucifixion. Other examples are found in Bach's cantata BWV 4, \"Christ lag in Todes Banden\", Handel's \"Messiah\" and Faur\u00e9's Requiem.\nA table canon is a rectangular piece of sheet music intended to be played by two musicians facing each other across a table with the music between them, with one musician viewing the music upside down compared to the other. The result is somewhat like two speakers simultaneously reading the Sator Square from opposite sides, except that it is typically in two-part polyphony rather than in unison.\nBiological structures.\nPalindromic motifs are found in most genomes or sets of genetic instructions. The meaning of palindrome in the context of genetics is slightly different, from the definition used for words and sentences. Since the DNA is formed by two paired strands of nucleotides, and the nucleotides always pair in the same way (Adenine (A) with Thymine (T), Cytosine (C) with Guanine (G)), a (single-stranded) sequence of DNA is said to be a palindrome if it is equal to its complementary sequence read backward. For example, the sequence ACCTAGGT is palindromic because its complement is TGGATCCA, which is equal to the original sequence in reverse complement.\nA palindromic DNA sequence may form a hairpin. Palindromic motifs are made by the order of the nucleotides that specify the complex chemicals (proteins) that, as a result of those genetic instructions, the cell is to produce. They have been specially researched in bacterial chromosomes and in the so-called Bacterial Interspersed Mosaic Elements (BIMEs) scattered over them. In 2003, a research genome sequencing project discovered that many of the bases on the Y-chromosome are arranged as palindromes. A palindrome structure allows the Y-chromosome to repair itself by bending over at the middle if one side is damaged.\nIt is believed that palindromes are also found in proteins, but their role in the protein function is not clearly known. It has been suggested in 2008 that the prevalent existence of palindromes in peptides might be related to the prevalence of low-complexity regions in proteins, as palindromes frequently are associated with low-complexity sequences. Their prevalence might also be related to an alpha helical formation propensity of these sequences, or in formation of protein/protein complexes.\nComputation theory.\nIn automata theory, a set of all palindromes in a given alphabet is a typical example of a language that is context-free, but not regular. This means that it is impossible for a finite automaton to reliably test for palindromes.\nIn addition, the set of palindromes may not be reliably tested by a deterministic pushdown automaton which also means that they are not LR(k)-parsable or LL(k)-parsable. When reading a palindrome from left to right, it is, in essence, impossible to locate the \"middle\" until the entire word has been read completely.\nIt is possible to find the longest palindromic substring of a given input string in linear time.\nThe palindromic density of an infinite word \"w\" over an alphabet \"A\" is defined to be zero if only finitely many prefixes are palindromes; otherwise, letting the palindromic prefixes be of lengths \"n\"\"k\" for \"k\"=1,2... we define the density to be\nformula_1\nAmong aperiodic words, the largest possible palindromic density is achieved by the Fibonacci word, which has density 1/\u03c6, where \u03c6 is the Golden ratio.\nA palstar is a concatenation of palindromic strings, excluding the trivial one-letter palindromes \u2013 otherwise all strings would be palstars.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was installed on 16 July 1758.\nHis pontificate was overshadowed by the constant pressure to suppress the Society of Jesus but despite this, he championed their order and also proved to be their greatest defender at that time. He was also one of the few early popes who favoured dialogue with Protestants and to this effect hoped to mend the schism with the Catholic Church that existed in England and the Low Countries. These efforts ultimately bore little fruit.\nBiography.\nEarly life.\nCarlo della Torre di Rezzonico was born on 7 March 1693 to a recently ennobled family of Venice, the second of two children of the man who bought the unfinished palace on the Grand Canal (now Ca' Rezzonico) and finished its construction. His parents were Giovanni Battista della Torre di Rezzonico and Vittoria Barbarigo.\nCarlo received a Jesuit education in Bologna and later studied at the University of Padua where he obtained his doctorate in canon law and civil law. From there, he travelled to Rome where he attended the Pontifical Academy of Ecclesiastical Nobles.\nIn 1716 Rezzonico became the Referendary of the Apostolic Signatura and in 1721 was appointed Governor of Fano. He was ordained to the priesthood on 23 December 1731 in Rome. Pope Clement XII appointed him to the cardinalate in 1737 as the Cardinal-Deacon of San Nicola in Carcere. He also filled various important posts in the Roman Curia.\nRezzonico was chosen as Bishop of Padua in 1743 and he received episcopal consecration in Rome by Pope Benedict XIV himself, in the presence of Giuseppe Accoramboni and Cardinal Antonio Saverio Gentili as co-consecrators. Rezzonico visited his diocese on frequent occasions and reformed the way that the diocese ran, paying attention to the social needs of the diocese. He was the first to do this in five decades. He later opted to become the Cardinal-Priest of Santa Maria in Aracoeli in 1747 and later still to become the Cardinal-Priest of San Marco in 1755.\nPontificate.\nElection to the papacy.\nPope Benedict XIV died of gout in 1758 and the College of Cardinals gathered at the papal conclave in order to elect a successor. Direct negotiations between the rival factions resulted in the proposal for the election of Rezzonico. On the evening of 6 July 1758, Rezzonico received 31 votes out of a possible 44, one more than the required amount. He selected the pontifical name of \"Clement XIII\" in honor of Pope Clement XII, who had elevated him to the cardinalate. Rezzonico was crowned as pontiff on 16 July 1758 by the protodeacon, Cardinal Alessandro Albani.\nActions.\nNotwithstanding the meekness and affability of his upright and moderate character, he was modest to a fault (he had the classical sculptures in the Vatican provided with mass-produced fig leaves) and generous with his extensive private fortune. He also permitted vernacular translations of the Bible in Catholic countries.\nThe Jesuits.\nClement XIII's pontificate was repeatedly disturbed by disputes respecting the pressures to suppress the Jesuits coming from the progressive Enlightenment circles of the \"philosophes\" in France.\nClement XIII placed the \"Encyclop\u00e9die\" of D'Alembert and Diderot on the \"Index,\" but this index was not as effective as it had been in the previous century. More unexpected resistance came from the less progressive courts of Spain, Naples &amp; Sicily, and Portugal. In 1758 the reforming minister of Joseph I of Portugal (1750\u201377), the Marquis of Pombal, expelled the Jesuits from Portugal, and transported them all to Civitavecchia, as a \"gift for the Pope.\" In 1760, Pombal sent the papal nuncio home and recalled the Portuguese ambassador from the Vatican. The pamphlet titled the \"Brief Relation\", which claimed the Jesuits had created their own sovereign independent kingdom in South America and tyrannised the Native Americans, all in the interest of an insatiable ambition and avarice, did damage to the Jesuit cause as well.\nOn 8 November 1760, Clement XIII issued a papal bull \"Quantum ornamenti\", which approved the request of King Charles III of Spain to invoke the Immaculate Conception as the Patroness of Spain, along with its eastern and western territories, while continuing to recognize Saint James the Greater as co-patron.\nIn France, the Parlement of Paris, with its strong upper bourgeois background and Jansenist sympathies, began its campaign to expel the Jesuits from France in the spring of 1761, and the published excerpts from Jesuit writings, the \"Extrait des assertions\", provided anti-Jesuit ammunition (though, arguably, many of the statements the \"Extrait\" contained were made to look worse than they were through judicious omission of context). Though a congregation of bishops assembled at Paris in December 1761 recommended no action, Louis XV (1715\u201374) promulgated a royal order permitting the Society to remain in France, with the proviso that certain essentially liberalising changes in their institution satisfy the Parlement with a French Jesuit vicar-general who would be independent of the general in Rome. When the Parlement by the \"arr\u00eat\" of 2 August 1762 suppressed the Jesuits in France and imposed untenable conditions on any who remained in the country, Clement XIII protested against this invasion of the Church's rights and annulled the \"arr\u00eats\". Louis XV's ministers could not permit such an abrogation of French law, and the King finally expelled the Jesuits in November 1764.\nClement XIII warmly espoused the Jesuit order in a papal bull \"Apostolicum pascendi\", 7 January 1765, which dismissed criticisms of the Jesuits as calumnies and praised the order's usefulness; it was largely ignored: by 1768 the Jesuits had been expelled from France, Naples &amp; Sicily and Parma. In Spain, they appeared to be safe, but Charles III (1759\u201388), aware of the drawn-out contentions in Bourbon France, decided on a more peremptory efficiency. During the night of 2\u20133 April 1767, all the Jesuit houses of Spain were suddenly surrounded, the inhabitants arrested, shipped to the ports in the clothes they were wearing and bundled onto ships for Civitavecchia. The King's letter to Clement XIII promised that his allowance of 100 \"piastres\" each year would be withdrawn for the whole order, should any one of them venture at any time to write anything in self-defence or in criticism of the motives for the expulsion, motives that he refused to discuss, then or in the future.\nMuch the same fate awaited them in the territories of the Bourbon Philip, Duke of Parma, who was advised by the liberal minister Guillaume du Tillot. In 1768, Clement XIII issued a strong protest (\"monitorium\") against the policy of the Parmese government. The question of the investiture of Parma (technically a Papal fief), aggravated the Pope's troubles. The Bourbon kings espoused their relative's quarrel, seized Avignon, Benevento and Pontecorvo, and united in a peremptory demand for the total suppression of the Jesuits (January 1769).\nDriven to extremes, Clement XIII consented to call a consistory to consider the step, but on the very eve of the day set for its meeting he died, not without suspicion of poison, of which, however, there appears to be no conclusive evidence.\nEcumenism.\nClement XIII made attempts at engaging with Protestants. This made little progress since Clement refused to compromise on doctrine with Protestants.\nIn support of this policy, he recognised the Hanoverians as Kings of Great Britain despite the long-term residence in Rome of the Catholic House of Stuart. When James Francis Edward Stuart aka James III died in 1766, Clement refused to recognise his son Charles Edward Stuart as Charles III, despite the objections of his brother Cardinal Henry Benedict Stuart.\nOther activities.\nClement XIII created 52 new cardinals in seven consistories in his pontificate. The pope created his nephew Carlo as a cardinal in his first consistory and later created Antonio Ganganelli\u2014who would succeed him as Pope Clement XIV\u2014as a cardinal.\nThe pope approved the cultus for several individuals: Andrew of Montereale and Vincent Kadlubek on 18 February 1764, Angelus Agostini Mazzinghi on 7 March 1761, Anthony Neyrot on 22 February 1767, Agostino Novello in 1759, Elizabeth of Reute on 19 July 1766, James Bertoni in 1766, Francesco Marinoni on 5 December 1764, Mattia de Nazarei on 27 July 1765, Sebastian Maggi on 15 April 1760 and Angela Merici on 30 April 1768. He formally beatified Beatrix of Este the Elder on 19 November 1763, Bernard of Corleone on 15 May 1768, and Gregorio Barbarigo on 6 July 1761.\nClement XIII canonized four saints in his pontificate: Jerome Emiliani, Joseph Calasanz, Joseph of Cupertino, and Seraphin of Montegranaro on 16 July 1767.\nDeath.\nClement XIII died during the night of 2 February 1769 in Rome. He had participated in the solemnities to mark the Feast of the Purification of Mary, and was noted to have participated with much fervor that would indicate good health. After lunch, he had a series of audiences, though did not leave the palace due to the exceptionally cold weather that had marred that week. He later received his nephew in an audience and then met with the Cardinal Secretary of State before he would dine with his nephew, Abondio Rezzonico, the senator of Rome. However, as the pope was getting ready for bed after reciting the evening prayers with his aide drawing off his stockings, he suddenly collapsed on his bed, exclaiming, \"O God, O God, what pain!\" The doctor, immediately summoned, tried blood-letting, but Clement XIII died quickly with blood gurgling in his mouth at around 5:15pm. It is generally believed that the pope experienced an aneurysm of a blood vessel near the heart. \nHe was laid to rest on 8 February 1769 in the Vatican but his remains were transferred on 27 September 1774 to a monument in the Vatican that had been sculpted by Antonio Canova at the request of Senator Abbondio Rezzonico, the nephew of the late pontiff.\nHe was described in the \"Annual Register\" for 1758 as \"the honestest man in the world; a most exemplary ecclesiastic; of the purest morals; devout, steady, learned, diligent...\"\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "24149", "revid": "1427850", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24149", "title": "Pope Clement XIV", "text": "Head of the Catholic Church from 1769 to 1774\nPope Clement XIV (; ; 31 October 1705\u00a0\u2013 22 September 1774), born Giovanni Vincenzo Antonio Ganganelli, was head of the Catholic Church and ruler of the Papal States from 19 May 1769 to his death in September 1774. At the time of his election, he was the only Franciscan friar in the College of Cardinals, having been a member of the Order of Friars Minor Conventual. He is the most recent pope to take the pontifical name of \"Clement\" upon his election.\nDuring his pontificate, Clement decreed the suppression of the Society of Jesus.\nEarly life.\nGanganelli was born in Santarcangelo di Romagna in 1705 as the second child of Lorenzo Ganganelli, born in 1647, a physician originary from Borgo Pace in the Duchy of Urbino, and Angela Serafina Maria Mazzi (or Macci), a noblewoman from Pesaro, and paternal grandson of Alessandro Ganganelli and wife Porzia Franceschi. He received the sacrament of baptism on 2 November 1705 at the parish church of Sant'Agata.\nGanganelli initially studied at Verucchio but later received his education from the Society of Jesus at Rimini from 1717. He also studied with the Piarists of Urbino. Ganganelli entered the Order of Friars Minor Conventual on 15 May 1723 in Forl\u00ec, taking the name Lorenzo Francesco. He did his novitiate in Urbino where his cousin Vincenzo was a friar. He was professed as a full member of that order on 18 May 1724. He was sent to the convents of Pesaro, Fano, and Recanati from 1724 to 1728 where he did his theological studies. He continued his studies in Rome under Antonio Lucci and obtained his doctorate in theology in 1731.\nPriesthood and cardinalate.\nGanganelli was ordained around this time after he received his doctorate and he taught philosophy and theology for almost a decade in Ascoli, Bologna, and Milan. He later returned to Rome as the regent of the college that he studied at and was later elected as the Definitor General of the order in 1741. In the general chapters of his order in 1753 and 1756, he declined the generalship of his order and some rumored it was due to his desire of a higher office.\nGanganelli became a friend of Pope Benedict XIV, who in 1758 appointed him to investigate the issue of the traditional blood libel regarding the Jews, which Ganganelli found to be untrue.\nPope Clement XIII elevated Ganganelli to the cardinalate on 24 September 1759 and appointed him as the Cardinal-Priest of San Lorenzo in Panisperna. His elevation came at the insistence of Lorenzo Ricci, who was the Superior-General of the Society of Jesus.\nGanganelli opted to become the Cardinal-Priest of Santi Apostoli in 1762. In 1768 he was named the \"ponens\" of the cause of beatification of Juan de Palafox y Mendoza.\nElection to the papacy.\nPolitical pressures.\nThe papal conclave in 1769 was almost completely dominated by the problem of the Society of Jesus. During the previous pontificate, the Jesuits had been expelled from Portugal and from all the courts of the House of Bourbon, which included France, Spain, Naples &amp; Sicily, and Parma. In January, 1769, these powers made a formal demand for the dissolution of the Society. Clement XIII had planned a consistory to discuss the matter, but died on 2 February, the night before it was to be held.\nNow the general suppression of the order was urged by the faction called the \"court cardinals\", who were opposed by the diminished pro-Jesuit faction, the \"Zelanti\" (\"zealous\"), who were generally opposed to the encroaching secularism of the Enlightenment. Much of the early activity was \"pro forma\" as the members waited for the arrival of those cardinals who had indicated that they would attend. The conclave had been sitting since 15 February 1769, heavily influenced by the political maneuvers of the ambassadors of Catholic sovereigns who were opposed to the Jesuits.\nSome of the pressure was subtle. On 15 March, Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor (1765\u201390) visited Rome to join his brother Leopold, the Grand Duke of Tuscany, who had arrived on 6 March. The next day, after touring St. Peter's Basilica, they took advantage of the conclave doors being opened to admit Cardinal Girolamo Spinola to enter as well. They were shown, upon the Emperor's request, the ballots, the chalice into which they would be placed, and where they would later be burned. That evening Gaetano Duca Cesarini hosted a party. It was the middle of Passion Week.\nThe minister of King Louis XV (1715\u201374), the duc de Choiseul, had extensive experience dealing with the church as the French ambassador to the Holy See and was Europe's most skilled diplomat. \"When one has a favour to ask of a Pope\", he wrote, \"and one is determined to obtain it, one must ask for two\". Choiseul's suggestion was advanced to the other ambassadors and it was that they should press, in addition to the Jesuit issue, territorial claims upon the Patrimony of Saint Peter, including the return of Avignon and the Comtat Venaissin to France, the duchies of Benevento and Pontecorvo to Spain, an extension of territory adjoining the Papal States to Naples, and an immediate and final settlement of the vexed question of Parma and Piacenza that had occasioned a diplomatic rift between Austria and Pope Clement XIII.\nElection.\nBy 18 May, the court coalition appeared to be unravelling as the respective representatives began to negotiate separately with different cardinals. The French ambassador had earlier suggested that any acceptable candidate be required to put in writing that he would abolish the Jesuits. The idea was largely dismissed as a violation of canon law. Spain still insisted that a firm commitment should be given, though not necessarily in writing. However, such concessions could be immediately nullified by the pope upon election. On 19 May 1769, Cardinal Ganganelli was elected as a compromise candidate largely due to support of the Bourbon courts, which had expected that he would suppress the Society of Jesus. Ganganelli, who had been educated by Jesuits, gave no commitment, but indicated that he thought the dissolution was possible. He took the pontifical name of \"Clement XIV\". Ganganelli first received episcopal consecration in the Vatican on 28 May 1769 by Cardinal Federico Marcello Lante and was crowned as pope on 4 June 1769 by the cardinal protodeacon Alessandro Albani. He was replaced as Cardinal-Priest by Buenaventura Fern\u00e1ndez de C\u00f3rdoba Sp\u00ednola.\nHe took possession of the Archbasilica of Saint John Lateran on 26 November 1769.\nPontificate.\nClement XIV's policies were calculated from the outset to smooth the breaches with the Catholic crowns that had developed during the previous pontificate. The dispute between the temporal and the spiritual Catholic authorities was perceived as a threat by Church authority, and Clement XIV worked towards reconciliation with the European sovereigns. By yielding the papal claims to Parma, Clement XIV obtained the restitution of Avignon and Benevento and in general he succeeded in placing the relations of the spiritual and the temporal authorities on a friendlier footing. The pontiff went on to suppress the Jesuits, writing the decree to this effect in November 1772 and signing it on 21 July 1773.\nRelations with the Jews.\nHis accession was welcomed by the Jewish community who trusted that the man who, as councilor of the Holy Office, declared them, in a memorandum issued 21 March 1758, innocent of the slanderous blood accusation, would be no less just and humane toward them on the throne of Catholicism. Assigned by Pope Benedict XIV to investigate a charge against the Jews of Yanopol, Poland, Ganganelli not only refuted the claim, but showed that most of the similar claims since the thirteenth century were groundless. He deferred somewhat on the already beatified Simon of Trent, in 1475, and Andreas of Rinn, but took the length of time before their beatifications as indicative that the veracity of the accusations raised significant doubts.\nSuppression of the Jesuits.\nThe Jesuits had been expelled from Brazil (1754), Portugal (1759), France (1764), Spain and its colonies (1767), and Parma (1768). With the accession of a new pope, the Bourbon monarchs pressed for the Society's total suppression. Clement XIV tried to placate their enemies by apparent unfriendly treatment of the Jesuits: he refused to meet the superior general, Lorenzo Ricci, removed it from the administration of the Irish and Roman Colleges, and ordered them not to receive novices, etc.\nThe pressure kept building up to the point that Catholic countries were threatening to break away from the Church. Clement XIV ultimately yielded \"in the name of peace of the Church and to avoid a secession in Europe\" and suppressed the Society of Jesus by the brief \"Dominus ac Redemptor\" of 21 July 1773. However, in non-Catholic nations, particularly in Prussia and Russia, where papal authority was not recognized, the order was ignored. It was a result of a series of political moves rather than a theological controversy.\nMozart.\nPope Clement XIV and the customs of the Catholic Church in Rome are described in letters of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and of his father Leopold Mozart, written from Rome in April and May 1770 during their tour of Italy. Leopold found the upper clergy offensively haughty, but was received, with his son, by the pope, where Wolfgang demonstrated an amazing feat of musical memory. The papal chapel was famous for performing a \"Miserere mei, Deus\" by the 17th-century composer Gregorio Allegri, whose music was not to be copied outside of the chapel on pain of excommunication. The 14-year-old Wolfgang was able to transcribe the composition in its entirety after a single hearing. Clement made the young Mozart a knight of the Order of the Golden Spur.\nSimilarly, in 1774 German composer, Georg Joseph Vogler was also made a Knight of the Order of the Golden Spur.\nActivities.\nClement XIV elevated sixteen new cardinals into the cardinalate in twelve consistories including Giovanni Angelo Braschi, who succeeded him as Pope Pius VI.\nThe pope held no canonizations in his pontificate but he beatified a number of individuals.\nDeath and burial.\nThe last months of Clement XIV's life were embittered by his failures and he seemed always to be in sorrow because of this. His work was hardly accomplished before Clement XIV, whose usual constitution was quite vigorous, fell into a languishing sickness, generally attributed to poison. No conclusive evidence of poisoning was ever produced. The claims that the Pope was poisoned were denied by those closest to him, and as \"The Annual Register\" for 1774 stated, he was over 70 and had been in ill health for some time.\nOn 10 September 1774, he was bedridden and received Extreme Unction on 21 September 1774. It is said that St. Alphonsus Liguori assisted Clement XIV in his last hours by the gift of bilocation and was during two days in extasis in his bishopric in Arienzo.\nClement XIV died on 22 September 1774, execrated by the Ultramontane party but widely mourned by his subjects for his popular administration of the Papal States. When his body was opened for the autopsy, the doctors ascribed his death to scorbutic and hemorrhoidal dispositions of long standing that were aggravated by excessive labour and the habit of provoking artificial perspiration even in the greatest heat. His Neoclassical style tomb was designed and sculpted by Antonio Canova, and it is found in the church of Santi Apostoli, Rome. To this day, he is best remembered for his suppression of the Jesuits.\nThe \"Monthly Review\" spoke highly of Ganganelli. In a review of a \"Sketch of the Life and Government of Pope Clement XIV\", the 1786 \"English Review\" said it was clearly written by an ex-Jesuit and noted the malignant characterization of a man it described as \"...a liberal, affable, ingenious man; \u2026a politician enlarged in his views, and equally bold and dexterous in the means, by which he executed his designs.\"\nThe 1876 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica says that:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;[N]o Pope has better merited the title of a virtuous man, or has given a more perfect example of integrity, unselfishness, and aversion to nepotism. Notwithstanding his monastic education, he proved himself a statesman, a scholar, an amateur of physical science, and an accomplished man of the world. As Pope Leo X (1513\u201321) indicates the manner in which the Papacy might have been reconciled with the Renaissance had the Reformation never taken place, so Ganganelli exemplifies the type of Pope which the modern world might have learned to accept if the movement towards free thought could, as Voltaire wished, have been confined to the aristocracy of intellect. In both cases the requisite condition was unattainable; neither in the 16th nor in the 18th century has it been practicable to set bounds to the spirit of inquiry otherwise than by fire and sword, and Ganganelli's successors have been driven into assuming a position analogous to that of Popes Paul IV (1555\u201359) and Pius V (1566\u201372) in the age of the Reformation. The estrangement between the secular and the spiritual authority which Ganganelli strove to avert is now irreparable, and his pontificate remains an exceptional episode in the general history of the Papacy, and a proof how little the logical sequence of events can be modified by the virtues and abilities of an individual.\nJacques Cr\u00e9tineau-Joly, however, wrote a critical history of the Pope's administration.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The prime minister advises the sovereign on the exercise of much of the royal prerogative, chairs the Cabinet, and selects its ministers. Modern prime ministers hold office by virtue of their ability to command the confidence of the House of Commons, so they are invariably members of Parliament.\nThe office of prime minister is not established by any statute or constitutional document, but exists only by long-established convention, whereby the monarch appoints as prime minister the person most likely to command the confidence of the House of Commons. In practice, this is the leader of the political party that holds the largest number of seats in the Commons. The prime minister is \"ex officio\" also First Lord of the Treasury (an office often associated with the premiership between 1721 and 1895, after 1902 always united to it, and, after 1905, an official title of the position), Minister for the Civil Service, the minister responsible for national security, and Minister for the Union. The prime minister's official residence and office is 10 Downing Street in London.\nEarly conceptions of the office of prime minister evolved as the \"primus inter pares\" (\"first among equals\"); however that does not differentiate on status and responsibility upon whoever is holding office. Historically, the prime minister has never been the first among equals at any time prior to 1868. Until now, that characterisation of the prime minister is reflective of the democratic nature of their position. The power of the prime minister depends on the support of their respective party and on the popular mandate. The appointment of cabinet ministers and granting of honours are done through the prime minister's power of appointment. The prime minister alongside the cabinet proposes new legislation and decides on key policies that fit their agenda which are then passed by an act of parliament.\nThe power of the office of prime minister has grown significantly since the first prime minister, Robert Walpole in 1721. Prime ministerial power evolved gradually alongside the office itself which have played an increasingly prominent role in British politics since the early 20th century. During the premierships of Margaret Thatcher and Tony Blair, prime ministerial power expanded substantially, and their leaderships in the office were described as \"presidential\" due to their personal wielding of power and tight control over the cabinet. The prime minister is one of the world's most powerful political leaders in modern times. As the leader of the world's sixth largest economy, the prime minister holds significant domestic and international leadership, being the leader of a prominent member state of NATO, the G7 and G20.\nAs of 2025[ [update]], 58 people (55 men and 3 women) have served as prime minister, the first of whom was Robert Walpole taking office on 3 April 1721. The longest-serving prime minister was also Walpole, who served over 20 years, and the shortest-serving was Liz Truss, who served seven weeks. Keir Starmer succeeded Rishi Sunak as prime minister on 5 July 2024, following the 2024 general election.\nHistory.\nOrigins: 1689\u20131742.\nThe position of prime minister was not created but evolved slowly and organically over three hundred years due to numerous Acts of Parliament, political developments, and accidents of history. Therefore, the office is rarely found in any statute and according to the Political and Constitutional Reform Committee in 2014: \"It is impossible to point to a single point in history when the post was created or even a decision to create it.\"\nThe 17th century saw a transformative period in British history. The Union of the Scottish and English crowns followed by the Wars of the Three Kingdoms, including the English Civil War, saw the final conflict between the Monarchy and the parliaments (of England and Scotland) over governance, culminating in the end of absolute monarchy with the execution of Charles I in 1649. In 1660, the Monarchy was restored with the ascension of Charles II signalling a return to royal rule but with growing limitations. The Glorious Revolution of 1688\u20131689 led to the deposition of the Catholic James II and the establishment of William III and Mary II as constitutional monarchs. After a series of bills passed by the parliaments, such as the Bill of Rights and Claim of Right in 1689, the powers of the monarch were reduced, being replaced by the powers of parliament. The Bill of Rights established the supremacy of Parliament over the Crown and set up certain civil rights. During this period, Parliaments were dominated by two political factions: the Whigs and the Tories. The Whigs supported parliamentary sovereignty and constitutional monarchy while the Tories favoured the divine right of kings and the deposed James II. These two groups were considered by some to be \"embryonic political parties.\"\nThe resulting English Constitution established in 1689 gave the English Parliament the power over the \"purse\" or the Treasury. The monarch who now could commit to and follow agreed policy allowed Parliament to pursue and fund its own policies without any fear of diversion of the funds. By this point, the Monarch was forced by incentive to cede power to Parliament under the credible threat of removal of any who ignored the Constitution. \nActs of Union in 1707 formed the Kingdom of Great Britain, with the Parliament of Great Britain the head of Treasury, as Lord Treasurer, was given the power following Standing Order Number 66 to draft money bills (budgets) instead of MPs outside of government. The informal term 'prime minister' was first recorded around that time, which since 1721 had mostly also been the office holder for the First Lord of the Treasury. The First Lord of the Treasury is one of the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury. This role is usually held by the prime minister. The role of prime minister grew more distinct as the head of government and often more recognisable within the public than other members of the cabinet, which demonstrates the increasing power of the prime minister in modern times than that originally created.\nFollowing the death of Queen Anne in 1714, Parliament invited George Louis, Prince Elector of Hanover, to become king. During his reign, he was unpopular partly due to his limited English proficiency and lack of interest in governing, a role he largely left to his ministers. In 1720, the South Sea bubble, a financial crisis stemming from speculative investments, led to economic turmoil. The collapse implicated many government officials. With schisms within the Whigs Party led to the fall of Stanhope\u2013Sunderland ministry. Subsequently, Sir Robert Walpole, who was serving as Paymaster of the Forces, was appointed First Lord of the Treasury in 1721. Sir Robert Walpole was the first prime minister of the United Kingdom, though his predecessors as First Lord of the Treasury also held a similar position. Walpole is considered the first \"de facto prime minister\" due to his influence over policy and control of government affairs. He was not, in the modern sense, \"prime minister\". This was due to the position being not formally recognised by any legal fixture and also due to the position originally being used as a term of abuse.\nWalpole served as prime minister from 1721 to 1742. The time during his premiership was dubbed by historians as the \"Robinocracy\". His financial abilities in handling the repercussions in the aftermath of the South Sea Bubble earned him the support of commercial and landed interests, pursued a largely peaceful foreign policy, lowered taxes and reduced national debt while his skilful management of Commons affairs solidified his dominance in Parliament by operating as a \"Screen-Master General\", pulling strings and sullying favour whenever necessary. Walpole's policy was to maintain the status quo and despite not passing any major reforms, Walpole provided the country with much-needed stability after a century of turmoil. His time in office was crucial in shifting political power to the House of Commons and laying the foundations for the modern Cabinet system. Despite being able to successfully hold power for 20 years, Walpole faced fierce opposition over alleged bribery and corruption in Parliament and following a disastrous war with Spain, he resigned in 1742 and was succeeded by the Earl of Wilmington.\nDevelopment: 1742\u20131945.\nFollowing the resignation of Walpole, a swift string of ministries followed and between 1742 and 1760 there were five separate governments. Spencer Compton, Earl of Wilmington was made prime minister. However, Wilmington served for a brief time and was head of government by name only. The government continued to be dominated by internal struggles over Britain's participation in the War of the Austrian Succession and royal intervention in policy making. In 1743, Henry Pelham became prime minister and sought to expel ministers, particularly Lord Carteret, who sought to undermine the authority of the new ministry.\nPowers and authority.\nExecutive powers.\nThe prime minister is the head of the United Kingdom government. As such, the modern prime minister leads the Cabinet (the Executive). In addition, the prime minister leads a major political party and generally commands a majority in the House of Commons (the lower chamber of Parliament). The incumbent wields both significant legislative and executive powers. Under the British system, there is a unity of powers rather than separation. John Morley described the office of prime minister as the \"keystone of the Cabinet arch\" that maintained while the prime minister can hold significant power over the executive, it is often exercised collectively through the Cabinet (government).\nMinisterial responsibility is also an aspect of a prime minister's executive authority. The prime minister leads the cabinet which makes the holder of that office bear responsibility for the collective conduct of the government. Professor Rodney Brazier points out that the since the prime minister wields significant sway over policy, that power must be subjected to the conclusion and input of Cabinet ministers. This prevents the office of prime minister from becoming more dominant and also ensures that executive power is authorised with broader support from and within the government. The prime minister must constantly maintain the confidence of the House of Commons because, as Bagehot notes, the power of the prime minister derives from their ability to command a majority in the House to pass legislation and continue the functions of government. If a prime minister loses the confidence of the House, which occurs in a vote of no confidence, they are often expected to resign from office or request the monarch dissolve parliament to call a general election.\nThe prime minister acts as the principal advisor to the monarch, who is the head of state, a capacity that has evolved gradually during the history of the office. Bagehot says that despite the monarch holding certain theoretical executive powers, in practice, these powers are often executed upon the advice and recommendation of the prime minister and the cabinet. This is considered a major principle of the \"unity of powers\" that exists within a constitutional monarchy in which the monarch \"reigns but does not rule\". According to Brazier, the prime minister advises the monarch on matters such as the dissolution of parliament and appointments to the House of Lords, but these decisions are often made with the consent of parliament.\nThe prime minister leads the executive in directing government policy and maintaining coordination between government departments which is dependent upon the cooperation and consent of ministers. Foreign policy and national security are areas in which the prime minister has traditionally enjoyed more authority under what are known as prerogative powers. Vernon Bogdanor argues that the abilities to declare war, negotiate treaties and deploy the armed forces have historically been part of the monarch's royal authority but have slowly evolved into a function of the office of prime minister. Despite this, the exercise of the prime minister's prerogative powers in these matters is under the oversight of parliament. It is often by convention that a prime minister must seek the approval of parliament before committing the nation to military action. In addition to this, the prime minister also exerts informal influence over public policy. Brazier notes this is due to the prime minister often being the leader of the largest party in government, therefore having a direct impact in initiating policy both in government and during election campaigns.\nLegislative powers.\nIn the House of Commons, the prime minister guides the law-making process with the goal of enacting the legislative agenda of their political party. In an executive capacity, the prime minister appoints (and may dismiss) all other Cabinet members and ministers, and co-ordinates the policies and activities of all government departments, and the staff of the Civil Service. The prime minister also acts as the public \"face\" and \"voice\" of His Majesty's Government, both at home and abroad. Solely upon the advice of the prime minister, the sovereign exercises many statutory and prerogative powers, including high judicial, political, official and Church of England ecclesiastical appointments; the conferral of peerages and some knighthoods, decorations and other important honours.\nBagehot identifies the prime minister as the head of the \"efficient\" part of government that functions within the government to steer legislation through both Houses of Parliament. Although the prime minister does not possess the power to introduce legislation directly, their control of the cabinet and their role as leader of the largest political party in the House of Commons enables them substantial influence over any legislative agenda. Bagehot points out that this power is based on the prime minister's ability to operate the \"machinery of government\" that allows them to guide legislation that align with their party's political and ideological priorities. Brazier argues that the legislative power of the prime minister has greatly expanded following the post-war period and that as a result, the prime minister now directly authorises supervision over government bills and has a consequential role in the introduction of legislation.\nThe prime minister is able to wield considerable power in the passing of legislation through their ability to manage party discipline and cohesion in voting patterns. Bogdanor states that this largely depends upon the prime minister being the leader of the largest party in the Commons, which can pass legislation without any or little resistance if they can command the confidence of the House. This aspect of prime ministerial power is informal and often carried out by the office of Whips, who makes sure that MPs remain loyal and vote on the government line. The political scientist Anthony King said that the prime minister's influence over legislation is further solidified through their ability to shape policy before it reaches Parliament. King further argued that the shaping of legislation, on many occasions, involves the collaborative efforts of cabinet ministers and civil servants, but the prime minister's approval is needed to initiate the legislative agenda. King's analysis of contemporary politics showed that some prime ministers often bypass or overrule the cabinet on traditional discussion and to push through their preferred agendas with notable cases such as Margaret Thatcher and Tony Blair.\nParliamentary powers.\nThe prime minister's influence in the Houses of Parliament is derived from longstanding conventions and statutes that have gradually evolved through the centuries. The office of prime minister itself is not explicitly mentioned in parliamentary law but is developed by constitutional conventions and therefore it is defined by precedent and tradition. Bogdanor notes that the prime minister's power in parliament is exhibited by their control of the executive (the Cabinet) and their ability to influence the legislative agenda. The ability of the prime minister to influence legislation, according to academic Philip Norton, is often through party discipline and having a reliable majority of MPs who vote in support of the government's priorities.\nAnother essential part of the parliamentary powers possessed by the prime minister is determining the composition of the Cabinet. According to Professor Robert Hazell, the prime minister not only chooses cabinet members but also dictates the collective decision-making process of members as well. The prime minister most often would chair cabinet meetings and may determine their frequency, thereby controlling the agenda for policy and steering decisions in their preferred direction. Additionally, the prime minister can exercise considerable control over parliamentary time. Authors Alexander Horne and Gavin Drewry state that the prime minister uses this power through the Leader of the House of Commons, by which they are able to allocate time for government bills and often ensuring access to this time over private members' bills.\nThe prime minister's parliamentary powers also extend to foreign relations. Contemporary historian Anthony Seldon says that the prime minister acts as the main representative of the government in the international sphere, including in parliament, where treaties are ratified and international commitments are debated.\nPrerogative powers.\nThe most significant powers given to the prime minister are \"prerogative powers\". These are a set of constitutional privileges deriving from monarchial authority that have gradually evolved into tools of executive power managed by the prime minister and the government. Bagehot famously called the British system as one where \"the executive power is now yielded by the prime minister\" rather than the monarch, a shift from personal to political power. Prerogative powers allow the prime minister to act without the immediate or direct consent of parliament especially in circumstances such as declaring war, deployment of troops and the granting of honours.\nBrazier argues that prerogative powers allow the prime minister to act within the \"authority of the crown\" in situations where neither convention nor statutory law applies. As noted by both Bagehot and Brazier, areas in which the prime minister authorises their given prerogative powers are matters of foreign affairs. In recent occasions, the 2003 invasion of Iraq saw Prime Minister Tony Blair deploying British troops to Saudi Arabia without the immediate consent or approval of parliament. Brazier says the rise of parliamentary and public scrutiny has led to calls for reform and checks on the use of prerogative powers. The only prime minister who did not seek parliamentary or legal consent for military action was Anthony Eden during the Suez Crisis in 1956.\nProfessors Mark Elliot and Robert Thomas argue that prerogative powers present a constitutional anomaly in the 21st century. Both contend that such powers lack direct democratic legitimacy due to not being regulated by parliamentary statutes and raise concerns over accountability. Elliot and Thomas have pointed out that judicial intervention in cases such as Miller I and Miller II, where the Supreme Court exercised scrutiny over the use of prerogative powers by the government to prorogue parliament during the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union, was successful in keeping check over the authority of both the prime minister and the government. The evolving usage of prerogative powers also has signalled tension between tradition and accountability. Authors Paul Craig and Adam Tomkins state that the absence of a written constitution gives a prime minister greater leeway in employing their given prerogative powers without limits that in turn would create uncertainty although the use of such powers by the prime minister is often constrained by political convention than by law.\nConstitutional background.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Hlist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe British system of government is based on an uncodified constitution, meaning that it is not set out in any single document. The British constitution consists of many documents, and most importantly for the evolution of the office of the prime minister, it is based on customs known as constitutional conventions that became accepted practice. In 1928, Prime Minister H. H. Asquith described this characteristic of the British constitution in his memoirs:In this country we live ... under an unwritten Constitution. It is true that we have on the Statute-book great instruments like Magna Carta, the Petition of Right, and the Bill of Rights which define and secure many of our rights and privileges; but the great bulk of our constitutional liberties and ... our constitutional practices do not derive their validity and sanction from any Bill which has received the formal assent of the King, Lords and Commons. They rest on usage, custom, convention, often of slow growth in their early stages, not always uniform, but which in the course of time received universal observance and respect.\nThe relationships between the prime minister and the sovereign, Parliament and Cabinet are defined largely by these unwritten conventions of the constitution. Many of the prime minister's executive and legislative powers are actually royal prerogatives which are still formally vested in the sovereign, who remains the head of state. Despite its growing dominance in the constitutional hierarchy, the premiership was given little formal recognition until the 20th century; the legal fiction was maintained that the sovereign still governed directly. The position was first mentioned in statute only in 1917, in the schedule of the Chequers Estate Act. Increasingly during the 20th century, the office and role of prime minister featured in statute law and official documents; however, the prime minister's powers and relationships with other institutions still largely continue to derive from ancient royal prerogatives and historic and modern constitutional conventions. Prime ministers continue to hold the position of First Lord of the Treasury and, since November 1968, that of Minister for the Civil Service, the latter giving them authority over the civil service.\nUnder this arrangement, Britain might appear to have two executives: the prime minister and the sovereign. The concept of \"the Crown\" resolves this paradox. The Crown symbolises the state's authority to govern: to make laws and execute them, impose taxes and collect them, declare war and make peace. Before the \"Glorious Revolution\" of 1688, the sovereign exclusively wielded the powers of the Crown; afterwards, Parliament gradually forced monarchs to assume a neutral political position. Parliament has effectively dispersed the powers of the Crown, entrusting its authority to responsible ministers (the prime minister and Cabinet), accountable for their policies and actions to Parliament, in particular the elected House of Commons.\nAlthough many of the sovereign's prerogative powers are still legally intact, constitutional conventions have removed the monarch from day-to-day governance, with ministers exercising the royal prerogatives, leaving the monarch in practice with three constitutional rights: to be kept informed, to advise and to warn.\nModern premiership.\nAppointment.\nIn modern times, much of the process involving prime ministerial appointments is informally governed by constitutional conventions and with the rules and processes described by authoritative sources such as The Cabinet Manual.\nThe prime minister is appointed by the monarch, through the exercise of the royal prerogative. In the past, the monarch has used personal choice to dismiss or appoint a prime minister (the last time being in 1834), but it is now the convention that the monarch should not be drawn into party politics. Bogdanor states that throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, the monarch often appointed the prime minister based on their personal preference, regardless of whether they have great or little public support.\nIf a prime minister (incumbent or otherwise) leads their party to victory in a general election and gains an overall majority in the House of Commons, they will be invited by the monarch to form a new government. Following the invitation, the prime minister will be driven to Buckingham Palace to meet the monarch. The meeting between the monarch and the incoming prime minister is a moment for the latter to pledge their loyalty to the monarch and be invited to form a new government. The prime minister is expected to bow before the monarch in a ceremony known as \"kissing hands\". Following this, the prime minister is officially appointed the head of His Majesty's government.\nThe prime minister \"...holds that position by virtue of his or her ability to command the confidence of the House of Commons, which in turn commands the confidence of the electorate, as expressed through a general election.\" By convention, the prime minister is also an MP and is normally the leader of the political party that commands a majority in the House of Commons.\nPrime Minister's Office.\nThe Prime Minister's Office helps the prime minister to 'establish and deliver the government's overall strategy and policy priorities, and to communicate the government's policies to Parliament, the public and international audiences'. The Prime Minister's Office is formally part of the Cabinet Office, but the boundary between its work and that of the wider Cabinet Office can be unclear; the wider Cabinet Office might carry out very similar work. Peter Hennessy has claimed that this overall arrangement means there is in fact effectively a Prime Minister's Department, though it is not called this.\nThe Prime Minister's Office was officially created in 1916 by David Lloyd George during World War I, which marked the first formal recognition of the office of prime minister and established it as an independent institution from other entities within government, with staff to support the coordination of government policy. This development came as a response to the demands of wartime governance, as Lloyd George's leadership needed a more centred and efficient executive function.\nPrime Minister's Questions.\nPrime Minister's Questions is a constitutional convention, currently held as a single session every Wednesday at noon when the House of Commons is sitting, in which the prime minister answers questions from members of Parliament (MPs). The leader of the opposition usually asks the prime minister six questions, and the leader of the third-largest parliamentary party can ask two questions. It is an occasion when the prime minister appears regularly on live television and radio.\nBefore the 1880s, oral questions were mainly directed towards cabinet ministers and therefore such questions were regarded as the same even when addressed to the prime minister. The session in its modern form was first introduced on Tuesday 24 October in 1961 when the then prime minister Harold Macmillan answered questions for between 15 minutes from 3.15\u00a0pm to 3.30\u00a0pm as an experiment. Since 1997 PMQs were held every Wednesdays at 3\u00a0pm until 3.30\u00a0pm. In 1989, the first PMQs were broadcast and in 1990 were broadcast live to the public as a step towards transparency and accountability.\nThe timing of PMQs has often changed depending on the varied schedules of prime ministers. In 1881, questions addressed to the prime minister were placed at the end of question time so that the then 72-year-old Prime Minister William Gladstone could arrive late. In 1904, questions were answered only when they reached No 51 and in 1940 they were expanded to No 45. The procedure was in practice until 1953 when PMQs were restricted to Tuesdays and Thursdays only to assist Winston Churchill who was 78-years old.\nThe prime minister also appears before the Liaison Committee to answer questions about public policy.\nSecurity and transport.\nThe personal protection of the prime minister and former prime ministers is the responsibility of Protection Command within the Metropolitan Police Service. When the prime minister resides in 10 Downing Street, they are constantly surrounded by armed police units with \"airport-style\" security checkpoints, large metal gates, street patrols and heavy vetting for staff and non-ministerial individuals. Such installations were introduced due to fears of IRA bomb threats and attacks which were persistent during The Troubles. When travelling, the prime minister will be accompanied by a select group of police officers joined by a wider team of security personnel. On the road, the prime ministerial entourage will be followed by police outriders on motorbikes to clear a path in the traffic and to stop them from being a sitting target. The fleet of prime ministerial cars provides the prime minister with a number of security features as well as transport. The vehicles are driven by officers from this unit. These vehicles are often custom made and always British manufactured with in-built gun ports, an independent oxygen supply and the ability to release tear gas to subdue crowds. Air transport for the prime minister is provided by a variety of military and civilian operators.\nInternational role.\nOne of the roles of the prime minister is to represent the UK at home and abroad, for example at the annual G7 Summit. The prime minister makes many international trips. According to Gus O'Donnell, the number of overseas visits for the prime minister has gone up.\nDeputy.\nPrime ministers have had various deputies, sometimes as an official deputy prime minister, first secretary of state or \"de facto\" deputy. Some prime ministers have not chosen a deputy at all, preferring \"ad hoc\" arrangements.\nHistorically, the position of deputy prime minister has been created out of political necessity rather than being established by statutory law or convention with the title not being defined in the constitution. The position was first created (unofficially) for Clement Attlee in prime minister Winston Churchill's ministry during World War II, to manage administrative duties, domestic affairs and welfare, while Churchill focused on military strategy. In recent times, after the 2010 general election resulted in a hung parliament, the leaders of the Conservative and the Liberal Democrats, David Cameron and Nick Clegg, formed a coalition government in which Clegg served as deputy prime minister. In that capacity, Clegg chaired cabinet meetings, key committees and led negotiations on major reforms. As such, the office saw an unusual level of formalisation and recognition during Clegg's tenure.\nSuccession.\nNobody has the right of automatic succession to the prime ministership. It is generally considered that in the event of the death of the prime minister, it would be appropriate to appoint an interim prime minister, though there is some debate as to how to decide who this should be.\nAccording to Rodney Brazier, there are no procedures within government to cope with the sudden death of the prime minister. There is also no such title as acting prime minister of the United Kingdom. Despite refusing \"...to discuss a hypothetical situation\" with BBC News in 2011, the Cabinet Office said the following in 2006:&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;There is no single protocol setting out all of the possible implications. However, the general constitutional position is as set out below. There can be no automatic assumption about who The Queen would ask to act as caretaker Prime Minister in the event of the death of the Prime Minister. The decision is for her under the Royal Prerogative. However, there are some key guiding principles. The Queen would probably be looking for a very senior member of the Government (not necessarily a Commons Minister since this would be a short-term appointment). If there was a recognised deputy to the Prime Minister, used to acting on his behalf in his absences, this could be an important factor. Also important would be the question of who was likely to be in contention to take over long-term as Prime Minister. If the most senior member of the Government was him or herself a contender for the role of Prime Minister, it might be that The Queen would invite a slightly less senior non-contender. In these circumstances, her private secretary would probably take soundings, via the Cabinet Secretary, of members of the Cabinet, to ensure that The Queen invited someone who would be acceptable to the Cabinet to act as their chair during the caretaker period. Once the Party had elected a new leader, that person would, of course, be invited to take over as Prime Minister.Additionally, when the prime minister is travelling, it is standard practice for a senior duty minister to be appointed who can attend to urgent business and meetings if required, though the prime minister remains in charge and updated throughout.\nOn 6 April 2020, when Boris Johnson was admitted into the Intensive Care Unit of St Thomas' Hospital, when suffering from COVID-19, he asked Dominic Raab \"to deputise for him where necessary\".\nResignation.\nA prime minister ends their tenure by offering their resignation to the British monarch. This can happen after their party has suffered a general election defeat, so that they no longer command the confidence of the House of Commons. It can also happen mid-term, if they are forced to resign for political reasons, or for other reasons such as ill-health. If the prime minister resigns mid-term, and their party has a majority in the Commons, the party selects a new leader according to its rules, and this new leader is invited by the monarch to become the new prime minister. The outgoing prime minister is likely to remain in post until the new leader has been chosen by the party. After resigning, the outgoing prime minister remains a member of Parliament. An outgoing prime minister can ask the monarch to bestow honours on any number of people of their choosing, known as the Prime Minister's Resignation Honours. No incumbent prime minister has ever lost their own seat at a general election. Only one prime minister has been assassinated: Spencer Perceval, in 1812.\nPrivileges.\nOn taking office a new prime minister usually makes a public statement to announce to the country that they have been appointed by the reigning monarch (called \"kissing hands\"). This is usually done by saying words to the effect of:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt; His Majesty the King \"[Her Majesty the Queen]\" has asked me to form a government and I have accepted.\nPrecedence and form of address.\nMinisterial listings are printed in the official records of parliament known as \"Hansard\", and 1885 was the first known instance of official use of the title of prime minister. The minutes of the first meeting of the Committee of Imperial Defence in 1902 saw the first internal reference to the title as well. The 1904 edition of the Imperial Calendar referred to the then prime minister, Arthur Balfour, as 'Prime Minister and First Lord of the Treasury'; in the previous edition he was merely 'First Lord of the Treasury and Lord Privy Seal'.\nThroughout the United Kingdom, the prime minister outranks all other dignitaries except members of the royal family, the lord chancellor, and senior ecclesiastical figures. The prime minister was officially granted a place in the order of precedence in December 1905, and the first statutory reference to the prime minister was present in the Chequers Estate Act 1917, which specified Chequers as a prime-ministerial residence. Public recognition of the existence of a 'Prime Minister's Office' in the Civil Service Yearbook came as recently as the 1977 edition.\nThe prime minister is customarily a member of the Privy Council and thus entitled to the appellation \"The Right Honourable\". Membership of the Council is retained for life. It is a constitutional convention that only a privy counsellor can be appointed prime minister. Most potential candidates have already attained this status. The only case when a non-privy counsellor was the natural appointment was Ramsay MacDonald in 1924. The issue was resolved by appointing him to the Council immediately prior to his appointment as prime minister.\nAccording to the now-defunct Department for Constitutional Affairs, the prime minister is made a privy counsellor as a result of taking office and should be addressed by the official title prefixed by \"The Right Honourable\" and not by a personal name. Although this form of address is employed on formal occasions, it is rarely used by the media. As \"prime minister\" is a position, not a title, the incumbent should be referred to as \"the prime minister\", although the title \"Prime Minister\" (e.g. \"Prime Minister Keir Starmer\") has become commonplace within current political reporting. Within the UK, the expression \"Prime Minister Starmer\" is never used, although it, too, is sometimes used by foreign dignitaries and news sources.\nCompensation.\nIn 2010, the prime minister received \u00a314,500 in addition to a salary of \u00a365,737 as a member of parliament. Until 2006, the lord chancellor was the highest-paid member of the government, ahead of the prime minister. This reflected the lord chancellor's position at the head of the judicial pay scale. The Constitutional Reform Act 2005 eliminated the lord chancellor's judicial functions and also reduced the office's salary to below that of the prime minister. During the premiership of Gordon Brown, the prime minister received a salary of \u00a3193,885 on 1 April 2009 which was higher than the salary of \u00a3166,786 as of 2024. The reasons for such reductions are Brown's cuts to voluntary pay at around \u00a3150,000 during pre-election in the May 2010 election, and when David Cameron became prime minister the cuts were extended to 5%, amounting at around \u00a3142,500. Subsequent prime ministers have kept the restraint on ministerial pay and have not taken any further pay outside of what they are entitled. According to journalist Simon Kelner, the salary of the prime minister must be increased and that further expansion of a salary or hospitality received by a prime minister is disavowed under the Corrupt and Illegal Practices Prevention Act 1883 which only criminalised voter bribery and introduced standards for election expenses, and \"created a more level playing field for parliamentary candidates\". Kelner said that it is a inadequate way of holding a prime minister into account. This was in response to the 2024 Labour Party freebies controversy, in which the current prime minister, Keir Starmer, having reportedly failed to disclose the amount of gifts and \"freebies\" received by him, members of his family and cabinet.\nOfficial residences.\n10 Downing Street, in London, has been the official place of residence of the prime minister since 1732; they are entitled to use its staff and facilities, including extensive offices. The building was originally given by King George I to Robert Walpole, the nation's first prime minister, as a personal gift. However, Walpole insisted that he would accept it in his capacity as first lord of the Treasury and requested that his subsequent successors be entitled to reside in and use the property as they wish. The complex incorporates the flats of No.11 and No.12 Downing Street, which have been reconstructed through to connect them to No.10. Altogether, the three buildings contain over 100 rooms.\nChequers, a country house in Buckinghamshire, gifted to the government in 1917, may be used as a country retreat for the prime minister. The estate was previously owned by the Conservative minister and First Lord of the Admiralty, Sir Arthur Lee, before being donated to the British government under the Chequers Estate Act 1917. It was to give the incumbent prime minister the time to \"spend two days a week in the high and pure air of the Chiltern hills and woods\" and on the condition that incumbent should not own any residential country estate of their own.\nDuring the 18th and 19th centuries, many prime ministers were members of the British nobility and therefore held the office while serving in the House of Lords. Through lineage and inheritance, these prime ministers acquired large estates, though they still owned properties in London for political affairs and many used country houses as a retreat. Until the mid-20th century, parliamentary sessions did not begin until the New Year after ending in August, which would give the prime minister long periods in respite.\nPost-premiership.\nRetirement honours.\nUpon retirement, it is customary for the sovereign to grant a prime minister some honour or dignity. The honour bestowed is commonly, but not invariably, membership of the UK's most senior order of chivalry, the Order of the Garter. The practice of creating a retired prime minister a Knight Companion of the Garter (KG) has been fairly prevalent since the mid-nineteenth century. Upon the retirement of a prime minister who is Scottish, it is likely that the primarily Scottish honour of Knight of the Thistle (KT) will be used instead of the Order of the Garter, which is generally regarded as an English honour.\nHistorically it has also been common to grant prime ministers a peerage upon retirement from the Commons, elevating the individual to the Lords. Formerly, the peerage bestowed was usually an earldom. The last such creation was for Harold Macmillan, who resigned in 1963. Unusually, he became Earl of Stockton only in 1984, over twenty years after leaving office.\nMacmillan's successors Alec Douglas-Home, Harold Wilson, James Callaghan, Margaret Thatcher, David Cameron, and Theresa May all accepted life peerages (although Douglas-Home had previously disclaimed his hereditary title as Earl of Home and Cameron received a peerage after reentering government as Foreign Secretary, not for services as a former prime minister). Edward Heath did not accept a peerage of any kind; neither have any of the prime ministers who have retired since 1990 other than Cameron (having done so to re-join the Cabinet, rather than as an honour per se) and May. Edward Heath (in 1992), John Major (in 2005) and Tony Blair (in 2022) were appointed as Knights Companion of the Garter. Major (in 1998) and Gordon Brown (in 2024) were appointed members of the Order of the Companions of Honour, although Blair had previously disclosed that he did not want honours bestowed on himself or future prime ministers.\nThe most recent former prime minister to die was Margaret Thatcher (1979\u20131990) on 8 April 2013. Her death meant that for the first time since 1955 (the year in which the Earldom of Attlee was created, subsequent to the death of Earl Baldwin in 1947) the membership of the House of Lords included no former prime minister, a situation which remained the case until David Cameron was appointed to the House in November 2023.\nActivities.\nThere are currently no established roles or job positions for former prime ministers following their resignations or after leaving office unexpectedly. It depends on their personal choice and reasons surrounding the need to take on such positions. During the 18th and 19th centuries, many former prime ministers, who were wealthy members of the nobility, would often simply retire to their country estates. The first prime minister, Robert Walpole, accumulated large personal wealth while serving in office and from previous investments made in the 1710s. Prime ministers Lord Bute and Lord Rosebery were among the wealthiest men in the country during their retirements and are often touted as some of the wealthiest to serve as in office. However some prime ministers, such as William Pitt the Elder and his son William Pitt the Younger, amassed large public debts that were later paid off by parliament. In 1937, an official pension for former prime ministers was given at the sum of \u00a32000 per annum.\nIn their retirements, a majority of former prime ministers have written memoirs and autobiographies. Some prime ministers have also written non-political books as well, including Winston Churchill's histories of World War II and of the English language, Edward Heath's books on his wider interests in sailing, music and travel, Major's history of cricket and Arthur Balfour's philosophical writings. Some prime ministers such as William Gladstone mainly wrote tracts and tomes on theology and religion and Benjamin Disraeli wrote many best-selling novels in addition to memoirs and history.\nIn the 21st century, many former prime ministers have set up their own foundations and charities to be used as a platform to continue involvement in political and public issues after they leave office. In 1991, Margaret Thatcher became the first prime minister to set up her own foundation to try to secure her legacy and propagate her ideology known as Thatcherism, but it closed down in 2005. Tony Blair has set up a sports foundation, an inter-faith foundation and the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change in 2016. In his post-premiership, Blair is also the first prime minister to take on a major international role, as an official envoy of the Quartet on the Middle East. Gordon Brown was actively involved in politics long after he left office, most notably during the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, in which he campaigned for the no vote that advocated Scotland to remain in the union.\nHowever, some former prime ministers have returned to serve in the governments of their successors, and a few have had 'retreads' that saw them serve short tenures due to their successors unexpectedly resigning or dying. Notable cases include the Duke of Wellington who, after serving two brief terms in office, was able to command significant influence as a senior member of the Tory party and returned to serve in two governments of his successor, Sir Robert Peel, as Foreign Secretary and Minister without portfolio. He later retired to serve as Commander-in-Chief of the Army from 1842 until his death in 1852. Arthur Balfour served as prime minister for three years of his term after he was defeated in the 1906 general election and later went on to serve as the Foreign Secretary for eleven years in the Imperial War Cabinet during and after World War I under three prime ministers. After Neville Chamberlain resigned as prime minister in May 1940, he returned to serve under Winston Churchill in his subsequent war cabinet. Alec Douglas-Home, who resigned after losing the 1964 general election, later came to serve in the cabinet of Edward Heath in 1970. David Cameron returned 7 years after resigning as Prime Minister to serve as Foreign Secretary under Rishi Sunak.\nPublic Duty Costs Allowance (PDCA).\nAll former prime ministers are entitled to claim for salary or office expenses incurred in fulfilling public duties in that role. The allowance may not be used to pay for private or parliamentary duties. It is administered by the Cabinet Office Finance Team.\nThe maximum amount which may be claimed per year is \u00a3115,000, plus 10% towards any staff pension costs. This limit is reviewed annually, and at the start of each Parliament, by the current prime minister. The maximum level may be adjusted downward if the former prime minister receives any public funds for fulfilling other public appointments. Downing Street confirmed in November 2023 that former prime minister David Cameron would not claim from the PDCA while he acted as Foreign Secretary.\nSee also.\nLists of prime ministers by different criteria.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAll lists: \nOther related pages.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nMore related pages: \nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWorks cited.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "24151", "revid": "7611264", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24151", "title": "Flatworm", "text": "Phylum of soft-bodied invertebrates\nPlatyhelminthes (from grc \" \"\u03c0\u03bb\u03b1\u03c4\u03cd\" platy\"\u00a0'flat' and \" \"\u1f15\u03bb\u03bc\u03b9\u03bd\u03c2\" helmins\"\u00a0'parasitic worm') is a phylum of relatively simple bilaterian, unsegmented, soft-bodied invertebrates commonly called flatworms or flat worms. Being acoelomates (having no body cavity), and having no specialised circulatory and respiratory organs, they are restricted to having flattened shapes that allow oxygen and nutrients to pass through their bodies by diffusion. The digestive cavity has only one opening for both ingestion (intake of nutrients) and egestion (removal of undigested wastes); as a result, the food can not be processed continuously.\nIn traditional medicinal texts, Platyhelminthes are divided into Turbellaria, which are mostly non-parasitic animals such as planarians, and three entirely parasitic groups: Cestoda, Trematoda and Monogenea; however, since the turbellarians have since been proven not to be monophyletic, this classification is now deprecated. Free-living flatworms are mostly predators, and live in water or in shaded, humid terrestrial environments, such as leaf litter. Cestodes (tapeworms) and trematodes (flukes) have complex life-cycles, with mature stages that live as parasites in the digestive systems of fish or land vertebrates, and intermediate stages that infest secondary hosts. The eggs of trematodes are excreted from their main hosts, whereas adult cestodes generate vast numbers of hermaphroditic, segment-like proglottids that detach when mature, are excreted, and then release eggs. Unlike the other parasitic groups, the monogeneans are external parasites infesting aquatic animals, and their larvae metamorphose into the adult form after attaching to a suitable host.\nBecause they do not have internal body cavities, Platyhelminthes were regarded as a primitive stage in the evolution of bilaterians (animals with bilateral symmetry and hence with distinct front and rear ends). However, analyses since the mid-1980s have separated out one subgroup, the Acoelomorpha, as basal bilaterians \u2013 closer to the original bilaterians than to any other modern groups. The remaining Platyhelminthes form a monophyletic group, one that contains all and only descendants of a common ancestor that is itself a member of the group. The redefined Platyhelminthes is part of the Spiralia, one of the two main groups of Protostomia. These analyses had concluded the redefined Platyhelminthes, excluding Acoelomorpha, consists of two monophyletic subgroups, Catenulida and Rhabditophora, with Cestoda, Trematoda and Monogenea forming a monophyletic subgroup within one branch of the Rhabditophora. Hence, the traditional platyhelminth subgroup \"Turbellaria\" is now regarded as paraphyletic, since it excludes the wholly parasitic groups, although these are descended from one group of \"turbellarians\".\nA planarian species has been used in the Philippines and the Maldives in an attempt to control populations of the imported giant African snail (\"Achatina fulica\"), which was eating agricultural crops. Success was initially reported for the Maldives but this was only temporary and the role of flatworms has been questioned. These planarians have now spread very widely throughout the tropics and are themselves a serious threat to native snails, and should not be used for biological control. In Northwestern Europe, there are concerns about the spread of the New Zealand planarian \"Arthurdendyus triangulatus\", which preys on earthworms.\nDescription.\nDistinguishing features.\nPlatyhelminthes are bilaterally symmetrical animals: their left and right sides are mirror images of each other; this also implies they have distinct top and bottom surfaces and distinct head and tail ends. Like other bilaterians, they have three main cell layers (endoderm, mesoderm, and ectoderm), while the radially symmetrical cnidarians and ctenophores (comb jellies) have only two cell layers. Beyond that, they are \"defined more by what they do not have than by any particular series of specializations.\" Unlike most other bilaterians, Platyhelminthes have no internal body cavity, so are described as acoelomates. Although the absence of a coelom also occurs in other bilaterians: gnathostomulids, gastrotrichs, xenacoelomorphs, cycliophorans, entoproctans and the parasitic mesozoans. They also lack specialized circulatory and respiratory organs, both of these facts are defining features when classifying a flatworm's anatomy. Their bodies are soft and unsegmented.\nFeatures common to all subgroups.\nThe lack of circulatory and respiratory organs limits platyhelminths to sizes and shapes that enable oxygen to reach and carbon dioxide to leave all parts of their bodies by simple diffusion. Hence, many are microscopic, and the large species have flat ribbon-like or leaf-like shapes. Because there is no circulatory system which can transport nutrients around, the guts of large species have many branches, allowing the nutrients to diffuse to all parts of the body. Respiration through the whole surface of the body makes them vulnerable to fluid loss, and restricts them to environments where dehydration is unlikely: sea and freshwater, moist terrestrial environments such as leaf litter or between grains of soil, and as parasites within other animals.\nThe space between the skin and gut is filled with mesenchyme, also known as parenchyma, a connective tissue made of cells and reinforced by collagen fibers that act as a type of skeleton, providing attachment points for muscles. The mesenchyme contains all the internal organs and allows the passage of oxygen, nutrients and waste products. It consists of two main types of cell: fixed cells, some of which have fluid-filled vacuoles; and stem cells, which can transform into any other type of cell, and are used in regenerating tissues after injury or asexual reproduction.\nMost platyhelminths have no anus and regurgitate undigested material through the mouth. The genus \"Paracatenula\", whose members include tiny flatworms living in symbiosis with bacteria, is even missing a mouth and a gut. However, some long species have an anus and some with complex, branched guts have more than one anus, since excretion only through the mouth would be difficult for them. The gut is lined with a single layer of endodermal cells that absorb and digest food. Some species break up and soften food first by secreting enzymes in the gut or pharynx (throat).\nAll animals need to keep the concentration of dissolved substances in their body fluids at a fairly constant level. Internal parasites and free-living marine animals live in environments with high concentrations of dissolved material, and generally let their tissues have the same level of concentration as the environment, while freshwater animals need to prevent their body fluids from becoming too dilute. Despite this difference in environments, most platyhelminths use the same system to control the concentration of their body fluids. Flame cells, so called because the beating of their flagella looks like a flickering candle flame, extract from the mesenchyme water that contains wastes and some reusable material, and drive it into networks of tube cells which are lined with flagella and microvilli. The tube cells' flagella drive the water towards exits called nephridiopores, while their microvilli reabsorb reusable materials and as much water as is needed to keep the body fluids at the right concentration. These combinations of flame cells and tube cells are called protonephridia.\nIn all platyhelminths, the nervous system is concentrated at the head end. Other platyhelminths have rings of ganglia in the head and main nerve trunks running along their bodies.\nMajor subgroups.\nEarly classification divided the flatworms in four groups: Turbellaria, Trematoda, Monogenea and Cestoda. This classification had long been recognized to be artificial, and in 1985, Ehlers proposed a phylogenetically more correct classification, where the massively polyphyletic \"Turbellaria\" was split into a dozen orders, and Trematoda, Monogenea and Cestoda were joined in the new order Neodermata. However, the classification presented here is the early, traditional, classification, as it still is the one used everywhere except in scientific articles.\nTurbellaria.\nThese have about 4,500 species, are mostly free-living, and range from to in length. Most are predators or scavengers, and terrestrial species are mostly nocturnal and live in shaded, humid locations, such as leaf litter or rotting wood. However, some are symbiotes of other animals, such as crustaceans, and some are parasites. Free-living turbellarians are mostly black, brown or gray, but some larger ones are brightly colored. The Acoela and Nemertodermatida were traditionally regarded as turbellarians, but are now regarded as members of a separate phylum, the Acoelomorpha, or as two separate phyla. \"Xenoturbella\", a genus of very simple animals, has also been reclassified as a separate phylum.\nSome turbellarians have a simple pharynx lined with cilia and generally feed by using cilia to sweep food particles and small prey into their mouths, which are usually in the middle of their undersides. Most other turbellarians have a pharynx that is eversible (can be extended by being turned inside-out), and the mouths of different species can be anywhere along the underside. The freshwater species \"Microstomum caudatum\" can open its mouth almost as wide as its body is long, to swallow prey about as large as itself. Predatory species in suborder Kalyptorhynchia often have a muscular pharynx equipped with hooks or teeth used for seizing prey.\nMost turbellarians have pigment-cup ocelli ('little eyes'); one pair in most species, but two or even three pairs in others. A few large species have many eyes in clusters over the brain, mounted on tentacles, or spaced uniformly around the edge of the body. The ocelli can only distinguish the direction from which light is coming to enable the animals to avoid it. A few groups have statocysts \u2013 fluid-filled chambers containing a small, solid particle or, in a few groups, two. These statocysts are thought to function as balance and acceleration sensors, as they perform the same way in cnidarian medusae and in ctenophores. However, turbellarian statocysts have no sensory cilia, so the way they sense the movements and positions of solid particles is unknown. On the other hand, most have ciliated touch-sensor cells scattered over their bodies, especially on tentacles and around the edges. Specialized cells in pits or grooves on the head are most likely smell sensors.\nPlanarians, a subgroup of seriates, are famous for their ability to regenerate if divided by cuts across their bodies. Experiments show that (in fragments that do not already have a head) a new head grows most quickly on those fragments which were originally located closest to the original head. This suggests the growth of a head is controlled by a chemical whose concentration diminishes throughout the organism, from head to tail. Many turbellarians clone themselves by transverse or longitudinal division, whilst others, reproduce by budding.\nThe vast majority of turbellarians are hermaphrodites (they have both female and male reproductive cells) which fertilize eggs internally by copulation. Some of the larger aquatic species mate by penis fencing \u2013 a duel in which each tries to impregnate the other, and the loser adopts the female role of developing the eggs. In most species, \"miniature adults\" emerge when the eggs hatch, but a few large species produce plankton-like larvae.\nTrematoda.\nThese parasites' name refers to the cavities in their holdfasts (Greek \"tr\u00eama\" 'hole'), which resemble suckers and anchor them within their hosts. The skin of all species is a syncitium, which is a layer of cells that shares a single external membrane. Trematodes are divided into two groups, Digenea and Aspidogastrea (also known as Aspodibothrea).\nDigenea.\nThese are often called flukes, as most have flat rhomboid shapes like that of a flounder (Old English ). There are about 11,000 species, more than all other platyhelminthes combined, and second only to roundworms among parasites on metazoans. Adults usually have two holdfasts: a ring around the mouth and a larger sucker midway along what would be the underside in a free-living flatworm.\nAlthough the name \"Digeneans\" means \"two generations\", most have very complex life cycles with up to seven stages, depending on what combinations of environments the early stages encounter \u2013 the most important factor being whether the eggs are deposited on land or in water. The intermediate stages transfer the parasites from one host to another. The definitive host in which adults develop is a land vertebrate; the earliest host of juvenile stages is usually a snail that may live on land or in water, whilst in many cases, a fish or arthropod is the second host. For example, the adjoining illustration shows the life cycle of the intestinal fluke \"metagonimus\", which hatches in the intestine of a snail, then moves to a fish where it penetrates the body and encysts in the flesh, then migrating to the small intestine of a land animal that eats the fish raw, finally generating eggs that are excreted and ingested by snails, thereby completing the cycle. A similar life cycle occurs with \"Opisthorchis viverrini\", which is found in South East Asia and can infect the liver of humans, causing Cholangiocarcinoma (bile duct cancer). Schistosomes, which cause the devastating tropical disease bilharzia, also belong to this group.\nAdults range between and in length. Individual adult digeneans are of a single sex, and in some species slender females live in enclosed grooves that run along the bodies of the males, partially emerging to lay eggs. In all species the adults have complex reproductive systems, capable of producing between 10,000 and 100,000 times as many eggs as a free-living flatworm. In addition, the intermediate stages that live in snails reproduce asexually.\nAdults of different species infest different parts of the definitive host - for example the intestine, lungs, large blood vessels, and liver. The adults use a relatively large, muscular pharynx to ingest cells, cell fragments, mucus, body fluids or blood. In both the adult and snail-inhabiting stages, the external syncytium absorbs dissolved nutrients from the host. Adult digeneans can live without oxygen for long periods.\nAspidogastrea.\nMembers of this small group have either a single divided sucker or a row of suckers that cover the underside. They infest the guts of bony or cartilaginous fish, turtles, or the body cavities of marine and freshwater bivalves and gastropods. Their eggs produce ciliated swimming larvae, and the life cycle has one or two hosts.\nCercomeromorpha.\nCercomeromorpha contains parasites attach themselves to their hosts by means of disks that bear crescent-shaped hooks. They are divided into the Monogenea and Cestoda groupings.\nMonogenea.\nOf about 1,100 species of monogeneans, most are external parasites that require particular host species - mainly fish, but in some cases amphibians or aquatic reptiles. However, a few are internal parasites. Adult monogeneans have large attachment organs at the rear, known as haptors (Greek \u1f05\u03c0\u03c4\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd, \"haptein\", means \"catch\"), which have suckers, clamps, and hooks. They often have flattened bodies. In some species, the pharynx secretes enzymes to digest the host's skin, allowing the parasite to feed on blood and cellular debris. Others graze externally on mucus and flakes of the hosts' skins. The name \"Monogenea\" is based on the fact that these parasites have only one nonlarval generation.\nCestoda.\nThese are often called tapeworms because of their flat, slender but very long bodies \u2013 the name \"cestode\" is derived from the Latin word \"cestus\", which means 'tape'. The adults of all 3,400 cestode species are internal parasites. Cestodes have no mouths or guts, and the syncitial skin absorbs nutrients \u2013 mainly carbohydrates and amino acids \u2013 from the host, and also disguises it chemically to avoid attacks by the host's immune system. Shortage of carbohydrates in the host's diet stunts the growth of parasites and may even kill them. Their metabolisms generally use simple but inefficient chemical processes, compensating for this inefficiency by consuming large amounts of food relative to their physical size.\nIn the majority of species, known as eucestodes ('true tapeworms'), the neck produces a chain of segments called proglottids via a process known as strobilation. As a result, the most mature proglottids are furthest from the scolex. Adults of \"Taenia saginata\", which infests humans, can form proglottid chains over long, although is more typical. Each proglottid has both male and female reproductive organs. If the host's gut contains two or more adults of the same cestode species they generally fertilize each other, however, proglottids of the same worm can fertilize each other and even themselves. When the eggs are fully developed, the proglottids separate and are excreted by the host. The eucestode life cycle is less complex than that of digeneans, but varies depending on the species. For example:\nMembers of the smaller group known as Cestodaria have no scolex, do not produce proglottids, and have body shapes similar to those of diageneans. Cestodarians parasitize fish and turtles.\nClassification and evolutionary relationships.\nThe relationships of Platyhelminthes to other Bilateria are shown in the phylogenetic tree:\nThe internal relationships of Platyhelminthes are shown below. The tree is not fully resolved.\nThe oldest confidently identified parasitic flatworm fossils are cestode eggs found in a Permian shark coprolite, but helminth hooks still attached to Devonian acanthodians and placoderms might also represent parasitic flatworms with simple life cycles. The oldest known free-living platyhelminth specimen is a fossil preserved in Eocene age Baltic amber and placed in the monotypic species \"Micropalaeosoma balticus\", whilst the oldest subfossil specimens are schistosome eggs discovered in ancient Egyptian mummies. The Platyhelminthes have very few synapomorphies - distinguishing features that all Platyhelminthes (but no other animals) exhibit. This makes it difficult to work out their relationships with other groups of animals, as well as the relationships between different groups that are described as members of the Platyhelminthes.\nThe \"traditional\" view before the 1990s was that Platyhelminthes formed the sister group to all the other bilaterians, which include, for instance, arthropods, molluscs, annelids and chordates. Since then, molecular phylogenetics, which aims to work out evolutionary \"family trees\" by comparing different organisms' biochemicals such as DNA, RNA and proteins, has radically changed scientists' view of evolutionary relationships between animals. Flatworms are now recognized as secondarily simplified bilaterians.\nDetailed morphological analyses of anatomical features in the mid-1980s, as well as molecular phylogenetics analyses since 2000 using different sections of DNA, agree that Acoelomorpha, consisting of Acoela (traditionally regarded as very simple \"turbellarians\") and Nemertodermatida (another small group previously classified as \"turbellarians\") are the sister group to all other bilaterians. However, a 2007 study concluded that Acoela and Nemertodermatida were two distinct groups of bilaterians.\n\"Xenoturbella\", a bilaterian whose only well-defined organ is a statocyst, was originally classified as a \"primitive turbellarian\". Later studies suggested it may instead be a deuterostome, but more detailed molecular phylogenetics have led to its classification as sister-group to the Acoelomorpha.\nThe Platyhelminthes excluding Acoelomorpha contain two main groups \u2013 Catenulida and Rhabditophora \u2013 both of which are generally agreed to be monophyletic (each contains all and only the descendants of an ancestor that is a member of the same group). Early molecular phylogenetics analyses of the Catenulida and Rhabditophora left uncertainties about whether these could be combined in a single monophyletic group; a study in 2008 concluded that they could, therefore Platyhelminthes could be redefined as Catenulida plus Rhabditophora, excluding the Acoelomorpha.\nOther molecular phylogenetics analyses agree the redefined Platyhelminthes are most closely related to Gastrotricha, and both are part of a grouping known as Platyzoa. Platyzoa are generally agreed to be at least closely related to the Lophotrochozoa, a superphylum that includes molluscs and annelid worms. The majority view is that Platyzoa are part of Lophotrochozoa, but a significant minority of researchers regard Platyzoa as a sister group of Lophotrochozoa.\nIt has been agreed since 1985 that each of the wholly parasitic platyhelminth groups (Cestoda, Monogenea and Trematoda) is monophyletic, and that together these form a larger monophyletic grouping, the Neodermata, in which the adults of all members have syncytial skins. However, there is debate about whether the Cestoda and Monogenea can be combined as an intermediate monophyletic group, the Cercomeromorpha, within the Neodermata. It is generally agreed that the Neodermata are a sub-group a few levels down in the \"family tree\" of the Rhabditophora. Hence the traditional sub-phylum \"Turbellaria\" is paraphyletic, since it does not include the Neodermata although these are descendants of a sub-group of \"turbellarians\".\nEvolution.\nAn outline of the origins of the parasitic lifestyle has been proposed; epithelial feeding monopisthocotyleans on fish hosts are basal in the Neodermata and were the first shift to parasitism from free living ancestors. The next evolutionary step was a dietary change from epithelium to blood. The last common ancestor of Digenea + Cestoda was monogenean and most likely sanguinivorous.\nIn several members of the order Rhabdocoela an endosymbiotic relationship with microalgae has evolved. Some species in the same order has also evolved kleptoplasty.\nThe earliest known fossils confidently classified as tapeworms have been dated to https://\u00a0million years ago, after being found in coprolites (fossilised faeces) from an elasmobranch. Putative older fossils include a ribbon-shaped, bilaterally symmetrical organism named \"Rugosusivitta orthogonia\" from the Early Cambrian of China, brownish bodies on the bedding planes reported from the Late Ordovician (Katian) Vaur\u00e9al Formation (Canada) by Knaust &amp; Desrochers (2019), tentatively interpreted as turbellarians (though the authors cautioned that they might ultimately turn out to be fossils of acoelomorphs or nemerteans) and circlets of fossil hooks preserved with placoderm and acanthodian fossils from the Devonian of Latvia, at least some of which might represent parasitic monogeneans.\nInteraction with humans.\nParasitism.\nCestodes (tapeworms) and digeneans (flukes) cause diseases in humans and their livestock, whilst monogeneans can cause serious losses of stocks in fish farms. Schistosomiasis, also known as bilharzia or snail fever, is the second-most devastating parasitic disease in tropical countries, behind malaria. The Carter Center estimated 200\u00a0million people in 74 countries are infected with the disease, and half the victims live in Africa. The condition has a low mortality rate, but usually presents as a chronic illness that can damage internal organs. It can impair the growth and cognitive development of children, increasing the risk of bladder cancer in adults. The disease is caused by several flukes of the genus \"Schistosoma\", which can bore through human skin; those most at risk use infected bodies of water for recreation or laundry.\nIn 2000, an estimated 45\u00a0million people were infected with the beef tapeworm \"Taenia saginata\" and 3\u00a0million with the pork tapeworm \"Taenia solium\". Infection of the digestive system by adult tapeworms causes abdominal symptoms that, whilst unpleasant, are seldom disabling or life-threatening. However, neurocysticercosis resulting from penetration of \"T. solium\" larvae into the central nervous system is the major cause of acquired epilepsy worldwide. In 2000, about 39\u00a0million people were infected with trematodes (flukes) that naturally parasitize fish and crustaceans, but can pass to humans who eat raw or lightly cooked seafood. Infection of humans by the broad fish tapeworm \"Diphyllobothrium latum\" occasionally causes vitamin B12 deficiency and, in severe cases, megaloblastic anemia.\nThe threat to humans in developed countries is rising as a result of social trends: the increase in organic farming, which uses manure and sewage sludge rather than artificial fertilizers, spreads parasites both directly and via the droppings of seagulls which feed on manure and sludge; the increasing popularity of raw or lightly cooked foods; imports of meat, seafood and salad vegetables from high-risk areas; and, as an underlying cause, reduced awareness of parasites compared with other public health issues such as pollution. In less-developed countries, inadequate sanitation and the use of human feces (night soil) as fertilizer or to enrich fish farm ponds continues to spread parasitic platyhelminths, whilst poorly designed water-supply and irrigation projects have provided additional channels for their spread. People in these countries usually cannot afford the cost of fuel required to cook food thoroughly enough to kill parasites. Controlling parasites that infect humans and livestock has become more difficult, as many species have become resistant to drugs that used to be effective, mainly for killing juveniles in meat. While poorer countries still struggle with unintentional infection, cases have been reported of intentional infection in the US by dieters who are desperate for rapid weight-loss.\nPests.\nThere is concern in northwest Europe (including the British Isles) regarding the possible proliferation of the New Zealand planarian \"Arthurdendyus triangulatus\" and the Australian flatworm \"Australoplana sanguinea\", both of which prey on earthworms. \"A. triangulatus\" is thought to have reached Europe in containers of plants imported by botanical gardens.\nBenefits.\nThe planarian \"Platydemus manokwari\" has been deliberately released in an attempt at control of the giant African snail \"Achatina fulica\" which damages agricultural plants. It was first observed as an invasive species on Guam and was then released in the Philippines and Maldives. It has now spread to many islands in the Pacific and Caribbean and is now spreading across the Southern United States as well as southern and eastern Asia, including mainland China. It was initially claimed that \"P.\u00a0manokwari\" severely reduced, and in places exterminated, \"A.\u00a0fulica\" \u2013 achieving much greater success than most biological pest control programs, which generally aim for a low, stable population of the pest species. However, the decline of \"A.\u00a0fulica\" is no longer thought to have been due to flatworm predation. These planarians are a serious threat to native snails and should never be used for biological control.\nA study in Argentina shows the potential for planarians such as \"Girardia anceps\", \"Mesostoma ehrenbergii\", and \"Bothromesostoma evelinae\" to reduce populations of the mosquito species \"Aedes aegypti\" and \"Culex pipiens\". The experiment showed that \"G.\u00a0anceps\" can prey on all instars of both mosquito species, yet maintain a steady predation rate over time. The ability of these flatworms to live in artificial containers demonstrated the potential of placing these species in popular mosquito breeding sites, which might reduce the amount of mosquito-borne disease.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Celestine's pontificate was largely spent combatting various teachings deemed heretical. He was instrumental for the condemnation of Nestorius in the Council of Ephesus when \nCyril of Alexandria appealed him to make a decision, which in response, Celestine delegated Cyril the job of condemning Nestorius if he did not recant his teachings. He supported the mission of the Gallic bishops that sent Germanus of Auxerre in 429, to Britain to address Pelagianism, and later commissioned Palladius as bishop to the Scots of Ireland and northern Britain.\nEarly life and family.\nCelestine I was a Roman from the region of Campania. Nothing is known of his early history except that his father's name was Priscus. According to John Gilmary Shea, Celestine was a relative of the emperor Valentinian. He is said to have lived for a time at Milan with St. Ambrose. The first known record of him is in a document of Pope Innocent I from the year 416, where he is spoken of as \"Celestine the Deacon\".\nPontificate.\nAccording to the \"Liber Pontificalis\", the start of his papacy was 3 November. However, Tillemont places the date at 10 September. The Vatican also gives his pontificate as starting on 10 September 422.\nVarious portions of the liturgy are attributed to Celestine I, but without any certainty on the subject. In 430, he held a synod in Rome, at which the teachings of Nestorius were condemned. The following year, he sent delegates to the First Council of Ephesus, which addressed the same issue. Four letters written by him on that occasion, all dated 15 March 431, together with a few others, to the African bishops, to those of Illyria, of Thessalonica, and of Narbonne, are extant in re-translations from the Greek; the Latin originals having been lost.\nCelestine actively condemned the Pelagians and was zealous for Roman orthodoxy. To this end he was involved in the initiative of the Gallic bishops to send Germanus of Auxerre and Lupus of Troyes travelling to Britain in 429 to confront bishops reportedly holding Pelagian views.\nHe sent Palladius to Ireland to serve as a bishop in 431. Celestine strongly opposed the Novatians in Rome; as Socrates Scholasticus writes, \"this Celestinus took away the churches from the Novatians at Rome also, and obliged Rusticulus their bishop to hold his meetings secretly in private houses.\" The Novationists refused absolution to the lapsi, but Celestine argued that reconciliation should never be refused to any dying sinner who sincerely asked for it. He was zealous in refusing to tolerate the smallest innovation on the constitutions of his predecessors. As St. Vincent of Lerins reported in 434:\nHoly Pope Celestine also expresses himself in like manner and to the same effect. For in the Epistle which he wrote to the priests of Gaul, charging them with connivance with error, in that by their silence they failed in their duty to the ancient faith, and allowed profane novelties to spring up, he says: \"We are deservedly to blame if we encourage error by silence. Therefore rebuke these people. Restrain their liberty of preaching.\"\nIn a letter to certain bishops of Gaul, dated 428, Celestine rebukes the adoption of special clerical garb by the clergy. He wrote: \"We [the bishops and clergy] should be distinguished from the common people [plebe] by our learning, not by our clothes; by our conduct, not by our dress; by cleanness of mind, not by the care we spend upon our person\".\nDeath and legacy.\nThere are several interpretations for the date of Celestine's death. Different sources for the \"Liber Pontificalis\" provide a date of death as April 6 or 8, 432. This interpretation is favored by the Eastern Orthodox church, and fixed the feast day in this tradition. \nCritical analysis of alternative sources shows the April date is inconsistent with the succession of Sixtus III, as well as the number of days Celestine was on the papal throne. By counting the number of days from election to his death, Tillemont calculated date of Celestine's death to be July 26, 432.\nLouis Duchesne, when compiling the first complete critical edition of the \"Liber Pontificalis\" in 1886, similarly calculated a date of July 27, 432, which is now largely accepted in the Western tradition (and is marked as Celestine's feast day by the Roman church). \nCelestine was buried in the cemetery of St. Priscilla on the Via Salaria, but his body, subsequently moved, now lies in the Basilica di Santa Prassede. In art, Celestine is portrayed as a pope with a dove, dragon, and flame, and is recognized by the Oriental Orthodox, Eastern Orthodox, and Catholic Churches as a saint.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Eventually Guido began his career in Rome as a subdeacon and a \"scriptor apostolicus\" under Pope Callixtus II. He was created Cardinal-Deacon of Santa Maria in Via Lata by Pope Honorius II in 1127; as such, he signed the papal bulls issued between 3 April 1130 and 21 December 1133. In the double papal election of 1130 he joined the obedience of Pope Innocent II. In December 1133 Innocent promoted him to the rank of Cardinal-Priest of San Marco. He signed the papal bulls as \"S.R.E. indignus sacerdos\" between 11 January 1134 and 16 May 1143. As the cardinal of San Marco's, he supported Innocent's claims with regards to Monte Cassino, and as a mark of his confidence in him, Innocent made Guido the rector of Benevento. Afterwards, he made him a papal legate to France in 1140.\nHe participated in the papal election of 1143, the first undisturbed papal election that Rome had seen for eighty-two years, and was elected pope two days after the death of Innocent II, on 25 September 1143, taking the name of Celestine.\nPapacy.\nCelestine II governed the Catholic Church for only five months and thirteen days from his election until his death on 8 March 1144. Upon his accession he wrote to Peter the Venerable and the monks of Cluny, asking them to pray for him, while he was congratulated by Arnulf of Lisieux. Regardless of the brevity of his reign, he was prepared to chart a very different course from that of his predecessor. He was opposed to Innocent II's concessions to King Roger II of Sicily and refused to ratify the Treaty of Mignano (\"a foolish policy, which he survived \u2013 just \u2013 long enough to regret\"). He was in favor of the Plantagenets' claim to the English throne, and was therefore opposed to King Stephen of England. To emphasise this shift, he refused to renew the legatine authority that Innocent II had granted to King Stephen's brother, Henry of Blois. Celestine also favored the Templars, ordering a general collection for them, as well as the Hospitallers, giving them control of the hospital of Saint Mary Teutonicorum in Jerusalem.\nThe principal act of his papacy was the absolution of Louis VII of France. King Louis had refused to accept the nomination of Pierre de la Chatre as the archbishop of Bourges, who went to see Innocent II to have his nomination confirmed. When Pierre returned to France in 1142, Louis refused him permission to enter his episcopal city, causing Pierre to flee to the court of Count Theobald II of Champagne. Innocent responded by placing France under an interdict. For two years, the various parties remained at loggerheads while Bernard of Clairvaux attempted to mediate the dispute. With the election of Celestine, both Bernard and Theobald appealed to the pope, while Louis sent ambassadors to have the interdict lifted. Louis agreed to accept Pierre as the legitimate archbishop of Bourges, and in return, Celestine removed the sentence of interdict.\nCelestine died on 8 March 1144 in the monastery of Saint Sebastian on the Palatine hill and was buried in the south transept of the Lateran. Celestine's heraldic badge was a lozengy shield of argent and gules.\nCelestine II is the first pope listed in the Prophecies of St Malachy.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He had a tense relationship with several monarchs, including Emperor Henry VI, King Tancred of Sicily, and King Alfonso IX of Le\u00f3n.\nEarly career.\nGiacinto Bobone was born into the noble Orsini family in Rome. He was appointed as cardinal-deacon in 1144 by Celestine II or Lucius II. Considered by the Roman Curia as an expert on Spain, Bobone conducted two legatine missions to Spain in (1154\u201355) and (1172\u201375) as the Cardinal-Deacon of Santa Maria in Cosmedin.\nPontificate.\nCelestine was elected on 29/30 March 1191 and ordained a priest 13 April 1191. He crowned Emperor Henry VI a day or two after his ordination. In 1192, Celestine recognized Tancred as king of Sicily, despite Henry VI's wife's claim. He threatened to excommunicate Henry VI for wrongfully keeping King Richard I of England imprisoned, but he could do little else since the college of cardinals were against it.\nHe placed Pisa under an interdict, which was lifted by his successor, Innocent III in 1198.\nCelestine, in 1192, sent a cardinal-priest of St. Lorenzo, Cinthius, to Denmark to address the discord between the Danish princes. Upon Cinthius' return to Rome, Celestine issued three papal bulls;\"Cum Romana ecclesia\", \"Etsi sedes debeat\", \"Quanto magnitudinem tuam\". These bulls advised the archbishop Absalon of Lund to instruct the King of Denmark to release the bishop of Schleswig. The bulls also threatened to excommunicate the offending Duke Valdemar, who had imprisoned the bishop of Schleswig, and place the kingdom of Denmark under interdict. The bishop would stay imprisoned until Pope Innocent III restarted the process in 1203.\nCelestine condemned King Alfonso IX of Le\u00f3n for his marriage to Theresa of Portugal on the grounds of consanguinity. Portugal and Le\u00f3n were placed under interdict. Then, in 1196, he excommunicated Alfonso IX for allying with the Almohad Caliphate while making war on Castile. Following his marriage with Berengaria of Castile, Celestine excommunicated Alfonso and placed an interdict over Le\u00f3n.\nIn December 1196, Celestine issued a bull acknowledging the possessions of the Teutonic Knights.\nDeath.\nCelestine would have resigned the papacy and recommended a successor (Cardinal Giovanni di San Paolo, O.S.B.) shortly before his death, but was not allowed to do so by the cardinals.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n\"initial text from the 9th edition (1876) of an old encyclopedia\""}

Nothing is known of his early life until he became chancellor of the church of Milan (perhaps as early as 1219, certainly in 1223\u201327). Pope Gregory IX made him a cardinal on 18 September 1227 with the diocese and of San Marco, and in 1228\u201329 sent him as legate in Lombardy and Tuscany, where the cities and communes had generally remained true to the Hohenstaufen emperor, Frederick II. He was dispatched in an attempt to bring these territories around to the papal side, but without success. In 1238, he was made cardinal bishop of Sabina.\nThe papal election of 1241, which elevated Celestine to the papal throne, was held under stringent conditions that hastened his death. The papal curia was disunited over the violent struggle to bring the Emperor and King of Sicily Frederick II to heel. One group of cardinals favored the ambitious schemes of the Gregorian Reform and aimed to humble Frederick as a papal vassal. Frederick, however, controlled as his unwilling guests in Tivoli two cardinals whom he had captured at sea, and in Rome Cardinal Giovanni Colonna was his ally, largely because the curia was in the hands of the archenemy of the Colonna family, the senator Matteo Rosso Orsini. The latter held the consistory captive under the control of his guards in the ramshackle palace of the Septizodium, where rain leaked through the roof of their chamber, mingled with the urine of Orsini's guards on the rooftiles. One of the cardinals, the Englishman Robert of Somercotes, fell ill and died.\nOne group of cardinals, which included Sinibaldo de' Fieschi (soon to be Pope Innocent IV) supported a candidate from the inner circle of Pope Gregory IX, who could be expected to pursue a hard line with Frederick II. Another group advocated a moderate middle course, not as allies of the Hohenstaufen, but desirous to achieve an end to the war in Italy. Overtures to Frederick II, however, were met with the impossible demand that if they wished the cardinals in his hands to return to Rome, they must elect as pope Otto of St. Nicholas, an amenable compromise figure. Matteo Rosso Orsini's candidate, Romano da Porto, who had persecuted scholars at the University of Paris, was considered unacceptable.\nOnly on 25 October 1241 was the cardinal bishop of Sabina finally elected by the required two-thirds majority, seven cardinals out of ten. He took the name Pope Celestine IV but occupied the throne for only seventeen days. It is said that this was nevertheless long enough for him to proceed, as his only significant act, with the excommunication of Matteo Rosso Orsini. This assertion is disputed, it being said that in fact, Orsini continued as Senator of Rome in 1242 and was Senator when Innocent IV (Fieschi) was elected; and that his son (the future Nicholas III) was made a cardinal in 1244. In any event, Celestine IV died before he could be crowned, on 10 November 1241, of fatigue and old age, and was entombed in Saint Peter's Basilica.\nReflist.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was also a monk and hermit who founded the order of the Celestines as a branch of the Benedictine order.\nHe was elected pope in the Catholic Church's last non-conclave papal election, ending a two-year impasse. Among the few edicts of his to remain in force is the confirmation of the right of the pope to resign; nearly all of his other official acts were annulled by his successor, Boniface VIII. On 13 December 1294, a week after issuing the decree, Celestine resigned, stating his desire to return to his humble, pre-papal life. He was subsequently imprisoned by Boniface in the castle of Fumone in the Lazio region, in order to prevent his potential installation as antipope. He died in prison on 19 May 1296.\nCelestine was canonized on 5 May 1313 by Pope Clement V. No subsequent pope has taken the name Celestine.\nEarly life.\nPietro Angelerio was born to Angelo Angelerio and Maria Leone in the rural region of Molise, in the Kingdom of Sicily. The exact village is believed to be Sant'Angelo Limosano, now part of the province of Campobasso in Italy. His father died when Pietro was five or six, leaving him the second-youngest of seven sons to have survived infancy, of twelve total born to Maria.\nMaria was particularly fond of Pietro and encouraged his spiritual development, imagining a different future for her son than becoming just a farmer or shepherd as were the local occupations. She sold some family property to hire a tutor for him, which engendered resentment and hostility from his brothers. Despite this, Pietro took to education well and quickly learned to read the psalter.\nHe became a Benedictine monk at the Abbey of Santa Maria di Faifoli in the Diocese of Benevento when he was 17. He showed an extraordinary disposition toward asceticism and solitude, and in the early 1230s retired to a solitary cavern on the Montagne del Morrone, hence his name (Peter of Morrone). He began attracting followers of his eremitic lifestyle, and gained a reputation as a miracle worker. In 1244, after a brief visit to Rome for his ordination, he left this retreat, and went with two companions to a similar cave on the even more remote Maiella mountain in the Abruzzi region of central Italy, where he continued to live as a strict ascetic according to the example of John the Baptist.\nFounding of the Celestines.\nWhile following an ascetic path in 1244, he founded the order subsequently named after him, the Celestines. A new religious community was formed, and in 1254 Pietro formally issued a rule formulated in accordance with his own practices, influenced by the writings of Peter Damian, a renowned reformist monk. While fundamentally Benedictine, the order also had ties to radical Franciscans, who were dismayed by the Church's increasing worldliness and political entanglements. A church was built at the foot of Morrone in 1259, and in June 1263 the new institution was formally approved by Pope Urban IV.\nHaving heard that it was probable that Pope Gregory X, then holding a council at Lyon, would suppress all such new orders as had been founded since the Lateran Council had commanded that such institutions should not be further multiplied, Pietro went to Lyon. There, in 1274, he succeeded in persuading Gregory to approve his new order, making it a branch of the Benedictines and following the Rule of Saint Benedict, but adding to it additional severities and privations. Gregory took it under papal protection, assured to it the possession of all property it might acquire, and endowed it with exemption from the authority of the ordinary. Nothing more was needed to ensure the rapid spread of the new association and Pietro lived to see himself as \"superior-general\" to thirty-six monasteries and more than six hundred monks.\nIn a chapter of the order held in 1293, the original monastery at Maiella being judged to be too desolate and exposed to too rigorous a climate, it was decided that the Abbey of the Holy Spirit in the plains near Sulmona should be the headquarters of the order and the residence of the general-superior, as it continued to be until the order was extinguished in the 18th century. Pietro took up residence in a cliffside hermitage overlooking the new monastery, but he would not remain undisturbed there for long.\nElection as pope.\nThe cardinals assembled at Perugia after the death of Pope Nicholas IV in April 1292. After more than two years, a consensus had still not been reached. Pietro, well known to the cardinals as a Benedictine hermit, sent the cardinals a letter warning them that divine vengeance would fall upon them if they did not quickly elect a pope. Latino Malabranca, the aged and ill Dean of the College of Cardinals cried out, \"In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, I elect brother Pietro di Morrone!\" The cardinals promptly ratified Malabranca's desperate decision. When sent for, Pietro obstinately refused to accept the papacy, and even, as Petrarch says, tried to flee, until he was finally persuaded by a deputation of cardinals accompanied by the king of Naples and the pretender to the throne of Hungary. Elected on 5 July 1294, he was crowned at Santa Maria di Collemaggio in the city of Aquila in the Abruzzo on 29 August, taking the name Celestine V.\nPapacy.\nShortly after assuming office, Celestine issued a papal bull granting a rare plenary indulgence to all pilgrims visiting Santa Maria di Collemaggio through its holy door on the anniversary of his papal coronation. The Celestinian forgiveness (\"Perdonanza Celestiniana\") festival is celebrated in L'Aquila every 28\u201329 August in commemoration of this event.\nWith no political experience, Celestine proved to be an especially weak and ineffectual pope. He held his office in the Kingdom of Naples, out of contact with the Roman Curia and under the complete power of King Charles II. He appointed the king's favorites to Church offices, sometimes several to the same office. One of these was Louis of Toulouse, whom Celestine ordered given clerical tonsure and minor orders, although this was not carried out. He renewed a decree of Pope Gregory X that had established stringent rules for papal conclaves after a similarly prolonged election. In one decree, he appointed three cardinals to govern the Church during Advent while he fasted, which was again refused.\nRealizing his lack of authority and personal incompatibility with papal duties, he consulted with Cardinal Benedetto Caetani (his eventual successor) about the possibility of resignation. This resulted in one final decree declaring the right of resignation. He promptly exercised this right, resigning on 13 December 1294, after five months and eight days as pope. In the formal instrument of renunciation, he cited as the causes moving him to the step: \"The desire for humility, for a purer life, for a stainless conscience, the deficiencies of his own physical strength, his ignorance, the perverseness of the people, his longing for the tranquility of his former life\". Having divested himself of every outward symbol of papal dignity, he slipped away from Naples and attempted to retire to his old life of solitude.\nThe next pope to resign of his own accord was Gregory XII in 1415 (to help end the Western Schism), followed by Benedict XVI in 2013, 719 years later.\nRetirement, death, and canonization.\nThe former Celestine, now reverted to Pietro Angelerio, was not allowed to become a hermit once again. Various parties had opposed his resignation and the new Pope Boniface VIII had reason to worry that one of them might install him as an antipope. To prevent this, he ordered Pietro to accompany him to Rome. Pietro escaped and hid in the woods before attempting to return to Sulmona to resume monastic life. This proved impossible, and Pietro was captured after an attempt to flee to Dalmatia was thwarted when a tempest forced his ship to return to port. Boniface imprisoned him in the castle of Fumone near Ferentino in Lazio, attended by two monks of his order, where Pietro died after 10 months at about the age of 81. His supporters spread the allegation that Boniface had treated him harshly and ultimately executed Pietro, but there is no clear historical evidence of this. Pietro was buried at Ferentino, but his body was subsequently moved to the Basilica of Santa Maria di Collemaggio in L'Aquila.\nPhilip IV of France, who had supported Celestine and bitterly opposed Boniface, nominated Celestine for sainthood following the election of Pope Clement V. The latter signed a decree of dispensation on 13 May 1306 to investigate the nomination. He was canonized on 5 May 1313 after a consistory in which Boniface's Caetani family was outvoted by members of the rival Colonna family.\nLegacy.\nMost modern interest in Celestine V has focused on his resignation. He was the first pope to formalize the resignation process and is often said to have been the first to resign; in fact he was preceded in this by Pontian (235), John XVIII (1009), Benedict IX (1045), and Gregory VI (1046). As noted above, Celestine's own decision was brought about by mild pressure from the Church establishment. His reinstitution of Gregory X's conclave system established by the papal bull \"Ubi periculum\" has been respected ever since.\nA 1966 visit by Pope Paul VI to Celestine's place of death in Ferentino along with his speech in homage of Celestine prompted speculation that the Pontiff was considering retirement.\nCelestine's remains survived the 2009 L'Aquila earthquake with one Italian spokesman saying it was \"another great miracle by the pope\". They were then recovered from the basilica shortly after the earthquake. While inspecting the earthquake damage during a 28 April 2009 visit to the L'Aquila, Pope Benedict XVI visited Celestine's remains in the badly damaged Santa Maria di Collemaggio and left the woolen pallium he wore during his papal inauguration in April 2005 on his glass casket as a gift. \nTo mark the 800th anniversary of Celestine's birth, Pope Benedict XVI proclaimed the Celestine year from 28 August 2009 through 29 August 2010. Benedict XVI visited the Sulmona Cathedral, near Aquila, on 4 July 2010 as part of his observance of the Celestine year and prayed before the altar consecrated by Celestine containing his relics on 10 October 1294.\nHis entry in the \"Martyrologium Romanum\" for 19 May reads as follows:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"Ad Castrum Fumorense prope Alatrium in Latio, natalis sancti Petri Caelestini, qui, cum vitam eremeticam in Aprutio ageret, fama sanctitatis et miraculorum clarus, octogenarius Romanus Pontifex electus est, assumpto nomine Caelestini Quinti, sed eodem anno munere se abdicavit et solitudinem recedere maluit.\"\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;At \"Castrum Fumorense\" near Alatri in Lazio, the birth of Saint Peter Celestine, who, when leading the life of a hermit in Abruzzo, being famous for his sanctity and miracles, was elected Roman Pontiff as an octogenarian, assumed the name Celestine V, but abandoned his office that same year and preferred to return to solitude.\nIn literature.\nA persistent tradition identifies Celestine V as the nameless figure Dante Alighieri sees among those in the antechamber of Hell, in the enigmatic verses:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\u2014\u200a\nThe first commentators to make this identification included Dante's son Jacopo Alighieri, followed by Graziolo Bambaglioli in 1324. The identification is also considered probable by recent scholars (e.g., Hollander, Barbara Reynolds, Simonelli, Padoan). Petrarch was moved to defend Celestine vigorously against the accusation of cowardice and some modern scholars (e.g., Mark Musa) have suggested Dante may have meant someone else (Esau, Diocletian and Pontius Pilate have been variously suggested).\nIn 1346, Petrarch declared in his \"De vita solitaria\" that Celestine's refusal was a virtuous example of solitary life.\nPope Celestine V is referenced in Chapter 88 of Dan Brown's \"Angels &amp; Demons\", where he is controversially referenced as an example of a murdered pope. Brown writes that an X-ray of his tomb \"revealed a ten-inch nail driven into the Pope's skull.\" While the reference to the X-ray is fictitious (no X-ray has ever been conducted on Celestine's tomb), it has been indeed alleged that Celestine was murdered, possibly by order of his successor, Pope Boniface VIII; however, there is no historical evidence of this. A 2013 examination of the half-inch hole in Celestine's skull found it to have occurred post-mortem, when the remains were already skeletonized, likely during a reburial.\nThe life of Pope Celestine V is dramatised in the plays (\"Story of a Humble Christian\") by Ignazio Silone in 1968 and \"Sunsets and Glories\" by Peter Barnes in 1990.\nHis life is the subject of the short story \"Brother of the Holy Ghost\" in Brendan Connell's short story collection \"The Life of Polycrates and Other Stories for Antiquated Children\".\nHe is the subject of a popular history by author Jon M. Sweeney, \"The Pope Who Quit: A True Medieval Tale of Mystery, Death, and Salvation\", published by Image Books/Random House in 2012. In 2013, HBO optioned the film rights.\nCelestine V is the subject of the poem by the modern Greek poet Constantine P. Cavafy.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The city population was 111,876 at the 2020 United States census, making Pueblo the ninth most populous city in Colorado. Pueblo is the principal city of the Pueblo, CO Metropolitan Statistical Area and a major city of the Front Range Urban Corridor.\nPueblo is situated at the confluence of the Arkansas River and Fountain Creek, south of the Colorado State Capitol in Denver. The area is considered semi-arid desert land, with approximately of precipitation annually. With its location in the \"Banana Belt\", Pueblo tends to get less snow than the other major cities in Colorado.\nPueblo is one of the largest steel-producing cities in the United States, for which reason Pueblo is referred to as the \"Steel City\". The city is also a hub of higher education, enrolling nearly 14,000 students between Colorado State University Pueblo and Pueblo Community College. The Historic Arkansas River Project (HARP) is a riverwalk in the Union Avenue Historic Commercial District, and shows the history of the devastating Pueblo Flood of 1921.\nHistory.\nIndigenous History.\nFrom 1050 to 1450, the area that is now Pueblo was first inhabited by Paleo-Indians and Archaic peoples, as well as people of the Apishapa culture. By 1500, the Ute hunter-gatherers inhabited the region, who hunted in the mountains during the summer and wintered in warmer areas, such as modern-day Pueblo, during the winter. In 1521, Spain assumed control of the land, however, very little settlement or occupation ever occurred. By the time of the 17th century, the Ute acquired horses from the Spanish allowing them to hunt bison on the plains. The Ute bands of the Pueblo area were the Tabaguache and the Muache. Along the eastern Arkansas River, the Jicarilla Apache lived in villages and hunted bison, and grew corn, beans, and squash.\nDuring the middle of the 18th century, the Comanche came through the middle of Colorado on horseback, claiming the Arkansas River valley and pushing up against the boundary of New Spain. The Ute and Comanche formed an alliance, trading and raiding along modern-day Southern Colorado and Northern New Mexico. In 1779 between modern-day Pueblo and Colorado City, Juan Bautista de Anza invaded the area and killed the Comanche leader Cuerno Verde. Despite the loss, the indigenous peoples continued to fight back against the Spanish, with the Comanche claiming swathes of land from Southeastern Colorado to Texas.\nBy the early 1800's, the Arapaho entered and claimed modern-day Pueblo as well, having a fierce rivalry with the Ute. The area was also frequented by the Cheyenne and the Pawnee.\nEl Pueblo.\nJames Beckwourth, George Simpson, and other trappers such as Mathew Kinkead and John Brown, claimed to have helped construct the plaza that became known as El Pueblo around 1842. According to accounts of residents who traded at the plaza (including that of George Simpson), the Fort Pueblo Massacre happened sometime between December 23 and 25, 1854, by a war party of Utes and Jicarilla Apaches under the leadership of Tierra Blanca, a Ute chief. They allegedly killed between fifteen and nineteen men, as well as captured two children and one woman. The trading post was abandoned after the raid.\nEarly development: railroads, steel, expansion, and orphanages.\nIn 1848, the United States acquired the Pueblo County area through the Mexican Cession, ending the Mexican-American War. The Colorado Gold Rush began in 1858, springing interest in the area back up. Independence, a traveling camp opened on the east side of Fountain creek, later being named Fountain City once Josiah Smith's prospecting party arrived in September. Pueblo as well as Fountain City were both platted in 1860, with Pueblo later being re-platted in 1870. Pueblo became the namesake of the county when the Colorado Territory was established by Congress in 1861.\nBy the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861, the area was used as a secret gathering place for Coloradoan recruits of the Confederate States Army.\nThe Cheyenne and Arapahoe were ousted from Colorado to Oklahoma in 1867 from the Medicine Lodge Treaty, and the Ute were ousted to Western Colorado via the Treaty of 1868. 1869 saw Charles Goodnight pioneering the Goodnight-Loving Trail, afterwards he grazed cattle in the region. His ranch headquarters were established in Rock Canyon, west of Pueblo in the Nolan Grant. The bison population nationwide began to significantly lower, leading to cattle heads from the plains coming during the 1870's.\nThe current city of Pueblo represents the consolidation of four towns: Pueblo (incorporated 1870), South Pueblo (incorporated 1873), Central Pueblo (incorporated 1882), and Bessemer (incorporated 1886). Pueblo, South Pueblo, and Central Pueblo legally consolidated as the City of Pueblo between March 9 and April 6, 1886. Bessemer joined Pueblo in 1894.\nThe consolidated city became a major economic and social center of Colorado, and was home to important early Colorado families such as the Thatchers, the Ormans, and the Adams. By the early 1870s the city was being hailed as a beacon of development, with newspapers like the \"Chicago Tribune\" boasting of how the region's lawless reputation was giving way to orderly agriculture with triumphalist rhetoric. One author crowed of Pueblo that \"the necessity exists no longer for Sharp's rifles and revolvers. These have been [supplanted] by the plow and the mowing-machine.\"\nPueblo's development stretched beyond agriculture. Steel emerged as a key industry very early, and in 1909 the city was considered the only steel town west of the Mississippi River.\nUntil a series of major floods culminated in the Great Flood of 1921, Pueblo was considered the 'Saddle-Making capital of the World'. Roughly one-third of Pueblo's downtown businesses were lost in this flood, along with a substantial number of buildings. Pueblo struggled with this significant loss, but has had a resurgence in growth.\nHistorically, many people were influenced by the orphanages of Pueblo, and the homes are now all historical sites. The three orphanages in Pueblo were known as Sacred Heart, Lincoln, and McClelland. Lincoln was the first historically black orphanage in Colorado, and one of only seven in the country. Sacred Heart was run by the Catholic Welfare Bureau, while McClelland was run by the Lutheran Church. Several children from Cuba were placed at Sacred Heart as part of \"Operation Pedro Pan\". Though the orphanages in Pueblo are no longer in service, the buildings still exist and have transformed with the times. According to the \"Rocky Mountain News\", in 1988 the Sacred Heart Orphanage was bought by the Pueblo Housing Authority and turned into 40 small-family housing units.\nSteel mill.\nThe main industry in Pueblo for most of its history was the Colorado Fuel and Iron (CF&amp;I) Steel Mill on the south side of town. For nearly a century the CF&amp;I was the largest employer in the state of Colorado. The steel-market crash of 1982 led to the decline of the company. After several bankruptcies, the company was acquired by Oregon Steel Mills and changed its name to Rocky Mountain Steel Mills. The buyout, as well as the end of the union contract in 1997 led to a union strike over pension liabilities, as well as working conditions, wherein the union argued the new owners still needed to pay the pension liabilities provided by the previous owners. With the conclusion of the strike on December 30, 1997, CF&amp;I had replaced several hundred union workers with local employees.\nIn September 2004, both United Steelworkers locals 2102 and 3267 won the strike and the unfair labor practice charges. All of the striking steel workers returned to their jobs, and the company paid them the back pay owed for the seven years they were on strike. In 2007, shortly after Oregon Steel made amends with the union and its workers, Evraz Group, one of Russia's biggest steel producers, agreed to buy the company for $2.3 billion.\nOf the many production and fabrication mills that once existed on the site, only the steel production (electric furnaces, used for scrap recycling), rail, rod, bar, and seamless tube mills are still in operation. The wire mill was sold in the late 1990s to Davis Wire, which produced products such as fence and nails under the CF&amp;I brand name. The facility operated blast furnaces until 1982, when the steel market collapsed. The main blast furnace structures were torn down in 1989 and the remaining ones in 1990.\nSeveral of the administration buildings, including the main office building, dispensary, and tunnel gatehouse were purchased in 2003 by the Bessemer Historical Society. In 2006, they underwent renovation. In addition to housing the historic CF&amp;I Archives, they also house the Steelworks Museum of Industry and Culture.\n\"Melting Pot of the West\".\nDue to the growth of the CF&amp;I steel mill and the employment that it offered, Pueblo in the early twentieth century attracted a large number of immigrant laborers. The groups represented led to Pueblo becoming the most ethnically and culturally diverse city in Colorado and the West. At one point, more than 40 languages were spoken in the steel mill and more than two-dozen foreign language newspapers were published in the city. Irish, Italian, German, Slovenian, Greek, Jewish, Lithuanian, Russian, Hungarian, Japanese, and African-American groups arrived in the area at the turn of the century and remain to the present time. The convergence of cultures led to a cosmopolitan character to the city that resulted in a number of ethnically rooted neighborhoods that are typically not seen west of the Mississippi. Respective cultural groups maintain cultural festivals to the present, with the city being home to locations of the Order Sons of Italy, American Slovenian Catholic Union, and I.O.O.F., among others.\nColorado Mental Health Institute at Pueblo.\nAnother major employer in Pueblo is Colorado State Hospital. The hospital is the preeminent mental health facility in the Rocky Mountain region. Established in 1879 as the Colorado State Insane Asylum, it was renamed as the Colorado State Hospital in 1917. In 1991, the name was changed to the Colorado Mental Health Institute at Pueblo (CMHIP). The Robert L. Hawkins High Security Forensic Institute opened in June 2009 and is a 200-bed, high-security facility.\nHome of Heroes.\nPueblo is the hometown of four Medal of Honor recipients (tied only with Holland, Michigan, also with four, each having more than any other municipality in the United States): William J. Crawford, Carl L. Sitter, Raymond G. Murphy, and Drew D. Dix. President Dwight D. Eisenhower, upon presenting Raymond G. \"Jerry\" Murphy with his medal in 1953, commented, \"What is it... something in the water out there in Pueblo? All you guys turn out to be heroes!\"\nIn 1993, Pueblo City Council adopted the tagline \"Home of Heroes\" for the city due to the fact that Pueblo can claim more recipients of the Medal per capita than any other city in the United States. On July 1, 1993, the \"Congressional Record\" recognized Pueblo as the \"Home of Heroes.\" A memorial to the recipients of the medal is at the Pueblo Convention Center.\nFrom 1846 to 1847 three detachments of the Mormon Battalion wintered in Pueblo during the Mexican\u2013American War.\nGeography.\nPueblo is south of Denver and is on the front range of the Rocky Mountains. Pueblo sits on the western edge of the Great Plains in a high desert area of terrain in southern Colorado and is near the western edge of the Southwestern Tablelands ecology region.\nAccording to the 2020 United States census, the city had a total area of , including of water.\nClimate.\nPueblo has a Semi-arid climate (K\u00f6ppen \"BSk\"), with four distinct seasons. Winter days are usually mild, but the high does not surpass freezing on an average 14.4 days per year, and lows fall to or below on 6.2 nights.

He was a member of the Dave Brubeck Quartet and composed the group's biggest hit, \"Take Five\". The song remains the best-selling jazz song of all time.\nIn addition to his work with Brubeck, he led several groups and collaborated with Gerry Mulligan, Chet Baker, Jim Hall, and Ed Bickert. After years of chain smoking and poor health, Desmond succumbed to lung cancer in 1977 after a tour with Brubeck.\nEarly life.\nDesmond was born Paul Emil Breitenfeld in San Francisco, California, in 1924, the son of Shirley (n\u00e9e King) and Emil Aron Breitenfeld. His grandfather Sigmund Breitenfeld, a medical doctor, was born on 17 November 1857, in \u010cesk\u00e1 Kamenice in Bohemia; he emigrated to the US in 1885 and on 2 May 1886, in New York, married Hermina Lewy. They had four children (including Emil, father of Paul Emil). Paul Desmond and members of his father's family \"frequently speculated as to whether Sigmund or Hermine Breitenfeld had Jewish backgrounds\", but they did not identify as Jewish, or observe Jewish traditions. However, Fred Barton, songwriter/arranger and Desmond's cousin, found extensive genealogical proof that both the Breitenfeld and L\u00f6wy families were Bohemian Jews. The Breitenfeld family in Bohemia and Vienna featured musicians in every generation throughout the 1800s, 1900s, and to the present day. Desmond's mother, born Shirley King, was of an Irish Catholic family.\nDesmond's father Emil Breitenfeld was a pianist, organist, arranger, and composer who accompanied silent films in movie theaters and produced musical arrangements for printed publication and for live theatrical productions. During World War I, while training with the 17th New York Regiment in Plattsburgh, New York, he composed \"The Last Long Mile\", one of the best-known soldiers' songs of that war.\nDesmond's mother Shirley was emotionally unstable throughout his upbringing, and appears to have suffered from obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder and other mental illnesses. Starting in 1933, Desmond spent nearly five years living with relatives in New Rochelle, New York due to his mother's mental health problems.\nDesmond began playing the\nclarinet at age twelve, and continued throughout his time at San Francisco Polytechnic High School. While in high school, Desmond wanted to study the violin, but his father dissuaded him, saying that violin players were \"a dime a dozen...with the violin, you'll starve.\" Desmond developed a talent for writing during high school as well, becoming co-editor of his high school newspaper. In that capacity, he interviewed comedian Bob Hope for his school newspaper during one of Hope's visits to San Francisco. After high school, Desmond enrolled at San Francisco State College where he majored in English. While in college, Desmond began playing the alto saxophone, after being influenced by the likes of Lester Young and Charlie Parker. In his first year of college, Desmond was drafted into the United States Army and joined the Army band while stationed in San Francisco. He spent three years in the military, but his unit was not called to combat.\nFollowing his military discharge, Paul Emil Breitenfeld legally changed his last name from Breitenfeld to Desmond in 1946. He told many stories over the years regarding how he chose the name Desmond, but his biographer Doug Ramsey offers an account from Desmond's friend Hal Strack that the two were listening to the Glenn Miller band singer Johnny Desmond in 1942, and Desmond told Strack \"that's such a great name. It's so smooth and yet it's uncommon...If I ever decide I need another name, it's going to be Desmond.\"\nDesmond was married from 1947 to 1949 to Duane Reeves Lamon. He never remarried.\nCareer.\nAfter World War II, Desmond started working in the San Francisco Bay Area, working as a backing musician. He worked occasionally for Dave Brubeck at the Geary Cellar in San Francisco. For several weeks, he led a small jazz combo at the Band Box in Redwood City that included Dave Brubeck. Desmond had a falling out with Brubeck when he resigned from the Band Box and prevented Brubeck from taking over the residency. In 1950, Desmond joined the band of Jack Fina and toured with Fina for several months, but he returned to California after hearing Brubeck's trio on the radio and deciding that he should repair his relationship with Brubeck and attempt to join Brubeck's increasingly successful band.\nAt the time, Brubeck and his wife Iola had three small children, and Brubeck had instructed Iola not to let Desmond set foot in the family home. Desmond appeared at Brubeck's San Francisco apartment one day while Dave was in the back yard hanging diapers on a laundry line, and Iola, defying Brubeck's wishes, let Desmond in and took him to Dave. Desmond offered to perform arranging and administrative work for Brubeck's band, and to babysit Brubeck's children, and Brubeck finally relented and agreed to try working with Desmond again.\nDave Brubeck Quartet.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSome people called him the stork\u2014'Cause he would stand on one leg and leaned on the piano. But that ... that was when he was playing great. What used to scare me is I'd look at him and it would just be whites in his eyes, wouldn't be any eyeballs.\nDave Brubeck(PBS interview with Hedrick Smith)\nDesmond met Dave Brubeck in 1944 in the military. Brubeck was trying out for the 253rd Army band, to which Desmond belonged. After making the cut he\u2014unlike Desmond\u2014was sent overseas in 1944, to Europe. Desmond once told Marian McPartland of National Public Radio's \"Piano Jazz\" that he was taken aback by the chord changes which Brubeck introduced during that 1944 audition. After Desmond persuaded Brubeck to hire him following his stint with Jack Fina, the two had a contract drafted (of which Brubeck was the sole signatory); the wording forbade Brubeck from firing him, ensured Brubeck's status as group leader, and gave Desmond twenty percent of all profits generated from the quartet. This established the Dave Brubeck Quartet, which lasted from 1951 to December 1967.\nThe quartet became especially popular with college-age audiences, often performing in college settings, including their ground-breaking 1953 album \"Jazz at Oberlin\" at Oberlin College and at the campuses of Ohio University and the University of Michigan. The success of the quartet led to a \"Time\" magazine piece on them in 1954, with the famous cover featuring Brubeck's face.\nAfter drummer Joe Dodge decided to leave the group, Joe Morello joined in late 1956, on Desmond's recommendation. Despite this, differences in musical aspirations and taste made their relationship a tense one for many years. Desmond hoped for a \"tinky-boom\" background-type drummer while Morello wanted to be recognized and featured. During Morello's first performance with the group, he was featured by Brubeck and received an ovation from the audience for his solo. Desmond resented this, and threatened to leave the group. Brubeck managed to keep both Desmond and Morello in the group but with frictions between them for years. Desmond's grudge against Morello could also be heard during their performance. In their 'Take The \u2018A\u2019 Train' performance in Hanover, Germany in 1958, for example, Desmond's playing sounded lackluster and uninterested. After a passage of rhythmically complex playing from Morello, Desmond would sometimes play very quietly and or even drop out for a few bars. In their later years they reconciled and became close friends.\nThe Dave Brubeck Quartet played until 1967, when Brubeck switched his musical focus from performance to composition and dissolved the group. During the 1970s Desmond joined Brubeck for several reunion tours, including \"Two Generations of Brubeck\". Accompanying them were Brubeck's sons Chris Brubeck, Dan Brubeck and Darius Brubeck. In 1976 Desmond played 25 shows in 25 nights with Brubeck, touring the United States by bus.\nOther collaborations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nPlaying with Desmond and Mulligan was really mind-blowing because they were such heroes for me.\nPerry Robinson\nDesmond worked several times during his career with baritone saxophonist and band leader Gerry Mulligan. They made two studio albums together (\"Gerry Mulligan - Paul Desmond Quartet\" (1957), and \"Two of a Mind\" (1962)). In June 1969 Desmond appeared at the New Orleans Jazz Festival with Gerry Mulligan, with favorable reactions from critics and audience members. During Brubeck's \"Two Generations\" tours, Desmond and Mulligan shared the stage in 1974. Unlike Brubeck, Mulligan had much in common with Desmond; they were similar in their interests and humor, and both were prone to addiction.\nDesmond had a celebrated studio partnership with guitarist Jim Hall. Hall played on several albums recorded by Desmond between 1959 and 1963 for Warner Bros. and RCA Victor. After a period of inactivity, Desmond was asked to play the Half Note in New York City in 1971 by Hall. With his customary wryness, Desmond said that he took the job only because he was nearby and could tumble out of bed to work. The two continued to play at the club to packed audiences. Desmond also joined the Modern Jazz Quartet for a Christmas concert in 1971 at the New York Town Hall.\nDesmond was a guest artist on five tracks by Chet Baker recorded between 1975 and 1977. These were released on the albums \"She Was Too Good to Me\" (CTI, 1974), \"You Can't Go Home Again\", and \"The Best Thing for You\". Baker and Desmond also appeared together on two tracks included on Jim Hall's 1975 \"Concierto\" album.\nDesmond met Canadian guitarist Ed Bickert through a recommendation by Jim Hall, and Desmond performed with Bickert at several clubs in the Toronto area during 1974\u20131975. Desmond featured Bickert on his 1975 studio album \"Pure Desmond\", and the two played together at the 1976 Edmonton Jazz Festival. Live recordings of that concert and club dates with Bickert performed during 1974-1975 were released during and after Desmond's lifetime.\nPersonal life.\nIn their private lives Dave Brubeck and his family were very close to Paul Desmond, though the two men possessed very different personalities. Darius Brubeck recalls thinking that Desmond was his uncle almost into adolescence. Desmond grew especially close to Dave's son Michael, to whom he left his saxophone upon his death. Desmond was also described as a womanizer who was unable to form (and was uninterested in maintaining) steady relationships with women, though he had no shortage of female companions throughout his life. Desmond is reported to have quipped, upon seeing a former girlfriend on the street, \"There she goes, not with a whim but a banker\" (a semi-Spoonerism reference to T.S. Eliot's \"This is the way the world ends / Not with a bang but a whimper\"). In contrast, Brubeck was deeply religious and a stalwart family man.&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nI have won several prizes as the world's slowest alto player, as well as a special award in 1961 for quietness.\nPaul Desmond\nDesmond enjoyed reading works by thinkers of his generation like Timothy Leary and Jack Kerouac who advocated or relied upon the use of recreational drugs, and sometimes used LSD. He had several addictions, including Dewar's Scotch whisky and Pall Mall cigarettes. In the 1940s and 1950s, Desmond frequently took amphetamines, and in the 1970s he was known to use cocaine. His chemical dependency problems would sometimes drain him of energy on the road. Clarinetist Perry Robinson recalls in his autobiography that Desmond would sometimes need a vitamin B12 shot just to go on playing during his later career.&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nPristine, perfect. One of the great livers of our time. Awash in Dewar's and full of health.\nPaul Desmond\nDesmond died on May 30, 1977, not of his heavy alcohol habit but of lung cancer, the result of his longtime heavy smoking. He was 52. Never without his humor, after he was diagnosed with cancer he expressed pleasure at the health of his liver. His last concert was with Brubeck in February 1977, in New York City. His fans were unaware of his rapidly declining health. Desmond specified in his will that all proceeds from \"Take Five\" would go to the Red Cross following his death. Desmond reportedly owned a Baldwin grand piano, which he lent to Bradley Cunningham, owner of Bradley's piano bar in Greenwich Village, provided that Cunningham move the large piano back to Desmond's Upper West Side apartment to become part of Desmond's estate. After this long and expensive process, Desmond willed the piano to Cunningham, a characteristic and final prank. The Paul Desmond Papers (and other https://) are held at the Holt-Atherton Special Collections and Archives in the University of the Pacific Library.\nDesmond was cremated and his ashes were scattered.\nStyle.\nDesmond produced a light, melodic tone on the alto saxophone, trying to sound, he said, \"like a dry martini.\" With a style that was similar to that of Lee Konitz, one of his influences, he quickly became one of the best-known saxophonists from the West Coast's cool school of jazz. Much of the success of the classic Brubeck quartet was due to the juxtaposition of his airy style over Brubeck's sometimes relatively heavy, polytonal piano work.\nDesmond's improvisation is praised for its logical structure and lyricism. His gift for improvised counterpoint is perhaps most evident on his two albums with baritone saxophonist Gerry Mulligan (\"Mulligan-Desmond Quartet\" and \"Two of a Mind\"). In his playing Desmond was also notable for his ability to produce extremely high notes, the altissimo register, on his saxophone.\nDesmond played a Selmer \"Super Balanced Action\" model alto saxophone with an M. C. Gregory model 4A-18M hard rubber mouthpiece, both dating from circa 1951, with a moderately stiff Rico 3 \u00bd reed.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "24160", "revid": "10863197", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24160", "title": "Piper (plant)", "text": "Genus of plants\nPiper, the pepper plants or pepper vines, is an economically and ecologically important genus in the family Piperaceae. The genus contains about 1,000\u20132,000 species of shrubs, herbs, and lianas, many of which are dominant species in their native habitat. The diversification of this taxon is of interest to understanding the evolution of plants.\nThe scientific name \"Piper\" and the common name \"pepper\" are derived from the Sanskrit term \"pippali\", denoting the long pepper (\"P.\u00a0longum\").\nDescription.\nMost \"Piper\" species are either herbaceous or vines; some grow as shrubs or almost as small trees.\nTaxonomy.\nPepper plants belong to the magnoliids, which are angiosperms but neither monocots nor eudicots. Their family, Piperaceae, is most closely related to the lizardtail family (Saururaceae), which in fact generally look like smaller, more delicate and amphibious pepper plants. Both families have characteristic tail-shaped inflorescences covered in tiny flowers. A somewhat less close relative is the pipevine family (Aristolochiaceae). A well-known and very close relative \u2013 also part of the Piperaceae \u2013 are the radiator plants of the genus \"Peperomia\".\nEvolution.\nThe earliest fossil of \"Piper\" is of \u2020\"Piper margaritae\" from the Late Cretaceous (Maastrichtian) of Colombia. \"P.\u00a0margaritae\" appears to be nested within the clade \"Schilleria\", indicating extensive Cretaceous diversification of \"Piper\" into the multiple extant clades, coinciding with the final breakup of Gondwana. This contrasts with previous theories assuming a younger radiation of the genus. An earlier potential record is of \u2020\"Piper arcuatile\" from the Cenomanian to Santonian Kaltag Formation of Yukon, although this affinity to \"Piper\" is not entirely reliable.\nSpecies.\nThe largest number of \"Piper\" species are found in the Americas (about 700 species), with about 300 species from Southern Asia. There are smaller groups of species from the South Pacific (about 40 species) and Africa (about 15 species). The American, Asian, and South Pacific groups each appear to be monophyletic; the affinity of the African species is unclear.\nSome species are sometimes segregated into the genera \"Pothomorphe\", \"Macropiper\", \"Ottonia\", \"Arctottonia\", \"Sarcorhachis\", \"Trianaeopiper\", and \"Zippelia\", but other sources keep them in \"Piper\".\nThe species called \"\"Piper aggregatum\" and \"P.\u00a0fasciculatum\"\" are actually \"Lacistema aggregatum\", a plant from the family Lacistemataceae.\nDistribution and ecology.\n\"Piper\" species have a pantropical distribution, and are most commonly found in the understory of lowland tropical forests, but can also occur in clearings and in higher elevation life zones such as cloud forests; one species \u2013 the Japanese Pepper (\"P.\u00a0kadsura\") from southern Japan and southernmost Korea \u2013 is subtropical and can tolerate light winter frost. Peppers are often dominant species where they are found.\nA few species, commonly called \"ant pipers\" (e.g. \"Piper cenocladum\"), live in a mutualism with ants. The fruit of the \"Piper\" plant, called a peppercorn when it is round and pea-sized, as is usual, is distributed in the wild mainly by birds, but small fruit-eating mammals \u2013 e.g. bats of the genus \"Carollia\" \u2013 are also important. Despite the high content of chemicals that are noxious to herbivores, some have evolved the ability to withstand the chemical defences of pepper plants, for example the sematurine moth \"Homidiana subpicta\" or some flea beetles of the genus \"Lanka\". The latter can be significant pests to pepper growers.\nUses.\nMany pepper plants make good ornamentals for gardens in subtropical or warmer regions. Pepper vines can be used much as ivy in temperate climates, while other species, like lacquered pepper (\"P.\u00a0magnificum\") grow as sizeable, compact and attractive shrubs with tough and shiny leaves. Smaller species, like Celebes pepper (\"P.\u00a0ornatum\") with its finely patterned leaves, are also suitable as indoor pot plants.\nUnsustainable logging of tropical primary forests is threatening a number of peppers. The extent of the effect of such wholesale habitat destruction on the genus is unknown, but in the forests of Ecuador \u2013 the only larger region for which comprehensive data exists \u2013 more than a dozen species are known to be on the brink of extinction. On the other hand, other \"Piper\" species (e.g. spiked pepper, \"P.\u00a0aduncum\") have been widely distributed as a result of human activity and are a major invasive species in certain areas.\nThe most significant human use of \"Piper\" is not for its looks however, but ultimately for the wide range of powerful secondary compounds found particularly in the fruits.\nCulinary.\nCulinary use of pepper plants is attested perhaps as early as 9,000 years ago. Peppercorn remains were found among the food refuse left by Hoabinhian artisans at Spirit Cave, Thailand. It is likely that these plants were collected from the wild rather than deliberately grown.\nUse of peppercorns as pungent spice is significant on an international scale. By classical antiquity, there was a vigorous trade of spices including black pepper (\"P.\u00a0nigrum\") from South Asia to Europe. The \"Apicius\", a recipe collection complied about 400 AD, mentions \"pepper\" as a spice for most main dishes. In the late Roman Empire, black pepper was expensive, but was available readily enough to be used more frequently than salt or sugar.\nAs Europe moved into the Early Middle Ages, trade routes deteriorated and the use of pepper declined somewhat, but peppercorns, storing easily and having a high mass per volume, never ceased to be a profitable trade item. In the Middle Ages, international traders were nicknamed \"Pfeffers\u00e4cke\" (\"pepper-sacks\") in German towns of the Hanseatic League and elsewhere. Later, wars were fought by European powers, between themselves and in complex alliances and enmities with Indian Ocean states, in part about control of the supply of spices, perhaps the most archetypal being black pepper fruit. Today, peppercorns of the three preparations (green, white and black) are one of the most widely used spices of plant origin worldwide.\nDue to the wide distribution of \"Piper\", the fruit of other species are also important spices, many of them internationally. Long pepper (\"P.\u00a0longum\"), is possibly the second-most popular \"Piper\" spice internationally; it has a rather chili-like \"heat\" and the whole inflorescence is used as the fruits are tiny. Cubeb (\"P.\u00a0cubeba\"), also known as tailed pepper, played a major role in the spice trade. Reputedly Philip IV of Spain suppressed trade in cubeb peppercorns at the end of the 1630s to capitalize on his share of the black pepper trade. It remains a significant spice around the Indian Ocean region today, however. West African pepper (\"P.\u00a0guineense\"), is commonly used in West African cuisine, and is sometimes used in the East African \"berbere\" spice mix. This species, despite being traded more extensively in earlier times, is less common outside Africa today.\nNot only the seeds of \"Piper\" are used in cooking. West African Pepper leaves, known locally as \"uziza\", are used as a flavoring vegetable in Nigerian stews. In Mexican-influenced cooking, \"hoja santa\" or Mexican pepperleaf (\"P.\u00a0auritum\") has a variety of uses. In Southeast Asia, leaves of two species of \"Piper\" have major importance in cooking: lolot (\"P.\u00a0lolot\") is used to wrap meat for grilling in the Indochina region, while wild betel (\"P.\u00a0sarmentosum\") is used raw or cooked as a vegetable in Malay and Thai cuisine; The stems and roots of \"Piper chaba\" are used as a spice in Bangladeshi cuisine.\nMedicine.\nCubeb (\"P. cubeba\") has been used in folk medicine and herbalism as well as, particularly in the early 20th century, as a cigarette flavoring. \"P.\u00a0darienense\" is used medically by the Guna people of the Panama-Colombia border region, and elsewhere it is used to intoxicate fish which then can be easily caught. Spiked pepper, often called \"matico\" appears to have strong disinfectant and antibiotic properties. Black pepper (\"P.\u00a0nigrum\") essential oil is sometimes used in herbalism, and long pepper (\"P.\u00a0longum\") is similarly employed in Ayurveda, where it was an ingredient of \"Triphala Guggulu\" and (together with black pepper) of \"Trikatu\" pills, used for \"rasayana\" (rejuvenating and detoxifying) purposes.\nOne \"Piper\" species has gained large-scale use as a stimulant. Betel (\"P.\u00a0betle\") leaves are used to wrap betel palm nut slices; its sap helps release the stimulating effect of these \"cookies\" which are widely known as \"pan\" in India.\nConversely, another \"Piper\" species, kava (\"P.\u00a0methysticum\"), is used for its depressant and euphoriant effects. In the Pacific region, where it has been widely spread as a canoe plant, kava is used to produce a calming and socializing drink somewhat similar to alcohol and benzodiazepines but without many of the negative side effects and less of an addiction risk. It has also become popular elsewhere in recent decades, and is used as a medical plant. However, pills that contain parts of the whole plant have occasionally shown a strong hepatotoxic effect, which has led to the banning of kava in many countries. On the other hand, the traditional preparation of the root as a calming drink appears to pose little, if any, such hazard.\nIn science.\nThe genus contains species suitable for studying natural history, molecular biology, natural products chemistry, community ecology, and evolutionary biology.\n\"Piper\" is a model genus for research in ecology and evolutionary biology. The diversity and ecological importance of the genus makes it a strong candidate for ecological and evolutionary studies. Most research has focused on the economically important species \"P.\u00a0nigrum\" (black pepper), \"P.\u00a0methysticum\" (kava), and \"P.\u00a0betle\" (betel). A recent study based on DNA sequence analysis suggest that \"P.\u00a0nigrum\" originated in the Western Ghats hot spot in India.\nThe obligate and facultative ant mutualists found in some \"Piper\" species have a strong influence on their biology, making them ideal systems for research on the evolution of symbioses and the effect of mutualisms on biotic communities.\nImportant secondary metabolites found in pepper plants are piperine and chavicine, which were first isolated from Black Pepper, and reported to have antibiotic activities. Preliminary research reports has shown that piperine has an antibacterial activity against various bacteria such as \"S.\u00a0aureus\", \"Streptococcus mutans\", and gastric cancer pathogen \"Helicobacter pylori\" and decreased \"H. pylori\" toxin entry to gastric epithelial cells. The piperidine functional group is named after the former, and piperazine (which is not found in \"P.\u00a0nigrum\" in noticeable quantities) was in turn named after piperidine.\nThe significant secondary metabolites of kava are kavalactones and flavokawains. Pipermethystine is suspected to be the main hepatotoxic compound in this plant's stems and leaves.\nRepelling insects.\nStudies have been done to determine the effectiveness of piper leaves to repel different types of insects.\nCapuchin monkeys have been recorded by BBC Earth rubbing the piper leaves on them to repel insects.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

His wife brought a settlement of \u00a35,000 into the marriage as her 'separate estate', and has since inherited an additional \u00a34,000 on the death of her father; but Mrs Bennet and her daughters face living only on the interest from these sums upon Mr Bennet's death. To his regret, he has failed to save out of the income from the Longbourn estate to provide enhanced marriage portions for his daughters. From the Bennets' perspective, it is imperative that at least one of their daughters marry well to support the others, which is a primary motivation driving the plot.\n\"Pride and Prejudice\" has consistently appeared near the top of lists of \"most-loved books\" among literary scholars and the reading public. It has become one of the most popular novels in English literature, with over 20 million copies sold, and has inspired many derivatives in modern literature. For more than a century, dramatic adaptations, reprints, unofficial sequels, films, and TV versions of \"Pride and Prejudice\" have portrayed the memorable characters and themes of the novel, reaching mass audiences.\nPlot summary.\nIn the early 19th century, during the Napoleonic Wars, the Bennet family lives at their Longbourn estate, situated near the small town of Meryton in Hertfordshire, England. Mrs. Bennet's greatest desire is to marry off her five daughters to secure their futures. A regiment of Militia is encamped outside the town, and the younger Bennet daughters flirt with the officers.\nThe arrival of Mr. Bingley, a rich bachelor who rents the neighbouring Netherfield estate, gives her hope that one of her daughters might contract a marriage to their advantage, because, as stated in the novel's opening sentence, \"It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife\". At a ball, the family is introduced to the Netherfield party, including Mr. Bingley, his two sisters, Caroline, who is unmarried, and Louisa, who is married to Mr. Hurst, and his closest friend Mr. Darcy. Mr. Bingley's friendly and cheerful manner earns him popularity among the guests. He appears interested in Jane, the eldest Bennet daughter. Mr. Darcy, reputed to be twice as wealthy as Mr. Bingley, is haughty and aloof, causing a decided dislike of him. He declines to dance with Elizabeth, the second-eldest Bennet daughter, as she is \"not handsome enough\". Although she jokes about it with her friend, Elizabeth is deeply offended. Despite this first impression, Mr. Darcy secretly begins to find himself drawn to Elizabeth as they continue to encounter each other at social events, appreciating her wit and frankness.\nMr. Collins, a recently ordained clergyman and, as a distant cousin, the presumptive inheritor of the Longbourn estate, visits the Bennet family with the intention of finding a wife among the five girls under the advice of his patroness Lady Catherine de Bourgh, also revealed to be Mr. Darcy's aunt. He decides to pursue Elizabeth. The Bennet family meets the charming militia officer George Wickham, who tells Elizabeth in confidence that Mr. Darcy had treated him badly in the past. Elizabeth's prejudice toward Mr. Darcy leads her to believe Wickham. Elizabeth dances with Mr. Darcy at a ball where Mrs. Bennet hints loudly that she expects Jane and Bingley to become engaged. Elizabeth rejects Mr. Collins's marriage proposal, to her mother's fury and her father's relief. Mr. Collins subsequently proposes to Charlotte Lucas, a friend of Elizabeth's, and is accepted. Having heard Mrs. Bennet's words at the ball, and disapproving of the marriage, Mr. Darcy prompts Mr. Bingley to leave for London and then, supported by the two sisters, persuades him not to return to Netherfield. A heartbroken Jane visits her Aunt and Uncle Gardiner in London to raise her spirits, while Elizabeth's hatred for Mr. Darcy grows, as she suspects he was responsible for Mr. Bingley's departure.\nIn the spring, Elizabeth visits Charlotte and Mr. Collins in Kent. Elizabeth and her hosts are invited to Rosings Park, Lady Catherine's home. Mr. Darcy and his cousin, Colonel Fitzwilliam, are also visiting. Fitzwilliam tells Elizabeth how Mr. Darcy recently saved a friend, presumably Bingley, from an undesirable match. Elizabeth realises that the prevented engagement was to Jane. Mr. Darcy proposes to Elizabeth, declaring his love for her despite her low social connections. She is shocked, as she was unaware of Mr. Darcy's interest, and rejects him angrily, saying that he is the last person she would ever marry and that she could never love a man who caused her sister such unhappiness; she further accuses him of treating Wickham unjustly. Mr. Darcy brags about his success in separating Bingley and Jane and sarcastically dismisses the accusation regarding Wickham without addressing it. The next day, Mr. Darcy gives Elizabeth a letter explaining that Wickham, the son of his late father's steward, had refused the parish \"living\" Mr Darcy's father had intended for him, and was instead given money to pursue a career in the law. Wickham had quickly squandered the money and then tried to elope with Darcy's 15-year-old sister, Georgiana, for her considerable dowry. Mr. Darcy also writes that he separated Jane and Bingley because he believed her to be indifferent to Bingley and because of the lack of propriety displayed by her family. While still believing Mr Darcy having been mistaken about Jane, Elizabeth realises from his letter how much he has had to be on guard against marital adventurers; and is ashamed by her mother's predatory behaviour and her own prejudice.\nMonths later, Elizabeth accompanies the Gardiners on a tour of Derbyshire. They persuade Elizabeth to visit Pemberley, Darcy's estate there, noting that he is unlikely to be at home. When Mr. Darcy returns unexpectedly, he is exceedingly gracious with Elizabeth and the Gardiners. Elizabeth is surprised by Darcy's behaviour and grows fond of him, even coming to regret rejecting his proposal. In Derbyshire she receives news that her sister Lydia has run off with Wickham. She tells Mr. Darcy; both depart in haste. The errant couple are eventually tracked down in London. After an agonising interim, Wickham agrees to marry Lydia; all assume that Mr Gardiner has paid-off Wickham; and Mr Bennet is deeply troubled at how this debt may be repaid. But when Lydia and Wickham, now married, visit the Bennet family at Longbourn; Lydia accidentally lets slip to Jane and Elizabeth that Mr. Darcy was at her wedding. Jane assures Lydia that they will not probe her further; but Elizabeth, seized with suppositions, writes to Aunt Gardiner for further information. Although Mr. Darcy, seeking to avoid placing Mr Bennet and Elizabeth under further obligations, had sworn everyone involved to secrecy, Mrs. Gardiner now feels obliged to inform Elizabeth in a confidential letter that he had secured the match at great expense and trouble to himself. Mrs Gardiner concludes this letter by observing that Mr Darcy is clearly in need of a wife, and supposes that Elizabeth is the object of his 'sly' intentions. She indirectly implies that Elizabeth herself may already be aware of this.\nMr. Bingley and Mr. Darcy return to Netherfield. Jane accepts Mr. Bingley's proposal. A week later, Lady Catherine, having heard from a confidential letter that Mr Collins has nevertheless shared with her, that Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy may intend to marry; visits Elizabeth and demands she promise never to accept Mr. Darcy's proposal, as she and Darcy's late mother had already planned his marriage to her daughter Anne. While admitting that she and Mr Darcy were not engaged, Elizabeth insistently refuses to offer any assurance that they would never do so. Outraged Lady Catherine storms off, pointedly refusing to proffer the conventional civilities, to confront Mr Darcy with the same demands she had made of Elizabeth. Darcy similarly refuses to comply, and heartened at his aunt's indignant relaying of Elizabeth's response, returns with Bingley to Longbourn. When Elizabeth reveals that she had already known of his part in Lydia's marriage, and offers him her thanks, Darcy realises that this may not present the bar to their engagement that he had feared. He again proposes marriage and is accepted. That evening, Darcy seeks the proper approval of Mr Bennet; and receives it, though Mr Bennet needs extensive persuading from Elizabeth that this truly is her wish. He eventually gives his blessing, at which Elizabeth lets him into the secret of what Darcy had done for Lydia. Which ostensibly takes the burden from Mr Bennet's shoulders. He may now immediately make an offer to repay the debt in full, safe in the confidence that it will be refused. But family honour will be restored.\nMajor themes.\nMany critics take the title as the start when analysing the themes of \"Pride and Prejudice\" but Robert Fox cautions against reading too much into the title (which was initially \"First Impressions\"), because commercial factors may have played a role in its selection. \"After the success of \"Sense and Sensibility\", nothing would have seemed more natural than to bring out another novel of the same author using again the formula of antithesis and alliteration for the title.\"\nThe qualities of the title are not exclusively assigned to one or the other of the protagonists; both Elizabeth and Darcy display pride and prejudice.\" The phrase \"pride and prejudice\" had been used over the preceding two centuries by Joseph Hall, Jeremy Taylor, Joseph Addison and Samuel Johnson. Austen is thought to have taken her title from a passage in Fanny Burney's \"Cecilia\" (1782), a novel she is known to have admired:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nA theme in much of Austen's work is the importance of environment and upbringing in developing young people's character and morality. Social standing and wealth are not necessarily advantages in her works, and a further theme common to Austen's work is ineffectual parents. In \"Pride and Prejudice\", the failure of Mr. and Mrs. Bennet as parents is blamed for Lydia's lack of moral judgment. Darcy has been taught to be principled and scrupulously honourable but he is also proud and overbearing. Kitty, rescued from Lydia's bad influence and spending more time with her older sisters after they marry, is said to improve greatly in their superior society.\nThe American novelist Anna Quindlen observed in an introduction to an edition of Austen's novel in 1995:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"Pride and Prejudice\" is also about that thing that all great novels consider, the search for self. And it is the first great novel that teaches us this search is as surely undertaken in the drawing room making small talk as in the pursuit of a great white whale or the public punishment of adultery.\nMarriage and the Family Name.\nThe opening line of the novel announces: \"It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife.\" This sets marriage as a motif and a central idea in the novel. Readers are poised to question whether or not these single men need a wife, and what for; or if the need is dictated by the \"neighbourhood\" families and their daughters who require a \"good fortune\". According to American Book Review the opening line of Pride and Prejudice is considered second on their list of top 100 greatest opening lines in English literature after \"Moby Dick\"'s \"Call me Ishmael\".\nMarriage is a complex social activity that takes political, social and financial economy into account. In the case of Charlotte Lucas, the seeming success of her marriage to Mr Collins lies in the comfortable financial circumstances of their household rather than in mutual respect or companionship; while the relationship between Mr. and Mrs. Bennet serves to illustrate bad marriages based on an impulsive attraction and surface over substance (economic, social and psychological). The Bennet's marriage turns out to be deeply disfunctional in failing to meet one of a propertied family's most basic requirements; that of providing their daughters with marriage settlements appropriate for a gentleman's children. This increasingly humiliates Mr Bennet in the course of the book; made worse by Mrs Bennet's blithe unconcern at relying other families' money instead - and her total disregard of any requirement for these obligations to be repaid. As is conventional in a romantic novel, the eventual marriages of Jane and Elizabeth as main protagonists are presented as happy-ever-after. But otherwise marriages in Austen's fiction are realistic and compromised; if anything, the \"sad omens\" for the Bennet's marriage are now worse.\nThe Bennets' failing marriage is an example that the youngest Bennet, Lydia, re-enacts with Wickham and the results are far from felicitous. Indeed the married Lydia rapidly adopts her mother's mercenary attitudes. Although the central characters, Elizabeth and Darcy, begin the novel as hostile acquaintances and unlikely friends, they eventually work toward a better understanding of themselves and each other, which frees them to truly fall in love. But only once they have both painfully confronted a complex of economic obligations and dependancies around one another, that they have been precipitated into by their families' circumstances. From the outset both have determined to marry only on their own terms, recognising that this may be contrary to the wishes of their parents; but both also remain bound within their families and must be ready to trust these family concerns openly with one another. This does not eliminate the challenges of the real differences in their technically equivalent social status as gentry and their female relations. It does however provide them with a better understanding of each other's point of view from the different ends of the rather wide scale of differences within that category.\nWhen Elizabeth rejects Darcy's first proposal, the argument of marrying for love is introduced. Elizabeth accepts Darcy's proposal only when she is certain she loves him and her feelings are reciprocated. Austen's complex sketching of different marriages ultimately allows readers to question what forms of alliance are desirable especially when it comes to privileging economic, sexual, or companionate attraction.\nIt is a common assumption of all parties in the novel, that the primary necessity for the marriage of a man of good fortune, is to maintain and perpetuate his family name through his offspring. And equally, that one necessity for the marriage of a woman of property is to maintain that property for her offspring in her new family name. Although both Elizabeth and Darcy have already determined to marry for love; both recognise that they also have obligations in marriage to their respective family names and landed estates. Elizabeth is determined that she will marry a 'gentleman', knowing that her marriage otherwise would sully the Bennet family name, and potentially constrain the inheritance of her future offspring; Darcy already feels committed to contracting a marriage to provide an heir and mistress for the Pemberley estate, and to continue the Darcy family name. Counterpart pressures; to maintain ancient family names and to preserve landed estates in that name through male inheritance, are operating everywhere across England amongst the social circles in which the novel takes place. Everywhere too, these social pressures are having to be balanced against an increasing recognition of individual aspirations in marriage; to enable heirs to choose to companionable partners, to provide for the futures of daughters and younger sons and enable these to marry in their turn, to allow younger sons to be educated and to embark on careers of 'gentlemanlike' quality, and to provide for widows and unmarried daughters.\nThe novel is concerned with the marital prospects of the heirs of three historic landed estates; Longbourn, represented by five daughters; Pemberley, represented by a son and daughter; and Rosings Park represented by a single (and no longer young) daughter. Only one of these appears assured of male succession in the family name. This prospect of the failure of male succession had become a common theme across rural England in the 18th century, arising in almost all family estates at one time or another; and in response to this, landowners and their lawyers had developed legal instruments - entail and strict settlement - to balance the consequential conflicts of interest. To be sufficiently confident of producing a son to maintain an estate in the family name, it was better if an heir did not need to wait for their father's death before marrying; but there must then be provision for an assured and substantial income from the estate to that heir during their father's life to be committed in a legal marriage settlement. In order to ensure that inheritance of the estate could be maintained in the family, even were a future heir to produce no sons, there must be provision for portions from the estate to be paid for current younger sons' educations and marriages into 'gentlemanlike' careers in the Army, Church and Law, so that these sons might raise gentlemanly cousins within the family who might if needed, continue succession of the estate in the family name. In order to ensure that daughters from the family could marry gentlemen, they must be provided with settled dowries from the estate to commit to their legal marriage settlement. Provisions in all these forms would commonly be expected to be spelled out in the strict settlement that each heir would enter into on coming of age. Technically, the entail was a trust, so that the entailed estate would be held by trustees (commonly the family's lawyers) to the benefit of the 'tenant in tail', the heir's unborn eldest son. The heir would now be a 'tenant for life' in receipt of an annual allowance. Once the heir's father died, his son would become 'tenant in possession' with full access to the income from the estate, but unable to sell or mortgage any part of it. Payments due under the settlement - such as settled dowries - would be made by the trustees; though in the case of Longbourn it appears that no provision had been made in Mr Bennet's strict settlement for daughters' dowries, Mrs Bennet's own dowry of \u00a35,000 being settled for this purpose instead. Mrs Bennet rails repeatedly at the unfairness of the Longbourn entail; unable to realise, though her older daughters do, that it was only through that entail that she and Mr Bennet could have married as young as they did.\nOf the other two landed estates that figure in the novel, Rosings Park and Pemberley, the reader is to understand that Pemberley is also entailed with a strict settlement, as Georgiana Darcy is stated as being provided with a settled dowry of \u00a330,000 from it. In respect of Rosings, Lady Catherine states that it is not entailed away from the female line; \"it was not thought necessary in Sir Lewis de Bourgh's family\"; though this statement prompts the likelihood that the Rosings estate nevertheless is entailed by strict settlement in the de Bourgh family to the direct descendants of an ancient forbear, though not specifying 'male' or 'female'. Anne de Bourgh is identified by Mr Collins as \"the heiress of Rosings\"; so indicating a female inheritance that has already happened. Consequently, if the estate is entailed, then it may be inferred that the current 'tenant in possession' and owner of the Rosings estate, is Lady Anne de Bourgh; and that Anne's yet unborn heir would 'tenant in tail'. This would explain why it would be necessary for Mr Darcy and Lady Anne to marry if the two ancient estates are to be united in their children. But in any case, assuming Mr Collins is correct, Lady Catherine cannot be the current owner of Rosings. Under all the bluster of Lady Catherine's outburst to Elizabeth in the garden at Longbourn, the reality is that Lady Catherine has been scheming to detach Rosings Park from a branch of the ancient de Bourgh family, and convey it into a branch of the Darcy family. Which is precisely the sort of dynastic larceny by marriage that the legal institutions of marriage in the English landed gentry in this period sought to forestall.\nIf entail and strict settlement tended only to be undertaken in respect of larger landed estates; dowries and associated marriage settlements, in the levels of English society represented in the novel, were effectively universal. Amy Erickson has demonstrated that in more than 10% of marriages, as found in probate accounts for married men of all classes, some sort of marriage settlement sum is referenced which is bound to be repaid to the widow by the executors of the husband's will. Even humble marriages might well be covered by a simple bond for repayment, around a quarter were for less than \u00a313. But in the families with any degree of land or property; dowries for daughters were expected to be considerably larger - \u00a3500 and upwards - and would commonly be incorporated into a formal marriage settlement applying the legal principle of 'separate estate'. The Dowry sum would not be paid directly to the couple (as by the Common Law doctrine of 'coverture' it would have then become the outright property of the husband), instead it was held by trustees in trust for the future children of the marriage. The marriage settlement would specify payments from this settled fund out of its income without drawing on the capital, typically including, 'pin money', annual payments to the wife during the marriage of money to be spent at her own discretion on non-essentials and clothing; and 'jointure', eventual annual payments to support the living costs of the wife as an unmarried widow. Once both the married couple had died, the capital fund would be shared out to any surviving offspring in proportions to be determined; commonly by the wife's will. Income from the fund during the marriage after payment of 'pin money' might be allowed to be available from her to the husband (with the approval of the trustees); but he could not touch the capital - most usually held in interest-bearing securities. Should the wife inherit further money during the marriage, the testator - for instance her own parents - could specify that inheritance as being into the 'separate estate', rather than to the couple directly. By securing substantial dowries and inheritances through marriage settlements as 'separate estates' the fathers of marriageable daughters sought to ensure that they continued to be able to maintain themselves and their children in presentable attire for polite company, even were their husband to turn out as irresponsible with his own money; that the daughter would be assured of a sustainable living in widowhood; and that eventually the settled property would pass to her offspring.\nUnmarried girls in these levels of society were commonly already known as having been provided by their family with a particular value of dowry in 'separate estate'; and it is a tacit rebuke to Mr and Mrs Bennet that they have failed properly to do so. Mrs Bennet blames the entail, but the real cause is their own improvidence over the years. It was not uncommon for the groom's family, before the marriage, to increase the bride's separate estate and pin money; but the manner by which Mrs Bennet continues openly assuming that Darcy and Bingley will do so for her and her daughters, is vulgar, demeans the honour of the Bennet family name, and leaves Mr Bennet both angered and ashamed.\nWealth.\nWealth is a strong theme in the novel where the male characters of marrying age are usually described, first and foremost, by their annual income. For example, Mr. Bingley is introduced as a 4000 pounds-a-year person, similar to the initial mentions of Mr. Darcy and Colonel Fitzwilliam.\nMoney plays a fundamental role in the marriage market for the young ladies seeking a well-off husband and for men who wish to marry a woman of means. George Wickham tries to elope with Georgiana Darcy for her settled dowry, and Colonel Fitzwilliam states that he will marry someone with wealth.\nMarrying a woman of a rich family also ensured a linkage to a higher-class family, as is visible in the desires of Bingley's sisters to have their brother married to Georgiana Darcy. Mrs. Bennet is frequently seen encouraging her daughters to marry a wealthy man of high social class. In chapter 1, when Mr. Bingley arrives, she is \"thinking of his marrying one of them\".\nInheritance of landed wealth was by descent but could be further restricted by entailment, which in the case of the Longbourn estate restricted inheritance to male heirs only; Mr. Collins was to inherit the family estate upon Mr. Bennet's death in default of there being a son. His proposal to Elizabeth would have ensured her security; but she refuses his offer. The procedure of entail ensured that family estates of ancient creation were very rarely sold outright, typically passing instead instead to another branch of the same family where there was no male heir, or where the estate had fallen heavily in debt. Recently created estates were much more likely to come onto the market.\nInheritance laws benefited males both through entail and because, through the doctrine of coverture married women had severely constricted independent legal rights in Common Law - especially to any landed property they brought into the marriage - until the second half of the 19th century. For the upper-middle and aristocratic classes, marriage to a man with a reliable income was almost the only route to security for the woman and the children she was to have. The irony of the opening line is that generally within this society it would be a single woman without a good fortune who must be in want of a wealthy husband, to have a secure life and children. Against this however, the Common Law of England provided almost unrestricted economic freedom for those unmarried women who had nevertheless inherited substantial property - as Anne de Bourgh and Caroline Bingley have done, and Georgiana Darcy will do when she comes of age. \"English property law was distinctive in two respects: first, married women under coverture were even more restricted than in the rest of Europe; second, single women enjoyed a position unique in Europe as legal individuals in their own right, with no requirement for a male guardian\". As a 'feme sole' the legal status of an unmarried woman or widow in England did not differ from that of a man. Consequently when propertied women married, and especially when widows remarried, it was standard practice in this period for their assets to be placed in trust before the marriage in a 'separate estate' to which their husband would have no legal right of access.\nDiffering levels of wealth amongst their country gentry are observed in the three rural counties in which the action of the book takes place. Kent, the location of Hunsford and Rosings Park and an area Austen knew well in visiting her brother's estate at Godmersham Park, was favoured by prosperous families from the City of London as a county where recently wealthy men might buy a landed estate and establish themselves as gentlemen. In the novel, the style of living in these Kent households is noted as being beyond the social range of the characters from Hertfordshire. Hertfordshire in this period, similarly attracted numbers of socially aspiring men from London - as with Mr Bingley - but generally at a lesser degree of wealth and less extravagant living style. Whereas in Kent and Hertfordshire there is a considerable turnover for families buying and selling estates, this is not the case in Derbyshire - where the Darcy family have held the estate of Pemberley for generations. Similarly almost all estates around Derbyshire will have remained under the same family name throughout periods of relative affluence and austerity, although the Bingleys will eventually purchase a family estate in a neighbouring county.\nClass.\nAusten might be known now for her \"romances\" but the marriages in her novels engage with economics and class distinction. \"Pride and Prejudice\" is hardly the exception.\nWhen Darcy proposes to Elizabeth, he cites their economic and social differences as an obstacle his excessive love has had to overcome, though he still anxiously harps on the problems it poses for him within his social circle. His aunt, Lady Catherine, later characterises these differences in particularly harsh terms when she conveys what Elizabeth's marriage to Darcy will become, \"Will the shades of Pemberley be thus polluted?\" Although Elizabeth responds to Lady Catherine's accusations that hers is a potentially contaminating economic and social position (Elizabeth even insists she and Darcy, as gentleman's daughter and gentleman, are \"equals\"), Lady Catherine refuses to accept the possibility of Darcy's marriage to Elizabeth. However, as the novel closes, \"...through curiosity to see how his wife conducted herself\", Lady Catherine condescends to visit them at Pemberley.\nAs is apparent from Elizabeth's response, the key class distinction in the social world of Pride and Prejudice, is between those who are 'gentlemen' and those who are not. The main signifier of gentlemanly status in this world is the possession in the family, of inherited landed wealth. Pemberley, Rosings Park and Longbourn are all inherited estates of longstanding; so the families that possess them do have the settled status of gentlemen; whereas Lucas Lodge is not, and Sir William and his family do not. Gentlemanly status could, however, be maintained by families not in possession of an estate for those in specific occupations; chiefly the Church, the Law, and the Armed Forces. But within these professions the distinction was still evident. Officers in regular regiments of foot were gentleman, officers in the Marines were not. Incumbent beneficed clergy (prebendaries, rectors and vicars) were gentleman, perpetual and assistant curates were not. For younger sons of titled and gentry families like Colonel Fitzwilliam, the Law, Church and the Army represented alternative refuges of gentility for those without landed wealth of their own. In this, the English landed gentry were unusual in Europe; younger sons of equivalent minor nobility in France, Sweden or Italy who entered salaried professions commonly were considered to have lost noble status.\nAssociated with the distinction between who is a gentleman and who is not, is the key question of the book; which qualities are 'gentlemanlike' and which are not? Elizabeth refuses Mr Darcy's first proposal on the grounds that it is, as his behaviour towards her and her family's has consistently been, not gentlemanlike. Mr Darcy is incredulous at the charge; but eventually comes to accept the truth of it: \"Your reproof, so well applied, I shall never forget: \u2018Had you behaved in a more gentlemanlike manner.\u2019\". As historic gentlemanly status depended on retaining inherited land under the family name, so the conventional gentlemanlike qualities were seen in maintaining the dignity of that family name, the discharge of family obligations as 'debts of honour', and in deference to the wishes of one's elders and betters; qualities given formal status through the legal instruments of entailed succession and strict settlement by which both Pemberley and Longbourn are bound. But in the course of the plot, both Elizabeth and Mr Darcy come to see true gentlemanly qualities as rather being grounded in concern for the feelings of others, and in avoiding hurtful or overbearing deeds and words. Kitson Clark argues that in this, Austen prefigures changing ideals of gentlemanly qualities that underpin Victorian social and educational ethics.\nThe Bingleys present a particular problem for navigating class. Though Caroline Bingley and Mrs. Hurst behave and speak of others as if they have always belonged in the upper echelons of society, Austen makes it clear that the Bingley fortunes stem from trade. The fact that Bingley rents Netherfield Hall\u00a0\u2013 it is, after all, \"to let\"\u00a0\u2013 distinguishes him significantly from Darcy, whose estate belonged to his father's family and who through his mother is the grandson and nephew of an earl. Bingley, unlike Darcy, does not yet own an estate but has portable and growing wealth that makes him a good catch on the marriage market for poorer daughters of the gentry, like Jane Bennet, or of ambitious merchants. Class plays a central role in the evolution of the characters and Jane Austen's radical approach to class is seen as the plot unfolds.\nAn undercurrent of the old Anglo-Norman upper class is hinted at in the story, as suggested by the names of Fitzwilliam Darcy and his aunt, Lady Catherine de Bourgh; \"Fitzwilliam\", \"D'Arcy\", \"de Bourgh\" (\"Burke\"), and even \"Bennet\", are traditional Norman surnames.\nRelating to the lower classes, such characters are mostly only present through rare mentions, like asking \"the housekeeper\"; and those references exist mostly in a separate realm from the classes of the main characters, as when a discussion among the Bennet sisters pauses because someone from the staff walked in to the room to deliver a message. Main characters are, however, evaluated on the basis of how they treat those of lower classes; Mr Darcy as being fair and honorable, Lady Catherine as scolding, hectoring and overbearing.\nSelf-knowledge.\nThrough their interactions and their critiques of each other, Darcy and Elizabeth come to recognise their faults and work to correct them. Elizabeth meditates on her own mistakes thoroughly in chapter 36:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"How despicably have I acted!\" she cried; \"I, who have prided myself on my discernment! I, who have valued myself on my abilities! who have often disdained the generous candour of my sister, and gratified my vanity in useless or blameable distrust. How humiliating is this discovery! yet, how just a humiliation! Had I been in love, I could not have been more wretchedly blind. But vanity, not love, has been my folly. Pleased with the preference of one, and offended by the neglect of the other, on the very beginning of our acquaintance, I have courted prepossession and ignorance, and driven reason away, where either were concerned. Till this moment I never knew myself.\"\nOther characters rarely exhibit this depth of understanding or at least are not given the space within the novel for this sort of development.\nTanner writes that Mrs. Bennet in particular, \"has a very limited view of the requirements of that performance; lacking any introspective tendencies she is incapable of appreciating the feelings of others and is only aware of material objects\". Mrs Bennet's behaviour reflects the society in which she lives, as she knows that her daughters will not succeed if they do not get married. \"The business of her life was to get her daughters married: its solace was visiting and news.\" This shows that Mrs. Bennet is only aware of \"material objects\" and not of her feelings and emotions.\nA notable exception is Charlotte Lucas, Elizabeth Bennet's close friend and confidant. She accepts Mr. Collins's proposal of marriage once Lizzie rejects him, not out of sentiment but acute awareness of her circumstances as \"one of a large family\". Charlotte's decision is reflective of her prudent nature and awareness.\nStyle.\nFree Indirect Speech.\n\"Pride and Prejudice\", like most of Austen's works, employs the narrative technique of free indirect speech, which has been defined as \"the free representation of a character's speech, by which one means, not words actually spoken by a character, but the words that typify the character's thoughts, or the way the character would think or speak, if she thought or spoke\".\nAusten creates her characters with fully developed personalities and unique voices. Though Darcy and Elizabeth are very alike, they are also considerably different. By using narrative that adopts the tone and vocabulary of a particular character (in this case, Elizabeth), Austen invites the reader to follow events from Elizabeth's viewpoint, sharing her prejudices and misapprehensions. \"The learning curve, while undergone by both protagonists, is disclosed to us solely through Elizabeth's point of view and her free indirect speech is essential\u00a0... for it is through it that we remain caught, if not stuck, within Elizabeth's misprisions.\"\nAusten is known to use irony throughout the novel especially from viewpoint of the character of Elizabeth Bennet. She conveys the \"oppressive rules of femininity that actually dominate her life and work, and are covered by her beautifully carved trojan horse of ironic distance.\" Beginning with a historical investigation of the development of a particular literary form and then transitioning into empirical verifications, it reveals free indirect discourse as a tool that emerged over time as practical means for addressing the physical distinctness of minds. Seen in this way, free indirect discourse is a distinctly literary response to an environmental concern, providing a scientific justification that does not reduce literature to a mechanical extension of biology, but takes its value to be its own original form.\nLetters.\nOverall across the novel, around 40 letters are quoted or alluded to; such that many commentators have proposed - though without concrete textual evidence - that Austen's novels, 'Pride and Prejudice' and 'Sense and Sensibility', may both first have been drafted as epistolary novels consisting entirely of letters - as her novella Lady Susan had been.\nWhile free indirect speech builds up with the reader an identification with the current feelings and understandings of Elizabeth Bennet, at other times the reader is allowed to gain further knowledge of other characters' sentiments through the exchange of letters. This is especially the case for Darcy's letter to Elizabeth following his disastrous first proposal; as through his letter, the reader and Elizabeth are given insight into Darcy's feelings and motivations in his own voice, to a degree that he could not then have expressed to Elizabeth outright. Moreover, this letter provides Elizabeth with proofs of Wickham's true character, which leads her to question her condemnation of Darcy's treatment of him.\nLetters in the novel are several times given detailed description as physical objects; what envelopes they have, whether they have inserted sheets or are written entirely on the 'envelope' sheet, and the size and quality of the writing. In an age when physical contacts, especially between unmarried persons of opposite sex, are highly constrained by convention and civility; a letter as an artefact handled over a prolonged period by the sender, could stand as an active token of their physical presence. Elizabeth is stated to have continually re-read and re-examined Darcy's letter to her, to the degree that these re-readings constitute a substitute dialogue and interaction with Darcy by which her feelings for him are able to change (and unchange) over an extended period. \"Knowing Darcy's letter \"by heart\" primes Elizabeth to seriously contemplate knowing his heart, an experience Austen imaginatively explores in the novel's ensuing chapters.\" Austen's use of letters in the novel allows them to be developed with a 'life cycle', both a past history and a future destiny, \"The letter sets in motion the re-assessment and interior work that prepare both parties to start afresh when they cross paths in Derbyshire.\"\nThe many letters quoted and alluded to in Pride and Prejudice can be divided into two broad categories: formal letters of civility; introduction, invitation, acceptance (and excuse), thanks for hospitality, condolence and congratulation; and otherwise private, personal and business letters. Formal letters are commonly expected to be read out loud in a household; personal letters are to be read by the recipient in private; and in general are expected to be treated in confidence, though it is always understood that a letter 'belongs' to its recipient. Crucially, in the novel, characters express feelings and communicate understandings in private and personal letters, that they may be inhibited by civility from stating face-to-face; as when Aunt Gardiner writes to Elizabeth \"Will you be angry with me, my dear Lizzy) if I take this opportunity of saying (what I was never bold enough to say before) how much I like him?\". Consequently, the novel is able to juxtapose characters in situations when the reader is aware of a dislocation between the characters' feelings arising from what they know to be the case from a private letter, and the feelings they are constrained to express in civil conversational exchange. Characteristically in reporting such exchanges, Austen refrains from giving explicit expression to her character's inner feelings, leaving it to the reader to understand their undercurrent of suppressed rage; as in the conversation between Elizabeth and Wickham following her receiving a letter from Aunt Gardiner relating Wickham's recent villainies in London.\nElizabeth's letters in the resolution of the plot.\nThe bulk of the letters cited in the novel are addressed to, or read to, Elizabeth Bennet without citing her letters in response. But in the final chapters, we read an exchange of letters between Elizabeth and Aunt Gardiner; apparently providing the mechanism through which the plot is brought to conclusion. This resolution relies on there being an implicit license to express in \nprivate letters, speculations that could not in civility be said in conversation.\nBy this time it is clear to the reader that Elizabeth and Darcy have both come to regret their former mischaracterisations of one another, and are primed to recognise their love. But the circumstances of Darcy's first proposal; his crass denigration of Elizabeth's family and herself, and the absolute finality of her dismissal of him in response, still stood in the way of the desired happy ending. As do the obligations set up by Darcy's paying-off Wickham, which he had tried to keep secret. The logjam turns out to be broken in the unlikely person of Lady Catherine de Bourgh, who had received a report that the two may be about to become engaged; and then confronted first Elizabeth and then Darcy with a demand that they each undertake never to marry one another. Both in turn had refused to give any such guarantee; and in respect of Darcy \"its effect had been exactly contrariwise\" in giving him reason to hope that a renewed and contrite proposal, might be acceptable. But as John Sutherland has noted, Austen has set the reader a puzzle; who had given Lady Catherine the (premature) report of the oncoming engagement, and how? An answer appears to have been suggested to Elizabeth the day after Lady Catherine's visit, when Mr Bennet receives a letter from Mr Collins, who says that he had informed Lady Catherine of the possible engagement between Elizabeth and Darcy, intelligence which Mr Bennet concludes Mr Collins must have learned from a letter to Charlotte, which Mr Bennet assumes must gave come from one of her family, \"the good-natured, gossiping Lucases\". But Elizabeth will have known this not to be at all likely, as the information passed to Lady Catherine - and then thrown back at her - had included private circumstances of the marriage settlement of Wickham and Lydia, which the Lucases would not have known.\nA more plausible narrative may be suggested by Mia Barzilay Freund, who notes that, \"the swift cascade of events that results in her betrothal to Mr. Darcy\" had been triggered for Elizabeth through Lydia's unintended disclosure - on which she had been sworn to secrecy - that Darcy had attended her's and Wickham's wedding. Elizabeth and Jane had promised Lydia not to probe any further outright; but Elizabeth is so overcome with suppositions about what this news may portend that she sidesteps Jane's assurances in writing to Aunt Gardiner requesting further information in a letter, expressing surprise that \"a person unconnected with any of us\" should have been at the ceremony. This was being coy, and was a sly strategem as Elizabeth admits to herself on posting the letter. Aunt Gardiner, who has seen Darcy and Elizabeth together in Derbyshire, is not fooled for a moment, but nevertheless provides a very full response; \"slyness seems the fashion\" she says, noting a similar coyness had been apparent in Darcy's conversation at Gracechurch Street, whenever the subject of Elizabeth arose. So Aunt Gardiner takes this mutual coyness as an invitation to do some private probing of her own; if Elizabeth is being sly about Darcy, and Darcy is being sly about Elizabeth; may Aunt Gardiner presume in supposing that they may be in it together? Might there indeed already be an understanding that they could marry one another? Aunt Gardiner recognises that, if Elizabeth and Darcy are to marry, then any obligations of honour created through Darcy's paying-off Wickham,\nmust be open between them; whatever she had promised to Darcy.\nElizabeth does not reply immediately to Aunt Gardiner's letter, and does not know how to; not until after she is has been confronted by Wickham, who presents her with what she now knows to be gross misrepresentations of the circumstances of his marriage, then with the glad events of Jane's engagement to Bingley, then with the shocking realisation that Lady Catherine and Mr Collins have also concluded that a marriage with Darcy could be on the cards, and then with Darcy's second, and whole-hearted, proposal. So well over a week passes before Elizabeth does reply, as she says, \"I would have thanked you before, my dear aunt, as I ought to have done, for your long, kind, satisfactory detail of particulars; but, to say the truth, I was too cross to write. You supposed more than really existed. But now suppose as much as you chuse.\" As Freund notes; \"too cross to write\" would seem harsh as a response to Aunt Gardiner's playful and private 'suppositions', especially if \"Mrs. Gardiner\u2019s letter precipitates the change in circumstance that allows Elizabeth to furnish her with a favourable reply\". But Elizabeth would have known that Aunt Gardiner would likely also have been writing to Charlotte to tell the Collins's why they could not have been invited to Wickham and Lydia's wedding; and if Elizabeth - whether correctly or not - suspected that Aunt Gardiner's suppositions could have been apparent, however obliquely, in a letter to the Collins's - and so to Lady Catherine - then her short-term harshness, and crossness, would be more explicable. Nevertheless, two play at the supposition game; so arguably it is Elizabeth Bennet, if indirectly and partially, who betrays Elizabeth Bennet.\nDevelopment of the novel.\nAusten began writing the novel after staying at Goodnestone Park in Kent with her brother Edward and his wife in 1796. It was originally titled \"First Impressions\", and was written between October 1796 and August 1797. On 1 November 1797 Austen's father sent a letter to London bookseller Thomas Cadell to ask if he had any interest in seeing the manuscript, but the offer was declined by return post.\nThe Militia were mobilised after the French declaration of war on Britain in February 1793, and there was initially a lack of barracks for all the militia regiments, requiring the militia to set up huge camps in the countryside, which the novel refers to several times. The Brighton camp for which the militia regiment leaves in May after spending the winter in Meryton was opened in August 1793, and the barracks for all the regiments of the militia were completed by 1796, placing the events of the novel between 1793 and 1795.\nAusten made significant revisions to the manuscript for \"First Impressions\" between 1811 and 1812. As nothing remains of the original manuscript, study of the first drafts of the novel is reduced to conjecture. From the large number of letters in the final novel, it is assumed that \"First Impressions\" was an epistolary novel.\nShe later renamed the story \"Pride and Prejudice\" around 1811/1812, when she sold the rights to publish the manuscript to Thomas Egerton for \u00a3110 (). In renaming the novel, Austen probably had in mind the \"sufferings and oppositions\" summarised in the final chapter of Fanny Burney's \"Cecilia\", called \"Pride and Prejudice\", where the phrase appears three times in block capitals.\nIt is possible that the novel's original title was altered to avoid confusion with other works. In the years between the completion of \"First Impressions\" and its revision into \"Pride and Prejudice\", two other works had been published under that name: a novel by Margaret Holford and a comedy by Horace Smith.\nPublication history.\nAusten sold the copyright for the novel to Thomas Egerton from the Military Library, Whitehall in exchange for \u00a3110 (Austen had asked for \u00a3150). This proved a costly decision. Austen had published \"Sense and Sensibility\" on a commission basis, whereby she indemnified the publisher against any losses and received any profits, less costs and the publisher's commission. Unaware that \"Sense and Sensibility\" would sell out its edition, making her \u00a3140, she passed the copyright to Egerton for a one-off payment, meaning that all the risk (and all the profits) would be his. Jan Fergus has calculated that Egerton subsequently made around \u00a3450 from just the first two editions of the book.\nEgerton published the first edition of \"Pride and Prejudice\" in three hardcover volumes on 28 January 1813. It was advertised in \"The Morning Chronicle\", priced at 18s. Favourable reviews saw this edition sold out, with a second edition published in October that year. A third edition was published in 1817.\nForeign language translations first appeared in 1813 in French; subsequent translations were published in German, Danish, and Swedish. \"Pride and Prejudice\" was first published in the United States in August 1832 as \"Elizabeth Bennet or, Pride and Prejudice\". The novel was also included in Richard Bentley's Standard Novel series in 1833. R. W. Chapman's scholarly edition of \"Pride and Prejudice\", first published in 1923, has become the standard edition on which many modern published versions of the novel are based.\nThe novel was originally published anonymously, as were all of Austen's novels. However, whereas her first published novel, \"Sense and Sensibility\" was presented as being written \"by a Lady,\" \"Pride and Prejudice\" was attributed to \"the Author of \"Sense and Sensibility\"\". This began to consolidate a conception of Austen as an author, albeit anonymously. Her subsequent novels were similarly attributed to the anonymous author of all her then-published works.\nReception.\n19th century.\nThe novel was well received, with three favourable reviews in the first months following publication. Anne Isabella Milbanke, later to be the wife of Lord Byron, called it \"the fashionable novel\". Noted critic and reviewer George Henry Lewes declared that he \"would rather have written \"Pride and Prejudice\", or \"Tom Jones\", than any of the Waverley Novels\".\nThroughout the 19th century, not all reviews of the work were positive. Charlotte Bront\u00eb, in a letter to Lewes, wrote that \"Pride and Prejudice\" was a disappointment, \"a carefully fenced, highly cultivated garden, with neat borders and delicate flowers; but [...] no open country, no fresh air, no blue hill, no bonny beck\". Along with her, Mark Twain was overwhelmingly negative of the work. He stated, \"Everytime I read \"Pride and Prejudice\" I want to dig [Austen] up and beat her over the skull with her own shin-bone.\"\nAusten for her part thought the \"playfulness and epigrammaticism\" of \"Pride and Prejudice\" was excessive, complaining in a letter to her sister Cassandra in 1813 that the novel lacked \"shade\" and should have had a chapter \"of solemn specious nonsense, about something unconnected with the story; an essay on writing, a critique on Walter Scott or the history of Buonapart\u00e9\".\nWalter Scott wrote in his journal, \"Read again and for the third time at least, Miss Austen's very finely written novel of \"Pride and Prejudice\".\"\n20th century.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n &lt;poem&gt;\nYou could not shock her more than she shocks me,\nBeside her Joyce seems innocent as grass.\nIt makes me most uncomfortable to see\nAn English spinster of the middle class\nDescribe the amorous effects of 'brass',\nReveal so frankly and with such sobriety\nThe economic basis of society.\n&lt;/poem&gt;\nW. H. Auden (1937) on Austen\nThe American scholar Claudia L. Johnson defended the novel from the criticism that it has an unrealistic fairy-tale quality. One critic, Mary Poovey, wrote that the \"romantic conclusion\" of \"Pride and Prejudice\" is an attempt to hedge the conflict between the \"individualistic perspective inherent in the bourgeois value system \"and\" the authoritarian hierarchy retained from traditional, paternalistic society\". Johnson wrote that Austen's view of a power structure capable of reformation was not an \"escape\" from conflict. Johnson wrote the \"outrageous unconventionality\" of Elizabeth Bennet was in Austen's own time very daring, especially given the strict censorship that was imposed in Britain by the Prime Minister, William Pitt, in the 1790s when Austen wrote \"Pride and Prejudice\".\nIn the early twentieth century, the term \"Collins,\" named for Austen's William Collins, came into use as slang for a thank-you note to a host.\nAdaptations.\nFilm, television and theatre.\nNumerous screen adaptations have contributed in popularising \"Pride and Prejudice\".\nThe first television adaptation of the novel, written by Michael Barry, was produced in 1938 by the BBC. It is a lost television broadcast. Some of the notable film versions include the 1940 Academy Award-winning film, starring Greer Garson and Laurence Olivier (based in part on Helen Jerome's 1935 stage adaptation) and that of 2005, starring Keira Knightley (an Oscar-nominated performance) and Matthew Macfadyen. Television versions include two by the BBC: a 1980 version starring Elizabeth Garvie and David Rintoul and a 1995 version, starring Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth. A new television adaptation of the novel for Netflix by Dolly Alderton and Euros Lyn and starring Emma Corrin and Jack Lowden as Elizabeth and Darcy went into production in the summer of 2025.\nA stage version created by Helen Jerome premiered at the Music Box Theatre in New York in 1935, starring Adrianne Allen and Colin Keith-Johnston, and opened at the St James's Theatre in London in 1936, starring Celia Johnson and Hugh Williams. \"Elizabeth Refuses\" a play by Margaret Macnamara of scenes from the novel was made into a TV programme by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation in 1957. \"First Impressions\" was a 1959 Broadway musical version starring Polly Bergen, Farley Granger, and Hermione Gingold. In 1995, a musical concept album was written by Bernard J. Taylor, with Claire Moore in the role of Elizabeth Bennet and Peter Karrie in the role of Mr Darcy. A new stage production, \"Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice, The New Musical\", was presented in concert on 21 October 2008 in Rochester, New York, with Colin Donnell as Darcy. The Swedish composer Daniel Nelson based his 2011 opera \"Stolthet och f\u00f6rdom\" on \"Pride and Prejudice\". Works inspired by the book include \"Bride and Prejudice\" and \"Trishna\" (1985 Hindi TV series).\n\"The Lizzie Bennet Diaries\" \u2013 which premiered on a dedicated YouTube channel on 9 April 2012, and concluded on 28 March 2013 \u2013 is an Emmy award-winning web-series which recounts the story via vlogs recorded primarily by the Bennet sisters. It was created by Hank Green and Bernie Su.\nIn 2017, the bicentenary year of Austen's death, \"Pride and Prejudice \u2013 An adaptation in Words and Music\" to music by Carl Davis from the 1995 film and text by Gill Hornby was performed in the UK, with Hayley Mills as the narrator This adaptation was presented in 2024 at the Sydney Opera House and the Arts Centre Melbourne, narrated by Nadine Garner.\nIn 2018, part of the storyline of the Brazilian soap opera \"Orgulho e Paix\u00e3o\", aired on TV Globo, was inspired by the book. The soap opera was also inspired by other works of Jane Austen. It features actors, Nathalia Dill, Thiago Lacerda, Agatha Moreira, Rodrigo Simas, Gabriela Duarte, Marcelo Faria, Alessandra Negrini, and Nat\u00e1lia do Vale.\n\"Fire Island\" is a movie written by Joel Kim Booster that reimagines \"Pride and Prejudice\" as a gay drama set on the quintessential gay vacation destination of Fire Island. Booster describes the movie \"as an unapologetic and modern twist on Jane Austen's \"Pride and Prejudice\".\" The movie was released in June 2022 and features a main cast of Asian-American actors.\nLiterature.\nIn Gwyn Cready's comedic romance novel, \"Seducing Mr Darcy\", the heroine lands in \"Pride and Prejudice\" by way of magic massage, has a fling with Darcy and unknowingly changes the rest of the story.\nAbigail Reynolds is the author of seven Regency-set variations on \"Pride and Prejudice\". Her Pemberley Variations series includes \"Mr Darcy's Obsession\", \"To Conquer Mr Darcy\", \"What Would Mr Darcy Do\" and \"Mr Fitzwilliam Darcy: The Last Man in the World\". Her modern adaptation, \"The Man Who Loved Pride and Prejudice\", is set on Cape Cod.\nBella Breen is the author of nine variations on \"Pride and Prejudice\". \"Pride and Prejudice and Poison\", \"Four Months to Wed\", \"Forced to Marry\" and \"The Rescue of Elizabeth Bennet\".\nIn March 2009, Seth Grahame-Smith's \"Pride and Prejudice and Zombies\" takes Austen's work and mashes it up with zombie hordes, cannibalism, ninja and ultraviolent mayhem. In March 2010, Quirk Books published a prequel by Steve Hockensmith that deals with Elizabeth Bennet's early days as a zombie hunter, \"\". The 2016 film of Grahame-Smith's adaptation was released starring Lily James, Sam Riley and Matt Smith.\nMarvel has also published their take on this classic by releasing a short comic series of five issues that stays true to the original storyline. The first issue was published on 1 April 2009 and was written by Nancy Hajeski. It was published as a graphic novel in 2010 with artwork by Hugo Petrus.\nPamela Aidan is the author of a trilogy of books telling the story of \"Pride and Prejudice\" from Mr Darcy's point of view: \"Fitzwilliam Darcy, Gentleman\". The books are \"An Assembly Such as This\", \"Duty and Desire\" and \"These Three Remain\".\nDetective novel author P. D. James has written a book titled \"Death Comes to Pemberley\", which is a murder mystery set six years after Elizabeth and Darcy's marriage.\nSandra Lerner's sequel to \"Pride and Prejudice\", \"Second Impressions\", develops the story and imagined what might have happened to the original novel's characters. It is written in the style of Austen after extensive research into the period and language and published in 2011 under the pen name of Ava Farmer.\nJo Baker's bestselling 2013 novel \"Longbourn\" imagines the lives of the servants of \"Pride and Prejudice\". A cinematic adaptation of \"Longbourn\" was due to start filming in late 2018, directed by Sharon Maguire, who also directed \"Bridget Jones's Diary\" and \"Bridget Jones's Baby\", screenplay by Jessica Swale, produced by Random House Films and StudioCanal. The novel was also adapted for radio, appearing on BBC Radio 4's \"Book at Bedtime\", abridged by Sara Davies and read by Sophie Thompson. It was first broadcast in May 2014; and again on Radio 4 Extra in September 2018.\nIn the novel \"Eligible\", Curtis Sittenfeld sets the characters of \"Pride and Prejudice\" in modern-day Cincinnati, where the Bennet parents, erstwhile Cincinnati social climbers, have fallen on hard times. Elizabeth, a successful and independent New York journalist, and her single older sister Jane must intervene to salvage the family's financial situation and get their unemployed adult sisters to move out of the house and onward in life. In the process they encounter Chip Bingley, a young doctor and reluctant reality TV celebrity, and his medical school classmate, Fitzwilliam Darcy, a cynical neurosurgeon.\n\"Pride and Prejudice\" has also inspired works of scientific writing. In 2010, scientists named a pheromone identified in male mouse urine \"darcin\", after Mr Darcy, because it strongly attracted females. In 2016, a scientific paper published in the \"Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease\" speculated that Mrs Bennet may have been a carrier of a rare genetic disease, explaining why the Bennets didn't have any sons, and why some of the Bennet sisters are so silly.\nIn summer 2014, Udon Entertainment's Manga Classics line published a manga adaptation of \"Pride and Prejudice\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is commonly called the Houses of Parliament after the House of Commons and the House of Lords, the two legislative chambers which occupy the building. The palace is one of the centres of political life in the United Kingdom; \"Westminster\" has become a metonym for the UK Parliament and the British Government, and the Westminster system of government commemorates the name of the palace. The Elizabeth Tower of the palace, nicknamed Big Ben, is a landmark of London and the United Kingdom in general. The palace has been a Grade I listed building since 1970 and part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1987.\nThe building was originally constructed in the eleventh century as a royal palace and was the primary residence of the kings of England until 1512, when a fire destroyed the royal apartments. The monarch moved to the adjacent Palace of Whitehall, but the remainder of the palace continued to serve as the home of the Parliament of England, which had met there since the 13th\u00a0century. In 1834 a second, larger fire destroyed the majority of the palace, but the twelfth century Westminster Hall was saved and incorporated into the replacement building.\nThe competition to design the new palace was won by the architect Charles Barry, who chose a Gothic Revival style for the building. Construction started in 1840 and lasted for 30 years, suffering delays, cost overruns, and the deaths of Barry and his assistant, Augustus Pugin. This new palace became globally famous for its ornate decoration, and contributed to the proliferation of Gothic Revival architecture around the world. The palace contains chambers for the House of Commons, House of Lords, and the monarch, and has a floor area of . Extensive repairs had to be made after the Second World War, including rebuilding the destroyed Commons chamber. Despite further conservation work having been carried out since, the palace is in urgent need of major repairs.\nHistory.\nOld Palace.\nThe site of the current palace and Houses of Parliament may have been used by Cnut during his reign from 1016 to 1035, and from c.\u20091045\u00a0\u2013 c.\u20091050 Edward the Confessor built a palace and the first Westminster Abbey. The oldest surviving part of the palace is Westminster Hall, which dates from the reign of William II (r.\u20091087\u00a0\u2013\u00a01100). The palace was the principal residence of the English monarchs in the late Medieval period. In 1512, during the early reign of Henry VIII, a fire destroyed the royal apartments of the palace. In 1534 Henry moved to the neighbouring Palace of Whitehall, formerly York Place, which he had seized from Cardinal Thomas Wolsey. Although Westminster remained a royal palace, from this point on its primary occupants were the two houses of Parliament and various courts of law.\nThe predecessor of Parliament, the Curia Regis, met in Westminster Hall when the king was in residence. The \"Model Parliament\", considered the first Parliament of England, met at the palace in 1295; while medieval parliaments of England met in a variety of locations, the palace was frequently used and developed into the body's permanent home. The palace did not have purpose-built chambers for the House of Commons or the House of Lords; instead, it used the available large gathering spaces built for the palace. In time, the Commons adapted St Stephen's Chapel for its use in the sixteenth century, and the Lords used the Painted Chamber and, from 1801, the White Chamber. \nThe palace underwent significant alterations from the 18th century onwards, as Parliament struggled to carry out its business in the limited available space. These included a new storage and committee rooms by John Vardy, completed in 1770; a new official residence for the Speaker of the House of Commons, completed in 1795; and significant alterations and a new building by James Wyatt, completed in 1801. The last alterations were undertaken by Sir John Soane between 1824 and 1827. They included new library facilities for both Houses of Parliament and new law courts for the Chancery and King's Bench.\nFire and reconstruction.\nOn 16 October 1834, a fire broke out in the palace after an overheated stove used to destroy the Exchequer's stockpile of tally sticks set fire to the House of Lords Chamber. Both Houses of Parliament were destroyed, along with most of the other buildings in the palace complex. Westminster Hall was saved thanks to firefighting efforts and a change in the direction of the wind. The Jewel Tower and the undercroft, cloisters, and chapter house of St Stephen's Chapel were the only other parts of the palace to survive.\nWilliam IV offered the almost-completed Buckingham Palace to Parliament, hoping to dispose of a residence he disliked; however, the building was considered unsuitable for parliamentary use and the gift was rejected. The Painted Chamber and White Chamber were hastily repaired for temporary use, and in 1835, following that year's General Election, the King permitted Parliament to make \"plans for [its] permanent accommodation\". Each house created a committee and a Perpendicular Gothic Revival design by the architect Charles Barry was chosen. Barry was inexperienced with Gothic and relied heavily on Augustus Pugin to design details. The Lords Chamber was completed in 1847, and the Commons Chamber in 1852. Although most of the work had been carried out by 1860, construction was not finished until a decade afterwards.\nSecond World War damage and restoration.\n During the Second World War, the palace was hit by bombs on fourteen separate occasions. A bomb that fell on 26 September 1940 lifted the statue of Richard the Lionheart from its pedestal and bent its sword, an image that was used as a symbol of the strength of democracy, \"which would bend but not break under attack\".\nThe worst raid took place in the night of 10\u201311 May 1941, when the palace took at least twelve hits and three people (two policemen and Resident Superintendent of the House of Lords, Edward Elliott) were killed. The Commons Chamber and the roof of Westminster Hall were both set alight; as the firefighters could not save both, the hall was prioritised and saved, while the chamber was destroyed. The Lords Chamber and Clock Tower were damaged in the same raid. The Commons Chamber was rebuilt in a simplified style after the war, being completed in 1950.\nRecent history.\nAs the need for office space in the palace increased, Parliament acquired office space in the nearby Norman Shaw Building in 1975 and in the custom-built Portcullis House, completed in 2000. This increase has enabled all Members of Parliament (MP) to have their own office facilities.\nThe palace was designated a Grade I listed building in 1970 and a World Heritage Site in 1987. The fabric of the building is in urgent need of restoration. In January 2018, the House of Commons voted for both houses to vacate the palace to allow for a complete refurbishment of the building, which will take at least six years and start no sooner than 2025. In September 2022, the Restoration and Renewal Client Board, a joint committee of the House of Lords and the House of Commons, was formed to oversee the necessary works.\nExterior.\nCharles Barry's collaborative design for the Palace of Westminster uses the Perpendicular Gothic style, which was popular during the 15th century and returned during the Gothic revival of the 19th century. Barry was a classical architect, but he was aided by the Gothic architect Augustus Pugin. Westminster Hall, which was built in the 11th century and survived the fire of 1834, was incorporated in Barry's design. Pugin was displeased with the result of the work, especially with the symmetrical layout designed by Barry; he famously remarked, \"All Grecian, sir; Tudor details on a classic body\".\nStonework.\nIn 1839 Charles Barry toured Britain, looking at quarries and buildings, with a committee which included two leading geologists and a stonecarver. They selected Anston, a sand-coloured magnesian limestone quarried in the villages of Anston, South Yorkshire, and Mansfield Woodhouse, Nottinghamshire. Two quarries were chosen from a list of 102, with the majority of the stone coming from the former. A crucial consideration was transport, achieved on water via the Chesterfield Canal, the North Sea and the rivers Trent and Thames. Furthermore, Anston was cheaper, and \"could be supplied in blocks up to four feet thick and lent itself to elaborate carving\".\nBarry's new Palace of Westminster was rebuilt using the sandy-coloured Anston limestone. However, the stone soon began to decay owing to pollution and the poor quality of some of the stone used. Although such defects were clear as early as 1849, nothing was done for the remainder of the 19th century, even after much studying. During the 1910s, however, it became clear that some of the stonework had to be replaced. In 1928, it was deemed necessary to use Clipsham stone, a honey-coloured limestone from Rutland, to replace the decayed Anston. The project began in the 1930s but was halted by the outbreak of the Second World War and was completed only during the 1950s. By the 1960s, pollution had again begun to take its toll. A stone conservation and restoration programme to the external elevations and towers began in 1981 and ended in 1994.\nTowers.\nVictoria Tower.\nThe Palace of Westminster has three main towers. The largest and tallest is the Victoria Tower, which occupies the south-western corner of the palace. The tower was an integral part of Barry's original design, and he intended it to be the most memorable element, conceiving it as the keep of a legislative \"castle\". The tower was redesigned several times, and its height increased progressively; upon its completion in 1858 it was the tallest secular building in the world.\nAt the base of the tower is the Sovereign's Entrance, used by the monarch whenever entering the palace to open Parliament or for other state occasions. The high archway is richly decorated with sculptures, including statues of Saints George, Andrew and Patrick, and Queen Victoria. The main body of the tower houses the Parliamentary Archives in of steel shelves spread over 12 floors. The archives include the master copies of all Acts of Parliament since 1497 and important manuscripts such as the original Bill of Rights and the death warrant of King Charles\u00a0I. At the top of the cast-iron pyramidal roof is a flagstaff, from which flies the Royal Standard (the monarch's personal flag) when the Sovereign is present in the palace. On all other days, the Union Flag flies from the mast.\nBig Ben (Elizabeth Tower).\nAt the north end of the palace is the Elizabeth Tower, commonly known by the nickname \"Big Ben\". At it is only slightly shorter than the Victoria Tower, but much slimmer. It was called the Clock Tower until 2012, when it was renamed to celebrate the Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II. The Clock Tower was designed by Augustus Pugin and built after his death. Charles Barry asked Pugin to design the clock tower because Pugin had previously helped Barry design the palace.\nThe tower houses the Great Clock, which uses the original mechanism built by Edward John Dent to designs by amateur horologist Edmund Beckett Denison. It is highly accurate by nineteenth-century standards, striking the hour to within a second of the time, and remaining reliable since it entered service in 1859. The time is shown on four dials in diameter, which are made of milk glass and are lit from behind at night; the hour hand is long and the minute hand . \nFive bells hang in the belfry above the clock. The four quarter bells strike the Westminster Chimes every quarter-hour. The largest bell strikes the hours; officially called the \"Great Bell\", it is generally referred to as Big Ben, a nickname of uncertain origins which, over time, has been applied to the whole tower. The original hour bell cracked during testing and was recast; the present bell later developed a crack of its own, which gives it a distinctive sound. It is the third-heaviest bell in Britain, weighing 13.8 tonnes. In the lantern at the top of Elizabeth Tower is the Ayrton Light, which is lit when either House of Parliament is sitting after dark. It was installed in 1885 at the request of Queen Victoria, so that she could see from Buckingham Palace whether the members were \"at work\", and named after Acton Smee Ayrton, who was First Commissioner of Works in the 1870s.\nCentral Tower.\nThe shortest of the palace's three principal towers (at ), the octagonal Central Tower stands over the middle of the building, immediately above the Central Lobby. It was added to the plans on the insistence of Dr. David Boswell Reid, who was in charge of the ventilation of the new Houses of Parliament: his plan called for a central chimney through which what he called \"vitiated air\" would be drawn out of the building with the heat and smoke of about four hundred fires around the palace. To accommodate the tower, Barry was forced to lower the high ceiling he had planned for the Central Lobby and reduce the height of its windows; however, the tower proved to be an opportunity to improve the palace's exterior design, and Barry to make it a spire to balance the effect of the more massive lateral towers. The Central Tower completely failed to fulfil its stated purpose. Still, it remains notable as \"the first occasion when mechanical services had a real influence on architectural design,\" withstanding certain climate-specific architectural elements such as windcatchers.\nSmaller towers.\nSome other features of the palace of Westminster are known as towers. St Stephen's Tower is positioned in the middle of the west front of the palace, between Westminster Hall and Old Palace Yard, and houses the public entrance to the palace. The pavilions at the northern and southern ends of the river front are called Speaker's Tower and Chancellor's Tower respectively, after the presiding officers of the two Houses at the time of the palace's reconstruction\u2014the Speaker of the House of Commons and the Lord Chancellor. Speaker's Tower contains Speaker's House, the official residence of the Speaker of the Commons.\nAs well as the pinnacles which rise from between the window bays along the fronts of the palace, numerous turrets enliven the building's skyline. Like the Central Tower, these were built for practical reasons, as they mask ventilation shafts.\nGrounds.\nThere are several small gardens surrounding the Palace of Westminster. Victoria Tower Gardens is open as a public park along the side of the river south of the palace. Black Rod's Garden (named after the office of Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod) is closed to the public and is used as a private entrance. Old Palace Yard, in front of the palace, is paved over and covered in concrete security blocks (\"see security below\"). Cromwell Green (also on the frontage, and in 2006 enclosed by hoardings for the construction of a new visitor centre), New Palace Yard (on the north side), and Speaker's Green (directly north of the palace) are all private and closed to the public. College Green, located opposite the House of Lords, is a small triangular green that is commonly used for television interviews with politicians.\nInterior.\nThe Palace of Westminster contains over 1,100 rooms, 100 staircases and of passageways, which are spread over four floors. Offices, dining rooms and bars occupy the ground floor; the first, or principal, floor houses the main rooms of the palace, including the debating chambers, the lobbies and the libraries. The top two floors are used as committee rooms and offices.\nSome of the interiors were designed and painted by J. G. Crace, working in collaboration with Pugin and others. For example, Crace decorated and gilded the ceiling of the Chapel of St. Mary Undercroft.\nLayout.\nThe palace is a roughly rectangular building with its long axis parallel to the River Thames. The building is planned around the Central Lobby, a large hall from which corridors lead north to the Commons Chamber, south to the Lords Chamber, and west to the public entrance and Westminster Hall; to the east are committee rooms and libraries. A suite of rooms known as the Royal Apartments is at the disposal of the reigning monarch; they lie beyond the Lords' Chamber at the far south of the palace.\nThe palace has separate entrances for its different users: the monarch, members of the House of Lords, members of Parliament and the public. The Sovereign's Entrance is at the base of the Victoria Tower in the south-west corner of the palace, and leads directly to the Royal Apartments. Members of the House of Lords use the Peers' Entrance in the middle of the Old Palace Yard fa\u00e7ade, which opens to an entrance hall. A staircase from there leads, through a corridor and the Prince's Chamber, to the Lords Chamber. Members of Parliament enter their part of the building from the Members' Entrance on the south side of New Palace Yard. Their route passes through a cloakroom in the lower level of the Cloisters and eventually reaches the Members' Lobby directly south of the Commons Chamber. St Stephen's Entrance, in the approximate centre of the building's western front, is the public entrance. From it, visitors walk through a flight of stairs to St Stephen's Hall, which houses a collection of marble statues of prominent parliamentarians, and then to the Central Lobby.\nRoyal Apartments.\nNorman Porch.\nThe Sovereign's Entrance is beneath the Victoria Tower. It was designed for the use of the monarch, and is used by them during the State Opening of Parliament. The Sovereign's Entrance is also the formal entrance used by visiting dignitaries, as well as the starting point of public tours of the palace.\nFrom the entrance, a staircase leads up to the principal floor in a broad, unbroken flight of 26 steps made of grey granite. At the top is the Norman Porch, a square landing with a central clustered column and a ceiling of four groin vaults with lierne ribs and carved bosses. The porch was named for its proposed decorative scheme, which was never completed but would have consisted of statues of the Norman kings and frescoes depicting Norman history. As completed, the porch contains stained glass windows depicting Edward the Confessor and a young Queen Victoria, a copy of a 1900 painting of Victoria by Jean-Joseph Benjamin-Constant, and busts of prime ministers who have sat in the House of Lords on the plinths intended for the statues. A double door opposite the stairs leads to the Royal Gallery, and another to the right opens to the Robing Room.\nRobing Room.\nThe Robing Room lies at the southern end of the palace's north-south axis, and occupies the centre of the south front, overlooking Victoria Tower Gardens. It is where the Sovereign prepares for the State Opening of Parliament by changing into their official robes and putting on the Imperial State Crown. The focus of the room is the chair of state, which sits on a dais of three steps under a canopy adorned with the arms and floral emblems of England, Scotland and Ireland. A panel of purple velvet forms the backdrop to the chair, embroidered by the Royal School of Needlework with the royal arms, surrounded by stars and \"VR\" monograms. Edward Barry designed both the chair\u2014the cushion and back of which are also embroidered\u2014and the ornate marble fireplace across the room, which features gilded statuettes of Saint George and Saint Michael.\nThe decorative theme of the room is the legend of King Arthur, considered by many Victorians the source of their nationhood. Five frescoes painted by William Dyce between 1848 and 1864 cover the walls, depicting allegorical scenes from the legend. Each scene represents a chivalric virtue; the largest, between the two doors, is titled \"Admission of Sir Tristram to the Round Table\" and illustrates the virtue of Hospitality. Seven were originally commissioned but the remaining two paintings were not carried out due to the artist's death, and on the wallpapered panels flanking the Chair of State hang oil portraits of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert by Franz Xaver Winterhalter. Other decorations in the room are also inspired by the Arthurian legend, namely a series of 18 bas-reliefs beneath the paintings, carved in oak by Henry Hugh Armstead, and the frieze running below the ceiling, which displays the attributed coats of arms of the Knights of the Round Table. The ceiling itself is decorated with heraldic badges, as is the border of the wooden floor\u2014which, as can be seen in the adjacent image, is left exposed by the carpeting.\nThe Robing Room was briefly used as the House of Lords' meeting chamber while the House of Lords Chamber was occupied by the House of Commons, whose chamber had been destroyed by the Blitz in 1941.\nRoyal Gallery.\nImmediately north of the Robing Room is the Royal Gallery. At , it is one of the largest rooms in the palace. Its main purpose is to serve as the stage of the royal procession at State Openings of Parliament, which the audience watches from temporary tiered seating on both sides of the route. It has also been used on occasion by visiting statesmen from abroad when addressing both Houses of Parliament, as well as for receptions in honour of foreign dignitaries, and more regularly for the Lord Chancellor's Breakfast; in the past it was the theatre of several trials of peers by the House of Lords. Documents from the Parliamentary Archives are on display in the Royal Gallery (including a facsimile of Charles\u00a0I's death warrant), and the tables and seating offer a workspace for members of the Lords that is conveniently close to their debating chamber.\nThe decorative scheme of the Royal Gallery was meant to display important moments in British military history, and the walls are decorated by two large paintings by Daniel Maclise, each measuring : \"The Death of Nelson\" (depicting Lord Nelson's demise at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805) and \"The Meeting of Wellington and Bl\u00fccher after the Battle of Waterloo\" (showing the Duke of Wellington meeting Gebhard Leberecht von Bl\u00fccher at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815). The murals deteriorated rapidly after their completion due to a range of factors, most importantly atmospheric pollution, and today they are almost monochrome, although a finished study of \"The Death of Nelson\" in better condition hangs in the Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool. The rest of the planned frescos were cancelled, and the walls are filled with portraits of kings and queens from George\u00a0I onwards. Another decorative element with military undertones are the eight statues of gilded Caen stone that flank the three doorways and the bay window of the Gallery, sculpted by John Birnie Philip. Each depicts a monarch during whose reign a key battle or war took place. They are: Alfred the Great and William the Conqueror; Richard I and Edward III; Henry V and Elizabeth I; William III and Anne. The panelled ceiling, above the floor, features Tudor roses and lions, and the stained-glass windows show the coats of arms of the Kings of England and Scotland.\nPrince's Chamber.\nThe Prince's Chamber is a small anteroom between the Royal Gallery and the Lords Chamber, named after the room adjoining the Parliament Chamber in the Old Palace of Westminster. Thanks to its location, it is a place where members of the Lords meet to discuss the business of the House. Several doors lead out of the room, to the division lobbies of the House of Lords and to several important offices.\nThe theme of the Prince's Chamber is Tudor history, and 28 oil portraits painted on panels around the room depict members of the Tudor dynasty. They are the work of Richard Burchett and his pupils, and their creation entailed extensive research, which contributed to the founding of the National Portrait Gallery in 1856. 12 bronze bas-reliefs are set into the wall below the portraits, executed by William Theed in 1855\u20131857. Scenes included are \"The Field of the Cloth of Gold\", \"The Escape of Mary, Queen of Scots\" and \"Raleigh Spreading His Cloak As a Carpet for the Queen\". Above the portraits, at window level, are copies of six of the ten Armada tapestries, which hung in the chamber of the House of Lords until their destruction in the 1834 fire and depicted the defeat of the Spanish Armada in 1588. The project was put on hold in 1861 (by which time only one painting had been completed), and was not revived until 2007; as of \u00a02010[ [update]], all six paintings are now in their intended places.\nThe room also contains a statue of Queen Victoria, seated on a throne (itself placed on a pedestal) and holding a sceptre and a laurel crown, which show that she both governs and rules. This figure is flanked by allegorical statues of Justice and Clemency, the former with a bare sword and an inflexible expression and the latter showing sympathy and offering an olive branch. The sculptural ensemble, made of white marble and carved by John Gibson in 1855, reaches in height; its size has long been considered out of proportion with the fittings of the Prince's Chamber, and the flanking statues ended up in storage between 1955 and 1976. However, the size and location of the group, in the archway opposite the doors to the Royal Gallery (which are removed before State Openings of Parliament to facilitate the royal procession), indicate that it was meant to be seen from a distance, and to symbolically remind the monarch of their royal duties as they would walk down the Royal Gallery on their way to deliver their speech.\nPrecincts of the House of Lords.\nLords Chamber.\nThe Chamber of the House of Lords is located in the southern part of the Palace of Westminster. The lavishly decorated room measures . The benches in the Chamber, as well as other furnishings in the Lords' side of the palace, are coloured red. The upper part of the Chamber is decorated by stained glass windows and by six allegorical frescoes representing religion, chivalry and law.\nAt the south end of the Chamber are the ornate gold Canopy and Throne. However, the Sovereign may theoretically occupy the Throne during any sitting; he or she attends only the State Opening of Parliament. Other members of the Royal Family who attend the State Opening use Chairs of State next to the Throne, and peers' sons are always entitled to sit on the steps of the Throne. In front of the Throne is the Woolsack, an armless red cushion stuffed with wool, representing the historical importance of the wool trade, and used by the officer presiding over the House (the Lord Speaker since 2006, but historically the Lord Chancellor or a deputy). The House's mace, which represents royal authority, is placed on the back of the Woolsack. In front of the Woolsack is the Judges' Woolsack, a larger red cushion that used to be occupied during the State Opening by the Law Lords (who were members of the House of Lords), and prospectively by the Supreme Court Justices and other Judges (whether or not members), to represent the Judicial Branch of Government. The Table of the House, at which the clerks sit, is in front.\nMembers of the House occupy red benches on three sides of the Chamber. The benches on the Lord Speaker's right form the Spiritual Side and those to his left form the Temporal Side. The Lords Spiritual (archbishops and bishops of the established Church of England) all occupy the Spiritual Side. The Lords Temporal (nobles) sit according to party affiliation: members of the Government party sit on the Spiritual Side, while those of the Opposition sit on the Temporal Side. Some peers, who have no party affiliation, sit on the benches in the middle of the House opposite the Woolsack; they are accordingly known as crossbenchers.\nThe Lords Chamber is the site of nationally televised ceremonies, the most important of which is the State Opening of Parliament, which is held formally to open each annual parliamentary session, either after a General Election or in the autumn. At this occasion every constitutional element of the government is represented: the Crown (both literally, and figuratively in the person of the Sovereign), The Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and The Commons, (who together form the Legislature), the Judiciary (although no judges are members of either House of Parliament), and the Executive (both Government Ministers, and ceremonial military units in attendance on the Sovereign); and a large number of guests are invited to attend in the large Royal Gallery immediately outside the Chamber. The Sovereign, seated on the Throne, delivers the Speech from the Throne, outlining the Government's programme for the year and legislative agenda for the forthcoming parliamentary session. The Commons may not enter the Lords' debating floor; instead, they watch the proceedings from beyond the Bar of the House, just inside the door. A small purely formal ceremony is held to end each parliamentary session, when the Sovereign is merely represented by a group of Lords Commissioners.\nFollowing the Blitz, which destroyed the chamber of the House of Commons, the Lords' chamber was occupied by the Commons. The Lords temporarily used the Robing Room during the reconstruction. The State Opening Of Parliament was carried out as normal, with the new rooms being used. Evidence can still be seen of this today, with damage clearly visible on one of the doors where they were struck by Black Rod.\nPeers' Lobby.\nDirectly north of the Lords Chamber lies the Peers' Lobby, an antechamber where Lords can informally discuss or negotiate matters during sittings of the House, as well as collect messages from the doorkeepers, who control access to the Chamber. The Lobby is a square room measuring on each side and in height, and one of its main features is the floor centrepiece, a radiant Tudor rose made of Derbyshire marbles and set within an octagon of engraved brass plates. The rest of the floor is paved with encaustic tiles featuring heraldic designs and Latin mottoes. The walls are faced with white stone and each is pierced by a doorway; above the arches are displayed arms representing the six royal dynasties which ruled England until Queen Victoria's reign (Saxon, Norman, Plantagenet, Tudor, Stuart and Hanoverian). Between them, there are windows stained with the arms of the early aristocratic families of England.\nOf the doorways, the one to the south\u2014which leads into the Lords' Chamber\u2014is the most magnificent, sporting much gilding and decoration, including the full royal arms. The Brass Gates enclose it, a pair of elaborately pierced and studded doors together weighing 1.5 tonnes. The side doors, which feature clocks, open into corridors: to the east extends the Law Lords Corridor, which leads to the libraries, and nearby to the west lies the Moses Room, used for Grand Committees.\nTo the north is the vaulted Peers' Corridor, which is decorated with eight murals by Charles West Cope depicting historical scenes from the period around the English Civil War. The frescoes were executed between 1856 and 1866, and each scene was \"specifically chosen to depict the struggles through which national liberties were won\". Examples include \"Speaker Lenthall Asserting the Privileges of the Commons Against Charles\u00a0I when the Attempt was Made to Seize the Five Members\", representing resistance against absolute rule, and \"The Embarkation of the Pilgrim Fathers for New England\", which illustrates the principle of freedom of worship.\nCentral Lobby.\nOriginally named \"Octagon Hall\" because of its shape, the Central Lobby is the heart of the Palace of Westminster. It lies directly below the Central Tower and forms a busy crossroads between the House of Lords to the south, the House of Commons to the north, St Stephen's Hall and the public entrance to the west, and the Lower Waiting Hall and the libraries to the east. Its location halfway between the two debating chambers has led constitutional theorist Erskine May to describe the Lobby as \"the political centre of the British Empire\", and allows a person standing under the great chandelier to see both the Royal Throne and the Speaker's Chair, provided that all the intervening doors are open. Constituents may meet their Members of Parliament here, even without an appointment, and this practice is the origin of the term \"lobbying\". The hall is also the theatre of the Speaker's Procession, which passes from here on its way to the Commons Chamber before every sitting of the House.\nThe Central Lobby measures across and from the floor to the centre of the vaulted ceiling. The panels between the vault's ribs are covered with Venetian glass mosaic displaying floral emblems and heraldic badges, and the bosses in the intersections of the ribs are also carved into heraldic symbols. Each wall of the Lobby is contained in an arch ornamented with statues of English and Scottish monarchs; on four sides there are doorways, and the tympana above them are adorned with mosaics representing the patron saints of the United Kingdom's constituent nations: Saint George for England, Saint Andrew for Scotland, Saint David for Wales and Saint Patrick for Ireland. The other four arches are occupied by high windows, under which there are stone screens\u2014the hall's post office, one of two in the palace, is located behind one of these screens. In front of them stand four bigger-than-life statues of 19th-century statesmen, including one of four-time prime minister William Gladstone. The floor on which they stand is tiled with Minton encaustic tiles in intricate patterns and includes a passage from written in Latin, which translates as follows: \"Except the Lord build the House their labour is but lost that build it\".\nThe East Corridor leads from the Central Lobby to the Lower Waiting Hall, and its six panels remained blank until 1910, when they were filled with scenes from Tudor history. They were all paid for by Liberal peers and each was the work of a different artist, but uniformity was achieved between the frescoes thanks to a common colour palette of red, black and gold and a uniform height for the depicted characters. One of the scenes is probably not historical: \"Plucking the Red and White Roses in the Old Temple Gardens\", depicting the origin of these flowers as emblems of the Houses of Lancaster and York respectively, was taken from Shakespeare's play \"Henry VI, Part 1\".\nPrecincts of the House of Commons.\nMembers' Lobby.\nContinuing north from the Central Lobby is the Commons' Corridor. It is of almost identical design to its southern counterpart and is decorated with scenes of 17th-century political history between the Civil War and the Revolution of 1688. They were painted by Edward Matthew Ward and include subjects like \"Monk Declaring for a Free Parliament\" and \"The Lords and Commons Presenting the Crown to William III and Mary II in the Banqueting Hall\". Then, mirroring the arrangement at the Lords part of the palace, is another antechamber, the Members' Lobby. In this room, Members of Parliament hold discussions or negotiations, and are often interviewed by accredited journalists, collectively known as \"The Lobby\".\nThe room is similar to the Peers' Lobby but plainer in design and slightly larger, forming a cube on all sides. After the heavy damage it sustained in the 1941 bombing, it was rebuilt in a simplified style, something most evident in the floor, which is almost completely unadorned. The archway of the door leading into the Commons Chamber has been left unrepaired as a reminder of the evils of war, and is now known as the Rubble Arch or Churchill Arch. It is flanked by bronze statues of Winston Churchill and David Lloyd George, the prime ministers who led Britain through the Second and First World War respectively; a foot of each is conspicuously shiny, a result of a long tradition of MPs rubbing them for good luck on their way in before their maiden speech. The Lobby contains the busts and statues of most 20th-century prime ministers, as well as two large boards where MPs can receive letters and telephone messages, which were designed for the House's use and installed in the early 1960s.\nCommons Chamber.\nThe Chamber of the House of Commons is at the northern end of the Palace of Westminster; it was opened in 1950 after the Victorian chamber had been destroyed in 1941 and rebuilt under the architect Giles Gilbert Scott. The Chamber measures and is plainer in style than the Lords Chamber; the benches, as well as other furnishings in the Commons side of the palace, are coloured green. Members of the public are forbidden to sit on the benches. Other parliaments in Commonwealth nations, including those of India, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, have copied the colour scheme under which the Lower House is associated with green, and the Upper House with red.\nAt the north end of the Chamber is the Speaker's Chair, a present to Parliament from Australia. The current British Speaker's Chair is an exact copy of the Speaker's Chair given to Australia (itself a copy of the original chair) by the United Kingdom Branch of the Empire Parliamentary Association, to celebrate the opening of Provisional Parliament House, Canberra. In front of the Speaker's Chair is the Table of the House, at which the clerks sit, and on which is placed the Commons' ceremonial mace. The Table was a gift from Canada. The dispatch boxes, which front-bench Members of Parliament (MPs) often lean on or rest notes on during Questions and speeches, are a gift from New Zealand. There are green benches on either side of the House; members of the Government party occupy benches on the Speaker's right, while those of the Opposition occupy benches on the Speaker's left. There are no cross-benches as in the House of Lords. The Chamber is relatively small, and can accommodate only 427 of the 650 Members of Parliament\u2014during Prime Minister's Questions and in major debates MPs stand at either end of the House.\nBy tradition, the British Sovereign does not enter the Chamber of the House of Commons. The last monarch to do so was King Charles\u00a0I, in 1642. The King sought to arrest five Members of Parliament on charges of high treason, but when he asked the Speaker, William Lenthall, if he had any knowledge of the whereabouts of these individuals, Lenthall famously replied: \"May it please your Majesty, I have neither eyes to see nor tongue to speak in this place but as the House is pleased to direct me, whose servant I am here.\" Since then, in the State Opening of Parliament, when Black Rod representing the monarch approaches the doors to the chamber of the House of Commons to make the summons, the doors are pointedly slammed in his or her face. Black Rod has to strike the door three times with a staff to be admitted and issue the summons from the monarch to the MPs to attend. When repairs after the Second World War bombing were completed, the rebuilt chamber was opened by King George VI on 26 October 1950, who was invited to an \"unofficial\" tour of the new structure by Commons leaders.\nThe two red lines on the floor of the House of Commons are apart, which, by apocryphal tradition, is intended to be just over two sword-lengths. It is said that the original purpose of this was to prevent disputes in the House from degenerating into duels. However, there is no record of a time when Members of Parliament were allowed to bring swords into the Chamber; historically only the Serjeant at Arms has been allowed to carry a sword as a symbol of their role in Parliament, plus Black Rod when summoning the Commons to the Lords, and there are loops of pink ribbon in the Members' cloakroom for MPs to hang up their swords before entering the Chamber. In the days when gentlemen carried swords, there were no lines in the Chamber. Protocol dictates that MPs may not cross these lines when speaking; opposition Members will lambaste a Member of Parliament who violates this convention.\nWestminster Hall.\nWestminster Hall is a large medieval great hall and the oldest surviving palace building. It was erected in 1097 for William II (\"William Rufus\"), at which point it was the largest hall in Europe. The building has had various functions over the years, including being used for judicial purposes from the twelfth to the nineteenth centuries. When a joint address is given to the two chambers of the UK Parliament, the House of Commons and House of Lords, the hall is on rare occasions the venue. It was also used to host coronation banquets until the nineteenth century, and since the twentieth century has been the usual venue for the lyings in state of state and ceremonial funerals.\nThe hall is particularly notable for its hammerbeam roof, a form typical of English Gothic architecture which uses horizontal trusses to span large distances; the hall originally had three aisles. The roof was commissioned for Richard II in 1393 and built by the royal carpenter, Hugh Herland. It is the largest clearspan medieval roof in England, measuring 20.7 by 73.2 metres (68 by 240 ft). The oak timbers came from woods in South-East England and were assembled near Farnham, Surrey, away from Westminster. At the same time, the rest of the hall was remodelled by the master mason Henry Yevele, who refaced the walls and added fifteen life-size statues of kings placed in niches. The renovations include eighty-three unique depictions of Richard's favourite heraldic badge, a resting chained White Hart.\nOther rooms.\nThere are two suites of libraries on the Principal Floor, overlooking the river, for the House of Lords Library and House of Commons Library.\nThe Palace of Westminster also includes state apartments for the presiding officers of the two Houses. The official residence of the Speaker stands at the northern end of the palace; the Lord Chancellor's apartments are at the southern end. Each day, the Speaker and Lord Speaker take part in formal processions from their apartments to their respective Chambers.\nThe Strangers' Bar is one of the numerous bars, cafeterias and restaurants in the Palace of Westminster, with differing rules regarding who is allowed to use their facilities; many of them never close while the House is sitting. There is also a gymnasium, a hair salon; and there was a rifle range (which closed in 2015). Parliament also has two souvenir shops, where items on sale range from House of Commons key-rings and china to House of Commons Champagne.\nSecurity.\nAn official known as Black Rod (officially the Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod, or Lady Usher of the Black Rod) oversees security for the House of Lords, while the Serjeant at Arms does the same for the House of Commons. These officers, however, have primarily ceremonial roles outside the actual chambers of their respective Houses. Security is the responsibility of the Parliamentary Security Director. Parliament has its own professional security force. Tradition still dictates that only the Serjeant at Arms may enter the Commons chamber armed.\nWith rising concern about the possibility that a vehicle full of explosives could be driven into the building, a series of concrete blocks was placed in the roadway in 2003. On the river, an exclusion zone extending from the bank exists, where no unauthorised vessels are allowed to enter.\nThe Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005 formerly made it illegal to hold a protest near the palace, or anywhere else within a designated area extending up to from Parliament Square, without authorisation from the Metropolitan Police. The Act also restricted the operation of loudspeakers in the designated area. These provisions were repealed by the Police Reform and Social Responsibility Act 2011, which replaced them with a total ban on tents and sleeping bags in Parliament Square, as well as a prohibition on the use of loudspeakers in the Square without permission from the relevant local authority.\nMembers of the public continue to have access to the Strangers' Gallery in the House of Commons. Visitors pass through metal detectors and their possessions are scanned. Police from the Palace of Westminster Division of the Metropolitan Police, supported by some armed police from the Diplomatic Protection Group, are always on duty in and around the palace.\nIncidents.\nThe failed Gunpowder Plot of 1605 was a conspiracy among a group of Roman Catholic gentry to re-establish Catholicism in England by assassinating the Protestant King James\u00a0I and replacing him with a Catholic monarch. To this end, they placed large quantities of gunpowder beneath the House of Lords, which one of the conspirators, Guy Fawkes, would detonate during the State Opening of Parliament on 5 November 1605. If successful, the explosion would have destroyed the palace, killing the King, his family and most of the aristocracy. However, the plot was discovered and most of the conspirators were either arrested or killed while trying to evade capture. The survivors were tortured in the Tower of London, tried for high treason in Westminster Hall, convicted and gruesomely executed by hanging, drawing and quartering. Since then, the cellars of the palace have been searched by the Yeomen of the Guard before every State Opening of Parliament, a traditional precaution against any similar attempts against the Sovereign.\nThe execution of Sir Walter Raleigh occurred at the palace of Westminster on 29 October 1618.\nThe previous Palace of Westminster was also the site of a prime-ministerial assassination on 11 May 1812. While in the lobby of the House of Commons, on his way to a parliamentary inquiry, Spencer Perceval was shot and killed by a Liverpool merchant adventurer, John Bellingham. Perceval remains the only British Prime Minister to have been assassinated.\nThe New Palace became the target of Fenian bombs on 24 January 1885, along with the Tower of London. The first bomb, a black bag containing dynamite, was discovered by a visitor on the steps towards the Chapel of St Mary Undercroft. Police Constable (PC) William Cole attempted to carry it to New Palace Yard, but the bag became so hot that Cole dropped it and it exploded. The blast opened a crater in the floor in diameter, damaged the roof of the chapel and shattered all the windows in the Hall, including the stained-glass South Window at St Stephen's Porch. Both Cole and PC Cox, a colleague who had joined him to offer assistance, were seriously injured. A second explosion followed almost immediately in the Commons Chamber, causing great damage\u2014especially to its south end\u2014but no injuries, as it was empty at the time. The incident resulted in the closure of Westminster Hall to visitors for several years; when visitors were re-admitted in 1889, it was under certain restrictions and never while the two Houses were sitting.\nOn 17 June 1974, a bomb planted by the Provisional IRA exploded in Westminster Hall. The explosion and the resulting fire, which was fed by a ruptured gas main, injured 11 people and caused extensive damage. Five years later, a car bomb claimed the life of Airey Neave, a prominent Conservative politician, while he was driving out of the Commons car park in New Palace Yard. The attack occurred on 30 March 1979, one day after the announcement of that year's general election; both the Irish National Liberation Army and the Provisional IRA claimed responsibility for Neave's assassination, but it is now accepted that the former were responsible.\nThe palace has also been the scene of numerous acts of politically motivated \"direct action\", which often took place in the Chamber of the House of Commons. In July 1970, a man in the Strangers' Gallery threw two canisters of tear gas into the Chamber to protest against the use of such gas in Northern Ireland; an MP and two members of the House's staff were taken to hospital, and the sitting was suspended for almost two hours. In 1978, activist Yana Mintoff and another dissident threw bags of horse manure, and in June 1996 demonstrators dropped leaflets. Concern about such attacks and a possible chemical or biological attack led to the installation of a glass screen across the Strangers' Gallery in early 2004.\nThe new barrier does not cover the gallery in front of the Strangers' Gallery, which is reserved for ambassadors, members of the House of Lords, guests of MPs and other dignitaries, and in May 2004 protesters from Fathers 4 Justice attacked Prime Minister Tony Blair with flour bombs from this part, after obtaining admission by bidding for a place in the visitors' gallery in a charity auction. Subsequently, rules on admission to the visitors' galleries were changed, and now individuals wishing to sit in the galleries must first obtain a written pass from a Member certifying that that individual is personally known to them. In September of the same year, five protesters opposed to the proposed ban on fox hunting disrupted the proceedings of the House of Commons by running into the Chamber, the first such occurrence since King Charles I's unauthorised entry in 1642, which triggered the English Civil War.\nProtesters have also targeted the House of Lords. On 2 February 1988, the House debated the Local Government Bill's controversial Clause 28, a measure to prohibit the promotion of homosexuality in schools. Following the division, in which the clause passed, several lesbian demonstrators in the public gallery started chanting slogans, and three of them tied ropes to the railing and climbed down onto the floor of the Chamber. Lord Monkswell, who had provided the women with passes to attend the debate, later apologised to the House for the incident but did not criticise the protest.\nSimilar actions have been carried out outside the Palace of Westminster. Early in the morning of 20 March 2004, two Greenpeace members scaled the Clock Tower to demonstrate against the Iraq War, raising questions about the security around such a likely target of terrorist attacks. In March 2007, another four members of Greenpeace made their way to the palace's roof by means of a nearby crane, which was being used for repairs to Westminster Bridge. Once up, they unfurled a banner protesting against the British government's plans to update the Trident nuclear programme.\nIn February 2008, five campaigners from the Plane Stupid group gained admittance to the building as visitors and then moved up to the roof to demonstrate against the proposed expansion of Heathrow Airport; from there they hung two banners they had smuggled past security. MPs and security experts found it worrying that the protesters made it to the roof in spite of the heightened security measures, and the prosecution at the activists' trial argued that they may have received help from a House of Lords employee. In October 2009, at least forty Greenpeace activists climbed to the roof of Westminster Hall to call for the adoption of policies combating climate change. Some of them climbed down after nearly five hours, while the rest spent the night on the roof.\nOn 22 March 2017, an Islamist-related terror attack was carried out in which a man stabbed a police officer after ploughing into pedestrians on Westminster Bridge. Five people were killed, including the attacker and the police officer. In August 2018 there was another attack, treated by prosecutors as terrorism.\nOn 1 April 2019, a group of environmental protestors from the group Extinction Rebellion stripped semi-naked in the public gallery during a Brexit debate and glued themselves to the handrail and glass screen with their buttocks facing the Commons Chamber. MPs attempted to continue the debate, some of them incorporating puns and references to nakedness into their speeches, to much hilarity.\nThere have been four fires on the Palace of Westminster site during 2019, and eight in 2018.\nIn 2022, the body of the late Queen Elizabeth was left inside the hall for people to pay their respects. A man decided to jump the barriers and pull away the flag draped over the coffin. He was detained and taken away by the police and officials.\nRules and traditions.\nThe palace has accumulated many rules and traditions over the centuries.\nEating, drinking and smoking.\nSmoking has not been allowed in the chamber of the House of Commons since the 17th century. As a result, Members may take snuff instead and the doorkeepers still keep a snuff-box for this purpose. Despite persistent media rumours, it has not been permitted to smoke anywhere inside the palace since 2005. Members may not eat or drink in the chamber; the exception to this rule is the Chancellor of the Exchequer, who may have a beverage of the Chancellors' choice while delivering the Budget statement. Traditionally, this is an alcoholic beverage, often whisky or a similar spirit, but in recent times, Chancellors have opted for water.\nDress code.\nMen are expected to wear formal attire, women are expected to dress in business-like clothing and the wearing of T-shirts with slogans is not allowed. Hats must not be worn (although they used to be worn when a point of order was being raised), and members may not wear military decorations or insignia. Members are not allowed to have their hands in their pockets\u2014Andrew Robathan was heckled by opposing MPs for doing this on 19 December 1994.\nOther traditions.\nThe only animals allowed in the Palace of Westminster are guide dogs, police dogs and police horses.\nSpeeches may not be read out during debate in the House of Commons, although notes may be referred to. Similarly, the reading of newspapers is not allowed. Visual aids are discouraged in the chamber. Applause is also not normally allowed in the Commons, but it has since been tolerated in certain cases. Some notable exceptions to this were when Robin Cook gave his resignation speech in 2003; when Prime Minister Tony Blair appeared for the last time at Prime Minister's Questions; when Speaker Michael Martin gave his leaving speech on 17 June 2009; and after the resignation statement of Sir Robert Rogers, Clerk of the House. At the start of the new parliament in May 2015, the large influx of new Scottish National Party MPs flouted the convention and repeatedly applauded their party leader, to the displeasure of the Speaker.\nThe status of the building as a royal palace raises legal questions\u2014according to Halsbury's Laws of England, it is not possible to arrest a person within the \"verges\" of the palace (the palace itself and its immediate surroundings). However, according to a memorandum by the Clerk of the House of Commons, there is no prohibition on arrest within the palace and such arrests have been effected in the past.\nCulture and tourism.\nThe exterior of the Palace of Westminster\u2014especially the Elizabeth Tower which houses the bell known as Big Ben, and its setting on the bank of the River Thames\u2014is recognised worldwide, and is one of the most visited tourist attractions in London. Tsar Nicholas I called it \"a dream in stone\". The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) classifies the Palace of Westminster, along with neighbouring Westminster Abbey and St Margaret's, as a World Heritage Site. It is also a Grade I listed building.\nAlthough there is no casual access to the interior of the palace, there are several ways to gain admittance. UK residents may obtain tickets from an MP for a place in the viewing (\"strangers\") gallery of the House of Commons, or from a Lord for a seat in the gallery of the House of Lords. It is also possible for both UK residents and overseas visitors to queue for admission to them at any time of the day or night when either House is in session, but capacity is limited and there is no guarantee of admission. Either House may exclude \"strangers\" if it desires to sit in private. Members of the public can also queue for a seat in a committee session, where admission is free and places cannot be booked, or they may visit the Parliamentary Archives for research purposes. Booking an appointment is necessary in the latter case, along with proof of identity.\nFree guided tours of the palace are held throughout the parliamentary session for UK residents, who can apply through their MP or a member of the House of Lords. The tours last about 75\u00a0minutes and include the state rooms, the chambers of the two Houses and Westminster Hall. Paid-for tours are available to both UK and overseas visitors during the summer recess and Saturdays throughout the year. Tours of the Elizabeth Tower were suspended until 2021 while the tower underwent refurbishment.\nArchitectural historian Dan Cruickshank selected the palace as one of his five choices for the 2006 BBC television documentary series \"Britain's Best Buildings\".\nThe nearest London Underground station is Westminster, on the District, Circle and Jubilee lines.\nIn 2015, Parliament organised a year-long programme of events called \"Parliament in the Making\" to celebrate the 800th anniversary of the sealing of Magna Carta on 15 June, and the 750th anniversary of the first representative parliament on 20 January. Events were coordinated with Parliament Week. The BBC held events throughout the year including a \"Democracy Day\" on 20 January consisting of live discussions and debate in partnership with the Speaker's Office of the House of Commons, including broadcasts from inside the Palace of Westminster.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "24171", "revid": "671411", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24171", "title": "Plautus", "text": "Roman comic playwright (c. 254 \u2013 184 BC)\nTitus Maccius Plautus ( ; c. 254 \u2013 184 BC) was a Roman playwright of the Old Latin period. His comedies are the earliest Latin literary works to have survived in their entirety. He wrote Palliata comoedia, the genre devised by Livius Andronicus, the innovator of Latin literature. The word Plautine () refers to both Plautus's own works and works similar to or influenced by his.\nHe influenced some of the greatest figures in literature, including Shakespeare and Moli\u00e8re (\"The Miser\" is partly modeled after Plautus's \"Aulularia\").\nBiography.\nNot much is known about Plautus's early life. It is believed that he was born in Sarsina, a small town in Emilia Romagna in northern Italy, around 254 BC. According to Morris Marples, Plautus worked as a stage-carpenter or scene-shifter in his early years. It is from this work, perhaps, that his love of the theater originated. His acting talent was eventually discovered; and he adopted the nomen \"Maccius\" (from Maccus, a clownish stock character in Atellan Farce) and agnomen \"Plautus\" (\"trampled flat\", usually in reference to \"flat-footed\" but sometimes intending \"flat-eared\" like the ears of a hound). Tradition holds that he made enough money to go into the nautical business, but that the venture collapsed. He is then said to have worked as a manual laborer and to have studied Greek drama\u2014particularly the New Comedy of Menander\u2014in his leisure. His studies allowed him to produce his plays, which were released between c.\u2009205 and 184 BC. Plautus attained such popularity that his name alone became a hallmark of theatrical success.\nPlautus's comedies are mostly adapted from Greek models for a Roman audience, and are often based directly on the works of the Greek playwrights. He reworked the Greek texts to give them a flavour that would appeal to the local Roman audiences. They are the earliest surviving intact works in Latin literature.\nPlautus's epitaph read:\nSince Plautus is dead, Comedy mourns,\nThe stage is deserted; then Laughter, Jest and Wit,\nAnd all Melody's countless numbers wept together.\nThe play is set in Thebes in Greece. While the general, Amphitruo, is away fighting a war, the god Jupiter visits his house and sleeps with his wife Alcumena, disguising himself as her husband. Jupiter's son Mercury, disguised as Amphitruo's slave Sosia, keeps watch outside, and when the real Sosia turns up bringing news of the victory, Mercury teases him and beats him up. When Amphitruo turns up, Alcumena is surprised to see him back so soon. There is a quarrel and Amphitruo accuses her of adultery. He goes off to fetch a witness. Then Jupiter comes back for a second session with Alcumena, and when Amphitruo returns, Mercury, still disguised as Sosia, climbs on the roof and mischievously pelts him with tiles. (\"There is a gap in the manuscripts here\".) Amphitruo, infuriated, is about to burst into the house and kill everybody, when suddenly there is a thunderclap; a nurse comes out and reports that Alcumena has given birth miraculously to two boys (one of them Hercules). Finally Jupiter appears and explains everything to Amphitruo.\nDemaenetus, an Athenian gentleman, tells his slave Libanus that he knows his son Argyrippus is in love with a prostitute, Philaenium, but has no money to pay for her. He asks the cunning Libanus to find the money by cheating his wealthy wife Artemona or her steward Saurea. Libanus is at a loss for a plan until his fellow slave, Leonida, by chance meets a stranger who has come to pay a debt to Saurea for some donkeys which had earlier been sold to a certain merchant. Leonida pretends to be Saurea, and he and Libanus gull the stranger into handing the money over to Leonida. The money is given to Argyrippus but with the stipulation that his father is to be allowed to spend the first night with Philaenium. But a rival lover, Diabolus, who wants Philaenium for himself, and arrives too late with his money, out of jealousy asks his parasite (hanger on) to inform Artemona what is going on. She storms to the brothel in a fury and drags her husband away to his great embarrassment, leaving Argyrippus to enjoy Philaenium by himself.\nA miserly old man, Euclio, has found a pot () of gold in his house, and keeps checking that no one has stolen it. His wealthy neighbour Megadorus comes to ask for the hand of Euclio's daughter Phaedrium, unaware that she was earlier raped and is heavily pregnant. Soon Megadorus's slave Strobilus arrives with two hired cooks to prepare a wedding feast; he instructs one of the cooks, Congrio, to go to Euclio's house and start work. When Euclio returns he is alarmed, thinking his gold is being stolen, and he chases Congrio out into the street. Euclio decides to hide the pot first in a neighbouring temple, and later in a grove outside the city, but he is spied on each time by a slave of Megadorus's nephew Lyconides. Euclio is horrified to find that his gold has been stolen despite his precautions. At this point Lyconides confesses to Euclio that he raped Phaedrium and wishes to marry her. Later Lyconides discovers that it was his slave who stole the gold, and he insists that it must be returned. (\"The manuscript breaks off here, but from the ancient summary it seems that Lyconides returned the gold to Euclio, who consented to the marriage and gave him the gold as a dowry\".)\n(\"The first few scenes of the play are missing.\") The young man Mnesilochus is in love with a courtesan called Bacchis. While he is abroad, his friend Pistoclerus falls in love with Bacchis's twin sister, also called Bacchis. Mnesilochus returns from his two-year stay in Ephesus, where he had been sent by his father Nicobulus to collect some money. Mnesilochus's cunning slave Chrysalus deceives Nicobulus into thinking that part of the money is still in Ephesus; in this way Mnesilochus will be able to keep some of the money to pay for Bacchis's services. But when Mnesilochus hears that Pistoclerus has a girlfriend called Bacchis, in his anger he gives all the money to his father, keeping none back. Too late, he learns from Pistoclerus that there are two Bacchises. He begs Chrysalus to play another trick on his father to get the money he needs. Chrysalus tells Nicobulus that Mnesilochus has been making love to the wife of a soldier called Cleomachus who is threatening to kill Mnesilochus. To protect his son, Nicobulus willingly promises to pay 200 gold pieces. Later, in yet another deception, Chrysalus persuades Nicobulus to pay another 200 gold pieces to prevent his son committing perjury. But shortly afterwards when Nicobulus meets the soldier he learns that Bacchis is only a courtesan who owed the soldier money. Furious, Nicobulus and Pistoclerus's father Philoxenus go to the Bacchises' house to confront their sons; the two sisters come out and charm them and persuade them to come in and enjoy the party.\nThe play is set in Aetolia in western Greece. An old man, Hegio, has been buying up prisoners-of-war from Elis in the hope of exchanging one of them for his own son, who has himself been captured in Elis. Among Hegio's captives are a young man, Philocrates, and his loyal slave Tyndarus, who have swapped identities so that Philocrates can go back to his family in Elis. The plan works, and Philocrates goes home. Meanwhile another Elian captive, Aristophontes, recognises Tyndarus and inadvertently informs Hegio what has happened. Tyndarus is sent to hard labour in a stone quarry. Later a parasite/hanger-on Ergasilus excitedly brings news that Hegio's son has arrived at the harbour. Philocrates arrives, together with Hegio's son, Philopolemus, bringing a run-away slave called Stalagmus. When Stalagmus is interrogated he reveals that Tyndarus is none other than Hegio's long-lost son whom Stalagmus had kidnapped and sold years before. Tyndarus is rescued from his punishment and reunited with his father.\nA father and son, Lysidamus and Euthynicus, are both in love with the beautiful Casina, a 16-year-old girl who was adopted into their family as a baby. The father sends his son abroad on a trip and plans for Casina to marry his farm-manager Olympio, so that he can use her as a mistress whenever he likes without his wife Cleostrata knowing. When Cleostrata discovers his intention, she plans for Casina to marry Euthynicus's servant Chalinus, to keep her safe until Euthynicus returns. When, after lots are drawn, her plan fails, she dresses up Chalinus as Casina and sends him into the bedroom of the neighbour's house where Lysidamus is planning to spend the night with Casina. The husband is exposed, and Casina is kept safe for Euthynicus's return.\nA young courtesan, Selenium, is in love with her first and only lover, a wealthy young man called Alcesimarchus, who has promised to marry her. But she is distressed to hear that Alcesimarchus is now engaged to marry another girl. Selenium believes she is the daughter of the courtesan Melaenis, but in fact her birth mother is Phanostrata, the mother of Alcesimarchus's fianc\u00e9e. By chance Melaenis overhears Phanostrata's slave, Lampadio, who had been ordered to expose Selenium as a baby, telling his mistress that he had found the old woman who had picked her up, and that he learnt that she had given the baby to be adopted by a courtesan called Melaenis. Melaenis immediately hurries off to fetch the recognition tokens which she has been keeping in a small casket (). The casket is accidentally dropped in the street by the maid; it is found by Lampadio and shown to Phanostrata, who recognises the tokens. Alcesimarchus is now free to marry his beloved Selenium and all ends well.\nPhaedromus is a young man in Epidaurus in Greece, who is in love with a girl Planesium owned by a pimp Cappadox. Lacking the money to purchase her, Phaedromus had sent Curculio, a \"parasite\" (hanger-on), to Caria to borrow money from a certain friend. When he returns, Curculio tells Phaedromus that the friend had no money, but that he, Curculio, had met a soldier called Therapontigonus, who had told him that he intended to buy Planesium for himself. Curculio had stolen the soldier's signet ring and hurried back to Epidaurus. Wearing a disguise and carrying his forged letter, he tricks the banker Lyso into paying the money to Cappadox, and so is able to purchase Planesium for Phaedromus. Planesium, however, recognises the ring as one that had once belonged to her father, and when the soldier arrives in Epidaurus he in turn recognises a ring which he had once given to her. Phaedromus is able to marry Planesium, and, because Planesium proves to be free-born, Cappadox is obliged to return the money that was paid for her.\nThe slave Epidicus's young master Stratippocles returns from the war in Thebes, bringing a captive girl he has fallen in love with. He orders Epidicus to find 40 \"minae\" to pay for her. This alarms Epidicus, since earlier Stratippocles had made him find the money to buy a different girl, and Epidicus had done this by fooling Stratippocles' father Periphanes into believing that the girl was his daughter. Epidicus has an idea. He convinces Periphanes that Stratippocles is still in love with his music girl and has borrowed money to buy her. To prevent this, Epidicus suggests that Periphanes should buy the girl himself, and sell her to a certain army officer for a profit. Periphanes pays, but Epidicus brings him a different music-girl hired for the day and hands the money to Stratippocles. When the officer arrives he tells Periphanes it is not the same girl he wanted to buy. Now Philippa, a woman that Periphanes had raped years before, arrives, looking for her daughter who has been captured in the war. She and Periphanes recognise each other, but when he brings out the girl who Epidicus told him was their daughter, Philippa says it is not her. Epidicus is now in big trouble since he has fooled Periphanes twice. But by a lucky chance, when the captive arrives, Epidicus recognises her: she is Philippa's daughter. Periphanes is so delighted to have found his missing daughter that he forgives Epidicus and gives him his freedom.\nThe play is set in Epidamnus in western Greece. The play opens when Peniculus, a \"parasite\", arrives at the house of Menaechmus hoping to be given dinner. Menaechmus comes out, quarrelling with his shrewish wife. He tells Peniculus that he is going to give a cloak (actually his wife's) to his girlfriend the courtesan Erotium, who lives next door. They persuade Erotium to invite them to dinner, and while waiting they go to the forum for drink. Meanwhile Menaechmus's twin brother, also called Menaechmus, arrives from Syracuse with his slave Messenio, looking for his long-lost twin. Erotium greets him warmly, invites him in for dinner and afterwards gives him the cloak requesting it to be altered. A series of misunderstandings follows, during which the first Menaechmus gets tied up by his father-in-law and a doctor who think he has gone mad; he is rescued by Messenio. The two brothers finally meet. The first Menaechmus decides to auction off all his goods (including his wife) and return to Syracuse with his brother. Messenio claims his freedom for rescuing Menaechmus I.\nCharinus, son of the Athenian merchant Demipho, met a beautiful girl called Pasicompsa in Rhodes and has brought her back to Athens. He intends to pretend that he has bought her as a maid for his mother. But his father catches sight of Pasicompsa at the port, and wants her for himself. He tells his son that Pasicompsa is too beautiful to be a maid, and insists she must be sold. He arranges for his friend Lysimachus to buy her and take her to his (Lysimachus's) house. But Lysimachus's wife returns unexpectedly from the country and when a cook turns up to prepare a feast there is a row. Lysimachus's son Eutychus, who is a friend of Charinus, learns from a maid that Pasicompsa is inside the house. He fetches Charinus, who was about to go abroad in despair, and brings him to rescue Pasicompsa. Afterwards Eutychus meets Lysimachus and Demipho and chastises Demipho for his disgraceful behaviour.\nThe play is set in Ephesus. A boastful soldier, Pyrgopolynices, has abducted a courtesan, Philocomasium, from Athens. A resourceful slave, Palaestrio, has separately been captured and is now working in the same house. Palaestrio's former master, the young Athenian Pleusicles, is in love with Philocomasium and has come to Ephesus to rescue her; he is lodging next door with a jovial old bachelor called Periplectomenus. Palaestrio has made a hole in the wall between the houses so that Philocomasium can visit Pleusicles. Unfortunately the lovers are spotted by Sceledrus, one of the soldier's servants. Palaestrio comes up with a plan to pretend that the girl next door is Philocomasium's twin sister, and he and Periplectomenus have fun tricking not very bright Sceledrus while Philocomasium pops out first from one door then the other. Palaestrio now thinks up another plan. He gets a resourceful local courtesan Acroteleutium and her maid Milphidippa to pretend that Acroteleutium is the wealthy owner of the house next door, and that she is madly in love with the soldier. The plan works, and Pyrgopolynices orders Philocomasium to depart to make room for his new bride. But when he goes next door to claim his bride he is thoroughly beaten up by Periplectomenus's servants.\n A young man, Philolaches, is in love with a courtesan Philematium, and in his father's absence has borrowed money to buy her. Suddenly, while he and his friend Callidamates are partying, his slave Tranio brings news of the father's return. Tranio ushers everyone inside the house and when the father, Theopropides, arrives, deceives him into thinking that the house is haunted by a ghost and cannot be entered. Next Tranio tricks the neighbour, Simo, into letting Theopropides inspect his house, which Theopropides has been told is for sale. While Tranio is off-stage, Theopropides meets two of Callidamates's slaves and realises that he has been tricked by Tranio. He is determined to punish him. But Callidamates appears and begs Theopropides to forgive both Philolaches and Tranio.\nThe cunning slave Toxilus, who is looking after his master's house while he is away, is in love with Lemniselenis, a courtesan owned by the pimp Dordalus, who lives next door. He persuades his friend Sagaristio, another cunning slave, to lend him the money needed to buy her, promising to get the money back from Dordalus by a trick. Meanwhile he persuades another friend, the parasite Saturio, to lend his daughter for the trick. Sagaristio dresses up as a Persian, and sells the girl to Dordalus for a large sum pretending she is an Arabian captive. Immediately afterwards Saturio comes to reclaim his daughter from Dordalus on the grounds that she is an Athenian citizen and drags him off to court. Since no guarantee was given at the time of the sale, the money does not have to be returned, and Toxilus and Sagaristio celebrate their victory.\nThe play is set in Calydon in central Greece. A young man, Agorastocles, is in love with a slave-courtesan Adelphasium owned by a slave-dealer Lycus. He and his slave Milphio spot Adelphasium and her sister in the street and each try to win her over, but she rejects their overtures. Milphio suggests a plan to send Agorastocles' estate-manager Collybiscus to Lycus's house pretending to be a rich customer. Agorastocles brings some witnesses to observe Collybiscus taking a lot of money into the house. They trick Lycus into denying that any slave with money has come to the house, and Agorastocles threatens to take him to court. Lycus flees. Now a Carthaginian traveller comes to the town, speaking in Punic, looking for his two lost daughters, who had been captured in childhood by pirates. Hanno recognises Agorastocles from a monkey-bite scar as the son of his late cousin. He also discovers that Adelphasium and her sister are his daughters. There is a joyful reunion and Agorastocles declares that he will go back to Carthage with Hanno and the girls.\nThe young man Calidorus is distressed because his beloved, the slave-courtesan Phoenicium, has been sold to a Macedonian army officer. He is unable to find the 20 \"minae\" needed to buy her. The cunning slave Pseudolus promises to help. In the next scene, Phoenicium's owner, the slave-dealer Ballio, brings all his slaves and courtesans out into the street and berates them angrily, ordering them to prepare a feast for his birthday. Later, Pseudolus meets Calidorus's father Simo and bets him 20 \"minae\" that Phoenicium will be free by the end of the day. At this point Harpax, a servant of the officer, arrives bringing the balance of the money to be paid for Phoenicium. Pseudolus pretends to be Ballio's steward, and Harpax hands him a letter from the officer to Ballio. Now Pseudolus dresses up another cunning slave, Simio, as Harpax and sends him to meet Ballio. The plan works and Phoenicium is released. When the real Harpax returns, Simo and Ballio think that this just is one of Pseudolus's tricks and tease the boy lewdly. Too late, they realise that he is genuine. Ballio has to pay Simo the 20 \"minae\" he has bet that Pseudolus will not get the better of them, and Simo has to pay Pseudolus 20 \"minae\", although Pseudolus, who by this time is very drunk, generously offers to return Simo half the money if he will attend a party with him.\nTwo girls, Palaestra and Ampelisca, escape from the sea after a shipwreck off the coast of north Africa and seek refuge in a nearby temple of Venus. The young slave Trachalio, who is in love with Ampelisca, discovers them there. Now the slave-dealer Labrax, accompanied by his business-partner Charmides, who have also been shipwrecked, arrive. When he learns that the girls are in the temple, Labrax goes in to seize them. The girls are rescued by Trachalio, with the assistance of Daemones, who lives next door to the temple. Trachalio fetches his young master, Plesidippus, who is in love with Palaestra and has already paid Labrax a deposit to buy her. Plesidippus takes Labrax to court to sue him for fraud. In the second half of the play, Daemones' slave Gripus appears, dragging a basket which he has rescued from the sea. Trachalio finds him and, suspecting that the case contains Labrax's money and the tokens which will enable Palaestra to prove her identity, prevents him from stealing it by holding on to the rope by which Gripus is dragging the basket. Daemones is delighted to discover from the tokens that Palaestra is his own long-lost daughter. He forces Labrax to give Gripus the reward he had promised. Daemones uses the money to buy freedom for Gripus and Ampelisca, and invites everyone to dinner.\nTwo sisters, Philumena and Pamphila, are complaining that their husbands have been away for three years and their father is pressuring them to remarry. The father Antipho arrives and first asks their advice about his getting a new wife, then broaches the subject of their remarrying; but the sisters firmly refuse. When he has gone, Philumena sends for the parasite Gelasimus; she wants to send him to see if there is news of her husband's ship. Gelasimus arrives, but shortly afterwards a slave boy Pinacium also comes bringing news that the ship has arrived. Gelasimus tries to angle for a dinner invitation but is rebuffed. Philumena's husband Epignomus soon arrives with his slave Stichus: Stichus asks for a day's holiday, which is granted together with some wine to celebrate it. For the third time Gelasimus tries his luck for a dinner invitation, but is rebuffed. Now Pamphila's husband Pamphilippus arrives talking to Antipho, who hints that he would like to be given a music girl; the request is granted. Again Gelasimus angles for an invitation and is rebuffed. In the final part of the play Stichus and his friend Sangarinus celebrate Stichus's safe return with some food and drink and dancing, at which they are joined by their shared girlfriend Stephanium.\nAn Athenian gentleman, Megaronides, reproaches his friend Callicles for having purchased the house of his neighbour Charmides, who is away in Syria, for a cheap price. Callicles explains that he did this honourably since he wanted to protect the house and the treasure buried in it from the spendthrift habits of Charmides' son Lesbonicus. Meanwhile Lesbonicus's friend Lysiteles tells his father Philto that in order to help Lesbonicus he wishes to marry Charmides's daughter without a dowry. Philto goes to Lesbonicus to propose the match, but the plan is thwarted when Lesbonicus refuses to give away his sister without a dowry, as it would dishonour her. Callicles, when he learns this, consults his friend Megaronides, who advises him to use Charmides' buried treasure as a dowry. When Callicles says he does not want to tell Lesbonicus about the treasure in case he misuses it, Megaronides suggests they hire an imposter for three coins (Latin ), dress him up and make him pretend that he has brought the money from Charmides in Syria. Charmides now arrives back and has an amusing conversation with the imposter. At first Charmides reproaches Callicles for buying the house but when Callicles explains everything, Charmides is delighted. Lysiteles is allowed to marry Charmides' daughter, and Lesbonicus is betrothed to Callicles' daughter.\nA courtesan, Phronesium, has three lovers: Diniarchus, a young man from the city; Strabax, a young farmer; and Stratophanes, an army officer from the east. Diniarchus, returning from abroad, visits Phronesium but is not allowed to enter. It appears that Phronesium has found a baby and she is going to pretend that the baby is Stratophanes' child. Next the soldier Stratophanes arrives but the gifts he brings are not enough and he is refused admission. Diniarchus's cook Cyamus now arrives bringing gifts sent by his master, and the jealous Stratophanes quarrels with him. The farmer Strabax now arrives with money and is admitted. His slave Truculentus, who is following him to prevent him wasting his father's money, himself falls prey to the allurements of Phronesium's maid Astaphium. Now Diniarchus comes back, but since Phronesium is busy with Strabax, he is again refused admission, despite all the presents he had sent. At this moment an old gentleman called Callicles arrives, looking for the baby which his daughter had given birth to after being raped. Two slave-girls, threatened with punishment, inform him that the baby was given to Phronesium and that the father is Diniarchus. Diniarchus begs Callicles for forgiveness, and he offers to make amends by marrying the daughter. However, when he asks Phronesium for the baby, she asks to keep it for a while longer to continue her deception of Stratophanes. When Stratophanes comes he finds Strabax emerging from the house, and quarrels jealously with him, but, despite the fact that Stratophanes pays Phronesium a further huge sum of money, Strabax wins the day.\nFragmentary plays.\nOnly the titles and various fragments of these plays have survived.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nManuscript tradition.\nThe oldest manuscript of Plautus is a palimpsest, known as the Ambrosian palimpsest (A), since it is kept in the Ambrosian Library in Milan. It is thought to date to the 5th century, but it was not discovered until 1815. This manuscript is only partly legible, since the parchment was cleaned and a copy of the books of Kings and Chronicles was written on top. Parts of the text are completely missing (for example, nothing survives of \"Amphitruo\", \"Asinaria\", \"Aulularia\", or of the first 475 lines of \"Bacchides\"), and other parts are barely legible. The most legible parts of A are found in the plays \"Persa\", \"Poenulus\", \"Pseudolus\", and \"Stichus\". Despite its fragmentary state, this palimpsest has proved very valuable in correcting the errors of P.\nA second manuscript tradition is represented by manuscripts of the Palatine family, so called because two of its most important manuscripts were once kept in the library of the Elector Palatine in Heidelberg in Germany. The archetype of this family is now lost but it can be reconstructed from various later manuscripts, some of them containing either only the first half or the second half of the plays. The most important manuscript of this group is \"B\", of the 10th or early 11th century, now kept in the Vatican library. Manuscripts C and D also belong to this family. The lost original P, from which all these manuscripts were copied, is ascribed by Lindsay to the 8th or 9th century. Because of certain errors which both A and the P family have in common, it is thought that they are not completely independent, but are both copies of a single manuscript dating to perhaps the 4th or 5th century AD.\nAt some stage the plays in the P family were divided into two halves, one containing \"Amphitruo\" to \"Epidicus\" (omitting \"Bacchides\"), and the other containing \"Bacchides\" and \"Menaechmi\" to \"Truculentus\". The first eight plays are found in B, and the first three and part of \"Captivi\" are found in D. The last twelve plays are found in B, C, and D. In addition there was once a fragmentary manuscript called the Codex Turnebi (T), which was used by a French scholar called Turn\u00e8be in the 16th century. Although this manuscript is now lost, some readings from it were preserved by Turn\u00e8be himself, and others were recorded in the margins of a 16th-century edition discovered by Lindsay in the Bodleian Library in Oxford.\nThere are certain indications (for example, small gaps in the text where there appears to have been in a hole or in the parchment) that the original P manuscript was copied from an earlier manuscript with 19, 20 or 21 lines to the page, in other words it was a book very similar to A, which has 19 lines to the page, and probably it was about the same age. However, the order of plays in A is slightly different from that in the P family of manuscripts. The headings at the top of the scenes in A, containing character names, which were written in red ink, have been totally washed away, and those in the P family seem to be based on guesswork and so were also probably missing in an ancestor of the lost P codex. For this reason the names of some of the minor characters are not known.\nHistorical context.\nThe historical context within which Plautus wrote can be seen, to some extent, in his comments on contemporary events and persons. Plautus was a popular comedic playwright while Roman theatre was still in its infancy and still largely undeveloped. At the same time, the Roman Republic was expanding in power and influence.\nRoman society deities.\nPlautus was sometimes accused of teaching the public indifference and mockery of the gods. Any character in his plays could be compared to a god. Whether to honour a character or to mock him, these references were demeaning to the gods. These references to the gods include a character comparing a mortal woman to a god, or saying he would rather be loved by a woman than by the gods. Pyrgopolynices from \"Miles Gloriosus\" (vs. 1265), in bragging about his long life, says he was born one day later than Jupiter. In \"Curculio\", Phaedrome says \"I am a god\" when he first meets with Planesium. In \"Pseudolus,\" Jupiter is compared to Ballio the pimp. It is not uncommon, too, for a character to scorn the gods, as seen in \"Poenulus\" and \"Rudens\".\nTolliver argues that drama both reflects and foreshadows social change. It is likely that there was already much skepticism about the gods in Plautus' era. Plautus did not make up or encourage irreverence to the gods, but reflected ideas of his time. The state controlled stage productions, and Plautus' plays would have been banned, had they been too risqu\u00e9.\nSecond Punic War and Macedonian War.\nThe Second Punic War occurred from 218 to 201 BC; its central event was Hannibal's invasion of Italy. M. Leigh has devoted an extensive chapter about Plautus and Hannibal in his 2004 book, \"Comedy and the Rise of Rome\". He says that \"the plays themselves contain occasional references to the fact that the state is at arms...\". One good example is a piece of verse from the \"Miles Gloriosus,\" the composition date of which is not clear but which is often placed in the last decade of the 3rd century BC. A. F. West believes that this is inserted commentary on the Second Punic War. In his article \"On a Patriotic Passage in the \"Miles Gloriosus\" of Plautus\", he states that the war \"engrossed the Romans more than all other public interests combined\". The passage seems intended to rile up the audience, beginning with \"hostis tibi adesse\", or \"the foe is near at hand\".\nAt the time, the general Scipio Africanus wanted to confront Hannibal, a plan \"strongly favored by the plebs\". Plautus apparently pushes for the plan to be approved by the senate, working his audience up with the thought of an enemy in close proximity and a call to outmaneuver him. Therefore, it is reasonable to say that Plautus, according to P. B. Harvey, was \"willing to insert [into his plays] highly specific allusions comprehensible to the audience\". M. Leigh writes in his chapter on Plautus and Hannibal that \"the Plautus who emerges from this investigation is one whose comedies persistently touch the rawest nerves in the audience for whom he writes\".\nLater, coming off the heels of the conflict with Hannibal, Rome was preparing to embark on another military mission, this time in Greece. While they would eventually move on Philip V in the Second Macedonian War, there was considerable debate beforehand about the course Rome should take in this conflict. But starting this war would not be an easy task considering those recent struggles with Carthage\u2014many Romans were too tired of conflict to think of embarking on another campaign. As W. M. Owens writes in his article \"Plautus' \"Stichus\" and the Political Crisis of 200 B.C.\", \"There is evidence that antiwar feeling ran deep and persisted even after the war was approved.\" Owens contends that Plautus was attempting to match the complex mood of the Roman audience riding the victory of the Second Punic War but facing the beginning of a new conflict. For instance, the characters of the dutiful daughters and their father seem obsessed over the idea of \"officium\", the duty one has to do what is right. Their speech is littered with words such as \"pietas\" and \"aequus\", and they struggle to make their father fulfill his proper role. The stock parasite in this play, Gelasimus, has a patron-client relationship with this family and offers to do any job in order to make ends meet; Owens puts forward that Plautus is portraying the economic hardship many Roman citizens were experiencing due to the cost of war.\nWith the repetition of responsibility to the desperation of the lower class, Plautus establishes himself firmly on the side of the average Roman citizen. While he makes no specific reference to the possible war with Greece or the previous war (that might be too dangerous), he does seem to push the message that the government should take care of its own people before attempting any other military actions.\nInfluences.\nGreek New Comedy.\nGreek New Comedy greatly differs from the plays of Aristophanes. The most notable difference, according to Dana F. Sutton, is that New Comedy, in comparison to Old Comedy, is \"devoid of a serious political, social or intellectual content\" and \"could be performed in any number of social and political settings without risk of giving offense\". The risk-taking for which Aristophanes is known is noticeably lacking in the New Comedy plays of Menander. Instead, there is much more of a focus on the home and the family unit\u2014something that the Romans, including Plautus, could easily understand and adopt for themselves later in history.\nFather\u2013son relationships.\nOne main theme of Greek New Comedy is the father\u2013son relationship. For example, in Menander's \"Dis Exapaton\" there is a focus on the betrayal between age groups and friends. The father-son relationship is very strong and the son remains loyal to the father. The relationship is always a focus, even if it's not the focus of every action taken by the main characters. In Plautus, on the other hand, the focus is still on the relationship between father and son, but we see betrayal between the two men that wasn't seen in Menander. There is a focus on the proper conduct between a father and son that, apparently, was so important to Roman society at the time of Plautus.\nThis becomes the main difference and, also, similarity between Menander and Plautus. They both address \"situations that tend to develop in the bosom of the family\". Both authors, through their plays, reflect a patriarchal society in which the father-son relationship is essential to proper function and development of the household. It is no longer a political statement, as in Old Comedy, but a statement about household relations and proper behavior between a father and his son. But the attitudes on these relationships seem much different\u2014a reflection of how the worlds of Menander and Plautus differed.\nFarce.\nThere are differences not just in how the father\u2013son relationship is presented, but also in the way in which Menander and Plautus write their poetry. William S. Anderson discusses the believability of Menander versus the believability of Plautus and, in essence, says that Plautus' plays are much less believable than those plays of Menander because they seem to be such a farce in comparison. He addresses them as a reflection of Menander with some of Plautus' own contributions. Anderson argues there is unevenness in the poetry of Plautus that results in \"incredulity and refusal of sympathy of the audience.\"\nPrologues.\nThe poetry of Menander and Plautus is best juxtaposed in their prologues. Robert B. Lloyd makes the point that \"albeit the two prologues introduce plays whose plots are of essentially different types, they are almost identical in form...\" He goes on to address the specific style of Plautus that differs so greatly from Menander. He says that the \"verbosity of the Plautine prologues has often been commented upon and generally excused by the necessity of the Roman playwright to win his audience.\" However, in both Menander and Plautus, word play is essential to their comedy. Plautus might seem more verbose, but where he lacks in physical comedy he makes up for it with words, alliteration and paronomasia (punning). See also \"jokes and wordplay\" below.\nPlautus is well known for his devotion to puns, especially when it comes to the names of his characters. In \"Miles Gloriosus\", for instance, the female concubine's name, Philocomasium, translates to \"lover of a good party\"\u2014which is quite apt when we learn about the tricks and wild ways of this prostitute.\nCharacter.\nPlautus' characters\u2014many of which seem to crop up in quite a few of his plays\u2014also came from Greek stock, though they too received some Plautine innovations. Indeed, since Plautus was adapting these plays it would be difficult not to have the same kinds of characters\u2014roles such as slaves, concubines, soldiers, and old men. By working with the characters that were already there but injecting his own creativity, as J. C. B. Lowe wrote in his article \"Aspects of Plautus' Originality in the Asinaria\", \"Plautus could substantially modify the characterization, and thus the whole emphasis of a play.\"\nThe Clever Slave.\nOne of the best examples of this method is the Plautine slave, a form that plays a major role in quite a few of Plautus' works. The \"clever slave\" in particular is a very strong character; he not only provides exposition and humor, but also often drives the plot in Plautus' plays. C. Stace argues that Plautus took the stock slave character from New Comedy in Greece and altered it for his own purposes. In New Comedy, he writes, \"the slave is often not much more than a comedic turn, with the added purpose, perhaps, of exposition\". This shows that there was precedent for this slave archetype, and obviously some of its old role continues in Plautus (the expository monologues, for instance). However, because Plautus found humor in slaves tricking their masters or comparing themselves to great heroes, he took the character a step further and created something distinct.\nUnderstanding of Greek by Plautus' audience.\nOf the approximate 270 proper names in the surviving plays of Plautus, about 250 names are Greek. William M. Seaman proposes that these Greek names would have delivered a comic punch to the audience because of its basic understanding of the Greek language. This previous understanding of Greek language, Seaman suggests, comes from the \"experience of Roman soldiers during the first and second Punic wars. Not only did men billeted in Greek areas have opportunity to learn sufficient Greek for the purpose of everyday conversation, but they were also able to see plays in the foreign tongue.\" Having an audience with knowledge of the Greek language, whether limited or more expanded, allowed Plautus more freedom to use Greek references and words. Also, by using his many Greek references and showing that his plays were originally Greek, \"It is possible that Plautus was in a way a teacher of Greek literature, myth, art and philosophy; so too was he teaching something of the nature of Greek words to people, who, like himself, had recently come into closer contact with that foreign tongue and all its riches.\"\nAt the time of Plautus, Rome was expanding, and having much success in Greece. W.S. Anderson has commented that Plautus \"is using and abusing Greek comedy to imply the superiority of Rome, in all its crude vitality, over the Greek world, which was now the political dependent of Rome, whose effete comic plots helped explain why the Greeks proved inadequate in the real world of the third and second centuries, in which the Romans exercised mastery\".\nDisputed originality.\nPlautus was known for the use of Greek style in his plays, as part of the tradition of the variation on a theme. This has been a point of contention among modern scholars. One argument states that Plautus writes with originality and creativity\u2014the other, that Plautus is a copycat of Greek New Comedy and that he makes no original contribution to playwriting.\nA single reading of the \"Miles Gloriosus\" leaves the reader with the notion that the names, place, and play are all Greek, but one must look beyond these superficial interpretations. W.S. Anderson would steer any reader away from the idea that Plautus' plays are somehow not his own or at least only his interpretation. Anderson says that, \"Plautus homogenizes all the plays as vehicles for his special exploitation. Against the spirit of the Greek original, he engineers events at the end... or alter[s] the situation to fit his expectations.\" Anderson's vehement reaction to the co-opting of Greek plays by Plautus seems to suggest that they are in no way like their originals were. It seems more likely that Plautus was just experimenting putting Roman ideas in Greek forms.\n\"Contaminatio\".\nOne idea that is important to recognize is that of \"contaminatio\", which refers to the mixing of elements of two or more source plays. Plautus, it seems, is quite open to this method of adaptation, and quite a few of his plots seem stitched together from different stories. One excellent example is his \"Bacchides\" and its supposed Greek predecessor, Menander's \"Dis Exapaton.\" The original Greek title translates as \"The Man Deceiving Twice\", yet the Plautine version has three tricks. V. Castellani commented that:\nPlautus' attack on the genre whose material he pirated was, as already stated, fourfold. He deconstructed many of the Greek plays' finely constructed plots; he reduced some, exaggerated others of the nicely drawn characters of Menander and of Menander's contemporaries and followers into caricatures; he substituted for or superimposed upon the elegant humor of his models his own more vigorous, more simply ridiculous foolery in action, in statement, even in language. \nBy exploring ideas about Roman loyalty, Greek deceit, and differences in ethnicity, \"Plautus in a sense surpassed his model.\" He was not content to rest solely on a loyal adaptation that, while amusing, was not new or engaging for Rome. Plautus took what he found but again made sure to expand, subtract, and modify. He seems to have followed the same path that Horace did, though Horace is much later, in that he is putting Roman ideas in Greek forms. He not only imitated the Greeks, but in fact distorted, cut up, and transformed the plays into something entirely Roman. In essence it is Greek theater colonized by Rome and its playwrights.\nStagecraft.\nIn Ancient Greece during the time of New Comedy, from which Plautus drew so much of his inspiration, there were permanent theaters that catered to the audience as well as the actor. The greatest playwrights of the day had quality facilities in which to present their work and, in a general sense, there was always enough public support to keep the theater running and successful. However, this was not the case in Rome during the time of the Republic, when Plautus wrote his plays. While there was public support for theater and people came to enjoy tragedy and comedy alike, no permanent theater existed in Rome until Pompey dedicated one in 55 BC in the Campus Martius.\nThe lack of a permanent space was a key factor in Roman theater and Plautine stagecraft. In their introduction to the \"Miles Gloriosus,\" Hammond, Mack and Moskalew say that \"the Romans were acquainted with the Greek stone theater, but, because they believed drama to be a demoralizing influence, they had a strong aversion to the erection of permanent theaters\". This worry rings true when considering the subject matter of Plautus' plays. The unreal becomes reality on stage in his work. T. J. Moore notes that, \"all distinction between the play, production, and 'real life' has been obliterated [Plautus' play \"Curculio\"]\". A place where social norms were upended was inherently suspect. The aristocracy was afraid of the power of the theater. It was merely by their good graces and unlimited resources that a temporary stage would have been built during specific festivals.\nThe importance of the \"ludi\".\nRoman drama, specifically Plautine comedy, was acted out on stage during the \"ludi\" or festival games. In his discussion of the importance of the \"ludi Megalenses\" in early Roman theater, John Arthur Hanson says that this particular festival \"provided more days for dramatic representations than any of the other regular festivals, and it is in connection with these \"ludi\" that the most definite and secure literary evidence for the site of scenic games has come down to us\". Because the \"ludi\" were religious in nature, it was appropriate for the Romans to set up this temporary stage close to the temple of the deity being celebrated. S.M. Goldberg notes that \"\"ludi\" were generally held within the precinct of the particular god being honored.\"\nT. J. Moore notes that \"seating in the temporary theaters where Plautus' plays were first performed was often insufficient for all those who wished to see the play, that the primary criterion for determining who was to stand and who could sit was social status\". This is not to say that the lower classes did not see the plays; but they probably had to stand while watching. Plays were performed in public, for the public, with the most prominent members of the society in the forefront.\nThe wooden stages on which Plautus' plays appeared were shallow and long with three openings in respect to the scene-house. The stages were significantly smaller than any Greek structure familiar to modern scholars. Because theater was not a priority during Plautus' time, the structures were built and dismantled within a day. Even more practically, they were dismantled quickly due to their potential as fire-hazards.\nGeography of the stage.\nOften the geography of the stage and more importantly the play matched the geography of the city so that the audience would be well oriented to the locale of the play. Moore says that, \"references to Roman locales must have been stunning for they are not merely references to things Roman, but the most blatant possible reminders that the production occurs in the city of Rome\". So, Plautus seems to have choreographed his plays somewhat true-to-life. To do this, he needed his characters to exit and enter to or from whatever area their social standing would befit.\nTwo scholars, V. J. Rosivach and N. E. Andrews, have made interesting observations about stagecraft in Plautus: V. J. Rosivach writes about identifying the side of the stage with both social status and geography. He says that, for example, \"the house of the \"medicus\" lies offstage to the right. It would be in the forum or thereabouts that one would expect to find a \"medicus\".\" Moreover, he says that characters that oppose one another always have to exit in opposite directions. In a slightly different vein, N.E. Andrews discusses the spatial semantics of Plautus; she has observed that even the different spaces of the stage are thematically charged. She states:\nPlautus' \"Casina\" employs these conventional tragic correlations between\nmale/outside and female/inside, but then inverts them in order to establish an even more complex relationship among genre, gender and dramatic space. In the \"Casina\", the struggle for control between men and women... is articulated by characters' efforts to control stage movement into and out of the house.\nAndrews makes note of the fact that power struggle in the \"Casina\" is evident in the verbal comings and goings. The words of action and the way that they are said are important to stagecraft. The words denoting direction or action such as \"abeo\" (\"I go off\"), \"transeo\" (\"I go over\"), \"fores crepuerunt\" (\"the doors creak\"), or \"intus\" (\"inside\"), which signal any character's departure or entrance, are standard in the dialogue of Plautus' plays. These verbs of motion or phrases can be taken as Plautine stage directions since no overt stage directions are apparent. Often, though, in these interchanges of characters, there occurs the need to move on to the next act. Plautus then might use what is known as a \"cover monologue\". About this S.M. Goldberg notes that, \"it marks the passage of time less by its length than by its direct and immediate address to the audience and by its switch from \"senarii\" in the dialogue to \"iambic septenarii\". The resulting shift of mood distracts and distorts our sense of passing time.\"\nRelationship with the audience.\nThe small stages had a significant effect on the stagecraft of ancient Roman theater. Because of this limited space, there was also limited movement. Greek theater allowed for grand gestures and extensive action to reach the audience members who were in the very back of the theater. However the Romans would have had to depend more on their voices than large physicality. There was not an orchestra available as there was for the Greeks and this is reflected in the notable lack of a chorus in Roman drama. The replacement character that acts as the chorus would in Greek drama is often called the \"prologue\".\nGoldberg says that \"these changes fostered a different relationship between actors and the space in which they performed and also between them and their audiences\". Actors were thrust into much closer audience interaction. Because of this, a certain acting style became required that is more familiar to modern audiences. Because they would have been in such close proximity to the actors, ancient Roman audiences would have wanted attention and direct acknowledgement from the actors.\nBecause there was no orchestra, there was no space separating the audience from the stage. The audience could stand directly in front of the elevated wooden platform. This gave them the opportunity to look at the actors from a much different perspective. They would have seen every detail of the actor and heard every word he said. The audience member would have wanted that actor to speak directly to them. It was a part of the thrill of the performance, as it is to this day.\nStock characters.\nPlautus' range of characters was created through his use of various techniques, but probably the most important is his use of stock characters and situations in his various plays. He incorporates the same stock characters constantly, especially when the character type is amusing to the audience. As Walter Juniper wrote, \"Everything, including artistic characterization and consistency of characterization, were sacrificed to humor, and character portrayal remained only where it was necessary for the success of the plot and humor to have a \"persona\" who stayed in character, and where the \"persona\" by his portrayal contributed to humor.\"\nFor example, in \" Miles Gloriosus\", the titular \"braggart soldier\" Pyrgopolynices only shows his vain and immodest side in the first act, while the parasite Artotrogus exaggerates Pyrgopolynices' achievements, creating more and more ludicrous claims that Pyrgopolynices agrees to without question. These two are perfect examples of the stock characters of the pompous soldier and the desperate parasite that appeared in Plautine comedies. In disposing of highly complex individuals, Plautus was supplying his audience with what it wanted, since \"the audience to whose tastes Plautus catered was not interested in the character play,\" but instead wanted the broad and accessible humor offered by stock set-ups. The humor Plautus offered, such as \"puns, word plays, distortions of meaning, or other forms of verbal humor he usually puts them in the mouths of characters belonging to the lower social ranks, to whose language and position these varieties of humorous technique are most suitable,\" matched well with the stable of characters.\nThe clever slave.\nIn his article \"The Intriguing Slave in Greek Comedy,\" Philip Harsh gives evidence to show that the clever slave is not an invention of Plautus. While previous critics such as A. W. Gomme believed that the slave was \"[a] truly comic character, the devisor of ingenious schemes, the controller of events, the commanding officer of his young master and friends, is a creation of Latin comedy,\" and that Greek dramatists such as Menander did not use slaves in such a way that Plautus later did, Harsh refutes these beliefs by giving concrete examples of instances where a clever slave appeared in Greek comedy. For instance, in the works of Athenaeus, Alciphron, and Lucian there are deceptions that involve the aid of a slave, and in Menander's \"Dis Exapaton\" there was an elaborate deception executed by a clever slave that Plautus mirrors in his \"Bacchides\". Evidence of clever slaves also appears in Menander's \"Thalis\", \"Hypobolimaios\", and from the papyrus fragment of his \"Perinthia\". Harsh acknowledges that Gomme's statement was probably made before the discovery of many of the papyri that we now have. While it was not necessarily a Roman invention, Plautus did develop his own style of depicting the clever slave. With larger, more active roles, more verbal exaggeration and exuberance, the slave was moved by Plautus further into the front of the action. Because of the inversion of order created by a devious or witty slave, this stock character was perfect for achieving a humorous response and the traits of the character worked well for driving the plot forward.\nThe lustful old man.\nAnother important Plautine stock character, discussed by K.C. Ryder, is the \"senex amator\". A senex amator is classified as an old man who contracts a passion for a young girl and who, in varying degrees, attempts to satisfy this passion. In Plautus these men are Demaenetus (\"Asinaria\"), Philoxenus and Nicobulus (\"Bacchides\"), Demipho (\"Cistellaria\"), Lysidamus (\"Casina\"), Demipho (\"Mercator\"), and Antipho (\"Stichus\"). Periplectomenos (\"Miles Gloriosus\") and Daemones (\"Rudens\") are regarded as \"senes lepidi\" because they usually keep their feelings within a respectable limit. All of these characters have the same goal, to be with a younger woman, but all go about it in different ways, as Plautus could not be too redundant with his characters despite their already obvious similarities. What they have in common is the ridicule with which their attempts are viewed, the imagery that suggests that they are motivated largely by animal passion, the childish behavior, and the reversion to the love-language of their youth.\nFemale characters.\nIn examining the female role designations of Plautus's plays, Z.M. Packman found that they are not as stable as their male counterparts: a \"senex\" will usually remain a \"senex\" for the duration of the play but designations like \"matrona\", \"mulier\", or \"uxor\" at times seem interchangeable. Most free adult women, married or widowed, appear in scene headings as \"mulier\", simply translated as \"woman\". But in Plautus' \"Stichus\" the two young women are referred to as \"sorores\", later \"mulieres\", and then \"matronae\", all of which have different meanings and connotations. Although there are these discrepancies, Packman tries to give a pattern to the female role designations of Plautus. \"Mulier\" is typically given to a woman of citizen class and of marriageable age or who has already been married. Unmarried citizen-class girls, regardless of sexual experience, were designated \"virgo\". \"Ancilla\" was the term used for female household slaves, with \"Anus\" reserved for the elderly household slaves. A young woman who is unwed due to social status is usually referred to as \"meretrix\" or \"courtesan\". A \"lena\", or adoptive mother, may be a woman who owns these girls.\nUnnamed characters.\nLike Packman, George Duckworth uses the scene headings in the manuscripts to support his theory about unnamed Plautine characters. There are approximately 220 characters in the 20 plays of Plautus. Thirty are unnamed in both the scene headings and the text and there are about nine characters who are named in the ancient text but not in any modern one. This means that about 18% of the total number of characters in Plautus are nameless. Most of the very important characters have names while most of the unnamed characters are of less importance. However, there are some abnormalities\u2014the main character in \"Casina\" is not mentioned by name anywhere in the text. In other instances, Plautus will give a name to a character that only has a few words or lines. One explanation is that some of the names have been lost over the years; and for the most part, major characters do have names.\nLanguage and style.\nOverview.\nPlautus wrote in a colloquial style far from the codified form of Latin that is found in Ovid or Virgil. This colloquial style is the everyday speech that Plautus would have been familiar with, yet that means that most students of Latin are unfamiliar with it. Adding to the unfamiliarity of Plautine language is the inconsistency of the irregularities that occur in the texts. In one of his studies, A.W. Hodgman noted that:\nthe statements that one meets with, that this or that form is \"common,\" or \"regular,\" in Plautus, are frequently misleading, or even incorrect, and are usually unsatisfying... I have gained an increasing respect for the manuscript tradition, a growing belief that the irregularities are, after all, in a certain sense regular. The whole system of inflexion\u2014and, I suspect, of syntax also and of versification\u2014was less fixed and stable in Plautus' time than it became later.\nArchaic features.\nThe diction of Plautus, who used the colloquial speech of his own day, is distinctive and non-standard from the point of view of the later, classical period. M. Hammond, A.H. Mack, and W. Moskalew have noted in the introduction to their edition of the \"Miles Gloriosus\" that Plautus was \"free from convention... [and] sought to reproduce the easy tone of daily speech rather than the formal regularity of oratory or poetry. Hence, many of the irregularities which have troubled scribes and scholars perhaps merely reflect the everyday usages of the careless and untrained tongues which Plautus heard about him.\" Looking at the overall use of archaic forms in Plautus, one notes that they commonly occur in promises, agreements, threats, prologues, or speeches. Plautus's archaic forms are metrically convenient, but may also have had a stylistic effect on his original audience.\nThese forms are frequent and of too great a number for a complete list here, but some of the most noteworthy features which from the classical perspective will be considered irregular or obsolete are:\nThese are the most common linguistic peculiarities (from the later perspective) in the plays of Plautus, some of them being also found in Terence, and noting them helps in the reading of his works and gives insight into early Roman language and interaction.\nMeans of expression.\nThere are certain ways in which Plautus expressed himself in his plays, and these individual means of expression give a certain flair to his style of writing. The means of expression are not always specific to the writer, i.e., idiosyncratic, yet they are characteristic of the writer. Two examples of these characteristic means of expression are the use of proverbs and the use of Greek language in the plays of Plautus.\nPlautus employed the use of proverbs in many of his plays. Proverbs would address a certain genre such as law, religion, medicine, trades, crafts, and seafaring. Plautus' proverbs and proverbial expressions number into the hundreds. They sometimes appear alone or interwoven within a speech. The most common appearance of proverbs in Plautus appears to be at the end of a soliloquy. Plautus does this for dramatic effect to emphasize a point.\nFurther interwoven into the plays of Plautus and just as common as the use of proverbs is the use of Greek within the texts of the plays. J. N. Hough suggests that Plautus's use of Greek is for artistic purposes and not simply because a Latin phrase will not fit the meter. Greek words are used when describing foods, oils, perfumes, etc. This is similar to the use of French terms in the English language such as \"gar\u00e7on\" or \"rendezvous\". These words give the language a French flair just as Greek did to the Latin-speaking Romans. Slaves or characters of low standing speak much of the Greek. One possible explanation for this is that many Roman slaves were foreigners of Greek origin.\nPlautus would sometimes incorporate passages in other languages as well in places where it would suit his characters. A noteworthy example is the use of two prayers in Punic in \"Poenulus\", spoken by the Carthaginian elder Hanno, which are significant to Semitic linguistics because they preserve the Carthaginian pronunciation of the vowels. Unlike Greek, Plautus most probably did not speak Punic himself, nor was the audience likely to understand it. The text of the prayers themselves was probably provided by a Carthaginian informant, and Plautus incorporated it to emphasize the authenticity and foreignness of Hanno's character.\nPoetic devices.\nPlautus also used more technical means of expression in his plays. One tool that Plautus used for the expression of his \"servus callidus\" stock character was alliteration. Alliteration is the repetition of sounds in a sentence or clause; those sounds usually come at the beginning of words. In the \"Miles Gloriosus,\" the \"servus callidus\" is Palaestrio. As he speaks with the character, Periplectomenus, he uses a significant amount of alliteration in order to assert his cleverness and, therefore, his authority. Plautus uses phrases such as \"falsiloquom, falsicum, falsiiurium\" (\"MG\" l. 191). These words express the deep and respectable knowledge that Palaestrio has of the Latin language. Alliteration can also happen at the endings of words as well. For example, Palaestrio says, \"linguam, perfidiam, malitiam atque audaciam, confidentiam,\nconfirmitatem, fraudulentiam\" (\"MG\" ll. 188\u20139). Also used, as seen above, is the technique of\nassonance, which is the repetition of similar-sounding syllables.\nJokes and wordplay.\nPlautus' comedies abound in puns and word play, which is an important component of his poetry. One well known instance in the \"Miles Gloriosus\" is Sceledre, \"scelus.\" Some examples stand in the text in order to accentuate and emphasize whatever is being said, and others to elevate the artistry of the language. But a great number are made for jokes, especially riddle jokes, which feature a \"knock knock - who's there?\" pattern. Plautus is especially fond of making up and changing the meaning of words, as Shakespeare does later.\nMeter.\nFurther emphasizing and elevating the artistry of the language of the plays of Plautus is the use of meter, which simply put is the rhythm of the play. There seems to be great debate over whether Plautus found favour in strong word accent or verse ictus, stress. Plautus did not follow the meter of the Greek originals that he adapted for the Roman audience. Plautus used a great number of meters, but most frequently he used the iambic senarius and the trochaic septenarius. G. B. Conte has noted that Plautus favours the use of \"cantica\" instead of Greek meters.\nVigor and immediacy.\nThe \"servus callidus\" functions as the exposition in many of Plautus' plays. According to C. Stace, \"slaves in Plautus account for almost twice as much monologue as any other character ... [and] this is a significant statistic; most of the monologues being, as they are, for purposes of humor, moralizing, or exposition of some kind, we can now begin to see the true nature of the slave's importance.\" Because humor, vulgarity, and \"incongruity\" are so much a part of the Plautine comedies, the slave becomes the essential tool to connect the audience to the \"joke\" through his monologue and direct connection \"to\" the audience. He is, then, not only a source for exposition and understanding, but connection\u2014specifically, connection to the humor of the play, the playfulness of the play. The \"servus callidus\" is a character that, as McCarthy says, \"draws the complete attention of the audience, and, according to C. Stace, 'despite his lies and abuse, claims our complete sympathy'\". He does this, according to some scholarship, using monologue, the imperative mood and alliteration\u2014all of which are specific and effective linguistic tools in both writing and speaking.\nThe specific type of monologue (or soliloquy) in which a Plautine slave engages is the \"prologue\". As opposed to simple exposition, according to N. W. Slater, \"these ... prologues ... have a far more important function than merely to provide information.\" Another way in which the \"servus callidus\" asserts his power over the play\u2014specifically the other characters in the play\u2014is through his use of the imperative mood. This type of language is used, according to E. Segal, for \"the forceful inversion, the reduction of the master to an abject position of supplication ... the master-as-suppliant is thus an extremely important feature of the Plautine comic finale\". The imperative mood is therefore used in the complete role-reversal of the normal relationship between slave and master, and \"those who enjoy authority and respect in the ordinary Roman world are unseated, ridiculed, while the lowliest members of society mount to their pedestals ... the humble are in fact exalted\".\nFood.\nMeat is the most commonly mentioned foodstuff in the plays of Plautus, and where a specific meat is mentioned, it is most commonly pork, followed by fish.\nInfluence.\nIntellectual and academic critics have often judged Plautus's work as crude; yet his influence on later literature is impressive\u2014especially on two literary giants, Shakespeare and Moli\u00e8re.\nPlaywrights throughout history have looked to Plautus for character, plot, humor, and other elements of comedy. His influence ranges from similarities in idea to full literal translations woven into plays. The playwright's apparent familiarity with the absurdity of humanity and both the comedy and tragedy that stem from this absurdity have inspired succeeding playwrights centuries after his death. The most famous of these successors is Shakespeare\u2014Plautus had a major influence on his early comedies.\nThe Middle Ages and early Renaissance.\nPlautus was apparently read in the 9th century. His form was too complex to be fully understood, however, and, as indicated by the \"Terentius et delusor\", it was unknown at the time if Plautus was writing in prose or verse.\nW. B. Sedgwick has provided a record of the \"Amphitruo\", perennially one of Plautus' most famous works. It was the most popular Plautine play in the Middle Ages, and publicly performed at the Renaissance; it was the first Plautine play to be translated into English.\nThe influence of Plautus's plays was felt in the early 16th century. Limited records suggest that the first known university production of Plautus in England was of \"Miles Gloriosus\" at Oxford in 1522\u20133. The \"magnum jornale\" of Queens College contains a reference to a \"comoedia Plauti\" in either 1522 or 1523. This fits directly with comments made in the poems of Leland about the date of the production. The next production of \"Miles Gloriosus\" that is known from limited records was given by the Westminster School in 1564. Other records also tell us about performances of the \"Menaechmi\". From our knowledge, performances were given in the house of Cardinal Wolsey by boys of St. Paul's School as early as 1527.\nShakespeare.\nShakespeare borrowed from Plautus as Plautus borrowed from his Greek models. According to C. L. Barber, \"Shakespeare feeds Elizabethan life into the mill of Roman farce, life realized with his distinctively generous creativity, very different from Plautus' tough, narrow, resinous genius\".\nThe Plautine and Shakespearean plays that most parallel each other are, respectively, the \"Menaechmi\" and \"The Comedy of Errors\". According to Marples, Shakespeare drew directly from Plautus \"parallels in plot, in incident, and in character\", and was undeniably influenced by the classical playwright's work. H. A. Watt stresses the importance of recognizing the fact that the \"two plays were written under conditions entirely different and served audiences as remote as the poles\".\nThe differences between the \"Menaechmi\" and \"The Comedy of Errors\" are clear. In the \"Menaechmi\", Plautus uses only one set of twins\u2014twin brothers. Shakespeare, on the other hand, uses two sets of twins, which, according to William Connolly, \"dilutes the force of [Shakespeare's] situations\". One suggestion is that Shakespeare got this idea from Plautus' \"Amphitruo\", in which both twin masters and twin slaves appear.\nIt can be noted that the doubling is a stock situation of Elizabethan comedy. On the fusion between Elizabethan and Plautine techniques, T. W. Baldwin writes: \"[...] \"Errors\" does not have the miniature unity of \"Menaechmi,\" which is characteristic of classic structure for comedy\". Baldwin notes that Shakespeare covers a much greater area in the structure of the play than Plautus does. Shakespeare was writing for an audience whose minds weren't restricted to house and home, but looked toward the greater world beyond and the role that they might play in that world.\nAnother difference between the audiences of Shakespeare and Plautus is that Shakespeare's audience was Christian. At the end of \"Errors\", the world of the play is returned to normal when a Christian abbess interferes with the feuding. \"Menaechmi\", on the other hand, \"is almost completely lacking in a supernatural dimension\". A character in Plautus' play would never blame an inconvenient situation on witchcraft\u2014something that is quite common in Shakespeare.\nThe relationship between a master and a clever servant is also a common element in Elizabethan comedy. Shakespeare often includes foils for his characters to have one set off the other. In Elizabethan romantic comedy, it is common for the plays to end with multiple marriages and couplings of pairs. This is something that is not seen in Plautine comedy. In the \"Comedy of Errors\", Aegeon and Aemilia are separated, Antipholus and Adriana are at odds, and Antipholus and Luciana have not yet met. At the end, all the couples are happily together. By writing his comedies in a combination of Elizabethan and Plautine styles, Shakespeare helps to create his own brand of comedy, one that uses both styles.\nAlso, Shakespeare uses the same kind of opening monologue so common in Plautus' plays. He even uses a \"villain\" in \"The Comedy of Errors\" of the same type as the one in \"Menaechmi\", switching the character from a doctor to a teacher but keeping the character a shrewd, educated man. Watt also notes that some of these elements appear in many of his works, such as \"Twelfth Night\" or \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\", and had a deep impact on Shakespeare's writing.\nLater playwrights also borrowed Plautus' stock characters. One of the most important echoes of Plautus is the stock character of the parasite. The best example of this is Falstaff, Shakespeare's portly and cowardly knight. As J. W. Draper notes, the gluttonous Falstaff shares many characteristics with a parasite such as Artotrogus from \"Miles Gloriosus\". Both characters seem fixated on food and where their next meal is coming from. But they also rely on flattery in order to gain these gifts, and both characters are willing to bury their patrons in empty praise. Draper notes that Falstaff is also something of a boastful military man, but says: \"Falstaff is so complex a character that he may well be, in effect, a combination of interlocking types\".\nAs well as appearing in Shakespearean comedy, the Plautine parasite appears in one of the first English comedies. In \"Ralph Roister Doister\", the character of Matthew Merrygreeke follows in the tradition of both Plautine parasite and Plautine slave, as he both searches and grovels for food and also attempts to achieve his master's desires. Indeed, the play itself is often seen as borrowing heavily from or even being based on the Plautine comedy \"Miles Gloriosus\".\nH. W. Cole discusses the influence of Plautus and Terence on the Stonyhurst Pageants. The Stonyhurst Pageants are manuscripts of Old Testament plays that were probably composed after 1609 in Lancashire. Cole focuses on Plautus' influence on the particular Pageant of Naaman. The playwright of this pageant breaks away from the traditional style of religious medieval drama and relies heavily on the works of Plautus. Overall, the playwright cross-references eighteen of the twenty surviving plays of Plautus and five of the six extant plays by Terence. It is clear that the author of the Stonyhurst Pageant of Naaman had a great knowledge of Plautus and was significantly influenced by this.\nThere is evidence of Plautine imitation in Edwardes' \"Damon and Pythias\" and Heywood's \"Silver Age\" as well as in Shakespeare's \"Errors\". Heywood sometimes translated whole passages of Plautus. By being translated as well as imitated, Plautus was a major influence on comedy of the Elizabethan era.\nIn terms of plot, or perhaps more accurately plot device, Plautus served as a source of inspiration and also provided the possibility of adaptation for later playwrights.\nMoli\u00e8re.\nMoli\u00e8re is no less inspired, openly drawing for instance from the eloquence of Palaestrio in \"Miles Gloriosus\" for the quick-witted servants and maids of \"The Miser\" and \"The Blunderer\": the same schemes, the same ruses that sustain the momentum and drive the plays toward their resolution.\nThe many deceits that Plautus layered his plays with, giving the audience the feeling of a genre bordering on farce, appear in much of the comedy written by Shakespeare and Moli\u00e8re. For instance, the clever slave has important roles in both \"L'Avare\" and \"L'Etourdi\", two plays by Moli\u00e8re, and in both drives the plot and creates the ruse just like Palaestrio in \"Miles Gloriosus.\" These similar characters set up the same kind of deceptions in which many of Plautus' plays find their driving force, which is not a simple coincidence.\nFor \"The Miser\", Moli\u00e8re directly draws from \"Aulularia\", adopting the same plot (a stolen sum of money) while Harpagon mirrors the character of Euclio. Their words are nearly identical: \"Quo curram? quo non curram?\" (line 713, \"Where shall I run? Where shall I not run?\") becomes \"O\u00f9 courir? O\u00f9 ne pas courir?\" (Act IV, Scene 7).\nLater periods.\n20th century musicals based on Plautus include \"A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum\" (Larry Gelbart and Burt Shevelove, book, Stephen Sondheim, music and lyrics).\n\"Roman Laughter: The Comedy of Plautus\", a 1968 book by Erich Segal, is a scholarly study of Plautus' work.\nThe British TV sitcom \"Up Pompeii!\" uses situations and stock characters from Plautus's plays. In the first series Willie Rushton plays Plautus who pops up on occasion to provide comic comments on what is going on in the episode.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "24172", "revid": "48643156", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24172", "title": "Pythagorean triple", "text": "Integer side lengths of a right triangle\nA Pythagorean triple consists of three positive integers \"a\", \"b\", and \"c\", such that \"a\"2 + \"b\"2 = \"c\"2. Such a triple is commonly written (\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"), a well-known example is (3, 4, 5). If (\"a\", \"b\", \"c\") is a Pythagorean triple, then so is (\"ka\", \"kb\", \"kc\") for any positive integer \"k\". A triangle whose side lengths are a Pythagorean triple is a right triangle and called a Pythagorean triangle.\nA primitive Pythagorean triple is one in which \"a\", \"b\" and \"c\" are coprime (that is, they have no common divisor larger than 1). For example, (3, 4, 5) is a primitive Pythagorean triple whereas (6, 8, 10) is not. Every Pythagorean triple can be scaled to a unique primitive Pythagorean triple by dividing (\"a\", \"b\", \"c\") by their greatest common divisor. Conversely, every Pythagorean triple can be obtained by multiplying the elements of a primitive Pythagorean triple by a positive integer (the same for the three elements).\nThe name is derived from the Pythagorean theorem, stating that every right triangle has side lengths satisfying the formula formula_1; thus, Pythagorean triples describe the three integer side lengths of a right triangle. However, right triangles with non-integer sides do not form Pythagorean triples. For instance, the triangle with sides formula_2 and formula_3 is a right triangle, but formula_4 is not a Pythagorean triple because the square root of 2 is not an integer. Moreover, formula_5 and formula_6 do not have an integer common multiple because formula_6 is irrational.\nPythagorean triples have been known since ancient times. The oldest known record comes from Plimpton 322, a Babylonian clay tablet from about 1800 BC, written in a sexagesimal number system.\nWhen searching for integer solutions, the equation \"a\"2 + \"b\"2 = \"c\"2 is a Diophantine equation. Thus Pythagorean triples are among the oldest known solutions of a nonlinear Diophantine equation.\nExamples.\nThere are 16 primitive Pythagorean triples of numbers up to 100:\nOther small Pythagorean triples such as (6, 8, 10) are not listed because they are not primitive; for instance (6, 8, 10) is a multiple of (3, 4, 5).\nEach of these points (with their multiples) forms a radiating line in the scatter plot to the right.\nThese are the remaining primitive Pythagorean triples of numbers up to 300:\nGenerating a triple.\nEuclid's formula is a fundamental formula for generating Pythagorean triples given an arbitrary pair of integers \"m\" and \"n\" with \"m\" &gt; \"n\" &gt; 0. The formula states that the integers\nformula_8\nform a Pythagorean triple. For example, the integers\nformula_9\ngenerate the primitive triple (3, 4, 5):\nformula_10\nThe triple generated by Euclid's formula is primitive if and only if \"m\" and \"n\" are coprime and exactly one of them is even. When both \"m\" and \"n\" are odd, then \"a\", \"b\", and \"c\" will be even, and the triple will not be primitive; however, dividing \"a\", \"b\", and \"c\" by 2 will yield a primitive triple when \"m\" and \"n\" are coprime.\nEvery primitive triple arises (after the exchange of \"a\" and \"b\", if \"a\" is even) from a unique pair of coprime numbers \"m\", \"n\", one of which is even. It follows that there are infinitely many primitive Pythagorean triples. This relationship of \"a\", \"b\" and \"c\" to \"m\" and \"n\" from Euclid's formula is referenced throughout the rest of this article.\nDespite generating all primitive triples, Euclid's formula does not produce all triples\u2014for example, (9, 12, 15) cannot be generated using integer \"m\" and \"n\". This can be remedied by inserting an additional parameter \"k\" to the formula: every Pythagorean triple is generated uniquely by\nformula_11\nwhere \"m\", \"n\", and \"k\" are positive integers with \"m\" &gt; \"n\", and with \"m\" and \"n\" coprime and not both odd.\nThat these formulas generate Pythagorean triples can be verified by expanding \"a\"2 + \"b\"2 using elementary algebra and verifying that the result equals \"c\"2. Since every Pythagorean triple can be divided through by some integer \"k\" to obtain a primitive triple, every triple can be generated uniquely by using the formula with \"m\" and \"n\" to generate its primitive counterpart and then multiplying through by \"k\" as in the last equation.\nChoosing \"m\" and \"n\" from certain integer sequences gives interesting results. For example, if \"m\" and \"n\" are consecutive Pell numbers, \"a\" and \"b\" will differ by 1.\nMany formulas for generating triples with particular properties have been developed since the time of Euclid.\nProof of Euclid's formula.\nThat satisfaction of Euclid's formula by \"a, b, c\" is sufficient for the triangle to be Pythagorean is apparent from the fact that for positive integers \"m\" and \"n\", \"m\" &gt; \"n\", the \"a\", \"b\", and \"c\" given by the formula are all positive integers, and from the fact that\nformula_12\nA proof of the \"necessity\" that \"a, b, c\" be expressed by Euclid's formula for any primitive Pythagorean triple is as follows. All such primitive triples can be written as (\"a\", \"b\", \"c\") where \"a\"2 + \"b\"2 = \"c\"2 and \"a\", \"b\", \"c\" are coprime. Thus \"a\", \"b\", \"c\" are pairwise coprime (if a prime number divided two of them, it would be forced also to divide the third one). As \"a\" and \"b\" are coprime, at least one of them is odd. If we suppose that \"a\" is odd, then \"b\" is even and \"c\" is odd (if both \"a\" and \"b\" were odd, \"c\" would be even, and \"c\"2 would be a multiple of 4, while \"a\"2 + \"b\"2 would be congruent to 2 modulo 4, as an odd square is congruent to 1 modulo 4).\nFrom formula_13 assume \"a\" is odd. We obtain formula_14 and hence formula_15 Then formula_16 Since formula_17 is rational, we set it equal to formula_18 in lowest terms. Thus formula_19 being the reciprocal of formula_20 Then solving\nformula_21\nfor formula_22 and formula_23 gives\nformula_24\nAs formula_18 is fully reduced, \"m\" and \"n\" are coprime, and they cannot both be even. If they were both odd, the numerator of formula_26 would be a multiple of 4 (because an odd square is congruent to 1 modulo 4), and the denominator 2\"mn\" would not be a multiple of 4. Since 4 would be the minimum possible even factor in the numerator and 2 would be the maximum possible even factor in the denominator, this would imply \"a\" to be even despite defining it as odd. Thus one of \"m\" and \"n\" is odd and the other is even, and the numerators of the two fractions with denominator 2\"mn\" are odd. Thus these fractions are fully reduced (an odd prime dividing this denominator divides one of \"m\" and \"n\" but not the other; thus it does not divide \"m\"2 \u00b1 \"n\"2). One may thus equate numerators with numerators and denominators with denominators, giving Euclid's formula \nformula_27 with \"m\" and \"n\" coprime and of opposite parities.\nA longer but more commonplace proof is given in Maor (2007) and Sierpi\u0144ski (2003). Another proof is given in , as an instance of a general method that applies to every homogeneous Diophantine equation of degree two.\nInterpretation of parameters in Euclid's formula.\nSuppose the sides of a Pythagorean triangle have lengths \"m\"2 \u2212 \"n\"2, 2\"mn\", and \"m\"2 + \"n\"2, and suppose the angle between the leg of length \"m\"2 \u2212 \"n\"2 and the hypotenuse of length \"m\"2 + \"n\"2 is denoted as \"\u03b2\". Then formula_28 and the full-angle trigonometric values are formula_29, formula_30, and &amp;NoBreak;}&amp;NoBreak;.\nA variant.\nThe following variant of Euclid's formula is sometimes more convenient, as being more symmetric in \"m\" and \"n\" (same parity condition on m and n).\nIf \"m\" and \"n\" are two odd integers such that \"m\" &gt; \"n\", then\nformula_31\nare three integers that form a Pythagorean triple, which is primitive if and only if \"m\" and \"n\" are coprime. Conversely, every primitive Pythagorean triple arises (after the exchange of \"a\" and \"b\", if \"a\" is even) from a unique pair \"m\" &gt; \"n\" &gt; 0 of coprime odd integers.\nNot exchanging \"a\" and \"b\".\nIn the presentation above, it is said that all Pythagorean triples are uniquely obtained from Euclid's formula \"after the exchange of \"a\" and \"b\", if \"a\" is even\". Euclid's formula and the variant above can be merged as follows to avoid this exchange, leading to the following result.\nEvery primitive Pythagorean triple can be uniquely written\nformula_32\nwhere m and n are positive coprime integers, and formula_33 if m and n are both odd, and formula_34 otherwise. Equivalently, formula_33 if a is odd, and formula_34 if a is even.\nElementary properties of primitive Pythagorean triples.\nGeneral properties.\nThe properties of a primitive Pythagorean triple (\"a\", \"b\", \"c\") with \"a\" &lt; \"b\" &lt; \"c\" (without specifying which of \"a\" or \"b\" is even and which is odd) include:\n formula_44\nSpecial cases.\nIn addition, special Pythagorean triples with certain additional properties can be guaranteed to exist:\nGeometry of Euclid's formula.\nRational points on a unit circle.\nEuclid's formula for a Pythagorean triple\nformula_47\ncan be understood in terms of the geometry of rational points on the unit circle .\nIn fact, a point in the Cartesian plane with coordinates (\"x\", \"y\") belongs to the unit circle if \"x\"2 + \"y\"2 \n 1. The point is \"rational\" if \"x\" and \"y\" are rational numbers, that is, if there are coprime integers \"a\", \"b\", \"c\" such that \nformula_48\nBy multiplying both members by \"c\"2, one can see that the rational points on the circle are in one-to-one correspondence with the primitive Pythagorean triples.\nThe unit circle may also be defined by a parametric equation\nformula_49\nEuclid's formula for Pythagorean triples and the inverse relationship \"t\" = \"y\" / (1 + \"x\") mean that, except for (\u22121, 0), a point (\"x\", \"y\") on the circle is rational if and only if the corresponding value of \"t\" is a rational number. Note that \"t\" = \"y\" / (1 + \"x\") = \"b\" / (\"c\" + \"a\") = \"n\" / \"m\" is also the tangent of half of the angle that is opposite the triangle side of length b.\nStereographic approach.\nThere is a correspondence between points on the unit circle with rational coordinates and primitive Pythagorean triples. At this point, Euclid's formulae can be derived either by methods of trigonometry or equivalently by using the stereographic projection.\nFor the stereographic approach, suppose that \"P\"\u2032 is a point on the \"x\"-axis with rational coordinates\nformula_50\nThen, it can be shown by basic algebra that the point \"P\" has coordinates\nformula_51\nThis establishes that each rational point of the \"x\"-axis goes over to a rational point of the unit circle. The converse, that every rational point of the unit circle comes from such a point of the \"x\"-axis, follows by applying the inverse stereographic projection. Suppose that \"P\"(\"x\", \"y\") is a point of the unit circle with \"x\" and \"y\" rational numbers. Then the point \"P\"\u2032 obtained by stereographic projection onto the \"x\"-axis has coordinates\nformula_52\nwhich is rational.\nIn terms of algebraic geometry, the algebraic variety of rational points on the unit circle is birational to the affine line over the rational numbers. The unit circle is thus called a rational curve, and it is this fact which enables an explicit parameterization of the (rational number) points on it by means of rational functions.\nPythagorean triangles in a 2D lattice.\nA 2D lattice is a regular array of isolated points where if any one point is chosen as the Cartesian origin (0, 0), then all the other points are at (\"x\", \"y\") where \"x\" and \"y\" range over all positive and negative integers. Any Pythagorean triangle with triple (\"a\", \"b\", \"c\") can be drawn within a 2D lattice with vertices at coordinates (0, 0), (\"a\", 0) and (0, \"b\"). The count of lattice points lying strictly within the bounds of the triangle is given by\u00a0\u00a0 formula_53 for primitive Pythagorean triples this interior lattice count is\u00a0\u00a0formula_54 The area (by Pick's theorem equal to one less than the interior lattice count plus half the boundary lattice count) equals\u00a0\u00a0formula_55\u00a0.\nThe first occurrence of two primitive Pythagorean triples sharing the same area occurs with triangles with sides (20, 21, 29), (12, 35, 37) and common area 210\u00a0(sequence in the OEIS). The first occurrence of two primitive Pythagorean triples sharing the same interior lattice count occurs with (18108, 252685, 253333), (28077, 162964, 165365) and interior lattice count 2287674594\u00a0(sequence in the OEIS). Three primitive Pythagorean triples have been found sharing the same area: (4485, 5852, 7373), (3059, 8580, 9109), (1380, 19019, 19069) with area 13123110. As yet, no set of three primitive Pythagorean triples have been found sharing the same interior lattice count.\nEnumeration of primitive Pythagorean triples.\nBy Euclid's formula all primitive Pythagorean triples can be generated from integers formula_56 and formula_57 with formula_58, formula_59 odd and formula_60 Hence there is a 1 to 1 mapping of rationals (in lowest terms) to primitive Pythagorean triples where formula_61 is in the interval formula_62 and formula_59 odd.\nThe reverse mapping from a primitive triple formula_64 where formula_65 to a rational formula_61 is achieved by studying the two sums formula_67 and formula_68 One of these sums will be a square that can be equated to formula_69 and the other will be twice a square that can be equated to formula_70 It is then possible to determine the rational formula_71\nIn order to enumerate primitive Pythagorean triples the rational can be expressed as an ordered pair formula_72 and mapped to an integer using a pairing function such as Cantor's pairing function. An example can be seen at (sequence in the OEIS). It begins\nformula_73 and gives rationals\nformula_74 these, in turn, generate primitive triples\nformula_75\nSpinors and the modular group.\nPythagorean triples can likewise be encoded into a square matrix of the form\nformula_76\nA matrix of this form is symmetric. Furthermore, the determinant of \"X\" is\nformula_77\nwhich is zero precisely when (\"a\",\"b\",\"c\") is a Pythagorean triple. If \"X\" corresponds to a Pythagorean triple, then as a matrix it must have rank 1.\nSince \"X\" is symmetric, it follows from a result in linear algebra that there is a column vector \"\u03be\" \n [\"m\" \"n\"]T such that the outer product\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Numbered block/styles.css\" /&gt;\nholds, where the \"T\" denotes the matrix transpose. Since \u03be and -\u03be produce the same Pythagorean triple, the vector \u03be can be considered a spinor (for the Lorentz group SO(1, 2)). In abstract terms, the Euclid formula means that each primitive Pythagorean triple can be written as the outer product with itself of a spinor with integer entries, as in (1).\nThe modular group \u0393 is the set of 2\u00d72 matrices with integer entries\nformula_78\nwith determinant equal to one: \"\u03b1\u03b4\" \u2212 \"\u03b2\u03b3\" \n 1. This set forms a group, since the inverse of a matrix in \u0393 is again in \u0393, as is the product of two matrices in \u0393. The modular group acts on the collection of all integer spinors. Furthermore, the group is transitive on the collection of integer spinors with relatively prime entries. For if [\"m\" \"n\"]T has relatively prime entries, then\nformula_79\nwhere \"u\" and \"v\" are selected (by the Euclidean algorithm) so that \"mu\" + \"nv\" \n 1.\nBy acting on the spinor \u03be in (1), the action of \u0393 goes over to an action on Pythagorean triples, provided one allows for triples with possibly negative components. Thus if \"A\" is a matrix in \u0393, then\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Numbered block/styles.css\" /&gt;\ngives rise to an action on the matrix \"X\" in (1). This does not give a well-defined action on primitive triples, since it may take a primitive triple to an imprimitive one. It is convenient at this point (per ) to call a triple (\"a\",\"b\",\"c\") standard if \"c\" &gt; 0 and either (\"a\",\"b\",\"c\") are relatively prime or (\"a\"/2,\"b\"/2,\"c\"/2) are relatively prime with \"a\"/2 odd. If the spinor [\"m\" \"n\"]T has relatively prime entries, then the associated triple (\"a\",\"b\",\"c\") determined by (1) is a standard triple. It follows that the action of the modular group is transitive on the set of standard triples.\nAlternatively, restrict attention to those values of \"m\" and \"n\" for which \"m\" is odd and \"n\" is even. Let the subgroup \u0393(2) of \u0393 be the kernel of the group homomorphism\nformula_80\nwhere SL(2,Z2) is the special linear group over the finite field Z2 of integers modulo 2. Then \u0393(2) is the group of unimodular transformations which preserve the parity of each entry. Thus if the first entry of \u03be is odd and the second entry is even, then the same is true of \"A\"\u03be for all \"A\" \u2208 \u0393(2). In fact, under the action (2), the group \u0393(2) acts transitively on the collection of primitive Pythagorean triples .\nThe group \u0393(2) is the free group whose generators are the matrices\nformula_81\nConsequently, every primitive Pythagorean triple can be obtained in a unique way as a product of copies of the matrices \"U\" and\u00a0\"L\".\nParent/child relationships.\nBy a result of , all primitive Pythagorean triples can be generated from the (3, 4, 5) triangle by using the three linear transformations T1, T2, T3 below, where \"a\", \"b\", \"c\" are sides of a triple:\nIn other words, every primitive triple will be a \"parent\" to three additional primitive triples.\nStarting from the initial node with \"a\" = 3, \"b\" = 4, and \"c\" = 5, the operation T1 produces the new triple \n(3 \u2212 (2\u00d74) + (2\u00d75), (2\u00d73) \u2212 4 + (2\u00d75), (2\u00d73) \u2212 (2\u00d74) + (3\u00d75)) = (5, 12, 13), \nand similarly T2 and T3 produce the triples (21, 20, 29) and (15, 8, 17).\nThe linear transformations T1, T2, and T3 have a geometric interpretation in the language of quadratic forms. They are closely related to (but are not equal to) reflections generating the orthogonal group of \"x\"2 + \"y\"2 \u2212 \"z\"2 over the integers.\nRelation to Gaussian integers.\nAlternatively, Euclid's formulae can be analyzed and proved using the Gaussian integers. Gaussian integers are complex numbers of the form \"\u03b1\" \n \"u\" + \"vi\", where \"u\" and \"v\" are ordinary integers and \"i\" is the square root of negative one. The units of Gaussian integers are \u00b11 and \u00b1i. The ordinary integers are called the rational integers and denoted as 'Z'. The Gaussian integers are denoted as Z[\"i\"]. The right-hand side of the Pythagorean theorem may be factored in Gaussian integers:\nformula_82\nA primitive Pythagorean triple is one in which \"a\" and \"b\" are coprime, i.e., they share no prime factors in the integers. For such a triple, either \"a\" or \"b\" is even, and the other is odd; from this, it follows that \"c\" is also odd.\nThe two factors \"z\" :\n \"a\" + \"bi\" and \"z*\" :\n \"a\" \u2212 \"bi\" of a primitive Pythagorean triple each equal the square of a Gaussian integer. This can be proved using the property that every Gaussian integer can be factored uniquely into Gaussian primes up to units. (This unique factorization follows from the fact that, roughly speaking, a version of the Euclidean algorithm can be defined on them.) The proof has three steps. First, if \"a\" and \"b\" share no prime factors in the integers, then they also share no prime factors in the Gaussian integers. (Assume \"a\" = \"gu\" and \"b\" = \"gv\" with Gaussian integers \"g\", \"u\" and \"v\" and \"g\" not a unit. Then \"u\" and \"v\" lie on the same line through the origin. All Gaussian integers on such a line are integer multiples of some Gaussian integer \"h\". But then the integer \"gh\" \u2260 \u00b11 divides both \"a\" and \"b\".) Second, it follows that \"z\" and \"z*\" likewise share no prime factors in the Gaussian integers. For if they did, then their common divisor \"\u03b4\" would also divide \"z\" + \"z*\" = 2\"a\" and \"z\" \u2212 \"z*\" = 2\"ib\". Since \"a\" and \"b\" are coprime, that implies that \"\u03b4\" divides\u00a02 = (1 + i)(1 \u2212 i) = i(1 \u2212 i)2. From the formula \"c\"2 = \"zz*\", that in turn would imply that \"c\" is even, contrary to the hypothesis of a primitive Pythagorean triple. Third, since \"c\"2 is a square, every Gaussian prime in its factorization is doubled, i.e., appears an even number of times. Since \"z\" and \"z*\" share no prime factors, this doubling is also true for them. Hence, \"z\" and \"z*\" are squares.\nThus, the first factor can be written\nformula_83\nThe real and imaginary parts of this equation give the two formulas:\nformula_84\nFor any primitive Pythagorean triple, there must be integers \"m\" and \"n\" such that these two equations are satisfied. Hence, every Pythagorean triple can be generated from some choice of these integers.\nAs perfect square Gaussian integers.\nIf we consider the square of a Gaussian integer we get the following direct interpretation of Euclid's formula as representing the perfect square of a Gaussian integer.\nformula_85\nUsing the facts that the Gaussian integers are a Euclidean domain and that for a Gaussian integer p formula_86 is always a square it is possible to show that a Pythagorean triple corresponds to the square of a prime Gaussian integer if the hypotenuse is prime.\nIf the Gaussian integer is not prime then it is the product of two Gaussian integers p and q with formula_86 and formula_88 integers. Since magnitudes multiply in the Gaussian integers, the product must be formula_89, which when squared to find a Pythagorean triple must be composite. The contrapositive completes the proof.\nDistribution of triples.\nThere are a number of results on the distribution of Pythagorean triples. In the scatter plot, a number of obvious patterns are already apparent. Whenever the legs (\"a\",\"b\") of a primitive triple appear in the plot, all integer multiples of (\"a\",\"b\") must also appear in the plot, and this property produces the appearance of lines radiating from the origin in the diagram.\nWithin the scatter, there are sets of parabolic patterns with a high density of points and all their foci at the origin, opening up in all four directions. Different parabolas intersect at the axes and appear to reflect off the axis with an incidence angle of 45 degrees, with a third parabola entering in a perpendicular fashion. Within this quadrant, each arc centered on the origin shows that section of the parabola that lies between its tip and its intersection with its semi-latus rectum.\nThese patterns can be explained as follows. If formula_90 is an integer, then (\"a\", formula_91, formula_92) is a Pythagorean triple. (In fact every Pythagorean triple (\"a\", \"b\", \"c\") can be written in this way with integer \"n\", possibly after exchanging \"a\" and \"b\", since formula_93 and \"a\" and \"b\" cannot both be odd.) The Pythagorean triples thus lie on curves given by formula_94, that is, parabolas reflected at the \"a\"-axis, and the corresponding curves with \"a\" and \"b\" interchanged. If \"a\" is varied for a given \"n\" (i.e. on a given parabola), integer values of \"b\" occur relatively frequently if \"n\" is a square or a small multiple of a square. If several such values happen to lie close together, the corresponding parabolas approximately coincide, and the triples cluster in a narrow parabolic strip. For instance, 382 = 1444, 2 \u00d7 272 = 1458,\n3 \u00d7 222 = 1452, 5 \u00d7 172 = 1445 and 10 \u00d7 122 = 1440; the corresponding parabolic strip around \"n\" \u2248 1450 is clearly visible in the scatter plot.\nThe angular properties described above follow immediately from the functional form of the parabolas. The parabolas are reflected at the \"a\"-axis at \"a\" = 2\"n\", and the derivative of \"b\" with respect to \"a\" at this point is \u20131; hence the incidence angle is 45\u00b0. Since the clusters, like all triples, are repeated at integer multiples, the value 2\"n\" also corresponds to a cluster. The corresponding parabola intersects the \"b\"-axis at right angles at \"b\" = 2\"n\", and hence its reflection upon interchange of \"a\" and \"b\" intersects the \"a\"-axis at right angles at \"a\" = 2\"n\", precisely where the parabola for \"n\" is reflected at the \"a\"-axis. (The same is of course true for \"a\" and \"b\" interchanged.)\nAlbert F\u00e4ssler and others provide insights into the significance of these parabolas in the context of conformal mappings.\nSpecial cases and related equations.\nThe Platonic sequence.\nThe case \"n\" = 1 of the more general construction of Pythagorean triples has been known for a long time. Proclus, in his commentary to the 47th Proposition of the first book of Euclid's \"Elements\", describes it as follows:\nCertain methods for the discovery of triangles of this kind are handed down, one which they refer to Plato, and another to Pythagoras. (The latter) starts from odd numbers. For it makes the odd number the smaller of the sides about the right angle; then it takes the square of it, subtracts unity and makes half the difference the greater of the sides about the right angle; lastly it adds unity to this and so forms the remaining side, the hypotenuse.\n...For the method of Plato argues from even numbers. It takes the given even number and makes it one of the sides about the right angle; then, bisecting this number and squaring the half, it adds unity to the square to form the hypotenuse, and subtracts unity from the square to form the other side about the right angle. ... Thus it has formed the same triangle that which was obtained by the other method.\nIn equation form, this becomes:\n\"a\" is odd (Pythagoras, c. 540 BC):\nformula_95\n\"a\" is even (Plato, c. 380 BC):\nformula_96\nIt can be shown that all Pythagorean triples can be obtained, with appropriate rescaling, from the basic Platonic sequence (\"a\", (\"a\"2 \u2212 1)/2 and (\"a\"2 + 1)/2) by allowing \"a\" to take non-integer rational values. If \"a\" is replaced with the fraction \"m\"/\"n\" in the sequence, the result is equal to the 'standard' triple generator (2\"mn\", \"m\"2 \u2212 \"n\"2,\"m\"2 + \"n\"2) after rescaling. It follows that every triple has a corresponding rational \"a\" value which can be used to generate a similar triangle (one with the same three angles and with sides in the same proportions as the original). For example, the Platonic equivalent of (56, 33, 65) is generated by \"a\" = \"m\"/\"n\" = 7/4 as (\"a\", (\"a\"2 \u20131)/2, (\"a\"2+1)/2) = (56/32, 33/32, 65/32). The Platonic sequence itself can be derived by following the steps for 'splitting the square' described in Diophantus II.VIII.\nThe Jacobi\u2013Madden equation.\nThe equation,\nformula_97\nis equivalent to the special Pythagorean triple,\nformula_98\nThere is an infinite number of solutions to this equation as solving for the variables involves an elliptic curve. Small ones are,\nformula_99\nformula_100\nEqual sums of two squares.\nOne way to generate solutions to formula_101 is to parametrize \"a, b, c, d\" in terms of integers \"m, n, p, q\" as follows:\nformula_102\nEqual sums of two fourth powers.\nGiven two sets of Pythagorean triples,\nformula_103\nformula_104\nthe problem of finding equal products of a non-hypotenuse side and the hypotenuse,\nformula_105\nis easily seen to be equivalent to the equation,\nformula_106\nand was first solved by Euler as formula_107 Since he showed this is a rational point in an elliptic curve, then there is an infinite number of solutions. In fact, he also found a 7th degree polynomial parameterization.\nDescartes' Circle Theorem.\nFor the case of Descartes' circle theorem where all variables are squares,\nformula_108\nEuler showed this is equivalent to three simultaneous Pythagorean triples,\nformula_109\nformula_110\nformula_111\nThere is also an infinite number of solutions, and for the special case when formula_112, then the equation simplifies to,\nformula_113\nwith small solutions as formula_114 and can be solved as binary quadratic forms.\nAlmost-isosceles Pythagorean triples.\nNo Pythagorean triples are isosceles, because the ratio of the hypotenuse to either other side is \u221a2, but \u221a2 cannot be expressed as the ratio of 2 integers.\nThere are, however, right-angled triangles with integral sides for which the lengths of the non-hypotenuse sides differ by one, such as,\nformula_115\nformula_116\nand an infinite number of others. They can be completely parameterized as,\nformula_117\nwhere {\"x, y\"} are the solutions to the Pell equation formula_118\nIf \"a\", \"b\", \"c\" are the sides of this type of primitive Pythagorean triple then the solution to the Pell equation is given by the recursive formula\nformula_119 with formula_120 and formula_121\nformula_122 with formula_123 and formula_124\nformula_125 with formula_126 and &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;.\nThis sequence of primitive Pythagorean triples forms the central stem (trunk) of the rooted ternary tree of primitive Pythagorean triples.\nWhen it is the longer non-hypotenuse side and hypotenuse that differ by one, such as in\nformula_127\nformula_128\nthen the complete solution for the primitive Pythagorean triple \"a\", \"b\", \"c\" is\nformula_129\nand\nformula_130\nwhere integer formula_131 is the generating parameter.\nIt shows that all odd numbers (greater than 1) appear in this type of almost-isosceles primitive Pythagorean triple. This sequence of primitive Pythagorean triples forms the right hand side outer stem of the rooted ternary tree of primitive Pythagorean triples.\nAnother property of this type of almost-isosceles primitive Pythagorean triple is that the sides are related such that \nformula_132\nfor some integer formula_133. Or in other words formula_134 is divisible by formula_135 such as in\nformula_136.\nFibonacci numbers in Pythagorean triples.\nStarting with 5, every second Fibonacci number is the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle with integer sides, or in other words, the largest number in a Pythagorean triple, obtained from the formula\nformula_137\nThe sequence of Pythagorean triangles obtained from this formula has sides of lengths\n(3,4,5), (5,12,13), (16,30,34), (39,80,89), ...\nThe middle side of each of these triangles is the sum of the three sides of the preceding triangle.\nGeneralizations.\nThere are several ways to generalize the concept of Pythagorean triples.\nPythagorean \"n\"-tuple.\nThe expression\nformula_138\nis a Pythagorean n-tuple for any tuple of positive integers (\"m\"1, ..., \"m\"\"n\") with \"m\" &gt; \"m\" + ... + \"m\". The Pythagorean n-tuple can be made primitive by dividing out by the largest common divisor of its values.\nFurthermore, any primitive Pythagorean n-tuple \"a\" + ... + \"a\" = \"c\"2 can be found by this approach. Use (\"m\"1, ..., \"m\"\"n\") = (\"c\" + \"a\"1, \"a\"2, ..., \"a\"\"n\") to get a Pythagorean n-tuple by the above formula and divide out by the largest common integer divisor, which is 2\"m\"1 = 2(\"c\" + \"a\"1). Dividing out by the largest common divisor of these (\"m\"1, ..., \"m\"\"n\") values gives the same primitive Pythagorean n-tuple; and there is a one-to-one correspondence between tuples of setwise coprime positive integers (\"m\"1, ..., \"m\"\"n\") satisfying \"m\" &gt; \"m\" + ... + \"m\" and primitive Pythagorean n-tuples.\nExamples of the relationship between setwise coprime values formula_139 and primitive Pythagorean n-tuples include:\nformula_140\nConsecutive squares.\nSince the sum \"F\"(\"k\",\"m\") of \"k\" consecutive squares beginning with \"m\"2 is given by the formula,\nformula_141\none may find values (\"k\", \"m\") so that \"F\"(\"k\",\"m\") is a square, such as one by Hirschhorn where the number of terms is itself a square,\nformula_142\nand \"v\" \u2265 5 is any integer not divisible by 2 or 3. For the smallest case \"v\" = 5, hence \"k\" = 25, this yields the well-known cannonball-stacking problem of Lucas,\nformula_143\na fact which is connected to the Leech lattice.\nIn addition, if in a Pythagorean \"n\"-tuple (\"n\" \u2265 4) all addends are consecutive except one, one can use the equation,\nformula_144\nSince the second power of \"p\" cancels out, this is only linear and easily solved for as formula_145 though \"k\", \"m\" should be chosen so that \"p\" is an integer, with a small example being \"k\" = 5, \"m\" = 1 yielding,\nformula_146\nThus, one way of generating Pythagorean \"n\"-tuples is by using, for various \"x\",\nformula_147\nwhere \"q = n\"\u20132 and where\nformula_148\nFermat's Last Theorem.\nA generalization of the concept of Pythagorean triples is the search for triples of positive integers \"a\", \"b\", and \"c\", such that \"a\"\"n\" + \"b\"\"n\" \n \"c\"\"n\", for some \"n\" strictly greater than 2. Pierre de Fermat in 1637 claimed that no such triple exists, a claim that came to be known as Fermat's Last Theorem because it took longer than any other conjecture by Fermat to be proved or disproved. The first proof was given by Andrew Wiles in 1994.\n\"n\" \u2212 1 or \"n\" \"n\"th powers summing to an \"n\"th power.\nAnother generalization is searching for sequences of \"n\" + 1 positive integers for which the \"n\"th power of the last is the sum of the \"n\"th powers of the previous terms. The smallest sequences for known values of \"n\" are:\nFor the \"n\" = 3 case, in which formula_149 called the Fermat cubic, a general formula exists giving all solutions.\nA slightly different generalization allows the sum of (\"k\" + 1) \"n\"th powers to equal the sum of (\"n\" \u2212 \"k\") \"n\"th powers. For example:\nThere can also exist \"n\" \u2212 1 positive integers whose \"n\"th powers sum to an \"n\"th power (though, by Fermat's Last Theorem, not for \"n\" = 3); these are counterexamples to Euler's sum of powers conjecture. The smallest known counterexamples are\nHeronian triangle triples.\nA Heronian triangle is commonly defined as one with integer sides whose area is also an integer. The lengths of the sides of such a triangle form a Heronian triple (\"a, b, c\") for \"a\" \u2264 \"b\" \u2264 \"c\".\nEvery Pythagorean triple is a Heronian triple, because at least one of the legs \"a\", \"b\" must be even in a Pythagorean triple, so the area \"ab\"/2 is an integer. Not every Heronian triple is a Pythagorean triple, however, as the example (4, 13, 15) with area 24 shows.\nIf (\"a\", \"b\", \"c\") is a Heronian triple, so is (\"ka\", \"kb\", \"kc\") where \"k\" is any positive integer; its area will be the integer that is \"k\"2 times the integer area of the (\"a\", \"b\", \"c\") triangle.\nThe Heronian triple (\"a\", \"b\", \"c\") is primitive provided \"a\", \"b\", \"c\" are setwise coprime. (With primitive Pythagorean triples the stronger statement that they are \"pairwise\" coprime also applies, but with primitive Heronian triangles the stronger statement does not always hold true, such as with (7, 15, 20).) Here are a few of the simplest primitive Heronian triples that are not Pythagorean triples:\n (4, 13, 15) with area 24\n (3, 25, 26) with area 36\n (7, 15, 20) with area 42\n (6, 25, 29) with area 60\n (11, 13, 20) with area 66\n (13, 14, 15) with area 84\n (13, 20, 21) with area 126\nBy Heron's formula, the extra condition for a triple of positive integers (\"a\", \"b\", \"c\") with \"a\" &lt; \"b\" &lt; \"c\" to be Heronian is that\n (\"a\"2 + \"b\"2 + \"c\"2)2 \u2212 2(\"a\"4 + \"b\"4 + \"c\"4)\nor equivalently\n 2(\"a\"2\"b\"2 + \"a\"2\"c\"2 + \"b\"2\"c\"2) \u2212 (\"a\"4 + \"b\"4 + \"c\"4)\nbe a nonzero perfect square divisible by 16.\nApplication to cryptography.\nPrimitive Pythagorean triples have been used in cryptography as random sequences and for the generation of keys.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "24175", "revid": "47304986", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24175", "title": "Pattern welding", "text": "Swordmaking technique\nPattern welding is a smithing practice of folding and/or twisting metal, possibly multiple pieces (which may have differing compositions, or be completely different types of metal) that are forge-welded. This results in differing layers in a pattern, hence the name. This process was independently discovered by many ironworking societies. Often wrongly called Damascus steel, blades forged in this manner display bands of slightly different patterning along their entire length. These bands can be highlighted for cosmetic purposes by proper polishing or acid etching. Pattern welding was an outgrowth of laminated or piled steel, a similar technique used to combine steels of different carbon contents, providing a desired mix of hardness and toughness. Pattern welding also, more importantly, reduces impurities and, most importantly, homogenizes the steel. However modern steelmaking processes negate the need to blend different steels, reduce impurities, or homogenize the steel, pattern welded steel is still used by custom knifemakers for the cosmetic effects it produces. It is also used with non-steel metals, for its aesthetic properties, such as with mokume-gane.\nHistory.\nPattern welding developed out of the necessarily complex process of making blades that were both hard and tough from the erratic and unsuitable output from early iron smelting in bloomeries. The bloomery does not generate temperatures high enough to melt iron and steel, but instead reduces the iron oxide ore into particles of pure iron, which then weld into a mass of sponge iron, consisting of lumps of impurities in a matrix of relatively pure iron, which is too soft to make a good blade. Carburizing thin iron bars or plates forms a layer of harder, high carbon steel on the surface, and early bladesmiths would forge these bars or plates together to form relatively homogeneous bars of steel. This laminating process, in which different types of steel together produce patterns that can be seen in the surface of the finished blade, forms the basis for pattern welding.\nPattern welding in Europe.\nPattern welding dates to the first millennium BC, with Celtic, and later Germanic swords exhibiting the technique, with the Romans describing the blade patternation.\nBy the 2nd and 3rd century AD, the Celts commonly used pattern welding for decoration in addition to structural reasons. The technique involves folding and forging alternating layers of steel into rods, then twisting the steel to form complex patterns when forged into a blade. By the 6th and 7th centuries, pattern welding had reached a level where thin layers of patterned steel were being overlaid onto a soft iron core, making the swords far better as the iron gave them a flexible and springy core that would take any shock from sword blows to stop the blade bending or snapping. By the end of the Viking Age, pattern welding fell out of use in Europe.\nIn medieval swords, pattern welding was more prevalent than commonly thought. However, the presence of rust makes detection difficult without repolishing.\nDuring the Middle Ages, Wootz steel was produced in India and exported globally, including to Europe. The similarities in the markings led many to believe it was the same process being used, and pattern welding was revived by European smiths who were attempting to duplicate the Damascus steel. The methods used by Indian smiths to produce their Wootz steel was lost over the centuries.\nThe ancient swordmakers exploited the aesthetic qualities of pattern welded steel. The Vikings, in particular, were fond of twisting bars of steel around each other, welding the bars together by hammering and then repeating the process with the resulting bars, to create complex patterns in the final steel bar. Two bars twisted in opposite directions created the common chevron pattern. Often, the center of the blade was a core of soft steel, and the edges were solid high carbon steel, similar to the laminates of the Japanese.\nModern decorative use.\nPattern welding is still popular with contemporary bladesmiths both for visual effect and for recreating historic patterns and swords. Modern steels and methods allow for patterns with much higher number of visible layers compared to historical artifacts. Large numbers of layers can either be produced by folding similar to historical processes or by forge welding a small number of layers together, then cutting the billet in pieces to stack and forge-weld it again. This can be repeated until the desired number of layers have been achieved. A blade ground from such a blank can show a pattern similar to wood grain with small random variations in pattern. Some manufactured objects can be re-purposed into pattern welded blanks. \"Cable Damascus\", forged from high carbon multi-strand cable, is a popular item for bladesmiths to produce, producing a finely grained, twisted pattern, while chainsaw chains produce a pattern of randomly positioned blobs of color.\nSome modern bladesmiths have taken pattern welding to new heights, with elaborate applications of traditional pattern welding techniques, as well as with new technology. A layered billet of steel rods with the blade blank cut perpendicular to the layers can also produce some spectacular patterns, including mosaics or even writing. Powder metallurgy allows alloys that would not normally be compatible to be combined into solid bars. Different treatments of the steel after it is ground and polished, such as bluing, etching, or various other chemical surface treatments that react differently to the different metals used can create bright, high-contrast finishes on the steel. Some master smiths go as far as to use techniques such as electrical discharge machining to cut interlocking patterns out of different steels, fit them together, then weld the resulting assembly into a solid block of steel.\nBlacksmiths will sometimes apply Wite-Out, Liquid Paper, or other types of correction fluid to metal that they do not want to weld together, as the titanium dioxide in the correction fluid forms a barrier between the metal it is applied-to and any other pieces of metal. For example, when creating pattern-welded steel by filling a steel canister with pieces of metal and powdered steel and forging it together into a single mass (\"https://,\") smiths frequently coat the inside of the canister with correction fluid and let it dry before adding their materials. Thus, when the canister is heated and compressed using a hammer or pneumatic press, the material on the inside of the correction fluid is forged together, but it does not forge to the canister, allowing the pattern created by forging the different materials together to be seen in the finished piece because it is not covered by the homologous steel of the canister. \nEtymology.\nThe term 'pattern welding' was coined by English archaeologist Herbert Maryon in a 1948 paper: \"The welding of these swords represents an excessively difficult operation. I do not know of finer smith's work... I have named the technique \u2018pattern welding\u2019... Examples of pattern-welding range in date from the third century to the Viking Age.\"\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

One of the most influential artists of the 20th century, he is known for co-founding the Cubist movement, the invention of constructed sculpture, the co-invention of collage, and for the wide variety of styles that he helped develop and explore. Among his most famous works are the proto-Cubist \"Les Demoiselles d'Avignon\" (1907) and the anti-war painting \"Guernica\" (1937), a dramatic portrayal of the bombing of Guernica by German and Italian air forces during the Spanish Civil War.\nBeginning his formal training under his father Jos\u00e9 Ruiz y Blasco aged seven, Picasso demonstrated extraordinary artistic talent from a young age, painting in a naturalistic manner through his childhood and adolescence. During the first decade of the 20th century, his style changed as he experimented with different theories, techniques, and ideas. After 1906, the Fauvist work of the older artist Henri Matisse motivated Picasso to explore more radical styles, beginning a fruitful rivalry between the two artists, who subsequently were often paired by critics as the leaders of modern art.\nPicasso's output, especially in his early career, is often periodized. While the names of many of his later periods are debated, the most commonly accepted periods in his work are the Blue Period (1901\u20131904), the Rose Period (1904\u20131906), the African-influenced Period (1907\u20131909), Analytic Cubism (1909\u20131912), and Synthetic Cubism (1912\u20131919), also referred to as the Crystal period. Much of Picasso's work of the late 1910s and early 1920s is in a neoclassical style, and his work in the mid-1920s often has characteristics of Surrealism. His later work often combines elements of his earlier styles.\nExceptionally prolific throughout the course of his long life, Picasso achieved universal renown and immense fortune for his revolutionary artistic accomplishments, and became one of the best-known figures in 20th-century art.\nEarly life.\nPicasso was born at 23:15 on 25 October 1881, in the city of M\u00e1laga, Andalusia, in southern Spain. He was the first child of Jos\u00e9 Ruiz y Blasco (1838\u20131913) and Mar\u00eda Picasso y L\u00f3pez. Picasso's family was of middle-class background. His father was a painter who specialized in naturalistic depictions of birds and other game. For most of his life, Ruiz was a professor of art at the School of Crafts and a curator of a local museum.\nPicasso's birth certificate and the record of his baptism include very long names, combining those of various saints and relatives. \"Ruiz y Picasso\" were his paternal and maternal surnames, respectively, per Spanish custom. The surname \"Picasso\" comes from Liguria, a coastal region of north-western Italy. Pablo's maternal great-grandfather, Tommaso Picasso, moved to Spain around 1807.\nPicasso showed a passion and a skill for drawing from an early age. According to his mother, his first words were \"piz, piz\", a shortening of \"l\u00e1piz\", the Spanish word for \"pencil\". From the age of seven, Picasso received formal artistic training from his father in figure drawing and oil painting. Ruiz was a traditional academic artist and instructor, who believed that proper training required disciplined copying of the masters, and drawing the human body from plaster casts and live models. His son became preoccupied with art to the detriment of his classwork.\nThe family moved to A Coru\u00f1a in 1891, where his father became a professor at the School of Fine Arts. They stayed for almost four years. On one occasion, the father found his son painting over his unfinished sketch of a pigeon. Observing the precision of his son's technique, an apocryphal story relates, Ruiz felt that the thirteen-year-old Picasso had surpassed him, and vowed to give up painting, though paintings by him exist from later years.\nIn 1895, Picasso was traumatized when his seven-year-old sister, Conchita, died of diphtheria. After her death, the family moved to Barcelona, where Ruiz took a position at its School of Fine Arts. Picasso thrived in the city, regarding it in times of sadness or nostalgia as his true home. Ruiz persuaded the officials at the academy to allow his son to take an entrance exam for the advanced class. This process often took students a month, but Picasso completed it in a week, and the jury admitted him, at just 13. As a student, Picasso lacked discipline but made friendships that would affect him in later life. His father rented a small room for him close to home so he could work alone, yet he checked up on him numerous times a day, judging his drawings. The two argued frequently.\nPicasso's father and uncle decided to send the young artist to Madrid's Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando, the country's foremost art school. At age 16, Picasso set off for the first time on his own, but he disliked formal instruction and stopped attending classes soon after enrollment. Madrid held many other attractions. The Prado housed paintings by Diego Vel\u00e1zquez, Francisco Goya, and Francisco de Zurbar\u00e1n. Picasso especially admired the works of El Greco; elements such as his elongated limbs, arresting colours, and mystical visages are echoed in Picasso's later work.\nCareer.\nBefore 1900.\nPicasso's training under his father began before 1890. His progress can be traced in the collection of early works now held by the Museu Picasso in Barcelona, which provides one of the most comprehensive extant records of any major artist's beginnings. During 1893 the juvenile quality of his earliest work falls away, and by 1894 his career as a painter can be said to have begun. The academic realism apparent in the works of the mid-1890s is well displayed in \"The First Communion\" (1896), a large composition that depicts his sister, Lola. In the same year, at the age of 14, he painted \"https://\", a vigorous and dramatic portrait that Juan-Eduardo Cirlot has called \"without a doubt one of the greatest in the whole history of Spanish painting.\"\nIn 1897, his realism began to show a Symbolist influence, for example, in a series of landscape paintings rendered in non-naturalistic violet and green tones. What some call his Modernist period (1899\u20131900) followed. His exposure to the work of Rossetti, Steinlen, Toulouse-Lautrec and Edvard Munch, combined with his admiration for favourite old masters such as El Greco, led Picasso to a personal version of modernism in his works of this period.\nPicasso made his first trip to Paris, then the art capital of Europe, in 1900. There, he met his first Parisian friend, journalist and poet Max Jacob, who helped Picasso learn the language and its literature. Soon they shared an apartment; Max slept at night while Picasso slept during the day and worked at night. These were times of severe poverty, cold, and desperation. Much of his work was burned to keep the small room warm. During the first five months of 1901, Picasso lived in Madrid, where he and his anarchist friend Francisco de As\u00eds Soler founded the magazine \"Arte Joven\" (\"Young Art\"), which published five issues. Soler solicited articles and Picasso illustrated the journal, mostly contributing grim cartoons depicting and sympathizing with the state of the poor. The first issue was published on 31 March 1901, by which time the artist had started to sign his work \"Picasso\". From 1898 he signed his works as \"Pablo Ruiz Picasso\", then as \"Pablo R. Picasso\" until 1901. The change does not seem to imply a rejection of the father figure. Rather, he wanted to distinguish himself from others; initiated by his Catalan friends who habitually called him by his maternal surname, much less current than the paternal Ruiz.\nBlue Period: 1901\u20131904.\nPicasso's Blue Period (1901\u20131904), characterized by sombre paintings rendered in shades of blue and blue-green only occasionally warmed by other colours, began either in Spain in early 1901 or in Paris in the second half of the year. Many paintings of gaunt mothers with children date from the Blue Period, during which Picasso divided his time between Barcelona and Paris. In his austere use of colour and sometimes doleful subject matter \u2013 prostitutes and beggars are frequent subjects \u2013 Picasso was influenced by a trip through Spain and by the suicide of his friend Carles Casagemas. Starting in autumn of 1901, he painted several posthumous portraits of Casagemas culminating in the gloomy allegorical painting \"La Vie\" (1903), now in the Cleveland Museum of Art.\nThe same mood pervades the well-known etching \"The Frugal Repast\" (1904), which depicts a blind man and a sighted woman, both emaciated, seated at a nearly bare table. Blindness, a recurrent theme in Picasso's works of this period, is also represented in \"The Blindman's Meal\" (1903, the Metropolitan Museum of Art) and in the portrait of \"Celestina\" (1903). Other Blue Period works include \"Portrait of Soler\" and \"Portrait of Suzanne Bloch\".\nRose Period: 1904\u20131906.\nThe Rose Period (1904\u20131906) is characterized by a lighter tone and style utilizing orange and pink colours and featuring many circus people, acrobats and harlequins known in France as saltimbanques. The harlequin, a comedic character usually depicted in checkered patterned clothing, became a personal symbol for Picasso. Picasso met Fernande Olivier, a bohemian artist who became his mistress, in Paris in 1904. Olivier appears in many of his Rose Period paintings, many of which are influenced by his warm relationship with her, in addition to his increased exposure to French painting. The generally upbeat and optimistic mood of paintings in this period is reminiscent of the 1899\u20131901 period (i.e., just prior to the Blue Period), and 1904 can be considered a transition year between the two periods.\nBy 1905, Picasso became a favourite of American art collectors Leo and Gertrude Stein. Their older brother Michael Stein and his wife Sarah also became collectors of his work. Picasso painted a portrait of Gertrude Stein and one of her nephew Allan Stein. Gertrude Stein became Picasso's principal patron, acquiring his drawings and paintings and exhibiting them in her informal \"Salon\" at her home in Paris. At one of her gatherings in 1905, he met Henri Matisse, who was to become a lifelong friend and rival. The Steins introduced him to Claribel Cone and her sister Etta, who were American art collectors; they also began to acquire Picasso's and Matisse's paintings. Eventually, Leo Stein moved to Italy. Michael and Sarah Stein became patrons of Matisse, while Gertrude Stein continued to collect Picassos.\nIn 1907, Picasso joined an art gallery that had recently been opened in Paris by Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler, a German art historian and art collector who became one of the premier French art dealers of the 20th century. He was among the first champions of Pablo Picasso, Georges Braque and the Cubism that they jointly developed. Kahnweiler promoted burgeoning artists such as Andr\u00e9 Derain, Kees van Dongen, Fernand L\u00e9ger, Juan Gris, Maurice de Vlaminck and several others who had come from all over the globe to live and work in Montparnasse at the time.\nAfrican art and primitivism: 1907\u20131909.\nPicasso's African-influenced Period (1907\u20131909) begins with his painting \"Les Demoiselles d'Avignon\". The three figures on the left were inspired by Iberian sculpture, but he repainted the faces of the two figures on the right after being powerfully impressed by African artefacts he saw in June 1907 in the ethnographic museum at Palais du Trocad\u00e9ro. When he displayed the painting to acquaintances in his studio later that year, the nearly universal reaction was shock and revulsion; Matisse angrily dismissed the work as a hoax. Picasso did not exhibit \"Les Demoiselles\" publicly until 1916.\nOther works from this period include \"Nude with Raised Arms\" (1907) and \"Three Women\" (1908). Formal ideas developed during this period lead directly into the Cubist period that follows.\nAnalytic cubism (1909\u20131912) is a style of painting Picasso developed with Georges Braque using monochrome brownish and neutral colours. Both artists took apart objects and \"analyzed\" them in terms of their shapes. Picasso and Braque's paintings at this time share many similarities.\nIn Paris, Picasso entertained a distinguished coterie of friends in the Montmartre and Montparnasse quarters, including Andr\u00e9 Breton, poet Guillaume Apollinaire, writer Alfred Jarry and Gertrude Stein. In 1911, Picasso was arrested and questioned about the theft of the \"Mona Lisa\" from the Louvre. Suspicion for the crime had initially fallen upon Apollinaire due to his links to G\u00e9ry Pieret, an artist with a history of thefts from the gallery. Apollinaire in turn implicated his close friend Picasso, who had also purchased stolen artworks from the artist in the past. Afraid of a conviction that could result in his deportation to Spain, Picasso denied having ever met Apollinaire. Both were later cleared of any involvement in the painting's disappearance.\nSynthetic cubism: 1912\u20131919.\nSynthetic cubism (1912\u20131919) was a further development of the genre of cubism, in which cut paper fragments\u00a0\u2013 often wallpaper or portions of newspaper pages\u00a0\u2013 were pasted into compositions, marking the first cubist collage and simultaneously what is often considered to be the first assemblage, with his creation of the seminal work \"Still Life with Chair Caning\" (1912; oil and printed oilcloth \non canvas edged with rope).\nBetween 1915 and 1917, Picasso began a series of paintings depicting highly geometric and minimalist Cubist objects, consisting of either a pipe, a guitar or a glass, with an occasional element of collage. \"Hard-edged square-cut diamonds\", notes art historian John Richardson, \"these gems do not always have upside or downside\". \"We need a new name to designate them,\" wrote Picasso to Gertrude Stein. The term \"Crystal Cubism\" was later used as a result of visual analogies with crystals at the time. These \"little gems\" may have been produced by Picasso in response to critics who had claimed his defection from the movement, through his experimentation with classicism within the so-called return to order following the war.\nAfter acquiring some fame and fortune, Picasso left Olivier for Marcelle Humbert, also known as Eva Gouel. Picasso included declarations of his love for Eva in many Cubist works. Picasso was devastated by her premature death from illness at the age of 30 in 1915.\nAt the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, Picasso was living in Avignon. Braque and Derain were mobilized and Apollinaire joined the French artillery, while the Spaniard Juan Gris remained from the Cubist circle. During the war, Picasso was able to continue painting uninterrupted, unlike his French comrades. His paintings became more sombre and his life changed with dramatic consequences. Kahnweiler's contract had terminated on his exile from France. At this point, Picasso's work would be taken on by the art dealer L\u00e9once Rosenberg. After the loss of Eva Gouel, Picasso had an affair with Gaby Lespinasse. During the spring of 1916, Apollinaire returned from the front wounded. They renewed their friendship, but Picasso began to frequent new social circles.\nTowards the end of World War I, Picasso became involved with Serge Diaghilev's Ballets Russes. Among his friends during this period were Jean Cocteau, Jean Hugo, Juan Gris, and others. In the summer of 1918, Picasso married Olga Khokhlova, a ballerina with Sergei Diaghilev's troupe, for whom Picasso was designing a ballet, Erik Satie's \"Parade\", in Rome; they spent their honeymoon near Biarritz in the villa of glamorous Chilean art patron Eugenia Err\u00e1zuriz. \nKhokhlova introduced Picasso to high society, formal dinner parties, and other dimensions of the life of the rich in 1920s Paris. The two had a son, Paulo Picasso, who would grow up to be a motorcycle racer and chauffeur to his father. Khokhlova's insistence on social propriety clashed with Picasso's bohemian tendencies and the two lived in a state of constant conflict. During the same period that Picasso collaborated with Diaghilev's troupe, he and Igor Stravinsky collaborated on \"Pulcinella\" in 1920. Picasso took the opportunity to make several drawings of the composer. In the summer of 1921, Picasso, Khokhlova and Paulo stayed at a villa in the village of Fontainebleau, France; during their time there, Picasso, using the garage as a studio, painted \"Three Women at the Spring\" and \"Three Musicians\".\nNeoclassicism and surrealism: 1919\u20131929.\nIn February 1917, Picasso made his first trip to Italy. In the period following the upheaval of World War I, Picasso produced work in a neoclassical style. This \"return to order\" is evident in the work of many European artists in the 1920s, including Andr\u00e9 Derain, Giorgio de Chirico, Gino Severini, Jean Metzinger, the artists of the New Objectivity movement and of the Novecento Italiano movement. Picasso's paintings and drawings from this period frequently recall the work of Raphael and Ingres.\nIn 1925 the Surrealist writer and poet Andr\u00e9 Breton declared Picasso as \"one of ours\" in his article \"Le Surr\u00e9alisme et la peinture\", published in \"R\u00e9volution surr\u00e9aliste\". \"Les Demoiselles\" was reproduced for the first time in Europe in the same issue. Yet Picasso exhibited Cubist works at the first Surrealist group exhibition in 1925; the concept of \"psychic automatism in its pure state\" defined in the \"Manifeste du surr\u00e9alisme\" never appealed to him entirely. He did at the time develop new imagery and formal syntax for expressing himself emotionally, \"releasing the violence, the psychic fears and the eroticism that had been largely contained or sublimated since 1909\", writes art historian Melissa McQuillan. Although this transition in Picasso's work was informed by Cubism for its spatial relations, \"the fusion of ritual and abandon in the imagery recalls the primitivism of the Demoiselles and the elusive psychological resonances of his Symbolist work\", writes McQuillan. Surrealism revived Picasso's attraction to primitivism and eroticism.\nIn 1927, Picasso met 17-year-old Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Walter and began a long-standing affair with her. She became his \"Golden muse,\" and he fathered a daughter with her, named Maya.\nThe Great Depression, \"Guernica\", and the MoMA exhibition: 1930\u20131939.\nDuring the 1930s, the minotaur replaced the harlequin as a common motif in his work. His use of the minotaur came partly from his contact with the surrealists, who often used it as their symbol, and it appears in Picasso's \"Guernica\". The minotaur and Picasso's mistress Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Walter are heavily featured in his celebrated \"Vollard Suite\" of etchings.\nArguably Picasso's most famous work is his depiction of the German bombing of Guernica during the Spanish Civil War \u2013 \"Guernica\". This large canvas embodies for many the inhumanity, brutality and hopelessness of war. Asked to explain its symbolism, Picasso said, \"It isn't up to the painter to define the symbols. Otherwise it would be better if he wrote them out in so many words! The public who look at the picture must interpret the symbols as they understand them.\"\n\"Guernica\" was exhibited in July 1937 at the Spanish Pavilion at the Paris International Exposition, and then became the centrepiece of an exhibition of 118 works by Picasso, Matisse, Braque and Henri Laurens that toured Scandinavia and England. After the victory of Francisco Franco in Spain, the painting was sent to the United States to raise funds and support for Spanish refugees. Until 1981 it was entrusted to the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York City, as it was Picasso's expressed desire that the painting should not be delivered to Spain until liberty and democracy had been established in the country.\nBefore \"Guernica\", Picasso had never addressed political themes in his art. The politicized nature of the work is largely attributed to his romantic relationship at the time with the French anti-fascist activist and surrealist photographer, Dora Maar. In addition, her black and white photographs are likely to have influenced the black and white scheme of \"Guernica\", in stark contrast to Picasso's usual colorful paintings. \"Maar's practice of photography influenced the art of Picasso \u2013 she had a great influence on his work,\" said Antoine Romand, a Dora Maar expert. \"She contested him. She pushed him to do something new and to be more creative politically.\" Maar had exclusive access to Picasso's studio to observe and photograph the creation of \"Guernica\". At Picasso's request, Maar painted parts of the dying horse.\nIn 1939 and 1940, the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, under its director Alfred Barr, a Picasso enthusiast, held a major retrospective of Picasso's principal works until that time. This exhibition lionized Picasso, brought into full public view in America the scope of his artistry, and resulted in a reinterpretation of his work by contemporary art historians and scholars. According to Jonathan Weinberg, \"Given the extraordinary quality of the show and Picasso's enormous prestige, generally heightened by the political impact of \"Guernica\" ... the critics were surprisingly ambivalent\". Picasso's \"multiplicity of styles\" was disturbing to one journalist; another described him as \"wayward and even malicious\"; Alfred Frankenstein's review in \"ARTnews\" concluded that Picasso was both charlatan and genius.\nWorld War II and late 1940s: 1939\u20131949.\nDuring World War II, Picasso remained in Paris while the Germans occupied the city. Picasso's artistic style did not fit the Nazi ideal of art, so he did not exhibit during this time. He confused Germans who came to steal both his and Matisse's paintings from a bank vault, disparaging the value of his work and distracting them from a more thorough search, thus protecting their collections. He was often harassed by the Gestapo. During one search of his apartment, an officer saw a photograph of the painting \"Guernica\". \"Did you do that?\" the German asked Picasso. \"No,\" he replied, \"You did.\"\nRetreating to his studio, he continued to paint, producing works such as the \"Still Life with Guitar\" (1942) and \"The Charnel House\" (1944\u201348). Although the Germans outlawed bronze casting in Paris, Picasso continued regardless, using bronze smuggled to him by the French Resistance.\nAround this time, Picasso wrote poetry as an alternative outlet. Between 1935 and 1959 he wrote more than 300 poems. Largely untitled except for a date and sometimes the location of where they were written (for example \"Paris 16 May 1936\"), these works were gustatory, erotic, and at times scatological, as were his two full-length plays, \"Desire Caught by the Tail\" (1941), \"The Four Little Girls\" (1949) and \"The Burial of the Count of Orgaz\" (1959).\nIn 1944, after the liberation of Paris, Picasso, then 63 years old, began a romantic relationship with a young art student named Fran\u00e7oise Gilot. She was 40 years younger than he was. Picasso grew tired of his mistress Dora Maar; Picasso and Gilot began to live together. Eventually, they had two children: Claude Picasso, born in 1947 and Paloma Picasso, born in 1949. \nPicasso had affairs with women of an even greater age disparity than his and Gilot's. While still involved with Gilot, in 1951 Picasso had a six-week affair with Genevi\u00e8ve Laporte, who was four years younger than Gilot. By his 70s, many paintings, ink drawings and prints have as their theme an old, grotesque dwarf as the doting lover of a beautiful young model.\nLater works and final years: 1949\u20131973.\nPicasso was one of 250 sculptors who exhibited in the 3rd Sculpture International held at the Philadelphia Museum of Art in mid-1949. In the 1950s, Picasso's style changed once again, as he took to producing reinterpretations of the art of the great masters. He made a series of works based on Vel\u00e1zquez's painting \"Las Meninas\". He also based paintings on works by Goya, Poussin, Manet, Courbet and Delacroix.\nBy this time, Picasso had constructed a huge Gothic home, and could afford large villas in the south of France, such as Mas Notre-Dame-de-Vie on the outskirts of Mougins, and in the Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te d'Azur. He was an international celebrity, with often as much interest in his personal life as his art.\nIn 1952, Picasso met Jacqueline Roque, who worked at the Madoura Pottery in Vallauris on the French Riviera, where Picasso made and painted ceramics. She became his lover, and then his second wife in 1961. The two were together for the remainder of Picasso's life. \nIn addition to his artistic accomplishments, Picasso made a few film appearances, always as himself, including a cameo in Jean Cocteau's \"Testament of Orpheus\" (1960). In 1955, he helped make the film \"Le Myst\u00e8re Picasso\" (\"The Mystery of Picasso\") directed by Henri-Georges Clouzot.\nHe was commissioned to make a maquette for a huge public sculpture to be built in Chicago, known usually as the Chicago Picasso. He approached the project with a great deal of enthusiasm, designing a sculpture which was ambiguous and somewhat controversial. Picasso said the figure represented the head of an Afghan Hound named Kabul. The sculpture, one of the most recognizable landmarks in downtown Chicago, was unveiled in 1967. Picasso refused to be paid $100,000 for it, donating it to the people of the city.\nPicasso's final works were a mixture of styles, his means of expression in constant flux until the end of his life. Devoting his full energies to his work, Picasso became more daring, his works more colourful and expressive, and from 1968 to 1971 he produced a torrent of paintings and hundreds of copperplate etchings. At the time these works were dismissed by most as pornographic fantasies of an impotent old man or the slapdash works of an artist who was past his prime. Only later, after Picasso's death, when the rest of the art world had moved on from abstract expressionism, did the critical community come to see the late works of Picasso as prefiguring Neo-Expressionism.\nIn the spring of 1973, Picasso assisted in putting together 201 of his paintings for the Avignon Arts Festival, which opened at the Palais des Papes in May of that year. The canvases, according to Paul Puaux, the festival director who had visited Picasso at his home, represented the artist's work from October 1970 until the end of 1972.\nDeath.\nPicasso died on 8 April 1973 in Mougins, France, from a heart attack brought on by pulmonary edema. The evening before his death, Picasso and his wife Jacqueline entertained friends for dinner. He painted until 3 a.m. on this particular night before going to bed. Picasso woke up at 11:30 a.m., but he was unable to get out of bed. Jacqueline called his physician, Dr. Jean-Claude Rance, for assistance, but he died at 11:40 a.m. before a doctor arrived.\nPicasso was interred at the Ch\u00e2teau of Vauvenargues near Aix-en-Provence, a property he had acquired in 1958 and occupied with Jacqueline between 1959 and 1961. Jacqueline prevented Picasso's children, Maya, Claude, and Paloma, and his grandson Pablito from seeing his body. Only Paulo, the sole legitimate child of Picasso, was allowed to attend the funeral. \nPicasso died without a will, which led to a feud over his estate. His three illegitimate children were granted the right to share the Picasso estate by French judges, despite opposition from Jacqueline and Paulo. Following the death of Paulo in 1975, Picasso's surviving heirs were his widow, Jacqueline; his grandchildren from Paulo, Marina and Bernard; and his children, Claude, Paloma and Maya. They reached a settlement on how to divide Picasso's $240 million estate in December 1976.\nWorks.\nStyle and technique.\nPicasso was exceptionally prolific throughout his long lifetime. At his death there were more than 45,000 unsold works in his estate, comprising 1,885 paintings, 1,228 sculptures, 3,222 ceramics, 7,089 drawings, 150 sketchbooks, many thousands of prints, and numerous tapestries and rugs. The most complete \u2013 but not exhaustive \u2013 catalogue of his works, the catalogue raisonn\u00e9 compiled by Christian Zervos, lists more than 16,000 paintings and drawings. Picasso's output was several times more prolific than most artists of his era; by at least one account, American artist Bob Ross is the only one to rival Picasso's volume, and Ross's artwork was designed specifically to be easily mass-produced quickly.\nThe medium in which Picasso made his most important contribution was painting. In his paintings, Picasso used colour as an expressive element, but relied on drawing rather than subtleties of colour to create form and space. He sometimes added sand to his paint to vary its texture. A nanoprobe of Picasso's \"The Red Armchair\" (1931), in the collection of the Art Institute of Chicago, by physicists at Argonne National Laboratory in 2012 confirmed art historians' belief that Picasso used common house paint in many of his paintings. Much of his painting was done at night by artificial light.\nPicasso's early sculptures were carved from wood or modelled in wax or clay, but from 1909 to 1928 Picasso abandoned modelling and instead made sculptural constructions using diverse materials. An example is \"Guitar\" (1912), a relief construction made of sheet metal and wire that Jane Fluegel terms a \"three-dimensional planar counterpart of Cubist painting\" that marks a \"revolutionary departure from the traditional approaches, modeling and carving\".\nFrom the beginning of his career, Picasso displayed an interest in subject matter of every kind, and demonstrated a great stylistic versatility that enabled him to work in several styles at once. For example, his paintings of 1917 included the pointillist \"Woman with a Mantilla\", the Cubist \"Figure in an Armchair\", and the naturalistic \"Harlequin\" (all in the Museu Picasso, Barcelona). In 1919, he made a number of drawings from postcards and photographs that reflect his interest in the stylistic conventions and static character of posed photographs. In 1921 he simultaneously painted several large neoclassical paintings and two versions of the Cubist composition \"Three Musicians\" (Museum of Modern Art, New York; Philadelphia Museum of Art). In an interview published in 1923, Picasso said, \"The several manners I have used in my art must not be considered as an evolution, or as steps towards an unknown ideal of painting ... If the subjects I have wanted to express have suggested different ways of expression I have never hesitated to adopt them.\"\nAlthough his Cubist works approach abstraction, Picasso never relinquished the objects of the real world as subject matter. Prominent in his Cubist paintings are forms easily recognized as guitars, violins, and bottles. When Picasso depicted complex narrative scenes it was usually in prints, drawings, and small-scale works; \"Guernica\" (1937) is one of his few large narrative paintings. \"Guernica\" was on display at the Museum of Modern Art for many years. In 1981, it was returned to Spain and was on exhibit at the Cas\u00f3n del Buen Retiro of the Museo del Prado. In 1992, the painting was put on display in the Reina Sof\u00eda Museum when it opened.\nPicasso painted mostly from imagination or memory. According to William Rubin, Picasso \"could only make great art from subjects that truly involved him ... Unlike Matisse, Picasso had eschewed models virtually all his mature life, preferring to paint individuals whose lives had both impinged on, and had real significance for, his own.\" The art critic Arthur Danto said Picasso's work constitutes a \"vast pictorial autobiography\" that provides some basis for the popular conception that \"Picasso invented a new style each time he fell in love with a new woman\". The autobiographical nature of Picasso's art is reinforced by his habit of dating his works, often to the day. He explained: \"I want to leave to posterity a documentation that will be as complete as possible. That's why I put a date on everything I do.\"\nThe women in Picasso's life played an important role in the emotional and erotic aspects of his creative expression, and the tumultuous nature of these relationships has been considered vital to his artistic process. Many of these women functioned as muses for him, and their inclusion in his extensive oeuvre granted them a place in art history. A largely recurring motif in his body of work is the female form. The variations in his relationships informed and collided with\u00a0his progression of style throughout his career. For example, portraits created of his first wife, Olga, were rendered in a naturalistic style during his Neoclassical period. His relationship with Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Walter inspired many of his surrealist pieces, as well as what is referred to as his \"Year of Wonders\". The reappearance of an acrobats theme in 1905 put an end to his \"Blue Period\", marking the transition into his \"Rose Period\". This transition has been incorrectly attributed to the presence of Fernande Olivier in his life.\nCatalogue raisonn\u00e9.\nPicasso entrusted Christian Zervos to constitute the catalogue raisonn\u00e9 of his work (painted and drawn). The first volume of the catalogue, \"Works from 1895 to 1906\", published in 1932, entailed the financial ruin of Zervos, self-publishing under the name \"Cahiers d'art\", forcing him to sell part of his art collection at auction to avoid bankruptcy.\nFrom 1932 to 1978, Zervos constituted the catalogue raisonn\u00e9 of the complete works of Picasso in the company of the artist who had become one of his friends in 1924. Following the death of Zervos, Mila Gagarin supervised the publication of 11 additional volumes from 1970 to 1978.\nThe 33 volumes cover the entire work from 1895 to 1972, with close to 16,000 black and white photographs, in accord with the will of the artist.\nFurther publications by Zervos\nPersonal life.\nPicasso has been characterized as a womaniser and a misogynist, being quoted as saying to his longtime partner Fran\u00e7oise Gilot that \"women are machines for suffering.\" He later allegedly told her, \"For me there are only two kinds of women: goddesses and doormats.\" In her memoir, \"Picasso, My Grandfather\", Marina Picasso writes of his treatment of women, \"He submitted them to his animal sexuality, tamed them, bewitched them, ingested them, and crushed them onto his canvas. After he had spent many nights extracting their essence, once they were bled dry, he would dispose of them.\" \nFrom early adolescence, Picasso maintained both superficial and intense amatory sexual relationships. Biographer John Richardson stated that 'work, sex, and tobacco' were his addictions. Picasso was married twice and had four children with three women:\nPaulo had 3 children: Pablito Picasso (5 May 1949 \u2013 12 July 1973); Marina Picasso (b. 14 November 1950); Bernard Ruiz-Picasso (b. 3 September 1959)\nMaya had 3 children: Olivier Widmaier Picasso (b. 4 June 1961); Richard Widmaier Picasso (b. 1966); Diana Widmaier Picasso (b. 12 March 1974)\nClaude had 1 child: Jasmin Picasso (b. 1981)\nPicasso married ballet dancer Olga Khokhlova in 1918. In 1935, Picasso began divorce proceedings, but Khokhlova refused to divorce. They legally separated in 1941, but remained married until Khokhlova's death in 1955. \nWhen Picasso's mistress Marie-Th\u00e8r\u00e9se Walter gave birth to their daughter Maya in 1935, he secretly placed them in an apartment at 44 rue de La Bo\u00e9tie in the 8th arrondissement, which was across from his residence with his wife Olga at number 23. In 1937, Marie-Th\u00e8r\u00e9se and Maya were sent to Le Tremblay-sur-Mauldre. Maya was 10 years old when she learned that she had an older brother, Paulo.\nPhotographer and painter Dora Maar was a constant companion and lover of Picasso. The two were closest in the late 1930s and early 1940s, and it was Maar who documented the painting of \"Guernica\".\nIn December 1961, Picasso's children with artist Fran\u00e7oise Gilot, Claude and Paloma, were granted full legal rights to use the name Picasso after their father legally recognized his paternity in a written statement submitted to a French court. However, ten years later, Picasso successfully contested a legal case in which he refused to acknowledge paternity. Three weeks following the 1961 court case, newspapers revealed his second marriage to Jacqueline Roque, a salesgirl at a pottery store. In her 1964 book \"Life with Picasso\", Gilot describes his abusive treatment and myriad infidelities which led her to leave him, taking the children with her in 1953. The book angered Picasso and he severed ties with his children. His strained relationship with Claude and Paloma was never healed. Gilot later stated in an interview with \"The Times\": \nHe was astonishingly creative, so intelligent and seductive. If he was in the mood to charm, even stones would dance to his tune. But he was also cruel, sadistic and merciless to others as well as to himself. Everything had to be his way. You were there for him; he was not there for you. Pablo thought he was God, but he was not God \u2014 and that annoyed him! ... Pablo was the greatest love of my life, but you had to take steps to protect yourself. I did. I left before I was destroyed. The others didn't, they clung on to the mighty Minotaur and paid a heavy price.\nOf the several important women in his life, two of them \u2013 his lover Marie-Th\u00e8r\u00e9se Walter and his second wife Jacqueline Roque \u2013 died by suicide. Others, notably his first wife Olga Khokhlova and lover Dora Maar, succumbed to nervous breakdowns. His grandson, Pablito, died by suicide from ingesting bleach when he was barred by Picasso's widow, Jacqueline, from attending the artist's funeral in 1973. His son, Paulo, died from alcoholism due to depression in 1975. Devastated and lonely after the death of Picasso, Jacqueline fatally shot herself in 1986.\nPolitical views.\nPicasso remained aloof from the Catalan independence movement during his youth, despite expressing general support and being friendly with activists within it. He did not join the armed forces for any side or country during World War I, the Spanish Civil War, or World War II. As a Spanish citizen living in France, Picasso was under no compulsion to fight against the invading Germans in either world war. In 1940, he applied for French citizenship, but it was refused on the grounds of his \"extremist ideas evolving towards communism\". This information was not revealed until 2003.\nAt the start of the Spanish Civil War in 1936, Picasso was 54 years of age. Soon after hostilities began, the Republicans appointed him \"director of the Prado, albeit in absentia\", and \"he took his duties very seriously\", according to John Richardson, supplying the funds to evacuate the museum's collection to Geneva. The war provided the impetus for Picasso's first overtly political work. He expressed anger and condemnation of Francisco Franco and fascists in \"The Dream and Lie of Franco\" (1937), which was produced \"specifically for propagandistic and fundraising purposes\". This surreal fusion of words and images was intended to be sold as a series of postcards to raise funds for the Spanish Republican cause.\nIn 1944, Picasso joined the French Communist Party. He attended the 1948 World Congress of Intellectuals in Defense of Peace in Poland, and in 1950 received the Stalin Peace Prize from the Soviet government. A portrait of Joseph Stalin made by Picasso in 1953 drew Party criticism due to being insufficiently realistic, though he remained a loyal member of the Communist Party until his death. His dealer, D-H. Kahnweiler, a socialist, termed Picasso's communism \"sentimental\" rather than political, saying \"He has never read a line of Karl Marx, nor of Engels of course.\" In a 1945 interview with Jerome Seckler, Picasso stated: \"I am a Communist and my painting is Communist painting. ... But if I were a shoemaker, Royalist or Communist or anything else, I would not necessarily hammer my shoes in a special way to show my politics.\" His commitment to communism, common among continental intellectuals and artists at the time, has long been the subject of some controversy; a notable demonstration thereof was a quote by Salvador Dal\u00ed (with whom Picasso had a rather strained relationship):\n&lt;poem&gt;\"Picasso es pintor, yo tambi\u00e9n; ... Picasso es espa\u00f1ol, yo tambi\u00e9n; Picasso es comunista, yo tampoco.\"\n(Picasso is a painter, so am I; ... Picasso is a Spaniard, so am I; Picasso is a communist, neither am I.)&lt;/poem&gt;\nIn the late 1940s, his old friend surrealist poet Andr\u00e9 Breton, who was a Trotskyist and anti-Stalinist, was more blunt; refusing to shake hands with Picasso, he told him: \"I don't approve of your joining the Communist Party nor with the stand you have taken concerning the purges of the intellectuals after the Liberation.\"\nAs a communist, Picasso opposed the intervention of the United Nations and the United States in the Korean War, and depicted it in \"Massacre in Korea\". The art critic Kirsten Hoving Keen wrote that it was \"inspired by reports of American atrocities\" and considered it one of Picasso's communist works.\nOn 9 January 1949, Picasso created \"Dove\", a black and white lithograph. It was used to illustrate a poster at the 1949 World Peace Council and became an iconographic image of the period, known as \"The dove of peace\". Picasso's image was used around the world as a symbol of the Peace Congresses and communism.\nIn 1962, he received the Lenin Peace Prize. Biographer and art critic John Berger felt his talents as an artist were \"wasted\" by the communists. According to Jean Cocteau's diaries, Picasso once said to him in reference to the communists: \"I have joined a family, and like all families, it's full of shit.\"\nLegacy.\nPicasso's influence was and remains immense and widely acknowledged by his admirers and detractors alike. On the occasion of his 1939 retrospective at New York's Museum of Modern Art, \"Life\" magazine wrote: \"During the 25 years he has dominated modern European art, his enemies say he has been a corrupting influence. With equal violence, his friends say he is the greatest artist alive.\" In 1971, Picasso was the first living artist to receive a special honour exhibition at the Grand Gallery of the Louvre Museum in Paris in celebration of his 90th birthday. In 1998, Robert Hughes wrote of him: \"To say that Pablo Picasso dominated Western art in the 20th century is, by now, the merest commonplace. ... No painter or sculptor, not even Michelangelo, had been as famous as this in his own lifetime. ... Though Marcel Duchamp, that cunning old fox of conceptual irony, has certainly had more influence on nominally vanguard art over the past 30 years than Picasso, the Spaniard was the last great beneficiary of the belief that the language of painting and sculpture really mattered to people other than their devotees.\"\nThe Basel vote.\nIn the 1940s, a Swiss insurance company based in Basel had bought two paintings by Picasso to diversify its investments and serve as a guarantee for the insured risks. Following an air disaster in 1967, the company had to pay out heavy reimbursements. The company decided to part with the two paintings, which were deposited in the Kunstmuseum Basel. In 1968, a large number of Basel citizens called for a local referendum on the purchase of the Picassos by the Canton of Basel-Stadt, which was successful, making it the first time in democratic history that the population of a city voted on the purchase of works of art for a public art museum. The paintings therefore remained in the museum in Basel. Informed of this, Picasso donated three paintings and a sketch to the city and its museum and was later made an honorary citizen by the city.\nMuseums.\nAt the time of Picasso's death many of his paintings were in his possession, as he had kept off the art market what he did not need to sell. In addition, Picasso had a considerable collection of the work of other famous artists, some his contemporaries, such as Henri Matisse, with whom he had exchanged works. Since Picasso left no will, his death duties (estate tax) to the French state were paid in the form of his works and others from his collection. These works form the core of the immense and representative collection of the Mus\u00e9e Picasso in Paris.\nIn 2003, relatives of Picasso inaugurated a museum dedicated to him in his birthplace, M\u00e1laga, Spain, the Museo Picasso M\u00e1laga.\nThe Museu Picasso in Barcelona features many of his early works, created while he was living in Spain, including many rarely seen works which reveal his firm grounding in classical techniques. The museum also holds many precise and detailed figure studies done in his youth under his father's tutelage, as well as the extensive collection of Jaime Sabart\u00e9s, his close friend and personal secretary.\nIn 1985, Museum Picasso Eugenio Arias' Collection established in Buitrago del Lozoya by Picasso's friend Eugenio Arias Herranz.\nOn 8 October 2010, \"Picasso: Masterpieces from the Mus\u00e9e National Picasso, Paris,\" an exhibition of 150 paintings, sculptures, drawings, prints and photographs from the Mus\u00e9e National Picasso in Paris, opened at the Seattle Art Museum, Seattle, Washington, US. The exhibition subsequently travelled to the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts, Richmond, Virginia: the M.H. de Young Memorial Museum, San Francisco, California, US.; the Art Gallery of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia; and the Art Gallery of Ontario, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.\nIt was announced on 22 September 2020 that the project for a new Picasso Museum due to open in Aix-en-Provence in 2021, in a former convent (Couvent des Pr\u00eacheurs), which would have held the largest collection of his paintings of any museum, had been scrapped due to the fact that Catherine Hutin-Blay, Jacqueline Picasso's daughter, and the City Council had failed to reach an agreement.\nAs of 2015[ [update]], Picasso remained the top-ranked artist (based on sales of his works at auctions) according to the Art Market Trends report. More of his paintings have been stolen than those of any other artist; in 2012, the Art Loss Register had 1,147 of his works listed as stolen. \nThe Picasso Administration.\nPicasso's heirs formed a committee to formally authenticate his works at the beginning of the 1980s. However, disagreements regarding the legitimacy of a series of drawings led to the dissolution of the committee in 1993. Two of the children, Claude and Maya, began issuing authenticity certificates separately. Dealers claim that this has resulted in a situation that has been difficult and time-consuming, especially since auction houses were increasingly requesting certifications from both heirs due to the dual (and competing) authentication methods.\nIn 2012, four of Picasso's five surviving heirs\u2014Claude, Paloma Picasso, Bernard Ruiz-Picasso, and Marina Ruiz-Picasso\u2014established the Picasso Administration to authenticate works by the artist. They announced that Claude should now be the recipient of all authentication requests, adding that \"only his opinions shall be fully and officially acknowledged by the undersigned.\" Claude served as legal administrator of the estate from 1989 until 2023, when his sister Paloma took over.\nThe Picasso Administration also manages the Picasso estate. The US copyright representative for the Picasso Administration is the Artists Rights Society.\nAuction history.\nSeveral paintings by Picasso rank among the most expensive paintings in the world. \"Gar\u00e7on \u00e0 la pipe\" sold for US$104\u00a0million at Sotheby's on 4 May 2004. \"Dora Maar au Chat\" sold for US$95.2\u00a0million at Sotheby's on 3 May 2006. On 4 May 2010, \"Nude, Green Leaves and Bust\" was sold at Christie's for US$106.5\u00a0million. The 1932 work, which depicts Picasso's mistress Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Walter reclining and as a bust, was in the personal collection of Los Angeles philanthropist Frances Lasker Brody, who died in November 2009. On 11 May 2015 his painting \"Women of Algiers\" set the record for the highest price ever paid for a painting when it sold for US$179.3\u00a0million at Christie's in New York.\nOn 21 June 2016, a painting by Pablo Picasso titled \"Femme Assise\" (1909) sold for \u00a343.2\u00a0million ($63.4\u00a0million) at Sotheby's London, exceeding the estimate by nearly $20\u00a0million, setting a world record for the highest price ever paid at auction for a Cubist work.\nOn 17 May 2017, \"The Jerusalem Post\" in an article titled \"Picasso Work Stolen By Nazis Sells for $45 Million at Auction\" reported the sale of a portrait painted by Picasso, the 1939 \"Femme assise, robe bleu\", which was previously misappropriated during the early years of WWII. The painting has changed hands several times since its recovery, most recently through auction in May 2017 at Christie's in New York City.\nIn March 2018, his \"Femme au B\u00e9ret et \u00e0 la Robe Quadrill\u00e9e\" (1937), a portrait of Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Walter, sold for \u00a349.8m at Sotheby's in London.\nIn pop culture.\nIn the 1996 movie \"Surviving Picasso\", Picasso is portrayed by actor Anthony Hopkins. Picasso is also a character in Steve Martin's 1993 play, \"Picasso at the Lapin Agile\". In \"A Moveable Feast\" by Ernest Hemingway, Hemingway tells Gertrude Stein that he would like to have some Picassos, but cannot afford them. Later in the book, Hemingway mentions looking at one of Picasso's paintings. He refers to it as Picasso's nude of the girl with the basket of flowers, possibly related to \"Young Naked Girl with Flower Basket\".\nPicasso is portrayed by Antonio Banderas in the of \"Genius\", which focuses on his life and art.\nIn the 2011 film \"Midnight in Paris\", which was directed by Woody Allen, Picasso (portrayed by Marcial Di Fonzo Bo) appears as a member of the 1920s Parisian art circles.\nNotes and references.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "24178", "revid": "48721835", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24178", "title": "Palm Sunday", "text": "Christian moveable feast preceding Easter\nPalm Sunday is the Christian moveable feast that falls on the Sunday before Easter. The feast commemorates Christ's triumphal entry into Jerusalem, an event mentioned in each of the four canonical Gospels. Its name originates from the palm branches waved by the crowd to greet and honor Jesus Christ as he entered the city. Palm Sunday marks the first day of Holy Week; in Western Christianity, this is the beginning of the last week of the solemn season of Lent, preceding Eastertide, while in Eastern Christianity, Holy Week commences after the conclusion of Great Lent.\nIn most Christian rites, Palm Sunday is celebrated by the blessing and distribution of palm branches (or the branches of other native trees), representing the palm branches that the crowd scattered before Christ as he rode into Jerusalem. These palms are sometimes woven into crosses. The difficulty of procuring palms in unfavorable climates led to the substitution of branches of native trees, including box, olive, willow, and yew.\nMany churches of mainstream Christian denominations, including the Orthodox, Catholic, Lutheran, Methodist, Anglican, Moravian, and Reformed traditions, distribute palm branches to their congregations during their Palm Sunday liturgies. Christians take these palms, which are often blessed by clergy, to their homes, where they hang them alongside Christian art (especially crosses and crucifixes) or keep them in their Bibles and daily devotional books. In the days preceding the next year's Lent in Western Christianity, known as Carnival or Shrovetide, churches often place a basket in their narthex to collect these palms, which are then ritually burned on Shrove Tuesday to make the ashes to be used on the following day, Ash Wednesday, which is the first day of Lent. In Eastern Christianity, where Ash Wednesday is non-existent, it is typical to return the Palms the following Palm Sunday prior to receiving new Palms. \nBiblical basis and symbolism.\nIn the accounts of the four canonical Gospels, Christ's triumphal entry into Jerusalem takes place a week before his resurrection. Only the Gospel of John shows a timeline of the event, dated six days before the Passover.\nThe raising of Lazarus is mentioned only by the Gospel of John, in the previous chapter. The Eastern Orthodox Church and the Eastern Catholic Churches which follows the Byzantine Rite, commemorate it on Lazarus Saturday, following the text of the Gospel. In fact, the Jewish calendar dates begin at sundown of the night beforehand, and conclude at nightfall.\nThe Gospel of Matthew states that this happened that the prophecy might be fulfilled of: Zechariah 9:9 \"The Coming of Zion's King \u2013 See, your king comes to you, righteous and victorious, lowly and riding on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a donkey\". It suggests that Jesus was declaring he was the King of Israel.\nAccording to the Gospels, Jesus Christ rode on a donkey into Jerusalem, and the celebrating people there laid down their cloaks and small branches of trees in front of him, singing part of Psalm 118: 25\u201326 \u2013 Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord. We bless you from the house of the Lord.\nThe symbolism of the donkey may refer to the Eastern tradition that it is an animal of peace, unlike the horse which is the animal of war. A king would have ridden a horse when he was bent on war and ridden a donkey to symbolize his arrival in peace. Christ's entry to Jerusalem would have thus symbolized his entry as the Prince of Peace, not as a war-waging king. Thus there have been two different meanings (or more levels of biblical hermeneutics): an historical meaning, truly happening according to the Gospels, and a secondary meaning in the symbolism.\nIn Luke 19:41 as Jesus approaches Jerusalem, he looks at the city and weeps over it (an event known as \"Flevit super illam\" in Latin), foretelling his coming Passion and the suffering that awaits the city in the events of the destruction of the Second Temple.\nIn many lands in the ancient Near East, it was customary to cover in some way the path of someone thought worthy of the highest honour. The Hebrew Bible reports that Jehu, son of Jehoshaphat, was treated this way. Both the Synoptic Gospels and the Gospel of John report that people gave Jesus this form of honour. In the synoptics the people are described as laying their garments and cut rushes on the street, whereas John specifies fronds of palm (Greek \"phoinix)\". In Jewish tradition, the palm is one of the Four Species carried for Sukkot, as prescribed for rejoicing in Leviticus 23:40.\nIn the Greco-Roman culture of the Roman Empire, which strongly influenced Christian tradition, the palm branch was a symbol of triumph and victory. It became the most common attribute of the goddess Nike or Victoria. For contemporary Roman observers, the procession would have evoked the Roman triumph, when the \"triumphator\" laid down his arms and wore the toga, the civilian garment of peace that might be ornamented with emblems of the palm.\nAlthough the Epistles of Paul refer to Jesus as \"triumphing\", the entry into Jerusalem may not have been regularly pictured as a triumphal procession in this sense before the 13th century. In ancient Egyptian religion, the palm was carried in funeral processions and represented eternal life. The martyr's palm was later used as a symbol of Christian martyrs and their spiritual victory or triumph over death. In Revelation 7:9, the white-clad multitude stand before the throne and Lamb holding palm branches.\nObservance in the liturgy.\nEastern and Oriental Christianity.\nPalm Sunday, or the \"Entry of the Lord into Jerusalem\" as it may be called in Orthodox Churches, is one of the Twelve Great Feasts of the liturgical year. The day before Palm Sunday, Lazarus Saturday, believers often prepare palm fronds by knotting them into crosses in preparation for the procession on Sunday. The hangings and vestments in the church are changed to a festive color \u2013 most commonly green.\nThe Troparion of the Feast (a short hymn) indicates that the resurrection of Lazarus is a prefiguration of Christ's Resurrection:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;&lt;poem&gt;O Christ our God\nWhen Thou didst raise Lazarus from the dead before Thy Passion,\nThou didst confirm the resurrection of the universe.\nWherefore, we, like children,\ncarry the banner of triumph and victory,\nand we cry to Thee, O Conqueror of death,\nHosanna in the highest!\nBlessed is He that cometh\nin the Name of the Lord.&lt;/poem&gt;\nIn the Russian Orthodox Church, Ukrainian Orthodox Church, Ukrainian Catholic Church, Ruthenian Catholic Church, Polish, Bavarian and Austrian Roman Catholics, and various other Eastern European peoples, the custom developed of using pussy willow and other twigs like box tree instead of palm fronds because the latter are not readily available that far north. There is no canonical requirement as to what kind of branches must be used, so some Orthodox believers use olive branches.\nWhatever the kind, these branches are blessed and distributed together with candles either during the All-Night Vigil on the Eve of the Feast (Saturday night), or before the Divine Liturgy on Sunday morning. The Great Entrance of the Divine Liturgy commemorates the \"Entry of the Lord into Jerusalem\", so the meaningfulness of this moment is punctuated on Palm Sunday as everyone stands, holding their branches and lit candles. The faithful take these branches and candles home with them after the liturgy, and keep them in their icon corner as an \"evloghia\" (blessing).\nIn Russia, donkey walk processions took place in different cities, but most importantly in Novgorod and, from 1558 until 1693, in Moscow. These were prominently featured in testimonies by foreign witnesses and mentioned in contemporary Western maps of the city. The Patriarch of Moscow, representing Christ, rode on a \"donkey\", actually a horse draped in white cloth. The Tsar of Russia humbly led the procession on foot. Originally, Moscow processions began inside the Kremlin and terminated at Trinity Church, now known as Saint Basil's Cathedral. In 1658 Patriarch Nikon reversed the order of procession. Peter I in the 1720s, as a part of his nationalisation of the church, terminated the custom. It has been occasionally recreated in the 21st century.\nIn Oriental Orthodox churches, palm fronds are distributed at the front of the church at the sanctuary steps. In India the sanctuary itself is strewn with marigolds, and the congregation proceeds through and outside the church.\nWestern Christianity.\nIn ancient times, palm branches symbolized goodness and victory. They were often depicted on coins and important buildings. Solomon had palm branches carved into the walls and doors of the temple. Again at the end of the Bible, people from every nation raise palm branches to honor Jesus.\nPalm Sunday commemorates the entrance of Christ into Jerusalem, during which palm branches were placed in his path, before his arrest on Holy Thursday and his crucifixion on Good Friday. It thus marks the beginning of Holy Week, the final week of Lent.\nIn churches of many Christian denominations, members of the congregation, oftentimes children, are given palms that they carry as they walk in a procession around the inside of the church. In the Church of Pakistan, a united Protestant Church, the faithful on Palm Sunday carry palm branches into the church as they sing Psalm 24. A robust hymnody has developed for Palm Sunday, including \"Hosanna, Loud Hosanna\", \"Ride On, Ride On in Majesty!\", \"All Glory, Laud and Honour\", \"Palms of Victory\", and \"Hark the glad sound! the Saviour comes\".\nIn the Roman Catholic Church, as well as among many Lutheran and Anglican congregations, palm fronds (or in colder climates some kind of substitutes) are blessed with holy water outside the church building (or in cold climates in the narthex when Easter falls early in the year) in an event called the Blessing of the Palms. A solemn procession of the entire congregation takes place immediately after the blessing of the palms, called the Palm procession.\nIn the Catholic, Lutheran, and Anglican traditions, this feast now coincides with that of Passion Sunday, which is the focus of the Mass which follows the procession. The Catholic Church considers the blessed palms to be sacramentals. The vestments for the day are deep scarlet red, the colour of blood, indicating the supreme redemptive sacrifice Christ was entering the city to make, to fulfill his passion and resurrection in Jerusalem.\nIn the Lutheran Churches, as well as in the Episcopal/Anglican churches, the day is officially called \"The Sunday of the Passion: Palm Sunday\"; in practice, though, it is usually termed \"Palm Sunday\" as in the 1928 American Book of Common Prayer and in earlier Lutheran liturgies and calendars, to avoid undue confusion with the penultimate Sunday of Lent in the traditional calendar, which was \"Passion Sunday\".\nIn traditional usage of the Methodist Church, \"The Book of Worship for Church and Home\" (1965) provides the following Collect for Palm Sunday:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCustoms.\nIt is customary in many churches for worshippers to receive fresh palm leaves on Palm Sunday. In parts of the world where this has historically been impractical, substitute traditions have arisen.\nBelgium.\nIn Hoegaarden, one of the last remaining Palm Sunday processions takes place every year. A fellowship of Twelve Apostles carries a wooden statue of Christ around the town, while children go door to door offering the palms (box) for coins.\nBulgaria.\nIn Bulgaria, Palm Sunday is known as \"Tsvetnitsa\" (, \"flower\") or \"Vrabnitsa\" (\"varba\", \"willow\"), or Flower's Day. People with flower-related names (e.g., Bilyan(a), Liliya, Margarita, Nevena, Ralitsa, Rosa, Temenuzhka, Tsvetan(a), Tsvetelin(a), Tsvetin(a), Tsvetko, Violeta, Yavor, Zdravko, Zjumbjul, etc.) celebrate this day as their name day.\nEngland.\nIn the 15th through the 17th centuries in England, Palm Sunday was frequently marked by the burning of Jack o' Lent figures. This was a straw effigy which would be stoned and abused on Ash Wednesday, and kept in the parish for burning on Palm Sunday. The symbolism was believed to be a kind of revenge on Judas Iscariot, who had betrayed Christ. The effigy could also have represented the hated figure of Winter, whose destruction prepares the way for Spring.\nEgypt and Ethiopia.\nIn the Coptic Orthodox Church and Orthodox Ethiopia, this holiday is referred to as Hosanna. Palm leaves will be blessed and distributed, they are used to create crucifixes, rings and other ornaments.\nFinland.\nIn Finland, it is popular for children to dress up as Easter witches and go door to door in neighborhoods and trade decorated pussy willow branches for coins and candy. This is an old Karelian custom called \"virpominen\".\nIt is customary for the children to chant, with some variation, \"Virvon varvon tuoreeks, terveeks, tulevaks vuodeks, vitsa sulle, palkka mulle!\" which very roughly translates as \"I'm wishing you a fresh, healthy upcoming year, a branch for you, a prize for me!\" The chant has been translated in Juha Vuorinen's novel \"Totally Smashed!\" as \"Willow switch, I'm the Easter witch! I wish you health and a love that's rich! From me I bring some luck today, for this branch what will you pay?\"\nGermany.\nIn some regions of Germany, long stakes with pussy willow, box and other twigs are taken for the Palm procession rather than nosegays. In some Southern regions either the priest leads the palm procession, riding on a donkey, or a wooden donkey (called \"Palmesel\") with a figure of Christ is traditionally trundled with the procession of the faithful.\nIndia.\nIn most of the Catholic churches in India the palms are blessed by the priest on Palm Sunday and then distributed among the people after the holy mass. There is a tradition of folding palm fronds into palm crosses, which are kept at the altar till the next Ash Wednesday.\nIn the South Indian state of Kerala (and in Indian Orthodox, Church of South India (CSI), Syro-Malankara Catholic Church, and Syriac Orthodox Church (Jacobite) congregations elsewhere in India and throughout the world), flowers are strewn about the sanctuary on Palm Sunday during the reading of the Gospel, at the words uttered by the crowd welcoming Jesus, \"Hosanna! Blessed is he who is come and is to come in the name of the Lord God\". These words are read to the congregation thrice. The congregation then repeats, \"Hosanna!\", and the flowers are scattered, a common custom in Indian celebrations. This symbolizes Jesus' triumphant entry into Jerusalem.\nIndian Orthodoxy traces its roots to the arrival in India of Saint Thomas the Apostle (traditionally dated to AD 52) and his evangelism among both the Brahmans of the Malabar Coast and the ancient Jewish community there. Its rites and ceremonies are Jewish, Indian and Levantine Christian, in origin. In Syro-Malabar Catholic Church's palm leaves are blessed during Palm Sunday ceremony and a Procession takes place holding the palms.\nIreland.\nIn Ireland's cold climate, real palm leaves are generally not available, so yew, silver fir, spruce or cypress are used instead; it is known in Irish as \"Domhnach an I\u00fair\", \"Yew Sunday.\" The historian Patrick Weston Joyce noted that yew was always called \"palm\" in his 1830s childhood, and he only later learned the tree's correct name. \"Palm\" branches were often worn in the buttonhole or hung on the wall; the second practise is still common, and palm branches are blessed with holy water at Catholic Masses.\nIn the past in some areas, a palm stem was charred and a cross was marked on eggs set for hatching, while in parts of Counties Galway and Mayo, shredded palm was mixed through the seed grain. The coincidence of Palm Sunday and Saint Patrick's Day (March 17), \"when the shamrock and the palm are worn together,\" was said to presage a great event; this last happened in 1940, at the beginning of the Second World War, and will not reoccur until 2391.\nItaly.\nIn Italy, palm leaves are used along with small olive branches, readily available in the Mediterranean climate. These are placed at house entrances (for instance, hanging above the door) to last until the following year's Palm Sunday. For this reason, usually palm leaves are not used whole, due to their size; instead, leaf strips are braided into smaller shapes. Small olive branches are also often used to decorate traditional Easter cakes, along with other symbols of birth, like eggs.\nLatvia.\nIn Latvia, Palm Sunday is called \"Pussy Willow Sunday\", and pussy willows \u2013 symbolizing new life \u2013 are blessed and distributed to the faithful. Children are often awakened that morning with ritualistic swats of a willow branch.\nLithuania.\nWhen Christianity came to Lithuania, the plants which sprouted earliest were honored during spring feasts. The name \"Palm Sunday\" is a misnomer; the \"verba\" or \"dwarfed spruce\" is used instead. According to tradition, on the Saturday before Palm Sunday the Lithuanians take special care in choosing and cutting well-formed branches, which the women-folk decorate with flowers. The flowers are meticulously tied onto the branches, making the \"Verba\".\nThe Levant.\nIn Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Palestine, and Syria, Palm Sunday (\"Shaa'nineh\" in Arabic) Is perhaps the best-attended liturgy in the Christian Calendar, among the Orthodox, Catholic (Latin and Eastern), and Anglican Churches, perhaps because it is notably a family occasion. On this day, children attend church with branches from olive and palm trees. Also, there will be carefully woven crosses and other symbols made from palm fronds and roses and a procession at the beginning of the liturgy, during which at some point, the priest will take an olive branch and splash holy water on the faithful.\nMalta.\nAll the parishes of Malta and Gozo on Palm Sunday (Maltese: \"\u0126add il-Palm\") bless the palm leaves and the olive leaves. Those parishes that have the statues of Good Friday bless the olive tree they put on the statues of \"Jesus prays in the Olive Garden\" (\"\u0120es\u00f9 fl-Ort\") and the \"Betrayal of Judas\" (\"il-Bewsa ta' \u0120uda\"). Also, many people take a small olive branch to their homes because it is a sacramental.\nNetherlands.\nIn the Saxon regions of the Netherlands, crosses are decorated with candy and bread, made in the form of a rooster. In the Diocese of Groningen-Leeuwarden, a great procession with oil lamps is held the night before Palm Sunday in honour of the Sorrowful Mother of Warfhuizen.\nPhilippines.\nIn the Philippines, a statue of Christ riding a donkey (the \"Humenta\"), or the presiding priest on horseback, is brought to the local church in a morning procession. Congregants line the route, waving \"palasp\u00e1s\" (ornately woven palm branches) and spreading \"tapis\" (heirloom \"aprons\" made for this ritual) in imitation of the excited Jerusalemites. At the church parvise, a house, or the town plaza, children dressed as angels scatter flowers as they sing the day's antiphon \"Hosanna filio David\" in the vernacular and to traditional tunes. The first Mass of the day then follows.\nOnce blessed, the \"palasp\u00e1s\" are brought home and placed on altars, doorways, and windows. The Church teaches that this is a sign of welcoming Christ into the home, but folk belief holds that the blessed \"palasp\u00e1s\" are apotropaic, deterring evil spirits, lightning, and fires. Another folk custom is to feed pieces of blessed \"palasp\u00e1s\" to roosters used in \"sabong\" (cockfighting); this was strongly discouraged by the Archbishop of Manila, Cardinal Luis Antonio Tagle. In other provinces, the flowers strewn by the angels during the procession are added to the rice seeds being planted, in the belief that these will ensure a bountiful harvest.\nPoland.\nMany Polish towns and villages organize decorated Easter palm competitions: the best known are Lipnica Murowana in Lesser Poland and \u0141yse in Mazovia. The biggest of those reach above in length; for example, the highest palm in 2008 was .\nRomania and Moldova.\nIn Romania and Moldova, Palm Sunday is known as \"Duminica Floriilor\" or simply \"Florii\", translating \"Flowers' Sunday\". This name has its roots in a pre-Christian fertility festival, where flowers played a prominent role.\nSpain.\nIn Spain, there is a tradition at the Palmeral of Elche (Europe's largest palm grove) in which local people cover palm leaves from the sun to allow them to whiten, and then they tie and braid them into intricate shapes.\nA Spanish rhyming proverb states: \"Domingo de Ramos, quien no estrena algo, se le caen las manos\" (\"On Palm Sunday, the hands drop off of those who fail to wear something new\"). On Palm Sunday, it is customary to don new clothing or shoes.\nSyria.\nIn Syria, it is popular for children to go door to door in neighborhoods, chanting about Lazarus' rising from the dead, for which they are given coins or eggs.\nWales.\nIn southern Wales and nearby portions of England, 'Sul y Blodau' or 'Flowering Sunday' is a grave decoration tradition commonly observed on Palm Sunday, although historically Flowering Sunday grave decoration was also observed on other days as well. Today, the names Palm Sunday and Flowering Sunday are used interchangeably in those regions. In 1829, Thomas Wallace of Llanbadoc, Monmouthshire published a poem which contains the first known reference to the custom being practiced only on Palm Sunday.\nWelsh cemetery cleaning and decoration traditions may have begun as an Easter celebration before becoming more commonly associated with Palm Sunday. As early as 1786, cleaning and flower decorations were attested by William Matthews during a tour of South Wales. Richard Warner attested in 1797 \"the ornamenting of the graves of the deceased with various plants and flowers, at certain seasons, by the surviving relatives\" and noted that Easter was the most popular time for this tradition. By 1803, Malkin's observations in \"The Scenery, Antiquities, and Biography of South Wales from materials collected during two excursions in the year 1803\" reflect the shift away predominantly associating the custom with Easter.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n! colspan=\"3\" style=\"border-top: 5px solid #c00;\" | Sundays of the Easter cycle"}

This school of thought interprets the Book of Daniel as referring to events that happened from the seventh century BC until the first century AD, while seeing the prophecies of the Book of Revelation, as well as Christ's predictions within the Olivet Discourse, as events that happened in the first century AD. Preterism holds that Ancient Israel finds its continuation or fulfillment in the Christian church at the destruction of Jerusalem in AD\u00a070.\nThe term \"preterism\" comes from the Latin , which is a prefix denoting that something is 'past' or 'beyond'. Adherents of preterism are known as preterists. Preterism teaches that either all (full preterism) or a majority (partial preterism) of the Olivet Discourse had come to pass by AD\u00a070.\nHistorically, preterists and non-preterists have generally agreed that the Jesuit Luis de Alcasar (1554\u20131613) wrote the first systematic preterist exposition of prophecy , published during the Counter-Reformation.\nHistory.\nAt the time of the Counter-Reformation, the Jesuit Luis de Alcasar wrote a prominent preterist exposition of prophecy. Moses Stuart noted in 1845 that Alcasar's preterist interpretation advantaged the Roman Catholic Church during its arguments with Protestants, and Kenneth Newport in an eschatological commentary in 2000 described preterism as a Catholic defense against the Protestant historicist view which identified the Roman Catholic Church as a persecuting apostasy.\nDue to resistance from Protestant historicists, the preterist view was slow to gain acceptance outside the Roman Catholic Church. Among Protestants preterism was first accepted by Hugo Grotius (1583\u20131645), a Dutch Protestant eager to establish common ground between Protestants and the Roman Catholic Church. His first attempt to do this in his \"Commentary on Certain Texts Which Deal with Antichrist\" (1640) arguing that the texts relating to Antichrist had had their fulfillment in the 1st century AD. Protestants did not welcome these views but Grotius remained undeterred and in his next work, \"Commentaries On The New Testament\" (1641\u20131650), he expanded his preterist views to include the Olivet Discourse and the Book of Revelation.\nPreterism continued to struggle to gain credibility within other Protestant communities, especially in England. The English commentator Thomas Hayne claimed in 1645 that the prophecies of the Book of Daniel had all been fulfilled by the 1st century,\nand Joseph Hall expressed the same conclusion concerning Daniel's prophecies in 1650,\nbut neither of them applied a preterist approach to Revelation. However, the exposition of Grotius convinced the Englishman Henry Hammond (1605\u20131660). Hammond sympathized with Grotius' desire for unity among Christians, and found his preterist exposition useful to this end. Hammond wrote his own preterist exposition in 1653, borrowing extensively from Grotius. In his introduction to Revelation he claimed that others had independently arrived at similar conclusions as himself, though giving pride of place to Grotius. Hammond was Grotius' only notable Protestant convert, and despite his reputation and influence, Protestants overwhelmingly rejected Grotius' interpretation of Revelation, which gained no ground for at least 100 years.\nBy the end of the 18th century preterist exposition had gradually become more widespread. In 1730 the Protestant and Arian, Frenchman Firmin Abauzit wrote the first full preterist exposition, \"Essai sur l'Apocalypse\". Abauzit worked in the then independent Republic of Geneva as a librarian. This was part of a growing development of more systematic preterist expositions of Revelation. Later, though, it appears that Abauzit recanted this approach after a critical examination by his English translator, Leonard Twells.\nThe earliest American full-preterist work, \"The Second Advent of the Lord Jesus Christ: A Past Event\", was written in 1845 by Robert Townley. Townley later recanted this view.\nSchools of preterist thought.\nThe two principal schools of preterist thought are commonly called \"partial preterism\" and \"full preterism\". Preterists disagree significantly about the exact meaning of the terms used to denote these divisions of preterist thought.\nSome partial preterists prefer to call their position \"orthodox preterism\", thus contrasting their agreement with the creeds of the Ecumenical Councils with what they perceive to be the full preterists' rejection of the same. This, in effect, makes full preterism unorthodox in the eyes of partial preterists and gives rise to the claim by some that full preterism is heretical. Partial preterism is also sometimes called \"orthodox preterism\", \"classical preterism\" or \"moderate preterism\".\nOn the other hand, some full preterists prefer to call their position \"consistent preterism\", reflecting their extension of preterism to \"all\" biblical prophecy and thus claiming an inconsistency in the partial preterist hermeneutic.\nSub-variants of preterism include a form of partial preterism which places fulfillment of some eschatological passages in the first three centuries of the current era, culminating in the fall of Rome. In addition, certain statements from classical theological liberalism are easily mistaken for preterism, as they hold that the biblical record accurately reflects Jesus' and the Apostles' belief that all prophecy would be fulfilled within their generation. Theological liberalism generally regards these apocalyptic expectations as being errant or mistaken, however, so this view cannot accurately be considered a form of preterism.\nPartial preterism.\nPartial preterism (often referred to as \"orthodox preterism\" or \"classical preterism\") may hold that most eschatological prophecies, such as the destruction of Jerusalem, the Antichrist, the Great Tribulation, and the advent of the Day of the Lord as a \"judgment-coming\" of Christ, were fulfilled either in AD\u00a070 or during the persecution of Christians under the Emperor Nero.\nSome partial preterists may believe that the Antichrist, the Great Tribulation, and the advent of the Day of the Lord as a \"judgment-coming\" of Christ, were not historically fulfilled.\nSome partial preterists identify \"Babylon the Great\" (Revelation 17\u201318) with the pagan Roman Empire, though some, such as N.T. Wright, Scott Hahn, Jimmy Akin, David Chilton, and Kenneth Gentry identify it with the city of Jerusalem. Most interpretations identify Nero as the Beast, while his mark is often interpreted as the stamped image of the emperor's head on every coin of the Roman Empire: the stamp on the hand or in the mind of all, without which no one could buy or sell. Another partial preterist view regards first and second century events as recurrent patterns with Nero and Bar Kochba presented as archetypes. There is evidence that the epithet of Bar Kochba is a play on the Hebrew \"Shema\" with the value equating to the gematria value of 666. The pun on his patronymic equates to the variant reading 616. However, others believe the Book of Revelation was written after Nero's suicide in AD\u00a068, and identify the Beast with another emperor. The \"Catholic Encyclopedia\" states that Revelation was \"written during the latter part of the reign of the Roman Emperor Domitian, probably in AD\u00a095 or 96\". Many Protestant scholars agree. The Second Coming, resurrection of the dead, and Final Judgment however, have not yet occurred in the partial preterist system.\nFull preterism.\nFull preterism differs from partial preterism in that full preterists believe that the destruction of Jerusalem fulfilled \"all\" eschatological or \"end times\" events, including the resurrection of the dead and Jesus's Second Coming, or \"Parousia\", and the Final Judgment.\nOther names of full preterism include:\nFull preterists argue that a literal reading of Matthew 16:28 (where Jesus tells the disciples that some of them will not taste death until they see him coming in his kingdom) places the second coming in the first century. This precludes a physical second coming of Christ. Instead, the second coming is symbolic of a \"judgment\" against Jerusalem, said to have taken place with the destruction of the temple in Jerusalem in AD\u00a070. For this reason, those who oppose the notion also call full preterism \"the AD\u00a070 doctrine\", since the whole eschatology is hinged on this one event. R. C. Sproul said of full preterist Max R. King, \"for this schema to work, the traditional idea of resurrection must be replaced with a metaphorical idea of resurrection\". Detractors of full preterism often refer to the school as \"hyper-preterism\".\nIn recent years full preterism has divided into sub-groups. An important offshoot that differs markedly from the theology of Max King and Don K. Preston is the Individual Body View (IBV) of full preterism. The term refers to a belief in a rapture of individuals that occurred in AD\u00a066 (not AD 70), an event that first involved an experiential change into spiritual bodies. This is counter to the Max King variant of full preterism, the Corporate Body View (CBV), which Edward E. Stevens, debating against that view, defines as \"a spiritual-only change of status for a collective body, and that it had absolutely nothing to do with the resurrection of individual disembodied souls out of Hades to receive their new immortal bodies and go to heaven where their fellowship with God was eternally restored.\" A more recent reaction within full preterism is in adopting the term \"Bible Preterism\" to reassert basic Gospel doctrines such as salvation and forgiveness being available from the time of Calvary, a tenet that Don K. Preston denies, asserting these were only available in AD 70.\nInfluences within Christian thought.\nPartial preterism is generally considered to be a historic orthodox interpretation as it affirms all eschatological points of the ecumenical Creeds of the Church. Still, partial preterism is not the majority view among American denominations founded after 1500 and meets with significant vocal opposition, especially by those denominations which espouse dispensationalism. Additionally, dispensationalists are concerned that partial preterism logically leads to an acceptance of full preterism, a concern which is denied by partial preterists.\nFull preterism is sometimes viewed as heretical, based upon the historic creeds of the church (which would exclude this view), and also from biblical passages that condemn a past view of the resurrection or the denial of a physical resurrection or transformation of the body \u2013doctrines which most Christians believe to be essential to the faith. Critics of full preterism point to Paul the Apostle's condemnation of the doctrine of Hymenaeus and Philetus, which they regard as analogous to full preterism. Adherents of full preterism, however, dispute this assertion by pointing out that Paul's condemnation was written during a time in which (their idea of) the resurrection was still in the future (i.e., pre-AD 70). Their critics assert that if the Resurrection has not yet happened, then the condemnation would still apply.\nInterpretation of the Book of Revelation.\nPreterism holds that the contents of Revelation constitute a prophecy of events that were fulfilled in the first century. Preterists believe that the dating of the book of Revelation is of vital importance and that it was written before the destruction of Jerusalem in AD\u00a070. Preterism was first expounded by the Jesuit Luis de Alcasar during the Counter-Reformation. The preterist view served to bolster the Catholic Church's position against attacks by Protestants, who identified the Pope with the Antichrist.\nInterpretation of the Great Tribulation.\nIn the preterist view, the Tribulation took place in the past when Roman legions destroyed Jerusalem and its temple in AD 70 during the end stages of the First Jewish\u2013Roman War, and it affected only the Jewish people rather than all mankind.\nChristian preterists believe that the Tribulation was a divine judgment visited upon the Jews for their sins, including rejection of Jesus as the promised Messiah. It occurred entirely in the past, around 70 AD when the armed forces of the Roman Empire destroyed Jerusalem and its temple.\nA preterist discussion of the Tribulation has its focus on the Gospels, in particular the prophetic passages in Matthew 24, Mark 13, Luke 21, and the Olivet Discourse, rather than on the Book of Revelation. Most preterists apply much of the symbolism in Revelation to Rome, the Caesars, and their persecution of Christians, rather than to the Tribulation upon the Jews.\nJesus's warning in Matthew 24:34 that \"this generation shall not pass until all these things be fulfilled\" is tied back to his similar warning to the scribes and the Pharisees that their judgment would \"come upon this generation\", that is, during the first century rather than at a future time long after the scribes and Pharisees had died. The destruction in AD\u00a070 occurred within a 40-year biblical generation from the time when Jesus gave that discourse. Preterism maintains that the judgment on the Jewish nation was executed by the Roman legions, \"the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet.\" This can also be found in Luke 21:20.\nSince Matthew 24 begins with Jesus visiting the Jerusalem Temple and pronouncing that \"there shall not be left here one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down\" (vs. 3), preterists see nothing in scripture to indicate that another Jewish temple will ever be built. The prophecies were all fulfilled against the temple of that time, which was subsequently destroyed within that generation.\nKey verses.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;When they persecute you in one town, flee to the next; for truly I tell you, you will not have gone through all the towns of Israel before the Son of Man comes.\u2014\u200a\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;But truly I tell you, there are some standing here who will not taste death before they see the kingdom of God.\u2014\u200a\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;for these are days of vengeance, as a fulfillment of all that is written.\u2014\u200a\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Truly I tell you, there are some standing here who will not taste death before they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom.\u2014\u200a\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Truly I tell you, this generation will not pass away until all these things have taken place.\u2014\u200a\nThis predicted event has been variously interpreted as referring to:\nMany preterists find view 6 unacceptable because it implies a mistake on the part of Jesus about the timing of his return. Many preterists believe the immediate context seems to indicate the first view, the transfiguration, which immediately follows. This view seems to satisfy that \"some\" disciples would see the glory of the Son of Man, but it does not satisfy the statement that \"he will repay every man for what he has done\". The same situation occurs with views 2 through 4. Only view 5 (the judgement on Jerusalem in AD 70) appears to satisfy both conditions, reinforced with Revelation 2:23, 20:12 and 22:12, as a preterist would argue.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He has received critical acclaim mainly for his delicate and allegorical nudes, copies of which are widely distributed in public places and private homes in Sweden.\nBiography.\nHasselberg was born 1 January 1850 in the small village Hasselstad near Ronneby in the province of Blekinge in the south of Sweden.\nHe grew up as the sixth child in a poor family. His very religious father, \u00c5ke Andersson, was a small farmer, a construction worker for bridges, and a cabinet-maker.\nHasselberg finished school at the age of twelve and became a carpenter apprentice in Karlshamn, where he even got a training as ornamental sculptor. After this, he moved to Stockholm in 1869, where he took several jobs as ornamental sculptor and visited evening and weekend courses at craft school.\nIn 1876, he got a scholarship from the Swedish National Board of Trade to travel to Paris, where he was accepted at the \u00c9cole nationale sup\u00e9rieure des Beaux-Arts the following year. There, he studied for three years under the sculptor and academy professor Fran\u00e7ois Jouffroy. He then worked as sculptor in Paris until 1890, when he returned to Stockholm to open a studio in \u00d6stermalm.\nIn 1885, he was taken in at the Sahlgrenska University Hospital in Gothenburg because of aortic dissection. He recovered, but doctors told him he had only a few years to live.\nIn 1894, his condition became serious again and he died 25 July in Stockholm at the hospital Sophiahemmet.\nAt the time of his death, he had no debts and a book of orders of a total sum of about 30.000 Swedish Crowns, which is equivalent to about 250.000 US-Dollar in 2015. His will was that the large marble blocks, which were being shipped from Italy and which were destined for large copies of \"Farfadern\" and \"N\u00e4ckrosen\", should be handed over to his sculptor colleague Christian Eriksson to do the assignment, which he also did.\nMajor works.\nSn\u00f6klockan (Snowdrop, Paris 1881).\nThe original French name was \"La Perce-Neige\" (snow breaker) and it was first made in plaster cast for the 1881 Salon in Paris. Hasselberg's model was a 16-year-old Italian. At her feet shows a small snowdrop, and the statue was understood as a symbol of new life breaking through the snow in springtime.\n\"Sn\u00f6klocka\" actually is not the ordinary Swedish name for the flower, which is \"sn\u00f6droppe\". It is a rare poetic name that historically was derived from a literal translation of the ordinary German name \"Schneegl\u00f6ckchen\" (little snowbell). Thus a musical connotation was added by using it for the statue, and her right hand is close to her right ear.\nThe Snowdrop was not only accepted at the 1881 Salon, but even received an honorable mention, which no other Swedish work achieved that year. This success meant that Hasselberg suddenly was a famous artist in Sweden, where the Nationalmuseum in Stockholm soon ordered a copy in marble. It was finished in 1883 and received a gold medal at the Salon in Paris the same year. In 1885, also the Gothenburg Museum of Art had its marble copy. The Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek in Copenhagen/Denmark has one since 1889. Copies in bronze at public places are on Maria Square (Mariatorget)/Stockholm, in Falun, Ronneby, and near Sunne (Rottneros park).\n1,700 pieces in parian ware (marble imitation) with a height of 50\u00a0cm and 625 pieces in 60\u00a0cm were produced in 1887-1926 by Gustavsberg porcelain.\nThe more recent reception of the Snowdrop in Sweden in the 21st century presented a new additive in the form of certain feminist views. One author of the catalogue of the large Hasselberg retrospective in Stockholm 2010 claimed that the closed eyes of the statue were not a sign of just waking up but rather showed that Hasselberg had \"\u201cforced\u201d\" the \"\u201cbody of the young woman\u201d\" into a \"\u201cstate of unconsciousness\u201d\".\nFarfadern (Father\u2019s Father, Paris 1886).\nThe original French name was \"L'Ai\u00ebul\" (The Grandfather) and it was first made in plaster cast 1886 in Paris and exhibited at the Palais de l'Industrie that year. The basic idea was to show nature's cycle containing the poles of young and old. It had its origin during Hasselberg's long treatment at university hospital in Gothenburg in 1885, after which he learned that he had only a few more years to live. He knew, therefore, that the planned work might be his last one and thus his artistic testament.\nThe idea became more definitive after he had seen an old man sitting with a naked sleeping boy on his knees on a boulevard in Paris. When it was finished, his artist friends were enthusiastic about it, but the exhibition in Paris was no success.\nThe original copies in plaster cast by Hasselberg are lost, but a copy in bronze was placed near the National Library of Sweden in Stockholm 1896, and a copy in marble also from 1896 is today in the Gothenburg Museum of Art.\nGrodan (Frog, Paris 1889).\n\"Grodan\" (French \"La Grenouille\", English \"The Frog\") was made in plaster cast for the Exposition Universelle (1889) in Paris and exhibited there. There is a frog between the knees of a girl. Hasselberg reported that the concept of this piece had spontaneously come up when a model in his studio during a break sat on the floor in this position to rest.\nThe French word \"grenouille\" does not only mean \"frog\" but in slang also for \"street girl\". It is unknown if Hasselberg was aware of this second meaning, but it was commented that by this statue, he possibly wanted to express his time's view of a tension between the noble and the less noble sides of youth.\nSeveral copies in bronze are in public parks in Sweden and marble copies in museums. The most recent bronze copy from 2009 in Ulricehamn replaced a stolen copy from the 1940s. 230 pieces in parian ware (marble imitation) with a height of 38\u00a0cm and 241 pieces in 26\u00a0cm were produced in 1906-1926 by Gustavsberg porcelain.\nN\u00e4ckrosen (Water Lily, Stockholm 1892).\n\"N\u00e4ckrosen\" was first exhibited in plaster cast at the Danish art society Kunstforeningen in Copenhagen 1892 and later that year in Gothenburg/Sweden. In 1893, it was exhibited at the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago.\nThe statue shows a young woman lying on her back, floating on a large water lily leaf, surrounded by water lilies, and heads of old men symbolizing mermen. The first part of the flower's name \"n\u00e4ck\" in Scandinavia means water spirit. So a literal translation of \"N\u00e4ckrosen\" would be \"Water Spirit Rose\". While this association is usually not present when talking about the flower, Hasselberg here made it unavoidable by the heads of old men in the water. On the backside of the statue, there is a tree stump that holds a chain with a large padlock, apparently indicating that the large water lily leaf was put on chain.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 98.3 males.\nThe median income for a household in the village was $39,531, and the median income for a family was $46,429. Males had a median income of $31,307 versus $24,432 for females. The per capita income for the village was $16,483. About 1.8% of families and 3.3% of the population were below the poverty line, including 2.0% of those under age 18 and 9.1% of those age 65 or over.\nCulture and community.\nParma has two United Methodist churches: The North Parma United Methodist Church and the Parma United Methodist Church. North Parma serves the farming congregation to the north and the \"Plain Parma\" church serves the village congregation. North Parma is a white clapboard country church and \"Plain Parma\" is an orange brick church. Both churches were served by the same minister until the fall of 2005. Currently the minister assigned to the charge serves only North Parma. The two churches remained formally connected to a certain degree until 2006, when the charge was dissolved. The Parma UMC is now formally connected to the Trinity UMC in Jackson. As of 2007, North Parma remains independent, though this is not necessarily considered to be a permanent arrangement.\nSpring Life Church, formerly Howe Wesleyan Church, was part of the Methodist branch in the area and was started in 1908. In October 1912, it united with the Wesleyan Methodist church and was connected with the Rives Circuit made up of Rives, Robinson and Howe schools. In 1968 it became a Wesleyan Church with the merger of the Wesleyan Methodist and Pilgrim Holiness denominations. In April 2007, the congregation voted to change its name to Spring Life Church to re-emphasize the mission of the church which is to \"Cultivate, Plant, and Grow\".\nOther country churches in the community are Calvary Apostolic Church and Parma Baptist Church.\nNearby communities.\nTo the southeast is the community of Spring Arbor; northwest is the village of Springport; to the east is the city of Jackson and to the west is the city of Albion and beyond the cities of Marshall and Battle Creek, all in Calhoun County.\nParma is on Old US 12, which today is known as Michigan Avenue when it runs through Parma (and most of Southern Michigan). Today, the village has two exits on I-94, which replaced US\u00a012 as the primary route from Detroit to Chicago when the Interstate highway system was built. The segment of I-94 that services Parma was originally part of the US\u00a012 bypass, a freeway built prior to the Interstate system that allowed motorists to bypass Jackson and Parma. This is the oldest segment of I-94, beginning at Sargent Road in East Jackson and running west to Michigan Avenue outside of Parma. This older segment of the road is identifiable by its median, which is significantly narrower than the rest of I-94.\nParma is also located on the Michigan Central Railroad, which was historically the most significant and is currently the only railway from Detroit to Chicago. At one time Parma had a regular train station, but service was discontinued in 1954, and the old train station building was torn down.\nAn interurban trolley formerly ran between Parma and Jackson as well. On June 23, 1923, the train derailed and slammed into the jail, which was destroyed and never rebuilt. The scene, which is still remembered by some older residents, was commemorated in 1999 as part of the elaborate \"History of Parma\" section of the playground at Groner Park. The interurban station serves as the current library.\nEducation.\nThe Parma Union School District served the village and surrounding rural areas until 1957, when it consolidated with other school districts to form the Western School District. High school students from Parma therefore currently attend Western High School, which Parma shares with nearby Spring Arbor and the western edge of Jackson. The high school, along with the junior high and district administration, are located east of the village of Parma. One of the district's three elementaries, Parma Elementary School, is located on the south side of the village, near the site of the demolished Parma High School. The other two elementary schools are in the Spring Arbor area. When Parma Elementary was first built (in 1952), the Kindergarten class met in the Masonic Temple in Parma until the school was ready to open. The school opened mid year so the Kindergarten class of 1952 also attended the first half of First Grade in the Masonic Temple.\nSpring Arbor University is located about away, while Albion College is distant. Parma is also served by Jackson College, located approximately 17 miles (27\u00a0km) away.\nIndustry and commerce.\nParma is historically and traditionally an agricultural community, and most of the surrounding area remains used for that purpose. During the turn of the century, the farming atmosphere has been eroded by hints of urban sprawl from the area, as well as a general decline in the viability of family farming.\nA handful of manufacturing firms in the area have been constructed, located mostly along the U.S. Route 12 and Interstate 94 corridor \nIn 1989, the Michigan Automotive Compressors, Inc. (MACI), an automotive parts plant owned jointly by two Japanese parent companies, \nToyota Motor Corporation, and Denso was built.\nAccording to the company's webpage, MACI specializes in the manufacturing of automotive air conditioning compressors with a magnetic clutch, used in the production of various brands of cars.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Such practice is done in the Catholic Church, the Eastern Orthodox and Oriental Orthodox churches, various Protestant denominations, and also in other denominations of Christianity. The practice involves baptizing infants born to believing parents as a means of initiating them into the Christian faith. Supporters of infant baptism cite biblical references to the baptism of entire households in the New Testament, as well as Jesus' teachings on welcoming children, as justification for this approach.\nIn contrast, believers' baptism (credobaptism) is based on the premise that baptism should be administered only to individuals who can personally profess their faith. Those who support this view argue that baptism is a conscious act of commitment to Christianity, requiring an understanding of its significance. As a result, they maintain that only those capable of articulating their belief should participate in the sacrament. This perspective is commonly held by Anabaptists, Baptists, Pentecostals, and other evangelical groups. Proponents of believers\u2019 baptism argue that the absence of explicit references to infant baptism in the New Testament, along with the significance of baptism as a personal commitment.\nAge.\nInfant baptism practices vary across Christian denominations, typically occurring within the first few weeks after birth, though some traditions perform it immediately, such as in cases of imminent death, or delay it by several months.\nCeremony.\nThe exact details of the baptismal ceremony vary among Christian denominations. Many follow a prepared ceremony, called a rite or liturgy.\nReception.\nAll traditions begin with the reception or presentation of candidates. In the https://, this includes the Reception of the Children and a Liturgy of the Word with Scripture readings, homily, and intercessions. Similarly, Episcopal and Lutheran rites open with the Presentation and Examination of Candidates, including questions to parents, sponsors, or godparents. This phase highlights communal recognition and prepares candidates (and their families) for baptism. In the Eastern Orthodox Church, the rite opens with the \"reception of the catechumens,\" where the celebrant prays for the candidate to become \"a reason-endowed sheep in the holy flock of your Christ, an honorable member of your Church, a child of the light, and an heir of your Kingdom.\"\nPrayer and anointment.\nPrayers and symbolic anointings mark spiritual preparation. The Roman Catholic rite includes a \"https://\", emphasizing purification. Episcopal and Lutheran traditions incorporate \"http://\" and, in Lutheranism, a \"https://\" invoking the Holy Spirit. While explicit anointing is more prominent in Catholicism (e.g., post-baptismal chrismation), all rites emphasize prayer as a means of spiritual strengthening. In the Eastern Orthodox rite, multiple exorcisms are performed, and prayers are made for the water to be \"the water of redemption, the water of sanctification, the purification of flesh and spirit, the loosing of bonds, the remission of sins, the illumination of the soul, the laver of regeneration, the renewal of the spirit, the gift of adoption to sonship, the garment of incorruption, the fountain of life.\"\nBlessing of water and baptism.\nThe blessing of water and baptism proper are central to all rites. Roman Catholics perform a Blessing and Invocation of God over Baptismal Water, while Episcopalians and Lutherans include a Thanksgiving over the Water. Baptism itself is administered using the Trinitarian formula: Catholics, Episcopalians, and Lutherans all employ immersion or pouring \"in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.\" In the Eastern Orthodox Church, the celebrant prays for the water to be sanctified with \"the power (energeia) of the Holy Spirit,\" and the baptism is performed by triple immersion, immediately followed by Chrismation (anointing with holy oil).\nExplanatory rites and seal of the spirit.\nPost-baptismal rituals symbolize the candidate\u2019s new identity. Roman Catholics include \"Explanatory Rites\": anointing with chrism (\"Seal of the Spirit\"), clothing in a white garment, presentation of a lighted candle, and the \"Ephphetha\" prayer. Episcopalians offer a \"Prayer for the Sevenfold Gift of the Holy Spirit\", while Lutherans seal the candidate with a \"https://\" and present a baptismal candle. Eastern Orthodox Christians, after baptism, immediately chrismate the newly baptized, praying that the newly illumined will \"please you in every deed and word, and may be a child and heir of your heavenly kingdom,\" affirming a twofold transformation: normative membership in the Church and acquisition of the \"regenerate states\" (purification, sanctification, illumination, regeneration). These rites signify the Holy Spirit's indwelling and the community's welcome.\nConclusion.\nWhile baptism itself does not always include Eucharist, its communal context often ties to Eucharistic worship. For example: Roman Catholics conclude with the Lord\u2019s Prayer and a blessing, linking baptism to the broader liturgical life of the Church. Lutherans use a Baptismal Welcome, where the congregation affirms the newly baptized, often within a Eucharistic service. Episcopalians integrate baptism into the Baptismal Covenant, aligning it with congregational vows that precede shared Eucharist. In the Eastern Orthodox Church, baptism, chrismation, and first communion are typically administered together, even to infants, as baptism is seen as full incorporation into the Church's life, granting immediate access to the sacraments. Though not explicitly part of the baptismal rubric in all traditions, baptism is understood as initiation into a Eucharistic community.\nHistorical development.\nFirst century.\nFirst-century Christian baptism primarily involved adult believers, with no definitive New Testament evidence for infant baptism, though some suggest household baptisms may have included infants. Scholarly consensus holds that infant baptism emerged gradually from the late 2nd century, became widespread by the 3rd century, and was universal by the 4th-5th centuries, coexisting with believers' baptism (\"Acts of the Apostles\" 2:38\u201341) amid early debates.\nHistorian David F. Wright (2007,2005), suggests that first-century Pauline churches did not practice infant baptism. Wright describes the issue as \"obscurity unresolved,\" noting that evidence suggests children of baptized Christians were typically not baptized until at least c. 55 AD, during Paul's ministry, though the extent of this practice remains unclear.\nDespite this, some theologians argue for the early presence of infant baptism. Joachim Jeremias (2004) and William A. Strange (1996) argue that infant baptism originated in the Apostolic Age, asserting that children of converts were baptized alongside their families. Advocates cite households baptisms within \"Acts of the Apostles\" (16:15, 33) and \"1 Corinthians\" 1:16 as potential evidence. However, the \"Global Dictionary of Theology\" (2009) acknowledges the ambiguity of these accounts, stating that while infants may have been included, the texts do not provide explicit confirmation. Jeremias argues that baptism extended to all household members because the Old Testament concept of \u201chousehold\u201d is inherently inclusive, drawing upon interpretations of 1 Samuel 22:16\u201319 and Genesis 17:23. Therefore, the term \"house\" (\"oikos\") has been central to this debate.\nSteven Nicoletti (2015), proposes that the New Testament\u2019s silence on infant baptism may affirm its practice, drawing on the concept of \u201cpresupposition pools\u201d\u2014shared assumptions of the time. They argue that early Christian texts likely omitted explicit mention of infant baptism because it was widely accepted, mirroring cultural norms where infants were naturally included in religious rites.\nAnother line of reasoning explores parallels with Jewish traditions. The analogy between circumcision and baptism is a key argument for early infant baptism. In Jewish tradition, boys were circumcised on the eighth day, and some scholars suggest early Jewish Christians viewed baptism similarly. Additionally, Jewish proselyte baptism included entire households, including children, as a purification rite for Gentile converts to Judaism. Theologian Kurt Aland (2004) counters that this was not standard for Jewish-born children, who were typically incorporated via circumcision, not baptism, weakening the parallel to Christian practice.\nFurther insight comes from early Christian texts addressing the sinfulness of infants or young children. Clement of Rome (1 Clement 14.4) stated, \"No one is clean from defilement, not even if his life be but one day old.\" Although later used out of context, this became a proof-text for baptism addressing original sin. This view aligns with Psalm 51:5, which states, \"Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity, and in sin did my mother conceive me,\" supporting the early Christian belief in humanity\u2019s inherent sinfulness from birth. Similarly, the Didache, a church order dated to the late 1st or early 2nd century, provides instructions for adult baptism but notes that children should receive teaching to prevent future sin, without explicitly addressing their baptism. Early 1st-century Christian texts, like 1 Clement and Psalm 51:5, highlight universal sinfulness, linking baptism to sin\u2019s remission and laying groundwork for the doctrine of original sin, later justifying infant baptism. Yet, direct evidence for the practice in this period is absent, leaving its prevalence uncertain.\nSecond century.\nMost of second-century Christian texts provide no explicit evidence for the practice of infant baptism. However, scholars like Wright and Aland identify literary traces emerging by the late second century. For example, the first clear reference to infant baptism comes from Tertullian, who opposed it or advocated for its delay. In \"On Baptism\" (c. 200 AD), he acknowledges it as an established custom but argues against it, suggesting that baptism should be delayed until individuals can personally profess faith. Strange (1996) observed that Tertullian\u2019s opposition to infant baptism marked a departure from prevailing practice, arguing that patristic evidence suggests it was already a recognized norm. Additionally, Nuh Yilmaz (2020) notes that Tertullian's view did not resonate effectively in North African churches, where infant baptism continued as the general practice. North Africa remained the region with the strongest support for infant baptism, and according to Ferguson (1999) it may well have been where the practice originated.\nAdditionally, some advocates cite Irenaeus of Lyon who wrote that \"infants, small children, youngsters, youths, and old folk\" are \"born again\". Scholars such as Odd Magne Bakke (2005) and David P. Nelson (1996) interpret this as a reference to baptism, though Bakke qualifies that \"reborn\" (\"renascuntur\") must be understood as a technical term for baptism. Conversely, Peter Jenson (2012) and Robert L. Meyers (1988) argue that the statement lacks specificity regarding infants.\nRegardless, Christianity was growing in popularity and expansion during this period, structured catechesis became essential to prepare converts for faith amid persecution and heresies. This formalized approach to baptism, emphasizing instruction, according to Nelson (1996) likely reduced the practice of infant baptism, which required no prior preparation.\nInsights into early Christian apologists viewed infants and young children as sinless or morally innocent. Notable examples include\":The Shepherd of Hermas\" (c. 100\u2013150 AD) which portrays children as models of discipleship and moral purity, inherently innocent and free of evil, serving as an example for believers. Aristides of Athens (\"Apology\", Chapter 15, c. 125 AD) wrote that Christian children are born sinless and, if they die in infancy, are celebrated for passing from life without sin: \u201cAnd when a child is born to one of them, the Christians give thanks to God; and if the child dies in infancy, they give thanks even more, for it has passed from this life sinless.\u201d Athenagoras of Athens \"(On the Resurrection of the Dead, c. 177\u202fAD)\": stated that infants who die are not judged, as they \"have done neither evil nor good.\" Justin Martyr (\"First Apology\", 15, c. 155 AD; \"Second Apology\", 10, c. 153 AD) described infants and children as morally neutral, sinless ( actual sin ) until they can rationally choose to sin, emphasizing free will and the \"seed of the Logos.\" He praised the purity of \"disciples from childhood,\" suggesting no innate sinfulness.\nThird century.\nClearer evidence of infant baptism emerges in the third century. Yet from the third to the early fifth century, many Christian parents postponed baptizing their children. This delay was due to several factors: (1) the belief that waiting maximized baptism's spiritual benefits, (2) the custom of performing baptism only when death was near, (3) and the reluctance of unbaptized parents to have their children baptized.\nDespite this, inscriptions such as from Rome\u2019s Catacomb of Priscilla mentions an infant who had received baptism before dying. Such inscriptions suggest that infant baptism was practiced regularly, especially in cases of illness or impending death (Emergency baptism). Scholars like Jeremias and Ferguson examined inscriptional evidence related to infant baptism, Aland argued that third-century inscriptions offered no significant new information. By that period, infant baptism was already well attested in existing literary sources.\nThese existing literary sources included: Hippolytus of Rome (\"Apostolic Tradition\" 21.3-5) directed: \"\u201cThe little children shall be baptized first. If they can speak for themselves, let them do so; otherwise, their parents or a relative should answer on their behalf.\u201d\" Origen claimed that infant baptism was an apostolic tradition passed down to the Church, though it remains uncertain whether his view stemmed from theological reasoning or scriptural exegesis. Regardless, his writings attests that the custom was already firmly rooted. Cyprian of Carthage further insisted that baptism should not be postponed, even for infants, asserting that God\u2019s grace is \"not given in greater or lesser measure based on the recipient\u2019s age.\"\nFourth century.\nThe fourth century marked a turning point for Christianity as it transitioned from persecution to a favored religion within the Roman Empire. This shift brought about divergent baptismal practices. In some areas, the longstanding catechumenate persisted, with rigorous pre-baptismal instruction exemplified by figures like Cyril of Jerusalem and Gregory of Nyssa. Simultaneously, infant baptism gained prominence, fueled by evolving theological understandings of original sin's implications.\nDuring this period, the Church strongly condemned Pelagianism, which questioned the necessity of baptism for salvation, and affirmed that baptism must be administered without delay. For example, official decrees such as the Council of Florence\u2019s \"Pro Jacobitis\" warned against postponing baptism, thereby underlining that infants (and others) must receive baptism promptly to secure salvation. These developments, along with texts from the Council of Carthage and the Roman Catechism that taught unbaptized infants could not attain heaven, demonstrate that by the end of the fourth century infant baptism was a widely accepted and normative practice in the Church.\nSeveral prominent Christian leaders, such as Tertullian, Rufinus, Gregory of Nazianzus, Basil of Caesarea, Ambrose, Jerome, Augustine, and Cyril of Alexandria, attest to the widespread practice of infant \"dedication\" or \"enrollment in the catechumenate\" rather than immediate baptism. This custom was observed across major Christian centers, from Carthage and Milan to Constantinople and Alexandria. Consequently, in the fourth century, dedicating infants and later instructing them in the catechumenate remained the normative practice, while infant baptism was generally administered only in cases of urgent necessity (emergency baptism).\nAccording to Andrew Messmer (2022), many prominent Christian leaders, though born into Christian families, were not baptized as infants but received it later in life. For instance, Novatian (200\u2013258) was only baptized during a grave illness, while Gregory of Nazianzus (c. 329\u2013390) waited until around age thirty. Basil of Caesarea was baptized at approximately 27 (c. 357), and Gregory of Nyssa between ages 23 and 28. Ambrose of Milan (340\u2013397) remained unbaptized until his sudden election as bishop in 374, and John Chrysostom (347\u2013407) was baptized around age 20 (c. 368). Jerome (347\u2013420) received baptism at 19 (366), and Augustine (354\u2013430), despite his devout mother Monica\u2019s influence, delayed his baptism until age 33 (387). This pattern reflects the widespread practice of delaying baptism, even among those raised in Christian households.\nRegarding their views, the early Church Fathers held divergent views on infant baptism, reflecting the theological tensions of their era. Augustine of Hippo, in his anti-Pelagian writings, maintained that baptism was essential for cleansing original sin, asserting that only through this sacrament could infants be incorporated into Christ's flock. He issued grave warnings about the eternal consequences of dying unbaptized. In contrast, Gregory of Nazianzus adopted a more moderate position, arguing that since infants lack awareness of sin or grace, baptism should be deferred unless imminent danger threatened their lives - suggesting age three as an appropriate minimum or when children could actively participate in the rite. Jerome took a decidedly proactive stance, particularly in his correspondence with Laeta (403 AD), where he framed infant baptism as a fundamental parental obligation, implying negligence in those who delayed the sacrament. These differing perspectives illustrate the evolving theology surrounding baptismal practices in early Christianity.\nAccording to Robin M. Jensen (2012), archaeological evidence supports the existence of diverse baptismal practices in early Christianity. The variation in baptismal font designs suggests differences in liturgical customs, while third- and fourth-century funerary inscriptions confirm that some infants received emergency baptisms - though these do not demonstrate it was a widespread norm. The interpretation of iconographic evidence remains contested, as depictions of small figures undergoing baptism could represent either the baptism of Jesus or early instances of infant baptism. This ambiguity in material evidence mirrors the theological diversity seen in textual sources from the period.\nFifth century.\nBy the late fifth century, theological debates increasingly emphasized original sin as the primary justification for infant baptism. The growing influence of Augustinian theology in Western Christianity found formal expression when the Council of Carthage (418 AD) affirmed that infants, while personally guiltless, bore the taint of Adam's original sin and consequently needed baptism for spiritual purification. This doctrinal development marked a significant shift in sacramental theology, transforming infant baptism from a discretionary practice to a theological necessity in Western Christian thought.\nBy the early sixth century, a growing emphasis on the doctrine of repeatable penance further heightened fears that unbaptized infants would suffer eternal damnation. This period saw a shift in practice: parents began engaging in formal baptismal preparation activities on behalf of their children. Over time, these preparations gave way to a consolidated ceremony, where newborn infants were baptised, anointed (confirmation), and received communion all at once to ensure that even the youngest members of the community were promptly incorporated into the salvific rite. Writings from such as John the Deacon\u2019s letter (c. 500 AD) highlight that the Church\u2019s teaching and practice had firmly established infant baptism as essential for salvation in response to original sin. Large fonts from this period indicate that adult baptism continued alongside infant baptism well into the sixth and seventh centuries. In the sixth century, 526 AD, eastern Roman emperor, Justinian I made infant baptism compulsory.\nMiddle ages.\nThe practice of infant baptism expanded significantly during the early Middle Ages, particularly from the sixth century onward, largely due to concerns about high infant mortality rates. This led to the frequent administration of emergency baptisms (baptism in extremis), often performed in respite sanctuaries. The sacrament became firmly established as a normative practice through the Carolingian reforms of the ninth century, and was further consolidated during the Gregorian reforms of the eleventh and twelfth centuries.\nDenominational teachings and practices.\nRoman Catholic.\nThe Catholic Church requires a \"founded hope\" the child will be raised Catholic for licit baptism (Code of Canon Law 868 \u00a71, 2\u00b0 CIC). If absent, baptism is postponed (not denied) with explanation. The sacrament grants regeneration, removes original sin, and unites the child with Christ. Therefore, baptism is a fundamental sacrament in the Church, marking the initiation of an individual into Christian life and the Church community. It is essential for salvation, providing spiritual rebirth and access to other sacraments.\nThe Church requires assurance that baptized infants will be raised Catholic (Canon 868 \u00a71, 2\u00b0 CIC). Parental consent is mandatory - at least one parent/guardian must approve. Baptism cannot be administered against parental wishes except in danger of death, when it may proceed regardless of objections. Additionally, baptism is seen as a one-time sacrament that marks a person's commitment to Christ and cannot be repeated. If there is serious doubt about whether someone was baptized before or if it was done correctly, the Catholic Church allows a conditional baptism to be performed. Moreover, the practice of baptizing miscarried or stillborn infants is no longer done.\nThe Church recognizes both pouring (affusion) and immersion as valid baptismal methods, stating that the symbolic cleansing is preserved through the ritual use of water, even when full immersion isn't practiced.\nThe Church acknowledges the importance of a personal decision in baptism, which infants cannot make. To address this, godparents are appointed to stand in for the child, committing to their Christian upbringing on behalf of the parents. The role of parents and godparents is strongly emphasized in the Church's rite of infant baptism, which was revised on the instructions of the Second Vatican Council. As they grow, baptized children are expected to embrace the faith chosen for them, confirming the decision made on their behalf.\nHistorically, such practices were developed gradually, rooted in early Christian tradition, original sin, and sacramental theology. While adult baptism was initially dominant, the practice of baptizing infants became common by the third century. Cyprian of Carthage (c. 250 AD) defended it, arguing that baptismal grace should not be denied to children. In the fourth century, Augustine of Hippo linked baptism to original sin, asserting that it was necessary for salvation. His arguments shaped medieval sacramental theology, which emphasized that baptism remained valid regardless of personal faith (ex opere operato). The concept of \"limbo\" (\"limbus infantium\"), a speculative idea that unbaptized infants neither enter heaven nor suffer in hell, was never official Church doctrine. Though widely held from the 12th century onward, belief in limbo had largely faded by the 20th century.\nIn response to Protestant critiques, the Council of Trent (1545\u20131563) firmly upheld infant baptism as obligatory, solidifying its standard practice with support from godparents and catechesis. Today, the Church teaches that unbaptized infants are entrusted to God\u2019s mercy, while maintaining that baptism remains essential for initiation into the faith and liberation from original sin.\nEastern Churches.\nThe Eastern Orthodox Church practices infant baptism as a fundamental part of its sacramental theology, viewing it as the child's initiation into the Church and participation in the life of Jesus. The baptism is performed through triple immersion in water, symbolizing the believer\u2019s sharing in Christ\u2019s death and resurrection. In Orthodox theology, sacraments are considered effective by the very act of their completion (ex opere operato), meaning they impart divine grace regardless of the recipient\u2019s personal understanding.\nThe Orthodox Church, like the Roman Catholic Church, believes that baptism results in the forgiveness of sins, both original and actual. Through baptism, the newly baptized is \"clothed with Christ\" and becomes a full member of the Church. The sacrament is viewed as a mystical communion with God, through which grace is given for salvation and spiritual transformation. This understanding reflects the Orthodox belief that sacraments are \"Mysteries\", divine means by which humanity experiences salvation and anticipates eternal life in God\u2019s kingdom.\nBaptism in the Orthodox Church is immediately followed by Chrismation (Confirmation) and Holy Communion, emphasizing the unity of these three sacraments. Chrismation, administered by the priest, involves anointing the baptized with Holy Myron (Chrism), sealing them with the gift of the Holy Spirit. The newly baptized, including infants, then receive the Eucharist, partaking in consecrated wine and bread as their first communion. This integrated approach contrasts with many Western Christian traditions, where these sacraments are administered separately at different stages of life.\nThe baptism of infants is performed on the basis of the faith of the Church, rather than the personal profession of the child. The commitment of parents and godparents plays a crucial role, as they pledge to raise the child in the Orthodox faith. While infants are traditionally baptized on the eighth day, mirroring the Old Testament practice of circumcision, this timing is not strictly required, and baptisms may occur at any time. Orthodox theology holds that baptism is essential for salvation and the remission of original sin, making it a vital sacrament in the life of every Orthodox Christian.\nProtestant.\nLutheran Churches.\nLutherans uphold infant baptism by pointing to scriptural references where entire households were baptized (e.g., Acts 16:15). They argue that households in biblical times included children. According to Martin Luther, baptism is not founded on personal faith, as one can never be certain of faith. Instead, it is based on God's word and commandment. The faith involved is that of those who bring the child to baptism (fides aliena), such as parents, godparents, and the church congregation.\nLutherans believe that through baptism, the child receives infused faith, mediated by the prayers of the church, parents, and godparents. Baptism purifies and renews the child. Personal faith is not a prerequisite for baptism but is nourished by it, as the individual continually adheres to God's grace and renounces sin throughout life. The Augsburg Confession (II) states that baptism is necessary for salvation. It is an assignment to Christ, a surrender into Jesus\u2019 death and resurrection, and a gift of new life that calls the baptized to walk in faith.\nWhile baptism marks initiation into the church and incorporation into the people of God, it is viewed as the beginning of a lifelong journey. If not taken in faith, baptism remains incomplete. In the post-Reformation era, Lutheran orthodoxy reaffirmed the necessity of infant baptism. However, later movements such as Pietism and Rationalism emphasized inner experience over the sacrament, leading figures like John Wesley to argue that true rebirth occurs through personal transformation, not the outward ritual.\nMethodist.\nAccording to Campbell (1999), Methodist churches affirm infant baptism, rooted in the seventeenth Article of Religion\u2019s instruction to retain \u201cthe baptism of young children\u201d (p. 107). Methodists have historically defended this practice against critics of infant baptism, grounding it in New Testament accounts of household baptisms (Acts 16:15, 33), Jesus\u2019 embrace of children (e.g., Matthew 19:13\u201315), and the belief that all, including infants, require inclusion in the church\u2019s covenantal fellowship. For Methodists, infant baptism signifies \u201can acceptance of the prevenient grace of God and as a confession on the part of the church of its responsibility for children in general and for every child in particular.\u201d Methodist doctrine further emphasizes that justifying grace, essential for salvation, is received after repentance and a personal commitment to Christ as Savior. While many Methodist denominations, such as the Free Methodist Church and Allegheny Wesleyan Methodist Connection, practice infant baptism for families who request it, they also offer a rite of child dedication for those who prefer to delay baptism until their child can consciously profess faith.\nPresbyterian, Congregational and Reformed Churches.\nPresbyterian, Congregational, and Reformed churches administer infant baptism based on covenant theology, viewing baptism as \"a sign and seal of the covenant of grace\" and the \"visible Word of God\" (Fesko 2010, p. 4). They argue that baptism replaces circumcision as the covenant sign and that just as infants were circumcised under the old covenant, so now infants should be baptized under the new covenant (p. 8). Baptism is not merely a human act of profession but is \"God\u2019s visible covenant promise when accompanied by the Word\" and serves as a \"means of grace\" (p. 6). This perspective stresses that baptism is grounded in \"God\u2019s covenant dealings with His people,\" not in an individual\u2019s decision or personal faith alone (p. 3).\nConfirmation.\nFor Catholic, Methodist Christians, and Wesleyan, Confirmation \"strengthens\" (the original meaning of the word \"confirm\") the grace of Baptism, by conferring an increase and deepening of that grace.\nIn Eastern Christianity, including the Eastern Catholic Churches, the sacrament of Confirmation is conferred immediately after baptism, and there is no renewal of baptismal promises. In the Latin Church and its Latin liturgical rites of the Catholic Church, the sacrament is to be conferred at about the age of discretion (generally taken to be about 7), unless the Episcopal Conference has decided on a different age, or there is danger of death or, in the judgment of the minister, a grave reason suggests otherwise (https://). The renewal of baptismal promises by those receiving the sacrament in the Western Catholic Church is incidental to the rite and not essentially different from the solemn renewal of their baptismal promises that is asked of all members of this church each year at the Easter Vigil service. Only in French-speaking countries has there been a development of ceremonies, quite distinct from the sacrament of Confirmation, for young Catholics to profess their faith publicly, in line with their age.\nWithin the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, confirmation or \"the laying on of hands\" is an essential part of the baptismal ordinance, and to receive baptism without confirmation is to leave the ordinance incomplete. Confirmation is the conferring of the gift of the Holy Ghost as a constant companion. To confirm means to \"make more sure\" and the ordinance of confirmation stands as a witness of the individual becoming a member of the LDS Church and not just an acceptance of Jesus.\nComparison with believer's baptism.\nDefinition of believer's baptism.\nBeliever\u2019s baptism emphasizes conscious faith and personal commitment as prerequisites. Advocates argue that household baptisms in Acts (e.g., Acts 16:15, 33) cited for infant baptism rely on an argument from silence, as no explicit biblical text mentions infant baptism. Historical records suggest infant baptism emerged in the late second century, lacking direct scriptural precedent. Rooted in Pauline theology (Romans 6:4; Galatians 3:27), baptism symbolizes the burial of the \u201cold self\u201d and resurrection to new life in Christ through immersion. Groups like the Adventists view it as a public declaration of repentance and surrender to Christ\u2019s lordship. Swiss Reformer Huldrych Zwingli emphasized baptism as a memorial act, not a sacramental means of grace.\nKey theological differences.\nBeliever\u2019s baptism prioritizes responsible baptism, requiring the baptized to become competent to know Christ. It is effective only when joined with faith and presupposes that baptized can respond for themselves to the baptismal interrogations and thus bear witness to personal faith. However, infant baptism primarily rests on God\u2019s initiative, viewing baptism as a sign of grace and covenant membership, not requiring personal faith but depending on the church\u2019s faith.\nDebates regarding infant baptism.\nThe debate over infant baptism engages ecclesiology, covenant, and faith, often sparking controversy. Tom J. Nettles et al. (2007) in \"Understanding Four Views on Baptism\" highlight two irreconcilable traditions: believer\u2019s baptism, emphasizing personal faith, and infant baptism, prioritizing covenantal continuity. These frameworks \u201csimply cannot be mixed\u201d without undermining theological integrity (p. 21)\nArguments for.\nProponents of infant baptism base their position on a covenantal framework, equating the practice with the Old Testament rite of circumcision. In Reformed theology, baptism signifies a child\u2019s inclusion in God\u2019s covenant community and membership within the visible church, mirroring circumcision\u2019s role in ancient Israel. B. B. Warfield noted this continuity, arguing that God\u2019s inclusion of children in the covenant community, established during Abraham\u2019s time, still grants them access to church membership and sacraments. Luther defended infant baptism as an act of obedience to Christ\u2019s directive to bring children to God, grounding the practice in divine authority rather than human choice.\nArguments against.\nCritics of infant baptism maintain that the New Testament portrays baptism reserved for individuals who consciously respond to the gospel and profess faith, rather than as a covenantal rite applied to infants. They state that the absence of explicit biblical examples where baptism is administered to those incapable of understanding or articulating belief, therefore weakens its symbolic role in affirming Christian identity.\nAs for the historical viewpoint, critics argue that infant baptism originated as a post-apostolic ecclesiastical innovation, lacking direct biblical or apostolic authorization, and dismiss it as a human tradition unsupported by divine revelation.\nRegarding consent, Mary McAleese, a Catholic legal scholar and former Irish president, posits in her doctoral research that infant baptism functions as \u201cenforced membership\u201d within the Catholic Church, raising questions about consent and lifelong obligations imposed on children. She suggests that baptized individuals should later have the opportunity to formally affirm or renounce their membership, aligning with modern principles of freedom of conscience, belief, and religion. McAleese observes that the Catholic Church has yet to fully integrate these principles into its sacramental theology.\nOpposing denominations.\nThese doctrinal positions shape baptismal practices across Christian traditions, exemplified by: Anabaptists (e.g., Mennonites, Amish), Baptist Traditions (Southern, Reformed), Churches of Christ, Pentecostal/Charismatic groups (Assemblies of God, Oneness Pentecostals). Additionally, several nontrinitarian religious groups also oppose infant baptism, including Oneness Pentecostals, Christadelphians, Jehovah's Witnesses, United Church of God, and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS).\nSpecifically, the LDS Church has stated that little children are considered both born without sin and incapable of committing sin. They have no need of baptism until age eight, when they can begin to learn to discern right from wrong, and are thus accountable to God for their own actions. However, the LDS Church performs a non-saving ordinance to name and bless children, customarily performed on infants.\nChallenges and controversies.\nInjury and death.\nIn October 2020, a Greek Orthodox priest in Cyprus was accused of harming an infant during a baptism near Limassol. Video evidence showed the priest forcefully immersing the crying baby into a metal font, causing the child's legs to repeatedly strike the container. The parents filed a complaint, alleging the priest ignored their requests for gentle handling and responded, \u201cI am responsible for the baptism.\u201d The mother, Ntina Shitta, reported the baby was \u201cred and in shock\u201d afterward, describing the event as a \u201cruined\u201d milestone. The priest issued a public apology on October 19, denying intent to harm and claiming he acted to prevent the baby from slipping, expediting the ritual upon noticing distress. Church authorities launched an investigation, but no immediate charges or disciplinary actions were announced.\nOn February 5, 2021, a six-week-old baby died in Suceava, Romania, within a Romanian Orthodox Church, after a baptism involving triple immersion in holy water, led to cardiac arrest and liquid in the lungs. A manslaughter inquiry targeted the priest involved. Archbishop Calinic of Arges called for reviewing baptism practices, favoring alternatives like sprinkling, while the Archbishop of Tomis defended the traditional ritual, rejecting change. A petition for safer baptisms gained 60,000 signatures.\nCatholic forced baptism and custody.\n\"Postremo mense\".\nIn 1747, Pope Benedict XIV issued papal bull \"Postremo mense\", about baptizing Jewish children, building on old Church traditions. Benedict XIV said it is usually wrong to baptize a Jewish child without the parents' permission, but it is permissible if the child is dying. If a child is baptized, even improperly, the Church must take them from non-baptized Jewish parents to raise them as Christians. These ideas matched earlier thinkers like Thomas Aquinas and were supported by later figures like Alphonsus Liguori. The Church punished unauthorized baptisms, but the baptism's effects still stood. In 1751, Benedict issued a \"Probe te meminisse\" reinforcing these rules and setting penalties for Jewish converts who left Catholicism.\nEdgardo Mortara case (1858).\nIn 1858, six-year-old Jewish boy Edgardo Mortara was removed from his family in Bologna, then part of the Papal States, after a Catholic servant had baptized him as an infant during an illness, citing concern for his spiritual salvation. Under papal law, which required Catholic children to be raised in the faith, authorities declined requests from Edgardo\u2019s parents to return him, despite appeals to figures such as Cardinal Giuseppe Milesi Ferretti and Archbishop Michele Viale-Pr\u00e8la. Efforts by the family and Jewish leaders to negotiate with officials were unsuccessful. Due to the emotional strain of the separation, Edgardo\u2019s mother, Marianna, was temporarily relocated from the home. The Church assumed custody of Edgardo, prompting widespread international criticism.\nBaptism during the Holocaust.\nDuring the Holocaust, many Jewish children in Nazi-occupied Poland were hidden and rescued by Catholic convents and monasteries. The motivations of the rescuers varied. While many nuns acted out of Christian compassion and humanitarian duty, the issue of religious conversion became controversial. Some children were baptized, sometimes as a protective measure, but this led to postwar disputes about their religious identity and custody. After the war, tensions arose between Jewish organizations and the Catholic Church over whether baptized children should be returned to the Jewish community or remain in Catholic care.\nFinaly Affair.\nJewish boys Robert and G\u00e9rald Finaly, hidden by Catholics during WWII, were baptized. Postwar, their Catholic caretaker refused to return them to Jewish relatives, citing their baptism. Legal battles ended with their return to Jewish family in 1953.\nOther religious traditions.\nYazidism.\nIn Yazidism, \"Mor kirin\" (\"to seal\") is a baptism ritual typically performed at birth to initiate children into the faith. Holy water from the Kaniya Sip\u00ee (White Spring) at Lalish, the holiest Yazidi site. Alternatively, one may use the slightly less holy Zimzim spring.\nIndividuals originating from regions near Lalish frequently translate the \"mor kirin\" ceremony as 'baptism,' due to its observable similarities with Christian baptismal rites.\nThe rite is performed by either a male or female member of a shaikh or pir family who serves as the officiating \"Mij\u00eawir\" (custodian) at Lalish, specifically holding the position of \"Mic\u00eawir\u00ea Kaniya Sip\u00ee\" (custodian of the White Spring) during the ceremony.\nThe officiant pours holy water from one of Lalish's sacred springs over the child's head in three ritual motions. While the ideal age for reception is nine or ten years, practical considerations often lead to earlier administration. Although circumcision is not a religious requirement, some families observe the practice due to regional customs.\nAccording to Iraqi Yazidi tradition, individuals who die without undergoing \"mor kirin\" must be ritually washed by their \"shaikh\", \"pir\", or designated \"Brother/Sister of the Hereafter\" (Kurd. \"Biray\u00ea/Xu\u015fka Axiret\u00ea\"). If none of these are available, another person may perform the washing in their name. For those unable to travel to Lalish, the rite may be conducted using holy water transported from the sacred springs of Lalish to their location.\nHowever, adherence to this practice varies geographically. Yazidis originating from areas near Lalish observe the custom more consistently than those from Turkey or Armenia, among whom the ritual has largely diminished in perceived necessity.\nWhile the \"mor kirin\" ceremony may reflect historical Christian influences, its origins remain speculative. Given the significance of water in pre-Islamic Iranian religions, the rite could equally stem from earlier indigenous traditions.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Although pseudocode shares features with regular programming languages, it is intended for human reading rather than machine control. Pseudocode typically omits details that are essential for machine implementation of the algorithm, meaning that pseudocode can only be verified by hand. The programming language is augmented with natural language description details, where convenient, or with compact mathematical notation. The reasons for using pseudocode are that it is easier for people to understand than conventional programming language code and that it is an efficient and environment-independent description of the key principles of an algorithm. It is commonly used in textbooks and scientific publications to document algorithms and in planning of software and other algorithms.\nNo broad standard for pseudocode syntax exists, as a program in pseudocode is not an executable program; however, certain limited standards exist (such as for academic assessment). Pseudocode resembles skeleton programs, which can be compiled without errors. Flowcharts, drakon-charts and Unified Modelling Language (UML) charts can be thought of as a graphical alternative to pseudocode, but need more space on paper. Languages such as HAGGIS bridge the gap between pseudocode and code written in programming languages.\nApplication.\nPseudocode is commonly used in textbooks and scientific publications related to computer science and numerical computation to describe algorithms in a way that is accessible to programmers regardless of their familiarity with specific programming languages. Textbooks often include an introduction explaining the conventions in use, and the detail of pseudocode may sometimes approach that of formal programming languages.\nProgrammers frequently begin implementing an unfamiliar algorithm by drafting it in pseudocode, then translating it into a programming language while adapting it to fit the larger program. This top-down structuring approach often starts with a pseudocode sketch refined into executable code. Pseudocode is also used in standardization; for example, the MPEG standards rely on formal C-like pseudocode, these standards cannot be understood without grasping the details of the code.\nSyntax.\nPseudocode generally does not actually obey the syntax rules of any particular language; there is no systematic standard form. Some writers borrow style and syntax from control structures from some conventional programming language, although this is discouraged. Some syntax sources include Fortran, Pascal, BASIC, C, C++, Java, Lisp, and ALGOL. Variable declarations are typically omitted. Function calls and blocks of code, such as code contained within a loop, are often replaced by a one-line natural language sentence.\nDepending on the writer, pseudocode may therefore vary widely in style, from a near-exact imitation of a real programming language at one extreme, to a description approaching formatted prose at the other.\nThis flexibility brings both major advantages and drawbacks: on the positive side, no executable programming language \"can beat the convenience of inventing new constructs as needed and letting the reader try to deduce their meaning from informal explanations\", on the negative, \"untested code is usually incorrect\".\nMathematical style pseudocode.\nIn numerical computation, pseudocode often consists of mathematical notation, typically from matrix and set theory, mixed with the control structures of a conventional programming language, and perhaps also natural language descriptions. This is a compact and often informal notation that can be understood by a wide range of mathematically trained people, and is frequently used as a way to describe mathematical algorithms. For example, the sum operator (capital-sigma notation) or the product operator (capital-pi notation) may represent a for-loop and a selection structure in one expression:\n Return formula_1\nNormally non-ASCII typesetting is used for the mathematical equations, for example by means of markup languages, such as TeX or MathML, or proprietary formula editors.\nMathematical style pseudocode is sometimes referred to as pidgin code, for example \"pidgin ALGOL\" (the origin of the concept), \"pidgin Fortran\", \"pidgin BASIC\", \"pidgin Pascal\", \"pidgin C\", and \"pidgin Lisp\".\nExample.\nThe following is a longer example of mathematical-style pseudocode, for the Ford\u2013Fulkerson algorithm:\n algorithm ford-fulkerson is\n input: Graph \"G\" with flow capacity \"c\", \n source node \"s\", \n sink node \"t\"\n output: Flow \"f\" such that \"f\" is maximal from \"s\" to \"t\"\n \"(Note that f(u,v) is the flow from node u to node v, and c(u,v) is the flow capacity from node u to node v)\"\n for each edge (\"u\", \"v\") in \"G\"\"E\" do\n \"f\"(\"u\", \"v\") \u2190 0\n \"f\"(\"v\", \"u\") \u2190 0\n while there exists a path \"p\" from \"s\" to \"t\" in the residual network \"G\"\"f\" do\n let \"c\"\"f\" be the flow capacity of the residual network \"G\"\"f\"\n for each edge (\"u\", \"v\") in \"p\" do\n \"f\"(\"u\", \"v\") \u2190 \"f\"(\"u\", \"v\") + \"c\"\"f\"(\"p\")\n \"f\"(\"v\", \"u\") \u2190 \u2212\"f\"(\"u\", \"v\")\n return \"f\"\nMachine compilation of pseudocode style languages.\nNatural language grammar in programming languages.\nSeveral attempts to bring elements of natural language grammar into computer programming have produced programming languages such as HyperTalk, Lingo, AppleScript, SQL, Inform, and to some extent Python. In these languages, parentheses and other special characters are replaced by prepositions, resulting in quite verbose code. These languages are typically dynamically typed, meaning that variable declarations and other boilerplate code can be omitted. Such languages may make it easier for a person without knowledge about the language to understand the code and perhaps also to learn the language. However, the similarity to natural language is usually more cosmetic than genuine. The syntax rules may be just as strict and formal as in conventional programming, and do not necessarily make development of the programs easier.\nMathematical programming languages.\nAn alternative to using mathematical pseudocode (involving set theory notation or matrix operations) for documentation of algorithms is to use a formal mathematical programming language that is a mix of non-ASCII mathematical notation and program control structures. Then the code can be parsed and interpreted by a machine.\nSeveral formal specification languages include set theory notation using special characters. Examples are:\nSome array programming languages include vectorized expressions and matrix operations as non-ASCII formulas, mixed with conventional control structures.

Concepts of pre-existence can encompass either the belief that the soul came into existence at some time prior to conception or the belief that the soul is eternal. Alternative positions are traducianism and creationism, which both hold that the individual human soul does not come into existence until conception or later. It is to be distinguished from preformation, which is about physical existence and applies to all living things.\nAncient Greek thought.\nPlato believed in the pre-existence of the soul, which tied in with his innatism. He thought that we are born with knowledge from a previous life that is subdued at birth and must be relearned. He saw all attainment of knowledge not as acquiring new information, but as remembering previously known information.\nBaha'i Faith.\nBah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed literature refers in a number of places to at least four key dimensions of pre-existence. Firstly, that the individual soul of a human being comes into being at the time of conception and only thereafter is eternal; in other words, it is not pre-existent. Secondly, in distinction to the above, that the souls of the world's greatest spiritual teachers, the founders of world religions, are pre-existent. Thirdly, that God, a reality which human consciousness can not comprehend, is pre-existent, that is he exists prior to time and to his creation. Fourthly, that the relationship between God and the phenomenal or contingent world is one of emanation, as the rays of the sun are to the earth. In other words, the pre-existent world of God remains separate from and does not descend into his creation.\nBuddhism.\nIn Buddhist cosmology, sa\u1e43s\u0101ra is the cycle of life and death. When a person dies in earth its human soul is born into the Naraka (underworld or the \"purgatories\" of the souls) and afterwards it is reborn on earth. Yama, a dharmapala (wrathful god), is said to judge the dead and preside over the Narakas and the cycle.\nA being is born into a Naraka as a direct result of its accumulated actions (karma) and resides there for a finite period of time (it varies from hundreds of millions to sextillions of years, but these periods are equivalent to hours or even years in earth time) until that karma has achieved its full result. After its karma is used up, it will be reborn in one of the higher worlds as the result of karma that had not yet ripened. The cycle is completed or finished when the soul reach the Nirvana.\nChinese mythology.\nIn Chinese mythology, the Naihe Bridge (\u5948\u4f55\u6865), also called the Bridge of Forgetfulness, connects earth with the Diyu (\"earth prison\"), that is the realm of the dead or purgatory. It is typically depicted as a subterranean maze with various levels and chambers, to which souls are taken after death to atone for the sins they committed when they were alive. The number of levels in Diyu it is said to be three, four, ten or even Eighteen \"courts\", each of which is ruled by a judge, collectively known as the Yama Kings. The god of the dead is Yanluo Wang, it oversees the kings of the courts. Ox-Head and Horse-Face are the guardians of Diyu, and their role is the capture of human souls who have died and bring them before the courts of Hell, where they are rewarded or punished based on the actions performed in their lifetime. Legend has it that the dead who have committed serious sins in life cannot cross the Naihe Bridge and will be pushed into the \"Blood River Pool\" by Ox-Head and Horse-Face to suffer the torture of insects, ants and snakes, while the dead who have done good deeds will be able to cross the bridge very easily.\nThe goddess of forgetfulness, Meng Po, serves Meng Po Soup (\u5b5f\u5a46\u6c64) on the Naihe Bridge. This soup wipes the memory of the persons before they cross the bridge so they can reincarnate into their next life without the burdens of the previous life. She awaits the dead souls at the entrance of the 9th round (Fengdu). In some variations she is referred as Lady Meng Jiang\nChristianity.\nA concept of pre-existence was advanced by Origen, a second and third-century Church Father. Origen believed that each human soul was created by God at some time prior to conception. He wrote that already \"one of [his] predecessors\" had interpreted the Scripture to teach pre-existence, which seems to be a reference to the Jewish philosopher Philo.\nSome scholars, including John Behr and Marguerite Harl, argue that this idea, condemned by the church, may have been taught by some later Origenists, but that Origen himself was orthodox in this regard and \"never used the terms 'pre-existence of souls' or 'pre-existent intellects', and that Origen was talking about realities outside of time and not about any concept of temporality before our time. Such orthodox understandings of Origen also show up in Maximus the Confessor and in the idea of an atemporal fall as taught by Christian theologians Sergei Bulgakov and David Bentley Hart.\nChurch Fathers Tertullian and Jerome held to traducianism and creationism, respectively, and pre-existence was condemned as heresy in the Second Council of Constantinople in AD 553.\nOrigen referenced Romans 9:11-14 as evidence for his position:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;For the children being not yet born, neither having done any good or evil, that the purpose of God according to election might stand, not of works, but of him that calleth; It was said unto her, The elder shall serve the younger. As it is written, Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated. What shall we say then? Is there unrighteousness with God? God forbid.\nOrigen argued that God could not love Jacob and hate Esau until Jacob had done something worthy of love and Esau had done something worthy of hatred and so the passage means only that Jacob and Esau had not yet done good or evil \"in this life\" and their conduct \"before\" this life was the reason why Esau would serve Jacob.\nOrigen also referenced Jeremiah 1:5:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Before I formed thee in the belly, I knew thee; and before thou camest forth out of the womb, I sanctified thee, and I ordained thee a prophet unto the nations.\nHe brought forth a question:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;How could his soul and its images be formed along with his body, who, before he was created in the womb, is said to be known to God, and was sanctified by Him before his birth?\nThose who reject pre-existence, which would be every Christian denomination that accepts the conclusions of the Second Council of Constantinople (i.e., all Catholics and Eastern Orthodox Christians and many Protestants), simply see Jeremiah 1:5 as another passage about God's foreknowledge. This Ecumenical Council explicitly stated \"If anyone asserts the fabulous pre-existence of souls, and shall assert the monstrous restoration which follows from it: let him be anathema.\"\nLatter Day Saint.\nThe concept of premortal life is an early and fundamental doctrine of Mormonism. In the faith's eponymous text, the Book of Mormon, published on March 26, 1830, the premortal spirit of Christ appears in human form and explains that individuals were created in the beginning in the image of Christ. In 1833, early in the Latter Day Saint movement, its founder Joseph Smith taught that human souls are co-eternal with God the Father just as Jesus is co-eternal with God the Father, \"Man was also in the beginning with God. Intelligence, or the light of truth, was not created or made, neither indeed can be.\"\nHinduism.\nIn the Bhagavad Gita, considered by Hindus to be a most holy scripture, Krishna tells Arjuna; \"Never was there a time when I did not exist, nor you, nor all these kings; nor in the future shall any of us cease to be.\" Hinduism teaches reincarnation. Consequently, everyone has pre-existed in another form.\nIslam.\nIn Islam, all souls are believed to have been created in adult form before earthly life at the same time the God created the father of mankind, Adam. The Qur'an recounts the story of when the descendants of Adam were brought forth before God to testify that God alone is the Lord of creation and so only God is worthy of worship and so on the Day of Judgement, people cannot use the excuse that they worshipped others only because they were following the ways of their ancestors. Humans do not remember, as they are born with an undeveloped mind (leaving only an innate awareness that God exists and is one, known as the \"Fitra\"), and God decreed when every human would be born into the physical world.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "24187", "revid": "14965160", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24187", "title": "Prussian Confederation", "text": "Organization of Prussian nobles in opposition to the Teutonic Order (1440-66)\nThe Prussian Confederation (, ) was an organization formed on 21 February 1440 at Marienwerder (present-day Kwidzyn) by a group of 53 nobles and clergy and 19 cities in Prussia, to oppose the arbitrariness of the Teutonic Knights. It was based on an earlier similar organization, the Lizard Union established in 1397 by the nobles of Che\u0142mno Land. \nIn 1454, the leader of the Confederation, Johannes von Baysen (Jan Ba\u017cy\u0144ski), formally asked King Casimir IV Jagiellon, to incorporate Prussia into the Kingdom of Poland. This marked the beginning of the Thirteen Years' War between the Order's State and Poland, with the cities co-financing the military costs of the latter.\nBackground.\nAccording to the 1411 First Peace of Thorn which followed the Teutonic Knights' defeat in the Battle of Grunwald, the Teutonic Order had to pay high reparations to the Kingdom of Poland. The monastic state imposed high taxes on the cities to raise the funds as well as to re-arm for another war against Poland. In the 1420s, Grand Master Paul von Rusdorf brought stability to the Order and its relations, but fighting with Poland resumed in 1431, when the Knights' invasion into Poland during the Lithuanian Civil War sparked another Polish-Teutonic conflict. \nEstablishment.\nAfter about three decades of growing discontent, the burghers, nobility and landowners from the Teutonic state (see Prussian estates) organized themselves to oppose the rule of the order more effectively. The decision to establish the organization was made at a convention held in Elbl\u0105g on February 21, 1440. The convention was attended by representatives of the cities of Che\u0142mno (\"Culm\"), Elbl\u0105g (\"Elbing\"), Toru\u0144 (\"Thorn\"), Gda\u0144sk (\"Danzig\"), Braniewo (\"Braunsberg\"), Kr\u00f3lewiec (\"K\u00f6nigsberg\"), and Knipawa (\"Kneiphof\") as well as nobles from various areas. On 14 March 1440, a group of 53 nobles and clergy and 19 cities, under the leadership of the Hanseatic cities of Danzig (Gda\u0144sk), Elbing (Elbl\u0105g), Thorn (Toru\u0144) and K\u00f6nigsberg (Kr\u00f3lewiec), founded the Prussian Confederation in Marienwerder (Kwidzyn). More towns joined later on (see \"Participating towns\" below). In Danzig, the new members signed a document which was kept in the archives of Thorn. The official representatives of the Confederation were the city councils of Che\u0142mno and Toru\u0144, and the knights of Che\u0142mno Land.\nAfter Grand Master Paul von Rusdorf died in 1441, his successor, Konrad von Erlichshausen, continued to negotiate a compromise until his own death in 1449. The confederation lobbied for support against the Teutonic Order within the Holy Roman Empire. Ludwig von Erlichshausen, Grand Master from 1450 to 1467, took a more aggressive stance towards the confederation. He filed a lawsuit at the court of Emperor Frederick III. In response, the organization established a secret council to confer during the trial. The secret council held talks with Poland, and organized forces to revolt against the Teutonic Knights. The verdict of the Imperial court of 1453 declared the confederation illegal, however, the verdict was not recognized by the organization nor by Poland.\nThirteen Years' War.\nIn February 1454, the Prussian Confederation rose against the Teutonic Order's rule. Gabriel von Baysen and Johannes von Baysen, now leading the confederation with the support of Jan de Jani and Miko\u0142aj Szarlejski, both of the Clan of Ostoja, requested the protection of King Casimir IV Jagiellon of Poland, and the incorporation of the region to the Kingdom of Poland, to which the King agreed and signed an act of incorporation in Krak\u00f3w in March 1454. They also asked for, and received, a guarantee of their continued city rights and privileges for the nobility. Delegates and officials of the Confederation pledged allegiance to the Polish King during the incorporation in Krak\u00f3w, and also in the following months.\nThe resulting Thirteen Years' War ended in the defeat of the Teutonic Order and the 1466 Second Peace of Thorn. The Order renounced any claims to the territories of Gda\u0144sk/Eastern Pomerania and Che\u0142mno Land, which were reintegrated with Poland, and the region of Elbl\u0105g and Malbork, and Warmia, which were also recognized as part of Poland. These regions formed the new Polish province of Royal Prussia, with some local rights of autonomy. Stibor of Poniec of the Clan of Ostoja become Lord of tregality of Malbork. Much of the eastern territories, in historic Prussia, remained with the Teutonic Order, although as a fief and protectorate of Poland, also considered an integral part of \"one and indivisible\" Kingdom of Poland. The Prussian Confederation, with its members now practically divided, ceased to exist as such.\nAftermath.\nBoth the Polish and Teutonic sides agreed to seek the confirmation of the Second Peace of Thorn from Emperor Frederick III and Pope Paul II, but they also agreed that this confirmation would not be needed for validation of the treaty. Soon after, however, a dispute about the status of the Prince-Bishopric of Warmia started a smaller conflict called the War of the Priests.\nParticipating towns.\nTowns which founded the Prussian Confederation on 14 March 1440:\nTowns which joined the Prussian Confederation in 1440:\nFurther towns joined in the following years, including Cz\u0142uch\u00f3w, Pasym, Nidzica, Dzia\u0142dowo, D\u0105br\u00f3wno, Olsztynek, Prabuty, Che\u0142m\u017ca.\nFurther nobles joined following the outbreak of the Thirteen Years' War, and the towns of Dzierzgo\u0144, \u0141uczany (now Gi\u017cycko) and Nowy Staw also sided with Poland in the war, and several more also recognized Polish rule and pledged allegiance to Poland, including Czarne, Debrzno, Golub, Kowalewo, Lidzbark, \u0141asin, W\u0105brze\u017ano."}
{"id": "24188", "revid": "48764542", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24188", "title": "Parimutuel betting", "text": "Betting system in which all bets of a particular type are placed together in a pool\nParimutuel betting, or pool betting, is a betting system in which all bets of a particular type are placed together in a pool; taxes and the \"house-take\", are deducted, and payoff odds are calculated by sharing the pool among all winning bets. In some countries it is known as the tote after the totalisator, which calculates and displays bets already made.\nThe parimutuel system is used in gambling on horse racing, greyhound racing, jai alai, and other sporting events of relatively short duration in which participants finish in a ranked order. A modified parimutuel system is also used in some lottery games.\nParimutuel betting differs from fixed-odds betting in that the final payout is not determined until the pool is closed \u2014 in fixed-odds betting, the payout is agreed at the time the bet is made.\nParimutuel gambling is frequently state-regulated, and it is offered in many places where gambling is otherwise illegal. Parimutuel gambling is often also offered at \"off-track\" facilities, where players may bet on the events without actually being present to observe them in person.\nExample.\nIn a hypothetical event that has eight possible outcomes, in a country using a decimal currency such as dollars, each outcome has a certain amount of money wagered:\nThus, the total \"pool\" of money on the event is $1028.00. Following the start of the event, no more wagers are accepted. Then suppose Outcome 4 occurs. The \"payout\" is now calculated. First the \"commission\" or \"take\" for the wagering company is deducted from the pool. For example, with a commission rate of 14.25% the calculation is: $1028 \u00d7 0.1425 = $146.49. This leaves a remaining amount of $881.51. This remaining amount in the pool is now distributed to those who wagered on Outcome 4: $881.51 / $110.00 = 8.01 \u2248 $8 payout per $1 wagered. This payout includes the $1 wagered plus an additional $7 profit. Thus, the odds on Outcome 4 are 7-to-1 (or, expressed as decimal odds, 8.01).\nPrior to the event, betting agencies will often provide an approximate pay-out figure for each given outcome should no more bets be accepted after the current time. Using the wagers and commission rate above (14.25%), an approximates table in decimal odds and fractional odds would be:\nIn real-life examples, such as horse racing, the pool size often extends into millions of dollars with many different types of outcomes (winning horses) and complex commission calculations.\nSometimes, the amounts paid out are rounded down to a denomination interval \u2014 in California, Australia, and British Columbia, 10\u00a2 intervals are used. The rounding loss is known as \"breakage\" and is retained by the betting agency as part of the commission.\nIn some situations, a negative breakage may occur \u2014 for example, in horse racing when an overwhelming favorite wins (or shows or places). The parimutuel calculation results might call for a very small winning payout (say, $1.02 or $1.03 on a dollar bet), but legal regulations might require a larger payout (e.g., minimum $1.10 on a dollar bet). This condition is sometimes referred to as a minus pool.\nAlgebraic summary.\nIn an event with a set of \"n\" possible single-winner outcomes, with wagers \"W\"1, \"W\"2, ..., \"Wn\" the total pool of money on the event is\nformula_1\nAfter the wagering company deducts a commission rate of \"r\" from the pool, the amount remaining to be distributed between the successful bettors is \"W\"\"R\" = \"W\"\"T\"(1 \u2212 \"r\"). Those who bet on the successful outcome \"m\" will receive a payout of \"W\"\"R\" / \"W\"\"m\" for every dollar they bet on it.\nWhen there are \"k\" possible winners, such as a North American \"place\" bet which has \"k\" = 2 winners, the total amount to be distributed \"W\"\"R\" is first divided into \"k\" equal shares. If \"m\" is one of the \"k\" winners, those who bet on outcome \"m\" will receive a payout of (\"W\"\"R\" / \"k\") / \"W\"\"m\" for every dollar they bet on it.\nHistory.\nThe parimutuel system was invented by French-Catalan entrepreneur and showman impresario Joseph Oller in 1867.\nThe large amount of calculation involved in this system led to the invention of a specialized mechanical calculating machine known as a totalisator, \"automatic totalisator\" or \"tote board\", invented by the Australian engineer George Alfred Julius. The first was installed at Ellerslie Racecourse, Auckland, New Zealand, in 1913, and they came into widespread use at race courses throughout the world. The U.S. introduction was in 1927, which led to the opening of the suburban Arlington Racetrack in Arlington Park, near Chicago, and Sportsman's Park in Cicero, Illinois, in 1932.\nStrategy and comparison with independent bookmakers.\nUnlike many forms of casino gambling, in parimutuel betting the gambler bets against other gamblers, not the house, which necessarily implies that the bank cannot be broken. The science of predicting the outcome of a race is called handicapping.\nIndependent off-track bookmakers typically have a smaller take and thus offer better payoffs, but they are illegal in some countries. However, the introduction of Internet gambling led to \"rebate shops\". These off-shore betting shops promise to return some percentage of every bet made to the bettor. They may reduce their take from 15\u201318% to as little as 1\u20132%, while still generating a profit by operating with minimal overhead.\nBy region.\nThere may be several different types of bets, in which case each type of bet has its own pool. The basic bets involve predicting the order of finish for a single participant, as follows:\nNorth America.\nIn Canada and the United States, the most common types of bet on horse races include:\nWin, place and show wagers class as straight bets, and the remaining wagers as exotic bets. Bettors usually make multiple wagers on exotic bets. A box consists of a multiple wager in which bettors bet all possible combinations of a group of horses in the same race. A key involves making a multiple wager with a single horse in one race bet in one position with all possible combinations of other selected horses in a single race. A multi-race wheel (cf. wheel, above) consists of betting all horses in one race of a bet involving two or more races. For example, a 1-all daily double wheel bets the 1-horse in the first race with every horse in the second.\nPeople making straight bets commonly employ the strategy of an \"each way\" bet. Here the bettor picks a horse and bets it will win, and makes an additional bet that it will show, so that theoretically if the horse runs third it will at least pay back the two bets. The Canadian and American equivalent is the bet across (short for \"across the board\"): the bettor bets equal sums on the horse to win, place, and show.\nA parlay, accumulator or roll-up consists of a series of bets in which bettors stake the winnings from one race on the next in order until either the bettor loses or the series completes successfully.\nAustralia/New Zealand.\nIn Australia, certain exotic bet types can be laid as \"flexi\" bets. Usually the price of an exotic bet is determined by a set multiple of the outcome, for example $60 for a five horse boxed trifecta at one unit ($1) \u2014 or $30 at half unit (50c). If the bet is successful, the bettor will get either the full winning amount shown on the board, or half the winning amount. Under a flexi system the bettor can nominate their desired total wager, and their percentage of payout is determined by this wager's relationship to the full unit price. Using a five horse box trifecta, the bettor may wish to lay only $20 on the outcome. Their percentage of winnings is now calculated as $20/$60 = 33.3%. If the bet is successful, the payout will be 33.3% of the winning amount for a full unit bet.\nIn recent times the \"Roving Banker\" variant for Trifecta and First4 betting is now offered. For a Roving Banker First4 the player selects one, two or three runners they believe will definitely finish 1st, 2nd, 3rd or 4th, and up to three selections as Roving Banker(s) with other runners to fill the remaining place(s). A Roving Banker Trifecta is where the player believes that one or two runners will definitely finish 1st, 2nd or 3rd. The bet can be placed by picking the player's favourite runner to finish in any place within the bet and complete the Trifecta with any number of other runners to fill the other placing(s).\nUnited Kingdom.\nThe following pools are operated at meetings in mainland Britain:\nExotic wagers are usually made on horses running at the same track on the same program. In the United Kingdom, bookmakers also offer exotic wagers on horses at different tracks. Probably the Yankee occurs most commonly: in this the bettor tries to pick the winner of four races. This bet also includes subsidiary wagers on smaller combinations of the chosen horses; for example, if only two of the four horses win, the bettor still collects for their double. A Trixie requires trying to pick three winners, and a Canadian or Super Yankee trying to pick five; these also include subsidiary bets. There are also other bets which are large combinations of singles, doubles, trebles and accumulators some of them are called Lucky 15, Lucky 31, Heinz, Super Heinz, Goliath. The term nap identifies the best bet of the day.\nIreland.\nTote Ireland operates the following pools\nSweden.\nBet types for harness racing (trotting):\nHong Kong.\nThe Hong Kong Jockey Club (HKJC) operates the following common bet types and pools for horse racing.\nJapan.\nIn Japan, horse racing (\u7af6\u99ac, \"keiba\"), velodrome cycling (\u7af6\u8f2a, \"keirin\"), stock outboard powerboat racing (\u7af6\u8247, \"Ky\u014dtei\"), and paved flat track motorcycle racing (\u30aa\u30fc\u30c8\u30ec\u30fc\u30b9, \"Auto Race\") operate the following parimutuel types.

{"id": "24189", "revid": "27556023", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24189", "title": "Possession (law)", "text": "Control a person intentionally exercises towards a thing\nIn law, possession is the exercise of dominion by a person over property to the exclusion of others. To possess something, a person must have an intention to possess it and an apparent purpose to assert control over it. A person may be in possession of some piece of property without being its owner. The possession of property is commonly regulated under the property law of a jurisdiction.\nIntention to possess.\nAn intention to possess (sometimes called \"animus possidendi\") is the other component of possession. All that is required for this criterion is an intention to possess something for the time being. In common law countries, the intention to possess a thing is a question of fact that can be proven by acts of control and surrounding circumstances.\nIt is possible to intend to possess something and to actually possess it without knowing that it exists. For example, someone who intends to possess a suitcase also intends to possess its contents even if they are unknown. It is important to distinguish between the intention sufficient to obtain possession of a thing and the intention required to commit the crime of possessing something illegally, such as banned drugs, firearms or stolen goods. The intention to exclude others from accessing a suitcase and its contents does not necessarily amount to the guilty mind of intending to possess its contents illegally.\nWhen people possess places to which the public has access, it may be difficult to know whether they intend to possess everything within those places. In such circumstances, some people make it clear that they do not want possession of the things brought there by the public. For example, it is not uncommon to see a sign above a coat rack in a restaurant that disclaims responsibility for items left there.\nImportance of possession.\nPossession is one of the most important concepts in property law. There are three related and overlapping but not identical legal concepts: possession, right of possession and ownership.\nIn common law countries, possession is itself a property right. The owner of a property has the right of possession and may assign that right wholly or partially to another who may then also assign the right of possession to a third party. For example, an owner of residential property may assign the right of possession to a property manager under a property management contract, who may then assign the right of possession to a tenant under a rental agreement. There is a rebuttable presumption that https:// also has the right of possession, and evidence to the contrary may be offered to establish who has the legal right of possession to determine who should have actual possession, which may include evidence of ownership (without assignment of the right of possession) or evidence of a superior right of possession without ownership. Possession of a thing for long enough can become ownership by termination of the previous owner's right of possession and ownership rights. In the same way, the passage of time can bring to an end the owner's right to recover exclusive possession of a property without losing the ownership of it, as when an adverse easement for use is granted by a court.\nIn civil law countries, possession is not a right but a (legal) fact, which enjoys certain protection by the law. It can provide evidence of ownership but does not in itself satisfy the burden of proof. For example, ownership of a house is never proven by mere possession of a house. Possession is a factual state of exercising control over an object, whether the object is owned or not. Only a legal (possessor has legal ground), bona fide (possessor does not know lack of right to possess) and regular possession (not acquired through force or by deceit) can become ownership over passage of time. A possessor enjoys certain judicial protection against third parties even if he is not the owner.\nThere may be varying degrees of rights to possession. For example, if you leave a book that belongs to you at a cafe and the waiter picks it up, you have lost possession. When you return to recover the book, even though the waiter has possession, you have a better right to possession and the book should be returned. This example demonstrates the distinction between ownership and possession: throughout the process you have not lost ownership of the book although you have lost possession at some point; or instead, the book may have been owned by a third party (such as a lending library) throughout, despite the changes in possession.\nObtaining possession.\nPossession requires both control and intention. It is obtained from the first moment that both those conditions exist simultaneously. Usually, intention precedes control, as when you see a coin on the ground and reach down to pick it up. Nevertheless, it is conceivable that a person might obtain control of a thing before forming the intention to possess it. Someone who unknowingly sat on and therefore had control of a $10 note on the seat of a train could obtain possession by becoming aware of the note and forming the intention to possess it. People may also intend to possess things that are left without their knowledge in spaces that they control.\nPossession can be obtained by a one-sided act by which factual control is established. This can take the form of apprehension (taking an object not in someone's possession) or seizure (taking an object in someone's possession). It can also be obtained through a two-sided process of handing over the possession from one party to another. The party handing over possession must intend to do so.\nPossession acquired by consent.\nMost property possessed is obtained with the consent of someone else who possessed it. They may have been purchased, received as gifts, leased, or borrowed. The transfer of possession of goods is called delivery. For land, it is common to speak of granting or giving possession.\nA temporary transfer of possession is called a bailment. Bailment is often regarded as the separation of ownership and possession. For example, the library continues to own the book while you possess it and will have the right to possess it again when your right comes to an end. A common transaction involving bailment is a conditional sale or hire-purchase, in which the seller lets the buyer have possession of the thing before it is paid for. The buyer pays the purchase price in installments and, when it is fully paid, ownership of the thing is transferred from seller to buyer.\nPossession acquired without consent.\nIt is possible to obtain possession of a thing without anyone else's consent. First, you might take possession of something which has never been possessed before. This can occur when you catch a wild animal; or create a new thing, such as a loaf of bread. Secondly, you might find something which someone else has lost. Thirdly, you might take something from another person without their consent. Possession acquired without consent is a property right which the law protects. It gives rise to a right of possession which is enforceable against everyone except those with a better right to possession.\nForms of transferring possession.\nThere are various forms of transferring possession. One can physically hand over the object (e.g. handing over a newspaper bought at the newsstand) but it is not always necessary for the party to literally grab the object for possession to be considered transferred. It is enough that the object is within the realm of factual control (e.g. leaving a letter in the letterbox). Sometimes it is enough for a symbol of the object which enables factual control to be handed over (e.g. handing over the keys to a car or a house). One may also choose to terminate possession, as one throws a letter in the trash. Possession includes having the opportunity to terminate possession.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nDecker, John F. \"Illinois Criminal Law.\" Newark, NJ: Matthew Bender &amp; Co. 4th Ed. 2006."}

His defiance of Emperor Leo III the Isaurian as a result of the iconoclastic controversy in the Eastern Empire prepared the way for a long series of revolts, schisms, and civil wars that eventually led to the establishment of the temporal power of the popes.\nEarly life.\nBorn into a noble Roman family in the year 669, Gregory was the son of Marcellus and wife Honesta. Gregory II was an alleged collateral ancestor to the Roman Savelli family, according to a 15th-century chronicler, but this is unattested in contemporary documents and very likely unreliable. The same was said of the seventh-century Pope Benedict II, but nothing certain is known about a kinship between the two of them.\nAs a young man, he was placed in the papal court, and was made a subdeacon and sacellarius of the Roman See during the pontificate of Sergius I (687\u2013701). Later he was made a deacon and placed in charge of the Vatican Library. During Constantine's pontificate, Gregory was made a papal secretary, and accompanied the pope to Constantinople in 711 to deal with the issues raised by Rome\u2019s rejection of the canons of the Quinisext Council. The actual negotiations on the contentious articles were handled by Gregory, with the result that Emperor Justinian II agreed that the papacy could disregard whichever of the council\u2019s decisions it wished to.\nAfter Constantine\u2019s death on 9 April 715, Gregory was elected pope, and was consecrated as bishop of Rome on 19 May 715.\nFirst years and expanding missionary activity.\nAlmost immediately, Gregory began the task of repairing Rome's Aurelian Walls, beginning at the Porta Tiburtina. Work on this task was delayed in October 716 when the river Tiber burst its banks and flooded Rome, causing immense damage and only receding after eight days. Gregory ordered a number of litanies to be said to stem the floods, which spread over the Campus Martius and the so-called Plains of Nero, reaching the foot of the Capitoline Hill. The first year of his pontificate also saw a letter arrive from Patriarch John VI of Constantinople, who attempted to justify his support of Monothelitism, while at the same time seeking sympathy from the pope over the position he was in, with respect to the emperor. Gregory responded by sending a letter outlining the traditional Roman position against Monothelitism.\nThen in 716, Gregory received an official visit from Duke Theodo of Bavaria to discuss the continuing conversion of his lands to Christianity. As a result of this meeting, Gregory gave specific instructions to his delegates who were to travel to Bavaria, coordinate with the duke, and establish a local church hierarchy, overseen by an archbishop. Gregory maintained an interest in Bavaria; in 726 he forced an unwilling Corbinian, after reviewing his appeal through a synod, to abandon his monastic calling, and become bishop of Freising in upper Bavaria.\nGregory next turned his attention to Germany. In 718, he was approached by an Anglo-Saxon missionary, Winfrid, who proposed undertaking missionary work in Germany. Gregory agreed, and after changing his name to Boniface, commissioned him in May 719 to preach in Germany. After hearing of the work that had been done so far, in 722 Gregory summoned Boniface back to Rome to answer rumors concerning Boniface\u2019s doctrinal purity. At this face-to-face meeting, Boniface complained that he found Gregory\u2019s Latin difficult to understand, a clear indication that Vulgar Latin had already started to evolve into the Romance languages. After examining Boniface\u2019s written profession of faith, Gregory was satisfied enough that he made Boniface a bishop in November 722, and returned him to Germany to continue his mission. Continued successes saw Gregory write to Boniface in December 724 to offer his congratulations, followed in November 726 by a response to Boniface\u2019s questions about how to structure the newly emergent churches in Germany.\nGregory also strengthened papal authority in the churches of Britain and Ireland. In 726 Gregory was visited by Ine, the former King of Wessex, who had abdicated the throne in order to undertake a pilgrimage to Rome and end his life there.\nLocal church activities.\nGregory also concerned himself with establishing or restoring monasteries. He turned his family mansion in Rome into a monastery, St. Agatha in Suburra, endowing it with expensive and precious vessels for use at the altar, and also established a new church, dedicated to Sant'Eustachio. In 718 he restored Monte Cassino, which had not recovered from an attack by the Lombards in 584, and he intervened in a dispute at the Monastery of St. Vincent on the Volturno over the deposition of the abbot.\nIn 721, Gregory held a synod in Rome, for the purpose of fixing issues around illegitimate marriages. Then in 723, the longstanding dispute between the patriarchs of Aquileia and Grado flared up again. Upon the request of the Lombard king, Liutprand, Gregory had given the pallium to Bishop Serenus, granting him the patriarchate of Aquileia. Soon afterward, however, Gregory received a letter from Donatus, Patriarch of Grado, complaining that Serenus had overstepped his authority, and was interfering within what was Grado\u2019s ecclesiastical jurisdiction. At the same time, Gregory reprimanded Donatus for complaining about Gregory\u2019s decision to grant the pallium to Serenus in the first place. Then in 725, upon Donatus\u2019 death, the Grado patriarchate was usurped by Peter, the Bishop of Pola. Gregory responded by depriving Peter of both sees, and he wrote to the people of the diocese, reminding them to only elect bishops in accordance with church law, whereupon they elected Antoninus, with Gregory\u2019s approval.\nGregory also mandated a number of practices within the Church. He decreed that in Lent, on Thursdays, people should fast, just as they were required to do during the other days of the week. Apparently, the practice had been frowned upon by popes of previous centuries, as pagans had fasted on Thursday as part of their worship of Jupiter. He also prescribed the offices be said during church services on Thursdays in Lent, as prior to this, the Mass of the preceding Sunday was said on those Thursdays.\nRelations with the Lombards.\nGregory attempted to remain on good diplomatic terms with the Lombards, and especially with their king, Liutprand. In April 716 he managed to get Liutprand to agree not to retake the Cottian Alps, which had been granted to the Roman Church in the reign of Aripert II. However, the semi-independent Lombard Duchy of Benevento, under the expansionist duke Romuald II, resumed hostilities by capturing Cumae in 717, cutting Rome off from Naples. Neither threats of divine retribution nor outright bribery made an impression on Romuald, and so Gregory appealed to Duke John I of Naples, funding his campaign to successfully retake Cumae.\nThat same year saw the Lombard duke Faroald II of Spoleto, capture Classis, the port of Ravenna. Gregory brokered a deal with Liutprand, who forced Faroald to return it to the Exarch of Ravenna. Perceiving that the Lombard threat would continue to fester and they would take imperial territory in Italy a piece at a time, in around 721 Gregory appealed to the Franks, asking Charles Martel to intervene and drive out the Lombards. Charles however, did not respond to the request. A law issued by Liutprand in 723 (No. 33) prohibits a man from marrying the widow of his cousin on either mother's or father's side, and specifically states that the \"Pope in the city of Rome\" [papa urbis romae] had sent him a letter exhorting him to issue this legislation, indicating a degree of cordial communication between them. Imperial weakness in Italy encouraged further Lombard incursions, and in 725, they captured the fortress of Narni.\nThen in 727, with the Exarchate of Ravenna in chaos over the Byzantine Emperor\u2019s iconoclast decrees (see below), the Lombards captured and destroyed Classis and overran the Pentapolis. Although Classis was retaken in 728, fighting continued between Byzantine forces and the Lombards until 729, when Gregory brokered a deal between Liutprand and the Byzantine exarch, Eutychius, bringing about a temporary ceasing of hostilities that held until Gregory\u2019s death. Gregory and Liutprand met in 729 at the ancient city of Sutri. Here, the two reached an agreement, known as the Donation of Sutri, whereby Sutri and some hill towns in Latium (see Vetralla) were given to the papacy. They were the first extension of papal territory beyond the confines of the Duchy of Rome\nConflict with Emperor Leo III.\nTensions between Gregory and the imperial court began around 722 when emperor Leo III attempted to raise taxes on the papal patrimonies in Italy, draining the Papacy\u2019s monetary reserves. Leo required this revenue to pay for the ongoing Arab war, while Gregory needed it to provide local foodstuffs for the city of Rome, thereby relieving Rome on its reliance upon the long-distance supply of grain. The result of which was, through refusing to pay the additional taxes, Gregory encouraged the Roman populace to drive the imperial governor of Rome from the city, and Leo was unable to impose his will upon Rome, as Lombard pressure kept the exarch of Ravenna from fielding an army to bring the pope to heel.\nHowever, in 725, possibly at the emperor\u2019s request, Marinus, who had been sent from Constantinople to govern the Duchy of Rome, encouraged a conspiracy to murder the pope. Involving a duke named Basil, the Chartoularios Jordanes, and a subdeacon named Laurion, the departure of Marinus paused the plot, only to see it resume with the arrival of the new exarch, Paul. However, the plot was uncovered, and the conspirators were put to death.\nThen in 726, Leo issued an iconoclast edict, condemning possession of any icon of the saints. Although Leo made no move to enforce this edict in the west beyond having it read in Rome and Ravenna, Gregory immediately rejected the edict. Upon hearing this, the Exarchate of Ravenna rose in revolt against the imperial imposition of iconoclasm. The armies of Ravenna and the Duchy of the Pentapolis mutinied, denouncing both Exarch Paul and Leo III, and overthrew those officers who remained loyal. Paul rallied the loyalist forces and attempted to restore order, but was killed. The armies discussed electing their own emperor and marching on Constantinople, but were dissuaded by Pope Gregory from acting against Leo. At the same time, the self-described \u201cduke\u201d Exhilaratus and his son Hadrian rebelled in Naples, sided with the emperor and marched on Rome in order to kill Gregory, but were overthrown by the people and killed.\nIn 727, Gregory summoned a synod to condemn iconoclasm. According to Greek sources, principally Theophanes, it was at this point that Gregory excommunicated Leo. However, no western source, in particular, the \"Liber Pontificalis\", confirms this act by Gregory. He then dispatched two letters to Leo, denying the Imperial right to interfere in matters of doctrine. He wrote:\n\"You say: \u2018We worship stones and walls and boards.\u2019 But it is not so, O Emperor; but they serve us for remembrance and encouragement, lifting our slow spirits upwards, by those whose names the pictures bear and whose representations they are. And we worship them not as God, as you maintain, God forbid!... Even the little children mock at you. Go into one of their schools, say that you are the enemy of images, and straightway they will throw their little tablets at your head, and what you have failed to learn from the wise you may pick up from the foolish... In virtue of the power which has come down to us from St. Peter, the Prince of the Apostles, we might inflict punishment upon you, but since you have invoked one on yourself, have that, you and the counselors you have chosen... though you have so excellent a high priest, our brother Germanus, whom you ought to have taken into your counsels as father and teacher. . . . The dogmas of the Church are not a matter for the emperor, but for the bishops.\" Gregory's letters to Leo have been accused of being apocryphal, and may not accurately reflect the real content of Gregory's correspondence with Leo.\nIn 728, Leo sent to Italy a new exarch, Eutychius, to try to retrieve the situation. Eutychius sent an emissary to Rome, with instructions to kill Gregory and the chief nobility in the city, but the plot was uncovered and foiled. Next, he attempted to turn the Lombard king and dukes against the pope, but they retained their ambivalent stance, not committing one way or the other. That same year Gregory wrote to Patriarch Germanus I of Constantinople, giving the patriarch his support, and when Germanus abdicated, Gregory refused to acknowledge the new patriarch, Anastasius, nor the iconoclast rulings of a council summoned by Leo.\nIn 729, Eutychius finally managed to bring about an alliance with the Lombard king, Liutprand, and both agreed to help the other deal with their rebellious subjects. After they had subjugated the dukes of Spoleto and Benevento, bringing them under Liutprand\u2019s authority, they turned to Rome with the intent of bringing Gregory to heel. However, outside Rome, Gregory managed to break up the alliance against him, with Liutprand returning to Pavia. After this, Eutychius reached an uneasy truce with Gregory, and the pope in return forged a temporary truce between the Lombards and the Byzantines. Regardless, Gregory was still a devoted and vigorous defender of the empire. This was demonstrated in 730 when there arose another usurper, Tiberius Petasius, who raised a revolt in Tuscany. He was defeated by the exarch Eutychius, who received steady support from Pope Gregory.\nGregory died on 11 February 731, and was buried in St. Peter\u2019s Basilica. The location of his tomb has since been lost. He was subsequently canonized and is commemorated as a saint in the Roman calendar and martyrology on 13 February, although some martyrologies list him under 11 February.\nMiracle at the Battle of Toulouse (721).\nA miracle concerning Gregory II is linked to the victory over Muslim forces at the Battle of Toulouse in 721. According to the \"Liber Pontificalis\", in 720 Pope Gregory sent to Odo, Duke of Aquitaine, \"three blessed sponges/baskets of bread\". The Duke kept these, and just before the battle outside of Toulouse, he distributed small portions of these to be eaten by his troops. After the battle, it was reported that no one who had eaten a part of the sponges/baskets of bread had been killed or wounded.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\u00a0This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain:\u00a0"}

His pontificate, like that of his predecessor, was disturbed by Byzantine iconoclasm and the advance of the Lombards, in which he invoked the intervention of Charles Martel, although ultimately in vain. He was the last pope to seek the consent of the Byzantine exarch of Ravenna for his election, the last pope of Syrian origin, and the last pope born outside Europe until the election of Pope Francis 1,272 years later in 2013.\nElection.\nGregory was the son of a Syrian Christian named Ioannes, Yohannan or John. He was elected pope by popular acclamation on 11 February 731, but was not formally consecrated as bishop of Rome until 18 March, after having received the approval of the Byzantine exarch of Ravenna. He was the last pope to seek the exarch's ratification of a papal election.\nAnti-iconoclasm.\nImmediately upon his accession, Gregory appealed to Emperor Leo III to moderate his position on iconoclasm. When Gregory's representative was arrested on the orders of the emperor, Gregory called a synod in November 731, which condemned iconoclasm outright. Leo responded by trying to bring the pope under control, but the fleet he sent to enforce the imperial will was shipwrecked in the Adriatic Sea. He then proceeded to appropriate papal territories in Sicily and Calabria, and transferred ecclesiastical jurisdictions in the former praetorian prefecture of Illyricum to the patriarch of Constantinople. However, his attempt to force the duke of Naples to enforce an imperial decree to confiscate papal territory in the duchy failed, as the duke was supportive of the pope's stand.\nGregory, in the meantime, demonstrated his opposition to iconoclasm by emphasising his veneration of icons and relics. He repaired or beautified numerous churches, which involved their decoration with icons and images of Jesus Christ, the Virgin Mary and the saints. He ordered to be erected in the heart of St. Peter's Basilica an \"iconostasis\", situated between six onyx and marble columns which had been sent to Gregory as a gift from the exarch Eutychius. He built a new oratory in St. Peter's Basilica to house the relics of a number of saints, convoking a synod in 732 in order to regulate the prayers and masses to be said there. Gregory was an enthusiastic supporter of monasticism; he established the monastery of St. Chrysogonus and rebuilt the hospice of Saints Sergius and Bacchus, near St. Peter's, endowing it for the support of the poor.\nEcclesiastical policy.\nA temporary lull in the conflict between the Byzantines and the Lombards allowed Gregory to deal with some longstanding internal issues, in particular the ongoing jurisdictional dispute between the patriarchs of Grado and Aquileia. Although the Synod of 731 had adjudicated in this matter in favour of Grado, Gregory was forced to reprimand the patriarch of Aquileia, Calixtus, who had attempted to gain possession of the island of Barbana from Grado's jurisdiction. In 731, he approved the election of Tatwine as archbishop of Canterbury, after the latter came to Rome in person to ask for the pallium. Gregory approved of the election of his successor, Nothhelm, while in 735 he agreed to the request of King Ceolwulf of Northumbria that Bishop Egbert of York should be elevated to the rank of archbishop.\nGregory promoted the Church in northern Europe. He supported the continuing mission of Saint Boniface in Germany, elevating him to the rank of archbishop of Germany in 732; and, after a personal visit to Rome from Boniface in 737, where he was meant to attend a synod which does not appear to have been held, Gregory made Boniface a papal legate in Germany, and asked him to reorganize the episcopal sees in Germany. Gregory sent Boniface back to Bavaria with three letters. One commanded the bishops and higher ecclesiastical officers to provide Boniface with as much help as they could. A second was addressed to the nobles and people of Germany, urging them to obey Boniface. A third, addressed to the bishops in Alamannia and Bavaria, confirmed Boniface's status as the papal vicar, ordering them to assemble in a council twice a year at Augsburg under Boniface's authority. Gregory promoted the mission of Willibald in Germany.\nIn 732, Gregory banned the consumption of horse meat, both domestic and wild, anathematizing it as an \"abomination\" since it was associated with pagan ritual feasting.\nLombard threat.\nConscious of the ongoing Lombard threat, Gregory undertook and completed the restoration of the Aurelian Walls during the early 730s. He also refortified Centumcellae, purchasing from Thrasimund II of Spoleto the fortress of Gallese along the Via Flaminia, which had been taken by the Lombards, interrupting Rome's communications with the exarch at Ravenna. The return of the Lombard king Liutprand in 737 saw a renewal of the Lombard assault on the Exarchate of Ravenna.\nGregory's opposition to Byzantine iconoclasm did not stop his lending support to the Byzantine Empire to help in the recapture of Ravenna after it had fallen to the Lombards in around 738. In that same year, Liutprand demanded that the Lombard dukes of Spoleto and Beneventum ravage the area around the Duchy of Rome; but both refused, citing a treaty with the pope. Gregory then actively encouraged the rebellion of Thrasimund, forcing Liutprand to temporarily abandon his attacks on the exarchate, turning his attention towards Spoleto, which Liutprand annexed. Thrasimund was forced to flee Spoleto, seeking refuge in Rome, where he was welcomed by Gregory.\nBy the middle of 739, Liutprand was encroaching once again on the Exarchate and threatening Rome. In desperation, Gregory sent ambassadors to Charles Martel, the Frankish mayor of the Palace, begging him to intervene on the pope's behalf. Although Gregory stated that he was willing to give up his allegiance to the Eastern Empire and place himself under the protection of the Franks, Charles made no promise to assist, since he was fully occupied by the Umayyad invasion of Gaul. Gregory himself referred to these Saracen Muslims as \"gens ferocissima\" or \"that most fierce nation\". The Lombard capture of the towns of Ameria, Ortas, Polimartium and Blera once again caused Gregory to write to Charles, this time in even greater tones of despair, beseeching his aid:\nOur affliction moves us to write to you once again, trusting that you are a loving son of St. Peter and of us, and that, from respect for him, you will come and defend the Church of God and His peculiar people, who are now unable to endure the persecution and oppression of the Lombards. They have seized the very means set aside to furnish funds for the lights ever kept burning at St. Peter's tomb, and they have carried off offerings that have been made by you and by those who have gone before you. And because, after God, we have turned to you, the Lombards deride and oppress us. Hence the Church of St. Peter has been stripped and reduced to the last straits. We have put into the mouth of the bearer of this letter, your faithful servant all our woes, which he will be able to unfold to you. Please come at once, to show your love towards St. Peter, and us, his own people.\nThis time Charles Martel did send an embassy to Rome, and this implicit support, together with the beginnings of fever running through his troops, forced Liutprand to march back to Pavia by the end of August 739. Taking advantage of this withdrawal, Gregory agreed to support Thrasimund II's return to Spoleto. Thrasimund II forced his way back in by December 739 with Roman armed support, but refused to hand over the four captured towns he had promised in exchange for papal support. Learning that Charles Martel was sick, Liutprand once again returned to attacking the Exarchate in 740, forcing Gregory yet again to appeal to the Franks, who again refused to become involved.\nDeath.\nUnsuccessful at stopping the Lombard advance, Gregory III died on 28 November 741. He was succeeded by Pope Zachary. He was buried in St. Peter's Basilica, in the oratory he had built at the start of his pontificate. Gregory's feast day is now celebrated on 10\nDecember.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

His pontificate was notable for the papacy\u2019s attempts to intervene in the quarrels between Emperor Louis the Pious and his sons. It also saw the breakup of the Carolingian Empire in 843.\nRise to papacy.\nThe son of a Roman patrician called John, Gregory was apparently an energetic but mild churchman, renowned for his learning. Consecrated a priest during the pontificate of Pope Paschal I, at the time of Pope Valentine\u2019s death in 827, Gregory was the cardinal priest of the Basilica of St Mark in Rome. Like his predecessor, Gregory was nominated by the nobility, and the electors unanimously agreed that he was the most worthy to become the bishop of Rome. They found him at the Basilica of Saints Cosmas and Damian where, despite his protestations, he was taken and installed at the Lateran Palace, after which he was enthroned as pope-elect sometime in October 827. Gregory\u2019s elevation to the papal see is believed to represent a continuation of the attempts to control the local political situation in Rome which had begun during Pope Eugene II\u2019s pontificate.\nGregory's consecration was delayed until 29 March 828, when he received notice of the Emperor Louis the Pious\u2019 approval of his election. This delay was enforced by the imperial envoys, who insisted that the Constitution of 824 expressly forbid the consecration of any pope-elect until the emperor had satisfied himself of the validity of the election. It was said that the emperor reprimanded Gregory for attempting to have himself consecrated before receiving the approval of the emperor. Gregory complied with these demands of imperial supremacy, and in 828 and 829, the pope sent embassies to Louis for unspecified discussions.\nIn January 829, Gregory was involved in a dispute with Farfa Abbey over the ownership of local monastic land by the Roman church. In a court run by a bishop and a representative of the emperor, and in the presence of Gregory, Abbot Ingoald of Farfa claimed that the Frankish emperors had granted them the lands, and that Popes Adrian I and Leo III had taken possession of the land illegally. The imperial representative made a ruling in favour of the abbey, and that the lands were to be restored to the monastery. Although Gregory refused to accept the ruling, there is no evidence that he managed to get the decision overturned.\nCarolingian quarrels.\nIn 817, by a solemn deed, confirmed by Paschal I, Louis had made a division of the empire in favour of his three sons from his first marriage: the future emperor Lothair I, Pepin I of Aquitaine, and Louis the German. Over time, papal dependence on the Carolingian emperor was loosened through the quarrels of Louis the Pious and his sons. Louis\u2019 decision to jettison the agreement of 817 regarding the division of the empire by assigning a kingdom to his youngest son, Charles the Bald, in 829 was criticized by Gregory in a letter to the Frankish bishops. The following year (October 830), after a brief rebellion and reconciliation between Louis and his sons, Gregory declared that Louis\u2019 second wife, Judith, was to be released from the convent where she had been forced to take the veil, and to be returned to Louis.\nWhen the war between father and sons resumed in Easter 833, Gregory was approached by Lothair, seeking his intervention to bring about reconciliation between Lothair and his father. He was convinced to leave Rome and travel up to join Lothair, in hopes that his intervention would promote peace, but in practice this action annoyed the Frankish bishops who followed Louis, who believed that Gregory was actively supporting Lothair. Suspicious of Gregory\u2019s intent, they refused to obey the pope, and threatened to excommunicate him, were he to excommunicate them, and even to depose him as pope. Annoyed by their actions, Gregory's response was to insist upon the papal supremacy, the papacy being superior to the emperor. He stated:\n\u201dYou professed to have felt delighted when you heard of my arrival, thinking that it would have been of great advantage for the emperor and the people; you added that you would have obeyed my summons had not a previous intimation of the emperor prevented you. But you ought to have regarded an order from the Apostolic See as not less weighty than one from the emperor. ...The government of souls, which belongs to bishops, is more important than the imperial, which is only concerned with the temporal. Your assertion that I have only come to blindly excommunicate is shameless, and your offer to give me an honourable reception if I should have come exactly in the way the emperor wanted me to is contemptuous. With regards to the oaths I have taken to the emperor, I will avoid perjury by pointing out to the emperor what he has done against the unity and peace of the Church and his kingdom. With regards to the bishops, in opposing my efforts in behalf of peace, what they threaten has not been done, from the beginning of the Church.\u201d\nRegardless of this claim, the vast bulk of the Frankish bishops maintained that the pope had no business interfering in the internal affairs of the kingdom, or in expecting the Frankish clergy to follow his lead in such matters. Their position was clear, that the equality of all the bishops outranked the leadership of the pope.\nThe armies of Louis and two of his sons met at Rotfeld, near Colmar, on 24 June 833. The sons persuaded Gregory to go to Louis's camp to negotiate, and initially Louis refused to treat Gregory with any honour. However, Gregory managed to convince Louis of his good faith, and returned to Lothair to arrange a peace. However, Gregory soon learned that he had been deceived by Lothair. Gregory was prevented from returning to the emperor, while Louis was deserted by his supporters and was forced to surrender unconditionally; Louis was deposed and humiliated at the Campus Mendacii, and Lothair was proclaimed emperor. Following these events, Gregory returned to Rome. A second fraternal quarrel resulted in Louis being restored in 834, but his position was sufficiently weakened that Lothair retained the Kingdom of Italy.\nThe emperor then sent a delegation to see Gregory, headed by Archbishop Ansgar of Hamburg-Bremen, to question the pope on the events which led to Louis\u2019s removal from the throne by Lothair. Gregory swore an oath that his intentions were honourable, and that he had always sought to achieve a peaceful solution to the conflict between Louis and his sons. Accepting Gregory\u2019s word, the envoys returned to Louis. After this failure in dabbling in imperial politics, Gregory by and large focused his attention for the rest of his pontificate in dealing with internal church matters.\nIn 836, Lothair, in his role as king of the Lombards, began stripping the possessions of the Roman church. After appealing to Louis, the emperor sent an imperial envoy to investigate the matter. Although Gregory was sick, he managed to advise the envoy of the situation, and asked him to take a letter to the emperor outlining Lothair\u2019s attacks on the Church, which they managed to get past Lothair\u2019s troops at Bologna. Then in 840, with Louis\u2019 death and the accession of Lothair as emperor, war again erupted between the sons of Louis. Gregory made unsuccessful attempts to mediate in the conflict that ensued between the brothers, sending Archbishop George of Ravenna as his representative. According to Prudentius of Troyes, George faithfully tried to achieve his objective, but failed due to Lothair\u2019s refusal to allow George to see Lothair\u2019s brothers. However, according to Andreas Agnellus, George tried to bribe Lothair to make his archbishopric independent of Rome, and was captured at the Battle of Fontenoy. The subsequent Treaty of Verdun in 843 broke up the empire of Charlemagne, with Lothair retaining the imperial title and control of Italy.\nBuilding activities and religious issues.\nGregory repaired the Aqua Traiana, which had been damaged during the pontificate of Leo III. Sometime after 841 Gregory rebuilt and fortified parts of the port of Ostia against the attacks of Saracens, renaming it \"Gregoriopolis\". Around the same time he restored the colony of Galeria along the Via Portuensis, while also establishing a new colony, called Draco, along the left bank of the Tiber River, some eleven miles from Rome along the Via Ostiensis. This was the first clear example of land development undertaken by a pope within his own territory.\nGregory contributed to the architectural development of Rome. In 833, Gregory completely rebuilt St Mark\u2019s Basilica in Rome, adorning the walls with Byzantine-style mosaics, as well as a number of other churches which he either repaired or rebuilt. He rebuilt the atrium of St. Peter\u2019s Basilica, and within the newly decorated chapel within the basilica he transferred the body of Saint Gregory, and from the Catacombs of Rome, he moved Saint Sebastian, Saint Tiburtius, and Saint Gorgonius. He raised the altar in the church of Santa Maria in Trastevere, and founded a monastery close to the church.\nGregory\u2019s pontificate witnessed the end of the iconoclasm controversy in the Byzantine Empire, while Gregory himself promoted the celebration of the feast of All Saints within the Frankish kingdom on both sides of the Rhine River. Gregory is also known for his appointment of Ansgar as archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen in 832, and as the apostolic legate to the northern and eastern parts of Europe. On 31 March 837 Gregory sent the Pallium to the archbishop of Salzburg; he also sent one to Venerius, the patriarch of Grado, in 828, in support of his claims to have jurisdiction over the bishops of Istria. When a synod awarded jurisdiction to Maxentius, the patriarch of Aquileia, Venerius appealed to Gregory, who supported him. Meanwhile, King Lothair backed Maxentius, who forced the bishops of Istria to obey him, while at the same time ignoring Gregory\u2019s orders to cease. Gregory also supported the candidacy of John IV (bishop of Naples).\nGregory was also asked to arbitrate during his journey to Francia in 833 the case against Aldric of Le Mans, who was being forced out of his see by partisans of Lothair. On 8 July 833 Gregory wrote to the bishops of \u201cGaul, Europe and Germany\u201d declaring that Aldric had every right to appeal to the pope, and that until the pope had issued a judgement one way or the other, no-one could pass a sentence against him. Further, that this mandate had to be obeyed in order to remain in communion with the Roman church. The letter together with the restoration of Louis allowed Aldric to remain in his see for some time.\nGregory was also asked by emperor Louis\u2019s representative, Amalarius of Metz, to provide an antiphonary for use at church services at Metz, to which Gregory was forced to admit that he had none suitable for the emperor, as he had already given a number to Wala of Corbie, which he had already taken to Francia.\nOn 25 January 844 Gregory IV died, and was buried in St. Peter\u2019s Basilica. He was succeeded by Sergius II.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

A member of the Salian dynasty, he was made pope by his cousin, Emperor Otto III.\nFamily.\nBruno was a son of Otto I, Duke of Carinthia, a member of the Salian dynasty who was a grandson of Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor, and his wife, Judith of Carinthia, most likely a member of the Luitpolding dynasty. He is the only pope who was born in modern Austria, and is sometimes referred to as \"the first German pope\" or as \"the only Austrian pope\". German and Austrian identities were not clearly differentiated at the time of Gregory's life.\nPapal election.\nBruno was the chaplain of his cousin, Emperor Otto III, who presented him as a candidate and arranged his election. Bruno was elected and succeeded John XV as pope, taking the name Gregory V to honour Pope Gregory the Great; he thus became the first pope to choose a regnal name for a reason other than avoiding a name that was too pagan or that of Saint Peter. He is often counted as the first German pope (or the second if Boniface II, an Ostrogoth, is counted). Following Otto's return to Germany, Gregory was forced to flee Rome, after the election of antipope John XVI, whom Crescentius II and the nobles of Rome had chosen against the will of Otto III.\nPolicies.\nPolitically, Gregory acted consistently as the Emperor's representative in Rome and granted many exceptional privileges to monasteries within the Holy Roman Empire. One of his first acts was to crown Otto III emperor on 21 May 996. Together, they held a synod a few days after the coronation in which Arnulf, Archbishop of Reims, was ordered to be restored to his See of Reims, and Gerbert of Aurillac, was condemned as an intruder. King Robert II of France, who had been insisting on his right to appoint bishops, was ultimately obliged to retract his claim, and also to put aside his wife, Bertha of Burgundy, by the rigorous enforcement of a sentence of excommunication on the kingdom.\nUntil the conclusion of the council of Pavia in 997, John XVI and Crescentius were in possession of Rome. The revolt of Crescentius II was decisively suppressed by Otto III, who marched upon Rome. John XVI fled, and Crescentius shut himself up in the Castel Sant'Angelo. The Emperor's troops pursued the antipope, captured him, cut off his nose and ears, cut out his tongue, blinded him, and publicly degraded him before Otto III and Gregory V. When the much respected St. Nilus of Rossano castigated both the Emperor and Pope for their cruelty, John XVI was sent to the monastery of Fulda in Germany, where he lived until c.\u20091001. The Castel Sant'Angelo was besieged, and when it was taken in 998, Crescentius was hanged upon its walls.\nDeath.\nPope Gregory V died suddenly on 18 February 999, at around 27 years old. The exact cause of his death is not known. Some later writers suggested he may have been poisoned, but there is no strong evidence to support this, and most modern historians treat it as uncertain.\nHe was buried in St. Peter\u2019s Basilica in Rome, near the tomb of Pope Pelagius I. His original tomb no longer exists, as it was likely removed during major rebuilding work on the basilica in the 16th century. However, records from that time mention his epitaph and burial location.\nGregory was succeeded by Gerbert of Aurillac, who took the name Pope Sylvester II. This helped continue the strong connection between the papacy and the Holy Roman Empire under Emperor Otto III.\nLegacy.\nPope Gregory V\u2019s time as pope was important in the growing connection between the papacy and the Holy Roman Empire during the late 10th century. As the first pope from what is now Austria and Germany, his election showed how much influence the Ottonian emperors had over the Church at that time.\nPope Gregory V worked closely with his cousin, Emperor Otto III, and supported imperial policies in Church matters. He gave special rights to many monasteries in the empire and took part in settling disputes over who should be bishops, including in the important cities of Reims and Canterbury.\nMany historians see Pope Gregory V as a figure who represented a turning point in the Church's history. His reign highlighted the close ties between the papacy and the empire, but also the problems that came with that relationship. Some of the issues that arose during his papacy, such as disputes over Church appointments and papal authority, would become major topics in later Church reforms\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was also the godfather of Pope Benedict IX, who, at the age of twenty, was foisted on the papacy by his powerful family, the Theophylacti, counts of Tusculum. Benedict IX, wishing to marry and vacate the position into which he had been thrust by his family, consulted his godfather as to whether he could resign the pontificate. When he was convinced that he might do so, he offered to give up the papacy into the hands of his godfather if he would reimburse him for his election expenses. Desirous of ridding the See of Rome of such an unworthy pontiff, John Gratian paid him the money and was recognized as Pope in his stead.\nThe accession of John Gratian, who took the name Gregory VI, did not bring peace, though it was hailed with joy even by such a strict upholder of the right as Peter Damian. When Benedict IX left the city after selling the papacy, there was already another aspirant to the Roman see in the field. John, bishop of Sabina, had been hailed as Pope Sylvester III by the faction of the nobility that had driven Benedict IX from Rome in 1044, and had then installed him in his place. Though Benedict IX soon returned, and forced Sylvester III to retire to his See of Sabina, Sylvester never gave up his claims to the papal throne, and through his political allies contrived apparently to keep some hold on a portion of Rome. To complicate matters, Benedict IX, unable to obtain the bride on whom he had set his heart, soon repented his resignation, claimed the papacy again, and in his turn is thought to have succeeded in acquiring dominion over a part of the city.\nPapacy.\nWith an empty exchequer and a clergy that had largely lost the savour of righteousness, Gregory VI was confronted by an almost hopeless task. Nevertheless, with the aid of his \"capellanus\" or chaplain, Hildebrand, destined to be Pope Gregory VII, he tried to bring about civil and religious order. He strove to effect the latter by means of letters and councils, and the former by force of arms. But the factions of his rivals were too strong to be put down, and the confusion only increased.\nConvinced that nothing could meet the challenges facing the Church except imperial intervention, a number of influential clergy and laity separated themselves from communion with Gregory VI or either of his two rivals and implored King Henry III of Germany to cross the Alps and restore order. Henry III responded to these pleas by descending into Italy in the autumn of 1046. Strong in the conviction of his innocence, Gregory VI went north to meet him. He was received by Henry III with all the honour due to a pope, and in accordance with the royal request, summoned a council to meet at Sutri.\nSynod of Sutri.\nOnly Sylvester III and Gregory VI presented themselves at the Synod of Sutri, which was opened on 20 December 1046. The claims of Sylvester III and Benedict IX were quickly rejected, and the former was condemned to be confined in a monastery for the rest of his life. Gregory VI was accused of purchasing the papacy and freely admitted it; he nevertheless denied that this act, given the circumstances, constituted the crime of simony. The bishops of the synod assured Gratian that this act was indeed simoniacal, regardless of his virtuous motivations for it, and called upon him to resign. Seeing that little choice was left to him, he complied of his own accord and laid down his office.\nGregory VI was succeeded in the papacy by the German bishop of Bamberg, Suidger, who took the name Pope Clement II. In May 1047 Gregory was taken by Henry to Germany; he died in 1048, probably at Cologne. To the end he was accompanied by Hildebrand, who (after about a year in Cluny) returned to Rome in January 1049 with the newly elected Pope Leo IX. And when Hildebrand himself was elected pope in 1073, he called himself Pope Gregory VII in order to proclaim his firm and loyal belief in the legitimacy of Gratian as Pope Gregory VI.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Becoming Pope after a long diplomatic career as Apostolic Chancellor, he was notable in his brief reign for reconciling the Papacy with the estranged Holy Roman Empire and for initiating the Third Crusade.\nEarly life.\nAlberto di Morra was born about 1105 in Benevento. His father was the nobleman Sartorius di Morra. He became a monk early in life, either as a Cistercian in Laon, or a Benedictine at Monte Cassino. Alberto later joined a new religious order, the Premonstratensian or Norbertine order, probably between the ages of 20\u201330. He was a canon at St. Martin's Abbey in Laon. He later became a professor of canon law in Bologna.\nCardinal.\nIn 1156, Pope Adrian IV made him cardinal-deacon of Sant'Adriano, and on 14 March 1158 he became cardinal-priest of San Lorenzo in Lucina. As a papal legate of Pope Alexander III, he was sent to teach canon law throughout Europe in the 1160s, and was sent to Portugal to crown Afonso I. He also brought an offer of reconciliation in 1163 to Holy Roman Emperor Frederick I Barbarossa, whom Pope Alexander III had excommunicated in 1160. Alexander also sent him to England to investigate the murder of Thomas Becket, and he absolved King Henry II of the murder during the Council of Avranches. From 1177 to 1179, Alberto also served as a legate in Italy and in February 1178 was named Chancellor of the Holy Roman Church. As Chancellor he generally pursued a conciliatory line toward the Emperor; in the controversy over the disputed succession of the Archbishop of Trier he argued strongly in favor of setting aside both the pro-papal candidate Folmar of Karden and the pro-imperial Rudolf of Wied, and allowing the canons of Trier to hold a new election, but was overruled by Pope Urban III. It was in this position that di Morra \"...compiled a \"Forma Dicendi\", a collection of official papal acts, and also completed a codification of the cursus, a compilation of the very stringent rules governing the euphonious arrangements of sentence endings and phrasing in papal acts. In his honor, the cursus was called \"stylus gregorianus\".\" These two documents were very influential in shaping the rhetoric used in papal documents. Shortly before his election to the papacy, Alberto founded a monastery in his hometown of Benevento.\nPapacy.\nOn 21 October 1187, the day after the death of Urban III, Alberto di Morra, at that time Protopriest of the College of Cardinals, was elected pope (after Henry of Marcy had withdrawn his name from consideration), and took the name Gregory VIII in honour of Gregory VII. He was consecrated on 25 October. His previous dealings with Frederick Barbarossa put the church back in a friendly relationship with the Holy Roman Emperor. In response to the defeat of the crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem at the Battle of Hattin, Gregory issued the papal bull \"Audita tremendi\" calling for the Third Crusade. Gregory travelled to Pisa in order to end Pisan hostilities with Genoa so that both seaports and naval fleets could join for the crusade. On the way to Pisa, he stopped at Lucca and ordered Antipope Victor IV's body to be removed from his tomb and his remains thrown out of the church.\nDeath.\nGregory died in Pisa on 17 December 1187 of a fever after holding the papacy for only 57 days. He was buried in the Duomo in Pisa; the tomb and the papal remains were destroyed in the 1600 fire of the cathedral. He was succeeded by Clement III. According to Joseph S. Brusher, \"His pontificate though brief was glorious.\"\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was elected at the conclusion of a papal election that ran from 1268 to 1271, the longest papal election in the history of the Catholic Church.\nHe convened the Second Council of Lyon and also made new regulations in regards to the papal conclave. Gregory was beatified by Pope Clement XI in 1713 after the confirmation of his cultus.\nGregory's regulations on the conduct of the conclave, though briefly annulled by Adrian V and John XXI, remained standard practice until the 20th century. Gregory's rules were dispensed in certain extraordinary circumstances, offering greater latitude in regulating an upcoming conclave, such as by Pope Pius VI in 1798, in consideration of the occupation of Rome by the French, and by Pope Pius IX in 1878, fearing a potential Vatican invasion could prevent or dominate a papal election.\nEarly life.\nTeobaldo Visconti, a member of the Visconti family, was born in Piacenza around 1210.\nIt is said that he began his career by attaching himself to the household of the Cistercian Cardinal Giacomo di Pecorari, Bishop of Palestrina (1231\u20131244), who was also from Piacenza. He was attracted by the reputation of holiness which the Cardinal enjoyed; he had been elected abbot of the monastery of Trois-Fontaines in Champagne. Teobaldo became the Cardinal's Oeconomus or Majordomo, and was therefore in constant attendance. The Cardinal was Legate of Pope Gregory IX in Tuscany in 1235, in Lombardy in 1236\u20131237, and in Provence, France and Germany in 1239\u20131241. It was probably during the assignment in Provence that Teobaldo became known to important French clergy and laity. He was already Canon of the Basilica of S. Antonino in Piacenza when he returned to Piacenza on business of the Cardinal in 1239.\nHe then returned to the Cardinal, whose new assignment in France was actually to preach a crusade against Frederick II, the Hohenstaufen Emperor, who was again at war with Pope Gregory IX. Early in 1239, the Pope had again excommunicated the Emperor. Each had demanded an Ecumenical Council to settle their differences. The Pope was willing, but he planned that the council would meet under his auspices and in his territory. He would also bring to Rome all of the enemies of Frederick Hohenstaufen. It was at this point in 1240 that Teobaldo also became a Canon of the Cathedral of Lyons, at the request of the Canons made to Cardinal Giacomo de Pecorari when a vacancy in their number occurred. Pope Gregory's ecumenical council never took place, and he died on 22 August 1241.\nThe search for a successor to Gregory IX took more than two months. The new Pope, Celestine IV, who was old and ill, survived his election by only 17 days, dying on 10 November 1241. The second electoral assembly of 1241 did not take place for some time, however. The cardinals who were in Rome at the pope's death, having endured considerable mistreatment during the Vacancy of 22 August 1241 to 25 October 1241, which they did not want to endure again, scattered immediately. Only a half-dozen of the 12 cardinals remained in the city. It was not until June 1243 that all the Cardinals, assembled at Anagni and not in Rome, elected Cardinal Sinibaldo Fieschi of Genoa as Pope Innocent IV. In 1243, when the Bishop of Piacenza died, Innocent IV offered the position to Archdeacon Teobaldo, who declined, preferring to follow in the company of Cardinal Giacomo. Cardinal Giacomo, however, died in Rome on 25 June 1244.\nFrance.\nUpon the death of his patron and spiritual model, Teobaldo decided not to remain any longer in the Curia, planning to travel to Paris, where he would study theology. When he reached Lyons, however, he was received by the Archbishop-elect, Philippe, who asked him to be the \"dominus\" and \"magister\" of the household. Teobaldo initially refused, but the Archbishop insisted and finally Teobaldo accepted the position.\nIn July 1244, Pope Innocent IV was forced by Frederick II Augustus to flee from Rome. He first travelled to his native Genoa, and then headed to Lyons, where the idea of an ecumenical council took shape. Teobaldo helped to organize the Ecumenical Council which met at Lyons in June and July 1245. During this period, Visconti became acquainted with people such as Bonaventure, Thomas Aquinas, Gui Foucois, Pierre de Tarentaise and Matteo Rubeo Orsini, all of whom were participants in the council. Visconti was appointed Archdeacon of Heinault in the diocese of Li\u00e8ge on 9 September 1246, perhaps as a reward for his services. He was instructed by Pope Innocent IV (Sinibaldo Fieschi, 1243\u20131254) to preach the crusade for the recovery of the Holy Land. Such preaching had more of a financial character than one might think, since both Crusaders and Papacy were desperate to raise funds. Teobaldo was not able to do much more than preach, sacerdotally, since he still was not a priest.\nTeobaldo's time in Li\u00e8ge was evidently not a happy one. The bishop whom he had come to know at the Council of Lyons, Robert de Thorete, died after a brief illness on 16 October 1246. There had been a struggle for the episcopal seat when he was appointed. The Provost of Utrecht, the candidate of Frederick II, had attempted to usurp the seat, and Cardinal Giacomo de Pecorari, Bishop of Palestrina had been ordered by the Pope to intervene and prohibit an election until the canons of the cathedral could meet with him. But the vacancy of the papal throne occurred after the death of Pope Gregory IX, and lasted until June 1243. In that interval the squabbling electors came to an understanding, and on 30 October 1240, Robert, the brother of the Bishop of Verdun, was chosen. Another struggle between two candidates ensued on his death, and Cardinal Robert Capocci was sent to settle the election. Since Teobaldo was a canon as well as Archdeacon, he was directly involved. The successful candidate, on 10 October 1247, Henry III of Guelders, was a worldly man, the brother of Otto II, Count of Guelders, and was not yet in Holy Orders. In fact, for the next twelve years, he was neither ordained priest nor consecrated bishop. The new Bishop-Elect and his Archdeacon immediately had problems about Teobaldo's conduct of his office while being absent in Paris, an issue which was not settled until the end of 1250.\nFinally, in 1258, Henry of Guelders was consecrated. He also had himself elected Abbot of the famous Monastery of Stabulo (Stavelo). This did not mean that he gave up his former dissolute military life. In 1262, he clashed with Archdeacon Teobaldo. During a Chapter meeting, he was roundly criticized by Teobaldo, who accused him of compromising the virtue of Berta, daughter of Conrardi de Coen le Frison, by force. The Bishop threatened to strike the Archdeacon. Consequently, few days later, Teobaldo was moved to leave Li\u00e8ge, and it is said that he undertook a pilgrimage to the Holy Land. He actually got as far as Paris, where he resumed his long-standing plan of studying theology. During this time he became a friend of King Louis IX.\nVisconti left Li\u00e8ge in 1267 for Paris at the behest of Pope Clement IV who sent him to England to assist Cardinal Ottobono Fieschi, who had been appointed Papal Legate in England in 1265, to support King Henry III in the rebellion of the barons, led by Simon de Montfort. It was during this assignment that Teobaldo became friends with Prince Edward of England (the future Edward I), with whom he went on Crusade. Cardinal Fieschi returned to Viterbo, and participated in the conclave of 1268\u20131271. Edward took the cross on 24 June 1268, followed Louis IX to Tunisia, and finally reached Acre on 9 May 1271.\nPapal election.\nVisconti was elected to succeed Pope Clement IV on 1 September 1271 after the papal chair had been vacant for two years and nine months, due to divisions among the cardinals. The College of Cardinals, meeting in Viterbo where Pope Clement IV (1265\u20131268) had died, was equally divided between the French and Italian cardinals. The French wanted a pope from their own country, influenced by Charles of Anjou, the younger brother of King Louis IX of France, who had been invested with the throne of Sicily by Pope Clement IV (1265\u20131268). Charles had also successfully intrigued to have himself elected Senator of Rome, and he repeatedly intervened in the political affairs of the entire Italian peninsula. He had entered Rome on 23 May 1265 where he was made Senator and was proclaimed king of Sicily. On 6 January 1266, he was crowned in St. Peter's Basilica by Cardinals Riccardo Annibaldi, Raoul de Grosparmy, Ancher Pantaleoni, Matteo Orsini, and Goffredo da Alatri, with permission of Pope Clement IV, who did not dare to approach Rome himself due to the hostility of the Ghibelline government toward him.\nThe deadlock was not even broken when the citizens of Viterbo locked up the cardinals in the Episcopal palace where they were meeting, and finally tearing off part of the roof of the building. Finally, in August 1271, the Cardinals decided to appoint a committee, three of their number from each side, to negotiate a settlement (Election by Compromise). When the six could not agree, however, on the choice of one of the cardinals, they decided to look outside their ranks. They settled on Teobaldo Visconti, the Archdeacon of Li\u00e8ge. Their decision was ratified by all of the Cardinals on 1 September 1271. This was a victory, in fact, for the French-leaning faction, since Teobaldo had intimate connections with France, and his nephew, Vicedomino de Vicedomini, a native of Piacenza but Archbishop of Aix in Provence, had been a follower and advisor of Charles of Anjou ever since he came into Italy.\nThe election of Visconti, after a two-year, nine-month struggle, came as a complete surprise to him, since it took place while he was engaged in the Ninth Crusade at Acre in Palestine with King Edward I of England. Not wanting to abandon his mission, his first action, upon hearing of his election, was to send out appeals for aid to the Crusaders. At his final sermon at Acre just before setting sail for Italy, he famously remarked, quoting Psalm 137: \"If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget her cunning.\"\nNonetheless, Visconti had to return to Italy immediately, since he had been summoned by the Cardinals in order to accept the election at their hands. On 1 January 1272, the Pope-Elect reached Brindisi. After another month of travel, he arrived in Viterbo, the site of the Election, where the Cardinals were waiting, in early February 1272. On some unknown date over the next few weeks after his arrival, he completed the Election by accepting the Papacy; it was in Viterbo that he assumed the papal mantle. But he was still careful to call himself \"Episcopus-electus\". On 13 March 1272, he entered Rome with the entire Roman Curia. Since he was not in Holy Orders, he had to be ordained a priest, which took place on 19 March 1272. He was consecrated a bishop and finally crowned on 27 March 1272 at St. Peter's Basilica.\nDiplomatic communications with Mongols.\nAs soon as he was elected in 1271, Pope Gregory X received a letter from the Mongol Great Khan Kublai, remitted by Niccol\u00f2 and Maffeo Polo following their travels to his court in Mongolia. Kublai was asking for the dispatch of a hundred missionaries, and some oil from the lamp of the Holy Sepulcher. The new Pope could spare only two friars and some lamp oil. The friars turned back soon after the party left for Mongolia. The two Polos (this time accompanied by the young Marco Polo, who was then 17 years old) returned to the Mongol Empire and remitted the oil from the Pope to Kublai in 1275.\nThe Mongol Ilkhanate leader Abaqa sent a delegation with over a dozen members to the 1274 Council of Lyon, where plans were made for possible military cooperation between the Mongols and the Europeans. After the council, Abaqa sent another embassy led by the Georgian Vassali brothers to further notify Western leaders of military preparations. Gregory X answered that his legates would accompany the Crusade, and that they would be in charge of coordinating military operations with the Il-Khan. However, these projects for a major new Crusade essentially came to a halt with the death of Gregory X on 10 January 1276. The money which had been saved to finance the expedition was instead distributed in Italy.\nPope and Council.\nSometime during his reign as pope, Gregory X wrote a letter against the charges of \"blood libel\" and persecution against the Jews. Mindful of the scandals attached to the conclave at Viterbo that had elected him, realizing that tighter controls on the entire process of election were needed, he produced the papal bull \"Ubi periculum\" which was subsequently ratified by the Council of Lyons on 16 July 1274 and incorporated into the Code of Canon Law.\nOn his arrival at Rome in 1272, his first act was to carry forward the wish of Gregory IX and summon a council. Two days after his coronation Gregory X sent a letter to King Edward I of England, inviting him to a general council to be held on the subject of the Holy Land, beginning on 1 May 1274. Pope Gregory X left Orvieto on 5 June 1273, and arrived in Lyons in the middle of November 1273. Not all of the cardinals followed him. Pope Gregory notes in a letter to King Edward dated 29 November 1273 that Cardinal Riccardo Annibaldi and Cardinal Giovanni Orsini were still in Rome and had been ordered to find a secure place of imprisonment for Guy de Montfort. The two cardinals were hereditary enemies and would be an effective check on each other. Neither was present at the opening of the Council of Lyons. Gregory himself had an immediate meeting with King Philip III of France, whom he had been cultivating vigorously since his accession. The meeting was evidently quite harmonious and successful, since Philip ceded to the Papacy the Comtat Venaissin. The Second Ecumenical Council met at Lyons, beginning on 1 May 1274 for the purpose of considering the East-West Schism, the condition of the Holy Land, and the abuses of the Catholic Church.\nCouncil objectives.\nHis main objective as pope was to convene the council, and he had a programme for that council:\nThe Pope's interests were not doctrinal in nature, but disciplinary.\nIn connection with the financing of the Crusade, Pope Gregory imposed on all clerics a six-year long tax of 10% of their income. This was a considerable increase in the tax rate, which, on previous occasions had been for three years, at a rate of 5%. 26 permanent tax districts were established, each having a Collector and a Sub-Collector.\nHis Constitution with respect to conclaves legislated a number of important points:\nDeath and burial.\nGregory's health had worsened after he left Lyons in April 1275. He was suffering from a hernia, and so he was forced to stop frequently on the way back to Rome. He departed Vienne shortly after 30 September 1275 and arrived in Lausanne on 6 October 1275. In Lausanne, he met with the Emperor-elect Rudolf of Habsburg, King of the Romans, and on 20 October 1275, received his oath of fealty. On Tuesday, 12 November 1275, he was in Milan. His party reached Reggio Emilia on 5 December 1275, and they were in Bologna on 11 December 1275. A severe rise in his temperature and the presence of the hernia forced him to a halt at Arezzo in time for Christmas of 1275. His condition rapidly declined following this and led to his death on 10 January 1276. He is buried inside the Cathedral Church of Arezzo.\nHe was succeeded by the Dominican Peter of Tarantaise of Savoy (Pope Innocent V), a close collaborator of the pontiff throughout his pontificate.\nBeatifications and canonizations.\nThroughout his pontificate, Gregory X only canonized one individual. He confirmed the cultus of Franca Visalta in September 1273. She was a Cistercian nun from Piacenza, authoritarian and given to extreme forms of self-mortification. Having been eased out of a Benedictine convent, where she had been placed at the age of seven, she built her own convent, over which she ruled as Abbess.\nHe commenced the cause of canonization of King Louis IX of France in 1272, an act which bestowed on the king who had died in August 1270 the title of Servant of God.\nHe beatified Luchesius Modestini in 1274 with the confirmation of his cultus.\nVestments.\nWriting in \"L'Osservatore Romano\", Agostino Paravicini Bagliani says that the popular belief that Pius V (1566\u201372) was the first Pope to wear the white cassock is inaccurate. Instead, writes Bagliani, the first document that mentions the Pope's white cassock dates from 1274. \"The first pope to be solemnly invested with the red mantle immediately after his election was Gregory VII (1076)\", the scholar added, noting that traditionally \"from the moment of his election the Pope put on vestments of two colors: red (cope, mozzetta, shoes); and white (cassock, socks).\"\nBeatification.\nPope Clement XI beatified Gregory X in 1713. He was made a patron of the Diocese of Arezzo and of Franciscan Tertiaries. His cause of canonization resumed in 1944 under Pope Pius XII and remains open, with the requirement of a miracle attributed to his intercession needed for his canonization.\nPope Gregory X in popular culture.\n\"Teobaldo Visconti\" is a central character in the 1982 American-Italian miniseries \"Marco Polo\", in which he is portrayed by American actor Burt Lancaster. He is also depicted by Irish actor Gabriel Byrne in the 2014-2016 Netflix series \"Marco Polo\".\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In the Jewish and Western Christian traditions, there are 150 psalms, and several more in the Eastern Christian churches. The book is divided into five sections, each ending with a doxology, a hymn of praise. There are several types of psalms, including hymns or songs of praise, communal and individual laments, royal psalms, imprecation, and individual thanksgivings. The book also includes psalms of communal thanksgiving, wisdom, pilgrimage, and other categories.\nMany of the psalms contain attributions to the name of King David and other Biblical figures, including Asaph, the sons of Korah, Moses, and Solomon. Davidic authorship of the Psalms is not accepted as a historical fact by modern scholars, who view it as a way to link biblical writings to well-known figures; while the dating of the Psalms is \"notoriously difficult\", some are considered preexilic and others postexilic. The Dead Sea Scrolls suggest that the ordering and content of the later psalms (Psalms 90\u2013150) was not fixed as of the mid-1st century CE. Septuagint scholars, including Eugene Ulrich, have argued that the Hebrew Psalter was not closed until the 1st century CE.\nThe English-language title of the book derives from the Greek word (), meaning 'instrumental music', and by extension referring to \"the words accompanying the music\". Its Hebrew name, (), means 'praises', as it contains many praises and supplications to God.\nStructure.\nSections.\nThe Book of Psalms is divided into five sections, each closing with a doxology (i.e., a benediction). These divisions were probably introduced by the final editors to imitate the five-fold division of the Torah:\nSuperscriptions.\nMany psalms (116 of the 150) have individual superscriptions (titles), ranging from lengthy comments to a single word. Over a third appear to be musical directions, addressed to the \"leader\" or \"choirmaster\", including such statements as \"with stringed instruments\" and \"according to lilies\". Others appear to be references to types of musical composition, such as \"A psalm\" and \"Song\", or regarding the occasion of the psalm (\"On the dedication of the temple\", \"For the memorial offering\", etc.). Many carry the names of individuals, the most common (73 psalms) being 'of David', and thirteen of these relate explicitly to incidents in the king's life. Others named include Asaph (12), the sons of Korah (11), Solomon (2), Moses (1), Ethan the Ezrahite (1), and Heman the Ezrahite (1). The Septuagint, the Peshitta (the Syriac Vulgate), and the Latin Vulgate each associate several Psalms (such as 111 and 145) with Haggai and Zechariah. The Septuagint also attributes several Psalms (like 112 and 135) to Ezekiel and Jeremiah.\nNumbering.\nPsalms are usually identified by a sequence number, often preceded by the abbreviation \"Ps.\" Numbering of the Psalms differs\u00a0\u2013 mostly by one\u00a0\u2013 between the Hebrew (Masoretic) and Greek (Septuagint) manuscripts. Protestant translations use the Hebrew numbering, but other Christian traditions vary:\nThe variance between Masorah and Septuagint texts in this numeration is likely due to a gradual neglect of the original poetic form of the Psalms; such neglect was occasioned by liturgical uses and carelessness of copyists. It is generally admitted that Psalms 9 and 10 (Hebrew numbering) were originally a single acrostic poem, wrongly separated by Massorah and rightly united by the Septuagint and the Vulgate. Psalms 42 and 43 (Hebrew numbering) are shown by identity of subject (yearning for the house of Yahweh), of metrical structure and of refrain (comparing Psalms 42:6, 12; 43:5, Hebrew numbering), to be three strophes of one and the same poem. The Hebrew text is correct in counting as one Psalm 146 and Psalm 147. Later liturgical usage would seem to have split up these and several other psalms. Zenner combines into what he deems the original choral odes: Psalms 1, 2, 3, 4; 6 + 13; 9 + 10; 19, 20, 21; 56 + 57; 69 + 70; 114 + 115; 148, 149, 150. A choral ode would seem to have been the original form of Psalms 14 and 70. The two strophes and the epode are Psalm 14; the two antistrophes are Psalm 70. It is noteworthy that, on the breaking up of the original ode, each portion crept twice into the Psalter: Psalm 14 = 53, Psalm 70 = 40:14\u201318. Other such duplicated portions of psalms are Psalm 108:2\u20136 = Psalm 57:8\u201312; Psalm 108:7\u201314 = Psalm 60:7\u201314; Psalm 71:1\u20133 = Psalm 31:2\u20134. This loss of the original form of some of the psalms is considered by the Catholic Church's Pontifical Biblical Commission (1 May 1910) to have been due to liturgical practices, neglect by copyists, or other causes.\nVerse numbers were first printed in 1509. Different traditions exist whether to include the original heading into the counting or not. This leads to inconsistent numbering in 62 psalms, with an offset of 1, sometimes even 2 verses.\nAdditional psalms.\nThe Septuagint, present in Eastern Orthodox churches, includes a Psalm 151; a Hebrew version of this was found in the \"Psalms Scroll\" of the Dead Sea Scrolls. Some versions of the Peshitta (the Bible used in Syriac churches mainly in the Middle East) include Psalms 152\u2013155. There are also the Psalms of Solomon, which are a further 18 psalms of Jewish origin, likely originally written in Hebrew, but surviving only in Greek and Syriac translation. These and other indications suggest that the current Western Christian and Jewish collection of 150 psalms was selected from a wider set.\nPrimary types.\nHermann Gunkel's pioneering form-critical work on the psalms sought to provide a new and meaningful context in which to interpret individual psalms\u2014not by looking at their literary context within the Psalter (which he did not see as significant), but by bringing together psalms of the same genre () from throughout the Psalter. Gunkel divided the psalms into five primary types:\nHymns.\nHymns are songs of praise for God's work in creation or history. They typically open with a call to praise, describe the motivation for praise, and conclude with a repetition of the call. Two sub-categories are \"enthronement psalms\" celebrating the enthronement of Yahweh as king, and \"Zion psalms\" glorifying Mount Zion, God's dwelling-place in Jerusalem. Gunkel also described a special subset of \"eschatological hymns\" which includes themes of future restoration (Psalm 126) or of judgment (Psalm 82). \nCommunal laments.\nCommunal laments are psalms in which the nation laments some communal disaster. Both communal and individual laments typically but not always include the following elements:\nIn general, the individual and communal subtypes can be distinguished by the use of the singular \"I\" or the plural \"we\". However, the \"I\" could also be characterising an individual's personal experience that was reflective of the entire community.\nRoyal psalms.\nRoyal psalms deal with such matters as the king's coronation, marriage, and battles. None of them mentions any specific king by name, and their origin and use remain obscure; several psalms, especially Psalms 93\u201399, concern the kingship of God, and might relate to an annual ceremony in which Yahweh would be ritually reinstated as king.\nIndividual laments.\nIndividual laments are psalms lamenting the fate of the psalmist. By far the most common type of psalm, they typically open with an invocation of God, followed by the lament itself and pleas for help, and often ending with an expression of confidence.\nIndividual thanksgiving psalms.\nIn individual thanksgiving psalms, the opposite of individual laments, the psalmist thanks God for deliverance from personal distress.\nIn addition to these five major genres, Gunkel also recognised a number of minor psalm-types, including:\nComposition.\nOrigins.\nThe composition of the psalms spans at least five centuries, from Psalm 29's composition in the 10th century BCE to others clearly from the post-Exilic period (i.e., not earlier than the 5th century BCE). The majority originated in the southern kingdom of Judah and were associated with the Temple in Jerusalem, where they probably functioned as librettos during Temple worship. Exactly how they did so was unclear, but there are indications in some of them: \"Bind the festal procession with branches, up to the horns of the altar\" suggests a connection with sacrifices, and \"Let my prayer be set forth before you as incense\" suggests a connection with the offering of incense.\nAccording to Jewish tradition, the Book of Psalms was composed by the First Man (Adam), Melchizedek, Abraham, Moses, David, Solomon, Heman, Jeduthun, Asaph, and the three sons of Korah. According to Abraham ibn Ezra, the final redaction of the book was made by the Men of the Great Assembly.\nInfluences.\nSome of the psalms show influences from related earlier texts from the region; examples include various Ugaritic texts and the Babylonian En\u016bma Eli\u0161. These influences may be either of background similarity or of contrast. For example, Psalm 29 shares characteristics with Canaanite religious poetry and themes. Robert Alter points out that the address to \"sons of God\" at the opening \"[is] best thought of [as] the flickering literary afterlife of a polytheistic mythology\" but that \"belief in them...is unlikely to have been shared by the scribal circles that produced \"Psalms\"\". The contrast between the Psalmist's theology and the surrounding area's polytheistic religion is well seen in Psalms 104:26, in which locals' mythical fierce sea-god\u2014such as the Babylonian Tiamat, Canaanite Yam and the Leviathan which also appears in the Hebrew Bible\u2014is \"reduced to an aquatic pet with whom YHWH can play\".\nPoetic characteristics.\nThe biblical poetry of Psalms uses parallelism as its primary poetic device. Parallelism is a kind of symmetry in which restatement, synonym, amplification, grammatical repetition, or opposition develops an idea. Synonymous parallelism involves two lines expressing essentially the same idea. An example of synonymous parallelism:\nTwo lines expressing opposites are known as antithetic parallelism. An example of antithetic parallelism:\nTwo clauses expressing the idea of amplifying the first claim are known as expansive parallelism. An example of expansive parallelism:\nEditorial agenda.\nMany scholars believe the individual Psalms were redacted into a single collection during the Second Temple period. It had long been recognized that the collection bore the imprint of an underlying message or metanarrative, but that this message remained concealed, as Augustine of Hippo said, \"The sequence of the Psalms seems to me to contain the secret of a mighty mystery, but its meaning has not been revealed to me\" (\"Enarr.\" on Psalms 150:1). Others pointed out the presence of concatenation\u2014that is, adjacent Psalms sharing similar words and themes. In time, this approach developed into recognizing overarching themes shared by whole groups of psalms.\nIn 1985, Gerald H. Wilson's \"The Editing of the Hebrew Psalter\" proposed\u2014by parallel with other ancient Near Eastern hymn collections\u2014that psalms at the beginning and end (or \"seams\") of the five books of Psalms have thematic significance, corresponding in particular with the placement of the royal psalms. He pointed out that there was a progression of ideas from adversity through the crux of the collection in the apparent failure of the covenant in Psalm 89, leading to a concert of praise at the end. He concluded that the collection was redacted to be a retrospective of the failure of the Davidic covenant, exhorting Israel to trust in God alone in a non-messianic future. Walter Brueggemann suggested that the underlying editorial purpose was oriented instead towards wisdom or sapiential concerns, addressing the issues of how to live the life of faith. Psalm 1 calls the reader to a life of obedience; Psalm 73 (Brueggemann's crux psalm) faces the crisis when divine faithfulness is in doubt; Psalm 150 represents faith's triumph when God is praised not for his rewards but for his being. In 1997, David. C. Mitchell's \"The Message of the Psalter\" took a quite different line. Building on the work of Wilson and others, Mitchell proposed that the Psalter embodies an eschatological timetable like that of Zechariah 9\u201314. This programme includes the ingathering of exiled Israel by a bridegroom-king; his establishment of a kingdom; his violent death; Israel scattered in the wilderness, regathered and again imperiled, and then rescued by a king from the heavens, who establishes his kingdom from Zion, brings peace and prosperity to the earth and receives the homage of the nations.\nThese three views\u2014Wilson's non-messianic retrospective of the Davidic covenant, Brueggemann's sapiential instruction, and Mitchell's eschatological-messianic program\u2014all have their followers. However, the sapiential agenda has been somewhat eclipsed by the other two. Shortly before he died in 2005, Wilson modified his position to allow for the existence of messianic prophecy within the Psalms' redactional agenda. Mitchell's position remains essentially unchanged, but he now sees the issue as identifying when the historical beginning of the Psalms turns to eschatology.\nJames Vander Kam's \"The Dead Sea Scrolls Today\" examined the large Psalms scroll from Qumran, 11QPs(a), showing that while the early 1st century CE largely fixed the first three books (Psalms 1\u201389), Psalms 90\u2013150 show variations in ordering and content, suggesting the collection was still being finalized into the mid-1st century\u00a0CE and included material not found in the later Masoretic Text. Peter Flint argues that the findings show there were three different versions of the Psalter circulating during the Second Temple period, with the Masoretic version being attested among the scrolls found at Masada.\nThe ancient music of the Psalms.\nThe Psalms were written not merely as poems, but as songs to be sung. According to Bible exegete Saadia Gaon (882\u2013942) who served in the geonate of Babylonian Jewry, the Psalms were originally sung in the Temple precincts by the Levites, based on what was prescribed for each psalm (lineage of the singers, designated time and place, instruments used, manner of execution, etc.), but are permitted to be randomly read by anyone at any time and in any place. More than a third of the psalms are addressed to the Director of Music. Some psalms exhort the worshipper to sing (e.g., Pss. 33:1\u20133; 92:1\u20133; 96:1\u20133; 98:1; 101:1; 150). Some headings denote the musical instruments on which the psalm should be played (Pss. 4, 5, 6, 8, 67). Some refer to the Levites who sang one of eight melodies, one of which was known simply as \"the eighth\" (Hebrew: \"sheminit\") (Pss. 6, 12) . And others preserve the name for ancient eastern modes, like \"ayelet ha-shachar\" (hind of the dawn; Ps. 22); \"shoshanim\" / \"shushan\" (\"lilies\" / \"lily\"; Pss. 45; 60), said to be describing a certain melody; or \u02bbalmuth / \"\u02bbalamoth\" (\"mute\"; Pss. 9, 46), which, according to Saadia Gaon, is \"a silent melody, nearly inaudible.\"\nDespite the frequently heard view that their ancient music is lost, the means to reconstruct it are still extant. Fragments of temple psalmody are preserved in ancient synagogue and church chant, particularly in the \"tonus peregrinus\" melody to Psalm 114. Cantillation signs, to record the melody sung, were in use since ancient times; evidence of them can be found in the manuscripts of the oldest extant copies of Psalms in the Dead Sea Scrolls and are even more extensive in the Masoretic Text, which dates to the Early Middle Ages and whose Tiberian scribes claimed to be basing their work on temple-period signs. (See Moshe ben Asher's 'Song of the Vine' colophon to the Codex Cairensis).\nSeveral attempts have been made to decode the Masoretic cantillation, but the most \"successful\" is that of Suzanne Ha\u00efk-Vantoura (1928\u20132000) in the last quarter of the 20th century. Her reconstruction assumes the signs represent the degrees of various musical scales\u2014that is, individual notes\u2014which puts it at odds with all other existing traditions, where the signs invariably represent melodic motifs; it also takes no account of the existence of older systems of notation, such as the Babylonian and Palestinian systems. Musicologists have therefore rejected Ha\u00efk-Vantoura's theories, with her results dubios, and her methodology flawed. In spite of this, Mitchell has repeatedly defended it, showing that, when applied to the Masoretic cantillation of Psalm 114, it produces a melody recognizable as the \"tonus peregrinus\" of church and synagogue. Mitchell includes musical transcriptions of the temple psalmody of Psalms 120\u2013134 in his commentary on the Songs of Ascents.\nViews on the division into five books.\nIn \"The Flow of the Psalms\", O. Palmer Robertson posits a thematic progression throughout the five books of Psalms, delineating distinctive characteristics and emphases:\nBook 1: Opposition \u2013 Predominantly attributed to David, these Psalms are perceived as the earliest in origin, characterized by a focus on trust in God, with Yahweh as the dominant name.\nBook 2: Communication \u2013 Despite continued opposition, this book reflects an outreach even to enemies of God. The prevalent name for God shifts to Elohim, especially when borrowing sections from Book 1. Robertson suggests Book 2 may have Northern Kingdom origins.\nBook 3: Devastation \u2013 Marked by the overtaking of Jerusalem, this book holds out hope for Jacob and Joseph, possibly symbolizing the Southern and Northern kingdoms. Expressions like \"trust in God\" diminish.\nBook 4: Maturity \u2013 Notably, with over 10 quotes from Chronicles, indicating a temporal progression beyond the initial three books.\nBook 5: Consummation \u2013 Robertson proposes that the Psalms of Ascent and Hallel Psalms are post-Babylonian exile compositions, portraying a culmination of themes and perspectives\nThemes and execution.\nMost individual psalms involve the praise of God for his power and beneficence, for his creation of the world, and for his past acts of deliverance for Israel. They envision a world in which everyone and everything will praise God, and God in turn will hear their prayers and respond. Sometimes God \"hides his face\" and refuses to respond, questioning (for the psalmist) the relationship between God and prayer which is the underlying assumption of the Book of Psalms.\nSome psalms are called \"maskil\" (or \"maschil\"), meaning 'enlightened' or 'wise saying', because they impart wisdom. Most notable of these is Psalm 142 which is sometimes called the \"Maskil of David\"; others include Psalm 32 and Psalm 78.\nA special grouping and division in the Book of Psalms are fifteen psalms (Psalms 120\u2013134) known in the construct case, (\"A Song of Ascents\", \"A Song of degrees\"), and one as (Psalm 121). According to Saadia Gaon, these songs differed from the other psalms in that they were to be sung by the Levites in a \"loud melody\" (). Every psalm designated for Asaph (e.g. Psalms 50, 73\u201383) was sung by his descendants while making use of cymbals, in accordance with 1 Chronicles 16:5. Every psalm wherein is found the introductory phrase \"Upon Mahalath\" (e.g. Psalms 53 and 88) was sung by the Levites by using large percussion instruments having wide and closed bezels on both sides and beaten with two wooden sticks.\nO. Palmer Robertson observes that many of the Psalms concern the subject of death and says \"This unnatural conclusion to every human life can be understood only in the context of the original threat to the original man: 'in the day you shall eat of it you shall surely die.'\" Robertson goes on to say \"The anticipation from redemption from the grave overcomes the inevitability of death. The psalmist is fully aware of his need for total deliverance from the last great enemy, and attests to expectation of deliverance.\"\nLater interpretation and influence.\nOverview.\nIndividual psalms were originally hymns, to be used on various occasions and at various sacred sites; later, some were anthologised, and might have been understood within the various anthologies (e.g., Psalm 123 as one of the Psalms of Ascent). Finally, individual psalms might be understood within the Psalter as a whole, either narrating the life of David or providing instruction like the Torah. In later Jewish and Christian tradition, the Psalms have come to be used as prayers, either individual or communal, as traditional expressions of religious feeling.\nCommentaries.\nMany authors have commented on the Psalms, including:\nUse in Jewish ritual.\nSome of the titles given to the Psalms have descriptions which suggest their use in worship:\nPsalms are used throughout traditional Jewish worship. Many complete Psalms and verses from Psalms appear in \"Shacharit\". The \"pesukei dezimra\" component incorporates Psalms 30, 100, and 145\u2013150. Psalm 145 (commonly referred to as \"Ashrei\", which is really the first word of two verses appended to the beginning of the Psalm), is read three times every day: once in \"shacharit\" as part of \"pesukei dezimrah\", as mentioned; once, along with Psalm 20, as part of the morning's concluding prayers; and once at the start of the afternoon service. On festival days and \"Shabbatot\", instead of concluding the morning service, it precedes the Mussaf service. Psalms 95\u201399, 29, 92, and 93, along with some later readings, comprise the introduction (\"Kabbalat Shabbat\") to the Friday night service. Traditionally, a different \"Psalm for the Day\"\u2014\"Shir shel yom\"\u2014is read after \"Shacharit\" each day of the week (starting Sunday, Psalms: 24, 48, 82, 94, 81, 93, 92). This is described in the Mishnah (the initial codification of the Jewish oral tradition) in the tractate \"Tamid\". According to the Talmud, the Levites originally recited these daily Psalms in the Temple in Jerusalem on that day of the week. From Rosh Chodesh Elul until Hoshanah Rabbah, Psalm 27 is recited twice daily following the morning and evening services. There is a \"Minhag\" (custom) to recite Psalm 30 each morning of Chanukkah after Shacharit: some recite this in place of the regular \"Psalm for the Day\", others recite this additionally.\nWhen a Jew dies, a watch is kept over the body and \"tehillim\" (Psalms) are recited constantly by sun or candlelight, until the burial service. Historically, this watch would be carried out by the immediate family, usually in shifts, but in contemporary practice this service is provided by an employee of the funeral home or \"chevra kadisha\".\nMany Jews complete the Book of Psalms on a weekly or monthly basis. Each week, some also say a Psalm connected to that week's events or the Torah portion read during that week. In addition, many Jews (notably Lubavitch, and other Chasidim) read the entire Book of Psalms prior to the morning service, on the Sabbath preceding the calculated appearance of the new moon.\nThe reading of psalms is viewed in Jewish tradition as a vehicle for gaining God's favor. They are thus often specially recited in times of trouble, such as poverty, disease, or physical danger; in many synagogues, Psalms are recited after services for the security of the State of Israel. Sefer ha-Chinuch states that this practice is designed not to achieve favor, as such, but rather to inculcate belief in Divine Providence into one's consciousness, consistently with Maimonides' general view on Providence. (Relatedly, the Hebrew verb for prayer, \"hitpalal\" \u05d4\u05ea\u05e4\u05dc\u05dc, is in fact the reflexive form of \"palal\" \u05e4\u05dc\u05dc, to intervene, petition, judge. Thus, \"to pray\" conveys the connotation of \"judging oneself\": ultimately, the purpose of prayer\u2014\"tefilah\" \u05ea\u05e4\u05dc\u05d4\u2014is to transform ourselves.)\nIn Christian prayer and worship.\nNew Testament references show that the earliest Christians used the Psalms in worship, and the Psalms have remained an important part of worship in most Christian Churches. The Eastern Orthodox, Catholic, Presbyterian, Lutheran and Anglican Churches have always made systematic use of the Psalms, with a cycle for the recitation of all or most of them over the course of one or more weeks. In the early centuries of the Church, it was expected that any candidate for bishop would be able to recite the entire Psalter from memory, something they often learned automatically during their time as monks. Christians have used Pater Noster cords of 150 beads to pray the entire Psalter.\nPaul the Apostle quotes psalms (specifically Psalms 14 and 53, which are nearly identical) as the basis for his theory of original sin, and includes the scripture in the Epistle to the Romans, chapter 3.\nSeveral conservative Protestant denominations sing only the Psalms (some churches also sing the small number of hymns found elsewhere in the Bible) in worship and do not accept the use of non-Biblical hymns; examples are the Reformed Presbyterian Church of North America, the Presbyterian Reformed Church (North America), and the Free Church of Scotland (Continuing).\nNew translations and settings of the Psalms continue to be produced. An individually printed volume of Psalms for use in Christian religious rituals is called a Psalter.\nImam-ud-Din Shahbaz (1845\u20131921), a Punjabi evangelist and a poet, produced the first metrical translation of the Psalms in Punjabi, known as Punjabi Zabur. For a hundred years, the Punjabi Zabur has been used as an essential part of singing and praising in the majority of Urdu and Punjabi Churches around the globe.\nFurthermore, psalms often serve as the inspiration for much of modern or contemporary Christian worship music in a variety of styles. Some songs are entirely based on a particular psalm or psalms, and many quote directly from the Book of Psalms (and other parts of the Bible).\nEastern Orthodox Christianity.\nOrthodox Christians and Greek-Catholics (Eastern Catholics who follow the Byzantine rite) have long made the Psalms an integral part of their corporate and private prayers. The official version of the Psalter used by the Orthodox Church is the Septuagint. To facilitate its reading, the 150 Psalms are divided into 20 \"kathismata\" (Greek: \u03ba\u03b1\u03b8\u03af\u03c3\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1; Slavonic: \u043a\u0430\u0444\u0438\u0437\u043c\u044b, ; lit. \"sittings\") and each \"kathisma\" (Greek: \u03ba\u03ac\u03b8\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u03b1; Slavonic: \u043a\u0430\u0473\u0438\u0441\u043c\u0430, ) is further subdivided into three \"stases\" (Greek: \u03c3\u03c4\u03ac\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2, lit. \"standings\", sing. \u03c3\u03c4\u03ac\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2, \"stasis\"), so-called because the faithful stand at the end of each \"stasis\" for the Glory to the Father\u00a0...\nAt Vespers and Matins, different \"kathismata\" are read at different times of the liturgical year and on different days of the week, according to the Church's calendar, so that all 150 psalms (20 \"kathismata\") are read in the course of a week. During Great Lent, the number of \"kathismata\" is increased so that the entire Psalter is read twice a week. In the twentieth century, some lay Christians have adopted a continuous reading of the Psalms on weekdays, praying the whole book in four weeks.\nAside from \"kathisma\" readings, Psalms occupy a prominent place in every other Orthodox service, including the services of the Hours and the Divine Liturgy. In particular, the penitential Psalm 50 is widely used. Fragments of Psalms and individual verses are used as \"Prokimena\" (introductions to Scriptural readings) and \"Stichera\". The bulk of Vespers would still be composed of Psalms even if the kathisma were to be disregarded; Psalm 118, \"The Psalm of the Law\", is the centerpiece of Matins on Saturdays, some Sundays, and the Funeral service. The entire book of Psalms is traditionally read aloud or chanted at the side of the deceased during the time leading up to the funeral, mirroring Jewish tradition.\nOriental Christianity.\nSeveral branches of Oriental Orthodox and those Eastern Catholics who follow one of the Oriental Rites will chant the entire Psalter during the course of a day during the Daily Office. This practice continues to be a requirement of monastics in the Oriental churches.\nCatholic usage.\nThe Psalms have always been important in Catholic liturgy. The Liturgy of the Hours is centered on chanting or recitation of the Psalms, using fixed melodic formulas known as psalm tones. Early Catholics employed the Psalms widely in their individual prayers; however, as knowledge of Latin (the language of the Roman Rite) became uncommon, this practice ceased among the unlearned. However, until the end of the Middle Ages, it was not unknown for the laity to join in the singing of the Little Office of Our Lady, which was a shortened version of the Liturgy of the Hours providing a fixed daily cycle of twenty-five psalms to be recited, and nine other psalms divided across Matins.\nThe work of Bishop Richard Challoner in providing devotional materials in English meant that many of the psalms were familiar to English-speaking Catholics from the eighteenth century onwards. Challoner translated the entirety of the Little Office into English, Sunday Vespers, and daily Compline. He also provided other individual Psalms, such as 129/130, for prayer in his devotional books. Bishop Challoner is also noted for revising the Douay\u2013Rheims Bible, and the translations he used in his devotional books are taken from this work.\nUntil the Second Vatican Council, the Psalms were either recited on a one-week or, less commonly (as in the case of Ambrosian rite), two-week cycle. Different one-week schemata were employed: most secular clergy followed the Roman distribution, while regular clergy almost universally followed that of St Benedict, with only a few congregations (such as the Benedictines of St Maur) following individual arrangements. The Breviary introduced in 1974 distributed the psalms over a four-week cycle. Monastic usage varies widely. Some use the four-week cycle of the secular clergy, many retain a one-week cycle, either following St Benedict's scheme or another of their own devising, while others opt for some other arrangement.\nOfficial approval was also given to other arrangements by which the complete Psalter is recited in a one-week or two-week cycle. These arrangements are used principally by Catholic contemplative religious orders, such as that of the Trappists.\nThe \"General Instruction of the Liturgy of the Hours\" 122 sanctions three modes of singing/recitation for the Psalms:\nOf these three, the antiphonal mode is the most widely followed.\nOver the centuries, the use of complete Psalms in the liturgy declined. After the Second Vatican Council (which also permitted the use of vernacular languages in the liturgy), longer psalm texts were reintroduced into the Mass during the readings. The revision of the Roman Missal after the Second Vatican Council reintroduced the singing or recitation of a more substantial section of a Psalm, in some cases an entire Psalm, after the first Reading from Scripture. This Psalm, called the \"Responsorial Psalm,\" is usually sung or recited responsorially, although the \"General Instruction of the Roman Missal\" 61 permits direct recitation.\nLutheran usage.\nIn the Mass of the Lutheran Churches, the Psalms are sung according to the lectionary. It typically follows the lection from the Old Testament in the Order of Mass.\nThe Divine Office is centered on chanting or recitation of the Psalms, using fixed melodic formulas known as psalm tones. These are prayed in Lutheran monasteries and convents, as well as by secular Lutheran priests and deacons, in addition to a number of Lutheran laypersons.\nMartin Luther's \"Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott\" (\"A Mighty Fortress Is Our God\") is based on Psalm 46.\nReformed usage.\nFollowing the Protestant Reformation, many of the Psalms were set as hymns. These vernacular translations of the psalms were arranged into rhyming strict-metre verses, known as metrical psalms and used for congregational singing. The metrical psalms were particularly popular in the Calvinist tradition, where in the past they were often sung to the exclusion of other hymns (exclusive psalmody). John Calvin himself made some French translations of the Psalms for church usage, but the completed Genevan Psalter eventually used in church services consisted exclusively of translations by Cl\u00e9ment Marot and Th\u00e9odore de B\u00e8ze, on melodies by a number of composers, including Louis Bourgeois and a certain Maistre Pierre. Among famous hymn settings of the Psalter were the Scottish Psalter and the paraphrases by Isaac Watts. The first book printed in North America was a collection of Psalm settings, the \"Bay Psalm Book\" (1640).\nMetrical psalms are still widely sung in many Reformed congregations. Additionally, the Psalms are popular for private devotion among the Reformed. \nThere exists in some circles a custom of reading one Psalm and one chapter of Proverbs a day, corresponding to the day of the month.\nAnglican usage.\nAnglican chant is a method of singing prose versions of the Psalms.\nIn the early 17th century, when the King James Bible was introduced, the metrical arrangements by Thomas Sternhold and John Hopkins were also popular and were provided with printed tunes. This version and the \"New Version of the Psalms of David\" by Tate and Brady produced in the late seventeenth century (see article on Metrical psalter) remained the normal congregational way of singing psalms in the Church of England until well into the nineteenth century.\nIn Great Britain, the 16th-century Coverdale psalter still forms the heart of daily worship in Cathedral and many parish churches. The new Common Worship service book has a companion psalter in modern English.\nThe version of the psalter in the American Book of Common Prayer prior to the 1979 edition is the Coverdale psalter. The Psalter in the American Book of Common Prayer of 1979 is a new translation, with some attempt to keep the rhythms of the Coverdale Psalter.\nIslam.\nAccording to the Islamic holy book, the Qur'an, God has sent many messengers to humanity. Five universally acknowledged messengers (\"rasul\") are Abraham, Moses, David, Jesus and Muhammad, each believed to have been sent with a scripture. Muslims believe David (\"D\u0101w\u016bd\") received Psalms (\"Zabur\") (cf. ); Jesus (\"\u012as\u0101\") the Gospel (\"Injeel\"); Muhammad received the Qur'an; and Abraham (\"Ibrahim\") the Scrolls of Abraham; meanwhile, the \"Tawrat\" is the Arabic name for the Torah within its context as an Islamic holy book believed by Muslims to have been given by God to the prophets and messengers amongst the Children of Israel, and often refers to the entire Hebrew Bible. God is considered to have authored the Psalms.\nUse in the Rastafari movement.\nThe Psalms are one of the most popular parts of the Bible among followers of the Rastafari movement. Rasta singer Prince Far I released an atmospheric spoken version of the psalms, \"Psalms for I\", set to a roots reggae backdrop from The Aggrovators.\nPsalms set to music.\nMultiple psalms as a single composition.\nPsalms have often been set as part of a larger work. The psalms feature large in settings of Vespers, including those by Claudio Monteverdi, Antonio Vivaldi, Marc-Antoine Charpentier (84 settings H.149 \u2013 H.232) and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, who wrote such settings as part of their responsibilities as church musicians. Psalms are inserted in Requiem compositions, such as Psalm 126 in \"A German Requiem\" of Johannes Brahms and Psalms 130 and 23 in John Rutter's \"Requiem\".\nIndividual psalm settings.\nThere are many settings of individual psalms. One of the better known examples is Gregorio Allegri's \"Miserere mei\", a \"falsobordone\" setting of Psalm 51 (\"Have mercy upon me, O God\"). Settings of individual psalms by later composers are also frequent: they include works from composers such as George Frideric Handel, Felix Mendelssohn, Franz Liszt, Johannes Brahms and Ralph Vaughan Williams. Psalms also feature in more modern musical movements and popular genres.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The immigrant group settled in Canaan around 1175 BC, during the Late Bronze Age collapse. Over time, they intermixed with the indigenous Canaanite societies and assimilated elements from them, while preserving their own unique culture.\nIn 604 BC, the Philistines, who had been under the rule of the Neo-Assyrian Empire (911\u2013605 BC), were ultimately vanquished by King Nebuchadnezzar II of the Neo-Babylonian Empire. Much like the kingdoms of Israel and Judah, the Philistines lost their autonomy by the end of the Iron Age, becoming vassals to the Assyrians, Egyptians, and later Babylonians. Historical sources suggest that Nebuchadnezzar II destroyed Ashkelon and Ekron due to the Philistines' rebellion, leading to the exile of many Philistines, who gradually lost their distinct identity in Babylonia. By the late fifth century BC, the Philistines no longer appear as a distinct group in historical or archaeological records, though the extent of their assimilation remains subject to debate.\nThe Philistines are known for their biblical conflict with the peoples of the region, in particular, the Israelites. Though the primary source of information about the Philistines is the Hebrew Bible, they are first attested to in reliefs at the Temple of Ramesses III at Medinet Habu, in which they are called the (), accepted as cognate with Hebrew ; the parallel Assyrian term is , , or (, , and ). They also left behind a distinctive material culture.\nName.\nThe English term \"Philistine\" comes from Old French ; from Classical Latin ; from Late Greek ; from Koine Greek \u03a6\u03c5\u03bb\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03b5\u03af\u03bc (), ultimately from Hebrew (; plural , ), meaning 'people of ' (). The name also had cognates in Akkadian and Egyptian . The native Philistine endonym is unknown.\nHistory.\nDuring the Late Bronze Age collapse, an apparent confederation of seafarers known as the Sea Peoples are recorded as attacking ancient Egypt and other Eastern Mediterranean civilizations. While their exact origins are a mystery, and probably diverse, it is generally agreed that the Sea Peoples had origins in the greater Southern European and West Asian area, including western Asia Minor, the Aegean, and the islands of the East Mediterranean. Egypt, in particular, repelled numerous attempted invasions from the Sea Peoples, most famously at the Battle of the Delta (c.\u20091175BC), where pharaoh Ramesses III defeated a massive invasion force which had already plundered Hattusa, Carchemish, Cyprus, and the Southern Levant. Egyptian sources name one of these implicated Sea Peoples as the \"pwr\ua723s\ua723tj\", generally transliterated as either \"Peleset\" or \"Pulasti\". Following the Sea Peoples' defeat, Ramesses III allegedly relocated a number of the \"pwr\ua723s\ua723tj\" to southern Canaan, as recorded in an inscription from his funerary temple in Medinet Habu, and the Great Harris Papyrus. Though archaeological investigation has been unable to correlate any such settlement existing during this time period, this, coupled with the name \"Peleset/Pulasti\" and the peoples' supposed Aegean origins, has led many scholars to identify the \"pwr\ua723s\ua723tj\" with the Philistines.\nTypically \"Philistine\" artifacts begin appearing in Canaan by the 12th century BC. Pottery of Philistine origin has been found far outside of what would later become the core of Philistia, including at the majority of Iron Age I sites in the Jezreel Valley; however, because the quantity of said pottery finds are light, it is assumed that the Philistines' presence in these areas were not as strong as in their core territory, and that they probably were a minority which had assimilated into the native Canaanite population by the 10th century BC.\nThere is little evidence that the Sea Peoples forcefully injected themselves into the southern Levant; and the cities which would become the core of Philistine territory, such as Ashdod, Ashkelon, Gath, and Ekron, show nearly no signs of an intervening event marked by destruction. The same can be said for Aphek where an Egyptian garrison was destroyed, likely in an act of warfare at the end of the 13th century, which was followed by a local Canaanite phase, which was then followed by the peaceful introduction of Philistine pottery. The lack of destruction by the Sea Peoples in the southern Levant should not be surprising as Canaan was never mentioned in any text describing the Sea Peoples as a target of destruction or attack by the Sea Peoples. Other sites such as Tell Keisan, Acco, Tell Abu Hawam, Tel Dor, Tel Mevorak, Tel Zeror, Tel Michal, Tel Gerisa, and Tel Batash, have no evidence of a destruction ca. 1200 BC.\nBy Iron Age II, the Philistines had formed an ethnic state centered around a pentapolis consisting of Gaza, Ashdod, Ashkelon, Ekron and Gath. Whether or not historians are inclined to accept the historicity of the old canonical books of the Hebrew nation, their writers describe a series of conflicts between the Philistines and the Israelites during the period of the Judges, and, allegedly, the Philistines exercised lordship over Israel in the days of Saul and Samuel the prophet, forbidding the Israelites from making iron implements of war. According to their chronicles, the Philistines were eventually subjugated by David, before regaining independence in the wake of the United Monarchy's dissolution, after which there are only sparse references to them. The accuracy of these narratives is a subject of debate among scholars.\nThe Philistines seemed to have generally retained their autonomy, up until the mid-8th century BC, when Tiglath-Pileser III, the king of the Neo-Assyrian Empire, marched into the region, conquering much of the Levant that was not already under Assyrian rule (including Aram-Damascus and Phoenicia), and occupying the remaining kingdoms in the area (including Philistia). Decades later, Egypt began agitating its neighbours to rebel against Assyrian rule. A revolt in Israel was crushed by Sargon II in 722 BC, resulting in the kingdom's total destruction. In 712 BC, a Philistine named Iamani ascended to the throne of Ashdod, and organized another failed uprising against Assyria with Egyptian aid. The Assyrian King Sargon II invaded Philistia, which effectively became annexed by Assyria, although the kings of the five cities, including Iamani, were allowed to remain on their thrones as vassals. In his annals concerning the campaign, Sargon II singled out his capture of Gath, in 711 BC. Ten years later, Egypt once again incited its neighbors to rebel against Assyria, resulting in Ashkelon, Ekron, Judah, and Sidon revolting against Sargon's son and successor, Sennacherib. Sennacherib crushed the revolt, defeated the Egyptians, and destroyed much of the cities in southern Aramea, Phoenicia, Philistia, and Judah, and entered the northern Sinai, though he was unable to capture the Judahite capital, Jerusalem, instead forcing it to pay tribute. As punishment, the rebel nations paid tribute to Assyria, and Sennacherib's annals report that he exacted such tribute from the kings of Ashdod, Ashkelon, Gaza, and Ekron, but Gath is never mentioned, which may indicate that the city was actually destroyed by Sargon II.\nThe Philistines were later occupied by the Egyptians in 609BC, under Necho II. In 604/603BC, following a Philistine revolt, Nebuchadnezzar II, the king of Babylon, took over and destroyed Askhelon, Gaza, Aphek, and Ekron, which is proven by archaeological evidence and contemporary sources. Some Philistine kings requested help from the Egyptians but they were ultimately ignored. Following the destruction of the Philistine cities, their inhabitants were either killed or exiled to Mesopotamia. Those exiled continued identifying themselves as the \"men of Gaza\" or Ashkelon for roughly 150 years, until they finally lost their distinct ethnic identity.\nBabylonian ration lists dating back to the early 6th century BC, which mention the offspring of Aga, the ultimate ruler of Ashkelon, provide clues to the eventual fate of the Philistines. This evidence is further illuminated by documents from the latter half of the 5th century BC found in the Murasu Archive at Nippur. These records, which link individuals to cities like Gaza and Ashkelon, highlight a continued sense of ethnic identity among the Philistines who were exiled in Babylonia. These instances represent the last known mentions of the Philistines, marking the end of their presence in historical accounts.\nDuring the Persian period, the region of Philistia saw resettlement, with its inhabitants being identified as Phoenicians, although evidence for continuity from earlier, Iron Age traditions in the region is scarce. The citizens of Ashdod were reported to keep their language but it might have been an Aramaic dialect.\nBiblical accounts.\nOrigins.\nIn the Book of Genesis, 10:13\u201314 states, with regard to descendants of Mizraim, in the Table of Nations: \"Mizraim begot the Ludim, the Anamim, the Lehabim, the Naphtuhim, the Pathrusim, the Casluhim, and the Caphtorim, whence the Philistines came forth.\" There is debate among interpreters as to whether Genesis 10:13\u201314 was intended to signify that the Philistines were the offspring of the Caphtorim or Casluhim. Some interpreters, such as Friedrich Schwally, Bernhard Stade, and Cornelis Tiele have argued for a third, Semitic origin.\nAccording to rabbinic sources, the name Philistines designated two separate groups; those said to descend from the Casluhim were different from those described in the Deuteronomistic history. Deuteronomist sources describe the \"Five Lords of the Philistines\" as based in five city-states of the southwestern Levant: Gaza, Ashkelon, Ashdod, Ekron, and Gath, from Wadi Gaza in the south to the Yarqon River in the north. This description portrays them at one period of time as among the Kingdom of Israel's most dangerous enemies. In the Septuagint, the term (), which means simply \"other nations\", is used instead of \"Philistines\".\nTheologian Matthew Poole suggests that Casluhim and Caphtorim were brother tribes who lived in the same territory. However, the Capthorim enslaved the Cashluhim and their Philistine descendants, forcing the latter to flee to Canaan, according to Amos 9:7.\nTorah (Pentateuch).\nThe Torah does not record the Philistines as one of the nations to be displaced from Canaan. In Genesis 15:18\u201321, the Philistines are absent from the ten nations Abraham's descendants will displace as well as being absent from the list of nations Moses tells the people they will conquer, though the land in which they resided is included in the boundaries based on the locations of rivers described. In fact, the Philistines, through their Capthorite ancestors, were allowed to conquer the land from the Avvites. However, their de-facto control over Canaan appears to have been limited. states that only five cities, Gaza, Ashdod, Ashkelon, Gath and Ekron, were controlled by Philistine lords. Three of these cities were later overtaken by the Anakim, making them a target for Israelite conquests as seen in and .\nGod also directed the Israelites away from the Philistines upon their Exodus from Egypt, according to Exodus 13:17. In Genesis 21:22\u201327, Abraham agrees to a covenant of kindness with Abimelech, the Philistine king, and his descendants. Abraham's son Isaac deals with the Philistine king similarly, by concluding a treaty with them in chapter 26.\nUnlike most other ethnic groups in the Bible, the Philistines are almost always referred to without the definite article in the Torah.\nDeuteronomistic history.\nRabbinic sources state that the Philistines of Genesis were different people from the Philistines of the Deuteronomistic history (the series of books from Joshua to 2 Kings).\nAccording to the Talmud, Chullin 60b, the Philistines of Genesis intermingled with the Avvites. This differentiation was also held by the authors of the Septuagint (LXX), who translated (rather than transliterated) its base text as \"foreigners\" () instead of \"Philistines\" throughout the Books of Judges and Samuel. Based on the LXX's regular translation as \"foreigners\", Robert Drews states that the term \"Philistines\" means simply \"non-Israelites of the Promised Land\" when used in the context of Samson, Saul and David.\nJudges 13:1 tells that the Philistines dominated the Israelites in the times of Samson, who fought and killed over a thousand. According to 1 Samuel 5, they even captured the Ark of the Covenant and held it for several months; in 1 Samuel 6, the return of the Ark to the Israelites of Beth Shemesh is described.\nA number of biblical texts, like the stories reflecting Philistine expansion and the importance of Gath, seem to portray Late Iron Age I and Early Iron Age II memories. They are mentioned more than 250 times, the majority in the Deuteronomistic history, and are depicted as among the arch-enemies of the Israelites, a serious and recurring threat before being subdued by David. Not all relations were negative, with the Cherethites and Pelethites, who were of Philistine origin, serving as David's bodyguards and soldiers.\nThe Aramean, Assyrian and Babylonian threat eventually took over, with the Philistines themselves falling victim to these groups. They were conquered by the Neo-Babylonian Empire and the Achaemenid Empire, and disappeared as a distinct ethnic group by the late 5th century BC.\nThe Prophets.\nAmos in 1:8 sets the Philistines / \u1f00\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03c6\u03cd\u03bb\u03bf\u03b9 at Ashdod and Ekron. In 9:7 God is quoted asserting that, as he brought Israel from Egypt, he also brought the Philistines from Caphtor. In the Greek this is, instead, bringing the \u1f00\u03bb\u03bb\u03cc\u03c6\u03c5\u03bb\u03bf\u03b9 from Cappadocia.\nThe Bible books of Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Amos and Zephaniah speak of the destruction of the Philistines. Jeremiah 47:4 describes the Philistines as the remnant of the Caphtorim because the latter were mysteriously destroyed, either by divine or man-made means.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;Battles between the Israelites and the Philistines.\nThe following is a list of battles described in the Bible as having occurred between the Israelites and the Philistines:\nOrigin.\nSeveral theories are given about the origins of the Philistines. The Hebrew Bible mentions in two places that they originate from a geographical region known as Caphtor (possibly Crete/Minoa), although the Hebrew chronicles also state that the Philistines were descended from Casluhim, one of the 7 sons of Ham's second son, Mi\u1e63rayim. The Septuagint connects the Philistines to other biblical groups such as Caphtorim and the Cherethites and Pelethites, which have been identified with the island of Crete. These traditions, among other things, have led to the modern theory of Philistines having an Aegean origin.\nScholarly consensus.\nMost scholars agree that the Philistines were of Greek origin, and that they came from Crete and the rest of the Aegean Islands or, more generally, from the area of modern-day Greece. This view is based largely upon the fact that archaeologists, when digging up strata dated to the Philistine time-period in the coastal plains and in adjacent areas, have found similarities in material culture (figurines, pottery, fire-stands, etc.) between Aegean-Greek culture and that of Philistine culture, suggesting common origins. A minority, dissenting, claims that the similarities in material culture are only the result of acculturation, during their entire 575 years of existence among Canaanite (Phoenician), Israelite, and perhaps other seafaring peoples.\nThe \"Peleset\" from Egyptian inscriptions.\nSince 1846, scholars have connected the biblical Philistines with the Egyptian \"\" inscriptions. All five of these appear from c.1150\u00a0BC to c.900\u00a0BC just as archaeological references to \"Kina\u1e2b\u1e2bu\", or \"Ka-na-na\" (Canaan), come to an end; and since 1873 comparisons were drawn between them and to the Aegean \"Pelasgians.\" Archaeological research to date has been unable to corroborate a mass settlement of Philistines during the Ramesses III era.\n\"Walistina/Falistina\" and \"Palistin\" in Syria.\nPro.\nA \"Walistina\" is mentioned in Luwian texts already variantly spelled \"Palistina\". This implies dialectical variation, a phoneme (\"f\"?) inadequately described in the script, or both. Falistina was a kingdom somewhere on the Amuq plain, where the Amurru kingdom had held sway before it.\nIn 2003, a statue of a king named Taita bearing inscriptions in Luwian was discovered during excavations conducted by German archaeologist Kay Kohlmeyer in the Citadel of Aleppo. The new readings of Anatolian hieroglyphs proposed by the Hittitologists Elisabeth Rieken and Ilya Yakubovich were conducive to the conclusion that the country ruled by Taita was called Palistin. This country extended in the 11th-10th centuries BC from the Amouq Valley in the west to Aleppo in the east down to Mehardeh and Shaizar in the south.\nDue to the similarity between Palistin and Philistines, Hittitologist John David Hawkins (who translated the Aleppo inscriptions) hypothesizes a connection between the Syro-Hittite Palistin and the Philistines, as do archaeologists Benjamin Sass and Kay Kohlmeyer. Gershon Galil suggests that King David halted the Arameans' expansion into the Land of Israel on account of his alliance with the southern Philistine kings, as well as with Toi, king of \u1e24amath, who is identified with Tai(ta) II, king of Palistin (the northern Sea Peoples).\nContra.\nHowever, the relation between Palistin and the Philistines is much debated. Israeli professor Itamar Singer notes that there is nothing (besides the name) in the recently discovered archaeology that indicates an Aegean origin to Palistin; most of the discoveries at the Palistin capital Tell Tayinat indicate a Neo-Hittite state, including the names of the kings of Palistin. Singer proposes (based on archaeological finds) that a branch of the Philistines settled in Tell Tayinat and were replaced or assimilated by a new Luwian population who took the Palistin name.\n\"phyle histia\" theory.\nAllen Jones (1972 &amp; 1975) suggests that the name \"Philistine\" represents a corruption of the Greek \"phyle-histia\" ('tribe of the hearth'), with the Ionic spelling of \"hestia\". Stephanos Vogazianos (1993) states that Jones \"only answers problems by analogy and he mainly speculates\" but notes that the root \"phyle\" may not at all be out of place. Regarding this theory, Israel Finkelstein &amp; Nadav Na'aman (1994) note the hearth constructions which have been discovered at Tell Qasile and Ekron.\nGenetic evidence.\nA study carried out on skeletons at Ashkelon in 2019 by an interdisciplinary team of scholars from the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History and the Leon Levy Expedition found that human remains at Ashkelon, associated with Philistines during the Iron Age, derived most of their ancestry from the local Levantine gene pool, but with a certain amount of Southern-European-related admixture. This confirms previous historic and archaeological records of a Southern-European migration event. The DNA suggests an influx of people with European heritage into Ashkelon in the 12th century BC. The individuals' DNA shows similarities to that of ancient Cretans, but it is impossible to specify the exact place in Europe from where Philistines had migrated to Levant, due to limited number of ancient genomes available for study, \"with 20 to 60 per cent similarity to DNA from ancient skeletons from Crete and Iberia and that from modern people living in Sardinia.\"\nAfter two centuries since their arrival, the Southern-European genetic markers were dwarfed by the local Levantine gene pool, suggesting intensive intermarriage, but the Philistine culture and peoplehood remained distinct from other local communities for six centuries.\nThe finding fits with an understanding of the Philistines as an \"entangled\" or \"transcultural\" group consisting of peoples of various origins, said Aren Maeir, an archaeologist at Bar-Ilan University in Israel. \"While I fully agree that there was a significant component of non-Levantine origins among the Philistines in the early Iron Age,\" he said, \"these foreign components were not of one origin, and, no less important, they mixed with local Levantine populations from the early Iron Age onward.\" Laura Mazow, an archaeologist at East Carolina University in Greenville, N.C., said the research paper supported the idea that there was some migration from the west. She added that the findings \"support the picture that we see in the archaeological record of a complex, multicultural process that has been resistant to reconstruction by any single historical model.\"\nModern archaeologists agree that the Philistines were different from their neighbors: their arrival on the eastern shores of the Mediterranean in the early 12th century B.C. is marked by pottery with close parallels to the ancient Greek world, the use of an Aegean\u2014instead of a Semitic\u2014script, and the consumption of pork.\nArchaeological evidence.\nTerritory.\nAccording to Joshua 13:3 and 1 Samuel 6:17, the land of the Philistines, called Philistia, was a pentapolis in the southwestern Levant comprising the five city-states of Gaza, Ashdod, Ashkelon, Ekron, and Gath, from Wadi Gaza in the south to the Yarqon River in the north, but with no fixed border to the east.\nTell Qasile (a \"port city\") and Aphek were located on the northern frontier of Philistine territory, and Tell Qasile in particular may have been inhabited by both Philistine and non-Philistine people.\nThe location of Gath is currently identified with the site of Tell es-Safi, not far from Ekron, based on archaeological and geographical evidence.\nThe identity of the city of Ziklag, which according to the Bible marked the border between the Philistine and Israelite territory, remains uncertain.\nIn the western part of the Jezreel Valley, 23 of the 26 Iron Age I sites (12th to 10th centuries BC) yielded typical Philistine pottery. These sites include Tel Megiddo, Tel Yokneam, Tel Qiri, Afula, Tel Qashish, Be'er Tiveon, Hurvat Hazin, Tel Risim, Tel Re'ala, Hurvat Tzror, Tel Sham, Midrakh Oz and Tel Zariq. Scholars have attributed the presence of Philistine pottery in northern Israel to their role as mercenaries for the Egyptians during the Egyptian military administration of the land in the 12th century BC. This presence may also indicate further expansion of the Philistines to the valley during the 11th century BC, or their trade with the Israelites. There are biblical references to Philistines in the valley during the times of the Judges. The quantity of Philistine pottery within these sites is still quite small, showing that even if the Philistines did settle the valley, they were a minority that blended within the Canaanite population during the 12th century BC. The Philistines seem to have been present in the southern valley during the 11th century, which may relate to the biblical account of their victory at the Battle of Gilboa.\nEgyptian inscriptions.\nSince Edward Hincks and William Osburn Jr. in 1846, biblical scholars have connected the biblical Philistines with the Egyptian \"Peleset\" inscriptions; and since 1873, both have been connected with the Aegean \"Pelasgians\". The evidence for these connections is etymological and has been disputed.\nBased on the Peleset inscriptions, it has been suggested that the Casluhite Philistines formed part of the conjectured \"Sea Peoples\" who repeatedly attacked Egypt during the later Nineteenth Dynasty. Though they were eventually repulsed by Ramesses III, he finally resettled them, according to the theory, to rebuild the coastal towns in Canaan. Papyrus Harris I details the achievements of the reign (1186\u20131155 BC) of Ramesses III. In the brief description of the outcome of the battles in Year 8 is the description of the fate of some of the conjectured Sea Peoples. Ramesses claims that, having brought the prisoners to Egypt, he \"settled them in strongholds, bound in my name. Numerous were their classes, hundreds of thousands strong. I taxed them all, in clothing and grain from the storehouses and granaries each year.\" Some scholars suggest it is likely that these \"strongholds\" were fortified towns in southern Canaan, which would eventually become the five cities (the pentapolis) of the Philistines. Israel Finkelstein has suggested that there may be a period of 25\u201350 years after the sacking of these cities and their reoccupation by the Philistines. It is possible that at first, the Philistines were housed in Egypt; only subsequently late in the troubled end of the reign of Ramesses III would they have been allowed to settle Philistia.\nThe \"Peleset\" appear in four different texts from the time of the New Kingdom. Two of these, the inscriptions at Medinet Habu and the Rhetorical Stela at Deir al-Medinah, are dated to the time of the reign of Ramesses III (1186\u20131155\u00a0BC). Another was composed in the period immediately following the death of Ramesses III (Papyrus Harris I). The fourth, the Onomasticon of Amenope, is dated to some time between the end of the 12th or early 11th century BC.\nThe inscriptions at Medinet Habu consist of images depicting a coalition of Sea Peoples, among them the Peleset, who are said in the accompanying text to have been defeated by Ramesses III during his Year 8 campaign. In about 1175\u00a0BC, Egypt was threatened with a massive land and sea invasion by the \"Sea Peoples,\" a coalition of foreign enemies which included the Tjeker, the Shekelesh, the Deyen, the Weshesh, the Teresh, the Sherden, and the \"PRST\". They were comprehensively defeated by Ramesses III, who fought them in \"Djahy\" (the eastern Mediterranean coast) and at \"the mouths of the rivers\" (the Nile Delta), recording his victories in a series of inscriptions in his mortuary temple at Medinet Habu. Scholars have been unable to conclusively determine which images match what peoples described in the reliefs depicting two major battle scenes. A separate relief on one of the bases of the Osiris pillars with an accompanying hieroglyphic text clearly identifying the person depicted as a captive \"Peleset\" chief is of a bearded man without headdress. This has led to the interpretation that Ramesses III defeated the Sea Peoples, including Philistines, and settled their captives in fortresses in southern Canaan; another related theory suggests that Philistines invaded and settled the coastal plain for themselves. The soldiers were quite tall and clean-shaven. They wore breastplates and short kilts, and their superior weapons included chariots drawn by two horses. They carried small shields and fought with straight swords and spears.\nThe Rhetorical Stela are less discussed, but are noteworthy in that they mention the \"Peleset\" together with a people called the \"Teresh\", who sailed \"in the midst of the sea\". The \"Teresh\" are thought to have originated from the Anatolian coast and their association with the \"Peleset\" in this inscription is seen as providing some information on the possible origin and identity of the Philistines.\nThe Harris Papyrus, which was found in a tomb at Medinet Habu, also recalls Ramesses III's battles with the Sea Peoples, declaring that the \"Peleset\" were \"reduced to ashes.\" The Papyrus Harris I, records how the defeated foe were brought in captivity to Egypt and settled in fortresses. The Harris papyrus can be interpreted in two ways: either the captives were settled in Egypt and the rest of the Philistines/Sea Peoples carved out a territory for themselves in Canaan, or else it was Ramesses himself who settled the Sea Peoples (mainly Philistines) in Canaan as mercenaries. Egyptian strongholds in Canaan are also mentioned, including a temple dedicated to Amun, which some scholars place in Gaza; however, the lack of detail indicating the precise location of these strongholds means that it is unknown what impact these had, if any, on Philistine settlement along the coast.\nThe only mention in an Egyptian source of the Peleset in conjunction with any of the five cities that are said in the Bible to have made up the Philistine pentapolis comes in the Onomasticon of Amenope. The sequence in question has been translated as: \"Ashkelon, Ashdod, Gaza, Assyria, Shubaru [...] \"Sherden\", \"Tjekker\", \"Peleset\", \"Khurma\" [...]\" Scholars have advanced the possibility that the other Sea Peoples mentioned were connected to these cities in some way as well.\nMaterial culture: Aegean origin and historical evolution.\nAegean connection.\nMany scholars have interpreted the ceramic and technological evidence attested to by archaeology as being associated with the Philistine advent in the area as strongly suggestive that they formed part of a large scale immigration to southern Canaan, probably from Anatolia and Cyprus, in the 12th century BC.\nThe proposed connection between Mycenaean culture and Philistine culture was further documented by finds at the excavation of Ashdod, Ekron, Ashkelon, and more recently Gath, four of the five Philistine cities in Canaan. The fifth city is Gaza. Especially notable is the early Philistine pottery, a locally made version of the Aegean Mycenaean Late Helladic IIIC pottery, which is decorated in shades of brown and black. This later developed into the distinctive Philistine pottery of the Iron Age I, with black and red decorations on white slip known as Philistine Bichrome ware. Also of particular interest is a large, well-constructed building covering , discovered at Ekron. Its walls are broad, designed to support a second story, and its wide, elaborate entrance leads to a large hall, partly covered with a roof supported on a row of columns. In the floor of the hall is a circular hearth paved with pebbles, as is typical in Mycenaean megaron hall buildings; other unusual architectural features are paved benches and podiums. Among the finds are three small bronze wheels with eight spokes. Such wheels are known to have been used for portable cultic stands in the Aegean region during this period, and it is therefore assumed that this building served cultic functions. Further evidence concerns an inscription in Ekron to PYGN or PYTN, which some have suggested refers to \"Potnia\", the title given to an ancient Mycenaean goddess. Excavations in Ashkelon, Ekron, and Gath reveal dog and pig bones which show signs of having been butchered, implying that these animals were part of the residents' diet. Among other findings there are wineries where fermented wine was produced, as well as loom weights resembling those of Mycenaean sites in Greece. Further evidence of the Aegean origin of the initial Philistine settlers was provided by studying their burial practices in the so far only discovered Philistine cemetery, excavated at Ashkelon (see below).\nHowever, for many years scholars such as Gloria London, John Brug, Shlomo Bunimovitz, Helga Weippert, and Edward Noort, among others, have noted the \"difficulty of associating pots with people\", proposing alternative suggestions such as potters following their markets or technology transfer, and emphasize the continuities with the local world in the material remains of the coastal area identified with \"Philistines\", rather than the differences emerging from the presence of Cypriote and/or Aegean/ Mycenaean influences. The view is summed up in the idea that 'kings come and go, but cooking pots remain', suggesting that the foreign Aegean elements in the Philistine population may have been a minority. However, Louise A. Hitchcock has pointed that other elements of Philistine material culture like their language, art, technology, architecture, rituals and administrative practices are rooted in Cypriot and Minoan civilizations, supporting the view that the Philistines were connected to the Aegean.\nFollowing DNA sequencing using the modern method, DNA testing has concluded sufficient evidence that there was indeed a notable surge of immigration from Aegean, supporting the Biblical/Aegean connection and theory that the Philistine people were initially a migrant group from Europe.\nGeographic evolution.\nMaterial culture evidence, primarily pottery styles, indicates that the Philistines originally settled in a few sites in the south, such as Ashkelon, Ashdod and Ekron. It was not until several decades later, about 1150\u00a0BC, that they expanded into surrounding areas such as the Yarkon region to the north (the area of modern Jaffa, where there were Philistine farmsteads at Tel Gerisa and Aphek, and a larger settlement at Tel Qasile). Most scholars, therefore, believe that the settlement of the Philistines took place in two stages. In the first, dated to the reign of Ramesses III, they were limited to the coastal plain, the region of the Five Cities; in the second, dated to the collapse of Egyptian hegemony in southern Canaan, their influence spread inland beyond the coast. During the 10th to 7th centuries BC, the distinctiveness of the material culture appears to have been absorbed with that of surrounding peoples.\nEarly connections.\nThere is evidence that Cretans traded with Levantine merchants since the Neolithic Minoan era, which increased by the Early Bronze Age. In the Middle Bronze Age, coastal plains in the southern Levant economically prospered due to long-distance exchange with the Aegean, Cypriot and Egyptian civilizations.\nThe Cretans also influenced the architecture of Middle Bronze Age Canaanite palaces such as Tel Kabri. Dr. Assaf Yasur-Landau of the University of Haifa said that \"it was, without doubt, a conscious decision made by the city's rulers who wished to associate with Mediterranean culture and not adopt Syrian and Mesopotamian styles of art like other cities in Canaan did; the Canaanites were living in the Levant and wanted to feel European.\"\nBurial practices.\nThe Leon Levy Expedition, consisting of archaeologists from Harvard University, Boston College, Wheaton College and Troy University, conducted a 30-year investigation of the burial practices of the Philistines, by excavating a Philistine cemetery containing more than 150 burials dating from the 11th to 8th century BC Tel Ashkelon. In July 2016, the expedition finally announced the results of their excavation.\nArchaeological evidence, provided by architecture, burial arrangements, ceramics, and pottery fragments inscribed with non-Semitic writing, indicates that the Philistines were not native to Canaan. Most of the 150 dead were buried in oval-shaped graves, some were interred in ashlar chamber tombs, while there were 4 who were cremated. These burial arrangements were very common to the Aegean cultures, but not to the one indigenous to Canaan. Lawrence Stager of Harvard University believes that Philistines came to Canaan by ships before the Battle of the Delta (c.\u20091175BC). DNA was extracted from the skeletons for archaeogenetic population analysis.\nThe Leon Levy Expedition, which has been going on since 1985, helped break down some of the previous assumptions that the Philistines were uncultured people by having evidence of perfume near the bodies in order for the deceased to smell it in the afterlife.\nPopulation.\nThe population of the area associated with Philistines is estimated to have been around 25,000 in the 12th century BC, rising to a peak of 30,000 in the 11th century BC. The Canaanite nature of the material culture and toponyms suggest that much of this population was indigenous, such that the migrant element would likely constitute less than half the total, and perhaps much less.\nLanguage.\nVirtually nothing is known for certain about the language of the Philistines. Pottery fragments from the period of circa 1500\u20131000 BC have been found bearing inscriptions in non-Semitic languages, including one in a Cypro-Minoan script. The Bible does not mention any language problems between the Israelites and the Philistines, as it does with other groups up to the Assyrian and Babylonian occupations. Later, under the Achaemenids, Nehemiah 13:23-24 records that when Judean men intermarried women from Moab, Ammon, and Philistine cities, half the offspring of Judean marriages with women from Ashdod could speak only their mother tongue, \"A\u0161d\u014dd\u012b\u1e6f\", not Judean Hebrew (\"Yeh\u016bd\u012b\u1e6f\"); although by then this language might have been an Aramaic dialect. There is some limited evidence in favour of the assumption that the Philistines were originally Indo-European-speakers, either from Greece or Luwian speakers from the coast of Asia Minor, on the basis of some Philistine-related words found in the Bible not appearing to be related to other Semitic languages. Such theories suggest that the Semitic elements in the language were borrowed from their neighbours in the region. For example, the Philistine word for captain, \"seren\", may be related to the Greek word \"tyrannos\" (thought by linguists to have been borrowed by the Greeks from an Anatolian language, such as Luwian or Lydian). Although most Philistine names are Semitic (such as Ahimelech, Mitinti, Hanun, and Dagon) some of the Philistine names, such as Goliath, Achish, and Phicol, appear to be of non-Semitic origin, and Indo-European etymologies have been suggested. Recent finds of inscriptions written in Hieroglyphic Luwian in Palistin substantiate a connection between the language of the kingdom of Palistin and the Philistines of the southwestern Levant.\nReligion.\nThe deities worshipped in the area were Baal, Ashteroth (that is, Astarte), Asherah, and Dagon, whose names or variations thereof had already appeared in the earlier attested Canaanite pantheon. The Philistines may also have worshipped Qudshu and Anat. Beelzebub, a supposed hypostasis of Baal, is described in the Hebrew Bible as the patron deity of Ekron, though no explicit attestation of such a god or his worship has thus far been discovered, and the name \"Baal-zebub\" itself may be the result of an intentional distortion by the Israelites. Another name, attested on the Ekron Royal Dedicatory Inscription, is PT[-]YH, unique to the Philistine sphere and possibly representing a goddess in their pantheon, though an exact identity has been subject to scholarly debate.\nAlthough the Bible cites Dagon as the main Philistine god, there is a stark lack of any evidence indicating the Philistines had any particular proclivity to his worship. In fact, no evidence of Dagon worship whatsoever is discernible at Philistine sites, with even theophoric names invoking the deity being unattested in the already limited corpus of known Philistine names. A further assessment of the Iron Age I finds worship of Dagon in any immediate Canaanite context, let alone one which is indisputably Philistine, as seemingly non-existent. Still, Dagon-worship probably wasn't completely unheard of amongst the Philistines, as multiple mentions of a city known as \"Beth Dagon\" in Assyrian, Phoenician, and Egyptian sources may imply the god was venerated in at least some parts of Philistia. Furthermore, the inscription of the sarcophagus of Eshmunazar II, dating to the 6th century BC, calls Jaffa, a Philistine city, one of the \"mighty lands of Dagon\", though this does little in the way of clarifying the god's importance to the Philistine pantheon.\nThe most common material religious artefact finds from Philistine sites are goddess figurines/chairs, sometimes called \"Ashdoda\". This seems to imply a dominant female figure, which is consistent with Ancient Aegean religion.\nEconomy.\nCities excavated in the area attributed to Philistines give evidence of careful town planning, including industrial zones. The olive industry of Ekron alone includes about 200 olive oil installations. Engineers estimate that the city's production may have been more than 1,000 tons, 30 percent of Israel's present-day production.\nThere is considerable evidence for a large industry in fermented drink. Finds include breweries, wineries, and retail shops marketing beer and wine. Beer mugs and wine kraters are among the most common pottery finds.\nThe Philistines also seemed to be experienced metalworkers, as complex wares of gold, bronze, and iron, have been found at Philistine sites as early as the 12th century BC, as well as artisanal weaponry.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was prime minister of Finland from 1995 to 2003, and chairman of the Social Democratic Party of Finland from 1993 to 2005. He also served as speaker of the Parliament of Finland from 2003 to 2007 and was his party's nominee in the 2012 Finnish presidential election but received only 6.7% of the votes, making it the biggest defeat the Social Democratic Party had ever received in Finnish presidential elections at the time. Lipponen is currently the oldest living former prime minister of Finland.\nCareer.\nLipponen was born in Turtola (subsequently renamed Pello), the son of Orvo Lipponen and his wife Hilkka Iisalo. Paavo's maternal grandparents were Jaakko Antero Ingman/Iisalo (a distant relative of Adolf Fredrik Munck and Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim) and his wife Siiri T\u00f6rnroos. Paavo Lipponen spent his childhood and youth in Kuopio.\nReceiving his gymnasium diploma from the Lyceum of Kuopio in 1959, he then studied philosophy and literature at Dartmouth College for one year on a Fulbright scholarship.\nSoon after returning to Finland, he moved to Helsinki where he eventually attained a master's degree in international relations from the University of Helsinki in 1971. He was the editor of the student newspaper 1963\u20131965 and a freelance reporter for the Finnish Broadcasting Company (YLE) 1965\u20131967.\nLipponen made various controversial statements that angered groups such as Estonian refugees.\nAccording to Alpo Rusi's book \"Vasemmalta ohi\", Lipponen began cooperation with the East German secret police Stasi in 1969. The book suggests that Lipponen is the code name Mungo XV/326/71 in the Rosenholz files. In a 2008 interview Lipponen said that he had been a \"target of East German manipulation\". It is rumored that Lipponen is on the so-called Tiitinen list. Alpo Rusi has also suggested that Lipponen had an alias, code, and operation in the KGB.\nHe held various posts in the Social Democratic Party organisation from 1967 to 1979. Lipponen's opinions were changed. In a speech in 1978, Lipponen asserted that he had lost his belief in socialism.\nLipponen first came into the political limelight when he was secretary to prime minister Mauno Koivisto from 1979 to 1982. Frequently having to substitute for the busy prime minister, Lipponen was soon dubbed \"vara-Manu\" (\"deputy Manu\" \u2014 \"Manu\" being short for Mauno).\nLipponen was a member of the Parliament of Finland from 1983 to 1987 and also from 1991 until he retired in 2007.\nIn 1993, SDP chairman Ulf Sundqvist was suspected and later convicted of a large financial fraud. Lipponen was elected the new chairman in 1993, and he led the party to victory in the parliamentary election of 1995. Lipponen formed a cabinet of five parties, including both rightist and leftist parties. Lipponen's economic policies were, however, dominated by the right-wing. The main task of the cabinet was to decrease the number of unemployed people. Tight fiscal policies allowed the participation of Finland in the European Monetary Union, which resulted in the introduction of the euro in 1999. Foreign trade increased above the European average 1995\u20131999. Laws for a new constitution were passed and it took effect on 1 March 2000.\nLipponen headed the SDP campaign in 1999, which resulted in losses, but the SDP remained the largest party in the parliament. The coalition formed in 1995 was renewed. During the second Lipponen cabinet, he headed Finland's six months in the EU presidency and pursued pro-integration and pro-expansion policies. Lipponen introduced the concept of a European constitution during a speech in Bruges in 2000.\nHe headed the SDP campaign of 2003, which led to victory for the SDP; however, the Center Party gained more seats, which marked the end for the succession of the cabinets of the SDP and the National Coalition Party. The chairman of the Center Party, Anneli J\u00e4\u00e4tteenm\u00e4ki, formed a new cabinet, and Lipponen took the position of speaker of Parliament. Lipponen retired from the party chairmanship in 2005 and was succeeded by Eero Hein\u00e4luoma. Lipponen left the parliament in 2007.\nAnneli J\u00e4\u00e4tteenm\u00e4ki of the Centre Party won the elections after she had accused Paavo Lipponen, who was prime minister at the time, of allying neutral Finland with the United States in the war in Iraq during a meeting with President George W. Bush, and thus associated Finland with what many Finns considered an illegal war of aggression. Lipponen denied the claims and declared that \"We support the UN and the UN Secretary-General.\" J\u00e4\u00e4tteenm\u00e4ki resigned as prime minister after 63 days in office amid accusations that she had lied about the leak of the documents about the meeting between Bush and Lipponen. This series of events was considered scandalous and it is named Iraq leak or Iraq-gate.\nOn 15 August 2008, during the 2008 South Ossetia war, Nord Stream 1, a Russian gas project, announced that it had signed a consulting contract with Lipponen. According to Nord Stream, he advises on the environmental impact assessment (EIA) and permit applications in Finland. He provides independent consultations according to his expertise in Finnish administrative and decision-making procedures within the energy sector.\nAs a result of the scandal that followed, Lipponen relinquished his office in the parliament building and resigned from all of his duties in Finland except veteran activities.\nIn an article published in October 2008, Lipponen discussed the Russian response in Georgia and warned Europe of its dependence on Russian gas. Lipponen criticised the way many Finnish and German politicians were opposed to nuclear power and stated that their fundamentalism destroys both energy security and climate policy.\nPoland reportedly blocked Lipponen's candidacy as EU foreign policy chief because of Lipponen's ties to Nord Stream.\nLipponen was his party's nominee in the 2012 Finnish presidential election. He was knocked out in the first round, receiving 6.7% of the vote.\nLipponen has declined the honour of being named a \"counselor of state\", the highest honour in Finland, saying that no-one outside of Finland knows what a \"valtioneuvos\" is and that he is satisfied with being \"former prime minister\".\nPersonal life.\nLipponen played water polo at the highest national level in his youth.\nHe currently lives with his second wife, P\u00e4ivi Lipponen (formerly Hertzberg, n\u00e9e Hiltunen), and has three children.\nPopular culture.\nLipponen appears as an animated character in the political satire TV series \"The Autocrats\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "24207", "revid": "51021853", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24207", "title": "Portsmouth", "text": "City in Hampshire, England\nPortsmouth ( ) is a port city and unitary authority in Hampshire, England. Most of Portsmouth is located on Portsea Island, off the south coast of England in the Solent, making Portsmouth the only city in England not located primarily on the mainland. The city is located south-east of Southampton, west of Brighton and Hove and south-west of London. With a population last recorded at 208,100, it is the most densely populated city in the United Kingdom. Portsmouth forms part of the South Hampshire urban area with Gosport, Fareham, Havant, Eastleigh and Southampton.\nPortsmouth's history can be traced to Roman times and has been a significant Royal Navy dockyard and base for centuries. Portsmouth was founded c.\u20091180 by Anglo-Norman merchant Jean de Gisors in the south-west area of Portsea Island, a location now known as Old Portsmouth. Around this time, de Gisors ordered the construction of a chapel dedicated to St Thomas Becket. This became a parish church by the 14th century. Portsmouth was established as a town with a royal charter on 2 May 1194. The city is home to the first drydock ever built. It was constructed by Henry VII in 1496.\nPortsmouth has the world's oldest dry dock, \"The Great Stone Dock\"; originally built in 1698, rebuilt in 1769 and presently known as \"No.5 Dock\". The world's first mass production line was established at the naval base's Block Mills which produced pulley blocks for the Royal Navy fleet. By the early-19th century, Portsmouth was the most heavily fortified city in the world, and was considered \"the world's greatest naval port\" at the height of the British Empire throughout \"Pax Britannica\". By 1859, a ring of defensive land and sea forts, known as the Palmerston Forts, had been built around Portsmouth in anticipation of an invasion from continental Europe.\nIn the 20th century, Portsmouth achieved city status on 21 April 1926. During the Second World War, the city was bombed extensively in the Portsmouth Blitz, which resulted in the deaths of 930 people, and it was a pivotal embarkation point for the D-Day landings. In 1982, a large Royal Navy task force departed from Portsmouth for the Falklands War. Her Majesty's Yacht \"Britannia\" was formerly based in Portsmouth and oversaw the transfer of Hong Kong in 1997, after which \"Britannia\" was retired from royal service, decommissioned and relocated to Leith as a museum ship.\nHMNB Portsmouth is an operational Royal Navy base and is home to two-thirds of the UK's surface fleet. The base has long been nicknamed \"Pompey\", a nickname it shares with the wider city of Portsmouth and Portsmouth Football Club. The naval base also contains the National Museum of the Royal Navy and Portsmouth Historic Dockyard; which has a collection of historic warships, including the \"Mary Rose\", Lord Nelson's flagship, (the world's oldest naval ship still in commission), and , the Royal Navy's first ironclad warship.\nThe former shore establishment has been redeveloped into a large retail outlet destination known as Gunwharf Quays which opened in 2001. Portsmouth is among the few British cities with two cathedrals: the Anglican Cathedral of St Thomas and the Roman Catholic Cathedral of St John the Evangelist. The waterfront and Portsmouth Harbour are dominated by the Spinnaker Tower, one of the United Kingdom's tallest structures at .\nSouthsea is Portsmouth's seaside resort, which was named after Southsea Castle. Southsea has two piers; Clarence Pier amusement park and South Parade Pier. The world's only regular hovercraft service operates from Southsea Hoverport to Ryde on the Isle of Wight. Southsea Common is a large open-air public recreation space which serves as a venue for a wide variety of annual events.\nThe city has several mainline railway stations that connect to London Victoria and London Waterloo amongst other lines in southern England. Portsmouth International Port is a commercial cruise ship and ferry port for international destinations. The port is the second busiest in the United Kingdom after Dover, handling around three million passengers a year. The city formerly had its own airport, Portsmouth Airport, until its closure in 1973. The University of Portsmouth enrolled 23,000 students.\nPortsmouth is the birthplace of notable people such as author Charles Dickens, engineer Isambard Kingdom Brunel, former Prime Minister James Callaghan, actor Peter Sellers and author-journalist Christopher Hitchens.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nThe Romans built Portus Adurni (now called Portchester Castle), a fort, at nearby Portchester in the late 3rd century. The city's Old English (Anglo-Saxon) name, \"Portesmu\u00f0a\", is derived from \"port\" (a haven) and \"mu\u00f0a\" (the mouth of a large river or estuary). In the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\", a warrior named Port and his two sons killed a noble Briton in Portsmouth in 501. Winston Churchill, in \"A History of the English-Speaking Peoples\", wrote that Port was a pirate who founded Portsmouth in 501.\nEngland's southern coast was vulnerable to Danish Viking invasions during the eighth and ninth centuries, and was conquered by Danish pirates in 787. In 838, during the reign of \u00c6thelwulf, King of Wessex, a Danish fleet landed between Portsmouth and Southampton and plundered the region. \u00c6thelwulf sent Wulfherd and the governor of Dorsetshire to confront the Danes at Portsmouth, where most of their ships were docked. Although the Danes were driven off, Wulfherd was killed. The Danes returned in 1001 and pillaged Portsmouth and the surrounding area, threatening the English with extinction. They were massacred by the English survivors the following year; rebuilding began, although the town experienced further attacks until 1066.\nNorman to Tudor.\nAlthough Portsmouth was not mentioned in the 1086 Domesday Book, \"Bocheland\" (Buckland), \"Copenore\" (Copnor), and \"Frodentone\" (Fratton) were. According to some sources, it was founded in 1180 by the Anglo-Norman merchant Jean de Gisors.\nKing Henry II died in 1189; his son, Richard I (who had spent most of his life in France), arrived in Portsmouth en route to his coronation in London. When Richard returned from captivity in Austria in May 1194, he summoned an army and a fleet of 100 ships to the port. Richard gave Portsmouth market-town status with a royal charter on 2 May, authorising an annual fifteen-day free-market fair, weekly markets and a local court to deal with minor matters, and exempted its inhabitants from an \u00a318 annual tax. The 1194 royal charter's 800th anniversary was celebrated in 1994 with ceremonies at the city museum.\nKing John reaffirmed RichardI's rights and privileges, and established a permanent naval base. The first docks were begun by William of Wrotham in 1212, and John summoned his earls, barons, and military advisers to plan an invasion of Normandy. In 1229, declaring war against France, HenryIII assembled a force described by historian Lake Allen as \"one of the finest armies that had ever been raised in England\". The invasion stalled, and returned from France in October 1231. HenryIII summoned troops to invade Guienne in 1242, and EdwardI sent supplies for his army in France in 1295. Commercial interests had grown by the following century, and its exports included wool, corn, grain, and livestock.\nEdward II ordered all ports on the south coast to assemble their largest vessels at Portsmouth to carry soldiers and horses to the Duchy of Aquitaine in 1324 to strengthen defences. A French fleet commanded by David II of Scotland attacked in the English Channel, ransacked the Isle of Wight and threatened the town. EdwardIII instructed all maritime towns to build vessels and raise troops to rendezvous at Portsmouth. Two years later, a French fleet led by Nicholas B\u00e9huchet raided Portsmouth and destroyed most of the town; only the stone-built church and hospital survived. After the raid, EdwardIII exempted the town from national taxes to aid its reconstruction. In 1377, shortly after Edward died, the French landed in Portsmouth. Although the town was plundered and burnt, its inhabitants drove the French off to raid towns in the West Country.\nHenry V gathered his forces in Portsmouth for an invasion of France in 1415, it was while staying at Portchester Castle that the Southampton plot was uncovered. This campaign would culminate with victory at the battle of Agincourt. He also built Portsmouth's first permanent fortifications. In 1416, a number of French ships blockaded the town (which housed ships which were set to invade Normandy); Henry gathered a fleet at Southampton, and invaded the Norman coast in August that year. Recognising the town's growing importance, he ordered a wooden Round Tower to be built at the mouth of the harbour; it was completed in 1426. Henry VII rebuilt the fortifications with stone, assisted Robert Brygandine and Sir Reginald Bray in the construction of the world's first dry dock, and raised the Square Tower in 1494. He made Portsmouth a Royal Dockyard, England's only dockyard considered \"national\". Although King Alfred may have used Portsmouth to build ships as early as the ninth century, the first warship recorded as constructed in the town was the \"Sweepstake\" (built in 1497).\nHenry VIII built Southsea Castle, financed by the Dissolution of the Monasteries, in 1539 in anticipation of a French invasion. He also invested heavily in the town's dockyard, expanding it to . Around this time, a Tudor defensive boom stretched from the Round Tower to Fort Blockhouse in Gosport to protect Portsmouth Harbour.\nFrom Southsea Castle, Henry witnessed his flagship \"Mary Rose\" sink in action against the French fleet in the 1545 Battle of the Solent with the loss of about 500 lives. Some historians believe that the \"Mary Rose\" turned too quickly and submerged her open gun ports; according to others, it sank due to poor design. Portsmouth's fortifications were improved by successive monarchs. The town experienced an outbreak of plague in 1563, which killed about 300 of its 2,000 inhabitants.\nStuart to Georgian.\nIn 1623, Charles I (then Prince of Wales) returned to Portsmouth from France and Spain. His unpopular military adviser, George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham, was stabbed to death in an Old Portsmouth pub by war veteran John Felton five years later. Felton never attempted to escape, and was caught walking the streets when soldiers confronted him; he said, \"I know that he is dead, for I had the force of forty men when I struck the blow\". Felton was hanged, and his body chained to a gibbet on Southsea Common as a warning to others. The murder took place in the Greyhound public house on High Street, which is now Buckingham House and has a commemorative plaque.\nMost residents (including the mayor) supported the parliamentarians during the English Civil War, although military governor Colonel Goring supported the royalists. The town, a base of the parliamentarian navy, was blockaded from the sea. Parliamentarian troops were sent to besiege it, and the guns of Southsea Castle were fired at the town's royalist garrison. Parliamentarians in Gosport joined the assault, damaging St Thomas's Church. On 5 September 1642, the remaining royalists in the garrison at the Square Tower were forced to surrender after Goring threatened to blow it up; he and his garrison were allowed safe passage out of the city.\nAfter the end of the Civil War, Portsmouth was among the first towns to declare CharlesII king and began to prosper. The first ship built in over 100 years, , was launched in 1650; twelve ships were built between 1650 and 1660. Under the Commonwealth of England, Robert Blake used the harbour as his base during the First Anglo-Dutch War in 1652 and the Anglo-Spanish War. He died within sight of the town, returning from C\u00e1diz in 1657. After the Restoration, CharlesII married Catherine of Braganza at the Royal Garrison Church on 14 May 1662. Catherine was reputed to have introduced the cultural practice of tea drinking to England at this event.\nDuring the late 17th century, Portsmouth continued to grow; a new wharf was constructed in 1663 for military use, and a mast pond was dug in 1665. In 1684, a list of ships docked in Portsmouth was evidence of its increasing national importance. Between 1667 and 1685, the town's fortifications were rebuilt; new walls were constructed with bastions and two moats were dug, making Portsmouth one of the world's most heavily fortified places.\nIn 1759, General James Wolfe sailed to capture Quebec; the expedition, although successful, cost him his life. His body was brought back to Portsmouth in November, and received high naval and military honours. Two years later, on 30 May 1775, Captain James Cook arrived on after circumnavigating the globe. The 11-ship First Fleet left on 13 May 1787 to establish the first European colony in Australia, the beginning of prisoner transportation; Captain William Bligh of also sailed from the harbour that year. After the 28 April 1789 mutiny on the \"Bounty\", was dispatched from Portsmouth to bring the mutineers back for trial. The court-martial opened on 12 September 1792 aboard in Portsmouth Harbour; of the ten remaining men, three were sentenced to death. In 1789, a chapel was erected in Prince George's Street and was dedicated to St John by the Bishop of Winchester. Around this time, a bill was passed in the House of Commons on the creation of a canal to link Portsmouth to Chichester; however, the project was abandoned.\nThe city's nickname, Pompey, is thought to have derived from the log entry of Portsmouth Point (contracted \"Po'm.P.\" \u2013 \"Po\"'rts\"m\"outh \"P.\"oint) as ships entered the harbour; navigational charts use the contraction. According to one historian, the name may have been brought back from a group of Portsmouth-based sailors who visited Pompey's Pillar in Alexandria, Egypt, around 1781. Another theory is that it is named after the harbour's guardship, , a 74-gun French ship of the line captured in 1793.\nPortsmouth's coat of arms is attested in the early 19th century as \"azure a crescent or, surmounted by an estoile of eight points of the last.\" Its design is apparently based on 18th-century mayoral seals. A connection of the coat of arms with the Great Seal of Richard I (which had a separate star and crescent) dates to the 20th century.\nIndustrial Revolution to Edwardian.\nMarc Isambard Brunel established the world's first mass-production line at Portsmouth Block Mills, making pulley blocks for rigging on the navy's ships. The first machines were installed in January 1803, and the final set (for large blocks) in March 1805. In 1808, the mills produced 130,000 blocks. By the turn of the 19th century, Portsmouth was the largest industrial site in the world; it had a workforce of 8,000, and an annual budget of \u00a3570,000.\nIn 1805, Admiral Nelson left Portsmouth to command the fleet which defeated France and Spain at the Battle of Trafalgar. The Royal Navy's reliance on Portsmouth led to its becoming the most fortified city in the world. The Royal Navy's West Africa Squadron, tasked with halting the slave trade, began operating out of Portsmouth in 1808. A network of forts, known as the Palmerston Forts, was built around the town as part of a programme led by Prime Minister Lord Palmerston to defend British military bases from an inland attack following an Anglo-French war scare in 1859. The forts were nicknamed \"Palmerston's Follies\" because their armaments were pointed inland and not out to sea.\nIn April 1811, the Portsea Island Company constructed the first piped-water supply to upper- and middle-class houses. It supplied water to about 4,500 of Portsmouth's 14,000 houses, generating an income of \u00a35,000 a year. HMS \"Victory\"'s active career ended in 1812, when she was moored in Portsmouth Harbour and used as a depot ship. The town of Gosport contributed \u00a375 a year to the ship's maintenance. In 1818, John Pounds began teaching working-class children in the country's first ragged school. The Portsea Improvement Commissioners installed gas street lighting throughout Portsmouth in 1820, followed by Old Portsmouth three years later.\nDuring the 19th century, Portsmouth expanded across Portsea Island. Buckland was merged into the town by the 1860s, and Fratton and Stamshaw were incorporated by the next decade. Between 1865 and 1870, the council built sewers after more than 800 people died in a cholera epidemic; according to a by-law, any house within of a sewer had to be connected to it. By 1871 the population had risen to 100,000, and the national census listed Portsmouth's population as 113,569. A working-class suburb was constructed in the 1870s, when about 1,820 houses were built, and it became Somerstown. Despite public-health improvements, 514 people died in an 1872 smallpox epidemic. On 21 December of that year, the \"Challenger\" expedition embarked on a circumnavigation of the globe for scientific research.\nWhen the British Empire was at its height of power, covering a quarter of Earth's total land area and 458\u00a0million people at the turn of the 20th century, Portsmouth was considered \"the world's greatest naval port\". In 1900, Portsmouth Dockyard employed 8,000 people\u2013 a figure which increased to 23,000 during the First World War. The whole of Portsea Island came united under the control of Portsmouth borough council in 1904.\nIn 1906, was launched from Portsmouth Dockyard. The ship revolutionised naval warfare and began an arms race with Germany. The ship's entry into service in 1906 represented such an advance in naval technology that her name came to be associated with an entire generation of battleships.\n1913 terrorist attack.\nA major terrorist incident occurred in the city in 1913, which led to the deaths of two men. During the suffragette bombing and arson campaign of 1912\u20131914, militant suffragettes of the Women's Social and Political Union carried out a series of politically motivated bombing and arson attacks nationwide as part of their campaign for women's suffrage. In one of the more serious suffragette attacks, a fire was purposely started at Portsmouth dockyard on 20 December 1913, in which two sailors were killed after it spread through the industrial area. The fire spread rapidly as there were many old wooden buildings in the area, including the historic semaphore tower which dated back to the eighteenth century, which was completely destroyed. The damage to the dockyard area cost the city \u00a3200,000 in damages, equivalent to \u00a323,600,000 today. In the midst of the firestorm, a battleship, , had to be towed to safety to avoid the flames. The two victims were a pensioner and a signalman.\nThe attack was notable enough to be reported on in the press in the United States, with the \"New York Times\" reporting on the disaster two days after with the headline \"Big Portsmouth Fire Loss\". The report also disclosed that at a previous police raid on a suffragette headquarters, \"papers were discovered disclosing a plan to fire the yard\".\nFirst and Second World Wars.\nOn 1 October 1916, Portsmouth was bombed by a Zeppelin airship. Although the Oberste Heeresleitung (German Supreme Army Command) said that the town was \"lavishly bombarded with good results\", there were no reports of bombs dropped in the area. According to another source, the bombs were mistakenly dropped into the harbour rather than the dockyard. About 1,200 ships were refitted in the dockyard during the war, making it one of the empire's most strategic ports at the time.\nPortsmouth's boundaries were extended onto the mainland of Great Britain between 1920 and 1932 by incorporating Paulsgrove, Wymering, Cosham, Drayton and Farlington into Portsmouth. Portsmouth was granted city status in 1926 after a long campaign by the borough council. The application was made on the grounds that it was the \"first naval port of the kingdom\". In 1929, the city council added the motto \"Heaven's Light Our Guide\" to the medieval coat of arms. Except for the celestial objects in the arms, the motto was that of the Star of India and referred to the troopships bound for British India which left from the port. The crest and supporters are based on those of the royal arms, but altered to show the city's maritime connections: the lions and unicorn have fish tails, and a naval crown and a representation of the Tudor defensive boom which stretched across Portsmouth Harbour are around the unicorn's neck.\nDuring the Second World War, the city (particularly the port) was bombed extensively by the Luftwaffe in the Portsmouth Blitz. Portsmouth experienced 67 air raids between July 1940 and May 1944, which destroyed 6,625 houses and severely damaged 6,549. The air raids caused 930 deaths and wounded almost 3,000 people, many in the dockyard and military establishments. On the night of the city's heaviest raid (10 January 1941), the Luftwaffe dropped 140 tonnes of high-explosive bombs which killed 171 people and left 3,000 homeless. Many of the city's houses were damaged, and areas of Landport and Old Portsmouth destroyed; the future site of Gunwharf Quays was razed to the ground. The Guildhall was hit by an incendiary bomb which burnt out the interior and destroyed its inner walls, although the civic plate was retrieved unharmed from the vault under the front steps. After the raid, Portsmouth mayor Denis Daley wrote for the \"Evening News\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;We are bruised but we are not daunted, and we are still as determined as ever to stand side by side with other cities who have felt the blast of the enemy, and we shall, with them, persevere with an unflagging spirit towards a conclusive and decisive victory.\u2014\u200a\nPortsmouth Harbour was a vital military embarkation point for the 6 June 1944 D-Day landings. Southwick House, just north of the city, was the headquarters of Supreme Allied Commander Dwight D. Eisenhower. A V-1 flying bomb hit Newcomen Road on 15 July 1944, killing 15 people.\n1945 to present.\nMuch of the city's housing stock was damaged during the war. The wreckage was cleared in an attempt to improve housing quality after the war; before permanent accommodations could be built, Portsmouth City Council built prefabs for those who had lost their homes. More than 700 prefab houses were constructed between 1945 and 1947, some over bomb sites. The first permanent houses were built away from the city centre, in new developments such as Paulsgrove and Leigh Park; construction of council estates in Paulsgrove was completed in 1953. The first Leigh Park housing estates were completed in 1949, although construction in the area continued until 1974. Builders still occasionally find unexploded bombs, such as on the site of the destroyed Hippodrome Theatre in 1984. Despite efforts by the city council to build new housing, a 1955 survey indicated that 7,000 houses in Portsmouth were unfit for human habitation. A controversial decision was made to replace a section of the central city, including Landport, Somerstown and Buckland, with council housing during the 1960s and early 1970s. The success of the project and the quality of its housing are debatable.\nPortsmouth was affected by the decline of the British Empire in the second half of the 20th century. Shipbuilding jobs fell from 46\u00a0per cent of the workforce in 1951 to 14 per cent in 1966, drastically reducing manpower in the dockyard. The city council attempted to create new work; an industrial estate was built in Fratton in 1948, and others were built at Paulsgrove and Farlington during the 1950s and 1960s. Although traditional industries such as brewing and corset manufacturing disappeared during this time, electrical engineering became a major employer. Despite the cutbacks in traditional sectors, Portsmouth remained attractive to industry. Zurich Insurance Group moved their UK headquarters to the city in 1968, and IBM relocated their European headquarters in 1979. Portsmouth's population had dropped from about 200,000 to 177,142 by the end of the 1960s. Defence Secretary John Nott decided in the early 1980s that of the four home dockyards, Portsmouth and Chatham would be closed. The city council won a concession, however, and the dockyard was downgraded instead to a naval base.\nIn 1956, the Soviet cruiser Ordzhonikidze docked in Portsmouth harbour on a diplomatic mission that had taken head of state Nikita Khrushchev and Nikolai Bulganin to Britain. Naval intelligence was interested in the design of the ship and MI6 recruited diver Lionel Crabb to collect intelligence on the ship particularly its propulsion. After diving into the harbour Crabb was never seen again. This led to a diplomatic incident with the Soviet Union and scandal in British domestic politics.\nOn 2 April 1982, Argentine forces invaded two British territories in the South Atlantic: the Falkland Islands and South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands. The British government's response was to dispatch a naval task force, and the aircraft carriers and sailed from Portsmouth for the South Atlantic on 5\u00a0April. The successful outcome of the war reaffirmed Portsmouth's significance as a naval port and its importance to the defence of British interests. In January 1997, Her Majesty's Yacht \"Britannia\" embarked from the city on her final voyage to oversee the handover of Hong Kong; for many, this marked the end of the empire. She was decommissioned on 11 December of that year at Portsmouth Naval Base in the presence of Elizabeth II, the Duke of Edinburgh, and twelve senior members of the royal family.\nRedevelopment of the naval shore establishment began in 2001 as a complex of retail outlets, clubs, pubs, and a shopping centre known as Gunwharf Quays. Construction of the Spinnaker Tower, sponsored by the National Lottery, began at Gunwharf Quays in 2003. The Tricorn Centre, called \"the ugliest building in the UK\" by the BBC, was demolished in late 2004 after years of debate over the expense of demolition and whether it was worth preserving as an example of 1960s brutalist architecture. Designed by Owen Luder as part of a project to \"revitalise\" Portsmouth in the 1960s, it consisted of a shopping centre, market, nightclubs, and a multistorey car park. Portsmouth celebrated the 200th anniversary of the Battle of Trafalgar in 2005, with Queen Elizabeth II present at a fleet review and a mock battle. The naval base is home to two-thirds of Britain's surface fleet. The city also hosted international commemorations for 50th, 75th and 80th anniversaries of the D-Day landings, these were attended by international leaders and remaining veterans.\nGeography.\nPortsmouth is by road from central London, west of Brighton, and east of Southampton. It is located primarily on Portsea Island and is the United Kingdom's only island city, although the city has expanded to the mainland. Gosport is a town and borough to the west. Portsea Island is separated from the mainland by Portsbridge Creek, which is crossed by three road bridges (the M275 motorway, the A3 road, and the A2030 road), a railway bridge, and two footbridges. Portsea Island, part of the Hampshire Basin, is low-lying; most of the island is less than above sea level. The island's highest natural elevation is the Kingston Cross road junction, at above ordinary spring tide.\nOld Portsmouth, the original town, is in the south-west part of the island and includes Portsmouth Point (nicknamed Spice Island). The main channel entering Portsmouth Harbour, west of the island, passes between Old Portsmouth and Gosport. Portsmouth Harbour has a series of lakes, including Fountain Lake (near the commercial port), Portchester Lake (south central), Paulsgrove Lake (north), Brick Kiln Lake and Tipner (east), and Bombketch and Spider Lakes (west). Further northwest, around Portchester, are Wicor, Cams, and Great Cams Lakes. The large tidal inlet of Langstone Harbour is east of the island. The Farlington Marshes, in the north off the coast of Farlington, is a grazing marsh and saline lagoon. One of the oldest local reserves in the county, built from reclaimed land in 1771, it provides a habitat for migratory wildfowl and waders.\nSouth of Portsmouth are Spithead, the Solent, and the Isle of Wight. Its southern coast was fortified by the Round Tower, the Square Tower, Southsea Castle, Lumps Fort and Fort Cumberland. Four sea forts were built in the Solent by Lord Palmerston: Spitbank Fort, St Helens Fort, Horse Sand Fort and No Man's Land Fort.\nThe resort of Southsea is on the central southern shoreline of Portsea Island, and Eastney is east. Eastney Lake covered nearly in 1626. North of Eastney is the residential Milton and an area of reclaimed land known as Milton Common (formerly Milton Lake), a \"flat scrubby land with a series of freshwater lakes\". Further north on the east coast is Baffins, with the Great Salterns recreation ground and golf course around Portsmouth College.\nThe Hilsea Lines are a series of defunct fortifications on the island's north coast, bordering Portsbridge Creek and the mainland. Portsdown Hill dominates the skyline in the north, and contains several large Palmerston Forts such as Fort Fareham, Fort Wallington, Fort Nelson, Fort Southwick, Fort Widley, and Fort Purbrook. Portsdown Hill is a large band of chalk; the rest of Portsea Island is composed of layers of London Clay and sand (part of the Bagshot Formation), formed principally during the Eocene.\nNorthern areas of the city include Stamshaw, Hilsea and Copnor, Cosham, Drayton, Farlington, Paulsgrove and Port Solent. Other districts include North End and Fratton. The west of the city contains council estates, such as Buckland, Landport, and Portsea, which replaced Victorian terraces destroyed by Second World War bombing. After the war, the Leigh Park estate was built to address the chronic housing shortage during post-war reconstruction. Although the estate has been under the jurisdiction of Havant Borough Council since the early 2000s, Portsmouth City Council remains its landlord (the borough's largest landowner).\nThe city's main station, Portsmouth and Southsea railway station, is in the city centre near the Guildhall and the Civic Offices. South of the Guildhall is Guildhall Walk, with a number of pubs and clubs. The city's other railway station, Portsmouth Harbour railway station, is located on a pier at the harbour's edge, near Old Portsmouth. Edinburgh Road contains the city's Roman Catholic cathedral and Victoria Park, a park which opened in 1878.\nClimate.\nPortsmouth has a mild oceanic climate, with more sunshine than most of the British Isles. Frosts are light and short-lived and snow is quite rare in winter, with temperatures rarely dropping below freezing. The average maximum temperature in January is , and the average minimum is . The lowest recorded temperature is . In summer, temperatures sometimes reach . The average maximum temperature in July is , and the average minimum is . The highest recorded temperature is . The city gets about of rain annually, with a minimum of of rain reported 103 days per year.\nDemography.\nPortsmouth is the second-most densely populated city in the United Kingdom, after London. In the 2021 census, the city had 208,100 residents. The city used to be even more densely populated, with the 1951 census showing a population of 233,545. In a reversal of that decrease, its population has been gradually increasing since the 1990s. With about 860,000 residents, South Hampshire is the fifth-largest urban area in England and the largest in South-East England outside London; it is the centre of one of the United Kingdom's most-populous metropolitan areas.\nThe city is predominantly white (85.3% of the population). However, Portsmouth's long association with the Royal Navy ensures some diversity. Some large, well-established non-white communities have their roots in the Royal Navy, particularly the Chinese community from British Hong Kong. Portsmouth's long industrial history with the Royal Navy has drawn many people from across the British Isles (particularly Irish Catholics) to its factories and docks. According to the 2021 census, Portsmouth's population was 78% White British, 6.8% other White, 2.3% Bangladeshi, 2.6% mixed race, 1.5% Indian, 1.0% Chinese, 1.8% other, 0.5% Black African, 0.5% white Irish, 1.8% other Asian, 0.3% Pakistani, 2.6% Black Caribbean and 0.4% other Black.\nPolitics.\nThe city is administered by Portsmouth City Council, a unitary authority which is responsible for local affairs. Portsmouth was granted its first market town charter in 1194. In 1904, its boundaries were extended to all of Portsea Island and were later expanded onto the mainland of Great Britain between 1920 and 1932 by incorporating Paulsgrove, Wymering, Cosham, Drayton and Farlington into Portsmouth. Portsmouth was granted city status on 21 April 1926.\nOn 1 April 1974, it formed the second tier of local government (below Hampshire County Council); Portsmouth and Southampton became administratively independent of Hampshire with the creation of the unitary authority on 1 April 1997.\nThe city is divided into two parliamentary constituencies, Portsmouth South and Portsmouth North, represented in the House of Commons by Stephen Morgan and Amanda Martin, both of the Labour Party. The two Parliamentary constituencies each contain 7 electoral wards, giving an overall total of 14 electoral wards. Portsmouth's inner city centre is located in the Portsmouth South constituency.\nPortsmouth City Council has 14 electoral wards, each ward returns three councillors, making 42 in total. Each councillor serves a four-year term. After the May 2018 local elections, the Liberal Democrats formed a minority administration, they have run the city since then. The leader of the council is the Liberal Democrat, Gerald Vernon-Jackson. The lord mayor usually has a one-year term.\nThe council is based in the Civic Offices, which house the tax support, housing-benefits, resident-services, and municipal-functions departments. They are in Guildhall Square, with the Portsmouth Guildhall and Portsmouth Central Library. The Guildhall, a symbol of Portsmouth, is a cultural venue. It was designed by Leeds-based architect William Hill, who began it in the neo-classical style in 1873 at a cost of \u00a3140,000. It was opened to the public in 1890.\nMinister for Portsmouth.\nBetween January 2014 and July 2016, Portsmouth uniquely had a dedicated government minister, the Minister for Portsmouth, a position created in response to the loss of 900 jobs from BAE Systems within HMNB Portsmouth. The minister was charged with bringing economic growth to the city.\nEconomy.\nTen per cent of Portsmouth's workforce is employed at Portsmouth Naval Dockyard, which is linked to the city's biggest industry, defence; the headquarters of BAE Systems Surface Ships is in the city. BAE's Portsmouth shipyard received construction work on the two new s. A \u00a3100\u00a0million contract was signed to develop needed facilities for the vessels. However defence shipbuilding was ended in the city in favour of Glasgow during the 2014 Scottish Independence referendum. The Government was accused of making the decision to keep the more antiquated Glasgow shipyard over Portsmouth for political reasons as part of the pro union campaign. Ministers at the time did state shipbuilding would return to the city if Scotland left the UK. A minister for Portsmouth was established to help deal with the economic fallout of the decision.\nA ferry port handles passengers and cargo, and a fishing fleet of 20 to 30 boats operates out of Camber Quay, Old Portsmouth; most of the catch is sold at the quayside fish market.\nThe city is host to IBM's UK headquarters and Portsmouth was also the UK headquarters of Zurich Financial Services until 2007. City shopping is centred on Commercial Road and the 1980s Cascades Shopping Centre. The shopping centre has 185,000 to 230,000 visitors weekly. Redevelopment has created new shopping areas, including the Gunwharf Quays (the repurposed shore establishment, with stores, restaurants and a cinema) and the Historic Dockyard, which caters to tourists and holds an annual Victorian Christmas market. Ocean Retail Park, on the north-eastern side of Portsea Island, was built in September 1985 on the site of a former metal-box factory.\nDevelopment of Gunwharf Quays continued until 2007, when the No.1 Gunwharf Quays residential tower was completed. The development of the former Brickwoods Brewery site included the construction of the 22-storey Admiralty Quarter Tower, the tallest in a complex of primarily low-rise residential buildings. Number One Portsmouth, a proposed 25-storey tower opposite Portsmouth &amp; Southsea station, was announced at the end of October 2008. In August 2009, internal demolition of the existing building had begun. A high-rise student dormitory, nicknamed \"The Blade\", has begun construction on the site of the swimming baths at the edge of Victoria Park. The tower will be Portsmouth's second-tallest structure, after the Spinnaker Tower.\nIn April 2007, Portsmouth F.C. announced plans to move from Fratton Park to a new stadium on reclaimed land next to the Historic Dockyard. The \u00a3600\u00a0million mixed-use development, designed by Herzog &amp; de Meuron, would include shops, offices and 1,500 harbourside apartments. The scheme was criticised for its size and location, and some officials said that it would interfere with harbour operations. The project was rejected by the city council due to the 2008 financial crisis.\nPortsmouth's two Queen Elizabeth-class aircraft carriers, and , were ordered by defence secretary Des Browne on 25 July 2007. They were built in the Firth of Forth at Rosyth Dockyard and BAE Systems Surface Ships in Glasgow, Babcock International at Rosyth, and at HMNB Portsmouth. The government announced before the 2014 Scottish independence referendum that military shipbuilding would end in Portsmouth, with all UK surface-warship construction focused on the two older BAE facilities in Glasgow. The announcement was criticised by local politicians as a political decision to aid the referendum's \"No\" campaign.\nCulture.\nPortsmouth has several theatres. The New Theatre Royal in Guildhall Walk, near the city centre, specialises in professional drama. The restored Kings Theatre in Southsea features amateur musicals and national tours. The Groundlings Theatre, built in 1784, is housed at the Old Beneficial School in Portsea. New Prince's Theatre and Southsea's Kings Theatre were designed by Victorian architect Frank Matcham.\nThe city has three musical venues: the Guildhall, the Wedgewood Rooms (which includes Edge of the Wedge, a smaller venue), and Portsmouth Pyramids Centre. Portsmouth Guildhall is one of the largest venues in South East England, with a seating capacity of 2,500. A concert series is presented at the Guildhall by the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra. The Portsmouth Sinfonia approached classical music from a different angle during the 1970s, recruiting players with no musical training or who played an instrument new to them. The Portsmouth Summer Show is held at King George's Fields. The 2016 show held during the last weekend of April, featured cover bands such as the Silver Beatles, the Bog Rolling Stones, and Fleetingwood Mac.\nA number of musical works are set in the city. \"H.M.S. Pinafore\" is a comic opera in two acts set in Portsmouth Harbour, with music by Arthur Sullivan and libretto by W.S. Gilbert. \"Portsmouth Point\" is a 1925 overture for orchestra by English composer William Walton, inspired by Thomas Rowlandson's etching of Portsmouth Point in Old Portsmouth. The overture has been recorded many times, and often played at the BBC Proms. John Cranko's 1951 ballet \"Pineapple Poll\", which features music from Gilbert and Sullivan's operetta \"The Bumboat Woman's Story\", is also set in Portsmouth.\nPortsmouth hosts yearly remembrances of the D-Day landings, attended by veterans from Allied and Commonwealth nations. The city played a major role in the 50th D-Day anniversary in 1994; visitors included US President Bill Clinton, Australian Prime Minister Paul Keating, King Harald V of Norway, French President Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, New Zealand Prime Minister Jim Bolger, Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chr\u00e9tien, Prime Minister John Major, the Queen, and the Duke of Edinburgh. The 75th Anniversary of D-Day was similarly commemorated in the city. Prime Minister Theresa May led the event, and was joined by leaders of the US, Canada, Australia, France and Germany.\nThe annual Portsmouth International Kite Festival, organised by the city council and the Kite Society of Great Britain, celebrated its 25th anniversary in 2016.\nVictorious Festival, the biggest metropolitan music festival in the UK takes place on Southsea Seafront in Portsmouth. It has been an annual event at this location since 2014. It is a large family-friendly music festival and has featured headliners including Stereophonics, Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds, The Prodigy, and other prominent household names.\nPortsmouth is frequently used as a filming location for television and film productions, especially the Historic Dockyard. Productions include \"Tommy\", \"Tomorrow Never Dies\" (1997), \"Mansfield Park\" and the Hollywood adaptation of \"Les Miserables\".\nIn 2005, Portsmouth featured in the first series of ITV's \"Britain's Toughest Towns\". As this documentary also indicated, Portsmouth has issues with gangs and anti-social behaviour.\nPortsmouth is home to Paul Stone, the street artist known as My Dog Sighs. In 2021, for his INSIDE exhibition, he transformed a derelict ballroom into an immersive world inhabited by creatures that he called 'Quiet Little Voices'. In 2023 he celebrated 20 years as a street artist by hiding \u00a330,000 of art across the city in a Free Art giveaway. He has been awarded an honorary doctorate by University of Portsmouth.\nPortsmouth City Council made a bid on 28 November 2025 to become UK City of Culture 2029.\nLiterature.\nPortsmouth is the hometown of Fanny Price, the main character of Jane Austen's novel \"Mansfield Park\", and most of its closing chapters are set there. Nicholas and Smike, the main protagonists of Charles Dickens' novel \"The Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby\", make their way to Portsmouth and become involved with a theatrical troupe. Portsmouth is most often the port from which Captain Jack Aubrey's ships sail in Patrick O'Brian's seafaring historical Aubrey-Maturin series. Portsmouth is the main setting of Jonathan Meades's 1993 novel \"Pompey\". Since the novel was published, Meades has presented a TV programme documenting Victorian architecture in Portsmouth Dockyard.\nVictorian novelist and historian Sir Walter Besant documented his 1840s childhood in \"By Celia's Arbour: A Tale of Portsmouth Town\", precisely describing the town before its defensive walls were removed. Southsea (as Port Burdock) features in \"The History of Mr Polly\" by H. G. Wells, who describes it as \"one of the three townships that are grouped around the Port Burdock naval dockyards\". The resort is also the setting of the graphic novel \"The Tragical Comedy or Comical Tragedy of Mr. Punch\" by high fantasy author Neil Gaiman, who grew up in Portsmouth. A Southsea street was renamed The Ocean at the End of the Lane by the city council in honour of Gaiman's novel of the same name.\nCrime novels set in Portsmouth and the surrounding area include Graham Hurley's D.I.Faraday/D.C.Winter novels and C. J. Sansom's Tudor crime novel, \"Heartstone\"; the latter refers to the warship \"Mary Rose\" and describes Tudor life in the town. \"Portsmouth Fairy Tales for Grown Ups\", a collection of short stories, was published in 2014. The collection, set around Portsmouth, includes stories by crime novelists William Sutton and Diana Bretherick.\nEducation.\nThe University of Portsmouth was founded in 1992 as a new university from Portsmouth Polytechnic; in 2016, it had 20,000 students. The university was ranked among the world's top 100 modern universities in April 2015. In 2013, it had about 23,000 students and over 2,500 staff members. Several local colleges also award Higher National Diplomas, including Highbury College (specialising in vocational education), and Portsmouth College (which offers academic courses). Admiral Lord Nelson School and Miltoncross Academy were built in the late 1990s to meet the needs of a growing school-age population.\nAfter the cancellation of the national building programme for schools, redevelopment halted. Two schools in the city were judged \"inadequate\", and 29 of its 63 schools were considered \"no longer good enough\" by Ofsted in 2009. Before it was taken over by Ark Schools and became Ark Charter Academy, StLuke's Church of England secondary school was one of England's worst schools in GCSE achievement. It was criticised by officials for its behavioural standards, with students reportedly throwing chairs at teachers. Since it became an academy in 2009, the school has improved; 69 per cent of its students achieved five GCSEs with grades of A* to C, including English and mathematics. The academy's intake policy is for a standard comprehensive school, drawing from the community rather than by religion.\nPortsmouth Grammar School, the city's oldest independent school, was founded in 1732. Other independent schools include Portsmouth High School, and Mayville High School (founded in 1897).\nLandmarks.\nMany of Portsmouth's former defences are now museums or event venues. Several Victorian-era forts on Portsdown Hill are tourist attractions; Fort Nelson, at its summit, is home to the Royal Armouries museum. Tudor-era Southsea Castle has a small museum, and much of the seafront defences leading to the Round Tower are open to the public. The castle was withdrawn from active service in 1960, and was purchased by Portsmouth City Council. The southern part of the Royal Marines' Eastney Barracks is now the Royal Marines Museum, and was opened to the public under the National Heritage Act 1983. The museum received a \u00a314\u00a0million grant from the National Lottery Fund, and was scheduled to relocate to Portsmouth Historic Dockyard in 2019. The birthplace of Charles Dickens, at Mile End Terrace, is the Charles Dickens' Birthplace Museum; the four-storey red brick building became a GradeI listed building in 1953. Other tourist attractions include the Blue Reef Aquarium (with an \"underwater safari\" of British aquatic life) and the Cumberland House Natural History Museum, housing a variety of local wildlife.\nMost of the city's landmarks and tourist attractions are related to its naval history. They include the D-Day Story in Southsea, which contains the Overlord Embroidery. Portsmouth is home to several well-known ships; Horatio Nelson's flagship , the world's oldest naval ship still in commission, is in the dry dock of Portsmouth Historic Dockyard. The \"Victory\" was placed in a permanent dry dock in 1922 when the Society for Nautical Research led a national appeal to restore her, and 22million people have visited the ship. The remains of Henry VIII's flagship, \"Mary Rose\", was rediscovered on the seabed in 1971. She was raised and brought to a purpose-built structure in Portsmouth Historic Dockyard in 1982. Britain's first iron-hulled warship, , was restored and moved to Portsmouth in June 1987 after serving as an oil fuel pier at Pembroke Dock in Pembrokeshire for fifty years. The National Museum of the Royal Navy, in the dockyard, is sponsored by a charity that promotes research into the Royal Dockyard's history and archaeology. The dockyard hosts the Victorian Festival of Christmas, featuring Father Christmas in a traditional green robe, each November.\nPortsmouth's long association with the armed forces is demonstrated by a large number of war memorials, including several at the Royal Marines Museum and a large collection of memorials related to the Royal Navy in Victoria Park. The Portsmouth Naval Memorial, in Southsea Common, commemorates the 24,591 British sailors who died during both World Wars and have no known grave. Designed by Sir Robert Lorimer, it was unveiled by George VI (then Duke of York) on 15 October 1924. In the city centre, the Guildhall Square Cenotaph contains the names of the fallen and is guarded by stone sculptures of machine gunners by Charles Sargeant Jagger. The west face of the memorial reads:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;This memorial was erected by the people of Portsmouth in proud and loving memory of those who in the glorious morning of their days for England's sake lost all but England's praise. May light perpetual shine upon them.\nThe city has three cemeteries: Kingston, Milton Road, and Highland Road. Kingston Cemetery, opened in 1856, is in east Fratton. At , it is Portsmouth's largest cemetery and has about 400 burials a year. In February 2014, a ceremony celebrating the 180th anniversary of Portsmouth's Polish community was held at the cemetery. The approximately Milton Road Cemetery, founded on 8 April 1912, has about 200 burials per year. There is a crematorium in Portchester.\nGunwharf Quays.\nThe naval shore establishment contained the Royal Navy's arsenal; weapons and ammunition which would be taken from ships at its 'Gun Wharf' as they entered the harbour, and resupplied when they headed back to sea. The 1919 \"Southsea and Portsmouth Official Guide\" described the establishment as \"the finest collections of weapons outside the Tower of London, containing more than 25,000 rifles\". During the early nineteenth century, the 'Gunwharf' supplied the fleet with a \"grand arsenal\" of cannons, mortars, bombs, and ordnance. Although gunpowder was not provided due to safety concerns, it could be obtained at Priddy's Hard (near Gosport). An armoury sold small arms to soldiers, and the stone frigate also had blacksmith and carpenter shops for armourers. It was run by three officers: a \"viz\" (storekeeper), a clerk, and a foreman. By 1817, Gunwharf reportedly employed 5,000 men and housed the world's largest naval arsenal.\nHMS \"Vernon\" was closed on 1 April 1996 and was redeveloped by Portsmouth City Council as Gunwharf Quays, a mixed residential and retail site with outlet stores, restaurants, pubs, caf\u00e9s and a cinema. Construction of the Spinnaker Tower began in 2001, and was completed in the summer of 2005. The project exceeded its budget and cost \u00a336million, of which Portsmouth City Council contributed \u00a311\u00a0million. The tower is visible at a distance of in clear weather, and its viewing platforms overlook the Solent (towards the Isle of Wight), the harbour and Southsea Castle. The tower weighs over .and has the largest glass floor in Europe.\nSouthsea.\nSouthsea is a seaside resort and residential area of Portsmouth located at the southern end of Portsea Island. Its name originates from Southsea Castle, a seafront castle built in 1544 by HenryVIII to help defend the Solent and Portsmouth Harbour. The area was developed in 1809 as Croxton Town; by the 1860s, the suburb of Southsea had expanded to provide working-class housing. Southsea developed as a seaside and bathing resort. A pump room and baths were built near the present-day Clarence Pier, and a complex was developed which included vapour baths, showers, and card-playing and assembly rooms for holiday-goers.\nClarence Pier, opened in 1861 by the Prince and Princess of Wales, was named after Portsmouth military governor Lord Frederick FitzClarence and was described as \"one of the largest amusement parks on the south coast\". South Parade Pier was built in 1878, and is among the United Kingdom's 55 remaining private piers. Originally a terminal for ferries travelling to the Isle of Wight, it was soon redeveloped as an entertainment centre. The pier was rebuilt after fires in 1904, 1967 and 1974 (during the filming of \"Tommy\"). Plans were announced in 2015 for a Solent Eye at Clarence Pier: a \u00a3750,000, 24-gondola Ferris wheel similar to the London Eye.\nSouthsea is dominated by Southsea Common, a grassland created by draining the marshland next to the vapour baths in 1820. The common met the demands of the early-19th-century military for a clear firing range, and parallels the shore from Clarence Pier to Southsea Castle. A popular recreation area, it hosts a number of annual events which include carnivals, Christmas markets, and Victorian festivals. The common has a large collection of mature elm trees, believed to be the oldest and largest surviving in Hampshire and which have escaped Dutch elm disease due to their isolation. Other plants include the Canary Island date palms (\"Phoenix canariensis\"), some of Britain's largest, which have recently produced viable seed.\nSouthsea is often mistaken as a town separate from Portsmouth, mainly due to the confusing Portsmouth &amp; Southsea railway station name. The resort of Southsea previously had its own dedicated light railway line; the Southsea Railway and its own terminus, East Southsea railway station. The Southsea Railway and station were closed in 1914, with the station's name merged into that of Portsmouth's main railway station name in 1925.\nReligion.\nPortsmouth has two cathedrals: the Anglican Cathedral of St Thomas in Old Portsmouth and the Roman Catholic Cathedral of St John the Evangelist. The city is one of 34 British settlements with a Roman Catholic cathedral. Portsmouth's first chapel, dedicated to Thomas Becket, was built by Jean deGisors in the second half of the 12th century. It was rebuilt and developed into a parish church and an Anglican cathedral. Damaged during the 1642 Siege of Portsmouth, its tower and nave were rebuilt after the Restoration. Significant changes were made when the Diocese of Portsmouth was founded in 1927. It became a cathedral in 1932 and was enlarged, although construction was halted during the Second World War. The cathedral was re-consecrated before Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother in 1991.\nThe Royal Garrison Church was founded in 1212 by Peter des Roches, Bishop of Winchester. After centuries of decay, it became an ammunition store in 1540. The 1662 marriage of CharlesII and Catherine of Braganza was celebrated in the church, and large receptions were held there after the defeat of Napoleon at the 1813 Battle of Leipzig. In 1941, a firebomb fell on its roof and destroyed the nave. Although the church's chancel was saved by servicemen shortly after the raid, replacing the roof was deemed impossible due to the large amounts of salt solution absorbed by the stonework.\nThe Cathedral of St John the Evangelist was built in 1882 to accommodate Portsmouth's increasing Roman Catholic population, and replaced a chapel built in 1796 to the west. Before 1791, Roman Catholic chapels in towns with borough status were prohibited. The chapel opened after the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1791 was passed, and was replaced by the cathedral. It was constructed in phases; the nave was completed in 1882; the crossing in 1886, and the chancel by 1893. During the blitz, the cathedral was badly damaged when Luftwaffe bombing destroyed Bishop's House next door; it was restored in 1970, 1982, and 2001. The Roman Catholic Diocese of Portsmouth was founded in 1882 by Pope Leo XIII. Smaller places of worship in the city include StJude's Church in Southsea, StMary's Church in Portsea, StAnn's Chapel in the naval base and the Portsmouth and Southsea Synagogue, one of Britain's oldest. Other places of worship include the Immanuel Baptist Church, Southsea; Trinity Methodist Church, Highland Road; Buckland United Reformed Church; The Oasis Centre Elim Penteostal Church; Jubilee Pentecostal Church, Somers Road; Kings Church Assemblies of God (St Peter's Somers Road); Family Church; Christ Central Church, John Pounds Centre; The Jami Mosque, Bradford Junction; The Sikh Gurudwara, Margate Road.\nSport.\nPortsmouth F.C. play their home games at Fratton Park. They have won two Football League titles (1949 and 1950), and won the FA Cup in 1939 and 2008. The club returned to the Premier League in 2003. They were relegated to the Championship in 2010 and, experiencing serious financial difficulties in February 2012, were relegated again to League One. The club was relegated the following year to League Two, the fourth tier of English football. PortsmouthF.C. was purchased in April 2013 by the Pompey Supporters Trust, becoming the largest fan-owned club in English Football history. In May 2017, as League Two champions, they were promoted to League One for the 2017\u201318 season. They won promotion back to the Championship as Champions of League One in May 2024.\nMoneyfields F.C. have played in the Wessex Football League Premier Division since 1998. United Services Portsmouth F.C. (formerly known as Portsmouth Royal Navy) and Baffins Milton Rovers F.C. compete in Wessex League Division One; United Services was founded in 1962, and Baffins Milton Rovers in 2011. The rugby teams United Services Portsmouth RFC and Royal Navy Rugby Union play their home matches at the United Services Recreation Ground. Royal Navy Rugby Union play in the annual Army Navy Match at Twickenham.\nPortsmouth began hosting first-class cricket at the United Services Recreation Ground in 1882, and Hampshire County Cricket Club matches were played there from 1895 to 2000. In 2000, Hampshire moved their home matches to the new Rose Bowl cricket ground in West End. Portsmouth is home to two hockey clubs: Portsmouth Hockey Club, based at the Admiral Lord Nelson School and United Services Portsmouth Hockey Club, based on Burnaby Road. Great Salterns Golf Club, established in 1926, is an 18-hole parkland course with two holes played across a lake; there are coastal courses at Hayling and the Gosport and Stokes Bay Golf Club. Boxing was a popular sport between 1910 and 1960, and a monument commemorating the city's boxing heritage was built in 2017.\nTransport.\nRoads.\nIn March 2008, Portsmouth City Council became the first local authority in the UK to implement city-wide 20 miles per hour speed limit zones.\nFerries.\nPortsmouth Harbour has passenger-ferry links to Gosport and the Isle of Wight, with car-ferry service to the Isle of Wight nearby. Hovertravel, Britain's longest-standing commercial hovercraft service, begun in the 1960s, runs from near Clarence Pier in Southsea to Ryde, Isle of Wight. Portsmouth International Port has links to Caen, Cherbourg-Octeville, St Malo and Le Havre in France, Santander and Bilbao in Spain, and the Channel Islands. Ferry services from the port are operated by Brittany Ferries and DFDS Seaways.\nOn 18 May 2006, Trasmediterranea began service to Bilbao in competition with P&amp;O's service. Its ferry, \"Fortuny\", was detained in Portsmouth by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency for a number of safety violations. They were quickly corrected and the service was cleared for passengers on 23 May that year. Trasmediterr\u00e1nea discontinued its Bilbao service in March 2007, citing a need to deploy the \"Fortuny\" elsewhere. P&amp;O Ferries ended their service to Bilbao on 27 September 2010 due to \"unsustainable losses\". The second-busiest ferry port in the UK (after Dover), Portsmouth handles about three million passengers per year.\nBuses.\nLocal bus services are provided by Stagecoach South and First Hampshire &amp; Dorset to the city and its surrounding towns. Hovertravel and First Hampshire &amp; Dorset operate a Hoverbus service from the city centre to Southsea Hovercraft Terminal and the Hard Interchange, near the seafront. National Express service from Portsmouth operates primarily from the Hard Interchange to Victoria Coach Station, Cornwall, Bradford, Birkenhead and Bristol.\nRailways.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Routemap/styles.css\"/&gt;\nPortsmouth has four railway stations on Portsea Island: Hilsea, Fratton, Portsmouth &amp; Southsea and Portsmouth Harbour, with a fifth station at Cosham in the northern mainland suburb of Cosham, Portsmouth. Portsmouth previously had additional stations at Southsea, Farlington and Paulsgrove, but these were closed at various periods of the twentieth century.\nThe city of Portsmouth is on two direct South Western Railway routes to London Waterloo, via Guildford and via Basingstoke. There is a South Western Railway stopping service to Southampton Central and Great Western Railway service to Cardiff Central via Southampton, Salisbury, Bath Spa and Bristol. Southern has service to Brighton, Gatwick Airport, Croydon and London Victoria.\nClosed stations.\nSouthsea once had its own branch line, the Southsea Railway, which opened in 1885 between Southsea railway station and Fratton; it was closed in 1914 due to competition from tram services.\nFarlington Halt railway station was built to serve Portsmouth Park racecourse, opening as Farlington Race Course on 26 June 1891. The racecourse was closed during World War One, but the station was retained to serve the ammunition dump put in its place. The station closed in 1917. Re-opened in 1922 until 1927. Under the Southern Railway, it re-opened as a general public halt in 1928 named \"Farlington Halt\"; however, this was short-lived as the station closed due to insufficient customers on 4 July 1937.\nPaulsgrove Halt railway station was a railway station opened in 1928 to serve the adjacent Portsmouth Racecourse, a pony racing stronghold. The station was formerly located between Cosham and Portchester stations. Paulsgrove Halt was closed along with the racecourse when the land was acquired by the military in 1939, at the outbreak of World War II.\nAir.\nPortsmouth Airport, with a grass runway, was in operation from 1932 to 1973. After it closed, housing (Anchorage Park) and industry were built on the site. The nearest airport is Southampton Airport in the Borough of Eastleigh, away. It has a South Western Railway rail connection, requiring a change at Southampton Central or Eastleigh. Heathrow and Gatwick are and away, respectively. Gatwick is linked by Southern train service to London Victoria station and Heathrow is linked by coach to Woking, which is on both rail lines to London Waterloo and the London Underground. Heathrow is linked to Portsmouth by National Express coaches.\nFormer canal.\nThe Portsmouth and Arundel Canal ran between the towns and was built in 1823 by the Portsmouth &amp; Arundel Navigation Company. Never financially successful, and found to be contaminating Portsea Island fresh water wells, it was abandoned in 1855 and the company was wound up in 1888. The canal was part of a larger scheme for a secure inland canal route from London to Portsmouth, allowing boats to avoid the English Channel. It had three sections: a pair of ship canals (one on Portsea Island and one to Chichester) and a barge canal from Ford on the River Arun to Hunston, where it joined the canal's Chichester section.\nThe route through Portsea Island began from a basin formerly located on Arundel Street and cut through Landport, Fratton and Milton, ending at the eastern end of Locksway Road in Milton (where a set of lock gates accessed Langstone and Chichester Harbours. After the island route was closed, the drained canal-bed sections through Landport and Fratton were reused for the Portsmouth Direct line, or filled-in to surface level to form a new main road route to Milton, named Goldsmith Avenue.\nThe brick-lined canal walls are clearly visible between the Fratton and Portsmouth &amp; Southsea railway stations. The canal lock entrance at Locksway Road in Milton is east of the Thatched House pub.\nFuture plans.\nA new public transport structure was once under discussion, including monorails and light rail. Although a light-rail link to Gosport was authorised in 2002 (with completion expected to be in 2005), the project was in jeopardy as the Department for Transport refused to fund it in November 2005. In April 2011, \"The News\" reported a scheme to replace conventional rail lines to Southampton via Fareham, Bursledon and Sholing with light rail.\nMedia.\nPortsmouth, Southampton and their adjacent towns are served primarily by programming from the Rowridge and Chillerton Down transmitters on the Isle of Wight, although the transmitter at Midhurst can substitute for Rowridge. Portsmouth was one of the first cities in the UK to have a local TV station (MyTV), although the Isle of Wight began local television broadcasting in 1998. In November 2014, That's Solent was introduced as part of a nationwide roll-out of local Freeview channels in south-central England. The stations broadcast from Rowridge.\nBBC local radio station that broadcast to the city is BBC Radio Solent on 96.1 FM. According to RAJAR, popular radio stations include regional Greatest Hits Radio South and Global Radio's Heart South and Capital South. Easy Radio South Coast broadcasts from Southampton to the city on 107.4\u00a0MHz, and the non-profit community station, Express FM, broadcasts on 93.7. Patients at Queen Alexandra Hospital (Portsmouth's primary hospital) receive local programming from Portsmouth Hospital Broadcasting, which began in 1951. When the first local commercial radio stations were licensed during the 1970s by the Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA), Radio Victory received the first licence and began broadcasting in 1975. In 1986, the IBA increased the Portsmouth licence to include Southampton and the Isle of Wight. The new licence went to Ocean Sound (later known as Ocean FM), with studios in Fareham; Ocean FM became Heart Hampshire. For the city's 800th birthday in 1994, VictoryFM broadcast for three 28-day periods over 18 months. It was purchased by TLRC, who relaunched the station in 2001 as the Quay; Portsmouth Football Club became a stakeholder in 2007, selling it in 2009.\nPortsmouth's daily newspaper is \"The News\", founded in 1873 and previously known as the \"Portsmouth Evening News\". \"The Journal\", a free weekly newspaper, is published by \"News\" publisher Johnston Press.\nNotable residents.\nPortsmouth has been home to a number of famed authors; Charles Dickens, whose works include \"A Christmas Carol\", \"Great Expectations\", \"Oliver Twist\" and \"A Tale of Two Cities\", was born there. Arthur Conan Doyle, author of the Sherlock Holmes stories, practised medicine in the city and played in goal for the amateur Portsmouth Association Football Club. Rudyard Kipling (poet and author of \"The Jungle Book\") and H. G. Wells, author of \"The War of the Worlds\" and \"The Time Machine\", lived in Portsmouth during the 1880s.

Fantasy author Neil Gaiman grew up in Purbrook and Southsea.\nIndustrial Revolution engineer Isambard Kingdom Brunel was born in Portsmouth. His father, Marc Isambard Brunel, worked for the Royal Navy and developed the world's first production line to mass-produce pulley blocks for ship rigging. James Callaghan, British prime minister from 1976 to 1979, was born and raised in Portsmouth. Son of a Protestant Northern Irish petty officer in the Royal Navy, Callaghan was the only person to hold all four Great Offices of State: foreign secretary, home secretary, chancellor and prime minister. John Pounds, the founder of ragged schools (which provided free education to working-class children), lived in Portsmouth and founded England's first ragged school there.\nComedian and actor Peter Sellers was born in Southsea, and Arnold Schwarzenegger briefly lived and trained in Portsmouth. Other actors who were born or lived in the city include \"EastEnders\" actresses Emma Barton and Lorraine Stanley, comedienne and singer Audrey Jeans, and Bollywood actress Geeta Basra.

{"id": "24208", "revid": "50567718", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24208", "title": "Parasailing", "text": "Aerial manned-kite sport\nParasailing, also known as parascending, is an activity where individuals are harnessed to a modified parachute canopy that is designed to ascend into the air when towed behind a motor vehicle on land, or a recreational boat over water. Commercial parasailing operations can be found worldwide, with customized powerboats that can accommodate numerous passenger observers and up to three airborne parasailors at a time, wearing specially designed Body Harness w/ Tow Bar and/or seated in a Customized Gondola.\nWhile parasailing is primarily enjoyed both as a recreational and commercial activity, it should not be confused with other similar sports such as paragliding, paraskiing, or parakiting. These activities are typically operated in different environments, such as open fields and mountain ranges.\nIn Europe, land-based parasailing has evolved into a competitive sport. In these competitions, the parasail is towed to a specific height behind a vehicle, and the driver and/or the parasailor releases the tow line to land in a specific target area. The first international competitions for land-based parasailing were held in the mid-1980s and have continued annually since then. These competitions have grown in both size and scope over the years, attracting more participants and spectators alike.\nTerminology.\nSpinnaker.\nSpinnaker is a recreational activity commonly mistaken as parasailing. Both allow people to ascend on the ocean by using wind force against a specially designed canopy. Parasailing includes ascending, while spinnaker allows a person to swing at the front of the tow vehicle (i.e. a boat).\nParachute.\nBoth parachutes and parasails can ascend and glide. The primary difference between them is that parasails are more stable and efficient during ascent mode when being towed aloft with minimum or zero steering control by the parasailor. The parachute is not efficient when towed and is primarily used for skydiving where the parachutist can fully control the direction. In descent mode, both are designed to slow the fall of a person at any given altitude.\nHistory.\nEarly years of Parakiting.\nThere is at least one somewhat credible early-19c indication of a person being towed through the air on a kite; the instance is mentioned in passing as having been witnessed by an old sailor telling of it on the 1839-1841 cruise of the USS\u00a0\"Constitution\".\nEarly years of Parasailing.\nThe first ascending-gliding parachute was developed by Pierre-Marcel Lemoigne in 1962. The same year, Lemoigne established an Aeronautical Training Center to introduce his new ascending-gliding parachute as a training tool for parachutists. The technique allows parachutists to train more efficiently by towing the parachutist to a suitable altitude, then releasing them to practice landings. This training method proved cheaper than\u2014and just as effective as\u2014an airplane. In 1963, Jacques-Andr\u00e9 Istel from Pioneer Parachute Company bought a license from Lemoigne to manufacture and sell the 24-gore ascending-gliding parachute which was trade-named \"parasail.\"\nCommercial Parasailing Equipment Inventions.\nIn 1974, Mark McCulloh invented the first self-contained parasail launch and recovery vessel that incorporated a hydraulic winch and canopy assist mast that collectively launched and retrieved the parasail canopy and parasailors to and from the vessel flight deck. McCulloh's invention was patented in 1976 and later referred to as a \"WINCHBOAT\" which set the first parasail equipment industry standard that is utilized by all commercial parasail operations around the world.\nIn 1976, Brian Gaskin designed, created, and tested the first 16-gore canopy design which he named \"Waterbird\". The Waterbird was revolutionary in its canopy design, its unique tow yoke harness arrangement, its construction, and the use of zero porosity fabrics which allowed it to be used over water safely. The majority of commercial parasail operators then moved to the 16-gore canopy arrangement.\nIn 1981 Marcel and Azby Chouteau of Westport, Connecticut, designed and built a pontoon-based craft with a fan-shaped back deck and a winch in the front and ran a commercial parasailing operation using their original technology. The company, Old Mill Airlines, offered flights on Long Island Sound during the summer of 1981.\nCommercial Parasailing Weather Standards.\nIn April 2013, the ASTM established the first parasail weather standards for commercial parasailing operations.\nImproved Parasail Canopy Designs.\nIn recent years, operators have moved from small (20-foot range) parachutes to large (30\u201340 feet) parachutes with high-lift, low-drag designs, enabling operators to fly heavier payloads in lower (typically safer) winds. Most operators now offer double and triple flights using an adjustable side-by-side bar arrangement. The side-by-side aluminum bar is attached to the yoke of the chute, allowing two or three passenger harnesses to be attached side by side.\nRegulations.\nIn 2014, the National Transportation Safety Board issued a press release in which it found the parasailing industry to be largely unregulated. The report identified a number of safety concerns which included vessel operators who continued to operate despite hazardous wind conditions, use of inadequate equipment and unserviceable gear, and compromised strength of rope tied to the parasail. In a period from 1998 to the third of July 2013, there were six parasailing fatalities in the Florida area. The great majority of deaths in parasail incidents have occurred when riders were unable to get out of their harness support system after an unplanned landing in water during high winds.\nPrior to the release of the NTSB report, Florida passed the White-Miskell Act which added strict regulations parasailing companies must follow including obtaining an insurance policy, and restrictions on parasailing in inclement weather.\nParasailing associations.\nThe leading trade associations for parasailing are:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "24209", "revid": "940017", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24209", "title": "Profanity", "text": "Socially offensive form of language\nProfanity, also known as swearing, cursing, or cussing, is the usage of notionally offensive words for a variety of purposes, including to demonstrate disrespect or negativity, to relieve pain, to express a strong emotion (such as anger, excitement, or surprise), as a grammatical intensifier or emphasis, or to express informality or conversational intimacy. In many formal or polite social situations, it is considered impolite (a violation of social norms), and in some religious groups it is considered a sin. Profanity includes slurs, but most profanities are not slurs, and there are many insults that do not use swear words.\nSwear words can be discussed or even sometimes used for the same purpose without causing offense or being considered impolite if they are obscured (e.g. \"fuck\" becomes \"f***\" or \"the f-word\") or substituted with a minced oath like \"flip\".\nEtymology and definitions.\nProfanity may be described as offensive language, dirty words, or taboo words, among other descriptors. The term \"profane\" originates from classical Latin , literally 'before (outside) the temple', meaning 'outside' and meaning 'temple, sanctuary'. This further developed in Middle English with the meaning \"to desecrate a temple\". In English, \"swearing\" is a catch-all linguistic term for the use of profanities, even if it does not involve taking an oath. The only other languages that use the same term for both profanities and oaths are French (), Canadian French (), and Swedish ().\nEnglish uses \"cursing\" in a similar manner to \"swearing\", especially in the United States. Cursing originally referred specifically to the use of language to cast a curse on someone, and in American English it is still commonly associated with wishing harm on another. Equivalents to \"cursing\" are used similarly in Danish (), Italian (), and Norwegian (). The terms \"swearing\" and \"cursing\" have strong associations with the use of profanity in anger. Various efforts have been made to classify different types of profanity, but there is no widely accepted typology and terms are used interchangeably.\n\"Blasphemy\" and \"obscenity\" are used similarly to \"profanity\", though \"blasphemy\" has retained its religious connotation. \"Expletive\" is another English term for the use of profanity, derived from its original meaning of adding words to change a sentence's length without changing its meaning. The use of \"expletive\" sometimes refers specifically to profanity as an interjection. \"Epithet\" is used to describe profanities directed at a specific person. Some languages do not have a general term for the use of profanities, instead describing it with the phrase \"using bad language\". These include Mandarin (), Portuguese (), Spanish (), and Turkish (). Colloquial English terms include \"potty-mouth\", defined by the \"OED\" as \"A tendency to be foul-mouthed; (also) a foul-mouthed person\".\nHistory and study.\nHistorical profanity is difficult to reconstruct, as written records may not reflect spoken language. Despite being relatively well known compared to other linguistic mechanisms, profanity has historically been understudied because of its taboo nature. Profanity may be studied as an aspect of linguistics and sociology, or it can be a psychological and neurological subject. Besides interpersonal communication, understanding of profanity has legal implications and is related to theories of language learning.\nIn modern European languages, swearing developed from early Christianity, primarily through restrictions on taking God's name in vain in the Old Testament. Invocations of God were seen as attempts to call upon his power, willing something to be true or leveling a curse. Other mentions of God were seen as placing oneself over him, with the person uttering a name implying power over the name's owner.\nModern study of profanity as its own subject of inquiry had started by 1901. Sigmund Freud influenced study of the topic by positing that swearing reflects the subconscious, including feelings of aggression, antisocial inclinations, and the broaching of taboos. Significant activity began in the 1960s with writings on the subject by Ashley Montagu and Edward Sagarin, followed by increased study the following decade. Specific types of discriminatory profanity, such as ethnophaulism and homophobia, came to be described as part of a broader type of profanity, hate speech, toward the end of the 20th century. Another increase in the study of profanity took place with the onset of the 21st century.\nSubjects.\nProfanities have literal meanings, but they are invoked to indicate a state of mind, making them dependent almost entirely on connotation and emotional associations with the word, as opposed to literal denotation. The connotative function of profanity allows the denotative meaning to shift more easily, causing the word to shift until its meaning is unrelated to its origin or to lose meaning and impact altogether.\nLiteral meanings in modern profanity typically relate to religion, sex, or the human body, which creates a dichotomy between the use of highbrow religious swears and lowbrow anatomical swears. Languages and cultures place different emphasis on the subjects of profanity. Anatomical profanity is common in Polish, for example, while swearing in Dutch is more commonly in reference to disease. Words for excrement and for the buttocks have profane variants across most cultures. Though religious swears were historically more severe, modern society across much of the world has come to see sexual and anatomical swears to be more vulgar. Common profane phrases sometimes incorporate more than one category of profanity for increased effect. The Spanish phrase (transl.\u2009I shit on God and on the prostitute Virgin) invokes scatological, religious, and sexual profanity. Other swear words do not refer to any subject, such as the English word \"bloody\" when used in its profane sense.\nNot all taboo words are used in swearing, with many only being used in a literal sense. Clinical or academic terminology for bodily functions and sexual activity are distinct from profanity. This includes words such as \"excrement\" and \"copulate\" in English, which are not typically invoked as swears. Academics who study profanity disagree on whether literal use of a vulgar word can constitute a swear word. Conversely, words with greater connotative senses are not always used profanely. \"Bastard\" and \"son of a bitch\" are more readily used as general terms of abuse in English compared to \"terrorist\" and \"rapist\", despite the latter two being terms being associated with strongly immoral behavior.\nSome profane phrases are used metaphorically in a way that still retains elements of the original meaning, such as the English phrases \"all hell broke loose\" or \"shit happens\", which carry the negative associations of \"hell\" and \"shit\" as undesirable places and things. Others are nonsensical when interpreted literally, like \"take a flying fuck\" in English as well as (\"whore of shit\") in French and (\"the sow of Madonna\") in Italian.\nReligion.\nA distinction is sometimes made between religious profanity, which is casual, and blasphemy, which is intentionally leveled against a religious concept. It was commonly believed among early civilizations that speaking about certain things can invoke them or bring about curses. Many cultures have taboos about speaking the names of evil creatures such as Satan because of these historical fears.\nReligions commonly develop derogatory words for those who are not among their members. Medieval Christianity developed terms like \"heathen\" and \"infidel\" to describe outsiders. Secularization in the Western world has seen exclamations such as \"God!\" divorced from their religious connotations. Religious profanity is not inherent to all languages, being absent from Japanese, indigenous languages of the Americas, and most Polynesian languages.\nEuropean languages historically used the crucifixion of Jesus as a focal point for profane interjections. Phrases meaning \"death of God\" were used in languages like English (\"'Sdeath\"), French (), and Swedish () Christian profanity encompasses both appeals to the divine, such as God or heaven, and to the diabolic, such as the Devil or hell. While the impact of religious swearing has declined in the Christian world, diabolic swearing remains profane in Germany and the Nordic countries. Islamic profanity lacks a diabolic element, referring only to divine concepts like Muhammad or holy places.\nWords related to Catholicism, known as , are used in Quebec French profanity, and are considered to be stronger than other profane words in French. Examples of considered profane in Quebec are (tabernacle), (host), and (sacrament). When used as profanities, are often interchangeable.\nThe Book of Leviticus indicates that blasphemous language warrants death, while the Gospel of Matthew implies condemnation of all swearing, though only the Quakers have imposed such a ban. Islam, Judaism, and Brahmanism forbid mention of God's name entirely. In some countries, profanity words often have pagan roots that after Christian influence were turned from names of deities and spirits to profanity and used as such, like in Finnish, which was believed to be an original name of the thunder god Ukko, the chief god of the Finnish pagan pantheon.\nAnatomy and sexuality.\nProfanity related to sexual activity, including insults related to genitals, exists across cultures. The specific aspects invoked are sensitive to a given culture, with differences in how much they emphasize ideas like incest or adultery. Certain types of sex acts, such as oral sex, anal sex, or masturbation, may receive particular attention. Verbs describing sexual activity are frequently profane, like \"fuck\" in English, in French, in Italian, in Spanish, and (\"yebat\u02c8\") in Russian. Words describing a person as one who masturbates are often used as terms of abuse, such as the English use of \"jerk-off\" and \"wanker\". Terms for sexually promiscuous women can be used as profanity, such English terms like \"hussy\" and \"slut\". Reference to prostitution brings its own set of profanities. Many profane words exist to refer to a prostitute, such as \"whore\" in English, in French, in Italian, in Polish, (\"blyat\"') in Russian, and in Spanish. Some languages, including German and Swedish, do not see significant use of sexual terms as profanity.\nProfanities for the penis and vulva are often used as interjections. Penile interjections are often used in Italian (), Russian (, \"khuy\"), and Spanish (). Vulvar interjections are often used in Dutch (), Hungarian (), Russian (, \"pizda\"), Spanish (), and Swedish (). Such terms, especially those relating to the vulva, may also be used as terms of abuse. Profanities related to testicles are less common and their function varies across languages. They may be used as interjections, such as in English (\"balls\" or \"bollocks\"), Italian (), and Spanish (). Danish uses testicles as a term of abuse with .\nWords for the buttocks are used as a term of disapproval in many languages, including English (\"ass\" or \"arse\"), French (), Polish (), Russian (, \"zhopa\"), and Spanish (). Similar words for the anus appear in languages like Danish (), English (\"asshole\" or \"arsehole\"), German (), Icelandic (), Norwegian (), and Polish (). Excrement and related concepts are commonly invoked in profanity. European examples include \"shit\" in English, in French, in German, and in Italian. An example in an East Asian language would be (\"kuso\") in Japanese.\nOther subjects.\nIllness has historically been used to swear by wishing a plague on others. The names of various diseases are used as profane words in some languages; \"Pokkers\" (transl.\u2009pox) appears in both Danish and Norwegian as an exclamation and an intensifier. Death is another common theme in Asian languages such as Cantonese. Terminology of mental illness has become more prominent as profanity in the Western world, with terms such as \"idiot\" and \"retard\" challenging one's mental competency.\nProfane phrases directed at the listener's mother exist across numerous major languages, though it is absent from Germanic languages with the exception of English. These phrases often include terms of abuse that implicate the subject's mother, such as \"son of a bitch\" in English or (transl.\u2009child of a cuckolded man) in Mandarin. Russian profanity places heavy emphasis on the sexual conduct of the listener's female relatives, either by describing sexual activity involving them or suggesting that the listener engage in activities with them. Aboriginal Australian languages sometimes invoke one's deceased ancestors in profanity.\nThe names of political ideologies are sometimes invoked as swear words by their opponents. \"Fascist\" is commonly used as an epithet in the modern era, replacing historical use of \"radical\". Far-left groups and anti-capitalist have historically used words like \"capitalist\" and \"imperialist\" as terms of abuse, while anti-communist speakers use \"communist\" in the same manner. The use of political terms in a profane sense often leads to the term becoming less impactful or losing relevance as a political descriptor entirely.\nWords for animals can be used as terms of abuse despite not being inherently profane, commonly referencing some attribute of the animal. Examples in English include \"bitch\" to demean a woman or \"louse\" to describe someone unwanted. They may also be used in interjections like the Italian (transl.\u2009pig of a God). Animal-related profanity is distinct from other forms in that it is used similarly across different languages. Terms for dogs are among the most common animal swears across languages, alongside those for cows, donkeys, and pigs. Swear words related to monkeys are common in Arabic and East Asian cultures.\nSlurs are words that target a specific demographic. These are used to project xenophobia and prejudice, often through the use of stereotypes. They typically develop in times of increased contact of conflict between different races or ethnic groups, including times of war between two or more nations. Terms for minority groups are sometimes used as swears. This can apply to both profane terms such as \"kike\" or non-profane terms such as \"gay\". Many of these are culture-specific. In a case of using the name of one group to demean another, Hun came to be associated with a brutish caricature of Germans, first during the Renaissance and again during World War I. Some terms for people of low class or status can become generically profane or derogatory. English examples include \"villain\", \"lewd\", and \"scum\".\nGrammar and function.\nProfanity is used to indicate the speaker's emotional state, and the negative associations of swear words mean they are often emotionally charged. Expressions of anger and frustration are the most common reason for swearing. Such expressions are associated with abusive profanity, which is the most negatively charged and is specifically chosen to insult or offend the subject. This may take the form of a direct insult, such as calling the subject an \"asshole\", or by addressing the subject profanely, such as telling someone to \"fuck off\". It can also be used to indicate contempt. Cathartic profanity is used as an expression of annoyance, and it is often considered less rude than profanity directed at a specific subject. Profanity can be used as a statement of agreement or disagreement, though disagreement is more common; \"the hell it is\" and \"my ass\" are examples of English profanities that indicate disagreement. The potent nature of swearing means that it can be used to gain attention, including the use of profanity to cause shock. In some circumstances, swearing can be used as a form of politeness, such as when a speaker gives positive reinforcement by describing something as \"pretty fucking good\".\nPropositional or controlled swearing is done consciously, and speakers choose their wording and how to express it. This is more common when using descriptive swearing. Non-propositional or reflexive swearing is done involuntarily as an emotional response to excitement or displeasure. Frequent swearing can become a habit, even if the speaker does not have a specific intention of being profane.\nProfanity is often used as a slot filler, which functions as a modifier, and modifying a noun with a swear is commonly used to indicate dislike. A profane word can modify words as an adjective, such as in \"it's a bloody miracle\", or as an adverb, such as in \"they drove damn fast\". One type of adverbial profanity is to use it as a modal adverb, such as in \"no you fucking can't\". Compound words can be created to create a new modifier, such as \"pisspoor\". Many European languages use profanity to add emphasis to question words in the form of \"who the hell are you?\" or with a preposition in the form of \"what in God's name is that?\". Modifier profanities are frequently used as an expletive attributive, or intensifiers that put emphasis on specific ideas. These commonly take the form of interjections to express strong emotion, such as the English examples \"bloody hell\" and \"for fuck's sake\". Such stand-alone profanities are among the most common in natural speech. Expletive infixation is the use of a profane word as an intensifier inside of another word, such as modifying \"absolutely\" to become \"abso-fucking-lutely\". Some languages use swear words that can generically replace nouns and verbs. This is most common in Russian.\nThough profanity exists in nearly all cultures, there is variation in when it is used and how it affects the meaning of speech. Each language has unique profane phrases influenced by culture. Japanese is sometimes described as having no swear words, though it has a concept of (transl.\u2009bad words) that are not based on taboos but are otherwise functionally equivalent to swears. One linguistic theory proposes that sound symbolism influences the pronunciation of profanities. This includes the suggestion that profanities are more likely to include plosives, but this remains unstudied, especially outside of Indo-European languages.\nThe use of profanity is the most common way to express taboo ideas. The dichotomy between its taboo nature and its prevalence in day-to-day life is studied as the \"swearing paradox\". It is used casually in some social settings, which can facilitate bonding and camaraderie, denote a social environment as informal, and mark the speaker as part of an in-group. The way speakers use profanity in social settings allows them to project their identity and personality through communication style, and in some circumstances it can be used as a method used to impress one's peers. Stylistic swearing is used to add emphasis or intensity to speech, which can be used to emphasize an idea in an aggressive or authoritative fashion, make an idea memorable, or produce a comedic effect.\nProfanity often presents as formulaic language, in which specific words can only be used in specific phrases, often developed through grammaticalization. Many of these phrases allow words to be swapped, presenting variations on a phrase like \"what in the bloody heck\", \"why in the flamin' hell\", and \"how in the fuckin' hell\". Profane phrases can be used as anaphoric pronouns, such as replacing \"him\" with \"the bastard\" in \"tell the bastard to mind his own business\". They can similarly be used to support a noun instead of replacing it, such as in \"John is a boring son of a bitch\". Though profanity is usually associated with taboo words, obscene non-verbal acts such as hand gestures may be considered profane. Spitting in someone's direction has historically been seen as a strong insult. Exposure of certain body parts, often the genitals or buttocks, is also seen as profane in many parts of the world.\nThough \"cursing\" often refers to the use of profanity in general, it can refer to more specific phrases of harm such as \"damn you\" or \"a pox on you\". Historically, people swore by or to the ideas that they were invoking, instead of swearing at something. Oaths in which the speaker swears by something, such as \"by God\", can be used as interjections or intensifiers, typically without religious connotation. This is especially common in Arabic. Self-immolating oaths, such as \"I'll be damned\", involve speakers casting harm upon themselves. These are often invoked as conditional statements based on whether something is true\u2014\"I'll be damned if...\" Profanity directed at an individual can take the form of an unfriendly suggestion. English examples include \"go to hell\" and \"kiss my ass\". Some profanities, such as \"your mother!\", imply taboos or swear words without using them explicitly.\nSocial perception.\nWhether speech is profane depends on context, because what is taboo or impolite in one environment might not be in another. Swear words vary in their intensity, and speakers of a language might disagree that weaker swear words are actually profane. Isolated profanities are often seen as more profane than those used in context.\nThe identity of the speaker affects how profanity is seen, as different cultures may hold classes, sexes, age groups, and other identities to different standards. Profanity is often seen as more socially acceptable when coming from men, and it is commonly associated with machismo. Profanity varies in how it affects a speaker's credibility. It can be seen as unprofessional in some circumstances, but it can make an argument more persuasive in others. Milder words can become more impactful in different circumstances; \"cheat\" may be more provocative in schools or gambling clubs, and \"informer\" replaces \"crook\" as a term of abuse for a dishonest person in a criminal setting. Profanity is often associated with lower class professions like soldiers and carters.\nExpectancy violations theory holds that expectations about a speaker's behavior come from impressions based not only on the speaker's identity, but how the specific speaker typically communicates and the socially expected way to speak to a given listener. Swearing in formal contexts is a greater violation of expectations than swearing in informal conversation. Whether the profanity is spoken in public or private is also a factor in social acceptability. Conversations that involve profanity are correlated with other informal manners of speech, such as slang, humor, and discussion of sexuality.\nNative speakers of a language can intuitively decide what language is appropriate for a given context. Those still learning a language, such as children and non-native speakers, are more likely to use profane language without realizing that it is profane. Acceptable environments for profanity are learned in childhood as children find themselves chastised for swearing in some places more than others. Swearing is often milder among young children, and they place more stigma on terms that are not seen as profane by adults, like \"fart\" or \"dork\". Young children are more likely to use the mildest terms as swear words, such as \"pooh-pooh\". Adolescents develop an understanding of double meanings in terms like \"balls\".\nThe severity of a swear word may decline over time as it is repeated. In some cases, slurs can be reclaimed by the targeted group when they are used ironically or in a positive context, such as \"queer\" to refer to the LGBTQ community. People who speak multiple languages often have stronger emotional associations with profanity in their native languages over that of languages that they acquire later. The severity of a profane term can vary between dialects within the same language. Publishers of dictionaries must take profanity into consideration when deciding what words to include, especially when they are subject to obscenity laws. They may be wary of appearing to endorse the use of profane language by its inclusion. Slang dictionaries have historically been used to cover profanity in lieu of more formal dictionaries.\nIn some cultures, there are situations where profanity is good etiquette. A tradition exists in some parts of China that a bride was expected to speak profanely to her groom's family in the days before the wedding, and one Aboriginal Australian culture uses profanity to denote class.\nCensorship and avoidance.\nThe idea of censoring taboo ideas exists in all cultures. Swearing inappropriately can be punished socially, and public swearing can bring about legal consequences. There is disagreement as to whether freedom of speech should permit all forms of profane speech, including hate speech, or if such forms of speech can be justifiably restricted. Censorship is used to restrict or penalize profanity, and governments may implement laws that disallow certain acts of profanity, including legal limitations on the broadcast of profanity over radio or television. Broadcasting has unique considerations as to what is considered acceptable, including its presence in the home and children's access to broadcasts.\nProfanity may be avoided when discussing taboo subjects through euphemisms. Euphemisms were historically used to avoid invoking the names of malevolent beings. Euphemisms are commonly expressed as metaphors, such as \"make love\" or \"sleep with\" as descriptors of sexual intercourse. Euphemisms can be alternate descriptors such as \"white meat\" instead of \"breast meat\", or they may be generic terms such as \"unmentionables\". Minced oaths are euphemisms that modify swear words until they are no longer profane, such as \"darn\" instead of \"damn\" in English.\nSubstitution is another form of euphemism, with English examples including the replacement of \"fuck\" with \"the f-word\" or \"effing\" and the use of \"four-letter words\" to refer to profanity in general. Chinese and some Southeast Asian languages use puns and sound-alikes to create alternate swear words. The Chinese word for bird, , rhymes with the Chinese word for penis and is frequently invoked as a swear. The Cockney dialect of English uses rhyming slang to alter terms, including profanity; \"titty\" is rhymed as \"Bristol city\", which is then abbreviated as \"bristols\".\nSpeakers and authors may engage in self-censorship under legal or social pressure. In the 21st century, censorship through social pressure is associated with political correctness in Western society. This has led to the intentional creation of new euphemisms to avoid terms that may be stigmatizing. Some become widely accepted, such as \"substance abuse\" for \"drug addiction\", while others are ignored or derided, such as \"differently abled\" for \"disabled\".\nPhysiology and neurology.\nThe brain processes profanity differently than it processes other forms of language. Intentional controlled swearing is associated with the brain's left hemisphere, while reflexive swearing is associated with the right hemisphere. Swearing is associated with both language-processing parts of the brain, the left frontal and temporal lobes, as well as the emotion-processing parts, the right cerebrum and the amygdala. The association of emotional swearing with the amygdala and other parts of the limbic system suggests that some uses of profanity are related to the fight-or-flight response.\nProfanity requires more mental processing than other forms of language, and the use of profanity is easier to remember when recalling a conversation or other speech. Exposure to profanity leads to higher levels of arousal, and it can cause increases in heart rate and electrodermal activity as part of a fight-or-flight response. Swearing has also been shown to increase pain tolerance, especially among people who do not regularly swear.\nCompulsive swearing is called coprolalia, and it is associated with neurological conditions such as Tourette syndrome, dementia, and epilepsy. The ability to use profanity can remain intact even when neurological trauma causes aphasia. Frequent swearing is more common among people with damage to the brain or other parts of the nervous system. Damage to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex can negatively affect one's ability to control their use of profanity and other socially inappropriate behaviors. Damage to Broca's area and other language-processing regions of the brain can similarly make people prone to outbursts. Damage to the right hemisphere limits the ability to understand and regulate the emotional content of one's speech.\nLegality.\nAustralia.\nIn every Australian state and territory it is a crime to use offensive, indecent or insulting language in or near a public place. These offences are classed as summary offences. This means that they are usually tried before a local or magistrates court. Police also have the power to issue fixed penalty notices to alleged offenders. It is a defence in some Australian jurisdictions to have \"a reasonable excuse\" to conduct oneself in the manner alleged.\nBrazil.\nIn Brazil, the Penal Code does not contain any penalties for profanity in public immediately. However, direct offenses against one can be considered a crime against honor, with a penalty of imprisonment of one to three months or a fine. The analysis of the offence is considered \"subjective\", depending on the context of the discussion and the relationship between the parts.\nCanada.\nSection 175 of Canada's Criminal Code makes it a criminal offence to \"cause a disturbance in or near a public place\" by \"swearing [...] or using insulting or obscene language\". Provinces and municipalities may also have their laws against swearing in public. For instance, the Municipal Code of Toronto bars \"profane or abusive language\" in public parks. In June 2016, a man in Halifax, Nova Scotia, was arrested for using profane language at a protest against Bill C-51.\nIndia.\nSections 294A and 294B of Indian penal code have legal provisions for punishing individuals who use inappropriate or obscene words (either spoken or written) in public that are maliciously deliberate to outrage religious feelings or beliefs. In February 2015, a local court in Mumbai asked police to file a first information report against 14 Bollywood celebrities who were part of the stage show of \"All India Bakchod\", a controversial comedy stage show known for vulgar and profanity based content. In May 2019 during the election campaign, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi listed out the abusive words the opposition Congress party had used against him and his mother during their campaign.\nIn January 2016, a Mumbai-based communications agency initiated a campaign against profanity and abusive language called \"Gaali free India\" ( is the Hindi word for profanity). Using creative ads, it called upon people to use swachh (clean) language on the lines of Swachh Bharat Mission for nationwide cleanliness. It further influenced other news media outlets who further raised the issue of abusive language in the society especially incest abuses against women, such as \"mother fucker\".\nIn an increasing market for OTT content, several Indian web series have been using profanity and expletives to gain attention of the audiences.\nNew Zealand.\nIn New Zealand, the \"Summary Offences Act 1981\" makes it illegal to use \"indecent or obscene words in or within hearing of any public place\". However, if the defendant has \"reasonable grounds for believing that his words would not be overheard\" then no offence is committed. Also, \"the court shall have regard to all the circumstances pertaining at the material time, including whether the defendant had reasonable grounds for believing that the person to whom the words were addressed, or any person by whom they might be overheard, would not be offended\".\nPakistan.\nPolitical leaders in Pakistan have been consistently picked up for using profane, abusive language. While there is no legislation to punish abusers, the problem aggravated with abusive language being used in the parliament and even against women.\nPhilippines.\nThe Department of Education in the Philippine city of Baguio expressed that while cursing was prohibited in schools, children were not following this prohibition at home. Thus as part of its anti profanity initiative, in November 2018, the Baguio city government in the Philippines passed an anti profanity law that prohibits cursing and profanity in areas of the city frequented by children. This move was welcomed by educators and the Department of Education in Cordillera.\nRussia.\nSwearing in public is an administrative crime in Russia. However, law enforcement rarely targets swearing people. The punishment is a fine of 500\u20131000 roubles or even a 15-day imprisonment.\nUnited Kingdom.\nIn public.\nSwearing, in and of itself, is not usually a criminal offence in the United Kingdom although in context may constitute a component of a crime. However, it may be a criminal offence in Salford Quays under a public spaces protection order which outlaws the use of \"foul and abusive language\" without specifying any further component to the offence, although it appears to be unclear as to whether all and every instance of swearing is covered. Salford City Council claims that the defence of \"reasonable excuse\" allows all the circumstances to be taken into account. In England and Wales, swearing in public where it is seen to cause harassment, alarm or distress may constitute an offence under section 5(1) and (6) of the Public Order Act 1986. In Scotland, a similar common law offence of breach of the peace covers issues causing public alarm and distress.\nIn the workplace.\nIn the United Kingdom, swearing in the workplace can be an act of gross misconduct under certain circumstances. In particular, this is the case when swearing accompanies insubordination against a superior or humiliation of a subordinate employee. However, in other cases, it may not be grounds for instant dismissal. According to a UK site on work etiquette, the \"fact that swearing is a part of everyday life means that we need to navigate away through a day in the office without offending anyone, while still appreciating that people do swear. Of course, there are different types of swearing and, without spelling it out, you really ought to avoid the 'worst words' regardless of who you're talking to\". Within the UK, the appropriateness of swearing can vary largely by a person's industry of employment, though it is still not typically used in situations where employees of a higher position than oneself are present.\nIn 2006, \"The Guardian\" reported that \"36% of the 308 UK senior managers and directors having responded to a survey accepted swearing as part of workplace culture\", but warned about specific inappropriate uses of swearing such as when it is discriminatory or part of bullying behaviour. The article ended with a quotation from Ben Wilmott (Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development): \"Employers can ensure professional language in the workplace by having a well-drafted policy on bullying and harassment that emphasises how bad language has potential to amount to harassment or bullying.\"\nUnited States.\nIn the United States, courts have generally ruled that the government does not have the right to prosecute someone solely for the use of an expletive, which would be a violation of their right to free speech enshrined in the First Amendment. On the other hand, they have upheld convictions of people who used profanity to incite riots, harass people, or disturb the peace. In 2011, a North Carolina statute that made it illegal to use \"indecent or profane language\" in a \"loud and boisterous manner\" within earshot of two or more people on any public road or highway was struck down as unconstitutional. In 2015, the city of Myrtle Beach, South Carolina passed an ordinance that makes profane language punishable with fines up to $500 and/or 30 days in jail. An amount of $22,000 was collected from these fines in 2017 alone.\nReligious views.\nJudaism.\nRabbi Yisroel Cotlar wrote in Chabad.org that Judaism forbids the use of profanity as contradicting the Torah's command to \"Be holy\", which revolves around the concept of separating oneself from worldly practices (including the use of vulgar language). The Talmud teaches that the words that leave the mouth make an impact on the heart and mind; he stated that the use of profanity thus causes the regression of the soul. Judaism thus teaches that \"shemirat halashon\" (guarding one's tongue) is one of the first steps to spiritual improvement.\nChristianity.\nVarious Christian writers have condemned the use of \"foul language\" as being sinful, a position held since the time of the early Church. To this end, the Bible commands including \"Don't use foul or abusive language. Let everything you say be good and helpful, so that your words will be an encouragement to those who hear them\" (Ephesians 4:29) and also \"Let there be no filthiness nor foolish talk nor crude joking, which are out of place, but instead let there be thanksgiving\" (Ephesians 5:4). These teachings are echoed in Ecclesiasticus 20:19, Ecclesiasticus 23:8-15, and Ecclesiasticus 17:13-15, all of which are found in the Deuterocanon/Apocrypha. Jesus taught that \"by your words you will be justified, and by your words you will be condemned.\" (cf. Matthew 12:36-37), with revilers being listed as being among the damned in 1 Corinthians 6:9-10. Profanity revolving around the dictum \"Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain\", one of the Ten Commandments, is regarded as blasphemy as Christians regard it as \"an affront to God's holiness\". Paul the Apostle defines the ridding of filthy language from one's lips as being evidence of living in a relationship with Jesus (cf. Colossians 3:1-10). The Epistle to the Colossians teaches that controlling the tongue \"is the key to gaining mastery over the whole body.\" The Didache 3:3 included the use of \"foul language\" as being part of the lifestyle that puts one on the way to eternal death. The same document commands believers not to use profanity as it \"breeds adultery\". John Chrysostom, an early Church Father, taught that those engaged in the use of profanity should repent of the sin. The Epistle of James holds that \"blessing God\" is the primary function of the Christian's tongue, not speaking foul language. Saint Tikhon of Zadonsk, a bishop of Eastern Orthodox Church, lambasted profanity and blasphemy, teaching that it is \"extremely unbefitting [for] Christians\" and that believers should guard themselves from ever using it.\nIslam.\nAccording to Ayatullah Ibrahim Amini, the use of \"bad words\" is haram in Islam. Additionally, impertinence and slander are considered immoral acts.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He is known for issuing the \"Decretales\" and instituting the Papal Inquisition, in response to the failures of the episcopal inquisitions established during the time of Pope Lucius III, by means of the papal bull \"Ad abolendam\", issued in 1184.\nHe worked initially as a cardinal, and after becoming the successor of Honorius III, he fully inherited the traditions of Gregory VII and of his own cousin Innocent III, and zealously continued their policy of papal supremacy.\nEarly life and education.\nUgolino (Hugh) was born in Anagni near Rome. The date of his birth varies in sources between c.\u20091145 and 1170. He is said to have been \"in his nineties, if not nearly one hundred years old\" at his death. He received his education at the Universities of Paris and Bologna.\nHe was created Cardinal-Deacon of the church of Sant'Eustachio by his cousin Innocent III in December 1198. In 1206 he was promoted to the rank of Cardinal Bishop of Ostia e Velletri. He became Dean of the Sacred College of Cardinals in 1218 or 1219. Upon the special request of Saint Francis, in 1220, Pope Honorius III appointed him Cardinal Protector of the order of the Franciscans.\nAs Cardinal Bishop of Ostia, he cultivated a wide range of acquaintances, among them the Queen of England, Isabella of Angoul\u00eame.\nPapacy.\nGregory IX was elevated to the papacy in the papal election of 1227. He took the name \"Gregory\" because he formally assumed the papal office at the monastery of Saint Gregory ad Septem Solia. That same year, in one of his earliest acts as pope, he expanded the Inquisition powers already assigned to Konrad von Marburg to encompass the investigation of heresy throughout the whole of Germany.\nGregory's bull \"Parens scientiarum\" of 1231, after the University of Paris strike of 1229, resolved differences between the unruly university scholars of Paris and the local authorities. His solution was in the manner of a true follower of Innocent III: he issued what in retrospect has been viewed as the \"magna carta\" of the university, assuming direct control by extending papal patronage: his bull allowed future suspension of lectures over a flexible range of provocations, from \"monstrous injury or offense\" to squabbles over \"the right to assess the rents of lodgings\".\nIn October 1232, after an investigation by legates, Gregory proclaimed a crusade against the Stedinger to be preached in northern Germany. In June 1233, he granted a plenary indulgence to those who took part.\nIn 1233, Gregory IX established the Papal Inquisition to regularize the prosecution of heresy. According to Thomas Madden, a defender of the Inquisition, the Papal Inquisition was intended to bring order to the haphazard episcopal inquisitions which had been established by Lucius III in 1184. Gregory's aim allegedly was to bring order and legality to the process of dealing with heresy, since there had been tendencies by mobs of townspeople to burn alleged heretics without much of a trial. In 1231 Pope Gregory IX appointed a number of Papal Inquisitors (\"Inquisitores haereticae pravitatis\"), mostly Dominicans and Franciscans, for the various regions of France, Italy and parts of Germany. Contrary to popular belief,says Madden, the aim was to introduce due process and objective investigation into the beliefs of those accused to the often erratic and unjust persecution of heresy on the part of local ecclesiastical and secular jurisdictions. However , to Walter Ullmann, \"there is hardly one item in the whole Inquisitorial procedure that could be squared with the demands of justice; on the contrary, every one of its items is the denial of justice or a hideous caricature of it [...] its principles are the very denial of the demands made by the most primitive concepts of natural justice [...] This kind of proceeding has no longer any semblance to a judicial trial but is rather its systematic and methodical perversion.\"\nGregory was a remarkably skillful and learned lawyer. He caused to be prepared \"Nova Compilatio decretalium\", which was promulgated in numerous copies in 1234 (first printed at Mainz in 1473). This \"New Compilation of Decretals\" was the culmination of a long process of systematising the mass of pronouncements that had accumulated since the Early Middle Ages, a process that had been under way since the first half of the 12th century and had come to fruition in the \"Decretum\", compiled and edited by the papally commissioned legist Gratian and published in 1140. The supplement completed the work, which provided the foundation for papal legal theory.\nIn the 1234 Decretals, he invested the doctrine of \"perpetua servitus iudaeorum\" \u2013 perpetual servitude of the Jews \u2013 with the force of canonical law. According to this, the followers of the Talmud would have to remain in a condition of political servitude until Judgment Day. The doctrine then found its way into the doctrine of \"servitus camerae imperialis\", or servitude immediately subject to the Emperor's authority, promulgated by Frederick II. The Jews were thus suppressed from having direct influence over the political process and the life of Christian states into the 19th century and the rise of liberalism. In 1234, Gregory issued the papal bull \"Rachel suum videns\" calling for a new crusade to the Holy Land, leading to the Crusade of 1239.\nIn 1239, under the influence of Nicholas Donin, a Jewish convert to Christianity, Gregory ordered that all copies of the Jewish Talmud be confiscated. Following a public disputation between Christians and Jewish theologians, this culminated in a mass burning of some 12,000 handwritten Talmudic manuscripts on 12 June 1242, in Paris.\nGregory was a supporter of the mendicant orders which he saw as an excellent means for counteracting by voluntary poverty the love of luxury and splendour which was possessing many ecclesiastics. He was a friend of Saint Dominic as well as Clare of Assisi. On 17 January 1235, he approved the Order of Our Lady of Mercy for the redemption of captives. He appointed ten cardinals and canonized Saints Elisabeth of Hungary, Dominic, Anthony of Padua, and Francis of Assisi, of whom he had been a personal friend and early patron. He transformed a chapel to Our Lady in the church of Santa Maria del Popolo in Rome.\nGregory IX endorsed the Northern Crusades and attempts to bring Orthodox Russians, particularly in the Pskov Republic and the Novgorod Republic, under the Papacy's fold. In 1229, he declared that \"Finlandia\" (Finland) had passed under his protection. In 1232, Gregory IX asked the Livonian Brothers of the Sword to send troops to protect Finland, whose semi-pagan people were fighting against the Novgorod Republic in the Finnish-Novgorodian wars; however, there is no known information if any ever arrived to assist. Gregory received news in 1237 that the Tavastians rejected Christianity and he called on all Christians to join him in a crusade.\nStruggle with Frederick II.\nAt the coronation of Frederick II in Rome, 22 November 1220, the emperor made a vow to embark for the Holy Land in August 1221. Gregory IX began his pontificate by suspending the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II, for dilatoriness in carrying out the promised Sixth Crusade. Frederick II appealed to the sovereigns of Europe complaining of his treatment. The suspension was followed by excommunication and threats of deposition, as deeper rifts appeared. Frederick II went to the Holy Land and in fact managed to take possession of Jerusalem. Gregory IX distrusted the emperor, since Rainald, the imperial Governor of Spoleto, had invaded the Pontifical States during the emperor's absence. In June 1229, Frederick II returned from the Holy Land, routed the papal army which Gregory IX had sent to invade Sicily, and made new overtures of peace to the pope. The war of 1228\u20131230 is known as the War of the Keys.\nGregory IX and Frederick came to a truce, but when Frederick defeated the Lombard League in 1239, the possibility that he might dominate all of Italy, surrounding the Papal States, became a very real threat. A new outbreak of hostilities led to a fresh excommunication of the emperor in 1239 and to a prolonged war. Gregory denounced Frederick II as a heretic and summoned a council at Rome to give point to his anathema. Frederick responded by trying to capture or sink as many ships carrying prelates to the synod as he could. Eberhard II von Truchsees, Prince-Archbishop of Salzburg, in 1241 at the Council of Regensburg declared that Gregory IX was \"that man of perdition, whom they call Antichrist, who in his extravagant boasting says, 'I am God, I cannot err'.\" He argued that the Pope was the \"little horn\" of Daniel 7:8:\nA little horn has grown up with eyes and mouth speaking great things, which is reducing three of these kingdoms \u2013 i.e. Sicily, Italy, and Germany \u2013 to subserviency, is persecuting the people of Christ and the saints of God with intolerable opposition, is confounding things human and divine, and is attempting things unutterable, execrable.\nThe struggle only ended with Gregory IX's death on 22 August 1241. The pope died before events could reach their climax; it was his successor, Innocent IV, who in 1245 declared a crusade that would finish the Hohenstaufen threat.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He lived during the reigns of the Roman emperors Elagabalus and Alexander Severus. Eusebius and the Liberian catalogue list his episcopate as having lasted five years (217\u2013222). In 217, when Callixtus followed Zephyrinus as Bishop of Rome, he started to admit into the Church converts from sects or schisms. He was killed for being Christian and is venerated as a saint and martyr by the Catholic Church (the patron saint of cemetery workers).\nLife.\nCallixtus I's contemporaries and enemies, Tertullian and Hippolytus of Rome, the author of \"Philosophumena\", relate that Callixtus, as a young slave from Rome, was put in charge of collected funds by his master Carpophorus, funds which were given as alms by other Christians for the care of widows and orphans; Callixtus lost the funds and fled from the city, but was caught near Portus. According to the tale, Callixtus jumped overboard to avoid capture but was rescued and taken back to his master. He was released at the request of the creditors, who hoped he might be able to recover some of the money, but was rearrested for fighting in a synagogue when he tried to borrow money or collect debts from some Jews.\n\"Philosophumena\" claims that, denounced as a Christian, Callixtus was sentenced to work in the mines of Sardinia. He was released with other Christians at the request of Hyacinthus, a eunuch presbyter, who represented Marcia, the favourite mistress of Emperor Commodus. At this time his health was so weakened that his fellow Christians sent him to Antium to recuperate and he was given a pension by Pope Victor I.\nIn 199, Callixtus was ordained a deacon by Pope Zephyrinus and appointed superintendent of the Christian cemetery on the Appian Way. That place, which is to this day called the \"Catacombs of St. Callixtus\", became the burial-ground of many popes and was the first land property owned by the Church. Emperor Julian the Apostate, writing to a pagan priest, said:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Christians have gained most popularity because of their charity to strangers and because of their care for the burial of their dead.\nIn the third century, nine bishops of Rome were interred in the Catacomb of Callixtus, in the part now called the \"Capella dei Papi\". These catacombs were rediscovered by the archaeologist Giovanni Battista de Rossi in 1849.\nIn 217, when Callixtus followed Zephyrinus as Bishop of Rome, he started to admit into the Church converts from sects or schisms who had not done penance. He fought with success the heretics, and established the practice of absolution of all sins, including adultery and murder. Hippolytus found Callixtus's policy of extending forgiveness of sins to cover sexual transgressions shockingly lax and denounced him for allowing believers to regularize liaisons with their own slaves by recognizing them as valid marriages. As a consequence also of doctrinal differences, Hippolytus was elected as a rival bishop of Rome, the first antipope.\nThe Basilica di Santa Maria in Trastevere was a \"titulus\" of which Callixtus was the patron. In an apocryphal anecdote in the collection of imperial biographies called the \"Augustan History\", the spot on which he had built an oratory was claimed by tavern keepers, but Alexander Severus decided that the worship of any god was better than a tavern, hence the structure's name. The 4th-century basilica of \"Ss Callixti et Iuliani\" was rebuilt in the 12th century by Pope Innocent II and rededicated to the Blessed Virgin Mary. The 8th-century \"Chiesa di San Callisto\" is close by, with its beginnings apparently as a shrine on the site of his martyrdom, which is attested in the 4th-century \"Depositio martyrum\" and so is likely to be historical.\nDeath.\nIt is possible that Callixtus was martyred around 222 or 223, perhaps during a popular uprising, perhaps by being thrown down a well. According to the apocryphal \"Acts of Saint Callixtus\", Asterius, a priest of Rome, recovered the body of Callixtus after it had been tossed into a well and buried Callixtus' body at night. Asterius was arrested for this action by the prefect Alexander and then killed by being thrown off a bridge into the Tiber River.\nCallixtus was buried in the cemetery of Calepodius on the Aurelian Way and his anniversary is given by the 4th-century \"Depositio Martirum\" and by subsequent martyrologies on 14 October. The Catholic Church celebrates his optional memorial on 14 October. His relics were transferred in the 9th century to Santa Maria in Trastevere.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

His pontificate was shaped by the Investiture Controversy, which he was able to settle through the Concordat of Worms in 1122.\nAs son of Count William I of Burgundy, Guy was a member of and connected to the highest nobility in Europe. He became archbishop of Vienne and served as papal legate to France. He attended the Lateran Synod of 1112. He was elected pope at Cluny in 1119. The following year, prompted by attacks on Jews, he issued the bull \"Sicut Judaeis\" which forbade Christians, on pain of excommunication, from forcing Jews to convert, from harming them, from taking their property, from disturbing the celebration of their festivals, and from interfering with their cemeteries. In March 1123, Calixtus II convened the First Lateran Council which passed several disciplinary decrees, such as those against simony and concubinage among the clergy, and violators of the Truce of God.\nEarly life.\nBorn the fourth son of Count William I of Burgundy, one of the wealthiest rulers in Europe, Guy was a member of the highest aristocracy in Europe. His family was part of a network of noble alliances. He was a cousin of Arduin of Ivrea, the king of Italy. One sister, Gisela, was married to Count Humbert II of Savoy and then to Renier I of Montferrat; another sister, Maud, was the wife of Duke Odo I of Burgundy. Another sister, Clementia, married Count Robert II of Flanders. His brother Raymond was married to Urraca, the future queen of Le\u00f3n, and fathered the future King Alfonso VII of Le\u00f3n. His brother Hugh was archbishop of Besan\u00e7on.\nArchbishop of Vienne.\nGuy first appears in contemporary records when he became the archbishop of Vienne in 1088. He held strong pro-papal views about the Investiture controversy. As archbishop, he was appointed papal legate to France by Pope Paschal II during the time that Paschal was induced under pressure from Holy Roman Emperor Henry V to issue the \"Privilegium\" of 1111, by which he yielded much of the papal prerogatives that had been so forcefully claimed by Pope Gregory VII in the Gregorian Reforms. These concessions were received with violent opposition and nowhere more so than in France, where the opposition was led by Archbishop Guy, who had attended the Lateran Synod of 1112.\nOn his return to France, he immediately convened an assembly of French and Burgundian bishops at Vienne, where the imperial claim to a traditional lay investiture of the clergy was denounced as heretical and a sentence of excommunication was now pronounced against Henry V on the grounds that he had extorted the \"Privilegium\" from Paschal II by means of violence. The council called Pope Paschal a simpleton (\"quod rex extorsit a vestra simplicitate\"). These decrees were sent to Paschal II with a request for a confirmation, which they received on 20 October 1112.\nPapacy.\nPaschal does not seem to have been quite pleased with Guy's zeal in his attacks upon Henry V. During the violent confrontations between Henry V and Paschal II's successor, Pope Gelasius II, the pope was forced to flee from Rome, first to Gaeta, where he was crowned, then to the Cluny Abbey, where he died on 29 January 1119. Guy was elected at Cluny on 2 February 1119. Nine cardinals took part in the election. Most of the other cardinals were in Rome. He was crowned at Vienne on 9 February 1119 as Calixtus II.\nAt the outset, it appeared that the new pope was willing to negotiate with Henry V, who received the papal embassy at Strasbourg, and withdrew his support from the antipope he had proclaimed at Rome. It was agreed that pope and emperor should meet at the Ch\u00e2teau de Mousson, near Rheims, and in October the new Pope opened the council at Rheims attended by Louis VI of France with most of the barons of France and more than four hundred bishops and abbots. Henry V arrived for his personal conference at Mousson \u2014 not alone, as had been anticipated, but with an army of over thirty thousand men. Calixtus II, fearing that force was likely to be used to extract prejudicial concessions, remained at Rheims. There, Calixtus II busied himself ineffectively with attempting a reconciliation between the brothers Henry I of England and Robert II of Normandy, and the council dealt with disciplinary regulations and decrees against lay investiture, simony, and clerical concubines. Since there was no compromise coming from Henry V, it was determined on 30 October 1119 that the Emperor and his antipope should be solemnly excommunicated.\nReturning to Italy, where antipope Gregory VIII was supported in Rome by imperial forces and Italian allies of the emperor, Calixtus II managed to gain the upper hand amid clear demonstrations of popular support. The Imperial candidate was obliged to flee to the fortress of Sutri, where he was taken prisoner through the intervention of Norman support from the Kingdom of Sicily. He was transferred from prison to prison first near Salerno, and afterwards at the fortress of Fumo. The imperial allies in Rome soon disbanded.\nSicut Judaeis.\nIn 1120 Calixtus II issued the papal bull \"Sicut Judaeis\" (Latin: \"As the Jews\") setting out the official position of the papacy regarding the treatment of Jews. The bull was intended to protect Jews and echoed the position of Pope Gregory I that Jews were entitled to \"enjoy their lawful liberty\". The bull forbade Christians, on pain of excommunication, from forcing Jews to convert, from harming them, from taking their property, from disturbing the celebration of their festivals, and from interfering with their cemeteries. It was reaffirmed by popes Alexander III, Celestine III (1191\u20131198), Innocent III (1199), Honorius III (1216), Gregory IX (1235), Innocent IV (1246), Alexander IV (1255), Urban IV (1262), Gregory X (1272 &amp; 1274), Nicholas III, Martin IV (1281), Honorius IV (1285\u20131287), Nicholas IV (1288\u201392), Clement VI (1348), Urban V (1365), Boniface IX (1389), Martin V (1422), and Nicholas V (1447).\nConcordat of Worms.\nHaving established his power in Italy, the pope resolved to re-open negotiations with Henry V on the question of investiture. Henry V was anxious to put an end to a controversy, which had reduced imperial authority in Germany terminally so as it appeared in the long run. An embassy of three cardinals was sent by Calixtus II to Germany, and negotiations for a permanent settlement of the investiture struggle were begun in October 1121 at W\u00fcrzburg, where it was agreed that a general truce should be proclaimed in Germany, the Church should have free use of its possessions and the lands of those in rebellion should be restored.\nThose decrees were communicated to Calixtus II, who despatched the legate Lambert to assist at the synod that had been convoked at Worms, where, on 23 September 1122, the agreement known as the Concordat of Worms was concluded. On his side, the Emperor abandoned his claim to investiture with ring and crosier and granted freedom of election to episcopal sees. On the papal side, it was conceded that the bishops should receive investiture with the sceptre; the episcopal elections should be held in the presence of the Emperor or his representatives; in case of disputed elections the emperor should, after the decision of the metropolitan and the suffragan bishops, confirm the rightfully-elected candidate; and the imperial investiture of the temporal properties connected to the sees should take place in Germany before the consecration.\nIn Burgundy and in Italy, the imperial investiture would take place after the consecration ceremony, and in the Papal States, the pope alone had the right of investiture without any interference on the part of the emperor. As a result of the Concordat, the Emperor still retained in his hands the controlling influence in the election of the bishops in Germany though he had abandoned much in regard to episcopal elections in Italy and Burgundy.\nFirst Lateran Council.\nTo secure the confirmation of this Concordat of Worms, Calixtus II convened the First Lateran Council on 18 March 1123. It solemnly confirmed the Concordat and passed several disciplinary decrees, such as those against simony and concubinage among the clergy. Decrees were also passed against violators of the Truce of God, church-robbers, and forgers of ecclesiastical documents. The indulgences already granted to the crusaders were renewed, and the jurisdiction of the bishops over the clergy, both secular and regular, was more clearly defined.\nLater life, death and legacy.\nCalixtus II devoted his last few years to re-establishing papal control over the Roman Campagna and establishing the primacy of his former prince-archbishopric, the See of Vienne over the long-time rival See of Arles. He also affirmed the authority of the bishop of Lyon over the church at Sens in France, transferred the historic bishopric of M\u00e9rida in Spain to Santiago de Compostela, and rebuilt the church of Santa Maria in Cosmedin in Rome.\nCalixtus died on 13 December 1124. A decade or two later, a French scholar (probably Aymeric Picaud) began composing a combination of miracle tales, liturgical texts and travelers guide relating to the increasingly popular pilgrimage route from southern France through northern Spain now called the Camino de Santiago. The work (published before 1173) was called the \"Liber Sant Jacobi\" (\"Book of St. James\") or the Codex Calixtinus, since a letter introduction attributed to this pope preceded each of the five chapters. Several of his authentic letters have also been preserved.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He became a tutor for King Alfonso V's illegitimate son Ferdinand. After arranging a reconciliation between Alfonso and Pope Martin V, Borgia was made Bishop of Valencia.\nIn 1444, Pope Eugene IV named him a cardinal, and Borgia became a member of the Roman Curia. During the siege of Belgrade (1456), Callixtus initiated the custom that bells be rung at midday to remind the faithful to pray for the crusaders. The tradition of the Angelus noon bell still exists in most Catholic churches to this day. He was also responsible for the retrial of Joan of Arc that saw her vindicated. He appointed two nephews as cardinals, one of whom became Pope Alexander VI. He is the last pope to date to take on the pontifical name \"Callixtus\".\nFamily.\nAlfonso de Borgia was born in La Torreta in 1378. La Torreta was at the time in the Se\u00f1or\u00edo de Torre de Canals (but is now a neighborhood of Novetl\u00e8). At the time he was born in the Kingdom of Valencia under the Crown of Aragon. He was the eldest child of Juan Domingo de Borja y Doncel and Francina Llan\u00e7ol. His sister Isabel married Jofr\u00e9 Llan\u00e7ol i Escriv\u00e0 (son of Rodrigo Gil de Borja y Fennolet), and become the mother of Pedro Luis de Borja and Pope Alexander VI. His other sister Catalina became of the mother of Luis de Mil\u00e0 y de Borja.\nAlfonso was baptized at Saint Mary's Basilica in Xativa, where he is honored with a statue in his memory.\nEarly church career.\nBorgia studied grammar, logic and the arts in Valencia and went in 1392 to the University of Lleida where he obtained a doctorate in both canon law and civil law. His early career was spent as a professor of law at the University of Lleida. Around 1411, he attended a sermon by Vincent Ferrer. Afterward, the Dominican said to the future pope: \"My son, you one day will be called to be the ornament of your house and of your country. You will be invested with the highest dignity that can fall to the lot of man. After my death, I shall be the object of your special honour. Endeavor to persevere in a life of virtue.\" Later, as pope, Borgia canonized Ferrer on 3 June 1455.\nBorgia was chosen as a delegate of the Diocese of Lerida to the Council of Constance in 1416, but did not partake in the proceedings as King Alfonso V of Aragon was opposed to the council. Because of this he went to Barcelona as a representative of his diocese in a synod. Borgia cared strongly for the reestablishment of the unity of the church; his influence with the Aragonese monarch was the factor that allowed for the conclusion of the accord between the king and the new pope.\nIn 1418, he was named as the rector of San Nicolas of Valencia. He was also the vice-chancellor of the University of Lleida from 1420 to 1423. In 1424, he resigned his position and dedicated his service to the Aragonese king. In 1424, he was named as the apostolic administrator of the see of Mallorca. It was at that time that the king desired that he be made a cardinal; Pope Martin V refused the request. During the Great Western Schism he supported Antipope Benedict XIII and was also the driving force behind Antipope Clement VIII's submission to Pope Martin V in 1429. He then served as a diplomat to the kings of Aragon, especially during the Council of Basel (1431\u20131439).\nEpiscopate and cardinalate.\nBorgia was appointed Bishop of Valencia by Pope Martin V on 20 August 1429 and was consecrated on 31 August 1429. He authorized Pedro Llorens to take possession of the see in his name. Borgia also tutored Alfonso V's illegitimate son Ferrante.\nPope Eugene IV elevated him to the cardinalate on 2 May 1444 after he managed to reconcile the pope and King Alfonso V of Aragon. He was elevated as the Cardinal-Priest of Santi Quattro Coronati. He took up his official residence in Rome and was a member of the Roman Curia. He participated in the papal conclave of 1447 that saw the election of Pope Nicholas V. He was known for an austere and charitable life.\nBorgia's coat of arms after he was consecrated featured a grazing ox. As pope it remained the same.\nPontificate.\nBorgia was elected pope at an advanced age as a \"compromise candidate\" in the conclave of 8 April 1455. He took the pontifical name Callixtus III. He was crowned on 20 April 1455 by Cardinal Protodeacon Prospero Colonna. After his coronation, he rode a white horse through the streets of the city and followed the ancient custom, known as Monte Giordano, where representatives of the Jews met with the pope and presented him with the roll of the law. Callixtus III then read from the law and stated \"We ratify the law, but condemn your interpretation\", which instigated a riot at the ceremony that endangered the pope's life.\nNot quite two years after the Fall of Constantinople in 1453, Callixtus was chiefly concerned with the organization of Christian Europe against an invasion by the Ottoman Empire. At the time, it was said that Callixtus III \"speaks and thinks of nothing but the crusade\", spending hours discussing the topic with a warlike zeal. An extensive building program underway in Rome was cancelled and the money funneled toward a crusade. Papal nuncios were dispatched to all the countries of Europe to beseech the princes to join once more in an effort to check the danger of a Turkish invasion. Missionaries were sent to England, France, Germany, Hungary, Portugal, and Aragon to preach the Crusade, and to engage the prayers of the faithful for the success of the enterprise. It was by order of Callixtus III that the bells were rung at midday to remind the faithful that they should pray for the welfare of the crusaders.\nThe princes of Europe were slow in responding to the call of the pope, largely due to national rivalries. England and France's Hundred Years' War had just ended in 1453. Forces led by John Hunyadi (), Captain-General of Hungary, met the Turks and defeated them at Belgrade on 22 July 1456. Shortly after his victory, Hunyadi himself died of a fever. On 29 June 1456, Callixtus III ordered the church bells to be rung at noon (see noon bell) as a call to prayer for the welfare of those defending Belgrade. To commemorate this victory, Callixtus III ordered the Feast of the Transfiguration to be held annually on 6 August.\nIn 1456 the pope issued the papal bull \"Inter Caetera\" (not to be confused with \"Inter Caetera\" of 1493), reaffirming the earlier bulls \"Dum Diversas\" and \"Romanus Pontifex\" which recognized Portugal's trade rights in territories it had discovered along the West African coast. This confirmation of \"Romanus Pontifex\" also gave the Portuguese the military Order of Christ under Henry the Navigator.\nCallixtus III ordered a new trial for Joan of Arc (c.\u00a01412\u20131431), at which she was posthumously vindicated. Callixtus III canonized the following four saints during his pontificate: Vincent Ferrer (3 June 1455), Osmund (1 January 1457), Albert of Trapani (15 October 1457), and Rose of Viterbo (1457).\nCallixtus III elevated nine new cardinals into the cardinalate in two consistories on 20 February 1456 and 17 December 1456, two of whom were cardinal nephews. The first of them was Rodrigo de Borgia who later became Pope Alexander VI (1492\u20131503), infamous for his corruption and immorality. The second was Luis Julian de Mil\u00e0.\nThe pope approved of the establishment of the University of Greifswald in 1456.\nAccording to one story that first appeared in a 1475 posthumous biography and was subsequently embellished and popularized by Pierre-Simon Laplace, Callixtus III excommunicated the 1456 appearance of Halley's Comet, believing it to be an ill omen for the Christian defenders of Belgrade from the besieging armies of the Ottoman Empire. No known primary source supports the authenticity of this account. The 29 June 1456 papal bull of Callixtus III calling for a public prayer for the success of the crusade makes no mention of the comet. By 6 August, when the Turkish siege was broken, the comet had not been visible in either Europe or Turkey for several weeks.\nDeath.\nCallixtus III died on 6 August 1458. His remains were transferred in 1586 and again in 1610 with the remains of his nephew Alexander VI to Santa Maria in Monserrato. His remains were transferred once more on 21 August 1889 in the Chapel of San Diego de Alcal\u00e1 in the Rome's Church of Santa Maria in Monserrato degli Spagnoli. In his will he left 5000 ducats to establish a hospital.\nLegacy.\nCatholic historian Ludwig von Pastor opined:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"Except for his nepotism, Calixtus III deserves high praise, more especially for the energy, constancy and purpose which he displayed in dealing with the burning question of the day \u2013 the protection of Western civilization from the Turkish power. In this matter he gave a grand example to Christendom, and it is to be observed that in the midst of the military and political interest which claimed so large a share of his time and attention, he did not neglect the internal affairs of the Church, and vigorously opposed heresies.\"\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "24222", "revid": "82432", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24222", "title": "Public-key cryptography", "text": "Cryptographic system with public and private keys\nPublic-key cryptography, or asymmetric cryptography, is the field of cryptographic systems that use pairs of related keys. Each key pair consists of a public key and a corresponding private key. Key pairs are generated with cryptographic algorithms based on mathematical problems termed one-way functions. Security of public-key cryptography depends on keeping the private key secret; the public key can be openly distributed without compromising security. There are many kinds of public-key cryptosystems, with different security goals, including digital signature, Diffie\u2013Hellman key exchange, public-key key encapsulation, and public-key encryption.\nPublic key algorithms are fundamental security primitives in modern cryptosystems, including applications and protocols that offer assurance of the confidentiality and authenticity of electronic communications and data storage. They underpin numerous Internet standards, such as Transport Layer Security (TLS), SSH, S/MIME, and PGP. Compared to symmetric cryptography, public-key cryptography can be too slow for many purposes, so these protocols often combine symmetric cryptography with public-key cryptography in hybrid cryptosystems.\nDescription.\nBefore the mid-1970s, all cipher systems used symmetric key algorithms, in which the same cryptographic key is used with the underlying algorithm by both the sender and the recipient, who must both keep it secret. Of necessity, the key in every such system had to be exchanged between the communicating parties in some secure way prior to any use of the system \u2013 for instance, via a secure channel. This requirement is never trivial and very rapidly becomes unmanageable as the number of participants increases, or when secure channels are not available, or when (as is sensible cryptographic practice) keys are frequently changed. In particular, if messages are meant to be secure from other users, a separate key is required for each possible pair of users.\nBy contrast, in a public-key cryptosystem, the public keys can be disseminated widely and openly, and only the corresponding private keys need be kept secret.\nThe two best-known types of public key cryptography are digital signature and public-key encryption:\nApplications built on public-key cryptography include authenticating web servers with TLS, digital cash, password-authenticated key agreement, authenticating and concealing email content with OpenPGP or S/MIME, and time-stamping services and non-repudiation protocols.\nOne important issue is confidence/proof that a particular public key is authentic, i.e. that it is correct and belongs to the person or entity claimed, and has not been tampered with or replaced by some (perhaps malicious) third party. There are several possible approaches, including:\nA public key infrastructure (PKI), in which one or more third parties \u2013 known as certificate authorities \u2013 certify ownership of key pairs. TLS relies upon this. This implies that the PKI system (software, hardware, and management) is trust-able by all involved.\nA \"web of trust\" decentralizes authentication by using individual endorsements of links between a user and the public key belonging to that user. PGP uses this approach, in addition to lookup in the domain name system (DNS). The DKIM system for digitally signing emails also uses this approach.\nHybrid cryptosystems.\nBecause asymmetric key algorithms are nearly always much more computationally intensive than symmetric ones, it is common to use a public/private \"asymmetric\" key-exchange algorithm to encrypt and exchange a \"symmetric key\", which is then used by symmetric-key cryptography to transmit data using the now-shared \"symmetric key\" for a symmetric key encryption algorithm. PGP, SSH, and the SSL/TLS family of schemes use this procedure; they are thus called \"hybrid cryptosystems\". The initial \"asymmetric\" cryptography-based key exchange to share a server-generated \"symmetric\" key from the server to client has the advantage of not requiring that a symmetric key be pre-shared manually, such as on printed paper or discs transported by a courier, while providing the higher data throughput of symmetric key cryptography over asymmetric key cryptography for the remainder of the shared connection.\nWeaknesses.\nAs with all security-related systems, there are various potential weaknesses in public-key cryptography. Aside from poor choice of an asymmetric key algorithm (there are few that are widely regarded as satisfactory) or too short a key length, the chief security risk is that the private key of a pair becomes known. All security of messages, authentication, etc., encrypted with this private key will then be lost. This is commonly mitigated (such as in recent TLS schemes) by using Forward secrecy capable schemes that generate an ephemeral set of keys during the communication which must also be known for the communication to be compromised.\nAdditionally, with the advent of quantum computing, many asymmetric key algorithms are considered vulnerable to attacks, and new quantum-resistant schemes are being developed to overcome the problem.\nBeyond algorithmic or key-length weaknesses, some studies have noted risks when private key control is delegated to third parties. Research on Uruguay\u2019s implementation of Public Key Infrastructure under Law 18.600 found that centralized key custody by Trust Service Providers (TSPs) may weaken the principle of private-key secrecy, increasing exposure to man-in-the-middle attacks and raising concerns about legal non-repudiation.\nAlgorithms.\nAll public key schemes are in theory susceptible to a \"brute-force key search attack\". However, such an attack is impractical if the amount of computation needed to succeed \u2013 termed the \"work factor\" by Claude Shannon \u2013 is out of reach of all potential attackers. In many cases, the work factor can be increased by simply choosing a longer key. But other algorithms may inherently have much lower work factors, making resistance to a brute-force attack (e.g., from longer keys) irrelevant. Some special and specific algorithms have been developed to aid in attacking some public key encryption algorithms; both RSA and ElGamal encryption have known attacks that are much faster than the brute-force approach. None of these are sufficiently improved to be actually practical, however.\nMajor weaknesses have been found for several formerly promising asymmetric key algorithms. The \"knapsack packing\" algorithm was found to be insecure after the development of a new attack. As with all cryptographic functions, public-key implementations may be vulnerable to side-channel attacks that exploit information leakage to simplify the search for a secret key. These are often independent of the algorithm being used. Research is underway to both discover, and to protect against, new attacks.\nAlteration of public keys.\nAnother potential security vulnerability in using asymmetric keys is the possibility of a \"man-in-the-middle\" attack, in which the communication of public keys is intercepted by a third party (the \"man in the middle\") and then modified to provide different public keys instead. Encrypted messages and responses must, in all instances, be intercepted, decrypted, and re-encrypted by the attacker using the correct public keys for the different communication segments so as to avoid suspicion.\nA communication is said to be insecure where data is transmitted in a manner that allows for interception (also called \"sniffing\"). These terms refer to reading the sender's private data in its entirety. A communication is particularly unsafe when interceptions can not be prevented or monitored by the sender.\nA man-in-the-middle attack can be difficult to implement due to the complexities of modern security protocols. However, the task becomes simpler when a sender is using insecure media such as public networks, the Internet, or wireless communication. In these cases an attacker can compromise the communications infrastructure rather than the data itself. A hypothetical malicious staff member at an Internet service provider (ISP) might find a man-in-the-middle attack relatively straightforward. Capturing the public key would only require searching for the key as it gets sent through the ISP's communications hardware; in properly implemented asymmetric key schemes, this is not a significant risk.\nIn some advanced man-in-the-middle attacks, one side of the communication will see the original data while the other will receive a malicious variant. Asymmetric man-in-the-middle attacks can prevent users from realizing their connection is compromised. This remains so even when one user's data is known to be compromised because the data appears fine to the other user. This can lead to confusing disagreements between users such as \"it must be on your end!\" when neither user is at fault. Hence, man-in-the-middle attacks are only fully preventable when the communications infrastructure is physically controlled by one or both parties; such as via a wired route inside the sender's own building. In summation, public keys are easier to alter when the communications hardware used by a sender is controlled by an attacker.\nPublic key infrastructure.\nOne approach to prevent such attacks involves the use of a public key infrastructure (PKI); a set of roles, policies, and procedures needed to create, manage, distribute, use, store and revoke digital certificates and manage public-key encryption. However, this has potential weaknesses.\nFor example, the certificate authority issuing the certificate must be trusted by all participating parties to have properly checked the identity of the key-holder, to have ensured the correctness of the public key when it issues a certificate, to be secure from computer piracy, and to have made arrangements with all participants to check all their certificates before protected communications can begin. Web browsers, for instance, are supplied with a long list of \"self-signed identity certificates\" from PKI providers \u2013 these are used to check the \"bona fides\" of the certificate authority and then, in a second step, the certificates of potential communicators. An attacker who could subvert one of those certificate authorities into issuing a certificate for a bogus public key could then mount a \"man-in-the-middle\" attack as easily as if the certificate scheme were not used at all. An attacker who penetrates an authority's servers and obtains its store of certificates and keys (public and private) would be able to spoof, masquerade, decrypt, and forge transactions without limit, assuming that they were able to place themselves in the communication stream.\nDespite its theoretical and potential problems, Public key infrastructure is widely used. Examples include TLS and its predecessor SSL, which are commonly used to provide security for web browser transactions (for example, most websites utilize TLS for HTTPS).\nAside from the resistance to attack of a particular key pair, the security of the certification hierarchy must be considered when deploying public key systems. Some certificate authority \u2013 usually a purpose-built program running on a server computer \u2013 vouches for the identities assigned to specific private keys by producing a digital certificate. Public key digital certificates are typically valid for several years at a time, so the associated private keys must be held securely over that time. When a private key used for certificate creation higher in the PKI server hierarchy is compromised, or accidentally disclosed, then a \"man-in-the-middle attack\" is possible, making any subordinate certificate wholly insecure.\nUnencrypted metadata.\nMost of the available public-key encryption software does not conceal metadata in the message header, which might include the identities of the sender and recipient, the sending date, subject field, and the software they use etc. Rather, only the body of the message is concealed and can only be decrypted with the private key of the intended recipient. This means that a third party could construct quite a detailed model of participants in a communication network, along with the subjects being discussed, even if the message body itself is hidden.\nHowever, there has been a recent demonstration of messaging with encrypted headers, which obscures the identities of the sender and recipient, and significantly reduces the available metadata to a third party. The concept is based around an open repository containing separately encrypted metadata blocks and encrypted messages. Only the intended recipient is able to decrypt the metadata block, and having done so they can identify and download their messages and decrypt them. Such a messaging system is at present in an experimental phase and not yet deployed. Scaling this method would reveal to the third party only the inbox server being used by the recipient and the timestamp of sending and receiving. The server could be shared by thousands of users, making social network modelling much more challenging.\nHistory.\nDuring the early history of cryptography, two parties would rely upon a key that they would exchange by means of a secure, but non-cryptographic, method such as a face-to-face meeting, or a trusted courier. This key, which both parties must then keep absolutely secret, could then be used to exchange encrypted messages. A number of significant practical difficulties arise with this approach to distributing keys.\nAnticipation.\nIn his 1874 book \"The Principles of Science\", William Stanley Jevons wrote:\nCan the reader say what two numbers multiplied together will produce the number 8616460799? I think it unlikely that anyone but myself will ever know.\nHere he described the relationship of one-way functions to cryptography, and went on to discuss specifically the factorization problem used to create a trapdoor function. In July 1996, mathematician Solomon W. Golomb said: \"Jevons anticipated a key feature of the RSA Algorithm for public key cryptography, although he certainly did not invent the concept of public key cryptography.\"\nClassified discovery.\nIn 1970, James H. Ellis, a British cryptographer at the UK Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), conceived of the possibility of \"non-secret encryption\", (now called public key cryptography), but could see no way to implement it.\nIn 1973, his colleague Clifford Cocks implemented what has become known as the RSA encryption algorithm, giving a practical method of \"non-secret encryption\", and in 1974 another GCHQ mathematician and cryptographer, Malcolm J. Williamson, developed what is now known as Diffie\u2013Hellman key exchange.\nThe scheme was also passed to the US's National Security Agency. Both organisations had a military focus and only limited computing power was available in any case; the potential of public key cryptography remained unrealised by either organization. According to Ralph Benjamin:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThese discoveries were not publicly acknowledged until the research was declassified by the British government in 1997.\nPublic discovery.\nIn 1976, an asymmetric key cryptosystem was published by Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman who, influenced by Ralph Merkle's work on public key distribution, disclosed a method of public key agreement. This method of key exchange, which uses exponentiation in a finite field, came to be known as Diffie\u2013Hellman key exchange. This was the first published practical method for establishing a shared secret-key over an authenticated (but not confidential) communications channel without using a prior shared secret. Merkle's \"public key-agreement technique\" became known as Merkle's Puzzles, and was invented in 1974 and only published in 1978. This makes asymmetric encryption a rather new field in cryptography although cryptography itself dates back more than 2,000 years.\nIn 1977, a generalization of Cocks's scheme was independently invented by Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir and Leonard Adleman, all then at MIT. The latter authors published their work in 1978 in Martin Gardner's Scientific American column, and the algorithm came to be known as RSA, from their initials. RSA uses exponentiation modulo a product of two very large primes, to encrypt and decrypt, performing both public key encryption and public key digital signatures. Its security is connected to the extreme difficulty of factoring large integers, a problem for which there is no known efficient general technique. A description of the algorithm was published in the Mathematical Games column in the August 1977 issue of Scientific American.\nSince the 1970s, a large number and variety of encryption, digital signature, key agreement, and other techniques have been developed, including the Rabin signature, ElGamal encryption, DSA and ECC.\nExamples.\nExamples of well-regarded asymmetric key techniques for varied purposes include:\nExamples of asymmetric key algorithms not yet widely adopted include:\nExamples of notable \u2013 yet insecure \u2013 asymmetric key algorithms include:\nExamples of protocols using asymmetric key algorithms include:\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
