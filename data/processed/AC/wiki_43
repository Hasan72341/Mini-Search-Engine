To recreate the sound, the surface is similarly rotated while a playback stylus traces the groove and is therefore vibrated by it, faintly reproducing the recorded sound. In early acoustic phonographs, the stylus vibrated a diaphragm that produced sound waves coupled to the open air through a flaring horn, or directly to the listener's ears through stethoscope-type earphones.\nThe phonograph was invented in 1877 by Thomas Edison; Alexander Graham Bell's Volta Laboratory made several improvements in the 1880s and introduced the graphophone, including the use of wax-coated cardboard cylinders and a cutting stylus that moved from side to side in a helical groove around the record. In the 1890s, Emile Berliner initiated the transition from phonograph cylinders to flat discs with a spiral groove running from the periphery to near the centre, coining the term \"gramophone\" for disc record players, which is predominantly used in many languages. Later improvements through the years included modifications to the turntable and its drive system, stylus, pickup system, and the sound and equalization systems.\nThe disk phonograph record was the dominant commercial audio distribution format throughout most of the 20th century, and phonographs became the first example of home audio that people owned and used at their residences. In the 1960s, the use of 8-track cartridges and cassette tapes were introduced as alternatives. In the 1980s, phonograph use declined sharply due to the popularity of cassettes and the rise of the compact disc. However, records have undergone a revival since the late 2000s.\nTerminology.\nThe terminology used to describe record-playing devices is not uniform across the English-speaking world. In modern contexts, the playback device is often referred to as a \"turntable\", \"record player\", or \"record changer\". Each of these terms denotes distinct items. A record player is generally a complete unit with speakers, while a turntable refers to a component which is connected to a separate amplifier and speakers. An automatic turntable will move the tone arm and shut off the motor after play, while a manual turntable requires placing the tone arm onto the record and manually returning the tonearm after play. A record changer plays a stack of records in sequence. A coin-operated jukebox plays from a large selection of records.\nWhen integrated into a DJ setup with a mixer, turntables are colloquially known as \"decks\". In later versions of electric phonographs, commonly known since the 1940s as record players or turntables, the movements of the stylus are transformed into an electrical signal by a transducer. This signal is then converted back into sound through a phono stage, an amplifier and one or more loudspeakers.\nThe term \"phonograph\", meaning \"sound writing\", originates from the Greek words (, meaning 'sound' or 'voice') and (, meaning 'writing'). Similarly, the terms \"gramophone\" and \"graphophone\" have roots in the Greek words (, meaning 'letter') and (, meaning 'voice').\nIn British English, \"gramophone\" may refer to any sound-reproducing machine that utilizes disc records. These were introduced and popularized in the UK by the Gramophone Company. Initially, \"gramophone\" was a proprietary trademark of the company, and any use of the name by competing disc record manufacturers was rigorously challenged in court. However, in 1910, an English court ruled that the term had become generic.\nUnited States.\nIn American English, \"phonograph\", properly specific to machines made by Edison, was sometimes used in a generic sense as early as the 1890s to include cylinder-playing machines made by others. But it was then considered strictly incorrect to apply it to Emile Berliner's Gramophone, a different machine that played nonrecordable discs (although Edison's original Phonograph patent included the use of discs.)\nAustralia.\nIn Australian English, \"record player\" was the term; \"turntable\" was a more technical term; \"gramophone\" was restricted to the old mechanical (i.e., wind-up) players; and \"phonograph\" was used as in British English. The \"phonograph\" was first demonstrated in Australia on 14 June 1878 to a meeting of the Royal Society of Victoria by the Society's Honorary Secretary, Alex Sutherland who published \"The Sounds of the Consonants, as Indicated by the Phonograph\" in the Society's journal in November that year. On 8 August 1878 the phonograph was publicly demonstrated at the Society's annual \"conversazione\", along with a range of other new inventions, including the microphone.\nEarly history.\nPhonautograph.\nThe phonautograph was invented on March 25, 1857, by Frenchman \u00c9douard-L\u00e9on Scott de Martinville, an editor and typographer of manuscripts at a scientific publishing house in Paris. One day while editing Professor Longet's \"Trait\u00e9 de Physiologie\", he happened upon that customer's engraved illustration of the anatomy of the human ear, and conceived of \"the imprudent idea of photographing the word.\" In 1853 or 1854 (Scott cited both years) he began working on \"le probl\u00e8me de la parole s'\u00e9crivant elle-m\u00eame\" (\"the problem of speech writing itself\"), aiming to build a device that could replicate the function of the human ear.\nScott coated a plate of glass with a thin layer of lampblack. He then took an acoustic trumpet, and at its tapered end affixed a thin membrane that served as the analog to the eardrum. At the center of that membrane, he attached a rigid boar's bristle approximately a centimetre long, placed so that it just grazed the lampblack. As the glass plate was slid horizontally in a well formed groove at a speed of one meter per second, a person would speak into the trumpet, causing the membrane to vibrate and the stylus to trace figures that were scratched into the lampblack. On March 25, 1857, Scott received the French patent #17,897/31,470 for his device, which he called a phonautograph. The earliest known surviving recorded sound of a human voice was conducted on April 9, 1860, when Scott recorded someone singing the song \"Au Clair de la Lune\" (\"By the Light of the Moon\") on the device. However, the device was not designed to play back sounds, as Scott intended for people to read back the tracings, which he called phonautograms. This was not the first time someone had used a device to create direct tracings of the vibrations of sound-producing objects, as tuning forks had been used in this way by English physicist Thomas Young in 1807. By late 1857, with support from the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d'encouragement pour l'industrie nationale, Scott's phonautograph was recording sounds with sufficient precision to be adopted by the scientific community, paving the way for the nascent science of acoustics.\nThe device's true significance in the history of recorded sound was not fully realized prior to March 2008, when it was discovered and resurrected in a Paris patent office by First Sounds, an informal collaborative of American audio historians, recording engineers, and sound archivists founded to make the earliest sound recordings available to the public. The phonautograms were then digitally converted by scientists at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California, who were able to play back the recorded sounds, something Scott had never conceived of. Prior to this point, the earliest known record of a human voice was thought to be an 1877 phonograph recording by Thomas Edison. The phonautograph would play a role in the development of the gramophone, whose inventor, Emile Berliner, worked with the phonautograph in the course of developing his own device.\nPaleophone.\nCharles Cros, a French poet and inventor, is the first person known to have made the conceptual leap from recording sound as a traced line to the theoretical possibility of reproducing the sound from the tracing and then to devising a definite method for accomplishing the reproduction. On April 30, 1877, he deposited a sealed envelope containing a summary of his ideas with the French Academy of Sciences, a standard procedure used by scientists and inventors to establish priority of conception of unpublished ideas in the event of any later dispute.\nAn account of his invention was published on October 10, 1877, by which date Cros had devised a more direct procedure: the recording stylus could scribe its tracing through a thin coating of acid-resistant material on a metal surface and the surface could then be etched in an acid bath, producing the desired groove without the complication of an intermediate photographic procedure. The author of this article called the device a , but Cros himself favored the word , sometimes rendered in French as ('voice of the past').\nCros was a poet of meager means, not in a position to pay a machinist to build a working model, and largely content to bequeath his ideas to the public domain free of charge and let others reduce them to practice, but after the earliest reports of Edison's presumably independent invention crossed the Atlantic he had his sealed letter of April 30 opened and read at the December 3, 1877 meeting of the French Academy of Sciences, claiming due scientific credit for priority of conception.\nThroughout the first decade (1890\u20131900) of commercial production of the earliest crude disc records, the direct acid-etch method first invented by Cros was used to create the metal master discs, but Cros was not around to claim any credit or to witness the humble beginnings of the eventually rich phonographic library he had foreseen. He had died in 1888 at the age of 45.\nThe early phonographs.\nThomas Edison conceived the principle of recording and reproducing sound between May and July 1877 as a byproduct of his efforts to \"play back\" recorded telegraph messages and to automate speech sounds for transmission by telephone. His first experiments were with waxed paper. He announced his invention of the first \"phonograph\", a device for recording and replaying sound, on November 21, 1877 (early reports appear in \"Scientific American\" and several newspapers in the beginning of November, and an even earlier announcement of Edison working on a \"talking-machine\" can be found in the \"Chicago Daily Tribune\" on May 9), and he demonstrated the device for the first time on November 29 (it was patented on February 19, 1878, as US Patent 200,521). \"In December, 1877, a young man came into the office of the \"Scientific American\", and placed before the editors a small, simple machine about which few preliminary remarks were offered. The visitor without any ceremony whatever turned the crank, and to the astonishment of all present the machine said: 'Good morning. How do you do? How do you like the phonograph?' The machine thus spoke for itself, and made known the fact that it was the phonograph...\"The music critic Herman Klein attended an early demonstration (1881\u201382) of a similar machine. On the early phonograph's reproductive capabilities he wrote in retrospect: \"It sounded to my ear like someone singing about half a mile away, or talking at the other end of a big hall; but the effect was rather pleasant, save for a peculiar nasal quality wholly due to the mechanism, although there was little of the scratching that later was a prominent feature of the flat disc. Recording for that primitive machine was a comparatively simple matter. I had to keep my mouth about six inches away from the horn and remember not to make my voice too loud if I wanted anything approximating to a clear reproduction; that was all. When it was played over to me and I heard my own voice for the first time, one or two friends who were present said that it sounded rather like mine; others declared that they would never have recognised it. I daresay both opinions were correct.\"\n\"The Argus\" newspaper from Melbourne, Australia, reported on an 1878 demonstration at the Royal Society of Victoria, writing \"There was a large attendance of ladies and gentlemen, who appeared greatly interested in the various scientific instruments exhibited. Among these the most interesting, perhaps, was the trial made by Mr. Sutherland with the phonograph, which was most amusing. Several trials were made, and were all more or less successful. 'Rule Britannia' was distinctly repeated, but great laughter was caused by the repetition of the convivial song of 'He's a jolly good fellow,' which sounded as if it was being sung by an old man of 80 with a cracked voice.\"\nEarly machines.\nEdison's early phonographs recorded onto a thin sheet of metal, normally tinfoil, which was temporarily wrapped around a helically grooved cylinder mounted on a correspondingly threaded rod supported by plain and threaded bearings. While the cylinder was rotated and slowly progressed along its axis, the airborne sound vibrated a diaphragm connected to a stylus that indented the foil into the cylinder's groove, thereby recording the vibrations as \"hill-and-dale\" variations of the depth of the indentation.\nIntroduction of the disc record.\nBy 1890, record manufacturers had begun using a rudimentary duplication process to mass-produce their product. While the live performers recorded the master phonograph, up to ten tubes led to blank cylinders in other phonographs. Until this development, each record had to be custom-made. Before long, a more advanced pantograph-based process made it possible to simultaneously produce 90\u2013150 copies of each record. However, as demand for certain records grew, popular artists still needed to re-record and re-re-record their songs. Reportedly, the medium's first major African-American star George Washington Johnson was obliged to perform his \"The Laughing Song\" (or the separate \"The Whistling Coon\") up to thousands of times in a studio during his recording career. Sometimes he would sing \"The Laughing Song\" more than fifty times in a day, at twenty cents per rendition. (The average price of a single cylinder in the mid-1890s was about fifty cents.)\nOldest surviving recordings.\nLambert's lead cylinder recording for an experimental talking clock is often identified as the oldest surviving playable sound recording,\nalthough the evidence advanced for its early date is controversial.\nWax phonograph cylinder recordings of Handel's choral music made on June 29, 1888, at The Crystal Palace in London were thought to be the oldest-known surviving musical recordings, until the recent playback by a group of American historians of a phonautograph recording of \"Au clair de la lune\" recorded on April 9, 1860.\nThe 1860 phonautogram had not until then been played, as it was only a transcription of sound waves into graphic form on paper for visual study. Recently developed optical scanning and image processing techniques have given new life to early recordings by making it possible to play unusually delicate or physically unplayable media without physical contact.\nA recording made on a sheet of tinfoil at an 1878 demonstration of Edison's phonograph in St. Louis, Missouri, has been played back by optical scanning and digital analysis. A few other early tinfoil recordings are known to survive, including a slightly earlier one that is believed to preserve the voice of U.S. President Rutherford B. Hayes, but as of May 2014 they have not yet been scanned. These antique tinfoil recordings, which have typically been stored folded, are too fragile to be played back with a stylus without seriously damaging them. Edison's 1877 tinfoil recording of \"Mary Had a Little Lamb\", not preserved, has been called the first instance of recorded verse.\nOn the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the phonograph, Edison recounted reciting \"Mary Had a Little Lamb\" to test his first machine. The 1927 event was filmed by an early sound-on-film newsreel camera, and an audio clip from that film's soundtrack is sometimes mistakenly presented as the original 1877 recording.\nWax cylinder recordings made by 19th-century media legends such as P. T. Barnum and Shakespearean actor Edwin Booth are amongst the earliest verified recordings by the famous that have survived to the present.\nImprovements at the Volta Laboratory.\nAlexander Graham Bell and his two associates took Edison's tinfoil phonograph and modified it considerably to make it reproduce sound from wax instead of tinfoil. They began their work at Bell's Volta Laboratory in Washington, D. C., in 1879, and continued until they were granted basic patents in 1886 for recording in wax.\nAlthough Edison had invented the phonograph in 1877, the fame bestowed on him for this invention was not due to its efficiency. Recording with his tinfoil phonograph was too difficult to be practical, as the tinfoil tore easily, and even when the stylus was properly adjusted, its reproduction of sound was distorted, and good for only a few playbacks; nevertheless Edison had discovered the idea of sound recording. However immediately after his discovery he did not improve it, allegedly because of an agreement to spend the next five years developing the New York City electric light and power system.\nVolta's early challenge.\nMeanwhile, Bell, a scientist and experimenter at heart, was looking for new worlds to conquer after having patented the telephone. According to Sumner Tainter, it was through Gardiner Green Hubbard that Bell took up the phonograph challenge. Bell had married Hubbard's daughter Mabel in 1879 while Hubbard was president of the Edison Speaking Phonograph Co., and his organization, which had purchased the Edison patent, was financially troubled because people did not want to buy a machine that seldom worked well and proved difficult for the average person to operate.\nVolta Graphophone.\nThe sound vibrations had been indented in the wax that had been applied to the Edison phonograph. The following was the text of one of their recordings: \"There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, than are dreamed of in your philosophy. I am a Graphophone and my mother was a phonograph.\" Most of the disc machines designed at the Volta Lab had their disc mounted on vertical turntables. The explanation is that in the early experiments, the turntable, with disc, was mounted on the shop lathe, along with the recording and reproducing heads. Later, when the complete models were built, most of them featured vertical turntables.\nOne interesting exception was a horizontal seven inch turntable. The machine, although made in 1886, was a duplicate of one made earlier but taken to Europe by Chichester Bell. Tainter was granted https:// on July 10, 1888. The playing arm is rigid, except for a pivoted vertical motion of 90 degrees to allow removal of the record or a return to starting position. While recording or playing, the record not only rotated, but moved laterally under the stylus, which thus described a spiral, recording 150 grooves to the inch.\nThe basic distinction between the Edison's first phonograph patent and the Bell and Tainter patent of 1886 was the method of recording. Edison's method was to indent the sound waves on a piece of tin foil, while Bell and Tainter's invention called for cutting, or \"engraving\", the sound waves into a wax record with a sharp recording stylus.\nGraphophone commercialization.\nIn 1885, when the Volta Associates were sure that they had a number of practical inventions, they filed patent applications and began to seek out investors. The Volta Graphophone Company of Alexandria, Virginia, was created on January 6, 1886, and incorporated on February 3, 1886. It was formed to control the patents and to handle the commercial development of their sound recording and reproduction inventions, one of which became the first Dictaphone.\nAfter the Volta Associates gave several demonstrations in the City of Washington, businessmen from Philadelphia created the American Graphophone Company on March 28, 1887, in order to produce and sell the machines for the budding phonograph marketplace. The Volta Graphophone Company then merged with American Graphophone, which itself later evolved into Columbia Records.\nA coin-operated version of the Graphophone, https://, was developed by Tainter in 1893 to compete with \"nickel-in-the-slot\" entertainment phonograph https:// demonstrated in 1889 by Louis T. Glass, manager of the Pacific Phonograph Company.\nThe work of the Volta Associates laid the foundation for the successful use of dictating machines in business, because their wax recording process was practical and their machines were durable. But it would take several more years and the renewed efforts of Edison and the further improvements of Emile Berliner and many others, before the recording industry became a major factor in home entertainment.\nThe technology quickly became popular abroad, where it was also used in new ways. In 1895, for example, Hungary became the first country to use phonographs to conduct folklore and ethnomusicological research, after which it became common practice in ethnography.\nDisc vs. cylinder as a recording medium.\nDiscs are not inherently better than cylinders at providing audio fidelity. Rather, the advantages of the format are seen in the manufacturing process: discs can be stamped, and the matrixes to stamp disc can be shipped to other printing plants for a global distribution of recordings; cylinders could not be stamped until 1901\u20131902, when the gold moulding process was introduced by Edison.\nThrough experimentation, in 1892, Berliner began commercial production of his disc records and \"gramophones\". His \"phonograph record\" was the first disc record to be offered to the public. They were in diameter and recorded on one side only. Seven-inch (17.5\u00a0cm) records followed in 1895. The same year, Berliner replaced the hard rubber used to make the discs with a shellac compound. Berliner's early records had poor sound quality, however. Work by Eldridge R. Johnson eventually improved the sound fidelity to a point where it was as good as the cylinder.\nWax cylinders would continue to be used into the 1920s, with New York City-based Czech immigrant, businessman, and inventor Alois Benjamin Saliger using cylinders for his \"Psycho-Phone\" or \"Psychophone\", a specialized phonograph or gramophone that Saliger intended to be used in the field of psychology. Invented in 1927 for sleep learning, the Psychophone featured a clock mounted on top of a phonograph, with a repeater device for rewinding and continuously replaying records. While Edison machines had a spring-powered motor, powered by crank on the side, Psychophone models featured an electric-powered motor. Saliger patented the device in 1932 as the \"automatic time-controlled suggestion machine\".\nDominance of the disc record.\nIn the 1930s, vinyl (originally known as vinylite) was introduced as a record material for radio transcription discs, and for radio commercials. At that time, virtually no discs for home use were made from this material. Vinyl was used for the popular 78-rpm V-discs issued to US soldiers during World War II. This significantly reduced breakage during transport. The first commercial vinylite record was the set of five 12\" discs \"Prince Igor\" (Asch Records album S-800, dubbed from Soviet masters in 1945). Victor began selling some home-use vinyl 78s in late 1945; but most 78s were made of a shellac compound until the 78-rpm format was completely phased out. (Shellac records were heavier and more brittle.) 33s and 45s were, however, made exclusively of vinyl, with the exception of some 45s manufactured out of polystyrene.\nFirst all-transistor phonograph.\nIn 1955, Philco developed and produced the world's first all-transistor phonograph models TPA-1 and TPA-2, which were announced in the June 28, 1955 edition of \"The Wall Street Journal\". Philco started to sell these all-transistor phonographs in the fall of 1955, for the price of $59.95. The October 1955 issue of \"Radio &amp; Television News\" magazine (page 41), had a full page detailed article on Philco's new consumer product. The all-transistor portable phonograph TPA-1 and TPA-2 models played only 45rpm records and used four 1.5 volt \"D\" batteries for their power supply. The \"TPA\" stands for \"Transistor Phonograph Amplifier\". Their circuitry used three Philco germanium PNP alloy-fused junction audio frequency transistors. After the 1956 season had ended, Philco decided to discontinue both models, for transistors were too expensive compared to vacuum tubes, but by 1961 a $49.95 ($ in 2024) portable, battery-powered radio-phonograph with seven transistors was available.\nTurntable designs.\nThere are presently three main phonograph designs: belt-drive, direct-drive, and idler-wheel.\nIn a belt-drive turntable the motor is located off-center from the platter, either underneath it or entirely outside of it, and is connected to the platter or counter-platter by a drive belt made from elastomeric material.\nThe direct-drive turntable was invented by Shuichi Obata, an engineer at Matsushita (now Panasonic). In 1969, Matsushita released it as the Technics SP-10, the first direct-drive turntable on the market. The most influential direct-drive turntable was the Technics SL-1200, which, following the spread of turntablism in hip hop culture, became the most widely used turntable in DJ culture for several decades.\nArm systems.\nIn some high quality equipment, the arm carrying the pickup, known as a tonearm, is manufactured separately from the motor and turntable unit. Companies specialising in the manufacture of tonearms include the English company SME.\nCue lever.\nMore sophisticated turntables were (and still are) frequently manufactured so as to incorporate a \"cue lever\", a device that mechanically lowers the tonearm on to the record. It enables the user to locate an individual track more easily, to pause a record, and to avoid the risk of scratching the record, which may require practice to avoid when lowering the tonearm manually.\nLinear tracking.\nEarly developments in linear turntables were from Rek-O-Kut (portable lathe/phonograph) and Ortho-Sonic in the 1950s, and Acoustical in the early 1960s. These were eclipsed by more successful implementations of the concept from the late 1960s through the early 1980s.\nPickup systems.\nThe pickup, or cartridge, is a transducer that converts mechanical vibrations from a stylus into an electrical signal. The electrical signal is amplified and converted into sound by one or more loudspeakers. Crystal and ceramic pickups that use the piezoelectric effect have largely been replaced by magnetic cartridges.\nThe pickup includes a stylus with a small diamond or sapphire tip that runs in the record groove. The stylus eventually becomes worn by contact with the groove, and it is usually replaceable.\nStyli are classified as spherical or elliptical, although the tip is actually shaped as a half-sphere or a half-ellipsoid. Spherical styli are generally more robust than other types, but do not follow the groove as accurately, giving diminished high frequency response. Elliptical styli usually track the groove more accurately, with increased high frequency response and less distortion. For DJ use, the relative robustness of spherical styli make them generally preferred for back-cuing and scratching. There are a number of derivations of the basic elliptical type, including the Shibata or fine line stylus, which can more accurately reproduce high frequency information contained in the record groove. This is especially important for playback of quadraphonic recordings.\nOptical readout.\nA few specialist laser turntables read the groove optically using a laser pickup. Since there is no physical contact with the record, no wear is incurred. However, this advantage is debatable, since vinyl records have been tested to withstand even 1200 plays with no significant audio degradation, provided that it is played with a high-quality cartridge and that the surfaces are clean. The disadvantage of the laser turntable is that the record must be extremely clean, lest the laser audibly \"play\" surface dust and debris that would normally be pushed aside by a mechanical stylus.\nAn alternative approach is to take a high-resolution photograph or scan of each side of the record and interpret the image of the grooves using computer software. An amateur attempt using a flatbed scanner lacked satisfactory fidelity. A professional system employed by the Library of Congress produces excellent quality. The system has the potential to recover and reconstruct recordings from fragile shellac discs that have broken into pieces.\nStylus.\nA development in stylus form came about by the attention to the CD-4 quadraphonic sound modulation process, which requires up to 50\u00a0kHz frequency response, with cartridges like Technics EPC-100CMK4 capable of playback on frequencies up to 100\u00a0kHz. This requires a stylus with a narrow side radius, such as . A narrow-profile elliptical stylus is able to read the higher frequencies (greater than 20\u00a0kHz), but at an increased wear, since the contact surface is narrower. For overcoming this problem, the Shibata stylus was invented around 1972 in Japan by Norio Shibata of JVC.\nThe Shibata-designed stylus offers a greater contact surface with the groove, which in turn means less pressure over the vinyl surface and thus less wear. A positive side effect is that the greater contact surface also means the stylus reads sections of the vinyl that were not worn by the common spherical stylus. In a demonstration by JVC records worn after 500 plays at a relatively high 4.5\u00a0g tracking force with a spherical stylus, played perfectly with the Shibata profile.\nOther advanced stylus shapes appeared following the same goal of increasing contact surface, improving on the Shibata. Chronologically: \"Hughes\" Shibata variant (1975), \"Ogura\" (1978), Van den Hul (1982). Such a stylus may be marketed as \"Hyperelliptical\" (Shure), \"Alliptic\", \"Fine Line\" (Ortofon), \"Line contact\" (Audio Technica), \"Polyhedron\", \"LAC\", or \"Stereohedron\" (Stanton).\nA keel-shaped diamond stylus appeared as a byproduct of the invention of the CED Videodisc. This, together with laser-diamond-cutting technologies, made possible the \"ridge\" shaped stylus, such as the Namiki (1985) design, and Fritz Gyger (1989) design. This type of stylus is marketed as \"MicroLine\" (Audio technica), \"Micro-Ridge\" (Shure), or \"Replicant\" (Ortofon).\nTo address the problem of steel needle wear upon records, which resulted in the cracking of the latter, RCA Victor devised unbreakable records in 1930, by mixing polyvinyl chloride with plasticisers, in a proprietary formula they called Victrolac, which was first used in 1931, in motion picture discs.\nEqualization.\nSince the late 1950s, almost all phono input stages have used the RIAA equalization standard. Before settling on that standard, there were many different equalizations in use, including EMI, His Master's Voice, Columbia, Decca FFRR, NAB, Ortho, BBC transcription, etc. Recordings made using these other equalization schemes typically sound odd if they are played through a RIAA-equalized preamplifier called a \"phono stage\". High-performance (so-called \"multicurve disc\") phono stages, which include multiple, selectable equalizations, are no longer commonly available. However, some vintage phono stages, such as the LEAK varislope series, are still obtainable and can be refurbished. Newer phono stages like the Esoteric Sound Re-Equalizer or the K-A-B MK2 Vintage Signal Processor are also available.\nContemporary use and models.\nAlthough largely replaced since the introduction of the compact disc in 1982, record albums still sold in small numbers throughout the 1980s and 1990s, but gradually sidelined in favor of CD players and tape decks in home audio environments. Record players continued to be manufactured and sold into the 21st century, although in small numbers and mainly for DJs. Following a resurgence in sales of records since the late 2000s, an increasing number of turntables have been manufactured and sold. Notably, Japanese company Panasonic brought back its well-known advanced Technics SL-1200 at the 2016 Consumer Electronics Show during which Sony also headlined a turntable, amid increasing interest in the format. Similarly, Audio-Technica revived its 1980s Sound Burger portable player in 2023.\nAt the low-end of the market, Crosley has been especially popular with its suitcase record players and have played a big part in the vinyl revival and its adoption among younger people and children in the 2010s.\nNew interest in records has led to the development of turntables with additional modern features. USB turntables have a built-in audio interface, which transfers the analog sound directly to the connected computer. Some USB turntables transfer the audio without equalization, but are sold with software that allows the EQ of the transferred audio file to be adjusted. There are also many turntables on the market designed to be plugged into a computer via a USB port for needle dropping purposes.\nModern turntables have also been released featuring Bluetooth technology to output a record's sound wirelessly through speakers. Sony have also released a high-end turntable with an analog-to-digital converter to convert the sound from a playing record into a 24-bit high-resolution audio file in DSD or WAV formats.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He altered conventional approaches to perspective and broke established rules of academic art by emphasizing the underlying structure of objects in a composition and the formal qualities of art. C\u00e9zanne strived for a renewal of traditional design methods on the basis of the impressionistic colour space and colour modulation principles.\nC\u00e9zanne's often repetitive, exploratory brushstrokes are highly characteristic and clearly recognizable. He used planes of colour and small brushstrokes that build up to form complex fields. The paintings convey C\u00e9zanne's intense study of his subjects.\nHis painting initially provoked incomprehension and ridicule in contemporary art criticism. Until the late 1890s it was mainly fellow artists such as Camille Pissarro and the art dealer and gallery owner Ambroise Vollard who discovered C\u00e9zanne's work and were among the first to buy his paintings. In 1895, Vollard opened the first solo exhibition in his Paris gallery, which led to a broader examination of C\u00e9zanne's work. Both Henri Matisse and Pablo Picasso are said to have remarked that C\u00e9zanne \"is the father of us all\".\nLife and work.\nEarly years and family.\nPaul C\u00e9zanne was born on 19 January 1839 at 28 rue de l'Op\u00e9ra in Aix-en-Provence, the son of the milliner and later banker Louis-Auguste C\u00e9zanne (1798\u20131886), and Anne-Elisabeth-Honorine Aubert (1814\u20131897). His parents married on 29 January 1844. He had two younger sisters: Marie, born in 1841, and Rose, June 1854. The C\u00e9zannes came from the commune of Saint-Sauveur (Hautes-Alpes, Occitania). On 22 February, he was baptized in the \u00c9glise de la Madeleine, with his grandmother and uncle Louis as godparents, and became a devout Catholic later in life. His father, a native of Saint-Zacharie (Var), was the co-founder of a banking firm (Banque C\u00e9zanne et Cabassol) that prospered throughout the artist's life, affording him financial security that was unavailable to most of his contemporaries and eventually resulting in a large inheritance.\nHis mother was \"vivacious and romantic, but quick to take offence\". It was from her that C\u00e9zanne got his conception and vision of life. He also had two sisters, Marie and Rose, with whom he went to a primary school every day.\nAt the age of ten, C\u00e9zanne entered the Saint Joseph school in Aix. Classmates were the later sculptor Philippe Solari and Henri Gasquet, father of the writer Joachim Gasquet, who was to publish his book \"C\u00e9zanne\" in 1921, a testament to the life of the artist. In 1852, C\u00e9zanne entered the Coll\u00e8ge Bourbon in Aix (now Coll\u00e8ge Mignet), where he became friends with \u00c9mile Zola, who was in a less advanced class, as well as Baptistin Baille\u2014three friends who came to be known as \"Les Trois Ins\u00e9parables\" (The Three Inseparables). It was probably the most carefree time of his life as the friends swam and fished on the banks of the Arc. They debated art, read Homer and Virgil and practiced writing their own poems. C\u00e9zanne often wrote his verses in Latin. Zola urged him to take poetry more seriously, but C\u00e9zanne saw it as just a pastime. He stayed there for six years, though in the last two years he was a day scholar. In 1857, he began attending the Free Municipal School of Drawing in Aix, where he studied drawing under Joseph Gibert, a Spanish monk.\nAt the request of his authoritarian father, who traditionally saw in his son the heir to his bank C\u00e9zanne &amp; Cabassol, Paul C\u00e9zanne enrolled in the law faculty of the University of Aix-en-Provence in 1859 and attended lectures for the study of jurisprudence. He spent two years with his unloved studies, but increasingly neglected them and preferred to devote himself to drawing exercises and writing poems. From 1859, C\u00e9zanne took evening courses at the \u00c9cole de dessin d'Aix-en-Provence, which was housed in the art museum of Aix, the Mus\u00e9e Granet. His teacher was the academic painter Joseph Gibert (1806\u20131884). In August 1859 he won second prize in the figure studies course there.\nHis father bought the Jas de Bouffan (House of the Wind) estate that same year. This partly derelict baroque residence of the former provincial governor later became the painter's home and workplace for a long time. The building and the old trees in the park of the property were among the artist's favorite subjects. In 1860, C\u00e9zanne obtained permission to paint the walls of the drawing room, and created the large-format murals of the four seasons: spring, summer, autumn and winter (today in the Petit Palais in Paris), which C\u00e9zanne ironically signed as Ingres, whose works he did not appreciate. The winter picture is additionally dated 1811, alluding to Ingres' painting Jupiter and Thetis, painted at that time and on display in the Mus\u00e9e Granet.\nGoing against the objections of his banker father, he committed himself to pursue his artistic development and left Aix for Paris in 1861. He was strongly encouraged to make this decision by Zola, who was already living in the capital at the time and urged C\u00e9zanne to abandon his hesitancy and follow him there. Eventually, his father reconciled with C\u00e9zanne and supported his choice of career, on condition that he begin a regular course of study, having given up hope of finding Paul as his successor in the banking business. C\u00e9zanne later received an inheritance of 400,000 francs from his father, which rid him of all financial worries.\nStudies in Paris.\nC\u00e9zanne moved to Paris in April 1861. The high hopes he had set in Paris were not fulfilled, as he had applied to the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts and was turned down. He attended the free Acad\u00e9mie Suisse, where he was able to devote himself to life drawing. There he met Camille Pissarro, ten years his senior, and Achille Emperaire from his hometown of Aix. He often copied at the Louvre from works by old masters such as Michelangelo, Rubens and Titian. But the city remained alien to him, and he soon thought of returning to Aix-en-Provence.\nInitially, the friendship formed in the mid-1860s between Pissarro and C\u00e9zanne was that of master and disciple, in which Pissarro exerted a formative influence on the younger artist. Over the course of the following decade, their landscape painting excursions together, in Louveciennes and Pontoise, led to a collaborative working relationship between equals.\nZola's faith in C\u00e9zanne's future was shaken. In June, he wrote to their childhood friend Baille: \"Paul is still the excellent and strange fellow I knew at school. To prove that he hasn't lost any of his originality, I have only to tell you that as soon as he got here he talked about returning.\" C\u00e9zanne painted a portrait of Zola that Zola had asked for to encourage his friend, but C\u00e9zanne was unsatisfied with the result and destroyed the picture. In September 1861, disappointed by his rejection at the \u00c9cole, C\u00e9zanne returned to Aix-en-Provence and worked again in his father's bank.\nIn the late autumn of 1862 he moved to Paris again. His father secured his subsistence level with a monthly sum of over 150 francs. The traditional \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts rejected him again. Again C\u00e9zanne attended the Acad\u00e9mie Suisse, which promoted Realism. During this time he got to know many young artists, after Pissarro also Claude Monet, Pierre-Auguste Renoir and Alfred Sisley.\nIn contrast to the official artistic life of France, C\u00e9zanne was under the influence of Gustave Courbet and Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix, who strove for a renewal of art and demanded the depiction of unembellished reality. Courbet's followers called themselves \"realists\" and followed his principle \"Il faut encanailler l'art\" (\"One must throw art into the gutter\"), formulated as early as 1849, which means that art must be brought down from its ideal height and become a matter of everyday life. \u00c9douard Manet made the definitive break with historical painting, concerned not with analytical observation, but with the reproduction of his subjective perception and the liberation of the pictorial object from symbolic burdens.\nThe exclusion of the works of Manet, Pissarro and Monet from the official salon, the Salon de Paris, in 1863 provoked such outrage among artists that Napoleon III had a \u201cSalon des Refus\u00e9s\u201d (salon of the rejected) set up next to the official salon. C\u00e9zanne's paintings were shown in the first exhibition of the Salon des Refus\u00e9s in 1863. The Salon de Paris rejected C\u00e9zanne's submissions every year from 1864 to 1869. He continued to submit works to the Salon until 1882. In that year, his artist friend Antoine Guillemet became a member of the Salon jury. Since each jury member had the privilege of showing a picture of one of his students, he passed off C\u00e9zanne as his student and secured his first participation at the Salon. He exhibited \"Portrait de M. L. A.\", probably \"Portrait of Louis-Auguste C\u00e9zanne, The Artist's Father, Reading \"L'\u00c9v\u00e9nement\"\", 1866 (National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.), although the painting was hung in a poorly lit spot in the top row of a secluded hall and received no attention. This was to be his first and last successful submission to the Salon.\nIn 2022, a portrait was discovered beneath the 1865 \"Still Life with Bread and Eggs\" when the Cincinnati Art Museum's museum's chief conservator, Serena Urry, removing the painting from an exhibit in which it had been included and examining it for potential maintenance requirements, noticed unusual patterns in the cracking and \"on a hunch\" had it x-rayed. Because C\u00e9zanne dated few paintings, it is believed to be the earliest firmly dated portrait by the artist. Museum curators believe it is likely a self-portrait; if so it may also be one of the earliest depictions of the artist, who was in his 20s the year he painted the still life.\nIn the summer of 1865, C\u00e9zanne returned to Aix. Zola's debut novel \"La Confession de Claude\" was published, it was dedicated to his childhood friends C\u00e9zanne and Baille. In the autumn of 1866, C\u00e9zanne executed a whole series of paintings using the palette knife technique, mainly still lifes and portraits. He spent most of 1867 in Paris and the second half of 1868 in Aix. At the beginning of 1869 he returned to Paris and met the bookbinder's assistant Marie-Hortense Fiquet, eleven years his junior, at the Acad\u00e9mie Suisse\nL'Estaque \u2013 Auvers-sur-Oise \u2013 Pontoise 1870\u20131874.\nOn 31 May 1870, C\u00e9zanne was best man at Zola's wedding in Paris. During the Franco-Prussian War, C\u00e9zanne and Hortense Fiquet lived in the fishing village of L'Estaque near Marseille, which C\u00e9zanne would later visit and paint frequently, as the place's Mediterranean atmosphere fascinated him. He avoided conscription for military service. Although C\u00e9zanne had been denounced as a deserter in January 1871, he managed to hide. No further details are known as documents from this period are missing.\nAfter the Paris Commune was crushed the couple returned to Paris in May 1871. Paul \"fils\", the son of Paul C\u00e9zanne and Hortense Fiquet was born on 4 January 1872. C\u00e9zanne's mother was kept a party to family events, but his father was not informed of Hortense for fear of risking his wrath and so as not to lose the financial allowances that his father gave him to live as an artist. The artist received from his father a monthly allowance of 100 francs.\nWhen C\u00e9zanne's friend, the crippled painter Achille Emperaire, sought refuge with the family in Paris in 1872 due to financial hardship, he soon felt obliged to leave: \"[\u2026] it was necessary, otherwise I would not have escaped the fate of the others. I found [C\u00e9zanne] here abandoned by everyone. [\u2026] Zola, Solari and all the others are no longer mentioned. He's the strangest guy imaginable.\"\nFrom late 1872 to 1874, C\u00e9zanne lived with Hortense and their son Paul in Auvers-sur-Oise, where he met the doctor and art lover Paul Gachet, later the painter Vincent van Gogh's doctor. Gachet was also an ambitious hobby painter and made his studio available to C\u00e9zanne.\nIn 1872, C\u00e9zanne accepted an invitation from his friend Pissarro to work in Pontoise in the Oise Valley. Pissarro, as a sensitive artist, became a mentor to the shy, irritable C\u00e9zanne, whom he was able to persuade to turn away from the darker colours, and gave him advice to \"Always only paint with the three primary colours (red, yellow, blue) and their immediate deviations,\" and refrain from linear contouring, defining shapes from the gradation of the colour tonal values. C\u00e9zanne felt that the Impressionist technique was bringing him closer to his goal and heeded his friend's advice. Pissarro later reported: \"We were always together, but still each of us kept what counts alone: our own feelings.\"\nFirst Impressionist group exhibitions from 1874.\nThe young painters in Paris did not see any support for their works in the Salon de Paris and therefore took up Claude Monet's plan for their own exhibition, which had been made in 1867. From 15 April to 15 May 1874, the first group exhibition of the \"Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 anonyme des artistes, peintres, sculpteurs, engravers\", later known as the Impressionists, took place. This name derives from the title of the exhibited painting \"Impression soleil levant\" by Monet. In the satirical magazine Le Charivari, the critic Louis Leroy described the group as \"Impressionists\" and thus created the term for this new art movement. The place of exhibition was the studio of the photographer Nadar on Boulevard des Capucines.\nPissarro pushed through C\u00e9zanne's participation despite concerns from some members who feared C\u00e9zanne's bold paintings would harm the exhibition. C\u00e9zanne was influenced by their style but his social relations with them were inept\u2014he seemed rude, shy, angry, and given to depression. In addition to C\u00e9zanne, Renoir, Monet, Alfred Sisley, Berthe Morisot, Edgar Degas, and Pissarro, among others exhibited. Manet declined participation, for him C\u00e9zanne was \"a mason who paints with a trowel\". C\u00e9zanne in particular caused a sensation, arousing indignation and derision from the critics with his paintings such as the \"Landscape near Auvers\" and the \"Modern Olympia\". In \"A Modern Olympia\", created as a quote from Manet's 1863 painting Olympia, which was often reviled, C\u00e9zanne sought an even more drastic depiction and in addition to the prostitute and servant, also showed the suitor, whose figure is believed to be a self-portrait.\nThe exhibition proved a financial failure; the final accounts showed a deficit of over 180 francs for each of the participating artists. C\u00e9zanne's The Hanged Man's House was one of the few pictures that could be sold. The collector Count Doria bought it for 300 francs.\nIn 1875, C\u00e9zanne met the customs inspector and art collector Victor Chocquet, who, mediated by Renoir, bought three of his works and became his most loyal collector and whose commissions provided some financial relief. C\u00e9zanne did not take part in the group's second exhibition, but instead presented 16 of his works in the third exhibition in 1877, which in turn drew considerable criticism. Reviewer Louis Leroy said of C\u00e9zanne's portrait of Chocquet: \"This peculiar looking head, the colour of an old boot might give [a pregnant woman] a shock and cause yellow fever in the fruit of her womb before its entry into the world.\" It was the last time he exhibited with the Impressionists. Another patron was the paint merchant Julien \"P\u00e8re\" Tanguy, who supported the young painters by supplying them with paint and canvas in exchange for paintings.\nIn March 1878, C\u00e9zanne's father found out about the long-hidden relationship with Hortense and their illegitimate son Paul through a thoughtless letter by Victor Chocquet. He then cut the monthly bill in half, and C\u00e9zanne entered a financially tense period in which he had to ask Zola for help. But in September he relented and decided to give him 400 francs for his family. C\u00e9zanne continued to migrate between the Paris region and Provence until Louis-Auguste had a studio built for him at his home, Bastide du Jas de Bouffan, in the early 1880s. This was on the upper floor, and an enlarged window was provided, allowing in the northern light but interrupting the line of the eaves; this feature remains. C\u00e9zanne stabilized his residence in L'Estaque. He painted with Renoir there in 1882 and visited Renoir and Monet in 1883.\nIn 1881, C\u00e9zanne worked in Pontoise with Paul Gauguin and Pissarro; C\u00e9zanne returned to Aix at the end of the year. He later accused Gauguin of having stolen his \"little sensation\" from him and that Gauguin, on the other hand only painted chinoiseries. In the spring of 1882, C\u00e9zanne worked with Renoir in Aix and \u2013 for the first time \u2013 in L'Estaque, a small fishing village near Marseille, which he also visited in 1883 and 1888. One of the first two stays was \"The Bay of Marseille seen from L'Estaque\". During the autumn of 1885 and the months that followed, C\u00e9zanne stayed in Gardanne, a small hilltop town near Aix-en-Provence, where he produced several paintings whose faceted forms were already anticipating the cubist style.\nBreak with Zola and marriage.\nC\u00e9zanne's long friendly relationship with \u00c9mile Zola had by now become more distant. In 1878, the urbane, successful writer had set up a luxurious summer house in M\u00e9dan near Auvers, where C\u00e9zanne had visited him repeatedly in the years 1879 to 1882 and in 1885; but his friend's lavish lifestyle made C\u00e9zanne, who lived an unassuming life, aware of his own inadequacy and caused him to doubt himself.\nZola, who meanwhile regarded the childhood friend as a failure, published his roman \u00e0 clef \"L'\u0152uvre\" from the novel cycle of \"Rougon-Macquart\" in March 1886, whose protagonist, the painter Claude Lantier, did not achieve the realization of his goals and committed suicide. In order to further emphasize the parallels between fiction and biography, Zola placed the successful writer Sandoz alongside the painter Lantier in his work. Monet and Edmond de Goncourt tended to see \u00c9douard Manet in the fictional painter described, but C\u00e9zanne found himself reflected in many details. He formally thanked him for sending the work supposedly related to him. For a long time, it was thought that contact between the two childhood friends then broke off forever. Recently letters have been discovered that refute this. A letter from 1887 demonstrates that their friendship did endure for at least some time after.\nOn 28 April 1886, Paul C\u00e9zanne and Hortense Fiquet were married in Aix in the presence of his parents. The connection to Hortense was not legalized out of love, as their relationship had long since broken down. C\u00e9zanne was shy of women and terrified of being touched, a trauma that stemmed from his childhood when, by his own admission, a classmate had kicked him from behind on the stairs. Rather, the marriage was intended to secure the rights of the now fourteen-year-old son Paul, whom C\u00e9zanne loved very much, as a legitimate son. In the early 1880s the C\u00e9zanne family stabilized their residence in Provence where they remained, except for brief sojourns abroad, from then on. The move reflects a new independence from the Paris-centered impressionists and a marked preference for the south, C\u00e9zanne's native soil. Hortense's brother had a house within view of Montagne Sainte-Victoire at L'Estaque. A run of paintings of this mountain from 1880 to 1883 and others of Gardanne from 1885 to 1888 are sometimes known as \"the Constructive Period\".\nDespite the strained relationship, Hortense was the person who was most often portrayed by C\u00e9zanne. From the early 1870s to the early 1890s, 26 paintings of Hortense are known. She endured the strenuous sessions motionless and patiently. In October 1886, after the death of his father, C\u00e9zanne, his mother and sisters inherited his estate, which included the Jas de Bouffan estate, so that C\u00e9zanne's financial situation became much easier. \"My father was a brilliant man,\" he said in retrospect, \"he left me an income of 25,000 francs.\" By 1888, the family was in the former manor, Jas de Bouffan, a substantial house and grounds with outbuildings, which afforded a new-found comfort. As of 2001[ [update]], this house, with much-reduced grounds, is now owned by the city and was open to the public on a restricted basis.\nExhibition at \"Les XX\" 1890 and first solo exhibition in Paris in 1895.\nC\u00e9zanne lived in Paris and increasingly in Aix without his family. Renoir visited him there in January 1888 and they worked together in Jas de Bouffan's studio. In 1890, C\u00e9zanne developed diabetes; the illness made it even more difficult for him to deal with his fellow human beings. C\u00e9zanne spent a few months in Switzerland with her and his son Paul in the hope that the troubled relationship with Hortense could be stabilized. The attempt failed, so he returned to Provence, with Hortense and Paul \"fils\" going to Paris. Financial need prompted Hortense's return to Provence but in separate living quarters. C\u00e9zanne moved in with his mother and sister. In 1891, he turned to Catholicism.\nIn the same year, he exhibited three of his works at the group \"Les XX\" in Brussels. The \"Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Vingt\", short \"Les XX\" or \"Les Vingt\", was an association founded around 1883 by Belgian artists or artists living in Belgium, including Fernand Khnopff, Th\u00e9o van Rysselberghe, James Ensor and the siblings Anna and Eug\u00e8ne Boch.\nIn May 1895, he attended Monet's exhibition at the Durand-Ruel Gallery with Pissarro. He was enthusiastic but later, significantly, identified 1868 as Monet's strongest period, when he was even more influenced by Courbet. With his fellow student from the Acad\u00e9mie Suisse, Achille Emperaire, C\u00e9zanne went to the area around the village of Le Tholonet, where he lived in the \"Ch\u00e2teau Noir\", which is located on the Montagne Sainte-Victoire. He often took the mountains as a theme in his paintings. He rented a hut at the nearby Bib\u00e9mus quarry; Bib\u00e9mus became another motif for his paintings.\nAmbroise Vollard, an aspiring gallery owner, opened C\u00e9zanne's first one-man show in November 1895. In his gallery, he showed a selection of 50 of around 150 works that C\u00e9zanne had sent him as a package. Vollard met Degas and Renoir in 1894 when he was exhibiting a bundle of Manet in his small shop, and they exchanged Manet works for their own works with him. Vollard also established relationships with Pierre Bonnard and \u00c9douard Vuillard, and in the same year the well-known paint dealer P\u00e8re Tanguy. When Tanguy died, Vollard was able to buy works by three artists who were still unknown at the time: C\u00e9zanne, Gauguin and van Gogh. The first buyer of a C\u00e9zanne painting was Monet, followed by colleagues like Degas, Renoir, Pissarro and later art collectors. Prices for works by C\u00e9zanne rose a hundredfold and Vollard, as always, profited from his stocks.\nIn 1897, a C\u00e9zanne landscape, \"The Mill on the Couleuvre near Pontoise,\" was purchased by Hugo von Tschudi for the Durand-Ruel Gallery in the Berlin National Gallery It was the second C\u00e9zanne work acquired by a museum, the first being the Berliner Museum.\nC\u00e9zanne's mother died on 25 October 1897. In November 1899, at the insistence of his sister, he sold the now practically deserted property \"Jas de Bouffan\" and moved into a small city apartment at 23, Rue Boulegon in Aix-en-Provence; the planned purchase of the \u201cCh\u00e2teau Noir\u201d property could not be realized. He hired a housekeeper, Mme Bremond, to look after him until his death.\nHomage to C\u00e9zanne.\nThe art market, meanwhile continued to react positively to C\u00e9zanne's works; Pissarro wrote from Paris in June 1899 about the auction of the Chocquet collection from his estate: \u201cThese include thirty-two C\u00e9zannes of the first rank [...]. The C\u00e9zannes will fetch very high prices and are already estimated at four to five thousand francs.\u201d In this auction, market prices for C\u00e9zanne paintings were achieved for the first time, but they were still \u201cfar below those for paintings by Manet, Monet or Renoir.\u201d\nIn 1901, Maurice Denis exhibited his 1900 large painting \"Hommage \u00e0 C\u00e9zanne\" in Paris and Brussels. The subject of the picture is Ambroise Vollard's gallery, which presents a picture \u2013 C\u00e9zanne's painting \"Still Life with Bowl of Fruit\" \u2013 formerly owned by Paul Gauguin. The writer Andr\u00e9 Gide acquired \"Hommage \u00e0 C\u00e9zanne\" and gave it to the Mus\u00e9e du Luxembourg in 1928. It is currently in the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay, Paris. Among the people portrayed: Odilon Redon is in the foreground on the left, listening to Paul S\u00e9rusier opposite him. Also depicted from left to right are \u00c9douard Vuillard, the critic Andr\u00e9 Mellerio with a top hat, Vollard behind the easel, Maurice Denis, Paul Ranson, Ker-Xavier Roussel, Pierre Bonnard with a pipe, and on the far right Marthe Denis, the painter's wife.\nLast years.\nIn 1901, C\u00e9zanne acquired a piece of land north of the city of Aix-en-Provence along the Chemin des Lauves, an isolated road on some high ground, where he had his studio built on the Chemin des Lauves in 1902 according to his needs (Atelier de C\u00e9zanne, now open to the public). He moved there in 1903. For large-format paintings such as \"The Bathers\", which he created in the Les Lauves studio, he had a long, narrow gap in the wall built through which natural light could flow. That year Zola died, leaving C\u00e9zanne in mourning despite the estrangement. His health deteriorated with age. In addition to his diabetes, he suffered from depression, which manifested itself in growing distrust of his fellow human beings to the point of delusions of persecution.\nDespite the artist's increasing recognition, hateful press releases appeared, and he received numerous threatening letters. C\u00e9zanne's paintings were not well received among the petty bourgeoisie of Aix. In 1903, Henri Rochefort visited the auction of paintings that had been in Zola's possession and published on 9 March 1903 in \"L'Intransigeant\" a highly critical article entitled \"Love for the Ugly\". Rochefort describes how spectators had supposedly experienced laughing fits, when seeing the paintings of \"an ultra-impressionist named C\u00e9zanne\". The public in Aix was outraged, and for many days, copies of \"L'Intransigeant\" appeared on C\u00e9zanne's door-mat with messages asking him to leave the town \"he was dishonouring\". \"I don't understand the world and the world doesn't understand me, so I withdrew from the world,\" said old C\u00e9zanne to his coachman. When C\u00e9zanne deposited his will with a notary in September 1902, he excluded his wife Hortense from the inheritance and declared his son Paul to be the sole heir. Hortense is said to have burned the mementos of his mother.\nIn 1903, he exhibited for the first time at the newly established Salon d'Automne (Paris Autumn Salon). The painter and art theorist \u00c9mile Bernard first visited him for a month in February 1904 and published an article about the painter in \"L'Occident\" magazine in July. C\u00e9zanne was then working on a vanitas still life with three skulls on an oriental carpet. Bernard reported that this painting changed colour and form every day during his stay, although it appeared complete from day one. He later regarded this work as C\u00e9zanne's legacy and summed it up: \"Truly, his way of working was a reflection with a brush in his hand.\" In the memento mori still lifes that he created several times, C\u00e9zanne's increasing depression of old age was evident, which in his letters since 1896 with comments such as \"life is beginning to be deadly monotonous for me\" were echoed. An exchange of letters with Bernard continued until C\u00e9zanne's death; he first published his memoirs Souvenirs sur Paul C\u00e9zanne in the Mercure de France in 1907, and in 1912 they appeared in book form.\nFrom 15 October to 15 November 1904, an entire room of the Salon d'Automne was furnished with the works of C\u00e9zanne. In 1905, an exhibition was held in London, in which his work was also shown; the Galerie Vollard exhibited his works in June, and the Salon d'Automne followed in turn from 19 October to 25 November with 10 paintings. The art historian and patron Karl Ernst Osthaus, who had founded the Museum Folkwang in 1902, visited C\u00e9zanne on 13 April 1906 in the hope of being able to purchase a painting by the artist. His wife Gertrud probably took the last photograph of C\u00e9zanne. Osthaus described his visit in his work \"A Visit to Paul C\u00e9zanne\", published in the same year.\nDespite the later successes, C\u00e9zanne was only ever able to approach his goals. On 5 September 1906, he wrote to his son Paul: \"Finally, I want to tell you that as a painter I am becoming more clairvoyant to nature, but that it is always very difficult for me to realize my feelings. I cannot reach the intensity that unfolds before my senses, I do not possess that wonderful richness of colour that animates nature.\"\nDeath.\nOn 15 October 1906, C\u00e9zanne was caught in a storm while working in the field. After working for two hours he decided to go home; but on the way he collapsed and lost consciousness. He was taken home by a passing driver of a laundry cart. Due to hypothermia, he contracted severe pneumonia. His old housekeeper rubbed his arms and legs to restore the circulation; as a result, he regained consciousness. The next day, C\u00e9zanne went out into the garden to work on his last painting, \"Portrait of the Gardener Vallier\", and wrote an impatient letter to his paint dealer, bemoaning the delay in the delivery of paint, but later on he fainted. Vallier, with whom he was working called for help; he was put to bed, and he never left it. His wife Hortense and son Paul received a telegram from the housekeeper, but they were too late. He died a few days later, on 22 October 1906 of pneumonia at the age of 67, and was buried at the Saint-Pierre Cemetery in his hometown of Aix-en-Provence.\nMain periods of C\u00e9zanne's work.\nVarious periods in the work and life of C\u00e9zanne have been defined.\nDark period, Paris, 1861\u20131870.\nC\u00e9zanne's early \"dark\" period was influenced by the works of French Romanticism and early Realism. Models were Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix and Gustave Courbet. His paintings are characterized by a thick application of paint, high-contrast, dark tones with pronounced shadows, the use of pure black and other tones mixed with black, brown, gray and Prussian blue; occasionally a few white dots or green and red brushstrokes are added to brighten up, enlivening the monochrome monotony. The themes of his pictures from this period are portraits of family members or demonic-erotic content, in which his own traumatic experiences are reminiscent. They differ sharply from his earlier watercolours and sketches at the \u00c9cole Sp\u00e9ciale de dessin at Aix-en-Provence in 1859, and their violence of expression is in contrast to his subsequent works.\nIn 1866\u201367, inspired by the example of Courbet, C\u00e9zanne painted a series of paintings with a palette knife. He later called these works, mostly portraits, \"une couillarde\" (\"a coarse word for ostentatious virility\"). Lawrence Gowing has written that C\u00e9zanne's palette knife phase \"was not only the invention of modern expressionism, although it was incidentally that; the idea of art as emotional ejaculation made its first appearance at this moment\".\nAmong the \"couillarde\" paintings are a series of portraits of his uncle Dominique in which C\u00e9zanne achieved a style that \"was as unified as Impressionism was fragmentary\". Later works of the dark period include several erotic or violent subjects, such as \"Women Dressing\" (c. 1867), \"The Abduction\" (1867), and \"The Murder\" (1867\u20131870), which depicts a man stabbing a woman who is held down by his female accomplice.\nImpressionist period, Provence and Paris, 1870\u20131878.\nCamille Pissarro lived in Pontoise. There and in Auvers he and C\u00e9zanne painted landscapes together. For a long time afterwards, C\u00e9zanne described himself as Pissarro's pupil, referring to him as \"God the Father\", as well as saying: \"We all stem from Pissarro.\" Under Pissarro's influence C\u00e9zanne began to abandon dark colours and his canvases grew much brighter, and he now used a colour palette based purely on the basic tones, yellow, red and blue. In doing so, he broke away from his technique of heavy, often overloaded-looking application of paint and adopted the loose painting technique of his role models, consisting of brushstrokes placed side by side.\nPortraits and figurative compositions receded in these years. C\u00e9zanne subsequently created landscape paintings in which the illusionistic deep space was canceled more and more clearly. The \u201cobjects\u201d continue to be understood as volumes and reduced to their basic geometric shapes. This design method is transferred to the entire picture area. The painterly gesture now treats the \u201cdistance\u201d in a similar way to the \u201cobjects\u201d themselves, giving the impression of a long-distance effect. In this way, C\u00e9zanne left the traditional pictorial space on the one hand, but on the other hand counteracted the dissolving impression of Impressionist pictorial works.\nMature period, Provence, 1878\u20131890.\nThe \"period of synthesis\" followed, in which C\u00e9zanne completely broke away from the Impressionist style of painting. He solidified the forms by applying paint diagonally across the surface, eliminated the perspective representation to create the depth of the picture and directed his attention to the balance of the composition. During this period, he increasingly created landscape and figure paintings. In a letter to his friend Joachim Gasquet, he wrote: \"The coloured surfaces, always the surfaces! The colourful place where the soul of the surface's trembles, the prismatic warmth, the encounter of the surfaces in the sunlight. I design my surfaces with my shades on the palette, understand me! [\u2026] The areas must be clearly visible. Definitely [...] but they have to be distributed correctly, they have to flow into one another. Everything has to play together and yet create contrasts. It's all about the volume!\"\nThe still lifes that C\u00e9zanne painted from the late 1880s are another focus of his work. He refrained from rendering the motifs in linear perspective and instead depicted them in the dimensions that made sense to him in terms of composition; a pear, for example, can be oversized in order to achieve inner balance and an exciting composition. He built his arrangements in the studio. In addition to the fruit, there are jugs, pots and plates, and occasionally a putto, often surrounded by a white, puffy tablecloth that lends the subject a baroque opulence. It is not the objects that should attract attention, but the arrangement of the shapes and colours on the surface.\nC\u00e9zanne developed the composition from individual dabs of paint spread across the canvas, from which the form and volume of the object gradually build up. Achieving the balance of these patches of colour on the canvas required a slow process, so C\u00e9zanne often worked on a painting for a long time. Initially only portraying family members or friends, C\u00e9zanne's better financial position allowed him to hire a professional model, a young Italian named Michelangelo di Rosa, for \"The Boy in the Red Vest\" (1888\u20131890), one of his best-known paintings. Di Rosa was represented in four paintings and two watercolours.\nFinal period, Provence, 1890\u20131906.\nMany of his later works, the so-called \"lyrical period\", such as the cycle of the bathers, are characterized by a turn to freely invented figures in the landscape; C\u00e9zanne created about 140 paintings and sketches on the theme of the bathing scenes. Here you can find his admiration for classical painting, which seeks to unite man and nature in harmony in Arcadian idylls. In the last seven years, he created three large-format versions of \"The Great Bathers (Les Grandes Baigneuses)\", with the 208 \u00d7 249\u00a0cm work on display in Philadelphia being the largest. C\u00e9zanne was concerned with the composition and the interplay of shapes and colours, of nature and figures. For his paintings at this time, he used sketches and photographs as templates, since he did not like the presence of naked models.\nC\u00e9zanne painted five versions of \"The Card Players\" (Les Joueurs de cartes) in 1890 and 1895, in which the same person is represented in different variants. For \"The Card Players\", he used farmers and day laborers who worked in the fields near the Jas de Bouffan as models. They are not genre pictures, even if they show scenes from everyday life; the motif is constructed according to strict laws of colour and form.\nThe area around the Montagne Sainte-Victoire was one of the most important themes of his later years. From a vantage point above his studio, later called Terrain des Paintres, he painted several views of the mountain. A precise observation of nature was a prerequisite for C\u00e9zanne's painting: \"In order to paint a landscape correctly, I first have to recognize the geological stratification.\" In total he painted more than 30 oil paintings and 45 watercolours of the mountains, and he wrote to a friend in the 1890s \"art is a harmony parallel to nature\".\nC\u00e9zanne was primarily concerned with watercolour painting in his late work, as he realized that the specific application of his method could be particularly evident in this medium. The late watercolours also had an effect on his oil paintings, for example in the study with bathers (1902\u20131906), in which a depiction full of \u201cempty spaces\u201d flanked by colour appears to be complete. The painter and art critic Roger Fry emphasized this in his seminal C\u00e9zanne publication \"C\u00e9zanne: A Study of His Development\" from 1927 that after 1885 the watercolour technique had a strong influence on his painting with oil paints. The watercolours in Vollard's C\u00e9zanne monograph of 1914 and in Julius Meier-Graefe's picture portfolio edited in 1918 with ten facsimiles based on the watercolours became known to a larger group of interested parties. Only lightly coloured pencil studies, which occasionally appeared in sketch albums, stand next to carefully coloured works. Many watercolours are equal to the realizations on canvas and form an autonomous group of works. In terms of subject matter, landscape watercolours dominate, followed by figure paintings and still lifes, while portraits, in contrast to paintings and drawings, are rarer.\nMethod.\nArtistic style.\nC\u00e9zanne's early work is often concerned with the figure in the landscape and includes many paintings of groups of large, heavy figures in the landscape, imaginatively painted. Later in his career, he became more interested in working from direct observation and gradually developed a light, airy painting style. Nevertheless, in C\u00e9zanne's mature work there is the development of a solidified, almost architectural style of painting. Throughout his life, he struggled to develop an authentic observation of the seen world by the most accurate method of representing it in paint that he could find. To this end, he structurally ordered whatever he perceived into simple forms and colour planes. His statement \"I want to make of impressionism something solid and lasting like the art in the museums\", and his contention that he was recreating Poussin \"after nature\" underscored his desire to unite observation of nature with the permanence of classical composition.\nAs with the old masters, for C\u00e9zanne the basis of painting was drawing, but the prerequisite for all work was subordination to the object, or the eye or pure looking: \"All the painter\u2019s intentions must be silent. He should silence all voices of prejudice. Forget! Forget! create silence! Be a perfect echo. [\u2026] The landscape is reflected, becomes human, thinks in me. [\u2026] I climb with her to the roots of the world. we germinate A tender excitement seizes me and from the roots of this excitement then rises the juice, the colour. I was born in the real world. I see! [\u2026] In order to paint that, then, the craft must be used, but a humble craft that obeys and is ready to transmit unconsciously.\"\nIn addition to oil paintings and watercolours, C\u00e9zanne left behind an extensive oeuvre of more than 1200 drawings, which, hidden in the cupboards and folders of the studio during his lifetime only began to interest collectors in the 1930s. They form the working material for his works and show detailed sketches, observation notes and traces of C\u00e9zanne's sometimes difficult to decipher stages on the way to the realization of the picture. Their task, linked to the process of creating the respective work, was to give the overall structure and the object designations within the pictorial organism. Even in old age, portraits and figure drawings were made based on models from antique sculptures and baroque paintings from the Louvre, which gave him clarity about the isolation of plastic phenomena. Therefore, the black and white of the drawings was an essential prerequisite for C\u00e9zanne's colour designs.\nPaul C\u00e9zanne was the first artist to begin breaking down objects into simple geometric shapes. In his much-quoted letter of 15 April 1904 to the painter and art theorist \u00c9mile Bernard, who had met C\u00e9zanne in his last years, he wrote: \"Treat nature according to cylinder, sphere, and cone and put the whole in perspective, like this that each side of an object, of a surface, leads to a central point [\u2026]\" C\u00e9zanne realized his painting ideas in the paintings of Montagne Sainte-Victoire and his still-lifes. In his pictorial conception, even a mountain is understood as a superimposition of forms, spaces and structures that rise above the ground.\n\u00c9mile Bernard wrote of C\u00e9zanne's unusual way of working: \"He began with the shadow parts and with one spot, on which he put a second, larger one, then a third, until all these shades, covering each other, modelled the object with their colouring. It was then that I realized that a law of harmony was guiding his work and that these modulations had a direction preordained in his mind.\u201d In this preordained direction, for C\u00e9zanne, lay the real secret of painting in the context of harmony and the illusion of depth. To the collector Karl Ernst Osthaus, C\u00e9zanne emphasized on 13 April 1906 during his visit to Aix that the main thing in a picture is the meeting of the distance. The colour must express every leap into the depths.\nOptical phenomena.\nC\u00e9zanne was interested in the simplification of naturally occurring forms to their essentials: he wanted to \"treat nature in terms of the cylinder, the sphere and the cone\" (a tree trunk may be conceived as a cylinder, an orange a sphere, for example). C\u00e9zanne's desire to capture the truth of perception led him to explore binocular vision, rendering slightly different, yet simultaneous visual perceptions of the same phenomena to provide the viewer with an aesthetic experience of depth different from those of earlier ideals of perspective, in particular single-point perspective. His interest in new ways of modelling space and volume derived from the stereoscopy obsession of his era and from reading Hippolyte Taine\u2019s Berkelean theory of spatial perception. C\u00e9zanne's innovations have prompted critics to suggest such varied explanations as sick retinas, pure vision, and the influence of the steam railway.\nMont Sainte-Victoire series.\nIn a letter to his friend \u00c9mile Zola, written on 14 April 1878, C\u00e9zanne described Mont Sainte-Victoire, as seen from the window of the train running from Aix to Marseille as follows: \"What a beautiful motif.\" This letter was written about six months after the opening of the railway line. Around this time, at the age of thirty-nine, C\u00e9zanne finally began a series of paintings devoted to Mont Sainte-Victoire in his hometown\u2014a subject he had never depicted before. Therefore, it is highly probable that C\u00e9zanne\u2019s Mont Sainte-Victoire series was inspired by the scenery viewed from the window of the moving train.&lt;br&gt;\nIndeed, in numerous works from the Mont Sainte-Victoire series, the railway bridge on the Aix\u2013Marseille line, which crosses the Arc River Valley, is depicted near the center-right of the composition.\nAller sur le motif, sensation and realization.\nC\u00e9zanne preferred to use these terms when describing his painting process. First of all, there is the \"motif\", by which he not only meant the representational concept of the picture, but also the motivation for his tireless work of observing and painting. \"Aller sur le motif\", as he called his approach to work, therefore meant entering into a relationship with an external object that moved the artist inwardly and that had to be translated into a picture.\nSensation is another key term in C\u00e9zanne's vocabulary. First of all, he meant visual perception in the sense of \"impression\", i.e. an optical sensory stimulus emanating from the object. At the same time, it includes the emotion as a psychological reaction to what is perceived. C\u00e9zanne expressly did not place the object to be depicted at the center of his painterly efforts, but rather the sensation: \"Painting from nature does not mean copying the object, it means realizing its sensations.\" The medium that mediated between things and sensations was the colour, although C\u00e9zanne left it open to what extent it arises from things or is an abstraction of his vision.\nC\u00e9zanne used the third term r\u00e9alisation to describe the actual painterly activity, which he feared would fail to the end. Several things had to be \u201crealized\u201d at the same time: first the motif in all its diversity, then the feelings that the motif triggered in him, and finally the painting itself, the realization of which could bring the other \u201crealizations\u201d to light. \"Painting\" therefore meant letting those opposing movements of taking in and giving, of \"impression\" and \"expression\" merge into one another in a single gesture. The \"realization in art\" became a key concept in C\u00e9zanne's thinking and acting.\nDating and cataloguing.\nThe sometimes longer dates for creation in the catalogues of C\u00e9zanne's works do not always indicate that the exact dating cannot be clarified, even if C\u00e9zanne rarely dated his pictures, especially since he worked on some pictures for months if not years before he was satisfied with the result. The artist himself regarded many of his paintings as unfinished, for painting was a never-ending process for him.\nCataloging C\u00e9zanne's works turned out to be a difficult task. Ambroise Vollard made the first attempt, a multi-volume photo album, similar to his catalogue of Renoir. Vollard's catalogue never materialized however. Georges Rivi\u00e8re, the father-in-law of C\u00e9zanne's son published a biography of the artist in 1923 (\"Le Ma\u00eetre Paul C\u00e9zanne\") that included a chronological and annotated list of many of the painter\u2019s works. Conceived by the art dealer Paul Rosenberg, the first complete catalogue raisonn\u00e9 was published by Lionello Venturi in 1936. The two volume \"C\u00e9zanne: Son Art, Son Oeuvre\" became the definitive catalogue of the artist's work for over five decades, although requiring a supplement as additional works were discovered and new scholarship and documentation introduced. Adrien Chappuis' \"The Drawings of Paul C\u00e9zanne \u2013 A Catalog Raisonn\u00e9\" was published by Thames and Hudson in London in 1973 and has remained the classic source for the artist's graphic work.\nJohn Rewald continued Venturi's work after his death. Rewald was tasked with combining Venturi\u2019s planned supplement with his own research, an agreement that did not work out as intended. After years of studying C\u00e9zanne\u2019s works, Rewald found that he not only disagreed with many of his predecessor\u2019s dates but a number of his attributions as well. He therefore set about developing an entirely new catalogue raisonn\u00e9. Rewald's \"Paul C\u00e9zanne \u2013 The Watercolours: A Catalog Raisonn\u00e9\" was published by Thames and Hudson, London with 645 illustrations in 1983. The missing dating of the paintings (Rewald only found one) and imprecise formulations of the pictorial motif such as \"Paysage\" or \"Quelques pommes\" caused confusion. In his early treatment of the \"Venturi\" Rewald made a list of all the works that could be dated without a stylistic analysis, because Rewald rejected such an analysis as unscientific. He continued his list by following the various whereabouts of C\u00e9zanne that could be verified by documents. Another scheme of his approach was to rely on the memories of the people portrayed, especially if they were C\u00e9zanne's contemporaries. Based on his own interviews, he made chronological assignments. Among the works that could be dated with certainty were C\u00e9zanne's \"Portrait of Gustave Geffroy\", which the sitter confirmed as 1895, and \"Lake Annecy\", which the artist visited only once, in 1896.\nRewald died in 1994, he was not able to fully complete his work. When in doubt, Rewald's tendency was to include rather than exclude. This method was adopted by his closest associates, Walter Feilchenfeldt Jr., son of the art dealer Walter Feilchenfeldt, and Jayne Warman, who completed the catalogue and provided it with introductions. The catalogue was published in 1996 under the title \"The Paintings of Paul C\u00e9zanne: A Catalog Raisonne \u2013 Review\". It includes the 954 works that Rewald wanted to record. Feilchenfeldt, Warman and David Nash went on to produce the first complete catalogue of the artist work since with \"The Paintings, Watercolors and Drawings of Paul Cezanne: An Online Catalogue Raisonn\u00e9\".\nLegacy.\nTestimonies of contemporary friends and painters.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Yes, C\u00e9zanne, he is the greatest of us all!\u2014\u200a\nC\u00e9zanne's childhood friend, the writer \u00c9mile Zola, was sceptical about C\u00e9zanne's human and artistic qualities, saying as early as 1861 that \"Paul may have the genius of a great painter, but he will never have the genius to actually become one. The slightest obstacle drives him to despair.\" In fact, it was C\u00e9zanne's self-doubt and refusal to make artistic compromises, as well as his rejection of social concessions, that led his contemporaries to regard him as an oddball.\nC\u00e9zanne's works were rejected numerous times by the official Salon in Paris and ridiculed by art critics when exhibited with the Impressionists. Yet during his lifetime, C\u00e9zanne was considered a master by younger artists who visited his studio in Aix. In the circle of the Impressionists, however, C\u00e9zanne was given special recognition; Camille Pissarro, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Claude Monet and Edgar Degas spoke enthusiastically about his work, and Pissarro said: \"I think it will be centuries before we get an account of it.\"\nA portrait of C\u00e9zanne was painted by his friend and mentor Pissarro in 1874, and in 1901 the co-founder of the Nabis group, Maurice Denis, created \"Hommage \u00e0 C\u00e9zanne\", showing C\u00e9zanne's painting \"Still Life with Fruit\" on the easel amidst artist friends at the Vollard Gallery. Originally owned by Paul Gauguin, Hommage \u00e0 C\u00e9zanne was later acquired by French writer and Denis' friend, Andr\u00e9 Gide, who owned it until 1928. It is now on display at the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay.\nContemporary art criticism.\nThe first joint Impressionist exhibition, in Paris from April to May 1874, attracted extensive criticism. Audiences and art critics, for whom \"the ideal\" of the \u00c9cole de Beaux Arts was proof of the existence of art, burst out laughing. One critic claimed that Monet painted by loading his paints in a gun and shooting them at the canvas. A colleague performed an Indian dance in front of a painting by C\u00e9zanne and shouted: \u201cHugh! [\u2026] I am the walking impression, the avenging palette knife, Monet's 'Boulevard des Capucines', 'The House of the Hanged Man' and 'The Modern Olympia' by Mr. C\u00e9zanne. Hugh! Hugh!\nIn an 1883 letter to Pissarro, the French writer Joris-Karl Huysmans replied to Pissarro's accusation that C\u00e9zanne was only briefly mentioned in Huysman's book \"L'Art Moderne\" by suggesting that C\u00e9zanne's view of the motifs was distorted by astigmatism: \"[...] There is certainly an eye defect involved, which I am assured he is also aware of.\u201d Five years later, in \"La Cravache\" magazine, his judgment became more positive when he described C\u00e9zanne's works as \u201cstrange yet real\u201d and as \u201crevelations\u201d.\nThe art dealer Ambroise Vollard first came into contact with C\u00e9zanne's works in 1892 through the paint dealer Tanguy, who had exhibited them in his shop in the Rue Clauzel in Montmartre in return for the delivery of painting utensils. Vollard recalled the lack of response: the shop was rarely visited, \"since it was not yet fashionable at the time to buy 'atrocious works' expensively, not even cheaply.\" Tanguy even took interested parties to the painter's studio, to which he had a key where small pictures and 100 francs large pictures could be bought at a fixed price of 40 francs. The \"Journal des Artistes\" echoed the general tone of the time, anxious to ask whether its sensitive readers would not be sickened at the sight of \"these oppressive abominations, which exceed the measure of evil permitted by law.\"\nThe art critic Gustave Geffroy was one of the few critics who judged C\u00e9zanne's work fairly and unreservedly during his lifetime. As early as 25 March 1894, he wrote in the \"Journal\" about the then current relationship between C\u00e9zanne's painting and the efforts of younger artists, that C\u00e9zanne had become a kind of forerunner to which the Symbolists referred, and that there was a direct connection between C\u00e9zanne's painting and of the Gauguins, Bernards and even Vincent van Goghs. A year later, after the successful exhibition at the Vollard Gallery in 1895, Geffroy again led the \"Journal\": \"He is a great truth fanatic, fiery and naive, harsh and nuanced. He will go to the Louvre.\u201d Between these two chronicles, C\u00e9zanne painted the portrait of Geffroy, which C\u00e9zanne left unfinished because he was dissatisfied with it.\nPosthumous exhibitions.\nTwo retrospectives posthumously paid tribute to the artist in 1907. From 17 to 29 June, the Bernheim-Jeune gallery in Paris showed 79 watercolours by C\u00e9zanne. The 5th Salon d'Automne then paid homage to him from 5 October to 15 November, exhibiting 49 paintings and seven watercolours in two rooms in the Grand Palais. Visitors included the art historian Julius Meier-Graefe, who would write the first C\u00e9zanne biography in 1910, Harry Graf Kessler and Rainer Maria Rilke. The two exhibitions motivated many artists, such as Georges Braque, Andr\u00e9 Derain, Wassily Kandinsky, Henri Matisse and Pablo Picasso, on their crucial insights for 20th century art.\nIn 1910, some of C\u00e9zanne's paintings were shown in the \"Manet and the Post-Impressionists\" exhibition in London (another one followed in 1912). The exhibition had been initiated by the painter and art critic Roger Fry in the Grafton Galleries, which wanted to introduce English art lovers to the work of \u00c9douard Manet, Georges Seurat, Vincent van Gogh, Paul Gauguin and C\u00e9zanne. Fry used the name to describe the Post-Impressionist style. Although the exhibition was judged negatively by critics and the public, it was to be significant in the history of modern art. Fry recognized the extraordinary value of the path that artists such as van Gogh and C\u00e9zanne had taken in expressing their personal feelings and worldview through their paintings, even if visitors at the time could not yet understand this. C\u00e9zanne's first exhibition in the United States took place in 1910/11 at Gallery 291 in New York. In 1913, his works were exhibited at the Armory Show in New York; it was a groundbreaking exhibition of modern art and sculpture, although here too the exhibits were met with criticism and ridicule. Today, these artists, who were criticized and ridiculed even by their own art academies during their lifetime, are regarded as the fathers of modern art.\nInfluence on modernity and misinterpretations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;C\u00e9zanne! C\u00e9zanne was the father of all of us.\u2014\u200a \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;A kind of dear god of painting.\u2014\u200a\nMany \"productive\" misunderstandings lie hidden in the reception of the works and the supposed intentions of C\u00e9zanne, which had a considerable influence on the further course and development of modern art. The list of those artists who more or less justifiably referred to him and who coined individual elements from the wealth of his creative approaches for their own pictorial inventions shows an almost complete art history of the 20th century. As early as 1910, Guillaume Apollinaire stated that \"most of the new painters claim to be successors of this serious painter who was only interested in art\".\nImmediately after C\u00e9zanne's death in 1906, stimulated by a comprehensive exhibition of his watercolours in the spring of 1907 at the \"Galerie Bernheim-Jeune\" and a retrospective in October 1907 at the \"Salon d'Automne\" in Paris, a lively examination of his work began. Among young French artists, Henri Matisse and Andr\u00e9 Derain were the first to become passionate about C\u00e9zanne, followed by Picasso, Fernand L\u00e9ger, Georges Braque, Marcel Duchamp and Piet Mondrian. This enthusiasm was lasting, as the eighty-year-old Matisse said in 1949 that he owed the most to the art of C\u00e9zanne. Braque also described the influence of C\u00e9zanne on his art as an \"initiation\" and said in 1961: \"C\u00e9zanne was the first to turn away from the learned mechanized perspective.\" Picasso admitted that \"he was the only master for me ..., he was a father figure to us: it was he who offered us protection.\"\nC\u00e9zanne expert G\u00f6tz Adriani notes, however, that the C\u00e9zanne's reception by Cubists \u2013 particularly by the Albert Gleizes and Jean Metzinger, who placed C\u00e9zanne at the beginning of their way of painting in their 1912 treatise \"Du \"Cubisme\"\" \u2013 was arbitrary because they largely ignored the motivation gained from observing nature. In this context, he points to the formalistic misinterpretations that refer to \u00c9mile Bernard's published paper from 1907, which refers to a 1904 letter C\u00e9zanne wrote advising him to \"treat nature according to cylinder, sphere and cone\" Further misinterpretations of this kind can be found in Kazimir Malevich's 1919 text \"On the New Systems in Art\". In his quote, C\u00e9zanne did not intend to reinterpret the experience of nature in the sense of orienting himself towards cubic form elements; he was more concerned with corresponding to the object forms and their colouring under the various aspects in the picture.\nOne of the many examples of C\u00e9zanne's influence on modernism is the 1888 painting \"Mardi Gras\" in the Pushkin Museum, which shows his son Paul with his friend Louis Guillaume and in costumes from the Commedia dell'arte. Picasso took inspiration from it for the harlequin theme in his pink period. Matisse, in turn, took up the theme of the most classic painting in the Bathers series, \"The Great Bathers\" from the Philadelphia Museum of Art, in his 1909 painting The Bathers.\nNumerous artists were inspired by C\u00e9zanne's work. The painter Paula Modersohn-Becker saw C\u00e9zanne's paintings in Paris in 1900, which deeply impressed her. Shortly before her death, she wrote to Clara Westhoff in a letter on 21 October 1907 : \"I am thinking and thinking a lot these days about C\u00e9zanne and how he is one of the three or four painters who struck me like a thunderstorm or a major event.\u201d Paul Klee noted in his diary in 1909: \u201cC\u00e9zanne is a teacher par excellence for me\u201d after seeing more than a dozen paintings by C\u00e9zanne in the Munich Secession. The artist group Der Blaue Reiter referred to him in their 1912 almanac when Franz Marc reported on the kinship between El Greco and C\u00e9zanne, whose works he understood as the gateways to a new era of painting. Again, Kandinsky, who had seen C\u00e9zanne's painting at the 1907 retrospective at the \"Salon d'Automne\", refers to C\u00e9zanne in his 1912 treatise \"On the Spiritual in Art\", in whose work he found a \"strong resonance of the abstract.\" recognized and found the spiritual part of his beliefs predetermined in him. El Lissitzky emphasized his importance for the Russian avant-garde around 1923, and Lenin suggested erecting monuments to the heroes of the world revolution in 1918; on the roll of honor were Courbet and C\u00e9zanne. Next to Matisse, Alberto Giacometti dealt most extensively with C\u00e9zanne's style of representation. Aristide Maillol worked on a C\u00e9zanne monument in 1909, but failed due to rejection by the city of Aix-en-Provence. C\u00e9zanne was also an important authority for artists of the newer generation. Jasper Johns described him as his most important role model, alongside Duchamp and Leonardo da Vinci.\nInspired by C\u00e9zanne, Albert Gleizes and Jean Metzinger wrote:\nC\u00e9zanne is one of the greatest of those who changed the course of art history ... From him we have learned that to alter the colouring of an object is to alter its structure. His work proves without doubt that painting is not\u2014or not any longer\u2014the art of imitating an object by lines and colours, but of giving plastic [solid, but alterable] form to our nature. (\"Du \"Cubisme\"\", 1912)\nAlong with the work of Vincent van Gogh and Paul Gauguin, the work of C\u00e9zanne, with its sense of immediacy and incompletion, critically influenced Matisse and others prior to Fauvism and Expressionism. C\u00e9zanne's explorations of geometric simplification and optical phenomena inspired Picasso, Braque, Metzinger, Gleizes, Gris and others to experiment with ever more complex views of the same subject and eventually to the fracturing of form. C\u00e9zanne thus sparked one of the most revolutionary areas of artistic enquiry of the 20th century, one which was to affect profoundly the development of modern art. Picasso referred to C\u00e9zanne as \"the father of us all\" and claimed him as \"my one and only master!\" Other painters such as Edgar Degas, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Paul Gauguin, Kasimir Malevich, Georges Rouault, Paul Klee, and Henri Matisse acknowledged C\u00e9zanne's genius.\nErnest Hemingway compared his writing to C\u00e9zanne's landscapes. In his memoir \"A Moveable Feast\", Hemingway wrote, \"I was learning something from the painting of C\u00e9zanne that made writing simple true sentences far from enough to make the stories have the dimensions that I was trying to put in them.\"\nC\u00e9zanne's painting \"The Boy in the Red Vest\" was stolen from a Swiss museum in 2008. It was recovered in a Serbian police raid in 2012.\nFilms about C\u00e9zanne.\n\"Une visite au Louvre\", 2004. Filmed and directed by Jean-Marie Straub and Dani\u00e8le Huillet about C\u00e9zanne, based on the posthumously published conversations with the painter, handed down by his admirer Joachim Gasquet. The film describes a walk by C\u00e9zanne in the Louvre past the paintings of his fellow artists.\nOn the 100th anniversary of C\u00e9zanne's death in 2006, two documentaries from 1995 and 2000 about Paul C\u00e9zanne and his motif \"La Montagne Sainte-Victoire\" were re-released. \"C\u00e9zanne's triumph\" was re-shot for the 2006 anniversary year.\n\"The Violence of the Motive\", 1995. A film directed by Alain Jaubert. A mountain near his hometown of Aix-en-Provence becomes C\u00e9zanne's main motif. He shows La Montagne Sainte-Victoire from different perspectives and at different times of the year more than 80 times. The motif becomes an obsession that Jaubert gets to the bottom of in his film.\n\"C\u00e9zanne \u2013 the Painter\", 2000. A film by Elisabeth Kapnist. The story of a passion and a lifelong artistic search: the painter C\u00e9zanne, his childhood, his friendship with Zola and his encounter with Impressionism are portrayed.\n\"The Triumph of C\u00e9zanne\", 2006. A film by Jacques Deschamps. Deschamps takes the 100th anniversary of C\u00e9zanne's death in October 2006 as an opportunity to trace the genesis of a legend. C\u00e9zanne encountered rejection and incomprehension before he was allowed to rise to the Olympus of art history and the international art market.\nThe 2016 film \"C\u00e9zanne and I\" explores the friendship between the artist and \u00c9mile Zola.\nIn fiction.\nPaul C\u00e9zanne figures prominently in the award winning Historical Fiction Novel, \"The Dream Collector\", Book 1: \"Sabrine &amp; Sigmund Freud\" (2023) by R.w. Meek (Historium Press) in which C\u00e9zanne's relationship with \u00c9mile Zola is explored, as well as C\u00e9zanne's phobia of touch and his painting method of 'modulation'.\nC\u00e9zanne and philosophy.\nThe French philosopher Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Lyotard argues in his work \"Mis\u00e8re de la philosophie\", that C\u00e9zanne has, so to speak, the sixth sense: he senses the reality in the making before it is completed in normal perception. So the painter touches on the sublime when he sees the overwhelming quality of the mountainous landscape, which can neither be represented with normal language nor with the usual painting technique. Lyotard sums it up: \"One can also say that the uncanniness of the oil paintings and watercolours dedicated to mountains and fruits derives both from a deep sense of the disappearance of appearances and from the demise of the visible world.\"\nC\u00e9zanne's stylistic approaches and beliefs regarding how to paint were analyzed and written about by the French philosopher Maurice Merleau-Ponty who is primarily known for his association with phenomenology and existentialism. In his 1945 essay entitled \"C\u00e9zanne's Doubt\", Merleau-Ponty discusses how C\u00e9zanne gave up classic artistic elements such as pictorial arrangements, single view perspectives, and outlines that enclosed colour in an attempt to get a \"lived perspective\" by capturing all the complexities that an eye observes. He wanted to see and sense the objects he was painting, rather than think about them. Ultimately, he wanted to get to the point where \"sight\" was also \"touch\". He would take hours sometimes to put down a single stroke because each stroke needed to contain \"the air, the light, the object, the composition, the character, the outline, and the style\". A still life might have taken C\u00e9zanne one hundred working sessions while a portrait took him around one hundred and fifty sessions. C\u00e9zanne believed that while he was painting, he was capturing a moment in time, that once passed, could not come back. The atmosphere surrounding what he was painting was a part of the sensational reality he was painting. C\u00e9zanne claimed: \"Art is a personal apperception, which I embody in sensations and which I ask the understanding to organize into a painting.\"\nArt market.\nThe increase in value of C\u00e9zanne's work can be seen from the auction of his painting on 10 May 1999, which sold for $61.5\u00a0million at Sotheby's in New York, the fourth-highest price paid for a painting up to that time, and the most expensive still life painting at the time.\nC\u00e9zanne's watercolour \"Still Life with Green Melon\" set the record for a work on paper at an auction, when it sold for $25.5 million in 8 May 2007, far above its estimate of $18 million. A preparatory watercolour for \"The Card Players\" series previously thought lost for sixty years sold for $19.1 million on 1 May 2012 to an anonymous bidder.\nOne of the five versions of C\u00e9zanne's \"The Card Players\" was sold in 2011 to the Royal Family of Qatar for a price variously estimated at between $250\u00a0million ($ million today) and possibly as high as $300\u00a0million ($ million today), either price signifying a new mark for highest price for a painting up to that date. The record price was surpassed in November 2017 by \"Salvator Mundi\" by Leonardo da Vinci. \"The Card Players\" is now the third most expensive painting of all time after the sale of \"Interchange\" by Willem de Kooning.\nOn 8 November 2022, $138 million US was paid for the painting \"La Montagne Sainte-Victoire\" as part of the Paul Allen collection sale at Christie's in New York City to setting a new mark for a price paid for his work at auction.\nNazi-looted art.\nIn 2000, French courts ordered the seizure of C\u00e9zanne's \"The sea at l'Estaque\" which was part of the \"From Fra Angelico to Bonnard: masterpieces from the Rau Collection\" exhibition at the Mus\u00e9e du Luxembourg because of a claim that it had been looted by Nazis from the gallery owner Josse Bernheim-Jeune.\nIn 2020, the provenance of a C\u00e9zanne from the Buehrle collection came under scrutiny. The painting, Paysage, had already been flagged as potentially problematic in the 2015 \"Schwarzbuch B\u00fchrle: Raubkunst f\u00fcr das Kunsthaus Z\u00fcrich\"?. In \"Die Wochenzeitung\", Keller said the provenance of \"Paysage\" had been \"whitewashed\". \"Among Keller's objections to the provenance description on the foundation's website is the failure to note that the pre-war owners, Berthold and Martha Nothmann, were forced to flee Germany as Jews in 1939.\"\nIn 2023, a last minute settlement was reached between the heirs of Jacob Goldschmidt and the Museum Langmatt, a foundation founded by Dr. Sidney Brown, concerning C\u00e9zanne's \"Fruits et pot de gingembre.\" The deal was brokered by Christie's after it was discovered that Goldschmidt, a Jewish art dealer, had sold the artwork due to Nazi persecution.\nC\u00e9zanne's Provence.\nVisitors to Aix-en-Provence can discover C\u00e9zanne's landscape motifs along five marked trails from the city center. They lead to Le Tholonet, the Jas de Bouffan, the Bib\u00e9mus quarry, the banks of the River Arc and the Les Lauves workshop.\nThe Atelier Les Lauves has been open to the public since 1954. An American foundation initiated by James Lord and John Rewald made this possible with funds provided by 114 donors. They bought it from the previous owner Marcel Provence and transferred it to the University of Aix. In 1969 the studio was transferred to the city of Aix. The visitor will find C\u00e9zanne's furniture, easel and palette, the objects that appear in his still lifes, and some original drawings and watercolours.\nDuring their lifetime, most of the residents of Aix mocked their fellow citizen C\u00e9zanne. More recently, they even named a university after their world-famous artist: in 1973 it was founded in Aix-en-Provence, the Paul C\u00e9zanne University with the departments of law and political science, business administration as well as natural sciences and technology. In 2011, it was dissolved and combined with the other two universities in Aix and Marseille to form the University of Aix-Marseille.\nAs a result of their rejection of his works in the past, the Mus\u00e9e Granet in Aix had to make do with a loan of paintings from the Louvre in order to be able to present visitors with C\u00e9zanne, the son of their city. In 1984, the museum received eight paintings and some watercolours, including a motif from the Bathers series and a portrait of Mme C\u00e9zanne. Thanks to another donation in 2000, nine paintings by C\u00e9zanne are now on display there.\nIn 2025, Aix-en-Provence rolled out a \u20ac30\u202fmillion campaign branded \u201cC\u00e9zanne\u202f2025,\u201d including trademarking his name, showcasing 130 works at Mus\u00e9e Granet, opening his studio and restored residences, and partnering globally to borrow rare pieces.\nNotes, references and sources.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was the fifth Avignon pope and the only one with the pontifical name of \"Innocent\".\n\u00c9tienne Aubert, born in the Diocese of Limoges, was a civil law professor and held various positions in the church before being appointed as Cardinal-Bishop of Ostia and Velletri by Pope Clement VI. He became Pope Innocent VI on 30 December 1352. As pope, he revoked an agreement asserting the college of cardinals' superiority over the pope and introduced important reforms in church administration. Through his legate, Cardinal Albornoz, he aimed to restore order in Rome.\nInnocent VI played a significant role in the 1360 Treaty of Br\u00e9tigny between France and England. Though he declined an offer to unite the Greek Orthodox Church with the Roman See in exchange for support, his papacy was marked by financial challenges due to wars in Italy and the aftermath of a plague. To address these challenges, he reduced the chapel staff and sold works of art.\nInnocent VI was a patron of letters and is generally considered just and merciful, although criticized by some, such as St. Bridget of Sweden, for his actions against the Fraticelli. He died on 12 September 1362 and was succeeded by Urban V. His tomb is located in the Chartreuse du Val de B\u00e9n\u00e9diction in Villeneuve-l\u00e8s-Avignon.\nEarly life.\n\u00c9tienne, born during the late 1280s, was the son of Adhemar Aubert, seigneur de Montel-de-Gelat in Limousin province. He was a native of the hamlet of Les Monts, Diocese of Limoges, and, after having taught civil law at Toulouse, he became successively Bishop of Noyon in 1338 and Bishop of Clermont in 1340. On 20 September 1342, he was raised to the position of Cardinal Priest of SS. John and Paul. In September 1347, Etienne, assigned by Pope Clement VI, accompanied Cardinal Annibaldo as part of a peace envoy which resulted in the Truce of Calais.\nEtienne was made cardinal-bishop of Ostia and Velletri on 13 February 1352, by Pope Clement VI, whom he succeeded.\nHis papacy.\nEtienne was crowned pope on 30 December 1352 by Cardinal Gaillard de la Mothe after the papal conclave of 1352. Upon his election, he revoked a signed agreement stating the college of cardinals was superior to the pope. His subsequent policy compares favourably with that of the other Avignon Popes. He introduced many needed reforms in the administration of church affairs, and through his legate, Cardinal Albornoz, who was accompanied by Rienzi, he sought to restore order in Rome. In 1355, Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor, was crowned in Rome with Innocent's permission, after having made an oath that he would quit the city on the day of the ceremony.\nIt was largely through the exertions of Innocent VI that the Treaty of Br\u00e9tigny (1360) between France and England was brought about. During his pontificate, the Byzantine emperor John V Palaeologus offered to submit the Greek Orthodox Church to the Roman See in return for assistance against John VI Cantacuzenus. The resources at the disposal of the Pope, however, were all required for exigencies nearer home, and the offer was declined.\nMost of the wealth accumulated by John XXII and Benedict XII had been lost during the extravagant pontificate of Clement VI. Innocent VI economised by cutting the chapel staff (\"capellani capelle\") from twelve to eight. Works of art were sold rather than commissioned. His pontificate was dominated by the war in Italy and by Avignon's recovery from the plague, both of which made draining demands on his treasury. By 1357, he was complaining of poverty.\nInnocent VI was a liberal patron of letters. If the extreme severity of his measures against the Fraticelli is ignored, he retains a high reputation for justice and mercy. However, St. Bridget of Sweden denounced him as a persecutor of Christians. He died on 12 September 1362 and was succeeded by Urban V. Today, his tomb can be found in the Chartreuse du Val de B\u00e9n\u00e9diction, the Carthusian monastery in Villeneuve-l\u00e8s-Avignon.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "24474", "revid": "43520964", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24474", "title": "Polyandry", "text": "Mating system in which the female partner may have multiple partners\nPolyandry (; from grc \" ' ()\"\u00a0'many' and \" ' ()\"\u00a0'man') is a form of polygamy in which a woman takes two or more husbands at the same time. Polyandry is contrasted with polygyny, involving one male and two or more females. If a marriage involves a plural number of \"husbands and wives\" participants of each gender, then it can be called polygamy, group or conjoint marriage. In its broadest use, polyandry refers to sexual relations with multiple males within or without marriage.\nOf the 1,231 societies listed in the 1980 Ethnographic Atlas, 186 were found to be monogamous, 453 had occasional polygyny, 588 had more frequent polygyny, and four had polyandry. Polyandry is less rare than this figure suggests, as it considered only those examples found in the Himalayan mountain region (eight societies). More recent studies have found at least four other societies practicing polyandry.&lt;ref name=\"Starkweather/Hames 2012\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nFraternal polyandry is practiced among Tibetans in Nepal and parts of China, in which two or more brothers are married to the same wife, with the wife having equal sexual access to them. It is associated with \"partible paternity\", the cultural belief that a child can have more than one father. Several ethnic groups practicing polyandry in India identify their customs with their descent from Draupadi, a central character of the Mahabharata who was married to five brothers, although local practices may not be fraternal themselves.\nPolyandry is believed to be more likely in societies with scarce environmental resources. It is believed to limit human population growth and enhance child survival. It is a rare form of marriage that exists not only among peasant families but also among elite families. For example, polyandry in the Himalayan mountains is related to the scarcity of land. The marriage of all brothers in a family to the same wife allows family land to remain intact and undivided. If every brother married separately and had children, family land would be split into unsustainable small plots. In contrast, very poor persons not owning land were less likely to practice polyandry in Buddhist Ladakh and Zanskar.\nIn Europe, the splitting up of land was prevented through the social practice of impartible inheritance. With most siblings disinherited, many of them became celibate monks and priests.\nTypes.\nSuccessional polyandry.\nUnlike in fraternal polyandry (where a woman will receive a number of husbands simultaneously), in successional polyandry, a woman will acquire one husband after another in sequence.\nThis form is flexible. These men may or may not be related. And it may or may not incorporate a hierarchical system, where one husband is considered primary and may be allotted certain rights or privileges not awarded to secondary husbands, such as biologically fathering a child.\nIn cases where one husband has a primary role, the secondary husbands have the power to succeed the primary if he were to become severely ill or be away from the home for a long period of time or is otherwise rendered incapable of fulfilling his husbandly duties.\nSuccessional polyandry can likewise be egalitarian, where all husbands are equal in status and receive the same rights and privileges. In this system, each husband will have a wedding ceremony and share the paternity of whatever children she may bear.\nAssociated polyandry.\nAnother form of polyandry is a combination of polyandry and polygyny; whereas women are married to several men simultaneously and the same men may marry other women. It is found in some tribes of Africa such as villages in northern Nigeria and northern Cameroon. Usually, one of the woman's husbands will be chosen to be the husband of a woman from another tribe who would also have many husbands; this double-polyandrous union serves to form a marital alliance between tribes.\n\"Other Classifications: Equal polygamy, Polygynandry\"\nThe system results in less land fragmentation, and a diversification of domestic activities.\nFraternal polyandry.\nFraternal polyandry (from the Latin \"frater\"\u2014brother), also called adelphic polyandry (from the Greek \"\"\u2014brother), is a form of polyandry in which a woman is married to two or more men who are brothers. Fraternal polyandry was (and sometimes still is) found in certain areas of Tibet, Nepal, and Northern India, as well as some central African cultures where polyandry was accepted as a social practice. The Toda people of southern India practiced fraternal polyandry, but monogamy has become prevalent recently. In contemporary Hindu society, polyandrous marriages in agrarian societies in the Malwa region of Punjab seem to occur to avoid division of farming land.\nFraternal polyandry achieves a similar goal to that of primogeniture in 19th-century England. Primogeniture dictated that the eldest son inherited the family estate, while younger sons had to leave home and seek their own employment. Primogeniture maintained family estates intact over generations by permitting only one heir per generation. Fraternal polyandry also accomplishes this, but does so by keeping all the brothers together with just one wife so that there is only one set of heirs per generation. This strategy appears less successful the larger the fraternal sibling group is.\nSome forms of polyandry appear to be associated with a perceived need to retain aristocratic titles or agricultural lands within kin groups, and/or because of the frequent absence, for long periods, of a man from the household. In Tibet the practice was particularly popular among the priestly Sakya class.\nThe female equivalent of fraternal polyandry is sororate marriage.\nPartible paternity.\nAnthropologist Stephen Beckerman points out that at least 20 tribal societies accept that a child could, and ideally should, have more than one father, referring to it as \"partible paternity\". This often results in the shared nurture of a child by multiple fathers in a form of polyandric relation to the mother, although this is not always the case. One of the most well known examples is that of Trobriand \"virgin birth\". The matrilineal Trobriand Islanders recognize the importance of sex in reproduction but do not believe the male makes a contribution to the constitution of the child, who therefore remains attached to their mother's lineage alone. The mother's non-resident husbands are not recognized as fathers, although the mother's co-resident brothers are, since they are part of the mother's lineage.\nCulture.\nAccording to inscriptions describing the reforms of the Sumerian king Urukagina of Lagash (c.\u20092300 BC), the earlier custom of polyandry in his country was abolished, on pain of the woman taking multiple husbands being stoned with stones upon which her crime was written.\nAn extreme gender imbalance has been suggested as a justification for polyandry. For example, the selective abortion of female children in India has led to a significant margin in sex ratio and, it has been suggested, results in related men \"sharing\" a wife.\nKnown cases.\nPolyandry in Tibet was a common practice and continues to a lesser extent today. A survey of 753 Tibetan families by Tibet University in 1988 found that 13% practiced polyandry. Polyandry in India still exists among minorities, and also in Bhutan, and the northern parts of Nepal. Polyandry has been practised in several parts of India, such as Rajasthan, Ladakh and Zanskar, in the Jaunsar-Bawar region in Uttarakhand, among the Toda of South India.\nIt also occurs or has occurred in Nigeria, the Nymba, Irigwe and some pre-contact Polynesian societies, though probably only among higher caste women. It is also encountered in some regions of Yunnan and Sichuan regions of China, among the Mosuo people in China (who also practice polygyny as well), and among some sub-Saharan Africans such as the Maasai people in Kenya and northern Tanzania and American indigenous communities. The Guanches, the first known inhabitants of the Canary Islands, practiced polyandry until Spanish colonization. The Zo'e tribe in the state of Par\u00e1 on the Cuminapanema River, Brazil, also practice polyandry.\nReligious attitudes.\nHinduism.\nThere is at least one reference to polyandry in the ancient Hindu epic \"Mahabharata\". Draupadi married the five Pandava brothers, as this is what she chose in a previous life. This ancient text remains largely neutral to the concept of polyandry, accepting this as her way of life. However, in the same epic, when questioned by Kunti to give an example of polyandry, Yudhishthira cites Jatila of the lineage of Gautama (married to the seven Saptarishi) and Hiranyaksha's sister Pracheti (married to ten brothers), thereby implying a more open attitude toward polyandry in Hindu society.\nJudaism.\nThe Hebrew Bible contains no examples of women married to more than one man, but its description of adultery clearly implies that polyandry is unacceptable and the practice is unknown in Jewish tradition. In addition, the children from other than the first husband are considered illegitimate (i.e., mamzers), unless he has already divorced her or died, being a product of an adulterous relationship.\nChristianity.\nMost Christian denominations in the Western world strongly advocate monogamous marriage, and a passage from the Pauline epistles can be interpreted as forbidding polyandry.\nLatter-Day Saints.\nJoseph Smith, Brigham Young, and other prominent early Mormons like Zina D. H. Young, Sarah M. Cleveland, Heber C. Kimball, and Orson Hyde, practiced religious polyandry beginning in the mid-1800s. The performance of new polygamous marriages in the Latter Day Saint movement's largest denomination, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), was partially ended by the 1890 Manifesto, and completely discontinued by the 1904 Second Manifesto. Existing polygamous marriages, including those of prominent LDS Church leaders, continued into the 1950s.\nIslam.\nAccording to Islamic marital law, polyandry is forbidden.\nIn biology.\nPolyandrous behaviour exists in the animal kingdom, occurring for example in certain insects, fish, birds, and mammals.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nTypes of mating, marriage and lifestyle:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

When a man is married to more than one wife at the same time, it is called polygyny. When a woman is married to more than one husband at the same time, it is called polyandry. In contrast, in sociobiology and zoology, researchers use \"polygamy\" more broadly to refer to any form of multiple mating.\nIn contrast to polygamy, monogamy is marriage consisting of only two parties. Like \"monogamy\", the term \"polygamy\" is often used in a \"de facto\" sense, applied regardless of whether a state recognizes the relationship. In many countries, the law only recognises monogamous marriages (a person can only have one spouse, and bigamy is illegal), but adultery is not illegal, leading to a situation of \"de facto\" polygamy being allowed without legal recognition for non-official \"spouses\".\nWorldwide, different societies variously encourage, accept or outlaw polygamy. In societies which allow or tolerate polygamy, polygyny is the accepted form in the vast majority of cases. According to the \"Ethnographic Atlas Codebook\", of 1,231 societies noted from 1960 to 1980, 588 had frequent polygyny, 453 had occasional polygyny, 186 were monogamous, and 4 had polyandry\u00a0\u2013 although more recent research found some form of polyandry in 53 communities, which is more common than previously thought. In cultures which practice polygamy, its prevalence among that population often correlates with social class and socioeconomic status. Polygamy (taking the form of polygyny) is most common in a region known as the \"polygamy belt\" in West Africa and Central Africa, with the countries estimated to have the highest polygamy prevalence in the world being Burkina Faso, Mali, Gambia, Niger and Nigeria.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBiological and social distinctions.\nThe term \"polygamy\" may be referring to one of various relational types, depending upon context. Four overlapping definitions can be adapted from the work of Ulrich Reichard and others:\nBiologists, biological anthropologists, and behavioral ecologists often use \"polygamy\" in the sense of a lack of sexual or genetic (reproductive) exclusivity. When cultural or social anthropologists and other social scientists use the term polygamy, the meaning is social or marital polygamy.\nIn contrast, marital monogamy may be distinguished between:\nOutside of the legal sphere, defining polygamy can be difficult because of differences in cultural assumptions regarding monogamy. Some societies believe that monogamy requires limiting sexual activity to a single partner for life. Others accept or endorse pre-marital sex prior to marriage. Some societies consider sex outside of marriage or \"spouse swapping\" to be socially acceptable. Some consider a relationship monogamous even if partners separate and move to a new monogamous relationship through death, divorce, or simple dissolution of the relationship, regardless of the length of the relationship (serial monogamy). Anthropologists characterize human beings as \"mildly polygynous\" or \"monogamous with polygynous tendencies.\" The average pre-historic man with modern descendants appears to have had children with between 1.5 women (70,000 years ago) to 3.3 women (45,000 years ago), except in East Asia. While the forms of non-monogamy in prehistorical times is unknown, these rates could be consistent with a society that practices serial monogamy. Anthropological observations indicate that even when polygyny is accepted in the community, the majority of relationships in the society are monogamous in practice \u2013 while couples remain in the relationship, which may not be lifelong. Thus, in many historical communities, serial monogamy may have been the accepted practice rather than a lifelong monogamous bond. The genetic record indicates that monogamy increased within the last 5,000-10,000 years, a period associated with the development of human agriculture, non-communal land ownership, and inheritance.\nForms.\nPolygamy exists in three specific forms:\nPolygyny.\nIncidence.\nPolygyny, the practice wherein a man has more than one wife at the same time, is by far the most common form of polygamy. Many Muslim-majority countries and some countries with sizable Muslim minorities accept polygyny to varying extents both legally and culturally. In several countries, such as India, the law only recognizes polygamous marriages for the Muslim population. Islamic law or \"sharia\" is a religious law forming part of the Islamic tradition which allows polygyny. It is derived from the religious precepts of Islam, particularly the Quran and the hadith. In Arabic, the term \"shar\u012b\u02bfah\" refers to God's (Arabic: \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 All\u0101h) immutable divine law and is contrasted with \"fiqh\", which refers to its human scholarly interpretations.\nPolygyny is more widespread in Africa than on any other continent, especially in West Africa, and some scholars see the slave trade's impact on the male-to-female sex ratio as a key factor in the emergence and fortification of polygynous practices in regions of Africa. In the region of sub-Saharan Africa, polygyny is common and deeply rooted in the culture, with 11% of the population of sub-Saharan Africa living in such marriages (25% of the Muslim population and 3% of the Christian population, as of 2019). According to Pew, polygamy is widespread in a cluster of countries in West and Central Africa, including Burkina Faso, (36%), Mali (34%) and Nigeria (28%).\nAnthropologist Jack Goody's comparative study of marriage around the world utilizing the Ethnographic Atlas demonstrated a historical correlation between the practice of extensive shifting horticulture and polygamy in the majority of sub-Saharan African societies. Drawing on the work of Ester Boserup, Goody notes that the sexual division of labour varies between the male-dominated intensive plough-agriculture common in Eurasia and the extensive shifting horticulture found in sub-Saharan Africa. In some of the sparsely populated regions where shifting cultivation takes place in Africa, women do much of the work. This favours polygamous marriages in which men seek to monopolize the production of women \"who are valued both as workers and as child bearers\". Goody however, observes that the correlation is imperfect and varied, and also discusses more traditionally male-dominated though relatively extensive farming systems such as those traditionally common in much of West Africa, especially in the West African savanna, where more agricultural work is done by men, and where polygyny is desired by men more for the generation of male offspring whose labor is valued.\nAnthropologists Douglas R. White and Michael L. Burton discuss and support Jack Goody's observation regarding African male farming systems in \"Causes of Polygyny: Ecology, Economy, Kinship, and Warfare\" where these authors note:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Goody (1973) argues against the female contributions hypothesis. He notes Dorjahn's (1959) comparison of East and West Africa, showing higher female agricultural contributions in East Africa and higher polygyny rates in West Africa, especially the West African savanna, where one finds especially high male agricultural contributions. Goody says, \"The reasons behind polygyny are sexual and reproductive rather than economic and productive\" (1973:189), arguing that men marry polygynously to maximize their fertility and to obtain large households containing many young dependent males.\nAn analysis by James Fenske (2012) found that child mortality and ecologically related economic shocks had a significant association with rates of polygamy in sub-Saharan Africa, rather than female agricultural contributions (which are typically relatively small in the West African savanna and sahel, where polygyny rates are higher), finding that polygyny rates decrease significantly with child mortality rates.\nTypes of polygyny.\nPolygynous marriages fall into two types: \"sororal polygyny\", in which the co-wives are sisters, and \"non-sororal\", where the co-wives are not related. Polygyny offers husbands the benefit of allowing them to have more children, may provide them with a larger number of productive workers (where workers are family), and allows them to establish politically useful ties with a greater number of kin groups. Senior wives can benefit as well when the addition of junior wives to the family lightens their workload. Wives', especially senior wives', status in a community can increase through the addition of other wives, who add to the family's prosperity or symbolize conspicuous consumption (much as a large house, domestic help, or expensive vacations operate in a western country). For such reasons, senior wives sometimes work hard or contribute from their own resources to enable their husbands to accumulate the bride price for an extra wife.\nPolygyny may also result from the practice of levirate marriage. In such cases, the deceased man's heir may inherit his assets and wife; or, more usually, his brothers may marry the widow. This provides support for the widow and her children (usually also members of the brothers' kin group) and maintains the tie between the husbands' and wives' kin groups. The sororate resembles the levirate, in that a widower must marry the sister of his dead wife. The family of the late wife, in other words, must provide a replacement for her, thus maintaining the marriage alliance. Both levirate and sororate may result in a man having multiple wives.\nIn monogamous societies, wealthy and powerful men may establish enduring relationships with, and established separate household for, multiple female partners, aside from their legitimate wives; a practice accepted in Imperial China up until the Qing dynasty (1644\u20131912). This constitutes a form of \"de\u00a0facto\" polygyny referred to as \"concubinage\".\nHousehold organization.\nMarriage is the moment at which a new household is formed, but different arrangements may occur depending upon the type of marriage and some polygamous marriages do not result in the formation of a single household. In many polygynous marriages the husband's wives may live in separate households. They can thus be described as a \"series of linked nuclear families with a 'father' in common\".\nPolyandry.\nIncidence.\nPolyandry, the practice of a woman having more than one husband at one time, is much less prevalent than polygyny. It is specifically provided in the legal codes of some countries, such as Gabon.\nPolyandry is believed to be more common in societies with scarce environmental resources, as it is believed to limit human population growth and enhance child survival. It is a rare form of marriage that exists not only among poor families, but also the elite. For example, in the Himalayan Mountains polyandry is related to the scarcity of land; the marriage of all brothers in a family to the same wife allows family land to remain intact and undivided. If every brother married separately and had children, family land would be split into unsustainable small plots. In Europe, this outcome was avoided through the social practice of impartible inheritance, under which most siblings would be disinherited.\nTypes.\n\"Fraternal polyandry\" was traditionally practiced among nomadic Tibetans in Nepal, parts of China and part of northern India, in which two or more brothers would marry the same woman. It is most common in societies marked by high male mortality. It is associated with \"partible paternity\", the cultural belief that a child can have more than one father.\n\"Non-fraternal polyandry\" occurs when the wives' husbands are unrelated, as among the Nayar tribe of India, where girls undergo a ritual marriage before puberty, and the first husband is acknowledged as the father of all her children. However, the woman may never cohabit with that man, taking multiple lovers instead; these men must acknowledge the paternity of their children (and hence demonstrate that no caste prohibitions have been breached) by paying the midwife. The women remain in their maternal home, living with their brothers, and property is passed matrilineally. A similar form of matrilineal, de facto polyandry can be found in the institution of walking marriage among the Mosuo tribe of China.\nSerial monogamy.\nSerial monogamy refers to remarriage after divorce or death of a spouse from a monogamous marriage, i.e. multiple marriages but only one legal spouse at a time (a series of monogamous relationships).\nAccording to Danish scholar Miriam K. Zeitzen, anthropologists treat serial monogamy, in which divorce and remarriage occur, as a form of polygamy as it also can establish a series of households that may continue to be tied by shared paternity and shared income. As such, they are similar to the household formations created through divorce and serial monogamy.\nSerial monogamy creates a new kind of relative, the \"ex-\". The \"ex-wife\", for example, can remain an active part of her \"ex-husband's\" life, as they may be tied together by legally or informally mandated economic support, which can last for years, including by alimony, child support, and joint custody. Bob Simpson, the British social anthropologist, notes that it creates an \"extended family\" by tying together a number of households, including mobile children. He says that Britons may have ex\u2011wives or ex\u2011brothers\u2011in\u2011law, but not an \"ex\u2011child\". According to him, these \"unclear families\" do not fit the mold of the monogamous nuclear family.\nGroup marriage.\nGroup marriage is a non-monogamous marriage-like arrangement where three or more adults live together, all considering themselves partners, sharing finances, children, and household responsibilities. Polyamory is on a continuum of family-bonds that includes group marriage. The term does not refer to bigamy as no claim to being married in formal legal terms is made.\nScientific and prehistorical perspectives.\nScientific studies classify humans as \"mildly polygynous\" or \"monogamous with polygynous tendencies.\" As mentioned above, data from 1960 to 1980 in the \"Ethnographic Atlas Codebook\" indicated that polygamy was common. A separate 1988 review examined the practices of 849 societies from before Western imperialism and colonization. The review found that 708 of the societies (83%) accepted polygyny. Only 16% were monogamous and 1% polyandrous. Subsequent evidence in 2012 found that polyandry (in which women have multiple male partners) was likely in pre-history; it also identified 53 communities studied between 1912 and 2010 with either formal or informal polyandry, indicating that polyandry was more common worldwide than previously believed. The authors found that polyandry was most common in egalitarian societies, and suspected contributors to polyandry included fewer men (due to the existence or threat of high adult male mortality or absence/travel) and higher male contributions towards food production. Polyandry still appears to occur in the minority of societies. Regardless of the type of polygamy, even when polygyny is accepted in the community, the majority of relationships in the society are monogamous in practice \u2013 while couples remain in the relationship, which may not be lifelong. In many historical communities, serial monogamy may have been the accepted practice rather than a lifelong monogamous bond. How monogamy is defined when it comes to accepted sexual activity outside of the relationship, however, may differ by society.\nRecent anthropological data suggest that the modern concept of life-long monogamy has been in place for only the last 1,000 years. Genetic evidence has demonstrated that a greater proportion of men began contributing to the genetic pool between 5,000 and 10,000 years ago, which suggests that reproductive monogamy became more common at that time. This would correspond to the Neolithic agricultural revolution. During this time, formerly nomadic societies began to claim and settle land for farming, leading to the advent of property ownership and therefore inheritance. Men would therefore seek to ensure that their land would go to direct descendants and had a vested interest in limiting the sexual activities of their reproductive partners. It is possible that the concept of marriage and permanent monogamy evolved at this time.\nOther scientific arguments for monogamy prior to 2003 were based on characteristics of reproductive physiology, such as sperm competition, sexual selection in primates, and body size characteristics. A 2019 synthesis of these and other data found that the weight of the evidence supports a mating bond that may include polygyny or polyandry, but is most likely to be predominantly serial monogamy.\nMore recent genetic data has clarified that, in most regions throughout history, a smaller proportion of men contributed to human genetic history compared to women. Assuming an equal number of men and women are born and survive to reproduce, this would indicate that historically, only a subset of men fathered children and did so with multiple women (and may suggest that many men either did not procreate or did not have children that survived to create modern ancestors). This circumstance could occur for several reasons, but there are three common interpretations:\nThe serial monogamy interpretation of genetic history would be congruent with other findings, such as the fact that humans form pair bonds (although not necessarily for life) and that human fathers invest in at least the early upbringing of their children. Serial monogamy would also be consistent with the existence of a \"honeymoon period\", a period of intense interest in a single sexual partner (with less interest in other women) which may help to keep men invested in staying with the mother of their child for this period. When reciprocated, this \"honeymoon period\" lasts 18 months to three years in most cases. This would correspond to the period necessary to bring a child to relative independence in the traditionally small, interdependent, communal societies of pre-Neolithic humans, before they settled into agricultural communities.\nWhile genetic evidence typically displays a bias towards a smaller number of men reproducing with more women, some regions or time periods have shown the opposite. In a 2019 investigation, Musharoff et al. applied modern techniques to the 1000 Genomes Project Phase 3 high-coverage Complete Genomics whole-genome dataset. They found that the Southern Han Chinese had a male bias (45% female, indicating that women were likely to reproduce with multiple men). This region is known for its lack of a concept of paternity and for a sense of female equality or superiority. The Musharoff study also found a male bias in Europeans (20% female) during an out-of-Africa migration event that may have increased the number of men successfully reproducing with women, perhaps by replenishing the genetic pool in Europe. The study did confirm a more typical female bias in Yorubans (63% female), Europeans (84%), Punjabis (82%), and Peruvians (56%).\nReligious attitudes towards polygamy.\nBuddhism.\nBuddhism does not regard marriage as a sacrament; it is purely a secular affair. Normally Buddhist monks do not participate in it (though in some sects priests and monks do marry). Hence marriage receives no religious sanction. Forms of marriage, in consequence, vary from country to country. The Parabhava Sutta states that \"a man who is not satisfied with one woman and seeks out other women is on the path to decline\". Other fragments in the Buddhist scripture seem to treat polygamy unfavorably, leading some authors to conclude that Buddhism generally does not approve of it or alternatively regards it as a tolerated, but subordinate, marital model.\nPolygamy in Thailand was legally recognized until 1935. Polygamy in Myanmar was outlawed in 2015. In Sri Lanka, polyandry was legal in the kingdom of Kandy, but outlawed by British after conquering the kingdom in 1815. When the Buddhist texts were translated into Chinese, the concubines of others were added to the list of inappropriate partners. Polyandry in Tibet was traditionally common, as was polygyny, and having several wives or husbands was never regarded as having sex with inappropriate partners.\nMost typically, fraternal polyandry is practiced, but sometimes father and son have a common wife, which is a unique family structure in the world. Other forms of marriage are also present, like group marriage and monogamous marriage. Polyandry (especially fraternal polyandry) is also common in Tibet\nCeltic traditions.\nSome pre-Christian Celtic pagans were known to practice polygamy, although the Celtic peoples wavered between it, monogamy and polyandry depending on the time period and the area. In some areas this continued even after Christianization began, for instance the Brehon Laws of Gaelic Ireland explicitly allowed for polygamy, especially amongst the noble class. Some modern Celtic pagan religions accept the practice of polygamy to varying degrees, though how widespread the practice is within these religions is unknown.\nChristianity.\nAlthough the Old Testament describes numerous examples of polygamy among devotees to God, most Christian groups have rejected the practice of polygamy and have upheld monogamy alone as normative. Nevertheless, some Christians groups in different periods have practiced, or currently do practice, polygamy. Some Christians actively debate whether the New Testament or Christian ethics allows or forbids polygamy.\nIn the New Testament, Jesus recalled the earlier scriptures, noting that a man and a wife \"shall become one flesh\". \nPaul stated in one of his letters that \"For the wife does not have authority over her own body, but the husband does. Likewise the husband does not have authority over his own body, but the wife does\".\nHowever, some look to Paul's writings to the Corinthians: \"Do you not know that he who is joined to a prostitute becomes one body with her? For, as it is written, 'The two will become one flesh.'\" Supporters of polygamy claim that this verse indicates that the term refers to a physical, rather than a spiritual, union. Such a claim also contradicts Paul's statement regarding authority other each other's bodies.\nSome Christian theologians argue that in Matthew 19:3\u20139 and referring to Genesis 2:24, Jesus explicitly states a man should have only one wife:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Have ye not read, that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female, And said, For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife: and they twain shall be one flesh?\n1 Timothy 3:2 states:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Now a bishop must be above reproach, married only once, temperate, sensible, respectable, hospitable, an apt teacher, See verse 12 regarding deacons having only one wife. Similar counsel is repeated in the first chapter of the Epistle to Titus.\nPeriodically, Christian reform movements that have sought to rebuild Christian doctrine based on the Bible alone (\"sola scriptura\") have temporarily accepted polygyny as a Biblical practice. For example, during the Protestant Reformation, in a document which was simply referred to as \"Der Beichtrat\" (or \"The Confessional Advice\" ), Martin Luther granted the Landgrave Philip of Hesse, who, for many years, had been living \"constantly in a state of adultery and fornication\", a dispensation to take a second wife. The double marriage was to be done in secret, however, to avoid public scandal. Some fifteen years earlier, in a letter to the Saxon Chancellor Gregor Br\u00fcck, Luther stated that he could not \"forbid a person to marry several wives, for it does not contradict Scripture.\" (\"Ego sane fateor, me non posse prohibere, si quis plures velit uxores ducere, nec repugnat sacris literis.\")\nIn Sub-Saharan Africa, tensions have frequently erupted between advocates of the Christian insistence on monogamy and advocates of the traditional practice of polygamy. For instance, Mswati III, the Christian king of Eswatini, has 15 wives. In some instances in recent times, there have been moves for accommodation; in other instances, churches have strongly resisted such moves. African Independent Churches have sometimes referred to those parts of the Old Testament that describe polygamy in defense of the practice.\nThe illegality of polygamy in certain areas creates, according to certain Bible passages, additional arguments against it. Paul the Apostle writes \"submit to the authorities, not only because of possible punishment but also because of conscience\" (Romans 13:5), for \"the authorities that exist have been established by God.\" (Romans 13:1) St Peter concurs when he says to \"submit yourselves for the Lord's sake to every authority instituted among men: whether to the king, as the supreme authority, or to governors, who are sent by him to punish those who do wrong and to commend those who do right.\" (1 Peter 2:13,14) Pro-polygamists argue that, as long as polygamists currently do not obtain legal marriage licenses nor seek \"common law marriage status\" for additional spouses, no enforced laws are being broken any more than when monogamous couples similarly co-habitate without a marriage license.\nRoman Catholic Church.\nThe Roman Catholic Church condemns polygamy; the \"Catechism of the Catholic Church\" lists it in paragraph 2387 under the head \"Other offenses against the dignity of marriage\" and states that it \"is not in accord with the moral law.\" Also in paragraph 1645 under the head \"The Goods and Requirements of Conjugal Love\" states \"The unity of marriage, distinctly recognized by our Lord, is made clear in the equal personal dignity which must be accorded to husband and wife in mutual and unreserved affection. Polygamy is contrary to conjugal love which is undivided and exclusive.\"\nSaint Augustine saw a conflict with Old Testament polygamy. He refrained from judging the patriarchs, but did not deduce from their practice the ongoing acceptability of polygyny. On the contrary, he argued that the polygamy of the Fathers, which was tolerated by the Creator because of fertility, was a diversion from His original plan for human marriage. Augustine wrote: \"That the good purpose of marriage, however, is better promoted by one husband with one wife, than by a husband with several wives, is shown plainly enough by the very first union of a married pair, which was made by the Divine Being Himself.\"\nAugustine taught that the reason patriarchs had many wives was not because of fornication, but because they wanted more children. He supported his premise by showing that their marriages, in which husband was the head, were arranged according to the rules of good management: those who are \"in command\" (\"quae principantur\") in their society were always singular, while \"subordinates\" (\"subiecta\") were multiple. He gave two examples of such relationships: \"dominus-servus\" \u2013 master-servant (in older translation: \"slave\") and \"God-soul\". The Bible often equates worshiping multiple gods, i.e. idolatry to fornication. Augustine relates to that: \"On this account there is no True God of souls, save One: but one soul by means of many false gods may commit fornication, but not be made fruitful.\"\nAs tribal populations grew, fertility was no longer a valid justification of polygamy: it \"was lawful among the ancient fathers: whether it be lawful now also, I would not hastily pronounce (utrum et nunc fas sit, non temere dixerim). For there is not now necessity of begetting children, as there then was, when, even when wives bear children, it was allowed, in order to a more numerous posterity, to marry other wives in addition, which now is certainly not lawful.\"\nAugustine saw marriage as a covenant between one man and one woman, which may not be broken. It was the Creator who established monogamy: \"Therefore, the first natural bond of human society is man and wife.\" Such marriage was confirmed by the Saviour in the Gospel of Matthew (Mat 19:9) and by His presence at the wedding in Cana (John 2:2). In the Church\u2014the City of God\u2014marriage is a sacrament and may not and cannot be dissolved as long as the spouses live: \"But a marriage once for all entered upon in the City of our God, where, even from the first union of the two, the man and the woman, marriage bears a certain sacramental character, can in no way be dissolved but by the death of one of them.\" In chapter 7, Augustine pointed out that the Roman Empire forbad polygamy, even if the reason of fertility would support it: \"For it is in a man's power to put away a wife that is barren, and marry one of whom to have children. And yet it is not allowed; and now indeed in our times, and after the usage of Rome (nostris quidem iam temporibus ac more Romano), neither to marry in addition, so as to have more than one wife living.\" Further on he notices that the Church's attitude goes much further than the secular law regarding monogamy: It forbids remarrying, considering such to be a form of fornication: \"And yet, save in the City of our God, in His Holy Mount, the case is not such with the wife. But, that the laws of the Gentiles are otherwise, who is there that knows not.\"\nThe Council of Trent condemns polygamy: \"If anyone saith, that it is lawful for Christians to have several wives at the same time, and that this is not prohibited by any divine law; let him be anathema.\"\nIn modern times a minority of Roman Catholic theologians have argued that polygamy, though not ideal, can be a legitimate form of Christian marriage in certain regions, in particular Africa. The Roman Catholic Church teaches in its Catechism that: \npolygamy is not in accord with the moral law. [Conjugal] communion is radically contradicted by polygamy; this, in fact, directly negates the plan of God that was revealed from the beginning, because it is contrary to the equal personal dignity of men and women who in matrimony give themselves with a love that is total and therefore unique and exclusive.\nLutheran Church.\nThe Lutheran World Federation hosted a regional conference in Africa, in which the acceptance of polygamists into full membership by the Lutheran Church in Liberia was defended as being permissible. The Lutheran Church in Liberia, however, does not permit polygamists who have become Christians to marry more wives after they have received the sacrament of Holy Baptism. Evangelical Lutheran missionaries in Maasai also tolerate the practice of polygamy and in Southern Sudan, some polygamists are becoming Lutheran Christians.\nAnglican Communion.\nThe 1988 Lambeth Conference of the Anglican Communion ruled that polygamy was permissible in certain circumstances:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The Conference upholds monogamy as God's plan, as the idea of relationship of love between husband and wife; nevertheless recommends that a polygamist who responds to the Gospel and wishes to join the Anglican Church may be baptized and confirmed with his believing wives and children on the following conditions: \nLatter Day Saint movement.\nIn accordance with what Joseph Smith indicated was a revelation, the practice of plural marriage, the marriage of one man to two or more women, was instituted among members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in the early 1840s. Despite Smith's revelation, the 1835 edition of the 101st Section of the \"Doctrine and Covenants\", written after the doctrine of plural marriage began to be practiced, publicly condemned polygamy. This scripture was used by John Taylor in 1850 to quash Mormon polygamy rumors in Liverpool, England. Polygamy was made illegal in the state of Illinois during the 1839\u201344 Nauvoo era when several top Mormon leaders, including Smith, Brigham Young and Heber C. Kimball took multiple wives. Mormon elders who publicly taught that all men were commanded to enter plural marriage were subject to harsh discipline. On 7 June 1844 the \"Nauvoo Expositor\" criticized Smith for plural marriage.\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church).\nAfter Joseph Smith was killed by a mob on 27 June 1844, the main body of Latter Day Saints left Nauvoo and followed Brigham Young to Utah where the practice of plural marriage continued. In 1852, Brigham Young, the second president of the LDS Church, publicly acknowledged the practice of plural marriage through a sermon he gave. Additional sermons by top Mormon leaders on the virtues of polygamy followed. Controversy followed when polygamy became a social cause, writers began to publish works condemning polygamy. The key plank of the Republican Party's 1856 platform was \"to prohibit in the territories those twin relics of barbarism, polygamy and slavery\". In 1862, Congress issued the Morrill Anti-Bigamy Act which clarified that the practice of polygamy was illegal in all US territories. The LDS Church believed that their religiously based practice of plural marriage was protected by the United States Constitution, however, the unanimous 1878 Supreme Court decision \"Reynolds v. United States\" declared that polygamy was not protected by the Constitution, based on the longstanding legal principle that \"laws are made for the government of actions, and while they cannot interfere with mere religious belief and opinions, they may with practices.\"\nIncreasingly harsh anti-polygamy legislation in the US led some Mormons to emigrate to Canada and Mexico. In 1890, LDS Church president Wilford Woodruff issued a public declaration (the Manifesto) announcing that the LDS Church had discontinued new plural marriages. Anti-Mormon sentiment waned, as did opposition to statehood for Utah. The Smoot Hearings in 1904, which documented that the LDS Church was still practicing polygamy spurred the LDS Church to issue a Second Manifesto again claiming that it had ceased performing new plural marriages. By 1910 the LDS Church excommunicated those who entered into, or performed, new plural marriages. Even so, many plural husbands and wives continued to cohabit until their deaths in the 1940s and 1950s.\nEnforcement of the 1890 Manifesto caused various splinter groups to leave the LDS Church in order to continue the practice of plural marriage. Polygamy among these groups persists today in Utah and neighboring states as well as in the spin-off colonies. Polygamist churches of Mormon origin are often referred to as \"Mormon fundamentalist\" churches even though they are not parts of the LDS Church. Such fundamentalists often use a purported 1886 revelation to John Taylor as the basis for their authority to continue the practice of plural marriage. \"The Salt Lake Tribune\" stated in 2005 that there were as many as 37,000 fundamentalists with less than half of them living in polygamous households.\nOn 13 December 2013, US Federal Judge Clark Waddoups ruled in \"Brown v. Buhman\" that the portions of Utah's anti-polygamy laws which prohibit multiple cohabitation were unconstitutional, but also allowed Utah to maintain its ban on multiple marriage licenses. Unlawful cohabitation, where prosecutors did not need to prove that a marriage ceremony had taken place (only that a couple had lived together), had been the primary tool used to prosecute polygamy in Utah since the 1882 Edmunds Act.\nMormon fundamentalism.\nThe Council of Friends (also known as the Woolley Group and the Priesthood Council) was one of the original expressions of Mormon fundamentalism, having its origins in the teachings of Lorin C. Woolley, a dairy farmer excommunicated from the LDS Church in 1924. Several Mormon fundamentalist groups claim lineage through the Council of Friends, including but not limited to, the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (FLDS Church), the Apostolic United Brethren, the Centennial Park group, the Latter Day Church of Christ, and the Righteous Branch of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\nCommunity of Christ.\nThe Community of Christ, known as the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (RLDS Church) prior to 2001, has never sanctioned polygamy since its foundation in 1860. Joseph Smith\u00a0III, the first Prophet-President of the RLDS Church following the reorganization of the Church, was an ardent opponent of the practice of plural marriage throughout his life. For most of his career, Smith denied that his father had been involved in the practice and insisted that it had originated with Brigham Young. Smith served many missions to the western United States, where he met with and interviewed associates and women claiming to be widows of his father, who attempted to present him with evidence to the contrary. Smith typically responded to such accusations by saying that he was \"not positive nor sure that [his father] was innocent\", and that if, indeed, the elder Smith had been involved, it was still a false practice. However, many members of the Community of Christ and some of the groups that were previously associated with it are not convinced that Joseph Smith practiced plural marriage and they believe that the evidence which indicates that he practiced it is flawed.\nHinduism.\nThe \"Rigveda\" mentions that during the Vedic period, a man could have more than one wife. The practice is attested in epics like the \"Ramayana\" and the \"Mahabharata\". The \"Dharmashastra\"s permit a man to marry women provided that the first wife agree to marry him. Despite its existence, it was most usually practiced by men of higher status. Common people were only allowed a second marriage if the first wife could not bear a son or have some dispute because there is no law for divorce in Hinduism.\nAccording to the \"Vishnu Smriti\", the number of wives one could have is linked to one's social class, referred to as \"varna\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Now a Br\u0101hma\u1e47a may take many wives in the direct order of the (four) knowledge;A Kshatriya means warrior knowledge, three;A Vaishya means business knowledge, two;A Shudra means cleaning knowledge, one only\nThis linkage of the number of permitted wives to the varna system is also supported by the \"Baudhayana\" \"Dharmasutra\" and the \"Paraskara Grihyasutra\".\nThe \"Apastamba Dharmasutra\" and the \"Manusmriti\" allow marriage to a second wife if the first one is unable to discharge her religious duties or is unable to bear a child or have any dispute because in Hinduism there was no law for divorce.\nFor a Brahmana, only one wife could rank as the chief consort who performed the religious rites (\"dharma-patni\") along with the husband. The chief consort had to be of an equal knowledge. If a man married several women from the same knowledgeable, then the eldest wife held the position of the chief consort. Hindu kings commonly had more than one wife and are regularly attributed four wives by the scriptures. They were: Mahisi, who was the chief consort, Parivrkti, who had no son, Vaivata, who is considered the favorite wife and the Palagali, who was the daughter of the last of the court officials.\nTraditional Hindu law allowed polygamy if the first wife could not bear a child.\nThe Hindu Marriage Act was enacted in 1955 by the Indian Parliament and made polygamy illegal for everyone in India except for Muslims. Prior to 1955, polygamy was permitted for Hindus. Marriage laws in India are dependent upon the religion of the parties in question.\nSome Hindus in Indonesia and Bangladesh practice polygamy.\nIslam.\nIn Islamic marital jurisprudence, under warranted conditions, a Muslim man may have more than one wife at the same time, up to a total of four. Muslim women are not permitted to have more than one husband at the same time under any circumstances.\nBased on verse 30:21 of Quran the ideal relationship is the comfort that a couple find in each other's embrace:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;And one of His signs is that He created for you spouses from among yourselves so that you may find comfort in them. And He has placed between you compassion and mercy. Surely in this are signs for people who reflect.\nThe polygyny that is allowed in the Quran is for special situations. There are strict requirements to marrying more than one woman, as the man must treat them fairly financially and in terms of support given to each wife, according to Islamic law. However, Islam advises monogamy for a man if he fears he cannot deal justly with his wives. This is based on verse 4:3 of Quran which says:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;If you fear you might fail to give orphan women their \u02f9due\u02fa rights \u02f9if you were to marry them\u02fa, then marry other women of your choice\u2014two, three, or four. But if you are afraid you will fail to maintain justice, then \u02f9content yourselves with\u02fa one or those \u02f9bondwomen\u02fa in your possession. This way you are less likely to commit injustice.\nMuslim women are not allowed to marry more than one husband at once. However, in the case of a divorce or their husbands' death they can remarry after the completion of Iddah, as divorce is legal in Islamic law. A non-Muslim woman who flees from her non-Muslim husband and accepts Islam has the option to remarry without divorce from her previous husband, as her marriage with non-Muslim husband is Islamically dissolved on her fleeing. A non-Muslim woman captured during war by Muslims, can also remarry, as her marriage with her non-Muslim husband is Islamically dissolved at capture by Muslim soldiers. This permission is given to such women in verse 4:24 of Quran. The verse also emphasizes on transparency, mutual agreement and financial compensation as prerequisites for matrimonial relationship as opposed to prostitution; it says:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Also \u02f9forbidden are\u02fa married women\u2014except \u02f9female\u02fa captives in your possession. This is Allah's commandment to you. Lawful to you are all beyond these\u2014as long as you seek them with your wealth in a legal marriage, not in fornication. Give those you have consummated marriage with their due dowries. It is permissible to be mutually gracious regarding the set dowry. Surely Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.\nMuhammad was monogamously married to Khadija, his first wife, for 25 years, until she died. After her death, he married multiple women. Muhammad had a total of 9 wives at the same time, even though Muslim men were limited to 4 wives. His total wives are 11.\nOne reason cited for polygyny is that it allows a man to give financial protection to multiple women, who might otherwise not have any support (e.g. widows). However, some Islamic scholars say the wife can set a condition, in the marriage contract, that the husband cannot marry another woman during their marriage. In such a case, the husband cannot marry another woman as long as he is married to his wife. However, other Islamic scholars state that this condition is not allowed. According to traditional Islamic law, each of those wives keeps their property and assets separate; and are paid Mahr separately by their husband. Usually the wives have little to no contact with each other and lead separate, individual lives in their own houses, and sometimes in different cities, though they all share the same husband.\nIn most Muslim-majority countries, polygyny is legal with Kuwait being the only one where no restrictions are imposed on it. The practice is illegal in Muslim-majority Turkey, Tunisia, Albania, Kosovo, Azerbaijan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brunei, Sierra Leone, Guinea,\nKazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan.\nCountries that allow polygyny typically also require a man to obtain permission from his previous wives before marrying another, and require the man to prove that he can financially support multiple wives. In some Muslim countries, a man must justify taking an additional wife at a court hearing before he is allowed to do so. In Sudan, the government encouraged polygyny in 2001 to increase the population.\nJudaism.\nPolygyny is not forbidden in the Hebrew Bible, and over 40 important figures had more than one wife, such as Jacob, Solomon, and possibly Moses. However, the Torah contains a few specific regulations that apply to polygamy, such as (\"If he take another wife for himself; her food, her clothing, and her duty of marriage, shall he not diminish\"), (a man must award the inheritance due to a first-born son to the son who was actually born first, even if he hates that son's mother and likes another wife more), and (the king shall not have too many wives). Polygyny was still practiced well into the biblical period, and it is attested among Jews as late as the second century\u00a0CE. The incidence was limited, however, and it was likely largely restricted to the wealthy.\nThe Dead Sea Scrolls show that several smaller Jewish sects forbade polygamy before and during the first century. The Temple Scroll (11QT LVII 17\u201318) seems to prohibit polygamy. The rabbinical era, beginning with the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE, saw a continuation of some degree of legal acceptance for polygamy. Statements in the Talmud include, \"[If a man declares,] 'Be thou betrothed to half of me,' she is betrothed; 'Half of thee be betrothed to me,' she is not betrothed\" and elsewhere, \"A man may marry wives in addition to the first wife; provided only that he possesses the means to maintain them\", though another opinion in the Talmud requires divorcing a first wife before taking a second. In practice, polygamy was extremely rare in Jewish society in the Talmudic period.\nLater on, the Jewish codices began a process of restricting polygamy in Judaism. Most notable was the synod of Rabbeinu Gershom, whose rulings were accepted by Ashkenazi Jews. About 1000 CE he called a synod which instituted the following new laws: (1) prohibition of polygamy; (2) necessity of obtaining the consent of both parties to a divorce; (3) modification of the rules concerning those who became apostates under compulsion; (4) prohibition against opening correspondence addressed to another. Gershon left an exception to his ban on polygamy, called heter meah rabbanim, by which a man separated from his wife - but unable to officially divorce her due to certain extreme circumstances - could instead take a second wife.\nRabbeinu Gershom's ban on polygamy was not adopted by Sephardic communities. Some later Sephardic Jews such as Abraham David Taro\u00e7 are known to have multiple wives. Polygamy was common among Jewish communities in the Levant, possibly due to the influence of Muslim society, with 17% of divorce claims by women being due to complaints over husbands taking additional wives. According to R. Joseph Karo (16th century author of the last great codification of Jewish law, the \"Shulchan Aruch\"), and many other rabbis from Safed, the ban of Rabbeinu Gershom had expired, and therefore even Ashkenazim could marry additional wives. Even in instances where the husband made prenuptial agreements not to marry additional wives, local rabbis found loopholes to allow them to do so anyway.\nIn the modern day, polygamy is generally not condoned by Jews. Ashkenazi Jews have continued to follow Rabbeinu Gershom's ban since the 11th century. Some Mizrahi Jewish communities (particularly Yemenite Jews and Persian Jews) discontinued polygyny more recently, after they immigrated to countries where it was forbidden or illegal. Israel prohibits polygamy by law,and Mizrahi Jews are not permitted to enter into new polygamous marriages in Israel, though existing marriages may be maintained. In practice, however, the law is loosely enforced, primarily to avoid interference with Bedouin culture, where polygyny is practiced. Polygamy may still occur in non-European Jewish communities that exist in countries where it is not forbidden, such as Jewish communities in Iran or Morocco.\nLate Sephardic chief rabbi Ovadia Yosef supported the legalisation by the Israeli government of polygamy and the practice of pilegesh (the keeping of concubines). Tzvi Zohar, a professor from the Bar-Ilan University, recently suggested that based on the opinions of leading halachic authorities, the concept of concubines may serve as a practical halachic justification for premarital or non-marital cohabitation.\nKaraite Judaism has no rules against polygyny, though the practice itself in modern times is rare, and is not found at all among Karaites living in countries where polygamy is against the law. The husband, however, is only allowed to take other wives if he has the means and ability to treat them equally to the primary wife, and even then only if there was no anti-polygamy clause in their marriage contract from either party. Polyandry, on the other hand, is expressly forbidden.\nZoroastrianism.\nThere is limited information about polygamy in Zoroastrian tradition. There is no passage in the Avesta that favors polygamy or monogamy. However, tradition holds that Zoroaster had three wives. Polygamy appears to have been a right of spiritual dignitaries and aristocrats. It is mentioned in foreign writings, such as the letter of Tansar.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;For those who were the most virtuous and pious, he chose out princesses, that all might desire virtue and chastity. He was content with one or two wives for himself, and disapproved of having many children, saying: to have many children is fitting for the populace, but kings and nobles take pride in the smallness of their families\u2014\u200a\nIt was also written about in the 4th century CE by the Roman soldier and historian Ammianus Marcellinus, writing about Zoroastrian communities.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Each man according to his means contracts many or few marriages, whence their affection, divided as it is among various objects, grows cold.\u2014\u200a\nLegal status.\nInternational law.\nIn 2000, the United Nations Human Rights Committee reported that polygamy violates the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), citing concerns that the lack of \"equality of treatment with regard to the right to marry\" meant that polygamy, restricted to polygyny in practice, violates the dignity of women and should be outlawed. Specifically, reports to UN Committees have noted violations of ICCPR due to these inequalities, and reports to the UN General Assembly have recommended it be outlawed.\nICCPR does not apply to countries that have not signed it, which includes many Muslim countries such as Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Malaysia, Brunei and Oman.\nCanada.\nCanada has taken a strong stand against polygamy, and the Canadian Department of Justice has argued that polygyny is a violation of International Human Rights Law, as a form of gender discrimination. In Canada, the federal Criminal Code applies throughout the country. It extends the definition of polygamy to having any kind of conjugal union with more than one person at the same time. Also anyone who assists, celebrates, or is a part to a rite, ceremony, or contract that sanctions a polygamist relationship is guilty of polygamy. Polygamy is an offence punishable by up to five years in prison.\nIn 2017, two Canadian religious leaders were found guilty of practicing polygamy by the Supreme Court of British Columbia. Both of them are former bishops of the Mormon denomination of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (FLDS).\nUnited Kingdom.\nBigamy is illegal in the United Kingdom. \"De facto\" polygamy (having multiple partners at the same time) is not a criminal offence, provided the person does not register more than one marriage at the same time. In the UK, adultery is not a criminal offence (it is only a ground for divorce). In a written answer to the House of Commons, \"In Great Britain, polygamy is only recognized as valid in law in circumstances where the marriage ceremony has been performed in a country whose laws permit polygamy and the parties to the marriage were domiciled there at the time. In addition, immigration rules have generally prevented the formation of polygamous households in this country since 1988.\"\nThe 2010 UK government decided that Universal Credit (UC), which replaces means-tested benefits and tax credits for working-age people and will not be completely introduced until 2021, will not recognize polygamous marriages. A House of Commons briefing paper states \"Treating second and subsequent partners in polygamous relationships as separate claimants could in some situations mean that polygamous households receive more under Universal Credit than they do under the current rules for means-tested benefits and tax credits. This is because, as explained above, the amounts which may be paid in respect of additional spouses are lower than those which generally apply to single claimants.\" There is currently no official statistics data on cohabiting polygamous couples who have arranged marriage in religious ceremonies.\nUnited States.\nPolygamy is illegal in all 50 states in the U.S.; in Utah it currently remains a controversial issue that has been subject to legislative battles throughout the years. As of 2020 Utah is the only state where the practice is designated as an infraction rather than the more serious designation as a crime. However, recognizing polygamous unions is still illegal under the Constitution of Utah. Federal legislation to outlaw the practice was endorsed as constitutional in 1878 by the Supreme Court in \"Reynolds v. United States,\" despite the religious objections of Mormonism's largest denomination the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). The LDS Church subsequently ended the practice of polygamy around the turn of the twentieth century; however, several smaller fundamentalist Mormon groups across the state (not associated with the mainstream Church) continue the practice.\nOn 13 December 2013, a federal judge, spurred by the American Civil Liberties Union and other groups, struck down the parts of Utah's bigamy law that criminalized cohabitation, while also acknowledging that the state may still enforce bans on having multiple marriage licenses. This decision was overturned by the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, thus effectively recriminalizing polygamy as a felony. In 2020, Utah voted to downgrade polygamy from a felony to an infraction, but it remains a felony if force, threats or other abuses are involved.\nProsecutors in Utah have long had a policy of not pursuing polygamy in the absence of other associated crimes (e.g. fraud, abuse, marriage of underage persons, etc.). There are about 30,000 people living in polygamous communities in Utah.\nIndividualist feminism and advocates such as Wendy McElroy and journalist Jillian Keenan support the freedom for adults to voluntarily enter polygamous marriages.\nAuthors such as Alyssa Rower and Samantha Slark argue that there is a case for legalizing polygamy on the basis of regulation and monitoring of the practice, legally protecting the polygamous partners and allowing them to join mainstream society instead of forcing them to hide from it when any public situation arises.\nIn an October 2004 op-ed for \"USA Today\", George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley argued that, as a simple matter of equal treatment under the law, polygamy ought to be legal. Acknowledging that underage girls are sometimes coerced into polygamous marriages, Turley replied that \"banning polygamy is no more a solution to child abuse than banning marriage would be a solution to spousal abuse\".\nStanley Kurtz, a conservative fellow at the Hudson Institute, rejects the decriminalization and legalization of polygamy. He stated:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Marriage, as its ultramodern critics would like to say, is indeed about choosing one's partner, and about freedom in a society that values freedom. But that's not the only thing it is about. As the Supreme Court justices who unanimously decided Reynolds in 1878 understood, marriage is also about sustaining the conditions in which freedom can thrive. Polygamy in all its forms is a recipe for social structures that inhibit and ultimately undermine social freedom and democracy. A hard-won lesson of Western history is that genuine democratic self-rule begins at the hearth of the monogamous family.\nIn January 2015, Pastor Neil Patrick Carrick of Detroit, Michigan, brought a case (\"Carrick v. Snyder\") against the State of Michigan that the state's ban of polygamy violates the Free Exercise and Equal Protection Clause of the U.S. Constitution. The case was dismissed with prejudice on 10 February 2016, for lack of standing.\nIndonesia.\nIndonesia is the most populous Muslim country. Most polygamous families in the country are of Muslim background; they may also be aristocrats, registered civil servants, Islamic students (santri), and wholesalers.\nConstitutionally, Indonesia (basically) only recognizes monogamy. But, the government allows polygamy in some conditions:\nThere are other requirements for registered civil servants.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In the case of bacterial viruses (bacteriophages), proviruses are often referred to as prophages. However, proviruses are distinctly different from prophages and these terms should not be used interchangeably. Unlike prophages, proviruses do not excise themselves from the host genome when the host cell is stressed.\nThis state can be a stage of virus replication, or a state that persists over longer periods of time as either inactive viral infections or an endogenous viral element. In inactive viral infections the virus will not replicate itself except through replication of its host cell. This state can last over many host cell generations.\nEndogenous retroviruses are always in the state of a provirus. When a (nonendogenous) retrovirus invades a cell, the RNA of the retrovirus is reverse-transcribed into DNA by reverse transcriptase, then inserted into the host genome by an integrase.\nA provirus does not directly make new DNA copies of itself while integrated into a host genome in this way. Instead, it is passively replicated along with the host genome and passed on to the original cell's offspring; all descendants of the infected cell will also bear proviruses in their genomes. This is known as lysogenic viral reproduction. Integration can result in a latent infection or a productive infection. In a productive infection, the provirus is transcribed into messenger RNA which directly produces new virus, which in turn will infect other cells via the lytic cycle. A latent infection results when the provirus is transcriptionally silent rather than active.\nA latent infection may become productive in response to changes in the host's environmental conditions or health; the provirus may be activated and begin transcription of its viral genome. This can result in the destruction of its host cell because the cell's protein synthesis machinery is hijacked to produce more viruses.\nProviruses may account for approximately 8% of the human genome in the form of inherited endogenous retroviruses.\nThe term provirus not only refers to retroviruses but is also used to describe other viruses that can integrate into host chromosomes, an example being adeno-associated viruses. Not only eukaryotic viruses integrate into the genomes of their hosts; many bacterial and archaeal viruses also employ this strategy of propagation. All families of bacterial viruses with circular (single-stranded or double-stranded) DNA genomes or replicating their genomes through a circular intermediate (e.g., tailed dsDNA viruses) have temperate members.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Parades are held for a wide range of reasons, but are usually some variety of celebration.\nThe term \"parade\" is also used in different contexts; for example, in the Canadian Armed Forces, \"parade\" is used both to describe the procession and in other informal connotations.\nProtest demonstrations can also take the form of a parade, but these are usually referred to as a march instead.\nHistory.\nThe first parades date back to c.\u20092000 BC, for religious or military purposes. The Babylonians celebrated Akitu by parading their deities and performing rituals.\nTo celebrate the federal government's victory in the American Civil War, 145,000 Union soldiers marched in a two-day Grand Review of the Armies in Washington, D.C. They passed before the President, the Cabinet, and senior officers from May 23\u201324, 1865.\nDuring the Allied liberation of Europe towards the end of WWII in 1944\u201345, \"victory parades\" were a common feature throughout the recently liberated territories. For example, on 3 September 1944, the personnel of the 2nd Canadian Infantry Division marched six abreast to the music of massed regimental pipe and drum bands through the streets of Dieppe, France, to commemorate the liberation of the city from German occupation, as well as commemorate the loss of over 900 soldiers from that formation during the Dieppe Raid two years earlier. On the Moscow Victory Parade of 1945 held in Moscow, Soviet Union in June 1945, the Red Army commemorated Victory in Europe with a parade and the ceremonial destruction of captured Wehrmacht and Waffen-SS standards.\nParade float.\nThe parade float got its name because the first floats were decorated barges that were towed along the canals with ropes held by parade marchers on the shore. Floats were occasionally propelled from within by concealed oarsmen, but the practice was abandoned because of the high incidence of drowning when the lightweight and unstable frames capsized. Strikingly, among the first uses of grounded floats\u2014towed by horses\u2014was a ceremony in memory of recently drowned parade oarsmen. Today, parade floats are traditionally pulled by motor vehicles or are powered themselves.\nParade grand marshals.\nMultiple grand marshals may often be designated for an iteration of the parade, and may or may not be in actual attendance due to circumstances (including death). A \"community grand marshal\" or other designations may be selected alongside a \"grand marshal\" to lead the front or other parts of the parade.\nAircraft and boats.\nSince the advent of such technology, it became possible for aircraft and boats to parade. A flypast is an aerial parade of anything from one to dozens of aircraft, both in commercial context at airshows and also to mark important dates, such as national days or significant anniversaries. They are particularly common in the United Kingdom, where they are often associated with Royal occasions. Similarly, for ships, there may be a sail-past of, e.g., tall ships (as was seen during Trafalgar 200) or other sailing vessels as during the celebrations of the 60th anniversary of World War II.\nLongest parade.\nThe longest parade in the world is the Hanover Sch\u00fctzenfest that takes place in Hanover every year during the Sch\u00fctzenfest. The parade is long with more than 12,000 participants from all over the world, among them more than 100 bands and around 70 floats and carriages.\nTypes of parades.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nExamples of annual event parades.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nObservances marked by parades.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Priority queue serves highest priority items first. Priority values have to be instances of an ordered data type, and higher priority can be given either to the lesser or to the greater values with respect to the given order relation. For example, in Java standard library, \"PriorityQueue\"'s the least elements with respect to the order have the highest priority. This implementation detail is without much practical significance, since passing to the opposite order relation turns the least values into the greatest, and vice versa.\nWhile priority queues are often implemented using heaps, they are conceptually distinct. A priority queue can be implemented with a heap or with other methods; just as a list can be implemented with a linked list or with an array.\nOperations.\nA priority queue has the following operations:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nMin-priority queue.\nStacks and queues can be implemented as particular kinds of priority queues, with the priority determined by the order in which the elements are inserted. In a stack, the priority of each inserted element is monotonically increasing; thus, the last element inserted is always the first retrieved. In a queue, the priority of each inserted element is monotonically decreasing; thus, the first element inserted is always the first retrieved.\nIn some implementations, if two elements have the same priority, they are served in the same order in which they were enqueued. In other implementations, the order of elements with the same priority is undefined.\nImplementation.\nNaive implementations.\nOne can create a simple, but inefficient priority queue in a number of ways. These naive implementations can demonstrate the expected behaviour of a priority queue in a simpler manner.\n insert(element, priority):\n node.element \u2190 element\n node.priority \u2190 priority\n list.append(node)\n extract_max():\n highest \u2190 0\n foreach node in list:\n if highest.priority &lt; node.priority:\n highest \u2190 node\n list.remove(highest)\n return highest.element\n insert(element, priority):\n node.element \u2190 element\n node.priority \u2190 priority\n for i in [0...N]:\n element \u2190 list.get_at_index(i)\n if element.priority &lt; node.priority:\n list.insert_at_index(node, i + 1)\n return\n extract_max():\n highest \u2190 list.get_at_index(0)\n list.remove(highest)\n return highest.element\nUsual implementation.\nTo improve performance, priority queues are typically based on a heap, giving formula_5 performance for inserts and removals, and formula_2 to build the heap initially from a set of formula_7 elements. Variants of the basic heap data structure such as pairing heaps or Fibonacci heaps can provide better bounds for some operations.\nAlternatively, when a self-balancing binary search tree is used, insertion and removal also take formula_5 time, although building trees from existing sequences of elements takes formula_9 time; this is typical where one might already have access to these data structures, such as with third-party or standard libraries. From a space-complexity standpoint, using self-balancing binary search tree with linked list takes more storage, since it requires to store extra references to other nodes.\nFrom a computational-complexity standpoint, priority queues are congruent to sorting algorithms. The section on the equivalence of priority queues and sorting algorithms, below, describes how efficient sorting algorithms can create efficient priority queues.\nSpecialized heaps.\nThere are several specialized heap data structures that either supply additional operations or outperform heap-based implementations for specific types of keys, specifically integer keys. Suppose the set of possible keys is formula_10.\nFor applications that do many \"peek\" operations for every \"codice_27\" operation, the time complexity for peek actions can be reduced to formula_1 in all tree and heap implementations by caching the highest priority element after every insertion and removal. For insertion, this adds at most a constant cost, since the newly inserted element is compared only to the previously cached minimum element. For deletion, this at most adds an additional \"peek\" cost, which is typically cheaper than the deletion cost, so overall time complexity is not significantly impacted.\nMonotone priority queues are specialized queues that are optimized for the case where no item is ever inserted that has a lower priority (in the case of min-heap) than any item previously extracted. This restriction is met by several practical applications of priority queues.\nSummary of running times.\nHere are time complexities of various heap data structures. The abbreviation am. indicates that the given complexity is amortized, otherwise it is a worst-case complexity. For the meaning of \"O\"(\"f\")\" and \"\"\u0398\"(\"f\")\" see Big O notation. Names of operations assume a min-heap.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nEquivalence of priority queues and sorting algorithms.\nUsing a priority queue to sort.\nThe semantics of priority queues naturally suggest a sorting method: insert all the elements to be sorted into a priority queue, and sequentially remove them; they will come out in sorted order. This is actually the procedure used by several sorting algorithms, once the layer of abstraction provided by the priority queue is removed. This sorting method is equivalent to the following sorting algorithms:\nUsing a sorting algorithm to make a priority queue.\nA sorting algorithm can also be used to implement a priority queue. Specifically, Thorup says:\nWe present a general deterministic linear space reduction from priority queues to sorting implying that if we can sort up to formula_7 keys in formula_27 time per key, then there is a priority queue supporting codice_7 and codice_21 in formula_28 time and codice_26 in constant time.\nThat is, if there is a sorting algorithm which can sort in formula_29 time per key, where formula_30 is some function of formula_7 and word size, then one can use the given procedure to create a priority queue where pulling the highest-priority element is formula_1 time, and inserting new elements (and deleting elements) is formula_29 time. For example, if one has an formula_9 sort algorithm, one can create a priority queue with formula_1 pulling and formula_5 insertion.\nLibraries.\nA priority queue is often considered to be a \"container data structure\".\nThe Standard Template Library (STL), and the C++ 1998 standard, specifies https:// as one of the STL container adaptor class templates. However, it does not specify how two elements with same priority should be served, and indeed, common implementations will not return them according to their order in the queue. It implements a max-priority-queue, and has three parameters: a comparison object for sorting such as a function object (defaults to if unspecified), the underlying container for storing the data structures (defaults to ), and two iterators to the beginning and end of a sequence. Unlike actual STL containers, it does not allow iteration of its elements (it strictly adheres to its abstract data type definition). STL also has utility functions for manipulating another random-access container as a binary max-heap. The Boost libraries also have an implementation in the library heap.\nPython's https:// module implements a binary min-heap on top of a list.\nJava's library contains a (codice_45) class, which implements a min-priority-queue as a binary heap.\n.NET's library contains a https:// class, which implements an array-backed, quaternary min-heap.\nScala's library contains a https:// class, which implements a max-priority-queue.\nGo's library contains a http:// module, which implements a min-heap on top of any compatible data structure.\nRust's standard library contains a https:// struct, which implements a priority queue with a binary heap.\nThe Standard PHP Library extension contains the class http://.\nApple's Core Foundation framework contains a https:// structure, which implements a min-heap.\nApplications.\nBandwidth management.\nPriority queuing can be used to manage limited resources such as bandwidth on a transmission line from a network router. In the event of outgoing traffic queuing due to insufficient bandwidth, all other queues can be halted to send the traffic from the highest priority queue upon arrival. This ensures that the prioritized traffic (such as real-time traffic, e.g. an RTP stream of a VoIP connection) is forwarded with the least delay and the least likelihood of being rejected due to a queue reaching its maximum capacity. All other traffic can be handled when the highest priority queue is empty. Another approach used is to send disproportionately more traffic from higher priority queues.\nMany modern protocols for local area networks also include the concept of priority queues at the media access control (MAC) sub-layer to ensure that high-priority applications (such as VoIP or IPTV) experience lower latency than other applications which can be served with best-effort service. Examples include IEEE 802.11e (an amendment to IEEE 802.11 which provides quality of service) and ITU-T G.hn (a standard for high-speed local area network using existing home wiring (power lines, phone lines and coaxial cables).\nUsually a limitation (policer) is set to limit the bandwidth that traffic from the highest priority queue can take, in order to prevent high priority packets from choking off all other traffic. This limit is usually never reached due to high level control instances such as the Cisco Callmanager, which can be programmed to inhibit calls which would exceed the programmed bandwidth limit.\nDiscrete event simulation.\nAnother use of a priority queue is to manage the events in a discrete event simulation. The events are added to the queue with their simulation time used as the priority. The execution of the simulation proceeds by repeatedly pulling the top of the queue and executing the event thereon.\n\"See also\": Scheduling (computing), queueing theory\nDijkstra's algorithm.\nWhen the graph is stored in the form of adjacency list or matrix, priority queue can be used to extract minimum efficiently when implementing Dijkstra's algorithm, although one also needs the ability to alter the priority of a particular vertex in the priority queue efficiently.\nIf instead, a graph is stored as node objects, and priority-node pairs are inserted into a heap, altering the priority of a particular vertex is not necessary if one tracks visited nodes. Once a node is visited, if it comes up in the heap again (having had a lower priority number associated with it earlier), it is popped-off and ignored.\nHuffman coding.\nHuffman coding requires one to repeatedly obtain the two lowest-frequency trees. A priority queue is one method of doing this.\nBest-first search algorithms.\nBest-first search algorithms, like the A* search algorithm, find the shortest path between two vertices or nodes of a weighted graph, trying out the most promising routes first. A priority queue (also known as the \"fringe\") is used to keep track of unexplored routes; the one for which the estimate (a lower bound in the case of A*) of the total path length is smallest is given highest priority. If memory limitations make best-first search impractical, variants like the SMA* algorithm can be used instead, with a double-ended priority queue to allow removal of low-priority items.\nROAM triangulation algorithm.\nThe Real-time Optimally Adapting Meshes (ROAM) algorithm computes a dynamically changing triangulation of a terrain. It works by splitting triangles where more detail is needed and merging them where less detail is needed. The algorithm assigns each triangle in the terrain a priority, usually related to the error decrease if that triangle would be split. The algorithm uses two priority queues, one for triangles that can be split and another for triangles that can be merged. In each step the triangle from the split queue with the highest priority is split, or the triangle from the merge queue with the lowest priority is merged with its neighbours.\nPrim's algorithm for minimum spanning tree.\nUsing min heap priority queue in Prim's algorithm to find the minimum spanning tree of a connected and undirected graph, one can achieve a good running time. This min heap priority queue uses the min heap data structure which supports operations such as codice_21, codice_29, codice_27, codice_49. In this implementation, the weight of the edges is used to decide the priority of the vertices. Lower the weight, higher the priority and higher the weight, lower the priority.\nParallel priority queue.\nParallelization can be used to speed up priority queues, but requires some changes to the priority queue interface. The reason for such changes is that a sequential update usually only has formula_37 or formula_38 cost, and there is no practical gain to parallelize such an operation. One possible change is to allow the concurrent access of multiple processors to the same priority queue. The second possible change is to allow batch operations that work on formula_39 elements, instead of just one element. For example, codice_50 will remove the first formula_39 elements with the highest priority.\nConcurrent parallel access.\nIf the priority queue allows concurrent access, multiple processes can perform operations concurrently on that priority queue. However, this raises two issues. First of all, the definition of the semantics of the individual operations is no longer obvious. For example, if two processes want to extract the element with the highest priority, should they get the same element or different ones? This restricts parallelism on the level of the program using the priority queue. In addition, because multiple processes have access to the same element, this leads to contention.\nThe concurrent access to a priority queue can be implemented on a Concurrent Read, Concurrent Write (CRCW) PRAM model. In the following the priority queue is implemented as a skip list. In addition, an atomic synchronization primitive, CAS, is used to make the skip list lock-free. The nodes of the skip list consists of a unique key, a priority, an array of pointers, for each level, to the next nodes and a codice_7 mark. The codice_7 mark marks if the node is about to be deleted by a process. This ensures that other processes can react to the deletion appropriately.\nIf the concurrent access to a priority queue is allowed, conflicts may arise between two processes. For example, a conflict arises if one process is trying to insert a new node, but at the same time another process is about to delete the predecessor of that node. There is a risk that the new node is added to the skip list, yet it is not longer reachable. ()\n\"K\"-element operations.\nIn this setting, operations on a priority queue is generalized to a batch of formula_39 elements.\nFor instance, codice_57 deletes the formula_39 smallest elements of the priority queue and returns those. \nIn a shared-memory setting, the parallel priority queue can be easily implemented using parallel binary search trees and join-based tree algorithms. In particular, codice_57 corresponds to a \"split\" on the binary search tree that has formula_38 cost and yields a tree that contains the formula_39 smallest elements. codice_59 can be applied by a \"union\" of the original priority queue and the batch of insertions. If the batch is already sorted by the key, codice_59 has formula_45 cost. Otherwise, we need to first sort the batch, so the cost will be formula_46. Other operations for priority queue can be applied similarly. For instance, codice_61 can be done by first applying codice_62 and then codice_63, which first deletes the elements and then inserts them back with the updated keys. All these operations are highly parallel, and the theoretical and practical efficiency can be found in related research papers.\nThe rest of this section discusses a queue-based algorithm on distributed memory. We assume each processor has its own local memory and a local (sequential) priority queue. The elements of the global (parallel) priority queue are distributed across all processors.\nA codice_59 operation assigns the elements uniformly random to the processors which insert the elements into their local queues. Note that single elements can still be inserted into the queue. Using this strategy the global smallest elements are in the union of the local smallest elements of every processor with high probability. Thus each processor holds a representative part of the global priority queue.\nThis property is used when codice_57 is executed, as the smallest formula_47 elements of each local queue are removed and collected in a result set. The elements in the result set are still associated with their original processor. The number of elements formula_47 that is removed from each local queue depends on formula_39 and the number of processors formula_50. \nBy parallel selection the formula_39 smallest elements of the result set are determined. With high probability these are the global formula_39 smallest elements. If not, formula_47 elements are again removed from each local queue and put into the result set. This is done until the global formula_39 smallest elements are in the result set. Now these formula_39 elements can be returned. All other elements of the result set are inserted back into their local queues. The running time of codice_57 is expected formula_56, where formula_57 and formula_58 is the size of the priority queue.\nThe priority queue can be further improved by not moving the remaining elements of the result set directly back into the local queues after a codice_57 operation. This saves moving elements back and forth all the time between the result set and the local queues.\nBy removing several elements at once a considerable speedup can be reached. But not all algorithms can use this kind of priority queue. Dijkstra's algorithm for example can not work on several nodes at once. The algorithm takes the node with the smallest distance from the priority queue and calculates new distances for all its neighbor nodes. If you would take out formula_39 nodes, working at one node could change the distance of another one of the formula_39 nodes. So using k-element operations destroys the label setting property of Dijkstra's algorithm.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is described in Buddhist commentaries as a noble character quality generally associated with enlightened beings. \"P\u0101ram\u012b\" and \"p\u0101ramit\u0101\" are both terms in Pali but Pali literature makes greater reference to \"p\u0101ram\u012b\", while Mahayana texts generally use the Sanskrit \"p\u0101ramit\u0101.\"\nEtymology.\nDonald S. Lopez Jr. describes the etymology of the term:&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The term \"p\u0101ramit\u0101\", commonly translated as \"perfection\", has two etymologies. The first derives it from the word \"parama\", meaning \"highest\", \"most distant\", and hence \"chief\", \"primary\", \"most excellent\". Hence, the substantive can be rendered \"excellence\" or \"perfection\". This reading is supported by the \"Madhy\u0101ntavibh\u0101ga\" (V.4), where the twelve excellences (\"parama\") are associated with the ten perfections (\"p\u0101ramit\u0101\").\nA more creative yet widely reported etymology divides \"p\u0101ramit\u0101\" into \"p\u0101ra\" and \"mita\", with \"p\u0101ra\" meaning \"beyond\", \"the further bank, shore or boundary,\" and \"mita\", meaning \"that which has arrived\", or \"ita\" meaning \"that which goes\". \"P\u0101ramit\u0101\" then means \"that which has gone beyond\", \"that which goes beyond\" or \"transcendent\". This reading is reflected in the Tibetan translation \"pha rol tu phyin pa\" (\"gone to the other side\").\nTherav\u0101da Buddhism.\nTheravada teachings on the \"p\u0101ram\u012bs\" can be found in late canonical books and post-canonical commentaries. Theravada commentator Dhammapala describes them as noble qualities usually associated with bodhisattvas. American scholar-monk Thanissaro Bhikkhu describes them as perfections \"(param\u012b)\" of character necessary to achieve enlightenment as one of the three enlightened beings, a \"samma sambuddha\", a \"pacceka-buddha\", or an \"arahant\".\nCanonical sources.\nIn the P\u0101li Canon, the \"Buddhavamsa\" of the \"Khuddaka Nik\u0101ya\" lists the ten perfections (\"dasa p\u0101ramiyo\") as:\nTwo of these virtues\u2014\"mett\u0101\" and \"upekkh\u0101\"\u2014are also brahmavih\u0101ras, and two \u2013 \"v\u012brya\" and \"upekkh\u0101\"\u2014are factors of awakening.\nHistoricity.\nThe Therav\u0101da teachings on the p\u0101ram\u012bs can be found in canonical books (\"Jataka tales\", \"Apad\u0101na\", \"Buddhavamsa\", \"Cariy\u0101pi\u1e6daka\") and post-canonical commentaries written to supplement the P\u0101li Canon that therefore might not be an original part of the Therav\u0101da teachings. The oldest parts of the \"Sutta Pi\u1e6daka\" (for example, \"Majjhima Nik\u0101ya\", \"Digha Nik\u0101ya\", \"Sa\u1e43yutta Nik\u0101ya\" and the \"A\u1e45guttara Nik\u0101ya\") do not mention the p\u0101ram\u012bs as a category (though they are all mentioned individually).\nSome scholars refer to the p\u0101ram\u012bs as a semi-Mah\u0101y\u0101na teaching added to the scriptures at a later time in order to appeal to the interests and needs of the lay community and to popularize their religion. However, these views rely on the early scholarly presumption of Mah\u0101y\u0101na originating with religious devotion and appeal to laity. More recently, scholars have started to open up early Mah\u0101y\u0101na literature, which is very ascetic and expounds the ideal of the monk's life in the forest. Therefore, the practice of the p\u0101ramit\u0101s in Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism may have been close to the ideals of the ascetic tradition of the \u015brama\u1e47a.\nThe cultivation of p\u0101ram\u012bs is closely linked with Buddhist kingship, and the Burmese and Thai sociological concepts of hpone and barami respectively.\nTraditional practice.\nBhikkhu Bodhi maintains that in the earliest Buddhist texts (which he identifies as the first four \"nik\u0101yas\"), those seeking the extinction of suffering (\"nibbana\") pursued the noble eightfold path. As time went on, a backstory was provided for the multi-life development of the Buddha; as a result, the ten perfections were identified as part of the path for the bodhisattva (P\u0101li: \"bodhisatta\"). Over subsequent centuries, the \"p\u0101ram\u012bs\" were seen as being significant for aspirants to both Buddhahood and arahantship. Bhikkhu Bodhi summarizes:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;in established Therav\u0101da tradition the p\u0101ram\u012bs are not regarded as a discipline peculiar to candidates for Buddhahood alone but as practices which must be fulfilled by all aspirants to enlightenment and deliverance, whether as Buddhas, paccekabuddhas, or disciples. What distinguishes the supreme bodhisattva from aspirants in the other two vehicles is the degree to which the p\u0101ram\u012bs must be cultivated and the length of time they must be pursued. But the qualities themselves are universal requisites for deliverance, which all must fulfill to at least a minimal degree to merit the fruits of the liberating path.\nSarv\u0101stiv\u0101da.\nThe Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da Vaibh\u0101\u1e63ika school's main commentary, the \"Mah\u0101vibh\u0101\u1e63\u0101,\" teaches the bodhisattva path based on a system of four p\u0101ramit\u0101s:\nThe \"Mah\u0101vibh\u0101\u1e63\u0101\" also mentions the system of six p\u0101ramit\u0101s, arguing that patience (\"\") is classified as a kind of discipline and that meditation (\"Dhy\u0101na\") is to be seen as a mode of wisdom (\"praj\u00f1\u0101\").\nMah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism.\nMah\u0101y\u0101na texts refer to the \"p\u0101ramit\u0101s\" as \"bases of training\" used for self-cultivation on the bodhisattva path to Buddhahood.\nSix perfections.\nThe Praj\u00f1ap\u0101ramit\u0101 s\u016btras and a large number of other Mah\u0101y\u0101na texts list six perfections: giving, ethical discipline, patience, vigorous effort, meditation, wisdom (\"praj\u00f1\u0101\").\nThe list of six paramitas is also mentioned by the Therav\u0101da commentator Dhammapala, who describes it as a categorisation of the same ten perfections of Theravada Buddhism. According to Dhammapala, \"Sacca\" is classified as both \"\u015a\u012bla\" and \"Praj\u00f1\u0101\", \"Mett\u0101\" and \"Upekkh\u0101\" are classified as \"Dhy\u0101na\", and \"Adhi\u1e6d\u1e6dh\u0101na\" falls under all six. Bhikkhu Bodhi states that the correlations between the two sets shows there was a shared core before the Theravada and Mahayana schools split.\nD\u0101nap\u0101ramit\u0101.\nD\u0101na-p\u0101ramit\u0101 (Chinese: \u5e03\u65bd\u6ce2\u7f85\u871c, pinyin: bushi boluomi; Tibetan Wylie: byin pa\u2019i pha rol tu phyin pa) refers to a bodhisattva's practice of generosity, giving, charity. There are three main types of giving: the \"gift of material goods\" (\"\u0101misa-d\u0101na\"), the \"gift of fearlessness\" (\"abhaya-d\u0101na\"), and the \"gift of the Dharma\" (\"dharma-d\u0101na\").\nThe perfection of giving is fully developed on the first of the ten bodhisattva stages (\"bh\u016bmi\"). At this stage, the bodhisattva, through insight into emptiness, is inspired to perfect the practice of giving. This involves offering even the most cherished possessions\u2014such as wealth, family, and even the bodhisattva\u2019s own body (\"dehad\u0101na\")\u2014without attachment.\nA key element of the perfection of giving which distinguishes it from regular charity is how the bodhisattva, through their the understanding of emptiness, realizes that there is no inherent existence in the donor, the recipient, or the gift itself. With this realization, ordinary acts of giving are transformed into \"perfected\" acts of giving. This perfection leads to an awareness of universal suchness.\n\u015a\u012blap\u0101ramit\u0101.\n\u015a\u012bla-p\u0101ramit\u0101 (C. \u6301\u6212\u6ce2\u7f85\u871c, chi jie boluomi; T. tshul khrims kyi pha rol tu phyin pa) is the perfection of virtue, moral conduct, or ethical discipline. In Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism, the perfection of ethical discipline is fulfilled by observing the bodhisattva precepts, which is divided into the \"three sets of pure precepts\" (\"trividh\u0101ni \u015b\u012bl\u0101ni\"; C. \u4e09\u805a\u51c0\u6212, \"sanju jingjie\"). These are:\nThe first category corresponds to foundational precepts emphasized in the \"H\u012bnay\u0101na\" tradition, while the latter two represent the Mah\u0101y\u0101na perspective on moral conduct. Together, the three sets of precepts form a comprehensive framework that integrates both H\u012bnay\u0101na and Mah\u0101y\u0101na views on morality into a unified system.\n\u015a\u012bla-p\u0101ramit\u0101 is the main focus of cultivation on the second bodhisattva stage. At this stage, the bodhisattva overcomes the obstruction of deluded conduct (\"mithy\u0101pratipatty\u0101vara\u1e47a\"; C. \u90aa\u884c\u969c, \"xiexing zhang\").\nK\u1e63\u0101ntip\u0101ramit\u0101.\nK\u1e63\u0101nti-p\u0101ramit\u0101 (Ch: \u5fcd\u8fb1\u6ce2\u7f85\u871c renru boluomi; T. bzod pa\u2019i pha rol tu) is the bodhisattva's perfection of patience, a virtue which also has connotations of tolerance, forbearance, acceptance, and endurance. The term \"k\u1e63\u0101nti\" holds multiple meanings. It often refers to the patience and endurance demonstrated by a bodhisattva in various aspects of their spiritual journey and includes the ability to endure abuse and hardship inflicted by sentient beings without wavering in compassion or resolve. It also means that a bodhisattva maintains a commitment to persevere through the difficulties encountered on the path to buddhahood, maintaining the dedication to liberate all beings from sa\u1e43s\u0101ra. Furthermore, it also refers to the capacity to accept and be receptive to the profound truths of reality, such as impermanence, suffering, emptiness, and not-self, without being overwhelmed or fearful for them.\nThis latter sense is particularly important in Mah\u0101y\u0101na, which culminates in the attainment of \"receptivity to the non-production of dharmas\" (anutpattikadharmak\u1e63\u0101nti). This attainment refers to a bodhisattva's unwavering receptive realization that all phenomena (\"dharmas\") are intrinsically \"unproduced\" (\"anutp\u0101da\") and \"empty\" (\"\u015b\u016bnyat\u0101\"), including themselves, Buddhahood and the Dharma itself. The acceptance and realization of this ultimate truth is crucial for attaining the stage of non-retrogression (\"avaivartika\") in which a bodhisattva cannot fall back to a lesser level, which is often identified with the first or eighth \"bh\u016bmi\" on the bodhisattva path.\nV\u012bryap\u0101ramit\u0101.\nV\u012brya-p\u0101ramit\u0101 (C. \u7cbe\u9032\u6ce2\u7f85\u871c, jingjin boluomiduo; T. brtson \u2019grus kyi pha rol tu phyin pa) is the perfection of energy, diligence, vigour, or effort. V\u012brya-p\u0101ramit\u0101 represents the tireless and unwavering energy and effort necessary to overcome obstacles, cultivate virtue, and realise wisdom on the bodhisattva path. This perfection is fully realized during the fourth stage of the bodhisattva path. At this stage, the radiant intensity of the thirty-seven factors of enlightenment (\"bodhip\u0101k\u1e63ikadharma\") becomes so powerful that it burns away all defilements and obstructions. This purification grants the bodhisattva boundless energy to pursue enlightenment and the liberation of all beings.\nDhy\u0101nap\u0101ramit\u0101.\nDhy\u0101na-p\u0101ramit\u0101 (C. \u79aa\u5b9a\u6ce2\u7f85\u871c, jingl\u00fc boluomiduo; T. bsam gtan gyi pha rol tu phyin pa) is the perfection of meditation or contemplative absorption and is closely associated with the bodhisattva's mastery of numerous sam\u0101dhis. The perfection of dhyana in Mahayana Buddhism includes the classic early Buddhist meditative states called the four dhy\u0101nas, which gradually take a meditator to a place beyond all thought.\nHowever, according to the \"Dazhidulun\", a bodhisattva's meditations are also significantly different than the non-Mahayana dhy\u0101nas. While in Theravada, the dhy\u0101nas are meant to go beyond all thought into a perfectly peaceful unmoving state of mind, the \"Dazhidulun\" mentions that regarding the practice of the four meditations or dhy\u0101nas \"the bodhisattva practicing dhy\u0101nap\u0101ramit\u0101 enters the successive dhy\u0101na stages \"with thoughts of the realm of desire\".\" This is because a bodhisattva, while having no coarse thinking (vitarka) or subtle examination (vicara), they are still focused on all sentient beings in all realms and seek to guide them to nirvana. This is due to the Mahayana emphasis on compassion for all beings, which rejects the idea that we must retreat to state of mind which is completely detached from all beings.\nAs such, Mahayana texts are careful to warn bodhisattvas not to practice dhy\u0101na in the same manner as Hinayanists, that is to say, to practice them in a self-centered manner that seeks only an individual escape from samsara. As such, the \"A\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101da\u015bas\u0101hasrik\u0101praj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101\" states that a bodhisattva must master the eight dhy\u0101nas without seeking their karmic fruit (i.e. rebirth outside the realm of desire). This is done through developing bodhicitta, as the \"A\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101da\u015bas\u0101hasrik\u0101praj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101\" states, the bodhisattva meditates by \"not clinging to the level of sravakas and pratyekabuddhas, and [practices meditation thinking], 'Having stood in the perfection of dhy\u0101na, I must now liberate all beings from the cycle of rebirths.'\"\nPraj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101.\n\"Praj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101\" (C. \u822c\u82e5\u6ce2\u7f85\u871c, bore boluomiduo; T. shes rab kyi pha rol tu phyin pa), the perfection of wisdom, is the most important and foundational of all the p\u0101ramit\u0101s and the source of them all. This term carries multiple meanings, but generally speaking, \"Praj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101\" refers to a transcendent kind of wisdom surpassing ordinary understanding, particularly the wisdom required for achieving buddhahood. It is often defined as the realization of emptiness (\"\u015b\u016bnyat\u0101\") and suchness (Tath\u0101t\u0101), and the insight that agent, object, and action lack a permanent essence or svabhava. When linked to the ten bodhisattva stages (\"bh\u016bmi\"), the perfection of wisdom corresponds to the sixth stage.\nTen perfections.\nIn the \"Ten Stages Sutra\", four more p\u0101ramit\u0101s are listed, bringing the total count to ten perfection. The extra four are: \"Up\u0101ya-p\u0101ramit\u0101\" (perfection of skillful means), \"Pra\u1e47idh\u0101na-p\u0101ramit\u0101\" (perfection of aspiration or vows), \"Bala-p\u0101ramit\u0101\" (perfection of power) and \"J\u00f1\u0101na p\u0101ramit\u0101\" (perfection of knowledge)\".\" The \"Mah\u0101ratnak\u016b\u1e6da S\u016btra\" (\"Sutra of the Heap of Jewels\") also includes these additional four p\u0101ramit\u0101s, with the order of numbers 8 and 9 switched.\nUp\u0101yap\u0101ramit\u0101.\nThe perfection of skillful means (\"up\u0101ya-kau\u015balya\") is the skill of a Buddha or an advanced bodhisattva which allows them to perfectly tailor their teachings and actions to align with the inclinations and capacities of his audience. Because buddhas and bodhisattvas have profound understanding, they can provide teachings that are most suitable for each individual, akin to a physician prescribing specific treatments for particular ailments. Moreover, \"skillful means\" can serve to explain why certain actions, which might seem unethical to beings of limited spiritual insight, become virtuous when undertaken by a bodhisattva who acts with the ultimate welfare of others in mind.\nPra\u1e47idh\u0101nap\u0101ramit\u0101.\nPra\u1e47idh\u0101nap\u0101ramit\u0101 (C. \u9858\u6ce2\u7f85 yuan boluomi; T. smon lam gyi pha rol tu phyin pa) is the perfection of the bodhisattva's vow or \"aspiration\". This refers to how bodhisattvas make solemn declarations of their intent to achieve buddhahood for the sake of all sentient beings. These vows can take the form of an oath, where one commits to achieving a goal, or a prayer, where one dedicates merit toward its realization. The term also appears in the context of \"p\u016brvapra\u1e47idh\u0101na\", meaning \"prior vow.\" This refers to a pledge made in the past, either already fulfilled in the present or destined for fulfillment in the future, typically in relation to the aspiration for buddhahood.\nBalap\u0101ramit\u0101.\nBalap\u0101ramit\u0101 (C. \u529b\u6ce2\u7f85\u871c li bo-luomi; T. stobs kyi pha rol tu phyin pa) is the \u201cperfection of power\u201d or \u201cstrength\u201d. This refers to the power of a bodhisattva which allows him to master elements of the teaching, such as the four analytical knowledges or four discriminations (pratisa\u1e43vid).\nJ\u00f1\u0101nap\u0101ramit\u0101.\nJ\u00f1\u0101na-p\u0101ramit\u0101 (C. \u667a zhi; T. ye shes) is the perfection of \"gnosis,\" or \"knowledge\", which denotes a distinct understanding of an object\u2019s nature. While \"praj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101\" signifies perfected spiritual insight into ultimate reality, \"j\u00f1\u0101na\" refers to more general forms of knowledge specific to the path of the bodhisattva. There are various schemas of these types of knowledge. One text, the \"Abhisamay\u0101la\u1e45k\u0101ra\", divides knowledge into three main types: knowledge of all aspects (sarv\u0101k\u0101raj\u00f1at\u0101, only Buddhas have this), knowledge of paths (m\u0101rg\u0101k\u0101raj\u00f1at\u0101, which is accessible to bodhisattvas) and all-knowledge (sarvaj\u00f1at\u0101, accessible even to sravakas).\nTibetan Buddhism.\nAccording to the perspective of Tibetan Buddhism, the practice of accumulating paramitas is generally considered very important. In most contexts, they are seen as a fundamental basis for practice of the higher teachings, such as Vajrayana.\u00a0The Dalai Lama has said:To attain enlightenment, we need better rebirths; and the six perfections \u2013 in particular, far-reaching ethical self-discipline \u2013 enable us to attain better rebirths. We won\u2019t be able to help others materially if we aren\u2019t wealthy, and so we need to cultivate generosity. We need virtuous friends, and so we must reject anger and practice patience. In order to accomplish anything, we need perseverance. To gain friends, we must control our disturbing emotions, and so we must practice mental constancy (concentration). And finally, to really be effective in helping others, we need the discriminating awareness (wisdom) of knowing what is beneficial and what is of harm. Therefore, we need to cultivate all six far-reaching attitudes.Similarly, concerning the six paramitas, or \"the six far-reaching attitudes,\" and how they relate to the practice of the three vehicles of Tibetan Buddhism, the Dalai Lama has said: The Hinayana path is the preliminary path, the Mahayana sutra one is the main path, and tantra is something to train in only as a branch. The four tenet systems are like stairs. The higher systems highlight contradictions in the lower ones, but by knowing the lower, we can appreciate the profundity of the higher. The higher systems are vast and profound since they do not contradict logic. If we are aware of the areas in which we can make mistakes, it helps us to stay on the right path and have confidence in it. Thus, the study of the tenet systems gives stability to our view. Then, on the basis of the six far-reaching attitudes and bodhichitta, we will be able to fulfill our own aims and those of others.Traleg Kyabgon Rinpoche renders \"p\u0101ramit\u0101\" into English as \"transcendent action\" and then frames and qualifies it:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;When we say that \"paramita\" means \"transcendent action,\" we mean it in the sense that actions or attitude are performed in a non-egocentric manner. \"Transcendental\" does not refer to some external reality, but rather to the way in which we conduct our lives and perceive the world \u2013 either in an egocentric or a non-egocentric way. The six \"paramitas\" are concerned with the effort to step out of the egocentric mentality.\nThe initial four perfections involve skillful means practice, while the last two pertain to wisdom practice. Together, they encompass all the necessary methods and skills to dispel delusion and meet the needs of others, and to rise from states of contentment to even greater happiness.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "24497", "revid": "1071745", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24497", "title": "Prakrit", "text": "Group of languages of the 5th century BCE \u2013 12th century CE\nPrakrit ( ) is a group of vernacular classical Middle Indo-Aryan languages that were used in the Indian subcontinent from around the 5th century BCE to the 12th century CE. The term Prakrit is usually applied to the middle period of the Middle Indo-Aryan languages, excluding Pali.\nThe oldest stage of Middle Indo-Aryan language is attested in the inscriptions of Ashoka (c. 260 BCE), as well as in the earliest forms of P\u0101li, the language of the Therav\u0101da Buddhist canon. The most prominent form of Prakrit is Ardham\u0101gadh\u0131\u0304, associated with the ancient kingdom of Magadha, in modern Bihar, and the subsequent Mauryan Empire. Mah\u0101v\u012bra, the 24th and last T\u012brtha\u1e45kara of Jainism, was born in Magadha, and the earliest Jain texts were composed in Ardham\u0101gadh\u0131\u0304.\nEtymology.\nThere are two major views concerning the way in which Sanskrit and Prakrit are related. One view holds that Prakrit was the speech of the common people, unadorned by grammar, and that pr\u0101k\u1e5bta thus refers to vernacular usage, while Sanskrit was a co-existing but elevated register of the language. This is the usual explanation accepted by Western linguists. It also is one of several views noted, for example, by Nami Sadhu (11th century CE) in his commentary on Rudra\u1e6da\u2019s K\u0101vy\u0101la\u1e45k\u0101ra (\u201cOrnaments of Poetry\u201d), a 9th-century treatise on poetics. In contrast, the view most commonly held by modern Prakrit grammarians holds that the Prakrit languages are vernaculars that descended from Sanskrit at a later date:\nThe dictionary of Monier Monier-Williams (1819\u20131899), and other modern authors, however, interpret the word in the opposite sense: \u201cThe most frequent meanings of the term ', from which the word \u2018prakrit\u2019 is derived, are \u2018original, natural, normal\u2019 and the term is derived from ', \u2018making or placing before or at first, the original or natural form or condition of anything, original or primary substance.\u2019\u201d\nDefinition.\nModern scholars have used the term \"Prakrit\" to refer to two concepts:\nSome modern scholars include all Middle Indo-Aryan languages under the rubric of 'Prakrits', while others emphasize the independent development of these languages, often separated from the history of Sanskrit by wide divisions of caste, religion, and geography.\nThe broadest definition uses the term \"Prakrit\" to describe any Middle Indo-Aryan language that deviates from Sanskrit in any manner. American scholar Andrew Ollett points out that this unsatisfactory definition makes \"Prakrit\" a cover term for languages that were not actually called Prakrit in ancient India, such as:\nAccording to some scholars, such as German Indologists Richard Pischel and Oskar von Hin\u00fcber, the term \"Prakrit\" refers to a smaller set of languages that were used exclusively in literature:\nAccording to Sanskrit and Prakrit scholar Shreyansh Kumar Jain Shastri and A. C. Woolner, the Ardham\u0101gadh\u0131\u0304 (or simply Magadhi) Prakrit, which was used extensively to write the scriptures of Jainism, is often considered to be the definitive form of Prakrit, while others are considered variants of it. Prakrit grammarians would give the full grammar of Ardham\u0101gadh\u0131\u0304 first, and then define the other grammars with relation to it. For this reason, courses teaching 'Prakrit' are often regarded as teaching Ardham\u0101gadh\u0131\u0304.\nDevelopment of Prakrit from Old Indo-Aryan.\nThe Prakrit and Pali languages developed from Old Indo-Aryan (OIA, e.g. Vedic Sanskrit, ca. 600 BE) by a set of regular phonological transformations. This section summarizes the changes occurring between Vedic Sanskrit (ca. 600 BCE), Early Middle-Indo-Aryan (MIA) in Pali or Ashokan Prakrit (ca. 280 BCE), the dramatic regional Prakrits like Maharashtri Prakrit (ca. 200 AD), and finally the late Prakrit or Apabhramsha stage (ca. 900 AD).\nConservative features lost in Vedic.\nPrakrit and Pali languages partially-preserve some conservative features of Proto-Indo-Aryan (PIA) lost in Vedic Sanskrit. Specifically:\nEarly changes common to Dardic.\nThe following changes are common to Middle Indo-Aryan (MIA) and Dardic.\nSound changes common to Pali and Prakrit.\nAfter the split of Dardic languages, these changes are common to Pali and Prakrit. These changes may be also grouped together as the \"MIA assimilation rules\", and are the most important rules from this period. Regarding the assimilations of Old Indo-Aryan consonant conjuncts, the Jayadhaval\u0101 (ca. ninth century AD) writes \"D\u012bsa\u1e41ti do\u1e47\u1e47i va\u1e47\u1e47\u0101 sa\u1e41jutt\u0101 aha va ti\u1e47\u1e47i catt\u0101ri / T\u0101\u1e47a\u1e41 duvvala-l\u014dva\u1e41 k\u0101\u016b\u1e47a kam\u014d pajuttavv\u014d\" \"When two, or three or four, consonants appear in combination, elide the weakest one, and continue the process.\" Here, \"weakest\" refers to sounds of higher sonority, and \"elide\" refers to either true elision/loss or total assimilation of the weaker sound to the stronger sound. Specifically, the sonority scale of Prakrit is (weakest) \"h\" &lt; \"r\" &lt; \"y\" &lt; \"v\" &lt; \"l\" &lt; nasals (\"m\", \"n\", \"\u1e47\", \"\u00f1\") &lt; \"s\" (representing OIA sibilant series) &lt; all stops (strongest). It will be helpful to keep this notion of \"stronger\" and \"weaker\" sounds in mind through the following sound changes. The relevant changes and organized below by approximate chronology.\nChanges after the split of Pali and Prakrit.\nThe following changes are only seen in Prakrit and not in Pali (other Pali-specific changes do also occur beyond this point).\nChanges up to Dramatic Prakrits.\nThese changes occur after Pali and Early Prakrit, but before the development of the dramatic regional Prakrits like Maharashtri Prakrit and Shauraseni Prakrit (ca. 200 AD).\nUp to Apabhramsha.\nThese changes occur after the dramatic Prakrits, and characterize the Late Prakrit, or Apabhramsha (Apa.), stage (ca. 900 AD).\nGrammar.\nMedieval grammarians such as Markandeya (late 16th century) describe a highly systematized Prakrit grammar, but the surviving Prakrit texts do not adhere to this grammar. For example, according to [Vishvanatha (14th century), in a Sanskrit drama, the characters should speak Maharashtri Prakrit in verse and Shauraseni Prakrit in prose. But the 10th century Sanskrit dramatist Rajashekhara does not abide by this rule. Markandeya, as well as later scholars such as Sten Konow, find faults with the Prakrit portions of Rajashekhara's writings, but it is not clear if the rule enunciated by Vishvanatha existed during Rajashekhara's time. Rajashekhara himself imagines Prakrit as a single language or a single kind of language, alongside Sanskrit, Apabhramsha, and Paishachi.\nGerman Indologist Theodor Bloch (1894) dismissed the medieval Prakrit grammarians as unreliable, arguing that they were not qualified to describe the language of the texts composed centuries before them. Other scholars such as Sten Konow, Richard Pischel and Alfred Hillebrandt disagree with Bloch. It is possible that the grammarians sought to codify only the language of the earliest classics of the Prakrit literature, such as the \"Gaha Sattasai\". Another explanation is that the extant Prakrit manuscripts contain scribal errors. Most of the surviving Prakrit manuscripts were produced in a variety of regional scripts during 1300\u20131800 CE. It appears that the scribes who made these copies from the earlier manuscripts did not have a good command of the original language of the texts, as several of the extant Prakrit texts contain inaccuracies or are incomprehensible.\nAlso, like Sanskrit and other ancient languages Prakrit was spoken and written long before grammars were written for it. The Vedas do not follow Panini's Sanskrit grammar which is now the basis for all Sanskrit grammar. Similarly, the Agamas, and texts like Shatkhandagama, do not follow the modern Prakrit grammar.\nPrakrita Prakasha, a book attributed to Vararuchi, summarizes various Prakrit languages.\nFollowing are the prominent works on Pr\u0101k\u1e5bta grammar available today:\nPrevalence.\nPrakrit literature was produced across a wide area of South Asia. Outside India, the language was also known in Cambodia and Java.\nLiterary Prakrit is often wrongly assumed to have been a language (or languages) spoken by the common people, because it is different from Sanskrit, which is the predominant language of the ancient Indian literature. Several modern scholars, such as George Abraham Grierson and Richard Pischel, have asserted that the literary Prakrit does not represent the actual languages spoken by the common people of ancient India. This theory is corroborated by a market scene in Uddyotana's \"Kuvalaya-mala\" (779 CE), in which the narrator speaks a few words in 18 different languages: some of these languages sound similar to the languages spoken in modern India; but none of them resemble the language that Uddyotana identifies as \"Prakrit\" and uses for narration throughout the text.The local variants of Apabhramsha evolved into the modern day Indo-Aryan vernaculars of South Asia.\nLiterature.\nLiterary Prakrit was among the main languages of the classical Indian culture. Dandin's \"Kavya-darsha\" (c.\u2009700) mentions four kinds of literary languages: Sanskrit, Prakrit, Apabhramsha, and mixed. Bhoja's \"Sarasvati-Kanthabharana\" (11th century) lists Prakrit among the few languages suitable for composition of literature. Mirza Khan's \"Tuhfat al-hind\" (1676) names Prakrit among the three kinds of literary languages native to India, the other two being Sanskrit and the vernacular languages. It describes Prakrit as a mixture of Sanskrit and vernacular languages, and adds that Prakrit was \"mostly employed in the praise of kings, ministers, and chiefs\".\nDuring a large period of the first millennium, literary Prakrit was the preferred language for the fictional romance in India. Its use as a language of systematic knowledge was limited, because of Sanskrit's dominance in this area, but nevertheless, Prakrit texts exist on topics such as grammar, lexicography, metrics, alchemy, medicine, divination, and gemology. In addition, the Jains used Prakrit for religious literature, including commentaries on the Jain canonical literature, stories about Jain figures, moral stories, hymns and expositions of Jain doctrine. Prakrit is also the language of some Shaiva \"tantras\" and Vaishnava hymns.\nBesides being the primary language of several texts, Prakrit also features as the language of low-class men and most women in the Sanskrit stage plays. American scholar Andrew Ollett traces the origin of the Sanskrit Kavya to Prakrit poems.\nSome of the texts that identify their language as Prakrit include:\nList of Prakrits.\nThe languages that have been labeled \"Prakrit\" in modern times include the following:\nNot all of these languages were actually called \"Prakrit\" in the ancient period.\nDramatic Prakrits.\nDramatic Prakrits were those that were used in dramas and other literature. Whenever dialogue was written in a Prakrit, the reader would also be provided with a Sanskrit translation.\nThe phrase \"Dramatic Prakrits\" often refers to three most prominent of them: Shauraseni Prakrit, Magadhi Prakrit, and Maharashtri Prakrit. However, there were a slew of other less commonly used Prakrits that also fall into this category. These include Prachya, Bahliki, Dakshinatya, Shakari, Chandali, Shabari, Abhiri, Dramili, and Odri. There was a strict structure to the use of these different Prakrits in dramas. Characters each spoke a different Prakrit based on their role and background; for example, Dramili was the language of \"forest-dwellers\", Sauraseni was spoken by \"the heroine and her female friends\", and Avanti was spoken by \"cheats and rogues\". Maharashtri and Shaurseni Prakrit were more common and were used in literature extensively.\nJain Prakrit.\nSome 19th\u201320th century European scholars, such as Hermann Jacobi and Ernst Leumann, made a distinction between Jain and non-Jain Prakrit literature. Jacobi used the term \"Jain Prakrit\" (or \"Jain Maharashtri\", as he called it) to denote the language of relatively late and relatively more Sanskrit-influenced narrative literature, as opposed to the earlier Prakrit court poetry. Later scholars used the term \"Jain Prakrit\" for any variety of Prakrit used by Jain authors, including the one used in early texts such as \"Tarangavati\" and \"Vasudeva-Hindi\". However, the works written by Jain authors do not necessarily belong to an exclusively Jain history, and do not show any specific literary features resulting from their belief in Jainism. Therefore, the division of Prakrit literature into Jain and non-Jain categories is no longer considered tenable.\nStatus.\nUnder the Mauryan Empire various Prakrits enjoyed the status of royal language. Prakrit was the language of Emperor Ashoka who was patron of Buddhism.\nPrakrit languages are said to have held a lower social status than Sanskrit in classical India. In the Sanskrit stage plays, such as Kalidasa's \"Shakuntala\", lead characters typically speak Sanskrit, while the unimportant characters and most female characters typically speak Prakrit.\nWhile Prakrits were originally seen as 'lower' forms of language, the influence they had on Sanskrit \u2013 allowing it to be more easily used by the common people \u2013 as well as the converse influence of Sanskrit on the Prakrits, gave Prakrits progressively higher cultural prestige.\nMirza Khan's \"Tuhfat al-hind\" (1676) characterizes Prakrit as the language of \"the lowest of the low\", stating that the language was known as \"Patal-bani\" (\"Language of the underground\") or \"Nag-bani\" (\"Language of the snakes\").\nAmong modern scholars, Prakrit literature has received less attention than Sanskrit.

{"id": "24501", "revid": "125972", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24501", "title": "Progressive music", "text": "Type of music that emphasizes expansion of form and stylistic variety\nProgressive music is music that attempts to expand existing stylistic boundaries associated with specific genres of music. The word comes from the basic concept of \"progress\", which refers to advancements through accumulation, and is often deployed in the context of distinct genres, with progressive rock being the most notable example. Music that is deemed \"progressive\" usually synthesizes influences from various cultural domains, such as European art music, Celtic folk, West Indian, or African. It is rooted in the idea of a cultural alternative, and may also be associated with auteur-stars and concept albums, considered traditional structures of the music industry.\nAs an art theory, the progressive approach falls between formalism and eclecticism. \"Formalism\" refers to a preoccupation with established external compositional systems, structural unity, and the autonomy of individual art works. Like formalism, \"eclecticism\" connotes a predilection toward style synthesis or integration. However, contrary to formalist tendencies, eclecticism foregrounds discontinuities between historical and contemporary styles and electronic media, sometimes referring simultaneously to vastly different musical genres, idioms, and cultural codes. In marketing, \"progressive\" is used to distinguish a product from \"commercial\" pop music. \nJazz.\nProgressive jazz is a form of big band that is more complex or experimental. It originated in the 1940s with arrangers who drew from modernist composers such as Igor Stravinsky and Paul Hindemith. Its \"progressive\" features were replete with dissonance, atonality, and brash effects. Progressive jazz was most popularized by the bandleader Stan Kenton during the 1940s. Critics were initially wary of the idiom. Dizzy Gillespie wrote in his autobiography: \"They tried to make Stan Kenton a 'white hope', called modern jazz and my music 'progressive', then tried to tell me I played 'progressive' music. I said, 'You're full of shit!' 'Stan Kenton? There ain't nothing in my music that's cold, cold like his.\"\nProgressive big band is a style of big band or swing music that was made for listening, with denser, more modernist arrangements and more room to improvise. The online music guide AllMusic states that, along with Kenton, musicians like Gil Evans, Toshiko Akiyoshi, Cal Massey, Frank Foster, Carla Bley, George Gruntz, David Amram, Sun Ra, and Duke Ellington were major proponents of the style.\nPop and rock.\nDefinitions.\n\"Progressive rock\" is almost synonymous with \"art rock\"; the latter is more likely to have experimental or avant-garde influences. Although a unidirectional English \"progressive\" style emerged in the late 1960s, by 1967 progressive rock had come to constitute a diversity of loosely associated style codes. With the arrival of a \"progressive\" label, the music was dubbed \"progressive pop\" before it was called \"progressive rock\". \"Progressive\" referred to the wide range of attempts to break with the standard pop music formula. A number of additional factors contributed to the label\u2014lyrics were more poetic, technology was harnessed for new sounds, music approached the condition of \"art\", the album format overtook singles, some harmonic language was imported from jazz and 19th-century classical music, and the studio, rather than the stage, became the focus of musical activity, which often involved creating music for listening, not dancing.\nBackground.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nUp until the mid 1960s, individual idiolects always operated within particular styles. What was so revolutionary about this post-hippie music that came to be called 'progressive'\u00a0... was that musicians acquired the facility to move between styles\u2014the umbilical link between idiolect and style had been broken.\n\u2014Allan Moore\nDuring the mid 1960s, pop music made repeated forays into new sounds, styles, and techniques that inspired public discourse among its listeners. The word \"progressive\" was frequently used, and it was thought that every song and single was to be a \"progression\" from the last. In 1966, the degree of social and artistic dialogue among rock musicians dramatically increased for bands such as the Beach Boys, the Beatles, and the Byrds who fused elements of composed (cultivated) music with the oral (vernacular) musical traditions of rock. Rock music started to take itself seriously, paralleling earlier attempts in jazz (as swing gave way to bop, a move which did not succeed with audiences). In this period, the popular song began signaling a new possible means of expression that went beyond the three-minute love song, leading to an intersection between the \"underground\" and the \"establishment\" for listening publics. The Beach Boys' leader Brian Wilson is credited for setting a precedent that allowed bands and artists to enter a recording studio and act as their own producers.\nThe music was developed immediately following a brief period in the mid 1960s where creative authenticity among musical artists and consumer marketing coincided with each other. Before the progressive pop of the late 1960s, performers were typically unable to decide on the artistic content of their music. Assisted by the mid 1960s economic boom, record labels began investing in artists, giving them freedom to experiment, and offering them limited control over their content and marketing. The growing student market serviced record labels with the word \"progressive\", being adopted as a marketing term to differentiate their product from \"commercial\" pop. Music critic Simon Reynolds writes that beginning with 1967, a divide would exist between \"progressive\" pop and \"mass/chart\" pop, a separation which was \"also, broadly, one between boys and girls, middle-class and working-class\". Before progressive/art rock became the most commercially successful British sound of the early 1970s, the 1960s psychedelic movement brought together art and commercialism, broaching the question of what it meant to be an artist in a mass medium. Progressive musicians thought that artistic status depended on personal autonomy, and so the strategy of \"progressive\" rock groups was to present themselves as performers and composers \"above\" normal pop practice.\n\"Proto-prog\" is a retrospective label for the first wave of progressive rock musicians. The musicians that approached this genre harnessed modern classical and other genres usually outside of traditional rock influences, longer and more complicated compositions, interconnected songs as medley, and studio composition. Progressive rock itself evolved from psychedelic/acid rock music, specifically a strain of classical/symphonic rock led by the Nice, Procol Harum, and the Moody Blues. Critics assumed King Crimson's debut album \"In the Court of the Crimson King\" (1969) to be the logical extension and development of late 1960s proto-progressive rock exemplified by the Moody Blues, Procol Harum, Pink Floyd, and the Beatles. According to Macan, the album may be the most influential to progressive rock for crystallizing the music of earlier \"proto-progressive bands\u00a0[...] into a distinctive, immediately recognizable style\". He distinguishes 1970s \"classic\" prog from late 1960s proto-prog by the conscious rejection of psychedelic rock elements, which proto-progressive bands continued to incorporate.\nProgressive rock and heavy metal merged into progressive metal in the 1980s. Early artists include Dream Theater and Symphony X. A subgenre of the progressive metal is the polyrhythmic djent. In the late 1990s, extreme metal subgenres were combined with progressive music. Progressive death metal (Opeth), progressive black metal (Ihsahn, Ne Obliviscaris) and progressive metalcore (Between the Buried and me).\nPost-progressive.\n\"Post-progressive\" is a term invented to distinguish a type of rock music from the persistent \"progressive rock\" style associated with the 1970s. In the mid to late 1970s, progressive music was denigrated for its assumed pretentiousness, specifically the likes of Yes, Genesis, and Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer. According to musicologist John Covach, \"by the early 1980s, progressive rock was thought to be all but dead as a style, an idea reinforced by the fact that some of the principal progressive groups has developed a more commercial sound. [...] What went out of the music of these now ex-progressive groups [...] was any significant evocation of art music.\" In the opinion of King Crimson's Robert Fripp, \"progressive\" music was an attitude, not a style. He believed that genuinely \"progressive\" music pushes stylistic and conceptual boundaries outwards through the appropriation of procedures from classical music or jazz, and that once \"progressive rock\" ceased to cover new ground \u2013 becoming a set of conventions to be repeated and imitated \u2013 the genre's premise had ceased to be \"progressive\". \nA direct reaction to prog came in the form of the punk movement, which rejected classical traditions, virtuosity, and textural complexity. Post-punk, which author Doyle Green characterizes \"as a kind of 'progressive punk'\", was played by bands like Talking Heads, Pere Ubu, Public Image Ltd, and Joy Division. It differs from punk rock by balancing punk's energy and skepticism with a re-engagement with an art school consciousness, Dadaist experimentalism, and atmospheric, ambient soundscapes. It was also majorly influenced from world music, especially African and Asian traditions. In the same period, new wave music was more sophisticated in production terms than some contemporaneous progressive music, but was largely perceived as simplistic, and thus had little overt appeal to art music or art-music practice. Musicologist Bill Martin writes; \"[Talking] Heads created a kind of new-wave music that was the perfect synthesis of punk urgency and attitude and progressive-rock sophistication and creativity. A good deal of the more interesting rock since that time is clearly 'post-Talking Heads' music, but this means that it is post-progressive rock as well.\"\nSoul and funk.\n\"Progressive soul\" is used by Martin to refer to a musical development in which many African-American recording artists by the 1970s were creating music in a manner similar to progressive rock. This development inspired greater musical diversity and sophistication, ambitious lyricism, and conceptual album-oriented approach in black pop. Among the musicians at its forefront were Sly Stone, Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye, Curtis Mayfield, and George Clinton. According to Geoffrey Himes, \"the short-lived progressive-soul movement flourished\" from 1968 to 1973 and demonstrated \"adventurous rock guitar, socially conscious lyrics and classic R&amp;B melody\". Similar to contemporaneous white prog musicians, progressive black musicians in the 1970s directed their creative control toward ideals of \"individualism, artistic progression and writing for posterity\", according to music academic Jay Keister, who notes that this pursuit sometimes conflicted with the collective political values of the Black Arts Movement.\nAmong the stylistic characteristics shared from progressive rock in black progressive music of this period were extended composition, diverse musical appropriation, and recording music intended for listening rather than dancing. Rather than the song-based extended compositions and suites of progressive white music, black counterparts in the 1970s generally unified an extended recording with an underlying rhythmic groove. Instrumental textures were altered in order to signify a change in section over an extended track's course. Examples of these characteristics include Funkadelic's \"Wars of Armageddon\" (1971) and Sun Ra's \"Space Is the Place\" (1973). Unlike the European art music appropriations used by white artists, progressive black music featured musical idioms from African and African-American music sources. However, some also borrowed elements from European American traditions to augment a song's lyrical idea. For example, Wonder added pleasant-sounding instrumental textures from a string section to \"Village Ghetto Land\" (1976), lending a sense of irony to an otherwise bleak critique of social ills in urban ghettos.\nElectronic.\n\"Progressive electronic\" is defined by AllMusic as a subgenre of new age music, and a style that \"thrives in more unfamiliar territory\" where the results are \"often dictated by the technology itself\". According to Allmusic, \"rather than sampling or synthesizing acoustic sounds to electronically replicate them\" producers of this music \"tend to mutate the original timbres, sometimes to an unrecognizable state\". Allmusic also states that \"true artists in the genre also create their own sounds\".\nTangerine Dream's 1974 album \"Phaedra\", recorded with a Moog sequencer, was described as \"an early masterpiece of progressive electronic music\" by \"Rolling Stone\". In house music, a desire to define precise stylistic strands and taste markets saw the interposition of prefixes like \"progressive\", \"tribal\", and \"intelligent\". According to disc jockey and producer Carl Craig, the term \"progressive\" was used in Detroit in the early 1980s in reference to Italian disco. The music was dubbed \"progressive\" because it drew upon the influence of Giorgio Moroder's Euro disco rather than the disco inspired by the symphonic Philadelphia sound. By 1993, progressive house and trance music had emerged in dance clubs. \"Progressive house\" was an English style of house distinguished by long tracks, big riffs, mild dub inflections, and multitiered percussion. According to Simon Reynolds, the \"'progressive' seemed to signify not just its anti-cheese, nongirly credentials, but its severing of house's roots from gay black disco\".\nIn the mid-1990s, the lowercase movement, a reductive approach towards new digital technologies, was spearheaded by a number of so-called \"progressive electronica\" artists.\nCriticism.\nReynolds posited in 2013 that \"the truly progressive edge in electronic music involves doing things that can't be physically achieved by human beings manipulating instruments in real-time\". He criticized terms like \"progressive\" and \"intelligent\", arguing that \"it's usually a sign that it's gearing up the media game as a prequel to buying into traditional music industry structure of auteur-stars, concept albums, and long-term careers. Above all, it's a sign of impending musical debility, creeping self-importance, and the hemorrhaging away of fun.\" Reynolds also identifies links between progressive rock and other electronic music genres, and that \"many post-rave genres bear an uncanny resemblance to progressive rock: conceptualism, auteur-geniuses, producers making music to impress other producers, [and] showboating virtuosity reborn as the 'science' of programming finesse\".\nHip hop.\n\"Progressive rap\" has been used by academics to describe a certain type of hip hop music. Anthony B. Pinn regards it as a thematic subset alongside gangsta rap and \"status rap\", which expresses concerns about social status and mobility. While exploring existential crises and philosophical contradictions similar to gangsta rap, progressive rap, he says, \"seeks to address these concerns without intracommunal aggression and in terms of political and cultural education, providing an interpretation of American society and a constructive agenda (e.g. self respect, knowledge, pride, and unity) for the uplift of Black America\". He adds that works of the genre also utilize \"a more overt dialogue with and interpretation of Black religiosity\". In a corollary analysis, fellow academic Evelyn L. Parker says that progressive rap \"seeks to transform systems of injustice by transforming the perspective of their victims\" while demonstrating \"the clear prophetic voice reflecting the rage caused by the dehumanizing injustices that African Americans experience\".\nEarly works of progressive rap such as the 1982 Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five song \"The Message\" and the music of Public Enemy featured expressions of anger about chaotic urban life. Other formative groups such as De La Soul, A Tribe Called Quest, and Brand Nubian helped establish the genre's thematic mode. At the turn of the 2000s, Outkast and The Roots were among the few progressive-rap acts who \"ruminated on hip-hop's post-millennial direction\" and \"produced records in an avant-garde vein purposely intended to evolve the music\" while achieving commercial success, according to Miles Marshall Lewis. Kanye West, another influential artist in hip hop's progressive tradition, achieved even greater success with his opening trilogy of education-themed albums in the 2000s. His 2010 album \"My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy\" has also been associated with prog-rap due largely to its sampling of records from progressive rock as well as its ostentatious sensibilities.\nThe UK has also produced notable performers in progressive rap, including Gaika and Kojey Radical, who are credited by \"Vice\" in 2016 for working \"deliberately outside the confines of grime and traditional UK hip hop to create genuinely progressive rap that rivals the US for creativity, urgency, and importance, and portrays a much broader black British music landscape than you hear on the radio\". More recently, American studies and media scholar William Hoynes highlights the progressive rap of Kendrick Lamar as being in the tradition of African-American art and activism that operated \"both inside and outside of the mainstream to advance a counterculture that opposes the racist stereotypes being propagated in white-owned media and culture\".\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "24503", "revid": "50925411", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24503", "title": "Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky", "text": "Russian composer (1840\u20131893)\nPyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky ( ; 7 May 1840 \u2013 6 November 1893) was a Russian composer of the Romantic period. He was the first Russian composer whose music made a lasting impression internationally. Tchaikovsky wrote some of the most popular concert and theatrical music in the classical repertoire, including the ballets \"Swan Lake\" and \"The Nutcracker\", the \"1812 Overture\", his First Piano Concerto, Violin Concerto, the \"Romeo and Juliet\" Overture-Fantasy, several symphonies, and the opera \"Eugene Onegin\".\nAlthough musically precocious, Tchaikovsky was educated for a career as a civil servant as there was little opportunity for a musical career in Russia at the time and no public music education system. When an opportunity for such an education arose, he entered the nascent Saint Petersburg Conservatory, from which he graduated in 1865. The formal Western-oriented teaching Tchaikovsky received there set him apart from composers of the contemporary nationalist movement embodied by the Russian composers of The Five, with whom his professional relationship was mixed.\nTchaikovsky's training set him on a path to reconcile what he had learned with the native musical practices to which he had been exposed from childhood. From that reconciliation, he forged a personal but unmistakably Russian style. The principles that governed melody, harmony, and other fundamentals of Russian music diverged from those that governed Western European music. There seemed to be little potential for using Russian music in large-scale Western composition or for forming a composite style, and this caused personal antipathies that dented Tchaikovsky's self-confidence. Russian culture exhibited a split personality, with its native and adopted elements having drifted apart increasingly since the time of Peter the Great. That resulted in uncertainty among the intelligentsia about the country's national identity, an ambiguity mirrored in Tchaikovsky's career.\nDespite his many popular successes, Tchaikovsky's life was punctuated by personal crises and depression. Contributory factors included his early separation from his mother for boarding school followed by her early death, the death of his close friend and colleague Nikolai Rubinstein, his failed marriage to Antonina Miliukova, and the collapse of his 13-year association with the wealthy patroness Nadezhda von Meck. Tchaikovsky's homosexuality, which he kept private, has traditionally also been considered a major factor, though some scholars have downplayed its importance. His dedication of his Sixth symphony to his nephew Vladimir Davydov and the feelings he expressed about Davydov in letters to others have been cited as evidence for romantic love between the two. Tchaikovsky's sudden death at the age of 53 is generally ascribed to cholera, but there is an ongoing debate as to whether cholera was indeed the cause and whether the death was intentional.\nWhile his music has remained popular among audiences, critical opinions were initially mixed. Some Russians did not feel it sufficiently represented native musical values and expressed suspicion that Europeans accepted the music for its Western elements. In an apparent reinforcement of that claim, some Europeans lauded Tchaikovsky for offering music more substantive than exoticism, and said he transcended the stereotypes of Russian classical music. Others dismissed Tchaikovsky's music as deficient because it did not stringently follow Western principles.\nEarly life and education.\nTchaikovsky was born on 7 May 1840 in Votkinsk, a small town in Vyatka Governorate during the Russian Empire in present-day Udmurtia near the banks of the Kama River. His father, Ilya Petrovich Tchaikovsky, served as a lieutenant colonel and engineer in the Department of Mines and managed the Ironworks in Kamsko-Votkinsk. His grandfather, Pyotr Fedorovich Tchaikovsky, was born in the village of Nikolaevka, Yekaterinoslav Governorate, Russian Empire in present-day Mykolaivka, Ukraine, and served first as a physician's assistant in the army and later as city governor of Glazov in Vyatka. His great-grandfather, a Zaporozhian Cossack named Fyodor Chaika, served in the Russian military at the Battle of Poltava in 1709.\nTchaikovsky's mother, Alexandra Andreyevna (n\u00e9e d'Assier), was the second of Ilya's three wives; his first wife died several years before Pyotr's birth. She was 18 years younger than her husband and was of French and German ethnicity through her paternal side. Both Ilya and Alexandra were trained in the arts, including music. Of his six siblings, Tchaikovsky was close to his sister Alexandra and twin brothers Anatoly and Modest. Alexandra's marriage to Lev Davydov produced seven children and lent Tchaikovsky the only real family life he knew as an adult, especially during his years of wandering. One of those children, Vladimir Davydov, who went by the nickname \"Bob\", became very close to him.\nIn 1844, the family hired Fanny D\u00fcrbach, a 22-year-old French governess. Four-and-a-half-year-old Tchaikovsky was initially thought too young to study alongside his older brother Nikolai and a niece of the family. His insistence convinced D\u00fcrbach otherwise. By age six, he was fluent in French and German. Tchaikovsky also became attached to D\u00fcrbach; her affection for him reportedly counterbalanced his mother's coldness and emotional distance, though others assert that the mother doted on her son. D\u00fcrbach saved much of Tchaikovsky's work from this period, including his earliest known compositions, and became a source of several childhood anecdotes.\nTchaikovsky began piano lessons at the age of five. Within three years he had become as adept at reading sheet music as his teacher. Tchaikovsky's parents, initially supportive, hired a tutor, bought an orchestrion, a form of barrel organ that could imitate elaborate orchestral effects, and encouraged his piano study for both aesthetic and practical reasons. But in 1850 they sent Tchaikovsky to the Imperial School of Jurisprudence in Saint Petersburg. They had both graduated from institutes in Saint Petersburg and the School of Jurisprudence, which mainly served the lesser nobility, and thought that this education would prepare Tchaikovsky for a career as a civil servant. Regardless of talent, the only musical careers available in Russia at that time\u2014except for the affluent aristocracy\u2014were as a teacher in an academy or as an instrumentalist in one of the Imperial Theaters. Both were considered on the lowest rank of the social ladder, with individuals in them enjoying no more rights than peasants.\nTchaikovsky's father's income was also growing increasingly uncertain, so both parents may have wanted Tchaikovsky to become independent as soon as possible. As the minimum age for acceptance was 12 and Tchaikovsky was only 10 at the time, he was required to spend two years boarding at the Imperial School of Jurisprudence's preparatory school, from his family. Once those two years had passed, Tchaikovsky transferred to the Imperial School of Jurisprudence to begin a seven-year course of study.\nTchaikovsky's early separation from his mother, despite the aforementioned alleged distant relationship, caused emotional trauma that lasted the rest of his life and was intensified by her death from cholera in 1854, when he was 14. The loss of his mother also prompted Tchaikovsky to make his first serious attempt at composition, a waltz in her memory. Tchaikovsky's father, who had also contracted cholera but recovered, sent him back to school immediately in the hope that classwork would occupy the boy's mind. Isolated, Tchaikovsky compensated with friendships with fellow students that became lifelong; these included Aleksey Apukhtin and Vladimir Gerard.\nMusic, while not an official priority at school, also bridged the gap between Tchaikovsky and his peers. They regularly attended the opera and Tchaikovsky improvised at the school's harmonium on themes he and his friends had sung during choir practice. \"We were amused\", Gerard later remembered, \"but not imbued with any expectations of his future glory\". Tchaikovsky also continued his piano studies with Franz Becker, an instrument manufacturer who made occasional visits to the school, but the results, according to the musicologist David Brown, were \"negligible\".\nIn 1855, Tchaikovsky's father funded private lessons with Rudolph K\u00fcndinger and questioned him about a musical career for his son. While impressed with the boy's talent, K\u00fcndinger said he saw nothing to suggest a future composer or performer. He later admitted that his assessment was also based on his own bad experiences as a musician in Russia and his unwillingness for Tchaikovsky to be treated likewise. Tchaikovsky was told to finish his course and then try for a post in the Ministry of Justice.\nCareer.\nOn 10 June 1859, the 19-year-old Tchaikovsky graduated as a titular counselor, a low rung on the civil service ladder. Appointed to the Ministry of Justice, he became a junior assistant within six months and a senior assistant two months after that. He remained a senior assistant for the rest of his three-year civil service career.\nMeanwhile, the Russian Musical Society (RMS) was founded in 1859 by the Grand Duchess Elena Pavlovna (a German-born aunt of Tsar Alexander II) and her prot\u00e9g\u00e9, the pianist and composer Anton Rubinstein. Previous tsars and the aristocracy had focused almost exclusively on importing European talent. The aim of the RMS was to fulfill Alexander II's wish to foster native talent. It hosted a regular season of public concerts (previously held only during the six weeks of Lent when the Imperial Theaters were closed) and provided basic professional training in music. In 1861, Tchaikovsky attended RMS classes in music theory taught by Nikolai Zaremba at the Mikhailovsky Palace (now the Russian Museum). These classes were a precursor to the Saint Petersburg Conservatory, which opened in 1862. Tchaikovsky enrolled at the Conservatory as part of its premiere class. He studied harmony and counterpoint with Zaremba and instrumentation and composition with Rubinstein. He was awarded a silver medal for his thesis, a cantata on Friedrich Schiller's \"Ode to Joy\".\nThe Conservatory benefited Tchaikovsky in two ways. It transformed him into a musical professional, with tools to help him thrive as a composer, and the in-depth exposure to European principles and musical forms gave him a sense that his art was not exclusively native or foreign. This mindset became important in Tchaikovsky's reconciliation of Russian and Western European influences in his compositional style. He believed and attempted to show that both these aspects were \"intertwined and mutually dependent\". His efforts became both an inspiration and a starting point for other Russian composers to build their own individual styles.\nRubinstein was impressed by Tchaikovsky's musical talent on the whole and cited him as \"a composer of genius\" in his autobiography. He was less pleased with the more progressive tendencies of some of Tchaikovsky's student work. Nor did he change his opinion as Tchaikovsky's reputation grew. He and Zaremba clashed with Tchaikovsky when he submitted his First Symphony for performance by the Russian Musical Society in Saint Petersburg. Rubinstein and Zaremba refused to consider the work unless substantial changes were made. Tchaikovsky complied but they still refused to perform the symphony. Tchaikovsky, distressed that he had been treated as though he were still their student, withdrew the symphony. It was given its first complete performance, minus the changes Rubinstein and Zaremba had requested, in Moscow in February 1868.\nOnce Tchaikovsky graduated in 1865, Rubinstein's brother Nikolai offered him the post of Professor of Music Theory at the soon-to-open Moscow Conservatory. While the salary for his professorship was only 50 rubles a month, the offer itself boosted Tchaikovsky's morale and he accepted the post eagerly. He was further heartened by news of the first public performance of one of his works, his \"Characteristic Dances\", conducted by Johann Strauss II at a concert in Pavlovsk Park on 11 September 1865 (Tchaikovsky later included this work, re-titled \"Dances of the Hay Maidens\", in his opera \"The Voyevoda\").\nFrom 1867 to 1878, Tchaikovsky combined his professorial duties with music criticism while continuing to compose. This activity exposed him to a range of contemporary music and afforded him the opportunity to travel abroad. In his reviews, he praised Ludwig van Beethoven, considered Johannes Brahms overrated and, despite his admiration, took Schumann to task for poor orchestration. He appreciated the staging of Richard Wagner's \"Der Ring des Nibelungen\" at its premi\u00e8re at the Bayreuth Festival, but not the music, calling \"Das Rheingold\" \"unlikely nonsense, through which, from time to time, sparkle unusually beautiful and astonishing details\". A recurring theme he addressed was the poor state of Russian opera.\nRelationship with The Five.\nIn 1856, while Tchaikovsky was still at the School of Jurisprudence and Anton Rubinstein lobbied aristocrats to form the Russian Musical Society, the critic Vladimir Stasov and an 18-year-old pianist, Mily Balakirev, met and agreed upon a nationalist agenda for Russian music, one that would take the operas of Mikhail Glinka as a model and incorporate elements from folk music, reject traditional Western practices and use non-Western harmonic devices such as the whole tone and octatonic scales. They saw Western-style conservatories as unnecessary and antipathetic to fostering native talent.\nMily Balakirev, C\u00e9sar Cui, Modest Mussorgsky, Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov and Alexander Borodin became known as the \"moguchaya kuchka\", translated into English as the \"Mighty Handful\" or \"The Five\". Rubinstein criticized their emphasis on amateur efforts in musical composition; Balakirev and later Mussorgsky attacked Rubinstein for his musical conservatism and his belief in professional music training. Tchaikovsky and his fellow conservatory students were caught in the middle.\nWhile ambivalent about much of The Five's music, Tchaikovsky remained on friendly terms with most of its members. In 1869, he and Balakirev worked together on what became Tchaikovsky's first recognized masterpiece, the fantasy-overture \"Romeo and Juliet\", a work which The Five wholeheartedly embraced. The group also welcomed his Second Symphony, later nicknamed the \"Little Russian\". Despite their support, Tchaikovsky made considerable efforts to ensure his musical independence from the group as well as from the conservative faction at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory.\nOpera composer.\nThe infrequency of Tchaikovsky's musical successes, won with tremendous effort, exacerbated his lifelong sensitivity to criticism. Nikolai Rubinstein's private fits of rage critiquing his music, such as attacking the First Piano Concerto, did not help matters. His popularity grew, however, as several first-rate artists became willing to perform his compositions. Hans von B\u00fclow premiered the First Piano Concerto and championed other Tchaikovsky works both as pianist and conductor. Other artists included Adele aus der Ohe, Max Erdmannsd\u00f6rfer, Eduard N\u00e1pravn\u00edk and Sergei Taneyev.\nAnother factor that helped Tchaikovsky's music become popular was a shift in attitude among Russian audiences. Whereas they had previously been satisfied with flashy virtuoso performances of technically demanding but musically lightweight works, they gradually began listening with increasing appreciation of the composition itself. Tchaikovsky's works were performed frequently, with few delays between their composition and first performances; the publication from 1867 onward of his songs and great piano music for the home market also helped boost the composer's popularity.\nDuring the late 1860s, Tchaikovsky began to compose operas. His first, \"The Voyevoda\", based on a play by Alexander Ostrovsky, premiered in 1869. The composer became dissatisfied with it, however, and, having re-used parts of it in later works, destroyed the manuscript. \"Undina\" followed in 1870. Only excerpts were performed and it, too, was destroyed. Between these projects, Tchaikovsky started to compose an opera called \"Mandragora\", to a libretto by Sergei Rachinskii; the only music he completed was a short chorus of Flowers and Insects.\nThe first Tchaikovsky opera to survive intact, \"The Oprichnik\", premiered in 1874. During its composition, he lost Ostrovsky's part-finished libretto. Tchaikovsky, too embarrassed to ask for another copy, decided to write the libretto himself, modeling his dramatic technique on that of Eug\u00e8ne Scribe. Cui wrote a \"characteristically savage press attack\" on the opera. Mussorgsky, writing to Vladimir Stasov, disapproved of the opera as pandering to the public. Nevertheless, \"The Oprichnik\" continues to be performed from time to time in Russia.\nThe last of the early operas, \"Vakula the Smith\" (Op. 14), was composed in the second half of 1874. The libretto, based on Nikolai Gogol's \"Christmas Eve\", was to have been set to music by Alexander Serov. With Serov's death, the libretto was opened to a competition with a guarantee that the winning entry would be premiered by the Imperial Mariinsky Theatre. Tchaikovsky was declared the winner, but at the 1876 premiere, the opera enjoyed only a lukewarm reception. After Tchaikovsky's death, Rimsky-Korsakov wrote the opera \"Christmas Eve\", based on the same story.\nOther works of this period include the \"Variations on a Rococo Theme\" for cello and orchestra, the Third and Fourth Symphonies, the ballet \"Swan Lake\", and the opera \"Eugene Onegin\".\nTchaikovsky remained abroad for a year after the disintegration of his marriage. During this time, he completed \"Eugene Onegin\", orchestrated his Fourth Symphony, and composed the Violin Concerto. He returned briefly to the Moscow Conservatory in the autumn of 1879. For the next few years, assured of a regular income from von Meck, he traveled incessantly throughout Europe and rural Russia, mainly alone, and avoided social contact whenever possible.\nDuring this time, Tchaikovsky's foreign reputation grew and a positive reassessment of his music also took place in Russia, thanks in part to the novelist Fyodor Dostoevsky's call for \"universal unity\" with the West at the unveiling of the Pushkin Monument in Moscow in 1880. Before Dostoevsky's speech, Tchaikovsky's music had been considered \"overly dependent on the West\". As Dostoevsky's message spread throughout Russia, this stigma toward Tchaikovsky's music evaporated. The unprecedented acclaim for him even drew a cult following among the young intelligentsia of Saint Petersburg, including Alexandre Benois, L\u00e9on Bakst and Sergei Diaghilev.\nTwo musical works from this period stand out. With the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour nearing completion in Moscow in 1880, the 25th anniversary of the coronation of Alexander II in 1881, and the 1882 Moscow Arts and Industry Exhibition in the planning stage, Nikolai Rubinstein suggested that Tchaikovsky compose a grand commemorative piece. Tchaikovsky agreed and finished it within six weeks. He wrote to Nadezhda von Meck that this piece, the \"1812 Overture\", would be \"very loud and noisy, but I wrote it with no warm feeling of love, and therefore there will probably be no artistic merits in it\". He also warned the conductor Eduard N\u00e1pravn\u00edk that \"I shan't be at all surprised and offended if you find that it is in a style unsuitable for symphony concerts\". Nevertheless, the overture became, for many, \"the piece by Tchaikovsky they know best\", particularly well-known for the use of cannon in the scores.\nOn 23 March 1881, Nikolai Rubinstein died in Paris. That December, Tchaikovsky started work on his Piano Trio in A\u00a0minor, \"dedicated to the memory of a great artist\". First performed privately at the Moscow Conservatory on the first anniversary of Rubinstein's death, the piece became extremely popular during the composer's lifetime; in November 1893, it would become Tchaikovsky's own elegy at memorial concerts in Moscow and St. Petersburg.\nReturn to Russia.\nIn 1884, Tchaikovsky began to shed his unsociability and restlessness. That March, Emperor Alexander III conferred upon him the Order of Saint Vladimir (fourth class), which included a title of hereditary nobility and a personal audience with the Tsar. This was seen as a seal of official approval which advanced Tchaikovsky's social standing and might have been cemented in the composer's mind by the success of his Orchestral Suite No. 3 at its January 1885 premiere in Saint Petersburg.\nIn 1885, Alexander III requested a new production of \"Eugene Onegin\" at the Bolshoi Kamenny Theatre in Saint Petersburg. By having the opera staged there and not at the Mariinsky Theatre, he served notice that Tchaikovsky's music was replacing Italian opera as the official imperial art. In addition, at the instigation of Ivan Vsevolozhsky, Director of the Imperial Theaters and a patron of the composer, Tchaikovsky was awarded a lifetime annual pension of 3,000 rubles from the Tsar. This made him the premier court composer, in practice if not in the actual title.\nDespite Tchaikovsky's disdain for public life, he now participated in it as part of his increasing celebrity and out of a duty he felt to promote Russian music. He helped support his former pupil Sergei Taneyev, who was now director of Moscow Conservatory, by attending student examinations and negotiating the sometimes sensitive relations among various members of the staff. He served as director of the Moscow branch of the Russian Musical Society during the 1889\u20131890 season. In this post, he invited many international celebrities to conduct, including Brahms, Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k and Jules Massenet.\nDuring this period, Tchaikovsky also began promoting Russian music as a conductor, In January 1887, he substituted, on short notice, at the Bolshoi Theater in Moscow for performances of his opera \"Cherevichki\". Within a year, he was in considerable demand throughout Europe and Russia. These appearances helped him overcome life-long stage fright and boosted his self-assurance. In 1888, Tchaikovsky led the premiere of his Fifth Symphony in Saint Petersburg, repeating the work a week later with the first performance of his tone poem \"Hamlet\". Although critics proved hostile, with C\u00e9sar Cui calling the symphony \"routine\" and \"meretricious\", both works were received with extreme enthusiasm by audiences and Tchaikovsky, undeterred, continued to conduct the symphony in Russia and Europe. Conducting brought him to the United States in 1891, where he led the New York Music Society's orchestra in his \"Festival Coronation March\" at the inaugural concert of Carnegie Hall.\nBelyayev circle and growing reputation.\nIn November 1887, Tchaikovsky arrived at Saint Petersburg in time to hear several of the Russian Symphony Concerts, devoted exclusively to the music of Russian composers. One included the first complete performance of his revised First Symphony; another featured the final version of Third Symphony of Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, with whose circle Tchaikovsky was already in touch.\nRimsky-Korsakov, with Alexander Glazunov, Anatoly Lyadov and several other nationalistically-minded composers and musicians, had formed a group known as the Belyayev circle, named after a merchant and amateur musician who became an influential music patron and publisher. Tchaikovsky spent much time in this circle, becoming far more at ease with them than he had been with the 'Five' and increasingly confident in showcasing his music alongside theirs. This relationship lasted until Tchaikovsky's death.\nIn 1892, Tchaikovsky was voted a member of the Acad\u00e9mie des Beaux-Arts in France, only the second Russian subject to be so honored (the first was the sculptor Mark Antokolsky). The following year, the University of Cambridge in England awarded Tchaikovsky an honorary Doctor of Music degree.\nPersonal life.\nDiscussion of Tchaikovsky's personal life, especially his sexuality, has perhaps been among the most extensive of any composer in the 19th century and certainly of any Russian composer of his time. It has also at times caused considerable confusion, from Soviet efforts to expunge all references to homosexuality and portray him as a heterosexual, to efforts at analysis by Western biographers.\nBiographers have generally agreed that Tchaikovsky was homosexual. He sought the company of other men in his circle for extended periods, \"associating openly and establishing professional connections with them.\" His first love was reportedly Sergey Kireyev, a younger fellow student at the Imperial School of Jurisprudence. According to Modest Tchaikovsky, this was Pyotr Ilyich's \"strongest, longest and purest love\". Tchaikovsky's dedication of his Sixth symphony to his nephew Vladimir \"Bob\" Davydov (21 at the time) and his feelings expressed about Davydov in letters to others, has been cited as evidence for romantic love between the two. The degree to which the composer might have felt comfortable with his sexual desires has, however, remained open to debate. It is still unknown whether Tchaikovsky, according to the musicologist and biographer David Brown, \"felt tainted within himself, defiled by something from which he finally realized he could never escape\" or whether, according to Alexander Poznansky, he experienced \"no unbearable guilt\" over his sexual desires and \"eventually came to see his sexual peculiarities as an insurmountable and even natural part of his personality\u00a0... without experiencing any serious psychological damage\".\nRelevant portions of his brother Modest's autobiography, where he tells of the composer's same-sex attraction, have been published, as have letters previously suppressed by Soviet censors in which Tchaikovsky openly writes of it. Such censorship has persisted in the Russian government, resulting in many officials, including the former culture minister Vladimir Medinsky, denying his homosexuality outright. Passages in Tchaikovsky's letters which reveal his homosexual desires have been censored in Russia. In one such passage he said of a homosexual acquaintance: \"Petashenka used to drop by with the criminal intention of observing the Cadet Corps, which is right opposite our windows, but I've been trying to discourage these compromising visits\u2014and with some success.\" In another one, he wrote: \"After our walk, I offered him some money, which was refused. He does it for the love of art and adores men with beards.\"\nTchaikovsky lived as a bachelor for most of his life. In 1868, he met Belgian soprano D\u00e9sir\u00e9e Art\u00f4t with whom he considered marriage, but, owing to various circumstances, the relationship ended. Tchaikovsky later claimed she was the only woman he ever loved. In 1877, at the age of 37, he wed a former student, Antonina Miliukova. The marriage was a disaster. Mismatched psychologically and sexually, the couple lived together for only two and a half months before Tchaikovsky left, overwrought emotionally and suffering from acute writer's block. Tchaikovsky's family remained supportive of him during this crisis and throughout his life. Tchaikovsky's marital debacle may have forced him to face the full truth about his sexuality; he never blamed Antonina for the failure of their marriage.\nTchaikovsky was also aided by Nadezhda von Meck, the widow of a railway magnate, who had begun contact with him not long before the marriage. As well as an important friend and emotional support, she became his patroness for the next 13 years, which allowed him to focus exclusively on composition. Although Tchaikovsky called her his \"best friend\", they agreed never to meet under any circumstances.\nDeath.\nOn 16/28 October 1893, Tchaikovsky conducted the premiere of his Sixth Symphony, the \"Path\u00e9tique\", in Saint Petersburg. Nine days later, on 6 November, Tchaikovsky died there, aged 53. He was interred in Tikhvin Cemetery at the Alexander Nevsky Monastery, near the graves of his fellow-composers Alexander Borodin, Mikhail Glinka, and Modest Mussorgsky; later, Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov and Mily Balakirev were also buried nearby.\nTchaikovsky's death is attributed to cholera, caused by drinking unboiled water at a local restaurant. In the 1980s in Britain, however, there was academic speculation that he killed himself, either with poison or by contracting cholera intentionally; in the \"New Grove Dictionary of Music\", Roland John Wiley wrote: \"the polemics over Tchaikovsky's death have reached an impasse ... . As for illness, problems of evidence offer little hope of satisfactory resolution: the state of diagnosis; the confusion of witnesses; disregard of long-term effects of smoking and alcohol. We do not know how Tchaikovsky died. We may never find out.\"\nMusic.\nAntecedents and influences.\nOf Tchaikovsky's Western predecessors, Robert Schumann stands out as an influence in formal structure, harmonic practices, and piano writing, according to Brown and the musicologist Roland John Wiley. Boris Asafyev comments that Schumann left his mark on Tchaikovsky not just as a formal influence but also as an example of musical dramaturgy and self-expression. Leon Botstein argues the music of Franz Liszt and Richard Wagner also left their imprints on Tchaikovsky's orchestral style. The late-Romantic trend for writing orchestral suites, begun by Franz Lachner, Jules Massenet, and Joachim Raff after the rediscovery of Johann Sebastian Bach's works in that genre, may have influenced Tchaikovsky to try his own hand at them.\nTchaikovsky's teacher Anton Rubinstein's opera \"The Demon\" became a model for the final tableau of \"Eugene Onegin\". So did L\u00e9o Delibes' ballets \"Copp\u00e9lia\" and \"Sylvia\" for \"The Sleeping Beauty\" and Georges Bizet's opera \"Carmen\" (a work Tchaikovsky admired tremendously) for \"The Queen of Spades\". Otherwise, it was to composers of the past that Tchaikovsky turned\u2014Beethoven, whose music he respected; Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, whom he considered his favourite composer; Glinka, whose opera \"A Life for the Tsar\" made an indelible impression on him as a child and whose scoring he studied assiduously; and Adolphe Adam, whose ballet \"Giselle\" was a favorite of his from his student days and whose score he consulted while working on \"The Sleeping Beauty\". Beethoven\u2019s symphonies and string quartets may have influenced Tchaikovsky's attempts in the mediums. Other composers whose work interested Tchaikovsky included Hector Berlioz, Felix Mendelssohn, Giacomo Meyerbeer, Gioachino Rossini, Giuseppe Verdi, Vincenzo Bellini, Carl Maria von Weber and Henry Litolff.\nCreative range.\nTchaikovsky displayed a wide stylistic and emotional range, from light salon works to grand symphonies. Some of his works, such as the \"Variations on a Rococo Theme\", employ a \"Classical\" form reminiscent of 18th-century composers such as Mozart. Other compositions, such as his \"Little Russian\" symphony and his opera \"Vakula the Smith\", flirt with musical practices more akin to those of the 'Five', especially in their use of folk song. Other works, such as Tchaikovsky's last three symphonies, employ a personal musical idiom that facilitated intense emotional expression.\nCompositional style.\nMelody.\nThe American music critic and journalist Harold C. Schonberg wrote of Tchaikovsky's \"sweet, inexhaustible, supersensuous fund of melody\", a feature that has ensured his music's continued success with audiences. Tchaikovsky's complete range of melodic styles was as wide as that of his compositions. Sometimes he used Western-style melodies, sometimes original melodies written in the style of Russian folk song; sometimes he used actual folk songs. According to \"The New Grove\", Tchaikovsky's melodic gift could also become his worst enemy in two ways.\nThe first challenge arose from his ethnic heritage. Unlike Western themes, the melodies that Russian composers wrote tended to be self-contained: they functioned with a mindset of stasis and repetition rather than one of progress and ongoing development. On a technical level, it made modulating to a new key to introduce a contrasting second theme exceedingly difficult, as this was literally a foreign concept that did not exist in Russian music.\nThe second way melody worked against Tchaikovsky was a challenge that he shared with the majority of Romantic-age composers. They did not write in the regular, symmetrical melodic shapes that worked well with sonata form, such as those favored by Classical composers such as Joseph Haydn, Mozart or Beethoven; rather, the themes favored by Romantics were complete and independent in themselves. This completeness hindered their use as structural elements in combination with one another. This challenge was why the Romantics \"were never natural symphonists\". All a composer like Tchaikovsky could do with them was to essentially repeat them, even when he modified them to generate tension, maintain interest, and satisfy listeners.\nHarmony.\nHarmony could be a potential trap for Tchaikovsky, according to Brown, since Russian creativity tended to focus on inertia and self-enclosed tableaux, while Western harmony worked against this to propel the music onward and, on a larger scale, shape it. Modulation, the shifting from one key to another, was a driving principle in both harmony and sonata form, the primary Western large-scale musical structure since the middle of the 18th century. Modulation maintained harmonic interest over an extended time scale, provided a clear contrast between musical themes, and showed how those themes were related to each other.\nOne point in Tchaikovsky's favor was \"a flair for harmony\" that \"astonished\" Rudolph K\u00fcndinger, Tchaikovsky's music tutor during his time at the School of Jurisprudence. Added to what he learned at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory studies, this talent allowed Tchaikovsky to employ a varied range of harmony in his music, from the Western harmonic and textural practices of his first two string quartets to the use of the whole-tone scale in the center of the finale of the Second Symphony, a practice more typically used by The Five.\nRhythm.\nRhythmically, Tchaikovsky sometimes experimented with unusual meters. More often, he used a firm, regular meter, a practice that served him well in dance music. At times, his rhythms became pronounced enough to become the main expressive agent of the music. They also became a means, found typically in Russian folk music, of simulating movement or progression in large-scale symphonic movements\u2014a \"synthetic propulsion\", as Brown phrases it, which substituted for the momentum that would be created in strict sonata form by the interaction of melodic or motivic elements. This interaction generally does not take place in Russian music.\nStructure.\nTchaikovsky struggled with sonata form. Its principle of organic growth through the interplay of musical themes was alien to Russian practice. The traditional argument that Tchaikovsky seemed unable to develop themes in this manner fails to consider this point; it also discounts the possibility that Tchaikovsky might have intended the development passages in his large-scale works to act as \"enforced hiatuses\" to build tension, rather than grow organically as smoothly progressive musical arguments.\nAccording to Brown and the musicologists Hans Keller and Daniel Zhitomirsky, Tchaikovsky found his solution to large-scale structure while composing the Fourth Symphony. He essentially sidestepped thematic interaction and kept sonata form only as an \"outline\", as Zhitomirsky phrases it. Within this outline, the focus centered on periodic alternation and juxtaposition. Tchaikovsky placed blocks of dissimilar tonal and thematic material alongside one another, with what Keller calls \"new and violent contrasts\" between musical themes, keys, and harmonies. This process, according to Brown and Keller, builds momentum and adds intense drama. While the result, John Warrack charges, is still \"an ingenious episodic treatment of two tunes rather than a symphonic development of them\" in the Germanic sense, Brown counters that it took the listener of the period \"through a succession of often highly charged sections which \"added up\" to a radically new kind of symphonic experience\" (italics Brown), one that functioned not on the basis of summation, as Austro-German symphonies did, but on one of accumulation.\nPartly owing to the melodic and structural intricacies involved in this accumulation and partly due to the composer's nature, Tchaikovsky's music became intensely expressive. This intensity was entirely new to Russian music and prompted some Russians to place Tchaikovsky's name alongside that of Dostoevsky. The German musicologist Hermann Kretzschmar credits Tchaikovsky in his later symphonies with offering \"full images of life, developed freely, sometimes even dramatically, around psychological contrasts ... This music has the mark of the truly lived and felt experience\". Leon Botstein, in elaborating on this comment, suggests that listening to Tchaikovsky's music \"became a psychological mirror connected to everyday experience, one that reflected on the dynamic nature of the listener's own emotional self\". This active engagement with the music \"opened for the listener a vista of emotional and psychological tension and an extremity of feeling that possessed relevance because it seemed reminiscent of one's own 'truly lived and felt experience' or one's search for intensity in a deeply personal sense\".\nRepetition.\nAs mentioned above, repetition was a natural part of Tchaikovsky's music, just as it is an integral part of Russian music. His use of sequences within melodies (repeating a tune at a higher or lower pitch in the same voice) could go on for extreme length. The problem with repetition is that, over a period of time, the melody being repeated remains static, even when there is a surface level of rhythmic activity added to it. Tchaikovsky kept the musical conversation flowing by treating melody, tonality, rhythm and sound color as one integrated unit, rather than as separate elements.\nBy making subtle but noticeable changes in the rhythm or phrasing of a tune, modulating to another key, changing the melody itself or varying the instruments playing it, Tchaikovsky could keep a listener's interest from flagging. By extending the number of repetitions, he could increase the musical and dramatic tension of a passage, building \"into an emotional experience of almost unbearable intensity\", as Brown phrases it, controlling when the peak and release of that tension would take place. The musicologist Martin Cooper calls this practice a subtle form of unifying a piece of music and adds that Tchaikovsky brought it to a high point of refinement. (For more on this practice, see the next section.)\nOrchestration.\nLike other late Romantic composers, Tchaikovsky relied heavily on orchestration for musical effects. Tchaikovsky, however, became noted for the \"sensual opulence\" and \"voluptuous timbrel virtuosity\" of his orchestration. Like Glinka, Tchaikovsky tended toward bright primary colors and sharply delineated contrasts of texture. However, beginning with the Third Symphony, Tchaikovsky experimented with an increased range of timbres. Tchaikovsky's scoring was noted and admired by some of his peers. Rimsky-Korsakov regularly referred his students at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory to it and called it \"devoid of all striving after effect, [to] give a healthy, beautiful sonority\". This sonority, the musicologist Richard Taruskin pointed out, is essentially Germanic in effect. Tchaikovsky's expert use of having two or more instruments play a melody simultaneously (a practice called doubling) and his ear for uncanny combinations of instruments resulted in \"a generalized orchestral sonority in which the individual timbres of the instruments, being thoroughly mixed, would vanish\".\nPastiche (Pass\u00e9-ism).\nIn works like the \"Serenade for Strings\" and the \"Variations on a Rococo Theme\", Tchaikovsky showed he was highly gifted at writing in a style of 18th-century European pastiche. Tchaikovsky graduated from imitation to full-scale evocation in the ballet \"The Sleeping Beauty\" and the opera \"The Queen of Spades\". This practice, which Alexandre Benois calls \"pass\u00e9-ism\", lends an air of timelessness and immediacy, making the past seem as though it were the present. On a practical level, Tchaikovsky was drawn to past styles because he felt he might find the solution to certain structural problems within them. His Rococo pastiches also may have offered escape into a musical world purer than his own, into which he felt himself irresistibly drawn. (In this sense, Tchaikovsky operated in the opposite manner to Igor Stravinsky, who turned to Neoclassicism partly as a form of compositional self-discovery.) Tchaikovsky's attraction to ballet might have allowed a similar refuge into a fairy-tale world, where he could freely write dance music within a tradition of French elegance.\nAesthetic impact.\nMaes maintains that, regardless of what he was writing, Tchaikovsky's main concern was how his music affected his listeners on an aesthetic level, at specific moments in the piece, and on a cumulative level once the music had finished. What his listeners experienced on an emotional or visceral level became an end in itself. Tchaikovsky's focus on pleasing his audience might be considered closer to that of Mendelssohn or Mozart. \nAnd yet, even when writing so-called 'programme' music, for example, his Romeo and Juliet fantasy overture, he cast it in sonata form. His use of stylized 18th-century melodies and patriotic themes was geared toward the values of Russian aristocracy. He was aided in this by Ivan Vsevolozhsky, who commissioned \"The Sleeping Beauty\" from Tchaikovsky and the libretto for \"The Queen of Spades\" from Modest with their use of 18th-century settings stipulated firmly. Tchaikovsky also used the polonaise frequently, the dance being a musical code for the Romanov dynasty and a symbol of Russian patriotism. Using it in the finale of a work could assure its success with Russian listeners.\nReception.\nDedicatees and collaborators.\nTchaikovsky's relationship with collaborators was mixed. Like Nikolai Rubinstein with the First Piano Concerto, the virtuoso and pedagogue Leopold Auer rejected the Violin Concerto initially but changed his mind; he played it to great public success and taught it to his students, who included Jascha Heifetz and Nathan Milstein. Wilhelm Fitzenhagen \"intervened considerably in shaping what he considered 'his' piece\", the \"Variations on a Rococo Theme\", according to the music critic Michael Steinberg. Tchaikovsky was angered by Fitzenhagen's license but did nothing; the Rococo Variations were published with the cellist's amendments.\nHis collaboration on the three ballets went better and in Marius Petipa, who worked with him on the last two, he might have found an advocate. When \"The Sleeping Beauty\" was seen by its dancers as needlessly complicated, Petipa convinced them to put in the extra effort. Tchaikovsky compromised to make his music as practical as possible for the dancers and was accorded more creative freedom than ballet composers were usually accorded at the time. He responded with scores that minimized the rhythmic subtleties normally present in his work but were inventive and rich in melody, with more refined and imaginative orchestration than in the average ballet score.\nCritics.\nCritical reception to Tchaikovsky's music was varied but also improved over time. Even after 1880, some inside Russia held it suspect for not being nationalistic enough and thought Western European critics lauded it for exactly that reason. There might have been a grain of truth in the latter, according to the musicologist and conductor Leon Botstein, as German critics especially wrote of the \"indeterminacy of [Tchaikovsky's] artistic character ... being truly at home in the non-Russian\". \nOf the foreign critics who did not care for his music, Eduard Hanslick lambasted the Violin Concerto as a musical composition \"whose stink one can hear\" and William Forster Abtrop wrote of the Fifth Symphony, \"The furious peroration sounds like nothing so much as a horde of demons struggling in a torrent of brandy, the music growing drunker and drunker. Pandemonium, delirium tremens, raving, and above all, noise worse confounded!\"\nThe division between Russian and Western critics remained through much of the 20th century but for a different reason. According to Brown and Wiley, the prevailing view of Western critics was that the same qualities in Tchaikovsky's music that appealed to audiences\u2014its strong emotions, directness and eloquence and colorful orchestration\u2014added up to compositional shallowness. The music's use in popular and film music, Brown says, lowered its esteem in their eyes still further. There was also the fact, pointed out earlier, that Tchaikovsky's music demanded active engagement from the listener and, as Botstein phrases it, \"spoke to the listener's imaginative interior life, regardless of nationality\". Conservative critics, he adds, may have felt threatened by the \"violence and 'hysteria'\" they detected and felt such emotive displays \"attacked the boundaries of conventional aesthetic appreciation\u2014the cultured reception of art as an act of formalist discernment\u2014and the polite engagement of art as an act of amusement\".\nThere has also been the fact that the composer did not follow sonata form strictly, relying instead on juxtaposing blocks of tonalities and thematic groups. Maes states this point has been seen at times as a weakness rather than a sign of originality. Even with what Schonberg termed \"a professional reevaluation\" of Tchaikovsky's work, the practice of faulting Tchaikovsky for not following in the steps of the Viennese masters has not gone away entirely, while his intention of writing music that would please his audiences is also sometimes taken to task. In an article in 1992, critic Allan Kozinn from the \"New York Times\" writes, \"It is Tchaikovsky's flexibility, after all, that has given us a sense of his variability... Tchaikovsky was capable of turning out music\u2014entertaining and widely beloved though it is\u2014that seems superficial, manipulative and trivial when regarded in the context of the whole literature. The First Piano Concerto is a case in point. It makes a joyful noise, it swims in pretty tunes and its dramatic rhetoric allows (or even requires) a soloist to make a grand, swashbuckling impression. But it is entirely hollow\".\nIn the 21st century, however, critics are reacting more positively to Tchaikovsky's tunefulness, originality, and craftsmanship. \"Tchaikovsky is being viewed again as a composer of the first rank, writing music of depth, innovation and influence,\" according to the cultural historian and author Joseph Horowitz. Important in this reevaluation is a shift in attitude away from the disdain for overt emotionalism that marked half of the 20th century. \"We have acquired a different view of Romantic 'excess,'\" Horowitz says. \"Tchaikovsky is today more admired than deplored for his emotional frankness; if his music seems harried and insecure, so are we all\".\nPublic.\nHorowitz maintains that, while the standing of Tchaikovsky's music has fluctuated among critics, for the public, \"it never went out of style, and his most popular works have yielded iconic sound-bytes [\"sic\"], such as the love theme from \"Romeo and Juliet\"\". Along with those tunes, Botstein adds, \"Tchaikovsky appealed to audiences outside of Russia with an immediacy and directness that were startling even for music, an art form often associated with emotion\". Tchaikovsky's melodies, stated with eloquence and matched by his inventive use of harmony and orchestration, have always ensured audience appeal. His popularity is considered secure, with his following in many countries, including the United States and the United Kingdom, second only to that of Beethoven. His music has also been used frequently in popular music and film.\nLegacy.\nAccording to Wiley, Tchaikovsky was a pioneer in several ways. \"Thanks in large part to Nadezhda von Meck\", Wiley writes, \"he became the first full-time professional Russian composer\". This, Wiley adds, allowed him the time and freedom to consolidate the Western compositional practices he had learned at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory with Russian folk song and other native musical elements to fulfill his own expressive goals and forge an original, deeply personal style. He made an impact in not only complete works such as the symphony but also program music and, as Wiley phrases it, \"transformed Liszt's and Berlioz's achievements ... into matters of Shakespearean elevation and psychological import\". Wiley and Holden both note that Tchaikovsky did all this without a native school of composition upon which to fall back. They point out that only Glinka had preceded him in combining Russian and Western practices and his teachers in Saint Petersburg had been thoroughly Germanic in their musical outlook. He was, they write, for all intents and purposes alone in his artistic quest.\nMaes and Taruskin write that Tchaikovsky believed that his professionalism in combining skill and high standards in his musical works separated him from his contemporaries in The Five. Maes adds that, like them, he wanted to produce music that reflected Russian national character but which did so to the highest European standards of quality. Tchaikovsky, according to Maes, came along at a time when the nation itself was deeply divided as to what that character truly was. Like his country, Maes writes, it took him time to discover how to express his Russianness in a way that was true to himself and what he had learned. Because of his professionalism, Maes says, he worked hard at this goal and succeeded. The composer's friend the music critic Herman Laroche wrote of \"The Sleeping Beauty\" that the score contained \"an element deeper and more general than color, in the internal structure of the music, above all in the foundation of the element of melody. This basic element is undoubtedly Russian\".\nTchaikovsky was inspired to reach beyond Russia with his music, according to Maes and Taruskin. His exposure to Western music, they write, encouraged him to think it belonged to not just Russia but also the world at large. Solomon Volkov adds that this mindset made him think seriously about Russia's place in European musical culture\u2014the first Russian composer to do so. It steeled him to become the first Russian composer to acquaint foreign audiences personally with his own works, Warrack writes, as well as those of other Russian composers. In his biography of Tchaikovsky, Anthony Holden recalls the dearth of Russian classical music before Tchaikovsky's birth, then places the composer's achievements into historical perspective: \"Twenty years after Tchaikovsky's death, in 1913, Igor Stravinsky's \"The Rite of Spring\" erupted onto the musical scene, signaling Russia's arrival into 20th-century music. Between these two very different worlds, Tchaikovsky's music became the sole bridge\".\nVoice recording.\nA recording was made in Moscow in January 1890, by Julius Block on behalf of Thomas Edison. A transcript of the recording follows (identification of the speakers is speculative):\nAccording to the musicologist Leonid Sabaneyev, Tchaikovsky was uncomfortable with being recorded for posterity and tried to shy away from it. On an apparently separate visit from the one related above, Block asked him to play something on the piano or at least say something. He refused, telling Block: \"I am a bad pianist and my voice is raspy. Why should one eternalize it?\"\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;"}

They are involved in the formation of the blood-brain barrier and support neurotransmitter activity, including the synthesis of acetylcholine.\nResearch indicates that phospholipid levels in the brain decline with age, with studies showing up to a 20% reduction by age 80, potentially impacting memory, focus, and cognitive performance. Dietary supplementation with phospholipids derived from the milk fat globule membrane (MFGM) has been shown in clinical trials to support memory, mood, and stress resilience in both children and adults.\nMultiple randomized controlled trials have demonstrated that daily intake of 300\u2013600 mg of MFGM phospholipids can significantly reduce perceived stress and improve cognitive performance under pressure.\nPhospholipids are a key component of all cell membranes. They can form lipid bilayers because of their amphiphilic characteristic. In eukaryotes, cell membranes also contain another class of lipid, sterol, interspersed among the phospholipids. The combination provides fluidity in two dimensions combined with mechanical strength against rupture. Purified phospholipids are produced commercially and have found applications in nanotechnology and materials science.\nThe first phospholipid identified in 1847 as such in biological tissues was lecithin, or phosphatidylcholine, in the egg yolk of chickens by the French chemist and pharmacist Theodore Nicolas Gobley.\nPhospholipids in biological membranes.\nArrangement.\nThe phospholipids are amphiphilic. The hydrophilic end usually contains a negatively charged phosphate group, and the hydrophobic end usually consists of two \"tails\" that are long fatty acid residues.\nIn aqueous solutions, phospholipids are driven by hydrophobic interactions, which result in the fatty acid tails aggregating to minimize interactions with the water molecules. The result is often a phospholipid bilayer: a membrane that consists of two layers of oppositely oriented phospholipid molecules, with their heads exposed to the liquid on both sides, and with the tails directed into the membrane. That is the dominant structural motif of the membranes of all cells and of some other biological structures, such as vesicles or virus coatings.\nIn biological membranes, the phospholipids often occur with other molecules (e.g., proteins, glycolipids, sterols) in a bilayer such as a cell membrane. Lipid bilayers occur when hydrophobic tails line up against one another, forming a membrane of hydrophilic heads on both sides facing the water.\nDynamics.\nThese specific properties allow phospholipids to play an important role in the cell membrane. Their movement can be described by the fluid mosaic model, which describes the membrane as a mosaic of lipid molecules that act as a solvent for all the substances and proteins within it, so proteins and lipid molecules are then free to diffuse laterally through the lipid matrix and migrate over the membrane. Sterols contribute to membrane fluidity by hindering the packing together of phospholipids. However, this model has now been superseded, as through the study of lipid polymorphism it is now known that the behaviour of lipids under physiological (and other) conditions is not simple.\n \"See: Glycerophospholipid\"\n \"See Sphingolipid\"\nApplications.\nPhospholipids have been widely used to prepare liposomal, ethosomal and other nanoformulations of topical, oral and parenteral drugs for differing reasons like improved bio-availability, reduced toxicity and increased permeability across membranes. Liposomes are often composed of phosphatidylcholine-enriched phospholipids and may also contain mixed phospholipid chains with surfactant properties. The ethosomal formulation of ketoconazole using phospholipids is a promising option for transdermal delivery in fungal infections. Advances in phospholipid research lead to exploring these biomolecules and their conformations using lipidomics.\nSimulations.\nComputational simulations of phospholipids are often performed using molecular dynamics with force fields such as GROMOS, CHARMM, or AMBER.\nCharacterization.\nPhospholipids are optically highly birefringent, i.e. their refractive index is different along their axis as opposed to perpendicular to it. Measurement of birefringence can be achieved using cross polarisers in a microscope to obtain an image of e.g. vesicle walls or using techniques such as dual polarisation interferometry to quantify lipid order or disruption in supported bilayers.\nAnalysis.\nThere are no simple methods available for analysis of phospholipids, since the close range of polarity between different phospholipid species makes detection difficult. Oil chemists often use spectroscopy to determine total phosphorus abundance and then calculate approximate mass of phospholipids based on molecular weight of expected fatty acid species. Modern lipid profiling employs more absolute methods of analysis, with NMR spectroscopy, particularly 31P-NMR, while HPLC-ELSD provides relative values.\nPhospholipid synthesis.\nPhospholipid synthesis occurs in the cytosolic side of ER membrane that is studded with proteins that act in synthesis (GPAT and LPAAT acyl transferases, phosphatase and choline phosphotransferase) and allocation (flippase and floppase). Eventually a vesicle will bud off from the ER containing phospholipids destined for the cytoplasmic cellular membrane on its exterior leaflet and phospholipids destined for the exoplasmic cellular membrane on its inner leaflet.\nSources.\nCommon sources of industrially produced phospholipids are soya, rapeseed, sunflower, chicken eggs, bovine milk, fish eggs etc. Phospholipids for gene delivery, such as distearoylphosphatidylcholine and dioleoyl-3-trimethylammonium propane, are produced synthetically. Each source has a unique profile of individual phospholipid species, as well as fatty acids, and consequently differing applications in food, nutrition, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, and drug delivery.\nIn signal transduction.\nSome types of phospholipid can be split to produce products that function as second messengers in signal transduction. Examples include phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate (PIP2), that can be split by the enzyme phospholipase\u00a0C into inositol triphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG), which both carry out the functions of the Gq type of G protein in response to various stimuli and intervene in various processes from long term depression in neurons to leukocyte signal pathways started by chemokine receptors.\nPhospholipids also intervene in prostaglandin signal pathways as the raw material used by lipase enzymes to produce the prostaglandin precursors. In plants they serve as the raw material to produce jasmonic acid, a plant hormone similar in structure to prostaglandins that mediates defensive responses against pathogens.\nFood technology.\nPhospholipids can act as emulsifiers, enabling oils to form a colloid with water. Phospholipids are one of the components of lecithin, which is found in egg yolks, as well as being extracted from soybeans, and is used as a food additive in many products and can be purchased as a dietary supplement. Lysolecithins are typically used for water\u2013oil emulsions like margarine, due to their higher HLB ratio.\n \"See table below for an extensive list.\"\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Between his non-consecutive terms as prime minister, he served as the leader of the Official Opposition from 1979 to 1980.\nTrudeau was born and raised in Outremont, Quebec, and studied politics and law. In the 1950s, he rose to prominence as a labour activist in Quebec politics by opposing the conservative Union Nationale government. Trudeau was then an associate professor of law at the Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al. He was originally part of the social democratic New Democratic Party (NDP), but then joined the Liberal Party in 1965, believing that the NDP could not achieve power. That year, he was elected to the House of Commons, and was quickly appointed as prime minister Lester B. Pearson's parliamentary secretary. In 1967, Trudeau was appointed as minister of justice and attorney general, during which time he liberalized divorce and abortion laws and decriminalized homosexuality. Trudeau's outgoing personality and charisma caused a sensation, termed \"Trudeaumania\", which helped him win the leadership of the Liberal Party in 1968. He then succeeded Pearson and became prime minister of Canada.\nFrom the late 1960s until the mid-1980s, Trudeau dominated the Canadian political scene. After his appointment as prime minister, he won the 1968, 1972, and 1974 federal elections, before narrowly losing in 1979. He won a fourth election victory shortly afterwards, in 1980. Trudeau is the most recent prime minister to win four elections (having won three majority governments and one minority government) and to serve non-consecutive terms. His tenure of 15 years and 164 days makes him the third longest-serving prime minister in Canadian history, behind John A. Macdonald and William Lyon Mackenzie King.\nAs prime minister, Trudeau pioneered official bilingualism and multiculturalism. During the Quebec sovereignty movement, he invoked the \"War Measures Act\" in response to the 1970 October Crisis and successfully led the federalist campaign against the 1980 Quebec sovereignty-association referendum. In economic policy, he introduced the capital gains tax, expanded welfare programs, and oversaw major increases in deficit spending. He also enacted the \"Anti-Inflation Act\" in response to the 1970s recession. In a bid to move the Liberal Party towards economic nationalism, Trudeau established Petro-Canada and launched the National Energy Program, both of which generated significant controversy in oil-rich Western Canada and led to a rise in what was called \"Western alienation\". His government also converted Canada to the metric system, established Via Rail, and enacted the \"Access to Information Act\" and the \"Canada Health Act\". Trudeau pursued an independent path in foreign policy. He reduced alignment with the United States, maintained cordial relations with the Soviet Union, and developed strong ties with China and Cuban leader Fidel Castro, which put him at odds with other Western capitalist states. He also oversaw Canada's entry into the G7 forum. In 1982, Trudeau patriated the Constitution of Canada and established the \"Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms\", which, with the passing of the \"Constitution Act, 1982\", achieved full Canadian sovereignty.\nTrudeau retired from politics shortly before the 1984 federal election. In his retirement, Trudeau practised law at the Montreal law firm of Heenan Blaikie. He also spoke out against the Meech Lake and Charlottetown accords (which proposed granting Quebec certain concessions), arguing they would strengthen Quebec nationalism. Trudeau died in 2000. He is ranked highly among scholars in historical rankings of Canadian prime ministers, though he remains a divisive figure in Canadian politics. Critics accused him of arrogance, economic mismanagement, and unduly centralizing Canadian decision-making to the detriment of the culture of Quebec and the economy of the Prairies, while admirers praised what they considered to be the force of his intellect and his political acumen which maintained national unity throughout the Quebec sovereignty movement. Trudeau's eldest son, Justin Trudeau, served as the 23rd prime minister of Canada from 2015 to 2025, becoming the first prime minister of Canada to be the child of a previous prime minister.\nEarly life.\nThe Trudeau family can be traced to Marcillac-Lanville in France in the 16th century and to a Robert Truteau (1544\u20131589). In 1659, the first Trudeau to arrive in Canada was \u00c9tienne Trudeau or Truteau (1641\u20131712), a carpenter and home builder from La Rochelle.\nPierre Trudeau was born at home in Outremont, Quebec, on October 18, 1919, to Charles-\u00c9mile \"Charley\" Trudeau (1887\u20131935), a French-Canadian businessman and lawyer, and Grace Elliott, who was of mixed Scottish and French-Canadian descent. He had an older sister named Suzette and a younger brother named Charles Jr. Trudeau remained close to both siblings for his entire life. Trudeau's paternal grandparents were French-speaking Quebec farmers. His father had acquired the B&amp;A gas station chain (now defunct), some \"profitable mines, the Belmont amusement park in Montreal and the Montreal Royals, the city's minor-league baseball team\", by the time Trudeau was fifteen. When his father died in Orlando, Florida, on April 10, 1935, Trudeau and each of his siblings inherited $5,000 (), a considerable sum at that time, which meant that he was financially secure and independent. His mother, Grace, \"doted on Pierre\" and he remained close to her throughout her long life. After her husband died, she left the management of her inheritance to others and spent a lot of her time working for the Roman Catholic Church and various charities, travelling frequently to New York City, Florida, Europe, and Maine, sometimes with her children. Already in his late teens, Trudeau was \"directly involved in managing a large inheritance\".\nEarly education.\nFrom the age of six until twelve, Trudeau attended the primary school Acad\u00e9mie Querbes, in Outremont, where he became immersed in the Catholic religion. The school, which was for both English and French Catholics, was an exclusive school with very small classes and he excelled in mathematics and religion. From his earliest years, Trudeau was fluently bilingual, which would later prove to be a \"big asset for a politician in bilingual Canada.\" As a teenager, he attended the Jesuit French-language Coll\u00e8ge Jean-de-Br\u00e9beuf, a prestigious secondary school known for educating elite francophone families in Quebec.\nIn his seventh and final academic year, 1939\u20131940, Trudeau focused on winning a Rhodes Scholarship. In his application, he wrote that he had prepared for public office by studying public speaking and publishing many articles in \"Br\u00e9beuf\". His letters of recommendations praised him highly. Father Boulin, who was the head of the college, said that during Trudeau's seven years at the college (1933\u20131940), he had won a \"hundred prizes and honourable mentions\" and \"performed with distinction in all fields\". Trudeau graduated from Coll\u00e8ge Jean-de-Br\u00e9beuf in 1940 at the age of twenty-one.\nTrudeau did not win the Rhodes Scholarship. He consulted several people on his options, including Henri Bourassa, the economist Edmond Montpetit, and Father Robert Bernier, a Franco-Manitoban. Following their advice, he chose a career in politics and a degree in law at the Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al.\nSecond World War.\nIn his obituary, \"The Economist\" described Trudeau as \"parochial as a young man\", who \"dismissed\" the Second World War \"as a squabble between the big powers, although he later regretted 'missing one of the major events of the century'.\" In his 1993 \"Memoir,\" Trudeau wrote that the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939 and his father's death were the two \"great bombshells\" that marked his teenage years. In his first year at university, the prime topics of conversation were the Battle of France, the Battle of Britain, and the London blitz. He wrote that in the early 1940s, when he was in his early twenties, he thought, \"So there was a war? Tough. It wouldn't stop me from concentrating on my studies so long as that was possible...[I]f you were a French Canadian in Montreal [at that time], you did not automatically believe that this was a just war. In Montreal in the early 1940s, we still knew nothing about the Holocaust and we tended to think of this war as a settling of scores among the superpowers.\"\nYoung Trudeau opposed conscription for overseas service, and in 1942 he campaigned for the anti-conscription candidate Jean Drapeau (later the mayor of Montreal) in Outremont. Trudeau described a speech he heard in Montreal by Ernest Lapointe, minister of justice and Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King's Quebec lieutenant. Lapointe had been a Liberal MP during the 1917 Conscription Crisis, in which the Canadian government had deployed up to 1,200 soldiers to suppress the anti-conscription Easter Riots in Quebec City in March and April 1918. In a final and bloody conflict, armed rioters fired on the troops, and the soldiers returned fire. At least five men were killed by gunfire and there were over 150 casualties and $300,000 in damage. In 1939, it was Lapointe who helped draft the Liberals' policy against conscription for service overseas. Lapointe was aware that a new conscription crisis would destroy the national unity that Mackenzie King had been trying to build since the end of the First World War. Trudeau believed Lapointe had lied and broken his promise. His criticisms of King's wartime policies, such as \"suspension of habeas corpus\", the \"farce of bilingualism and French-Canadian advancement in the army,\" and the \"forced 'voluntary' enrolment\", were scathing.\nAs a university student, Trudeau joined the Canadian Officers' Training Corps (COTC), which trained at the local armoury in Montreal during the school term and undertook further training at Camp Farnham each summer. Although the \"National Resources Mobilization Act\", enacted in 1940, originally provided that conscripts could not be required to serve outside of Canada, Parliament amended the act and removed that restriction in 1942. The Conscription Crisis of 1944 arose in response to the Allied invasion of Normandy in June 1944.\nEducation.\nTrudeau continued his full-time studies in law at the Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al while in the COTC from 1940 until his graduation in 1943. Following his graduation, he articled for a year and, in late 1944, began his master's degree in political economy at Harvard University's Graduate School of Public Administration (now the John F. Kennedy School of Government). In his \"Memoir\", he admitted that it was at Harvard's \"super-informed environment\" that he realized the \"historic importance\" of the war and that he had \"missed one of the major events of the century in which [he] was living. Harvard had become a major intellectual centre, as fascism in Europe led to a great migration of intellectuals to the United States.\nTrudeau's Harvard dissertation was on the topic of communism and Christianity. At Harvard, an American and predominantly Protestant university, Trudeau, a French Canadian Catholic living outside the province of Quebec for the first time, felt like an outsider. As his sense of isolation deepened, he decided in 1947 to continue his work on his Harvard dissertation in Paris, where he studied at the Institut d'\u00c9tudes Politiques de Paris (Sciences Po). The Harvard dissertation remained unfinished when Trudeau briefly entered a doctoral program to study under the socialist economist Harold Laski at the London School of Economics (LSE). This cemented Trudeau's belief that Keynesian economics and social sciences were essential to the creation of the \"good life\" in a democratic society. Over a five-week period he attended many lectures and became a follower of personalism after being influenced most notably by Emmanuel Mounier. He also was influenced by Nikolai Berdyaev, particularly his book \"Slavery and Freedom\". Max and Monique Nemni argue that Berdyaev's book influenced Trudeau's rejection of nationalism and separatism.\nIn mid 1948, Trudeau embarked on world travels to find a sense of purpose. At the age of twenty-eight, he travelled to Poland where he visited Auschwitz, then Czechoslovakia, Austria, Hungary, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, and the Middle East, including Turkey, Jordan and southern Iraq. Although he was wealthy, Trudeau travelled with a backpack in \"self-imposed hardship\". He used his British passport instead of his Canadian passport in his travels through Pakistan, India, China, and Japan, often wearing local clothing to blend in. According to \"The Economist\", when Trudeau returned to Canada in 1949 after an absence of five months, his mind was \"seemingly broadened\" from his studies at Harvard, Sciences Po, and the LSE, as well as his travels. He was \"appalled at the narrow nationalism in his native French-speaking Quebec, and the authoritarianism of the province's government\".\nQuiet Revolution.\nBeginning while Trudeau was travelling overseas, several events took place in Quebec that were precursors to the Quiet Revolution. These included the 1948 release of the anti-establishment manifesto Refus global, the publication of \"Les insolences du Fr\u00e8re Untel\", the 1949 Asbestos Strike, and the 1955 Richard Riot. Artists and intellectuals in Quebec signed the \"Refus global\" on August 9, 1948, in opposition to the repressive rule of Quebec Premier Maurice Duplessis and the decadent \"social establishment\" in Quebec, including the Catholic Church. When he returned to Montreal in 1949, Trudeau quickly became a leading figure opposing Duplessis's rule. He actively supported the workers in the Asbestos strike which opposed Duplessis in 1949. Trudeau was the co-founder and editor of \"Cit\u00e9 Libre\", a dissident journal that helped provide the intellectual basis for the Quiet Revolution. In 1956, he edited an important book on the subject, \"La gr\u00e8ve de l'amiante\", which argued that the asbestos miners' strike of 1949 was a seminal event in Quebec's history, marking the beginning of resistance to the conservative, Francophone clerical establishment and Anglophone business class that had long ruled the province.\nCareer.\nBecause of Trudeau's labour union activities in Asbestos, Duplessis blacklisted him, and he was unable to teach law at the Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al. He surprised his closest friends in Quebec when he became a civil servant in Ottawa in 1949. Until 1951, he worked in the Privy Council Office of the Liberal Prime Minister Louis St. Laurent as an economic policy advisor. He wrote in his memoirs that he found this period very useful when he entered politics later on, and that senior civil servant Norman Robertson tried unsuccessfully to persuade him to stay on.\nTrudeau's progressive values and his close ties with Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) intellectuals (including F. R. Scott, Eugene Forsey, Michael Kelway Oliver and Charles Taylor) led to his support of and membership in the party throughout the 1950s.\nAn associate professor of law at the Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al from 1961 to 1965, Trudeau's views evolved towards a liberal position in favour of individual rights counter to the state and made him an opponent of Quebec nationalism. He admired labour unions, which were tied to the Cooperative Commonwealth Federation (CCF), and tried to infuse his Liberal Party with some of their reformist zeal. By the late 1950s, Trudeau began to reject social democratic and labour parties, arguing that they should put their narrow goals aside and join forces with Liberals to fight for democracy first. In economic theory, he was influenced by professors Joseph Schumpeter and John Kenneth Galbraith while he was at Harvard. In 1963, Trudeau criticized the Liberal Party of Lester B. Pearson when it supported arming Bomarc missiles in Canada with nuclear warheads.\nDuring his time as a professor at the Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al, he was featured in Denis H\u00e9roux's 1964 student film \"Over My Head (Jusqu'au cou)\", appearing as himself in a political debate.\nTrudeau was offered a position at Queen's University teaching political science by James Corry, who later became Principal of Queen's, but turned it down because he preferred to teach in Quebec.\nEarly political career (1965\u20131967).\nIn 1965, Trudeau joined the Liberal Party, along with his friends G\u00e9rard Pelletier and Jean Marchand. Dubbed the \"three wise men\" by the media, they ran successfully for the Liberals in the 1965 election. Trudeau himself was elected in the safe Liberal riding of Mount Royal in Montreal. He would hold this seat until his retirement from politics in 1984, winning each election with large majorities. His decision to join the Liberals rather than the CCF's successor, the New Democratic Party (NDP), was partly based on his belief that the federal NDP could not achieve power. He also doubted the feasibility of the NDP's centralizing policies and felt that the party leadership tended toward a \"deux nations\" approach he could not support.\nUpon arrival in Ottawa, Trudeau was appointed as parliamentary secretary to Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson and spent much of the next year travelling abroad, representing Canada at international meetings and bodies, including the United Nations. In 1967, he was appointed to Pearson's Cabinet as Minister of Justice and Attorney General.\nMinister of Justice and Attorney General (1967\u20131968).\nAs Justice Minister and Attorney General, Trudeau was responsible for introducing the landmark \"Criminal Law Amendment Act\", an omnibus bill whose provisions included, among other things, the decriminalization of homosexual acts between consenting adults, new gun ownership restrictions and the legalization of contraception, abortion and lotteries, as well as the authorization of breathalyzer tests on suspected drunk drivers. Trudeau famously defended the segment of the bill decriminalizing homosexual acts by telling reporters that \"there's no place for the state in the bedrooms of the nation\", adding that \"what's done in private between adults doesn't concern the Criminal Code\". Trudeau paraphrased the term from Martin O'Malley's editorial piece in \"The Globe and Mail\" on December 12, 1967. Trudeau also liberalized divorce laws, and clashed with Quebec Premier Daniel Johnson, Sr. during constitutional negotiations.\nLiberal leadership convention (1968).\nAt the end of Canada's centennial year in 1967, Pearson announced his intention to step down, and Trudeau entered the race to succeed him as party leader and Prime Minister. His energetic campaign attracted widespread media attention and mobilized many young people, who saw Trudeau as a symbol of generational change. However, many Liberals still had reservations, given that he had only joined the party in 1965. During the convention, prominent Cabinet Minister Judy LaMarsh was caught on television profanely stating that Trudeau was not a Liberal.\nNevertheless, at the April 1968 Liberal leadership convention, Trudeau was elected leader on the fourth ballot, with the support of 51 percent of the delegates. He defeated several prominent and long-serving Liberals, including Paul Martin Sr., Robert Winters and Paul Hellyer.\nFirst premiership (1968\u20131979).\nSwearing-in and subsequent election.\nAs the new leader of the governing Liberals, Trudeau was sworn in as prime minister on April 20. Although the term of the Parliament was not due to expire until November 1970, Pearson's government had almost fallen before the leadership contest could even take place after a tax bill was voted down in Parliament, leading to much confusion over whether this counted as a matter of confidence in the government. Governor General Roland Michener ultimately ruled that it did not, and the government subsequently won an actual confidence motion, but the incident made it clear that the minority government Trudeau had inherited would not realistically last the full parliamentary term, and that he would soon need to call an early election in order to win a parliamentary majority. Trudeau eventually called this election for June 25, 1968.\nTrudeau's campaign benefited from an unprecedented wave of personal popularity called \"Trudeaumania\", which saw him mobbed by throngs of youths. His main national opponents were PC leader Robert Stanfield and NDP leader Tommy Douglas, both popular figures who had been premiers of Nova Scotia and Saskatchewan respectively (albeit in Trudeau's native Quebec, the main competition to the Liberals was from the Ralliement cr\u00e9ditiste, led by R\u00e9al Caouette). As a candidate, Trudeau espoused participatory democracy as a means of making Canada a \"Just Society\". He vigorously defended the newly implemented universal health care and regional development programs, as well as the recent reforms found in the Omnibus bill.\nOn the eve of the election, during the annual Saint-Jean-Baptiste Day parade in Montreal, rioting Quebec sovereigntists threw rocks and bottles at the grandstand where Trudeau was seated, chanting \"Trudeau au poteau!\" (\"Trudeau to the stake!\"). Rejecting the pleas of aides that he take cover, Trudeau stayed in his seat, facing the rioters, without any sign of fear. The image of the defiant Prime Minister impressed the public. The next day, Trudeau handily won the 1968 election with a strong majority government; this was the Liberals' first majority since 1953.\nSocial policy.\nBilingualism and multiculturalism.\nTrudeau's first major legislative push was implementing the majority of recommendations from Pearson's Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism via the \"Official Languages Act\", which made French and English the co-equal official languages of the federal government. More controversial than the declaration (which was backed by the NDP and, with some opposition in caucus, the PCs) was the implementation of the Act's principles: between 1966 and 1976, the francophone proportion of the civil service and military doubled, causing alarm in some sections of anglophone Canada who felt they were being disadvantaged.\nTrudeau's Cabinet fulfilled Part IV of the Royal Commission's report by announcing a \"Multiculturalism Policy\" on October 8, 1971. It was the first of its kind in the world, subsequently being emulated by several provinces such as Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba; even other countries, most notably Australia, which has had a similar history and immigration pattern, emulated the policy. Beyond the specifics of the policy itself, this action signalled an openness to the world and coincided with a more open immigration policy that Pearson had brought in. The policy recognized that while Canada was a country of two official languages, it recognized a plurality of cultures \u2013 \"a multicultural policy within a bilingual framework\". This annoyed public opinion in Quebec, which believed that it challenged Quebec's claim of Canada being a country of two nations.\nImmigration.\nFollowing the Vietnam War, a refugee crisis was caused by the flight of the boat people from Vietnam, as thousands of people, mostly ethnic Chinese, fled the country in makeshift boats across the South China Sea, usually to the British colony of Hong Kong. The Trudeau government was generous in granting asylum to the refugees. By 1980, Canada had accepted about 44,000 boat people, making it one of the top destinations for them.\nIndigenous issues.\nIn 1969, Trudeau, along with his then-Minister of Indian Affairs Jean Chr\u00e9tien, proposed the 1969 White Paper (officially entitled \"Statement of the Government of Canada on Indian policy\"). The Paper proposed the general assimilation of First Nations into the Canadian body politic through the elimination of the \"Indian Act\" and Indian status, the parcelling of reserve land to private owners, and the elimination of the Department of Indian and Northern Affairs. The White Paper was widely seen as racist and an attack on Canada's indigenous peoples, and prompted the first major national mobilization of indigenous activists against the federal government's proposal, leading Trudeau to set aside the legislation.\nDeath penalty.\nOn July 14, 1976, after a long and emotional debate, Bill C-84 was passed by the House of Commons by a vote of 130 to 124, abolishing the death penalty for all criminal offences (other than military offences) and instituting a life sentence without parole for 25 years for first-degree murder.\nQuebec.\nOctober Crisis.\nTrudeau's first serious test as Prime Minister came during the October Crisis of 1970, when a Marxist-influenced Quebec separatist group, the Front de lib\u00e9ration du Qu\u00e9bec (FLQ), kidnapped British Trade Consul James Cross at his residence on October 5. Five days later, the group also kidnapped Quebec Labour Minister Pierre Laporte. Trudeau, with the acquiescence of Quebec Premier Robert Bourassa, responded by invoking the \"War Measures Act\", which gave the government sweeping powers of arrest and detention without trial. Trudeau presented a determined public stance during the crisis; when questioned by CBC Television journalist Tim Ralfe regarding how far he would go to stop the violence, Trudeau answered, \"Just watch me\". Laporte was found dead on October 17 in the trunk of a car. Five of the FLQ members were flown to Cuba in 1970 as part of a deal in exchange for James Cross' life, although they eventually returned to Canada years later, where they served time in prison.\nAlthough Trudeau's response is still controversial and was opposed at the time as excessive by parliamentarians like Tommy Douglas and David Lewis, it was met with only limited objections from the public.\nQuebec provincial affairs.\nAfter consultations with the provincial premiers, Trudeau agreed to attend a conference called by British Columbia Premier W. A. C. Bennett to attempt to finally patriate the Canadian constitution. Negotiations between the provinces and Justice Minister John Turner created a draft agreement, known as the Victoria Charter, that entrenched a charter of rights, bilingualism, and a guarantee of a veto of constitutional amendments for Ontario and Quebec, as well as regional vetoes for Western Canada and Atlantic Canada, within the new constitution. The agreement was acceptable to the nine predominantly-English speaking provinces, but Quebec's premier Robert Bourassa requested two weeks to consult with his cabinet. After a strong backlash of popular opinion against the agreement in Quebec, Bourassa stated that Quebec would not accept it.\nTrudeau faced increasing challenges in Quebec, starting with bitter relations with Bourassa and his Quebec Liberal government. Following a rise in the polls after the rejection of the Victoria Charter, the Quebec Liberals had taken a more confrontational approach with the federal government on the constitution, French language laws, and the language of air traffic control in Quebec. Trudeau responded with increasing anger at what he saw as nationalist provocations against Ottawa's bilingualism and constitutional initiatives, at times expressing his personal contempt for Bourassa.\nPartially in an attempt to shore up his support, Bourassa called a surprise election in 1976 that resulted in Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque and the sovereigntist Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois (PQ) winning a majority government. The PQ had chiefly campaigned on a \"good government\" platform, but promised a referendum on independence to be held within their first mandate. Trudeau and L\u00e9vesque had been personal rivals, with Trudeau's intellectualism contrasting with L\u00e9vesque's more working-class image. While Trudeau claimed to welcome the \"clarity\" provided by the PQ victory, the unexpected rise of the Quebec sovereignty movement became, in his view, his biggest challenge.\nAs the PQ began to take power, Trudeau faced the prolonged breakdown of his marriage, which the English-language press covered in lurid detail on a day-by-day basis. Trudeau's reserve was seen as dignified by contemporaries, and his poll numbers actually rose during the height of coverage, but aides felt the personal tensions left him uncharacteristically emotional and prone to outbursts.\nEconomic policy.\nTrudeau's first government implemented many procedural reforms to make Parliament and the Liberal caucus meetings run more efficiently, significantly expanded the size and role of the Prime Minister's office, and substantially expanded social-welfare programs.\nDeficit spending.\nTrudeau's government ran large budget deficits throughout its time in office. The government's first budget in 1968 produced a deficit of $667 million, while the 1969 budget produced a surplus of $140 million. However, the 1970 budget (which produced a deficit of over $1 billion) marked the start of consecutive budget deficits run by the Trudeau government; the budget would not be balanced until 1997. By the time Trudeau's first tenure ended in 1979, the deficit grew to $12 billion.\nSocial programs and spending.\nIn 1971, Trudeau's government greatly expanded unemployment insurance, making coverage nearly universal as coverage for the Canadian labour force jumped to 96 percent from 75 percent. The system was sometimes called the 8/42, because one had to work for eight weeks (with at least 20 hours per week), and wait two weeks, to get benefits for the other 42 weeks of the year. This expansion also opened the UI program up to maternity, sickness, and retirement benefits, covered seasonal workers for the first time, and allowed mothers to receive up to 15 weeks of benefits if they had 20 or more insurable weeks. The reforms increased the maximum benefit period to 50 weeks, though the benefit duration was calculated using a complex formula depending on labour force participation and the regional and national unemployment rates. In 1977, the government simplified the benefit duration formula but introduced a variable entrance requirement dependent on the unemployment rate in the applicant's region; the changes also mandated that workers in areas with low unemployment regions work twice as long to be eligible for benefits as workers in high unemployment regions.\nIn 1973, Trudeau's government amended the \"National Housing Act\" to provide financial assistance for new home buying, loans for co-operative housing, and low interest loans for municipal and private non-profit housing. The amendments saw the introduction the Rental Rehabilitation Assistance Program, which established that homeowners and occupants in low-income neighbourhoods could qualify for small grants to be used for home repair. Also introduced was the Assisted Home Ownership Program which allowed the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) to start providing grants and subsidized interest rates to low income families (though in 1978 an amendment discontinued the provision of grant money to these families, which led to a high incidence of defaults, and in turn, necessitated that the federal government provide financial assistance to the CMHC). The amendments saw the passage of the \"Rent Supplement Act\", which enabled the CMHC to partner with private landlords, cooperatives, and not-for-profit associations to provide affordable housing; in addition, the act saw the CMHC agree to fund the difference between market rental prices and rent prices geared to the specific occupant's income. Lastly, the Canada Rental Supply Program was introduced to provide interest-free loans for 15 years to developers who agreed to allocate a proportion of units toward social housing initiatives. In order to ensure that loans contributed to the provision of low income housing, the CMHC was restricted to giving loans amounting to $7,500 or less per unit.\nLegislation passed in November 1968 widened eligibility for farm credit, and in 1970 legislation was introduced aimed at improving compensation for merchant seamen and also to establish a right to maternity leave. In 1972, an Act was passed providing for the indexation of various pensions and allowances to the consumer price index. Certain eligibility requirements for receiving training allowances were also removed. One-pensioner couples benefited from a new Spouse's Allowance, while various improvements in superannuation arrangements and in family allowances were also carried out. \nThe registered home ownership savings plan (RHOSP) was introduced in the government's November 1974 budget. Similar to RRSPs, proceeds from the RHOSP could be received tax-free for either. a down payment for the acquisition of an owner-occupied dwelling or to buy furnitures for the dwelling (or the spouse's dwelling). Individuals who already owned a home (either owner-occupied or rented to another person) could not deduct RHOSP contributions. In 1976, Trudeau's government allowed for transfers of funds between the RHOSP (for instance to select a plan with better returns). In 1977, the government tightened the rules of the RHOSP (the reforms removed the purchase of furnitures from the list of usage allowed for tax-free use of RHOSP proceeds starting in 1978; disallowed deductible contributions for a taxpayer whose spouse owned a home; suspended tax-free rollover of RHSOP funds to an RRSP; and capped the lifetime of the RHOSP at 20 years).\nIn 1977, Trudeau's government established the financial program Established Programs Financing to help finance the provincially-run healthcare and post-secondary education system, through transfer payments, by cash and tax points. This system lasted until 1995.\nIn 1979, Trudeau's government restructured family allowances by increasing the role of the tax system in child support and decreasing the role of family allowances. The government established an annual Refundable Child Tax Credit of $200 for families with incomes of $18,000 or less. As incomes increased above this level, benefits would be taxed away to disappear completely at $26,000. Since the median income for families during this time was $19,500, the majority of families received some benefit from the new program.\nTaxation.\nIn 1969, Trudeau's first finance minister, Edgar Benson, introduced a white paper on tax reform which included tax deductions for child care and advocated shifting the tax burden from the poor to the wealthy. Measures to fulfill the latter proposal included a capital gains tax, which was severely criticized by corporate Canada and the business community (notably Israel Asper). The bill was debated in Parliament for over a year, with its more radical proposals being removed in parliamentary committee. The reforms managed to be passed through the use of closure, with the capital gains tax (that had an inclusion rate of 50 percent) coming into effect on January 1, 1972, as prescribed by the 1971 budget. Also implemented in 1972 was the child care expense deduction which allowed for a deduction of up to $500 per child. As Benson had now become a political liability, Trudeau replaced him with John Turner (who was seen as a \"Business Liberal\") in 1972.\nIn 1973, Trudeau's government fully indexed the person income tax system (both the exemptions and the brackets) to match inflation. The indexation was made effective in 1974; during that year, inflation had jumped from six percent to double digits. The government also implemented three personal income tax cuts from 1973 to 1975.\nInflation.\nWhile popular with the electorate, Trudeau's promised minor reforms had little effect on the growing rate of inflation, and he struggled with conflicting advice on the crisis. In September 1975, finance minister John Turner resigned over refusing to implement wage and price controls. In December 1975, in an embarrassing about-face, Trudeau and new Finance Minister Donald Macdonald introduced wage and price controls by passing the \"Anti-Inflation Act\", despite campaigning against them in the 1974 election. Amongst its many controls, it limited pay increases for federal government employees and employees in companies with over 500 workers to 10 percent in 1976, 8 percent in 1977, and 6 percent in 1978. The Act also established the anti-inflation board which oversaw the implementation of wage and price controls and had the ability to recommend decreases in prices of goods, wage cuts, and rebates to customers of various services. The breadth of the legislation, which touched on many powers traditionally considered the purview of the provinces, prompted a Supreme Court reference that only upheld the legislation as an emergency requiring Federal intervention under the \"British North America Act\". During the annual 1975 Christmas interview with CTV, Trudeau discussed the economy, citing market failures and stating that more state intervention would be necessary. However, the academic wording and hypothetical solutions posed during the complex discussion led much of the public to believe he had declared capitalism itself a failure, creating a lasting distrust among increasingly neoliberal business leaders. The controls lasted until 1978 and the anti-inflation board was dissolved in 1979.\nEnergy policy.\nOn September 4, 1973, Trudeau requested that the Western Canadian provinces agree to a voluntary freeze on oil prices during the ongoing Arab oil embargo. Nine days later, the Trudeau government imposed a 40-cent tax on every barrel of Canadian oil exported to the United States to combat rising inflation and oil prices. The tax was equivalent to the difference between domestic and international oil prices, and the revenues were used to subsidize oil imports for Eastern refiners. The Premier of oil-rich Alberta, Peter Lougheed, called the decision \"the most discriminatory action taken by a federal government against a particular province in the entire history of Confederation.\" While revenues decreased for Western provinces (particularly Alberta) and for the petroleum industry, Trudeau's government subsidized Eastern consumers, angering Alberta, who successfully fought for control of its natural resources in 1930.\nIn the early 1970s, the petroleum industry was largely under foreign (mainly American) control, the recent discovery of oil in Alaska put corporate pressure on the Canadian Arctic, and Canada's energy sector increasingly focused on North American rather than domestic needs. Trudeau's government initially rejected the idea of creating a nationalized oil company (which was perceived to secure supplies, improve revenue collection, and give governments better information on the global energy market), arguing it would be costly and inefficient. However, after the late 1973 oil crisis saw global oil prices quadruple, questions arose about whether Canada should continue importing oil. Though Canada also exported oil at times, the provinces of Quebec and Atlantic Canada were at risk of a cut-off of imports; as a result, Canada was in need of knowing more about its potential to produce energy. In late October 1973, Trudeau's government adopted a motion from the New Democratic Party (which the Trudeau minority government relied on for support) to establish a nationalized oil company. The \"Petro-Canada Act\" was passed in 1975 (under a Trudeau majority government), resulting in the creation of a new crown corporation, Petro-Canada. Petro-Canada was mandated to acquire imported oil supplies, take part in energy research and development, and engage in downstream activities such as refining and marketing. The corporation started with an initial $1.5 billion in capital and had preferential access to debt capital as \"an agent of Her Majesty\". Trudeau's government gave itself authority over Petro-Canada's capital budget and its corporate strategy, making the company its policy arm; the government also wanted the company to be mainly active on the frontiers (the oil sands, the Arctic, and the East Coast offshore areas) rather than Western Canada, where most Canadian oil is extracted. In 1976, Trudeau appointed his friend, Maurice Strong, to become the first chair of the company.\nForeign affairs.\nIn foreign affairs, Trudeau kept Canada in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), but often pursued an independent path in international relations.\nTrudeau was the first world leader to meet John Lennon and his wife Yoko Ono on their 1969 \"tour for world peace\". Lennon said, after talking with Trudeau for 50 minutes, that Trudeau was \"a beautiful person\" and that \"if all politicians were like Pierre Trudeau, there would be world peace\". The diplomat John G. H. Halstead who worked as a close adviser to Trudeau for a time described him as a man who never read any of the policy papers submitted by the External Affairs department, instead preferring short briefings on the issues before meeting other leaders and that Trudeau usually tried to \"wing\" his way through international meetings by being witty. Halstead stated that Trudeau viewed foreign policy as \"only for dabbing\", saying he much preferred domestic affairs.\nNATO.\nIn August 1968, the Trudeau government expressed disapproval of the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia, having the Canadian delegation at the United Nations vote for a resolution condemning the invasion, which failed to pass owing to a Soviet veto. However, Trudeau made it clear that he did not want an intensified Cold War as a result of the invasion, and worked to avoid a rupture with Moscow. In a speech in December 1968, Trudeau asked: \"Can we assume Russia wants war because it invaded Czechoslovakia?\".\nIn 1968\u20131969, Trudeau wanted to pull Canada out of NATO, arguing that the principle of mutual assured destruction (MAD) caused by a Soviet-American nuclear exchange made it highly unlikely that the Soviet Union would ever invade West Germany, thereby making NATO into an expensive irrelevance in his view. In March 1969, Trudeau visited Washington to meet President Richard Nixon. Although the meeting was very civil, Nixon came to intensely dislike Trudeau over time, referring to the Prime Minister in 1971 as \"that asshole Trudeau\". Nixon made it clear to Trudeau that a Canada that remained in NATO would be taken more seriously in Washington than a Canada that left NATO. Trudeau himself noted during a speech given before the National Press Club during the same visit that the United States was by far Canada's largest trading partner, saying: \"Living next to you is in some way like sleeping with an elephant; no matter how friendly and even-tempered the beast, one is affected by every twitch and grunt\".\nThe NATO question sharply divided the Cabinet. Diplomat Marcel Cadieux accused Trudeau of \"not seeming to believe in the Soviet danger\". As a diplomat, the devout Catholic Cadieux had served on the International Control Commission in 1954\u201355, where his experiences of witnessing the exodus of two million Vietnamese Catholics from North Vietnam to South Vietnam made him into a very firm anti-Communist. In late March 1969, Trudeau's cabinet was torn by debate as ministers divided into pro-NATO and anti-NATO camps, and Trudeau's own feelings were with the latter. Defence Minister L\u00e9o Cadieux threatened to resign in protest if Canada left NATO, leading Trudeau, who wanted to keep a French-Canadian in a high-profile portfolio such as the Department of National Defence, to meet Cadieux on April 2 to discuss a possible compromise. Trudeau and Cadieux agreed that Canada would stay in NATO, but drastically cut back its contributions, despite warnings from Ross Campbell, the Canadian member of the NATO Council, that the scale of the cuts envisioned would break Canada's treaty commitments. Ultimately, the fact the United States would be more favourably disposed to a Canada in NATO and the need to maintain Cabinet unity led Trudeau to decide, despite his own inclinations, to stay in NATO. After much discussion within the cabinet, Trudeau finally declared that Canada would stay within NATO after all on April 3, but he would cut back Canada's forces within Europe by 50%. The way that Canada cut its NATO contributions by 50% caused tensions with other NATO allies, with the British government of Prime Minister Harold Wilson publicly protesting the cuts.\nUnited States.\nRelations with the United States deteriorated on many points during the Nixon presidency (1969\u201374), including trade disputes, defence agreements, energy, fishing, the environment, cultural imperialism, and foreign policy. On January 4, 1973, Trudeau voted for a resolution in the House of Commons that condemned the American Christmas bombings against North Vietnam between December 18 and 29, 1972. As a consequence, Canadian-American relations, already under stress because of the mutual contempt between Nixon and Trudeau, reached a post-war nadir. Nixon was infuriated by the resolution and refused to see Marcel Cadieux, now the Canadian ambassador in Washington, in protest for the rest of 1973. Nixon was only prevented from lashing out more by his desire to have Canada continue as the pro-Western member on the International Control Commission for Vietnam. Prompted by Halstead, who was known as a proponent of economic \"rebalancing\" by seeking closer economic ties with the EEC, Trudeau made a visit to Brussels in October 1973 to see Fran\u00e7ois-Xavier Ortoli, the president of the European Commission, to ask for a Canadian-EEC free trade agreement. Halstead used Nixon's displeasure with Canada as an argument that it was finally time for \"economic rebalancing\" by seeking closer ties with the EEC, a thesis that Halstead had been advocating ever since the early 1960s. Ortoli refused Trudeau's request for a free trade agreement with the EEC, saying that was out of the question, but did agree to open talks on lowering tariffs between Canada and the EEC.\nTrudeau continued his attempts at increasing Canada's international profile, including joining the G7 group of major economic powers in 1976 at the behest of U.S. President Gerald Ford. American-Canadian relations changed for the better when Trudeau found a better rapport with Ford's successor, Jimmy Carter. The late 1970s saw a more sympathetic American attitude toward Canadian political and economic needs, the pardoning of draft evaders who had moved to Canada, and the passing of old sore points such as Watergate and the Vietnam War. Canada more than ever welcomed American investments during the \"stagflation\" (high inflation and high unemployment at the same time) that hurt both nations in the 1970s.\nUnited Kingdom and France.\nTrudeau attached little importance to Canada\u2013United Kingdom relations. While he rebuffed a suggestion by one of his ministers to turn Canada into a republic in 1968, he treated the Canadian monarchy with a certain bemused contempt. Britain's decision to join the European Economic Community (EEC) in 1973 and Japan's replacement of the UK as Canada's second-largest trading partner confirmed Trudeau's view that Britain was a declining power which had little to offer Canada. However, Trudeau was attached to the Commonwealth, believing it was an international body that allowed Canada to project influence on the Third World as it was one of the few bodies that allowed leaders from the First and Third Worlds to meet on a regular basis. Although France was no longer as supportive of Quebec separatism as it had been under President Charles de Gaulle in the 1960s, repeated expressions of the idea of a special Franco-Quebecois bond as opposed to a Franco-Canadian bond by French politicians throughout the 1970s led to tensions between the two nations.\nIn 1970, the Commonwealth was threatened with a split as a number of African members, supported by India, attempted to block planned British arms sales to South Africa, then under the system of apartheid. The Zambian government submitted a draft of principles which would have bound Commonwealth member states to give no assistance to nations practising racial discrimination. The first Wilson ministry had imposed an arms embargo on South Africa in 1964, which the Heath ministry ended in 1970 on the grounds that the South African government was pro-Western and anti-communist. A number of African Commonwealth nations led by Zambia and Tanzania threatened to leave the organization if the arms sales went through. When British Prime Minister Edward Heath visited Ottawa in December 1970, his meetings with Trudeau went poorly. In what was described as a \"no holds-barred\" style, Trudeau told Heath that the planned arms sales were threatening the Commonwealth's unity. \nAt a Commonwealth summit in Singapore in January 1971, Trudeau argued that apartheid was not sustainable in the long run given that Black South Africans vastly outnumbered white South Africans, and any external support for the apartheid government was myopic given that majority rule was inevitable. However, Trudeau worked for a compromise to avoid a split in the Commonwealth, arguing that it needed to do more to pressure South Africa to end apartheid peacefully, and saying that a race war in South Africa would be the worse possible way to end apartheid. The conference ended with a compromise agreement in which Britain would fulfil its existing arms contracts to South Africa but henceforth sell no more weapons to them; ultimately, the British only sold South Africa five attack helicopters. Singaporean Prime Minister and conference host Lee Kuan Yew later praised Trudeau for his efforts at the summit to hold the Commonwealth together, despite the passions aroused by the South African issue.\nGermany.\nTrudeau had an especially close friendship with the Social Democratic West German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt, whom he greatly liked both for his left-wing politics and as a practical politician who was more concerned about getting things done rather than with ideological questions. Schmidt was sympathetic towards Trudeau's \"rebalancing\" concept, telling Trudeau that he wanted West Germany to have two North American partners instead of one, and promised at a 1975 meeting to use West German influence within the EEC to grant Canada better trade terms in exchange for Canada spending more on its NATO commitments. After meeting Schmidt, Trudeau performed a \"volte-face\" on NATO, speaking at a press conference of how much he valued NATO as an alliance that was established for collective security in Europe. To show his approval of Schmidt, Trudeau not only agreed to spend more on NATO, but insisted that the Canadian Army buy the German-built Leopard tank, which thereby boosted the West German arms industry, over the opposition of the Finance department, which felt that buying the Leopard tanks was wasteful. Schmidt's support was especially welcome as Wilson, once again back as the British prime minister, proved unwilling to lobby for the EEC lowering tariffs on Canadian goods, merely saying that he was willing \"to interpret Canadian policy\" to the other EEC leaders. By contrast, the West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher gave Trudeau a firm promise of West German support for an EEC-Canadian economic agreement. The major hold-out was France, which was stoutly opposed to an EEC-Canadian agreement, believing that giving EEC market access to Canadian agriculture as a threat to French agriculture. In July 1976 a Canadian-EEC Framework Economic Agreement was signed, which came into effect on October 1, 1976. Trudeau hoped would be the Framework Agreement would be the first step towards a Canadian-EEC free trade agreement, but the EEC proved to be uninterested in free trade with Canada.\nChina.\nTrudeau established Canadian diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China in 1970 and became the first Canadian prime minister to make an official visit to Beijing. On February 10, 1969, the government announced its wish to establish diplomatic relations with the People's Republic, and Trudeau was mortified when the Chinese refused to respond at first, which made him look foolish. Unknown to Trudeau, the Chinese diplomatic corps had been so thoroughly purged during the Cultural Revolution that the Chinese Foreign Ministry barely functioned by early 1969. On February 19, 1969, the Chinese finally responded and agreed to open talks in Stockholm on establishing diplomatic relations, which began on April 3, 1969. Trudeau expected the negotiations to be a mere formality, but relations were not finally established until October 1970. The delay was largely because the Chinese insisted that Canada have no relations whatsoever with \"the Chiang Kai-shek gang\" as they called the Kuomintang regime in Taiwan and agree to support the Chinese position that Taiwan was a part of the People's Republic, a position that caused problems on the Canadian side as it implied Canadian support for China's viewpoint that it had the right to take Taiwan by force into the People's Republic. On October 10, 1970, a statement was issued by the External Affairs department in Ottawa saying: \"The Chinese government reaffirms that Taiwan is an inalienable part of the territory of the People's Republic of China. The Canadian government takes note of the Chinese position\". After the statement was issued, China and Canada established diplomatic relations on the same day. The so-called \"Canadian formula\" under which a nation \"takes note\" of the Chinese viewpoint that Taiwan is part of the People's Republic has been often copied by other nations that have established diplomatic relations with Beijing, most notably the United States in 1979. In October 1973, Trudeau visited Beijing to meet Chinese Communist Party Chairman Mao Zedong and premier Zhou Enlai, where Trudeau was hailed as \"old friend\", a term of high approval in China.\nIn 1976, Trudeau, succumbing to pressure from the Chinese government, issued an order barring Taiwan from participating as China in the 1976 Montreal Olympics, although technically it was a matter for the IOC. His action strained relations with the United States \u2013 from President Ford, future President Carter and the press \u2013 and subjected Canada to international condemnation and shame.\nCuba.\nTrudeau was known as a friend of Fidel Castro, the leader of Cuba. In January 1976, Trudeau visited Cuba to meet Castro and shouted to a crowd in Havana \"Viva Cuba! Viva Castro!\" (\"Long Live Cuba! Long Live Castro!\"). In November 1975, Cuba had intervened in the Angolan Civil War on the side of the Marxist MPLA government supported by the Soviet Union which was fighting against the UNITA and FNLA guerrilla movements supported by the United States, South Africa and Zaire (the present-day Democratic Republic of the Congo). Although both Zaire and South Africa had also intervened in Angola, sending in troops to support the FLNA and UNITA respectively, it was the Cuban intervention in Angola that caused controversy in the West. Many people in the West saw the Cuban intervention as aggression and a power play by the Soviet Union to win a sphere of influence in Africa. Angola was amply endowed with oil, and many saw the victory of the MPLA/Cuban forces in the first round of the Angolan civil war in 1975\u20131976 as a major blow to Western interests in Africa. Trudeau's remarks in Havana were widely seen in the West as expressing approval not only of Cuba's Communist government, but also of the Cuban intervention in Angola. In fact, Trudeau did press Castro in private to pull his troops out of Angola, only for Castro to insist that Cuba would do so only when South Africa likewise pulled its forces out of not only Angola, but also South West Africa (modern-day Namibia). Trudeau's embrace of Castro attracted much criticism in the United States, which allowed Trudeau to appear as a leader who was \"standing up\" to the United States without seriously damaging American-Canadian relations.\nRe-elections.\n1972 election.\nOn September 1, 1972, over four years into the Liberals' five-year mandate, Trudeau called an election for October 30. At the start of the campaign, polls showed the Liberals 10 points ahead of the Progressive Conservatives led by Robert Stanfield, who previously lost to Trudeau in the 1968 election. However, the results produced a Liberal minority government, with the Liberals winning 109 seats compared to the PCs' 107; this was one of the closest elections in Canadian history. Trudeaumania from the 1968 election had worn off, not least because of a slumping economy and rising unemployment. The NDP, led by David Lewis, held the balance of power.\n1974 election.\nIn May 1974, the House of Commons passed a motion of no confidence in the Trudeau government, defeating its budget bill after Trudeau intentionally antagonized Stanfield and Lewis. The ensuing election focused mainly on the then-ongoing recession. Stanfield proposed the immediate introduction of wage and price controls to help end the increasing inflation Canada was facing. Trudeau mocked the proposal, telling a newspaper reporter that it was the equivalent of a magician saying \"Zap! You're frozen\", and instead promoted a variety of small tax cuts to curb inflation. According to Trudeau's biographer John English, NDP supporters scared of wage controls moved toward the Liberals during the campaign.\nThe Liberals were re-elected with a majority government, winning 141 out of 264 seats, prompting Stanfield's retirement. However, the Liberals did not win any seats in Alberta, where Premier Peter Lougheed was a vociferous opponent of Trudeau's 1974 budget.\nDefeat in 1979.\nAs the 1970s wore on, growing public exhaustion towards Trudeau's personality and the country's constitutional debates caused his poll numbers to fall rapidly in the late 1970s. At the 1978 G7 summit, he discussed strategies for the upcoming election with West German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt, who advised him to announce several spending cuts to quell criticism of the large deficits his government was running.\nAfter a series of by-election defeats in 1978, Trudeau waited as long as he could to call a general election in 1979. He finally did so, only two months from the five-year limit provided under the \"British North America Act\". During the election campaign, the Liberals faced declining poll numbers, while the Joe Clark\u2013led Progressive Conservatives focused on \"pocketbook\" issues. To contrast Trudeau's image with that of the mild-mannered Clark, Trudeau and his advisors based their campaign on Trudeau's decisive personality and his grasp of the Constitution file, despite the general public's apparent wariness of both. The traditional Liberal rally at Maple Leaf Gardens saw Trudeau stressing the importance of major constitutional reform to general ennui, and his campaign \"photo-ops\" were typically surrounded by picket lines and protesters. Though polls portended disaster, Clark's struggles justifying his party's populist platform and a strong Trudeau performance in the election debate helped bring the Liberals to a near statistical ties in opinion polls.\nAlthough the Liberal Party won the popular vote by four points, its vote was concentrated in Quebec and faltered in industrial Ontario. This allowed the PCs to win a plurality of the seats in the House of Commons and form a minority government.\nOpposition leader (1979\u20131980).\nTrudeau soon announced his intention to resign as Liberal Party leader and favoured Donald Macdonald to be his successor. However, before a leadership convention could be held, with Trudeau's blessing and Allan MacEachen's manoeuvring in the House, the Liberals supported an NDP subamendment to Clark's budget stating that the House had no confidence in the budget. In Canada, as in most other countries with a Westminster system, budget votes are indirectly considered to be votes of confidence in the government, and their failure automatically brings down the government. Liberal and NDP votes and Social Credit abstentions led to the subamendment passing 139\u2013133, thereby toppling Clark's government and triggering a new election for a House less than a year old. The Liberal caucus, along with friends and advisors, persuaded Trudeau to stay on as leader and fight the election, with Trudeau's main impetus being the upcoming referendum on Quebec sovereignty.\nTrudeau and the Liberals engaged in a new strategy for the February 1980 election: facetiously called the \"low bridge\", it involved dramatically underplaying Trudeau's role and avoiding media appearances, to the point of refusing a televised debate. On election day, Ontario returned to the Liberal fold, and Trudeau and the Liberals defeated Clark and won a majority government.\nSecond premiership (1980\u20131984).\nThe Liberal victory in 1980 highlighted a sharp geographical divide in the country: the party had won no seats west of Manitoba. Trudeau, in an attempt to represent Western interests, offered to form a coalition government with Ed Broadbent's NDP, which had won 22 seats in the west, but was rebuffed by Broadbent out of fear the party would have no influence in a majority government.\n1980 Quebec referendum.\nThe first challenge Trudeau faced upon re-election was the 1980 Quebec sovereignty referendum, called by the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois government of Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque. Trudeau immediately initiated federal involvement in the referendum, reversing the Clark government's policy of leaving the issue to the Quebec Liberals and Claude Ryan. He appointed Jean Chr\u00e9tien as the nominal spokesman for the federal government, helping to push the \"Non\" cause to working-class voters who tuned out the intellectual Ryan and Trudeau. Unlike Ryan and the Liberals, he refused to acknowledge the legitimacy of the referendum question, and noted that the \"association\" required consent from the other provinces.\nIn the debates in the legislature during the campaign leading up to the referendum, L\u00e9vesque said that Trudeau's middle name was Scottish, and that Trudeau's aristocratic upbringing proved that he was more Scottish than French. A week prior to the referendum, Trudeau delivered one of his most well-known speeches, in which he extolled the virtues of federalism and questioned the ambiguous language of the referendum question. He described the origin of the name as Canadian. Trudeau promised a new constitutional agreement should Quebec decide to stay in Canada, in which English-speaking Canadians would have to listen to valid concerns made by the Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois. On May 20, sixty percent of Quebeckers voted to remain in Canada. Following the announcement of the results, Trudeau said that he \"had never been so proud to be a Quebecker and a Canadian\".\nEconomy and oil.\nIn the government's first budget, delivered in October 1980 by Finance Minister Allan MacEachen (a long-time Trudeau loyalist), the National Energy Program (NEP) was introduced. One of the Liberals' most contentious policies, the NEP was fiercely protested by the Western provinces and was seen as unfairly depriving them of the full economic benefit of their oil and gas resources, in order to pay for nationwide social programs and make regional transfer payments to poorer parts of the country. Sentiments of this kind were especially strong in oil-rich Alberta, where unemployment rose from 4% to 10% following passage of the NEP. The western provinces blamed the devastating oil bust of the 1980s on the NEP, which led to what many termed \"Western alienation\". Alberta premier Peter Lougheed entered into tough negotiations with Trudeau, reaching a revenue-sharing agreement on energy in 1982. Estimates have placed Alberta's losses between $50\u00a0billion and $100\u00a0billion because of the NEP.\nThis first budget was one of a series of unpopular budgets delivered in response to the oil shock of 1979 and the ensuing severe global economic recession which began at the start of 1980. In his budget speech, MacEachen said that the global oil price shocks\u2014 in 1973 and again in 1979 \u2014 had caused a \"sharp renewal of inflationary forces and real income losses\" in Canada and in the industrial world...They are not just Canadian problems\u00a0... they are world-wide problems.\" Leaders of developed countries raised their concerns at the Venice Summit, at meetings of Finance Ministers of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The Bank of Canada wrote that there was a \"deeply troubling air of uncertainty and anxiety\" about the economy.\nAmongst the policies introduced during Trudeau's last term in office were an expansion in government support for Canada's poorest citizens. By the time Trudeau left office in 1984, the budget deficit was at $37 billion (fiscal year 1984\u20131985). Trudeau's first budget (fiscal year 1968\u20131969) only had a deficit of $667 million. Inflation and unemployment marred much of Trudeau's tenure as prime minister. When Trudeau took office in 1968, Canada had a debt of $18\u00a0billion (24% of GDP) which was largely left over from World War II. When he left office in 1984, that debt stood at $200\u00a0billion (46% of GDP), an increase of 83% in real terms.\nPatriation of the constitution.\nIn 1982, Trudeau succeeded in patriating the Constitution. In response to a formal request from the Canadian Houses of Parliament, with the consent of all provinces except Quebec, the British Parliament passed an act ceding to the governments of Canada the full responsibility for amending Canada's Constitution. Earlier in his tenure, he had met with opposition from the provincial governments, most notably with the Victoria Charter. Provincial premiers were united in their concerns regarding an amending formula, a court-enforced Charter of Rights, and a further devolution of powers to the provinces. In 1980, Chr\u00e9tien was tasked with creating a constitutional settlement following the Quebec referendum in which Quebeckers voted to remain in Canada.\nAfter chairing a series of increasingly acrimonious conferences with first ministers on the issue, Trudeau announced the federal government's intention to proceed with a request to the British Parliament to patriate the constitution unilaterally, with additions to be approved by a referendum without input from provincial governments. Trudeau was backed by the NDP, Ontario Premier Bill Davis, and New Brunswick Premier Richard Hatfield and was opposed by the remaining premiers and PC leader Joe Clark. After numerous provincial governments challenged the legality of the decision using their reference power, conflicting decisions prompted a Supreme Court decision that stated unilateral patriation was legal, but was in contravention of a constitutional convention that the provinces be consulted and have general agreement to the changes.\nAfter the court decision, which prompted some reservations in the British Parliament of accepting a unilateral request, Trudeau agreed to meet with the premiers one more time before proceeding. At this meeting, Trudeau reached an agreement with nine of the premiers on patriating the constitution and implementing the \"Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms\", with the caveat that Parliament and the provincial legislatures would have the ability to use a notwithstanding clause to protect some laws from judicial oversight. The notable exception was L\u00e9vesque who, Trudeau believed, would never have signed an agreement. The objection of the Quebec government to the new constitutional provisions became a source of continued acrimony between the federal and Quebec governments, and would forever stain Trudeau's reputation amongst nationalists in the province.\nThe \"Constitution Act, 1982\", including the \"Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms\", was proclaimed by Queen Elizabeth II, as Queen of Canada, on April 17, 1982. With the enactment of the \"Canada Act 1982\", the British Parliament ceded all authority over Canada to the governments of Canada. The \"Constitution Act, 1982\", part of the \"Canada Act 1982\", established the supremacy of the Constitution of Canada, which now could only be amended by the federal and provincial governments, under the amending formula established by the \"Constitution Act, 1982\".\nThe Charter represented the final step in Trudeau's liberal vision of a fully independent Canada based on fundamental human rights and the protection of individual freedoms as well as those of linguistic and cultural minorities. Section 35 of the \"Constitution Act, 1982\", clarified issues of aboriginal and equality rights, including establishing the previously denied aboriginal rights of M\u00e9tis. Section 15, dealing with equality rights, has been used to remedy societal discrimination against minority groups. The coupling of the direct and indirect influences of the Charter has meant that it has grown to influence every aspect of Canadian life and the Charter's notwithstanding clause has been infrequently used.\nResignation.\nBy 1984, the Progressive Conservatives held a substantial lead in opinion polls under their new leader Brian Mulroney, and polls indicated that the Liberals faced all-but-certain defeat if Trudeau led them into the next election.\nOn February 29, 1984, a day after what he described as a walk through the snowy streets of Ottawa, Trudeau announced he would not lead the Liberals into the next election. He was frequently known to use the term \"walk in the snow\" as a trope; he claimed to have taken a similar walk in December 1979 before deciding to take the Liberals into the 1980 election.\nTrudeau formally retired on June 30, ending his 15-year tenure as prime minister. He was succeeded by John Turner, a former Cabinet minister under both Trudeau and Lester Pearson. Before handing power to Turner, Trudeau took the unusual step of appointing Liberal Senators from Western provinces to his Cabinet. He advised Governor General Jeanne Sauv\u00e9 to appoint over 200 Liberals to patronage positions. He and Turner then crafted a legal agreement calling for Turner to advise an additional 70 patronage appointments. The sheer volume of appointments, combined with questions about the appointees' qualifications, led to condemnation from across the political spectrum. However, an apparent rebound in the polls prompted Turner to call an election for September 1984.\nTurner's appointment deal with Trudeau came back to haunt the Liberals at the English-language debate, when Mulroney demanded that Turner apologize for not advising that the appointments be cancelled\u2014advice that Sauv\u00e9 would have been required to follow by convention. Turner claimed that \"I had no option\" but to let the appointments stand, prompting Mulroney to tell him, \"You had an option, sir\u2013to say 'no'\u2013and you chose to say 'yes' to the old attitudes and the old stories of the Liberal Party.\" (Mulroney himself soon engaged in his own series of patronage appointments.)\nIn the election, Mulroney's PCs took slightly more than half the votes cast and 73 percent of the seats, winning the largest majority government (by total number of seats) and second-largest majority (by proportion of seats) in Canadian history. The Liberals, with Turner as leader, lost 95 seats \u2013 at the time, the worst defeat of a sitting government at the federal level (by proportion of seats).\nAfter politics (1984\u20132000).\nTrudeau joined the Montreal law firm Heenan Blaikie as counsel and settled in the historic Maison Cormier in Montreal following his retirement from politics. Though he rarely gave speeches or spoke to the press, his interventions into public debate had a significant impact when they occurred. Trudeau wrote and spoke out against both the Meech Lake Accord and Charlottetown Accord proposals to amend the Canadian constitution, arguing that they would weaken federalism and the Charter of Rights if implemented. The Meech Lake Accord granted Quebec the constitutional right to be a \"distinct society\" within Canada, which theoretically could have been the basis of a wide-ranging devolution of power to Quebec. The Quebec government potentially could have been allowed to pass any law short of secession to protect Quebec's constitutional right to be a \"distinct society\". Trudeau claimed in his speeches that giving Quebec the constitutional status of a \"distinct society\" would lead to the Quebec government deporting members of Quebec's English-speaking minority. His opposition to both accords was considered one of the major factors leading to the defeat of the two proposals.\nHe also continued to speak against the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois and the sovereignty movement with less effect.\nTrudeau also remained active in international affairs, visiting foreign leaders and participating in international associations such as the Club of Rome. He met with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and other leaders in 1985; shortly afterwards Gorbachev met U.S. President Ronald Reagan to discuss easing world tensions.\nHe published his reminiscences in \"Memoirs\" in 1993. The book sold hundreds of thousands of copies in several editions, and became one of the most successful Canadian books ever published.\nIn his old age, Trudeau was afflicted with Parkinson's disease and prostate cancer, and became less active, although he continued to work at his law practice until a few months before his death at the age of 80. He was devastated by the death of his youngest son, Michel Trudeau, who was killed in an avalanche on November 13, 1998.\nDeath and funeral.\nTrudeau succumbed to several health complications at his Montreal home on September 28, 2000. His death has been attributed to his prostate cancer, Parkinson's disease, a prior battle with pneumonia, as well as the depression felt following his son's death in 1998. At the time of his death, he was surrounded by Margaret as well as his sons Justin and Sacha. He was 80 years old.\nFollowing his death, Trudeau's casket lay in state in the Hall of Honour in Parliament Hill's Centre Block from September 30 to October 1, 2000. His funeral took place on October 3, 2000, at the Notre-Dame Basilica in Montreal. Several world politicians, including U.S. President Jimmy Carter and Cuban leader Fidel Castro, attended the funeral. His son Justin delivered the eulogy during the state funeral, which led to widespread speculation in the media that a career in politics was in his future.\nPierre Elliot Trudeau was interred in the Trudeau family mausoleum at St-R\u00e9mi-de-Napierville Cemetery in Saint-R\u00e9mi, Quebec. Per his family's wishes, the burial was private and attended only by immediate family and friends.\nPersonal life.\nReligious beliefs.\nTrudeau was Catholic and attended Mass throughout his life. While mostly private about his beliefs, he made it clear that he was a believer, stating, in an interview with the \"United Church Observer\" in 1971: \"I believe in life after death, I believe in God and I'm a Christian.\" Trudeau maintained, however, that he preferred to impose constraints on himself rather than have them imposed from the outside. In this sense, he believed he was more like a Protestant than a Catholic of the era in which he was schooled.\nMichael W. Higgins, a former president of Catholic St. Thomas University, researched Trudeau's spirituality and found that it incorporated elements of three Catholic traditions. The first of these was the Jesuits, who provided his education up to the college level. Trudeau frequently displayed the logic and love of argument consistent with that tradition. A second great spiritual influence in Trudeau's life was the Dominican Order. According to Michel Gourgues, professor at Dominican University College, Trudeau \"considered himself a lay Dominican\". He studied philosophy under Dominican Father Louis-Marie R\u00e9gis and remained close to him throughout his life, regarding R\u00e9gis as \"spiritual director and friend\". Another element in Trudeau's spirituality was an appreciation for contemplation acquired from his association with the Benedictine tradition. According to Higgins, Trudeau was convinced of the centrality of meditation in a life fully lived. Trudeau meditated regularly after being initiated into Transcendental Meditation by the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. He took retreats at Saint-Beno\u00eet-du-Lac, Quebec and regularly attended Hours and Mass at Montreal's Benedictine community.\nAlthough never publicly theological in the way of Margaret Thatcher or Tony Blair, nor evangelical, in the way of Jimmy Carter or George W. Bush, Trudeau's spirituality, according to Michael W. Higgins, \"suffused, anchored, and directed his inner life. In no small part, it defined him.\" Prior to his career in politics and evident shift towards religion and to practicing Catholicism, Trudeau had been a secular humanist and worked as a board member of the Humanist Fellowship of Montreal until moving to Ottawa to become an MP in 1965.\nMarriage and children.\nDescribed as a \"swinging young bachelor\" when he became prime minister, in 1968, Trudeau was reportedly dating Barbra Streisand in 1969 and 1970. While a serious romantic relationship, there was no express marriage proposal, contrary to one contemporary published report.\nOn March 4, 1971, while prime minister, Trudeau quietly married 22-year-old Margaret Sinclair, who was 29 years younger, at St. Stephen's Catholic Church in North Vancouver.\nBelying his publicized social exploits, and nicknames like \"Swinging Pierre\" and \"Trendy Trudeau\"; he was an intense intellectual with robust work habits and little time for family or fun. As a result, Margaret felt trapped and bored in the marriage, feelings that were exacerbated by her bipolar depression, with which she was later diagnosed.\nThe couple had three sons: the first two, Justin (born 1971), later 23rd Prime Minister of Canada himself, and Alexandre (born 1973). Both Justin and Alexandre were born on Christmas Day, two years apart. Their third son, Michel (1975\u20131998), died in an avalanche while skiing in Kokanee Glacier Provincial Park. Trudeau and Margaret separated in 1977, and were divorced in 1984. He was involved with guitarist Liona Boyd for eight years during this time.\nWhen his divorce was finalized in 1984, Trudeau became the first Canadian prime minister to become a single parent as the result of divorce. In 1984, Trudeau was romantically involved with Margot Kidder (a Canadian actress famous for her role as Lois Lane in \"Superman: The Movie\" and its sequels) in the last months of his prime-ministership and after leaving office.\nIn 1991, Trudeau became a father again, with Deborah Margaret Ryland Coyne, to his only daughter, Sarah. Coyne later stood for the 2013 Liberal Party of Canada leadership election and came fifth in a poll won by Justin.\nTrudeau began practising judo sometime in the mid-1950s when he was in his mid-thirties, and by the end of the decade, he was ranked \"ikky\u016b\" (brown belt). Later, when he travelled to Japan as prime minister, he was promoted to \"shodan\" (first-degree black belt) by the Kodokan, and then promoted to \"nidan\" (second-degree black belt) by Masao Takahashi in Ottawa before leaving office. Trudeau began the night of his famous \"walk in the snow\" before announcing his retirement in 1984 by going to judo with his sons.\nIntellectual contributions.\nTrudeau was a strong advocate for a federalist model of government in Canada, developing and promoting his ideas in response and contrast to strengthening Quebec nationalist movements, for instance the social and political atmosphere created during Maurice Duplessis' time in power.\nFederalism in this context can be defined as \"a particular way of sharing political power among different peoples within a state...Those who believe in federalism hold that different peoples do not need states of their own in order to enjoy self-determination. Peoples\u00a0... may agree to share a single state while retaining substantial degrees of self-government over matters essential to their identity as peoples\".\nAs a social democrat, Trudeau sought to combine and harmonize his theories on social democracy with those of federalism so that both could find effective expression in Canada. He noted the ostensible conflict between socialism, with its usually strong centralist government model, and federalism, which expounded a division and cooperation of power by both federal and provincial levels of government. In particular, Trudeau stated the following about socialists:&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;[R]ather than water down\u00a0... their socialism, must constantly seek ways of adapting it to a bicultural society governed under a federal constitution. And since the future of Canadian federalism lies clearly in the direction of co-operation, the wise socialist will turn his thoughts in that direction, keeping in mind the importance of establishing buffer zones of joint sovereignty and co-operative zones of joint administration between the two levels of government\nTrudeau pointed out that in sociological terms, Canada is inherently a federalist society, forming unique regional identities and priorities, and therefore a federalist model of spending and jurisdictional powers is most appropriate. He argues, \"in the age of the mass society, it is no small advantage to foster the creation of quasi-sovereign communities at the provincial level, where power is that much less remote from the people\".\nTrudeau's idealistic plans for a cooperative Canadian federalist state were resisted and hindered as a result of his narrowness on ideas of identity and socio-cultural pluralism: \"While the idea of a 'nation' in the sociological sense is acknowledged by Trudeau, he considers the allegiance which it generates\u2014emotive and particularistic\u2014to be contrary to the idea of cohesion between humans, and as such creating fertile ground for the internal fragmentation of states and a permanent state of conflict\".\nThis position garnered significant criticism for Trudeau, in particular from Quebec and First Nations peoples on the basis that his theories denied their rights to nationhood. First Nations communities raised particular concerns with the proposed 1969 White Paper, developed under Trudeau by Jean Chr\u00e9tien.\nTrudeau and the Quebec federalist historian Fernand Ouellet, who was a devout follower and admirer of Trudeau and Trudeauism, frequently influenced each other intellectually in their ideas and texts on their anti-nationalist conception of the history of Quebec, though they never formed a personal friendship.\nLegacy.\nTrudeau remains well regarded by many Canadians. However, the passage of time has only slightly softened the strong antipathy he inspired among his opponents. Trudeau's strong personality, contempt for his opponents and distaste for compromise on many issues have made him, as historian Michael Bliss puts it, \"one of the most admired and most disliked of all Canadian prime ministers\". \"He haunts us still\", biographers Christina McCall and Stephen Clarkson wrote in 1990. Trudeau's electoral successes were matched in the 20th century only by those of William Lyon Mackenzie King.\nTrudeau's most enduring legacy may lie in his contribution to Canadian nationalism, and of pride in Canada in and for itself rather than as a derivative of the British Commonwealth. His role in this effort, and his related battles with Quebec on behalf of Canadian unity, cemented his political position when in office despite the controversies he faced\u2014and remain the most remembered aspect of his tenure afterwards.\nMany politicians still use the term \"taking a walk in the snow\", the line Trudeau used to describe how he arrived at the decision to leave office in 1984. Other popular Trudeauisms frequently used are \"just watch me\", the \"Trudeau Salute\", and \"Fuddle Duddle\".\n\"Maclean's\" 1997 and 2011 scholarly surveys ranked him twice as the fifth best Canadian prime minister, and in 2016, the fourth best. The CBC's special on \"The Greatest Canadian\" saw him ranked as the third greatest Canadian of all time, behind Tommy Douglas and Terry Fox, from the over 1.2 million votes cast by watchers of the program.\nBilingualism.\nBilingualism is one of Trudeau's most lasting accomplishments, having been fully integrated into the Federal government's services, documents, and broadcasting (though not, however, in provincial governments, except for full bilingualism in New Brunswick and some French language service rights in Ontario and Manitoba). While official bilingualism has settled some of the grievances Francophones had towards the federal government, many Francophones had hoped that Canadians would be able to function in the official language of their choice no matter where in the country they were.\nHowever, Trudeau's ambitions in this arena have been overstated: Trudeau once said that he regretted the use of the term \"bilingualism\", because it appeared to demand that all Canadians speak two languages. In fact, Trudeau's vision was to see Canada as a bilingual confederation in which \"all\" cultures would have a place. In this way, his conception broadened beyond simply the relationship of Quebec to Canada.\nConstitutional legacy.\nThe \"Charter of Rights and Freedoms\" was one of Trudeau's most enduring legacies. It is seen as advancing civil rights and liberties and has become a cornerstone of Canadian values for most Canadians. Court challenges based on the \"Charter\" have been used to advance the cause of women's equality, establish French school boards in provinces with majority anglophone populations, and provide constitutional protection to English school boards in Quebec. Court actions under the Charter resulted in the adoption of same-sex marriage all across Canada by the federal Parliament.\nLegacy in western Canada.\nTrudeau's posthumous reputation in the western provinces is notably less favourable than in the rest of English-speaking Canada, and he is sometimes regarded as the \"father of Western alienation\". To many westerners, Trudeau's policies seemed to favour other parts of the country, especially Ontario and Qu\u00e9bec, at their expense. Outstanding among such policies was the National Energy Program, which was seen as unfairly depriving western provinces of the full economic benefit from their oil and gas resources, in order to pay for nationwide social programs, and make regional transfer payments to poorer parts of the country. Sentiments of this kind were especially strong in oil-rich Alberta. In British Columbia, Premier W. A. C. Bennett in 1970 argued that Trudeau's government is Quebec nationalist-oriented. He also implied that Quebec received special treatment from Ottawa as a result.\nMore particularly, two incidents involving Trudeau are remembered as having fostered Western alienation, and as emblematic of it. During a visit to Saskatoon, Saskatchewan on July 17, 1969, Trudeau met with a group of farmers who were protesting the Canadian Wheat Board. The widely remembered perception is that Trudeau dismissed the protesters' concerns with \"Why should \"I\" sell your wheat?\"\u00a0\u2013 however, he had asked the question rhetorically and then proceeded to answer it himself. Years later, on a train trip through Salmon Arm, British Columbia, he \"gave the finger\" to a group of protesters through the carriage window\u00a0\u2013 less widely remembered is that the protesters were shouting anti-French slogans at the train.\nLegacy in Quebec.\nTrudeau's legacy in Quebec is mixed. Many credit his actions during the October Crisis as crucial in terminating the Front de lib\u00e9ration du Qu\u00e9bec (FLQ) as a force in Quebec, and ensuring that the campaign for Quebec separatism took a democratic and peaceful route. However, his imposition of the \"War Measures Act\"\u2014which received majority support at the time\u2014is remembered by some in Quebec and elsewhere as an attack on democracy. Trudeau is also credited by many for the defeat of the 1980 Quebec referendum.\nAt the federal level, Trudeau faced almost no strong political opposition in Quebec during his time as prime minister. For instance, his Liberal party captured 74 out of 75 Qu\u00e9bec seats in the 1980 federal election. Provincially, though, Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois twice elected the pro-sovereignty Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois. Moreover, there were not at that time any pro-sovereignty federal parties such as the Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois. Since the signing of the \"Constitution Act, 1982\" in 1982 and until 2015, the Liberal Party of Canada had not succeeded in winning a majority of seats in Quebec. He was disliked by the Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois nationalists.\nIn popular culture.\n\"Trudeau\" is a 2002 television miniseries which aired on CBC Television. It was written by Wayne Grigsby, directed by Jerry Ciccoritti and features Colm Feore in the title role.\nA prequel, \"Trudeau II: Maverick in the Making\", was released in 2005. The four-hour CBC production examines Trudeau's early life. St\u00e9phane Demers performs in the role.\nSupreme Court appointments.\nTrudeau chose the following jurists to be appointed as justices of the Supreme Court of Canada by the Governor General:\nHonours.\nAccording to Canadian protocol, as a former prime minister, he was styled \"The Right Honourable\" for life.\n \nThe following honours were bestowed upon him by the Governor General, or by Queen Elizabeth II herself:\nOther honours include:\nHonorary degrees.\nTrudeau received several honorary degrees in recognition of his political career.\nOrder of Canada citation.\nTrudeau was appointed a Companion of the Order of Canada on June 24, 1985. His citation reads:\nLawyer, professor, author and defender of human rights this statesman served as Prime Minister of Canada for fifteen years. Lending substance to the phrase \"the style is the man\", he has imparted, both in his and on the world stage, his quintessentially personal philosophy of modern politics.\nMajor biographies.\nIn 1990, Stephen Clarkson and Christina McCall published a major biography, \"Trudeau and Our Times\", in two volumes. Volume 1, \"The Magnificent Obsession\", was the winner of the Governor General's Award.\nIn film.\nThrough hours of archival footage and interviews with Trudeau himself, the 1990 documentary \"Memoirs\" traces Trudeau's life and career.\nTrudeau's life was also depicted in two CBC Television mini-series. The first, \"Trudeau\" (2002, with Colm Feore in the title role), depicts his years as prime minister. \"Trudeau II: Maverick in the Making\" (2005, with St\u00e9phane Demers as the young Pierre, and Tobie Pelletier as Trudeau in later years) portrays his earlier life.\nThe 1999 feature-length documentary by the National Film Board of Canada (NFB) entitled \"\" explores the impact of Trudeau's vision of Canadian bilingualism through interviews with eight Canadians on how Trudeau's concept of nationalism and bilingualism affected them personally in the 1970s.\nIn the documentary mini-series \"The Champions\" directed by Donald Brittain, Trudeau was the co-subject along with Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque.\nIn 2001, the CBC produced a full-length documentary entitled \"Reflections\".\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\nrole=\"presentation\" class=\"wikitable succession-box noprint\" style=\"margin:0.5em auto; font-size:small;clear:both;\""}
{"id": "24508", "revid": "134766", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24508", "title": "Pencil", "text": "Writing implement\nA pencil () is a writing or drawing implement with a solid pigment core in a protective casing that reduces the risk of core breakage and keeps it from marking the user's hand.\nPencils create marks by physical abrasion, leaving a trail of solid core material that adheres to a sheet of paper or other surface. They are distinct from pens, which dispense liquid or gel ink onto the marked surface.\nMost pencil cores are made of graphite powder mixed with a clay binder. Graphite pencils (traditionally known as \"lead pencils\") produce grey or black marks that are easily erased, but otherwise resistant to moisture, most solvents, ultraviolet radiation and natural aging. Other types of pencil cores, such as those of charcoal, are mainly used for drawing and sketching. Coloured pencils are sometimes used by teachers or editors to correct submitted texts, but are typically regarded as art supplies, especially those with cores made from wax-based binders that tend to smear when erasers are applied to them. Grease pencils have a softer, oily core that can leave marks on smooth surfaces such as glass or porcelain.\nThe most common pencil casing is thin wood, usually hexagonal in section, but sometimes cylindrical or triangular, permanently bonded to the core. Casings may be of other materials, such as plastic or paper. To use the pencil, the casing must be carved or peeled off to expose the working end of the core as a sharp point. Mechanical pencils have more elaborate casings which are not bonded to the core; instead, they support separate, mobile pigment cores that can be extended or retracted (usually through the casing's tip) as needed. These casings can be reloaded with new cores (usually graphite) as the previous ones are exhausted.\nHistory.\nCamel hair.\n\"Pencil\", from Old French \"pincel\", from late Latin a \"little tail\" (see \"penis\"; \"pincellus\") originally referred to an artist's fine brush of camel hair, also used for writing before modern lead or chalk pencils.\nThough the archetypal pencil was an artist's brush, the stylus, a thin metal stick used for scratching in papyrus or wax tablets, was used extensively by the Romans and for palm-leaf manuscripts.\nGraphite deposit discoveries.\nAs a technique for drawing, the closest predecessor to the pencil was silverpoint or leadpoint until, in 1565 (some sources say as early as 1500), a large deposit of graphite was discovered on the approach to Grey Knotts from the hamlet of Seathwaite in Borrowdale parish, Cumbria, England. This particular deposit of graphite was extremely pure and solid, and it could easily be sawn into sticks. It remains the only large-scale deposit of graphite ever found in this solid form. Chemistry was in its infancy and the substance was thought to be a form of lead. Consequently, it was called \"plumbago\" (Latin for \"lead ore\"). Because the pencil core is still referred to as \"lead\", or \"a lead\", many people have the misconception that the graphite in the pencil is lead, and the black core of pencils is still referred to as \"lead\", even though it never contained the element lead. The words for pencil in German (\"Bleistift\"), Irish (\"peann luaidhe\"), Arabic (\u0642\u0644\u0645 \u0631\u0635\u0627\u0635 \"qalam ra\u1e63\u0101\u1e63\"), and some other languages literally mean \"lead pen\".\nThe value of graphite would soon be realised to be enormous, mainly because it could be used to line the moulds for cannonballs; the mines were taken over by the Crown and were guarded. When sufficient stores of graphite had been accumulated, the mines were flooded to prevent theft until more was required.\nThe usefulness of graphite for pencils was discovered as well, but initially graphite for pencils had to be smuggled out of England. Because graphite is soft, it requires some form of encasement. Graphite sticks were initially wrapped in string or sheepskin for stability. England would enjoy a monopoly on the production of pencils until a method of reconstituting the graphite powder was found in 1662 in Germany. However, the distinctively square English pencils continued to be made with sticks cut from natural graphite into the 1860s. The town of Keswick, near the original findings of block graphite, still manufactures pencils, the factory also being the location of the Derwent Pencil Museum. The meaning of \"graphite writing implement\" apparently evolved late in the 16th century.\nWood encasement.\nAround 1560, an Italian couple named Simonio and Lyndiana Bernacotti made what are likely the first blueprints for the modern, wood-encased carpentry pencil. Their version was a flat, oval, more compact type of pencil. Their concept involved the hollowing out of a stick of juniper wood. Shortly thereafter, a superior technique was discovered: two wooden halves were carved, a graphite stick inserted, and the halves then glued together\u2014essentially the same method in use to this day.\nGraphite powder and clay.\nThe first attempt to manufacture graphite sticks from powdered graphite was in Nuremberg, Germany, in 1662. It used a mixture of graphite, sulphur, and antimony.\nEnglish and German pencils were not available to the French during the Napoleonic Wars; France, under naval blockade imposed by Great Britain, was unable to import the pure graphite sticks from the British Grey Knotts mines \u2013 the only known source in the world. France was also unable to import the inferior German graphite pencil substitute. It took the efforts of an officer in Napoleon's army to change this. In 1795, Nicolas-Jacques Cont\u00e9 discovered a method of mixing powdered graphite with clay and forming the mixture into rods that were then fired in a kiln. By varying the ratio of graphite to clay, the hardness of the graphite rod could also be varied. This method of manufacture, which had been earlier discovered by the Austrian Joseph Hardtmuth, the founder of Vienna's Koh-I-Noor company in 1790, remains in use. In 1802, the production of graphite leads from graphite and clay was patented by Koh-I-Noor.\nIn England, pencils continued to be made from whole sawn graphite. Henry Bessemer's first successful invention (1838) was a method of compressing graphite powder into solid graphite thus allowing the waste from sawing to be reused.\nUnited States.\nAmerican colonists imported pencils from Europe until after the American Revolution. Benjamin Franklin advertised pencils for sale in \"The Pennsylvania Gazette\" in 1729, and George Washington used a pencil when he surveyed the Ohio Country in 1762. William Munroe, a cabinetmaker in Concord, Massachusetts, made the first American wood pencils in 1812. This was not the only pencil-making occurring in Concord. According to Henry Petroski, transcendentalist philosopher Henry David Thoreau discovered how to make a good pencil out of inferior graphite using clay as the binder; this invention was prompted by his father's pencil factory in Concord, which employed graphite found in New Hampshire in 1821 by Charles Dunbar.\nMunroe's method of making pencils was painstakingly slow, and in the neighbouring town of Acton, a pencil mill owner named Ebenezer Wood set out to automate the process at his own pencil mill located at Nashoba Brook. He used the first circular saw in pencil production. He constructed the first of the hexagon- and octagon-shaped wooden casings. Ebenezer did not patent his invention and shared his techniques with anyone. One of those was Eberhard Faber, which built a factory in New York and became the leader in pencil production.\nJoseph Dixon, an inventor and entrepreneur involved with the Tantiusques graphite mine in Sturbridge, Massachusetts, developed a means to mass-produce pencils. By 1870, The Joseph Dixon Crucible Company was the world's largest dealer and consumer of graphite and later became the contemporary Dixon Ticonderoga pencil and art supplies company.\nBy the end of the nineteenth century, over 240,000 pencils were used each day in the US. The favoured timber for pencils was Red Cedar as it was aromatic and did not splinter when sharpened. In the early twentieth century supplies of Red Cedar were dwindling so that pencil manufacturers were forced to recycle the wood from cedar fences and barns to maintain supply.\nOne effect of this was that \"during World War II rotary pencil sharpeners were outlawed in Britain because they wasted so much scarce lead and wood, and pencils had to be sharpened in the more conservative manner \u2013 with knives.\"\nIt was soon discovered that incense cedar, when dyed and perfumed to resemble Red Cedar, was a suitable alternative. Most pencils today are made from this timber, which is grown in managed forests. Over 14 billion pencils are manufactured worldwide annually. Less popular alternatives to cedar include basswood and alder.\nIn Southeast Asia, the wood Jelutong may be used to create pencils (though the use of this rainforest species is controversial). Environmentalists prefer the use of Pulai \u2013 another wood native to the region in pencil manufacturing.\nEraser attachment.\nOn 30 March 1858, Hymen Lipman received the first patent for attaching an eraser to the end of a pencil. In 1862, Lipman sold his patent to Joseph Reckendorfer for $100,000, who went on to sue pencil manufacturer Faber-Castell for infringement. In \"Reckendorfer v. Faber\" (1875), the Supreme Court of the United States ruled against Reckendorfer, declaring the patent invalid.\nExtenders.\nHistorian Henry Petroski notes that while ever more efficient means of mass production of pencils had driven the replacement costs down, people for some time continued to use even the stub of a pencil. For those who did not feel comfortable using a stub, pencil extenders were sold. These devices function something like a \"porte-crayon\"...the pencil stub can be inserted into the end of a shaft...Extenders were especially common among engineers and draftsmen, whose favorite pencils were priced dearly. The use of an extender also has the advantage that the pencil does not appreciably change its heft as it wears down. Artists use extenders to maximize the use of their colored pencils.\nTypes.\nBy marking material.\nGraphite.\nGraphite pencils are the most common types of pencil, and are encased in wood. They are made of a mixture of clay and graphite and their darkness varies from light grey to black. Their composition allows for the smoothest strokes.\nSolid.\nSolid graphite pencils are solid sticks of graphite and clay composite (as found in a 'graphite pencil'), about the diameter of a common pencil, which have no casing other than a wrapper or label. They are often called \"woodless\" pencils. They are used primarily for art purposes as the lack of casing allows for covering larger spaces more easily, creating different effects, and providing greater economy as the entirety of the pencil is used. They are available in the same darkness range as wood-encased graphite pencils.\nLiquid.\nLiquid graphite pencils are pencils that write like pens. The technology was first invented in 1955 by Scripto and Parker Pens. Scripto's liquid graphite formula came out about three months before Parker's liquid lead formula. To avoid a lengthy patent fight the two companies agreed to share their formulas.\nCharcoal.\nCharcoal pencils are made of charcoal and provide fuller blacks than graphite pencils, but tend to smudge easily and are more abrasive than graphite. Sepia-toned and white pencils are also available for duotone techniques.\nCarbon pencils.\nCarbon pencils are generally made of a mixture of clay and lamp black, but are sometimes blended with charcoal or graphite depending on the darkness and manufacturer. They produce a fuller black than graphite pencils, are smoother than charcoal, and have minimal dust and smudging. They also blend very well, much like charcoal.\nColored.\nColored pencils, or pencil crayons, have wax-like cores with pigment and other fillers. Several colors are sometimes blended together.\nGrease.\nGrease pencils can write on virtually any surface (including glass, plastic, metal and photographs). The most commonly found grease pencils are encased in paper (Berol and Sanford Peel-off), but they can also be encased in wood (Staedtler Omnichrom).\nWatercolor.\nWatercolor pencils are designed for use with watercolor techniques. Their cores can be diluted by water. The pencils can be used by themselves for sharp, bold lines. Strokes made by the pencil can also be saturated with water and spread with brushes.\nBy use.\nCarpentry.\nCarpenter's pencils are pencils that have two main properties: their shape prevents them from rolling, and their graphite is strong. The oldest surviving pencil is a German carpenter's pencil dating from the 17th century and now in the Faber-Castell collection.\nCopying.\nCopying pencils (or indelible pencils) are graphite pencils with an added dye that creates an indelible mark. They were invented in the late 19th century for press copying and as a practical substitute for fountain pens. Their markings are often visually indistinguishable from those of standard graphite pencils, but when moistened their markings dissolve into a coloured ink, which is then pressed into another piece of paper. They were widely used until the mid-20th century when ball pens slowly replaced them. In Italy their use is still mandated by law for voting paper ballots in elections and referendums.\nEyeliner.\nEye liner pencils are used for make-up. Unlike traditional copying pencils, eyeliner pencils usually contain non-toxic dyes.\nErasable coloring.\nUnlike wax-based colored pencils, the erasable variants can be easily erased. Their main use is in sketching, where the objective is to create an outline using the same color that other media (such as wax pencils, or watercolor paints) would fill or when the objective is to scan the color sketch. Some animators prefer erasable color pencils as opposed to graphite pencils because they do not smudge as easily, and the different colors allow for better separation of objects in the sketch. Copy-editors find them useful too as markings stand out more than those of graphite, but can be erased.\nNon-reproduction.\nAlso known as non-photo blue pencils, the non-reproducing types make marks that are not reproducible by photocopiers (examples include \"Copy-not\" by Sanford and \"Mars Non-photo\" by Staedtler) or by whiteprint copiers (such as \"Mars Non-Print\" by Staedtler).\nStenography.\nStenographer's pencils, also known as a steno pencil, are expected to be very reliable, and their lead is break-proof. Nevertheless, steno pencils are sometimes sharpened at both ends to enhance reliability. They are round to avoid pressure pain during long texts.\nGolf.\nGolf pencils are usually short (a common length is ) and very cheap. They are also known as library pencils, as many libraries offer them as disposable writing instruments with scratch paper to make notes, such as looking up materials in the card catalog to note their location.\nBy size.\nTypical.\nA standard, hexagonal, \"#2 pencil\" is cut to a hexagonal height of , but the outer diameter is slightly larger (about )\nA standard, \"#2\", hexagonal pencil is long.\nBiggest.\nOn 3 September 2007, Ashrita Furman unveiled his giant US$20,000 pencil \u2013 long, with over for the graphite centre \u2013 after three weeks of creation in August 2007 as a birthday gift for teacher Sri Chinmoy. It is longer than the pencil outside the Malaysia HQ of stationers Faber-Castell.\nBy manufacture.\nMechanical.\nMechanical pencils use mechanical methods to push lead through a hole at the end. These can be divided into two groups: with propelling pencils an internal mechanism is employed to push the lead out from an internal compartment, while clutch pencils merely hold the lead in place (the lead is extended by releasing it and allowing some external force, usually gravity, to pull it out of the body). The erasers (sometimes replaced by a sharpener on pencils with larger lead sizes) are also removable (and thus replaceable), and usually cover a place to store replacement leads. Mechanical pencils are popular for their longevity and the fact that they may never need sharpening. Lead types are based on grade and size; with standard sizes being , , , , , , , , and (http://)\u2014the size is available, but is not considered a standard ISO size.\nPop a Point.\nPioneered by Taiwanese stationery manufacturer Bensia Pioneer Industrial Corporation in the early 1970s, Pop a Point Pencils are also known as Bensia Pencils, stackable pencils or non-sharpening pencils. It is a type of pencil where many short pencil tips are housed in a cartridge-style plastic holder. A blunt tip is removed by pulling it from the writing end of the body and re-inserting it into the open-ended bottom of the body, thereby pushing a new tip to the top.\nPlastic.\nInvented by Harold Grossman for the Empire Pencil Company in 1967, plastic pencils were subsequently improved upon by Arthur D. Little for Empire from 1969 through the early 1970s; the plastic pencil was commercialised by Empire as the \"EPCON\" Pencil. These pencils were co-extruded, extruding a plasticised graphite mix within a wood-composite core.\nHealth.\nResidual graphite from a pencil stick is not poisonous, and graphite is harmless if consumed.\nAlthough lead has not been used for writing since antiquity, such as in Roman styli, lead poisoning from pencils was not uncommon. Until the middle of the 20th century the paint used for the outer coating could contain high concentrations of lead, and this could be ingested when the pencil was sucked or chewed.\nManufacture.\nThe lead of the pencil is a mix of finely ground graphite and clay powders. Before the two substances are mixed, they are separately cleaned of foreign matter and dried in a manner that creates large square cakes. Once the cakes have fully dried, the graphite and the clay squares are mixed together using water. The amount of clay content added to the graphite depends on the intended pencil hardness (lower proportions of clay makes the core softer), and the amount of time spent on grinding the mixture determines the quality of the lead. The mixture is then shaped into long spaghetti-like strings, straightened, dried, cut, and then tempered in a kiln. The resulting strings are dipped in oil or molten wax, which seeps into the tiny holes of the material and allows for the smooth writing ability of the pencil. A juniper or incense-cedar plank with several long parallel grooves is cut to fashion a \"slat,\" and the graphite/clay strings are inserted into the grooves. Another grooved plank is glued on top, and the whole assembly is then cut into individual pencils, which are then varnished or painted. Many pencils feature an eraser on the top and so the process is usually still considered incomplete at this point. Each pencil has a shoulder cut on one end of the pencil to allow for a metal ferrule to be secured onto the wood. A rubber plug is then inserted into the ferrule for a functioning eraser on the end of the pencil.\nGrading and classification.\nGraphite pencils are made of a mixture of clay and graphite and their darkness varies from black to light grey. A higher amount of clay added to the pencil makes it harder, leaving lighter marks. There is a wide range of grades available, mainly for artists who are interested in creating a full range of tones from light grey to black. Engineers prefer harder pencils which allow for a greater control in the shape of the lead.\nManufacturers distinguish their pencils by grading them, but there is no common standard. Two pencils of the same grade but different manufacturers will not necessarily make a mark of identical tone nor have the same hardness.\nMost manufacturers, and almost all in Europe, designate their pencils with the letters \"H\" (commonly interpreted as \"hardness\") to \"B\" (commonly \"blackness\"), as well as \"F\" (usually taken to mean \"fineness\", although F pencils are no more fine or more easily sharpened than any other grade. Also referred to as \"firm\" by many manufacturers). The standard writing pencil is graded \"HB\". This designation, in the form \"H.\u00a0B.\", was in use at least as early as 1814. Softer or harder pencil grades were described by a sequence or successive Bs or Hs such as \"BB\" and \"BBB\" for successively softer leads, and \"HH\" and \"HHH\" for successively harder ones. The Koh-i-Noor Hardtmuth pencil manufacturers claim to have first used the HB designations, with \"H\" standing for Hardtmuth, \"B\" for the company's location of Bud\u011bjovice, and \"F\" for Franz Hardtmuth, who was responsible for technological improvements in pencil manufacture.\nAs of 2021[ [update]], a set of pencils ranging from a very soft, black-marking pencil to a very hard, light-marking pencil usually ranges from softest to hardest as follows:\nKoh-i-noor offers twenty grades from 10H to 8B for its 1500 series. Mitsubishi Pencil offers twenty-two grades from 10H to 10B for its Hi-uni range. Derwent produces twenty grades from 9H to 9B for its graphic pencils. Staedtler produces 24 from 10H to 12B for its Mars Lumograph pencils.\nNumbers as designation were first used by Cont\u00e9 and later by John Thoreau, father of Henry David Thoreau, in the 19th century.\nAlthough Cont\u00e9/Thoreau's equivalence table is widely accepted, not all manufacturers follow it; for example, Faber-Castell uses a different equivalence table in its \"Grip 2001\" pencils: 1 = 2B, 2 = B, 2\u00bd = HB, 3 = H, 4 = 2H.\nHardness test.\nGraded pencils can be used for a rapid test that provides relative ratings for a series of coated panels but cannot be used to compare the pencil hardness of different coatings. This test defines a \"pencil hardness\" of a coating as the grade of the hardest pencil that does not permanently mark the coating when pressed firmly against it at a 45 degree angle. For standardized measurements, there are Mohs hardness testing pencils on the market. \nExternal colour and shape.\nThe majority of pencils made in the US are painted yellow. According to Henry Petroski, this tradition began in 1890 when the L. &amp; C. Hardtmuth Company of Austria-Hungary introduced their Koh-I-Noor brand, named after the famous diamond. It was intended to be the world's best and most expensive pencil, as the end of the pencil was dipped in 14-carat gold; and at a time when most pencils were either painted in dark colours or not painted at all, the Koh-I-Noor was yellow.\nAs well as simply being distinctive, the colour may have been inspired by the Austro-Hungarian flag; it was also suggestive of the Orient at a time when the best-quality graphite came from Siberia. Other companies then copied the yellow colour so that their pencils would be associated with this high-quality brand, and chose brand names with explicit Oriental references, such as Mikado (renamed Mirado) and Mongol.\nNot all countries use yellow pencils. German and Brazilian pencils, for example, are often green, blue or black, based on the trademark colours of Faber-Castell, a major German stationery company which has plants in those countries. In southern European countries, pencils tend to be dark red or black with yellow lines, while in Australia, they are red with black bands at one end. In India, the most common pencil colour scheme was dark red with black lines, and pencils with a large number of colour schemes are produced.\nPencils are commonly round, hexagonal, or sometimes triangular in section. Carpenters' pencils are typically oval or rectangular, so they cannot easily roll away during work.\nManufacturers.\nProminent global manufacturers of wood-cased (including wood-free) pencils:\nIn New Zealand Faber-Castell is pretty popular.\nIn Australia the most popular is either Faber-Castell or Staedtler\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He shared one half of the 1903 Nobel Prize in Physics with his wife, Marie Curie, for their work on radioactivity. With their win, the Curies became the first married couple to win a Nobel Prize, launching the Curie family legacy of five Nobel Prizes.\nEducation and career.\nPierre Curie was born on 15 May 1859 in Paris, France, the son of Eug\u00e8ne Curie (1827\u20131910), a doctor of Huguenot origin from Alsace, and Sophie-Claire Depouilly (1832\u20131897). He was educated by his father, and in his early teens showed a strong aptitude for mathematics and geometry.\nIn 1878, Curie earned his License in Physics from the Faculty of Sciences at the Sorbonne, and he worked as a laboratory demonstrator until 1882, when he joined the faculty at ESPCI Paris.\nIn 1895, Curie received his D.Sc. from the Sorbonne and was appointed Professor of Physics. The submission material for his doctorate consisted of his research on magnetism. In 1900, he was promoted to Professor in the Faculty of Sciences, and in 1904 became Titular Professor.\nResearch.\nPiezoelectricity.\nIn 1880, Pierre and his older brother, Jacques, demonstrated that an electric potential was generated when crystals were compressed, i.e. piezoelectricity. To aid this work, they invented the piezoelectric quartz electrometer. In 1881, they demonstrated the reverse effect; that crystals could be made to deform when subject to an electric field. Almost all digital electronic circuits now rely on this in the form of crystal oscillators. In subsequent work on magnetism, he defined the Curie scale. This work also involved delicate equipment \u2013 balances, electrometers, etc.\nMagnetism.\nBefore his famous doctoral studies on magnetism, Curie designed and perfected an extremely sensitive torsion balance for measuring magnetic coefficients. Variations on this equipment were commonly used by future workers in that area. He studied ferromagnetism, paramagnetism, and diamagnetism for his doctoral thesis, and discovered the effect of temperature on paramagnetism which is now known as Curie's law. The material constant in Curie's law is known as the Curie constant. He also discovered that ferromagnetic substances exhibited a critical temperature transition, above which the substances lost their ferromagnetic behavior. This is now known as the Curie temperature. The Curie temperature is used to study plate tectonics, treat hypothermia, measure caffeine, and to understand extraterrestrial magnetic fields. The curie is a unit of measurement (3.7\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01010 decays per second or 37 gigabecquerels) used to describe the intensity of a sample of radioactive material and was named after Marie and Pierre Curie by the Radiology Congress in 1910.\nCurie's principle.\nCurie formulated what is now known as the Curie Dissymmetry Principle: a physical effect cannot have a dissymmetry absent from its efficient cause. For example, a random mixture of sand in zero gravity has no dissymmetry (it is isotropic). Introduce a gravitational field, and there is a dissymmetry because of the direction of the field. Then the sand grains can 'self-sort' with the density increasing with depth. But this new arrangement, with the directional arrangement of sand grains, actually reflects the dissymmetry of the gravitational field that causes the separation.\nRadioactivity.\nCurie worked with his wife in isolating polonium and radium. They were the first to use the term \"radioactivity\", and were pioneers in its study. Their work, including Marie Curie's celebrated doctoral work, made use of a sensitive piezoelectric electrometer constructed by Pierre and his brother Jacques Curie. Curie's 26 December 1898 publication with his wife and M. G. B\u00e9mont for their discovery of radium and polonium was honored by a Citation for Chemical Breakthrough Award from the Division of History of Chemistry of the American Chemical Society presented to the ESPCI ParisTech (officially the ) in 2015. In 1903, to honor the Curies' work, the Royal Society invited Pierre to present their research. Marie was not permitted to give the lecture, so Lord Kelvin sat beside her while Pierre spoke on their research. After this, Kelvin held a luncheon for Pierre. While in London, Pierre and Marie were awarded the Davy Medal of the Royal Society. In 1903, Pierre and Marie Curie, as well as Henri Becquerel, were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for their research on radioactivity.\nCurie and one of his students, Albert Laborde, made the first discovery of nuclear energy, by identifying the continuous emission of heat from radium particles. Curie also investigated the radiation emissions of radioactive substances, and through the use of magnetic fields was able to show that some of the emissions were positively charged, some were negative and some were neutral. These correspond to alpha, beta, and gamma radiation.\nSpiritualism.\nIn the late nineteenth century, Curie was investigating the mysteries of ordinary magnetism when he became aware of the spiritualist experiments of other French scientists, such as Charles Richet and Camille Flammarion. He initially thought the systematic investigation into the paranormal could help with some unanswered questions about magnetism. He wrote to Marie, then his fianc\u00e9e: \"I must admit that those spiritual phenomena intensely interest me. I think they are questions that deal with physics.\" Pierre Curie's notebooks from this period show he read many books on spiritualism. He did not attend s\u00e9ances such as those of Eusapia Palladino in Paris in June 1905 as a mere spectator, and his goal certainly was not to communicate with spirits. He saw the s\u00e9ances as scientific experiments, tried to monitor different parameters, and took detailed notes of every observation. Curie considered himself an atheist.\nFamily.\nPierre Curie's grandfather, Paul Curie (1799\u20131853), a doctor of medicine, was a committed Malthusian humanist and married Augustine Hofer, daughter of Jean Hofer and great-granddaughter of Jean-Henri Dollfus, great industrialists from Mulhouse in the second half of the 18th century and the first part of the 19th century.\nThrough this paternal grandmother, Pierre Curie is also a direct descendant of the Basel scientist and mathematician Jean Bernoulli (1667\u20131748), as is Pierre-Gilles de Gennes, winner of the 1991 Nobel Prize in Physics.\nCurie was introduced to Maria Sk\u0142odowska by their friend, physicist J\u00f3zef Wierusz-Kowalski. Curie took her into his laboratory as his student. His admiration for her grew when he realised that she would not inhibit his research. He began to regard Sk\u0142odowska as his muse. She refused his initial proposal, but finally agreed to marry him on 26 July 1895.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The Curies had a happy, affectionate marriage, and they were known for their devotion to each other.\nPierre and Marie Curie's daughter, Ir\u00e8ne, and their son-in-law, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Joliot-Curie, were also physicists involved in the study of radioactivity, and each also received Nobel prizes for their work. The Curies' other daughter, \u00c8ve, wrote a noted biography of her mother. She was the only member of the Curie family to not become a physicist. \u00c8ve married Henry Richardson Labouisse Jr., who received a Nobel Peace Prize on behalf of UNICEF in 1965. Pierre and Marie Curie's granddaughter, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Langevin-Joliot, is a professor of nuclear physics at the University of Paris, and their grandson, Pierre Joliot, who was named after Pierre Curie, is a noted biochemist.\nDeath.\nOn 19 April 1906, while crossing the busy Rue Dauphine in the rain at the Quai de Conti, Curie slipped and fell under a heavy horse-drawn cart; one of the wheels ran over his head, fracturing his skull and killing him instantly.\nBoth the Curies experienced radium burns, both accidentally and voluntarily, and were exposed to extensive doses of radiation while conducting their research. They experienced radiation sickness and Marie Curie died from radiation-induced aplastic anemia in 1934. Even now, all their papers from the 1890s, even her cookbooks, are radioactive. Their laboratory books are kept in special lead boxes and people who want to see them have to wear protective clothing. Most of these items can be found at the . Had Pierre Curie not died in an accident, he would most likely have eventually died of the effects of radiation, as did his wife; their daughter, Ir\u00e8ne; and her husband, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Joliot.\nIn April 1995, Pierre and Marie Curie were moved from their original resting place, a family cemetery, and enshrined in the crypt of the Panth\u00e9on in Paris.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

They are more capable than finite-state machines but less capable than Turing machines (see below).\nDeterministic pushdown automata can recognize all deterministic context-free languages while nondeterministic ones can recognize all context-free languages, with the former often used in parser design.\nThe term \"pushdown\" refers to the fact that the stack can be regarded as being \"pushed down\" like a tray dispenser at a cafeteria, since the operations never work on elements other than the top element. A stack automaton, by contrast, does allow access to and operations on deeper elements. Stack automata can recognize a strictly larger set of languages than pushdown automata.\nA nested stack automaton allows full access, and also allows stacked values to be entire sub-stacks rather than just single finite symbols.\nInformal description.\nA finite-state machine only considers the input signal and the current state: it has no stack to work with and therefore is unable to access previous values of the input. It can only choose a new state, the result of following the transition. A pushdown automaton (PDA) differs from a finite state machine in two ways:\nA pushdown automaton reads a given input string from left to right. In each step, it chooses a transition by indexing a table by input symbol, current state, and the symbol at the top of the stack. A pushdown automaton can also manipulate the stack, as part of performing a transition. The manipulation can be to push a particular symbol to the top of the stack, or to pop off the top of the stack. The automaton can alternatively ignore the stack, and leave it as it is. \nPut together: Given an input symbol, current state, and stack symbol, the automaton can follow a transition to another state, and optionally manipulate (push or pop) the stack.\nIf, in every situation, at most one such transition action is possible, then the automaton is called a deterministic pushdown automaton (DPDA). In general, if several actions are possible, then the automaton is called a general, or nondeterministic, PDA. A given input string may drive a nondeterministic pushdown automaton to one of several configuration sequences; if one of them leads to an accepting configuration after reading the complete input string, the latter is said to belong to the \"language accepted by the automaton\".\nFormal definition.\nWe use standard formal language notation: formula_1 denotes the set of finite-length strings over alphabet formula_2 and formula_3 denotes the empty string.\nA PDA is formally defined as a 7-tuple:\nformula_4\nwhere\nAn element formula_13 is a transition of formula_14. It has the intended meaning that formula_14, in state formula_16, on the input formula_17 and with formula_18 as topmost stack symbol, may read formula_19, change the state to formula_20, pop formula_21, replacing it by pushing formula_22. The formula_23 component of the transition relation is used to formalize that the PDA can either read a letter from the input, or proceed leaving the input untouched.\nIn many texts the transition relation is replaced by an (equivalent) formalization, where\nHere formula_27 contains all possible actions in state formula_28 with formula_21 on the stack, while reading formula_19 on the input. One writes for example formula_31 precisely when formula_32 because formula_33. Note that \"finite\" in this definition is essential.\nComputations.\nIn order to formalize the semantics of the pushdown automaton, a description of the current situation is introduced. Any 3-tuple formula_34 is called an \"instantaneous description\" (ID) of formula_14, which includes the current state, the part of the input tape that has not been read, and the contents of the stack (top-most symbol written first). The transition relation formula_8 defines the step-relation formula_37 of formula_14 on instantaneous descriptions. For instruction formula_13 there exists a step formula_40, for every formula_41 and every formula_42.\nIn general, pushdown automata are nondeterministic, meaning that in a given instantaneous description formula_43 there may be several possible steps. Any of these steps can be chosen in a computation.\nWith the above definition, in each step a single symbol (top of the stack) is always popped, and replaced with as many symbols as necessary. As a consequence, no step is defined when the stack is empty.\nComputations of the pushdown automaton are sequences of steps. The computation starts in the initial state formula_44 with the initial stack symbol formula_45 on the stack, and a string formula_46 on the input tape\u2014thus, with initial description formula_47.\nThere are two modes of accepting. The pushdown automaton either accepts by final state, which means that after reading its input the automaton reaches an accepting state (in formula_48), or else it accepts by empty stack (formula_3), which means that after reading its input the automaton empties its stack. The first acceptance mode uses the internal memory (state), the second the external memory (stack).\nFormally one defines\nHere formula_55 represents the reflexive and transitive closure of the step relation formula_56, meaning any number of consecutive steps (zero, one or more).\nFor each single pushdown automaton, these two languages need have no relation; they may be equal, but usually this is not the case. A specification of the automaton should also include the intended mode of acceptance. Taken over all pushdown automata, both acceptance conditions define the same family of languages.\nTheorem. For each pushdown automaton formula_14 one may construct a pushdown automaton formula_58 such that formula_59, and vice versa, for each pushdown automaton formula_14 one may construct a pushdown automaton formula_58 such that formula_62\nExample.\nThe following is the formal description of the PDA which recognizes the language formula_63 by final state:\nformula_64, where\nThe transition relation formula_8 consists of the following six instructions:\nformula_71,\nformula_72,\nformula_73,\nformula_74,\nformula_75, and\nformula_76.\nIn words, the first two instructions say that in state p any time the symbol is read, one A is pushed onto the stack. Pushing symbol A on top of another A is formalized as replacing top A by AA (and similarly for pushing symbol A on top of a Z).\nThe third and fourth instructions say that, at any moment the automaton may move from state p to state q.\nThe fifth instruction says that in state q, for each symbol read, one A is popped.\nFinally, the sixth instruction says that the machine may move from state q to accepting state r only when the stack consists of a single Z.\nThere seems to be no generally used representation for PDA. Here we have depicted the instruction formula_77 by an edge from state p to state q labelled by formula_78 (read a; replace A by formula_79).\nExplanation.\nThe following illustrates how the above PDA computes on different input strings. The subscript M from the step symbol formula_80 is here omitted.\nContext-free languages.\nEvery context-free grammar can be transformed into an equivalent nondeterministic pushdown automaton. The derivation process of the grammar is simulated in a leftmost way. Where the grammar rewrites a nonterminal, the PDA takes the topmost nonterminal from its stack and replaces it by the right-hand part of a grammatical rule (\"expand\"). Where the grammar generates a terminal symbol, the PDA reads a symbol from input when it is the topmost symbol on the stack (\"match\"). In a sense the stack of the PDA contains the unprocessed data of the grammar, corresponding to a pre-order traversal of a derivation tree.\nTechnically, given a context-free grammar, the PDA has a single state, 1, and its transition relation is constructed as follows.\nThe PDA accepts by empty stack. Its initial stack symbol is the grammar's start symbol.\nFor a context-free grammar in Greibach normal form, defining (1,\u03b3) \u2208 \u03b4(1,\"a\",\"A\") for each grammar rule \"A\" \u2192 \"a\"\u03b3 also yields an equivalent nondeterministic pushdown automaton.\nThe converse, finding a grammar for a given PDA, is not that easy. The trick is to code two states of the PDA into the nonterminals of the grammar.\nTheorem. For each pushdown automaton formula_14 one may construct a context-free grammar formula_86 such that \nThe language of strings accepted by a deterministic pushdown automaton (DPDA) is called a deterministic context-free language. Not all context-free languages are deterministic. As a consequence, the DPDA is a strictly weaker variant of the PDA. Even for regular languages, there is a size explosion problem: for any recursive function formula_87 and for arbitrarily large integers formula_88, there is a PDA of size formula_88 describing a regular language whose smallest DPDA has at least formula_90 states. For many non-regular PDAs, any equivalent DPDA would require an unbounded number of states.\nA finite automaton with access to two stacks is a more powerful device, equivalent in power to a Turing machine. A linear bounded automaton is a device which is more powerful than a pushdown automaton but less so than a Turing machine.\nTuring machines.\nA pushdown automaton is computationally equivalent to a \"restricted\" Turing Machine (TM) with two tapes, which is restricted in the following manner. On the first tape, the TM can only read the input and move from left to right (i.e., it cannot make changes). On the second tape, it can only \"push\" and \"pop\" data; i.e., the TM can read, write, and move left and right on the second tape, with the restriction that the only action it can perform at each step is to either delete the left-most character in the string (pop) or add an extra character left to the left-most character in the string (push).\nThat a PDA is weaker than a TM can be boiled down to the fact that the \"pop\" procedure deletes some data. In order to make a PDA as strong as a TM, we need to save this lost data somewhere; this can be achieved by introducing a second stack. In the aforementioned TM model of pushdown automata, this is equivalent to a TM with \"three\" tapes, wherein the first tape is the read-only input tape, and both the second and third tapes are \"push\" and \"pop\" (stack) tapes. In order for such a PDA to simulate any given TM, we give the input of the PDA to the first tape, while keeping both the stacks empty; it then goes on to push all the input from the input tape onto the first stack. When the entire input is transferred to the first stack, operation proceeds as in a normal TM: moving right on the tape is the same as popping a symbol from the first stack and pushing a (possibly updated) symbol onto the second stack, and moving left corresponds to popping a symbol from the second stack and pushing a (possibly updated) symbol onto the first stack\u2014hence, we now have a two-stack PDA that can simulate any TM.\nGeneralization.\nA generalized pushdown automaton (GPDA) is a PDA that writes an entire string of some known length to the stack or removes an entire string from the stack in one step.\nA GPDA is formally defined as a 6-tuple: \nformula_91\nwhere formula_92, and &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; are defined the same way as a PDA.\nformula_93: formula_94\nis the transition function.\nComputation rules for a GPDA are the same as a PDA except that the formula_95's and formula_96's are now strings instead of symbols.\nPushdown automata and generalized pushdown automata are equivalent in that if a language is recognized by a PDA, it is also recognized by a GPDA, and vice versa.\nOne can formulate an analytic proof for the equivalence of pushdown automata and generalized pushdown automata using the following simulation:\nLet formula_97 be a transition of the GPDA, where:\nformula_98\nConstruct the following transitions for the PDA:\nformula_99\nStack automata.\nAs a generalization of pushdown automata, Ginsburg, Greibach, and Harrison (1967) investigated stack automata, which may additionally step left or right in the input string (surrounded by special endmarker symbols to prevent slipping out), and step up or down in the stack in read-only mode. \nA stack automaton is called \"nonerasing\" if it never pops from the stack. The class of languages accepted by nondeterministic, nonerasing stack automata is \"NSPACE\"(\"n\"2), which is a superset of the context-sensitive languages. The class of languages accepted by deterministic, nonerasing stack automata is \"DSPACE\"(\"n\"\u22c5log(\"n\")).\nAlternating pushdown automata.\nAn alternating pushdown automaton (APDA) is a pushdown automaton with a state set\nStates in formula_102 and formula_103 are called \"existential\" resp. \"universal\". In an existential state an APDA nondeterministically chooses the next state and accepts if \"at least one\" of the resulting computations accepts. In a universal state APDA moves to all next states and accepts if \"all\" the resulting computations accept.\nThe model was introduced by Chandra, Kozen and Stockmeyer. Ladner, Lipton and Stockmeyer proved that this model is equivalent to EXPTIME i.e. a language is accepted by some APDA if, and only if, it can be decided by an exponential-time algorithm.\nAizikowitz and Kaminski introduced \"synchronized alternating pushdown automata\" (SAPDA) that are equivalent to conjunctive grammars in the same way as nondeterministic PDA are equivalent to context-free grammars.\nCitations.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

By convention, the primary structure of a protein is reported starting from the amino-terminal (N) end to the carboxyl-terminal (C) end. Protein biosynthesis is most commonly performed by ribosomes in cells. Peptides can also be synthesized in the laboratory. Protein primary structures can be directly sequenced, or inferred from DNA sequences.\nFormation.\nBiological.\nAmino acids are polymerised via peptide bonds to form a long backbone, with the different amino acid side chains protruding along it. In biological systems, proteins are produced during translation by a cell's ribosomes. Some organisms can also make short peptides by non-ribosomal peptide synthesis, which often use amino acids other than the encoded 22, and may be cyclised, modified and cross-linked.\nChemical.\nPeptides can be synthesised chemically via a range of laboratory methods. Chemical methods typically synthesise peptides in the opposite order (starting at the C-terminus) to biological protein synthesis (starting at the N-terminus).\nNotation.\nProtein sequence is typically notated as a string of letters, listing the amino acids starting at the amino-terminal end through to the carboxyl-terminal end. Either a three letter code or single letter code can be used to represent the 22 naturally encoded amino acids, as well as mixtures or ambiguous amino acids (similar to nucleic acid notation).\nPeptides can be directly sequenced, or inferred from DNA sequences. Large sequence databases now exist that collate known protein sequences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-float/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-float/styles.css\" /&gt;\nModification.\nIn general, polypeptides are unbranched polymers, so their primary structure can often be specified by the sequence of amino acids along their backbone. However, proteins can become cross-linked, most commonly by disulfide bonds, and the primary structure also requires specifying the cross-linking atoms, e.g., specifying the cysteines involved in the protein's disulfide bonds. Other crosslinks include desmosine.\nIsomerisation.\nThe chiral centers of a polypeptide chain can undergo racemization. Although it does not change the sequence, it does affect the chemical properties of the sequence. In particular, the -amino acids normally found in proteins can spontaneously isomerize at the formula_1 atom to form -amino acids, which cannot be cleaved by most proteases. Additionally, proline can form stable trans-isomers at the peptide bond.\nPost-translational modification.\nAdditionally, the protein can undergo a variety of post-translational modifications, which are briefly summarized here.\nThe N-terminal amino group of a polypeptide can be modified covalently, e.g.,\nThe positive charge on the N-terminal amino group may be eliminated by changing it to an acetyl group (N-terminal blocking).\nThe N-terminal methionine usually found after translation has an N-terminus blocked with a formyl group. This formyl group (and sometimes the methionine residue itself, if followed by Gly or Ser) is removed by the enzyme deformylase.\nAn N-terminal glutamine can attack itself, forming a cyclic pyroglutamate group.\nSimilar to acetylation. Instead of a simple methyl group, the myristoyl group has a tail of 14 hydrophobic carbons, which make it ideal for anchoring proteins to cellular membranes.\nThe C-terminal carboxylate group of a polypeptide can also be modified, e.g.,\nThe C-terminus can also be blocked (thus, neutralizing its negative charge) by amination.\nGlycosyl phosphatidylinositol(GPI) is a large, hydrophobic phospholipid prosthetic group that anchors proteins to cellular membranes. It is attached to the polypeptide C-terminus through an amide linkage that then connects to ethanolamine, thence to sundry sugars and finally to the phosphatidylinositol lipid moiety.\nFinally, the peptide side chains can also be modified covalently, e.g.,\nAside from cleavage, phosphorylation is perhaps the most important chemical modification of proteins. A phosphate group can be attached to the sidechain hydroxyl group of serine, threonine and tyrosine residues, adding a negative charge at that site and producing an unnatural amino acid. Such reactions are catalyzed by kinases and the reverse reaction is catalyzed by phosphatases. The phosphorylated tyrosines are often used as \"handles\" by which proteins can bind to one another, whereas phosphorylation of Ser/Thr often induces conformational changes, presumably because of the introduced negative charge. The effects of phosphorylating Ser/Thr can sometimes be simulated by mutating the Ser/Thr residue to glutamate.\nA catch-all name for a set of very common and very heterogeneous chemical modifications. Sugar moieties can be attached to the sidechain hydroxyl groups of Ser/Thr or to the sidechain amide groups of Asn. Such attachments can serve many functions, ranging from increasing solubility to complex recognition. All glycosylation can be blocked with certain inhibitors, such as tunicamycin.\nIn this modification, an asparagine or aspartate side chain attacks the following peptide bond, forming a symmetrical succinimide intermediate. Hydrolysis of the intermediate produces either aspartate or the \u03b2-amino acid, iso(Asp). For asparagine, either product results in the loss of the amide group, hence \"deamidation\".\n Proline residues may be hydroxylated at either of two atoms, as can lysine (at one atom). Hydroxyproline is a critical component of collagen, which becomes unstable upon its loss. The hydroxylation reaction is catalyzed by an enzyme that requires ascorbic acid (vitamin C), deficiencies in which lead to many connective-tissue diseases such as scurvy.\n Several protein residues can be methylated, most notably the positive groups of lysine and arginine. Arginine residues interact with the nucleic acid phosphate backbone and commonly form hydrogen bonds with the base residues, particularly guanine, in protein\u2013DNA complexes. Lysine residues can be singly, doubly and even triply methylated. Methylation does \"not\" alter the positive charge on the side chain, however.\n Acetylation of the lysine amino groups is chemically analogous to the acetylation of the N-terminus. Functionally, however, the acetylation of lysine residues is used to regulate the binding of proteins to nucleic acids. The cancellation of the positive charge on the lysine weakens the electrostatic attraction for the (negatively charged) nucleic acids.\n Tyrosines may become sulfated on their formula_5 atom. Somewhat unusually, this modification occurs in the Golgi apparatus, not in the endoplasmic reticulum. Similar to phosphorylated tyrosines, sulfated tyrosines are used for specific recognition, e.g., in chemokine receptors on the cell surface. As with phosphorylation, sulfation adds a negative charge to a previously neutral site.\n The hydrophobic isoprene (e.g., farnesyl, geranyl, and geranylgeranyl groups) and palmitoyl groups may be added to the formula_7 atom of cysteine residues to anchor proteins to cellular membranes. Unlike the GPI and myritoyl anchors, these groups are not necessarily added at the termini.\n A relatively rare modification that adds an extra carboxylate group (and, hence, a double negative charge) to a glutamate side chain, producing a Gla residue. This is used to strengthen the binding to \"hard\" metal ions such as calcium.\n The large ADP-ribosyl group can be transferred to several types of side chains within proteins, with heterogeneous effects. This modification is a target for the powerful toxins of disparate bacteria, e.g., \"Vibrio cholerae\", \"Corynebacterium diphtheriae\" and \"Bordetella pertussis\".\n Various full-length, folded proteins can be attached at their C-termini to the sidechain ammonium groups of lysines of other proteins. Ubiquitin is the most common of these, and usually signals that the ubiquitin-tagged protein should be degraded.\nMost of the polypeptide modifications listed above occur \"post-translationally\", i.e., after the protein has been synthesized on the ribosome, typically occurring in the endoplasmic reticulum, a subcellular organelle of the eukaryotic cell.\nMany other chemical reactions (e.g., cyanylation) have been applied to proteins by chemists, although they are not found in biological systems.\nCleavage and ligation.\nIn addition to those listed above, the most important modification of primary structure is peptide cleavage (by chemical hydrolysis or by proteases). Proteins are often synthesized in an inactive precursor form; typically, an N-terminal or C-terminal segment blocks the active site of the protein, inhibiting its function. The protein is activated by cleaving off the inhibitory peptide.\nSome proteins even have the power to cleave themselves. Typically, the hydroxyl group of a serine (rarely, threonine) or the thiol group of a cysteine residue will attack the carbonyl carbon of the preceding peptide bond, forming a tetrahedrally bonded intermediate [classified as a hydroxyoxazolidine (Ser/Thr) or hydroxythiazolidine (Cys) intermediate]. This intermediate tends to revert to the amide form, expelling the attacking group, since the amide form is usually favored by free energy, (presumably due to the strong resonance stabilization of the peptide group). However, additional molecular interactions may render the amide form less stable; the amino group is expelled instead, resulting in an ester (Ser/Thr) or thioester (Cys) bond in place of the peptide bond. This chemical reaction is called an N-O acyl shift.\nThe ester/thioester bond can be resolved in several ways:\nHistory.\nThe proposal that proteins were linear chains of \u03b1-amino acids was made nearly simultaneously by two scientists at the same conference in 1902, the 74th meeting of the Society of German Scientists and Physicians, held in Karlsbad. Franz Hofmeister made the proposal in the morning, based on his observations of the biuret reaction in proteins. Hofmeister was followed a few hours later by Emil Fischer, who had amassed a wealth of chemical details supporting the peptide-bond model. For completeness, the proposal that proteins contained amide linkages was made as early as 1882 by the French chemist E. Grimaux.\nDespite these data and later evidence that proteolytically digested proteins yielded only oligopeptides, the idea that proteins were linear, unbranched polymers of amino acids was not accepted immediately. Some scientists such as William Astbury doubted that covalent bonds were strong enough to hold such long molecules together; they feared that thermal agitations would shake such long molecules asunder. Hermann Staudinger faced similar prejudices in the 1920s when he argued that rubber was composed of macromolecules.\nThus, several alternative hypotheses arose. The colloidal protein hypothesis stated that proteins were colloidal assemblies of smaller molecules. This hypothesis was disproved in the 1920s by ultracentrifugation measurements by Theodor Svedberg that showed that proteins had a well-defined, reproducible molecular weight and by electrophoretic measurements by Arne Tiselius that indicated that proteins were single molecules. A second hypothesis, the cyclol hypothesis advanced by Dorothy Wrinch, proposed that the linear polypeptide underwent a chemical cyclol rearrangement C=O + HN formula_8 C(OH)-N that crosslinked its backbone amide groups, forming a two-dimensional \"fabric\". Other primary structures of proteins were proposed by various researchers, such as the diketopiperazine model of Emil Abderhalden and the pyrrol/piperidine model of Troensegaard in 1942. Although never given much credence, these alternative models were finally disproved when Frederick Sanger successfully sequenced insulin and by the crystallographic determination of myoglobin and hemoglobin by Max Perutz and John Kendrew.\nRelation to secondary and tertiary structure.\nThe primary structure of a biological polymer to a large extent determines the three-dimensional shape (tertiary structure). Protein sequence can be used to predict local features, such as segments of secondary structure, or trans-membrane regions. However, the complexity of protein folding currently prohibits predicting the tertiary structure of a protein from its sequence alone. Knowing the structure of a similar homologous sequence (for example a member of the same protein family) allows highly accurate prediction of the tertiary structure by homology modeling. If the full-length protein sequence is available, it is possible to estimate its general biophysical properties, such as its isoelectric point.\nNotes and references.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "24512", "revid": "173996", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24512", "title": "Peter principle", "text": "Management concept by Laurence J. Peter\nThe Peter principle is a concept in management developed by Laurence J. Peter which observes that people in a hierarchy tend to rise to \"a level of respective incompetence\": employees are promoted based on their success in previous jobs until they reach a level at which they are no longer competent, as skills in one job do not necessarily translate to another.\nThe concept was explained in the 1969 book \"The Peter Principle\" (William Morrow and Company) by Laurence Peter and Raymond Hull. Hull wrote the text, which was based on Peter's research. Peter and Hull intended the book to be satire, but it became popular as it was seen to make a serious point about the shortcomings of how people are promoted within hierarchical organizations. The Peter principle has since been the subject of much commentary and research.\nSummary.\nThe Peter principle states that a person who is competent at their job will earn a promotion to a position that requires different skills. If the promoted person lacks the skills required for the new role, they will be incompetent at the new level, and will not be promoted again. If the person is competent in the new role, they will be promoted again and will continue to be promoted until reaching a level at which they are incompetent. Being incompetent, the individual will not qualify for promotion again, and so will remain stuck at this \"final placement\" or \"Peter's plateau\".\nThis outcome is inevitable, given enough time and enough positions in the hierarchy to which competent employees may be promoted. The Peter principle is therefore expressed as: \"In a hierarchy, every employee tends to rise to his level of incompetence.\" This leads to Peter's corollary: \"In time, every post tends to be occupied by an employee who is incompetent to carry out its duties.\" Hull calls the study of how hierarchies work \"hierarchiology\".\n\"The Peter Principle\".\nLaurence J. Peter's research led to the formulation of the Peter Principle well before publishing his findings.\nEventually, to elucidate his observations about hierarchies, Peter worked with Raymond Hull to develop a book, \"The Peter Principle\", which was published by William Morrow and Company in 1969. As such, the principle is named for Peter because, although Hull actually wrote almost all of the book's text, it is a summary of Peter's research.\nSummary.\nIn the first two chapters, Peter and Hull give various examples of the Peter principle in action. In each case, the higher position required skills that were not required at the level immediately below. For example, a competent school teacher may make a competent assistant principal, but then go on to be an incompetent principal. The teacher was competent at educating children, and as assistant principal, he was good at dealing with parents and other teachers, but as principal, he was poor at maintaining good relations with the school board and the superintendent.\nIn chapter 3, Peter and Hull discuss apparent exceptions to this principle and then debunk them. One of these illusory exceptions is when someone who is incompetent is still promoted anyway\u2014they coin the phrase \"percussive sublimation\" for this phenomenon of being \"kicked upstairs\" (cf. Dilbert principle). However, it is only a pseudo-promotion: a move from one unproductive position to another. This improves staff morale, as other employees believe that they too can be promoted again. Another pseudo-promotion is the \"lateral arabesque\": when a person is moved out of the way and given a longer job title.\nWhile incompetence is merely a barrier to further promotion, \"super-\"incompetence\"\" is grounds for dismissal, as is \"super-\"competence\"\". In both cases, \"they tend to disrupt the hierarchy.\" One specific example of a super-competent employee is a teacher of children with special needs: they were so effective at educating the children that, after a year, they exceeded all expectations at reading and arithmetic, but the teacher was still fired because they had neglected to devote enough time to bead-stringing and finger-painting.\nChapters 4 and 5 deal with the two methods of achieving promotion: \"push\" and \"pull\". \"Push\" refers to the employee's own efforts, such as working hard and taking courses for self-improvement. This is usually not very effective due to the seniority factor: the next level up is often fully occupied, blocking the path to promotion. \"Pull\", on the other hand, is far more effective and refers to accelerated promotion brought about by the efforts of an employee's mentors or patrons.\nChapter 6 explains why \"good followers do not become good leaders.\" In chapter 7, Peter and Hull describe the effect of the Peter principle in politics and government. Chapter 8, titled \"Hints and Foreshadowings\", discusses the work of earlier writers on the subject of incompetence, such as Sigmund Freud, Karl Marx, and Alexander Pope.\nChapter 9 explains that, once employees have reached their level of incompetence, they always lack insight into their situation. Peter and Hull go on to explain why aptitude tests do not work and are actually counter-productive. Finally, they describe \"summit competence\": when someone reaches the highest level in their organization and yet is still competent at that level. This is only because there were not enough ranks in the hierarchy, or because they did not have time to reach a level of incompetence. Such people often seek a level of incompetence in another hierarchy; this is known as \"compulsive incompetence\". For example, Socrates was an outstanding teacher but a terrible defence attorney, and Hitler was an excellent politician but an incompetent generalissimo.\nChapter 10 explains why attempts to assist an incompetent employee by promoting another employee to act as their assistant does not work: \"Incompetence plus incompetence equals incompetence\" (italics in original).\nChapters 11 and 12 describe the various medical and psychological manifestations of stress that may come as result of someone reaching their level of incompetence, as well as other symptoms such as certain characteristic habits of speech or behaviour.\nChapter 13 considers whether it is possible for an employee who has reached their level of incompetence to be happy and healthy once they get there: the answer is no if the person realizes their true situation, and yes if the person does not.\nVarious ways of avoiding promotion to the final level are described in chapter 14. Attempting to refuse an offered promotion is ill-advised and is only practicable if the employee is not married and has no one else to answer to. Generally, it is better to avoid being considered for promotion in the first place, by pretending to be incompetent while one is actually still employed at a level of competence. This is \"\"Creative Incompetence\",\" for which several examples of successful techniques are given. It works best if the chosen field of incompetence does not actually impair one's work.\nThe concluding chapter applies Peter's Principle to the entire human species at an evolutionary level and asks whether humanity can survive in the long run, or will it become extinct upon reaching its level of incompetence as technology advances.\nResearch and related works.\nOther commenters made observations similar to the Peter principle long before Peter's research. Gotthold Ephraim Lessing's 1763 play \"Minna von Barnhelm\" features an army sergeant who shuns the opportunity to move up in the ranks, saying \"I am a good sergeant; I might easily make a bad captain, and certainly an even worse general. One knows from experience.\" Similarly, Carl von Clausewitz (1780\u20131831) wrote that \"there is nothing more common than to hear of men losing their energy on being raised to a higher position, to which they do not feel themselves equal.\" Spanish philosopher Jos\u00e9 Ortega y Gasset (1883\u20131955) virtually enunciated the Peter principle in 1910, \"All public employees should be demoted to their immediately lower level, as they have been promoted until turning incompetent.\"\nA number of scholars have engaged in research interpreting the Peter principle and its effects. In 2000, Edward Lazear explored two possible explanations for the phenomenon. First is the idea that employees work harder to gain a promotion, and then slack off once it is achieved. The other is that it is a statistical process: workers who are promoted have passed a particular benchmark of productivity based on factors that cannot necessarily be replicated in their new role, leading to a Peter principle situation. Lazear concluded that the former explanation only occurs under particular compensation structures, whereas the latter always holds up.\nAlessandro Pluchino, Andrea Rapisarda, and Cesare Garofalo (2010) used an agent-based modelling approach to simulate the promotion of employees in a system where the Peter principle is assumed to be true. They found that the best way to improve efficiency in an enterprise is to promote people randomly, or to shortlist the best and the worst performer in a given group, from which the person to be promoted is then selected randomly. For this work, they won the 2010 edition of the parody Ig Nobel Prize in management science. Later work has shown that firms that follow the Peter Principle may be disadvantaged, as they may be overtaken by competitors, or may produce smaller revenues and profits; as well why success most often is a result of luck rather than talent\u2014work which earned Pluchino and Rapisarda a second Ig Nobel Prize in 2022.\nIn 2018, professors Alan Benson, Danielle Li, and Kelly Shue analyzed sales workers' performance and promotion practices at 214 American businesses to test the veracity of the Peter principle. They found that these companies tended to promote employees to a management position based on their performance in their previous position, rather than based on managerial potential. Consistent with the Peter principle, the researchers found that high-performing sales employees were likelier to be promoted, and that they were likelier to perform poorly as managers, leading to considerable costs to the businesses.\nThe Peter principle inspired Scott Adams, creator of the comic strip \"Dilbert\", to develop a similar concept, the Dilbert principle. The Dilbert principle holds that incompetent employees are promoted to management positions to get them out of the workflow. The idea was explained by Adams in his 1996 business book \"The Dilbert Principle\", and it has since been analyzed alongside the Peter principle. Jo\u00e3o Ricardo Faria wrote that the Dilbert principle is \"a sub-optimal version of the Peter principle,\" and leads to even lower profitability than the Peter principle.\nSome authors refer to the phenomenon they have observed as the Paula principle: that the Peter principle applies mostly to male employees, while female employees are significantly less likely to be promoted than their male colleagues. Therefore women tend to be kept in positions that are below their abilities. They state that this discrimination against women affects all hierarchical levels and not just top positions. The name is a play on words with those of the apostles Peter and Paul.\nResponse by organizations.\nCompanies and organizations shaped their policies to contend with the Peter principle. Lazear stated that some companies expect that productivity will \"regress to the mean\" following promotion in their hiring and promotion practices. Other companies have adopted \"up or out\" strategies, such as the Cravath System, in which employees who do not advance are periodically fired. The Cravath System was developed at the law firm Cravath, Swaine &amp; Moore, which made a practice of hiring chiefly recent law graduates, promoting internally and firing employees who do not perform at the required level. Brian Christian and Tom Griffiths have suggested the additive increase/multiplicative decrease algorithm as a solution to the Peter principle less severe than firing employees who fail to advance. They propose a dynamic hierarchy in which employees are regularly either promoted or reassigned to a lower level so that any worker who is promoted to their point of failure is soon moved to an area where they are productive.\nPopular recognition.\n\"The Peter Principle\" is a British television sitcom broadcast by the BBC between 1995 and 2000, featuring Jim Broadbent as an incompetent bank manager named Peter, in an apparent demonstration of the principle.\n\"The Incompetence Opera\" is a 16-minute mini-opera that premiered at the satirical Ig Nobel Prize ceremony in 2017, described as \"a musical encounter with the Peter principle and the Dunning\u2013Kruger effect\".\n\"Freakonomics Radio\" is an American Public Radio program and podcast. In 2022, an episode was produced entitled \"Why Are There So Many Bad Bosses?\" This episode explains the Peter Principle and its practicality. The episode aired in syndication on National Public Radio in the United States of America.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Examples of psychotic symptoms are delusions, hallucinations, and disorganized or incoherent thoughts or speech. Psychosis is a description of a person's state or symptoms, rather than a particular mental illness, and it is not related to psychopathy (a personality construct characterized by impaired empathy and remorse, along with bold, disinhibited, and egocentric traits).\nCommon causes of chronic (i.e. ongoing or repeating) psychosis include schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, bipolar disorder, and brain damage (usually as a result of alcoholism). Acute (temporary) psychosis can also be caused by severe distress, sleep deprivation, sensory deprivation, some medications, and drug use (including alcohol, cannabis, hallucinogens, and stimulants). Acute psychosis is termed primary if it results from a psychiatric condition and secondary if it is caused by another medical condition or drugs. The diagnosis of a mental-health condition requires excluding other potential causes. Tests can be done to check whether psychosis is caused by central nervous system diseases, toxins, or other health problems.\nTreatment may include antipsychotic medication, psychotherapy, and social support. Early treatment appears to improve outcomes. Medications appear to have a moderate effect. Outcomes depend on the underlying cause.\nPsychosis is not well-understood at the neurological level, but dopamine (along with other neurotransmitters) is known to play an important role. In the United States about 3% of people develop psychosis at some point in their lives. Psychosis has been described as early as the 4th century BC by Hippocrates and possibly as early as 1500 BC in the Ebers Papyrus. \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSigns and symptoms.\nHallucinations.\nA hallucination is defined as a sensory perception in the absence of external stimuli. Hallucinations are different from illusions and perceptual distortions, which are the misperception of external stimuli. Hallucinations may occur in any of the senses and take on almost any form. They may consist of simple sensations (such as lights, colors, sounds, tastes, or smells) or more detailed experiences (such as seeing and interacting with animals and people, hearing voices, and having complex tactile sensations). Hallucinations are generally characterized as being vivid and uncontrollable. Auditory hallucinations, particularly experiences of hearing voices, are the most common and often prominent feature of psychosis.\nUp to 15% of the general population may experience auditory hallucinations (though not all are due to psychosis). The prevalence of auditory hallucinations in patients with schizophrenia is generally put around 70%. Reported prevalence in bipolar disorder ranges between 11% and 68%. During the early 20th century, auditory hallucinations were second to visual hallucinations in frequency, but they are now the most common manifestation of schizophrenia, although rates vary between cultures and regions. Auditory hallucinations are most commonly intelligible voices. When voices are present, the average number has been estimated at three. Content, like frequency, differs significantly, especially across cultures and demographics. People who experience auditory hallucinations can frequently identify the loudness, location of origin, and may settle on identities for voices. Western cultures are associated with auditory experiences concerning religious content, frequently related to sin. Hallucinations may command a person to do something potentially dangerous when combined with delusions.\nSo-called \"minor hallucinations\", such as extracampine hallucinations, or false perceptions of people or movement occurring outside of one's visual field, frequently occur in neurocognitive disorders, such as Parkinson's disease.\nVisual hallucinations occur in roughly a third of people with schizophrenia, although certain studies show rates higher than 60%, suggesting that the prevelance of visual hallucinatinations may be higher in certain samples than traditionally thought. The reported prevalence in bipolar disorder is around 15%. Content commonly involves animate objects, although perceptual abnormalities such as changes in lighting, shading, streaks, or lines may be seen. Visual abnormalities may conflict with proprioceptive information, and visions may include experiences such as the ground tilting. Lilliputian hallucinations are less common in schizophrenia, and are more common in various types of encephalopathy, such as peduncular hallucinosis.\nA visceral hallucination, also called a cenesthetic hallucination, is characterized by visceral sensations in the absence of stimuli. Cenesthetic hallucinations may include sensations of burning, or re-arrangement of internal organs.\nDelusions.\nA delusion is a fixed, false, idiosyncratic belief, which does not change even when presented with incontrovertible evidence to the contrary. Delusions are context- and culture-dependent: a belief that inhibits critical functioning and is widely considered delusional in one population may be common (and even adaptive) in another, or in the same population at a later time. Since normative views may contradict available evidence, a belief need not contravene cultural standards in order to be considered delusional. However, the DSM-5 considers a belief delusional only if it is not widely accepted within a cultural or subcultural context.\nPrevalence in schizophrenia is generally considered at least 90%, and around 50% in bipolar disorder.\nThe DSM-5 characterizes certain delusions as \"bizarre\" if they are clearly implausible, or are incompatible with the surrounding cultural context. The concept of bizarre delusions has many criticisms, the most prominent being that judging their presence is not highly reliable even among trained individuals.\nA delusion may involve diverse thematic content. The most common type is a persecutory delusion, in which a person believes that an entity seeks to harm them. Others include delusions of reference (the belief that some element of one's experience represents a deliberate and specific act by or message from some other entity), delusions of grandeur (the belief that one possesses special power or influence beyond one's actual limits), thought broadcasting (the belief that one's thoughts are audible) and thought insertion (the belief that one's thoughts are not one's own). A delusion may also involve misidentification of objects, persons, or environs that the afflicted should reasonably be able to recognize; such examples include Cotard's syndrome (the belief that oneself is partly or wholly dead) and clinical lycanthropy (the belief that oneself is or has transformed into an animal).\nThe subject matter of delusions seems to reflect the current culture in a particular time and location. For example, in the early 1900s in the United States, syphilis was a common theme in delusions. During the Second World War, it was Germany. In the Cold War era, communists became a frequent focus. Now, in recent years, technology is a common subject matter of delusions. Some psychologists, such as those who practice the Open Dialogue method, believe that the content of psychosis represents an underlying thought process, that may in part, be responsible for psychosis, though the accepted medical position is that psychosis is due to a brain disorder.\nHistorically, Karl Jaspers classified psychotic delusions into \"primary\" and \"secondary\" types. Primary delusions are defined as arising suddenly and not being comprehensible in terms of normal mental processes, whereas secondary delusions are typically understood as being influenced by the person's background or current situation (e.g., ethnicity, religious, superstitious, or political beliefs).\nDisorganized speech/thought and disorganized behavior.\nDisorganization is categorized into either disorganized speech (disorganized speech stemming from disorganized thought), and grossly disorganized motor behavior. Disorganized speech or thought, also formally called thought disorder, is disorganization of thinking that is \"inferred\" from speech. Characteristics of disorganized speech include rapidly switching topics which is called derailment or loose association, switching to topics that are unrelated which is called tangential thinking, incomprehensible speech which is called incoherence and referred to as a word salad. Disorganized motor behavior includes repetitive, odd, or sometimes purposeless movement. Disorganized motor behavior rarely includes catatonia, and although it was a prominent symptom historically, it is rarely seen today. Whether this may be due to the use of historical treatments or the lack thereof is unknown.\nCatatonia describes a profoundly agitated state in which the experience of reality is generally considered impaired. There are two primary manifestations of catatonic behavior. The classic presentation is a person who does not move or interact with the world in any way while awake. This type of catatonia presents with waxy flexibility. Waxy flexibility is when someone physically moves part of a catatonic person's body and the person stays in the position even if it is bizarre and otherwise nonfunctional (such as moving a person's arm straight up in the air and the arm staying there).\nThe other type of catatonia is more of an outward presentation of the profoundly agitated state described above. It involves excessive and purposeless motor behaviour, as well as an extreme mental preoccupation that prevents an intact experience of reality. An example is someone walking very fast in circles to the exclusion of anything else with a level of mental preoccupation (meaning not focused on anything relevant to the situation) that was not typical of the person prior to the symptom onset. In both types of catatonia, there is generally no reaction to anything that happens outside of them. It is important to distinguish catatonic agitation from severe bipolar mania, although someone could have both.\nNegative symptoms.\nNegative symptoms include reduced emotional expression, decreased motivation (avolition), and reduced spontaneous speech (poverty of speech, alogia). Individuals with this condition lack interest and spontaneity, and have the inability to feel pleasure (anhedonia). Altered Behavioral Inhibition System functioning could possibly cause reduced sustained attention in psychosis and overall contribute to more negative reactions.\nPsychosis in adolescents.\nPsychosis is relatively rare in adolescents but not uncommon. Young people who have psychosis may have trouble connecting with the world around them and may experience hallucinations or delusions. Adolescents with psychosis may also have cognitive deficits that may make it harder for the youth to socialize and work. Potential impairments include a reduced speed of mental processing, the lack of ability to focus without getting distracted (limited attention span), and deficits in verbal memory. If an adolescent is experiencing psychosis, they most likely have comorbidity, meaning that they could have multiple mental illnesses. Because of this, it may be difficult to determine whether it is psychosis or autism, social or generalized anxiety disorder, or obsessive-compulsive disorder.\nCauses.\nThe symptoms of psychosis may be caused by serious psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, a number of medical illnesses, and trauma. Psychosis may also be temporary or transient, and be caused by medications or substance use disorder (substance-induced psychosis).\nNormal states.\nBrief hallucinations are not uncommon in those without any psychiatric disease, including healthy children. Causes or triggers include:\nTrauma and stress.\nTraumatic life events have been linked with an elevated risk of developing psychotic symptoms. Childhood trauma has specifically been shown to be a predictor of adolescent and adult psychosis. Individuals with psychotic symptoms are three times more likely to have experienced childhood trauma (e.g., physical or sexual abuse, physical or emotional neglect) than those in the general population. Increased individual vulnerability toward psychosis may interact with traumatic experiences promoting an onset of future psychotic symptoms, particularly during sensitive developmental periods. Importantly, the relationship between traumatic life events and psychotic symptoms appears to be dose-dependent in which multiple traumatic life events accumulate, compounding symptom expression and severity. However, acute, stressful events can also trigger brief psychotic episodes. Trauma prevention and early intervention may be an important target for decreasing the incidence of psychotic disorders and ameliorating its effects. A healthy person could become psychotic when inside an empty room with no light and sound. After about 15 minutes, psychosis can occur, this is a phenomenon known as sensory deprivation.\nNeuroticism, a personality trait associated with vulnerability to stressors, is an independent predictor of the development of psychosis.\nPsychiatric disorders.\nTraditionally psychotic disorders have been believed to have one of two roots: organic (physiological) or functional (mental). Organic disorders being those caused by physical conditions directly affecting the brain with psychosis as a secondary feature, and functional disorders being primary psychological or psychiatric disorders (disorders of the functioning of the mind) in the absence of physiological causes. Subtle physical abnormalities have been found in illnesses traditionally considered functional, such as schizophrenia. The DSM-IV-TR avoids the functional/organic distinction, and instead lists traditional psychotic illnesses, psychosis due to general medical conditions, and substance-induced psychosis.\nPrimary psychiatric causes of psychosis include the following:\nPsychotic symptoms may also be seen in:\nSubtypes.\nSubtypes of psychosis include:\nCycloid psychosis.\nCycloid psychosis is typically an acute, self-limiting form of psychosis with psychotic and mood symptoms that progress from normal to full-blown, usually between a few hours to days, and not related to drug intake or brain injury. While proposed as a distinct entity, clinically separate from schizophrenia and affective disorders, cycloid psychosis is not formally acknowledged by current ICD or DSM criteria. Its unclear place in psychiatric nosology has likely contributed to the limited scientific investigation and literature on the topic.\nPostpartum psychosis.\nPostpartum psychosis is a rare yet serious and debilitating form of psychosis. Symptoms range from fluctuating moods and insomnia to mood-incongruent delusions related to the individual or the infant. Women experiencing postpartum psychosis are at increased risk for suicide or infanticide. Many women who experience first-time psychosis from postpartum often have bipolar disorder, meaning they could experience an increase of psychotic episodes even after postpartum.\nMedical conditions.\nA very large number of medical conditions can cause psychosis, sometimes called \"secondary psychosis\". Examples include:\nPsychoactive drugs.\nVarious psychoactive substances (both legal and illegal) have been implicated in causing, exacerbating, or precipitating psychotic states or disorders in users, with varying levels of evidence. This may be upon intoxication for a more prolonged period after use, or upon withdrawal. Individuals who experience substance-induced psychosis tend to have a greater awareness of their psychosis and tend to have higher levels of suicidal thinking compared to those who have a primary psychotic illness. Drugs commonly alleged to induce psychotic symptoms include alcohol, cannabis, cocaine, amphetamines, cathinones, psychedelic drugs (such as LSD and psilocybin), \u03ba-opioid receptor agonists (such as enadoline and salvinorin A) and NMDA receptor antagonists (such as phencyclidine and ketamine). Caffeine may worsen symptoms in those with schizophrenia and cause psychosis at very high doses in people without the condition. Cannabis and other illicit recreational drugs are often associated with psychosis in adolescents and cannabis use before 15 years old may increase the risk of psychosis in adulthood.\nAlcohol.\nApproximately 3% of people with alcoholism experience psychosis during acute intoxication or withdrawal. Alcohol related psychosis may manifest itself through a kindling mechanism. The mechanism of alcohol-related psychosis is due to the long-term effects of alcohol consumption resulting in distortions to neuronal membranes, gene expression, as well as thiamine deficiency. It is possible that hazardous alcohol use via a kindling mechanism can cause the development of a chronic substance-induced psychotic disorder, i.e. schizophrenia. The effects of an alcohol-related psychosis include an increased risk of depression and suicide as well as causing psychosocial impairments. Delirium tremens, a symptom of chronic alcoholism that can appear in the acute withdrawal phase, shares many symptoms with alcohol-related psychosis suggesting a common mechanism.\nCannabis.\nAccording to current studies, cannabis use is associated with increased risk of psychotic disorders, and the more often cannabis is used the more likely a person is to develop a psychotic illness. Furthermore, people with a history of cannabis use develop psychotic symptoms earlier than those who have never used cannabis. Some debate exists regarding the causal relationship between cannabis use and psychosis with some studies suggesting that cannabis use hastens the onset of psychosis primarily in those with pre-existing vulnerability. Indeed, cannabis use plays an important role in the development of psychosis in vulnerable individuals, and cannabis use in adolescence should be discouraged. Some studies indicate that the effects of two active compounds in cannabis, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD), have opposite effects with respect to psychosis. While THC can induce psychotic symptoms in healthy individuals, limited evidence suggests that CBD may have antipsychotic effects.\nMethamphetamine.\nMethamphetamine induces a psychosis in 26%\u201346% of heavy users. Some of these people develop a long-lasting psychosis that can persist for longer than six months. Those who have had a short-lived psychosis from methamphetamine can have a relapse of the methamphetamine psychosis years later after a stressful event such as severe insomnia or a period of hazardous alcohol use despite not relapsing back to methamphetamine. Individuals who have a long history of methamphetamine use and who have experienced psychosis in the past from methamphetamine use are highly likely to re-experience methamphetamine psychosis if drug use is recommenced. Methamphetamine-induced psychosis is likely gated by genetic vulnerability, which can produce long-term changes in brain neurochemistry following repetitive use. Methamphetamine users with more ADHD-related behaviours in childhood experience methamphetamine-related psychosis more frequently.\nPsychedelics.\nA 2024 meta-analysis found an incidence of psychedelic-induced psychosis at 0.002% in population studies, 0.2% in uncontrolled clinical trials, and 0.6% in randomised controlled trials. This meta-analysis found that in uncontrolled clinical trials involving only patients with schizophrenia, 3.8% developed prolonged psychotic reactions. A 2024 study found that psychedelic use was not generally associated with a change in the number of psychotic symptoms. This study found that psychedelic use interacted with a family history of bipolar disorder, such that in those with a family history of bipolar disorder, psychedelic use was associated with an increase in the number of psychotic symptoms, while in those with a personal history of psychosis but no family history of psychotic disorders, psychedelic use was associated with a decrease in the number of psychotic symptoms. A 2023 study found an interaction between lifetime psychedelic use and family history of psychosis or bipolar disorder on psychotic symptoms over the past two weeks. Psychotic symptoms were highest among those with both a family history of psychosis or bipolar disorder and life-time psychedelic use, while they were lowest among those with life-time psychedelic use but no family history of these disorders.\nMedication.\nAdministration, or sometimes withdrawal, of a large number of medications may provoke psychotic symptoms. Drugs that can induce psychosis experimentally or in a significant proportion of people include:\nPathophysiology.\nNeuroimaging.\nThe first brain image of an individual with psychosis was completed as far back as 1935 using a technique called pneumoencephalography (a painful and now obsolete procedure where cerebrospinal fluid is drained from around the brain and replaced with air to allow the structure of the brain to show up more clearly on an X-ray picture).\nBoth first episode psychosis, and high risk status is associated with reductions in grey matter volume (GMV). First episode psychotic and high risk populations are associated with similar but distinct abnormalities in GMV. Reductions in the right middle temporal gyrus, right superior temporal gyrus (STG), right parahippocampus, right hippocampus, right middle frontal gyrus, and left anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) are observed in high risk populations. Reductions in first episode psychosis span a region from the right STG to the right insula, left insula, and cerebellum, and are more severe in the right ACC, right STG, insula and cerebellum.\nAnother meta analysis reported bilateral reductions in insula, operculum, STG, medial frontal cortex, and ACC, but also reported increased GMV in the right lingual gyrus and left precentral gyrus. The Kraepelinian dichotomy is made questionable by grey matter abnormalities in bipolar and schizophrenia; schizophrenia is distinguishable from bipolar in that regions of grey matter reduction are generally larger in magnitude, although adjusting for gender differences reduces the difference to the left dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.\nDuring attentional tasks, first episode psychosis is associated with hypoactivation in the right middle frontal gyrus, a region generally described as encompassing the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC).Altered Behavioral Inhibition System functioning could possibly cause reduced sustained attention in psychosis and overall contribute to more negative reactions. In congruence with studies on grey matter volume, hypoactivity in the right insula, and right inferior parietal lobe is also reported. During cognitive tasks, hypoactivities in the right insula, dACC, and the left precuneus, as well as reduced deactivations in the right basal ganglia, right thalamus, right inferior frontal and left precentral gyri are observed. These results are highly consistent and replicable possibly except the abnormalities of the right inferior frontal gyrus. Decreased grey matter volume in conjunction with bilateral hypoactivity is observed in anterior insula, dorsal medial frontal cortex, and dorsal ACC. Decreased grey matter volume and bilateral hyperactivity is reported in posterior insula, ventral medial frontal cortex, and ventral ACC.\nHallucinations.\nStudies during acute experiences of hallucinations demonstrate increased activity in primary or secondary sensory cortices. As auditory hallucinations are most common in psychosis, most robust evidence exists for increased activity in the left middle temporal gyrus, left superior temporal gyrus, and left inferior frontal gyrus (i.e. Broca's area). Activity in the ventral striatum, hippocampus, and ACC are related to the lucidity of hallucinations, and indicate that activation or involvement of emotional circuitry are key to the impact of abnormal activity in sensory cortices. Together, these findings indicate abnormal processing of internally generated sensory experiences, coupled with abnormal emotional processing, results in hallucinations. One proposed model involves a failure of feedforward networks from sensory cortices to the inferior frontal cortex, which normally cancel out sensory cortex activity during internally generated speech. The resulting disruption in expected and perceived speech is thought to produce lucid hallucinatory experiences.\nDelusions.\nThe two-factor model of delusions posits that dysfunction in both belief formation systems and belief evaluation systems are necessary for delusions. Dysfunction in evaluations systems localized to the right lateral prefrontal cortex, regardless of delusion content, is supported by neuroimaging studies and is congruent with its role in conflict monitoring in healthy persons. Abnormal activation and reduced volume is seen in people with delusions, as well as in disorders associated with delusions such as frontotemporal dementia, psychosis and Lewy body dementia. Furthermore, lesions to this region are associated with \"jumping to conclusions\", damage to this region is associated with post-stroke delusions, and hypometabolism this region associated with caudate strokes presenting with delusions.\nThe aberrant salience model suggests that delusions are a result of people assigning excessive importance to irrelevant stimuli. In support of this hypothesis, regions normally associated with the salience network demonstrate reduced grey matter in people with delusions, and the neurotransmitter dopamine, which is widely implicated in salience processing, is also widely implicated in psychotic disorders.\nSpecific regions have been associated with specific types of delusions. The volume of the hippocampus and parahippocampus is related to paranoid delusions in Alzheimer's disease, and has been reported to be abnormal post mortem in one person with delusions. Capgras delusions have been associated with occipito-temporal damage, and may be related to failure to elicit normal emotions or memories in response to faces.\nNegative symptoms.\nPsychosis is associated with the ventral striatum (VS), which is the part of the brain that is involved with the desire to naturally satisfy the body's needs. When high reports of negative symptoms were recorded, there were significant irregularities in the left VS. Anhedonia, defined as the inability to feel joy or pleasure, is a commonly reported symptom in psychosis; experiences with the condition are present in most people with schizophrenia. Previous research has indicated that a deficiency in the neural representation in regards to goals and the motivation to achieve them, has demonstrated that when a reward is not present, a strong reaction is noted in the ventral striatum; reinforcement learning is intact when contingencies about stimulus-reward are implicit, but not when they require explicit neural processing; reward prediction errors are what the actual reward is versus what the reward was predicted to be. In most cases positive prediction errors are considered an abnormal occurrence. A positive prediction error response occurs when there is an increased activation in a brain region, typically the striatum, in response to unexpected rewards. A negative prediction error response occurs when there is a decreased activation in a region when predicted rewards do not occur. Anterior Cingulate Cortex (ACC) response, taken as an indicator of effort allocation, does not increase with reward or reward probability increase, and is associated with negative symptoms; deficits in Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex (dlPFC) activity and failure to improve performance on cognitive tasks when offered monetary incentives are present; and dopamine mediated functions are abnormal.\nNeurobiology.\nPsychosis has been traditionally linked to the overactivity of the neurotransmitter dopamine, in particular to its effect in the mesolimbic pathway, spanning from the ventral tegmental area to the ventral striatum. Additionally, recent evidence suggests a crucial involvement of the pathway spanning from the substantia nigra to the dorsal striatum. The two major sources of evidence given to support this theory are that dopamine receptor D2 blocking drugs (i.e., antipsychotics) tend to reduce the intensity of psychotic symptoms, and that drugs that accentuate dopamine release, or inhibit its reuptake (such as amphetamines and cocaine) can trigger psychosis in some people (see stimulant psychosis). However, there is substantial evidence that dopaminergic overactivity does not fully explain psychosis, and that neurodegerative pathophysiology plays a significant role. This is evidenced by the fact that psychosis commonly occurs in neurodegenerative diseases of the dopaminergic nervous system, such as Parkinson's disease, which involved reduced, rather than increased, dopaminergic activity.\nThe endocannabinoid system is also implicated in psychosis. This is evidenced by the propensity of CB1 receptor agonists such as THC to induce psychotic symptoms, and the efficacy of CB1 receptor antagonists such as CBD in ameliorating psychosis.\nNMDA receptor dysfunction has been proposed as a mechanism in psychosis. This theory is reinforced by the fact that dissociative NMDA receptor antagonists such as ketamine, PCP and dextromethorphan (at large overdoses) induce a psychotic state. The symptoms of dissociative intoxication are also considered to mirror the symptoms of schizophrenia, including negative symptoms. NMDA receptor antagonism, in addition to producing symptoms reminiscent of psychosis, mimics the neurophysiological aspects, such as reduction in the amplitude of P50, P300, and MMN evoked potentials. Hierarchical Bayesian neurocomputational models of sensory feedback, in agreement with neuroimaging literature, link NMDA receptor hypofunction to delusional or hallucinatory symptoms via proposing a failure of NMDA mediated top down predictions to adequately cancel out enhanced bottom up AMPA mediated predictions errors. Excessive prediction errors in response to stimuli that would normally not produce such a response is thought to root from conferring excessive salience to otherwise mundane events. Dysfunction higher up in the hierarchy, where representation is more abstract, could result in delusions. The common finding of reduced GAD67 expression in psychotic disorders may explain enhanced AMPA mediated signaling, caused by reduced GABAergic inhibition.\nThe connection between dopamine and psychosis is generally believed to be complex. While dopamine receptor D2 suppresses adenylate cyclase activity, the D1 receptor increases it. If D2-blocking drugs are administered, the blocked dopamine spills over to the D1 receptors. The increased adenylate cyclase activity affects genetic expression in the nerve cell, which takes time. Hence antipsychotic drugs take a week or two to reduce the symptoms of psychosis. Moreover, newer and equally effective antipsychotic drugs actually block slightly less dopamine in the brain than older drugs whilst also blocking 5-HT2A receptors, suggesting the 'dopamine hypothesis' may be oversimplified. Soyka and colleagues found no evidence of dopaminergic dysfunction in people with alcohol-induced psychosis and Zoldan et al. reported moderately successful use of ondansetron, a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, in the treatment of levodopa psychosis in Parkinson's disease patients.\nA review found an association between a first-episode of psychosis and prediabetes.\nProlonged or high dose use of psychostimulants can alter normal functioning, making it similar to the manic phase of bipolar disorder. NMDA antagonists replicate some of the so-called \"negative\" symptoms like thought disorder in subanesthetic doses (doses insufficient to induce anesthesia), and catatonia in high doses. Psychostimulants, especially in one already prone to psychotic thinking, can cause some \"positive\" symptoms, such as delusional beliefs, particularly those persecutory in nature.\nCulture.\nCross-cultural studies into schizophrenia have found that individual experiences of psychosis and 'hearing voices' vary across cultures. In countries such as the United States where there exists a predominantly biomedical understanding of the body, the mind and in turn, mental health, subjects were found to report their hallucinations as having 'violent content' and self-describing as 'crazy'. This experience is at odds with the experiences of subjects in Accra, Ghana, who describe the voices they hear as having 'spiritual meaning' and are often reported as positive in nature; or subjects in Chennai, India, who describe their hallucinations as kin, family members or close friends, and offering guidance.\nThese differences are attributed to 'social kindling' or how one's social context shapes the way they interpret and experience sensations such as hallucinations. This concept aligns with preexisting cognitive theory such as reality modelling and is supported by recent research that demonstrates that individuals with psychosis can be taught to attend to their hallucinations differently, which in turn alters the hallucinations themselves. Such research creates pathways for social or community-based treatment, such as reality monitoring, for individuals with schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders, providing alternatives to, or supplementing traditional pharmacologic management.\nCross-cultural studies explore the way in which psychosis varies in different cultures, countries and religions. The cultural differences are based on the individual or shared illness narratives surrounding cultural meanings of illness experience. In countries such as India, Cambodia and Muslim majority countries, they each share alternative epistemologies. These are known as knowledge systems that focus on the connections between mind, body, culture, nature and society. Cultural perceptions of mental disorders such as psychosis or schizophrenia are believed to be caused by jinn (spirits) in Muslim majority countries. Furthermore, those in Arab-Muslim societies perceive those who act differently than the social norm as \"crazy\" or as abnormal behaviour. This differs from the experiences of individuals in India and how they attain their perspectives on mental health issues through a variety of spiritual and healing traditions. In Cambodia, hallucinations are linked with spirit visitation, a term they call \"cultural kindling\". These examples of differences are attributed to culture and the way it shapes conceptions of mental disorders. These cultural differences can be useful in bridging the gap of cultural understanding and psychiatric signs and symptoms.\nDiagnosis.\nTo make a diagnosis of a mental illness in someone with psychosis other potential causes must be excluded. An initial assessment includes a comprehensive history and physical examination by a health care provider. Tests may be done to exclude substance use, medication, toxins, surgical complications, or other medical illnesses. A person with psychosis is referred to as psychotic.\nDelirium should be ruled out, which can be distinguished by visual hallucinations, acute onset and fluctuating level of consciousness, indicating other underlying factors, including medical illnesses. Excluding medical illnesses associated with psychosis is performed by using blood tests to measure:\nOther investigations include:\nBecause psychosis may be precipitated or exacerbated by common classes of medications, medication-induced psychosis should be ruled out, particularly for first-episode psychosis. Both substance- and medication-induced psychosis can be excluded to a high level of certainty, using toxicology screening.\nBecause some dietary supplements may also induce psychosis or mania, but cannot be ruled out with laboratory tests, a psychotic individual's family, partner, or friends should be asked whether the patient is currently taking any dietary supplements.\nCommon mistakes made when diagnosing people who are psychotic include:\nOnly after relevant and known causes of psychosis are excluded, a mental health clinician may make a psychiatric differential diagnosis using a person's family history, incorporating information from the person with psychosis, and information from family, friends or romantic partners.\nTypes of psychosis in psychiatric disorders may be established by formal rating scales. The Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) assesses the level of 18 symptom constructs of psychosis such as hostility, suspicion, hallucination, and grandiosity. It is based on the clinician's interview with the patient and observations of the patient's behavior over the previous 2\u20133 days. The patient's family can also answer questions on the behavior report. During the initial assessment and the follow-up, both positive and negative symptoms of psychosis can be assessed using the 30 item Positive and Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS).\nThe DSM-5 characterizes disorders as psychotic or on the schizophrenia spectrum if they involve hallucinations, delusions, disorganized thinking, grossly disorganized motor behavior, or negative symptoms. The DSM-5 does not include psychosis as a definition in the glossary, although it defines \"psychotic features\", as well as \"psychoticism\" with respect to personality disorder. The ICD-10 has no specific definition of psychosis.\nThe PSQ (Psychosis Screening Questionnaire) is the most common tool in detecting psychotic symptoms and it includes five root questions that assess the presence of PLE (mania, thought insertion, paranoia, strange experiences and perceptual disturbances) The different tools used to assess symptom severity include the Revised Behavior and Symptom Identification Scale (BASIS-R), a 24-item self-report instrument with six scales: psychosis, depression/functioning, interpersonal problems, alcohol/drug use, self-harm, and emotional lability. The Symptom Checklist-90-Revised (SCL-90-R), a 90-item self assessment tool that measures psychoticism and paranoid ideation in addition to seven other symptom scales. Finally, the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI), a 53-item self-administered scale developed from the SCL-90-R. The BSI has good psychometric properties and is an acceptable brief alternative to the SCL-90-R. These seem to be the most accurate tools at the moment, but a research in 2007 that focused on quantifying self-reports of auditory verbal hallucinations (AVH) in persons with psychosis, suggest that The Hamilton Program for Schizophrenia Voices Questionnaire (HPSVQ) is also potentially a reliable and useful measure for specifically quantifying AVHs in relation to psychosis.\nFactor analysis of symptoms generally regarded as psychosis frequently yields a five factor solution, albeit five factors that are distinct from the five domains defined by the DSM-5 to encompass psychotic or schizophrenia spectrum disorders. The five factors are frequently labeled as hallucinations, delusions, disorganization, excitement, and emotional distress. The DSM-5 emphasizes a psychotic spectrum, wherein the low end is characterized by schizoid personality disorder, and the high end is characterized by schizophrenia.\nGouzoulis-Mayfrank et al. said that the pleasant or emotionally positive experiences that are common in psychosis, particularly in the early stages, are more easily overlooked in clinical practice than the negative experiences. Nev Jones and Mona Shattel wrote that there is less curiosity towards the complications, or towards the richness of the good things as well as the bad things.\nPrevention.\nThe evidence for the effectiveness of early interventions to prevent psychosis appeared inconclusive. But psychosis caused by drugs can be prevented. Whilst early intervention in those with a psychotic episode might improve short-term outcomes, little benefit was seen from these measures after five years. However, there is evidence that cognitive behavioral therapy (C.B.T.) may reduce the risk of becoming psychotic in those at high risk, and in 2014 the U.K. National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (N.I.C.E.) recommended preventive C.B.T. for people at risk of psychosis.\nTreatment.\nThe treatment of psychosis depends on the specific diagnosis (such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder or substance intoxication). The first-line treatment for many psychotic disorders is antipsychotic medication,\n which can reduce the positive symptoms of psychosis in about 7 to 14 days. For youth or adolescents, treatment options include medications, psychological interventions, and social interventions.\nMedication.\nThe choice of which antipsychotic to use is based on benefits, risks, and costs. It is debatable whether, as a class, typical or atypical antipsychotics are better. Tentative evidence supports that amisulpride, olanzapine, risperidone and clozapine may be more effective for positive symptoms but result in more side effects. Typical antipsychotics have equal drop-out and symptom relapse rates to atypicals when used at low to moderate dosages. There is a good response in 40\u201350%, a partial response in 30\u201340%, and treatment resistance (failure of symptoms to respond satisfactorily after six weeks to two or three different antipsychotics) in 20% of people. Clozapine is an effective treatment for those who respond poorly to other drugs (\"treatment-resistant\" or \"refractory\" schizophrenia), but it has the potentially serious side effect of agranulocytosis (lowered white blood cell count) in less than 4% of people.\nMost people on antipsychotics get side effects. People on typical antipsychotics tend to have a higher rate of extrapyramidal side effects while some atypicals are associated with considerable weight gain, diabetes and risk of metabolic syndrome; this is most pronounced with olanzapine, while risperidone and quetiapine are also associated with weight gain. Risperidone has a similar rate of extrapyramidal symptoms to haloperidol.\nPsychotherapy.\nPsychological treatments such as acceptance and commitment therapy (A.C.T.) are possibly useful in the treatment of psychosis, helping people to focus more on what they can do in terms of valued life directions despite challenging symptomology. Metacognitive training (MCT) is associated with reduced delusions, hallucinations and negative symptoms as well as improved self-esteem and functioning in individuals with schizophrenia spectrum disorders.\nThere are many psychosocial interventions that seek to treat the symptoms of psychosis: need adapted treatment, Open Dialogue, psychoanalysis/psychodynamic psychotherapy, major role therapy, soteria, psychosocial outpatient and inpatient treatment, milieu therapy, and cognitive behavioral therapy (C.B.T.). In relation to the success of C.B.T. for psychosis, a randomized controlled trial for a web-based C.B.T.P. (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Psychosis) skills program named Coping With Voices (C.W.V.) suggest that the program has promise for increasing access to C.B.T.P. It also associated benefits in the management of distressing psychotic symptoms and improved social functioning. When C.B.T. and the other psychosocial interventions these are used without antipsychotic medications, they may be somewhat effective for some people, especially for C.B.T., need-adapted treatment, and soteria.\nEarly intervention.\nEarly intervention in psychosis is based on the observation that identifying and treating someone in the early stages of a psychosis can improve his or her longer-term outcome. This approach advocates the use of an intensive multi-disciplinary approach during what is known as the critical period, where intervention is the most effective, and prevents the long-term morbidity associated with chronic psychotic illness.\nSystematic reform.\nAddressing systematic reform is essential to creating effective prevention as well as supporting treatments and recovery for those with psychosis.\nWaghorn et al. suggest that education interventions can be a building block to support those with psychosis to successfully participate in society. In their study they analyse the relationship between successful education attainment and psychosis. Findings suggest proportionately more school-aged persons with psychosis discontinued their education compared to those without psychosis.\nWaghorn et al. finds that specialised supported education for those with psychotic disorders can help lead to successful education attainment. Additionally, future employment outcomes are relative to such education attainment. Established approaches to supported education in the U.S. include three basic models, self-contained classrooms, onsite support model and the mobile support model. Each model includes the participation of mental health service staff or educational facility staff in the student's education arrangements.\nPotential benefits of specialised supported education found from this study include coordination with other service providers (e.g. income support, housing, etc.) to prevent disrupting education, providing specialised career counselling, development of coping skills in the academic environment. These examples provide beneficial ways for people with psychosis to finish studies successfully as well as counter future experiences of psychosis.\nHistory.\nEtymology.\nThe word \"psychosis\" was introduced to the psychiatric literature in 1841 by Karl Friedrich Canstatt in his work \"Handbuch der Medizinischen Klinik\". He used it as a shorthand for 'psychic neurosis'. At that time neurosis meant any disease of the nervous system, and Canstatt was thus referring to what was considered a psychological manifestation of brain disease. Ernst von Feuchtersleben is also widely credited as introducing the term in 1845, as an alternative to insanity and mania.\nThe term stems from Modern Latin \"psychosis\", \"a giving soul or life to, animating, quickening\" and that from Ancient Greek \u03c8\u03c5\u03c7\u03ae (), \"soul\" and the suffix -\u03c9\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 (-\"\"), in this case \"abnormal condition\".\nIn its adjective form \"psychotic\", references to psychosis can be found in both clinical and non-clinical discussions. However, in a \"non\"-clinical context, \"psychotic\" is a nonspecific colloquialism used to mean \"insane\".\nClassification.\nThe word was also used to distinguish a condition considered a disorder of the mind, as opposed to \"neurosis\", which was considered a disorder of the nervous system. The psychoses thus became the modern equivalent of the old notion of madness, and hence there was much debate on whether there was only one (unitary) or many forms of the new disease. One type of broad usage would later be narrowed down by Koch in 1891 to the 'psychopathic inferiorities'\u2014later renamed abnormal personalities by Schneider.\nThe division of the major psychoses into manic depressive illness (now called bipolar disorder) and dementia praecox (now called schizophrenia) was made by Emil Kraepelin, who attempted to create a synthesis of the various mental disorders identified by 19th-century psychiatrists, by grouping diseases together based on classification of common symptoms. Kraepelin used the term 'manic depressive insanity' to describe the whole spectrum of mood disorders, in a far wider sense than it is usually used today.\nIn Kraepelin's classification this would include 'unipolar' clinical depression, as well as bipolar disorder and other mood disorders such as cyclothymia. These are characterised by problems with mood control and the psychotic episodes appear associated with disturbances in mood, and patients often have periods of normal functioning between psychotic episodes even without medication. Schizophrenia is characterized by psychotic episodes that appear unrelated to disturbances in mood, and most non-medicated patients show signs of disturbance between psychotic episodes.\nTreatment.\nWritten record of supernatural causes and resultant treatments can be traced back to the New Testament. Mark 5:8\u201313 describes a man displaying what would today be described as psychotic symptoms. Christ cured this \"demonic madness\" by casting out the demons and hurling them into a herd of swine. Exorcism is still utilized in some religious circles as a treatment for psychosis presumed to be demonic possession. A research study of out-patients in psychiatric clinics found that 30% of religious patients attributed the cause of their psychotic symptoms to evil spirits. Many of these patients underwent exorcistic healing rituals that, though largely regarded as positive experiences by the patients, had no effect on symptomology. Results did however show a significant worsening of psychotic symptoms associated with exclusion of medical treatment for coercive forms of exorcism.\nThe medical teachings of the fourth-century philosopher and physician Hippocrates of Cos proposed a natural, rather than supernatural, cause of human illness. In Hippocrates' work, the Hippocratic corpus, a holistic explanation for health and disease was developed to include madness and other \"diseases of the mind\". Hippocrates writes:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Men ought to know that from the brain, and from the brain only, arise our pleasures, joys, laughter, and jests, as well as our sorrows, pains, griefs and tears. Through it, in particular, we think, see, hear, and distinguish the ugly from the beautiful, the bad from the good, the pleasant from the unpleasant... It is the same thing which makes us mad or delirious, inspires us with dread and fear, whether by night or by day, brings sleeplessness, inopportune mistakes, aimless anxieties, absentmindedness, and acts that are contrary to habit.\nHippocrates espoused a theory of humoralism wherein disease is resultant of a shifting balance in bodily fluids including blood, phlegm, black bile, and yellow bile. According to humoralism, each fluid or \"humour\" has temperamental or behavioral correlates. In the case of psychosis, symptoms are thought to be caused by an excess of both blood and yellow bile. Thus, the proposed surgical intervention for psychotic or manic behavior was bloodletting.\n18th-century physician, educator, and widely considered \"founder of American psychiatry\", Benjamin Rush, also prescribed bloodletting as a first-line treatment for psychosis. Although not a proponent of humoralism, Rush believed that active purging and bloodletting were efficacious corrections for disruptions in the circulatory system, a complication he believed was the primary cause of \"insanity\". Although Rush's treatment modalities are now considered antiquated and brutish, his contributions to psychiatry, namely the biological underpinnings of psychiatric phenomenon including psychosis, have been invaluable to the field. In honor of such contributions, Benjamin Rush's image is in the official seal of the American Psychiatric Association.\nEarly 20th-century treatments for severe and persisting psychosis were characterized by an emphasis on shocking the nervous system. Such therapies include insulin shock therapy, cardiazol shock therapy, and electroconvulsive therapy. Despite considerable risk, shock therapy was considered highly efficacious in the treatment of psychosis including schizophrenia. The acceptance of high-risk treatments led to more invasive medical interventions including psychosurgery.\nIn 1888, Swiss psychiatrist Gottlieb Burckhardt performed the first medically sanctioned psychosurgery in which the cerebral cortex was excised. Although some patients showed improvement of symptoms and became more subdued, one patient died and several developed aphasia or seizure disorders. Burckhardt would go on to publish his clinical outcomes in a scholarly paper. This procedure was met with criticism from the medical community and his academic and surgical endeavors were largely ignored. In the late 1930s, Egas Moniz conceived the leucotomy (AKA prefrontal lobotomy) in which the fibers connecting the frontal lobes to the rest of the brain were severed. Moniz's primary inspiration stemmed from a demonstration by neuroscientists John Fulton and Carlyle's 1935 experiment in which two chimpanzees were given leucotomies and pre- and post-surgical behavior was compared. Prior to the leucotomy, the chimps engaged in typical behavior including throwing feces and fighting. After the procedure, both chimps were pacified and less violent. During the Q&amp;A, Moniz asked if such a procedure could be extended to human subjects, a question that Fulton admitted was quite startling. Moniz would go on to extend the controversial practice to humans with various psychotic disorders, an endeavor for which he received a Nobel Prize in 1949. Between the late 1930s and early 1970s, the leucotomy was a widely accepted practice, often performed in non-sterile environments such as small outpatient clinics and patient homes. Psychosurgery remained standard practice until the discovery of antipsychotic pharmacology in the 1950s.\nThe first clinical trial of antipsychotics (also commonly known as neuroleptics) for the treatment of psychosis took place in 1952. Chlorpromazine (brand name: Thorazine) passed clinical trials and became the first antipsychotic medication approved for the treatment of both acute and chronic psychosis. Although the mechanism of action was not discovered until 1963, the administration of chlorpromazine marked the advent of the dopamine antagonist, or first generation antipsychotic. While clinical trials showed a high response rate for both acute psychosis and disorders with psychotic features, the side effects were particularly harsh, which included high rates of often irreversible Parkinsonian symptoms such as tardive dyskinesia. With the advent of atypical antipsychotics (also known as second generation antipsychotics) came a dopamine antagonist with a comparable response rate but a far different, though still extensive, side-effect profile that included a lower risk of Parkinsonian symptoms but a higher risk of cardiovascular disease. Atypical antipsychotics remain the first-line treatment for psychosis associated with various psychiatric and neurological disorders including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, anxiety disorders, dementia, and some autism spectrum disorders.\nDopamine is now one of the primary neurotransmitters implicated in psychotic symptomology. Blocking dopamine receptors (namely, the dopamine D2 receptors) and decreasing dopaminergic activity continues to be an effective but highly unrefined effect of antipsychotics, which are commonly used to treat psychosis. Recent pharmacological research suggests that the decrease in dopaminergic activity does not eradicate psychotic delusions or hallucinations, but rather attenuates the reward mechanisms involved in the development of delusional thinking; that is, connecting or finding meaningful relationships between unrelated stimuli or ideas. The author of this research paper acknowledges the importance of future investigation:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The model presented here is based on incomplete knowledge related to dopamine, schizophrenia, and antipsychotics\u2014and as such will need to evolve as more is known about these.\u2014\u200a\nFreud's former student Wilhelm Reich explored independent insights into the physical effects of neurotic and traumatic upbringing, and published his holistic psychoanalytic treatment with a schizophrenic. With his incorporation of breathwork and insight with the patient, a young woman, she achieved sufficient self-management skills to end the therapy.\nLacan extended Freud's ideas to create a psychoanalytic model of psychosis based upon the concept of \"foreclosure\", the rejection of the symbolic concept of the father.\nPsychiatrist David Healy has criticised pharmaceutical companies for promoting simplified biological theories of mental illness that seem to imply the primacy of pharmaceutical treatments while ignoring social and developmental factors that are known important influences in the etiology of psychosis.\nSociety and culture.\nSymptoms of psychosis can also include visions or quasi-visual experiences, felt presences, alterations of time, alterations of space, or alterations of spatiotemporal qualities of objects and things. While there are many overwhelmingly negative experiences of psychosis, some experiences of psychosis can be overwhelmingly positive and can be experienced as uplifting or as healing or as difficult but meaningful. Jones and Shattell said that mutual dialogue in clinical practice would in theory allow the meaning and complexity of psychotic experiences to emerge.\nDisability.\nThe classification of psychosis as a social disability is a common occurrence.\nPsychosis is considered to be among the top ten causes of social disability among adults in developed countries. The traditional, negative narrative around disability has been shown to adversely influence employment and education for people experiencing psychosis.\nSocial disability by way of social disconnection is a significant public health concern and is associated with a broad range of negative outcomes, including premature mortality. Social disconnection refers to the ongoing absence of family or social relationships with marginal participation in social activities.\nResearch on psychosis found that reduced participation in social networks, not only negatively effects the individual on a physical and mental level, it has been shown that failure to be included in social networks influences the individual's ability to participate in the wider community through employment and education opportunities.\nEqual opportunity to participate in meaningful relationships with friends, family and romantic partners, as well as engaging in social constructs such as employment, can provide significant physical and mental value to people's lives. And how breaking the disability mind-set around people experiencing psychosis is imperative for their overall, long-term health and well-being as well as the contributions they are able to make to their immediate social connections and the wider community.\nResearch.\nFurther research in the form of randomized controlled trials is needed to determine the effectiveness of treatment approaches for helping \"adolescents\" with psychosis. Through 10 randomized clinical trials, studies showed that Early Intervention Services (EIS) for patients with early-phase schizophrenia spectrum disorders have generated promising outcomes. EIS are specifically intended to fulfill the needs of patients with early-phase psychosis. In addition, one meta-analysis that consisted of four randomized clinical trials has examined and discovered the efficacy of EIS to Therapy as Usual (TAU) for early-phase psychosis, revealing that EIS techniques are superior to TAU.\nA study suggests that combining cognitive behavioral therapy (C.B.T.) with SlowMo, an application that helps notice their \"unhelpful quick-thinking\", might be more effective for treating paranoia in people with psychosis than C.B.T. alone.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "24515", "revid": "20472590", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24515", "title": "Paranoia", "text": "Psychotic disorder\nMedical condition&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Infobox/styles-images.css\" /&gt;\nParanoia is an instinct or thought process that is believed to be heavily influenced by anxiety, suspicion, or fear, often to the point of delusion and irrationality. Paranoid thinking typically includes persecutory beliefs, or beliefs of conspiracy concerning a perceived threat towards oneself (e.g., \"Everyone is out to get me\"). Paranoia is distinct from phobias, which also involve irrational fear, but usually no blame.\nMaking false accusations and the general distrust of other people also frequently accompany paranoia. For example, a paranoid person might believe an incident was intentional when most people would view it as an accident or coincidence. Paranoia is a central symptom of psychosis.\nSigns and symptoms.\nA common symptom of paranoia is attribution bias. These individuals typically have a biased perception of reality, often exhibiting more hostile beliefs than average. A paranoid person may view someone else's accidental behavior as though it is intentional or signifies a threat.\nAn investigation of a non-clinical paranoid population found that characteristics such as feeling powerless and depressed, isolating oneself, and relinquishing activities, were associated with more frequent paranoia.\nSome scientists have created different subtypes for the various symptoms of paranoia, including erotic, persecutory, litigious, and exalted.\nSome research suggests that symptoms of paranoid personality disorder are associated with a higher number of divorces, likely due to how paranoid patterns of thinking hinder relationships. This seems to fall in line with some older sources, which allege that paranoid individuals tend to be of a single status.\nSome researchers have arranged types of paranoia by commonality. The least common types of paranoia at the very top of the hierarchy would be those involving more serious threats. Social anxiety is at the bottom of this hierarchy as the most frequently exhibited level of paranoia.\nCauses.\nSocial and environmental.\nSocial circumstances appear to be highly influential on paranoid beliefs. According to a mental health survey distributed to residents of Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, Chihuahua (in Mexico) and El Paso, Texas (in the United States), paranoid beliefs seem to be associated with feelings of powerlessness and victimization, enhanced by social situations. Paranoid symptoms were associated with an attitude of mistrust and an external locus of control. Citing research showing that women and those with lower socioeconomic status are more prone to locating locus of control externally, the researchers suggested that women may be especially affected by the effects of socioeconomic status on paranoia.\nSurveys have revealed that paranoia can develop from difficult parental relationships and untrustworthy environments, for instance those that were highly disciplinary, strict, and unstable, could contribute to paranoia. Some sources have also noted that indulging and pampering the child could contribute to greater paranoia, via disrupting the child's understanding of their relationship with the world. Experiences found to enhance or create paranoia included frequent disappointment, stress, and a sense of hopelessness.\nDiscrimination has also been reported as a potential predictor of paranoid delusions. Such reports that paranoia seemed to appear more in older patients who had experienced greater discrimination throughout their lives. Immigrants are more subject to some forms of psychosis than the general population, which may be related to more frequent experiences of discrimination and humiliation.\nPsychological.\nMany more mood-based symptoms, for example grandiosity and guilt, may underlie functional paranoia.\nColby (1981) defined paranoid cognition as \"persecutory delusions and false beliefs whose propositional content clusters around ideas of being harassed, threatened, harmed, subjugated, persecuted, accused, mistreated, killed, wronged, tormented, disparaged, vilified, and so on, by malevolent others, either specific individuals or groups\" (p.\u00a0518).\nThree components of paranoid cognition have been identified by Robins &amp; Post: \"a) suspicions without enough basis that others are exploiting, harming, or deceiving them; b) preoccupation with unjustified doubts about the loyalty, or trustworthiness, of friends or associates; c) reluctance to confide in others because of unwarranted fear that the information will be used maliciously against them\" (1997, p.\u00a03).\nParanoid cognition has been conceptualized by clinical psychology almost exclusively in terms of psychodynamic constructs and dispositional variables. From this point of view, paranoid cognition is a manifestation of an intra-psychic conflict or disturbance. For instance, Colby (1981) suggested that the biases of blaming others for one's problems serve to alleviate the distress produced by the feeling of being humiliated, and helps to repudiate the belief that the self is to blame for such incompetence. This intra-psychic perspective emphasizes that the cause of paranoid cognitions is inside the head of the people (social perceiver), and dismisses the possibility that paranoid cognition may be related to the social context in which such cognitions are embedded. This point is extremely relevant because when origins of distrust and suspicion (two components of paranoid cognition) are studied many researchers have accentuated the importance of social interaction, particularly when social interaction has gone awry. Even more, a model of trust development pointed out that trust increases or decreases as a function of the cumulative history of interaction between two or more persons.\nAnother relevant difference can be discerned among \"pathological and non-pathological forms of trust and distrust\". According to Deutsch, the main difference is that non-pathological forms are flexible and responsive to changing circumstances. Pathological forms reflect exaggerated perceptual biases and judgmental predispositions that can arise and perpetuate them, are reflexively caused errors similar to a self-fulfilling prophecy.\nIt has been suggested that a \"hierarchy\" of paranoia exists, extending from mild social evaluative concerns, through ideas of social reference, to persecutory beliefs concerning mild, moderate, and severe threats.\nPhysical.\nA paranoid reaction may be caused from a decline in brain circulation as a result of high blood pressure or hardening of the arterial walls.\nDrug-induced paranoia, associated with cannabis and stimulants like amphetamines or methamphetamine, has much in common with schizophrenic paranoia; the relationship has been under investigation since 2012. Drug-induced paranoia has a better prognosis than schizophrenic paranoia once the drug has been removed. For further information, see stimulant psychosis and substance-induced psychosis.\nBased on data obtained by the Dutch NEMESIS project in 2005, there was an association between impaired hearing and the onset of symptoms of psychosis, which was based on a five-year follow up. Some older studies have actually declared that a state of paranoia can be produced in patients that were under a hypnotic state of deafness. This idea however generated much skepticism during its time.\nDiagnosis.\nIn the DSM-IV-TR, paranoia is diagnosed in the form of:\nAccording to clinical psychologist P. J. McKenna, \"As a noun, paranoia denotes a disorder which has been argued in and out of existence, and whose clinical features, course, boundaries, and virtually every other aspect of which is controversial. Employed as an adjective, paranoid has become attached to a diverse set of presentations, from paranoid schizophrenia, through paranoid depression, to paranoid personality\u2014not to mention a motley collection of paranoid 'psychoses', 'reactions', and 'states'\u2014and this is to restrict discussion to functional disorders. Even when abbreviated down to the prefix para-, the term crops up causing trouble as the contentious but stubbornly persistent concept of paraphrenia\".\nAt least 50% of the diagnosed cases of schizophrenia experience delusions of reference and delusions of persecution. Paranoia perceptions and behavior may be part of many mental illnesses, such as depression and dementia, but they are more prevalent in three mental disorders: paranoid schizophrenia, delusional disorder (persecutory type), and paranoid personality disorder.\nTreatment.\nParanoid delusions are often treated with antipsychotic medication, which exert a medium effect size. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) lessens paranoid delusions relative to control conditions according to a meta-analysis. A meta-analysis of 43 studies reported that metacognitive training (MCT) reduces (paranoid) delusions at a medium to large effect size relative to control conditions.\nHistory.\nThe word \"paranoia\" comes from the Greek \u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03ac\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9\u03b1 (\"par\u00e1noia\"), \"madness\", and that from \u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03ac (\"par\u00e1\"), \"beside, by\" and \u03bd\u03cc\u03bf\u03c2 (\"n\u00f3os\"), \"mind\". The term was used to describe a mental illness in which a delusional belief is the sole or most prominent feature. In this definition, the belief does not have to be persecutory to be classified as paranoid, so any number of delusional beliefs can be classified as paranoia. For example, a person who has the sole delusional belief that they are an important religious figure would be classified by Kraepelin as having \"pure paranoia\". The word \"paranoia\" is associated from the Greek word \"para-noeo\". Its meaning was \"derangement\", or \"departure from the normal\". However, the word was used strictly and other words were used such as \"insanity\" or \"crazy\", as these words were introduced by Aulus Cornelius Celsus. The term \"paranoia\" first made an appearance during plays of Greek tragedians, and was also used by philosophers such as Plato and Hippocrates. Nevertheless, the word \"paranoia\" was the equivalent of \"delirium\" or \"high\". Eventually, the term fell out of use for two millennia. \"Paranoia\" was revived in the 18th century, appearing in the works of nosologists such as Fran\u00e7ois Boissier de Sauvage (1759) and Rudolph August Vogel (1772).\nAccording to Michael Phelan, Padraig Wright, and Julian Stern (2000), paranoia and paraphrenia are debated entities that were detached from \"dementia praecox\" by Kraepelin, who explained paranoia as a continuous systematized delusion arising much later in life with no presence of either hallucinations or a deteriorating course, and paraphrenia as an identical syndrome to paranoia but with hallucinations. Even at the present time, a delusion need not be suspicious or fearful to be classified as paranoid. A person might be diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia without delusions of persecution, simply because the delusions refer mainly to the self.\nRelations to violence.\nIt has generally been agreed upon that individuals with paranoid delusions will have the tendency to take action based on their beliefs. More research is needed on the particular types of actions that are pursued based on paranoid delusions. Some researchers have made attempts to distinguish the different variations of actions brought on as a result of delusions. Wessely et al. (1993) did just this by studying individuals with delusions of which more than half had reportedly taken action or behaved as a result of these delusions. However, the overall actions were not of a violent nature in most of the informants. The authors note that other studies such as one by Taylor (1985), have shown that violent behaviors were more common in certain types of paranoid individuals, mainly those considered to be offensive such as prisoners.\nOther researchers have found associations between childhood abusive behaviors and the appearance of violent behaviors in psychotic individuals. This could be a result of their inability to cope with aggression as well as other people, especially when constantly attending to potential threats in their environment. The attention to threat itself has been proposed as one of the major contributors of violent actions in paranoid people, although there has been much deliberation about this as well. Other studies have shown that there may only be certain types of delusions that promote any violent behaviors, persecutory delusions seem to be one of these.\nHaving resentful emotions towards others and the inability to understand what other people are feeling seem to have an association with violence in paranoid individuals. This was based on a study of people with paranoid schizophrenia (one of the common mental disorders that exhibit paranoid symptoms) theories of mind capabilities in relation to empathy. The results of this study revealed specifically that although the violent patients were more successful at the higher level theory of mind tasks, they were not as able to interpret others' emotions or claims.\nParanoid social cognition.\nSocial psychological research has proposed a mild form of paranoid cognition, \"paranoid social cognition\", that has its origins in social determinants more than intra-psychic conflict. This perspective states that in milder forms, paranoid cognitions may be very common among normal individuals. For instance, it is not considered strange to have self-centered thoughts of being talked about, or to be suspicious of others' intentions, or to assume ill-will or hostility (e.g., a feeling of everything going against them). According to Kramer (1998), these milder forms of paranoid cognition may be considered an adaptive response to cope with or make sense of a disturbing and threatening social environment.\nParanoid cognition captures the idea that dysphoric self-consciousness may be related to the position a person occupies in a social system. This self-consciousness conduces to a hypervigilant and ruminative mode to process social information that finally will stimulate a variety of paranoid-like forms of social misperception and misjudgment. This model identifies four components that are essential to understanding paranoid social cognition: situational antecedents, dysphoric self-consciousness, hypervigilance and rumination, and judgmental biases.\nSituational antecedents.\nPerceived social distinctiveness, perceived evaluative scrutiny and uncertainty about the social standing.\nDysphoric self-consciousness.\nAn aversive form of heightened 'public self-consciousness' is characterized by the feelings that one is under intensive evaluation or scrutiny. Becoming self-tormenting will increase the odds of interpreting others' behaviors in a self-referential way.\nHypervigilance and rumination.\nSelf-consciousness was characterized as an aversive psychological state. According to this model, people experiencing self-consciousness will be highly motivated to reduce it, trying to make sense of what they are experiencing. These attempts promote hypervigilance and rumination in a circular relationship: more hypervigilance generates more rumination, whereupon more rumination generates more hypervigilance. Hypervigilance can be thought of as a way to appraise threatening social information, but in contrast to adaptive vigilance, hypervigilance will produce elevated levels of arousal, fear, anxiety, and threat perception. Rumination is another possible response to threatening social information. Rumination can be related to the paranoid social cognition because it can increase negative thinking about negative events, and evoke a pessimistic explanatory style.\nJudgmental and cognitive biases.\nThree main judgmental consequences have been identified:\nMeta-analyses have confirmed that individuals with paranoia tend to jump to conclusions and are incorrigible in their judgements, even for delusion-neutral scenarios.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He is noted for his \"Histories\", a universal history documenting the rise of Rome in the Mediterranean in the third and second centuries BC. It covers the period 264\u2013146, recording in detail events in Italy, Iberia, Greece, Macedonia, Syria, Egypt and Africa, and documents the Punic Wars and Macedonian Wars among many others.\nPolybius's \"Histories\" is important not only for being the only Hellenistic historical work to survive in any substantial form, but also for its analysis of constitutional change and the mixed constitution. Polybius's discussion of the separation of powers in government, of checks and balances to limit power, and his introduction of \"the people\", all influenced Montesquieu's \"The Spirit of the Laws\", John Locke's \"Two Treatises of Government\", and the framers of the United States Constitution.\nPolybius was a close friend and mentor to the Roman politician and general Scipio Aemilianus (also called Scipio Africanus the Younger), and had a lasting influence on his decision-making and life.\nEarly life.\nPolybius was born around 200 BC in Megalopolis, Arcadia, when it was an active member of the Achaean League. The town was revived, along with other Achaean states, a century before he was born. His father, Lycortas, was a prominent, land-owning politician and member of the governing class who became \"strategos\" (commanding general) of the Achaean League. Consequently, Polybius was able to observe first-hand during his first 30 years the political and military affairs of Megalopolis, gaining experience as a statesman. In his early years, he accompanied his father while travelling as ambassador. He developed interests in equestrianism and hunting, diversions that later commended him to his Roman captors.\nIn 182 he was given the honour of carrying the funeral urn of Philopoemen, one of the most eminent Achaean politicians of his generation. In 170 or 169 Polybius was elected \"hipparchus\" (cavalry officer) and was due to assist Rome militarily during the Third Macedonian War, although this never came about. This office was the second-highest position of the Achaean League and often presaged election to the annual \"strategia\" (chief generalship). Polybius's political career was cut short in 168, however; as a consequence of the final defeat of the Antigonid dynasty in the Third Macedonian War, 1,000 Achaeans (including Polybius) with suspect allegiances were interned in Rome and its surrounding area.\nPersonal experiences.\nPolybius's father, Lycortas, was a prominent advocate of neutrality during the Roman war against Perseus of Macedon in 171\u2013168. Lycortas attracted the suspicion of the Romans, and Polybius subsequently was one of the 1,000 Achaean nobles who were transported to Rome as hostages in 167, and was detained there for 17 years. In Rome, by virtue of his high culture, Polybius was admitted to the most distinguished houses, in particular to that of Lucius Aemilius Paullus Macedonicus, the conqueror in the Third Macedonian War, who entrusted Polybius with the education of his sons, Fabius and Scipio Aemilianus (who had been adopted by the eldest son of Scipio Africanus). Polybius remained on cordial terms with his former pupil Scipio Aemilianus and was among the members of the Scipionic Circle.\nWhen Scipio defeated the Carthaginians in the Third Punic War, Polybius remained his counsellor. The Achaean hostages were released in 150, and Polybius was granted leave to return home, but the next year he went on campaign with Scipio Aemilianus to Africa, and was present at the Sack of Carthage in 146, which he later described. Following the destruction of Carthage, Polybius likely journeyed along the Atlantic coast of Africa, as well as Spain.\nAfter the destruction of Corinth in the same year, Polybius returned to Greece, making use of his Roman connections to lighten the conditions there. Polybius was charged with the difficult task of organizing the new form of government in the Greek cities, and in this office he gained great recognition.\nAt Rome.\nIn the succeeding years, Polybius resided in Rome, completing his historical work while occasionally undertaking long journeys through the Mediterranean countries in the furtherance of his history, in particular with the aim of obtaining firsthand knowledge of historical sites. He apparently interviewed veterans to clarify details of the events he was recording and was similarly given access to archival material. Little is known of Polybius's later life; he most likely accompanied Scipio to Spain, acting as his military advisor during the Numantine War.\nHe later wrote about this war in a lost monograph. Polybius probably returned to Greece later in his life, as evidenced by the many existent inscriptions and statues of him there. The last event mentioned in his \"Histories\" seems to be the construction of the Via Domitia in southern France in 118 BC, which suggests the writings of Pseudo-Lucian may have some grounding in fact when they state, \"[Polybius] fell from his horse while riding up from the country, fell ill as a result and died at the age of eighty-two\".\n\"The Histories\".\nThe \"Histories\" is a universal history which describes and explains the rise of the Roman Republic as a global power in the ancient Mediterranean world. The work documents in detail political and military affairs across the Hellenistic Mediterranean between 264 and 146 BC, and in its later books includes eyewitness accounts of the sack of Carthage and Corinth in 146 BC, and the Roman annexation of mainland Greece after the Achaean War.\nWhile Polybius's \"Histories\" covers the period from 264 BC to 146 BC, it focuses mainly on the years 221 to 146, detailing Rome's rise to supremacy in the Mediterranean by overcoming their geopolitical rivals: ancient Carthage, Macedonia, and the Seleucid Empire. Books I-II are \"The Histories\"' introduction, describing events in Italy and Greece before 221/0 BC, including the First Punic War, Rome's wars with the Gauls, the rise of the Achaean League (Polybius's own constitution), and the re-establishment of Macedonian power in Greece under Antigonus III Doson and Philip V of Macedon. Books III-XXXIX describe in detail political and military affairs in the leading Mediterranean states, including affairs in ancient Rome and ancient Carthage, ancient Greece and ancient Macedonia, and the Seleucid Empire and Egypt, explaining their increasing \"\u03c3\u03c5\u03bc\u03c0\u03bb\u03bf\u03ba\u03ae\" (symplok\u0113) or interconnectedness and how they each contributed to Rome's rise to dominance. Only books I-V survive in full; the rest are in varying states of fragmentation.\nThree discursive books on politics, historiography and geography break up the historical narrative:\nPolybius's sources.\nPolybius holds that historians should, if possible, only chronicle events whose participants the historian was able to interview, and was among the first to champion the notion of factual integrity in historical writing. He championed this by interviewing participants of the Second Punic War for the third volume of \"Histories,\" including some who knew Hannibal, a major Carthaginian participant. In the twelfth volume of his \"Histories\" he defines the historian's job as the analysis of documentation, the review of relevant geographical information, and political experience. In Polybius's time, the profession of a historian required political experience (which aided in differentiating between fact and fiction) and familiarity with the geography surrounding one's subject matter to supply an accurate version of events.\nPolybius himself exemplified these principles as he was well-travelled and possessed political and military experience. He consulted and used written sources providing essential material for the period between 264 and 220, including, for instance, treaty documents between Rome and Carthage in the First Punic War, the history of the third-century Greek historian Phylarchus, and the \"Memoirs\" of the Achaean politician, Aratus of Sicyon. When addressing events after 220, he continued to examine treaty documents, the writings of Greek and Roman historians and statesmen, eye-witness accounts and Macedonian court informants to acquire credible sources of information, although rarely did he name his sources. \nAs historian.\nPolybius wrote several works, most of which are lost. His earliest work was a biography of the Greek statesman Philopoemen; this work was later used as a source by Plutarch when composing his \"Parallel Lives\"; however, the original Polybian text is lost. In addition, Polybius wrote an extensive treatise entitled \"Tactics\", which may have detailed Roman and Greek military tactics. Small parts of this work may survive in his major \"Histories\", but the work itself is lost as well. Another missing work was a historical monograph on the events of the Numantine War. The largest Polybian work was his \"Histories\", of which only the first five books survive entirely intact, along with a large portion of the sixth book and fragments of the rest. Along with Cato the Elder (234\u2013149 BC), he can be considered one of the founding fathers of Roman historiography.\nLivy made reference to and uses Polybius's \"Histories\" as source material in his own narrative. Polybius was among the first historians to attempt to present history as a sequence of causes and effects, based upon a careful examination and criticism of tradition. He narrated his history based upon first-hand knowledge. The \"Histories\" capture the varied elements of the story of human behaviour: nationalism, xenophobia, duplicitous politics, war, brutality, loyalty, valour, intelligence, reason and resourcefulness.\nAside from the narrative of the historical events, Polybius also included three books of digressions. Book 34 was entirely devoted to questions of geography and included some trenchant criticisms of Eratosthenes, whom he accused of passing on popular preconceptions or \"laodogmatika\". Book 12 was a disquisition on the writing of history, citing extensive passages of lost historians, such as Callisthenes and Theopompus. Most influential was Book 6, which describes Roman political, military, and moral institutions, which he considered key to Rome's success; it presented Rome as having a mixed constitution in which monarchical, aristocratic and popular elements existed in stable equilibrium. This enabled Rome to escape, for the time being, the cycle of eternal revolutions (\"anacyclosis\") faced by those with singular constitutions (i.e. many of the Greeks and the Macedonians). While Polybius was not the first to advance this view, his account provides the most cogent illustration of the ideal for later political theorists.\nA key theme of the \"Histories\" is good leadership, and Polybius dedicates considerable time to outlining how the good statesman should be rational, knowledgeable, virtuous and composed. The character of the Polybian statesman is exemplified in that of Philip II of Macedon, who Polybius believed exhibited both excellent military prowess and skill, as well as proficient ability in diplomacy and moral leadership. His beliefs about Philip's character led Polybius to reject the historian Theopompus' description of Philip's private, drunken debauchery. For Polybius, it was inconceivable that such an able and effective statesman could have had an immoral and unrestrained private life as described by Theopompus. The consequences of bad leadership are also highlighted throughout the \"Histories\". Polybius saw, for instance, the character and leadership of the later Philip V of Macedon, one of Rome's leading adversaries in the Greek East, as the opposite of his earlier exemplary namesake. Philip V became increasingly tyrannical, irrational and impious following brilliant military and political success in his youth; this resulted, Polybius believed, in his abandonment by his Greek allies and his eventual defeat by Rome in 197 BC.\nOther important themes running throughout the \"Histories\" include the role of fortune in the affairs of nations, how a leader might weather bravely these changes of fortune with dignity, the educational value of history and how it should demonstrate cause and effect (or \"apodeiktike\") to provide lessons for statesmen, and that historians should be \"men of action\" to gain appropriate experience so as to understand how political and military affairs are likely to pan out (\"pragmatikoi\").\nPolybius is considered by some to be the successor of Thucydides in terms of objectivity and critical reasoning, and the forefather of scholarly, painstaking historical research in the modern scientific sense. According to this view, his work sets forth the course of history's occurrences with clearness, penetration, sound judgement, and, among the circumstances affecting the outcomes, he lays special emphasis on geographical conditions. Modern historians are especially impressed with the manner in which Polybius used his sources, particularly documentary evidence, as well as his citation and quotation of sources. Furthermore, there is some admiration for Polybius's meditation on the nature of historiography in Book 12. His work belongs, therefore, amongst the greatest productions of ancient historical writing. The writer of \"The Oxford Companion to Classical Literature\" (1937) praises him for his \"earnest devotion to truth\" and his systematic pursuit of causation.\nAs a hostage in Rome, then as client to the Scipios, and after 146 a collaborator with Roman rule, Polybius was probably in no position to freely express any negative opinions of Rome. The historian Peter Green advises that Polybius was chronicling Roman history for a Greek audience, to justify what he believed to be the inevitability of Roman rule. Nonetheless, Green considers Polybius's \"Histories\" the best source for the era they cover. For Ronald J. Mellor, Polybius was a loyal partisan of Scipio, intent on vilifying his patron's opponents. Adrian Goldsworthy, while using Polybius as a source for Scipio's generalship, notes Polybius's underlying and overt bias in Scipio's favour. H. Ormerod considers that Polybius cannot be regarded as an 'altogether unprejudiced witness' in relation to his \"b\u00eates noires\"; the Aetolians, the Carthaginians and the Cretans. Other historians perceive considerable negative bias in Polybius's account of Crete; on the other hand, Hansen notes that the same work, along with passages from Strabo and Scylax of Caryanda, proved a reliable guide in the eventual rediscovery of the lost city of Kydonia.\nCryptography.\nPolybius was responsible for a useful tool in telegraphy that allowed letters to be easily signaled using a numerical system, called \"the Polybius square,\" mentioned in https://. This idea also lends itself to cryptographic manipulation and steganography. Modern implementations of the Polybius square, at least in Western European languages such as English, Spanish, French, German and Italian, generally use the Roman alphabet in which those languages are written. However, Polybius himself was writing in Greek, and would have implemented his cipher square in the Greek alphabet. Both versions are shown here.\nIn the Polybius square, letters of the alphabet were arranged left to right, top to bottom in a 5 \u00d7 5 square. When used with the 26-letter Latin alphabet two letters, usually I and J, are combined. When used with the Greek alphabet, which has exactly one fewer letters than there are spaces (or code points) in the square, the final \"5,5\" code point encodes the spaces in between words. Alternatively, it can denote the end of a sentence or paragraph when writing in continuous script.\nFive numbers are then aligned on the outside top of the square, and five numbers on the left side of the square vertically. Usually these numbers were arranged 1 through 5. By cross-referencing the two numbers along the grid of the square, a letter could be deduced.\nIn the \"Histories\", Polybius specifies how this cypher could be used in fire signals, where long-range messages could be sent by means of torches raised and lowered to signify the column and row of each letter. This was a great leap forward from previous fire signalling, which could send prearranged codes only (such as, 'if we light the fire, it means that the enemy has arrived').\nOther writings of scientific interest include detailed discussions of the machines Archimedes created for the defence of Syracuse against the Romans, where Polybius praises the 'old man' and his engineering in the highest terms, and an analysis of the usefulness of astronomy to generals (both in the \"Histories\").\nInfluence.\nPolybius was considered a poor stylist by Dionysius of Halicarnassus, writing of Polybius's history that \"no one has the endurance to reach [its] end\". Nevertheless, clearly he was widely read by Romans and Greeks alike. He is quoted extensively by Strabo writing in the 1st century BC and Athenaeus in the 3rd century AD.\nHis emphasis on explaining causes of events, rather than just recounting events, influenced the historian Sempronius Asellio. Polybius is mentioned by Cicero and mined for information by Diodorus Siculus, Livy, Plutarch and Arrian. Much of the text that survives today from the later books of \"The Histories\" was preserved in Byzantine anthologies.\nHis works reappeared in the Western world first in Florence during the Italian Renaissance. Polybius gained a following in Italy, and although poor Latin translations hampered proper scholarship on his works, they contributed to the city's historical and political discourse. Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli in his \"Discourses on Livy\" evinces familiarity with Polybius. Vernacular translations in French, German, Italian and English first appeared during the 16th century. Consequently, in the late 16th century, Polybius's works found a greater reading audience among the learned public. Study of the correspondence of such men as Isaac Casaubon, Jacques Auguste de Thou, William Camden and Paolo Sarpi reveals a growing interest in Polybius's works and thought during the period. Despite the existence of both printed editions in the vernacular and increased scholarly interest, however, Polybius remained a \"historian's historian\", not much read by the public at large.\nPrintings of his work in the vernacular remained few in number\u2014seven in French, five in English (John Dryden provided an enthusiastic preface to Sir Henry Sheers' edition of 1693) and five in Italian.\nPolybius's political analysis has influenced republican thinkers from Cicero to Montesquieu to the Founding Fathers of the United States. John Adams, for example, considered him one of the most important teachers of constitutional theory. Since the Age of Enlightenment, Polybius has in general held appeal to those interested in Hellenistic Greece and early Republican Rome, while his political and military writings have lost influence in academia. More recently, thorough work on the Greek text of Polybius, and his historical technique, has increased the academic understanding and appreciation of him as a historian.\nAccording to Dawn Finley and Virginia Tufte, he was also a major source for Charles Joseph Minard's figurative map of Hannibal's overland journey to Italy during the Second Punic War.\nIn his \"Meditations On Hunting\", the Spanish philosopher Jos\u00e9 Ortega y Gasset calls Polybius \"one of the few great minds that the turbid human species has managed to produce\", and says the damage to the \"Histories\" is \"without question one of the gravest losses that we have suffered in our Greco-Roman heritage\".\nThe Italian version of his name, Polibio, was used as a male first name\u2014for example, the composer Polibio Fumagalli\u2014though it never became very common.\nThe University of Pennsylvania has an intellectual society, the Polybian Society, which is named in his honour and serves as a non-partisan forum for discussing societal issues and policy.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "24517", "revid": "45203278", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24517", "title": "Plutarch", "text": "Greek philosopher and historian (c. AD 40 \u2013 120s)\nPlutarch (; , \"Plo\u00fatarchos\", ; c.\u2009AD\u00a040 \u2013 120s) was a Greek and later Roman Middle Platonist philosopher, historian, biographer, essayist, and priest at the Temple of Apollo in Delphi. He is known primarily for his \"Parallel Lives\", a series of biographies of illustrious Greeks and Romans, and \"Moralia\", a collection of essays and speeches. Upon becoming a Roman citizen, he was possibly named Lucius Mestrius Plutarchus ().\nFamily.\nPlutarch was born to a prominent family in the small town of Chaeronea, about east of Delphi, in the Greek region of Boeotia. His family was long established in the town; his father was named Autobulus and his grandfather was named Lamprias. His brothers, Timon and Lamprias, are frequently mentioned in his essays and dialogues, which speak of Timon in particular in the most affectionate terms.\nStudies and life.\nPlutarch studied mathematics and philosophy in Athens under Ammonius from AD\u00a066 to 67. He attended the games of Delphi where the emperor Nero competed and possibly met prominent Romans, including future emperor Vespasian. At some point, Plutarch received Roman citizenship. His sponsor was Lucius Mestrius Florus, who was an associate of the new emperor Vespasian, as evidenced by his new name, Lucius Mestrius Plutarchus. As a Roman citizen, Plutarch would have been of the equestrian order. He visited Rome some time c.\u2009AD 70 with Florus, who served also as a historical source for his \"Life of Otho\". Plutarch was on familiar terms with a number of Roman nobles, particularly the consulars Quintus Sosius Senecio, Titus Avidius Quietus, and Arulenus Rusticus, all of whom appear in his works.\nPlutarch lived most of his life at Chaeronea, and was initiated into the mysteries of the Greek god Apollo. He probably took part in the Eleusinian Mysteries. During his visit to Rome, he may have been part of a municipal embassy for Delphi: around the same time, Vespasian granted Delphi various municipal rights and privileges. Some time c.\u2009AD 95, Plutarch was made one of the two sanctuary priests for the temple of Apollo at Delphi; the site had declined considerably since the classical Greek period. Around the same time in the 90s, Delphi experienced a construction boom, financed by Greek patrons and possible imperial support. There was a portrait bust dedicated to Plutarch for his efforts in helping to revive the Delphic shrines. The portrait of a philosopher exhibited at the exit of the Archaeological Museum of Delphi dates to the 2nd\u00a0century; due to its inscription, in the past it had been identified with Plutarch. The man, although bearded, is depicted at a relatively young age: His hair and beard are rendered in coarse volumes and thin incisions. The gaze is deep, due to the heavy eyelids and the incised pupils. A fragmentary hermaic stele \"next\" to the portrait probably did once bear a portrait of Plutarch, since it is inscribed, \"The Delphians, along with the Chaeroneans, dedicated this (image of) Plutarch, following the precepts of the Amphictyony\" ( | \").\nIn addition to his duties as a priest of the Delphic temple, Plutarch was also a magistrate at Chaeronea and he represented his home town on various missions to foreign countries during his early adult years. Plutarch held the office of archon in his native municipality, probably only an annual one which he likely served more than once. Plutarch was epimeletes (manager) of the Amphictyonic League for at least five terms, from 107 to 127, in which role he was responsible for organising the Pythian Games. He mentions this service in his work, \"Whether an Old Man Should Engage in Public Affairs\" (17 = \"Moralia\" 792f). The \"Suda\", a medieval Greek encyclopedia, states that Trajan made Plutarch procurator of Illyria; most historians consider this unlikely, since Illyria was not a procuratorial province. According to the 8th/9th-century historian George Syncellus, late in Plutarch's life, Emperor Hadrian appointed him nominal procurator of Achaea \u2013 which entitled him to wear the vestments and ornaments of a consul.\nPlutarch and his wife, Timoxena, had at least four sons and one daughter, although two died in childhood. A letter is still extant, addressed by Plutarch to his wife, bidding her not to grieve too much at the death of their two-year-old daughter, who was named Timoxena after her mother, which also mentions the loss of a young son, Chaeron. Two sons, named Autoboulos and Plutarch, appear in a number of Plutarch's works; Plutarch's treatise on Plato's \"Timaeus\" is dedicated to them. It is likely that a third son, named Soklaros after Plutarch's confidant Soklaros of Tithora, survived to adulthood as well, although he is not mentioned in Plutarch's later works; a Lucius Mestrius Soclarus, who shares Plutarch's Latin family name, appears in an inscription in Boeotia from the time of Trajan. Traditionally, the surviving catalog of Plutarch's works is ascribed to another son, named Lamprias after Plutarch's grandfather; most modern scholars believe this tradition is a later interpolation. His family remained in Greece down to at least the fourth century, producing a number of philosophers and authors. Apuleius, author of \"The Golden Ass\", made his fictional protagonist a descendant of Plutarch.\nIt is not known in which year Plutarch died. Gregory Crane estimates that he died c. 125, while the 1911 edition of Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica estimates that he died c. 120. As of the 21st century, Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica gives Plutarch's death year as \"after 119\".\nWorks.\n\"Parallel Lives\".\nPlutarch's best-known work is the \"Parallel Lives\", a series of biographies of illustrious Greeks and Romans, arranged in pairs to illuminate their common moral virtues and vices, thus it being more of an insight into human nature than a historical account. As is explained in the opening paragraph of his \"Life of Alexander\", Plutarch was not concerned with history so much as the influence of character, good or bad, on the lives and destinies of men. Whereas sometimes he barely touched on epoch-making events, he devoted much space to charming anecdote and incidental triviality, reasoning that this often said far more for his subjects than even their most famous accomplishments. He sought to provide rounded portraits, likening his craft to that of a painter; indeed, he went to tremendous lengths (often leading to tenuous comparisons) to draw parallels between physical appearance and moral character.\nThe surviving \"Lives\" contain 23 pairs, each with one Greek life and one Roman life, as well as four unpaired single lives. Some of the \"Lives\", such as those of Heracles, Philip II of Macedon, Epaminondas, Scipio Africanus, Scipio Aemilianus and possibly Quintus Caecilius Metellus Numidicus no longer exist; many of the remaining \"Lives\" are truncated, contain obvious lacunae or have been tampered with by later writers.\nExtant \"Lives\" include those on Solon, Themistocles, Aristides, Agesilaus II, Pericles, Alcibiades, Nicias, Demosthenes, Pelopidas, Philopoemen, Timoleon, Dion of Syracuse, Eumenes, Alexander the Great, Pyrrhus of Epirus, Romulus, Numa Pompilius, Coriolanus, Theseus, Aemilius Paullus, Tiberius Gracchus, Gaius Gracchus, Gaius Marius, Sulla, Sertorius, Lucullus, Pompey, Julius Caesar, Cicero, Cato the Elder, Cato the Younger, Mark Antony, and Marcus Junius Brutus.\n\"Life of Alexander\".\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"It is not \"histories\" I am writing, but \"lives\"; and in the most glorious deeds there is not always an indication of virtue or vice, indeed a small thing like a phrase or a jest often makes a greater revelation of a character than battles where thousands die.\"\n\"Life of Alexander\"\nPlutarch's \"Life of Alexander\", written as a parallel to that of Julius Caesar, is one of five extant tertiary sources on the Macedonian conqueror Alexander the Great. It includes anecdotes and descriptions of events that appear in no other source, just as Plutarch's portrait of Numa Pompilius, the putative second king of Rome, holds much that is unique on the early Roman calendar. Plutarch devotes a great deal of space to Alexander's drive and desire, and strives to determine how much of it was presaged in his youth. He also draws extensively on the work of Lysippos, Alexander's favourite sculptor, to provide what is probably the fullest and most accurate description of the conqueror's physical appearance. When it comes to his character, Plutarch emphasizes his unusual degree of self-control and scorn for luxury: \"He desired not pleasure or wealth, but only excellence and glory.\" As the narrative progresses, the subject incurs less admiration from his biographer and the deeds that it recounts become less savoury. The murder of Cleitus the Black, which Alexander instantly and deeply regretted, is commonly cited to this end.\n\"Life of Caesar\".\nTogether with Suetonius's \"The Twelve Caesars\", and Caesar's own works \"de Bello Gallico\" and \"de Bello Civili\", the \"Life of Caesar\" is the main account of Julius Caesar's feats by ancient historians. Plutarch starts by telling of the audacity of Caesar and his refusal to dismiss Cinna's daughter, Cornelia. Other important parts are those containing his military deeds, accounts of battles and Caesar's capacity of inspiring the soldiers.\nPlutarch's life shows few differences from Suetonius' work and Caesar's own works (see \"De Bello Gallico\" and \"De Bello Civili\"). Sometimes, Plutarch quotes directly from the \"De Bello Gallico\" and even tells us of the moments when Caesar was dictating his works. In the final part of this life, Plutarch recounts details of Caesar's assassination. It ends by telling the destiny of his murderers, just after a detailed account of the scene when a phantom appeared to Brutus at night.\n\"Life of Pyrrhus\".\nPlutarch's \"Life of Pyrrhus\" is a key text because it is the main historical account on Roman history for the period from 293 to 264\u00a0BCE, for which both Dionysius' and Livy's texts are lost.\n\"Moralia\".\nThe remainder of Plutarch's surviving work is collected under the title of the \"Moralia\" (loosely translated as \"Customs and Mores\"). It is an eclectic collection of seventy-eight essays and transcribed speeches, including \"Concerning the Face Which Appears in the Orb of the Moon\" (a dialogue on the possible causes for such an appearance and a source for Galileo's own work), \"On Fraternal Affection\" (a discourse on honour and affection of siblings toward each other), \"On the Fortune or the Virtue of Alexander the Great\" (an important adjunct to his Life of the great king), and \"On the Worship of Isis and Osiris\" (a crucial source of information on ancient Egyptian religion); more philosophical treatises, such as \"On the Decline of the Oracles\", \"On the Delays of the Divine Vengeance\", and \"On Peace of Mind\"; and lighter fare, such as \"Odysseus and Gryllus\", a humorous dialogue between Homer's Odysseus and one of Circe's enchanted pigs.\nPseudepigrapha.\nSome editions of the \"Moralia\" include several works now known to have been falsely attributed to Plutarch. Among these are the \"Lives of the Ten Orators\", a series of biographies of the Attic orators based on Caecilius of Calacte; \"On the Opinions of the Philosophers\", \"On Fate\", and \"On Music\". These works are all attributed to a single, unknown author, referred to as \"Pseudo-Plutarch\". Pseudo-Plutarch lived sometime between the third and fourth centuries AD. Despite being falsely attributed, the works are still considered to possess historical value.\nLives of the Roman emperors.\nPlutarch's first biographical works were the Lives of the Roman Emperors from Augustus to Vitellius. These early emperors' biographies were probably published under the Flavian dynasty or during the reign of Nerva (AD 96\u201398). Of these, only the Lives of Galba and Otho survive. The Lives of Tiberius and Nero are extant only as fragments, provided by Damascius as well as Plutarch himself, respectively. There is reason to believe that the two Lives still extant, those of Galba and Otho, \"ought to be considered as a single work.\" Therefore, they do not form a part of the Plutarchian canon of single biographies \u2013 as represented by the Life of Aratus of Sicyon and the Life of Artaxerxes II (the biographies of Hesiod, Pindar, Crates and Daiphantus were lost). \"Galba-Otho\" can be found in the appendix to Plutarch's \"Parallel Lives\" as well as in various Moralia manuscripts, most prominently in Maximus Planudes' edition where Galba and Otho appear as \"Opera\" XXV and XXVI. Thus it seems reasonable to maintain that \"Galba-Otho\" was from early on considered as an illustration of a moral-ethical approach.\nLost works.\nThe lost works of Plutarch are determined by references in his own texts to them and from other authors' references over time. Parts of the \"Lives\" and what would be considered parts of the \"Moralia\" have been lost. The 'Catalogue of Lamprias', an ancient list of works attributed to Plutarch, lists 227 works, of which 78 have come down to us. The Romans loved the \"Lives\". Enough copies were written out over the centuries so that a copy of most of the lives has survived to the present day, but there are traces of twelve more Lives that are now lost. Plutarch's general procedure for the \"Lives\" was to write the life of a prominent Greek, then cast about for a suitable Roman parallel, and end with a brief comparison of the Greek and Roman lives. Currently, only 19 of the parallel lives end with a comparison, while possibly they all did at one time. Also missing are many of his \"Lives\" which appear in a list of his writings: those of Hercules, the first pair of \"Parallel Lives\", Scipio Africanus and Epaminondas, and the companions to the four solo biographies, as well as biographies of important figures such as Augustus, Claudius and Nero. Lost works that would have been part of the \"Moralia\" include \"Whether One Who Suspends Judgment on Everything Is Condemned to Inaction\", \"On Pyrrho's Ten Modes\", and \"On the Difference between the Pyrrhonians and the Academics\".\nPhilosophy.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"The soul, being eternal, after death is like a caged bird that has been released. If it has been a long time in the body, and has become tame by many affairs and long habit, the soul will immediately take another body and once again become involved in the troubles of the world. The worst thing about old age is that the soul's memory of the other world grows dim, while at the same time its attachment to things of this world becomes so strong that the soul tends to retain the form that it had in the body. But that soul which remains only a short time within a body, until liberated by the higher powers, quickly recovers its fire and goes on to higher things.\"\nPlutarch (\"The Consolation\", \"Moralia\")\nPlutarch was a Platonist, but was open to the influence of the Peripatetics, and in some details even to Stoicism despite his criticism of their principles. He rejected only Epicureanism absolutely. He attached little importance to theoretical questions and doubted the possibility of ever solving them. He was more interested in moral and religious questions.\nIn opposition to Stoic materialism and Epicurean atheism he cherished a pure idea of God that was more in accordance with Plato. He adopted a second principle (\"Dyad\") in order to explain the phenomenal world. This principle he sought, however, not in any indeterminate matter but in the evil world-soul which has from the beginning been bound up with matter, but in the creation was filled with reason and arranged by it. Thus it was transformed into the divine soul of the world, but continued to operate as the source of all evil. He elevated God above the finite world, and thus daemons became for him agents of God's influence on the world. He strongly defends freedom of the will, and the immortality of the soul.\nPlatonic-Peripatetic ethics were upheld by Plutarch against the opposing theories of the Stoics and Epicureans. The most characteristic feature of Plutarch's ethics is its close connection with religion. However pure Plutarch's idea of God is, and however vivid his description of the vice and corruption which superstition causes, his warm religious feelings and his distrust of human powers of knowledge led him to believe that God comes to our aid by direct revelations, which we perceive the more clearly the more completely that we refrain in \"enthusiasm\" from all action; this made it possible for him to justify popular belief in divination in the way which had long been usual among the Stoics.\nHis attitude to popular religion was similar. The gods of different peoples are merely different names for one and the same divine Being and the powers that serve it. The myths contain philosophical truths which can be interpreted allegorically. Thus, Plutarch sought to combine the philosophical and religious conception of things and to remain as close as possible to tradition. Plutarch was the teacher of Favorinus.\nPlutarch was a vegetarian, although how long and how strictly he adhered to this diet is unclear. He wrote about the ethics of meat-eating in two discourses in \"Moralia\".\nInfluence.\nThere are multiple translations of \"Parallel Lives\" into Latin, most notably the one titled \"Pour le Dauphin\" (French for \"for the Crown Prince\") written by a scribe in the court of Louis XV of France, and a 1470 Ulrich Han translation. In 1519, Hieronymus Emser translated \"De capienda ex inimicis utilitate\" (\"wie ym eyner seinen veyndt nutz machen kan\", Leipzig). The biographies were translated by Gottlob Benedict von Schirach (1743\u20131804) and printed in Vienna by Franz Haas (1776\u20131780). Plutarch's \"Lives\" and \"Moralia\" were translated into German by Johann Friedrich Salomon Kaltwasser.\nFrance and England.\nPlutarch's writings had an enormous influence on English and French literature.\nMontaigne's \"Essays\" draw extensively on Plutarch's \"Moralia\" and are consciously modelled on the Greek's easygoing and discursive inquiries into science, manners, customs and beliefs. \"Essays\" contains more than 400 references to Plutarch and his works.\nJacques Amyot's translations brought Plutarch's works to French readers. He went to Italy and studied the Vatican text of Plutarch, from which he published a French translation of the \"Lives\" in 1559 and \"Moralia\" in 1572, which were widely read by educated Europe. Amyot's translations had as deep an impression in England as France, because Sir Thomas North later published his English translation of the \"Lives\" in 1579 based on Amyot's French translation instead of the original Greek. Shakespeare paraphrased parts of Thomas North's translation of selected \"Lives\" in his plays, and occasionally quoted from them verbatim.\nThe complete \"Moralia\" was first translated into English from the original Greek by Philemon Holland in 1603. In 1683, John Dryden began a life of Plutarch and oversaw a translation of the \"Lives\" by several hands and based on the original Greek. This translation has been reworked and revised several times, most recently in the 19th century by the English poet and classicist Arthur Hugh Clough (first published in 1859). One contemporary publisher of this version is Modern Library. Another is \"Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica\" in association with the University of Chicago, , 1952, . In 1770, English brothers John and William Langhorne published \"Plutarch's \"Lives\" from the original Greek, with notes critical and historical, and a new life of Plutarch\" in 6 volumes and dedicated to Lord Folkestone. Their translation was re-edited by Archdeacon Wrangham in the year 1813.\nJean-Jacques Rousseau quotes from Plutarch in the 1762 \"Emile, or On Education\", a treatise on the education of the whole person for citizenship. Rousseau introduces a passage from Plutarch in support of his position against eating meat: \"'You ask me', said Plutarch, 'why Pythagoras abstained from eating the flesh of beasts...'\"\nJames Boswell quoted Plutarch on writing lives, rather than biographies, in the introduction to his own \"Life of Samuel Johnson\".\nAmerica.\nPlutarch is the most frequently named of the ancient historians in the Federalist Papers. Ralph Waldo Emerson and the transcendentalists were greatly influenced by the \"Moralia\" and in his glowing introduction to the five-volume, 19th-century edition, he called the \"Lives\" \"a bible for heroes\".\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He first came to prominence with his performances on the BBC Radio comedy series \"The Goon Show\". Sellers was featured on a number of hit comic songs and became internationally acclaimed for his film roles, most notably as Chief Inspector Clouseau in \"The Pink Panther\" series.\nSellers made his stage debut at the Kings Theatre, Southsea, as an infant, and began accompanying his parents in a touring variety act. He worked as a drummer and toured around England as a member of the Entertainments National Service Association (ENSA). He developed his mimicry and improvisational skills during a spell in Ralph Reader's wartime Gang Show entertainment troupe. After the war, Sellers made his radio debut in \"ShowTime\", and eventually became a regular performer on various BBC Radio shows. During the early 1950s, Sellers, along with Spike Milligan, Harry Secombe, and Michael Bentine, took part in the successful radio series \"The Goon Show\", which ended in 1960.\nSellers began his film career during the 1950s. Although the bulk of his work was comedic, often parodying characters of authority such as military officers or policemen; he also performed in other film genres. Films demonstrating his artistic range include \"The Mouse That Roared\" and \"I'm All Right Jack\" (both 1959), Stanley Kubrick's \"Lolita\" (1962) and \"Dr. Strangelove\" (1964), \"What's New Pussycat?\" (1965), \"Casino Royale\" (1967), \"The Party\" (1968), \"Being There\" (1979) and five films of the \"Pink Panther\" series (1963\u20131978). Sellers's versatility enabled him to portray a wide range of comic characters using different accents and guises, and he would often assume multiple roles within the same film, frequently with contrasting temperaments and styles. Satire and black humour were major features of many of his films, as they had been in his radio and record performances. These performances had a strong influence on a number of later comedians. \nSellers was nominated three times for an Academy Award, twice for Best Actor, for his performances in \"Dr. Strangelove\" and \"Being There\", and once for the Best Live Action Short Film for \"The Running Jumping &amp; Standing Still Film\" (1959). He won the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role for his role in \"I'm All Right Jack\" and was nominated an additional three times for the satire \"Only Two Can Play\", for \"Dr. Strangelove\" and \"The Pink Panther\", and for \"Being There\". In 1980 he won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Motion Picture \u2013 Musical or Comedy for his role in \"Being There\", having previously been nominated three times in the same category. Turner Classic Movies calls Sellers \"one of the most accomplished comic actors of the late 20th century\".\nIn his personal life, Sellers struggled with depression and insecurities. An enigmatic figure, he often claimed to have no identity outside the roles that he played. His behaviour was often erratic and compulsive, and he frequently clashed with his directors and co-stars, especially in the mid-1970s, when his physical and mental health, together with his alcohol and drug problems, were at their worst. Sellers was married four times and had three children from his first two marriages. He died from a heart attack, aged 54, in 1980. English filmmakers the Boulting brothers described Sellers as \"the greatest comic genius this country has produced since Charles Chaplin\".\nLife and career.\n1925\u20131939: Early life and career beginnings.\nSellers was born on 8 September 1925 in Southsea, a suburb of Portsmouth. His parents were Yorkshire-born William \"Bill\" Sellers and Agnes Doreen \"Peg\" (n\u00e9e Marks). Both were variety entertainers; Peg was in the Ray Sisters troupe. Although he was christened Richard Henry, his parents called him Peter, after his elder brother, who was stillborn. Sellers had no other siblings. Peg Sellers was related to the pugilist Daniel Mendoza, whom Sellers greatly revered and whose engraving later hung in his office. At one time Sellers planned to use Mendoza's image for his production company's logo.\nSellers was two weeks old when he was carried on stage by Dick Henderson, the headline act at the Kings Theatre in Southsea: the crowd sang \"For He's a Jolly Good Fellow\", which caused the infant to cry. The family constantly toured, causing much upheaval and unhappiness in the young Sellers's life.\nSellers maintained a very close relationship with his mother, which his friend Spike Milligan later considered unhealthy for a grown man. Sellers's agent, Dennis Selinger, recalled his first meeting with Peg and Peter Sellers, noting that \"Sellers was an immensely shy young man, inclined to be dominated by his mother, but without resentment or objection\". As an only child, he spent much time alone.\nIn 1935 the Sellers family moved to North London and settled in Muswell Hill. Although Bill Sellers was Protestant and Peg was Jewish, Sellers attended the nearby Roman Catholic school St Aloysius' College in Highgate, run by the Brothers of Our Lady of Mercy. The family was not rich, but Peg insisted on an expensive private schooling for her son. According to biographer Peter Evans, Sellers was fascinated, puzzled, and worried by religion from a young age, particularly Catholicism; Roger Lewis believed that soon after entering Catholic school, Sellers \"discovered he was a Jew\u2014he was someone on the outside of the mysteries of faith\". Later in his life, Sellers observed that while his father's faith was according to the Church of England, his mother was Jewish, \"and Jews take the faith of their mother.\" \nAccording to Milligan, Sellers felt a sense of guilt about being Jewish and recalls that Sellers was once reduced to tears when he presented him with a candlestick from a synagogue for Christmas, believing the gesture to be an anti-Jewish slur. Sellers became a top student at the school, excelling in drawing in particular. He was prone to laziness, but his natural talents shielded him from criticism by his teachers. Sellers recalled that a teacher scolded the other boys for not studying, saying: \"The Jewish boy knows his catechism better than the rest of you!\"\nAccompanying his family on the variety show circuit, Sellers learned stagecraft but received conflicting encouragement from his parents and developed mixed feelings about show business. His father doubted Sellers's abilities in the entertainment field, even suggesting that his son's talents were only enough to become a road sweeper, while Sellers's mother encouraged him continuously. While at St Aloysius' College, Sellers began to develop his improvisational skills. He and his closest friend at the time, Bryan Connon, both enjoyed listening to early radio comedy shows. Connon remembers that \"Peter got endless pleasure imitating the people in \"Monday Night at Eight\". He had a gift for improvising dialogue. Sketches, too. I'd be the 'straight man', the 'feed',\u00a0... I'd cue Peter and he'd do all the radio personalities and chuck in a few voices of his own invention as well.\"\n1939\u20131945: War years.\nWith the outbreak of the Second World War, St Aloysius' College was evacuated to Cambridgeshire. Because his mother did not allow Sellers to go, his formal education ended at fourteen. Early in 1940, the family moved to the north Devon town of Ilfracombe, where Sellers's maternal uncle managed the Victoria Palace Theatre; Sellers got his first job at the theatre, aged fifteen, starting as a caretaker. He was steadily promoted, becoming a box office clerk, usher, assistant stage manager, and lighting operator. He was also offered some small acting parts. Working backstage gave him a chance to study actors such as Paul Scofield. He became close friends with Derek Altman, and together they launched Sellers's first stage act under the name \"Altman and Sellers\", consisting of playing ukuleles, singing, and telling jokes.\nDuring his backstage theatre job, Sellers began practising on a set of drums that belonged to the band Joe Daniels and his Hot Shots. Daniels noticed his efforts and gave him practical instructions. The instrument greatly suited Sellers's temperament and artistic skills. Spike Milligan later noted that Sellers was very proficient on the drums and might have remained a jazz drummer had he lacked his skills in mimicry and improvisation. As the war progressed, Sellers continued to develop his drumming skills and played with a series of touring bands, including those of Oscar Rabin, Henry Hall, and Waldini, as well as his father's quartet, before he left and joined a band from Blackpool. Sellers became a member of the Entertainments National Service Association (ENSA), which provided entertainment for British forces and factory workers during the war. Sellers also performed comedy routines at these concerts, including impersonations of George Formby, with Sellers accompanying his own singing on ukulele.\nIn September 1943 he joined the Royal Air Force, although it is unclear whether he volunteered or was conscripted; his mother unsuccessfully tried to have him deferred on medical grounds. Sellers wanted to become a pilot, but his poor eyesight restricted him to ground staff duties. He found these duties dull, so he auditioned for Squadron Leader Ralph Reader's RAF \"Gang Show\" entertainment troupe. Reader accepted him and Sellers toured the UK before the troupe was transferred to India. His tour also included Ceylon and Burma, although the duration of his stay in Asia is unknown, and Sellers may have exaggerated its length. He also served in Germany and France after the war.\nAccording to David Lodge, who became friends with Sellers, he was \"one of the best performers ever\" on the drums and developed a fine ability to impersonate military officers during this period.\n1946\u20131955: Early post-war work, \"The Goon Show\", and first marriage.\nIn 1946 Sellers made his final show with ENSA, starring in the pantomime \"Jack and the Beanstalk\" at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Marigny in Paris. He was posted back to England shortly afterwards to work at the Air Ministry and demobilised later that year. On resuming his theatrical career, Sellers could get only sporadic work. He was dismissed after one performance of a comedy routine in Peterborough; the headline act, Welsh vocalist Dorothy Squires, however, persuaded the management to reinstate him. Sellers also continued his drumming and was billed on his appearance at The Hippodrome in Aldershot as \"Britain's answer to Gene Krupa\". In March 1948 Sellers gained a six-week run at the Windmill Theatre in London, which predominantly staged revue acts; he provided the comedy turns between the nude shows on offer.\nSellers wrote to the BBC in 1948 and was subsequently auditioned. As a result, he made his television debut on 18 March 1948 in \"New To You\". His act, largely based on impressions, was well received, and he returned the following week. Frustrated with the slow pace of his career, Sellers telephoned BBC radio producer Roy Speer, pretending to be Kenneth Horne, star of the radio show \"Much-Binding-in-the-Marsh\". Speer called Sellers a \"cheeky young sod\" for his efforts but gave him an audition. This led to his brief appearance on 1 July 1948 on \"ShowTime\" and subsequently to work on \"Ray's a Laugh\" with comedian Ted Ray. In October 1948, Sellers was a regular radio performer, appearing in \"Starlight Hour\", \"The Gang Show\", \"Henry Hall's Guest Night\" and \"It's Fine To Be Young\".\nBy the end of 1948, the BBC Third Programme began to broadcast the comedy series \"Third Division\", which starred, among others, Harry Secombe, Michael Bentine, and Sellers. One evening, Sellers and Bentine visited the Hackney Empire, where Secombe was performing, and Bentine introduced Sellers to Spike Milligan. The four would meet up at Grafton's public house near Victoria, owned by Jimmy Grafton, who was also a BBC scriptwriter. The four comedians dubbed him \"KOGVOS\" (Keeper of Goons and Voice of Sanity). Grafton later edited some of the first \"Goon Shows\".\nIn 1949 Sellers started to date Anne Howe, an Australian actress who lived in London. He proposed to her in April 1950, and the couple were married in London on 15 September 1951; their son, Michael, was born on 2 April 1954, and their daughter, Sarah, followed in 1958. Sellers's introduction to film work came in 1950, when he dubbed the voice of Alfonso Bedoya in \"The Black Rose\". He continued to work with Bentine, Milligan, and Secombe. On 3 February 1951, they made a trial tape entitled \"The Goons\" and sent it to the BBC producer Pat Dixon, who eventually accepted it. The first \"Goon Show\" was broadcast on 28 May 1951. Against their wishes, they appeared under the name \"Crazy People\". \nSellers appeared until the last programme of the ten-series run, broadcast on 28 January 1960. Sellers played four main characters\u2014Major Bloodnok, Hercules Grytpype-Thynne, Bluebottle, and Henry Crun\u2014and seventeen minor ones. Starting with 370,000 listeners, the show eventually reached up to seven million people in Britain and was described by one newspaper as \"probably the most influential comedy show of all time\". For Sellers, the BBC considers it had the effect of launching his career \"on the road to stardom\".\nIn 1951 the Goons made their feature film debut in \"Penny Points to Paradise\". Sellers and Milligan then wrote the script for \"Let's Go Crazy\", the earliest film to showcase Sellers's ability to portray a series of different characters within the same film, and he made another appearance opposite his Goons co-stars in the 1952 flop, \"Down Among the Z Men\". In 1954, Sellers was cast opposite Sid James, Tony Hancock, Raymond Huntley, Donald Pleasence, and Eric Sykes in the British Lion Film Corporation comedy production, \"Orders Are Orders\". John Grierson believes that this was Sellers's breakthrough role on screen and credits this film with launching the film careers of both Sellers and Hancock.\n1956\u20131959: \"I'm All Right Jack\" and early films.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe first real film I made was \"The Ladykillers\". I used to watch Alec Guinness, who is an absolute idol of mine, do everything, his rehearsals, his scenes, everything. He is my ideal ... and my idol.\n\u2014 Sellers on studying Sir Alec Guinness during filming \"The Ladykillers\"\nSellers pursued a film career and took a number of small roles, such as a police officer in \"John and Julie\" (1955). He accepted a larger part in the 1955 Alexander Mackendrick-directed Ealing comedy \"The Ladykillers\", in which he starred opposite his idol Alec Guinness, in addition to Herbert Lom and Cecil Parker. Sellers portrayed Harry Robinson, the Teddy Boy; biographer Peter Evans considers this Sellers's first good role. \"The Ladykillers\" was a success in the UK and the US, and the film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay. The following year Sellers appeared in a further three television series based on \"The Goons\": \"The Idiot Weekly, Price 2d\"; \"A Show Called Fred\"; and \"Son of Fred\". The shows aired on Britain's new ITV channel. \nIn 1957 film producer Michael Relph, impressed with Sellers's portrayal of an elderly character in \"Idiot Weekly\", cast the 32-year-old actor as a 68-year-old projectionist in Basil Dearden's \"The Smallest Show on Earth\", supporting Bill Travers, Virginia McKenna, and Margaret Rutherford. The film was a commercial success and is now thought of as a minor classic of post-war British screen comedy. Sellers provided the growling voice of Winston Churchill to the BAFTA award-winning film \"The Man Who Never Was\". Later in 1957 Sellers portrayed a television star with a talent for disguises in Mario Zampi's offbeat black comedy \"The Naked Truth\", opposite Terry-Thomas, Peggy Mount, Shirley Eaton, and Dennis Price.\nSellers's difficulties in getting his film career to take off and increasing problems in his personal life prompted him to seek periodic consultations with astrologer Maurice Woodruff, who held considerable sway over his later career. After a chance meeting with a North American Indian spirit guide in the 1950s, Sellers became convinced that the music hall comedian Dan Leno, who had died in 1904, haunted him and guided his career and life decisions. Sellers was a member of the Grand Order of Water Rats, the exclusive theatrical fraternity founded by Leno in 1890. In 1958 Sellers starred with David Tomlinson, Wilfrid Hyde-White, David Lodge, and Lionel Jeffries as a chief petty officer in Val Guest's \"Up the Creek\". \nGuest later said he had written and directed the film as a vehicle for Sellers and thus had started Sellers's film career. To practise his voice, Sellers purchased a reel-to-reel tape recorder. The film received critical acclaim in the United States, and Roger Lewis viewed it as an important practice ground for Sellers. Next, Sellers featured with Terry-Thomas as one of a pair of comic villains in George Pal's \"Tom Thumb\" (1958), a musical fantasy film, opposite Russ Tamblyn, Jessie Matthews, and Peter Butterworth. Terry-Thomas later said that \"my part was perfect, but Peter's was bloody awful. He wasn't difficult about it, but he knew it\". The performance was a landmark in Sellers's career and became his first contact with the Hollywood film industry.\nSellers released his first studio album in 1958 called \"The Best of Sellers\": a collection of comic songs and sketches, among them Balham - Gateway to the South, where Sellers plays a variety of comic characters. Produced by George Martin and released on Parlophone, the album reached number three in the UK Albums Chart. The same year, Sellers made his first film with John and Roy Boulting in \"Carlton-Browne of the F.O.\", a comedy in which he played a supporting role for the film's lead, Terry-Thomas. Before the release of that film, the Boultings, along with Sellers and Thomas in the cast, started filming \"I'm All Right Jack\", which became the highest-grossing film at the British box office in 1960. In preparation for his role as Fred Kite, Sellers watched footage of union officials. The role earned him a BAFTA, and the critic for \"The Manchester Guardian\" believed it was Sellers's best screen performance to date. In between \"Carlton-Browne of the F.O.\" and \"I'm All Right Jack\", Sellers starred in \"The Mouse That Roared\", a film in which Jean Seberg also appeared and was directed by Jack Arnold. He played three distinct leading roles: the elderly Grand Duchess, the ambitious Prime Minister and the innocent and clumsy farm boy selected to lead an invasion of the United States. The film received high praise from critics.\nAfter completing \"I'm All Right Jack\", Sellers returned to record a new series of \"The Goon Show\". Over the course of two weekends, he took his 16mm cine-camera to Totteridge Lane in London and filmed himself, Spike Milligan, Mario Fabrizi, Leo McKern, and Richard Lester. Originally intended as a private film, the eleven-minute short film \"The Running Jumping &amp; Standing Still Film\" was screened at the 1959 Edinburgh and San Francisco film festivals. It won the award for best fiction short in the latter festival and received an Academy Award nomination for Best Short Subject (Live Action). In 1959, Sellers released his second album, \"Songs for Swingin' Sellers\", which\u2014like his first record\u2014reached number three in the UK Albums Chart. Sellers's last film of the 1950s was \"The Battle of the Sexes\", a comedy directed by Charles Crichton.\n1960\u20131963: \"The Millionairess\", \"Lolita\", \"The Pink Panther\", and divorce.\nIn 1960, Sellers portrayed an Indian doctor, Dr Ahmed el Kabir, in Anthony Asquith's romantic comedy \"The Millionairess\", a film based on a George Bernard Shaw play of the same name. Sellers was not interested in the role until he learned that Sophia Loren would be his co-star. When asked about Loren, he explained to reporters, \"I don't normally act with romantic, glamorous women\u00a0... She's a lot different from Harry Secombe.\" Sellers and Loren developed such a close relationship during filming, he declared his love for her in front of Howe, and woke his son at night to ask if he should divorce from Howe. There is uncertainty whether the relationship was anything more than platonic: a number of people, including Spike Milligan, consider it an affair, while others, including Graham Stark, think it remained only a strong friendship. Sellers's wife at the time, Anne, afterwards commented, \"I don't know to this day whether he had an affair with her. Nobody does.\" \nRoger Lewis observed that Sellers immersed himself completely in the characters he enacted during productions, that \"He'd play a role as an Indian doctor, and for the next six months, he'd be an Indian in his real [daily] life.\" The film inspired the George Martin-produced novelty hit single \"Goodness Gracious Me\", with Sellers and Loren, which reached number four in the UK Singles Chart in November 1960. A follow-up single by the duo, \"Bangers and Mash\", reached number 22 in the UK chart. The songs were included on an album released by the couple, \"Peter &amp; Sophia\", which reached number five in the UK Albums Chart. That year he also appeared in \"Never Let Go\" (1960), playing a straight villain part.\nIn 1961, Sellers made his directorial debut with \"Mr. Topaze\", in which he also starred. The film was based on the Marcel Pagnol play \"Topaze\". Sellers portrayed an ex-schoolmaster in a small French town who turns to a life of crime to obtain wealth. The film and Sellers's directorial abilities received unenthusiastic responses from the public and critics, and Sellers rarely referred to it again. The same year, he starred in the Sidney Gilliat-directed \"Only Two Can Play\", a film based on the novel \"That Uncertain Feeling\" by Kingsley Amis. He was nominated for the Best British Actor award at the 16th British Academy Film Awards for his role as John Lewis, a frustrated Welsh librarian whose affections swing between the glamorous Liz (Mai Zetterling) and his long-suffering wife Jean (Virginia Maskell).\nIn 1962, Sellers played a retired British army general in John Guillermin's \"Waltz of the Toreadors\", based on the play of the same name. The film was widely criticised for its slapstick cinematic adaptation, and director Guillermin himself considered the film \"amateurish\". However, Sellers won the San Sebasti\u00e1n International Film Festival Award for Best Actor and a BAFTA award nomination for his performance, and it was well received by the critics. Stanley Kubrick asked Sellers to play the role of Clare Quilty in the 1962 film \"Lolita\", opposite James Mason and Shelley Winters. Kubrick had seen Sellers in \"The Battle of the Sexes\" and listened to the album \"The Best of Sellers\", and was impressed by the range of characters he could portray. \nSellers was apprehensive about accepting the role, doubting his ability to successfully portray the part of a flamboyant American television playwright who was, according to Sellers, \"a fantastic nightmare, part homosexual, part drug addict, part sadist\". Kubrick encouraged Sellers to improvise and stated that he often reached a \"state of comic ecstasy\". Kubrick had American jazz producer Norman Granz record portions of the script for Sellers to listen to, so he could study the voice and develop confidence, granting Sellers a free artistic licence. Sellers later claimed that his relationship with Kubrick became one of the most rewarding of his career. Writing in \"The Sunday Times\", Dilys Powell commented that Sellers gave \"a firework performance, funny, malicious, only once for a few seconds overreaching itself, and in the murder scene which is both prologue and epilogue achieving the macabre in comedy.\" \nTowards the end of 1962, Sellers appeared in \"The Dock Brief\", a legal satire directed by James Hill and co-starring Richard Attenborough.\nSellers's behaviour towards his family worsened in 1962. On one occasion, he asked his son Michael and his daughter Sarah which parent they loved more; neither mentioned him alone, so they were thrown out and disowned. At the end of the year, his marriage to Anne broke down. In 1963, Sellers starred as gang leader \"Pearly Gates\" in Cliff Owen's \"The Wrong Arm of the Law\", followed by his portrayal of a vicar in \"Heavens Above!\"\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nI'll play Clouseau with great dignity, because he thinks of himself as one of the world's best detectives. Even when he comes a cropper, he must pick himself up with that notion intact. The original script makes him out to be a complete idiot. I think a forgivable vanity would humanize him and make him kind of touching. It's as if filmgoers are kept one fall ahead of him.\n\u2014 Sellers on portraying Clouseau.\nAfter his father's death in October 1962, Sellers decided to leave England and was approached by director Blake Edwards, who offered him the role of Inspector Clouseau in \"The Pink Panther\" after Peter Ustinov had backed out of the film. Edwards later recalled his feelings as \"desperately unhappy and ready to kill, but as fate would have it, I got Mr. Sellers instead of Mr. Ustinov\u2014thank God!\" Sellers accepted a fee of \u00a390,000 (\u00a3 in 2024 pounds) for five weeks' work on location in Rome and Cortina. The film starred David Niven in the principal role, with two other actors\u2014Capucine and Claudia Cardinale\u2014having more prominent roles than Sellers. However, Sellers's performance is regarded as being on par with that of Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton, according to biographer Peter Evans. Although the Clouseau character was in the script, Sellers created the personality, devising the costume, accent, make-up, moustache and trench coat.\n\"The Pink Panther\" was released in the UK in January 1964 and received a mixed reception from the critics, although Penelope Gilliatt, writing in \"The Observer\", remarked that Sellers had a \"flawless sense of mistiming\" in a performance that was \"one of the most delicate studies in accident-proneness since the silents\". Despite the views of the critics, the film was one of the top ten grossing films of the year. The role earned Sellers a nomination for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Motion Picture \u2013 Musical or Comedy at the 22nd Golden Globe Awards and for a Best British Actor award at the 18th British Academy Film Awards.\n1964\u20131969: \"Dr. Strangelove\", health problems, second marriage, and \"Casino Royale\".\nIn 1963, Stanley Kubrick cast Sellers to appear in \"Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb\" alongside George C. Scott, Sterling Hayden, Keenan Wynn and Slim Pickens. Sellers and Kubrick got along famously during the film's production and had the greatest respect for each other, also sharing a love of photography. The director asked Sellers to play four roles: US President Merkin Muffley, Dr. Strangelove, US Air Force Major T. J. \"King\" Kong, and Group Captain Lionel Mandrake of the RAF. Sellers was initially hesitant about taking on these divergent characters, but Kubrick prevailed. According to some accounts, Sellers was also invited to play the part of General Buck Turgidson but turned it down because it was too physically demanding. Kubrick later commented that the idea of having Sellers in so many of the film's key roles was that \"everywhere you turn there is some version of Peter Sellers holding the fate of the world in his hands\". Sellers was especially anxious about believably portraying Kong; he was unsure of his ability to speak in a Texan accent. Kubrick requested screenwriter Terry Southern to record in his natural accent a tape of Kong's lines. After practising with Southern's recording, Sellers got sufficient control of the accent and started shooting the scenes in the aeroplane.\nAfter the first day's shooting, Sellers sprained his ankle while leaving a restaurant and could no longer work in the cramped cockpit set. Kubrick then re-cast Slim Pickens as Kong. The three roles Sellers undertook were distinct, \"variegated, complex and refined\", and critic Alexander Walker considered that these roles \"showed his genius at full stretch\". Sellers played Muffley as a bland, placid intellectual in the mould of Adlai Stevenson; he played Mandrake as an unflappable Englishman; and Dr. Strangelove, a character influenced by pre-war German cinema, as a wheelchair-using fanatic. The critic for \"The Times\" wrote that the film includes \"three remarkable performances from Mr. Peter Sellers, masterly as the President, diverting as a revue-sketch ex-Nazi US Scientist\u00a0... and acceptable as an RAF officer,\" although the critic from \"The Guardian\" thought his portrayal of the RAF officer alone was \"worth the price of an admission ticket\". For his performance in all three roles, Sellers was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor at the 37th Academy Awards and the Best British Actor award at the 18th British Academy Film Awards.\nBetween November 1963 and February 1964, Sellers began filming \"A Shot in the Dark\", an adaptation of a French play, \"L'Idiote\" by Marcel Achard. Sellers found the part and the director, Anatole Litvak, uninspiring; the producers brought in Blake Edwards to replace Litvak. Together with writer William Peter Blatty, they turned the script into a Clouseau comedy, also adding Herbert Lom as Commissioner Dreyfus and Burt Kwouk as Cato. During filming, Sellers's relationship with Edwards became strained; the two would often stop speaking to each other during filming, communicating only by the passing of notes. Sellers's personality was described by others as difficult and demanding, and he often clashed with fellow actors and directors. Upon its release in late June 1964, Bosley Crowther noted the \"joyously free and facile way\" in which Sellers had developed his comedy technique.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nI feel extremely vulnerable, and I need help a lot. A lot. I suppose I feel mainly I need the help of a woman. I'm continually searching for this woman. They mother you, they're great in bed, they're like a sister, they're there when you want to see them, they're not there when you don't. I don't know where they are. Maybe they're around somewhere. I'll find one, one of these days.\n\u2014 Sellers on his need for women.\nTowards the end of filming, in early February 1964, Sellers met Britt Ekland, a Swedish actress who had arrived in London to film \"Guns at Batasi\". On 19 February 1964, just ten days after their first meeting, the couple married. Sellers soon showed signs of insecurity and paranoia; he would become highly anxious and jealous, for example, when Ekland starred opposite attractive men. Shortly after the wedding, Sellers started filming on location in Twentynine Palms, California, for Billy Wilder's \"Kiss Me, Stupid\", opposite Dean Martin and Kim Novak. The relationship between Wilder and Sellers became strained; both had different approaches to work and often clashed as a result. On the night of 5 April 1964, prior to having sex with Ekland, Sellers inhaled amyl nitrite (poppers) as a sexual stimulant in his search for \"the ultimate orgasm\" and suffered a series of eight heart attacks over the course of three hours as a result. His illness forced him to withdraw from the filming of \"Kiss Me, Stupid\" and he was replaced by Ray Walston. Wilder was unsympathetic about the heart attacks, saying that \"you have to have a heart before you can have an attack\".\nAfter some time recovering, Sellers returned to filming in October 1964, playing King of the Individualists alongside Ekland in \"Carol for Another Christmas\", a feature-length special broadcast in the United States on the ABC network on 28 December 1964, designed to promote the United Nations. Sellers had been concerned that his heart attacks might have caused brain damage and that he would be unable to remember his lines, but he was reassured that his memory and abilities were unimpaired after the experience of filming. Sellers followed this with the role of the perverted Austrian psychoanalyst Doctor Fritz Fassbender in Clive Donner's \"What's New Pussycat?\", appearing alongside Peter O'Toole, Romy Schneider, Capucine, Paula Prentiss and Ursula Andress. The film was the first screenwriting and acting credit for Woody Allen and featured Sellers in a love triangle. Because of Sellers's poor health, producer Charles K. Feldman insured him at a cost of $360,000 ($ in 2024 dollars).\nOn 20 January 1965, Sellers and Ekland announced the birth of a daughter, Victoria. They moved to Rome in May to film \"After the Fox\", an Anglo-Italian production in which they were both to appear. The film was directed by Vittorio De Sica, whose English Sellers struggled to understand. Sellers attempted to have De Sica fired, causing tensions on the set. Sellers also became unhappy with his wife's performance, straining their relationship and triggering open arguments, during one of which Sellers threw a chair at Ekland. Despite these conflicts, the script was praised for its wit.\nFollowing the commercial success of \"What's New Pussycat?\", Charles Feldman again brought together Sellers and Woody Allen for his next project, \"Casino Royale\", which also starred Orson Welles; Sellers signed a $1\u00a0million contract for the film ($ in 2024 dollars). Seven screenwriters worked on the project, and filming was chaotic. To make matters worse, according to Ekland, Sellers was \"so insecure, he won't trust anyone\". A poor working relationship quickly developed between Sellers and Welles: Sellers eventually demanded that the two should not share the same set. Sellers left the film before his part was complete. A further agent's part was then written for Terence Cooper, to cover Sellers's departure.\nShortly after leaving \"Casino Royale\", Sellers was appointed a Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (CBE) in honour of his career achievements. The day before the investiture at Buckingham Palace, Sellers and Ekland argued, with Ekland scratching his face in the process; Sellers had a make-up artist cover the marks. During his next film, \"The Bobo\", which again co-starred Ekland, the couple's marital problems worsened. Three weeks into production in Italy, Sellers told director Robert Parrish to fire his wife, saying, \"I'm not coming back after lunch if that bitch is on the set\". Ekland later stated that the marriage was \"an atrocious sham\" at this stage. In the midst of filming \"The Bobo\", Sellers's mother had a heart attack; Parrish asked Sellers if he wanted to visit her in hospital, but Sellers remained on set. She died within days, without Sellers having seen her. He was deeply affected by her death and remorseful at not having returned to London to see her. Ekland served him with divorce papers shortly afterwards. The divorce was finalised on 18 December 1968, and Sellers's friend Spike Milligan sent Ekland a congratulatory telegram. Upon its release in September 1967, \"The Bobo\" was poorly received.\nSellers's first film appearance of 1968 was a reunion with Blake Edwards for the fish-out-of-water comedy \"The Party\", in which he starred alongside Claudine Longet and Denny Miller. He appears as Hrundi V. Bakshi, a bungling Indian actor who accidentally receives an invitation to a lavish Hollywood dinner party. His character, according to Sellers's biographer Peter Evans, was \"clearly an amalgam of Clouseau and the doctor in \"The Millionairess\"\". Roger Lewis notes that, like a number of Sellers's characters, he is played in a sympathetic and dignified manner. He followed it later that year with Hy Averback's \"I Love You, Alice B. Toklas\", playing an attorney who abandons his lifestyle to become a hippie. Roger Ebert of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" gave the film three stars, remarking that Sellers was \"back doing what he does best\", although he also said that in Sellers's previous films he had \"been at his worst recently\".\nIn 1969, Sellers starred opposite Ringo Starr in the Joseph McGrath-directed film \"The Magic Christian\". Sellers portrayed Sir Guy Grand, an eccentric billionaire who plays elaborate practical jokes on people. The critic Irv Slifkin remarked that the film was a reflection of the cynicism of Peter Sellers, describing the film as a \"proto-Pythonesque adaptation of Terry Southern's semi-free-form short novel\" and \"one of the strangest films to be shown at a gala premiere for Britain's royal family\". The film, a satire on human nature, was in general viewed negatively by critics. Roger Greenspun of \"The New York Times\" believed that the film was of variable quality and summarised it as a \"brutal satire\".\n1970\u20131978: \"Period of indifference\": two marriages and three \"Pink Panther\" films.\nAfter a cameo appearance in \"A Day at the Beach\" (1970) (under the pseudonym \"A. Queen\") and a serious role later in 1970 as an ageing businessman who seduces Sin\u00e9ad Cusack in \"Hoffman\", Sellers starred in Roy Boulting's \"There's a Girl in My Soup\" opposite Goldie Hawn. According to \"The Times\", the film was a major commercial success and became the seventh most popular film at the British box office in 1970. Andrew Spicer, writing for the British Film Institute's Screenonline, considers that although Sellers favoured playing romantic roles, he \"was always more successful in parts that sent up his own vanities and pretensions, as with the TV presenter and narcissistic lothario\" he played in \"There's a Girl in My Soup\". The film was seen as a small revival of his career.\nSellers's next films, including Rod Amateau's \"Where Does It Hurt?\" (1972) and Peter Medak's \"Ghost in the Noonday Sun\" (1974), were again poorly received, and his acting was viewed as frenetic rather than funny. Despite these setbacks, Sellers won the Best Actor award at the 1973 Tehran Film Festival for his tragi-comedic role as a street performer in Anthony Simmons's \"The Optimists of Nine Elms\". Fellow comedian and friend Spike Milligan believed that the early 1970s were for Sellers \"a period of indifference, and it would appear at one time that his career might have come to a conclusion\". This was echoed by Sellers's biographer, Peter Evans, who notes that out of nine films in the period, three were never released and five had flopped, while only \"There's a Girl in My Soup\" had been a success. In his private life, he had been seeing the 23-year-old model Miranda Quarry. The couple married on 24 August 1970, despite Sellers's private doubts\u2014expressed to his agent, Dennis Selinger\u2014about his decision to remarry.\nIn April 1972, Sellers reunited with Milligan and Harry Secombe to record \"The Last Goon Show of All\", which was broadcast on 5 October. In May 1973, with his third marriage failing, Sellers went to the theatre to watch Liza Minnelli perform. He became entranced with Minnelli, and the couple became engaged three days later, despite Minnelli's then-current betrothal to Desi Arnaz Jr. and Sellers still being married. Their relationship lasted a month before breaking up. By 1974, Sellers's friends were concerned that he was having a nervous breakdown. Directors John and Roy Boulting considered that Sellers was \"a deeply troubled man, distrustful, self-absorbed, ultimately self-destructive. He was the complete contradiction.\" Sellers was shy and insecure when out of character. When he was invited to appear on Michael Parkinson's eponymous chat show in 1974, he withdrew the day before, explaining to Parkinson that \"I just can't walk on as myself\". When he was told he could come on as someone else, he appeared dressed as a member of the Gestapo. After a few lines in keeping with his assumed character, he stepped out of the role and settled down and, according to Parkinson himself, \"was brilliant, giving the audience an astonishing display of his virtuosity\". In 1974, Sellers again claimed to have communicated with the long-dead music hall comic Dan Leno, who advised him to return to the role of Clouseau.\nIn 1974, Sellers portrayed a \"sexually voracious\" Queen Victoria in Joseph McGrath's comedic biographical film of the Scottish poet William McGonagall, \"The Great McGonagall\", starring opposite Milligan and Julia Foster. However, the film was a critical failure, and Sellers's career and life reached an all-time low. As a result, by 1974 he agreed to accept salaries of \u00a3100,000 and 10 per cent of the gross to appear in TV productions and advertisements, well below the \u00a31 million he had once commanded per film. In 1973, he appeared in a Benson &amp; Hedges cinema commercial; in 1975, he appeared in a series of advertisements for Trans World Airlines, in which he played several eccentric characters, including Thrifty McTravel, Jeremy \"Piggy\" Peak Thyme and an Italian singer, Vito. Biographer Michael Starr asserts that Sellers showed enthusiasm towards these roles, although the airline campaign failed commercially.\nThe turning point in Sellers's flailing career came in 1974, when he re-teamed with Blake Edwards to star in \"The Return of the Pink Panther\", alongside Christopher Plummer, Herbert Lom and Catherine Schell. The film was shot on a budget of $3.7 million and earned $33 million at the box office upon release in May 1975, restoring Sellers's career as an A-list film star along with his millionaire status. The film earned Sellers a nomination for the Best Actor\u00a0\u2013 Musical or Comedy award at the 33rd Golden Globe Awards. In 1976, Sellers and Edwards followed it with \"The Pink Panther Strikes Again\". During filming from February to June 1976, the already fraught relationship between Sellers and Blake Edwards had deteriorated even further. Edwards says of the actor's mental state at the time of \"The Pink Panther Strikes Again\", \"If you went to an asylum and you described the first inmate you saw, that's what Peter had become. He was certifiable.\" With declining physical health, Sellers could at times be unbearable on set. His behaviour was regarded as unprofessional and childish, and he frequently threw tantrums, often threatening to abandon projects. His difficult behaviour during productions was widely reported and made it more difficult for Sellers to get employment in the industry at a time when he most needed the work. Despite Sellers's deep personal problems, \"The Pink Panther Strikes Again\" was well received critically. Vincent Canby of \"The New York Times\" said of Sellers in the film, \"There is, too, something most winningly seedy about Mr. Sellers' Clouseau, a fellow who, when he attempts to tear off his clothes in the heat of passion, gets tangled up in his necktie, and who, when he masquerades\u2014for reasons never gone into\u2014as Quasimodo, overinflates his hump with helium.\" Sellers's performance earned him a further nomination at the 34th Golden Globe Awards.\nIn March 1976, Sellers began dating actress Lynne Frederick, whom he married on 18 February 1977. Biographer Roger Lewis documents that of Sellers's four wives, Frederick was the most poorly treated; Julian Upton likened it to a boxing match between a heavyweight and a featherweight, a relationship that \"oscillated from ardour to hatred, reconciliation and remorse\". On 20 March 1977, Sellers suffered a second major heart attack during a flight from Paris to London; he was subsequently fitted with a pacemaker. Sellers returned from his illness to undertake \"Revenge of the Pink Panther\"; although it was a commercial success, the critics were tiring of Inspector Clouseau. Julian Upton expressed the view that the strain behind the scenes began to manifest itself in the sluggish pace of the film, describing it as a \"laboured, stunt-heavy hotchpotch of half-baked ideas and rehashed gags\". Sellers too had become tired of the role, saying after production, \"I've honestly had enough of Clouseau\u2014I've got nothing more to give\". Steven Bach, the senior vice-president and head of worldwide productions for United Artists, who worked with Sellers on \"Revenge of the Pink Panther\", considered that Sellers was \"deeply unbalanced, if not committable: that was the source of his genius and his truly quite terrifying aspects as manipulator and hysteric.\" He refused to seek professional help for his mental issues. Sellers would claim that he had no personality and was almost unnoticeable, which meant that he \"needed a strongly defined character to play\". He would make similar references throughout his life: when he appeared on \"The Muppet Show\" in 1978, a guest appearance that earned him an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Continuing or Single Performance by a Supporting Actor in Variety or Music, he chose not to appear as himself, instead appearing as a variety of characters in several costumes and speaking in different accents. When Kermit the Frog told Sellers he could relax and just be himself, Sellers replied:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;But that, you see, my dear Kermit, would be altogether impossible. I could never be myself\u00a0... You see, there is no me. I do not exist\u00a0... There used to be a me, but I had it surgically removed.\u2014\u200a\n1979\u20131980: \"Being There\", \"Fu Manchu\", continued domestic problems, and final years.\nIn 1979, Sellers starred alongside Lynne Frederick, Lionel Jeffries and Elke Sommer in Richard Quine's \"The Prisoner of Zenda\". He portrayed three roles, including King Rudolf IV and King Rudolf V\u2014rulers of the fictional small nation of Ruritania\u2014and Syd Frewin, Rudolf V's half-brother. Upon its release in May 1979, the film was well received; Janet Maslin of \"The New York Times\" observed how Sellers divided \"his energies between a serious character and a funny one, but that it was his serious performance which was more impressive\". However, Philip French, for \"The Observer\", was unimpressed by the film, describing it as \"a mess of porridge\" (sic) and stating that \"Sellers reveals that he cannot draw the line between the sincere and the sentimental\".\nLater in 1979, Sellers starred opposite Shirley MacLaine, Melvyn Douglas and Jack Warden in the satirical film \"Being There\" as Chance, a simple-minded, secluded live-in gardener addicted to watching TV who is regarded as a sage by the rich and powerful after being forced into the outside world. In a BBC interview in 1971, Sellers had said that more than anything else, he wanted to play the role and successfully persuaded the author of the book, Jerzy Kosi\u0144ski, to allow him and director Hal Ashby to make the film, provided Kosi\u0144ski could write the script. During filming, to remain in character, Sellers refused most interview requests and kept his distance from the other actors. Sellers considered Chance's walking and voice the character's most important attributes, and in preparing for the role, he worked alone with a tape recorder or with his wife, and then with Ashby, to perfect the clear enunciation and flat delivery needed to reveal \"the childlike mind behind the words\". Sellers described his experience of working on the film as \"so humbling, so powerful\", and co-star Shirley MacLaine found Sellers \"a dream\" to work with. Sellers's performance was universally lauded by critics and is considered by critic Danny Smith to be the \"crowning triumph of Peter Sellers' remarkable career\". Critic Frank Rich wrote that the acting skill required for this sort of role, with a \"schismatic personality which Peter had to convey with strenuous vocal and gestural technique\u00a0... A lesser actor would have made the character's mental dysfunction flamboyant and drastic\u00a0... [His] intelligence was always deeper, his onscreen confidence greater, his technique much more finely honed\": in achieving this, Sellers \"makes the film's fantastic premise credible\". The film earned Sellers a Best Actor award at the 51st National Board of Review Awards; the London Critics Circle Film Awards Special Achievement Award; the Best Actor award at the 45th New York Film Critics Circle Awards; and the Best Actor\u00a0\u2013 Musical or Comedy award at the 37th Golden Globe Awards. Additionally, Sellers was nominated for the Best Actor award at the 52nd Academy Awards and the Best Actor in a Leading Role award at the 34th British Academy Film Awards.\nIn March 1980, Sellers asked his 15-year-old daughter Victoria what she thought about \"Being There\"; she reported later that \"I said yes, I thought it was great. But then I said, 'You looked like a little fat old man'.\u00a0... he went mad. He threw his drink over me and told me to get the next plane home.\" His other daughter Sarah told Sellers her thoughts about the incident, and he sent her a telegram that read, \"After what happened this morning with Victoria, I shall be happy if I never hear from you again. I won't tell you what I think of you. It must be obvious. Goodbye, Your Father.\"\nSellers's last film was \"The Fiendish Plot of Dr. Fu Manchu\", a comedic re-imagining of the eponymous adventure novels by Sax Rohmer; Sellers played both police inspector Nayland Smith and Fu Manchu, alongside Helen Mirren and David Tomlinson. The production of the film was troublesome before filming started, with two directors\u2014Richard Quine and John Avildsen\u2014fired before the script had been completed. Sellers also expressed dissatisfaction with his own portrayal of Manchu, with his ill health often causing delays. Arguments between Sellers and director Piers Haggard led to Haggard's firing at Sellers's instigation, and Sellers took over direction, using his long-time friend David Lodge to direct some sequences. Tom Shales of \"The Washington Post\" described the film as \"an indefensibly inept comedy\", adding that \"it is hard to name another good actor who ever made so many bad movies as Sellers, a comedian of great gifts but ferociously faulty judgment. \"Manchu\" will take its rightful place alongside such colossally ill-advised washouts as \"Tell Me Where It Hurts\", \"The Bobo\" and \"The Prisoner of Zenda\"\".\nSellers's final performances were a series of advertisements for Barclays Bank. Filmed in April 1980 in Ireland, he played Monty Casino, a Jewish con man. Four advertisements were scheduled, but only three were filmed as Sellers collapsed in Dublin, again with heart problems. After two days in care\u2014and against the advice of his doctors\u2014he travelled to the Cannes Film Festival, where \"Being There\" was in competition. Sellers was again ill in Cannes, returning to his residence in Gstaad to work on the script for his next project, \"Romance of the Pink Panther\". At the urging of his friends, he made an appointment to undergo an angiogram at the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles on 30 July 1980 to see if he was able to undergo open-heart surgery. Spike Milligan later considered that Sellers's heart condition had lasted for over 15 years and had \"made life difficult for him and had a debilitating effect on his personality.\" Sellers's fourth marriage to Frederick collapsed soon after. Sellers had recently started to rebuild his relationship with his son Michael after the failure of the latter's marriage. In lighter moments, Sellers had joked that his epitaph should read \"Star of stage, screen and alimony.\"\nDeath and subsequent family issues.\nOn 21 July 1980, Sellers arrived in London from Geneva. He checked into the Dorchester hotel before visiting Golders Green Crematorium for the first time to see the location of his parents' ashes. He had plans to attend a reunion dinner with his \"Goon Show\" partners Milligan and Secombe, scheduled for the evening of 22 July. On the day of the dinner, Sellers took lunch in his hotel suite and shortly afterward collapsed from a heart attack. He was taken to the Middlesex Hospital, London, and died just after midnight on 24 July 1980, aged 54.\nFollowing Sellers's death, fellow actor Richard Attenborough said that Sellers \"had the genius comparable to Chaplin\", while the Boulting brothers considered Sellers as \"a man of enormous gifts; and these gifts he gave to the world. For them, he is assured of a place in the history of art as entertainment.\" Burt Kwouk, who appeared as Cato in the \"Pink Panther\" films, stated that \"Peter was a well-loved actor in Britain\u00a0... the day he died, it seemed that the whole country came to a stop. Everywhere you went, the fact that Peter had died seemed like an umbrella over everything\". Director Blake Edwards thought that \"Peter was brilliant. He had an enormous facility for finding really unusual, unique facets of the character he was playing\". Sellers's friend and \"Goon Show\" colleague Spike Milligan was too upset to speak to the press at the time of Sellers's death, while fellow Goon Harry Secombe said, \"I'm shattered. Peter was such a tremendous artist. He had so much talent, it just oozed out of him\". In dark humour, referring to the missed dinner the Goons had planned, he added, \"Anything to avoid paying for dinner\". Secombe later declared to journalists, \"Bluebottle is deaded now\". Milligan later said that \"it's hard to say this, but he died at the right time.\"\nA private funeral service was held at Golders Green Crematorium on 26 July, conducted by Sellers's old friend, Canon John Hester. Sellers's final joke was the playing of \"In the Mood\" by Glenn Miller, a tune which all the Goons hated; he knew they would have to sit there in silence and listen to it. A memorial service was held at St Martin-in-the-Fields on 8 September 1980\u2014what would have been Sellers's 55th birthday. Close friend Lord Snowdon read the twenty-third Psalm, Harry Secombe sang \"Bread of Heaven\", and the eulogy was read by David Niven.\nAlthough Sellers was reportedly in the process of excluding Frederick from his will a week before he died, she inherited almost his entire estate, worth an estimated \u00a34.5 million (\u00a3 million in 2024 pounds), while his children received \u00a3800 each (\u00a3 in 2023). Spike Milligan appealed to her on behalf of Sellers's three children, but she refused to increase the amount. Sellers's only son, Michael, died of a heart attack at 52 during surgery on 24 July 2006, 26 years to the day after his father's death.\nAfter Peter Sellers's death, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer tried to continue with \"Romance of the Pink Panther\" and offered the role of Clouseau to Dudley Moore, who turned it down. The studio subsequently returned to Blake Edwards, who was adamant not to recast the character, feeling certain that no one could adequately replace Sellers. In 1982, Edwards released \"Trail of the Pink Panther\", which was composed entirely of deleted scenes from his past three \"Panther\" films. Frederick sued, claiming the use of the clips was a breach of contract; the court awarded her $1million ($ million in 2024), plus 3.15 per cent of the film's profits and 1.36 per cent of its gross revenue.\nTechnique.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nI start with the voice. I find out how the character \"sounds\". It's through the way he speaks that I find out the rest about him.\u00a0... After the voice comes the looks of the man. I do a lot of drawings of the character I play. Then I get together with the makeup man and we sort of transfer my drawings onto my face. An involved process. After that I establish how the character walks. Very important, the walk. And then, suddenly, something strange happens. \"The person takes over\". The man you play begins to exist.\n\u2014 Sellers describing how he prepared for his wide range of roles in an October 1962 interview for \"Playboy\". \nVincent Canby of \"The New York Times\" said of the Pink Panther films, \"I'm not sure why Mr. Sellers and Mr. Lom are such a hilarious team, though it may be because each is a fine comic actor with a special talent for portraying the sort of all-consuming, epic self-absorption that makes slapstick farce initially acceptable\u2014instead of alarming\u2014and finally so funny.\" The film critic Elvis Mitchell said that Sellers was one of the few comic geniuses who was able to truly hide behind his characters, giving the audience no sense of what he was really like in real life. A feature of the characterisations undertaken by Sellers is that, regardless of how clumsy or idiotic they are, he ensured that they always retained their dignity. On his playing of Clouseau, Sellers said, \"I set out to play Clouseau with great dignity because I feel that he thinks he is probably one of the greatest detectives in the world. The original script makes him out to be a complete idiot. I thought a forgivable vanity would humanise him and make him kind of touching.\"\nSellers's biographer, Ed Sikov, notes that because of this retained dignity, Sellers is \"the master of playing men who have no idea how ridiculous they are.\" Social historian Sam Wasson notes the complexity in Sellers's performances in the \"Pink Panther\" films, which has the effect of alienating Clouseau from his environment. Wesson considers that \"As 'low' and 'high' comedy rolled into one, it's the performative counterpoint to Edwardian sophisticated naturalism\". This combination of \"high\" and \"low\", exemplified by Clouseau's attempting to retain dignity after a fall, means that within the film Clouseau was \"the sole representative of humanity\". Film critic Dilys Powell also saw the inherent dignity in the parts and wrote that Sellers had a \"balance between character and absurdity\". Richard Attenborough also thought that because of his sympathy, Sellers could \"inject into his characterisations the frailty and substance of a human being\".\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nPeter was a marvelous improvisational actor, brilliant if you got him on the first take. The second take would be good, but after the third take he could be really awful. If he had to repeat the same words too many times they became meaningless. But it was such a joy to work with Peter because he was such an inspired actor. Sometimes he would literally knock me off my feet. I'd fall down convulsed with laughter.\n \u2014 Filmmaker Jack Arnold, on directing Sellers in \"The Mouse That Roared\".\nAuthor Aaron Sultanik observed that in Sellers's early films, such as \"I'm All Right Jack\", he displays \"deft, technical interpretations [that] pinpoint the mechanical nature of his comic characterization\", which \"reduces each of his characters to a series of gross, awkward tics\". Academic Cynthia Baron observed that Sellers's external characterisations led to doubt with reviewers as to whether Sellers's work was \"true\" acting. Critic Tom Milne saw a change over Sellers's career and thought that his \"comic genius as a character actor was\u00a0... stifled by his elevation to leading man\" and his later films suffered as a result. Sultanik agreed, commenting that Sellers's \"exceptional vocal and physical technique\" was underused during his career in the US.\nAcademics Maria Pramaggiore and Tom Wallis remarked that Sellers fits the mould of a technical actor because he displays a mastery of physical characterisation, such as accent or physical trait. Writer and playwright John Mortimer saw the process for himself when Sellers was about to undertake filming on Mortimer's \"The Dock Brief\" and could not decide how to play the character of the barrister. By chance, he ordered cockles for lunch, and the smell brought back a memory of the seaside town of Morecambe; this gave him \"the idea of a faded North Country accent and the suggestion of a scrappy moustache\". So important was the voice as the starting point for character development that Sellers would walk around London with a reel-to-reel tape recorder, recording voices to study at home.\nLegacy.\n\"New York\" magazine stated that all of the films starring Sellers as Clouseau showcased his \"comedic brilliance\". Sellers's friend and \"Goon Show\" colleague Spike Milligan said that Sellers \"had one of the most glittering comic talents of his age\", while English filmmakers John and Roy Boulting stated that he was \"the greatest comic genius this country has produced since Charles Chaplin\". Irv Slifkin said that the most prominent, albeit ever-changing, face in comedies of the 1960s was Sellers, who \"changed like a chameleon throughout the era, dazzling audiences\". In a 2005 poll to find \"The Comedian's Comedian\", Sellers was voted 14th in the list of the top 20 greatest comedians by fellow comics and comedy insiders.\nSellers and \"The Goon Show\" were a strong influence on the Monty Python performers, with John Cleese calling him \"the greatest voice man of all time\", adding, \"If he could listen to you for five minutes, he could do a perfect impersonation of you.\" The Goons were imported to the United States by the NBC program \"Monitor\", which played recorded Goon show episodes starting in 1955. The American comedy troupe the Firesign Theatre also cited the Goons as a big influence on their radio comedy style.\nSellers and the Goons were also an influence on Peter Cook, who described Sellers as \"the best comic actor in the world\". British actor Stephen Mangan stated that Sellers was a large influence, as did the comedians Mike Myers, Alan Carr and Rob Brydon. Sellers's characters Hrundi Bakshi (\"The Party\") and Inspector Clouseau (\"The Pink Panther\") later influenced comedian Rowan Atkinson's characters Mr. Bean and Johnny English. The comic performer Sacha Baron Cohen referred to Sellers as \"the most seminal force in shaping [his] early ideas on comedy\". Cohen was considered for the role of Sellers in the biographical film \"The Life and Death of Peter Sellers\". Will Ferrell considers Sellers to be an important influence on him, citing his \"unique combination of being extremely subtle and over-the-top all at the same time.\" The three members of Spinal Tap\u2014Michael McKean, Christopher Guest and Harry Shearer\u2014have also cited Sellers as being an influence on them, as has the US talk-show host Conan O'Brien. David Schwimmer is another whose approach was influenced by Sellers: \"he could do anything, from Dr Strangelove to Inspector Clouseau. He was just amazing.\"\nAs a child, Eddie Murphy developed his skills in playing multiple characters in imitation of Sellers, whom he called his acting hero, with Chris Rock hailing Murphy's performances (such as the multiple roles in \"The Nutty Professor\") as \"Peter Sellers\u2013esque\". During an interview in 2002, Robin Williams told Michael Parkinson that Sellers was an important influence, especially his multi-character roles in \"Dr. Strangelove\", stating, \"It doesn't get better than that.\" Williams was considered to play Sellers in the HBO biopic but turned it down over scheduling conflicts, though Williams considered it an honour to be able to portray him. Eddie Izzard notes that the Goons \"influenced a new generation of comedians who came to be known as 'alternative'\"\u2014including herself, while the media historian Graham McCann states \"the anarchic spirit of the Goon Show\u00a0... would inspire, directly or indirectly and to varying extents,\u00a0... \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\", \"The Young Ones\", \"Vic Reeves Big Night Out\", \"The League of Gentlemen\" [and] \"Brass Eye\".\"\nThe stage play \"Being Sellers\" premiered in Australia in 1998, three years after the release of the biography by Roger Lewis, \"The Life and Death of Peter Sellers\". In 2004, the book was turned into an HBO film with the same title, starring Geoffrey Rush. The play later transferred to New York in December 2010. \"The Belfast Telegraph\" notes how the film captured Sellers's \"life of drugs, drink, fast cars and lots and lots of beautiful women\".\nFilmography and other works.\nSelected works, based on award nominations\nNotes and references.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The \"Projekt Runeberg\" was founded by Swedish students of Link\u00f6ping University, which began digitizing Nordic-language literature as early as 1991 \u2013 The project takes its name from the Finnish national poet Johan Ludvig Runeberg and is a word-play of similar-natured Project Gutenberg.\nNature.\n\"Projekt Runeberg\" is a digital cultural archive initiative that publishes free electronic versions of books and to digitize and archive written cultural works of literature, with a focus of Scandinavian and comparable Nordic origin with given cultural significance or historical importance.\nIt is patterned after the similar-named English-language cultural initiative Project Gutenberg and its similar effort, whereas the project's name is a word-play of the fact that old Nordic literature are often being written in Nordic Runes, and PG's ties to the name of German inventor Johannes Gutenberg \u2013 Inventor of the printing-press, which works eventually helped to quickly accelerate the spread of the Bible.\nThe initiative seeks to publishes free electronic versions of formerly digitized books and writings as Ebooks in various formats such as EPub or PDF.\nHistory.\nThe Runeberg-project itself was initiated by Swedish students around Lars Aronsson and other colleagues of the Lysator Academic Computer Club at the Link\u00f6ping University, Sweden, which began systematically digitizing and archiving Nordic-language literature around June 1992, while efforts started as early as July 1991, when student Linus Tolke announced on the computer-club's conference-system \"LysKOM\", to have started digitizing the \"Gospel of John\" of the Swedish Bible of 1917 (\"1917 \u00e5rs Bibel\u00f6vers\u00e4ttning\").\nThe Project began archiving its first Nordic-language literature pieces (parts of the \"F\u00e4nrik St\u00e5ls S\u00e4gner\", of Nordic dictionaries and of a Bible from 1917) in December 1992.\nAs of 2015 it had accomplished digitization to provide graphical facsimiles of old works such as the \"Nordisk familjebok\", and had accomplished, in whole or in part, the text extractions and copy-editing of these as well as esteemed Latin works and English translations from Nordic authors, sheet music and other texts of cultural interest. The project provides an extensive project-timeline with given milestones, beginning in 1991 being maintained since.\nTechnology.\nBy 2001, technology \u2013 image scanning and optical character recognition techniques \u2013 had improved enough to allow full digitization and text extraction of important target texts, e.g., of both print editions of the \"Nordisk familjebok\" (45,000 pages). Project Runeberg is hosted by an academic computer group, Lysator, at Link\u00f6ping University, in Link\u00f6ping in southern Sweden.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "24522", "revid": "48736052", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24522", "title": "Power law", "text": "Functional relationship between two quantities\nIn statistics, a power law is a functional relationship between two quantities, where a relative change in one quantity results in a relative change in the other quantity proportional to the change raised to a constant exponent: one quantity varies as a power of another. The change is independent of the initial size of those quantities.\nFor instance, the area of a square has a power law relationship with the length of its side, since if the length is doubled, the area is multiplied by 22, while if the length is tripled, the area is multiplied by 32, and so on.\nEmpirical examples.\nThe distributions of a wide variety of physical, biological, and human-made phenomena approximately follow a power law over a wide range of magnitudes: these include the sizes of craters on the moon and of solar flares, cloud sizes, the foraging pattern of various species, the sizes of activity patterns of neuronal populations, the frequencies of words in most languages, frequencies of family names, the species richness in clades of organisms, the sizes of power outages, volcanic eruptions, human judgments of stimulus intensity and many other quantities. Empirical distributions can only fit a power law for a limited range of values, because a pure power law would allow for arbitrarily large or small values.\nAcoustic attenuation follows frequency power-laws within wide frequency bands for many complex media. Allometric scaling laws for relationships between biological variables are among the best known power-law functions in nature.\nProperties.\nStatistical incompleteness.\nThe power-law model does not obey the treasured paradigm of statistical completeness. Especially probability bounds, the suspected cause of typical bending and/or flattening phenomena in the high- and low-frequency graphical segments, are parametrically absent in the standard model.\nScale invariance.\nOne attribute of power laws is their scale invariance. Given a relation formula_1, scaling the argument formula_2 by a constant factor formula_3 causes only a proportionate scaling of the function itself. That is,\nformula_4\nwhere formula_5 denotes direct proportionality. That is, scaling by a constant formula_3 simply multiplies the original power-law relation by the constant formula_7. Thus, it follows that all power laws with a particular scaling exponent are equivalent up to constant factors, since each is simply a scaled version of the others. This behavior is what produces the linear relationship when logarithms are taken of both formula_8 and formula_2, and the straight-line on the log\u2013log plot is often called the \"signature\" of a power law. With real data, such straightness is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for the data following a power-law relation. In fact, there are many ways to generate finite amounts of data that mimic this signature behavior, but, in their asymptotic limit, are not true power laws. Thus, accurately fitting and validating power-law models is an active area of research in statistics; see below.\nLack of well-defined average value.\nA power-law formula_10 has a well-defined mean over formula_11 only if formula_12, and it has a finite variance only if formula_13; most identified power laws in nature have exponents such that the mean is well-defined but the variance is not, implying they are capable of black swan behavior. This can be seen in the following thought experiment: imagine a room with your friends and estimate the average monthly income in the room. Now imagine the world's richest person entering the room, with a monthly income of about 1 billion US$. What happens to the average income in the room? Income is distributed according to a power-law known as the Pareto distribution (for example, the net worth of Americans is distributed according to a power law with an exponent of 2).\nOn the one hand, this makes it incorrect to apply traditional statistics that are based on variance and standard deviation (such as regression analysis). On the other hand, this also allows for cost-efficient interventions. For example, given that car exhaust is distributed according to a power-law among cars (very few cars contribute to most contamination) it would be sufficient to eliminate those very few cars from the road to reduce total exhaust substantially.\nThe median does exist, however: for a power law \"x\" \u2013\"k\", with exponent &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, it takes the value 21/(\"k\" \u2013 1)\"x\"min, where \"x\"min is the minimum value for which the power law holds.\nUniversality.\nThe equivalence of power laws with a particular scaling exponent can have a deeper origin in the dynamical processes that generate the power-law relation. In physics, for example, phase transitions in thermodynamic systems are associated with the emergence of power-law distributions of certain quantities, whose exponents are referred to as the critical exponents of the system. Diverse systems with the same critical exponents\u2014that is, which display identical scaling behaviour as they approach criticality\u2014can be shown, via renormalization group theory, to share the same fundamental dynamics. For instance, the behavior of water and CO2 at their boiling points fall in the same universality class because they have identical critical exponents. In fact, almost all material phase transitions are described by a small set of universality classes. Similar observations have been made, though not as comprehensively, for various self-organized critical systems, where the critical point of the system is an attractor. Formally, this sharing of dynamics is referred to as universality, and systems with precisely the same critical exponents are said to belong to the same universality class.\nPower-law functions.\nScientific interest in power-law relations stems partly from the ease with which certain general classes of mechanisms generate them. The demonstration of a power-law relation in some data can point to specific kinds of mechanisms that might underlie the natural phenomenon in question, and can indicate a deep connection with other, seemingly unrelated systems; see also universality above. The ubiquity of power-law relations in physics is partly due to dimensional constraints, while in complex systems, power laws are often thought to be signatures of hierarchy or of specific stochastic processes. A few notable examples of power laws are Pareto's law of income distribution, structural self-similarity of fractals, scaling laws in biological systems, and scaling laws in cities. Research on the origins of power-law relations, and efforts to observe and validate them in the real world, is an active topic of research in many fields of science, including physics, computer science, linguistics, geophysics, neuroscience, systematics, sociology, economics and more.\nHowever, much of the recent interest in power laws comes from the study of probability distributions: The distributions of a wide variety of quantities seem to follow the power-law form, at least in their upper tail (large events). The behavior of these large events connects these quantities to the study of theory of large deviations (also called extreme value theory), which considers the frequency of extremely rare events like stock market crashes and large natural disasters. It is primarily in the study of statistical distributions that the name \"power law\" is used.\nIn empirical contexts, an approximation to a power-law formula_14 often includes a deviation term formula_15, which can represent uncertainty in the observed values (perhaps measurement or sampling errors) or provide a simple way for observations to deviate from the power-law function (perhaps for stochastic reasons):\nformula_16\nMathematically, a strict power law cannot be a probability distribution, but a distribution that is a truncated power function is possible: formula_17 for formula_18 where the exponent formula_19 (Greek letter alpha, not to be confused with scaling factor formula_20 used above) is greater than 1 (otherwise the tail has infinite area), the minimum value formula_21 is needed otherwise the distribution has infinite area as \"x\" approaches 0, and the constant \"C\" is a scaling factor to ensure that the total area is 1, as required by a probability distribution. More often one uses an asymptotic power law \u2013 one that is only true in the limit; see power-law probability distributions below for details. Typically the exponent falls in the range formula_22, though not always.\nExamples.\nMore than a hundred power-law distributions have been identified in physics (e.g. sandpile avalanches), biology (e.g. species extinction and body mass), and the social sciences (e.g. city sizes and income). Among them are:\nVariants.\nBroken power law.\nA broken power law is a piecewise function, consisting of two or more power laws, combined with a threshold. For example, with two power laws:\nformula_23 for formula_24,\nformula_25\nSmoothly broken power law.\nThe pieces of a broken power law can be smoothly spliced together to construct a smoothly broken power law. \nThere are different possible ways to splice together power laws. One example is the following:formula_26where formula_27.\nWhen the function is plotted as a log-log plot with horizontal axis being formula_28 and vertical axis being formula_29, the plot is composed of formula_30 linear segments with slopes formula_31, separated at formula_32, smoothly spliced together. The size of formula_33 determines the sharpness of splicing between segments formula_34.\nPower law with exponential cutoff.\nA power law with an exponential cutoff is simply a power law multiplied by an exponential function:\nformula_35\nCurved power law.\nformula_36\nPower-law probability distributions.\nIn a looser sense, a power-law probability distribution is a distribution whose density function (or mass function in the discrete case) has the form, for large values of formula_2,\nformula_38\nwhere formula_39, and formula_40 is a slowly varying function, which is any function that satisfies formula_41 for any positive factor formula_42. This property of formula_40 follows directly from the requirement that formula_44 be asymptotically scale invariant; thus, the form of formula_40 only controls the shape and finite extent of the lower tail. For instance, if formula_40 is the constant function, then we have a power law that holds for all values of formula_2. In many cases, it is convenient to assume a lower bound formula_48 from which the law holds. Combining these two cases, and where formula_2 is a continuous variable, the power law has the form of the Pareto distribution\nformula_50\nwhere the pre-factor to formula_51 is the normalizing constant. We can now consider several properties of this distribution. For instance, its moments are given by\nformula_52\nwhich is only well defined for formula_53. That is, all moments formula_54 diverge: when formula_55, the average and all higher-order moments are infinite; when formula_56, the mean exists, but the variance and higher-order moments are infinite, etc. For finite-size samples drawn from such distribution, this behavior implies that the central moment estimators (like the mean and the variance) for diverging moments will never converge \u2013 as more data is accumulated, they continue to grow. These power-law probability distributions are also called Pareto-type distributions, distributions with Pareto tails, or distributions with regularly varying tails.\nA modification, which does not satisfy the general form above, with an exponential cutoff, is\nformula_57\nIn this distribution, the exponential decay term formula_58 eventually overwhelms the power-law behavior at very large values of formula_2. This distribution does not scale and is thus not asymptotically as a power law; however, it does approximately scale over a finite region before the cutoff. The pure form above is a subset of this family, with formula_60. This distribution is a common alternative to the asymptotic power-law distribution because it naturally captures finite-size effects.\nThe Tweedie distributions are a family of statistical models characterized by closure under additive and reproductive convolution as well as under scale transformation. Consequently, these models all express a power-law relationship between the variance and the mean. These models have a fundamental role as foci of mathematical convergence similar to the role that the normal distribution has as a focus in the central limit theorem. This convergence effect explains why the variance-to-mean power law manifests so widely in natural processes, as with Taylor's law in ecology and with fluctuation scaling in physics. It can also be shown that this variance-to-mean power law, when demonstrated by the method of expanding bins, implies the presence of 1/\"f\" noise and that 1/\"f\" noise can arise as a consequence of this Tweedie convergence effect.\nGraphical methods for identification.\nAlthough more sophisticated and robust methods have been proposed, the most frequently used graphical methods of identifying power-law probability distributions using random samples are Pareto quantile-quantile plots (or Pareto Q\u2013Q plots), mean residual life plots and log\u2013log plots. Another, more robust graphical method uses bundles of residual quantile functions. (Please keep in mind that power-law distributions are also called Pareto-type distributions.) It is assumed here that a random sample is obtained from a probability distribution, and that we want to know if the tail of the distribution follows a power law (in other words, we want to know if the distribution has a \"Pareto tail\"). Here, the random sample is called \"the data\".\nPareto Q\u2013Q plots.\nPareto Q\u2013Q plots compare the quantiles of the log-transformed data to the corresponding quantiles of an exponential distribution with mean 1 (or to the quantiles of a standard Pareto distribution) by plotting the former versus the latter. If the resultant scatterplot suggests that the plotted points \"asymptotically converge\" to a straight line, then a power-law distribution should be suspected. A limitation of Pareto Q\u2013Q plots is that they behave poorly when the tail index formula_19 (also called Pareto index) is close to 0, because Pareto Q\u2013Q plots are not designed to identify distributions with slowly varying tails.\nMean residual life plots.\nOn the other hand, in its version for identifying power-law probability distributions, the mean residual life plot consists of first log-transforming the data, and then plotting the average of those log-transformed data that are higher than the \"i\"-th order statistic versus the \"i\"-th order statistic, for \"i\"\u00a0=\u00a01,\u00a0...,\u00a0\"n\", where n is the size of the random sample. If the resultant scatterplot suggests that the plotted points tend to stabilize about a horizontal straight line, then a power-law distribution should be suspected. Since the mean residual life plot is very sensitive to outliers (it is not robust), it usually produces plots that are difficult to interpret; for this reason, such plots are usually called Hill horror plots.\nLog-log plots.\nLog\u2013log plots are an alternative way of graphically examining the tail of a distribution using a random sample. Taking the logarithm of a power law of the form formula_62 results in:\nformula_63\nwhich forms a straight line with slope formula_64 on a log-log scale. Caution has to be exercised however as a log\u2013log plot is necessary but insufficient evidence for a power law relationship, as many non power-law distributions will appear as straight lines on a log\u2013log plot. This method consists of plotting the logarithm of an estimator of the probability that a particular number of the distribution occurs versus the logarithm of that particular number. Usually, this estimator is the proportion of times that the number occurs in the data set. If the points in the plot tend to converge to a straight line for large numbers in the x axis, then the researcher concludes that the distribution has a power-law tail. Examples of the application of these types of plot have been published. A disadvantage of these plots is that, in order for them to provide reliable results, they require huge amounts of data. In addition, they are appropriate only for discrete (or grouped) data.\nBundle plots.\nAnother graphical method for the identification of power-law probability distributions using random samples has been proposed. This methodology consists of plotting a \"bundle for the log-transformed sample\". Originally proposed as a tool to explore the existence of moments and the moment generation function using random samples, the bundle methodology is based on residual quantile functions (RQFs), also called residual percentile functions, which provide a full characterization of the tail behavior of many well-known probability distributions, including power-law distributions, distributions with other types of heavy tails, and even non-heavy-tailed distributions. Bundle plots do not have the disadvantages of Pareto Q\u2013Q plots, mean residual life plots and log\u2013log plots mentioned above (they are robust to outliers, allow visually identifying power laws with small values of formula_19, and do not demand the collection of much data). In addition, other types of tail behavior can be identified using bundle plots.\nPlotting power-law distributions.\nIn general, power-law distributions are plotted on doubly logarithmic axes, which emphasizes the upper tail region. The most convenient way to do this is via the (complementary) cumulative distribution (ccdf) that is, the survival function, formula_66,\nformula_67\nThe cdf is also a power-law function, but with a smaller scaling exponent. For data, an equivalent form of the cdf is the rank-frequency approach, in which we first sort the formula_68 observed values in ascending order, and plot them against the vector formula_69.\nAlthough it can be convenient to log-bin the data, or otherwise smooth the probability density (mass) function directly, these methods introduce an implicit bias in the representation of the data, and thus should be avoided. The survival function, on the other hand, is more robust to (but not without) such biases in the data and preserves the linear signature on doubly logarithmic axes. Though a survival function representation is favored over that of the pdf while fitting a power law to the data with the linear least square method, it is not devoid of mathematical inaccuracy. Thus, while estimating exponents of a power law distribution, maximum likelihood estimator is recommended.\nEstimating the exponent from empirical data.\nThere are many ways of estimating the value of the scaling exponent for a power-law tail, however not all of them yield unbiased and consistent answers. Some of the most reliable techniques are often based on the method of maximum likelihood. Alternative methods are often based on making a linear regression on either the log\u2013log probability, the log\u2013log cumulative distribution function, or on log-binned data, but these approaches should be avoided as they can all lead to highly biased estimates of the scaling exponent.\nMaximum likelihood.\nFor real-valued, independent and identically distributed data, we fit a power-law distribution of the form\nformula_70\nto the data formula_71, where the coefficient formula_51 is included to ensure that the distribution is normalized. Given a choice for formula_73, the log likelihood function becomes:\nformula_74 \nThe maximum of this likelihood is found by differentiating with respect to parameter formula_19, setting the result equal to zero. Upon rearrangement, this yields the estimator equation:\nformula_76\nwhere formula_77 are the formula_68 data points formula_79. This estimator exhibits a small finite sample-size bias of order formula_80, which is small when \"n\"\u00a0&gt;\u00a0100. Further, the standard error of the estimate is formula_81. This estimator is equivalent to the popular Hill estimator from quantitative finance and extreme value theory.\nFor a set of \"n\" integer-valued data points formula_77, again where each formula_83, the maximum likelihood exponent is the solution to the transcendental equation\nformula_84\nwhere formula_85 is the incomplete zeta function. The uncertainty in this estimate follows the same formula as for the continuous equation. However, the two equations for formula_86 are not equivalent, and the continuous version should not be applied to discrete data, nor vice versa.\nFurther, both of these estimators require the choice of formula_73. For functions with a non-trivial formula_40 function, choosing formula_73 too small produces a significant bias in formula_90, while choosing it too large increases the uncertainty in formula_86, and reduces the statistical power of our model. In general, the best choice of formula_73 depends strongly on the particular form of the lower tail, represented by formula_40 above.\nMore about these methods, and the conditions under which they can be used, can be found in . Further, this comprehensive review article provides http:// (Matlab, Python, R and C++) for estimation and testing routines for power-law distributions.\nKolmogorov\u2013Smirnov estimation.\nAnother method for the estimation of the power-law exponent, which does not assume independent and identically distributed (iid) data, uses the minimization of the Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov statistic, formula_94, between the cumulative distribution functions of the data and the power law:\nformula_95\nwith\nformula_96\nwhere formula_97 and formula_98 denote the cdfs of the data and the power law with exponent formula_19, respectively. As this method does not assume iid data, it provides an alternative way to determine the power-law exponent for data sets in which the temporal correlation can not be ignored.\nValidating power laws.\nAlthough power-law relations are attractive for many theoretical reasons, demonstrating that data does indeed follow a power-law relation requires more than simply fitting a particular model to the data. This is important for understanding the mechanism that gives rise to the distribution: superficially similar distributions may arise for significantly different reasons, and different models yield different predictions, such as extrapolation.\nFor example, log-normal distributions are often mistaken for power-law distributions:. When you take the log of its probability density function, the log-normal distribution has terms that are constant, log, and log-squared. When the mean is small and variance is large, the constant in front of the log-squared term is very small. In that case, for most of the distribution, it will be linear on a log-log plot. It is only for extreme values that the log-squared term asserts itself and shows that it is not a power-law. \nFor example, Gibrat's law about proportional growth processes produce distributions that are lognormal, although their log\u2013log plots look linear over a limited range. An explanation of this is that although the logarithm of the lognormal density function is quadratic in log(x), yielding a \"bowed\" shape in a log\u2013log plot, if the quadratic term is small relative to the linear term then the result can appear almost linear, and the lognormal behavior is only visible when the quadratic term dominates, which may require significantly more data. Therefore, a log\u2013log plot that is slightly \"bowed\" downwards can reflect a log-normal distribution \u2013 not a power law.\nIn general, many alternative functional forms can appear to follow a power-law form for some extent. proposed plotting the empirical cumulative distribution function in the log-log domain and claimed that a candidate power-law should cover at least two orders of magnitude. Also, researchers usually have to face the problem of deciding whether or not a real-world probability distribution follows a power law. As a solution to this problem, Diaz proposed a graphical methodology based on random samples that allow visually discerning between different types of tail behavior. This methodology uses bundles of residual quantile functions, also called percentile residual life functions, which characterize many different types of distribution tails, including both heavy and non-heavy tails. However, claimed the need for both a statistical and a theoretical background in order to support a power-law in the underlying mechanism driving the data generating process.\nOne method to validate a power-law relation tests many orthogonal predictions of a particular generative mechanism against data. Simply fitting a power-law relation to a particular kind of data is not considered a rational approach. As such, the validation of power-law claims remains a very active field of research in many areas of modern science.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\nNotes\nBibliography"}

{"id": "24530", "revid": "514304", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24530", "title": "PH", "text": "Measure of the level of acidity or basicity of an aqueous solution\nIn chemistry, pH ( or ; or ) is a logarithmic scale used to specify the acidity or basicity of aqueous solutions. Acidic solutions (solutions with higher concentrations of hydrogen () cations) are measured to have lower pH values than basic or alkaline solutions. While the origin of the symbol 'pH' can be traced back to its original inventor, and the 'H' refers clearly to hydrogen, the exact original meaning of the letter 'p' in pH is still disputed; it has since acquired a more general technical meaning that is used in numerous other contexts.\nThe pH scale is logarithmic and inversely indicates the activity of hydrogen cations in the solution\n formula_1\nwhere [H+] is the equilibrium molar concentration of H+ (in M = mol/L) in the solution. At 25\u00a0\u00b0C (77\u00a0\u00b0F), solutions of which the pH is less than 7 are acidic, and solutions of which the pH is greater than 7 are basic. Solutions with a pH of 7 at 25\u00a0\u00b0C are neutral (i.e. have the same concentration of H+ ions as OH\u2212 ions, i.e. the same as pure water). The neutral value of the pH depends on the temperature and is lower than 7 if the temperature increases above 25\u00a0\u00b0C. The pH range is commonly given as zero to 14, but a pH value can be less than 0 for very concentrated strong acids or greater than 14 for very concentrated strong bases.\nThe pH scale is traceable to a set of standard solutions whose pH is established by international agreement. Primary pH standard values are determined using a concentration cell with transference by measuring the potential difference between a hydrogen electrode and a standard electrode such as the silver chloride electrode. The pH of aqueous solutions can be measured with a glass electrode and a pH meter or a color-changing indicator. Measurements of pH are important in chemistry, agronomy, medicine, water treatment, and many other applications.\nHistory.\nIn 1909, the Danish chemist S\u00f8ren Peter Lauritz S\u00f8rensen introduced the concept of pH at the Carlsberg Laboratory, originally using the notation \"pH\u2022\", with H\u2022 as a subscript to the lowercase p. The concept was later revised in 1924 to the modern pH to accommodate definitions and measurements in terms of electrochemical cells.For the number \"p\", I propose the name 'hydrogen ion exponent' and the symbol \"p\"H\u2022. Then, for the hydrogen ion exponent (\"p\"H\u2022) of a solution, the negative value of the Briggsian logarithm of the related hydrogen ion normality factor is to be understood.S\u00f8rensen did not explain why he used the letter p, and the exact meaning of the letter is still disputed. S\u00f8rensen described a way of measuring pH using \"potential\" differences, and it represents the negative \"power\" of 10 in the concentration of hydrogen ions. The letter \"p\" could stand for the French \"puissance,\" German \"Potenz,\" or Danish \"potens\", all meaning \"power\", or it could mean \"potential\". All of these words start with the letter \"p\" in French, German, and Danish, which were the languages in which S\u00f8rensen published: Carlsberg Laboratory was French-speaking; German was the dominant language of scientific publishing; S\u00f8rensen was Danish. He also used the letter \"q\" in much the same way elsewhere in the paper, and he might have arbitrarily labelled the test solution \"p\" and the reference solution \"q\"; these letters are often paired with e4 then e5. Some literature sources suggest that \"pH\" stands for the Latin term \"pondus hydrogenii\" (quantity of hydrogen) or \"potentia hydrogenii\" (power of hydrogen), although this is not supported by S\u00f8rensen's writings.\nIn modern chemistry, the p stands for \"the negative decimal logarithm of\", and is used in the term p\"K\"a for acid dissociation constants, so pH is \"the negative decimal logarithm of H+ ion concentration\", while pOH is \"the negative decimal logarithm of OH\u2212 ion concentration\". \nAmerican bacteriologist Alice Catherine Evans, who influenced dairying and food safety, credited William Mansfield Clark and colleagues, including herself, with developing pH measuring methods in the 1910s, which had a wide influence on laboratory and industrial use thereafter. In her memoir, she does not mention how much, or how little, Clark and colleagues knew about S\u00f8rensen's work a few years prior. She said:In these studies [of bacterial metabolism] Dr. Clark's attention was directed to the effect of acid on the growth of bacteria. He found that it is the intensity of the acid in terms of hydrogen-ion concentration that affects their growth. But existing methods of measuring acidity determined the quantity, not the intensity, of the acid. Next, with his collaborators, Dr. Clark developed accurate methods for measuring hydrogen-ion concentration. These methods replaced the inaccurate titration method of determining the acid content in use in biologic laboratories throughout the world. Also they were found to be applicable in many industrial and other processes in which they came into wide usage.The first electronic method for measuring pH was invented by Arnold Orville Beckman, a professor at the California Institute of Technology in 1934. It was in response to a request from the local citrus grower Sunkist, which wanted a better method for quickly testing the pH of lemons they were picking from their nearby orchards.\nDefinition.\npH.\nThe pH of a solution is defined as the decimal logarithm of the reciprocal of the hydrogen ion activity, \"a\"H+. Mathematically, pH is expressed as:\n formula_2\nFor example, for a solution with a hydrogen ion activity of (i.e., the concentration of hydrogen cations), the pH of the solution can be calculated as follows:\n formula_3\nThe concept of pH was developed because ion-selective electrodes, which are used to measure pH, respond to activity. The electrode potential, \"E\", follows the Nernst equation for the hydrogen cation, which can be expressed as:\n formula_4\nwhere \"E\" is a measured potential, \"E\"0 is the standard electrode potential, \"R\" is the molar gas constant, \"T\" is the thermodynamic temperature, \"F\" is the Faraday constant. For , the number of electrons transferred is one. The electrode potential is proportional to pH when pH is defined in terms of activity.\nThe precise measurement of pH is presented in International Standard ISO 31-8 as follows: A galvanic cell is set up to measure the electromotive force (e.m.f.) between a reference electrode and an electrode sensitive to the hydrogen ion activity when they are both immersed in the same aqueous solution. The reference electrode may be a silver chloride electrode or a calomel electrode, and the hydrogen-ion selective electrode is a standard hydrogen electrode.\n Reference electrode | concentrated solution of KCl || test solution | H2 | Pt\nFirstly, the cell is filled with a solution of known hydrogen ion activity and the electromotive force, \"E\"S, is measured. Then the electromotive force, \"E\"X, of the same cell containing the solution of unknown pH is measured.\n formula_5\nThe difference between the two measured electromotive force values is proportional to pH. This method of calibration avoids the need to know the standard electrode potential. The proportionality constant, 1/\"z\", is ideally equal to formula_6, the \"Nernstian slope\".\nIn practice, a glass electrode is used instead of the cumbersome hydrogen electrode. A combined glass electrode has an in-built reference electrode. It is calibrated against Buffer solutions of known hydrogen ion () activity proposed by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC). Two or more buffer solutions are used in order to accommodate the fact that the \"slope\" may differ slightly from ideal. To calibrate the electrode, it is first immersed in a standard solution, and the reading on a pH meter is adjusted to be equal to the standard buffer's value. The reading from a second standard buffer solution is then adjusted using the \"slope\" control to be equal to the pH for that solution. Further details, are given in the IUPAC recommendations. When more than two buffer solutions are used the electrode is calibrated by fitting observed pH values to a straight line with respect to standard buffer values. Commercial standard buffer solutions usually come with information on the value at 25\u00a0\u00b0C and a correction factor to be applied for other temperatures.\nThe pH scale is logarithmic and therefore pH is a dimensionless quantity.\np[H].\nThis was the original definition of S\u00f8rensen in 1909, which was superseded in favor of pH in 1924. [H] is the concentration of hydrogen ions, denoted [] in modern chemistry. More correctly, the thermodynamic activity of (\"a\"H+) in dilute solution should be replaced by []/\"c\"0, where the standard state concentration \"c\"0 = 1\u00a0mol/L. This ratio is a pure number whose logarithm can be defined.\nIt is possible to measure the concentration of hydrogen cations directly using an electrode calibrated in terms of hydrogen ion concentrations. One common method is to titrate a solution of known concentration of a strong acid with a solution of known concentration of strong base in the presence of a relatively high concentration of background electrolyte. By knowing the concentrations of the acid and base, the concentration of hydrogen cations can be calculated and the measured potential can be correlated with concentrations. The calibration is usually carried out using a Gran plot. This procedure makes the activity of hydrogen cations equal to the numerical value of concentration of these ions.\nThe glass electrode (and other Ion selective electrodes) should be calibrated in a medium similar to the one being investigated. For instance, if one wishes to measure the pH of a seawater sample, the electrode should be calibrated in a solution resembling seawater in its chemical composition.\nThe difference between p[H] and pH is quite small, and it has been stated that pH = p[H] + 0.04. However, it is common practice to use the term \"pH\" for both types of measurement.\npOH.\npOH is sometimes used as a measure of the concentration of hydroxide ions, . By definition, pOH is the negative logarithm (to the base 10) of the hydroxide ion concentration (mol/L). pOH values can be derived from pH measurements and vice-versa. The concentration of hydroxide ions in water is related to the concentration of hydrogen cations by\n formula_7\nwhere \"K\"W is the self-ionization constant of water. Taking logarithms,\n formula_8\nSo, at room temperature, pOH \u2248 14 \u2212 pH. (Under otherwise standard conditions, the equation is exact at approximately 24.87 \u00b0C.) However this relationship is not strictly valid in other circumstances, such as in measurements of soil alkalinity.\nMeasurement.\npH Indicators.\npH can be measured using indicators, which change color depending on the pH of the solution they are in. By comparing the color of a test solution to a standard color chart, the pH can be estimated to the nearest whole number. For more precise measurements, the color can be measured using a colorimeter or spectrophotometer. A Universal indicator is a mixture of several indicators that can provide a continuous color change over a range of pH values, typically from about pH 2 to pH 10. Universal indicator paper is made from absorbent paper that has been impregnated with a universal indicator. An alternative method of measuring pH is using an electronic pH meter, which directly measures the voltage difference between a pH-sensitive electrode and a reference electrode.\nNon-aqueous solutions.\npH values can be measured in non-aqueous solutions, but they are based on a different scale from aqueous pH values because the standard states used for calculating hydrogen ion concentrations (activities) are different. The hydrogen ion activity, \"a\"H+, is defined as:\n formula_9\nwhere \"\u03bc\"H+ is the chemical potential of the hydrogen cation, formula_10 is its chemical potential in the chosen standard state, \"R\" is the molar gas constant and \"T\" is the thermodynamic temperature. Therefore, pH values on the different scales cannot be compared directly because of differences in the solvated proton ions, such as lyonium ions, which require an insolvent scale that involves the transfer activity coefficient of hydronium/lyonium ion.\npH is an example of an acidity function, but others can be defined. For example, the Hammett acidity function, \"H\"0, has been developed in connection with Superacids.\nUnified absolute pH scale.\nIn 2010, a new approach to measuring pH was proposed, called the \"unified absolute pH scale\". This approach allows for a common reference standard to be used across different solutions, regardless of their pH range. The unified absolute pH scale is based on the absolute chemical potential of the hydrogen cation, as defined by the Lewis acid\u2013base theory. This scale applies to liquids, gases, and even solids. The advantages of the unified absolute pH scale include consistency, accuracy, and applicability to a wide range of sample types. It is precise and versatile because it serves as a common reference standard for pH measurements. However, implementation efforts, compatibility with existing data, complexity, and potential costs are some challenges.\nExtremes of pH measurements.\nThe measurement of pH can become difficult at extremely acidic or alkaline conditions, such as below pH 2.5 (ca. 0.003\u00a0mol/dm3 acid) or above pH 10.5 (above ca. 0.0003 mol/dm3 alkaline). This is due to the breakdown of the Nernst equation in such conditions when using a glass electrode. Several factors contribute to this problem. First, liquid junction potentials may not be independent of pH. Second, the high ionic strength of concentrated solutions can affect the electrode potentials. At high pH the glass electrode may be affected by \"alkaline error\", because the electrode becomes sensitive to the concentration of cations such as and in the solution. To overcome these problems, specially constructed electrodes are available.\nRunoff from mines or mine tailings can produce some extremely low pH values, down to \u22123.6.\nApplications.\nPure water has a pH of 7 at 25\u00a0\u00b0C, meaning it is neutral. When an acid is dissolved in water, the pH will be less than 7, while a base, or alkali, will have a pH greater than 7. A strong acid, such as hydrochloric acid, at concentration 1\u00a0mol/L has a pH of 0, while a strong alkali like sodium hydroxide, at the same concentration, has a pH of 14. Since pH is a logarithmic scale, a difference of one in pH is equivalent to a tenfold difference in hydrogen ion concentration.\nNeutrality is not exactly 7 at 25\u00a0\u00b0C, but 7 serves as a good approximation in most cases. Neutrality occurs when the concentration of hydrogen cations ([]) equals the concentration of hydroxide ions ([]), or when their activities are equal. Since self-ionization of water holds the product of these concentration [] \u00d7 [] = \"K\"w, it can be seen that at neutrality [] = [] = \u221a\"K\"w, or pH = p\"K\"w/2. p\"K\"w is approximately 14 but depends on ionic strength and temperature, and so the pH of neutrality does also. Pure water and a solution of NaCl in pure water are both neutral, since dissociation of water produces equal numbers of both ions. However the pH of the neutral NaCl solution will be slightly different from that of neutral pure water because the hydrogen and hydroxide ions' activity is dependent on ionic strength, so \"K\"w varies with ionic strength.\nWhen pure water is exposed to air, it becomes mildly acidic. This is because water absorbs carbon dioxide from the air, which is then slowly converted into bicarbonate and hydrogen cations (essentially creating carbonic acid).\n&lt;chem&gt;CO2 + H2O &lt;=&gt; HCO3^- + H^+&lt;/chem&gt;\npH in soil.\nThe United States Department of Agriculture Natural Resources Conservation Service, formerly Soil Conservation Service classifies soil pH ranges as follows:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Table alignment/tables.css\" /&gt;\nTopsoil pH is influenced by soil parent material, erosional effects, climate and vegetation. A recent map of topsoil pH in Europe shows the alkaline soils in Mediterranean, Hungary, East Romania, North France. Scandinavian countries, Portugal, Poland and North Germany have more acid soils.\npH in plants.\nPlants contain pH-dependent pigments that can be used as pH indicators, such as those found in hibiscus, red cabbage (anthocyanin), and grapes (red wine). Citrus fruits have acidic juice primarily due to the presence of citric acid, while other carboxylic acids can be found in various living systems. The protonation state of phosphate derivatives, including ATP, is pH-dependent. Hemoglobin, an oxygen-transport enzyme, is also affected by pH in a phenomenon known as the Root effect.\npH in the ocean.\nThe pH of seawater plays an important role in the ocean's carbon cycle. There is evidence of ongoing ocean acidification (meaning a drop in pH value): Between 1950 and 2020, the average pH of the ocean surface fell from approximately 8.15 to 8.05. Carbon dioxide emissions from human activities are the primary cause of ocean acidification, with atmospheric carbon dioxide levels at 430 ppm CO2 at Mauna Loa observatory in 2025. In 2024, the annual atmospheric CO2 increase measured by the NOAA\u2019s Global Monitoring Laboratory was 3.75 ppm CO2/year. CO2 from the atmosphere is absorbed by the oceans. This produces carbonic acid (H2CO3) which dissociates into a bicarbonate ion (HCO3-) and a hydrogen cation (H+). The presence of free hydrogen cations (H+) lowers the pH of the ocean. \nThree pH scales in oceanography.\nThe measurement of pH in seawater is complicated by the chemical properties of seawater, and three distinct pH scales exist in chemical oceanography. In practical terms, the three seawater pH scales differ in their pH values up to 0.10, differences that are much larger than the accuracy of pH measurements typically required, in particular, in relation to the ocean's carbonate system. Since it omits consideration of sulfate and fluoride ions, the \"free scale\" is significantly different from both the total and seawater scales. Because of the relative unimportance of the fluoride ion, the total and seawater scales differ only very slightly.\nAs part of its operational definition of the pH scale, the IUPAC defines a series of Buffer solutions across a range of pH values (often denoted with National Bureau of Standards (NBS) or National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) designation). These solutions have a relatively low ionic strength (\u2248\u00a00.1) compared to that of seawater (\u2248\u00a00.7), and, as a consequence, are not recommended for use in characterizing the pH of seawater, since the ionic strength differences cause changes in electrode potential. To resolve this problem, an alternative series of buffers based on artificial seawater was developed. This new series resolves the problem of ionic strength differences between samples and the buffers, and the new pH scale is referred to as the \"total scale\", often denoted as pHT. The total scale was defined using a medium containing sulfate ions. These ions experience protonation, + SO42-\u2194 HSO4-, such that the total scale includes the effect of both protons (free hydrogen cations) and hydrogen sulfate ions:\n []T = []F + [HSO4-]\nAn alternative scale, the \"free scale\", often denoted pHF, omits this consideration and focuses solely on []F, in principle making it a simpler representation of hydrogen ion concentration. Only []T can be determined, therefore []F must be estimated using the [SO42-] and the stability constant of HSO4-, \"K\":\n []F = []T \u2212 [HSO4-] = []T ( 1 + [SO42-] / \"K\" )\u22121\nHowever, it is difficult to estimate \"K\" in seawater, limiting the utility of the otherwise more straightforward free scale.\nAnother scale, known as the \"seawater scale\", often denoted pHSWS, takes account of a further protonation relationship between hydrogen cations and fluoride ions, + \u21cc HF. Resulting in the following expression for []SWS:\n []SWS = []F + [HSO4-] + [HF]\nHowever, the advantage of considering this additional complexity is dependent upon the abundance of fluoride in the medium. In seawater, for instance, sulfate ions occur at much greater concentrations (&gt;\u00a0400 times) than those of fluoride. As a consequence, for most practical purposes, the difference between the total and seawater scales is very small.\nThe following three equations summarize the three scales of pH:\n pHF = \u2212log10[]F\n pHT = \u2212log10([]F + [HSO4-]) = \u2212log10[]T\n pHSWS = \u2212log10(]F + [HSO4-] + [HF]) = \u2212log10[v]SWS\npH in food.\nThe pH level of food influences its flavor, texture, and shelf life. Acidic foods, such as citrus fruits, tomatoes, and vinegar, typically have a pH below 4.6 with sharp and tangy taste, while basic foods taste bitter or soapy. Maintaining the appropriate pH in foods is essential for preventing the growth of harmful microorganisms. The alkalinity of vegetables such as spinach and kale can also influence their texture and color during cooking. The pH also influences the Maillard reaction, which is responsible for the browning of food during cooking, impacting both flavor and appearance.\npH of various body fluids.\nIn living organisms, the pH of various body fluids, cellular compartments, and organs is tightly regulated to maintain a state of acid\u2013base balance known as acid\u2013base homeostasis. Acidosis, defined by blood pH below 7.35, is the most common disorder of acid\u2013base homeostasis and occurs when there is an excess of acid in the body. In contrast, alkalosis is characterized by excessively high blood pH.\nBlood pH is usually slightly alkaline, with a pH of 7.365, referred to as physiological pH in biology and medicine. Plaque formation in teeth can create a local acidic environment that results in tooth decay through demineralization. Enzymes and other proteins have an optimal pH range for function and can become inactivated or denatured outside this range.\npH calculations.\nWhen calculating the pH of a solution containing acids or bases, a chemical speciation calculation is used to determine the concentration of all chemical species present in the solution. The complexity of the procedure depends on the nature of the solution. Strong acids and bases are compounds that are almost completely dissociated in water, which simplifies the calculation. However, for weak acids, a quadratic equation must be solved, and for weak bases, a cubic equation is required. In general, a set of non-linear simultaneous equations must be solved.\nWater itself is a weak acid and a weak base, so its dissociation must be taken into account at high pH and low solute concentration (see \"Amphoterism\"). It dissociates according to the equilibrium\nwith a dissociation constant, \"K\"w defined as\n formula_11\nwhere [H+] stands for the concentration of the aqueous hydronium ion and [OH\u2212] represents the concentration of the hydroxide ion. This equilibrium needs to be taken into account at high pH and when the solute concentration is extremely low.\nStrong acids and bases.\nStrong acids and bases are compounds that are essentially fully dissociated in water. This means that in an acidic solution, the concentration of hydrogen cations (H+) can be considered equal to the concentration of the acid. Similarly, in a basic solution, the concentration of hydroxide ions (OH\u2212) can be considered equal to the concentration of the base. The pH of a solution is defined as the negative logarithm of the concentration of H+, and the pOH is defined as the negative logarithm of the concentration of OH\u2212. For example, the pH of a 0.01\u00a0M solution of hydrochloric acid (HCl) is equal to 2 (pH = \u2212log10(0.01)), while the pOH of a 0.01\u00a0M solution of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) is equal to 2 (pOH = \u2212log10(0.01)), which corresponds to a pH of about 12.\nHowever, self-ionization of water must also be considered when concentrations of a strong acid or base is very low or high. For instance, a solution of HCl would be expected to have a pH of 7.3 based on the above procedure, which is incorrect as it is acidic and should have a pH of less than 7. In such cases, the system can be treated as a mixture of the acid or base and water, which is an amphoteric substance. By accounting for the self-ionization of water, the true pH of the solution can be calculated. For example, a solution of HCl would have a pH of 6.89 when treated as a mixture of HCl and water. The self-ionization equilibrium of solutions of sodium hydroxide at higher concentrations must also be considered.\nWeak acids and bases.\nA weak acid or the conjugate acid of a weak base can be treated using the same formalism.\nFirst, an acid dissociation constant is defined as follows. Electrical charges are omitted from subsequent equations for the sake of generality\n formula_12\nand its value is assumed to have been determined by experiment. This being so, there are three unknown concentrations, [HA], [H+] and [A\u2212] to determine by calculation. Two additional equations are needed. One way to provide them is to apply the law of mass conservation in terms of the two \"reagents\" H and A.\n formula_13\n formula_14\n\"C\" stands for analytical concentration. In some texts, one mass balance equation is replaced by an equation of charge balance. This is satisfactory for simple cases like this one, but is more difficult to apply to more complicated cases as those below. Together with the equation defining \"K\"a, there are now three equations in three unknowns. When an acid is dissolved in water \"C\"A = \"C\"H = \"C\"a, the concentration of the acid, so [A] = [H]. After some further algebraic manipulation an equation in the hydrogen ion concentration may be obtained.\n formula_15\nSolution of this quadratic equation gives the hydrogen ion concentration and hence p[H] or, more loosely, pH. This procedure is illustrated in an ICE table which can also be used to calculate the pH when some additional (strong) acid or alkaline has been added to the system, that is, when \"C\"A \u2260 \"C\"H.\nFor example, what is the pH of a 0.01\u00a0M solution of benzoic acid, p\"K\"a = 4.19?\nFor alkaline solutions, an additional term is added to the mass-balance equation for hydrogen. Since the addition of hydroxide reduces the hydrogen ion concentration, and the hydroxide ion concentration is constrained by the self-ionization equilibrium to be equal to formula_19, the resulting equation is:\n formula_20\nGeneral method.\nSome systems, such as with polyprotic acids, are amenable to spreadsheet calculations. With three or more reagents or when many complexes are formed with general formulae such as ApBqHr, the following general method can be used to calculate the pH of a solution. For example, with three reagents, each equilibrium is characterized by an equilibrium constant, \"\u03b2\".\n formula_21\nNext, write down the mass-balance equations for each reagent:\n formula_22\nThere are no approximations involved in these equations, except that each stability constant is defined as a quotient of concentrations, not activities. Much more complicated expressions are required if activities are to be used.\nThere are three simultaneous equations in the three unknowns, [A], [B] and [H]. Because the equations are non-linear and their concentrations may range over many powers of 10, the solution of these equations is not straightforward. However, many computer programs are available which can be used to perform these calculations. There may be more than three reagents. The calculation of hydrogen ion concentrations, using this approach, is a key element in the determination of equilibrium constants by potentiometric titration.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It can exist in a variety of forms, including a stick, a square, a pebble, and a pan of color, among other forms. The pigments used in pastels are similar to those used to produce some other colored visual arts media, such as oil paints; the binder is of a neutral hue and low saturation. The color effect of pastels is closer to the natural dry pigments than that of any other process.\nPastels have been used by artists since the Renaissance, and gained considerable popularity in the 18th century, when a number of notable artists made pastel their primary medium.\nAn artwork made using pastels is called a pastel (or a pastel drawing or pastel painting). \"Pastel\" used as a verb means to produce an artwork with pastels; as an adjective it means pale in color.\nPastel media.\nPastel sticks or crayons consist of powdered pigment combined with a binder. The exact composition and characteristics of an individual pastel stick depend on the type of pastel and the type and amount of binder used. It also varies by individual manufacturer.\nDry pastels have historically used binders such as gum arabic and gum tragacanth. Methyl cellulose was introduced as a binder in the 20th century. Often a chalk or gypsum component is present. They are available in varying degrees of hardness, the softer varieties being wrapped in paper. Some pastel brands use pumice in the binder to abrade the paper and create more tooth.\nDry pastel media can be subdivided as follows:\nIn addition, pastels using a different approach to manufacture have been developed:\nThere has been some debate within art societies as to what exactly qualifies as a pastel. The Pastel Society within the UK (the oldest pastel society) states the following are acceptable media for its exhibitions: \"Pastels, including Oil pastel, Charcoal, Pencil, Cont\u00e9, Sanguine, or any dry media\". The emphasis appears to be on \"dry media\" but the debate continues.\nManufacture.\nIn order to create hard and soft pastels, pigments are ground into a paste with water and a gum binder and then rolled, pressed or extruded into sticks. The name \"pastel\" is derived from Medieval Latin \"woad paste,\" from Late Latin \"paste.\" The French word \"pastel\" first appeared in 1662.\nMost brands produce gradations of a color, the original pigment of which tends to be dark, from pure pigment to near-white by mixing in differing quantities of chalk. This mixing of pigments with chalks is the origin of the word \"pastel\" in reference to pale color as it is commonly used in cosmetic and fashion contexts.\nA pastel is made by letting the sticks move over an abrasive ground, leaving color on the grain of the painting surface. When fully covered with pastel, the work is called a pastel \"painting\"; when not, a pastel \"sketch\" or \"drawing\". Pastel paintings, being made with a medium that has the highest pigment concentration of all, reflect light without darkening refraction, allowing for very saturated colors.\nPastel supports.\nPastel supports need to provide a \"tooth\" for the pastel to adhere and hold the pigment in place. Supports include:\nProtection of pastel paintings.\nPastels can be used to produce a permanent painting if the artist meets appropriate archival considerations. This means:\nFor these reasons, some pastelists avoid the use of a fixative except in cases where the pastel has been overworked so much that the surface will no longer hold any more pastel. The fixative will restore the \"tooth\" and more pastel can be applied on top. It is the tooth of the painting surface that holds the pastels, not a fixative. Abrasive supports avoid or minimize the need to apply further fixative in this way.\nGlassine (paper) is used by artists to protect artwork which is being stored or transported. Some good quality books of pastel papers also include glassine to separate pages.\nTechniques.\nPastel techniques can be challenging since the medium is mixed and blended directly on the working surface, and unlike paint, colors cannot be tested on a palette before applying to the surface. Pastel errors cannot be covered the way a paint error can be painted out. Experimentation with the pastel medium on a small scale in order to learn various techniques gives the user a better command over a larger composition.\nPastels have some techniques in common with painting, such as blending, masking, building up layers of color, adding accents and highlighting, and shading. Some techniques are characteristic of both pastels and sketching mediums such as charcoal and lead, for example, hatching and crosshatching, and gradation. Other techniques are particular to the pastel medium.\nHealth and safety hazards.\nPastels are a dry medium and produce a great deal of dust, which can cause respiratory irritation. More seriously, pastels might use the same pigments as artists' paints, many of which are toxic. For example, exposure to cadmium pigments, which are common and popular bright yellows, oranges, and reds, can lead to cadmium poisoning. Pastel artists, who use the pigments without a strong painting binder, are especially susceptible to such poisoning. For this reason, many modern pastels are made using substitutions for cadmium, chromium, and other toxic pigments, while retaining the traditional pigment names. All brands that have the AP Label by ASTM International are not considered toxic, and they might use extremely insoluble varieties of cadmium or cobalt pigments that will not be readily absorbed by the human body. Although less toxic when swallowed, they should still be treated with care.\nPastel art in art history.\nThe manufacture of pastels originated in the 15th century. The pastel medium was mentioned by Leonardo da Vinci, who learned of it from the French artist Jean Perr\u00e9al after that artist's arrival in Milan in 1499. Pastel was sometimes used as a medium for preparatory studies by 16th-century artists, notably Federico Barocci. The first French artist to specialize in pastel portraits was Joseph Vivien.\nDuring the 18th century the medium became fashionable for portrait painting, sometimes in a mixed technique with gouache. Pastel was an important medium for artists such as Jean-Baptiste Perronneau, Maurice Quentin de La Tour (who never painted in oils), and Rosalba Carriera. The pastel still life paintings and portraits of Jean-Baptiste-Sim\u00e9on Chardin are much admired, as are the works of the Swiss-French artist Jean-\u00c9tienne Liotard. In 18th-century England the outstanding practitioner was John Russell. In Colonial America, John Singleton Copley used pastel occasionally for portraits.\nIn France, pastel briefly became unpopular during and after the Revolution, as the medium was identified with the frivolity of the Ancien R\u00e9gime. By the mid-19th century, French artists such as Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix and especially Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Millet were again making significant use of pastel. Their countryman \u00c9douard Manet painted a number of portraits in pastel on canvas, an unconventional ground for the medium. Edgar Degas was an innovator in pastel technique, and used it with an almost expressionist vigor after about 1885, when it became his primary medium. Odilon Redon produced a large body of works in pastel.\nJames Abbott McNeill Whistler produced a quantity of pastels around 1880, including a body of work relating to Venice, and this probably contributed to a growing enthusiasm for the medium in the United States. In particular, he demonstrated how few strokes were required to evoke a place or an atmosphere. Mary Cassatt, an American artist active in France, introduced the Impressionists and pastel to her friends in Philadelphia and Washington.\nAccording to the Metropolitan Museum of Art's \"Time Line of Art History: Nineteenth Century American Drawings\": &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;[Among American artists] by far the most graphic and, at the same time, most painterly wielding of pastel was Cassatt's in Europe, where she had worked closely in the medium with her mentor Edgar Degas and vigorously captured familial moments such as the one revealed in \"Mother Playing with Child\".\nOn the East Coast of the United States, the Society of Painters in Pastel was founded in 1883 by William Merritt Chase, Robert Blum, and others. The Pastellists, led by Leon Dabo, was organized in New York in late 1910 and included among its ranks Everett Shinn and Arthur Bowen Davies. On the American West Coast the influential artist and teacher Pedro Joseph de Lemos, who served as Chief Administrator of the San Francisco Art Institute and Director of the Stanford University Museum and Art Gallery, popularized pastels in regional exhibitions. Beginning in 1919 de Lemos published a series of articles on \"painting\" with pastels, which included such notable innovations as allowing the intensity of light on the subject to determine the distinct color of laid paper and the use of special optics for making \"night sketches\" in both urban and rural settings. His night scenes, which were often called \"dreamscapes\" in the press, were influenced by French Symbolism, and especially Odilon Redon.\nPastels have been favored by many modern and contemporary artists because of the medium's broad range of bright colors. Recent notable artists who have worked extensively in pastels include Fernando Botero, Francesco Clemente, Daniel Greene, Wolf Kahn, Paula Rego and R. B. Kitaj.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences and sources.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Pen pals are usually strangers whose relationship is based primarily, or even solely, on their exchange of letters. Occasionally, pen pals may already have a relationship that is not regularly conducted in person.\nPurposes.\nA pen pal relationship is usually based around cultural exchange and developing a friendship. Other types of reasons that people may penpal include, the exchange of language, postcards, parcels and mail art. Pen pal clubs can nowadays be found on the Internet, in magazine columns, newspapers, social media sites and sometimes through clubs or special interest groups. Despite various news articles, penpalling is as popular as ever, but it has transformed over the years.\nOrganizations.\nMany pen pals meet each other through organizations that bring people together for this purpose.\nOrganizations can be split into three main categories: free, partial subscription, and subscription-based clubs. Free clubs are usually funded by advertising and profiles are not reviewed, whereas subscription-based clubs will usually not contain any advertising and will have an administrator approving profiles to the database.\nWhile the traditional snail mail pen pal relationship has fallen into a decline due to modern technology closing the world's communication gap, prison pen pal services have combined technology with traditional letter writing. These sites allow prisoners to place pen pal ads online; however, inmates in the United States and most of the world are not permitted to access the Internet. Therefore, the pen pal relationships with inmates are still conducted via postal mail. Other pen pal organizations have survived by embracing the technology of the Internet.\nIn popular culture.\nThe Australian author Geraldine Brooks wrote a memoir entitled \"Foreign Correspondence\" (1997), about her childhood which was enriched by her exchanges of letters with other children in Australia and overseas, and her travels as an adult in search of the people they had become.\nIn the 1970s, the syndicated children's television program \"Big Blue Marble\" often invited viewers to write to them for their own pen pal.\nOn another children's TV show, \"Pee-wee's Playhouse\", Pee-wee Herman would often receive pen pal letters.\nIn the \"Peanuts\" comic strip from the 1960s and 1970s, Charlie Brown tries to write to a pen pal using a fountain pen, but after several literally \"botched\" attempts, Charlie switches to using a pencil and referring to his penpal as his \"pencil-pal\"; his first letter to his \"pencil-pal\" explains the reason for the name change. In the animated feature film adaptation, \"The Peanuts Movie\", this hobby enables the story to have a happy ending with Charlie Brown to have an active friendship with his dream girl, the Little Red-Haired Girl, in a way that he feels comfortable without significantly affecting the franchise's story world.\nThe Bollywood film \"Romance\" (1983) is about two people, Amar (from India) and Sonia (from the UK) who fall in love after becoming pen pals. The Bollywood film \"Sirf Tum\" (1999) has a similar storyline.\nThe film \"You've Got Mail\" (1998) is a romantic comedy about two people in a pen pal email courtship who are unaware that they are also business rivals.\nThe action-drama film \"Out of Reach\" (2004) is about a pen pal relationship between a Vietnam War veteran and a 13-year-old orphaned girl from Poland. When the letters suddenly stop coming, the veteran heads to Poland to find out the reason.\nThe film \"A Cinderella Story\" (2004) is a teen romantic comedy about two people in a pen pal email courtship who plan to meet in person at their high school's Halloween dance.\nThe claymation film \"Mary and Max\" (2009) is about the pen pal relationship between an American man and an Australian girl.\nIn the 2012 film \"Moonrise Kingdom\" the characters Suzy and Sam become pen pals.\nMusicians Jetty Rae and Heath McNease have collaborated under the moniker \"Pen Pals\".\nIn 2025, a Singaporean and a Newfoundlander who exchanged letters for over four decades, starting in 1983 as schoolgirls, met in person for the first time.

He is widely regarded as one of the most influential composers of the late 20th century. Glass's work has been associated with minimalism, being built up from repetitive phrases and shifting layers. He described himself as a composer of \"music with repetitive structures\", which he has helped to evolve stylistically.\nGlass founded the Philip Glass Ensemble in 1968. He has written 15 operas, numerous chamber operas and musical theatre works, 14 symphonies, 12 concertos, nine string quartets, various other chamber music pieces, and many film scores. He has received nominations for four Grammy Awards, including two for Best Contemporary Classical Composition for \"Satyagraha\" (1987) and \"String Quartet No. 2\" (1988). He has received three Academy Award for Best Original Score nominations for Martin Scorsese's \"Kundun\" (1997), Stephen Daldry's \"The Hours\" (2002), and Richard Eyre's \"Notes on a Scandal\" (2006). He also composed the scores for \"\" (1985), \"Hamburger Hill\" (1987), \"The Thin Blue Line\" (1988), \"Candyman\" (1992), \"The Truman Show\" (1998), and \"The Illusionist\" (2006).\nGlass is known for composing the operas \"Einstein on the Beach\" (1976), \"Satyagraha\" (1980), \"Akhnaten\" (1983), \"The Voyage\" (1992), and \"The Perfect American\" (2013). He also wrote the scores for Broadway productions such as the revivals of \"The Elephant Man\" (2002), \"The Crucible\" (2016), and \"King Lear\" (2019). For the latter he won the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Music in a Play.\nGlass has received many accolades, including a BAFTA Award, a Drama Desk Award, and a Golden Globe Award, as well as nominations for three Academy Awards, four Grammy Awards, and a Primetime Emmy Award. He has also received the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres in 1995, the National Medal of Arts in 2010, the Kennedy Center Honors in 2018, and the Grammy Trustees Award in 2020. In 2025, he received a Lifetime Achievement from the World Soundtrack Academy.\nEarly life and education.\nGlass was born in Baltimore, Maryland, on January 31, 1937, the son of Ida (n\u00e9e Gouline) and Benjamin Charles Glass. His family were Latvian-Jewish and Russian-Jewish emigrants. His father owned a record store and his mother was a librarian. In his memoir, Glass recalls that at the end of World War\u00a0II his mother aided Jewish Holocaust survivors, inviting recent arrivals to America to stay at their home until they could find a job and a place to live. She developed a plan to help them learn English and develop skills so they could find work. His sister, Sheppie, would later do similar work as an active member of the International Rescue Committee.\nGlass developed his appreciation of music from his father, discovering later that his father's side of the family had many musicians. His cousin Cevia was a classical pianist, while others had been in vaudeville. He learned his family was also related to Al Jolson. Glass's father often received promotional copies of new recordings at his music store. Glass spent many hours listening to them, developing his knowledge of and taste in music. This openness to modern sounds affected Glass at an early age:&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe elder Glass promoted both new recordings and a wide selection of composers to his customers, sometimes convincing them to try something new by allowing them to return records they did not like. His store soon developed a reputation as Baltimore's leading source of modern music. Glass built a sizable record collection from the unsold records in his father's store, including modern classical music such as Hindemith, Bart\u00f3k, Schoenberg, Shostakovich and Western classical music including Beethoven's string quartets and Schubert's B\u266d Piano Trio. Glass cites Schubert's work as a \"big influence\" growing up. In a 2011 interview, Glass stated that Franz Schubert\u2014with whom he shares a birthday\u2014is his favorite composer.\nHe studied the flute as a child at the Peabody Preparatory of the Peabody Institute of Music. At the age of 15, he entered an accelerated college program at the University of Chicago where he studied mathematics and philosophy. In Chicago, he discovered the serialism of Anton Webern and composed a twelve-tone string trio. In 1954, Glass traveled to Paris, where he encountered the films of Jean Cocteau, which made a lasting impression on him. He visited artists' studios and saw their work; Glass recalls, \"the bohemian life you see in [Cocteau's] \"Orph\u00e9e\" was the life I ... was attracted to, and those were the people I hung out with.\"\nGlass studied at the Juilliard School of Music where the keyboard was his main instrument. His composition teachers included Vincent Persichetti and William Bergsma. Fellow students included Steve Reich and Peter Schickele. In 1959, he was a winner in the BMI Foundation's BMI Student Composer Awards, an international prize for young composers. In the summer of 1960, he studied with Darius Milhaud at the summer school of the Aspen Music Festival and composed a violin concerto for a fellow student, Dorothy Pixley-Rothschild. After leaving Juilliard in 1962, Glass moved to Pittsburgh and worked as a school-based composer-in-residence in the public school system, composing various choral, chamber, and orchestral music.\nCareer.\n1964\u20131966: Paris.\nIn 1964, Glass received a Fulbright Scholarship; his studies in Paris with the eminent composition teacher Nadia Boulanger, from autumn of 1964 to summer of 1966, influenced his work throughout his life, as the composer admitted in 1979: \"The composers I studied with Boulanger are the people I still think about most\u2014Bach and Mozart.\"\nGlass later wrote in his autobiography \"Music by Philip Glass\" in 1987 that the new music performed at Pierre Boulez's \"Domaine Musical\" concerts in Paris lacked any excitement for him (with the notable exceptions of music by John Cage and Morton Feldman), but he was deeply impressed by new films and theatre performances. His move away from modernist composers such as Boulez and Stockhausen was nuanced, rather than outright rejection: \"That generation wanted disciples and as we didn't join up it was taken to mean that we hated the music, which wasn't true. We'd studied them at Juilliard and knew their music. How on earth can you reject Berio? Those early works of Stockhausen are still beautiful. But there was just no point in attempting to do their music better than they did and so we started somewhere else.\"\nDuring this time, he encountered revolutionary films of the French New Wave, such as those of Jean-Luc Godard and Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut, which upended the rules set by an older generation of artists, and Glass made friends with American visual artists (the sculptor Richard Serra and his wife Nancy Graves), actors and directors (JoAnne Akalaitis, Ruth Maleczech, David Warrilow, and Lee Breuer, with whom Glass later founded the experimental theatre group Mabou Mines). Together with Akalaitis (they married in 1965), Glass in turn attended performances by theatre groups including Jean-Louis Barrault's Od\u00e9on theatre, The Living Theatre and the Berliner Ensemble in 1964 to 1965. These significant encounters resulted in a collaboration with Breuer for which Glass contributed music for a 1965 staging of Samuel Beckett's \"Com\u00e9die\" (\"Play\", 1963). The resulting piece (written for two soprano saxophones) was directly influenced by the play's open-ended, repetitive and almost musical structure and was the first one of a series of four early pieces in a minimalist, yet still dissonant, idiom. After \"Play\", Glass also acted in 1966 as music director of a Breuer production of Brecht's \"Mother Courage and Her Children\", featuring the theatre score by Paul Dessau.\nIn parallel with his early excursions in experimental theatre, Glass worked in winter 1965 and spring 1966 as a music director and composer on a film score (\"Chappaqua\", Conrad Rooks, 1966) with Ravi Shankar and Alla Rakha, which added another important influence on Glass's musical thinking. His distinctive style arose from his work with Shankar and Rakha and their perception of rhythm in Indian music as being entirely additive. He renounced all his compositions in a moderately modern style resembling Milhaud's, Aaron Copland's, and Samuel Barber's, and began writing pieces based on repetitive structures of Indian music and a sense of time influenced by Samuel Beckett: a piece for two actresses and chamber ensemble, a work for chamber ensemble and his first numbered string quartet (No. 1, 1966).\nGlass then left Paris for northern India in 1966, where he came in contact with Tibetan refugees and began to gravitate towards Buddhism. He met Tenzin Gyatso, the 14th Dalai Lama, in 1972, and has been a strong supporter of the Tibetan independence ever since.\n1967\u20131974: Minimalism: From \"Strung Out\" to \"Music in 12 Parts\".\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nGlass' musical style is instantly recognizable, with its trademark churning ostinatos, undulating arpeggios and repeating rhythms that morph over various lengths of time atop broad fields of tonal harmony. That style has taken permanent root in our pop-middlebrow sensibility. Glass' music is now indelibly a part of our cultural lingua franca, just a click away on YouTube.\nJohn von Rhein, \"Chicago Tribune\" writer\nShortly after arriving in New York City in March 1967, Glass attended a performance of works by Steve Reich (including the ground-breaking minimalist piece \"Piano Phase\"), which left a deep impression on him; he simplified his style and turned to a radical \"consonant vocabulary\". Finding little sympathy from traditional performers and performance spaces, Glass eventually formed an ensemble with fellow ex-student Jon Gibson, and others, and began performing mainly in art galleries and studio lofts of SoHo. The visual artist Richard Serra provided Glass with Gallery contacts, while both collaborated on various sculptures, films and installations; from 1971 to 1974, he was Serra's regular studio assistant.\nBetween summer of 1967 and the end of 1968, Glass composed nine works, including \"Strung Out\" (for amplified solo violin, composed in summer of 1967), \"Gradus\" (for solo saxophone, 1968), \"Music in the Shape of a Square\" (for two flutes, composed in May 1968, an homage to Erik Satie), \"How Now\" (for solo piano, 1968) and \"1+1\" (for amplified tabletop, November 1968) which were \"clearly designed to experiment more fully with his new-found minimalist approach\". The first concert of Glass's new music was at Jonas Mekas's Film-Makers Cinemath\u00e8que (Anthology Film Archives) in September 1968. This concert included the first work of this series with \"Strung Out\" (performed by the violinist Pixley-Rothschild) and \"Music in the Shape of a Square\" (performed by Glass and Gibson). The musical scores were tacked on the wall, and the performers had to move while playing. Glass's new works met with a very enthusiastic response by the audience which consisted mainly of visual and performance artists who were highly sympathetic to Glass's reductive approach.\nApart from his music career, Glass had a moving company with his cousin, the sculptor Jene Highstein, and also worked as a plumber and cab driver (during 1973 to 1978). He recounts installing a dishwasher and looking up from his work to see an astonished Robert Hughes, \"Time\" magazine's art critic, staring at him. During this time, he made friends with other New York-based artists such as Sol LeWitt, Nancy Graves, Michael Snow, Bruce Nauman, Laurie Anderson, and Chuck Close (who created a now-famous portrait of Glass). (Glass returned the compliment in 2005 with \"A Musical Portrait of Chuck Close\" for piano.)\nWith \"1+1\" and \"Two Pages\" (composed in February 1969), Glass turned to a more \"rigorous approach\" to his \"most basic minimalist technique, additive process\", pieces which were followed in the same year by \"Music in Contrary Motion\" and \"Music in Fifths\" (a kind of homage to his composition teacher Nadia Boulanger, who pointed out \"hidden fifths\" in his works but regarded them as cardinal sins). Eventually Glass's music grew less austere, becoming more complex and dramatic, with pieces such as \"Music in Similar Motion\" (1969), and \"Music with Changing Parts\" (1970). These pieces were performed by the Philip Glass Ensemble in the Whitney Museum of American Art in 1969 and in the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in 1970, often encountering hostile reaction from critics, but Glass's music was also met with enthusiasm from younger artists such as Brian Eno and David Bowie (at the Royal College of Art ca. 1970). Eno described this encounter with Glass's music as one of the \"most extraordinary musical experiences of [his] life\", as a \"viscous bath of pure, thick energy\", concluding \"this was actually the most detailed music I'd ever heard. It was all intricacy, exotic harmonics\". In 1970, Glass returned to the theatre, composing music for the theatre group Mabou Mines, resulting in his first minimalist pieces employing voices: \"Red Horse Animation\" and \"Music for Voices\" (both 1970, and premiered at the Paula Cooper Gallery).\nAfter differences of opinion with Steve Reich in 1971, Glass formed the Philip Glass Ensemble (while Reich formed Steve Reich and Musicians), an amplified ensemble including keyboards, wind instruments (saxophones, flutes), and soprano voices.\nGlass's music for his ensemble culminated in the four-hour-long \"Music in Twelve Parts\" (1971\u20131974), which began as a single piece with twelve instrumental parts but developed into a cycle that summed up Glass's musical achievement since 1967, and even transcended it\u2014the last part features a twelve-tone theme, sung by the soprano voice of the ensemble. \"I had broken the rules of modernism and so I thought it was time to break some of my own rules\", according to Glass. Though he finds the term minimalist inaccurate to describe his later work, Glass does accept this term for pieces up to and including \"Music in 12 Parts\", excepting this last part which \"was the end of minimalism\" for Glass. As he pointed out: \"I had worked for eight or nine years inventing a system, and now I'd written through it and come out the other end.\" He now prefers to describe himself as a composer of \"music with repetitive structures\".\n1975\u20131979: Another Look at Harmony: The Portrait Trilogy.\nGlass continued his work with a series of instrumental works, called \"Another Look at Harmony\" (1975\u20131977). For Glass, this series demonstrated a new start, hence the title: \"What I was looking for was a way of combining harmonic progression with the rhythmic structure I had been developing, to produce a new overall structure. ... I'd taken everything out with my early works and it was now time to decide just what I wanted to put in\u2014a process that would occupy me for several years to come.\"\nParts 1 and 2 of \"Another Look at Harmony\" were included in a collaboration with Robert Wilson, a piece of musical theater later designated by Glass as the first opera of his portrait opera trilogy: \"Einstein on the Beach\". Composed in spring to fall of 1975 in close collaboration with Wilson, Glass's first opera was first premiered in summer 1976 at the Festival d'Avignon, and in November of the same year to a mixed and partly enthusiastic reaction from the audience at the Metropolitan Opera in New York City. Scored for the Philip Glass Ensemble, solo violin, chorus, and featuring actors (reciting texts by Christopher Knowles, Lucinda Childs and Samuel M. Johnson), Glass's and Wilson's essentially plotless opera was conceived as a \"metaphorical look at Albert Einstein: scientist, humanist, amateur musician\u2014and the man whose theories ... led to the splitting of the atom\", evoking nuclear holocaust in the climactic scene, as critic Tim Page pointed out. As with \"Another Look at Harmony\", \"\"Einstein\" added a new functional harmony that set it apart from the early conceptual works\". Composer Tom Johnson came to the same conclusion, comparing the solo violin music to Johann Sebastian Bach, and the \"organ figures ... to those Alberti basses Mozart loved so much\". The piece was praised by \"The Washington Post\" as \"one of the seminal artworks of the century\".\n\"Einstein on the Beach\" was followed by further music for projects by the theatre group Mabou Mines such as \"Dressed like an Egg\" (1975), and again music for plays and adaptations from prose by Samuel Beckett, such as \"The Lost Ones\" (1975), \"Cascando\" (1975), \"Mercier and Camier\" (1979). Glass also turned to other media; two multi-movement instrumental works for the Philip Glass Ensemble originated as music for film and TV: \"North Star\" (1977 score for the documentary \"\" by Fran\u00e7ois de Menil and Barbara Rose) and four short cues for the children's TV series \"Sesame Street\" named \"Geometry of Circles\" (1979).\nAnother series, \"Fourth Series\" (1977\u201379), included music for chorus and organ (\"Part One\", 1977), organ and piano (\"Part Two\" and \"Part Four\", 1979), and music for a radio adaption of Constance DeJong's novel \"Modern Love\" (\"Part Three\", 1978). \"Part Two\" and \"Part Four\" were used (and hence renamed) in two dance productions by choreographer Lucinda Childs (who had already contributed to and performed in \"Einstein on the Beach\"). \"Part Two\" was included in \"Dance\" (a collaboration with visual artist Sol LeWitt, 1979), and \"Part Four\" was renamed as \"Mad Rush\", and performed by Glass on several occasions such as the first public appearance of the 14th Dalai Lama in New York City in fall 1981. The piece demonstrates Glass's turn to more traditional models: the composer added a conclusion to an open-structured piece which \"can be interpreted as a sign that he [had] abandoned the radical non-narrative, undramatic approaches of his early period\", as the pianist Steffen Schleiermacher points out.\nIn spring 1978, Glass received a commission from the Netherlands Opera (as well as a Rockefeller Foundation grant) which \"marked the end of his need to earn money from non-musical employment\". With the commission Glass continued his work in music theater, composing his opera \"Satyagraha\" (composed in 1978\u20131979, premiered in 1980 at Rotterdam), based on the early life of Mahatma Gandhi in South Africa, Leo Tolstoy, Rabindranath Tagore, and Martin Luther King Jr. For \"Satyagraha\", Glass worked in close collaboration with two \"SoHo friends\": the writer Constance deJong, who provided the libretto, and the set designer Robert Israel. This piece was in other ways a turning point for Glass, as it was his first work since 1963 scored for symphony orchestra, even if the most prominent parts were still reserved for solo voices and chorus. Shortly after completing the score in August 1979, Glass met the conductor Dennis Russell Davies, whom he helped prepare for performances in Germany (using a piano-four-hands version of the score); together they started to plan another opera, to be premiered at the Stuttgart State Opera.\n1980\u20131986: Completing the Portrait Trilogy: \"Akhnaten\" and beyond.\nWhile planning a third part of his \"Portrait Trilogy\", Glass turned to smaller music theatre projects such as the non-narrative \"Madrigal Opera\" (for six voices and violin and viola, 1980), and \"The Photographer\", a biographic study on the photographer Eadweard Muybridge (1982). Glass also continued to write for the orchestra with the score of \"Koyaanisqatsi\" (Godfrey Reggio, 1981\u20131982). Some pieces which were not used in the film (such as \"Fa\u00e7ades\") eventually appeared on the album \"Glassworks\" (1982, CBS Records), which brought Glass's music to a wider public.\nThe \"Portrait Trilogy\" was completed with \"Akhnaten\" (1982\u20131983, premiered in 1984), a vocal and orchestral composition sung in Akkadian, Biblical Hebrew, and Ancient Egyptian. In addition, this opera featured an actor reciting ancient Egyptian texts in the language of the audience. \"Akhnaten\" was commissioned by the Stuttgart Opera in a production designed by Achim Freyer. It premiered simultaneously at the Houston Opera in a production directed by David Freeman and designed by Peter Sellars. At the time of the commission, the Stuttgart Opera House was undergoing renovation, necessitating the use of a nearby playhouse with a smaller orchestra pit. Upon learning this, Glass and conductor Dennis Russell Davies visited the playhouse, placing music stands around the pit to determine how many players the pit could accommodate. The two found they could not fit a full orchestra in the pit. Glass decided to eliminate the violins, which had the effect of \"giving the orchestra a low, dark sound that came to characterize the piece and suited the subject very well\". As Glass remarked in 1992, \"Akhnaten\" is significant in his work since it represents a \"first extension out of a triadic harmonic language\", an experiment with the polytonality of his teachers Persichetti and Milhaud, a musical technique which Glass compares to \"an optical illusion, such as in the paintings of Josef Albers\".\nGlass again collaborated with Robert Wilson on another opera, \"\" (1983, premiered in 1984), which also functioned as the final part (the Rome section) of Wilson's epic work by the same name, originally planned for an \"international arts festival that would accompany the Olympic Games in Los Angeles\". (Glass also composed a prestigious work for chorus and orchestra for the opening of the Games, \"The Olympian: Lighting of the Torch and Closing \"). The premiere of \"The CIVIL warS\" in Los Angeles never materialized and the opera was in the end premiered at the Opera of Rome. Glass's and Wilson's opera includes musical settings of Latin texts by the 1st-century-Roman playwright Seneca and allusions to the music of Giuseppe Verdi and from the American Civil War, featuring the 19th century figures Giuseppe Garibaldi and Robert E. Lee as characters.\nIn the mid-1980s, Glass produced \"works in different media at an extraordinarily rapid pace\". Projects from that period include music for dance (Glass Pieces choreographed for New York City Ballet by Jerome Robbins in 1983 to a score drawn from existing Glass compositions created for other media including an excerpt from \"Akhnaten\"; and \"In the Upper Room\", Twyla Tharp, 1986), music for theatre productions \"Endgame\" (1984) and \"Company\" (1983). Beckett vehemently disapproved of the production of \"Endgame\" at the American Repertory Theater (Cambridge, Massachusetts), which featured JoAnne Akalaitis's direction and Glass's \"Prelude\" for timpani and double bass, but in the end, he authorized the music for \"Company\", four short, intimate pieces for string quartet that were played in the intervals of the dramatization. This composition was initially regarded by the composer as a piece of Gebrauchsmusik ('music for use')\u2014\"like salt and pepper ... just something for the table\", as he noted. Eventually \"Company\" was published as Glass's String Quartet No. 2 and in a version for string orchestra, being performed by ensembles ranging from student orchestras to renowned formations such as the Kronos Quartet and the Kremerata Baltica.\nThis interest in writing for the string quartet and the string orchestra led to a chamber and orchestral film score for \"\" (Paul Schrader, 1984\u201385), which Glass recently described as his \"musical turning point\" that developed his \"technique of film scoring in a very special way\".\nGlass also dedicated himself to vocal works with two sets of songs, \"Three Songs for chorus\" (1984, settings of poems by Leonard Cohen, Octavio Paz and Raymond L\u00e9vesque), and a song cycle initiated by CBS Masterworks Records: \"Songs from Liquid Days\" (1985), with texts by songwriters such as David Byrne, Paul Simon, in which the Kronos Quartet is featured (as it is in \"Mishima\") in a prominent role. Glass also continued his series of operas with adaptations from literary texts such as \"The Juniper Tree\" (an opera collaboration with composer Robert Moran, 1984), Edgar Allan Poe's \"The Fall of the House of Usher\" (1987), and also worked with novelist Doris Lessing on the opera \"The Making of the Representative for Planet 8\" (1985\u201386, and performed by the Houston Grand Opera and English National Opera in 1988).\n1987\u20131991: Operas and the turn to symphonic music.\nCompositions such as \"Company\", \"Facades\" and String Quartet No. 3 (the last two extracted from the scores to \"Koyaanisqatsi\" and \"Mishima\") gave way to a series of works more accessible to ensembles such as the string quartet and symphony orchestra, in this returning to the structural roots of his student days. In taking this direction his chamber and orchestral works were also written in a more and more traditional and lyrical style. In these works, Glass often employs old musical forms such as the chaconne and the passacaglia\u2014for instance in \"Satyagraha\", the Violin Concerto No. 1 (1987), Symphony No. 3 (1995), \"Echorus\" (1995) and also recent works such as Symphony No. 8 (2005), and \"Songs and Poems for Solo Cello\" (2006).\nA series of orchestral works originally composed for the concert hall commenced with the three-movement Violin Concerto No. 1 (1987). This work was commissioned by the American Composers Orchestra and written for and in close collaboration with the violinist Paul Zukofsky and the conductor Dennis Russell Davies, who since then has encouraged the composer to write numerous orchestral pieces. The Concerto is dedicated to the memory of Glass's father: \"His favorite form was the violin concerto, and so I grew up listening to the Mendelssohn, the Paganini, the Brahms concertos. ... So when I decided to write a violin concerto, I wanted to write one that my father would have liked.\" Among its multiple recordings, in 1992, the Concerto was performed and recorded by Gidon Kremer and the Vienna Philharmonic. This turn to orchestral music was continued with a symphonic trilogy of \"portraits of nature\", commissioned by the Cleveland Orchestra, the Rotterdam Philharmonic Orchestra, and the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra: \"The Light\" (1987), \"The Canyon\" (1988), and \"Itaipu\" (1989).\nWhile composing for symphonic ensembles, Glass also composed music for piano, with the cycle of five movements titled \"Metamorphosis\" (adapted from music for a theatrical adaptation of Franz Kafka's \"The Metamorphosis\"), and for the Errol Morris film \"The Thin Blue Line\", 1988. In the same year Glass met the poet Allen Ginsberg by chance in a book store in the East Village of New York City, and they immediately \"decided on the spot to do something together, reached for one of Allen's books and chose \"Wichita Vortex Sutra\"\", a piece for reciter and piano which in turn developed into a music theatre piece for singers and ensemble, \"Hydrogen Jukebox\" (1990).\nGlass also returned to chamber music; he composed two String Quartets (No. 4 \"Buczak\" in 1989 and No. 5 in 1991), and chamber works which originated as incidental music for plays, such as \"Music from \"The Screens\"\" (1989/1990). This work originated in one of many theater music collaborations with the director JoAnne Akalaitis, who originally asked the Gambian musician Foday Musa Suso \"to do the score [for Jean Genet's \"The Screens\"] in collaboration with a western composer\". Glass had already collaborated with Suso in the film score to \"Powaqqatsi\" (Godfrey Reggio, 1988). \"Music from \"The Screens\"\" is on occasion a touring piece for Glass and Suso (one set of tours also included percussionist Yousif Sheronick ), and individual pieces found their way into the repertoire of Glass and the cellist Wendy Sutter. Another collaboration was a collaborative recording project with Ravi Shankar, initiated by Peter Baumann (a member of the band Tangerine Dream), which resulted in the album \"Passages\" (1990).\nIn the late 1980s and early 1990s, Glass's projects also included two highly prestigious opera commissions based on the life of explorers: \"The Voyage\" (1992), with a libretto by David Henry Hwang, was commissioned by the Metropolitan Opera for the 500th anniversary of the discovery of America by Christopher Columbus; and \"White Raven\" (1991), about Vasco da Gama, a collaboration with Robert Wilson and composed for the closure of the 1998 World Fair in Lisbon. Especially in \"The Voyage\", the composer \"explore[d] new territory\", with its \"newly arching lyricism\", \"Sibelian starkness and sweep\", and \"dark, brooding tone ... a reflection of its increasingly chromatic (and dissonant) palette\", as one commentator put it.\nGlass remixed the S'Express song \"Hey Music Lover\", for the b-side of its 1989 release as a single.\n1991\u20131996: Cocteau trilogy and symphonies.\nAfter these operas, Glass began working on a symphonic cycle, commissioned by the conductor Dennis Russell Davies, who told Glass at the time: \"I'm not going to let you ... be one of those opera composers who never write a symphony\". Glass responded with a pair of three-movement symphonies (\"Low\" [1992], and Symphony No. 2 [1994]); his first in an ongoing series of symphonies is a combination of the composer's own musical material with themes featured in prominent tracks of the David Bowie/Brian Eno album \"Low\" (1977), whereas Symphony No. 2 is described by Glass as a study in polytonality. He referred to the music of Honegger, Milhaud, and Villa-Lobos as possible models for his symphony. With the Concerto Grosso (1992), Symphony No. 3 (1995), a Concerto for Saxophone Quartet and Orchestra (1995), written for the Rascher Quartet (all commissioned by conductor Dennis Russell Davies), and \"Echorus\" (1994/95), a more transparent, refined, and intimate chamber-orchestral style paralleled the excursions of his large-scale symphonic pieces. In the four movements of his Third Symphony, Glass treats a 19-piece string orchestra as an extended chamber ensemble. In the third movement, Glass re-uses the chaconne as a formal device; one commentator characterized Glass's symphony as one of the composer's \"most tautly unified works\". The third Symphony was closely followed by a fourth, subtitled \"Heroes\" (1996), commissioned the American Composers Orchestra. Its six movements are symphonic reworkings of themes by Glass, David Bowie, and Brian Eno (from their album \"Heroes\", 1977); as in other works by the composer, it is also a hybrid work and exists in two versions: one for the concert hall, and another, shorter one for dance, choreographed by Twyla Tharp.\nAnother commission by Dennis Russell Davies was a second series for piano, the \"Etudes\" for Piano (dedicated to Davies as well as the production designer Achim Freyer); the complete first set of ten Etudes has been recorded and performed by Glass himself. Bruce Brubaker and Dennis Russell Davies have each recorded the original set of six. Most of the Etudes are composed in the post-minimalist and increasingly lyrical style of the times: \"Within the framework of a concise form, Glass explores possible sonorities ranging from typically Baroque passagework to Romantically tinged moods\". Some of the pieces also appeared in different versions such as in the theatre music to Robert Wilson's \"Persephone\" (1994, commissioned by the Relache Ensemble) or \"Echorus\" (a version of Etude No. 2 for two violins and string orchestra, written for Edna Mitchell and Yehudi Menuhin 1995).\nGlass's prolific output in the 1990s continued to include operas with an opera triptych (1991\u20131996), which the composer described as an \"homage\" to writer and film director Jean Cocteau, based on his prose and cinematic work: \"Orph\u00e9e\" (1950), \"La Belle et la B\u00eate\" (1946), and the novel \"Les Enfants terribles\" (1929, later made into a film by Cocteau and Jean-Pierre Melville, 1950). In the same way the triptych is also a musical homage to the work of the group of French composers associated with Cocteau, Les Six (and especially to Glass's teacher Darius Milhaud), as well as to various 18th-century composers such as Gluck and Bach whose music featured as an essential part of the films by Cocteau.\nThe inspiration of the first part of the trilogy, \"Orph\u00e9e\" (composed in 1991, and premiered in 1993 at the American Repertory Theatre) can be conceptually and musically traced to Gluck's opera \"Orfeo ed Euridice\" (\"Orph\u00e9e et Euridyce\", 1762/1774), which had a prominent part in Cocteau's 1949 film \"Orphee\". One theme of the opera, the death of Eurydice, has some similarity to the composer's personal life: the opera was composed after the unexpected death in 1991 of Glass's wife, artist Candy Jernigan: \"... One can only suspect that Orpheus' grief must have resembled the composer's own\", K. Robert Schwartz suggests. The opera's \"transparency of texture, a subtlety of instrumental color, ... a newly expressive and unfettered vocal writing\" was praised, and \"The Guardian's\" critic remarked \"Glass has a real affinity for the French text and sets the words eloquently, underpinning them with delicately patterned instrumental textures\".\nFor the second opera, \"La Belle et la B\u00eate\" (1994, scored for either the Philip Glass Ensemble or a more conventional chamber orchestra), Glass replaced the soundtrack (including Georges Auric's film music) of Cocteau's film, wrote \"a new fully operatic score and synchronize[d] it with the film\". This reimagining of a score took what had been common in turning opera into film and turned it on its head, turning film into opera. This brought the music that would otherwise be subordinate to the film to the forefront so that the two were equal with each other; taking a new spin on an old tradition. The final part of the triptych returned again to a more traditional setting with the \"Dance Opera\" \"Les Enfants terribles\" (1996), scored for voices, three pianos and dancers, with choreography by Susan Marshall. The characters are depicted by both singers and dancers. The scoring of the opera evokes Bach's Concerto for Four Harpsichords, but in another way also \"the snow, which falls relentlessly throughout the opera ... bearing witness to the unfolding events. Here time stands still. There is only music, and the movement of children through space\" (Glass).\n1997\u20132004: Symphonies, opera, and concertos.\nIn the late 1990s and early 2000s, Glass's lyrical and romantic styles peaked with a variety of projects: operas, theatre and film scores (Martin Scorsese's \"Kundun\", 1997, Godfrey Reggio's \"Naqoyqatsi\", 2002, and Stephen Daldry's \"The Hours\", 2002), a series of five concerts, and three symphonies centered on orchestra-singer and orchestra-chorus interplay. Two symphonies, Symphony No. 5 \"Choral\" (1999) and Symphony No. 7 \"Toltec\" (2004), and the song cycle \"Songs of Milarepa\" (1997) have a meditative theme. The operatic Symphony No. 6 \"Plutonian Ode\" (2002) for soprano and orchestra was commissioned by the Brucknerhaus, Linz, and Carnegie Hall in celebration of Glass's sixty-fifth birthday, and developed from Glass's collaboration with Allen Ginsberg (poet, piano\u2014Ginsberg, Glass), based on his poem of the same name.\nBesides writing for the concert hall, Glass continued his ongoing operatic series with adaptions from literary texts: \"The Marriages of Zones 3, 4 and 5\" ([1997] story-libretto by Doris Lessing), \"In the Penal Colony\" (2000, after the story by Franz Kafka), and the chamber opera \"The Sound of a Voice\" (2003, with David Henry Hwang), which features the Pipa, performed by Wu Man at its premiere. Glass also collaborated again with the co-author of \"Einstein on the Beach\", Robert Wilson, on \"Monsters of Grace\" (1998), and created a biographic opera on the life of astronomer Galileo Galilei (2001).\nIn the early 2000s, Glass started a series of five concerti with the \"Tirol Concerto for Piano and Orchestra\" (2000, premiered by Dennis Russell Davies as conductor and soloist), and the \"Concerto Fantasy for Two Timpanists and Orchestra\" (2000, for the timpanist Jonathan Haas). The Concerto for Cello and Orchestra (2001) had its premiere performance in Beijing, featuring cellist Julian Lloyd Webber; it was composed in celebration of his fiftieth birthday. These concertos were followed by the concise and rigorously neo-Baroque Concerto for Harpsichord and Orchestra (2002), demonstrating in its transparent, chamber orchestral textures Glass's classical technique, evocative in the \"improvisatory chords\" of its beginning a toccata of Froberger or Frescobaldi, and 18th century music. Two years later, the concerti series continued with \"Piano Concerto No. 2: After Lewis and Clark\" (2004), composed for the pianist Paul Barnes. The concerto celebrates the pioneers' trek across North America, and the second movement features a duet for piano and Native American flute. With the chamber opera \"The Sound of a Voice\", Glass's Piano Concerto No. 2 might be regarded as bridging his traditional compositions and his more popular excursions to World Music, also found in \"Orion\" (also composed in 2004).\n2005\u20132007: \"Songs and Poems\".\n\"Waiting for the Barbarians\", an opera from J. M. Coetzee's novel (with the libretto by Christopher Hampton), had its premiere performance in September 2005. Glass defined the work as a \"social/political opera\", as a critique on the Bush administration's war in Iraq, a \"dialogue about political crisis\", and an illustration of the \"power of art to turn our attention toward the human dimension of history\". While the opera's themes are Imperialism, apartheid, and torture, the composer chose an understated approach by using \"very simple means, and the orchestration is very clear and very traditional; it's almost classical in sound\", as the conductor Dennis Russell Davies notes.\nTwo months after the premiere of this opera, in November 2005, Glass's Symphony No. 8, commissioned by the Bruckner Orchestra Linz, was premiered at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in New York City. After three symphonies for voices and orchestra, this piece was a return to purely orchestral and abstract composition; like previous works written for the conductor Dennis Russell Davies (the 1992 Concerto Grosso and the 1995 Symphony No. 3), it features extended solo writing. Critic Allan Kozinn described the symphony's chromaticism as more extreme, more fluid, and its themes and textures as continually changing, morphing without repetition, and praised the symphony's \"unpredictable orchestration\", pointing out the \"beautiful flute and harp variation in the melancholy second movement\". Alex Ross, remarked that \"against all odds, this work succeeds in adding something certifiably new to the overstuffed annals of the classical symphony. ... The musical material is cut from familiar fabric, but it's striking that the composer forgoes the expected bustling conclusion and instead delves into a mood of deepening twilight and unending night.\"\n\"The Passion of Ramakrishna\" (2006), was composed for the Pacific Symphony orchestra, the Pacific Chorale and the conductor Carl St. Clair. The 45 minutes choral work is based on the writings of Indian spiritual leader Ramakrishna, which seem \"to have genuinely inspired and revived the composer out of his old formulas to write something fresh\", as one critic remarked, whereas another noted \"The musical style breaks little new ground for Glass, except for the glorious Handelian ending ... the composer's style ideally fits the devotional text\".\nA cello suite, composed for the cellist Wendy Sutter, \"Songs and Poems for Solo Cello\" (2005\u20132007), was equally lauded by critics. It was described by Lisa Hirsch as \"a major work, ... a major addition to the cello repertory\" and \"deeply Romantic in spirit, and at the same time deeply Baroque\". Another critic, Anne Midgette of \"The Washington Post\", noted the suite \"maintains an unusual degree of directness and warmth\"; she also noted a kinship to a major work by Johann Sebastian Bach: \"Digging into the lower registers of the instrument, it takes flight in handfuls of notes, now gentle, now impassioned, variously evoking the minor-mode keening of klezmer music and the interior meditations of Bach's cello suites\". Glass himself pointed out \"in many ways it owes more to Schubert than to Bach\".\nIn 2007, Glass also worked alongside Leonard Cohen on an adaptation of Cohen's poetry collection \"Book of Longing\". The work, which premiered in June 2007 in Toronto, is a piece for seven instruments and a vocal quartet, and contains recorded spoken word performances by Cohen and imagery from his collection.\n\"Appomattox\", an opera surrounding the events at the end of the American Civil War, was commissioned by the San Francisco Opera and premiered on October 5, 2007. As in \"Waiting for the Barbarians\", Glass collaborated with the writer Christopher Hampton, and as with the preceding opera and Symphony No. 8, the piece was conducted by Glass's long-time collaborator Dennis Russell Davies, who noted \"in his recent operas the bass line has taken on an increasing prominence... (an) increasing use of melodic elements in the deep register, in the contrabass, the contrabassoon\u2014he's increasingly using these sounds and these textures can be derived from using these instruments in different combinations. ... He's definitely developed more skill as an orchestrator, in his ability to conceive melodies and harmonic structures for specific instrumental groups. ... what he gives them to play is very organic and idiomatic.\"\nApart from this large-scale opera, Glass added a work to his catalogue of theater music in 2007, and continuing\u2014after a gap of twenty years\u2014to write music for the dramatic work of Samuel Beckett. He provided a \"hypnotic\" original score for a compilation of Beckett's short plays \"Act Without Words I\", \"Act Without Words II\", \"Rough for Theatre I\" and \"Eh Joe\", directed by JoAnne Akalaitis and premiered in December 2007. Glass's work for this production was described by \"The New York Times\" as \"icy, repetitive music that comes closest to piercing the heart\".\n2008\u2013present: Chamber music, concertos, and symphonies.\nBetween 2008 and 2010, Glass continued to work on a series of chamber music pieces which started with \"Songs and Poems\": the \"Four Movements for Two Pianos\" (2008, premiered by Dennis Russell Davies and Maki Namekawa in July 2008), a \"Sonata for Violin and Piano\" composed in \"the Brahms tradition\" (completed in 2008, premiered by violinist Maria Bachman and pianist Jon Klibonoff in February 2009); a \"String sextet\" (an adaption of the Symphony No. 3 of 1995 made by Glass's musical director Michael Riesman) followed in 2009. \"Pendulum\" (2010, a one-movement piece for violin and piano), a second Suite of cello pieces for Wendy Sutter (2011), and \"Partita for solo violin\" for violinist Tim Fain (2010, first performance of the complete work 2011), are recent entries in the series.\nOther works for the theater were a score for Euripides' \"The Bacchae\" (2009, directed by JoAnne Akalaitis), and \"Kepler\" (2009), yet another operatic biography of a scientist or explorer. The opera is based on the life of 17th century astronomer Johannes Kepler, against the background of the Thirty Years' War, with a libretto compiled from Kepler's texts and poems by his contemporary Andreas Gryphius. It is Glass's first opera in German, and was premiered by the Bruckner Orchestra Linz and Dennis Russell Davies in September 2009. LA Times critic Mark Swed and others described the work as \"oratorio-like\"; Swed pointed out the work is Glass's \"most chromatic, complex, psychological score\" and \"the orchestra dominates ... I was struck by the muted, glowing colors, the character of many orchestral solos and the poignant emphasis on bass instruments\".\nIn 2009 and 2010, Glass returned to the concerto genre. Violin Concerto No. 2 in four movements was commissioned by violinist Robert McDuffie, and subtitled \"The American Four Seasons\" (2009), as an homage to Vivaldi's set of concertos \"The Four Seasons\". It premiered in December 2009 by the Toronto Symphony Orchestra, and was subsequently performed by the London Philharmonic Orchestra in April 2010. The Double Concerto for Violin and Cello and Orchestra (2010) was composed for soloists Maria Bachmann and Wendy Sutter and also as a ballet score for the Nederlands Dans Theater. Other orchestral projects of 2010 are short orchestral scores for films; to a multimedia presentation based on the novel \"Icarus at the Edge of Time\" by theoretical physicist Brian Greene, which premiered on June 6, 2010, and the score for the Brazilian film \"Nosso Lar\" (released in Brazil on September 3, 2010). Glass also donated a short work, \"Brazil\", to the video game \"Chime\", which was released on February 3, 2010.\nIn August 2011, Glass presented a series of music, dance, and theater performances as part of the Days and Nights Festival. Along with the Philip Glass Ensemble, scheduled performers include Molissa Fenley and Dancers, John Moran with Saori Tsukada, as well as a screening of \"Dracula\" with Glass's score.\nOther works completed since 2010 include Symphony No. 9 (2010\u20132011), Symphony No. 10 (2012), Cello Concerto No. 2 (2012, based on the film score to \"Naqoyqatsi\") as well as String Quartet No. 6 and No. 7. Glass's Ninth Symphony was co-commissioned by the Bruckner Orchestra Linz, the American Composers Orchestra and the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra. The symphony's first performance took place on January 1, 2012, at the Brucknerhaus in Linz, Austria (Dennis Russell Davies conducting the Bruckner Orchestra Linz); the American premiere was on January 31, 2012, (Glass's 75th birthday), at Carnegie Hall (Dennis Russell Davies conducting the American Composers Orchestra), and the West Coast premiere with the Los Angeles Philharmonic under the baton of John Adams on April 5. Glass's Tenth Symphony, written in five movements, was commissioned by the Orchestre fran\u00e7ais des jeunes for its 30th anniversary. The symphony's first performance took place on August 9, 2012, at the Grand Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de Provence in Aix-en-Provence under Dennis Russell Davies.\nThe opera \"The Perfect American\" was composed in 2011 to a commission from Teatro Real Madrid. The libretto is based on a book of the same name by Peter Stephan Jungk and covers the final months of the life of Walt Disney. The world premiere was at the Teatro Real, Madrid, on January 22, 2013, with British baritone Christopher Purves taking the role of Disney. The UK premiere took place on June 1, 2013, in a production by the English National Opera at the London Coliseum. The US premiere took place on March 12, 2017, in a production by Long Beach Opera. It was met with\nmixed to negative reviews.\nHis opera \"The Lost\", based on a play by Austrian playwright and novelist Peter Handke, \"Die Spuren der Verirrten\" (2007), premiered at the Musiktheater Linz in April 2013, conducted by Dennis Russell Davies and directed by David Pountney.\nOn June 28, 2013, Glass's piano piece \"Two Movements for Four Pianos\" was premiered at the Museum Kunstpalast, performed by Katia and Marielle Lab\u00e8que, Maki Namekawa, and Dennis Russell Davies.\nOn January 17, 2014, Glass's collaboration with Ang\u00e9lique Kidjo \"If\u00e9: Three Yor\u00f9b\u00e1 Songs for Orchestra\" premiered at the Philharmonie Luxembourg.\nIn May 2015, Glass's Double Concerto for Two Pianos was premiered by Katia and Marielle Lab\u00e8que, Gustavo Dudamel and the Los Angeles Philharmonic.\nGlass published his memoir, \"Words Without Music\", in 2015. His 11th symphony, commissioned by the Bruckner Orchestra Linz, the Istanbul International Music Festival, and the Queensland Symphony Orchestra, premiered on January 31, 2017, Glass's 80th birthday, at Carnegie Hall, Dennis Russell Davies conducting the Bruckner Orchestra. On September 22, 2017, his Piano Concerto No. 3 was premiered by pianist Simone Dinnerstein with the strings of the chamber orchestra A Far Cry at Jordan Hall at the New England Conservatory of Music, Boston, Massachusetts. Glass' String Quartet No. 8 was premiered by the JACK Quartet at Centennial Concert Hall in Winnipeg, Canada on February 1, 2018. The work was commissioned by the Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra New Music Festival, the Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra, and Carnegie Hall.\nGlass's 12th symphony was premiered by the Los Angeles Philharmonic under John Adams at the Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles on January 10, 2019. Commissioned by the orchestra, the work is based on David Bowie's 1979 album \"Lodger\", it completes Glass's trilogy of symphonies based on Bowie's Berlin Trilogy of albums.\nIn collaboration with stage auteur, performer and co-director (with Kirsty Housley) Phelim McDermott, Glass composed the score for the new work \"Tao of Glass\", which premiered at the 2019 Manchester International Festival before touring to the 2020 Perth Festival.\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, Glass continued composing, with three major works for opera and symphony premiering in 2021 and 2022. Glass' opera \"Circus Days and Nights\" was commissioned by Cirkus Cirkor. The libretto by David Henry Hwang and Tilde Bj\u00f6rfors is based on a book of poems by Robert Lax. The world premiere was at the Malm\u00f6 Opera on May 29, 2021. Glass's Symphony No. 14 was premiered by the LGT Young Soloists at the Royal College of Music in London on September 17, 2021. The work was commissioned by the orchestra. Glass's Symphony No. 13 was premiered by the National Arts Centre Orchestra under Alexander Shelley at the Roy Thomson Hall in Toronto on March 30, 2022. Commissioned by the orchestra, the work was written as a tribute to Canadian journalist Peter Jennings.\nOn November 7, 2023, Glass and Artisan Books released \"Philip Glass Piano Etudes: The Complete Folios 1\u201320 &amp; Essays from Fellow Artists\" a nine-pound deluxe boxed set of Glass' piano etudes and \"Studies in Time: Essays on the Music of Philip Glass.\" \nInfluences and collaborations.\nGlass describes himself as a \"classicist\", pointing out he is trained in harmony and counterpoint and studied such composers as Franz Schubert, Johann Sebastian Bach, and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart with Nadia Boulanger. Jean Sibelius's influence can be heard in the lyrical, sweeping, and stark qualities of his music. Aside from composing in the Western classical tradition, his music has ties to rock, ambient music, electronic music, and world music. Early admirers of his minimalism include musicians Brian Eno and David Bowie. In the 1990s, Glass composed the aforementioned symphonies \"Low\" (1992) and \"Heroes\" (1996), thematically derived from the Bowie-Eno collaboration albums \"Low\" and \"Heroes\" composed in late 1970s Berlin.\nGlass has collaborated with recording artists such as Paul Simon, Suzanne Vega, Mick Jagger, Leonard Cohen, David Byrne, Uakti, Natalie Merchant, S'Express (Glass remixed their track \"Hey Music Lover\" in 1989) and Aphex Twin (yielding an orchestration of \"Icct Hedral\" in 1995 on the \"Donkey Rhubarb\" EP). Glass's compositional influence extends to musicians such as Mike Oldfield (who included parts from Glass's \"North Star\" in \"Platinum\"), and bands such as Tangerine Dream and Talking Heads. Glass and his sound designer Kurt Munkacsi produced the American post-punk/new wave band Polyrock (1978 to the mid-1980s), as well as the recording of John Moran's \"The Manson Family (An Opera)\" in 1991, which featured punk legend Iggy Pop, and a second (unreleased) recording of Moran's work featuring poet Allen Ginsberg.\nGlass counts many artists among his friends and collaborators, including visual artists (Richard Serra, Chuck Close, Fredericka Foster), writers (Doris Lessing, David Henry Hwang, Allen Ginsberg), film and theatre directors (including Errol Morris, Robert Wilson, JoAnne Akalaitis, Godfrey Reggio, Paul Schrader, Martin Scorsese, Christopher Hampton, Bernard Rose, and many others), choreographers (Lucinda Childs, Jerome Robbins, Twyla Tharp), and musicians and composers (Ravi Shankar, David Byrne, the conductor Dennis Russell Davies, Foday Musa Suso, Laurie Anderson, Linda Ronstadt, Paul Simon, Pierce Turner, Joan La Barbara, Arthur Russell, David Bowie, Brian Eno, Roberto Carnevale, Patti Smith, Aphex Twin, Lisa Bielawa, Andrew Shapiro, John Moran, Bryce Dessner and Nico Muhly). Among recent collaborators are Glass's fellow New Yorker Woody Allen and Stephen Colbert.\nGlass had begun using the Farfisa portable organ out of convenience, and he has used it in concert. It is featured on several recordings including \"North Star\" and \"Dance Nos. 1\u20135\".\nMusic for film.\nGlass has composed many film scores, starting with the orchestral score for \"Koyaanisqatsi\" (1982), and continuing with two biopics, \"\" (1985, resulting in the String Quartet No. 3) and \"Kundun\" (1997) about the Dalai Lama, for which he received his first Academy Award nomination. In 1968, he composed and conducted the score for director Harrison Engle's minimalist comedy short, \"Railroaded,\" played by the Philip Glass Ensemble. This was one of his earliest film efforts.\nThe year after scoring \"Hamburger Hill\" (1987), Glass began a long collaboration with the filmmaker Errol Morris with his music for Morris's celebrated documentaries, including \"The Thin Blue Line\" (1988) and \"A Brief History of Time\" (1991). He continued composing for the Qatsi trilogy with the scores for \"Powaqqatsi\" (1988) and \"Naqoyqatsi\" (2002). In 1995, he composed the theme for Reggio's short independent film \"Evidence\". He made a cameo appearance\u2014briefly visible performing at the piano\u2014in Peter Weir's \"The Truman Show\" (1998), which uses music from \"Powaqqatsi\", \"Anima Mundi\" and \"Mishima\", as well as three original tracks by Glass. In the 1990s, he also composed scores for \"Bent\" (1997) and the supernatural horror film \"Candyman\" (1992) and its sequel, \"\" (1995), plus a film adaptation of Joseph Conrad's \"The Secret Agent\" (1996).\nIn 1999, he finished a new soundtrack for the 1931 film \"Dracula\". \"The Hours\" (2002) earned him a second Academy Award nomination. The circular, recurring nature of Glass's music has been praised for providing stability and contrast to frequent jumps across time and geography in the film's narrative. In this way, the soundtrack has a distinctive personality, so much so that director Stephen Daldry believes Glass's music serves as \"another stream of consciousness, another character\" in the film. \"The Hours\" was followed by another Morris documentary, \"The Fog of War\" (2003). In the mid-2000s, Glass provided the scores to films such as \"Secret Window\" (2004), \"Neverwas\" (2005), \"The Illusionist\" and \"Notes on a Scandal\", garnering his third Academy Award nomination for the latter. Glass's most recent film scores include \"No Reservations\" (Glass makes a brief cameo in the film sitting at an outdoor caf\u00e9), \"Cassandra's Dream\" (2007), \"Les Regrets\" (2009), \"Mr Nice\" (2010), the Brazilian film \"Nosso Lar\" (2010) and \"Fantastic Four\" (2015, in collaboration with Marco Beltrami). In 2009, Glass composed original theme music for \"Transcendent Man\", about the life and ideas of Ray Kurzweil by filmmaker Barry Ptolemy.\nIn the 2000s, Glass's work from the 1980s again became known to wider public through various media. In 2005, his Concerto for Violin and Orchestra (1987) was featured in the French film \"The Moustache\", providing a tone intentionally incongruous to the banality of the movie's plot. \"Metamorphosis: Metamorphosis One\" from \"Solo Piano\" (1989) was featured in the reimagined \"Battlestar Galactica\" in the episode \"Valley of Darkness\" and also in the final episode (\"return 0\") of \"Person of Interest\". In 2008, Rockstar Games released \"Grand Theft Auto IV\" featuring Glass's \"Pruit Igoe\" (from \"Koyaanisqatsi\"). \"Pruit Igoe\" and \"Prophecies\" (also from \"Koyaanisqatsi\") were used both in a trailer for \"Watchmen\" and in the film itself. \"Watchmen\" also included two other Glass pieces in the score: \"Something She Has To Do\" from \"The Hours\" and \"Protest\" from \"Satyagraha\", act 2, scene 3. In 2013, Glass contributed a piano piece \"Duet\" to the Park Chan-wook film \"Stoker\" which is performed diegetically in the film. Glass contributed compositions to the feature documentary \"The General &amp; Me\" by filmmaker Tiana Alexandra-Silliphant, which was showcased at Glass's \"Days and Nights Festival\" in 2017. In 2017, Glass scored the National Geographic Films documentary \"Jane\" (a documentary on the life of renowned British primatologist Jane Goodall).\nGlass's music was featured in two award-winning films by Russian director Andrey Zvyagintsev, \"Elena\" (2011) and \"Leviathan\" (2014).\nFor television, Glass composed the theme for \"Night Stalker\" (2005) and the soundtrack for \"Tales from the Loop\" (2020). Glass's \"Confrontation and Rescue\" (from \"Satyagraha\") was used in the ending of Season 3 Chapter 6 of \"Stranger Things\" (2019), whilst \"Window of Appearances\", \"Akhnaten and Nefertiti\" (from \"Akhnaten\") and \"Prophecies\" (from \"Koyaanisqatsi\") were used in the finale of Season 4 Volume 1 (2022).\nOther business ventures.\nDunvagen Music Publishers.\nIn 1977, Glass formed a music publisher and management company named \"Dunvagen Music Publishers\". The company still represents his publishing and management interests today. \nRecord labels.\nIn 1970, Glass and Klaus Kertess (owner of the Bykert Gallery) formed a record label named \"Chatham Square Productions\" after the location of the studio of a Philip Glass Ensemble member Dick Landry. In 1993, Glass formed another record label, Point Music; in 1997, Point Music released \"Music for Airports\", a live, instrumental version of Eno's composition of the same name, by Bang on a Can All-Stars. In 2002, Glass and his producer Kurt Munkacsi and artist Don Christensen founded the Orange Mountain Music company, dedicated to \"establishing the recording legacy of Philip Glass\" and, to date, have released sixty albums of Glass's music.\nLooking Glass Studios.\nIn 1992, Glass built his own recording studio in New York City and named it Looking Glass Studios. In addition to Glass' own recording projects, the studio hosted recording projects of notable artists including Beck, Bjork, Sheryl Crow, The Cure, Grace Jones, Lou Reed, and Roger Waters before its closure in February 2009.\nPersonal life.\nGlass lives in New York City and in Cape Breton in Nova Scotia. He has described himself as \"a Jewish-Taoist-Hindu-Toltec-Buddhist\" and is a supporter of the Tibetan independence movement. In 1987, he co-founded the Tibet House US with Columbia University professor Robert Thurman and the actor Richard Gere at the request of the 14th Dalai Lama. He is also chair of the magazine \"\". Glass is a vegetarian.\nGlass has been married four times; he has four children and one granddaughter.\nHe was romantically involved with cellist Wendy Sutter for approximately five years. As of December 2018[ [update]], his partner was Japanese-born dancer Saori Tsukada.\nGlass is the first cousin once removed of Ira Glass, host of the radio show \"This American Life\". Ira interviewed Glass onstage at Chicago's Field Museum; this interview was broadcast on NPR's \"Fresh Air\". Ira interviewed Glass a second time at a fundraiser for St. Ann's Warehouse; this interview was given away to public-radio listeners as a pledge-drive thank-you gift in 2010. Ira and Glass recorded a version of the composition Glass wrote to accompany his friend Allen Ginsberg's poem \"Wichita Vortex Sutra\". In 2014, \"This American Life\" broadcast a live performance at the Brooklyn Academy of Music that included the world premier of the opera \"Help\", a short monodrama that Philip Glass wrote for the occasion.\nCritical reception.\n\"Musical Opinion\" said, \"Philip Glass must be one of the most influential living composers.\" The National Endowment for the Arts, while noting that many of his operas have been produced by the world's leading opera houses said, \"He is the first composer to win a wide, multigenerational audience in the opera house, the concert hall, the dance world, in film, and in popular music.\" \"Classical Music Review\" called his opera \"Akhnaten\" \"a musically sophisticated and imposing work\". The New York \"Metropolitan Opera\"'s production of \"Akhnaten\" won the \"Grammy Award for Best Opera Recording\" in 2022.\nJustin Davidson of \"New York\" magazine has criticized Glass, saying, \"Glass never had a good idea he didn't flog to death: He repeats the haunting scale 30 mind-numbing times, until it's long past time to go home.\" Richard Schickel of \"Time\" criticized Glass's score for \"The Hours\", saying, \"This ultimately proves insufficient to lend meaning to their lives or profundity to a grim and uninvolving film, for which Philip Glass unwittingly provides the perfect score\u2014tuneless, oppressive, droning, painfully self-important.\"\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The term covers all traits of an organism other than its genome, however transitory: the organism's morphology (physical form and structure), its developmental processes, its biochemical and physiological properties whether reversible or irreversible, and all its behavior, from a peacock's display to the phone number you half remember. An organism's phenotype results from two basic factors: the expression of an organism's unique profile of genes (its genotype) and the influence of environmental factors experienced by that same organism which influence the variable expression of said genes, and thereby shape the resulting profile of defining traits. Since the developmental process is a complex interplay of gene-environment, gene-gene interactions, there is a high degree of phenotypic variation in a given population that extends beyond mere genotypic variation. \nA well-documented example of polymorphism is Labrador Retriever coloring; while the coat color depends on many genes, it is clearly seen in the environment as yellow, black, and brown. Richard Dawkins in 1978 and again in his 1982 book \"The Extended Phenotype\" suggested that one can regard bird nests and other built structures such as caddisfly larva cases and beaver dams as \"extended phenotypes\".\nWilhelm Johannsen proposed the genotype\u2013phenotype distinction in 1911 to make clear the difference between an organism's hereditary material and 'all the typical phenomena of the organic world', the description of which, with regard 'to forms, structures, sizes, colors and other characters of the living organisms has been the chief aim of natural history'. The distinction somewhat resembles that proposed by August Weismann (1834\u20131914), who distinguished between germ plasm (heredity) and somatic cells (the body). More recently in \"The Selfish Gene\" (1976), Dawkins redescribed these concepts as replicators and vehicles.\nDefinition.\nDespite its seemingly straightforward definition, the concept of the phenotype has hidden subtleties. It may seem that anything dependent on the genotype is a phenotype, including molecules such as RNA and proteins. Most molecules and structures coded by the genetic material are not visible in the appearance of an organism, yet they are observable (for example by Western blotting) and are thus part of the phenotype; human blood groups are an example. It may seem that this goes beyond the original intentions of the concept with its focus on the (living) organism in itself. Either way, the term phenotype includes inherent traits or characteristics that are observable or traits that can be made visible by some technical procedure.\nThe term \"phenotype\" has sometimes been incorrectly used as a shorthand for the phenotypic difference between a mutant and its wild type, which would lead to the false statement that a\n\"mutation has no phenotype\".\nBehaviors and their consequences are also phenotypes, since behaviors are observable characteristics. Behavioral phenotypes include cognitive, personality, and behavioral patterns. Some behavioral phenotypes may characterize psychiatric disorders or syndromes.\nA phenome is the set of all traits expressed by a cell, tissue, organ, organism, or species. The term was first used by Davis in 1949, \"We here propose the name \"phenome\" for the sum total of extragenic, non-autoreproductive portions of the cell, whether cytoplasmic or nuclear. The phenome would be the material basis of the phenotype, just as the genome is the material basis of the genotype.\" Although phenome has been in use for many years, the distinction between the use of phenome and phenotype is problematic. A proposed definition for both terms as the \"physical totality of all traits of an organism or of one of its subsystems\" was put forth by Mahner and Kary in 1997, who argue that although scientists tend to intuitively use these and related terms in a manner that does not impede research, the terms are not well defined and usage of the terms is not consistent.\nSome usages of the term suggest that the phenome of a given organism is best understood as a kind of matrix of data representing physical manifestation of phenotype. For example, discussions led by A. Varki among those who had used the term up to 2003 suggested the following definition: \"The body of information describing an organism's phenotypes, under the influences of genetic and environmental factors\". Another team of researchers characterize \"the human phenome [as] a multidimensional search space with several neurobiological levels, spanning the proteome, cellular systems (e.g., signaling pathways), neural systems and cognitive and behavioural phenotypes.\" Plant biologists have begun to explore the phenome in the study of plant physiology. In 2009, a research team demonstrated the feasibility of identifying genotype\u2013phenotype associations using electronic health records (EHRs) linked to DNA biobanks. They called this method phenome-wide association study (PheWAS).\nInspired by the evolution from genotype to genome to pan-genome, a concept of eventually exploring the relationship among pan-phenome, pan-genome, and pan-envirome was proposed in 2023.\nPhenotypic variation.\nPhenotypic variation is a fundamental prerequisite for evolution by natural selection. Not all phenotypic variation is caused by underlying heritable genetic variation. This is because the organization of living things is 'plastic', as Darwin emphasized, or 'readily capable of change.' It is the living organism as a whole that interacts with the environment and so contributes (or not) to the next generation. Thus, natural selection affects the genetic structure of a population \"indirectly\" via the contribution of phenotypes. Without phenotypic variation, there would be no evolution by natural selection.\nThe interaction between genotype and phenotype has often been conceptualized without reference to living organisms, as in the following relationship:\ngenotype (G) + environment (E) \u2192 phenotype (P)\nBut a genotype can only be affected by or affect the environment insofar as it is embodied in a living organism. Hence, a more nuanced version of the relationship is:\ngenotype (G) + organism &amp; environment interactions (OE) \u2192 phenotype (P)\nPhenotypes often show much flexibility or phenotypic plasticity in the expression of genotypes; in many organisms the phenotypes which 'express' a given genotype are very different under varying environmental conditions. The plant \"Hieracium umbellatum\" is found growing in two different habitats in Sweden. One habitat is rocky, sea-side cliffs, where the plants develop to be bushy with broad leaves and expanded inflorescences; the other is among sand dunes where the plants develop to lie prostrate with narrow leaves and compact inflorescences. The habitats alternate along the coast of Sweden and the habitat that seeds containing the identical genotype of \"Hieracium umbellatum\" land in, determines the phenotype which develops.\nAn example of random variation in \"Drosophila\" flies is the number of ommatidia, which may vary (randomly) between left and right eyes in a single individual as much as they do between different genotypes overall, or between clones raised in different environments.\nThe concept of phenotype can be extended to variations below the level of the gene which affect an organism's fitness. For example, silent mutations that do not change the corresponding amino acid sequence of a gene may change the frequency of guanine-cytosine base pairs (GC content). The base pairs have a higher thermal stability (\"melting point\") than adenine-thymine, a property that might convey, among organisms living in high-temperature environments, a selective advantage on variants enriched in GC content.\nThe extended phenotype.\nRichard Dawkins described a phenotype that included all effects that a gene has on its surroundings, including other organisms, as an extended phenotype, arguing that \"An animal's behavior tends to maximize the survival of the genes 'for' that behavior, whether or not those genes happen to be in the body of the particular animal performing it.\" For instance, an organism such as a beaver modifies its environment by building a beaver dam; this can be considered an expression of its genes, just as its incisor teeth are\u2014which it uses to modify its environment. Similarly, when a bird feeds a brood parasite such as a cuckoo, it is unwittingly extending its phenotype; and when genes in an orchid affect orchid bee behavior to increase pollination, or when genes in a peacock affect the copulatory decisions of peahens, again, the phenotype is being extended. Genes are, in Dawkins's view, selected by their phenotypic effects.\nOther biologists broadly agree that the extended phenotype concept is relevant, but consider that its role is largely explanatory, rather than assisting in the design of experimental tests.\nGenes and phenotypes.\nPhenotypes develop through an interaction of genes and their immediate cellular environment, the cellular environment being under the influence of the host-organism's interaction with \"its\" environment. Thus there is a multiplicity of ways that genes and phenotypes interact. Most simply, for example, we might say an albino phenotype develops as a consequence of a mutation in the gene encoding tyrosinase which is a key enzyme in melanin formation. Even here, however, exposure to UV radiation can increase melanin production, hence the environment plays a role in this phenotype as well. For most complex phenotypes the precise genetic mechanism remains unknown. \nGene expression plays a crucial role in determining the phenotypes of organisms. The level of gene expression can affect the phenotype of an organism. For example, if a gene that codes for a particular enzyme is expressed at high levels, the organism may produce more of that enzyme and exhibit a particular trait as a result. On the other hand, if the gene is expressed at low levels, the organism may produce less of the enzyme and exhibit a different trait. Gene expression is regulated at various levels and thus each level can affect certain phenotypes, including transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation.\nChanges in the levels of gene expression can be influenced by a variety of factors, such as environmental conditions, genetic variations, and epigenetic modifications. These modifications can be influenced by environmental factors such as diet, stress, and exposure to toxins, and can have a significant impact on an individual's phenotype. Some phenotypes may be the result of changes in gene expression due to these factors, rather than changes in genotype. An experiment involving machine learning methods utilizing gene expressions measured from RNA sequencing found that they can contain enough signal to separate individuals in the context of phenotype prediction.\nPhenome and phenomics.\nAlthough a phenotype is the ensemble of observable characteristics displayed by an organism, the word \"phenome\" is sometimes used to refer to a collection of traits, while the simultaneous study of such a collection is referred to as \"phenomics\". Phenomics is an important field of study because it can be used to figure out which genomic variants affect phenotypes which then can be used to explain things like health, disease, and evolutionary fitness. Phenomics forms a large part of the Human Genome Project.\nPhenomics has applications in agriculture. For instance, genomic variations such as drought and heat resistance can be identified through phenomics to create more durable GMOs. Phenomics may be a stepping stone towards personalized medicine, particularly drug therapy. Once the phenomic database has acquired enough data, a person's phenomic information can be used to select specific drugs tailored to the individual.\nLarge-scale phenotyping and genetic screens.\nLarge-scale genetic screens can identify the genes or mutations that affect the phenotype of an organism. Analyzing the phenotypes of mutant genes can also aid in determining gene function. Most genetic screens have used microorganisms, in which genes can be easily deleted. For instance, nearly all genes have been deleted in \"E. coli\" and many other bacteria, but also in several eukaryotic model organisms such as baker's yeast and fission yeast. Among other discoveries, such studies have revealed lists of essential genes. \nMore recently, large-scale phenotypic screens have also been used in animals, e.g., to study lesser understood phenotypes such as behavior. In one screen, the role of mutations in mice were studied in areas including learning and memory, circadian rhythmicity, vision, responses to stress, and response to psychostimulants. \nThis experiment involves the progeny of mice treated with ENU, or N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea, which is a potent mutagen that causes point mutations. The mice were phenotypically screened for alterations in the different behavioral domains in order to find the number of putative mutants (see table for details). Putative mutants are then tested for heritability in order to help determine the inheritance pattern as well as map out the mutations. Once they have been mapped out, cloned, and identified, it can be determined whether a mutation represents a new gene or not. \nThese experiments show that mutations in the rhodopsin gene affected vision and can even cause retinal degeneration in mice. The same amino acid change causes human familial blindness, showing how phenotyping in animals can inform medical diagnostics and possibly therapy.\nEvolutionary origin of phenotype.\nThe RNA world is the hypothesized pre-cellular stage in the evolutionary history of life on earth, in which self-replicating RNA molecules proliferated prior to the evolution of DNA and proteins. The folded three-dimensional physical structure of the first RNA molecule that possessed ribozyme activity promoting replication while avoiding destruction would have been the first phenotype, and the nucleotide sequence of the first self-replicating RNA molecule would have been the original genotype.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "24544", "revid": "44120587", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24544", "title": "Photosynthesis", "text": "Biological process to convert light into chemical energy\nPhotosynthesis ( ) is a system of biological processes by which photopigment-bearing autotrophic organisms, such as most plants, algae and cyanobacteria, convert light energy \u2014 typically from sunlight \u2014 into the chemical energy necessary to fuel their metabolism. The term \"photosynthesis\" usually refers to oxygenic photosynthesis, a process that releases oxygen as a byproduct of water splitting. Photosynthetic organisms store the converted chemical energy within the bonds of intracellular organic compounds (complex compounds containing carbon), typically carbohydrates like sugars (mainly glucose, fructose and sucrose), starches, phytoglycogen and cellulose. When needing to use this stored energy, an organism's cells then metabolize the organic compounds through cellular respiration. Photosynthesis plays a critical role in producing and maintaining the oxygen content of the Earth's atmosphere, and it supplies most of the biological energy necessary for complex life on Earth.\nSome organisms also perform anoxygenic photosynthesis, which does not produce oxygen. Some bacteria (e.g. purple bacteria) uses bacteriochlorophyll to split hydrogen sulfide as a reductant instead of water, releasing sulfur instead of oxygen, which was a dominant form of photosynthesis in the euxinic Canfield oceans during the Boring Billion. Archaea such as \"Halobacterium\" also perform a type of non-carbon-fixing anoxygenic photosynthesis, where the simpler photopigment retinal and its microbial rhodopsin derivatives are used to absorb green light and produce a proton (hydron) gradient across the cell membrane, and the subsequent ion movement powers transmembrane proton pumps to directly synthesize adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the \"energy currency\" of cells. Such archaeal photosynthesis might have been the earliest form of photosynthesis that evolved on Earth, as far back as the Paleoarchean, preceding that of cyanobacteria (see Purple Earth hypothesis).\nWhile the details may differ between species, the process always begins when light energy is absorbed by the reaction centers, proteins that contain photosynthetic pigments or chromophores. In plants, these pigments are chlorophylls (a porphyrin derivative that absorbs the red and blue spectra of light, thus reflecting green) held inside chloroplasts, abundant in leaf cells. In cyanobacteria, they are embedded in the plasma membrane. In these light-dependent reactions, some energy is used to strip electrons from suitable substances, such as water, producing oxygen gas. The hydrogen freed by the splitting of water is used in the creation of two important molecules that participate in energetic processes: reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) and ATP.\nIn plants, algae, and cyanobacteria, sugars are synthesized by a subsequent sequence of light-independent reactions called the Calvin cycle. In this process, atmospheric carbon dioxide is incorporated into already existing organic compounds, such as ribulose bisphosphate (RuBP). Using the ATP and NADPH produced by the light-dependent reactions, the resulting compounds are then reduced and removed to form further carbohydrates, such as glucose. In other bacteria, different mechanisms like the reverse Krebs cycle are used to achieve the same end.\nThe first photosynthetic organisms probably evolved early in the evolutionary history of life using reducing agents such as hydrogen or hydrogen sulfide, rather than water, as sources of electrons. Cyanobacteria appeared later; the excess oxygen they produced contributed directly to the oxygenation of the Earth, which rendered the evolution of complex life possible. The average rate of energy captured by global photosynthesis is approximately 130 terawatts, which is about eight times the total power consumption of human civilization. Photosynthetic organisms also convert around 100\u2013115 billion tons (91\u2013104 Pg petagrams, or billions of metric tons), of carbon into biomass per year. Photosynthesis was discovered in 1779 by Jan Ingenhousz who showed that plants need light, not just soil and water.\nOverview.\nMost photosynthetic organisms are photoautotrophs, which means that they are able to synthesize food directly from carbon dioxide and water using energy from light. However, not all organisms use carbon dioxide as a source of carbon atoms to carry out photosynthesis; photoheterotrophs use organic compounds, rather than carbon dioxide, as a source of carbon.\nIn plants, algae, and cyanobacteria, photosynthesis releases oxygen. This oxygenic photosynthesis is by far the most common type of photosynthesis used by living organisms. Some shade-loving plants (sciophytes) produce such low levels of oxygen during photosynthesis that they use all of it themselves instead of releasing it to the atmosphere.\nAlthough there are some differences between oxygenic photosynthesis in plants, algae, and cyanobacteria, the overall process is quite similar in these organisms. There are also many varieties of anoxygenic photosynthesis, used mostly by bacteria, which consume carbon dioxide but do not release oxygen or which produce elemental sulfur instead of molecular oxygen.\nCarbon dioxide is converted into sugars in a process called carbon fixation; photosynthesis captures energy from sunlight to convert carbon dioxide into carbohydrates. Carbon fixation is an endothermic redox reaction. In general outline, photosynthesis is the opposite of cellular respiration: while photosynthesis is a process of reduction of carbon dioxide to carbohydrates, cellular respiration is the oxidation of carbohydrates or other nutrients to carbon dioxide. Nutrients used in cellular respiration include carbohydrates, amino acids and fatty acids. These nutrients are oxidized to produce carbon dioxide and water, and to release chemical energy to drive the organism's metabolism.\nPhotosynthesis and cellular respiration are distinct processes, as they take place through different sequences of chemical reactions and in different cellular compartments (cellular respiration in mitochondria).\nThe general equation for photosynthesis as first proposed by Cornelis van Niel is:\n CO2carbondioxide + 2H2Aelectron donor + photonslight energy \u2192 [CH2O]carbohydrate + 2Aoxidizedelectrondonor + H2Owater\nSince water is used as the electron donor in oxygenic photosynthesis, the equation for this process is:\n CO2carbondioxide + 2H2Owater + photonslight energy \u2192 [CH2O]carbohydrate + O2oxygen + H2Owater\nThis equation emphasizes that water is both a reactant in the light-dependent reaction and a product of the light-independent reaction, but canceling \"n\" water molecules from each side gives the net equation:\n CO2carbondioxide + H2Owater + photonslight energy \u2192 [CH2O]carbohydrate + O2oxygen\nOther processes substitute other compounds (such as arsenite) for water in the electron-supply role; for example some microbes use sunlight to oxidize arsenite to arsenate: The equation for this reaction is:\n CO2carbondioxide + (AsO)arsenite + photonslight energy \u2192 (AsO)arsenate + COcarbonmonoxide(used to build other compounds in subsequent reactions)\nPhotosynthesis occurs in two stages. In the first stage, \"light-dependent reactions\" or \"light reactions\" capture the energy of light and use it to make the hydrogen carrier NADPH and the energy-storage molecule ATP. During the second stage, the \"light-independent reactions\" use these products to capture and reduce carbon dioxide.\nMost organisms that use oxygenic photosynthesis use visible light for the light-dependent reactions, although at least three use shortwave infrared or, more specifically, far-red radiation.\nSome organisms employ even more radical variants of photosynthesis. Some archaea use a simpler method that employs a pigment similar to those used for vision in animals. The bacteriorhodopsin changes its configuration in response to sunlight, acting as a proton pump. This produces a proton gradient more directly, which is then converted to chemical energy. The process does not involve carbon dioxide fixation and does not release oxygen, and seems to have evolved separately from the more common types of photosynthesis.\nPhotosynthetic membranes and organelles.\nIn photosynthetic bacteria, the proteins that gather light for photosynthesis are embedded in cell membranes. In its simplest form, this involves the membrane surrounding the cell itself. However, the membrane may be tightly folded into cylindrical sheets called thylakoids, or bunched up into round vesicles called \"intracytoplasmic membranes\". These structures can fill most of the interior of a cell, giving the membrane a very large surface area and therefore increasing the amount of light that the bacteria can absorb.\nIn plants and algae, photosynthesis takes place in organelles called chloroplasts. A typical plant cell contains about 10 to 100 chloroplasts. The chloroplast is enclosed by a membrane. This membrane is composed of a phospholipid inner membrane, a phospholipid outer membrane, and an intermembrane space. Enclosed by the membrane is an aqueous fluid called the stroma. Embedded within the stroma are stacks of thylakoids (grana), which are the site of photosynthesis. The thylakoids appear as flattened disks. The thylakoid itself is enclosed by the thylakoid membrane, and within the enclosed volume is a lumen or thylakoid space. Embedded in the thylakoid membrane are integral and peripheral membrane protein complexes of the photosynthetic system.\nPlants absorb light primarily using the pigment chlorophyll. The green part of the light spectrum is not absorbed but is reflected, which is the reason that most plants have a green color. Besides chlorophyll, plants also use pigments such as carotenes and xanthophylls. Algae also use chlorophyll, but various other pigments are present, such as phycocyanin, carotenes, and xanthophylls in green algae, phycoerythrin in red algae (rhodophytes) and fucoxanthin in brown algae and diatoms resulting in a wide variety of colors.\nThese pigments are embedded in plants and algae in complexes called antenna proteins. In such proteins, the pigments are arranged to work together. Such a combination of proteins is also called a light-harvesting complex.\nAlthough all cells in the green parts of a plant have chloroplasts, the majority of those are found in specially adapted structures called leaves. Certain species adapted to conditions of strong sunlight and aridity, such as many \"Euphorbia\" and cactus species, have their main photosynthetic organs in their stems. The cells in the interior tissues of a leaf, called the mesophyll, can contain between 450,000 and 800,000 chloroplasts for every square millimeter of leaf. The surface of the leaf is coated with a water-resistant waxy cuticle that protects the leaf from excessive evaporation of water and decreases the absorption of ultraviolet or blue light to minimize heating. The transparent epidermis layer allows light to pass through to the palisade mesophyll cells where most of the photosynthesis takes place.\nLight-dependent reactions.\nIn the light-dependent reactions, one molecule of the pigment chlorophyll absorbs one photon and loses one electron. This electron is taken up by a modified form of chlorophyll called pheophytin, which passes the electron to a quinone molecule, starting the flow of electrons down an electron transport chain that leads to the ultimate reduction of NADP to NADPH. In addition, this creates a proton gradient (energy gradient) across the chloroplast membrane, which is used by ATP synthase in the synthesis of ATP. The chlorophyll molecule ultimately regains the electron it lost when a water molecule is split in a process called photolysis, which releases oxygen.\nThe overall equation for the light-dependent reactions under the conditions of non-cyclic electron flow in green plants is:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;2 H2O + 2 NADP+ + 3 ADP + 3 Pi + light \u2192 2 NADPH + 2 H+ + 3 ATP + O2\nNot all wavelengths of light can support photosynthesis. The photosynthetic action spectrum depends on the type of accessory pigments present. For example, in green plants, the action spectrum resembles the absorption spectrum for chlorophylls and carotenoids with absorption peaks in violet-blue and red light. In red algae, the action spectrum is blue-green light, which allows these algae to use the blue end of the spectrum to grow in the deeper waters that filter out the longer wavelengths (red light) used by above-ground green plants. The non-absorbed part of the light spectrum is what gives photosynthetic organisms their color (e.g., green plants, red algae, purple bacteria) and is the least effective for photosynthesis in the respective organisms.\nZ scheme.\nIn plants, light-dependent reactions occur in the thylakoid membranes of the chloroplasts where they drive the synthesis of ATP and NADPH. The light-dependent reactions are of two forms: cyclic and non-cyclic.\nIn the non-cyclic reaction, the photons are captured in the light-harvesting antenna complexes of photosystem II by chlorophyll and other accessory pigments (see diagram \"Z-scheme\"). The absorption of a photon by the antenna complex loosens an electron by a process called photoinduced charge separation. The antenna system is at the core of the chlorophyll molecule of the photosystem II reaction center. That loosened electron is taken up by the primary electron-acceptor molecule, pheophytin. As the electrons are shuttled through an electron transport chain (the so-called \"Z-scheme\" shown in the diagram), a chemiosmotic potential is generated by pumping proton cations (H+) across the membrane and into the thylakoid space. An ATP synthase enzyme uses that chemiosmotic potential to make ATP during photophosphorylation, whereas NADPH is a product of the terminal redox reaction in the \"Z-scheme\". The electron enters a chlorophyll molecule in Photosystem I. There it is further excited by the light absorbed by that photosystem. The electron is then passed along a chain of electron acceptors to which it transfers some of its energy. The energy delivered to the electron acceptors is used to move hydrogen ions across the thylakoid membrane into the lumen. The electron is eventually used to reduce the coenzyme NADP with an H+ to NADPH (which has functions in the light-independent reaction); at that point, the path of that electron ends.\nThe cyclic reaction is similar to that of the non-cyclic but differs in that it generates only ATP, and no reduced NADP (NADPH) is created. The cyclic reaction takes place only at photosystem I. Once the electron is displaced from the photosystem, the electron is passed down the electron acceptor molecules and returns to photosystem I, from where it was emitted, hence the name \"cyclic reaction\".\nWater photolysis.\nLinear electron transport through a photosystem will leave the reaction center of that photosystem oxidized. Elevating another electron will first require re-reduction of the reaction center. The excited electrons lost from the reaction center (P700) of photosystem I are replaced by transfer from plastocyanin, whose electrons come from electron transport through photosystem II. Photosystem II, as the first step of the \"Z-scheme\", requires an external source of electrons to reduce its oxidized chlorophyll \"a\" reaction center. The source of electrons for photosynthesis in green plants and cyanobacteria is water. Two water molecules are oxidized by the energy of four successive charge-separation reactions of photosystem II to yield a molecule of diatomic oxygen and four hydrogen ions. The electrons yielded are transferred to a redox-active tyrosine residue that is oxidized by the energy of P680+. This resets the ability of P680 to absorb another photon and release another photo-dissociated electron. The oxidation of water is catalyzed in photosystem II by a redox-active structure that contains four manganese ions and a calcium ion; this oxygen-evolving complex binds two water molecules and contains the four oxidizing equivalents that are used to drive the water-oxidizing reaction (Kok's S-state diagrams). The hydrogen ions are released in the thylakoid lumen and therefore contribute to the transmembrane chemiosmotic potential that leads to ATP synthesis. Oxygen is a waste product of light-dependent reactions, but the majority of organisms on Earth use oxygen and its energy for cellular respiration, including photosynthetic organisms.\nLight-independent reactions.\nCalvin cycle.\nIn the light-independent (or \"dark\") reactions, the enzyme RuBisCO captures CO2 from the atmosphere and, in a process called the Calvin cycle, uses the newly formed NADPH and releases three-carbon sugars, which are later combined to form sucrose and starch. The overall equation for the light-independent reactions in green plants is\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;3 CO2 + 9 ATP + 6 NADPH + 6 H+ \u2192 C3H6O3-phosphate + 9 ADP + 8 Pi + 6 NADP+ + 3 H2O\nCarbon fixation produces the three-carbon sugar intermediate, which is then converted into the final carbohydrate products. The simple carbon sugars photosynthesis produces are then used to form other organic compounds, such as the building material cellulose, the precursors for lipid and amino acid biosynthesis, or as a fuel in cellular respiration. The latter occurs not only in plants but also in animals when the carbon and energy from plants is passed through a food chain.\nThe fixation or reduction of carbon dioxide is a process in which carbon dioxide combines with a five-carbon sugar, ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate, to yield two molecules of a three-carbon compound, glycerate 3-phosphate, also known as 3-phosphoglycerate. Glycerate 3-phosphate, in the presence of ATP and NADPH produced during the light-dependent stages, is reduced to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate. This product is also referred to as 3-phosphoglyceraldehyde (PGAL) or, more generically, as triose phosphate. Most (five out of six molecules) of the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate produced are used to regenerate ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate so the process can continue. The triose phosphates not thus \"recycled\" often condense to form hexose phosphates, which ultimately yield sucrose, starch, and cellulose, as well as glucose and fructose. The sugars produced during carbon metabolism yield carbon skeletons that can be used for other metabolic reactions like the production of amino acids and lipids.\nCarbon concentrating mechanisms.\nOn land.\nIn hot and dry conditions, plants close their stomata to prevent water loss. Under these conditions, CO2 will decrease and oxygen gas, produced by the light reactions of photosynthesis, will increase, causing an increase of photorespiration by the oxygenase activity of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO) and decrease in carbon fixation. Some plants have evolved mechanisms to increase the CO2 concentration in the leaves under these conditions.\nPlants that use the C4 carbon fixation process chemically fix carbon dioxide in the cells of the mesophyll by adding it to the three-carbon molecule phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), a reaction catalyzed by an enzyme called PEP carboxylase, creating the four-carbon organic acid oxaloacetic acid. Oxaloacetic acid or malate synthesized by this process is then translocated to specialized bundle sheath cells where the enzyme RuBisCO and other Calvin cycle enzymes are located, and where CO2 released by decarboxylation of the four-carbon acids is then fixed by RuBisCO activity to the three-carbon 3-phosphoglyceric acids. The physical separation of RuBisCO from the oxygen-generating light reactions reduces photorespiration and increases CO2 fixation and, thus, the photosynthetic capacity of the leaf. C4 plants can produce more sugar than C3 plants in conditions of high light and temperature. Many important crop plants are C4 plants, including maize, sorghum, sugarcane, and millet. Plants that do not use PEP-carboxylase in carbon fixation are called C3 plants because the primary carboxylation reaction, catalyzed by RuBisCO, produces the three-carbon 3-phosphoglyceric acids directly in the Calvin-Benson cycle. Over 90% of plants use C3 carbon fixation, compared to 3% that use C4 carbon fixation; however, the evolution of C4 in over sixty plant lineages makes it a striking example of convergent evolution. C2 photosynthesis, which involves carbon-concentration by selective breakdown of photorespiratory glycine, is both an evolutionary precursor to C4 and a useful carbon-concentrating mechanism in its own right.\nXerophytes, such as cacti and most succulents, also use PEP carboxylase to capture carbon dioxide in a process called Crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM). In contrast to C4 metabolism, which \"spatially\" separates the CO2 fixation to PEP from the Calvin cycle, CAM \"temporally\" separates these two processes. CAM plants have a different leaf anatomy from C3 plants, and fix the CO2 at night, when their stomata are open. CAM plants store the CO2 mostly in the form of malic acid via carboxylation of phosphoenolpyruvate to oxaloacetate, which is then reduced to malate. Decarboxylation of malate during the day releases CO2 inside the leaves, thus allowing carbon fixation to 3-phosphoglycerate by RuBisCO. CAM is used by 16,000 species of plants.\nCalcium-oxalate-accumulating plants, such as \"Amaranthus hybridus\" and \"Colobanthus quitensis,\" show a variation of photosynthesis where calcium oxalate crystals function as dynamic carbon pools, supplying carbon dioxide (CO2) to photosynthetic cells when stomata are partially or totally closed. This process was named alarm photosynthesis. Under stress conditions (e.g., water deficit), oxalate released from calcium oxalate crystals is converted to CO2 by an oxalate oxidase enzyme, and the produced CO2 can support the Calvin cycle reactions. Reactive hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), the byproduct of oxalate oxidase reaction, can be neutralized by catalase. Alarm photosynthesis represents a photosynthetic variant to be added to the well-known C4 and CAM pathways. However, alarm photosynthesis, in contrast to these pathways, operates as a biochemical pump that collects carbon from the organ interior (or from the soil) and not from the atmosphere.\nIn water.\nCyanobacteria possess carboxysomes, which increase the concentration of CO2 around RuBisCO to increase the rate of photosynthesis. An enzyme, carbonic anhydrase, located within the carboxysome, releases CO2 from dissolved hydrocarbonate ions (HCO). Before the CO2 can diffuse out, RuBisCO concentrated within the carboxysome quickly sponges it up. HCO ions are made from CO2 outside the cell by another carbonic anhydrase and are actively pumped into the cell by a membrane protein. They cannot cross the membrane as they are charged, and within the cytosol they turn back into CO2 very slowly without the help of carbonic anhydrase. This causes the HCO ions to accumulate within the cell from where they diffuse into the carboxysomes. Pyrenoids in algae and hornworts also act to concentrate CO2 around RuBisCO.\nOrder and kinetics.\nThe overall process of photosynthesis takes place in four stages:\nEfficiency.\nPlants usually convert light into chemical energy with a photosynthetic efficiency of 3\u20136%. \nAbsorbed light that is unconverted is dissipated primarily as heat, with a small fraction (1\u20132%) reemitted as chlorophyll fluorescence at longer (redder) wavelengths. This fact allows measurement of the light reaction of photosynthesis by using chlorophyll fluorometers.\nActual plants' photosynthetic efficiency varies with the frequency of the light being converted, light intensity, temperature, and proportion of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, and can vary from 0.1% to 8%. By comparison, solar panels convert light into electric energy at an efficiency of approximately 6\u201320% for mass-produced panels, and above 40% in laboratory devices.\nScientists are studying photosynthesis in hopes of developing plants with increased yield.\nThe efficiency of both light and dark reactions can be measured, but the relationship between the two can be complex. For example, the light reaction creates ATP and NADPH energy molecules, which C3 plants can use for carbon fixation or photorespiration. Electrons may also flow to other electron sinks. For this reason, it is not uncommon for authors to differentiate between work done under non-photorespiratory conditions and under photorespiratory conditions.\nChlorophyll fluorescence of photosystem II can measure the light reaction, and infrared gas analyzers can measure the dark reaction. An integrated chlorophyll fluorometer and gas exchange system can investigate both light and dark reactions when researchers use the two separate systems together. Infrared gas analyzers and some moisture sensors are sensitive enough to measure the photosynthetic assimilation of CO2 and of \u0394H2O using reliable methods. CO2 is commonly measured in \u03bcmols/(m2/s), parts per million, or volume per million; and H2O is commonly measured in mmols/(m2/s) or in mbars. By measuring CO2 assimilation, \u0394H2O, leaf temperature, barometric pressure, leaf area, and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), it becomes possible to estimate, \"A\" or carbon assimilation, \"E\" or transpiration, \"gs\" or stomatal conductance, and \"Ci\" or intracellular CO2. However, it is more common to use chlorophyll fluorescence for plant stress measurement, where appropriate, because the most commonly used parameters FV/FM and Y(II) or F/FM' can be measured in a few seconds, allowing the investigation of larger plant populations.\nGas exchange systems that offer control of CO2 levels, above and below ambient, allow the common practice of measurement of A/Ci curves, at different CO2 levels, to characterize a plant's photosynthetic response.\nIntegrated chlorophyll fluorometer \u2013 gas exchange systems allow a more precise measure of photosynthetic response and mechanisms. While standard gas exchange photosynthesis systems can measure Ci, or substomatal CO2 levels, the addition of integrated chlorophyll fluorescence measurements allows a more precise measurement of CC, the estimation of CO2 concentration at the site of carboxylation in the chloroplast, to replace Ci. CO2 concentration in the chloroplast becomes possible to estimate with the measurement of mesophyll conductance or gm using an integrated system.\nPhotosynthesis measurement systems are not designed to directly measure the amount of light the leaf absorbs, but analysis of chlorophyll fluorescence, P700- and P515-absorbance, and gas exchange measurements reveal detailed information about, e.g., the photosystems, quantum efficiency and the CO2 assimilation rates. With some instruments, even wavelength dependency of the photosynthetic efficiency can be analyzed.\nA phenomenon known as quantum walk increases the efficiency of the energy transport of light significantly. In the photosynthetic cell of an alga, bacterium, or plant, there are light-sensitive molecules called chromophores arranged in an antenna-shaped structure called a photocomplex. When a photon is absorbed by a chromophore, it is converted into a quasiparticle referred to as an exciton, which jumps from chromophore to chromophore towards the reaction center of the photocomplex, a collection of molecules that traps its energy in a chemical form accessible to the cell's metabolism. The exciton's wave properties enable it to cover a wider area and try out several possible paths simultaneously, allowing it to instantaneously \"choose\" the most efficient route, where it will have the highest probability of arriving at its destination in the minimum possible time.\nBecause that quantum walking takes place at temperatures far higher than quantum phenomena usually occur, it is only possible over very short distances. Obstacles in the form of destructive interference cause the particle to lose its wave properties for an instant before it regains them once again after it is freed from its locked position through a classic \"hop\". The movement of the electron towards the photo center is therefore covered in a series of conventional hops and quantum walks.\nEvolution.\nFossils of what are thought to be filamentous photosynthetic organisms have been dated at 3.4 billion years old. More recent studies also suggest that photosynthesis may have begun about 3.4 billion years ago, though the first direct evidence of photosynthesis comes from thylakoid membranes preserved in 1.75-billion-year-old cherts.\nOxygenic photosynthesis is the main source of oxygen in the Earth's atmosphere, and its earliest appearance is sometimes referred to as the oxygen catastrophe. Geological evidence suggests that oxygenic photosynthesis, such as that in cyanobacteria, became important during the Paleoproterozoic era around two billion years ago. Modern photosynthesis in plants and most photosynthetic prokaryotes is oxygenic, using water as an electron donor, which is oxidized to molecular oxygen in the photosynthetic reaction center.\nSymbiosis and the origin of chloroplasts.\nSeveral groups of animals have formed symbiotic relationships with photosynthetic algae. These are most common in corals, sponges, and sea anemones. Scientists presume that this is due to the particularly simple body plans and large surface areas of these animals compared to their volumes. In addition, a few marine mollusks, such as \"Elysia viridis\" and \"Elysia chlorotica,\" also maintain a symbiotic relationship with chloroplasts they capture from the algae in their diet and then store in their bodies (see Kleptoplasty). This allows the mollusks to survive solely by photosynthesis for several months at a time. Some of the genes from the plant cell nucleus have even been transferred to the slugs, so that the chloroplasts can be supplied with proteins they need to survive.\nAn even closer form of symbiosis may explain the origin of chloroplasts. Chloroplasts have many similarities with photosynthetic bacteria, including a circular chromosome, prokaryotic-type ribosome, and similar proteins in the photosynthetic reaction center. The endosymbiotic theory suggests that photosynthetic bacteria were acquired (by endocytosis) by early eukaryotic cells to form the first plant cells. Therefore, chloroplasts may be photosynthetic bacteria that adapted to life inside plant cells. Like mitochondria, chloroplasts possess their own DNA, separate from the nuclear DNA of their plant host cells and the genes in this chloroplast DNA resemble those found in cyanobacteria. DNA in chloroplasts codes for redox proteins such as those found in the photosynthetic reaction centers. The CoRR Hypothesis proposes that this co-location of genes with their gene products is required for redox regulation of gene expression, and accounts for the persistence of DNA in bioenergetic organelles.\nPhotosynthetic eukaryotic lineages.\nSymbiotic and kleptoplastic organisms excluded:\nExcept for the euglenids, which are found within the Excavata, all of these belong to the Diaphoretickes. Archaeplastida and the photosynthetic Paulinella got their plastids, which are surrounded by two membranes, through primary endosymbiosis in two separate events, by engulfing a cyanobacterium. The plastids in all the other groups have either a red or green algal origin, and are referred to as the \"red lineages\" and the \"green lineages\". The only known exception is the ciliate Pseudoblepharisma tenue, which in addition to its plastids that originated from green algae also has a purple sulfur bacterium as symbiont. In dinoflagellates and euglenids the plastids are surrounded by three membranes, and in the remaining lines by four. A nucleomorph, remnants of the original algal nucleus located between the inner and outer membranes of the plastid, is present in the cryptophytes (from a red alga) and chlorarachniophytes (from a green alga).\nSome dinoflagellates that lost their photosynthetic ability later regained it again through new endosymbiotic events with different algae.\nWhile able to perform photosynthesis, many of these eukaryotic groups are mixotrophs and practice heterotrophy to various degrees.\nPhotosynthetic prokaryotic lineages.\nEarly photosynthetic systems, such as those in green and purple sulfur and green and purple nonsulfur bacteria, are thought to have been anoxygenic, and used various other molecules than water as electron donors. Green and purple sulfur bacteria are thought to have used hydrogen and sulfur as electron donors. Green nonsulfur bacteria used various amino and other organic acids as electron donors. Purple nonsulfur bacteria used a variety of nonspecific organic molecules. The use of these molecules is consistent with the geological evidence that Earth's early atmosphere was highly reducing at that time.\nWith a possible exception of Heimdallarchaeota, photosynthesis is not found in archaea. Haloarchaea are photoheterotrophic; they can absorb energy from the sun, but do not harvest carbon from the atmosphere and are therefore not photosynthetic. Instead of chlorophyll they use rhodopsins, which convert light-energy to ion gradients but cannot mediate electron transfer reactions.\nIn bacteria eight photosynthetic lineages are currently known:\nCyanobacteria and the evolution of photosynthesis.\nThe biochemical capacity to use water as the source for electrons in photosynthesis evolved once, in a common ancestor of extant cyanobacteria (formerly called blue-green algae). The geological record indicates that this transforming event took place early in Earth's history, at least 2450\u20132320 million years ago (Ma), and, it is speculated, much earlier. Because the Earth's atmosphere contained almost no oxygen during the estimated development of photosynthesis, it is believed that the first photosynthetic cyanobacteria did not generate oxygen. Available evidence from geobiological studies of Archean (&gt;2500 Ma) sedimentary rocks indicates that life existed 3500 Ma, but the question of when oxygenic photosynthesis evolved is still unanswered. A clear paleontological window on cyanobacterial evolution opened about 2000 Ma, revealing an already-diverse biota of cyanobacteria. Cyanobacteria remained the principal primary producers of oxygen throughout the Proterozoic Eon (2500\u2013543 Ma), in part because the redox structure of the oceans favored photoautotrophs capable of nitrogen fixation. Green algae joined cyanobacteria as the major primary producers of oxygen on continental shelves near the end of the Proterozoic, but only with the Mesozoic (251\u201366 Ma) radiations of dinoflagellates, coccolithophorids, and diatoms did the primary production of oxygen in marine shelf waters take modern form. Cyanobacteria remain critical to marine ecosystems as primary producers of oxygen in oceanic gyres, as agents of biological nitrogen fixation, and, in modified form, as the plastids of marine algae.\nExperimental history.\nDiscovery.\nAlthough some of the steps in photosynthesis are still not completely understood, the overall photosynthetic equation has been known since the 19th century.\nJan van Helmont began the research of the process in the mid-17th century when he carefully measured the mass of the soil a plant was using and the mass of the plant as it grew. After noticing that the soil mass changed very little, he hypothesized that the mass of the growing plant must come from the water, the only substance he added to the potted plant. His hypothesis was partially accurate \u2013 much of the gained mass comes from carbon dioxide as well as water. However, this was a signaling point to the idea that the bulk of a plant's biomass comes from the inputs of photosynthesis, not the soil itself.\nJoseph Priestley, a chemist and minister, discovered that when he isolated a volume of air under an inverted jar and burned a candle in it (which gave off CO2), the candle would burn out very quickly, much before it ran out of wax. He further discovered that a mouse could similarly \"injure\" air. He then showed that a plant could restore the air the candle and the mouse had \"injured\".\nIn 1779, Jan Ingenhousz repeated Priestley's experiments. He discovered that it was the influence of sunlight on the plant that could cause it to revive a mouse in a matter of hours.\nIn 1796, Jean Senebier, a Swiss pastor, botanist, and naturalist, demonstrated that green plants consume carbon dioxide and release oxygen under the influence of light. Soon afterward, Nicolas-Th\u00e9odore de Saussure showed that the increase in mass of the plant as it grows could not be due only to uptake of CO2 but also to the incorporation of water. Thus, the basic reaction by which organisms use photosynthesis to produce food (such as glucose) was outlined.\nRefinements.\nCornelis Van Niel made key discoveries explaining the chemistry of photosynthesis. By studying purple sulfur bacteria and green bacteria, he was the first to demonstrate that photosynthesis is a light-dependent redox reaction in which hydrogen reduces (donates its atoms as electrons and protons to) carbon dioxide.\nRobert Emerson discovered two light reactions by testing plant productivity using different wavelengths of light. With the red alone, the light reactions were suppressed. When blue and red were combined, the output was much more substantial. Thus, there were two photosystems, one absorbing up to 600\u00a0nm wavelengths, the other up to 700\u00a0nm. The former is known as PSII, the latter is PSI. PSI contains only chlorophyll \"a\", PSII contains primarily chlorophyll \"a\" with most of the available chlorophyll \"b\", among other pigments. These include phycobilins, which are the red and blue pigments of red and blue algae, respectively, and fucoxanthol for brown algae and diatoms. The process is most productive when the absorption of quanta is equal in both PSII and PSI, assuring that input energy from the antenna complex is divided between the PSI and PSII systems, which in turn powers the photochemistry.\nRobert Hill thought that a complex of reactions consisted of an intermediate to cytochrome b6 (now a plastoquinone), and that another was from cytochrome f to a step in the carbohydrate-generating mechanisms. These are linked by plastoquinone, which does require energy to reduce cytochrome f. Further experiments to prove that the oxygen developed during the photosynthesis of green plants came from water were performed by Hill in 1937 and 1939. He showed that isolated chloroplasts give off oxygen in the presence of unnatural reducing agents like iron oxalate, ferricyanide or benzoquinone after exposure to light. In the Hill reaction:\n2 H2O + 2 A + (light, chloroplasts) \u2192 2 AH2 + O2\nA is the electron acceptor. Therefore, in light, the electron acceptor is reduced and oxygen is evolved. Samuel Ruben and Martin Kamen used radioactive isotopes to determine that the oxygen liberated in photosynthesis came from the water.\nMelvin Calvin and Andrew Benson, along with James Bassham, elucidated the path of carbon assimilation (the photosynthetic carbon reduction cycle) in plants. The carbon reduction cycle is known as the Calvin cycle, but many scientists refer to it as the Calvin-Benson, Benson-Calvin, or even Calvin-Benson-Bassham (or CBB) Cycle.\nNobel Prize\u2013winning scientist Rudolph A. Marcus was later able to discover the function and significance of the electron transport chain.\nOtto Heinrich Warburg and Dean Burk discovered the I-quantum photosynthesis reaction that splits CO2, activated by the respiration.\nIn 1950, first experimental evidence for the existence of photophosphorylation \"in vivo\" was presented by Otto Kandler using intact \"Chlorella\" cells and interpreting his findings as light-dependent ATP formation.\nIn 1954, Daniel I. Arnon et al. discovered photophosphorylation \"in vitro\" in isolated chloroplasts with the help of P32.\nLouis N. M. Duysens and Jan Amesz discovered that chlorophyll \"a\" will absorb one light, oxidize cytochrome f, while chlorophyll \"a\" (and other pigments) will absorb another light but will reduce this same oxidized cytochrome, stating the two light reactions are in series.\nDevelopment of the concept.\nIn 1893, the American botanist Charles Reid Barnes proposed two terms, \"photosyntax\" and \"photosynthesis\", for the biological process of \"synthesis of complex carbon compounds out of carbonic acid, in the presence of chlorophyll, under the influence of light\". The term \"photosynthesis\" is derived from the Greek \"ph\u014ds\" (\u03c6\u1ff6\u03c2, gleam) and \"s\u00fdnthesis\" (\u03c3\u03cd\u03bd\u03b8\u03b5\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2, arranging together), while another word that he designated was \"photosyntax\", from \"s\u00fdntaxis\" (\u03c3\u03cd\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03be\u03b9\u03c2, configuration). Over time, the term \"photosynthesis\" came into common usage. Later discovery of anoxygenic photosynthetic bacteria and photophosphorylation necessitated redefinition of the term.\nC3 : C4 photosynthesis research.\nIn the late 1940s at the University of California, Berkeley, the details of photosynthetic carbon metabolism were sorted out by the chemists Melvin Calvin, Andrew Benson, James Bassham and a score of students and researchers utilizing the carbon-14 isotope and paper chromatography techniques. The pathway of CO2 fixation by the algae \"Chlorella\" in a fraction of a second in light resulted in a three carbon molecule called phosphoglyceric acid (PGA). For that original and ground-breaking work, a Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to Melvin Calvin in 1961. In parallel, plant physiologists studied leaf gas exchanges using the new method of infrared gas analysis and a leaf chamber where the net photosynthetic rates ranged from 10 to 13 \u03bcmol CO2\u00b7m\u22122\u00b7s\u22121, with the conclusion that all terrestrial plants have the same photosynthetic capacities, that are light saturated at less than 50% of sunlight.\nLater in 1958\u20131963 at Cornell University, field grown maize was reported to have much greater leaf photosynthetic rates of 40 \u03bcmol CO2\u00b7m\u22122\u00b7s\u22121 and not be saturated at near full sunlight. This higher rate in maize was almost double of those observed in other species such as wheat and soybean, indicating that large differences in photosynthesis exist among higher plants. At the University of Arizona, detailed gas exchange research on more than 15 species of monocots and dicots uncovered for the first time that differences in leaf anatomy are crucial factors in differentiating photosynthetic capacities among species. In tropical grasses, including maize, sorghum, sugarcane, Bermuda grass and in the dicot amaranthus, leaf photosynthetic rates were around 38\u221240 \u03bcmol CO2\u00b7m\u22122\u00b7s\u22121, and the leaves have two types of green cells, i.e. outer layer of mesophyll cells surrounding a tightly packed cholorophyllous vascular bundle sheath cells. This type of anatomy was termed Kranz anatomy in the 19th century by the botanist Gottlieb Haberlandt while studying leaf anatomy of sugarcane. Plant species with the greatest photosynthetic rates and Kranz anatomy showed no apparent photorespiration, very low CO2 compensation point, high optimum temperature, high stomatal resistances and lower mesophyll resistances for gas diffusion and rates never saturated at full sun light. The research at Arizona was designated a Citation Classic in 1986. These species were later termed C4 plants as the first stable compound of CO2 fixation in light has four carbons as malate and aspartate. Other species that lack Kranz anatomy were termed C3 type such as cotton and sunflower, as the first stable carbon compound is the three-carbon PGA. At 1000 ppm CO2 in measuring air, both the C3 and C4 plants had similar leaf photosynthetic rates around 60 \u03bcmol CO2\u00b7m\u22122\u00b7s\u22121 indicating the suppression of photorespiration in C3 plants.\nFactors.\nThere are four main factors influencing photosynthesis and several corollary factors. The four main are:\nTotal photosynthesis is limited by a range of environmental factors. These include the amount of light available, the amount of leaf area a plant has to capture light (shading by other plants is a major limitation of photosynthesis), the rate at which carbon dioxide can be supplied to the chloroplasts to support photosynthesis, the availability of water, and the availability of suitable temperatures for carrying out photosynthesis.\nLight intensity (irradiance), wavelength and temperature.\nThe process of photosynthesis provides the main input of free energy into the biosphere, and is one of four main ways in which radiation is important for plant life.\nThe radiation climate within plant communities is extremely variable, in both time and space.\nIn the early 20th century, Frederick Blackman and Gabrielle Matthaei investigated the effects of light intensity (irradiance) and temperature on the rate of carbon assimilation.\nThese two experiments illustrate several important points: First, it is known that, in general, photochemical reactions are not affected by temperature. However, these experiments clearly show that temperature affects the rate of carbon assimilation, so there must be two sets of reactions in the full process of carbon assimilation. These are the light-dependent 'photochemical' temperature-independent stage, and the light-independent, temperature-dependent stage. Second, Blackman's experiments illustrate the concept of limiting factors. Another limiting factor is the wavelength of light. Cyanobacteria, which reside several meters underwater, cannot receive the correct wavelengths required to cause photoinduced charge separation in conventional photosynthetic pigments. To combat this problem, Cyanobacteria have a light-harvesting complex called Phycobilisome. This complex is made up of a series of proteins with different pigments which surround the reaction center.\nCarbon dioxide levels and photorespiration.\nAs carbon dioxide concentrations rise, the rate at which sugars are made by the light-independent reactions increases until limited by other factors. RuBisCO, the enzyme that captures carbon dioxide in the light-independent reactions, has a binding affinity for both carbon dioxide and oxygen. When the concentration of carbon dioxide is high, RuBisCO will fix carbon dioxide. However, if the carbon dioxide concentration is low, RuBisCO will bind oxygen instead of carbon dioxide. This process, called photorespiration, uses energy, but does not produce sugars.\nRuBisCO oxygenase activity is disadvantageous to plants for several reasons:\nA highly simplified summary is:\n2 glycolate + ATP \u2192 3-phosphoglycerate + carbon dioxide + ADP + NH3\nThe salvaging pathway for the products of RuBisCO oxygenase activity is more commonly known as photorespiration, since it is characterized by light-dependent oxygen consumption and the release of carbon dioxide.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\nBooks.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nPapers.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It has been said that, as a celebrator of beauty and especially feminine sensuality, \"Renoir is the final representative of a tradition which runs directly from Rubens to Watteau.\"\nHe was the father of the actor Pierre Renoir (1885\u20131952), the filmmaker Jean Renoir (1894\u20131979) and the ceramic artist Claude Renoir (1901\u20131969). He was the grandfather of the filmmaker Claude Renoir (1913\u20131993), son of Pierre.\nLife.\nYouth.\nPierre-Auguste Renoir was born in Limoges, Haute-Vienne, France, in 1841. His father, L\u00e9onard Renoir, was a tailor of modest means, so, in 1844, Renoir's family moved to Paris in search of more favorable prospects. The location of their home, in rue d'Argenteuil in central Paris, placed Renoir in proximity to the Louvre. Although the young Renoir had a natural proclivity for drawing, he exhibited a greater talent for singing. His talent was encouraged by his teacher, Charles Gounod, who was the choirmaster at the Church of St Roch at the time. However, due to the family's financial circumstances, Renoir had to discontinue his music lessons and leave school at the age of thirteen to pursue an apprenticeship at a porcelain factory.\nAlthough Renoir displayed a talent for his work, he frequently tired of the subject matter and sought refuge in the galleries of the Louvre. The owner of the factory recognized his apprentice's talent and communicated this to Renoir's family. Following this, Renoir started taking lessons to prepare for entry into Ecole des Beaux Arts. When the porcelain factory adopted mechanical reproduction processes in 1858, Renoir was forced to find other means to support his learning. Before he enrolled in art school, he also painted hangings for overseas missionaries and decorations on fans.\nIn 1862, he began studying art under Charles Gleyre in Paris. There he met Alfred Sisley, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bazille, and Claude Monet. At times, during the 1860s, he did not have enough money to buy paint. Renoir had his first success at the Salon of 1868 with his painting \"Lise with a Parasol\" (1867), which depicted Lise Tr\u00e9hot, his lover at the time. Although Renoir first started exhibiting paintings at the Paris Salon of 1864, recognition was slow in coming, partly as a result of the turmoil of the Franco-Prussian War.\nDuring the Paris Commune in 1871, while Renoir painted on the banks of the Seine River, some Communards thought he was a spy and were about to throw him into the river, when a leader of the \"Commune\", Raoul Rigault, recognized Renoir as the man who had protected him on an earlier occasion. In 1874, a ten-year friendship with Jules Le C\u0153ur and his family ended, and Renoir lost not only the valuable support gained by the association but also a generous welcome to stay on their property near Fontainebleau and its scenic forest. This loss of a favorite painting location resulted in a distinct change of subjects.\nAdulthood.\nRenoir was inspired by the style and subject matter of the previous modern painters Camille Pissarro and \u00c9douard Manet. After a series of rejections by the Salon juries, he joined forces with Monet, Sisley, Pissarro, and several other artists to mount the First Impressionist Exhibition in April 1874, in which Renoir displayed six paintings. Although the critical response to the exhibition was largely unfavorable, Renoir's work was comparatively well received. That same year, two of his works were shown with Paul Durand-Ruel in London.\nHoping to secure a livelihood by attracting portrait commissions, Renoir displayed mostly portraits at the second Impressionist exhibition in 1876. He contributed a more diverse range of paintings the next year when the group presented its third exhibition; they included \"Dance at Le Moulin de la Galette\" and \"The Swing\". Renoir did not exhibit in the fourth or fifth Impressionist exhibitions, and instead resumed submitting his works to the Salon. By the end of the 1870s, particularly after the success of his painting \"Mme Charpentier and her Children\" (1878) at the Salon of 1879, Renoir was a successful and fashionable painter. It was also in 1879 that he met the man who was soon to become his main patron, Paul B\u00e9rard, who regularly invited him to paint and enjoy the Normandy seaside at the Ch\u00e2teau de Wargemont.\nIn 1881, he traveled to Algeria, a country he associated with Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix, then to Madrid, to see the work of Diego Vel\u00e1zquez. Following that, he traveled to Italy to see Titian's masterpieces in Florence and the paintings of Raphael in Rome. On 15 January 1882, Renoir met the composer Richard Wagner at his home in Palermo, Sicily. Renoir painted Wagner's portrait in just thirty-five minutes. In the same year, after contracting pneumonia which permanently damaged his respiratory system, Renoir convalesced for six weeks in Algeria.\nIn 1883, Renoir spent the summer in Guernsey, one of the islands in the English Channel with a varied landscape of beaches, cliffs, and bays, where he created fifteen paintings in little over a month. Most of these feature \"Moulin Huet\", a bay in Saint Martin's, Guernsey. These paintings were the subject of a set of commemorative postage stamps issued by the Bailiwick of Guernsey in 1983. While living and working in Montmartre, Renoir employed Suzanne Valadon as a model, who posed for him (\"The Large Bathers\", 1884\u20131887; \"Dance at Bougival\", 1883) and many of his fellow painters; during that time, she studied their techniques and eventually became one of the leading painters of the day. In 1887, the year when Queen Victoria celebrated her Golden Jubilee, and upon the request of the queen's associate, Phillip Richbourg, Renoir donated several paintings to the \"French Impressionist Paintings\" catalog as a token of his loyalty.\nIn 1890, he married Aline Victorine Charigot, a dressmaker twenty years his junior, who, along with a number of the artist's friends, had already served as a model for \"Le D\u00e9jeuner des canotiers\" (\"Luncheon of the Boating Party\"; she is the woman on the left playing with the dog) in 1881, and with whom he had already had a child, Pierre, in 1885. After marrying, Renoir painted many scenes of his wife and daily family life including their children and their nurse, Aline's cousin Gabrielle Renard. The Renoirs had three sons: Pierre Renoir (1885\u20131952), who became a stage and film actor; Jean Renoir (1894\u20131979), who became a filmmaker of note; and Claude Renoir (1901\u20131969), who became a ceramic artist.\nLater years.\nAround 1892, Renoir developed rheumatoid arthritis. In 1907, he moved to the warmer climate of \"Les Collettes\", a farm at the village of Cagnes-sur-Mer, Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te d'Azur, close to the Mediterranean coast. Renoir painted during the last twenty years of his life even after his arthritis severely limited his mobility. He developed progressive deformities in his hands and ankylosis of his right shoulder, requiring him to change his painting technique. It has often been reported that in the advanced stages of his arthritis, he painted by having a brush strapped to his paralyzed fingers, but this is erroneous; Renoir remained able to grasp a brush, although he required an assistant to place it in his hand. The wrapping of his hands with bandages, apparent in late photographs of the artist, served to prevent skin irritation.\nIn 1919, Renoir visited the Louvre to see his paintings hanging with those of the old masters. During this period, he created sculptures by cooperating with a young artist, Richard Guino, who worked the clay. Due to his limited joint mobility, Renoir also used a moving canvas, or picture roll, to facilitate painting large works.\nRenoir's portrait of the Austrian actress Tilla Durieux (1914) contains playful flecks of vibrant color on her shawl that offset the classical pose of the actress and highlight Renoir's skill just five years before his death.\nRenoir died in Cagnes-sur-Mer on 3 December 1919 at the age of 78.\nFamily legacy.\nRenoir's great-grandson, Alexandre Renoir, has also become a professional artist. In 2018, the Monthaven Arts and Cultural Center in Hendersonville, Tennessee, United States, hosted \"Beauty Remains\", an exhibition of his works. The exhibition title comes from a famous quotation by Renoir who, when asked why he continued to paint with his painful arthritis in his advanced years, replied \"The pain passes, but the beauty remains.\"\nArtworks.\nRenoir's paintings are notable for their vibrant light and saturated color, most often focusing on people in intimate and candid compositions. The female nude was one of his primary subjects. However, in 1876, a reviewer in Le Figaro wrote \"Try to explain to Monsieur Renoir that a woman's torso is not a mass of decomposing flesh with those purplish green stains that denote a state of complete putrefaction in a corpse.\" Yet in characteristic Impressionist style, Renoir suggested the details of a scene through freely brushed touches of colour, so that his figures softly fuse with one another and their surroundings.\nHis initial paintings show the influence of the colorism of Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix and the luminosity of Camille Corot. He also admired the realism of Gustave Courbet and \u00c9douard Manet, and his early work resembles theirs in his use of black as a color. Renoir admired Edgar Degas' sense of movement. Other painters Renoir greatly admired were the 18th-century masters Fran\u00e7ois Boucher and Jean-Honor\u00e9 Fragonard.\nA fine example of Renoir's early work and evidence of the influence of Courbet's realism, is \"Diana\", 1867. Ostensibly a mythological subject, the painting is a naturalistic studio work; the figure carefully observed, solidly modeled and superimposed upon a contrived landscape. If the work is a \"student\" piece, Renoir's heightened personal response to female sensuality is present. The model was Lise Tr\u00e9hot, the artist's mistress at that time, and inspiration for a number of paintings.\nIn the late 1860s, through the practice of painting light and water \"en plein air\" (outdoors), he and his friend Claude Monet discovered that the color of shadows is not brown or black, but the reflected color of the objects surrounding them, an effect known today as diffuse reflection. Several pairs of paintings exist in which Renoir and Monet worked side-by-side, depicting the same scenes (\"La Grenouill\u00e8re\", 1869).\nOne of the best-known Impressionist works is Renoir's 1876 \"Dance at Le Moulin de la Galette (Bal du moulin de la Galette)\". The painting depicts an open-air scene, crowded with people at a popular dance garden on the \"Butte Montmartre\" close to where he lived. The works of his early maturity were typically Impressionist snapshots of real life, full of sparkling color and light.\nBy the mid-1880s, however, he had broken with the movement to apply a more disciplined formal technique to portraits and figure paintings, particularly of women. It was a trip to Italy in 1881 when he saw works by Raphael, Leonardo da Vinci, Titian, and other Renaissance masters, that convinced him that he was on the wrong path. At that point he declared, \"I had gone as far as I could with Impressionism and I realized I could neither paint nor draw\".\nFor the next several years he painted in a more severe style in an attempt to return to classicism. Concentrating on his drawing and emphasizing the outlines of figures, he painted works such as \"Blonde Bather\" (1881 and 1882) and \"The Large Bathers\" (1884\u20131887; Philadelphia Museum of Art) during what is sometimes referred to as his \"Ingres period\".\nAfter 1890 he changed direction again. To dissolve outlines, as in his earlier work, he returned to thinly brushed color.\nFrom this period onward he concentrated on monumental nudes and domestic scenes, fine examples of which are \"Girls at the Piano\", 1892, and \"Grandes Baigneuses\", 1887. The latter painting is the most typical and successful of Renoir's late, abundantly fleshed nudes.\nA prolific artist, he created several thousand paintings. The warm sensuality of Renoir's style made his paintings some of the most well-known and frequently reproduced works in the history of art. The single largest collection of his works\u2014181 paintings in all\u2014is at the Barnes Foundation, in Philadelphia, United States.\nCatalogue raisonn\u00e9.\nA five-volume \"catalogue raisonn\u00e9\" of Renoir's works (with one supplement) was published by Bernheim-Jeune between 1983 and 2014. Bernheim-Jeune is the only surviving major art dealer that was used by Renoir. The Wildenstein Institute is preparing, but has not yet published, a critical catalogue of Renoir's work. A disagreement between these two organizations concerning an unsigned work in Picton Castle was at the centre of the second episode of the fourth season of the television series \"Fake or Fortune\".\nPosthumous prints.\nIn 1919, Ambroise Vollard, a renowned art dealer, published a book on the life and work of Renoir, \"La Vie et l'\u0152uvre de Pierre-Auguste Renoir\", in an edition of 1000 copies. In 1986, Vollard's heirs started reprinting the copper plates, generally, etchings with hand applied watercolor. These prints are signed by Renoir in the plate and are embossed \"Vollard\" in the lower margin. They are not numbered, dated or signed in pencil.\nPosthumous sales.\nA small version of \"Bal du moulin de la Galette\" sold for $78.1\u00a0million 17 May 1990 at Sotheby's New York.\nIn 2012, Renoir's \"Paysage Bords de Seine\" was offered for sale at auction but the painting was discovered to have been stolen from the Baltimore Museum of Art in 1951. The sale was cancelled.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\nOn 7 December 2019 the https:// presented a http:// at Triffo Theater in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, under the direction of pianist and conductor https://, for the 100th anniversary of the death of Renoir."}

The sense of \"counting heads\" is found in phrases like polling place and opinion poll.\nHead taxes were important sources of revenue for many governments from ancient times until the 19th century. In England, poll taxes were levied by the government of John of Gaunt in the 14th century and Charles II in the 17th century. In the United Kingdom a poll tax was levied by the government of Margaret Thatcher in the 20th century. In the United States, voting poll taxes (whose payment was a precondition to voting in an election) have been used to disenfranchise impoverished and minority voters (especially after Reconstruction).\nPoll taxes are regressive, meaning the higher someone's income is, the lower the tax is as a proportion of income: for example, a $100 tax on an income of $10,000 is a 1% tax rate, while $100 tax on a $500 income is 20%. Its acceptance or \"neutrality\" depends on the balance between the tax demanded and the resources of the population. Low amounts generally go unnoticed, while high amounts may generate tax revolts such as the 1381 Peasants' Revolt in England and the 1906 Bambatha Rebellion against colonial rule in South Africa. However, both of those cases were additional taxation, and not a substitute for other taxes being lowered.\nReligious law.\nMosaic law.\nAs prescribed in Exodus, Jewish law imposed a poll tax of a half-shekel, payable by every man above the age of twenty.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Exodus 30:11\u201316\nThe money was designated for the Tabernacle in the Exodus narrative and later for the upkeep of the Temple of Jerusalem. Priests, women, slaves and minors were exempted, but could offer it voluntarily. Payment by Samaritans or Gentiles was rejected. It was collected yearly in the month of Adar at the Temple or provincial collection offices.\nIslamic law.\n is an obligatory charity that must be given by every Muslim (or their guardian) near the end of every Ramadan, except for those in dire poverty. The amount is of wheat or barley, or its cash equivalent, to be given to the poor.\n is a land or poll tax decreed by the Quran, paid annually by non-believers in Islam living under Islamic law (residents with status). began during the reign of Muhammad (from 9 A.H.) in places like Yemen, Bahrain, and Jerash. As a poll tax, the tax usually only applied to free, abled-bodied adult men. The amount could also vary with the income of the individual. However, according to Shibli Nomani, the word is an Arabicised version of the Persian , the war tax levied by the Persian empire, which served as a model for the conquering Arabs. The Sasanian Persian emperor Nawsherwan imposed a poll tax, termed by Arab historians, varying between 12 and 2 dirhams, exempting officials, soldiers, and nobles. During the Islamic rule of Muhammad, the magi of Iran and landowners of Bahrain paid of 1 dinar or its equivalent in clothing, while the landless paid 4 dirham and a striped woolen cloak. Elsewhere, the was graded according to three classes, e.g. 48 dirhams for the rich, 24 for the middle class, and 12 for the poor.\nAlthough the tax is interpreted by many as a financial humiliation on non-Muslims, others consider it a sign of due allegiance to the political authority of Islam: part of a social contract by which non-Muslims, especially the Jews of Medina, were granted equal social and political rights, and protection of their life, property, and religion. According to some scholars, the paid by non-Muslims is parallel to the charity obligation on Muslims. However, Umar, the second Caliph, ordered a brand on the shoulder of payers, as well as requiring a tonsure and sumptuary laws to distinguish them from Muslims. Uman distinguished between and , where the former means the poll tax on non-Muslim individuals, and the latter means the land tax and sometimes the total sum of taxes paid by leaders of the non-Muslim community. Umar stressed that conversion to Islam provided exemption from , though not from .\nAmr ibn al-As, after conquering Egypt, made a census for the according to wealth classes, so that the rich paid more. Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan reformed taxes in Mesopotamia based on a calculation of the income and expenses of a typical man, determining that each adult could pay of 4 dinars, a 400% increase over the previous tax; however, this burden seemingly did not increase conversions to Islam.\nThe Cairo Geniza records demonstrate the poll tax collection becoming very strict and burdensome for the Jewish community in Egypt during the 12th century. Evidence suggests that the guardian of a minor was responsible to pay the full poll tax on his behalf until the age of ten. Even the very sick and poor widows were subject to the tax. Shelomo Dov Goitein concluded that the intolerable burden of the might have caused the mass conversion of Jews in Egypt to Islam, while more prominent Jews embraced Islam for the possibility of government positions.\nThe treaty of 1535, known as the Franco-Ottoman alliance, revolutionised relations between the Christian and Islamic states, with the poll tax playing a significant role. Previously, a non-Muslim living in Muslim territory for more than a year became liable to the poll tax. Under the treaty, French Christians in the Ottoman Empire were exempted from all . In 1855, the Ottoman Empire abolished the tax as part of reforms to equalize the status of Muslims and non-Muslims. It was replaced by a military-exemption tax on non-Muslims, the . It was once believed that the Islamic poll tax derived from a previous Byzantine poll tax, but evidence for this tax has been re-dated to Islamic times.\n reemerged in 2014 after the Islamic State conquered some parts of Iraq and Syria. Its leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi declared that Christians would face the choice of conversion, , or death. This ultimatum was read out in mosques. Many Christians fled Mosul, home to the ancient Christian communities of Iraq, leading Louis Rapha\u00ebl I Sako to say: \"For the first time in the history of Iraq, Mosul is now empty of Christians.\" ISIS issued the same ultimatum in its capital of Raqqa, Syria, demanding of pure gold from Christians in exchange for their safety.\nCanada.\nThe Chinese head tax was a fixed fee charged to each Chinese person entering Canada. The head tax was first levied after the Canadian parliament passed the Chinese Immigration Act of 1885 and was meant to discourage Chinese people from entering Canada after the completion of the Canadian Pacific Railway. The tax was abolished by the Chinese Immigration Act of 1923, which stopped all Chinese immigration except for business people, clergy, educators, students, and other categories. The 1923 act was repealed in 1947.\nCeylon.\nIn Ceylon, a poll tax was levied by the British colonial government of Ceylon in 1920. The tax charged 2 rupees per year per male adult. Those who did not pay had to work on the roads for one day in lieu of the tax. The Young Lanka League protested the tax, led by A. Ekanayake Gunasinha, and it was repealed by the Legislative Council of Ceylon in 1925 following a motion submitted by C. H. Z. Fernando.\nGreat Britain.\nThe poll tax was essentially a lay subsidy, a tax on the movable property of most of the population, to help fund war. It had first been levied in 1275 and continued under different names until the 17th century. People were taxed a percentage of the assessed value of their movable goods. That percentage varied from year to year and place to place, and which goods could be taxed differed between urban and rural locations. Churchmen were exempt, as were the poor, workers in the Royal Mint, inhabitants of the Cinque Ports, tin workers in Cornwall and Devon, and those who lived in the Palatinate counties of Cheshire and Durham.\n14th century.\nIn 1376 Britain had been fighting the Hundred Years War against France for about fifty years, and it was increasingly difficult to finance the war. In 1377 the Bad Parliament first levied a poll tax at the request of John of Gaunt the de facto head of government at the time. The tax covered a far greater share of the population than previous taxes. It was levied again in 1379 on a basis graded by social class. Finally in 1381 it was a combination of both flat rate and graduated assessments. The minimum amount payable was set at 4d, however tax collectors had to account for a 12d a head mean assessment. and has been credited as one of the main reasons behind the Peasants' Revolt in that year.\n17th century.\nThe poll tax was resurrected during the 17th century, usually related to a military emergency. It was imposed by Charles I in 1641 to finance the raising of the army against the Scottish and Irish uprisings. With the Restoration of Charles II in 1660, the Convention Parliament of 1660 instituted a poll tax to finance the disbanding of the New Model Army (pay arrears, etc.) through the &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;Poll Tax Act 1660 (12 Cha. 2. c. 9), as amended by the &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;Poll Tax (Amendment) Act 1660 (12 Cha. 2. c. 10) and the &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;Poll Tax (Amendment No. 2) Act 1660 (12 Cha. 2. c. 28). The poll tax was assessed according to \"rank\", e.g. dukes paid \u00a3100, earls \u00a360, knights \u00a320, esquires \u00a310. Eldest sons paid two-thirds of their father's rank, widows paid a third of their late husband's rank. The members of the livery companies paid according to company's rank (e.g. masters of first-tier guilds like the Mercers paid \u00a310, whereas masters of fifth-tier guilds, like the Clerks, paid 5 shillings). Professionals also paid differing rates, e.g. physicians (\u00a310), judges (\u00a320), advocates (\u00a35), attorneys (\u00a33), and so on. Anyone with property (land, etc.) paid 40 shillings per \u00a3100 earned, anyone over the age of 16 and unmarried paid twelvepence and everyone else over 16 paid sixpence.\nTo finance the Nine Years' War, a poll tax was imposed again by William III and Mary II in 1689 with the &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;Poll Tax Act 1688 (1 Will. &amp; Mar. c. 13), reassessed in 1690 adjusting rank for fortune with the &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;Poll Tax Act 1689 (2 Will. &amp; Mar. c. 2), and then again in 1691 back to rank irrespective of fortune with the &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;Poll Tax Act 1691 (3 Will. &amp; Mar. c. 6). The poll tax was imposed again in 1692 with the &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;\"Poll Tax Act 1694 (5 &amp; 6 Will. &amp; Mar. c. 14), and one final time in 1698 with the &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;Poll Tax Act 1697 (9 Will. 3. c. 38), the last poll tax in England until the 20th century.\nA poll tax (\"polemoney\") was simultaneously imposed in Scotland by the Edinburgh parliament in 1693, again in 1695, and two in 1698.\nAs the greater weight of the 17th century poll taxes fell primarily upon the wealthy and powerful, it was not too unpopular. There were grumblings within the taxed ranks about lack of differentiation by income within ranks. Ultimately, it was the inefficiency of their collection (what they brought in routinely fell far short of expected revenues) that prompted the government to abandon the poll tax after 1698.\nFar more controversial was the hearth tax introduced by the Fire-Hearth and Stoves Taxation Act 1662 (14 Cha. 2. c. 10), which imposed a hefty two shillings on every hearth in a family dwelling, which was easier to count than persons. Heavier, more permanent and more regressive than the poll tax proper, the intrusive entry of tax inspectors into private homes to count hearths was a very sore point, and it was promptly repealed with the Glorious Revolution in 1689. It was replaced with a \"window tax\" in 1695 since inspectors could count windows from outside homes.\n20th century.\nThe Community Charge, popularly dubbed the \"poll tax\", was a tax to fund local government, instituted in 1989 by the government of Margaret Thatcher. It replaced the rates that were based on the notional rental value of a house. The abolition of rates was in the Conservative Party manifesto for the 1979 general election; the replacement was proposed in the Green Paper of 1986, \"Paying for Local Government\" based on ideas developed by Dr. Madsen Pirie and Douglas Mason of the Adam Smith Institute. It was a fixed tax per adult resident, but there was a reduction for those with lower household income. Each person was to pay for the services provided in their community. This proposal was contained in the Conservative Party manifesto for the 1987 general election. The new tax replaced the rates in Scotland from the start of the 1988/89 financial year and in England and Wales from the start of the 1990/91 financial year.\nThe system was very unpopular since many thought it shifted the tax burden from the rich to the poor, as it was based on the number of occupants living in a house, rather than on the estimated market value of the house. Many tax rates set by local councils proved to be much higher than earlier predictions since the councils realized that not they, but the central government would be blamed for the tax, which led to resentment, even among some who had supported the introduction of it. The tax in different boroughs differed because local taxes paid by businesses varied and grants by central government to local authorities sometimes varied capriciously.\nMass protests were called by the All Britain Anti-Poll Tax Federation with which the vast majority of local Anti-Poll Tax Unions (APTUs) were affiliated. In Scotland, the APTUs called for mass nonpayment, which rapidly gathered widespread support and spread as far as England and Wales even though non-payment meant that people could be prosecuted. In some areas, 30% of former ratepayers defaulted. While owner-occupiers were easy to tax, nonpayers who regularly changed accommodation were almost impossible to trace. The cost of collecting the tax rose steeply, and its returns fell. Unrest grew and resulted in a number of poll tax riots. The most serious was in a protest at Trafalgar Square, London, on 31 March 1990, of more than 200,000 protesters. Terry Fields, Labour MP for Liverpool Broadgreen, was jailed for 60 days for his refusal to pay the poll tax.\nThis unrest was a factor in the fall of Thatcher. Her successor, John Major, replaced the Community Charge with the Council Tax, similar to the rating system that preceded the Community Charge. The main differences were that it was levied on capital value rather than notional rental value of a property, and that it had a 25% discount for single-occupancy dwellings.\nIn 2015, Lord Waldegrave reflected in his memoirs that the Community Charge was all his own work and that it was a serious mistake. Although he felt the policy looked like it would work, it was implemented differently from his predictions \"They went gung-ho and introduced it overnight in one go, which was never my plan and I thought they must know what they were doing \u2013 but they didn't.\"\nFrance.\nIn France, a poll tax, the capitation of 1695, was first imposed by King Louis XIV in 1695 as a temporary measure to finance the War of the League of Augsburg, and thus repealed in 1699. It was resumed during the War of Spanish Succession and in 1704 set on a permanent basis, remaining until the end of the \"Ancien regime\".\nLike the English poll tax, the French capitation tax was assessed on rank \u2013 for taxation persons, French society was divided in twenty-two \"classes\", with the Dauphin (a class by himself) paying 2,000 livres, princes of the blood paying 1,500 livres, and so on down to the lowest class, composed of day laborers and servants, who paid 1 livre each. The bulk of the common population was covered by four classes, paying 40, 30, 10 and 3 livres respectively. Unlike most other direct French taxes, nobles and clergy were not exempted from capitation taxes. It did, however, exempt the mendicant orders and the poor who contributed less than 40 sous.\nThe French clergy managed to temporarily escape capitation assessment by promising to pay a total sum of 4 million livres per annum in 1695, and then obtained permanent exemption in 1709 with a lump sum payment of 24 million livres. The \"Pays d'\u00e9tats\" (Brittany, Burgundy, etc.) and many towns also escaped assessment by promising annual fixed payments. The nobles did not escape assessment, but they obtained the right to appoint their own capitation tax assessors, which allowed them to escape most of the burden (in one calculation, they escaped &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;7\u20448 of it).\nCompounding the burden, the assessment on the capitation did not remain stable. The \"pays de taille personelle\" (basically, \"pays d'\u00e9lection\", the bulk of France and Aquitaine) secured the ability to assess the capitation tax proportionally to the taille \u2013 which effectively meant adjusting the burden heavily against the lower classes. According to the estimates of Jacques Necker in 1788, the capitation tax was so riddled in practice, that the privileged classes (nobles and clergy and towns) were largely exempt, while the lower classes were heavily crushed: the lowest peasant class, originally assessed to pay 3 livres, were now paying 24, the second lowest, assessed at 10 livres, were now paying 60 and the third-lowest assessed at 30 were paying 180. The total collection from the capitation, according to Necker in 1788, was 41 million livres, well short of the 54 million estimate, and it was projected that the revenues could have doubled if the exemptions were revoked and the original 1695 assessment properly restored.\nThe old capitation tax was repealed with the French Revolution and replaced, on 13 January 1791, with a new poll tax as part of the \"contribution personnelle mobili\u00e8re\", which lasted well into the late 19th century. It was fixed for every individual at \"three days's labor\" (assessed locally, but by statute, no less than 1 franc 50 centimes and no more than 4 francs 50 centimes, depending on the area). A dwelling tax (\"imp\u00f4t sur les portes et fen\u00eatres\", similar to the English window-tax) was imposed in 1798.\nNew Zealand.\nNew Zealand imposed a poll tax on Chinese immigrants during the 19th and early 20th centuries as part of their broader efforts to reduce the number of Chinese immigrants. The poll tax was effectively lifted in the 1930s following the invasion of China by Japan, and was finally repealed in 1944. Prime Minister Helen Clark offered New Zealand's Chinese community an official apology for the poll tax on 12 February 2002.\nPoland\u2013Lithuania.\nThe Jewish poll tax was a poll tax imposed on the Jews in Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth. It was later absorbed into the \"hiberna\" tax.\nRoman Empire.\nThe ancient Romans imposed a \"tributum capitis\" (poll tax) as one of the principal direct taxes on the peoples of the Roman provinces (\"Digest\" 50, tit.15). In the Republican period, poll taxes were principally collected by private tax farmers (\"publicani\"), but from the time of Emperor Augustus, the collections were gradually transferred to magistrates and the senates of provincial cities. The Roman census was conducted periodically in the provinces to draw up and update the poll tax register.\nThe Roman poll tax fell principally on Roman subjects in the provinces, but not on Roman citizens. Towns in the provinces who possessed the \"Jus Italicum\" (enjoying the \"privileges of Italy\") were exempted from the poll tax. The 212 edict of Emperor Caracalla (which formally conferred Roman citizenship on all residents of Roman provinces) did not, however, exempt them from the poll tax.\nThe Roman poll tax was deeply resented\u2014Tertullian bewailed the poll tax as a \"badge of slavery\"\u2014and it provoked numerous revolts in the provinces.\nPerhaps most famous is the Zealot revolt in Judaea of 66 AD. After the destruction of the temple in 70 AD, the Emperor Vespasian imposed an extra poll tax on Jews throughout the empire, the \"fiscus judaicus\", of two denarii each.\nRussia.\nThe Russian Empire imposed a poll tax in 1718. Nikolay Bunge, Finance Minister from 1881 to 1886 under Emperor Alexander III, abolished it in 1886. Poll taxes in Imperial Russia were determined by revision list enumerations.\nUnited States.\nPoll tax.\nPrior to the mid 20th century, a poll tax was implemented in some U.S. state and local jurisdictions and paying it was a requirement before one could exercise one's right to vote. After this right was extended to all races by the Fifteenth Amendment to the Constitution, many Southern states enacted poll taxes as a means of excluding African-American voters, most of whom were poor and unable to pay a tax. So as not to disenfranchise many whites, such laws sometimes included a clause exempting any people who had voted prior to enactment of the laws. The poll tax, along with literacy tests and extra-legal intimidation, such as by the Ku Klux Klan, achieved the desired effect of disenfranchising African Americans.\nGenerally, in the United States, the term \"poll tax\" is used to mean a tax that must be paid in order to vote, rather than a capitation tax simply. For example, a bill that passed the Florida House of Representatives in April 2019 has been compared to a poll tax because it requires former felons to pay all \"financial obligations\" related to their sentence, including court fines, fees, and judgments, before their voting rights will be restored as required by a referendum that passed with 64% of the vote in 2018.\nThe Twenty-fourth Amendment, ratified in 1964, prohibits both Congress and the states from conditioning the right to vote in federal elections on payment of a poll tax or any other type of tax. Poll taxes for State and local elections were declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in \"Harper v. Virginia State Board of Elections\".\nCapitation and federal taxation.\nThe ninth section of Article One of the Constitution places several limits on Congress' powers. Among them: \"No capitation, or other direct, tax shall be laid, unless in proportion to the census or enumeration herein before directed to be taken\". Capitation here means a tax of a uniform, fixed amount per taxpayer. Direct tax means a tax levied directly by the United States federal government on taxpayers, as opposed to a tax on events or transactions. The United States government levied direct taxes from time to time during the 18th and early 19th centuries. It levied direct taxes on the owners of houses, land, slaves and estates in the late 1790s but cancelled the taxes in 1802.\nAn income tax is neither a poll tax nor a capitation, as the amount of tax will vary from person to person, depending on each person's income. Until a United States Supreme Court decision in 1895, all income taxes were deemed to be excises (i.e., indirect taxes). The Revenue Act of 1861 established the first income tax in the United States, to pay for the cost of the American Civil War. This income tax was abolished after the war, in 1872. Another income tax statute in 1894 was overturned in \"Pollock v. Farmers' Loan &amp; Trust Co.\" in 1895, where the Supreme Court held that income taxes on income from property, such as rent income, interest income, and dividend income (however excepting income taxes on income from \"occupations and labor\" if only for the reason of not having been challenged in the case, \"We have considered the act only in respect of the tax on income derived from real estate, and from invested personal property\") were to be treated as direct taxes. Because the statute in question had not apportioned income taxes on income from property by population, the statute was ruled unconstitutional. Finally, ratification of the Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution in 1913 made possible modern income taxes, by limiting the Sixteenth Amendment income tax to the class of indirect excises (i.e. excises, duties, and imposts) \u2013 thus requiring no apportionment,\n a practice that would remain unchanged into the 21st century.\nEmployment-based head taxes.\nVarious cities, including Chicago and Denver, have levied head taxes with a set rate per employee targeted at large employers. After Cupertino postponed head tax proposals to 2020, Mountain View became the only city in Silicon Valley to continue to pursue such type of taxes.\nIn 2018, the Seattle city council proposed a \"head tax\" of $500 per year per employee. The proposed tax was lowered to $275 per year per employee, was passed, and became \"the biggest head tax in U.S. history\", though it was repealed less than a month later.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "24552", "revid": "39457116", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24552", "title": "Patriotism", "text": "Love and attachment to one's country\nPatriotism is the feeling of love, devotion, and a sense of attachment to one's country or state. This attachment can be a combination of different feelings for things such as the language of one's homeland, and its ethnic, cultural, political, or historical aspects. It may encompass a set of concepts closely related to nationalism, mostly civic nationalism and sometimes cultural nationalism.\nTerminology and usage.\nAn excess of patriotism is called \"chauvinism\"; another related term is \"jingoism\".\nThe English word \"patriot\" derived from \"compatriot\", in the 1590s, from Middle French in the 15th century. The French word's and originated directly from Late Latin \"fellow-countryman\" in the 6th century. From Greek \"fellow countryman\", from \"of one's fathers\", \"fatherland\". The term \"patriot\" was \"applied to barbarians who were perceived to be either uncivilized or primitive and who had only a common Patris or fatherland.\" The original European meaning of \"patriots\" applied to anyone who was a fellow countryman regardless of the socio-economic status.\nThe use of patriotism and nationalism originally shared a similar meaning in the 19th century, but their use and connotation gradually grew apart. The Merriam-Webster defines patriotism as \"love for or devotion to one\u2019s country\", whereas nationalism is defined as \"loyalty and devotion to a nation\". Today, nationalism has gained a more negative connotation. In contrast, patriotism is used to refer to genuine pride in one's nation, recognizing both its merits and flaws. A similar distinction between the terms was also upheld by George Orwell, whose essay \"Notes on Nationalism\", distinguished patriotism from the related concept of nationalism:\nBy 'patriotism' I mean devotion to a particular place and a particular way of life, which one believes to be the best in the world but has no wish to force upon other people. Patriotism is of its nature defensive, both militarily and culturally. Nationalism, on the other hand, is inseparable from the desire for power. The abiding purpose of every nationalist is to secure more power and more prestige, \"not\" for himself but for the nation or other unit in which he has chosen to sink his own individuality.\nHistory.\nThe notions of civic virtue and group dedication can be found in cultures globally throughout history. For Enlightenment thinkers of 18th-century Europe, loyalty to the state was chiefly considered in contrast to loyalty to the Church. It was argued that clerics should not be allowed to teach in public schools since their was heaven, so they could not inspire a love of the homeland in their students. One of the most influential proponents of this notion of patriotism was Jean-Jacques Rousseau.\nEnlightenment thinkers also criticized what they saw as the excess of patriotism. In 1774, Samuel Johnson published \"The Patriot\", a critique of what he viewed as false patriotism. On the evening of 7 April 1774, he made the famous statement, \"Patriotism is the last refuge of the scoundrel\". James Boswell, who reported this comment in his \"Life of Johnson\", does not provide context for the quote, and it has therefore been argued that Johnson was in fact attacking a false use of \"patriotism\" by contemporaries such as John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute (the patriot-minister) and his supporters; Johnson spoke elsewhere in favor of what he considered \"true\" patriotism. However, there is no direct evidence to contradict the widely held belief that Johnson's famous remark was a criticism of patriotism itself.\nCultural aspects.\nMany patriotic people take pride in sharing a distinct, common culture, believing it to be central to their national identity and unity. Many are devoted to the preservation of their traditional culture and encourage cultural assimilation by people from other cultures. However, some of the more civic forms of patriotism tend to de-emphasize ethnic culture in favor of a shared political culture.\nPhilosophical issues.\nPatriotism may be strengthened by adherence to a national religion (a civil religion or even a theocracy). This is the opposite of the separation of church and state demanded by the Enlightenment thinkers who saw patriotism and faith as similar and opposed forces. Michael Billig and Jean Bethke Elshtain both argued that the difference between patriotism and faith is difficult to discern and relies largely on the attitude of the one doing the labeling.\nChristopher Heath Wellman, professor of philosophy at Washington University in St. Louis, says a popular view of the \"patriotist\" position is robust obligations to compatriots and only minimal samaritan responsibilities to foreigners. Wellman calls this position \"patriotist\" rather than \"nationalist\" to single out the members of territorial, political units rather than cultural groups.\nOpposition.\nVoltaire stated that \"It is lamentable, that to be a good patriot one must become the enemy of the rest of mankind.\" Arthur Schopenhauer wrote that \"The cheapest sort of pride is national pride; for if a man is proud of his own nation, it argues that he has no qualities of his own of which a person can be proud.\"\nK\u014dtoku Sh\u016bsui, a famous Japanese anarchist of the late 19th/early 20th century, devoted a large section of his widely read \"Imperialism, Monster of the Twentieth Century\" to a condemnation of patriotism. One of the many arguments is based on the Confucian value of empathy: \"I am as convinced as Mencius that any man would rush without hesitation to rescue a child who was about to fall into a well... A human being moved by such selfless love and charity does not pause to think whether the child is a family member or a close relative. When he rescues the child from danger, he does not even ask himself whether the child is his own or belongs to another.\"143 Patriotism is used to dehumanize others whom we would naturally have empathy for. He argues, \"[P]atriotism is a discriminating and arbitrary sentiment confined to those who belong to a single nation-state or live together within common national borders\",59 a sentiment cultivated and used by militarists in their drive for war. \nMarxists have taken various stances regarding patriotism. On one hand, Karl Marx famously stated that \"The working men have no country\" and that \"the supremacy of the proletariat will cause [national differences] to vanish still faster.\" The same view is promoted by present-day Trotskyists such as Alan Woods, who is \"in favor of tearing down all frontiers and creating a socialist world commonwealth.\" On the other hand, Marxist-Leninists and Maoists are usually in favor of socialist patriotism based on the theory of socialism in one country.\nAgainst primordial arguments in favour of national patriotism, Eric Hobsbawm wrote that such a concept was - for most of human history - \"so remote from the real experience of most human beings\".\nAnarchists oppose patriotism. This was exemplified by Emma Goldman, who stated: Indeed, conceit, arrogance, and egotism are the essentials of patriotism. Let me illustrate. Patriotism assumes that our globe is divided into little spots, each one surrounded by an iron gate. Those who have had the fortune of being born on some particular spot, consider themselves better, nobler, grander, and more intelligent than the living beings inhabiting any other spot. It is, therefore, the duty of everyone living in that chosen spot to fight, kill, and die in an attempt to impose his superiority upon all the others.\nRegion-specific issues.\nIn the European Union, thinkers such as J\u00fcrgen Habermas have advocated a \"Euro-patriotism\", but patriotism in Europe is usually directed at the nation-state and more often than not coincides with \"Euroscepticism\".\nSurveys.\nSeveral surveys have tried to measure patriotism, such as the Correlates of War project which found some correlation between war propensity and patriotism. The results from different studies are time-dependent. For example, according to the project, patriotism in Germany before World War I ranked at or near the top . According to a study by the Identity Foundation, 60% of Germans were proud of their country in 2009. According to Statista, the figure was as high as 83%. In a 2020 Pew Research Center survey, 53% of participants surveyed in Germany said they were proud of their country, the highest figure among the nations surveyed (France (45%), United Kingdom (41%), United States (39%).\n, the World Values Survey polls for national values and beliefs. The survey includes the question \"Are you proud to be [insert nationality]?\"; the answers to which range from 1 (not proud) to 4 (very proud). They then use the average answer given to create comparisons between not only nations but also high and low income citizens.\nIn 2022, U.S. adults who said they were \"extremely proud\" to be an American hit an all-time low, according to a Gallup poll.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "24553", "revid": "42537234", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24553", "title": "Protein biosynthesis", "text": "Assembly of proteins inside biological cells\nProtein biosynthesis, or protein synthesis, is a core biological process, occurring inside cells, balancing the loss of cellular proteins (via degradation or export) through the production of fresh proteins. Proteins perform a number of critical functions as enzymes, structural proteins or hormones. Protein synthesis is a very similar process for both prokaryotes and eukaryotes but there are some distinct differences.\nProtein synthesis can be divided broadly into two phases: transcription and translation. During transcription, a section of DNA encoding a protein, known as a gene, is converted into a molecule called messenger RNA (mRNA). This conversion is carried out by enzymes, known as RNA polymerases, in the nucleus of the cell. In eukaryotes, this mRNA is initially produced in a premature form (pre-mRNA) which undergoes post-transcriptional modifications to produce mature mRNA. The mature mRNA is exported from the cell nucleus via nuclear pores to the cytoplasm of the cell for translation to occur. During translation, the mRNA is read by ribosomes which use the nucleotide sequence of the mRNA to determine the sequence of amino acids. The ribosomes catalyze the formation of covalent peptide bonds between the encoded amino acids to form a polypeptide chain.\nFollowing translation the polypeptide chain must fold to form a functional protein; for example, to function as an enzyme the polypeptide chain must fold correctly to produce a functional active site. To adopt a functional three-dimensional shape, the polypeptide chain must first form a series of smaller underlying structures called secondary structures. The polypeptide chain in these secondary structures then folds to produce the overall 3D tertiary structure. Once correctly folded, the protein can undergo further maturation through different post-translational modifications, which can alter the protein's ability to function, its location within the cell (e.g. cytoplasm or nucleus) and its ability to interact with other proteins.\nProtein biosynthesis has a key role in disease as changes and errors in this process, through underlying DNA mutations or protein misfolding, are often the underlying causes of a disease. DNA mutations change the subsequent mRNA sequence, which then alters the mRNA encoded amino acid sequence. Mutations can cause the polypeptide chain to be shorter by generating a stop sequence which causes early termination of translation. Alternatively, a mutation in the mRNA sequence changes the specific amino acid encoded at that position in the polypeptide chain. This amino acid change can impact the protein's ability to function or to fold correctly. Misfolded proteins have a tendency to form dense protein clumps, which are often implicated in diseases, particularly neurological disorders including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease.\nTranscription.\nTranscription occurs in the nucleus using DNA as a template to produce mRNA. In eukaryotes, this mRNA molecule is known as pre-mRNA as it undergoes post-transcriptional modifications in the nucleus to produce a mature mRNA molecule. However, in prokaryotes post-transcriptional modifications are not required so the mature mRNA molecule is immediately produced by transcription.\nInitially, an enzyme known as a helicase acts on the molecule of DNA. DNA has an antiparallel, double helix structure composed of two, complementary polynucleotide strands, held together by hydrogen bonds between the base pairs. The helicase disrupts the hydrogen bonds causing a region of DNA\u00a0\u2013 corresponding to a gene\u00a0\u2013 to unwind, separating the two DNA strands and exposing a series of bases. Despite DNA being a double-stranded molecule, only one of the strands acts as a template for pre-mRNA synthesis; this strand is known as the template strand. The other DNA strand (which is complementary to the template strand) is known as the coding strand.\nBoth DNA and RNA have intrinsic directionality, meaning there are two distinct ends of the molecule. This property of directionality is due to the asymmetrical underlying nucleotide subunits, with a phosphate group on one side of the pentose sugar and a base on the other. The five carbons in the pentose sugar are numbered from 1' (where ' means prime) to 5'. Therefore, the phosphodiester bonds connecting the nucleotides are formed by joining the hydroxyl group on the 3' carbon of one nucleotide to the phosphate group on the 5' carbon of another nucleotide. Hence, the coding strand of DNA runs in a 5' to 3' direction and the complementary, template DNA strand runs in the opposite direction from 3' to 5'.\nThe enzyme RNA polymerase binds to the exposed template strand and reads from the gene in the 3' to 5' direction. Simultaneously, the RNA polymerase synthesizes a single strand of pre-mRNA in the 5'-to-3' direction by catalysing the formation of phosphodiester bonds between activated nucleotides (free in the nucleus) that are capable of complementary base pairing with the template strand. Behind the moving RNA polymerase the two strands of DNA rejoin, so only 12 base pairs of DNA are exposed at one time. RNA polymerase builds the pre-mRNA molecule at a rate of 20 nucleotides per second enabling the production of thousands of pre-mRNA molecules from the same gene in an hour. Despite the fast rate of synthesis, the RNA polymerase enzyme contains its own proofreading mechanism. The proofreading mechanisms allows the RNA polymerase to remove incorrect nucleotides (which are not complementary to the template strand of DNA) from the growing pre-mRNA molecule through an excision reaction. When RNA polymerases reaches a specific DNA sequence which terminates transcription, RNA polymerase detaches and pre-mRNA synthesis is complete.\nThe pre-mRNA molecule synthesized is complementary to the template DNA strand and shares the same nucleotide sequence as the coding DNA strand. However, there is one crucial difference in the nucleotide composition of DNA and mRNA molecules. DNA is composed of the bases: guanine, cytosine, adenine and thymine (G, C, A and T). RNA is also composed of four bases: guanine, cytosine, adenine and uracil. In RNA molecules, the DNA base thymine is replaced by uracil which is able to base pair with adenine. Therefore, in the pre-mRNA molecule, all complementary bases which would be thymine in the coding DNA strand are replaced by uracil.\nPost-transcriptional modifications.\nOnce transcription is complete, the pre-mRNA molecule undergoes post-transcriptional modifications to produce a mature mRNA molecule.\nThere are 3 key steps within post-transcriptional modifications:.\nThe 5' cap is added to the 5' end of the pre-mRNA molecule and is composed of a guanine nucleotide modified through methylation. The purpose of the 5' cap is to prevent break down of mature mRNA molecules before translation, the cap also aids binding of the ribosome to the mRNA to start translation and enables mRNA to be differentiated from other RNAs in the cell. In contrast, the 3' Poly(A) tail is added to the 3' end of the mRNA molecule and is composed of 100\u2013200 adenine bases. These distinct mRNA modifications enable the cell to detect that the full mRNA message is intact if both the 5' cap and 3' tail are present.\nThis modified pre-mRNA molecule then undergoes the process of RNA splicing. Genes are composed of a series of introns and exons, introns are nucleotide sequences which do not encode a protein while, exons are nucleotide sequences that directly encode a protein. Introns and exons are present in both the underlying DNA sequence and the pre-mRNA molecule, therefore, to produce a mature mRNA molecule encoding a protein, splicing must occur. During splicing, the intervening introns are removed from the pre-mRNA molecule by a multi-protein complex known as a spliceosome (composed of over 150 proteins and RNA). This mature mRNA molecule is then exported into the cytoplasm through nuclear pores in the envelope of the nucleus.\nTranslation.\nDuring translation, ribosomes synthesize polypeptide chains from mRNA template molecules. In eukaryotes, translation occurs in the cytoplasm of the cell, where the ribosomes are located either free floating or attached to the endoplasmic reticulum. In prokaryotes, which lack a nucleus, the processes of both transcription and translation occur in the cytoplasm.\nRibosomes are complex molecular machines, made of a mixture of protein and ribosomal RNA, arranged into two subunits (a large and a small subunit), which surround the mRNA molecule. The ribosome reads the mRNA molecule in a 5'-3' direction and uses it as a template to determine the order of amino acids in the polypeptide chain. To translate the mRNA molecule, the ribosome uses small molecules, known as transfer RNAs (tRNA), to deliver the correct amino acids to the ribosome. Each tRNA is composed of 70\u201380 nucleotides and adopts a characteristic cloverleaf structure due to the formation of hydrogen bonds between the nucleotides within the molecule. There are around 60 different types of tRNAs, each tRNA binds to a specific sequence of three nucleotides (known as a codon) within the mRNA molecule and delivers a specific amino acid.\nThe ribosome initially attaches to the mRNA at the start codon (AUG) and begins to translate the molecule. The mRNA nucleotide sequence is read in triplets; three adjacent nucleotides in the mRNA molecule correspond to a single codon. Each tRNA has an exposed sequence of three nucleotides, known as the anticodon, which are complementary in sequence to a specific codon that may be present in mRNA. For example, the first codon encountered is the start codon composed of the nucleotides AUG. The correct tRNA with the anticodon (complementary 3 nucleotide sequence UAC) binds to the mRNA using the ribosome. This tRNA delivers the correct amino acid corresponding to the mRNA codon, in the case of the start codon, this is the amino acid methionine. The next codon (adjacent to the start codon) is then bound by the correct tRNA with complementary anticodon, delivering the next amino acid to ribosome. The ribosome then uses its peptidyl transferase enzymatic activity to catalyze the formation of the covalent peptide bond between the two adjacent amino acids.\nThe ribosome then moves along the mRNA molecule to the third codon. The ribosome then releases the first tRNA molecule, as only two tRNA molecules can be brought together by a single ribosome at one time. The next complementary tRNA with the correct anticodon complementary to the third codon is selected, delivering the next amino acid to the ribosome which is covalently joined to the growing polypeptide chain. This process continues with the ribosome moving along the mRNA molecule adding up to 15 amino acids per second to the polypeptide chain. Behind the first ribosome, up to 50 additional ribosomes can bind to the mRNA molecule forming a polysome, this enables simultaneous synthesis of multiple identical polypeptide chains. Termination of the growing polypeptide chain occurs when the ribosome encounters a stop codon (UAA, UAG, or UGA) in the mRNA molecule. When this occurs, no tRNA can recognise it and a release factor induces the release of the complete polypeptide chain from the ribosome.\nProtein folding.\nOnce synthesis of the polypeptide chain is complete, the polypeptide chain folds to adopt a specific structure which enables the protein to carry out its functions. The basic form of protein structure is known as the primary structure, which is simply the polypeptide chain i.e. a sequence of covalently bonded amino acids. The primary structure of a protein is encoded by a gene. Therefore, any changes to the sequence of the gene can alter the primary structure of the protein and all subsequent levels of protein structure, ultimately changing the overall structure and function.\nThe primary structure of a protein (the polypeptide chain) can then fold or coil to form the secondary structure of the protein. The most common types of secondary structure are known as an alpha helix or beta sheet, these are small structures produced by hydrogen bonds forming within the polypeptide chain. This secondary structure then folds to produce the tertiary structure of the protein. The tertiary structure is the proteins overall 3D structure which is made of different secondary structures folding together. In the tertiary structure, key protein features e.g. the active site, are folded and formed enabling the protein to function. Finally, some proteins may adopt a complex quaternary structure. Most proteins are made of a single polypeptide chain, however, some proteins are composed of multiple polypeptide chains (known as subunits) which fold and interact to form the quaternary structure. Hence, the overall protein is a multi-subunit complex composed of multiple folded, polypeptide chain subunits e.g. haemoglobin.\nPost-translation events.\nThere are events that follow protein biosynthesis such as proteolysis and protein-folding. Proteolysis refers to the cleavage of proteins by proteases and the breakdown of proteins into amino acids by the action of enzymes.\nPost-translational modifications.\nWhen protein folding into the mature, functional 3D state is complete, it is not necessarily the end of the protein maturation pathway. A folded protein can still undergo further processing through post-translational modifications. There are over 200 known types of post-translational modification, these modifications can alter protein activity, the ability of the protein to interact with other proteins and where the protein is found within the cell e.g. in the cell nucleus or cytoplasm. Through post-translational modifications, the diversity of proteins encoded by the genome is expanded by 2 to 3 orders of magnitude.\nThere are four key classes of post-translational modification:\nCleavage.\nCleavage of proteins is an irreversible post-translational modification carried out by enzymes known as proteases. These proteases are often highly specific and cause hydrolysis of a limited number of peptide bonds within the target protein. The resulting shortened protein has an altered polypeptide chain with different amino acids at the start and end of the chain. This post-translational modification often alters the proteins function, the protein can be inactivated or activated by the cleavage and can display new biological activities.\nAddition of chemical groups.\nFollowing translation, small chemical groups can be added onto amino acids within the mature protein structure. Examples of processes which add chemical groups to the target protein include methylation, acetylation and phosphorylation.\nMethylation is the reversible addition of a methyl group onto an amino acid catalyzed by methyltransferase enzymes. Methylation occurs on at least 9 of the 20 common amino acids, however, it mainly occurs on the amino acids lysine and arginine. One example of a protein which is commonly methylated is a histone. Histones are proteins found in the nucleus of the cell. DNA is tightly wrapped round histones and held in place by other proteins and interactions between negative charges in the DNA and positive charges on the histone. A highly specific pattern of amino acid methylation on the histone proteins is used to determine which regions of DNA are tightly wound and unable to be transcribed and which regions are loosely wound and able to be transcribed.\nHistone-based regulation of DNA transcription is also modified by acetylation. Acetylation is the reversible covalent addition of an acetyl group onto a lysine amino acid by the enzyme acetyltransferase. The acetyl group is removed from a donor molecule known as acetyl coenzyme A and transferred onto the target protein. Histones undergo acetylation on their lysine residues by enzymes known as histone acetyltransferase. The effect of acetylation is to weaken the charge interactions between the histone and DNA, thereby making more genes in the DNA accessible for transcription.\nThe final, prevalent post-translational chemical group modification is phosphorylation. Phosphorylation is the reversible, covalent addition of a phosphate group to specific amino acids (serine, threonine and tyrosine) within the protein. The phosphate group is removed from the donor molecule ATP by a protein kinase and transferred onto the hydroxyl group of the target amino acid, this produces adenosine diphosphate as a byproduct. This process can be reversed and the phosphate group removed by the enzyme protein phosphatase. Phosphorylation can create a binding site on the phosphorylated protein which enables it to interact with other proteins and generate large, multi-protein complexes. Alternatively, phosphorylation can change the level of protein activity by altering the ability of the protein to bind its substrate.\nAddition of complex molecules.\nPost-translational modifications can incorporate more complex, large molecules into the folded protein structure. One common example of this is glycosylation, the addition of a polysaccharide molecule, which is widely considered to be most common post-translational modification.\nIn glycosylation, a polysaccharide molecule (known as a glycan) is covalently added to the target protein by glycosyltransferases enzymes and modified by glycosidases in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus. Glycosylation can have a critical role in determining the final, folded 3D structure of the target protein. In some cases glycosylation is necessary for correct folding. N-linked glycosylation promotes protein folding by increasing solubility and mediates the protein binding to protein chaperones. Chaperones are proteins responsible for folding and maintaining the structure of other proteins.\nThere are broadly two types of glycosylation, N-linked glycosylation and O-linked glycosylation. N-linked glycosylation starts in the endoplasmic reticulum with the addition of a precursor glycan. The precursor glycan is modified in the Golgi apparatus to produce complex glycan bound covalently to the nitrogen in an asparagine amino acid. In contrast, O-linked glycosylation is the sequential covalent addition of individual sugars onto the oxygen in the amino acids serine and threonine within the mature protein structure.\nFormation of covalent bonds.\nMany proteins produced within the cell are secreted outside the cell to function as extracellular proteins. Extracellular proteins are exposed to a wide variety of conditions. To stabilize the 3D protein structure, covalent bonds are formed either within the protein or between the different polypeptide chains in the quaternary structure. The most prevalent type is a disulfide bond (also known as a disulfide bridge). A disulfide bond is formed between two cysteine amino acids using their side chain chemical groups containing a Sulphur atom, these chemical groups are known as thiol functional groups. Disulfide bonds act to stabilize the pre-existing structure of the protein. Disulfide bonds are formed in an oxidation reaction between two thiol groups and therefore, need an oxidizing environment to react. As a result, disulfide bonds are typically formed in the oxidizing environment of the endoplasmic reticulum catalyzed by enzymes called protein disulfide isomerases. Disulfide bonds are rarely formed in the cytoplasm as it is a reducing environment.\nRole of protein synthesis in disease.\nMany diseases are caused by mutations in genes, due to the direct connection between the DNA nucleotide sequence and the amino acid sequence of the encoded protein. Changes to the primary structure of the protein can result in the protein mis-folding or malfunctioning. Mutations within a single gene have been identified as a cause of multiple diseases, including sickle cell disease, known as single gene disorders.\nSickle cell disease.\nSickle cell disease is a group of diseases caused by a mutation in a subunit of hemoglobin, a protein found in red blood cells responsible for transporting oxygen. The most dangerous of the sickle cell diseases is known as sickle cell anemia. Sickle cell anemia is the most common homozygous recessive single gene disorder, meaning the affected individual must carry a mutation in both copies of the affected gene (one inherited from each parent) to experience the disease. Hemoglobin has a complex quaternary structure and is composed of four polypeptide subunits\u00a0\u2013 two A subunits and two B subunits. Patients with sickle cell anemia have a missense or substitution mutation in the gene encoding the hemoglobin B subunit polypeptide chain. A missense mutation means the nucleotide mutation alters the overall codon triplet such that a different amino acid is paired with the new codon. In the case of sickle cell anemia, the most common missense mutation is a single nucleotide mutation from thymine to adenine in the hemoglobin B subunit gene. This changes codon 6 from encoding the amino acid glutamic acid to encoding valine.\nThis change in the primary structure of the hemoglobin B subunit polypeptide chain alters the functionality of the hemoglobin multi-subunit complex in low oxygen conditions. When red blood cells unload oxygen into the tissues of the body, the mutated haemoglobin protein starts to stick together to form a semi-solid structure within the red blood cell. This distorts the shape of the red blood cell, resulting in the characteristic \"sickle\" shape, and reduces cell flexibility. This rigid, distorted red blood cell can accumulate in blood vessels creating a blockage. The blockage prevents blood flow to tissues and can lead to tissue death which causes great pain to the individual.\nCancer.\nCancers form as a result of gene mutations as well as improper protein translation. In addition to cancer cells proliferating abnormally, they suppress the expression of anti-apoptotic or pro-apoptotic genes or proteins. Most cancer cells see a mutation in the signaling protein Ras, which functions as an on/off signal transductor in cells. In cancer cells, the RAS protein becomes persistently active, thus promoting the proliferation of the cell due to the absence of any regulation. Additionally, most cancer cells carry two mutant copies of the regulator gene p53, which acts as a gatekeeper for damaged genes and initiates apoptosis in malignant cells. In its absence, the cell cannot initiate apoptosis or signal for other cells to destroy it.\nAs the tumor cells proliferate, they either remain confined to one area and are called benign, or become malignant cells that migrate to other areas of the body. Oftentimes, these malignant cells secrete proteases that break apart the extracellular matrix of tissues. This then allows the cancer to enter its terminal stage called Metastasis, in which the cells enter the bloodstream or the lymphatic system to travel to a new part of the body.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In addition, most cyanobacteria use phycobiliproteins, water-soluble pigments which occur in the cytoplasm of the chloroplast, to capture light energy and pass it on to the chlorophylls. (Some cyanobacteria, the prochlorophytes, use chlorophyll b instead of phycobilin.) It is thought that the chloroplasts in plants and algae all evolved from cyanobacteria.\nSeveral other groups of bacteria use the bacteriochlorophyll pigments (similar to the chlorophylls) for photosynthesis. Unlike the cyanobacteria, these bacteria do not produce oxygen; they typically use hydrogen sulfide rather than water as the electron donor.\nRecently, a very different pigment has been found in some marine Gammaproteobacteria: proteorhodopsin.

Carroll", "text": "British occultist\nPeter James Carroll (born 1953) is an English occultist and writer. He is one of the originators of chaos magic theory, a cofounder of the Illuminates of Thanateros, and the founder and chancellor of Arcanorium College.\nCareer.\nIn the late 1970s, Peter Carroll and Ray Sherwin, two young British occultists interested in ritual magic, began to publish a magazine called \"The New Equinox\". Both men were connected with a burgeoning occult scene developing around The Phoenix, a metaphysical bookshop in London's East End. Having grown dissatisfied with the state of the magical arts and the deficiencies they saw in the available occult groups, they published a small announcement in a 1978 issue of their magazine, announcing the creation of the Illuminates of Thanateros (IOT), which has been described as \"an unprecedented attempt of institutionalising one of the most individualising currents in the history of 'Western learned magic'\".\nCarroll first issued \"Liber Null\" in 1978 and \"Psychonaut\" in 1982. They were published together in the 1987 book \"Liber Null &amp; Psychonaut\", which is considered one of the defining works of the chaos magic movement. He has also written columns for the \"Chaos International\" magazine under the names Pete Carroll and \"Stokastikos\".\nCarroll elaborated a system heavily influenced by Austin Osman Spare in his early writings, particularly \"Liber Null\" (1978). However, somewhat confusingly, Carroll uses the term 'Kia' to refer to the consciousness of the individual: \"the elusive 'I' which confers self-awareness\". The more general universal force, of which Kia is an aspect, Carroll termed 'Chaos': \"The unity which appears to the mind to exert the twin functions of will and perception is called \"Kia\" by magicians. Sometimes it is called the spirit, or soul, or life force, instead... Kia is capable of occult power because it is a fragment of the great life force of the universe... The \"thing\" responsible for the origin and continued action of events is called \"Chaos\" by magicians... Chaos... is the force which has caused life to evolve itself out of dust, and is currently most concentratedly manifest in the human life force, or Kia, where it is the source of consciousness... To the extent that the Kia can become one with Chaos it can extend its will and perception into the universe to accomplish magic.\"\nIn 1995, Carroll announced his desire to step down from the \"roles of magus and pontiff of chaos\". This statement was originally delivered at the same IOT international meeting which Carroll discussed in an article titled \"The Ice War\" in \"Chaos International\".\nIn 2005, he appeared as a chaos magic instructor at Maybe Logic Academy at the request of Robert Anton Wilson.\nHoly Guardian Angel.\nCarroll split the concept of the Holy Guardian Angel in two and speaks of two Holy Guardian Angels. According to his work \"Liber Null and Psychonaut\", one is the Augoeides, a projected image of whatever the magician strives for; the other is quantum uncertainty, which ultimately determines the acts of the magician and is a spark of the only true creative force, the chaos of chaos magic.\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWorks cited.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "24560", "revid": "20957809", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24560", "title": "Intact dilation and extraction", "text": "Surgical procedure to remove a fetus from the uterus\nIntact dilation and extraction (D&amp;X, IDX, or intact D&amp;E) is a surgical procedure that terminates and removes an intact fetus from the uterus. The procedure is used both after miscarriages and for abortions in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. When used to perform an abortion, an intact D&amp;E can occur after feticide or on a live fetus.\nIn the United States, where federal law describes an intact D&amp;E on a live fetus as a partial-birth abortion, the procedure is uncommon. For example, in 2000, only 0.17% of all abortions in the United States (2,232 of 1,313,000) were performed using an intact D&amp;E. Around that time, its usage became a focal point of the U.S. abortion debate. The 2003 federal Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act, which was upheld by the Supreme Court of the United States in the case of \"Gonzales v. Carhart\", outlaws an intact D&amp;E of a fetus with a heartbeat under most, though not all, circumstances.&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIndications.\nAs with non-intact D&amp;E or labor induction in the second trimester, the purpose of D&amp;E is to end a pregnancy by removing the fetus and placenta. Patients who have a fetus diagnosed with severe congenital anomalies may prefer an intact procedure to allow for viewing of the remains, grieving, and achieving closure. In cases where an autopsy has been requested, an intact procedure allows for a more complete examination of the body.\nAn intact D&amp;E is also used in abortions to minimize the passage of instruments into the uterus, reducing the risk of trauma. It also reduces the risk of cervical lacerations that may be caused by the removal of bony parts from the uterus and the risk of retention of fetal parts in the uterus such as brain matter and tissue.\nProcedure.\nAs with non-intact D&amp;E, intact D&amp;E may be performed in freestanding clinics, ambulatory surgical centers, and in hospitals. Intra-operative pain control is usually dependent on the setting and patient characteristics but commonly involves local analgesia with either IV sedation or general anesthesia. Preoperative antibiotics are administered to reduce the risk of infection. In cases where the woman is Rh-negative, Rho(D) immunoglobulin (RhoGam) is administered to prevent the risk of developing erythroblastosis fetalis (hemolytic disease of the newborn) in subsequent pregnancies. Intact D&amp;E is more feasible among women with higher parity, at higher gestational ages, and when cervical dilation is greater. There are no absolute contraindications.\nCervical preparation.\nThe surgery is preceded by cervical preparation, which may take several days. Osmotic dilators, natural or synthetic rods that absorb moisture from the cervix, are placed in the cervix and mechanically dilate the cervix over the course of hours to days. Misoprostol can be used to soften the cervix further. Intact D&amp;E can only be performed with 2\u20135 centimeters of cervical dilation.\nFetal termination.\nFetal injection of digoxin or potassium chloride may be administered at the beginning of the procedure to allow for softening of the fetal bones or to comply with relevant laws in the physician's jurisdiction and the U.S. federal Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act. Umbilical cord transection can also be used to induce fetal demise prior to removal.\nRemoval of fetus and placenta.\nDuring the surgery, the fetus is removed from the uterus in the breech position. If the fetal presentation is not breech, forceps or manual manipulation can be used to turn it to a breech presentation while in the uterus (internal version). The fetal skull is usually the largest part of the fetal body and its removal may require mechanical collapse if it is too large to fit through the cervical canal. Decompression of the skull can be accomplished by incision and suction of the brain or by using forceps to collapse the skull.\nRecovery.\nRecovery from an intact D&amp;E is similar to recovery from a non-intact D&amp;E. Postoperative pain is usually minimal and managed with NSAIDs. In cases of uterine atony and corresponding blood loss, methergine or misoprostol can be given to encourage uterine contraction and achieve hemostasis. Patients who have recently undergone an intact D&amp;E are monitored for signs of coagulopathy, uterine perforation, uterine atony, retained tissue, or hemorrhage.\nComplications.\nThe risks of intact D&amp;E are similar to the risks of non-intact D&amp;E and include postoperative infection, hemorrhage, or uterine injury. Overall, the complication rate is low, with rates of serious complications (those requiring blood transfusion, surgery, or hospital treatment) ranging from 0 per 1,000 cases to 2.94 per 1,000 cases. The rate of minor complications is approximately 50 in 1,000 (5%), the same as the minor complication rate for non-intact D&amp;E; the rate of serious complications is higher in non-intact D&amp;E.\nData directly comparing the safety of non-intact to intact D&amp;E are limited. There is no difference in postoperative blood loss or major complications when compared to non-intact D&amp;E. There is no difference in risk of subsequent preterm delivery. The risk of retained tissue is lower since the fetus is removed intact.\nIn some cases, the physician may not be able to remove the fetus intact due to anatomical limitations. This may present a psychological problem for the patient who wishes to view the remains, or make a comprehensive autopsy impossible, precluding an accurate postmortem diagnosis of fetal anomalies.\nSociety and culture.\nUnited States politics.\nThe term \"partial-birth abortion\" is primarily used in political discourse\u2014chiefly regarding the legality of abortion in the United States. The term is not recognized as a medical term by the American Medical Association nor the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. This term was first suggested in 1995 by Congressman Charles T. Canady, while developing the original proposed Partial-Birth Abortion Ban. According to Keri Folmar, the lawyer responsible for the bill's language, the term was developed in early 1995 in a meeting among herself, Charles T. Canady, and National Right to Life Committee lobbyist Douglas Johnson. Canady could not find this particular abortion practice named in any medical textbook, and therefore he and his aides named it. \"Partial-birth abortion\" was first used in the media on June 4, 1995, in a \"Washington Times\" article covering the bill.\nIn the U.S., a federal statute defines \"partial-birth abortion\" as any abortion in which the life of the fetus is terminated after having been extracted from the mother's body to a point \"past the navel [of the fetus]\" or \"in the case of head-first presentation, the entire fetal head is outside the body of the mother\" at the time the life is terminated. The U.S. Supreme Court has held that the terms \"partial-birth abortion\" and \"intact dilation and extraction\" are basically synonymous. However, there are cases where these overlapping terms do not coincide. For example, the intact D&amp;E procedure may be used to remove a deceased fetus (e.g., due to a miscarriage or feticide) that is developed enough to require dilation of the cervix for its extraction. Removing a dead fetus does not meet the federal legal definition of \"partial-birth abortion,\" which specifies that partial live delivery must precede \"the overt act, other than completion of delivery, that kills the partially delivered, living fetus.\"\nIn addition to the federal ban, there have also been a number of state partial-birth abortion bans. There, courts have found that state legislation (rather than federal legislation) intended to ban \"partial-birth abortions\" could be interpreted to apply to some non-intact dilation and evacuation (D&amp;E) procedures. Non-intact D&amp;E, though performed at similar gestational ages, is a fundamentally different procedure.\nControversy.\nSome people believe the D&amp;E procedure illustrates that abortion, and especially late-term abortion, is the taking of a human life and therefore ought to be illegal. People who believe this consider the procedure to be infanticide, a position that many in the anti-abortion movement extend to cover all abortions. Some advocates, both for and against abortion rights, see the intact D&amp;E issue as a central battleground in the wider abortion debate, attempting to set a legal precedent so as to either gradually reduce or gradually increase access to all abortion methods.\nDr. Martin Haskell has called the intact D&amp;E procedure \"a quick, surgical outpatient method\" for late second-trimester and early third-trimester abortions. The Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003 describes it as \"a gruesome and inhumane procedure that is never medically necessary.\"\nAccording to a BBC report about the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in \"Gonzales v. Carhart\", \"government lawyers and others who favour the ban, have said there are alternative and more widely used procedures that are still legal - which involves dismembering the fetus in the uterus.\" An article in \"Harper's\" magazine stated that, \"Defending the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban... requires arguing to judges that pulling a fetus from a woman's body in dismembered pieces is legal, medically acceptable, and safe; but that pulling a fetus out intact, so that if the woman wishes the fetus can be wrapped in a blanket and handed to her, is appropriately punishable by a fine, or up to two years' imprisonment, or both.\" Alternately, opponents of abortion rights frame the issue as one in which a partially-born infant's life is disposable, whereas pulling the infant only a few more inches down the birth canal automatically transforms it into \"a living person, possessing rights and deserving of protection.\" The U.S. Supreme Court has stated that intact D&amp;E remains legal as long as there is first a feticidal injection while the fetus is still completely inside of the mother's body.\nThere is also controversy about why this procedure is used. Although prominent defenders of the method asserted during 1995 and 1996 that it was used only or mostly in acute medical circumstances, lobbyist Ron Fitzsimmons, executive director of the National Coalition of Abortion Providers (a trade association of abortion providers), told \"The New York Times\" (February 26, 1997): \"In the vast majority of cases, the procedure is performed on a healthy mother with a healthy fetus that is 20 weeks or more along.\"\nSome prominent opponents of abortion rights quickly defended the accuracy of Fitzsimmons's statements, whilst others condemned Fitzsimmons as self-serving.\nIn support of the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act, a nurse who witnessed three intact D&amp;E procedures found them deeply disturbing, and described one performed on a 26\u00bd-week fetus with Down syndrome in testimony before a Judiciary subcommittee of the U.S. House of Representatives.\nA journalist observed three intact and two non-intact D&amp;E procedures involving fetuses ranging from 19 to 23 weeks. She \"watched for any signs of fetal distress, but ... [she] could see no response, no reflexive spasm, nothing. Whether this was a result of the anesthesia or an undeveloped fetal system for pain sensitivity, one thing was clear: There was no discernible response by the fetus.\"\nAbortion provider Warren Hern asserted in 2003, \"No peer-reviewed articles or case reports have ever been published describing anything such as 'partial-birth' abortion, 'Intact D&amp;E' (for 'dilation and extraction'), or any of its synonyms.\" Therefore, Hern expressed uncertainty about what all of these terms mean. The U.S. Supreme Court held in \"Gonzales v. Carhart\" that these terms of the federal statute are not vague because the statute specifically detailed the procedure being banned: it specified anatomical landmarks past which the fetus must not be delivered, and criminalized such a procedure only if an \"overt\" fatal act is performed on the fetus after \"partial delivery.\"\nLegality in the United States.\nFederal law.\nSince 1995, led by Republicans in Congress, the U.S. House of Representatives and U.S. Senate have moved several times to pass measures banning the procedure. Congress passed two such measures by wide margins during Bill Clinton's presidency, but Clinton vetoed those bills in April 1996 and October 1997 on the grounds that they did not include health exceptions. Subsequent congressional attempts at overriding the veto were unsuccessful.\nA major part of the legal battle over banning the procedure relates to health exceptions, which would permit the procedure in special circumstances. The 1973 Supreme Court decision \"Roe v. Wade\", which declared many state-level abortion restrictions unconstitutional, allowed states to ban abortions of post-viable fetuses unless an abortion was \"necessary to preserve the life or health of the mother.\" The companion ruling, \"Doe v. Bolton\", upheld against a vagueness challenge a state law that defined health to include mental as well as physical health. The Court has never explicitly held, as a matter of constitutional law, that states have to allow abortions of post-viable fetuses if doing so is necessary for the woman's mental health, but many read \"Doe\" as implying as much. The concern that the health exception can be read so liberally partly explains why supporters of the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act did not want to include one.\nIn 2003, the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act (H.R. 760, S. 3) was signed into law; the House passed it on October 2 with a vote of 281\u2013142, the Senate passed it on October 21 with a vote of 64\u201334, and President George W. Bush signed it into law on November 5.\nBeginning in early 2004, the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, the National Abortion Federation, and abortion doctors in Nebraska challenged the ban in federal district courts in the Northern District of California, Southern District of New York, and District of Nebraska. All three district courts ruled the ban unconstitutional that same year. Their respective federal courts of appeals\u2014the Ninth Circuit, Second Circuit, and Eighth Circuit, respectively\u2014affirmed these rulings on appeal.\nThe three cases were all appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, and were consolidated into the case \"Gonzales v. Carhart\". On April 18, 2007, the Supreme Court voted to uphold the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act by a decision of 5\u20134. Justice Kennedy wrote for the majority and was joined by Justices Thomas, Scalia, Alito, and Chief Justice Roberts. A dissenting opinion was written by Justice Ginsburg and joined by Justices Stevens, Souter and Breyer.\nState law.\nMany states have bans on late-term abortions which apply to intact D&amp;E if it is performed after fetal viability.\nMany states have also passed bans specifically on intact D&amp;E. The first was Ohio, which in 1995 enacted a law that referred to the procedure as \"dilation and extraction\". In 1997, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit found the law unconstitutional on the grounds that it placed a substantial and unconstitutional obstacle in the path of women seeking pre-viability abortions in the second trimester.\nBetween 1995 and 2000, 28 more states passed Partial-Birth Abortion bans, all similar to the proposed federal bans and all lacking an exemption for the health of the woman. Many of these state laws faced legal challenges, with Nebraska's the first to reach decision in \"Stenberg v. Carhart\". The Federal District Court held Nebraska's statute unconstitutional on two counts. One being the bill's language was too broad, potentially rendering a range of abortion procedures illegal, and thus, creating an undue burden on a woman's ability to choose. The other count was the bill failed to provide a necessary exception for the health of the woman. The decision was appealed to and affirmed by both the Eighth Circuit and the Supreme Court in June 2000, thus resolving the legal challenges to similar state bans nationwide.\nSince the \"Stenberg v. Carhart\" decision, Virginia, Michigan, and Utah have adopted legislation very similar to the Nebraska law overturned as unconstitutional. The Michigan law was similarly struck down for broadness and failure to provide a health exemption. Utah's law remains on the books, pending trial, but is unenforceable under a court-ordered preliminary injunction. Virginia's Law was initially ruled invalid, but was reversed and remanded to the District Court in the wake of the \"Gonzales v. Carhart\" decision, where it was upheld as constitutional. This is despite the fact the Virginia law criminalizes abortions for accidental or intentional intact D&amp;E.\nIn 2000, Ohio introduced another \"partial-birth abortion\" ban. The law differed from previous attempts at the ban in that it specifically excluded D&amp;E procedures, while also providing a narrow health exception. This law was upheld on appeal to the Sixth Circuit in 2003 on the grounds that \"it permitted the partial birth procedure when necessary to prevent significant health risks.\"\nIn 2003, the Michigan Senate introduced Senate Bill No. 395, which would have changed the definition of birth and therefore effectively ban intact D&amp;E. The definition of birth as defined in the bill was that once any part of the body had passed beyond the introitus, it is considered a birth. The bill included an exemption for the mother's health. The bill was passed by both the Senate and House of Representatives but was vetoed by governor Jennifer Granholm.\nClinical response to legal bans on the procedure.\nSince the passage of the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act in the United States and similar state laws, providers of later abortions typically induce and document fetal death before beginning any later abortion procedure. Since the bans only apply to abortions of living fetuses, this protects the abortion providers from prosecution. The most common method of inducing fetal demise is to inject digoxin intrafetally or potassium chloride intrathoracically.\nIn other countries.\nQuestioned about the policy of the UK government on the issue in Parliament, Baroness Andrews stated that:\nWe are not aware of the procedure referred to as \"partial-birth abortion\" being used in Great Britain. It is the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists' (RCOG) belief that this method of abortion is never used as a primary or pro-active technique and is only ever likely to be performed in unforeseen circumstances in order to reduce maternal mortality or severe morbidity.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It can be considered a specific form of oligarchy (rule by the few) where the ruling few are wealthy. The first known use of the term in English dates from 1631. It is not rooted in any established political philosophy.\nUsage.\nThe term \"plutocracy\" is generally used as a pejorative to describe or warn against an undesirable condition. \"Dollarocracy\", an anglicised adaptation of the word \"plutocracy\", may refer to \"a specifically American version of plutocracy\".\nExamples.\nHistoric examples of plutocracies include the Roman Empire; some city-states in Ancient Greece; the civilization of Carthage; the Italian merchant city-states of Venice, Florence and Genoa; the Dutch Republic; and the pre-World War II Empire of Japan (the \"zaibatsu\"). According to Noam Chomsky and Jimmy Carter, the modern United States resembles a plutocracy though with democratic forms. In 2018, Paul Volcker, a former chair of the Federal Reserve, stated he also believed the U.S. to be developing into a plutocracy.\nOne modern, formal example of a plutocracy, according to some critics, is the City of London. The City (also called the Square Mile of ancient London, corresponding to the modern financial district, an area of about 2.5\u00a0km2) has a unique electoral system for its local administration, separate from the rest of London. More than two-thirds of voters are not residents, but rather representatives of businesses and other bodies that occupy premises in the City, with votes distributed according to their numbers of employees. The principal justification for this arrangement is that most of the services provided by the City of London Corporation are used by the businesses in the City. Around 450,000 non-residents constitute the City's day-time population, far outnumbering the City's 7,000 residents.\nIn the political jargon and propaganda of Fascist Italy, Nazi Germany and the Communist International, Western democratic states were referred to as plutocracies, with the implication being that a small number of extremely wealthy individuals were controlling the countries and holding them to ransom. Plutocracy replaced democracy and capitalism as the principal fascist term for the U.S. and Great Britain during World War II. In Nazi Germany, it was often used as a dog whistle term for Jewish people in their antisemitic propaganda. Joseph Goebbels, the Reich Minister of Propaganda, found the term to be particularly favorable, describing it as \"the main concept at which the ideological struggle will be aimed\".\nUnited States.\nSome modern historians, politicians, and economists argue that the U.S. was effectively plutocratic for at least part of the Gilded Age and Progressive Era periods between the end of the Civil War until the beginning of the Great Depression. President Theodore Roosevelt became known as the \"trust-buster\" for his aggressive use of antitrust law, through which he managed to break up such major combinations as the largest railroad and Standard Oil, the largest oil company. According to historian David Burton, \"When it came to domestic political concerns, TR's b\u00eate noire was the plutocracy.\" In his autobiographical account of taking on monopolistic corporations as president, Roosevelt recounted:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;...we had come to the stage where for our people what was needed was a real democracy; and of all forms of tyranny the least attractive and the most vulgar is the tyranny of mere wealth, the tyranny of a plutocracy.\nThe Sherman Antitrust Act had been enacted in 1890, when large industries reaching monopolistic or near-monopolistic levels of market concentration and financial capital increasingly integrating corporations and a handful of very wealthy heads of large corporations began to exert increasing influence over industry, public opinion and politics after the Civil War. Money, according to contemporary progressive and journalist Walter Weyl, was \"the mortar of this edifice\", with ideological differences among politicians fading and the political realm becoming \"\"a mere branch\" in a still larger, integrated business. The state, which through the party formally sold favors to the large corporations, became one of their departments.\"\nIn \"The Politics of Plutocracy\" section of his book, \"The Conscience of a Liberal\", economist Paul Krugman says plutocracy took hold because of three factors: at that time, the poorest quarter of American residents (African-Americans and non-naturalized immigrants) were ineligible to vote, the wealthy funded the campaigns of politicians they preferred, and vote buying was \"feasible, easy and widespread\", as were other forms of electoral fraud such as ballot-box stuffing and intimidation of the other party's voters.\nThe U.S. instituted progressive taxation in 1913, but according to Shamus Khan, in the 1970s, elites used their increasing political power to lower their taxes, and today successfully employ what political scientist Jeffrey Winters calls \"the income defense industry\" to greatly reduce their taxes.\nPost-World War II.\nIn modern times, the term is sometimes used pejoratively to refer to societies rooted in state-corporate capitalism or which prioritize the accumulation of wealth over other interests. According to Kevin Phillips, author and political strategist to Richard Nixon, the United States is a plutocracy in which there is a \"fusion of money and government.\"\nChrystia Freeland, author of \"Plutocrats\", says that the present trend towards plutocracy occurs because the rich feel that their interests are shared by society:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;You don't do this in a kind of chortling, smoking your cigar, conspiratorial thinking way. You do it by persuading yourself that what is in your own personal self-interest is in the interests of everybody else. So you persuade yourself that, actually, government services, things like spending on education, which is what created that social mobility in the first place, need to be cut so that the deficit will shrink, so that your tax bill doesn't go up. And what I really worry about is, there is so much money and so much power at the very top, and the gap between those people at the very top and everybody else is so great, that we are going to see social mobility choked off and society transformed.\nIn 1998, Bob Herbert of \"The New York Times\" referred to modern American plutocrats as \"The Donor Class\" (list of top (political party) donors) and defined the class, for the first time, as \"a tiny group \u2013 just one-quarter of 1 percent of the population \u2013 and it is not representative of the rest of the nation. But its money buys plenty of access.\"\nWhen the Nobel Prize\u2013winning economist Joseph Stiglitz wrote the 2011 \"Vanity Fair\" magazine article entitled \"Of the 1%, by the 1%, for the 1%\", the title and content supported Stiglitz's claim that the U.S. is increasingly ruled by the wealthiest 1%. Some researchers have said the U.S. may be drifting towards a form of oligarchy, as individual citizens have less impact than economic elites and organized interest groups upon public policy. In the U.S. Congress itself, more than half of all members are millionaires.\nA study conducted by political scientists Martin Gilens of Princeton University and Benjamin Page of Northwestern University, which was released in April 2014, stated that their \"analyses suggest that majorities of the American public actually have little influence over the policies our government adopts\". Gilens and Page do not characterize the U.S. as an \"oligarchy\" or \"plutocracy\" per se; however, they do apply the concept of \"civil oligarchy\" as used by Jeffrey A. Winters with respect to the U.S.\nThe investor, billionaire, and philanthropist Warren Buffett, one of the wealthiest people in the world, voiced in 2005 and once more in 2006 his view that his class, the \"rich class\", is waging class warfare on the rest of society. In 2005 Buffet said to CNN: \"It's class warfare, my class is winning, but they shouldn't be.\" In a November 2006 interview in \"The New York Times\", Buffett stated that \"[t]here's class warfare all right, but it's my class, the rich class, that's making war, and we're winning.\"\nCausation.\nIn a nation that is experiencing rapid economic growth, income inequality will tend to increase as the rate of return on innovation increases. In other scenarios, plutocracy may develop when a country is collapsing due to resource depletion as the elites attempt to hoard the diminishing wealth or expand debts to maintain stability, which will tend to enrich creditors and financiers.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "24562", "revid": "91088", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24562", "title": "Pareto principle", "text": "Statistical principle about ratio of effects to causes\nThe Pareto principle (also known as the 80/20 rule, the law of the vital few and the principle of factor sparsity) states that, for many outcomes, roughly 80% of consequences come from 20% of causes (the \"vital few\").\nIn 1941, management consultant Joseph M. Juran developed the concept in the context of quality control and improvement after reading the works of Italian sociologist and economist Vilfredo Pareto, who wrote in 1906 about the 80/20 connection while teaching at the University of Lausanne. In his first work, \"Cours d'\u00e9conomie politique\", Pareto showed that approximately 80% of the land in the Kingdom of Italy was owned by 20% of the population. The Pareto principle is only tangentially related to the Pareto efficiency.\nMathematically, the 80/20 rule is associated with a power law distribution (also known as a Pareto distribution) of wealth in a population. In many natural phenomena certain features are distributed according to power law statistics. It is an adage of business management that \"80% of sales come from 20% of clients.\"\nHistory.\nIn 1941, Joseph M. Juran, a Romanian-born American engineer, came across the work of Italian polymath Vilfredo Pareto. Pareto noted that approximately 80% of Italy's land was owned by 20% of the population. Juran applied the approximation that 80% of problems stem from 20% of the causes to the field of quality management. Later during his career, Juran preferred to describe this as \"the vital few and the useful many\" to highlight the contribution of the remaining 80% should not be devalued.\nMathematical explanation.\nThe demonstration of the Pareto principle is explained by a large proportion of process variation being associated with a small proportion of process variables. This is a special case of the wider phenomenon of Pareto distributions. If the Pareto index \u03b1, which is one of the parameters characterizing a Pareto distribution, is chosen as \u03b1 = log45 \u2248 1.16, then one has 80% of effects coming from 20% of causes.\nThe term 80/20 is only a shorthand for the general principle at work. In individual cases, the distribution could be nearer to 90/5 or 70/30. Note that there is no need for the two numbers to add up to the number 100, as they are measures of different things. The Pareto principle is an illustration of a \"power law\" relationship, which also occurs in phenomena such as bush fires and earthquakes. Benoit Mandelbrot offered an explanation for this pattern in the field of economics and social science based on income dynamics in population. According to his reasoning, above a certain minimum income threshold, the probability of an individual's income increasing or decreasing by a fixed proportion (e.g., doubling) remains constant across all income levels. As a consequence, the ratio of individuals earning a given income x to those earning half that amount x/2 remains the same, regardless of the absolute value of x. This scale-invariant property is a defining feature of power-law distributions. Because it is self-similar over a wide range of magnitudes, it produces outcomes completely different from Normal or Gaussian distribution phenomena. The occurrence probability of rare extreme (or catastrophic) events showing power-law distribution may be of several orders of magnitude greater than that associated with other usual models, such as, e.g., Gaussian or exponential. This fact explains the frequent breakdowns of sophisticated financial instruments, which are modeled on the assumption that a Gaussian relationship is appropriate to something like stock price movements. \nGini coefficient and Hoover index.\nUsing the \"\"A\":\"B\"\" notation (for example, 0.8:0.2) and with \"A\" + \"B\" = 1, inequality measures like the Gini index (G) \"and\" the Hoover index (H) can be computed. In this case both are the same:\n formula_1\n formula_2\nAnalysis.\nPareto analysis is a formal technique useful where many possible courses of action are competing for attention. In essence, the problem-solver estimates the benefit delivered by each action, then selects a number of the most effective actions that deliver a total benefit reasonably close to the maximal possible one.\nPareto analysis is a creative way of looking at causes of problems because it helps stimulate thinking and organize thoughts. However, it can be limited by its exclusion of possibly important problems which may be small initially, but will grow with time. It should be combined with other analytical tools such as failure mode and effects analysis and fault tree analysis for example.\nThis technique helps to identify the top portion of causes that need to be addressed to resolve the majority of problems. Once the predominant causes are identified, then tools like the Ishikawa diagram (also called Fish-bone Analysis) can be used to identify the root causes of the problems. While it is common to refer to pareto as \"80/20\" rule, under the assumption that, in all situations, 20% of causes determine 80% of problems, this ratio is merely a convenient rule of thumb and is not, nor should it be considered, an immutable law of nature.\nThe application of the Pareto analysis in risk management allows management to focus on those risks that have the most impact on the project.\nSteps to identify the important causes using 80/20 rule:\nApplications.\nEconomics.\nPareto's observation was in connection with population and wealth. Pareto noticed that approximately 80% of Italy's land was owned by 20% of the population. He then carried out surveys on a variety of other countries and found to his surprise that a similar distribution applied.\nA chart that demonstrated the effect appeared in the 1992 United Nations Development Program Report, which showed that the richest 20% of the world's population receives 82.7% of the world's income. However, among nations, the Gini index shows that wealth distributions vary substantially around this norm.\nThe principle also holds within the tails of the distribution. The physicist Victor Yakovenko of the University of Maryland, College Park and AC Silva analyzed income data from the US Internal Revenue Service from 1983 to 2001 and found that the income distribution of the richest 1\u20133% of the population also follows Pareto's principle.\nIn \"Talent: How to Identify Entrepreneurs\", economist Tyler Cowen and entrepreneur Daniel Gross suggest that the Pareto Principle can be applied to the role of the 20% most talented individuals in generating the majority of economic growth. A supermarket industry maxim states that 20% of products provide 80% of profits. According to the \"New York Times\" in 1988, many video rental shops reported that 80% of revenue came from 20% of videotapes (although rarely rented classics such as \"Gone with the Wind\" must be stocked to appear to have a good selection).\nComputing.\nIn computer science the Pareto principle can be applied to optimization efforts. For example, Microsoft noted that by fixing the top 20% of the most-reported bugs, 80% of the related errors and crashes in a given system would be eliminated. Lowell Arthur expressed that \"20% of the code has 80% of the errors. Find them, fix them!\"\nOccupational health and safety.\nOccupational health and safety professionals use the Pareto principle to underline the importance of hazard prioritization. Assuming 20% of the hazards account for 80% of the injuries, and by categorizing hazards, safety professionals can target those 20% of the hazards that cause 80% of the injuries or accidents. Alternatively, if hazards are addressed in random order, a safety professional is more likely to fix one of the 80% of hazards that account only for some fraction of the remaining 20% of injuries.\nAside from ensuring efficient accident prevention practices, the Pareto principle also ensures hazards are addressed in an economical order, because the technique ensures the utilized resources are best used to prevent the most accidents.\nEngineering and quality control.\nThe Pareto principle provides the basis for the Pareto chart, one of the key tools used in total quality control and Six Sigma techniques. The Pareto principle serves as a baseline for ABC-analysis and XYZ-analysis, widely used in logistics and procurement for the purpose of optimizing stock of goods, as well as costs of keeping and replenishing that stock. In engineering control theory, such as for electromechanical energy converters, the 80/20 principle applies to optimization efforts.\nThe remarkable success of statistically based searches for root causes is based upon a combination of an empirical principle and mathematical logic. The empirical principle is usually known as the Pareto principle. With regard to variation causality, this principle states that there is a non-random distribution of the slopes of the numerous (theoretically infinite) terms in the general equation.\nAll of the terms are independent of each other by definition. Interdependent factors appear as multiplication terms. The Pareto principle states that the effect of the dominant term is very much greater than the second-largest effect term, which in turn is very much greater than the third, and so on. There is no explanation for this phenomenon; that is why we refer to it as an empirical principle.\nThe mathematical logic is known as the square-root-of-the-sum-of-the-squares axiom. This states that the variation caused by the steepest slope must be squared, and then the result added to the square of the variation caused by the second-steepest slope, and so on. The total observed variation is then the square root of the total sum of the variation caused by individual slopes squared. This derives from the probability density function for multiple variables or the multivariate distribution (we are treating each term as an independent variable).\nThe combination of the Pareto principle and the square-root-of-the-sum-of-the-squares axiom means that the strongest term in the general equation totally dominates the observed variation of effect. Thus, the strongest term will dominate the data collected for hypothesis testing.\nIn the systems science discipline, Joshua M. Epstein and Robert Axtell created an agent-based simulation model called Sugarscape, from a decentralized modeling approach, based on individual behavior rules defined for each agent in the economy. Wealth distribution and Pareto's 80/20 principle emerged in their results, which suggests the principle is a collective consequence of these individual rules.\nHealth and social outcomes.\nIn 2009, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality said 20% of patients incurred 80% of healthcare expenses due to chronic conditions. A 2021 analysis showed unequal distribution of healthcare costs, with older patients and those with poorer health incurring more costs.\nThe 80/20 rule has been proposed as a rule of thumb for the infection distribution in superspreading events. However, the degree of infectiousness has been found to be distributed continuously in the population. In epidemics with super-spreading, the majority of individuals infect relatively few secondary contacts.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Particularly in the study of languages, a prefix is also called a preformative, because it alters the form of the word to which it is affixed.\nPrefixes, like other affixes, can be either inflectional, creating a new form of a word with the same basic meaning and same lexical category, or derivational, creating a new word with a new semantic meaning and sometimes also a different lexical category. Prefixes, like all affixes, are usually bound morphemes.\nEnglish has no inflectional prefixes, using only suffixes for that purpose. Adding a prefix to the beginning of an English word changes it to a different word. For example, when the prefix \"un-\" is added to the word \"happy\", it creates the word \"unhappy\". \nThe word \"prefix\" is itself made up of the stem \"fix\" (meaning \"attach\", in this case), and the prefix \"pre-\" (meaning \"before\"), both of which are derived from Latin roots.\nEnglish language.\nList of English derivational prefixes.\nThis is a fairly comprehensive, although not exhaustive, list of derivational prefixes in English. Depending on precisely how one defines a derivational prefix, some of the neoclassical combining forms may or may not qualify for inclusion in such a list. This list takes the broad view that \"acro-\" and \"auto-\" count as English derivational prefixes because they function the same way like that of prefixes such as \"over-\" and \"self-\" do.\nAs for numeral prefixes, only the most common members of that class are included here. There is a large separate table covering them all at Numeral prefix &gt; Table of number prefixes in English.\nHyphenation.\nThe choice between hyphenation or solid styling for prefixes in English is covered at Hyphen &gt; Prefixes and suffixes.\nJapanese language.\nCommonly used prefixes in Japanese include and . They are used as part of the honorific system of speech, and are used as markers for politeness, showing respect for the person or thing they are affixed to, notably also being used euphemistically.\nBantu languages.\nIn the Bantu languages of Africa, which are agglutinating, the noun class is conveyed through prefixes, which is declined and agrees with all of its arguments accordingly.\nExample from Luganda.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\nNavajo.\nVerbs in the Navajo language are formed from a word stem and multiple affixes. For example, each verb requires one of four non-syllabic prefixes (\u2205, \u0142, d, l) to create a verb theme.\nSunwar.\nIn the Sunwar language of Eastern Nepal, the prefix ma- \u092e is used to create negative verbs. It is the only verbal prefix in the language.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\nRussian.\nAs a part of the formation of nouns, prefixes are less common in Russian than suffixes, but alter the meaning of a word.\nGerman.\nIn German, derivatives formed with prefixes may be classified in two categories: those used with substantives and adjectives, and those used with verbs. For derivative substantives and adjectives, only two productive prefixes are generally addable to any substantive or adjective as of 1970: \"un-\", which expresses negation (as in \"ungesund\", from \"gesund\"), and \"ur-\", which means \"original, primitive\" in substantives, and has an emphatic function in adjectives. \"ge-\", on the other hand, expresses union or togetherness, but only in a closed group of words\u2014it cannot simply be added to any noun or adjective.\nVerbal prefixes commonly in use are \"be-\", \"ent-\", \"er-\", \"ge-\", \"miss-\", \"ver-\", and \"zer-\" (see also Separable verb). \"be-\" expresses strengthening or generalization. \"ent-\" expresses negation. \"ge-\" indicates the completion of an action, which is why its most common use has become the forming of the past participle of verbs; \"ver-\" has an emphatic function, or it is used to turn a substantive or an adjective into a verb. In some cases, the prefix particle \"ent-\" (negation) can be considered the opposite of particle \"be-\", while \"er-\" can be considered the opposite of \"ver-\".\nThe prefix \"er-\" usually indicates the successful completion of an action, and sometimes the conclusion means death. With fewer verbs, it indicates the beginning of an action. The prefix \"er-\" is also used to form verbs from adjectives (e.g. \"erkalten\" is equivalent to \"kalt werden\" which means \"to get cold\").\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He is thought to have been of Greek origin, and his name may indicate that he was a freed slave. He succeeded Pope Pontian, who had been deported from Rome to Sardinia, along with the antipope Hippolytus. He created one bishop, for the city of Fondi.\nSome scholars believe Anterus was martyred, because he ordered greater strictness in searching into the acts of the martyrs, exactly collected by the notaries appointed by Pope Clement I. Other scholars doubt this and believe it is more likely that he died in undramatic circumstances during the persecutions of Emperor Maximinus the Thracian.\nHe was buried in the papal crypt of the Catacomb of Callixtus, on the Appian Way in Rome. The site of his sepulchre was discovered by Giovanni Battista de Rossi in 1854, with some broken remnants of the Greek epitaph engraved on the narrow oblong slab that closed his tomb; only the Greek term for bishop was legible. His ashes had been removed to the Church of Saint Sylvester in the Campus Martius and were discovered on 17 November 1595, when Pope Clement VIII rebuilt that church.\nPope Anterus is remembered in the Catholic Church on 3 January and in the Russian Orthodox Church on 18 August.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
