A major figure of the New Hollywood era and pioneer of the modern blockbuster, Spielberg is widely regarded as one of the greatest and most influential filmmakers in the history of cinema and is the highest-grossing film director of all time. Among other accolades, he has received three Academy Awards, four Golden Globe Awards and three BAFTA Awards, as well as the AFI Life Achievement Award in 1995, an honorary knighthood in 2001, the Kennedy Center Honor in 2006, the Cecil B. DeMille Award in 2009, the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2015, and the National Medal of Arts in 2023. According to \"Forbes\", he is the wealthiest celebrity.\nSpielberg was born in Cincinnati, Ohio, and grew up in Phoenix, Arizona. He moved to California and studied film in college. After directing several episodes for television, including \"Night Gallery\" and \"Columbo\", he directed the television film \"Duel\" (1971), which was approved by Barry Diller. He made his theatrical debut with \"The Sugarland Express\" (1974), also beginning his decades-long collaboration with composer John Williams, with whom he has worked with for all but five of his theatrical releases. He became a household name with the summer blockbuster \"Jaws\" (1975), and continuously directed more acclaimed escapist box-office blockbusters with \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\" (1977), \"E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial\" (1982) and the original \"Indiana Jones\" trilogy (1981\u20131989). He also explored drama in \"The Color Purple\" (1985) and \"Empire of the Sun\" (1987).\nIn 1993, Spielberg directed back-to-back hits with the science fiction thriller \"Jurassic Park\", the highest-grossing film ever at the time, and the epic historical drama \"Schindler's List\", which has often been listed as one of the greatest films ever made. He won the Academy Award for Best Director for the latter as well as for the World War II epic \"Saving Private Ryan\" (1998). Spielberg has since directed the science fiction films \"A.I. Artificial Intelligence\" (2001), \"Minority Report\" (2002), \"War of the Worlds\" (2005) and \"Ready Player One\" (2018); the historical dramas \"Amistad\" (1997), \"Munich\" (2005), \"War Horse\" (2011), \"Lincoln\" (2012), \"Bridge of Spies\" (2015) and \"The Post\" (2017); the comedies \"Catch Me If You Can\" (2002) and \"The Terminal\" (2004); the animated film \"The Adventures of Tintin\" (2011); the musical \"West Side Story\" (2021); and the family drama \"The Fabelmans\" (2022).\nSpielberg co-founded Amblin Entertainment and DreamWorks Pictures, and he has served as a producer for many successful films and television series, among them \"Poltergeist\" (1982), \"Gremlins\" (1984), \"Back to the Future\" (1985), \"An American Tail\" (1986), \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\" (1988), \"Animaniacs\" (1993), \"Freakazoid!\" (1995), \"Twister\" (1996), \"Band of Brothers\" (2001) and \"Transformers\" (2007). Several of Spielberg's works are considered among the greatest films in history, and some are among the highest-grossing films ever.\nSeven of his films have been inducted into the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically or aesthetically significant\". In 2013, \"Time\" listed him as one of the 100 most influential people, and in 2023, Spielberg was the recipient of the first ever \"Time\" 100 Impact Award in the US.\nEarly life and background.\nSpielberg was born on December 18, 1946, in Cincinnati, Ohio. His mother, Leah Adler (n\u00e9e Posner), was a concert pianist and ran a kosher dairy restaurant, and his father, Arnold, was an electrical engineer involved in the development of computers. His immediate family were Reform Jewish/Orthodox Jewish. Spielberg's paternal grandparents were Jews from Ukraine; his grandmother Rebecca (n\u00e9e\u00a0Chechik), was from Sudylkiv, and his grandfather Shmuel Spielberg was from Kamianets-Podilskyi. Spielberg has three younger sisters: Anne, Sue, and Nancy. At their home in Cincinnati, his grandmother taught English to Holocaust survivors. They, in turn, taught him numbers: One man in particular, I kept looking at his numbers\u2013his number tattooed on his forearm ... he started \u2013 you know, when\u2013during the dinner break, when everybody was eating and not learning, he would point to the numbers. And he would say, that is a two, and that is a four. And then he'd say, and this is a eight, and that's a one. And I'll never forget this. And he said, and that's a nine. And then he crooked his arm and inverted his arm and said, and see, it becomes a six. It's magic. And now it's a nine, and now it's a six, and now it's a nine and now it's a six. And that's really how I learned my numbers for the first time ... the irony of all that, and the gift of that lesson, never really dawned on me until I was much older.\nIn 1952, his family moved to Haddon Township, New Jersey, after his father was hired by RCA. Spielberg attended Hebrew school from 1953 to 1957, in classes taught by Rabbi Albert L. Lewis. In early 1957, the family moved to Phoenix, Arizona. Spielberg had a bar mitzvah ceremony when he was thirteen. His family was involved in the synagogue and had many Jewish friends. Of the Holocaust, he said that his parents \"talked about it all the time, and so it was always on my mind\". His father had lost between sixteen and twenty relatives in the Holocaust. Spielberg found it difficult accepting his heritage; he said: \"It isn't something I enjoy admitting... but when I was seven, eight, nine years old, God forgive me, I was embarrassed because we were Orthodox Jews. I was embarrassed by the outward perception of my parents' Jewish practices. I was never really ashamed to be Jewish, but I was uneasy at times.\" Spielberg was the target of antisemitism: \"In high school, I got smacked and kicked around. Two bloody noses. It was horrible.\" He gradually followed Judaism less during adolescence, after his family had moved to various neighborhoods and found themselves to be the only Jews.\nSpielberg recalls his parents taking him to see Cecil B. DeMille's \"The Greatest Show on Earth\" (1952). He had never seen a movie before, and thought they were taking him to the circus. He was terrified by the movie's train crash, and at age 12, he recreated it with his Lionel trains and filmed it. He recalls: \"The trains went around and around, and after a while that got boring, and I had this eight-millimeter camera, and I staged a train wreck and filmed it. That was hard on the trains, but then I could cut the film lots of different ways and look at it over and over again.\" This was his first home movie. In 1958, he became a Boy Scout, eventually attaining the rank of Eagle Scout. He fulfilled a requirement for the photography merit badge by making a nine-minute 8\u00a0mm Western, \"The Last Gunfight\". Spielberg used his father's movie camera to make amateur features, and began taking the camera along on every Scout trip. At age 13, Spielberg made a 40-minute war film, \"Escape to Nowhere\", with a cast of classmates. The film won first prize in a statewide competition. Throughout his early teens, and after entering high school, Spielberg made about fifteen to twenty 8\u00a0mm adventure films. He recalls that my dad told me stories about World War II constantly... I knew, based on the stories my dad and his friends were telling about World War II, that there was no glory in war. And it was ugly, and it was cruel ... it was, you know, visually devastating. And so I thought, someday, if I ever do make a war movie for real, it's got to be something that tells the truth about what those experiences had been for those young 17-, 18-, 19-year-old boys storming Omaha Beach, let's say.\nIn Phoenix, Spielberg went to the local theater every Saturday. Formative films included Victor Fleming's \"Captains Courageous\" (1937), Walt Disney's \"Pinocchio\" and \"Fantasia\" (both 1940), Akira Kurosawa's \"Rashomon\" (1950) and \"The Seven Samurai\" (1954), Ishir\u014d Honda's \"Godzilla, King of the Monsters!\" (1956), David Lean's \"Bridge on the River Kwai\" (1957) and \"Lawrence of Arabia\" (1962) (\"the film that set me on my journey\"), Alfred Hitchcock's \"The Birds\" (1963) and Stanley Kubrick's \"Dr. Strangelove\" (1964) and \"\" (1968) (\"I'm still living off the adrenalin that... I experienced watching that film for the first time.\") He attended Arcadia High School in 1961 for three years. In 1963, he wrote and directed a 140-minute science fiction film, \"Firelight\", the basis of \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\". \"Firelight\", funded mainly by his father, was shown in a local theater for one evening and grossed $501 against its $500 budget.\nAfter taking a tour bus to Universal Studios, a chance conversation with an executive led to Spielberg getting a three-day pass to the premises. On the fourth day, he walked up to the studio gates without a pass, and the security guard waved him in: \"I basically spent the next two months at Universal Studios ... that was how I became an unofficial apprentice that summer.\" His family later moved to Saratoga, California, where he attended Saratoga High School. A year later, his parents divorced. Spielberg moved to Los Angeles to stay with his father, while his three sisters and mother remained in Saratoga. He recalls: My parents split up when I was 15 or 16 years old, and I needed a special friend, and had to use my imagination to take me to places that felt good \u2013 that helped me move beyond the problems my parents were having, and that ended our family as a whole. And thinking about that time, I thought, an extraterrestrial character would be the perfect springboard to purge the pain of your parents' splitting up. He recalls his mother had \"a huge adventurous personality. We always saw her as Peter Pan, the kid who never wanted to grow up, and she sort of saw herself that way. I think my mom lived a lot of childhoods in her ninety-seven years.\" He was not interested in academics, aspiring only to be a filmmaker. He applied to the University of Southern California's film school but was turned down because of his mediocre grades. He then applied and enrolled at California State University, Long Beach, where he became a brother of Theta Chi fraternity. In 1968, Universal gave Spielberg the opportunity to write and direct a short film for theatrical release, the 26-minute 35\u00a0mm \"Amblin\"'. Studio vice president Sidney Sheinberg was impressed and offered Spielberg a seven-year directing contract. A year later, he dropped out of college to begin directing television productions for Universal, making him the youngest director to be signed to a long-term plan with a major Hollywood studio. Spielberg returned to Long Beach in 2002, where he presented \"Schindler's List\" to complete his Bachelor of Arts in Film and Electronic Media.\nHe recalls a formative encounter with one of his favorite filmmakers, John Ford, who said: \"So they tell me you want to be a picture maker. You see those paintings around the office?\" Spielberg said he did. John Ford pointed to a painting and asked, \"Where's the horizon?\" Spielberg said it was at the top. Ford asked him where it was in another painting. Spielberg said it was at the bottom. Ford said, \"When you're able to distinguish the art of the horizon at the bottom of a frame or at the top of the frame, but not going right through the center of the frame, when you can appreciate why it's at the top and why it's at the bottom, you might make a pretty good picture maker.\"\nCareer.\n1969\u20131974: Television work and film debut.\nSpielberg made his professional debut with \"Eyes\", a segment of \"Night Gallery\" (1969) scripted by Rod Serling and starring Joan Crawford. Initially, there was skepticism from Crawford and studio executives regarding Spielberg's inexperience. Despite Spielberg's efforts to implement advanced camerawork techniques, studio executives demanded a more straightforward approach. His initial contributions received mixed responses, leading Spielberg to briefly step back from studio work. Crawford, reflecting on her collaboration with Spielberg, recognized his potential, noting his unique intuitive inspiration. She expressed her appreciation for Spielberg's talent in a note to him and also communicated her approval to Serling. Crawford's endorsement highlighted Spielberg's early recognition in Hollywood despite initial hesitations regarding his experience.\nIn the early 1970s, Spielberg unsuccessfully tried to raise financing for his own low-budget films. He co-wrote and directed teleplays for \"Marcus Welby, M.D.\", \"The Name of the Game\", \"Columbo, Owen Marshall, Counselor at Law\" and \"The Psychiatrist.\" The \"Columbo\" episode he would direct would be the show's inaugural, non-pilot episode \"Murder by the Book\". Although unsatisfied with his work, Spielberg used the opportunity to experiment with his techniques and learn about filmmaking. He earned good reviews and impressed producers; he was earning a steady income and relocated to Laurel Canyon, Los Angeles.\"\"\nImpressed, Universal signed Spielberg to do four television films. The first was \"Duel\" (1971), adapted from Richard Matheson's short story of the same name, about a salesman (Dennis Weaver) being chased down a highway by a psychotic tanker truck driver. Executives decided to promote the film on television from its quality. Reviews were positive, and Universal asked Spielberg to shoot more scenes so that \"Duel\" could be released theatrically to international markets.\"\" \"Deservedly so\" writes David Thomson, \"for it stands up as one of the medium's most compelling spirals of suspense. The ordinariness of the Dennis Weaver character and the monstrous malignance of the truck confront one another with a narrative assurance that never needs to remind us of the element of fable.\" \"Duel\", which would mark Spielberg's debut as a film director, would first air on Barry Diller's ABC Movie of the Week before having an international theatrical release as well. More TV films followed: \"Something Evil\" (1972), which aired on CBS, and \"Savage\" (1973), which aired on NBC; however, unlike \"Duel\", neither of these two films would manage to also have a theatrical run.\nSpielberg made his official theatrical debut with \"The Sugarland Express\" (1974), based on a true story about a married couple on the run, desperate to regain custody of their baby from foster parents.\"\" The film starred Goldie Hawn and William Atherton and marked the first of many collaborations with the composer John Williams. Although the film was awarded Best Screenplay at the 1974 Cannes Film Festival, it was not a commercial success, which Spielberg blamed on Universal's inconsistent marketing. The film opened in four hundred theaters in the US to positive reviews; Pauline Kael wrote \"Spielberg uses his gifts in a very free-and-easy, American way\u2014for humor, and for a physical response to action. He could be that rarity among directors, a born entertainer\u2014perhaps a new generation's Howard Hawks.\" \"The Hollywood Reporter\" wrote that \"a major new director is on the horizon\".\n1975\u20131980: Stardom with blockbuster films.\nProducers Richard D. Zanuck and David Brown took a chance with Spielberg, giving him the opportunity to direct \"Jaws\" (1975), a thriller based on Peter Benchley's bestseller. In it, a great white shark attacks beachgoers at a summer resort town, prompting police chief Martin Brody (Roy Scheider) to hunt it down with the help of a marine biologist (Richard Dreyfuss) and a veteran shark hunter (Robert Shaw). \"Jaws\" was the first movie shot on open ocean, so shooting proved difficult, especially when the mechanical shark malfunctioned. The shooting schedule overran by a hundred days, and Universal threatened to cancel production. Against expectations, \"Jaws\" was a success, setting the domestic box-office record and making Spielberg a household name. It won Academy Awards for Best Film Editing (Verna Fields), Best Original Dramatic Score (John Williams) and Best Sound (Robert Hoyt, Roger Heman, Earl Madery and John Carter). Spielberg said the malfunctioning of the mechanical shark resulted in a better movie, as he had to find other ways to suggest the shark's presence. After seeing the unconventional camera techniques of \"Jaws\", Alfred Hitchcock praised \"young Spielberg\" for thinking outside the visual dynamics of the theater: \"He's the first one of us who doesn't see the proscenium arch\".\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n Like Coppola on \"The Godfather\", Spielberg asserted his own role and deftly organized the elements into a roller coaster entertainment without sacrificing inner meanings. The suspense of the picture came from meticulous technique and good humor about its own surgical cutting. You have only to submit to the travesty of \"Jaws 2\" to realize how much more engagingly Spielberg saw the ocean, the perils, the sinister beauty of the shark, and the vitality of its human opponents.\n \u2014 Critic David Thompson\nAfter declining an offer to make \"Jaws 2\", Spielberg and Dreyfuss reunited to work on a film about UFOs, \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\" (1977). Spielberg used 65 mm film for the best picture quality, and a new live-action recording system so that the recordings could be duplicated later. He cast one of his favorite directors, Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut, as the scientist Claude Lacombe and worked with special effects expert Douglas Trumbull. It marked the first of many collaborations between Spielberg and editor Michael Kahn. One of the rare films both written and directed by Spielberg, \"Close Encounters\" was very popular with filmgoers\"\" and won Academy Awards for Best Cinematography (Vilmos Zsigmond) and Best Sound Effects Editing (Frank Warner). Stanley Kauffmann wrote: \"I saw \"Close Encounters\" at its first public showing in New York, and most of the audience stayed on and on to watch the credits crawl lengthily at the end. For one thing, under the credits the giant spaceship was returning to the stars. For another, they just didn't want to leave this picture. For still another, they seemed to understand the importance of those many names to what they had just seen.\" Kauffmann placed it first on his list of the best American films from 1968 to 1977. Reviewing \"Close Encounters\", Kael called Spielberg \"a magician in the age of movies\".\nHis next directorial work was \"1941\" (1979), an action-comedy written by Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale about Californians preparing for a Japanese invasion after the attack on Pearl Harbor. Spielberg was self-conscious about doing comedy as he had no prior experience in the genre. Universal and Columbia agreed to co-finance the film. \"1941\" grossed more than $92.4\u00a0million worldwide upon release, but most critics, and the studio heads, disliked it. Charles Champlin described \"1941\" as \"the most conspicuous waste since the last major oil spill, which it somewhat resembles\".\n1981\u20131992: Established filmmaker.\nSpielberg directed \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" (1981), with a screenplay by Lawrence Kasdan based on a story by George Lucas and Philip Kaufman. They considered it an homage to the serials of the 1930s and 1940s.\" It starred Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones and Karen Allen as Marion Ravenwood. Filmed in La Rochelle, Hawaii, Tunisia and Elstree Studios, England, the shoot was difficult but Spielberg said that it helped him hone his business acumen. The film was a box-office success and won Academy Awards for Best Art Direction (Norman Reynolds, Leslie Dilley and Michael D. Ford); Best Film Editing (Michael Kahn); Best Sound (Bill Varney, Steve Maslow, Gregg Landaker and Roy Charman); Best Sound Editing (Ben Burtt and Richard L. Anderson); and Best Visual Effects (Richard Edlund, Kit West, Bruce Nicholson and Joe Johnston). Roger Ebert wrote: \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" is an out-of-body experience, a movie of glorious imagination and breakneck speed that grabs you in the first shot, hurtles you through a series of incredible adventures, and deposits you back in reality two hours later\u2013breathless, dizzy, wrung-out, and with a silly grin on your face\". \"Raiders\" was the first film in the \"Indiana Jones\" franchise.\nSpielberg returned to science fiction with \"E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial\" (1982). It tells the story of Elliot (Henry Thomas), a young boy who befriends an alien who was accidentally left behind by his companions and is attempting to return home. Spielberg eschewed storyboards so that his direction would be more spontaneous, and shot roughly in sequence so that the actors' performances would be authentic as they bonded with and said goodbye to E.T. Richard Corliss wrote, \"This was the closing-night attraction at the 1982 Cannes Film Festival, a venue not known for blubbering sentiment. At the end, as the little critter bade his farewells and the Jules Verne-like space ship left the ground, the audience similarly levitated. One heard the audience's childlike applause; one felt their spirits lift. This was rapture made audible, palpable ... Spielberg orchestrated the movements of the camera and the puppet spaceman with the feelings of\u2014it has to be called love\u2014expressed in young Henry Thomas' yearning face. E.T. was the first film character to be a finalist in TIME's Man of the Year sweepstakes. It would have been fine with me if the little creature, this lovely film, had won.\"\nA special screening was organized for Ronald and Nancy Reagan, who were emotional by the end. \"E.T.\" grossed $700 million worldwide. It won four Academy Awards: Best Original Score (John Williams), Best Sound (Robert Knudson, Robert Glass, Don Digirolamo and Gene Cantamessa), Best Sound Editing (Charles L. Campbell and Ben Burtt) and Best Visual Effects (Carlo Rambaldi, Dennis Muren and Kenneth F. Smith). Kael wrote of E.T., \"His voice is ancient and otherworldly but friendly, humorous. And this scaly, wrinkled little man with huge, wide-apart, soulful eyes and a jack-in-the-box neck has been so fully created that he's a friend to us, too; when he speaks of his longing to go home the audience becomes as mournful as Elliot. Spielberg has earned the tears that some people in the audience\u2014and not just children\u2014shed. Genuinely entrancing movies are almost as rare as extraterrestrial visitors.\" Spielberg co-wrote and produced \"Poltergeist\" (Tobe Hooper, 1982), released the same summer as \"E.T.\" With John Landis, he co-produced the anthology film \"\" (1983), contributing the \"Kick the Can\" segment.\nHis next feature film was the \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" prequel \"Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom\" (1984). Working again with Lucas and Ford, the film was shot in the United States, Sri Lanka and China. The film was darker than its predecessor, and led to the creation of the PG-13 rating because some content was deemed unsuitable for children under 13. Spielberg later said that he was unhappy with \"Temple of Doom\" because it lacked his \"personal touches and love\". Nonetheless, the film was a blockbuster hit, won the Academy Award for Best Special Effects and received mostly good reviews. Kael preferred it to the original, writing, \"Spielberg is like a magician whose tricks are so daring they make you laugh. He creates an atmosphere of happy disbelief: the more breathtaking and exhilarating the stunts are the funnier they are. Nobody has ever fused thrills and laughter in quite the way that he does here. He starts off at full charge in the opening sequence and just keeps going\". She conceded that it was less \"sincere\" than \"Raiders\", adding \"that's what is so good about it.\" On this project Spielberg met his future wife, Kate Capshaw, who played Willie Scott. Spielberg recalled, \"The second film I could have done a lot better if there had been a different story. It was a good learning exercise for me to really throw myself into a black hole. I came out of the darkness of \"Temple Of Doom\" and I entered the light of the woman I was eventually going to marry and raise a family with.\"\nThomson writes that \"At first sight, the Spielberg of the eighties may seem more an impresario\u2014or a studio, even\u2014then a director.\" Between 1984 and 1990, Spielberg served as producer or executive producer on nineteen feature films for his production company, Amblin Entertainment. Among them were \"Gremlins\" (Joe Dante, 1984), \"The Goonies\" (Richard Donner, 1985), \"Back to the Future\" (Robert Zemeckis, 1985), \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\" (Zemeckis, 1988), \"Joe Versus the Volcano\" (John Patrick Shanley, 1990) and \"Arachnophobia\" (Frank Marshall, 1990).\"\" In the early 1980s, Spielberg befriended Warner Communications CEO Steve Ross eventually resulting in Spielberg making films for Warner Bros. It began with \"The Color Purple\" (1985), an adaptation of Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, about a generation of empowered African-American women in the depression-era South. It was Spielberg's first film on a dramatic subject matter, and he expressed reservations about tackling the project: \"It's the risk of being judged-and accused of not having the sensibility to do character studies.\" Starring Whoopi Goldberg and Oprah Winfrey, the film was a box-office hit and critics started to take note of Spielberg's foray into drama. Ebert named it the best film of the year. The film also received eleven Academy Award nominations, and Spielberg won Best Director from the Directors Guild of America. The film was produced and scored by Quincy Jones.\nAs China underwent economic reform and opened up to the American film industry, Spielberg made \"Empire of the Sun\" (1987), the first American film shot in Shanghai since the 1930s. It is an adaptation of J. G. Ballard's autobiographical novel about Jamie Graham (Christian Bale), a young boy who goes from being the son of a wealthy British family in Shanghai to a prisoner of war in a Japanese internment camp during World War II. David Lean was originally set to direct, with Spielberg producing. It was written by playwright Tom Stoppard and co-starred John Malkovich as an American expatriate. Critical reaction was mixed at the time of release; criticism ranged from the \"overwrought\" plot to Spielberg's downplaying of \"disease and starvation\". However, Andrew Sarris named it the best film of the year and later included it among the best of the decade. The film was nominated for six Academy Awards, but was a disappointment at the box office; Ian Alterman of \"The New York Times\" thought it was overlooked by audiences. Spielberg recalled that \"Empire of the Sun\" was one of his most enjoyable films to make. Thomson called it \"a great work through and through\" and \"the first clear sign that Spielberg the showman was an artist, too.\"\nIn 1989, Spielberg intended to direct \"Rain Man\", but instead directed \"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade\" to meet his contractual obligations. Producer Lucas and star Ford returned for the film. A longtime James Bond fan, Spielberg cast Sean Connery as Jones's father, Henry Jones, Sr. Due to complaints about violence in \"Temple of Doom\", Spielberg returned to more family-friendly fare for the third installment. \"Last Crusade\" received mostly positive reviews and was a box-office success, earning $474 million; it was his biggest hit since \"E.T.\" Biographer Joseph McBride wrote that it was a comeback for Spielberg, and Spielberg acknowledged the amount he has learned from making the \"Indiana Jones\" series. Ebert wrote that, \"If there is just a shade of disappointment after seeing this movie, it has to be because we will never again have the shock of this material seeming new. \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\", now more than ever, seems a turning point in the cinema of escapist entertainment, and there was really no way Spielberg could make it new all over again. What he has done is to take many of the same elements, and apply all of his craft and sense of fun to make them work yet once again. And they do.\"\nAlso in 1989, he reunited with Richard Dreyfuss for the romantic drama \"Always\", about an aerial firefighter. It is a modern remake of one of Spielberg's favorite childhood films, \"A Guy Named Joe\" (1943). The story was personal; he said \"As a child I was very frustrated, and maybe I saw my own parents [in \"A Guy Named Joe\"]. I was also short of girlfriends. And it stuck with me.\"\"\" Spielberg had discussed the film with Dreyfuss back in 1975, with up to twelve drafts being written before filming commenced. \"Always\" was commercially unsuccessful and received mixed reviews. Janet Maslin of \"The\" \"New York Times\" wrote, \"\"Always\" is filled with big, sentimental moments, it lacks the intimacy to make any of this very moving.\"\nAfter a brief setback in which Spielberg felt \"artistically stalled\", he returned in 1991 with \"Hook\", about a middle-aged Peter Pan (Robin Williams), who returns to Neverland and encounters Tinker Bell (Julia Roberts) and the eponymous Captain Hook (Dustin Hoffman). During filming, the stars clashed on set; Spielberg told \"60 Minutes\" that he would never work with Roberts again. Nominated for five Academy Awards, the studio enjoyed the film but most critics did not; Thomson called it \"maudlin\". Writing for \"The Washington Post\", Desson Howe described the film as \"too industrially organized\", and thought it mundane. At the box office, it earned more than $300\u00a0million worldwide from a $70\u00a0million budget.\n1993\u20131998: Transition to dramatic works.\nIn 1993, Spielberg returned to the adventure genre with \"Jurassic Park\", based on Michael Crichton's bestseller, with a screenplay by Crichton and David Koepp. \"Jurassic Park\" is set on a fictional island near Costa Rica, where a businessman (Richard Attenborough) has hired a team of geneticists to create a wildlife park of de-extinct dinosaurs. In a departure from his usual order of planning, Spielberg and the designers storyboarded certain sequences from the novel early on. The film also used computer-generated imagery provided by Industrial Light &amp; Magic; \"Jurassic Park\" was completed on time and became the highest-grossing film at the time, and won three Academy Awards.\nAlso in 1993, Spielberg directed \"Schindler's List\", about Oskar Schindler, a businessman who helped save 1,100 Jews from the Holocaust. Based on \"Schindler's Ark\", Spielberg waited ten years to make the film as he did not feel \"mature\" enough. He wanted to embrace his heritage, and after the birth of his son, Max, he said that \"it greatly affected me [...] A spirit began to ignite in me, and I became a Jewish dad\". Filming commenced on March 1, 1993, in Poland, while Spielberg was still editing \"Jurassic Park\" in the evenings. To make filming \"bearable\", Spielberg brought his wife and children with him. Against expectations, the film was a commercial success, and Spielberg used his percentage of profits to start the Shoah Foundation, a non-profit organization that archives testimonies of Holocaust survivors. \"Schindler's List\" won seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Spielberg's first as Best Director. It also won seven BAFTAs, and three Golden Globes. \"Schindler's List\" is one of the AFI's 100 best American films ever made.\nEbert wrote, \"Flaubert once wrote that he disliked \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" because the author was constantly preaching against slavery. 'Does one have to make observations about slavery?' he asked. 'Depict it; that's enough.' And then he added, 'An author in his book must be like God in the universe, present everywhere and visible nowhere.' That would describe Spielberg, the author of this film. He depicts the evil of the Holocaust, and he tells an incredible story of how it was robbed of some of its intended victims. He does so without the tricks of his trade, the directorial and dramatic contrivances that would inspire the usual melodramatic payoffs. Spielberg is not visible in this film. But his restraint and passion are present in every shot.\" Filmmaker Claude Lanzmann, criticized the film for its weak representation of the Holocaust. Imre Kert\u00e9sz, a Hungarian author and concentration camp survivor, also disliked the film, saying, \"I regard as kitsch any representation of the Holocaust that is incapable of understanding or unwilling to understand the organic connection between our own deformed mode of life and the very possibility of the Holocaust.\" Thomson calls it \"the most moving film I have ever seen.\"\nIn 1994, Spielberg took a break from directing to spend more time with his family, and set up his new film studio, DreamWorks, with Jeffrey Katzenberg and David Geffen. After his hiatus, he returned to directing with a sequel to \"Jurassic Park\", \"\" (1997). A loose adaptation of Michael Crichton's novel \"The Lost World\", the plot follows mathematician Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) and his researchers who study dinosaurs at Jurassic Park which is on an island and are confronted by another team with a different agenda. Spielberg wanted the onscreen creatures to be more realistic than in the first film; he used 3D storyboards, computer imagery and robotic puppets. Budgeted at $73 million, \"The Lost World: Jurassic Park\" opened in May 1997 and was one of the highest grossing films of the year. The \"J. Hoberman\" critic opined that \"The Lost World\" was \"better crafted but less fun\" than the first film, while \"The Guardian\" wrote \"It looks like a director on autopilot [...] The special effects brook no argument.\"\n\"Amistad\" (1997), his first film released under DreamWorks, was based on the true story of the events in 1839 aboard the slave ship \"La Amistad\". Producer Debbie Allen, who had read the book \"Amistad I\" in 1978, thought Spielberg would be perfect to direct. Spielberg was hesitant taking on the project, afraid that it would be compared to \"Schindler's List\", but he said, \"I've never planned my career [...] In the end I do what I think I gotta do.\" Starring Morgan Freeman, Anthony Hopkins, Djimon Hounsou and Matthew McConaughey, Spielberg used Allen's ten years worth of research to reenact the difficult historical scenes. The film struggled to find an audience, and underperformed at the box office; Spielberg admitted that \"Amistad\" \"became too much of a history lesson\".\nSpielberg's 1998 release was World War II epic \"Saving Private Ryan\", about a group of US soldiers led by Captain Miller (Tom Hanks) sent to bring home a paratrooper whose three older brothers were killed in the same twenty-four hours of the Normandy landing. Filming took place in England, and US Marine Dale Dye was hired to train the actors and keep them in character during the combat scenes. Halfway through filming, Spielberg reminded the cast that they were making a tribute to thank \"your grandparents and my dad, who fought in [the war]\". Upon release, critics praised the direction and its realistic portrayal of war. The film grossed a successful $481\u00a0million worldwide and Spielberg won a second Academy Award for Best Director. In August 1999, Spielberg and Hanks were awarded the Distinguished Public Service Medal from Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen. Thomson writes \"\"Ryan\" changed war films: combat, shock, wounds, and fear had never been so graphically presented; and yet there was also a true sense of what duties and ideas had felt like in 1944. I disliked the framing device. I would have admired a director who trusted us to get there without that. Never mind\u2014\"Ryan\" is a magnificent film.\" Ebert wrote \"Spielberg knows how to make audiences weep better than any director since Chaplin in \"City Lights.\" But weeping is an incomplete response, letting the audience off the hook. This film embodies ideas. After the immediate experience begins to fade, the implications remain and grow.\"\n2001\u20132012: Experimentations with technology.\nSpielberg returned to science fiction with \"A.I. Artificial Intelligence\" (2001), a loose adaptation of Brian Aldiss's short story \"Supertoys Last All Summer Long\" (1969). Stanley Kubrick had bought the rights to the story in 1979 and worked on an adaptation for years. He told Spielberg about the project in 1984 and suggested that he direct, believing the story was closer to Spielberg's sensibilities. In 1999, Kubrick died. Spielberg decided to direct \"A.I.\" and wrote the screenplay himself. Spielberg tried to be faithful to Kubrick's vision and made several allusions to his friend's work though with mixed results according to some critics. The plot revolves around an android, David (Haley Joel Osment) who, like Pinocchio, dreams of being a \"real boy\". The film won five Saturn Awards and grossed $236\u00a0million worldwide. Jonathan Rosenbaum highly praised the film: \"If \"A.I. Artificial Intelligence\" \u2014 a film whose split personality is apparent even in its two-part title \u2014 is as much a Kubrick movie as a Spielberg one, this is in large part because it defamiliarizes Spielberg, makes him strange. Yet it also defamiliarizes Kubrick, with equally ambiguous results \u2014 making his unfamiliarity familiar. Both filmmakers should be credited for the results\u2014Kubrick for proposing that Spielberg direct the project and Spielberg for doing his utmost to respect Kubrick's intentions while making it a profoundly personal work.\" A. O. Scott called it \"the best fairy tale\u2013the most disturbing, complex and intellectually challenging boy's adventure story\u2013Mr. Spielberg has made\" and chose it as the best film of the year and one of the best of the decade.\nSpielberg followed \"A.I.\" with the sci-fi neo-noir \"Minority Report\" (2002), based on Philip K. Dick's short story (1956). The film stars Tom Cruise as commanding officer of precrime in futuristic Washington, D.C. Ebert named \"Minority Report\" the best film of 2002, praising its craftsmanship: \"here is Spielberg using every trick in the book and matching them without seams, so that no matter how he's achieving his effects, the focus is always on the story and the characters ... Some directors place their trust in technology. Spielberg, who is a master of technology, trusts only story and character, and then uses everything else as a workman uses his tools.\" However, critic Todd McCarthy thought there was not enough action. The film earned more than $358\u00a0million worldwide. Also in 2002, he released \"Catch Me If You Can\", based on the autobiography of con-artist Frank Abagnale. Leonardo DiCaprio played Abagnale; Christopher Walken and Hanks also starred. Spielberg said, \"I have always loved movies about sensational rogues\u2014they break the law, but you just have to love them for the moxie.\" The film was a critical and commercial success.\nSpielberg followed \"Catch Me If You Can\" with \"The Terminal\" (2004), a comedy loosely inspired by the true story of Mehran Karimi Nasseri and by Jacques Tati's \"Playtime\" (1967). The film follows Viktor Navorski (Hanks), an Eastern European man who, after a coup in his home country, is stranded in John F. Kennedy International Airport. It features Catherine Zeta-Jones as a flight attendant and Stanley Tucci as a customs and immigration official. Ebert wrote of Viktor's predicament: \"The immigration service, and indeed the American legal system, has no way of dealing with him because Viktor does not do, or fail to do, any of the things the system is set up to prevent him from doing, or not doing. He has slipped through a perfect logical loophole. \"The Terminal\" is like a sunny Kakfa story, in which it is the citizen who persecutes the bureaucracy.\" The titular terminal was a real set built by Alex McDowell. In 2005, Spielberg directed \"War of the Worlds,\" a co-production of Paramount and DreamWorks, based on H. G. Wells's novel; Spielberg had been a fan of the book and of George Pal's 1953 film. Starring Tom Cruise and Dakota Fanning, the film is about an American dock worker who is forced to look after his children, from whom he lives separately, as he tries to protect and reunite them with their mother when extraterrestrials invade Earth. Spielberg used storyboards to help the actors react to computer imagery that they could not see and used natural lighting and camerawork to avoid an \"over stylized\" science fiction picture. The film was a box-office hit grossing more than $600\u00a0million worldwide.\nSpielberg's \"Munich\" (2005) is about the Israeli government's secret retaliation after eleven Israeli Olympic athletes were kidnapped and murdered in the 1972 Munich massacre. The film is based on \"Vengeance\", a book by Canadian journalist George Jonas. It was previously adapted for the screen in the 1986 television film \"Sword of Gideon\". Spielberg, who personally remembers the incident, sought advice from former president Bill Clinton, among others, before making the film because he did not want to cause further problems in the Middle East. Although the film garnered mostly positive reviews, some critics perceived it as antisemitic; it is one of Spielberg's most controversial films to date. \"Munich\" received five Academy Awards nominations: Best Picture, Best Film Editing, Best Score, Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Director for Spielberg. It was his sixth Best Director nomination, and fifth Best Picture nomination.\nIn the mid-2000s, Spielberg scaled down his directing career and became more selective about film projects to undertake. In December 2005, he and his partners sold DreamWorks to media conglomerate Viacom (now known as Paramount Global). The sale was finalized in February 2006. In June 2006, Spielberg planned to make \"Interstellar\", but abandoned the project, which was eventually directed by Christopher Nolan. During this period, Spielberg remained active as a producer. Spielberg returned to the \"Indiana Jones\" series in 2008 with \"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.\" Released nineteen years after \"Last Crusade\", the film is set in 1957, pitting Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) against Soviet agents led by Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchett), searching for a telepathic crystal skull. Principal photography was complete in October 2007, and the film was released on May 22, 2008. This was his first film not released by DreamWorks since 1997. The film received generally favorable reviews from critics, but some fans were disappointed by the introduction of science fiction elements which were uncharacteristic of the previous films. Writing for \"The Age\", Tom Ryan praised Spielberg and Lucas for their realistic 1950s setting\u2014\"The energy on display is impressive\". It was a box-office success, grossing $790\u00a0million worldwide.\nStarting in 2009, Spielberg shot the first film in a planned trilogy of motion capture films based on Herg\u00e9's \"The Adventures of Tintin\". Spielberg had long been a fan of the comics, and per Michael Farr, Herg\u00e9 \"thought Spielberg was the only person who could ever do Tintin justice.\" \"The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn\" was co-produced by Peter Jackson and premiered in Brussels, Belgium. The film was released in North American theaters on December 21, 2011, in Digital 3D and IMAX. It received generally positive reviews from critics and grossed over $373\u00a0million worldwide. \"The Adventures of Tintin\" won Best Animated Feature at the 69th Golden Globe Awards. Spielberg followed \"Tintin\" with \"War Horse\", shot in England in the summer of 2010. It was released four days after \"Tintin\", on December 25, 2011. The film, based on Michael Morpurgo's 1982 novel, follows the long friendship between a British boy and his horse Joey before and during World War I. Distributed by Walt Disney Studios with whom DreamWorks made a distribution deal in 2009, \"War Horse\" was the first of four consecutive Spielberg films released by Disney. It received acclaim from critics and was nominated for six Academy Awards, including Best Picture. In a review for \"Salon\" magazine, Andrew O'Hehir wrote, \"at this point in his career Spielberg is pursuing personal goals, and everything that's terrific and overly flat and tooth-rottingly sweet about \"War Horse\" reflects that.\"\nSpielberg directed the historical drama \"Lincoln\" (2012), starring Daniel Day-Lewis as President Abraham Lincoln and Sally Field as Mary Todd Lincoln. Based on Doris Kearns Goodwin's book \"\" and written by Tony Kushner, the film depicts the final four months of Lincoln's life. The film was shot in Richmond, Virginia in late 2011. and was released in the US in November 2012. \"Lincoln\" was acclaimed and earned more than $250 million worldwide. It was nominated for twelve Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director, winning Best Production Design and Best Actor for Day-Lewis's performance. Donald Clarke from \"The Irish Times\" praised the direction: \"Against the odds, Spielberg makes something genuinely exciting of the backstage wheedling.\"\n2013\u2013present: Recent work.\nIt was announced on May 2, 2013, that Spielberg would direct \"American Sniper,\" but he left the project before production began. Instead, he directed \"Bridge of Spies\" (2015), a Cold War thriller based on the 1960 U-2 incident, and focusing on James B. Donovan's negotiations with the Soviets for the release of pilot Gary Powers after his aircraft was shot down over Soviet territory. It was written by Matt Charman and the Coen brothers, and starred Tom Hanks as Donovan, as well as Mark Rylance, Amy Ryan and Alan Alda. It was filmed in the fall of 2014 in New York City, Berlin and Wroclaw, and was released on October 16. \"Bridge of Spies\" was popular with critics, and was nominated for six Academy Awards, including Best Picture; Rylance won Best Supporting Actor, becoming the second actor to win for a performance directed by Spielberg.\nIn 2016, Spielberg made \"The BFG,\" an adaptation of Roald Dahl's children's book, starring newcomer Ruby Barnhill, and Mark Rylance as the titular Big Friendly Giant. DreamWorks bought the rights in 2010, and John Madden had intended to direct. The film was the last to be written by \"E.T.\" screenwriter Melissa Mathison before her death. It was co-produced and released by Walt Disney Pictures, marking the first Disney-branded film to be directed by Spielberg. \"The BFG\" premiered as an out-of-competition entry at the 2016 Cannes Film Festival, and received a wide release in the US on July 1, 2016. \"The BFG\" received fair reviews; Michael Phillips of \"The Chicago Tribune\" compared certain scenes to the works of Alfred Hitchcock and Stanley Kubrick, while \"Toronto Sun\"'s Liz Braun thought that there were \"moments of wonder and delight\" but it was too long.\nA year later, Spielberg directed \"The Post\", an account of \"The Washington Post\"'s printing of the \"Pentagon Papers\". Starring Tom Hanks and Meryl Streep, production began in New York on May 30, 2017. Spielberg stated his attraction to the project: \"When I read the first draft of the script, this wasn't something that could wait three years or two years\u2014this was a story I felt we needed to tell today.\" The film received a wide release on January 12, 2018. \"The Post\" gained positive reception; the critic from the \"Associated Press\" thought \"Spielberg infuses every scene with tension and life and the grandeur of the ordinary that he's always been so good at conveying.\" In 2017, Spielberg and Paul Greengrass, Francis Ford Coppola, Guillermo del Toro and Lawrence Kasdan were featured in the Netflix documentary series \"Five Came Back\", about the war-related works of directors Frank Capra, John Ford, John Huston, George Stevens and William Wyler. Spielberg was also an executive producer. He executive produced the series with Barry Diller and Scott Rudin.\nSpielberg directed the science fiction \"Ready Player One\" (2018), adapted from the novel of the same name by Ernest Cline. It stars Tye Sheridan, Olivia Cooke, Ben Mendelsohn, Lena Waithe, T.J. Miller, Simon Pegg, and Mark Rylance. The plot takes place in 2045 when much of humanity uses virtual reality to escape the real world. \"Ready Player One\" began production in July 2016, and was intended to be released on December 15, 2017, but was moved to March 2018 to avoid competition with \"\". It premiered at the 2018 South by Southwest film festival. Spielberg's direction was praised along with the action scenes and visual effects, but many critics thought the film was too long and overused 1980s nostalgia.\nIn 2019, Spielberg filmed \"West Side Story\", an adaptation of the musical of the same name. It stars Ansel Elgort and Rachel Zegler in her film debut with Ariana DeBose, David Alvarez, Mike Faist, and Rita Moreno in supporting roles. Written by Tony Kushner, the film stays true to the 1950s setting. \"West Side Story\" was released in December 2021 to positive reviews and received seven Academy Award nominations including Best Picture, and Best Director. Spielberg also received nominations from the Golden Globe Awards, Directors Guild of America, and Critics' Choice Movie Awards. \"The Economist\" praised the choreography, stating that it \"stunningly melds beauty and violence\". In March 2022, Spielberg said that \"West Side Story\" would be the last musical he will direct.\nSpielberg's 2022 film \"The Fabelmans\" is a fictionalized account of his own adolescence, which he wrote with Tony Kushner. Gabriel LaBelle plays Sammy Fabelman, a character inspired by Spielberg, while Michelle Williams plays Sammy's mother Mitzi Fabelman, Paul Dano plays Burt Fabelman, his father, Seth Rogen plays Bennie Loewy, Burt's best friend and co-worker who becomes Sammy's surrogate uncle, and Judd Hirsch as Mitzi's Uncle Boris. Filming began in Los Angeles in July 2021, and the film premiered at the 2022 Toronto International Film Festival on September 10, Spielberg's first appearance at that festival. It received widespread critical acclaim and won the festival's People's Choice Award. It received a limited theatrical release on November 11, 2022, by Universal Pictures, before expanding wide on November 23.\nDespite the favorable critical reception, \"West Side Story\" and \"The Fabelmans\" were box-office failures, which \"Variety\" suggested could be attributed to a decline in the popularity of Spielberg in a film-going environment altered by the COVID-19 pandemic, and the public's loss of interest in prestige films. \"The Fabelmans\" received seven Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Original Screenplay. It was, however, a major box office success in France and became the highest-rated film of the 21st century in the country, with a 4.9 average from critics on AlloCin\u00e9 from 43 reviews, with all but 6 giving the film 5 stars. \"Cahiers du Cin\u00e9ma\" wrote that Spielberg, at age 76, had \"come to represent like no other, the idea of cinema as wonder, at a time when the relationship to the spectacular and the cinema seems more tormented than ever\" and declared that the film will \"undoubtedly remain the most important and singular film of his career\".\nSpielberg had planned to direct \"Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny\", but he stepped down and was replaced by James Mangold. Spielberg said that he would remain \"hands on\" as a producer, along with Kathleen Kennedy and Frank Marshall. In 2016, it was announced that it would be written by David Koepp, with a release by Disney on July 19, 2019. After a change of filming and release dates, it was postponed again when Jonathan Kasdan was announced as the film's new writer. Soon after, a new release date of July 9, 2021, was announced. In May 2019, Dan Fogelman was hired to write a new script, and Kasdan's story, focused on the Nazi gold train, would not be used; the script was ultimately credited to Mangold, Koepp, Jez Butterworth, and John-Henry Butterworth. In April 2020, it was announced that the release of the film was delayed to July 29, 2022, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and in October 2021, the release date was again delayed to June 30, 2023. The film began production in the UK in June 2021 and finished in February 2022.\nIn February 2025, Spielberg began shooting his next as-yet untitled film, reportedly about UFOs. The screenplay was written by David Koepp, based on an original idea from Spielberg. The film will star Emily Blunt, Josh O'Connor, Colman Domingo, Colin Firth, and Eve Hewson, and is set to be released in theatres on May 15, 2026, by Universal Pictures.\nOther ventures.\nProduction.\nSpielberg's first film as an executive producer was the directorial debut of Robert Zemeckis, \"I Wanna Hold Your Hand\" (1978). He produced Zemeckis's dark comedy \"Used Cars\" (1980), which was a critical but not a commercial success. In 1980, Spielberg, Kathleen Kennedy and Frank Marshall founded Amblin Productions; the first film it produced was the romantic comedy \"Continental Divide\" (Michael Apted, 1981). It went on to produce \"Gremlins\" (Joe Dante, 1984), \"Back to the Future\" (Zemeckis, 1985), \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\" (Zemeckis, 1988), \"Joe Versus the Volcano\" (John Patrick Shanley, 1990), \"Men in Black\" (Barry Sonnenfeld, 1997) and \"The Mask of Zorro\" (Martin Campbell, 1998). For some, including \"Young Sherlock Holmes\" (Barry Levinson, 1985) and \"Harry and the Hendersons\" (William Dear, 1987), the title \"Steven Spielberg Presents\" was in the opening credits. It produced Don Bluth's animated films \"An American Tail\" (1986) and \"The Land Before Time\" (1988), leading to the spin-off Amblimation. In 1985, NBC offered Spielberg a two-year contract on a television series, \"Amazing Stories;\" the show was marketed as a blend of \"The Twilight Zone\" and \"Alfred Hitchcock Presents\". NBC gave Spielberg creative control and a budget of $1 million for each episode. After two seasons and disappointing ratings, the show was not renewed. Although Spielberg's involvement as a producer would vary widely from project to project, Zemeckis said that Spielberg would always \"respect the filmmaker's vision\". Over the next decade, Spielberg's record as a producer brought mixed critical and commercial results. In 1992, Spielberg began to scale back producing, saying \"Producing has been the least fulfilling aspect of what I've done in the last decade.\" He produced cartoons such as \"Tiny Toon Adventures\", \"Animaniacs\", \"Family Dog\", \"Freakazoid!\", and \"Pinky and the Brain\". He produced \"A Brief History of Time\" by Errol Morris.\nIn 1993, Spielberg served as an executive producer for the NBC science fiction series \"seaQuest DSV;\" the show was not a hit. In 1994, he found success producing the medical drama \"ER\".\nThat year, Spielberg founded DreamWorks with Jeffrey Katzenberg and David Geffen. Spielberg cited greater creative control and distribution improvements as the main reasons for founding his own studio; he and his partners compared themselves to the founders of United Artists in 1919. DreamWorks' investors included Microsoft founders Paul Allen and Bill Gates. After founding DreamWorks, Spielberg continued to operate Amblin Entertainment and direct films for other studios. He helped design at Universal Studios Florida. The workload of filmmaking and operating a studio raised questions about his commitments, but Spielberg maintained that \"this is all fitting nicely into my life and I'm still home by six and I'm still home on the weekends.\" In 1998, DreamWorks Animation produced its first full-length animated features, \"Antz\" and \"The Prince of Egypt\". \"Shrek\" (2001) was the first winner of the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature.\nSpielberg and Tom Hanks produced \"Band of Brothers\" (2001), a ten-part HBO miniseries based on Stephen E. Ambrose's book of the same name. It follows Easy Company of the 101st Airborne Division's 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment. It won a Golden Globe for Best Miniseries. He produced \"Memoirs of a Geisha\" (2005), an adaptation of Arthur Golden's novel of the same name. Spielberg and Zemeckis executive-produced the animated film \"Monster House\" (2006), marking their eighth collaboration. He also worked with Clint Eastwood for the first time, co-producing \"Flags of Our Fathers\" and \"Letters from Iwo Jima\" with Robert Lorenz. Spielberg served as executive producer for \"Disturbia,\" (2007) and the \"Transformers\" film series. That same year, Spielberg and Mark Burnett co-produced \"On the Lot,\" a reality and competition show about filmmaking. Spielberg returned to the World War II theme, co-producing the 2010 miniseries \"The Pacific\" with Hanks and Gary Goetzman. It is centered on the battles in the Pacific Theater. The next year, Spielberg co-created \"Falling Skies\", a science fiction series on TNT, with Robert Rodat and produced the 2011 Fox series \"Terra Nova\" and J. J. Abrams's \"Super 8\".\nIn January 2013, HBO confirmed that it was developing a World War II miniseries based on the book Donald L. Miller's \"Masters of the Air\" with Spielberg and Hanks. \"NME\" reported in March 2017 that production was under the working title \"The Mighty Eighth\". By 2019, it was confirmed development of the miniseries, now titled \"Masters of the Air\", had moved to Apple TV+. The series premiered on January 26, 2024. On January 18, 2023, Spielberg told press at a red carpet event for \"The Fabelmans\" that he was executive producing a documentary about John Williams, directed by Laurent Bouzereau with production companies Amblin Television, Imagine Documentaries, and Nedland Media. Other executive producers for the film include Brian Grazer, Ron Howard, Darryl Frank, Justin Falvey, Justin Wilkes, Sara Bernstein, and Meredith Kaulfers. The announcement came days after Williams suggested that he might not retire from film scoring as he had previously announced. The film, \"Music by John Williams\", premiered at the 2024 AFI Fest.\nUpcoming and prospective projects.\nIn May 2009, Spielberg bought the rights to the life story of Martin Luther King Jr., with the intention of being involved as both the producer and director. The purchase was made from the King estate, led by son Dexter, while the two other surviving children, the Reverend Bernice and Martin III, immediately threatened to sue, not having given their approvals to the project. In March 2013, Spielberg announced that he was developing a miniseries based on the life of Napoleon. In May 2016, it was announced that Cary Joji Fukunaga was in talks to direct the miniseries for HBO, from a script by David Leland based on extensive research materials accumulated by Stanley Kubrick over the years.\nSpielberg was set to film an adaptation of David I. Kertzer's \"The Kidnapping of Edgardo Mortara\" in early 2017, for release at the end of that year, but production was ultimately postponed. It was first announced in 2014, with Tony Kushner adapting the book for the screen. Mark Rylance, in his fourth collaboration with Spielberg, was announced to star in the role of Pope Pius IX. Spielberg saw more than 2,000 children to play the role of the young Edgardo Mortara. In 2015, it was announced that Spielberg was attached to direct an adaptation of American photojournalist Lynsey Addario's memoir \"It's What I Do,\" with Jennifer Lawrence in the lead role. In April 2018, it was announced that Spielberg would direct a film adaptation of the \"Blackhawk\" comic book series. Warner Bros. would distribute the film with David Koepp writing the script.\nOn June 21, 2021, it was announced that Amblin Entertainment signed a deal with Netflix to release multiple new feature films for the streaming service. Under the deal, Amblin is expected to produce at least two films a year for Netflix for an unspecified number of years. In February 2022, \"Deadline Hollywood\" reported that Spielberg was developing an original film centered around the character Frank Bullitt, a fictional San Francisco police officer originally portrayed by Steve McQueen in the 1968 film \"Bullitt\". The screenplay is set to be written by Josh Singer, who previously co-wrote \"The Post\" for Spielberg. McQueen's son Chad and granddaughter Molly will serve as executive producers. Bradley Cooper was cast as Bullitt in November 2022 and will also serve as producer alongside Spielberg and Kristie Macosko Krieger.\nOn February 14, 2025, it was announced that \"The Goonies 2\" was in the works with Spielberg producing.\nVideo games.\nSpielberg has been an avid gamer since 1974. Spielberg played many of LucasArts adventure games, including the first \"Monkey Island\" games.\nIn 1995, Spielberg helped create and design LucasArts' adventure game \"The Dig\". He also collaborated with software publishers Knowledge Adventure on the game \"Steven Spielberg's Director's Chair\", which was released in 1996; Spielberg appears in the game to direct the player.\nIn 2005, Spielberg collaborated with Electronic Arts (EA) on several games including one for the Wii called \"Boom Blox,\" and its sequel \"Boom Blox Bash Party\". He is also the creator of EA's \"Medal of Honor\" series.\nHe dislikes the use of cutscenes in games.\nTheatre.\nSpielberg first ventured into theatre producing in 1997, with his involvement on a production of \"The Diary of Anne Frank\", as well as the original 1998 production of \"The Farnsworth Invention\". In 2022, he made his Broadway producing debut as a co-producer on the musical \"A Strange Loop\". He went on to produce the stage musical adaptations of \"Water for Elephants\" and \"Death Becomes Her\" alongside his wife Kate Capshaw, both in 2024. He will next co-produce the upcoming stage adaptation of \"Smash\", based on the 2012 NBC television series of the same name, on which he served as an executive producer. It is set to begin performances in 2025.\nFilmmaking style and techniques.\nInfluences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n \"I didn't go to film school. I was self-taught. But I had great teachers, you know? All my influencers were the directors and the writers of the movies I was watching in theaters and on television. And my film school was really the cultural heritage of Hollywood and international filmmaking because there's no better teacher than Lubitsch or Hitchcock or Kurosawa or Kubrick, you know, or Ford or William Wyler or Billy Wilder or Clarence Brown \u2013 I mean, Val Lewton. I mean, those were my teachers.\"\n \u2014 Steven Spielberg, \"Fresh Air\" interview\nSpielberg cites John Ford as a formative influence: \"I try to rent a John Ford film... before I start every movie, simply because he inspires me... He's like a classic painter, he celebrates the frame, not just what's inside it.\" He names Frank Capra's \"It's A Wonderful Life\" (1946) as an influence on themes of \"family, community and suburbia\". He enjoyed the work of Alfred Hitchcock, David Lean, Stanley Kubrick and John Frankenheimer. In college, he was inspired by foreign films by Ingmar Bergman, Jacques Tati and Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut. Spencer Tracy has also influenced the characters of Spielberg's films, as did \"The Twilight Zone\". He says \"Lawrence of Arabia\" is the film he's seen more times than any other. With Martin Scorsese, Spielberg helped with the restoration of \"Lawrence\" by Robert A. Harris. Among films by his contemporaries, Spielberg was influenced by Francis Ford Coppola's \"The Godfather\": \"I was pulverized by the story and the effect the film had on me... I also felt that I should quit, that there was no reason I should continue directing because I would never achieve that level of confidence and ability to tell a story.\" In 2005, Coppola contacted Spielberg about restoring the film; Spielberg contacted studio head Brad Grey. In 1982, Spielberg bought one of the prop sleds from \"Citizen Kane\". Spielberg called \"Kane\" 'the most classic movie ever made,\" and the sled \"a symbolic emblem of quality in the film business\".\nMethod and themes.\nSpielberg often uses storyboards to visualize sequences, eschewing them for \"E.T. the Extraterrestrial\" and \"The Color Purple\" for a more spontaneous effect. After filming \"Jaws\", Spielberg learned to save special effects scenes until last and to exclude the media from filming locations. Spielberg prefers to shoot quickly, with large amounts of coverage (from single-shot to multi-shot setups), so that he will have many options in the editing room. From the beginning of his career, Spielberg's shooting style consisted of extreme high and low camera angles, long takes, and handheld cameras. He favors wide-angle lens for creating depth, and by the time he was making \"Minority Report\", he was more confident with elaborate camera movements.\nIn an interview with \"The Tech\" in 2015, Spielberg described how he chooses his film projects:&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;[Sometimes], a story speaks to me, even if it doesn't speak to any of my collaborators or any of my partners, who look at me and scratch their heads and say, \"Gee, are you sure you wanna get into that trench for a year and a half?\" I love people challenging me that way because it's a real test about my own convictions and [whether] I can be the standing man of my own life and take a stand on a subject that may not be popular, but that I would be proud to add to the body of my work. That's pretty much the litmus test that gets me to say, \"Yeah, I'll direct that one.\"Spielberg's films contain many recurrent themes. One of the most pertinent revolves around \"ordinary people in extraordinary circumstances\". The ordinary people often have limitations, but they succeed in becoming a \"hero\". A consistent theme in his family-friendly work is a childlike sense of wonder and faith, and \"the goodness in humanity will prevail\". He has also explored the importance of childhood, loss of innocence, and the need for parental figures. In exploring the parent-child relationship, there is usually a flawed or irresponsible father figure. This theme personally resonates with Spielberg's childhood. Exploring extraterrestrial life is another aspect to his work. Spielberg described himself as like an \"alien\" during childhood, and this interest came from his father, a science fiction fan.\nCollaborators.\nMichael Kahn has edited all of Spielberg's films since 1977, with the exception of \"E.T.\" (1982). Spielberg has also worked consistently with production designer Rick Carter and writer David Koepp. The producer Kathleen Kennedy is one of Spielberg's longest serving collaborators. Spielberg also displays loyalty to his actors, casting them repeatedly, including Tom Hanks, Harrison Ford, Mark Rylance, Richard Dreyfuss and Tom Cruise. In 2005, Cruise called him \"the greatest storyteller cinema's ever known\".\nHanks has collaborated with Spielberg on various projects in both film and television. He first worked with Spielberg in \"Saving Private Ryan\" (1998) for which he received a nomination for Academy Award for Best Actor. Hanks starred in four more films, \"Catch Me if You Can\" (2002), \"The Terminal\" (2004), \"Bridge of Spies\" (2015) and \"The Post\" (2017). The pair also executive produced the war miniseries \"Band of Brothers\" (2001) and \"The Pacific\" (2010), both of which gained them Primetime Emmy Awards.\nJanusz Kami\u0144ski has served as a cinematographer on dozens of Spielberg's films. Kami\u0144ski's first collaboration with Spielberg started with the holocaust drama film \"Schindler's List\" (1993) for which Kami\u0144ski received the Academy Award for Best Cinematography. The film used black-and-white cinematography. As Spielberg's career evolved from action to drama films, he and Kami\u0144ski adopted more handheld camerawork, as evidenced in \"Schindler's List\" and \"Amistad\". Kami\u0144ski would later receive his second Academy Award for cinematography on \"Saving Private Ryan\". The film's opening sequence to re-enact the invasion of Normandy was praised for realism. Kami\u0144ski garnered three more Academy Award nominations for his work on \"War Horse\" (2011), the historical epic \"Lincoln\" (2012), and \"West Side Story\" (2021).\nSpielberg's long-time partnership with composer John Williams began with \"The Sugarland Express\" (1974). Williams would return to compose all but five of Spielberg's feature films (the exceptions are \"Twilight Zone: The Movie\", \"The Color Purple\", \"Bridge of Spies\", \"Ready Player One\" and \"West Side Story\"). Williams won three of his five Academy Awards for Best Original Score for his work on Spielberg's films, which were \"Jaws\" (1975), \"E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial\" (1982), and \"Schindler's List\" (1993). While making \"Schindler's List\", Spielberg approached Williams about composing the score. After seeing a rough, unedited cut, Williams was impressed, and said that composing would be too challenging. He said to Spielberg, \"You need a better composer than I am for this film.\" Spielberg responded, \"I know. But they're all dead!\" In 2016, Spielberg presented Williams with the 44th AFI Life Achievement Award, the first to be awarded to a composer.\nPersonal life.\nSpielberg met actress Amy Irving in 1976 when she auditioned for \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\". After meeting her, Spielberg told his co-producer Julia Phillips, \"I met a real heartbreaker last night.\" Although she was too young for the role, she and Spielberg began dating and she eventually moved into what she described as his \"bachelor funky\" house. They broke up in 1979. In 1984, they renewed their romance and married in November 1985. Their son, Max, had been born on June 13 of that year. In 1989, the couple divorced; they agreed to live near each other to share custody of their son. Their divorce settlement is one of the most expensive in history.\nSpielberg met actress Kate Capshaw when he cast her in \"Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom\" in 1984. They married on October 12, 1991; Capshaw converted to Judaism before their marriage. Spielberg said he rediscovered \"the honor of being a Jew\" when they married. He said, \"Kate is Protestant and she insisted on converting to Judaism. She spent a year studying, did the \"mikveh\", the whole thing. She chose to do a full conversion \"before\" we were married in 1991, and she married me after becoming a Jew. I think that, more than anything else, brought me back to Judaism.\" He credits her for the family's level of observance; \"This shiksa goddess has made me a better Jew than my own parents\", he said. He and his family live in Pacific Palisades, California and East Hampton, New York.\nHe has five children with Capshaw: Sasha Rebecca Spielberg (born May 14, 1990), Sawyer Avery Spielberg (born March 10, 1992), and Destry Allyn Spielberg (born December 1, 1996), and two adopted children: Theo Spielberg (born August 21, 1988), and Mikaela George (born February 28, 1996). He also has a stepdaughter, Jessica Capshaw (born August 9, 1976). He is the godfather of Drew Barrymore and Gwyneth Paltrow.\nSpielberg was diagnosed with dyslexia at age 60. In 2022, at age 75, Spielberg was diagnosed with COVID-19 but recovered.\nIn 2013, Spielberg purchased the mega-yacht \"The Seven Seas\" for US$182 million. During his ownership it was also available for charter at US$1.2 million per month, making it one of the most expensive charters on the market at the time. In 2021 The Canadian steel mogul Barry Zekelman bought it for US$150 million and rechristened the ship \"Man of Steel\". Thereafter, Spielberg ordered a new \"Seven Seas\".\nIn December 2022, Spielberg was a guest on \"Desert Island Discs\" for BBC Radio 4, choosing for his luxury item an H-8 Bolex Camera.\nStalkers.\nIn 1997, Jonathan Norman stalked Spielberg and attempted to enter his home while in possession of a \"rape kit\"; Norman was subsequently jailed for 25 years. Prosecutors described Norman as \"sexually obsessed\" with the director. Spielberg told the court he feared Norman intended to \"rape or maim him\". In 2001, Spielberg was stalked by conspiracy theorist and former social worker Diana Napolis. She accused him and actress Jennifer Love Hewitt of installing a mind-control device in her brain and being part of a satanic cult. Napolis was committed to a mental institution, and pled guilty to stalking. She was released on probation with a condition that she have no contact with either Spielberg or Hewitt.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nPolitical views.\nSpielberg has usually supported Democratic Party candidates. He has donated over $800,000 to the Democratic party and its nominees. He has been a close friend of former president Bill Clinton and worked with the president for the USA Millennium celebrations. He directed an 18-minute film for the project, scored by John Williams and entitled \"The American Journey\". It was shown at America's Millennium Gala on December 31, 1999, in the National Mall at the Reflecting Pool at the base of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C. Spielberg endorsed Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election; he donated $1 million to Priorities USA Action.\n Spielberg resigned as a member of the national advisory board of the Boy Scouts of America in 2001 because he disagreed with the organization's anti-homosexuality stance. In 2007, the Arab League voted to boycott Spielberg's movies after he donated $1\u00a0million for relief efforts in Israel during the 2006 Lebanon War. On February 20, 2007, Spielberg, Jeffrey Katzenberg, and David Geffen invited Democrats to a fundraiser for Barack Obama.\nIn February 2008, Spielberg resigned as advisor to the 2008 Summer Olympics in response to the Chinese government's inaction over the War in Darfur. Spielberg said in a statement, \"I find that my conscience will not allow me to continue business as usual [...] Sudan's government bears the bulk of the responsibility for these on-going crimes, but the international community, and particularly China, should be doing more.\" The International Olympic Committee (IOC) respected Spielberg's decision but IOC president Jacques Rogge expressed disappointment: \"[Spielberg] certainly would have brought a lot to the opening ceremony in terms of creativity.\" Chinese state media called Spielberg's comments \"unfair\".\nIn September 2008, Spielberg and his wife offered their support to same-sex marriage in California by issuing a statement following their donation of $100,000 to the \"No on Proposition 8\" campaign fund, a figure equal to the amount of money Brad Pitt donated to the same campaign less than a week prior. In 2018, Spielberg and his wife donated $500,000 to the March for Our Lives student demonstration in favor of gun control in the United States.\nIn December 2023, after the October 7 attacks, the Shoah Foundation, which was founded by Spielberg, said that it had gathered over 100 video testimonies of those who experienced the attacks on that day to add them to the collection of \"Holocaust survivor and witness testimony.\" Speaking of the attacks he said, \"I never imagined I would see such unspeakable barbarity against Jews in my lifetime\" and that the Shoah Foundation project will ensure \"that their stories would be recorded and shared in the effort to preserve history and to work toward a world without antisemitism or hate of any kind\".\nFilmography.\nProlific in film since the 1960s, Spielberg has directed 36 feature films, and co-produced many works.\nAwards and honors.\nSpielberg has won three Academy Awards. He received nine nominations for Best Director, and won twice (for \"Schindler's List\" and \"Saving Private Ryan\"). His third was in Best Picture, for \"Schindler's List.\" He is the only director to receive a Best Director nomination from the academy in 6 different decades. In 1987, he was awarded the Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award for his work as a creative producer. Drawing from his own experiences in Scouting, Spielberg helped the Boy Scouts of America develop a merit badge in cinematography to promote filmmaking as a marketable skill; the badge was launched at the 1989 National Scout Jamboree. In 1989, Spielberg was presented with the Distinguished Eagle Scout Award. Spielberg received the AFI Life Achievement Award in 1995.\nIn 1998, he was awarded the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany. The award was presented to him by President Roman Herzog in recognition of \"Schindler's List\" and work with the Shoah Foundation. Spielberg was awarded the Medal for Distinguished Public Service in 1999, in recognition for \"Saving Private Ryan\". For the same film, he also received an award for Outstanding Directorial Achievement in Motion Pictures by the Directors Guild of America. The next year, he received the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Directors Guild of America.\nSpielberg was given a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2003, located on 6801 Hollywood Boulevard.

On July 15, 2006, Spielberg was awarded the at the Summer Gala of the Chicago International Film Festival, and was awarded a Kennedy Center honor on December 3. The tribute to Spielberg featured a biographical short film narrated by Liam Neeson, and a performance of the finale to Leonard Bernstein's \"Candide\", conducted by John Williams.\nThe Science Fiction Hall of Fame inducted Spielberg in 2005, the first year it considered non-literary contributors. He was a recipient of the Visual Effects Society Lifetime Achievement Award in February 2008; it is awarded for \"significant and lasting contributions to the art and science of the visual effects industry\". In 2009, Spielberg was awarded the Cecil B. DeMille Award by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association for \"outstanding contributions to the world of entertainment\".\nIn 2001, he was awarded an honorary knighthood (KBE), by Queen Elizabeth II for services to the British film industry. Because he is not a British citizen, he did not kneel to be knighted, nor can he use the honorific prefix \"Sir\", but he can use the suffix \"KBE.\" \"Premiere\" ranked him first place in the list of 100 Most Powerful People in Movies in 2003. In 2004, he was awarded France's highest civil honor, the Legion of Honour by President Jacques Chirac. In June 2008, Spielberg received Arizona State University's Hugh Downs Award for Communication Excellence. In October 2009, Spielberg received the Philadelphia Liberty Medal; the prize was presented by former US President Bill Clinton. In October 2011, he was made a Commander of the Order of the Belgian Crown, one of Belgium's highest honors. On November 19, 2013, Spielberg was honored by the National Archives and Records Administration with a Records of Achievement Award. Spielberg was given two facsimiles of the 13th Amendment; the first which passed in 1861 but was not ratified, and the second signed by Abraham Lincoln in 1865 to abolish slavery. The amendment and the process of passing it were the subject of his film \"Lincoln\". On November 24, 2015, Spielberg was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Barack Obama at the White House.\nIn July 2016, Spielberg was awarded a gold Blue Peter badge by the BBC children's television program \"Blue Peter.\" He has honorary degrees from the University of Southern California, 1994; Brown University, 1999; Yale University, 2002; Boston University, 2009; and Harvard University, 2016.\nDirected Academy Award performancesUnder Spielberg's direction, these actors have received Academy Award nominations and wins for their performances in their respective roles.\nLegacy.\nA figure of the New Hollywood era, Spielberg is widely regarded as one of the most influential and commercially successful film directors of all time. Some of his films were in the top ten highest-grossing films of the 1970s and 1980s, with \"Jaws\", \"E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial\" and \"Jurassic Park\" all becoming the highest-grossing film ever at the time of their respective releases. In 1996, \"Life\" magazine named Spielberg the most influential person of his generation. In 2003, \"Premiere\" magazine ranked him first place in the list of 100 Most Powerful People in Movies\".\" In 2005, \"Empire\" magazine ranked him number one on a list of the greatest film directors of all time. In 2013, \"Time\" magazine listed him as one of the 100 most influential people. According to \"Forbes\"' magazine of Most Influential Celebrities of 2014, Spielberg was ranked at first place. As of December 2024, \"Forbes\" estimates his net worth at $5.3billion, making him one of the richest people in the entertainment industry.\nHis work is admired by numerous acclaimed directors, including Robert Aldrich, Ingmar Bergman, Werner Herzog, Stanley Kubrick, David Lean, Sidney Lumet, Roman Polanski, Martin Scorsese, Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut and Jean Renoir Spielberg's films have also influenced directors J. J. Abrams, Paul Thomas Anderson, Sean Baker, Neill Blomkamp, Jon M. Chu, Arnaud Desplechin, Gareth Edwards, Roland Emmerich, Enrique Gato, Don Hertzfeldt, Peter Jackson, Kal Ng, Jordan Peele, S. S. Rajamouli, Robert Rodriguez, John Sayles, Ridley Scott, John Singleton, Kevin Smith, and Michael Williams. In 2004, film critic Tom Shone said of Spielberg, \"If you have to point to any one director of the last twenty-five years [1979\u20132004] in whose work the medium of film was most fully itself\u2013where we found out what it does best when left to its own devices, it has to be that guy.\" Jess Cagle, former editor of \"Entertainment Weekly\", called Spielberg \"arguably (well, who would argue?) the greatest filmmaker in history.\" Stephen Rowley, writing for \"Senses of Cinema,\" discussed Spielberg's strengths as a filmmaker, saying \"there is a welcome complexity of tone and approach in these later films that defies the lazy stereotypes often bandied about his films\", and that \"Spielberg continues to take risks, with his body of work continuing to grow more impressive and ambitious\", concluding that he has only received \"limited, begrudging recognition\" from critics. In a 1999 \"Millennium Movies\" survey of British film fans run by the Sky Premier channel, Spielberg had seven films in the top 100, which made him the most popular director.\nCritics of Spielberg have argued that his films are commonly sentimental and moralistic. In \"Easy Riders, Raging Bulls\", Peter Biskind wrote that Spielberg is \"infantilizing the audience, reconstituting the spectator as child, then overwhelming him and her with sound and spectacle, obliterating irony, aesthetic self-consciousness, and critical reflection\". Critic Ray Carney and actor Crispin Glover opined that Spielberg's works lack depth and do not take risks. Filmmaker Jean-Luc Godard opined that Spielberg was partly responsible for the lack of artistic merit in mainstream cinema, and accused Spielberg of using \"Schindler's List\" to profit from a tragedy, despite the fact that Spielberg chose not to take a salary for the film. In defense of Spielberg, critic Roger Ebert said \"Has Godard or any other director living or dead done more than Spielberg, with his Holocaust Project, to honor and preserve the memories of the survivors?\"\nSeven of his films have been inducted into the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\": \"Jaws, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Raiders of the Lost Ark, E.T., Jurassic Park, Schindler's List,\" and \"Saving Private Ryan\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He has five younger siblings, three of whom (Joie, David, and Cinqu\u00e9) have worked in many different positions in his films. A fourth, Christopher, died in 2014. His youngest sibling is half-brother Arnold. Director Malcolm D. Lee is his cousin. When he was a child, the family moved from Atlanta to Brooklyn, New York. His mother nicknamed him \"Spike\" during his childhood. He attended John Dewey High School in Brooklyn's Gravesend neighborhood.\nLee enrolled in Morehouse College, a historically black college in Atlanta, where he made his first student film, \"Last Hustle in Brooklyn\". He took film courses at Clark Atlanta University and graduated with a B.A. in mass communication from Morehouse in 1979. He did graduate work at New York University's Tisch School of the Arts, where he earned a Master of Fine Arts in film and television in 1982.\nDavid Lee, a younger brother of Spike, is a still photographer, and has done the still photography for all of his older brother's feature films before 2013 with the exception of \"Get on the Bus\" and \"He Got Game\". Other films he has done still photography for include \"The Preacher's Wife\", \"The Best Man\", \"Pollock\", \"Made\", \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\", and \"American Gangster\", and the television series \"The Wire\".\nCareer.\n1980\u20131989: Student films and breakthrough.\nIn 1983, Lee premiered his first independent short film titled, \"\". Lee submitted the film as his master's degree thesis at the Tisch School of the Arts. Lee's classmates Ang Lee and Ernest R. Dickerson worked on the film as assistant director and cinematographer, respectively. The film was the first student film to be showcased in Lincoln Center's New Directors New Films Festival. Lee's father, Bill Lee, composed the score. The film won a Student Academy Award.\nIn 1985, Lee began work on his first feature film, \"She's Gotta Have It\". The black-and-white film concerns a young woman (played by Tracy Camilla Johns) who is seeing three men, and the feelings this arrangement provokes. The film was Lee's first feature-length film, and launched Lee's career. Lee wrote, directed, produced, starred and edited the film with a budget of $175,000, he shot the film in two weeks. When the film was released in 1986, it grossed over $7 million at the U.S. box office. \"New York Times\" film critic A.O. Scott wrote that the film \"ushered in (along with Jim Jarmusch's \"Stranger Than Paradise\") the American independent film movement of the 1980s. It was also a groundbreaking film for African-American filmmakers and a welcome change in the representation of blacks in American cinema, depicting men and women of color not as pimps and whores, but as intelligent, upscale urbanites.\" He followed this with the musical drama \"School Daze\" (1988).\nIn 1989, Lee made perhaps his most seminal film, \"Do the Right Thing,\" which focused on a Brooklyn neighborhood's simmering racial tension on a hot summer day. The film's cast included Lee, Danny Aiello, Bill Nunn, Ossie Davis, Ruby Dee, Giancarlo Esposito, Rosie Perez, John Turturro, Martin Lawrence and Samuel L. Jackson. The film gained critical acclaim as one of the best films of the year from film critics including both Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert who ranked the film as the best of 1989, and later in their top 10 films of the decade (No.\u202f6 for Siskel and No.\u202f4 for Ebert). Ebert later added the film to his list of \"The Great Movies\".\nTo many people's surprise, the film was not nominated for Best Picture or Best Director at the Academy Awards. The film only earned two Academy Award nominations for Best Original Screenplay, Spike Lee's first Oscar nomination, and for Best Supporting Actor for Danny Aiello. At the Academy ceremony Kim Basinger, who was a presenter that evening, stated that \"Do the Right Thing\" also deserved a Best Picture nomination stating, \"We've got five great films here, and they are great for one reason, because they tell the truth, but there is one film missing from this list because ironically it might tell the biggest truth of all and that's \"Do the Right Thing\"\". The film that did win Best Picture was \"Driving Miss Daisy\", a film that focused on race relations between an elderly Jewish woman (Jessica Tandy) and her driver (Morgan Freeman). Lee said in an April 7, 2006, interview with \"New York\" magazine that the other film's success, which he thought was based on safe stereotypes, hurt him more than if his film had not been nominated for an award.\n1990\u20131999: Established director.\nIn 1990, Lee had his first collaboration with Denzel Washington in \"Mo' Better Blues\". After the release of \"Mo' Better Blues\", Lee was accused of antisemitism by the Anti-Defamation League and several film critics. They criticized the characters of the club owners Josh and Moe Flatbush, described as \"Shylocks\". Lee denied the charge, explaining that he wrote those characters in order to depict how black artists struggled against exploitation. Lee said that Lew Wasserman, Sidney Sheinberg, or Tom Pollock, the Jewish heads of MCA and Universal Studios, were unlikely to allow antisemitic content in a film they produced. He said he could not make an antisemitic film because Jews run Hollywood, and \"that's a fact\". His next film was \"Jungle Fever\" (1991), for which Samuel L. Jackson won acclaim for his performance as a crack addict.\nIn 1992, Spike released his biographical epic film \"Malcolm X\" based on the \"Autobiography of Malcolm X\", starring Denzel Washington as the famed civil rights leader. The film dramatizes key events in Malcolm X's life: his criminal career, his incarceration, his conversion to Islam, his ministry as a member of the Nation of Islam and his later falling out with the organization, his marriage to Betty X, his pilgrimage to Mecca and reevaluation of his views concerning whites, and his assassination on February 21, 1965. Defining childhood incidents, including his father's death, his mother's mental illness, and his experiences with racism are dramatized in flashbacks. The film received widespread critical acclaim including from critic Roger Ebert ranked the film No. 1 on his Top 10 list for 1992 and described the film as \"one of the great screen biographies, celebrating the sweep of an American life that bottomed out in prison before its hero reinvented himself.\" Ebert and Martin Scorsese, who was sitting in for late \"At the Movies\" co-host Gene Siskel, both ranked \"Malcolm X\" among the ten best films of the 1990s. Denzel Washington's portrayal of Malcolm X in particular was widely praised and he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor. Washington lost to Al Pacino (\"Scent of a Woman\"), a decision which Lee criticized, saying \"I'm not the only one who thinks Denzel was robbed on that one.\"\nHe followed \"Malcolm X\" with \"Crooklyn\" (1994), \"Clockers\" (1995), and \"Girl 6\" and \"Get on the Bus\" (both 1996). His 1997 documentary \"4 Little Girls\", about the girls killed in the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing in Birmingham, Alabama, in 1963, was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Feature Documentary. In 2017, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". He had his third collaboration with Denzel Washington on the sports drama \"He Got Game\" (1998). He followed this with \"Summer of Sam\" (1999), based on the Son of Sam murders.\n2000\u20132014: Studio films and fluctuations.\nIn 2000, Lee directed \"Bamboozled\" (2000), a satire about a modern televised minstrel show. He followed this with \"25th Hour\" (2002) starring Edward Norton and Philip Seymour Hoffman which opened to positive reviews, with several critics since having named it one of the best films of its decade. Film critic Roger Ebert added the film to his \"Great Movies\" list on December 16, 2009. A. O. Scott, Richard Roeper and Roger Ebert all put it on their \"best films of the decade\" lists. It was later named the 26th greatest film since 2000 in a BBC poll of 177 critics. The film was also a financial success earning almost $24 million against a $5 million budget. He followed \"25th Hour\" with \"She Hate Me\" (2004), which received negative reviews.\nIn 2006, Lee directed \"Inside Man\" starring Denzel Washington, Jodie Foster, Clive Owen, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Willem Dafoe and Christopher Plummer. The film was an unusual film for Lee considering it was a studio heist thriller. The film was a critical and financial success earning $186 million off a $45 million budget. \"Empire\" gave the film four stars out of five, concluding, \"It's certainly a Spike Lee film, but no Spike Lee Joint. Still, he's delivered a pacy, vigorous and frequently masterful take on a well-worn genre. Thanks to some slick lens work and a cast on cracking form, Lee proves (perhaps above all to himself?) that playing it straight is not always a bad thing.\"\nOn May 2, 2007, the 50th San Francisco International Film Festival honored Spike Lee with the San Francisco Film Society's Directing Award. In 2008, he received the Wexner Prize. The same year, Lee directed the World War II drama \"Miracle at St. Anna\".\nAt the 2008 Cannes Film Festival, Lee, who was then making \"Miracle at St. Anna,\" about an all-black U.S. division fighting in Italy during World War II, criticized director Clint Eastwood for not depicting black Marines in his own World War II film, \"Flags of Our Fathers\". Citing historical accuracy, Eastwood responded that his film was specifically about the Marines who raised the flag on Mount Suribachi at Iwo Jima, pointing out that while black Marines did fight at Iwo Jima, the U.S. military was racially segregated during World War II, and none of the men who raised the flag were black. He angrily said that Lee should \"shut his face\". Lee responded that Eastwood was acting like an \"angry old man\", and argued that despite making two Iwo Jima films back to back, \"Letters from Iwo Jima\" and \"Flags of Our Fathers\", \"there was not one black soldier in both of those films\". He added that he and Eastwood were \"not on a plantation\". Lee later claimed that the event was exaggerated by the media and that he and Eastwood had reconciled through mutual friend Steven Spielberg, culminating in his sending Eastwood a print of \"Miracle at St. Anna\".\nIn 2012, Lee directed \"Red Hook Summer\", in which he reprised his role as Mookie from \"Do the Right Thing.\" In 2013, Lee won The Dorothy and Lillian Gish Prize, one of the richest prizes in the American arts worth $300,000. The same year, he directed \"Oldboy\", a remake of the Park Chan-wook 2003 film, which was reportedly taken away from Lee in the editing room, leading him to remove his trademark \"A Spike Lee Joint\" credit for a more impersonal \"A Spike Lee Film\". He followed this with \"Da Sweet Blood of Jesus\" (2014), which was primarily funded on Kickstarter.\n2015\u2013present: Career resurgence.\nIn 2015, Lee received an Academy Honorary Award from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for his contributions to film. Friends and frequent collaborators Wesley Snipes, Denzel Washington, and Samuel L. Jackson presented Lee with the award at the private Governors Awards ceremony. Lee directed, wrote, and produced the MyCareer story mode in the video game \"NBA 2K16\". Later that same year, after a perceived long dip in quality, Lee rebounded with a musical drama film, \"Chi-Raq\". The film is a modern-day adaptation of the ancient Greek play \"Lysistrata\" by Aristophanes set in modern-day Chicago's Southside and explores the challenges of race, sex, and violence in America. Teyonah Parris, Angela Bassett, Jennifer Hudson, Nick Cannon, Dave Chappelle, Wesley Snipes, John Cusack, and Samuel L. Jackson starred in the film. The film was released by Amazon Studios in select cities in November. \"Chi-Raq\" received generally positive reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has rating of 82% with the site's critical consensus stating, \"\"Chi-Raq\" is as urgently topical and satisfyingly ambitious as it is wildly uneven \u2013 and it contains some of Spike Lee's smartest, sharpest, and all-around entertaining late-period work.\"\nLee's 2018 film \"BlacKkKlansman\", a true crime drama set in the 1970s centered around the true story of a black police officer, Ron Stallworth, infiltrating the Ku Klux Klan. The film premiered at the 2018 Cannes Film Festival, where it won the Grand Prix and opened the following August. The film received near universal praise when it opened in North America receiving a 96% on Rotten Tomatoes with the critics consensus reading, \"\"BlacKkKlansman\" uses history to offer bitingly trenchant commentary on current events \u2013 and brings out some of Spike Lee's hardest-hitting work in decades along the way.\" In 2019, during the awards season leading up to the Academy Awards, Lee was invited to join a Directors Roundtable conversation run by \"The Hollywood Reporter\". The roundtable included Ryan Coogler (\"Black Panther\"), Yorgos Lanthimos (\"The Favourite\"), Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n (\"Roma\"), Marielle Heller (\"Can You Ever Forgive Me?\"), and Bradley Cooper (\"A Star is Born\"). It was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture and Best Director (Lee's first ever nomination in this category). Lee won his first competitive Academy Award in the category Best Adapted Screenplay. When asked by journalists from the BBC if the Best Picture winner \"Green Book\" offended him, Lee replied, \"Let me give you a British answer, it's not my cup of tea\". Many journalists in the industry noted how the 2019 Oscars with \"BlacKkKlansman\" competing against eventual winner \"Green Book\" mirrored the 1989 Oscars with Lee's film \"Do the Right Thing\" missing out on a Best Picture nomination over the eventual winner \"Driving Miss Daisy\".\nLee's Vietnam war film \"Da 5 Bloods\" was released on Netflix. The film starred Delroy Lindo, Jonathan Majors, Clarke Peters, Isiah Whitlock Jr., M\u00e9lanie Thierry, Paul Walter Hauser and Chadwick Boseman. The film was released worldwide on June 12, 2020. The film's plot follows a group of aging Vietnam War veterans who return to the country in search of the remains of their fallen squad leader, as well as the treasure they buried while serving there. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, the film was scheduled to premiere out-of-competition at the 2020 Cannes Film Festival, then play in theaters in May or June before streaming on Netflix. The film received widespread critical acclaim; the website Rotten Tomatoes gave it an approval rating of 92% based on 252 reviews, with the critical consensus reading: \"Fierce energy and ambition course through \"Da 5 Bloods\", coming together to fuel one of Spike Lee's most urgent and impactful films.\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 82 out of 100, based on 49 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".\nLee has been linked to a movie musical about the origin story of Viagra, Pfizer's erectile dysfunction drug. He signed a deal with Netflix to direct and produce more movies. In February 2024, it was announced that Spike Lee was confirmed as the director of \"Highest 2 Lowest\", a reinterpretation of \"High and Low\" (1963) originally directed by Akira Kurosawa, with Denzel Washington to star. He would also make the Netflix three-part documentary series \"\".\nAcademic career and teaching.\nIn 1991, Lee taught a course at Harvard about filmmaking. In 1993, he began to teach at New York University's Tisch School of the Arts in the Graduate Film Program. It was there that he received his master of fine arts. In 2002, he was appointed as artistic director of the school. He is now a tenured professor at NYU.\nCommercials.\nIn mid-1990, Levi's hired Lee to direct a series of TV commercials for their 501 button-fly jeans. Marketing executives from Nike offered Lee a job directing commercials for the company. They wanted to pair Lee's character, Mars Blackmon, who greatly admired athlete Michael Jordan, and Jordan in a marketing campaign for the Air Jordan line. Later, Lee was asked to comment on the phenomenon of violence related to inner-city youths trying to steal Air Jordans from other kids. He said that, rather than blaming manufacturers of apparel that gained popularity, \"deal with the conditions that make a kid put so much importance on a pair of sneakers, a jacket and gold\". Through the marketing wing of 40 Acres and a Mule, Lee has directed commercials for Converse, Jaguar, Taco Bell, and Ben &amp; Jerry's.\nSince 2015, Lee has been part of Capital One's \"Road Trip\" advertising campaign, starring in a series of television commercials alongside Samuel L Jackson and Charles Barkley to coincide with March Madness. \nArtistic style and themes.\nLee's films are typically referred to as \"Spike Lee Joints\". The closing credits always end with the phrases \"By Any Means Necessary\", \"Ya Dig\", and \"Sho Nuff\". His 2013 film, \"Oldboy\", used the traditional \"A Spike Lee Film\" credit after producers had it re-edited.\nThemes.\nLee's films have examined race relations, colorism in the black community, the role of media in contemporary life, urban crime and poverty, and other political issues. His films are also noted for their unique stylistic elements, including the use of dolly shots to portray the characters \"floating\" through their surroundings, which he has had his cinematographers repeatedly use in his work.\nInfluences.\nIn 2018, during an interview with \"GQ\", Lee cited some of his favorite films as Elia Kazan's \"On the Waterfront\" (1954) and \"A Face in the Crowd\" (1957), as well as Martin Scorsese's \"Mean Streets\" (1973). Lee says that he befriended Scorsese after attending a screening of \"After Hours\" at NYU.\nPersonal life.\nMarriage.\nLee met his wife, attorney Tonya Lewis Lee, in 1992, and they were married a year later in New York. They have two children.\nWhen asked by the BBC whether he believed in God, Lee said: \"Yes. I have faith that there is a higher being. All this cannot be an accident.\" Lee continues to maintain an office in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, but he and his wife live on the Upper East Side of Manhattan.\nSports.\nSpike Lee is a fan of the New York Knicks basketball team, the New York Yankees baseball team (although he grew up a New York Mets fan), the New York Rangers ice hockey team, and the English football club Arsenal. One of the documentaries in ESPN's \"30 for 30\" series, \"Winning Time: Reggie Miller vs. The New York Knicks\", focuses partly on Lee's interaction with Miller at Knicks games in Madison Square Garden. In June 2003, Lee sought an injunction against Spike TV to prevent them from using his nickname; he claimed that because of his fame, viewers would think he was associated with the channel. In March 2020, Lee and the security team at Madison Square Garden had a disagreement over which entrance to use to see the New York Knicks; Lee stated he would not attend the rest of the games for the season. Spike Lee has also frequented New York Liberty games at Barclays Center, sitting courtside during the 2024 WNBA playoffs in a Sabrina Ionescu jersey.\nLee is also a supporter of Spanish tennis player Carlos Alcaraz and Italian soccer team Inter Milan, featuring as the narrator in a promotional video for the club in June 2025.\nPolitics.\nIn May 1999, the \"New York Post\" reported that Lee made an inflammatory comment about Charlton Heston, president of the National Rifle Association of America (NRA), while speaking to reporters at the Cannes Film Festival. Lee was quoted as saying the National Rifle Association should be disbanded and, of Heston, someone should \"Shoot him with a .44 Bull Dog.\" Lee said he intended it as a joke. He was responding to coverage about whether Hollywood was responsible for school shootings. \"The problem is guns\", he said. Republican House Majority Leader Dick Armey condemned Lee as having \"nothing to offer the debate on school violence except more violence and more hate\".\nIn October 2005, Lee responded to a CNN anchor's question as to whether the government intentionally ignored the plight of black Americans during the 2005 Hurricane Katrina catastrophe by saying, \"It's not too far-fetched. I don't put anything past the United States government. I don't find it too far-fetched that they tried to displace all the black people out of New Orleans.\" In later comments, Lee cited the government's past including the Tuskegee Syphilis Study.\nIn May 2020, Lee published a three-minute short film, \"NEW YORK NEW YORK\", on Instagram that was later featured on the city's official website. Lee celebrated Joe Biden's victory over Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election with champagne amid a crowd on the streets of Brooklyn. Lee endorsed Kamala Harris in the 2024 United States presidential election and spoke at one of her campaign rallies on October 24, 2024.\nControversy.\nIn March 2012, after the killing of Trayvon Martin, Lee was one of many people who used Twitter to circulate a message that claimed to give the home address of the shooter George Zimmerman. The address turned out to be incorrect, causing the real occupants, Elaine and David McClain, to leave home and stay at a hotel due to numerous death threats. Lee issued an apology and reached an agreement with the McClains, which reportedly included \"compensation\", with their attorney stating \"The McClains' claim is fully resolved\". Nevertheless, in November 2013, the McClains filed a negligence lawsuit which accused Lee of \"encouraging a dangerous mob mentality among his Twitter followers, as well as the public-at-large\". The lawsuit, which a court filing reportedly valued at $1.2 million, alleged that the couple suffered \"injuries and damages\" that continued after the initial settlement up through Zimmerman's trial in 2013. A Seminole County judge dismissed the McClains' suit, agreeing with Lee that the issue had already been settled previously.\nLee has been criticized for his representation of women. For example, bell hooks said that he wrote black women in the same objectifying way that white male filmmakers write the characters of white women. Rosie Perez, who was in an acting role for the first time as Tina in \"Do the Right Thing\", said later that she was very uncomfortable with doing the nude scene in the film, saying, \"I had a big problem with it, mainly because I was afraid of what my family would think...It wasn't really about taking off my clothes. But I also didn't feel good about it because the atmosphere wasn't correct.\" Subsequently, Perez stated that Lee had offered an apology, and the two maintained their friendship.\nOver the course of his career Spike Lee has defended Woody Allen, Michael Jackson and Nate Parker, all of whom have been accused of sexual misconduct.\nAwards and honors.\nIn 1983, Lee won the Student Academy Award for his film \"Joe's Bed-Stuy Barbershop: We Cut Heads\". He won awards at the Black Reel Awards for \"Love and Basketball\", the Black Movie Awards for \"Inside Man\", and the Berlin International Film Festival for \"Get on the Bus\". He won BAFTA Award for Best Adapted Screenplay for \"BlacKkKlansman\".\nLee was nominated for Academy Awards for Best Original Screenplay for \"Do the Right Thing\" and Best Documentary for \"4 Little Girls\", but did not win either award. In 2015, at the age of 58, Lee became the youngest person ever to receive an Honorary Academy Award. Lee received the award as \"a champion of independent film and an inspiration to young filmmakers\". Frequent collaborators Denzel Washington, Samuel L. Jackson, and Wesley Snipes presented Lee with the award at a private ceremony at the Governors Awards. In 2019, Lee's film \"BlacKkKlansman\" went on to receive six Academy Award nominations. Lee himself was nominated for three; Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Adapted Screenplay. He went on to win the Best Adapted Screenplay, his first Academy Award.\nTwo of his films have competed for the Palme d'Or award at the Cannes Film Festival, and of the two, \"BlacKkKlansman\" won the Grand Prix in 2018. Lee's films \"Do the Right Thing\", \"Malcolm X\", \"4 Little Girls\", \"She's Gotta Have It\", and \"Bamboozled\" were each selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the National Film Registry for being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". On May 18, 2016, Lee delivered the Commencement address for The Johns Hopkins University Class of 2016.\nHe has been named as the recipient of the Ebert Director Award at the TIFF Tribute Awards for the 2023 Toronto International Film Festival. In March 2024, Lee received a Board of Governor's Award from the American Society of Cinematographers. In October of 2025, he accepted a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Chicago International Film Festival.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

His work includes films, commercials, music videos, skateboard videos and television.\nJonze began his career as a teenager photographing BMX riders and skateboarders for \"Freestylin' Magazine\" and \"Transworld Skateboarding\", and co-founding the youth culture magazine \"Dirt\". Moving into filmmaking, he began shooting street skateboarding films, including the influential \"Video Days\" (1991). Jonze co-founded the skateboard company Girl Skateboards in 1993 with riders Rick Howard and Mike Carroll. Jonze's filmmaking style made him an in-demand director of music videos for much of the 1990s and early 2000s, resulting in collaborations with R.E.M., Sonic Youth, Beastie Boys, Ween, Fatboy Slim, Daft Punk, Weezer, Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Bj\u00f6rk, Fatlip, Arcade Fire and Kanye West.\nJonze began his feature film directing career with \"Being John Malkovich\" (1999) and \"Adaptation\" (2002), both written by Charlie Kaufman; the former earned Jonze an Academy Award nomination for Best Director. He was a co-creator and executive producer of MTV's \"Jackass\" reality franchise. Jonze later began directing films based on his own screenplays, including \"Where the Wild Things Are\" (2009) and \"Her\" (2013); for the latter film, he won the Academy Award, Golden Globe, and the Writers Guild of America Award for Best Original Screenplay, while receiving Academy Award nominations for Best Picture and Best Original Song (\"The Moon Song\").\nHe has worked as an actor sporadically throughout his career, co-starring in David O. Russell's war comedy \"Three Kings\" (1999) and appearing in supporting roles in Bennett Miller's \"Moneyball\" (2011) and Martin Scorsese's \"The Wolf of Wall Street\" (2013), in addition to a recurring role in comedy series \"The Increasingly Poor Decisions of Todd Margaret\" (2010\u20132012) and cameo appearances in his own films. Jonze co-founded Directors Label, with filmmakers Chris Cunningham and Michel Gondry, and the Palm Pictures company. He is currently the creative director of Vice Media, Inc. and its multinational television channel Vice TV.\nEarly life and education.\nAdam Spiegel was born on October 22, 1969, in New York City, the son of Arthur H. Spiegel III and Sandra L. Granzow. His father was of German Jewish ancestry. Jonze is the great-grandson of Arthur Spiegel and the great-great-grandson of Joseph Spiegel, founder of the Spiegel catalog. Arthur H. Spiegel III was the founder of a healthcare consulting firm. Jonze's parents divorced when he was a young child and his father remarried. Jonze was raised by his mother in Bethesda, Maryland, where she worked in public relations, along with his brother Sam \"Squeak E. Clean\" Spiegel, who is now a producer and DJ, and his sister Julia. While studying at Walt Whitman High School, Jonze spent much of his time at a Bethesda community store, where owner Mike Henderson gave him the nickname \"Spike Jonze\" in reference to the satirical bandleader Spike Jones. While in high school, Jonze was close friends with future Jackass co-creator Jeff Tremaine. They became friends through their shared interest in BMX.\nA keen BMX rider, Jonze began working at the Rockville BMX store in Rockville, Maryland, at the age of 16. A common destination for touring professional BMX teams, Jonze began photographing BMX demos at Rockville and formed a friendship with \"Freestylin' Magazine\" editors Mark Lewman and Andy Jenkins. Impressed with Jonze's photography work, the pair offered him a job as a photographer for the magazine, and he subsequently moved to California to pursue career opportunities in photography. Jonze fronted \"Club Homeboy\", an international BMX club, alongside Lewman and Jenkins. The three also created the youth culture magazines \"Homeboy\" and \"Dirt\", the latter of which was spun off from the female-centered \"Sassy\" and was aimed towards young boys.\nCareer.\n1985\u20131993: Photography, magazines, and early video work.\nWhile shooting for various BMX publications in California, Jonze was introduced to a number of professional skateboarders who often shared ramps with BMX pros. Jonze formed a close friendship with Mark Gonzales, co-owner of the newly formed Blind Skateboards at the time, and began shooting photos with the young Blind team including Jason Lee, Guy Mariano and Rudy Johnson in the late 1980s. Jonze became a regular contributor to \"Transworld Skateboarding\" and was subsequently given a job at World Industries by Steve Rocco, who enlisted him to photograph advertisements and shoot promotional videos for his brands under the World Industries umbrella. Jonze filmed, edited and produced his first skateboarding video, \"Rubbish Heap\", for World Industries in 1989. His following video project was \"Video Days\", a promotional video for Blind Skateboards, which was released in 1991 and is considered to be highly influential in the community. The video's subject, Gonzales, presented a copy of \"Video Days\" to Kim Gordon during a chance encounter following a Sonic Youth show in early 1992. Impressed with Jonze's videography skills, Gordon asked him to direct a music video featuring skateboarders. The video, co-directed by Jonze and Tamra Davis, was for their 1992 single \"100%\", which featured skateboarding footage of Blind Skateboards rider Jason Lee, who later became a successful actor. In 1993, Jonze co-directed the \"trippy\" music video for The Breeders song \"Cannonball\" with Gordon.\nAlong with Rick Howard and Mike Carroll, Jonze co-founded the skateboard company Girl Skateboards in 1993. The following year, he directed the video for the Weezer song \"Buddy Holly\", which featured the band performing the song interspersed with clips from the sitcom \"Happy Days\". The video became immensely popular and was shown frequently on MTV. A 2013 \"Rolling Stone\" readers' poll ranked it as the tenth best music video of the 1990s. Also in 1994, Jonze directed the videos for the Beastie Boys' songs \"Sure Shot\" and, more famously, \"Sabotage\". The latter parodies 1970s cop shows and is presented as the opening credits for a fictional show called \"Sabotage\", featuring the band members appearing as its protagonists. As with \"Buddy Holly\", the video attracted great popularity and was in \"near-constant rotation on MTV.\" In the same year, Jonze also directed videos for the hip hop group Marxman, The Breeders, Dinosaur Jr., and another Weezer song, \"Undone \u2013 The Sweater Song\". Jonze made his film debut as an actor in a bit part in the drama \"Mi Vida Loca\" (1994). In 1995, he was attached to direct an adaptation of \"Harold and the Purple Crayon\".\n1995\u20131999: In demand video director and \"Being John Malkovich\".\nJonze collaborated with Bj\u00f6rk for the video for her 1995 single \"It's Oh So Quiet\", a cover of a 1951 Betty Hutton song. The video is set in an auto shop and sees Bj\u00f6rk dancing and singing to the song in the style of a musical, inspired by Jacques Demy's \"The Umbrellas of Cherbourg\". In the same year, he also directed a television commercial titled \"Guerrilla Tennis\" for Nike featuring tennis players Andre Agassi and Pete Sampras participating in a match in the middle of an intersection in Manhattan, the \"rapid-paced\" title sequence for the sitcom \"Double Rush\" and worked on videos for R.E.M., Sonic Youth and Ween. Jonze sole video directing credit of 1996 was for The Pharcyde's \"Drop\", which was filmed backwards and then reversed. In 1997, Jonze made a short film called \"How They Get There\", starring Mark Gonzales as a man who is playfully imitating a woman's actions on the other side of a sidewalk before running into danger. Jonze worked with the electronic music duo Daft Punk on the music video for the instrumental song \"Da Funk\" in 1997. The clip, titled \"Big City Nights\", follows an anthropomorphic \"man-dog\" wandering the streets of New York City. His video for the Chemical Brothers's \"Elektrobank\" (1997) starred his future wife Sofia Coppola as a gymnast. Throughout 1997, he also worked on videos for R.E.M., Pavement, Puff Daddy, and The Notorious B.I.G. He made a cameo appearance as a paramedic in David Fincher's film \"The Game\" (1997).\nJonze filmed a short documentary in 1997, \"Amarillo by Morning\", about two Texan boys who aspire to be bull riders. He was also one of the cinematographers for the documentary \"Free Tibet\", which documents the 1996 Tibetan Freedom Concert in San Francisco. His 1998 commercial for Sprite is considered an example of subvertising for its spoof take on the brand's mascot. Jonze developed an alter ego named Richard Koufey, the leader of the Torrance Community Dance Group, an urban troupe that performs in public spaces. The Koufey persona appeared when Jonze, in character, filmed himself dancing to Fatboy Slim's \"Praise You\" as it played on a boom box in a public area. Jonze showed the video to Slim, who appears briefly in the video. Jonze then assembled a group of dancers to perform to Slim's \"Praise You\" outside a Westwood, California, movie theater and taped the performance. The resulting clip was a huge success, and \"Koufey\" and his troupe were invited to New York City to perform the song for the 1999 MTV Video Music Awards. The video received awards for Best Direction, Breakthrough, and Best Choreography, which Jonze accepted, still in character. Jonze made a short mockumentary about the experience called \"Torrance Rises\" (1999).\nThe first feature film Jonze directed was \"Being John Malkovich\" in 1999. It stars John Cusack, Cameron Diaz, and Catherine Keener, with John Malkovich as himself. The screenplay was written by Charlie Kaufman and follows a puppeteer who finds a portal in an office that leads to the mind of actor John Malkovich. Kaufman's script was passed on to Jonze by his father-in-law Francis Ford Coppola and he agreed to direct it, \"delighted by its originality and labyrinthine plot\". \"Being John Malkovich\" was released in October 1999 to laudatory reviews; the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" critic Roger Ebert found the film to be \"endlessly inventive\" and named it the best film of 1999, while Owen Gleiberman of \"Entertainment Weekly\" called it the \"most excitingly original movie of the year\". At the 72nd Academy Awards, the film was nominated for Best Director, Best Original Screenplay and Best Supporting Actress for Keener. Jonze co-starred opposite George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg and Ice Cube in David O. Russell's war comedy \"Three Kings\" (1999), which depicts a gold heist by four U.S. soldiers following the end of the Gulf War. Jonze's role in the film, the sweet, dimwitted, casually racist PFC Conrad Vig, was written specifically for him. Jonze also directed a commercial for Nike called \"The Morning After\" in 1999, a parody of the hysteria surrounding Y2K.\n2000\u20132008: \"Adaptation\" and \"Jackass\".\nJonze returned to video directing in 2000, helming the video for the song \"Wonderboy\" by the comedy duo Tenacious D. Along with Johnny Knoxville and childhood friend Jeff Tremaine, Jonze co-created, executive produced and occasionally appeared in the television series \"Jackass\" in 2000, which aired on MTV for three seasons until 2002. The show featured a group of people performing dangerous stunts and pranks on each other. At the request of Al Gore's presidential campaign in 2000, Jonze directed a short video about Gore at his home. The video was shown at the Democratic National Convention. He collaborated with Fatboy Slim for a second time in 2001, directing the video for \"Weapon of Choice\", starring Christopher Walken dancing around a deserted hotel lobby. The video won multiple awards at the 2001 MTV Video Music Awards and the 2002 Grammy Award for Best Music Video. Jonze's second film, the comedy-drama \"Adaptation,\" (2002), was partially based on the non-fiction book \"The Orchid Thief\" by Susan Orlean and was written by Charlie Kaufman. The metafilm starred Nicolas Cage in a dual role as Kaufman and his fictional twin brother, Donald, as he attempts to adapt \"The Orchid Thief\" into a film and features dramatized events from the book. It co-starred Meryl Streep as Orlean and Chris Cooper as the subject of \"The Orchid Thief\", John Laroche. \"Adaptation.\" was met with widespread critical acclaim from critics, who praised it for its originality whilst simultaneously being funny and thought-provoking.\n\"\", a continuation of the television show, was released in October 2002. Jonze co-produced, contributed to the writing of the segments, and made a cameo appearance in the film. Jonze directed a 60-second commercial called \"Lamp\" for the furniture store IKEA in 2002, which won the Grand Prix at the Cannes Lions International Advertising Festival, considered a prestigious award in the field of advertising. Also in 2002, Jonze directed the Levi's commercial \"Crazy Legs\" and the videos for Beck's \"Guess I'm Doing Fine\", Bj\u00f6rk's \"It's in Our Hands\" (filmed in night vision), and one of two versions of Weezer's \"Island in the Sun\". Jonze co-directed the Girl Skateboards video \"Yeah Right!\" in 2003, which featured extensive use of special effects and a cameo by Owen Wilson. That same year, he directed the video for Turbonegro's single \"Sell Your Body (to the Night)\" which featured appearances by the members of Jackass.\nJonze co-founded \"Directors Label\" \u2013 a series of DVDs devoted to music video directors \u2013 in September 2003 with filmmakers Chris Cunningham and Michel Gondry. Jonze's volume, \"The Work of Director Spike Jonze\", was released in October and comprises his videos, as well as photographs, drawings and interviews. Jonze made a faux documentary called \"The Mystery of Dalar\u00f6\" in 2004 as part of an advertising campaign for the Volvo S40. The film was credited to a fictional Venezuelan director named Carlos Soto, but was later revealed to have been directed by Jonze. He directed a commercial for Adidas titled \"Hello Tomorrow\" in 2005, featuring the music of his brother Sam \"Squeak E. Clean\" Spiegel and Jonze's then-girlfriend Karen O of the band Yeah Yeah Yeahs.\nAfter directing videos for Ludacris and Yeah Yeah Yeahs' \"Y Control\" (which caused some controversy over its graphic images), Jonze collaborated with Bj\u00f6rk for a third time on the playful music video for \"Triumph of a Heart\" (2005), in which her husband was played by a housecat. The second \"Jackass\" film, \"Jackass Number Two\", was released in 2006 and saw Jonze dress as an old lady whose breasts \"accidentally\" keep becoming exposed while wandering around Los Angeles. Along with Dave Eggers, he had a speaking part in the Beck song \"The Horrible Fanfare/Landslide/Exoskeleton\" from his 2006 album \"The Information\". In 2007, he became the creative director of VBS.tv, an online television network supplied by Vice and funded by MTV. Jonze hosted his own interview show on the service. He directed ads for GAP and Levi's, and co-directed the skateboarding video \"Fully Flared\" with Ty Evans and Cory Weincheque in the same year. Jonze directed the music video for Kanye West's single \"Flashing Lights\" in 2008. Filmed entirely in slow motion, the video stars West and model Rita G, and sees her driving around the Las Vegas, Nevada, desert in a Ford Mustang before stopping to repeatedly stab West, who is tied up in the trunk. Jonze produced Charlie Kaufman's directorial debut \"Synecdoche, New York\" in 2008, which Jonze originally intended to direct.\n2009\u20132019: \"Where the Wild Things Are\", short films, and \"Her\".\n\"Where the Wild Things Are\" (2009), a film adaptation of Maurice Sendak children's picture book of the same name, was directed by Jonze and co-written by Jonze and Dave Eggers, who expanded the original ten-sentence book into a feature film. Sendak gave advice to Jonze while he was adapting the book and the two developed a friendship. The film stars Max Records as Max, a misunderstood 8-year-old boy who runs away from home after an fight with his mother (played by Catherine Keener) and goes away to an island inhabited by creatures known as the \"Wild Things,\" who declare Max their king. The Wild Things were played by performers in creature suits, while CG was required to animate their faces. James Gandolfini, Lauren Ambrose, Chris Cooper, Forest Whitaker, Catherine O'Hara, Paul Dano, and Michael Berry Jr. provided the voices for the Wild Things, and Jonze voiced two owls named Bob and Terry. The film's soundtrack was composed by Karen O and composer Carter Burwell scored his third film for Jonze. \"Where the Wild Things Are\" was released in October 2009 to a generally positive critical reception but did not perform well at the box office. Some reviewers were unsure whether the film was intended for a younger or adult audience due to its dark tone and level of maturity. Jonze himself said that he \"didn't set out to make a children's movie; I set out to make a movie about childhood\". A television documentary, \"\", co-directed by Jonze and Lance Bangs, aired in 2009 and features a series of interviews with Sendak. Jonze wrote and directed \"We Were Once a Fairytale\" (2009), a short film starring Kanye West as himself acting belligerently while drunk in a nightclub.\nJonze wrote and directed the science fiction romance short film \"I'm Here\" in 2010, based on the children's book \"The Giving Tree\". The film stars Andrew Garfield as a robot with a head shaped like an old PC who falls in love with a more sleekly-designed female robot, played by Sienna Guillory. Jonze produced and provided his voice to a character in the short film \"Higglety Pigglety Pop! or There Must Be More to Life\" (2010), based on Maurice Sendak's book of the same name. He co-directed the video for LCD Soundsystem's \"Drunk Girls\" with the band's frontman James Murphy and directed the video for Arcade Fire's \"The Suburbs\" in 2010, the latter being an edited version of Jonze's short film \"Scenes from the Suburbs\" (2011), a dystopian vision of suburbia in the near-future and an expansion of the themes of nostalgia, alienation, and childhood found in the song. A third \"Jackass\" film, \"Jackass 3D\", premiered in 2010. He was part of the main cast for the black comedy series \"The Increasingly Poor Decisions of Todd Margaret\" as the supervisor to David Cross' character for the first two seasons in 2010 and 2012, before being replaced by Jack McBrayer in the third season. Jonze resumed his longtime collaboration with the Beastie Boys in July 2011, directing the video for their song featuring Santigold, \"Don't Play No Game That I Can't Win\", in which the band members are portrayed as action figures. He then directed the video for Kanye West and Jay-Z's 2011 single \"Otis\", which saw the pair driving a customized Maybach 57 around an industrial lot. Along with Simon Cahn, Jonze co-directed the stop-motion animated short film \"Mourir Aupr\u00e8s De Toi\" (2011), which is set in the Shakespeare and Company bookstore in Paris. Jonze voiced a skeletal Macbeth in the film. Also in 2011, Jonze played a small supporting role in the sports drama \"Moneyball\" as the husband of Robin Wright's character, who is the ex-wife of Billy Beane (played by Brad Pitt). In 2012, Jonze co-directed the feature-length skateboarding film \"Pretty Sweet\" with his \"Fully Flared\" co-directors Ty Evans and Cory Weincheque.\nJonze's fourth feature film, the romantic science fiction drama \"Her\", was released in December 2013. The film was his first original screenplay and the first he had written alone, inspired by Charlie Kaufman by putting \"all the ideas and feelings at that time\" into his script for \"Synecdoche, New York\". It stars Joaquin Phoenix, Amy Adams, Rooney Mara, Olivia Wilde, and Scarlett Johansson. The film follows the recently divorced Theodore Twombly (Phoenix), a man who develops a relationship with a seemingly intuitive and humanistic female voice, named \"Samantha\" (Johansson), produced by an advanced computer operating system. Samantha was originally voiced by Samantha Morton during its production, but was later replaced by Johansson. Jonze provided his voice to a video game character in the film, Alien Child, who interacts with Theodore. The film's score was composed by Arcade Fire and Owen Pallett.\n\"Her\" was met with universal acclaim from critics. Todd McCarthy of \"The Hollywood Reporter\" praised Jonze for taking an old theme \"the search for love and the need to 'only connect'\" and embracing it \"in a speculative way that feels very pertinent to the moment and captures the emotional malaise of a future just an intriguing step or two ahead of contemporary reality.\" Scott Foundas of \"Variety\" opined that it was Jonze's \"richest and most emotionally mature work to date\". At the 86th Academy Awards, Jonze was nominated for three Academy Awards for \"Her\", winning for Best Original Screenplay and receiving further nominations for Best Picture and Best Original Song for co-writing \"The Moon Song\" with Karen O. Jonze won the Golden Globe Award for Best Screenplay at the 71st Golden Globe Awards.\nJonze co-wrote, co-produced, and appeared in \"\" (2013), a hidden camera comedy film starring Johnny Knoxville as the vulgar grandfather Irvin Zisman. Jonze played his wife Gloria, but was cut from a majority of the film. Jonze served as the creative director of the YouTube Music Awards on November 3, 2013. At the ceremony, he directed the live music video for Arcade Fire's \"Afterlife\", documented Lady Gaga's live performance of \"Dope\" with Chris Milk, and premiered a short film written by Lena Dunham that Jonze directed called \"Choose You\". Jonze had a small role in Martin Scorsese's 2013 film \"The Wolf of Wall Street\" as a stockbroker who teaches Jordan Belfort (played by Leonardo DiCaprio) the ins and outs of penny stocks. Jonze got the part as the film shared the same casting director as \"Her\", who asked Jonze if he wanted to appear in the film. He directed the video for Kanye West's \"Only One\" in 2015, which was filmed on his iPhone in a foggy field and featured heartfelt interactions between West and daughter. Jonze made a guest appearance in the fourth season of Lena Dunham's television series \"Girls\" in March 2015. Jonze directed the short commercial film \"Kenzo World\" to promote a fragrance by Kenzo in 2016. The film starred Margaret Qualley as a woman erratically dancing around a large mansion, with choreography by Ryan Heffington. Jonze is the creative director of multinational television channel brand Viceland, which launched in February 2016.\nIn 2017, Jonze directed Frank Ocean's summer festival tour, which included 8 shows which took place in different cities around the US and Europe. Jonze also produced and decorated, alongside Ocean and artist Tom Sachs among others, an elaborate stage with a runway and central platform for the same concert. Jonze wrote and directed the stage show \"Changers: A Dance Story\", starring Lakeith Stanfield and Mia Wasikowska. Featuring dance choreography by Ryan Heffington, the show premiered at an Opening Ceremony fashion week presentation in September 2017 before opening to the public for a four-night run at the La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club. Jonze produced the documentary ' (2017), which documents the production of the film \"Man on the Moon\" (1999). The following year, he directed the short commercial film \"Welcome Home\" for Apple's HomePod devices, starring FKA Twigs dancing inside her apartment as its transforms into a surreal space and engages in a dance off with her doppelg\u00e4nger. In 2019, Jonze directed a commercial and accompanying short film for the website building service Squarespace starring Idris Elba, as well a short film titled \"The New Normal\" advocating for marijuana legalization in partnership with the cannabis company MedMen. In that year, Jonze also filmed the Aziz Ansari stand-up special ', operating close-up shots himself onstage. He won two consecutive Directors Guild of America Awards for his commercial work in 2018 and 2019.\n2020\u2013present: \"Beastie Boys Story\".\nJonze directed the \"Beastie Boys Story: As Told by Michael Diamond &amp; Adam Horovitz\" stage show, which took place in Philadelphia and Brooklyn for three nights in 2019 and saw the band's two surviving members tell the story of the Beastie Boys and their friendship. A feature-length documentary, \"Beastie Boys Story\", was also directed by Jonze and features footage from the shows. It was released on Apple TV+ in 2020 to positive reviews. He returned to acting in Damien Chazelle's 2022 film \"Babylon\", appearing as a German film director bearing a resemblance to Erich von Stroheim.\nIn early 2023, it was reported that Jonze had started working on a television series for Netflix with Brad Pitt and Joaquin Phoenix attached. However, the project was scrapped after he left it in October 2024.\nPersonal life.\nOn June 26, 1999, Jonze married director Sofia Coppola, whom he had first met in 1992 on the set of the music video for Sonic Youth's \"100%\". On December\u00a05, 2003, the couple filed for divorce, citing \"irreconcilable differences\". The character of John, a career-driven photographer (played by Giovanni Ribisi) in Coppola's \"Lost in Translation\" (2003), was rumored to be based on Jonze, though Coppola commented \"It's not Spike, but there are elements of him there, elements of experiences.\"\nJonze dated singer Karen O throughout 2005, although the couple broke up shortly after. \"People\" reported that Jonze dated actress Drew Barrymore in 2007. From 2008 to 2009, Jonze dated actress Michelle Williams, with whom he worked on \"Synecdoche, New York\". Jonze was reported to have begun dating Japanese actress Rinko Kikuchi in 2010 and the couple briefly lived together in New York City. They separated in 2011.\nBeginning in 2019, Jonze was in a relationship with artist Allie Teilz, whom he met in 2013 on the set of \"Her\". They had three sons: twins born in 2023 and another in 2024.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The island is around west of the coast of southwestern Angola, and east of the major seaport city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in South America. It is one of the three constituent parts of Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha, a British overseas territory.\nSaint Helena measures about and had a population of 4,439 in the 2021 census. It was named after Saint Helena (AD c.246/248\u2013330), the mother of the Roman Emperor Constantine I the Great. (A.D 272\u2013337, reigned 306\u2013337), of the ancient Roman Empire. It is one of the most remote major islands in the world and was uninhabited until the 16th century, when it was discovered by the Portuguese explorers/traders en route southward around the continent of Africa, then east across the Indian Ocean to the Indian subcontinent (India) of South Asia in 1502. For about the next four centuries, the island was an important stopover for ships between Europe and Asia sailing around the African continent and its southern Cape of Good Hope, before the opening of the shortcut Suez Canal in 1869, in Egypt between the Mediterranean and Red Seas. Saint Helena is the United Kingdom's second-oldest overseas territory of the old British Empire, after the islands of Bermuda, off the southeast coast of North America. \nThe primary method of reaching Saint Helena is by its remote airport. It is also served by cargo ships.\nSaint Helena is known for being the site of the second period of exile of Napoleon Bonaparte, from his defeat at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815 until his death there six years later.\nHistory.\nDiscovery.\nAccording to long-established tradition, the island was sighted on 21 May 1502 by the four ships of the 3rd Portuguese Armada, commanded by Jo\u00e3o da Nova, a Galician navigator in the service of Portugal, during his return voyage to Lisbon, who named it Santa Helena after Saint Helena of Constantinople. This tradition was reviewed by a 2022 paper which concluded that the Portuguese chronicles published at least fifty years after the sighting are the sole primary source for the discovery. Although contradictory in describing other events, these chronicles almost unanimously claim that Jo\u00e3o da Nova found Saint Helena sometime in 1502, although none of them gives a precise date.\nHowever, there are several reasons to doubt that da Nova made this discovery:\nThe 2022 paper also reviews cartographic evidence that Saint Helena and Ascension were known to the Spanish in 1500, before either Jo\u00e3o da Nova or Est\u00eav\u00e3o da Gama sailed for India. The suggestion that da Nova discovered Tristan da Cunha and named it Saint Helena is discounted.\nA 2015 paper notes that 21 May is the feast day of St Helena in the Eastern Orthodox and most Protestant churches, but the Roman Catholic one is in August, and the day and the month were first quoted in 1596 by Jan Huyghen van Linschoten, who was probably mistaken, because the island was discovered several decades before the Reformation and the start of Linschoten's Protestant faith. An alternative discovery date of 3 May is suggested as being historically more credible; it is the Catholic feast day of the finding of the True Cross by Saint Helena in Jerusalem, and cited by Odoardo Duarte Lopes and Sir Thomas Herbert.\nWhen Linschoten arrived at the island on 12 May 1589, he reported seeing carvings made by visiting seamen on a fig tree that were dated as early as 1510. The Portuguese probably planted saplings rather than mature trees, and for these to be sufficiently large by 1510 to carry carvings suggests the plants were shipped to the island and planted there some years earlier, possibly within a few years of discovery.\nA third discovery story, told by 16th-century historian Gaspar Correia, holds that the island was found by Portuguese nobleman and warrior Dom Garcia de Noronha, who sighted the island on his way to India in late 1511 or early 1512. His pilots entered the island onto their charts, and this event likely led to the island being used as a regular stopover for rest and replenishment for ships en route from India to Europe, from that date until well into the 17th century. An analysis has been published of the Portuguese ships arriving at Saint Helena in the period 1502\u20131613.\nExploitation of the island.\nThe Portuguese found the island uninhabited, with an abundance of trees and fresh water. They imported livestock, fruit trees, and vegetables, and built a chapel and one or two houses. The long tradition that Jo\u00e3o da Nova built a chapel from one of his wrecked carracks has been shown to be based on a misreading of the records. They formed no permanent settlement, but the island was an important rendezvous point and source of food for ships travelling by the Cape Route from Asia to Europe, and frequently sick mariners were left on the island to recover before taking passage on the next ship to call at the island.\nVisits by British explorers followed and, once Saint Helena's location was more widely known, British privateers began to lie in wait in the area to attack Mughal-laden Portuguese India carracks returning from the East Indies.\nIn developing their Far East trade, the Dutch also began to frequent the island. The Portuguese and Spanish soon gave up regularly calling at the island, partly because they used ports along the West African coast, but also because of attacks on their shipping, the desecration of their chapel and religious icons, killings of their livestock, and destruction of their plantations by Dutch pirates.\nThe Dutch Republic formally claimed Saint Helena in 1633, although no evidence indicates they ever occupied it. The Dutch lost interest in the island after establishing their colony at the Cape of Good Hope.\nEast India Company (1658\u20131815).\nIn 1657, Oliver Cromwell granted the East India Company (EIC) a charter to govern Saint\u00a0Helena. The following year, the company decided to fortify the island and settle it with planters. A theory, which had its origins in the early 20th century, that the early settlers included many who had lost their homes in the 1666 Great Fire of London, was shown to be a myth in 1999.\nThe first governor, Captain John Dutton, arrived in 1659, making Saint\u00a0Helena one of Britain's earliest colonies outside Europe, North America and the Caribbean. A fort and houses were built: Jamestown had been founded, \"in the narrow valley between steep cliffs\".\nAfter the Restoration of the Stuart monarchy in the kingdoms of England, Scotland and Ireland in 1660, the EIC received a royal charter, giving it the sole right to fortify and colonise the island. The fort was renamed James Fort and the town was called Jamestown, in honour of the Duke of York, later King James II.\nBetween January and May 1673, the Dutch East India Company seized the island, but British reinforcements restored EIC control. The island was fortified with about 230 gun turrets.\nThe British government sent some settlers and gave them land that they could farm, but the company found it hard to attract enough settlers, despite advertisements in London and free tracts of land. By 1670, the population was only 66, including slaves. Also unrest and rebellion occurred among the inhabitants. Ecological problems, such as deforestation, soil erosion, vermin, and drought, led Governor Isaac Pyke to suggest in 1715 that the population be moved to Mauritius, but that was not acted upon. The company continued to subsidise the community because of the island's strategic location. A census in 1723 recorded 1,110 inhabitants, including 610 slaves.\nIn the peak era, about 1,000 ships per year stopped there, leaving the governor to try to police the numerous visitors and to limit the consumption of arrack, a distilled alcoholic drink made from potatoes. There were two mutinies, perhaps fueled by alcohol. Because Jamestown was \"too raucous with its taverns and brothels\", St Paul's Cathedral was built outside the town.\nEighteenth-century governors tried to tackle the island's problems by planting trees, improving fortifications, eliminating corruption, building a hospital, tackling the neglect of crops and livestock, controlling the consumption of alcohol, and introducing legal reforms. The island enjoyed a lengthy period of prosperity from about 1770. Captain James Cook visited the island in 1775 on the final leg of his second circumnavigation of the world. St. James' Church was built in Jamestown in 1774, and Plantation House in 1791\u201392; the latter has since been the official residence of the governor.\nEdmond Halley visited Saint Helena on leaving the University of Oxford in 1676, and set up an astronomical observatory with a aerial telescope, intending to study the stars of the Southern Hemisphere. The site of this telescope is near Saint Mathew's Church at Hutt's Gate in the Longwood district. The hill there is called Halley's Mount.\nThroughout that period, Saint Helena was an important port of call of the EIC. East Indiamen would stop there on the return leg of their voyages to British India and China. At Saint Helena, ships could replenish supplies of water and provisions and, during wartime, form convoys that would sail under the protection of vessels of the Royal Navy.\nJames Cook\u2019s ship anchored and resupplied off the coast of Saint Helena in May 1771 on its return from the European discovery of the east coast of Australia and the rediscovery of New Zealand.\nThe British brought an estimated 25,000 slaves from west Africa to the island, in addition to the 3,000,000 they transported to the New World. The importation of slaves was made illegal in 1792, but the horrific conditions of slavery on St Helena were not abolished until 27 May 1839, when the 'Ordinance For the Abolition of Slavery in the Island of St Helena' was enacted. Rupert's Valley was the embarkation area for slaves; in 2008, when the road to the airport was being built, over 9,000 skeletal remains of slaves were uncovered in a mass burial area. They were reburied en masse in 2022 without ceremony of any kind. Governor Robert Patton (1802\u20131807) recommended that the company import workers from China to supplement the rural workforce. Many were allowed to stay, and their descendants became integrated into the population. In 1810, Chinese labourers began arriving, and by 1818, there were 650 in St Helena. An 1814 census recorded 3,507 people on the island. Many of the labourers were allowed to stay, though the need for their services had reduced by 1836.\nBritish rule (1815\u20131821) and Napoleon's exile.\nIn 1815, the British government selected Saint Helena as the place of exile for Napoleon Bonaparte (1769\u20131821), following his defeat at Waterloo and subsequent abdication. He was taken to the island in October 1815. Napoleon stayed at the Briars pavilion, on the grounds of the Balcombe family's home, until his permanent residence at Longwood House was completed in December 1815. He died there five and half years later on 5 May 1821.\nBritish East India Company (1821\u20131834).\nFollowing Napoleon's death, the soldiers and other temporary residents linked to his presence on the island were withdrawn and the EIC resumed full control of Saint Helena. Between 1815 and 1830, the EIC made available to the government of the island the packet schooner , which made multiple trips per year between the island and the Cape, carrying passengers both ways and supplies of wine and provisions back to the island. \nThe importation of slaves to Saint Helena was banned in 1792. In 1818, the governor freed children born of slaves on the island. The phased emancipation of over 800 resident slaves took place in 1827, some six years before the British parliament passed legislation to abolish slavery in the colonies.\nBetween 1791 and 1833, Saint Helena became the site of a series of experiments in conservation, reforestation, and attempts to boost rainfall artificially. This environmental intervention was closely linked to the conceptualisation of the processes of environmental change and helped establish the roots of environmentalism.\nCrown colony (1834\u20131981).\nUnder the provisions of the 1833 India Act, control of Saint\u00a0Helena passed from the EIC to the British Crown, and it became a crown colony. Subsequent administrative cost-cutting triggered a long-term population decline; those who could afford to do so tended to leave the island for better opportunities elsewhere. The latter half of the 19th century saw the advent of steamships not reliant on trade winds, as well as the diversion of Far East trade away from the traditional South Atlantic shipping lanes to a route via the Red Sea (which, prior to the building of the Suez Canal, involved a short overland section).\nIn 1840, a British naval station established to suppress the Atlantic slave trade was based on the island, and between 1840 and 1849, over 15,000 freed slaves, known as \"Liberated Africans\", were landed there.\nIn 1858, French emperor Napoleon III purchased, in the name of the French government, Longwood House and the lands around it, the last residence of Napoleon I (who died there in 1821; his remains had been returned to France in 1840.) It is still French property, administered by a French representative and under the authority of the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\nA 2020 report states that the island's prosperity ended after 1869 when \"the Suez Canal shifted trade routes north\". A 2019 report explained that \"ships no longer needed a stopping point on a longer journey to Europe\". The number of ships calling at the island fell from 1,100 in 1855 to only 288 in 1889.\nOn 11 April 1898, American Joshua Slocum, on his solo round-the-world voyage, arrived at Jamestown. He departed on 20 April 1898 for the final leg of his circumnavigation, having been extended hospitality by the governor, R. A. Sterndale. He presented two lectures on his voyage and was invited to Longwood by the French consular agent.\nBy the end of 1899, St Helena was connected to London by undersea cable; this allowed for telegraph communication. In 1900 and 1901, over 6,000 Boer prisoners were held on the island, during the Second Anglo-Boer War. A 2019 report stated, \"no traces remain of the two POW camps\", but added, \"the Boer Cemetery is a poignant spot\". Among the notables were Piet Cronj\u00e9 and his wife after their defeat at the Battle of Paardeberg. The resulting population reached an all-time high of 9,850 in 1901. By 1911, however, that had declined to 3,520 people. In 1906, the British government withdrew the garrison; the island's economy suffered when spending by the soldiers stopped.\nA local industry manufacturing fibre from New Zealand flax was successfully re-established in 1907 and generated considerable income during the First World War. Ascension Island was made a dependency of Saint\u00a0Helena in 1922, and Tristan da Cunha followed in 1938. During the Second World War, the United States built Wideawake Airport on Ascension in 1942, but no military use was made of Saint\u00a0Helena except maintenance of its defences.\nAttendance at school became mandatory in 1942, for ages 5 to 15 in 1941, and the government took over control of the education system. The first secondary school opened in 1946. The American construction of Wideawake Airfield generated numerous jobs for St Helena; the sale of flax for rope also generated revenue for the island. However, the industry declined after 1951 because of transport costs and competition from synthetic fibres. The decision in 1965 by the British Post Office to use synthetic fibres for its mailbags was a further blow, contributing to the closure of the island's flax mills in 1965.\nFrom 1958, the Union-Castle shipping line gradually reduced its service calls to the island. Curnow Shipping, based in Avonmouth, replaced the Union-Castle Line mailship service in 1977, using the RMS \"St\u00a0Helena\", which was introduced in 1989.\n1981 to present.\nThe British Nationality Act 1981 reclassified Saint Helena and the other crown colonies as British Dependent Territories. For the next 20 years, many could find only low-paid work with the island government, and the only available employment outside Saint Helena was on the Falkland Islands and Ascension Island. The Development and Economic Planning Department (which still operates) was formed in 1988 to contribute to raising the living standards of the people of Saint Helena.\nThe Commission on Citizenship was established in 1992, restoring the islanders' rights including the right of abode. In 2002, the right to British citizenship was restored.\nIn 1989, the then Duke of York, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, launched the replacement RMS \"St\u00a0Helena\" to serve the island; the vessel was specially built for the Cardiff\u2013Cape Town route and featured a mixed cargo/passenger layout.\nThe Saint Helena Constitution took effect in 1989, and provided that the island would be governed by a governor, a commander-in-chief, and an elected executive and legislative council. In 2002, the British Overseas Territories Act 2002 granted full British citizenship to the islanders and renamed the dependent territories (including Saint Helena) the British Overseas Territories. In 2009, The St Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha Constitution Order 2009 gave all three equal status; the British Overseas Territory was renamed Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha.\nIn 2021, a ministerial system was introduced in Saint Helena after UK's approval of a constitutional amendment.\nIn January 2024, Prince Edward, Duke of Edinburgh visited the island. \"Prince Edward is the first royal trip to the island since Princess Anne, the Princess Royal visited in 2002. Other royal guests include King George VI, Queen Elizabeth II, Prince Philip, Princess Margaret and The Queen Mother.\" While there, he visited Jonathan, a 191-year old tortoise, confirmed by the Guinness World Records to be the oldest living land animal. He toured the island, met residents, ceremonially opened the island's airport, and gave an address in the island's capital, Jamestown.\nGeography.\nSituated in the South Atlantic Ocean on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, more than from the nearest major landmass, Saint Helena is remote. The nearest port on the continent is Mo\u00e7\u00e2medes in southern Angola; connections to Cape Town, South Africa are used for most shipping needs via the regular cargo ship that serves the island, the MS \"Helena\".\nThe island is on the same ridge as two other islands in the southern Atlantic, also British territories: Ascension Island, about due north-west in more equatorial waters, and Tristan da Cunha, which is outside the tropics to the south. The island, in the Western Hemisphere, has the same longitude as Land's End (west Cornwall, England), and western Spain. For sharing several trading patterns, and climate effect traits, the island is grouped under West Africa/Africa in most projects, committees and papers of the United Nations.\nThe island is in area, and is composed largely of rugged terrain of volcanic origin (the last volcanic eruptions occurred about 7\u00a0million years ago). Coastal areas are scattered with vegetation on volcanic rock and are warmer and drier than the centre. The highest point of the island is Diana's Peak at . In 1996 it became the island's first national park. Much of the island is covered by New Zealand flax, a legacy of former industry, but there are some original trees augmented by plantations, including those of the Millennium Forest project, which was established in 2002 to replant, particularly with indigenous gumwood, part of the lost Great Wood and is now managed by the Saint Helena National Trust.\nWhen the island was discovered, it was covered with unique indigenous vegetation, including a remarkable cabbage tree species. The island's interior must have been a dense tropical forest but the coastal areas were probably also quite green. The modern landscape is very different, with widespread bare rock in the lower areas, although inland it is green, mainly due to introduced vegetation. There are no native land mammals, but cattle, cats, dogs, donkeys, goats, mice, rabbits, rats and sheep have been introduced. The dramatic change in landscape must be attributed to these introductions. As a result, the string tree (\"Acalypha rubrinervis\") and the Saint Helena olive (\"Nesiota elliptica\") are now extinct, and many of the other endemic plants are threatened with extinction.\nSome 22 named rocks and islets are offshore: Castle Rock, Speery Island, the Needle, Lower Black Rock, Upper Black Rock (South), Bird Island (Southwest), Black Rock, Thompson's Valley Island, Peaked Island, Egg Island, Lady's Chair, Lighter Rock (West), Long Ledge (Northwest), Shore Island, George Island, Rough Rock Island, Flat Rock (East), the Buoys, Sandy Bay Island, the Chimney, White Bird Island and Frightus Rock (Southeast) \u2013 all within of the shore.\nThe national bird of Saint Helena is the Saint Helena plover, known locally as the wirebird, on account of its wire-like legs. It appears on the coat of arms of Saint Helena and on the flag.\nClimate.\nThe climate of Saint Helena is tropical, marine and mild, tempered by the Benguela Current and trade winds that blow almost continuously. The climate varies noticeably across the island. Temperatures in Jamestown, on the north leeward shore, are in the range in the summer (January to April) and during the remainder of the year. The temperatures in the central areas are, on average, lower. Jamestown also has a very low annual rainfall, while falls per year on the higher ground and the south coast, where it is also noticeably cloudier. There are weather recording stations in the Longwood and Blue Hill districts.\nAdministrative divisions.\nSaint Helena is divided into eight districts, with the majority housing a community centre. The districts also serve as statistical divisions. The island is a single electoral area and elects 12 representatives to the Legislative Council of 15.\nThe difference between the total population of the Administrative Districts and that recorded in the 2016 Census arises because the census included 183 people on board the RMS St. Helena and 13 people who were on yachts in the harbour.\nPopulation.\nDemographics.\nSaint Helena was first settled by the English in 1659. As of January 2018[ [update]], the island had a population of 4,897 inhabitants, mainly descended from people from Britain, settlers (\"planters\") and soldiers, and slaves who were brought there from the beginning of settlement, initially from Africa (the Cape Verde Islands, Gold Coast and west coast of Africa are mentioned in early records), then India and Madagascar. The importation of slaves was made illegal in 1792.\nIn 1840, Saint Helena became a provisioning station for the British West Africa Squadron, preventing the transportation of slaves to Brazil (mainly), and many thousands of slaves were freed on the island. These were all African, and about 500 stayed while the rest were sent on to the West Indies and Cape Town, and eventually to Sierra Leone.\nImported Chinese labourers arrived in 1810, reaching a peak of 618 in 1818, after which numbers were reduced. Only a few older men remained after the British Crown took over the government of the island from the East India Company in 1834. The majority were sent back to China, although records in the Cape suggest that they never got any farther than Cape Town. There were also a few Indian lascars who worked under the harbour master.\nThe citizens of Saint Helena hold British Overseas Territories citizenship. On 21 May 2002, full British citizenship was restored by the British Overseas Territories Act 2002. See also British nationality law.\nDuring periods of unemployment, there has been a long pattern of emigration from the island since the post-Napoleonic period. The majority of \"Saints\" emigrated to the United Kingdom, South Africa and in the early years, Australia. The population had been steadily declining since the late 1980s and dropped from 5,157 at the 1998 census to 4,257 in 2008. However, as of the 2021 census, the population has risen to 4,439 a drop of 95 people from 2016. In the past emigration was characterised by young unaccompanied persons leaving to work on long-term contracts on Ascension and the Falkland Islands, but since \"Saints\" were re-awarded British citizenship in 2002, emigration to Britain by a wider range of wage-earners has accelerated due to the prospect of higher wages and better progression prospects. By 2018 Swindon, Wiltshire, had a concentration of people originating from Saint Helena, and therefore it got the nickname \"Swindolena\".\nReligion.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Pie chart/styles.css\"/&gt;\nMost residents are Anglican and are members of the Diocese of St Helena, which has its own bishop and includes Ascension Island. The 150th anniversary of the diocese was celebrated in June 2009.\nOther Christian denominations on the island include the Roman Catholic (since 1852), the Salvation Army (since 1884), Baptist (since 1845) and, in more recent times, the Seventh-day Adventist (since 1949), the New Apostolic Church, and Jehovah's Witnesses (of which one in 35 residents is a member, the highest ratio of any country).\nThe Roman Catholics are pastorally served by the Mission sui iuris of Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha, whose office of ecclesiastical superior is vested in the Apostolic Prefecture of the Falkland Islands.\nGovernment.\nExecutive authority in Saint Helena is vested in King Charles III and is exercised on his behalf by the Governor of Saint Helena. The Governor is appointed by the King on the advice of the British government. Defence and foreign affairs remain the responsibility of the United Kingdom.\nThe Executive Council is presided over by the Governor and consists of three \"ex officio\" officers and five elected members of the Legislative Council appointed by the Governor. There is no elected Chief Minister, and the Governor acts as the head of government. In January 2013 it was proposed that the Executive Council would be led by a Chief Councillor who would be elected by the members of the Legislative Council and would nominate the other members of the Executive Council. These proposals were put to a referendum on 23 March 2013, when they were defeated by 158 votes to 42 on a 10% turnout. Another referendum in 2021, however, saw the population approve the changes.\nThe legislature of Saint Helena consists of the unicameral Legislative Council of Saint Helena and the King-in-Parliament (represented by the Governor). The Legislative Council consists of 15 members, of whom 12 are directly elected members who each serve a four-year term; a Speaker and Deputy Speaker who are chosen by the elected members; and one \"ex officio\" member, the Attorney General. Members of the Council use the post-nominal letters \"MLC\" (Member of the Legislative Council)\nThe island is policed by the Royal Saint Helena Police Service (RSHPS). The RSHPS is also the primary law enforcement agency for Ascension Island and the archipelago of Tristan da Cunha. Like many other Commonwealth nations, the warranted personnel of the RSHPS are known as 'constables', and the service also uses special constables, in addition to employing non-warranted staff personnel. The RSHPS also uses a variety of ranks similar to other Commonwealth law enforcement agencies. Saint Helena has one police station, \"Coleman House\", named after PC Leonard John Coleman who died in the line of duty on 2 December 1982. The Island's only prison\u2014HMP Jamestown\u2014was built in 1827 and in 2018.\nOne commentator has observed that notwithstanding the high unemployment resulting from the loss of full passports during 1981\u20132002, the Saint Helena population's loyalty to the British monarchy is probably not exceeded in any other part of the world. King George VI is the only reigning monarch to have visited the island. This was in 1947 when he, his wife Queen Elizabeth, and his daughters Princess Elizabeth (later Queen Elizabeth II) and Princess Margaret, were travelling to South Africa. Other royal visits include Prince Philip in 1957, his son Prince Andrew as a member of the armed forces in 1984, his daughter Anne, Princess Royal in 2002, and his son Prince Edward in 2024.\nHuman rights.\nIn 2012, the government of Saint Helena funded the creation of the Saint Helena Human Rights Action Plan 2012\u20132015. Work is being done under this action plan, including publishing awareness-raising articles in local newspapers, providing support for members of the public with human rights queries, and extending several UN Conventions on human rights to St. Helena.\nLegislation to set up an Equality and Human Rights Commission was passed by Legislative Council in July 2015. This commenced operation in October 2015.\nChild safeguarding inquiry 2015.\nIn 2014, there were reports of child abuse in Saint Helena. Britain's Foreign and Commonwealth Office was accused of lying to the United Nations about child abuse in Saint Helena to cover up allegations. Queen's Counsel Sasha Wass and her team spent two weeks on Saint Helena in March 2015 to perform an inquiry. A government report in December 2015 found that the accusations were grossly exaggerated, and the lurid headlines in the \"Daily Mail\" had come from information from two social workers, whom the report described as incompetent.\nSame-sex marriage.\nIn 2017, a male St Helenian made an application to the Registrar to marry his male fianc\u00e9 on St Helena. The laws at the time had referred to marriages between men and women and it was not clear whether same-sex marriages were lawful. After consultation events, endorsement by the Social and Community Development Committee and Executive Council, the Marriage Ordinance was updated and agreed by Legislative Council in December 2017. Registrar Karen Yon oversaw the first same-sex wedding between the original 2017 applicants, Saint Helenian Lemarc Thomas and Swedish national Michael Wernstedt, in a ceremony at Plantation House on 31 December 2018.\nReburial of excavated human remains.\nIn 2021, a wreath was placed by the Saint Helena's Equality &amp; Human Rights Commission (EHRC) on the door of the Pipe Store in Jamestown. The Pipe Store is a building where the remains of some 325 people, men, women, and children disinterred during airport construction were being stored pending reburial since 2008. The remains belonged to liberated Africans who had been rescued by the Royal Navy's West Africa Squadron during the suppression of the Atlantic slave trade and brought to Saint Helena.\nBiodiversity.\nSaint Helena has long been known for its high proportion of endemic birds and vascular plants. The highland areas contain most of the 400 endemic species recognised to date. Much of the island has been identified by BirdLife International as being important for bird conservation, especially the endemic Saint Helena plover, or wirebird, and for seabirds breeding on the offshore islets and stacks, in the north-east and the south-west Important Bird Areas. \nOn the basis of these endemics and an exceptional range of habitats, Saint Helena is on the United Kingdom's tentative list for future UNESCO World Heritage Sites. Artist Rolf Weijburg produced original etchings of Saint Helena, picturing various species of these endemic birds.\nSaint Helena's biodiversity, however, also includes marine vertebrates, invertebrates (freshwater, terrestrial and marine), fungi (including lichen-forming species), non-vascular plants, seaweeds and other biological groups. To date, very little is known about these, although more than 200 lichen-forming fungi have been recorded, including nine endemics, suggesting that many significant discoveries remain to be made.\nVarious flora and fauna on the island have become extinct. Due to deforestation, the last wild endemic St Helena olive tree, \"Nesiota elliptica\", died in 1994, and by December 2003, the last cultivated olive tree died. The native St. Helena earwig was last seen in the wild in 1967.\nA large reforestation project has been under way since 2000 in the north-eastern corner of the island, known as the Millennium Forest, to recreate the Great Wood that existed before colonisation.\nThe island's shoreline is deep and is known to have abundant red crab. In 1991, a crab-fishing vessel, \"Oman Sea One\", which was engaged in potting of crabs, capsized and later sank off the coast of Saint Helena on its way from Ascension Island, losing four crew members. One crew member was rescued by .\nSince 2022, advances in the understanding of Saint Helena's spiders have been gained. Some studies published in 2023 and 2024 described new genera and species. Perhaps most notable was the mole spider (\"Molearachne\" \"sanctaehelenae\" Sherwood, Henrard, Logunov &amp; Fowler, 2024), the first known wolf spider from outside of a cave environment known to have reduced anterior median eyes, and which builds unique 'mole hills' unlike any other spider. Other species described include the Mount Vesey wolf spider (\"Hogna veseyensis\"), which has a range currently restricted to a single waterfall, and three which were named after local Saint Helenian scientists: the Liza pirate spider (\"Ero lizae\"), the Natasha pirate spider (\"Ero natashae\") and the Daryl wolf spider (\"Dolocosa joshuai\").\n\"Note: Some of the data in this section have been sourced from the \"Government of St\u00a0Helena Sustainable Development Plan\nEconomy.\nThe island had a monocrop economy until 1966, based on the cultivation and processing of New Zealand flax for rope and string.\nA 2019 report states that \"by the 1970s, a majority of Saints were working abroad and sending money home\".\nSaint Helena's economy is now developing, but is almost entirely sustained by aid from the British government. The public sector dominates the economy, accounting for about 50% of gross domestic product. However, the start of regular air services has led to a rise in tourism, and the Government is encouraging investment on the island, as shown by their Investment Policy and Strategy and the investment prospectus for potential investors. In 2019, Saint Helena achieved its first-ever \"Investment Grade\" credit rating, a credit rating of BBB\u2212 (stable), from global credit rating agency Standard &amp; Poors (S&amp;P).\nIn 2019, the estimated average annual salary was only about 8,000 Saint Helena pounds (about US$10,000).\nSaint Helena's Sustainable Economic Development Plan, 2018\u201328, was developed using more than six months of local and international consultation in 2017\u20132018. The document represented a 10-year plan to kick-start the economy after Saint Helena established air access and fibre connectivity and moved away from relying purely on tourism for growth, announcing a desire to \"increase exports, and decrease imports\". The SEDP stated that the island's comparative advantages are its natural resources and geography, its status as a British Overseas Territory, its currency, relatively inexpensive labour and property costs, and low crime. Targeted export growth sectors include tourism, fisheries, coffee, satellite ground stations, remote workers and digital nomads, academia, research and conferences, liquor, wines and beers, ship registry and sailing qualifications, traditional products, honey and honey bees, and its use as a film location. Growth sectors for import substitution include agriculture, timber, bricks, blocks, minerals and rocks, and bottled water.\nSaint Helena cultivates a variety of coffee which it exports as one of the most expensive in the world. It also produces and exports Tungi Spirit, made from the fruit of the prickly pear, or cactus pear, \"Opuntia ficus-indica\" (\"Tungi\" is the local Saint Helenian name for the plant), and coffee liqueur, gin, and rum in its local distillery. Due to the absence of parasites and disease in bees, beekeepers collect some of the purest honey in the world.\nSaint Helena has a small fishing industry, landing mostly tuna. The fishery is committed to one-by-one fishing, as explained by its motto \"one pole, one line, one fish at a time\". Some of Saint Helena's exported tuna has been served in restaurants in Cape Town.\nLike Ascension Island and Tristan da Cunha, Saint Helena is permitted to issue its own postage stamps, an enterprise that provides an income. Saint Helena also issues domain names under the top-level domain .sh.\nEconomic statistics.\nBetween 2009 and 2017, Saint Helena's HDI increased from 0.714 to 0.756; this placed Saint Helena in the 'high' category of human development, according to the classification used by the United Nations. Compared to other countries around the globe, Saint Helena's HDI ranking rose from 93rd (out of 190 countries ranked) to 83rd in the world.\nThe average (median) annual wage on Saint Helena in 2018\u201319 was an estimated \u00a38,410. The median male wage was higher than the median female wage. The gap between the two grew in 2013\u201314, but narrowed in 2017\u201318, as male wages fell on average, and the median female wage level grew. This is probably due to the completion of the construction of the airport, since workers employed on the project were predominantly male, and many of them either left Saint Helena or found alternative employment between 2016 and 2018. Nonetheless, both female and male median wage levels fell sharply in 2018\u201319.\nThe overall retail price index is measured quarterly on Saint Helena by the SHG Statistics Office. The RPI was measured at 105.9 in the first quarter of 2020. This was unchanged from the index for the fourth quarter of 2019, and an increase from 104.1 in the first quarter of 2019. This means that retail prices rose, on average, by 1.7% over the year between the first quarter of 2019 and the first quarter of 2020. As most of the goods available in retail outlets on Saint Helena are imported from either South Africa or the United Kingdom, Saint Helena's prices are heavily influenced by price inflation in those two countries, the value of the Saint Helena pound compared to the South African rand, the cost of freight, and import taxes. In the UK, the annual price inflation rate (using the consumer price index) was 1.7% for February 2020, down from 1.8% in January 2020. In South Africa, the consumer price index was 4.6% for February, up from 4.5% in January 2020. In addition, since early 2019 the value of the South African Rand has steadily weakened, from around 17 Rand per pound to around 20 at the end of March 2020; this has a counter-effect to the South African inflation, and in some cases may even have made South African goods cheaper to buy. This will mitigate against some pressures which might cause prices to rise, such as increasing freight prices on the MV Helena.\nBetween January 2010 and March 2016, just before the first 40 people arrived by air in April 2016, the average number of arrivals per month by sea (excluding day visitors arriving on cruise ships) was 307, with an average of 245 arriving on the Royal Mail Ship (RMS) Saint Helena. Between October 2017 (when the first scheduled air service began) and September 2019, an average of 432 passengers arrived per month, with 314 of those passengers arriving by air. Since October 2017, a total of 3,337 people have arrived by air in the first 12-month period, and 4,188 in the second. The increase in the second year followed the introduction of a mid-week flight during the peak period of December 2018 to April 2019. Arrivals by air were higher in the second year, in every month apart from May and June.\nBanking and currency.\nIn 1821, Saul Solomon (the uncle of Saul Solomon) issued 70,560 copper tokens worth a halfpenny each \"Payable at St\u00a0Helena by Solomon, Dickson and Taylor\"\u2014presumably London partners\u2014that circulated alongside the East India Company's local coinage until the Crown took over the island in 1836. The coin remains readily available to collectors.\nSaint Helena has had its own currency since 1976, the Saint Helena pound, which is at parity with the pound sterling and is also the currency of Ascension Island. The government of Saint Helena produces its own coinage, banknotes since 1976 and circulating coins since 1984. Whereas circulating coins are struck with \"Saint Helena \u2022 Ascension\", the banknotes only say \"Government of St. Helena\". There are also commemorative coins struck for Saint Helena only.\nThe Bank of Saint Helena was established on Saint Helena and Ascension Island in 2004. It has branches in Jamestown on Saint Helena, and Georgetown, Ascension Island. The bank took over the business of the Saint Helena government savings bank and Ascension Island Savings Bank.\nFor more information on currency in the wider region, see British currency in the South Atlantic and the Antarctic.\nTourism.\nThe tourist industry is heavily based on the promotion of Napoleon's imprisonment as well as nature activities such as scuba diving, swimming with whale sharks, whale watching, bird watching, marine tours, and hiking. There is also a golf course, and sportfishing is possible. Several hotels, B&amp;Bs, and self-catering apartments operate on the island. \nBefore the airport opened, the primary tourist groups were dedicated hikers and retirees, as the required voyage on the RMS \"St Helena\" took five days each way. That was unattractive to most tourists with regular jobs. The hikers seemed willing to use the extra days of leave to get to and from Saint Helena, and retirees would not be concerned with voyage times.\nThe decision to build the airport, in order to significantly boost tourism, was taken in 2011 by the governments of Saint Helena and the UK. Construction was completed by 2016. One reason for the delay was that the British decided to fill in a valley \"with some 800 million pounds of dirt and rock\" to create flat land for the runway. \nThe first flight did not arrive until October 2017, because of \"dangerous wind conditions\" that made landing large aircraft unsafe. The solution was to use smaller aircraft for the five- or six-hour flight from South Africa. The wind still causes problems: \"only a special, stripped-down Embraer 190 jet with the best pilots in the world can stick the landing\". The government's long-term goal is to get 30,000 visitors per year. Because of the few flights and limited capacity of the aircraft, only 894 visitors arrived in the year the airport finally opened.\nPassenger service on the Royal Mail ship was then discontinued. The Airlink flights, operating twice a week, increased the island's potential to attract a broader range of tourists.\nSt Helena Tourism updated its tourism marketing strategy in 2018. This outlined the targeted markets and Saint Helena's strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. It also outlined the unique selling points of the island, including nature (whale sharks and wirebirds), Saint culture (safer environment), walking and hiking, diving, arts and crafts, twin destination with South Africa, photography, running, history and heritage (Napoleon), stargazing, and food and drink.\nThe island's first luxury hotel,\u00a0the Mantis in Jamestown, opened in 2017 in the converted \"former officers barracks built in 1774\" according to \"Cond\u00e9 Nast Traveler\". Most other types of accommodations were also available on the island.\nA 2019 report by \"The Guardian\" recommended that tourists visit \"Longwood House, where Napoleon was exiled after Waterloo ... Plantation House, the residence of the governor\" and to try one of the whale shark snorkelling expeditions. The report spoke highly of Jamestown, with its \"pastel-toned houses, sweltering palm trees and colonial relics\u2014stark reminders of imperialist ideals\". Another 2019 report indicated that smartphones had become common, \"with the 'Saint Memes' Facebook page and other social media exporting their sharp sense of humour\". But, as the report concludes, the island \"remains a place with an anchor in the past, where ... there are single-digit car licence plates and motorists on the hairpin roads unfailingly wave at each other\".\nBefore the lockdowns and restriction necessitated by the COVID-19 global pandemic, Saint Helena was on track to meet its tourism targets of 12% growth a year, in order to achieve over 29,000 leisure visitors by the 25th anniversary of the air service.\nAs of April 2020, research indicated that arrivals in Saint Helena were primarily non-Saint tourists (without a connection to the island), followed by returning Saints (who were visiting friends and relatives), followed by returning residents and then business arrivals. Non-Saint tourists tend to stay for a week, whilst Saints visiting friends and relatives tend to stay for about a month. Around 37% of tourists are British, 21% South African, 13% European other than British, German or French and 9% American or from the Caribbean. Most non-Saint tourists are over 40 years of age, with around 40% being 40 to 59 and around 40% being 60-plus. In 2018 tourism contributed approximately \u00a34\u20135 million to the economy, and in 2019 this increased to around \u00a35\u20136 million.\nEffects of the pandemic.\nOne news report in August 2020 stated that the costs imposed by the pandemic led to the \"collapse of the island's tourism sector, which was meant to drive its economic development\".\nIn 2021, the bicentennial anniversary of Napoleon's death was expected to boost tourism if the pandemic did not prevent visits for many months. As of September 2020, the government was preparing a \"tourism recovery strategy\", to include an international publicity campaign and the development of further tourism infrastructure for the island\".\nAs of 30 October 2020, the Government website stated that \"due to the COVID-19 pandemic, travel to Saint Helena will only be permitted for limited purposes at this time\". An item posted on 4 March 2021 on the UK Government website stated that \"all arrivals to St Helena are required to have had a negative COVID-19 test within 72 hours before travelling\" and with a few exceptions, non-Saints were not allowed to visit. In addition, all arrivals were required to self-quarantine for 14 days after landing in Saint Helena.\nAs of 8 August 2022, the Government website stated that \"St Helena lifted its COVID-19 entry regulations. This means no quarantine, no testing and no mask-wearing requirements\".\nEnergy.\nConnect Saint Helena Ltd. operates electricity generation and distribution. As of 2023, 80% of electricity generated in St Helena comes from 6 diesel generators. 12 wind turbines are installed on the Deadwood Plain in Longwood and were originally installed in the 1990s, expanded in 2009 and 2014. A 500kW solar farm is in operation as well as photovoltaic arrays on 4 public buildings. As a result of the fact that almost all energy must be imported (diesel/oil), electricity is expensive in St Helena, at \u00a30.53/kWh as of 2024.\nA plan to expand the use of renewable solar and wind power was announced in 2016, but never came to fruition. Electricity production from wind has declined steadily from 2014\u20132024, due to unreliable equipment and grid balancing challenges. In 2024, a new target of 80% renewable electricity production by 2027 was announced, by renewing and expanding wind and solar facilities as well as considering the potential of battery storage.\nTransport.\nSaint Helena is one of the most remote islands in the world. It has one commercial airport, Saint Helena Airport; access to the island has improved greatly since its opening in 2017. Sea freight is serviced through Saint Helena's single wharf in Ruperts. The island has a mostly paved road network extending to all inhabited areas of the island, although it is mostly single lane.\nSea.\nThe Saint Helena Government contracts international shipping companies to provide maritime freight services to the island. As of March 2024, MACS Maritime Carrier Shipping GmbH &amp; Co provides regular freight services to the island, usually on a monthly basis. It sails from Cape Town to Saint Helena and Ascension Island.\nCommercial shipping to Saint Helena is handled at the island's sole wharf at Ruperts Bay, originally built to assist the airport construction.\nUntil 2017, the Royal Mail Ship ran between Saint Helena and Cape Town on a five-day voyage, then the only scheduled connection to the island. She berthed offshore in James Bay, Saint Helena about 30 times per year, and passengers and freight were transferred ashore by small boats.\nSaint Helena receives around 600 yachting visitors a year.\nAir.\nSaint Helena Airport (IATA: HLE) is the island's first and only airport. The South African airline Airlink operates weekly flights to Johannesburg, as well as charter flights to Ascension Island and seasonal flights to Cape Town. The airport also operates medivac flights and accommodates general aviation. Scheduled flights to and from Johannesburg operated by an Embraer E190 usually include a fuel stop (on the Saint Helena-bound leg only) at Walvis Bay, with a flight time of around 4.5 to 6 hours. Air freight (including mail) is carried by scheduled air services. \nThe prospect of an airport on St Helena was debated for a long time. The site was not considered ideal for an airport and the airport construction was delayed and required many improvements by the UK Government on the island. The airport was opened for commercial traffic on 14 October 2017. \nRoad.\nTraffic in Saint Helena drives on the left and road signs are based on British standards. There is an island-wide speed limit of 30 mph (48\u00a0km/h); lower in some areas. There are many private vehicles on the island despite the steep and narrow roads, hairpin bends and limited parking in Jamestown. Roads into Jamestown include Side Path and Field Road, which have been upgraded and improved in the 2020s. There are three roundabouts on the island. The road constructed for conveying materials from Ruperts Bay to the airport during construction was paved and opened for public traffic in 2019, a major addition to the island's road network.\nA minibus offers a basic bus service to carry people around Saint Helena, with most services designed to take people into Jamestown. Taxis, as well as car hire services, are available.\nMedia and communications.\nTelecommunications services in St Helena are provided by Sure South Atlantic, providing landline, mobile (2G/4G), internet and television services. International connectivity is provided by the Google Equiano submarine cable. There are three FM radio stations broadcasting in St Helena as of 2023 and two weekly newspapers are published. \nTelecom services in St Helena are comparatively expensive, for example, all TV channels are encrypted and a subscription costs amount to more than one tenth of an average worker's salary.\nSure South Atlantic holds a licensed monopoly on telecommunications on the island until 31 December 2025. As of 2023, new telecoms regulations were being drafted; there was a \"possibility of issuing a license to a different provider after Sure's term expires\".\nTelecommunications.\nSaint Helena has the international calling code +290, which Tristan da Cunha has shared since 2006. Landline telephones are available to all households on the island. Until 2023, a satellite ground station with a 7.6-metre (25 foot) satellite dish installed in 1989 was the only international connectivity to the island. Bandwidth was extremely limited and data caps were low. \nThe Equiano submarine cable was activated in 2023, substantially improving communications on the island, offering hugely increased bandwidth and unlimited data plans for the first time.\nMobile phone service (2G/4G) commenced in September 2015.\"\" As of 2024, ADSL2 service is available to most households, with speeds ranging from 2 to 20\u00a0Mbit/s. It is envisioned that a fibre optic network will be installed to homes and businesses but plans have stalled as of 2024.\nTelevision and Radio.\nTelevision services first arrived in 1995. The current digital broadcasting network uses DVB-T2 standards and retransmits international content from satellites. A local television channel was in operation from 2015 to 2017 by SAMS (South Atlantic Media Services, Ltd.), consisting of a weekly news bulletin. \nRadio broadcasting began in 1967 with Radio Saint Helena (now defunct). Today, South Atlantic Media Services (SAMS), supported by the St Helena Government, broadcasts two FM stations: SAMS Radio 1, providing locally produced news, talk and music programming; SAMS also rebroadcasts the BBC World Service. Saint FM Community Radio is the island's only independent broadcaster.\nOccasional amateur radio operations also occur on the island. The ITU prefix used is ZD7.\nLocal newspapers.\nThe island has two local newspapers, both of which are available online. The \"St\u00a0Helena Independent\" has been published since November 2005. \"The Sentinel\" newspaper was introduced in 2012. \"Saint Helena Island Info\" is an online resource featuring the history of St. Helena from its discovery to the present day, plus photographs and information about life on St. Helena today.\nSatellite ground stations.\nIn February 2018, the government of St Helena launched a project to attract low earth orbit satellite operators to install ground stations on the island. Leasing backhaul capacity could contribute to operational costs on the submarine cable. OneWeb constructed an uplink satellite ground station on St. Helena in 2023, connected to the submarine cable.\nCulture and society.\nEducation.\nThe Education and Employment Directorate, formerly the Saint Helena Education Department, in 2000 had its head office in The Canister in Jamestown. Education is free and compulsory between the ages of five and 16. At the beginning of the academic year 2009\u201310, 230 students were enrolled in primary school and 286 in secondary school. The island has three primary schools for students of age four to 11: Harford, Pilling, and St Paul's.\nSt Helena Secondary School (formerly Prince Andrew School) provides secondary education for students aged 11 to 18.\nIt formerly had separate first schools catering to younger students (ages 3 to 7 as of 2002):\nThe Education and Employment Directorate also offers programmes for students with special needs, vocational training, adult education, evening classes, and distance learning. The island has a public library (the oldest in the Southern Hemisphere, open since 1813) and a mobile library service which operates weekly in rural areas.\nThe English national curriculum is adapted for local use. A range of qualifications are offered\u2014from GCSE, A/S and A2, to Level 3 Diplomas and Vocationally Recognised Qualifications (VRQs):\nGCSEs\n* Design and Technology\n* ICT\n* Business Studies\nA/S &amp; A2 and Level 3 Diploma\n* Business Studies\n* English\n* English Literature\n* Geography\n* ICT\n* Psychology\n* Maths\n* Accountancy\nVRQ\n* Building and Construction\n* Automotive Studies\nSaint Helena has no tertiary education. Scholarships are offered for students to study abroad. St Helena Community College (SHCC) has some vocational and professional education programmes available.\nSport.\nHistorically, the St Helena Turf Club organised the island's first recorded sports events in 1818 with a series of horse races at Deadwood. Saint Helena has sent teams to a number of Commonwealth Games. Saint Helena is a member of the International Island Games Association. The Saint Helena cricket team made its debut in international cricket in Division Three of the African region of the World Cricket League in 2012. The Saint Helena football team first tournament was the 2019 Inter Games Football Tournament after which it was ranked tenth out of ten.\nThe Governor's Cup is a yacht race between Cape Town and Saint Helena island, held every two years in December and January.\nIn Jamestown a timed run takes place up Jacob's Ladder every year, with people coming from all over the world to take part.\nScouting and Girl Guiding.\nThere are Scouting and Guiding Groups on Saint Helena and Ascension Island. Scouting was established on Saint Helena island in 1912. Lord and Lady Baden-Powell visited the Scouts on Saint Helena on the return from their 1937 tour of Africa. The visit is described in Lord Baden-Powell's book, titled \"African Adventures\".\nCuisine.\nIn 2017, Julia Buckley of \"The Independent\" wrote that, due to the lack of nouvelle cuisine, the food is \"[p]retty retro, at least by London standards.\" Fish cakes in a St Helena style, with egg binding and chili, and a risotto-with-curry dish called \"pilau\" (or \"plo\", similar to the Indian rice dish \"pulao\") are what Buckley describes as \"staple[s]\". Indeed, most of the local recipes are variations of world dishes brought to the island by travellers.\nLanguage.\nEnglish is the official language. The local basilect is called Saint-speak, Saint, or Saint English, which is a form of South Atlantic English.\nNamesake.\nSt Helena, a suburb of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, was named after the island.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The fiber intended is drawn out, twisted, and wound onto a bobbin. A few popular fibers that are spun into yarn other than cotton, which is the most popular, are viscose (the most common form of rayon), animal fibers such as wool, and synthetic polyester. Originally done by hand using a spindle whorl, starting in the 500s AD the spinning wheel became the predominant spinning tool across Asia and Europe. The spinning jenny and spinning mule, invented in the late 1700s, made mechanical spinning far more efficient than spinning by hand, and especially made cotton manufacturing one of the most important industries of the Industrial Revolution.\nProcess.\nThe yarn issuing from the drafting rollers passes through a thread-guide, round a traveller that is free to rotate around a ring, and then onto a tube or bobbin, which is carried on to a spindle, the axis of which passes through a center of the ring.\nThe spindle is driven (usually at an angular velocity that is either constant or changes only slowly), and the traveller is dragged around a ring by the loop of yarn passing round it.\nIf the drafting rollers were stationary, the angular velocity of the traveller would be the same as that of the spindle, and each revolution of the spindle would cause one turn of a twist to be inserted in the loop of yarn between the roller nip and the traveller. \nIn spinning, however, the yarn is continually issuing from the rollers of the drafting system and, under these circumstances, the angular velocity of the traveller is less than that of the spindle by an amount that is just sufficient to allow the yarn to be wound onto the bobbin at the same rate as that at which it issues from the drafting rollers.\nEach revolution of the traveller now inserts one turn of twist into the loop of yarn between the roller nip and the traveller but, in equilibrium, the number of turns of twist in the loop of yarn remains constant as the twisted yarn is passing through the traveller at a corresponding rate.\nTypes of fibre.\nArtificial fibres are made by extruding a polymer through a spinneret into a medium where it hardens. Wet spinning (rayon) uses a coagulating medium. In dry spinning (acetate and triacetate), the polymer is contained in a solvent that evaporates in the heated exit chamber. In melt spinning (nylons and polyesters) the extruded polymer is cooled in gas or air and sets. All these fibres will be of great length, often kilometers long.\nNatural fibres can be divided into three categories: animals (sheep, goat, rabbit, silkworm), minerals (asbestos, gold, silver), or plants (cotton, flax, sisal). These vegetable fibres can come from the seed (cotton), the stem (known as bast fibres: they include flax, hemp, and jute) or the leaf (sisal). Many processes are needed before a clean even staple is obtained. With the exception of silk, each of these fibres is short, only centimetres in length, and each has a rough surface that enables it to bond with similar staples.\nArtificial fibres can be processed as long fibres or batched and cut so they can be processed like a natural fibre.\nMethods.\nRing spinning is one of the most common spinning methods in the world. Other systems include air-jet and open-end spinning, a technique where the staple fiber is blown by air into a rotor and attaches to the tail of formed yarn that is continually being drawn out of the chamber. Other methods of break spinning use needles and electrostatic forces.\nThe processes to make short-staple yarn (typically spun from fibers from ) are blending, opening, carding, pin-drafting, roving, spinning, and\u2014if desired\u2014plying and dyeing. In long staple spinning, the process may start with stretch-break of tow, a continuous \"rope\" of synthetic fiber. In open-end and air-jet spinning, the roving operation is eliminated. The spinning frame winds yarn around a bobbin. Generally, after this step the yarn is wound to a cone for knitting or weaving.\nIn a spinning mule, the roving is pulled off bobbins and sequentially fed through rollers operating at several different speeds, thinning the roving at a consistent rate. The yarn is twisted through the spinning of the bobbin as the carriage moves out, and is rolled onto a cop as the carriage returns. Mule spinning produces a finer thread than ring spinning. Spinning by the mule machine is an intermittent process as the frame advances and returns. It is the descendant of a device invented in 1779 by Samuel Crompton, and produces a softer, less twisted thread that is favored for fines and for weft.\nThe ring was a descendant of the Arkwright water frame of 1769 and creates yarn in a continuous process. The yarn is coarser, has a greater twist, and is stronger, making it more suitable for warp. Ring spinning is slow due to the distance the thread must pass around the ring. Similar methods have improved on this including flyer and bobbin and cap spinning.\nThe pre-industrial techniques of hand spinning with a spindle or spinning wheel continue to be practiced as handicraft or hobby and enable wool or unusual vegetable and animal staples to be used.\nHistory and economics.\nThe origins of hand spinning fibers is unknown, but is believed to have originated separately in several cultures around the world long before the common era. The oldest known twisted fiber was found in southern France, and archaeologists believe it was created around 50,000-40,000 BCE. People are thought to have originally twisted fibers together by rolling them up the thigh or between the fingers, although soon a stick was used to maintain tension and hold the twist in the fibers.\nPeople eventually discovered that adding a weight to the stick, often made of stone, wood, or clay and known as a whorl, helped to maintain momentum and left the hands free to draft the fiber. Whorl spindles are still the predominant method of spinning fiber in some parts of the world.\nThe cultivation of cotton as well as the knowledge of its spinning and weaving in Mero\u00eb reached a high level around the 4th century BC. The export of textiles was one of the sources of wealth for Mero\u00eb.\nHand spinning was an important cottage industry in medieval Europe, where the wool spinners (most often women and children) would provide enough yarn to service the needs of the men who operated the looms or to sell on in the putting-out system.\nSpinning Jenny.\nAfter the invention of the spinning jenny water frame the demand was greatly reduced by mechanization. Its technology was specialized and costly and employed water as motive power. Spinning and weaving as cottage industries were displaced by dedicated manufactories, developed by industrialists and their investors; the spinning and weaving industries, once widespread, were concentrated where the sources of water, raw materials, and manpower were most readily available, particularly West Yorkshire. The British government was very protective of the technology and restricted its export. After World War I the colonies where the cotton was grown started to purchase and manufacture significant quantities of cotton spinning machinery. The next breakthrough was with the move over to break or open-end spinning, and then the adoption of artificial fibres. By then most production had moved to Asia.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

As a result of its status as a sovereign state, the Union Republic de jure had the right to enter into relations with foreign states, conclude treaties with them and exchange diplomatic and consular representatives and participate in the activities of international organizations (including membership in international organizations). The Union Republics were perceived as national-based administrative units of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR).\nThe Soviet Union was formed in 1922 by a treaty between the Soviet republics of Byelorussia, Russian SFSR (RSFSR), Transcaucasian Federation, and Ukraine, by which they became its constituent republics of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (Soviet Union). For most of its history, the USSR was a one-party state led by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Key functions of the USSR were highly centralized in Moscow until its final years, despite its nominal structure as a federation of republics; the light decentralization reforms during the era of \"perestroika\" (reconstruction) and \"glasnost\" (voice-ness, as in freedom of speech) conducted by Mikhail Gorbachev as part of the Helsinki Accords are cited as one of the factors which led to the dissolution of the USSR in 1991 as a result of the Cold War and the creation of the Commonwealth of Independent States.\nThe Karelo-Finnish Soviet Socialist Republic, a relic of the Soviet-Finnish War (the Winter War), became the only union republic to be deprived of its status in 1956. The decision to downgrade Karelia to an autonomous republic within the Russian SFSR was made unilaterally by the central government without consulting its population. The official basis for downgrading the status of the republic was the changes that had occurred in the national composition of its population (about 80% of the inhabitants were Russians, Belarusians and Ukrainians), as well as the need to reduce the state apparatus, the cost of maintaining which in 1955 amounted to 19.6 million rubles.\nOverview.\nChapter 8 of the 1977 Soviet Constitution is titled as the \"Soviet Union is a union state\". Article 70 stated that the union was founded on the principles of \"socialist federalism\" as a result of the free self-determination of nations and the voluntary association of equal Soviet Socialist Republics. Article 71 listed all fifteen union republics that united into the Soviet Union.\nAccording to Article\u00a076 of the 1977 Soviet Constitution, a union republic was defined as a sovereign Soviet socialist state that had united with other Soviet Republics into the USSR. Article\u00a078 of the Constitution stated that the territory of a union republic may not be altered without its consent. The boundaries between republics may be altered by mutual agreement of the republics concerned, if the rest of the union agreed. Article\u00a081 of the Constitution stated that \"the sovereign rights of Union Republics shall be safeguarded by the USSR\".\nIn the final decades of its existence, the Soviet Union officially consisted of fifteen Soviet Socialist Republics (SSRs). All of them, with the exception of the Russian SFSR (until 1990), had their own local party chapters of the All-Union Communist Party.\nIn 1944, amendments to the All-Union Constitution allowed for separate branches of the Red Army for each Soviet Republic. They also allowed for Republic-level commissariats for foreign affairs and defense, allowing them to be recognized as \"de jure\" independent states in international law. This allowed for two Soviet Republics, Ukraine and Byelorussia, (as well as the USSR as a whole) to join the United Nations General Assembly as founding members in 1945.\nThe Soviet currency Soviet ruble banknotes all included writings in national languages of all the 15 union republics.\nAll of the former Republics of the Union are now independent countries, with ten of them (all except the Baltic states, Georgia and Ukraine) being very loosely organized under the heading of the Commonwealth of Independent States. Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia assert that their 1940 invasion by, and incorporation into, the Soviet Union (as a result of the 23 August 1939 Nazi\u2013Soviet Pact) was illegal in terms of international law, and that they therefore remained independent countries under Soviet occupation. Their position is supported by the European Union, the European Court of Human Rights, the United Nations Human Rights Council and the United States. In contrast, the Russian government and state officials maintain that the Soviet annexation of the Baltic states was legitimate.\nConstitutionally, the Soviet Union was a federation. In accordance with provisions present in its Constitution (versions adopted in 1924, 1936 and 1977), each republic retained the right to secede from the USSR. Throughout the Cold War, this right was widely considered to be meaningless; however, the corresponding Article\u00a072 of the 1977 Constitution was used in December 1991 to effectively dissolve the Soviet Union, when Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus seceded from the Union. Although the Union was created under an initial ideological appearance of forming a supranational union, it never de facto functioned as one; an example of the ambiguity is that the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic in the 1930s officially had its own foreign minister, but that office did not exercise any true sovereignty apart from that of the union. The Constitution of the Soviet Union in its various iterations defined the union as a federation with the right of the republics to secede. This constitutional status led to the possibility of the parade of sovereignties once the republic with de facto (albeit not de jure) dominance over the other republics, the Russian one, developed a prevailing political notion asserting that it would be better off if it seceded. The de facto dominance of the Russian republic is the reason that various historians (for example, Dmitri Volkogonov and others) have asserted that the union was a unitary state in fact albeit not in law.\nIn practice, the USSR was a highly centralised entity from its creation in 1922 until the mid-1980s when political forces unleashed by reforms undertaken by Mikhail Gorbachev resulted in the loosening of central control and its ultimate dissolution. Under the constitution adopted in 1936 and modified along the way until October 1977, the political foundation of the Soviet Union was formed by the Soviets (Councils) of People's Deputies. These existed at all levels of the administrative hierarchy with the Soviet Union as a whole under the nominal control of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, located in Moscow within the Russian SFSR.\nAlong with the state administrative hierarchy, there existed a parallel structure of party organizations, which allowed the Politburo to exercise large amounts of control over the republics. State administrative organs took direction from the parallel party organs, and appointments of all party and state officials required approval of the central organs of the party.\nEach republic had its own unique set of state symbols: a flag, a coat of arms, and, with the exception of Russia until 1990, an anthem. Every republic of the Soviet Union also was awarded with the Order of Lenin.\nUnion Republics of the Soviet Union.\nThe number of the union republics of the USSR varied from 4 to 16. From 1956 until its dissolution in 1991, the Soviet Union consisted of 15 Soviet Socialist Republics: in 1956, the Karelo-Finnish Soviet Socialist Republic, created in 1940, was absorbed into the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic. Rather than listing the republics in alphabetical order, the republics were listed in constitutional order (which roughly corresponded to their population and economic power when the republics were formed). However, particularly by the last decades of the Soviet Union, the constitutional order did not correspond to order either by population or economic power.\nNon-union Soviet republics.\nThe Turkestan Soviet Federative Republic was proclaimed in 1918 but did not survive to the founding of the USSR, becoming the short-lived Turkestan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic of the RSFSR. The Crimean Soviet Socialist Republic (Soviet Socialist Republic of Taurida) was also proclaimed in 1918, but did not become a union republic and was made into an autonomous republic of the RSFSR, although the Crimean Tatars had a relative majority until the 1930s or 1940s according to censuses. When the Tuvan People's Republic joined the Soviet Union in 1944, it did not become a union republic, and was instead established as an autonomous republic of the RSFSR.\nThe leader of the People's Republic of Bulgaria, Todor Zhivkov, suggested in the early 1960s that the country should become a union republic, but the offer was rejected. During the Soviet\u2013Afghan War, the Soviet Union proposed to annex Northern Afghanistan as its 16th union republic in what was to become the Afghan Soviet Socialist Republic.\nAutonomous Republics of the Soviet Union.\nSeveral of the Union Republics themselves, most notably Russia, were further subdivided into Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republics (ASSRs). Though administratively part of their respective Union Republics, ASSRs were also established based on ethnic/cultural lines.\nAccording to the constitution of the USSR, in case of a union republic voting on leaving the Soviet Union, autonomous republics, autonomous oblasts and autonomous okrugs had the right, by means of a referendum, to independently resolve whether they will stay in the USSR or leave with the seceding union republic, as well as to raise the issue of their state-legal status.\nDissolution of the Soviet Union.\nStarting in the late 1980s, under the rule of Mikhail Gorbachev, the Soviet government undertook a program of political reforms (\"glasnost\" and \"perestroika\") intended to liberalise and revitalise the Union. These measures, however, had a number of unintended political and social effects. Political liberalisation allowed the governments of the union republics to openly express sentiments related to nationalism. In addition, the loosening of political restrictions led to fractures within the Communist Party which resulted in a reduced ability to govern the Union effectively. The rise of nationalist and right-wing movements, notably led by Boris Yeltsin in Russia, in the previously homogeneous political system undermined the Union's foundations. With the central role of the Communist Party removed from the constitution, the Party lost its control over the State machinery and was banned from operating after an attempted coup d'\u00e9tat.\nThroughout this period of turmoil, the Soviet government attempted to find a new structure that would reflect the increased authority of the republics. Some autonomous republics, like Tatarstan, Checheno-Ingushetia, Abkhazia, South Ossetia, Crimea, Transnistria, Gagauzia sought the union statute in the New Union Treaty. Efforts to found a New Union Treaty, however, proved unsuccessful and the republics began to secede from the Union. By 6 September 1991, the Soviet Union's State Council recognized the independence of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania bringing the number of union republics down to 12. On 8 December 1991, the remaining leaders of the republics signed the Belavezha Accords which agreed that the USSR would be dissolved and replaced with a Commonwealth of Independent States. On 25 December, President Gorbachev announced his resignation and turned all executive powers over to Yeltsin. The next day the Council of Republics voted to dissolve the Union. Since then, the republics have been governed independently with some reconstituting themselves as liberal parliamentary republics and others, particularly in Central Asia, devolving into highly autocratic states under the leadership of the old Party elite.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

There are two major subgroups of systemic sclerosis based on the extent of skin involvement: limited and diffuse. The limited form affects areas below, but not above, the elbows and knees with or without involvement of the face. The diffuse form also affects the skin above the elbows and knees and can also spread to the torso. Visceral organs, including the kidneys, heart, lungs, and gastrointestinal tract can also be affected by the fibrotic process.\nPrognosis is determined by the form of the disease and the extent of visceral involvement. Patients with limited systemic sclerosis have a better prognosis than those with the diffuse form. Death is most often caused by lung, heart, and kidney involvement. The risk of cancer is increased slightly.\nSurvival rates have greatly increased with effective treatment for kidney failure. Therapies include immunosuppressive drugs, and in some cases, glucocorticoids.\nSigns and symptoms.\nCalcinosis, Raynaud's phenomenon, Esophageal dysfunction, Sclerodactyly, and Telangiectasia (CREST syndrome) are associated with limited scleroderma. Other symptoms include:\nSkin symptoms.\nIn the skin, systemic sclerosis causes hardening and scarring. The skin may appear tight, reddish, or scaly. Blood vessels may also be more visible. Where large areas are affected, fat and muscle wastage may weaken limbs and affect appearance. Patients report severe and recurrent itching of large skin areas. The severity of these symptoms varies greatly among patients: Some having scleroderma of only a limited area of the skin (such as the fingers) and little involvement of the underlying tissue, while others have progressive skin involvement. Digital ulcers\u2014open wounds especially on fingertips and less commonly the knuckles\u2014are not uncommon.\nOther organs.\nDiffuse scleroderma can cause musculoskeletal, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, renal, and other complications. Patients with greater cutaneous involvement are more likely to have involvement of the internal tissues and organs. Most patients (over 80%) have vascular symptoms and Raynaud's phenomenon, which leads to attacks of discoloration of the hands and feet in response to cold. Raynaud's normally affects the fingers and toes. Systemic scleroderma and Raynaud's can cause painful ulcers on the fingers or toes, which are known as digital ulcers. Calcinosis (deposition of calcium in lumps under the skin) is also common in systemic scleroderma, and is often seen near the elbows, knees, or other joints.\nThe first joint symptoms that patients with scleroderma have are typically nonspecific joint pains, which can lead to arthritis, or cause discomfort in tendons or muscles. Joint mobility, especially of the small joints of the hand, may be restricted by calcinosis or skin thickening. Patients may develop muscle weakness, or myopathy, either from the disease or its treatments.\nSome impairment in lung function is almost universally seen in patients with diffuse scleroderma on pulmonary function testing, but it does not necessarily cause symptoms, such as shortness of breath. Some patients can develop pulmonary hypertension, or elevation in the pressures of the pulmonary arteries. This can be progressive, and can lead to right-sided heart failure. The earliest manifestation of this may be a decreased diffusion capacity on pulmonary function testing. Other pulmonary complications in more advanced disease include aspiration pneumonia, pulmonary hemorrhage and pneumothorax.\nDiffuse scleroderma can affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract. The most common manifestation in the esophagus is reflux esophagitis, which may be complicated by esophageal strictures or benign narrowing of the esophagus. This is best initially treated with proton pump inhibitors for acid suppression, but may require bougie dilatation in the case of stricture.\nScleroderma can decrease motility anywhere in the gastrointestinal tract. The most common source of decreased motility is the esophagus and the lower esophageal sphincter, leading to dysphagia and chest pain. As scleroderma progresses, esophageal involvement from abnormalities in decreased motility may worsen due to progressive fibrosis (scarring). If this is left untreated, acid from the stomach can back up into the esophagus, causing esophagitis and gastroesophageal reflux disease. Further scarring from acid damage to the lower esophagus many times leads to the development of fibrotic narrowing, also known as strictures, which can be treated by dilatation.\nIn patients with neuromuscular disorders, particularly progressive systemic sclerosis and visceral myopathy, the duodenum is frequently involved. Dilatation may occur, which is often more pronounced in the second, third, and fourth parts. The dilated duodenum may be slow to empty, and the grossly dilated, atonic organ may produce a sump effect.\nThe small intestine can also become involved, leading to bacterial overgrowth and malabsorption of bile salts, fats, carbohydrates, proteins, and vitamins. The colon can be involved, and can cause pseudo-obstruction or ischemic colitis.\nRarer complications include pneumatosis cystoides intestinalis, or gas pockets in the bowel wall, wide-mouthed diverticula in the colon and esophagus, and liver fibrosis. Patients with severe gastrointestinal involvement can become profoundly malnourished.\nScleroderma may also be associated with gastric antral vascular ectasia, also known as \"watermelon stomach\". This is a condition in which atypical blood vessels proliferate, usually in a radially symmetric pattern around the pylorus of the stomach. It can be a cause of upper gastrointestinal bleeding or iron-deficiency anemia in patients with scleroderma.\nKidney involvement, in scleroderma, is considered a poor prognostic factor and frequently a cause of death.\nThe most important clinical complication of scleroderma involving the kidney is scleroderma renal crisis (SRC), the symptoms of which are malignant hypertension (high blood pressure with evidence of acute organ damage), hyperreninemia (high renin levels), azotemia (kidney failure with accumulation of waste products in the blood), and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (destruction of red blood cells). Apart from the high blood pressure, hematuria (blood in the urine) and proteinuria (protein loss in the urine) may be indicative of SRC.\nIn the past, SRC was almost uniformly fatal. While outcomes have improved significantly with the use of ACE inhibitors, the prognosis is often guarded, as a significant number of patients are refractory to treatment and develop kidney failure. About 7\u20139% of all diffuse cutaneous scleroderma patients develop renal crisis at some point in the course of their disease. Patients who have rapid skin involvement have the highest risk of renal complications. It is most common in diffuse cutaneous scleroderma, and is often associated with antibodies against RNA polymerase (in 59% of cases). Many proceed to dialysis, although this can be stopped within three years in about a third of cases. Higher age and (paradoxically) a lower blood pressure at presentation make dialysis more likely to be needed.\nTreatments for SRC include ACE inhibitors. Prophylactic use of ACE inhibitors is currently not recommended, as recent data suggest a poorer prognosis in patient treated with these drugs prior to the development of renal crisis. Transplanted kidneys are known to be affected by scleroderma, and patients with early-onset renal disease (within one year of the scleroderma diagnosis) are thought to have the highest risk for recurrence.\nCauses.\nNo clear cause for scleroderma and systemic sclerosis has been identified. Genetic predisposition appears to be limited, as genetic concordance is small; still, a familial predisposition for autoimmune disease is often seen. Polymorphisms in \"COL1A2\" and \"TGF-\u03b21\" may influence severity and development of the disease. Evidence implicating cytomegalovirus (CMV) as the original epitope of the immune reaction is limited, as is parvovirus B19. Organic solvents and other chemical agents have been linked with scleroderma.\nOne of the suspected mechanisms behind the autoimmune phenomenon is the existence of microchimerism, i.e. fetal cells circulating in maternal blood, triggering an immune reaction to what is perceived as foreign material.\nA distinct form of scleroderma and systemic sclerosis may develop in patients with chronic kidney failure. This form, nephrogenic fibrosing dermopathy or nephrogenic systemic fibrosis, has been linked to exposure to gadolinium-containing radiocontrast.\nBleomycin (a chemotherapeutic agent) and possibly taxane chemotherapy may cause scleroderma, and occupational exposure to solvents has been linked to an increased risk of systemic sclerosis.\nPathophysiology.\nOverproduction of collagen is thought to result from an autoimmune dysfunction, in which the immune system starts to attack the kinetochore of the chromosomes. This would lead to genetic malfunction of nearby genes. T cells accumulate in the skin; these are thought to secrete cytokines and other proteins that stimulate collagen deposition. Stimulation of the fibroblast, in particular, seems to be crucial to the disease process, and studies have converged on the potential factors that produce this effect.\nA significant player in the process is transforming growth factor (TGF\u03b2). This protein appears to be overproduced, and the fibroblast (possibly in response to other stimuli) also overexpresses the receptor for this mediator. An intracellular pathway (consisting of \"SMAD2\"/\"SMAD3\", \"SMAD4\", and the inhibitor \"SMAD7\") is responsible for the secondary messenger system that induces transcription of the proteins and enzymes responsible for collagen deposition. \"Sp1\" is a transcription factor most closely studied in this context. Apart from TGF\u03b2, connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) has a possible role. Indeed, a common \"CTGF\" gene polymorphism is present at an increased level in systemic sclerosis.\nDamage to endothelium is an early abnormality in the development of scleroderma, and this, too, seems to be due to collagen accumulation by fibroblasts, although direct alterations by cytokines, platelet adhesion, and a type II hypersensitivity reaction similarly have been implicated. Increased endothelin and decreased vasodilation have been documented.\nJimenez and Derk describe three theories about the development of scleroderma:\nDiagnosis.\nIn 1980, the American College of Rheumatology agreed on diagnostic criteria for scleroderma.\nDiagnosis is by clinical suspicion, presence of autoantibodies (specifically anticentromere and anti-Scl-70 antibodies), and occasionally by biopsy. Of the antibodies, 90% have a detectable antinuclear antibody. Anticentromere antibody is more common in the limited form (80\u201390%) than in the diffuse form (10%), and anti-Scl-70 is more common in the diffuse form (30\u201340%) and in African-American patients (who are more susceptible to the systemic form).\nOther conditions may mimic systemic sclerosis by causing hardening of the skin. Diagnostic hints that another disorder is responsible include the absence of Raynaud's phenomenon, a lack of abnormalities in the skin on the hands, a lack of internal organ involvement, and a normal antinuclear antibodies test result.\nTreatment.\nNo cure for scleroderma is known, though treatments exist for some of the symptoms, including drugs that soften the skin and reduce inflammation. Some patients may benefit from exposure to heat. Holistic care of patients comprising patient education tailored to patients' education level is useful in view of the complex nature of the disease symptoms and progress.\nTopical/symptomatic.\nTopical treatment for the skin changes of scleroderma do not alter the disease course, but may improve pain and ulceration. A range of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as naproxen, can be used to ease painful symptoms. The benefit from steroids such as prednisone is limited. Episodes of Raynaud's phenomenon sometimes respond to nifedipine or other calcium channel blockers; severe digital ulceration may respond to prostacyclin analogue iloprost, and the dual endothelin-receptor antagonist bosentan may be beneficial for Raynaud's phenomenon. Skin tightness may be treated systemically with methotrexate and ciclosporin. and the skin thickness can be treated with penicillamine.\nKidney disease.\nScleroderma renal crisis (SRC) is a life-threatening complication of systemic sclerosis that may be the initial manifestation of the disease.\u00a0 Renal vascular injury (due in part to collagen deposition) leads to renal ischemia, which results in activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS).\u00a0 This raises blood pressure and further damages the renal vasculature, causing a vicious cycle of worsening hypertension and renal dysfunction (e.g., elevated creatinine, edema).\u00a0 Hypertensive emergency with end-organ dysfunction (e.g., encephalopathy, retinal hemorrhage) is common.\u00a0 Thrombocytopenia and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia can be seen.\u00a0 Urinalysis is usually normal but may show mild proteinuria, as in this patient; casts are unexpected.\nThe mainstay of therapy for SRC includes ACE inhibitors, which reduce RAAS activity and improve renal function and blood pressure.\u00a0 Short-acting ACE inhibitors (typically captopril) are used because they can be rapidly uptitrated.\u00a0 An elevated serum creatinine level is not a contraindication for ACE inhibitors in this population, and slight elevations in creatinine are common during drug initiation.\nScleroderma renal crisis, the occurrence of acute kidney injury, and malignant hypertension (very high blood pressure with evidence of organ damage) in people with scleroderma are effectively treated with drugs from the class of the ACE inhibitors. The benefit of ACE inhibitors extends even to those who have to commence dialysis to treat their kidney disease, and may give sufficient benefit to allow the discontinuation of renal replacement therapy.\nLung disease.\nActive alveolitis is often treated with pulses of cyclophosphamide, often together with a small dose of steroids. The benefit of this intervention is modest.\nPulmonary hypertension may be treated with epoprostenol, treprostinil, bosentan, and possibly aerolized iloprost. Nintedanib was approved for use in the United States Food and Drug Administration on September 6, 2019, to slow the rate of decline in pulmonary function in patients with systemic sclerosis-associated interstitial lung disease (SSc-ILD).\nOther.\nSome evidence indicates that plasmapheresis (therapeutic plasma exchange) can be used to treat the systemic form of scleroderma. In Italy, it is a government-approved treatment option. This is done by replacing blood plasma with a fluid consisting of albumin, and is thought to keep the disease at bay by reducing the circulation of scleroderma autoantibodies.\nEpidemiology.\nSystemic scleroderma is a rare disease, with an annual incidence that varies in different populations. Estimates of incidence (new cases per million people) range from 3.7 to 43 in the United Kingdom and Europe, 7.2 in Japan, 10.9 in Taiwan, 12.0 to 22.8 in Australia, 13.9 to 21.0 in the United States, and 21.2 in Buenos Aires. The interval of peak onset starts at age 30 and ends at age 50.\nGlobally, estimates of prevalence vary from 31.0 to 658.6 affected people per million. Systemic sclerosis has a female:male ratio of 3:1 (8:1 in mid- to late childbearing years). Incidence is twice as high among African Americans. Full-blooded Choctaw Native Americans in Oklahoma have the highest prevalence in the world (469 per 100,000).\nThe disease has some hereditary association. It may also be caused by an immune reaction to a virus (molecular mimicry) or by toxins.\nSociety and culture.\nSupport groups.\nThe Juvenile Scleroderma Network is an organization dedicated to providing emotional support and educational information to parents and their children living with juvenile scleroderma, supporting pediatric research to identify the cause of and the cure for juvenile scleroderma, and enhancing public awareness.\nIn the US, the Scleroderma Foundation is dedicated to raise awareness of the disease and assist those who are affected.\nThe Scleroderma Research Foundation sponsors research into the condition. Comedian and television presenter Bob Saget, a board member of the SRF, directed the 1996 ABC TV movie \"For Hope\", starring Dana Delany, which depicts a young woman fatally affected by scleroderma; the film was based on the experiences of Saget's sister Gay.\nScleroderma and Raynaud's UK is a British charity formed by the merger of two smaller organisations in 2016 to provide support for people with scleroderma and fund research into the condition.\nPrognosis.\nA 2018 study placed 10-year survival rates at 88%, without differentiation based on subtype. Diffuse systemic sclerosis, internal organ complications, and older age at diagnosis are associated with worse prognoses.\nResearch.\nGiven the difficulty in treating scleroderma, treatments with a smaller evidence base are often tried to control the disease. These include antithymocyte globulin and mycophenolate mofetil; some reports have shown improvements in the skin symptoms, as well as delaying the progress of systemic disease, but neither has been subjected to large clinical trials.\nAutologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is based on the assumption that autoimmune diseases such as systemic sclerosis occur when the white blood cells of the immune system attack the body. In this treatment, stem cells from the patient's blood are extracted and stored to preserve them. The patient's white blood cells are destroyed with cyclophosphamide and rabbit antibodies against the white blood cells. Then, the stored blood is returned to the patient's bloodstream to reconstitute a healthy blood and immune system that will not attack the body. The results of a phase-III trial, the Autologous Stem Cell Transplantation International Scleroderma (ASTIS) trial, with 156 patients, were published in 2014. HSCT itself has a high treatment mortality, so in the first year, the survival of patients in the treatment group was lower than the placebo group, but at the end of 10 years, the survival in the treatment group was significantly higher. The authors concluded that HSCT could be effective, if limited to patients who were healthy enough to survive HSCT itself. Therefore, HSCT should be given early in the progression of the disease, before it does damage. Patients with heart disease, and patients who smoked cigarettes, were less likely to survive. Another trial, the Stem Cell Transplant vs. Cyclophosphamide (SCOT) trial, is ongoing.\nAsengeprast is an experimental systemic scleroderma drug candidate. It is a small molecule inhibitor of the G-protein coupled receptor GPR68 with antifibrotic activity.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Over six thousand such narratives are estimated to exist; about 150 narratives were published as separate books or pamphlets. In the United States during the Great Depression (1930s), more than 2,300 additional oral histories on life during slavery were collected by writers sponsored and published by the Works Progress Administration, a New Deal program. Most of the 26 audio-recorded interviews are held by the Library of Congress.\nSome of the earliest memoirs of captivity known in the English-speaking world were written by Europeans colonists and later on Americans, captured and sometimes enslaved in North Africa by local Arab Muslims, usually Barbary pirates. These were part of a broad category of \"captivity narratives\". Beginning in the 17th century, these included accounts by European colonists and later American settlers in North America who were captured and held by American Indian tribes. Several well-known captivity narratives were published before the American Revolution, and they often followed forms established with the narratives of captivity in North Africa. North African accounts did not continue to appear after the Napoleonic Era; accounts from North Americans, captured by western Indian tribes migrating west continued until the end of the 19th century.\nAs a literary genre.\nThe development of slave narratives from autobiographical accounts to modern fictional works led to the establishment of slave narratives as a literary genre. This large rubric of this so-called \"captivity literature\" includes more generally \"any account of the life, or a major portion of the life, of a fugitive or former slave, either written or orally related by the slave himself or herself\". Whereas the first narratives told the stories of fugitive or freed slaves in a time of racial prejudice, they further developed into retrospective fictional novels and extended their influence until common days. Not only maintaining the memory and capturing the historical truth transmitted in these accounts, but slave narratives were primarily the tool for fugitive or former slaves to state their independence in the 19th century, and carry on and conserve authentic and true historical facts from a first-person perspective. They go further than just autobiographies, and are moreover \"a source for reconstructing historical experience\". The freed slaves that wrote the narratives are considered as historians, since \"memory and history come together\". These accounts link elements of the slave's personal life and destiny with key historical phenomena, such as the American Civil War and the Underground Railroad.\nIn simple, yet powerful storylines, slave narratives follow in general a plot common to all of them: starting from the initial situation, the slave in his master's home, the protagonist escapes in the wilderness and narrates the struggle for survival and recognition throughout his uncertain journey to freedom. After all, these narratives were written retrospectively by freed slaves and/or their abolitionist advocate, hence the focus on the transformation from the dehumanized slave to the self-emancipated free man. This change often entailed literacy as a means to overcome captivity, as the case of Frederick Douglass highlights. The narratives are very graphic to the extent as extensive accounts of e.g. whipping, abuse and rape of enslaved women are exposed in detail (see Treatment of slaves in the United States). The denunciation of the slave owners, in particular their cruelty and hypocrisy, is a recurring theme in slave narratives, and in some examples denounced the double standards (e.g. in Douglass's narrative, his slave owner Hopkins is a very religious, but also brutal man).\nAccording to James Olney, a typical outline looks the following way:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThere is no consensus about what exact type of literature slave narratives are, whether they can be considered as a proper genre, comprised in the large category captivity narrative, or are autobiographies, memoirs, testimonials, or novels; nonetheless, they play a big part in keeping up the memory of slavery and in approaching a topic that was considered as a taboo for a long time \u2013 especially since many denied and still deny the existence of slavery. Given the participation in the 19th century of abolitionist editors (at least in the United States), influential early 20th-century historians, such as Ulrich B. Phillips in 1929, suggested that, as a class, \"their authenticity was doubtful\". These doubts have been criticized following better academic research of these narratives, since the late 20th-century historians have more often validated the accounts of slaves about their own experiences.\nNorth American slave narratives.\nSlave narratives by African slaves from North America were first published in England in the 18th century. They soon became the main form of African-American literature in the 19th century. Slave narratives were publicized by abolitionists, who sometimes participated as editors, or writers if slaves were not literate. During the first half of the 19th century, the controversy over slavery in the United States led to impassioned literature on both sides of the issue.\nTo present the reality of slavery, a number of former slaves, such as Harriet Tubman, Harriet Jacobs, and Frederick Douglass, published accounts of their enslavement and their escapes to freedom. Lucy Delaney wrote an account that included the freedom suit waged by her mother in Missouri for their freedom. Eventually some 6,000 former slaves from North America and the Caribbean wrote accounts of their lives, and over 100 book-length accounts were published from formerly enslaved people worldwide.\nBefore the American Civil War, some authors wrote fictional accounts of slavery to create support for abolitionism. The prime example is \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" (1852) by Harriet Beecher Stowe. The success of her novel and the social tensions of the time brought a response by white Southern writers, such as William Gilmore Simms and Mary Eastman, who published what were called anti-Tom novels. Both kinds of novels were bestsellers in the 1850s.\nTales of religious redemption.\nFrom the 1770s to the 1820s, slave narratives generally gave an account of a spiritual journey leading to Christian redemption. The authors usually characterized themselves as Africans rather than slaves, as most were born in Africa.\nExamples include:\nSome more recent narratives, such as Petro Kilekwa's \"Slave Boy to Priest: The Autobiography of Padre Petro Kilekwa\" (1937), followed a similar theme.\nIslamic slave narratives.\nBy contrast, some slave narratives demonstrate the resiliency of Muslim spiritual identity while enslaved by Christian masters. These narratives tend to highlight the civilised, often aristocratic and scholarly background of their subjects, to emphasise their respectability and defy efforts at racial dehumanisation; and similarly, also tend to discuss their subjects' African Islamic (usually Fulani) background, to demonstrate that they have a civilisation of their own (in contrast to Christian redemption narratives, who answer racist dehumanisation by having black people achieve redemption through white Christians). \nThe slave narratives of Ayuba Suleiman Diallo are one such example. Educated as an Islamic scholar in the Fulani state of Futa Toro, Diallo was captured and sold to the Royal Africa Company in 1730, and thereafter brought to Maryland as a slave. During his enslavement, Diallo continued to practice Islam; and his aristocratic blood, education, literacy in multiple languages, and cultivated manner impressed elite audiences in America and Britain, challenging efforts to dehumanise him and his race. He was freed and returned to his homeland in 1734. James Oglethorpe\u2014once governor of the Royal Africa Company\u2014was moved by Diallo's suffering; and when he founded Georgia, he introduced a ban on slavery in 1735 (known popularly as the Georgia Experiment). Two contemporary slave narratives of Diallo's life exist: a biography by Thomas Bluett, titled \"Some Memories of the Life of Job, the Son of the Solomon\"; and a firsthand memoir, within Francis Moore's \"Travels Into the Inland Parts of Africa.\"\nOther examples include:\nTales to inspire the abolitionist movement.\nFrom the mid-1820s, writers consciously chose the autobiographical form to generate enthusiasms for the abolitionist movement. Some writers adopted literary techniques, including the use of fictionalized dialogue. Between 1835 and 1865 more than 80 such narratives were published. Recurrent features include: slave auctions, the break-up of families, and frequently two accounts of escapes, one of which is successful. As this was the period of the forced migration of an estimated one million slaves from the Upper South to the Deep South through the internal slave trade, the experiences of auctions and separation of families were common to many.\nExamples include:\nTales of progress.\nFollowing the defeat of the slave states of the Confederate South, the authors had less need to convey the evils of slavery. Some gave a sentimental account of plantation life and ended with the narrator adjusting to the new life of freedom. The emphasis of writers shifted conceptually toward a recounting of individual and racial progress rather than securing freedom.\nExamples include:\nWPA slave narratives.\nDuring the Great Depression of the 1930s, the New Deal Works Projects Administration (WPA) employed writers and researchers from the Federal Writers' Project to interview and document the stories of African Americans who were former slaves. Most had been children when the Thirteenth Amendment was passed. Produced between 1936 and 1938, the narratives recount the experiences of more than 2,300 former slaves. Some interviews were recorded; 23 of 26 known audio recordings are held by the American Folklife Center of the Library of Congress. The last interview of a former slave was with Fountain Hughes, then 101, in Baltimore, Maryland, in 1949. He was a grandson of a slave owned by President Thomas Jefferson at Monticello.\nNorth American slave narratives as travel literature.\nSlave narratives inherently involved travel and form a significant type of travel writing. As John Cox says in \"Traveling South\", \"travel was a necessary prelude to the publication of a narrative by a slave, for slavery could not be simultaneously experienced and written.\" Where many travel narratives are written by privileged travelers, slave narratives show people traveling despite significant legal barriers to their actions, and in this way are a distinct and essential element in how travel narratives formed the American character.\nNorth African slave narratives.\nIn comparison to North American and Caribbean slave narratives, the North African slave narratives in English were written by British and American white slaves captured (often at sea or through Barbary pirates) and enslaved in North Africa in the 18th and early 19th centuries. These narratives have a distinct form in that they highlight the \"otherness\" of the Muslim slave traders, whereas the African-American slave narratives often call slave traders to account as fellow Christians.\nNarratives focused on the central themes of freedom and liberty which drew inspiration from the American Revolution. Since the narratives include the recurrence of themes and events, quoting, and relying heavily upon each other it is believed by scholars that the main source of information was other narratives more so than real captivities. Female captives were depicted as Gothic fiction characters clinging to the hope of freedom, thus more relatable to the audience.\nExamples include:\nWomen's slave narratives.\nNarratives by enslaved women include the memoirs of Harriet Jacobs, Mary Prince, Mattie J. Jackson, and \"old Elizabeth,\" among others.\nIn her narrative, Mary Prince, a Bermuda-born woman and slave discusses her deep connection with her master's wife and the pity she felt for the wife as she witnessed the \"ill-treatment\" the wife suffered at the hands of her husband. Prince was taught to read by Moravian missionaries. Literacy, however, was not a common theme for all enslaved women. The life story of \"old Elizabeth\" was transcribed from her oral account at the age of 97.\nOther slave narratives.\nAs slavery has been practiced all over the world for millennia, some narratives cover places and times other than these main two. One example is the account given by John R. Jewitt, an English armourer enslaved for years by Maquinna of the Nootka people in the Pacific Northwest. The \"Canadian Encyclopedia\" calls his memoir a \"classic of captivity literature\" and it is a rich source of information about the indigenous people of Vancouver Island.\nMacuncuzade Mustafa Efendi, an Ottoman qadi, poet, and slave owner who was captured by the Hospitaller fleet off Cyprus in 1597 and was enslaved in Hospitaller Malta until he was ransomed in 1600, wrote a narrative entitled \"Baz Kest-i Hakiri-i Malta Sergiizess-i Esiri-i Malta\" based on notes and poems he had composed while imprisoned. A manuscript copy of it made by a scribe named Omer in 1602 is preserved at the Hac\u0131 Selim A\u011fa Library in \u00dcsk\u00fcdar, and its text was published in the 20th century. It is regarded as an important primary source about slavery in Malta.\nDuring the 19th and 20th centuries, the Embassies and legations of the Western countries on the Arabian Peninsula had secured the right to manumit any fugitive slave who sought refuge on the grounds of the embassy. Many fugitive slaves used this opportunity to seek freedom from slavery. When they applied for manumission, they provided a mini biography, which was a small slave narrative of their time of enslavement. One such example is from a fugitive from slavery in the Trucial States who sought manumission at the British Agents Office in Sharjah\non 23 March 1925 (year 1343 by the Islamic calendar): \n \"Statement made by Almas of Suwahil, aged 38. Recorded at Sharjah on 27th Shaban 1343 (= 23-3-25)\". \"When I was 8 years old a man of Suwahil kidnapped me and sold me to a man of Khazrah of Batinah named Said. I remained with him for 3 years then he sold me to a man of Umm-ul-Qaiwain named Matful. The man engaged me in diving and after some years my master Matful died and I was transferred to his son Khalifah. Two years after the death of his father Khalifah invited a party of men of Umm-ul-Qaiwain, and asked them to give evidence to the fact that he has manumitted me for the sake of God and no one should molest me. Khalifah died and after his death his brother claimed to Hamad bin Ibrahim, Chief of Umm-ul-Qaiwain that I was his slave. The Sheikh directed us to the Sharia for a decision. My manumission was proved in Sharia Court and Sheikh Hamad heard the witnesses himself and signed the decision of the Sharia Court. Now my master\u2019s brother is always threatening to re-enslave me. I am taking refuge with the High British Government and beg them to be kind enough to favour me with a Government Manumission Certificate so that I may be safe from threats and molestation\".\nThese slave narratives were registered by the British Agents Office.\nContemporary slave narratives.\nNonfiction.\nA contemporary slave narrative is a recent memoir written by a formerly enslaved person, or ghost-written on their behalf. Modern areas of the world in which slavery occurs include the Sudan. \"Escape from Slavery: The True Story of My Ten Years in Captivity \u2013 and My Journey to Freedom in America\" (2003) by Francis Bok and Edward Tivnan, and \"Slave\" by Mende Nazer and Damien Lewis, describe slavery experiences in the Sudan.\nFictional.\n\"The Underground Railroad\" by Colson Whitehead takes place in an alternative version of the 19th century. Cora, a slave on a cotton farm in Georgia escapes via the Underground Railroad. The novel was well received. It was said to possess \"the chilling, matter-of-fact power of the slave narratives collected by the Federal Writers' Project in the 1930s, with echoes of Toni Morrison's \"Beloved\"\" and could be considered as a modern-tale fictional slave narrative.\nNeo-slave narratives.\nA neo-slave narrative \u2014 a term coined by Ishmael Reed while working on his 1976 novel Flight to Canada and used by him in a 1984 interview \u2014 is a modern fictional work set in the slavery era by contemporary authors or substantially concerned with depicting the experience or the effects of enslavement in the New World. The works are largely classified as novels, but may pertain to poetical works as well. The renaissance of the postmodern slave narratives in the 20th century was a means to deal retrospectively with slavery, and to give a fictional account of historical facts from the first-person perspective.\nExamples include:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Dubbed the \"King of Horror\", he is widely known for his horror novels and has also explored other genres, among them suspense, crime, science-fiction, fantasy, and mystery. Though known primarily for his novels, he has written approximately 200 short stories, most of which have been published in collections. \nHis debut, \"Carrie\" (1974), established him in horror. \"Different Seasons\" (1982), a collection of four novellas, was his first major departure from the genre. Among the films adapted from King's fiction are \"Carrie\" (1976), \"The Shining\" (1980), \"The Dead Zone\" and \"Christine\" (both 1983), \"Stand by Me\" (1986), \"Misery\" (1990), \"The Shawshank Redemption\" (1994), \"Dolores Claiborne\" (1995), \"The Green Mile\" (1999), \"The Mist\" (2007), \"It\" (2017), and \"The Long Walk\" (2025). He has published under the pseudonym Richard Bachman and has co-written works with other authors, notably his friend Peter Straub and sons Joe Hill and Owen King. He has also written nonfiction, notably \"Danse Macabre\" (1981) and \"\" (2000).\nAmong other awards, King has won the O. Henry Award for \"The Man in the Black Suit\" (1994) and the \"Los Angeles Times\" Book Prize for Mystery/Thriller for \"11/22/63\" (2011). He has also won honors for his overall contributions to literature, including the 2003 Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters, the 2007 Grand Master Award from the Mystery Writers of America and the 2014 National Medal of Arts. Joyce Carol Oates called King \"a brilliantly rooted, psychologically 'realistic' writer for whom the American scene has been a continuous source of inspiration, and American popular culture a vast cornucopia of possibilities.\"\nEarly life and education.\nKing was born in Portland, Maine, on September 21, 1947. His father, Donald Edwin King, a traveling vacuum salesman after returning from World War II, was born in Indiana with the surname Pollock, changing it to King as an adult. King's mother was Nellie Ruth King (n\u00e9e Pillsbury). His parents were married in Scarborough, Maine, on July 23, 1939. They lived with Donald's family in Chicago before moving to Croton-on-Hudson, New York. King's parents returned to Maine towards the end of World War II, living in a modest house in Scarborough. He is of Scots-Irish descent.\nWhen King was two, his father left the family. His mother raised him and his older brother David by herself, sometimes under great financial strain. They moved from Scarborough and depended on relatives in Chicago, Illinois; Croton-on-Hudson; West De Pere, Wisconsin; Fort Wayne, Indiana; Malden, Massachusetts; and Stratford, Connecticut. When King was 11, his family moved to Durham, Maine, where his mother cared for her parents until their deaths. After that, she became a caregiver in a local residential facility for the mentally challenged. \nKing says he started writing when he was \"about six or seven, just copying panels out of comic books and then making up my own stories ... Film was also a major influence. I loved the movies from the start. So when I started to write, I had a tendency to write in images because that was all I knew at the time.\" Regarding his interest in horror, he says \"my childhood was pretty ordinary, except from a very early age, I wanted to be scared. I just did.\" He recalls showing his mother a story he copied out of a comic book. She responded: \"I bet you could do better. Write one of your own.\" He recalls \"an immense feeling of \"possibility\" at the idea, as if I had been ushered into a vast building filled with closed doors and had been given the key to open any I liked.\" King was a voracious reader in his youth: \"I read everything from Nancy Drew to \"Psycho\". My favorite was \"The Shrinking Man\", by Richard Matheson\u2014I was 8 when I found that.\" \nKing's aunt Gert paid him a quarter for every story he produced; his surviving earliest works include \"Jhonathan and the Witchs\", which he wrote at the age of nine.\nKing asked a bookmobile driver, \"Do you have any stories about how kids really are?\" She gave him a copy of \"Lord of the Flies\", which proved formative: \"It was, so far as I can remember, the first book with hands\u2014strong ones that reached out of the pages and seized me by the throat. It said to me, 'This is not just entertainment; it's life or death.'... To me, \"Lord of the Flies\" has always represented what novels are \"for,\" why they are indispensable.\" He attended Durham Elementary School and entered Lisbon High School in Lisbon Falls, Maine, in 1962. He contributed to \"Dave's Rag\", the newspaper his brother printed with a mimeograph machine, and later sold stories to his friends. His first independently published story was \"I Was a Teenage Grave Robber\", serialized over four issues of the fanzine \"Comics Review\" in 1965. He was a sports reporter for Lisbon's \"Weekly Enterprise\".\nIn 1966, King entered the University of Maine at Orono on a scholarship. While there, he wrote for the student newspaper, \"The Maine Campus\", and found mentors in the professors Edward Holmes and Burton Hatlen. King participated in a writing workshop organized by Hatlen, where he fell in love with Tabitha Spruce. King graduated in 1970 with a Bachelor of Arts in English, and his daughter Naomi Rachel was born that year. King and Spruce wed in 1971. King paid tribute to Hatlen: \"Burt was the greatest English teacher I ever had. It was he who first showed me the way to the pool, which he called 'the language pool, the myth-pool, where we all go down to drink.' That was in 1968. I have trod the path that leads there often in the years since, and I can think of no better place to spend one's days; the water is still sweet, and the fish still swim.\"\nCareer.\nBeginnings.\nKing sold his first professional short story, \"The Glass Floor\", to \"Startling Mystery Stories\" in 1967. After graduating from the University of Maine, King earned a certificate to teach high school but was unable to find a teaching post immediately. He sold short stories to magazines like \"Cavalier\". Many of these early stories were republished in \"Night Shift\" (1978). In 1971, King was hired as an English teacher at Hampden Academy in Hampden, Maine. He continued to contribute short stories to magazines and worked on ideas for novels, including the anti-war novel \"Sword in the Darkness\", still unpublished.\n1970s: \"Carrie\" to \"The Dead Zone\".\nKing recalls the origin of his debut, \"Carrie\": \"Two unrelated ideas, adolescent cruelty and telekinesis, came together.\" It began as a short story intended for \"Cavalier\"; King tossed the first three pages in the trash but his wife, Tabitha, recovered them, saying she wanted to know what happened next. She told him: \"You've got something here. I really think you do.\" He followed her advice and expanded it into a novel. Per \"The Guardian\", \"Carrie\" \"is the story of Carrie White, a high-school student with latent\u2014and then, as the novel progresses, developing\u2014telekinetic powers. It's brutal in places, affecting in others (Carrie's relationship with her almost hysterically religious mother being a particularly damaged one), and gory in even more.\" \"The New York Times\" noted that \"King does more than tell a story. He is a schoolteacher himself, and he gets into Carrie's mind as well as into the minds of her classmates. He also knows a thing or two about symbolism \u2014 blood symbolism especially.\"\nKing was teaching \"Dracula\" to high school students and wondered what would happen if Old World vampires came to a small New England town. This was the germ of Salem's Lot\", which King called \"\"Peyton Place\" meets \"Dracula\"\". King's mother died from uterine cancer around the time Salem's Lot\" was published. After his mother's death, King and his family moved to Boulder, Colorado. He paid a visit to the Stanley Hotel in Estes Park which provided the basis for \"The Shining\", about an alcoholic writer and his family taking care of a hotel for the winter. \nKing's family returned to Auburn, Maine in 1975, where he completed \"The Stand\", an apocalyptic novel about a pandemic and its aftermath. King recalls that it was the novel that took him the longest to write, and that it was \"also the one my longtime readers still seem to like the best\". In 1977, the Kings, with the addition of Owen Philip, their third and youngest child, traveled briefly to England. They returned to Maine that fall, and King began teaching creative writing at the University of Maine. The courses he taught on horror provided the basis for his first nonfiction book, \"Danse Macabre\". In 1979, he published \"The Dead Zone\", about an ordinary man gifted with second sight. It was the first of his novels to take place in Castle Rock, Maine. King later reflected that with \"The Dead Zone\", \"I really hit my stride.\"\n1980s: \"Different Seasons\" to \"The Dark Half\".\nIn 1982, King published \"Different Seasons\", a collection of four novellas with a more serious dramatic bent than the horror fiction for which he had become famous. Alan Cheuse wrote \"Each of the first three novellas has its hypnotic moments, and the last one is a horrifying little gem.\" Three of the four novellas were adapted as films: \"The Body\" as \"Stand by Me\" (1986); \"Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption\" as \"The Shawshank Redemption\" (1994); and \"Apt Pupil\" as the film of the same name (1998). The fourth, \"The Breathing Method\", won the British Fantasy Award for Best Short Fiction. King recalls \"I got the best reviews in my life. And that was the first time that people thought, woah, this isn't really a horror thing.\"\nKing struggled with addiction throughout the decade and often wrote under the influence of cocaine and alcohol; he says he \"barely remembers writing\" \"Cujo\". In 1983, he published \"Christine\", \"A love triangle involving 17-year-old misfit Arnie Cunningham, his new girlfriend and a haunted 1958 Plymouth Fury.\" Later that year, he published \"Pet Sematary\", which he had written in the late 1970s, when his family was living near a highway that \"used up a lot of animals\" as a neighbor put it. His daughter's cat was killed, and they buried it in a pet cemetery built by the local children. King imagined a burial ground beyond it that could raise the dead, albeit imperfectly. He initially found it too disturbing to publish, but resurrected it to fulfill his contract with Doubleday. \nIn 1985, King published \"Skeleton Crew\", a book of short fiction including \"The Reach\" and \"The Mist\". He recalls: \"I would be asked, 'What happened in your childhood that makes you want to write those terrible things?' I couldn't think of any real answer to that. And I thought to myself, 'Why don't you write a final exam on horror, and put in all the monsters that everyone was afraid of as a kid? Put in Frankenstein, the werewolf, the vampire, the mummy, the giant creatures that ate up New York in the old B movies. Put 'em all in there.\" These influences coalesced into \"It\", about a shapeshifting monster that takes the form of its victims' fears and haunts the town of Derry, Maine. He said he thought he was done writing about monsters, and wanted to \"bring on all the monsters one last time\u2026and call it It.\" \"It\" won the August Derleth Award in 1987.\n1987 was an unusually productive year for King. He published \"The Eyes of the Dragon\", a high fantasy novel which he originally wrote for his daughter. He published \"Misery\", about a popular writer who is injured in a car wreck and held captive by Annie Wilkes, his self-described \"number-one fan\". \"Misery\" shared the inaugural Bram Stoker Award with \"Swan Song\" by Robert R. McCammon. King says the novel was influenced by his experiences with addiction: \"Annie was my drug problem, and she was my number-one fan. God, she never wanted to leave.\" He published \"The Tommyknockers\", a science fiction novel filled, he says, with metaphors for addiction. After the book was published, King's wife staged an intervention, and he agreed to seek treatment for addiction. Two years later, he published \"The Dark Half\", about an author whose literary alter-ego takes on a life of his own. In the author's note, King writes that \"I am indebted to the late Richard Bachman.\"\n1990s: \"Four Past Midnight\" to \"Hearts in Atlantis\".\nIn 1990, King published \"Four Past Midnight\", a collection of four novellas with the common theme of time. In 1991, he published \"Needful Things\", his first novel since achieving sobriety, billed as \"The Last Castle Rock Story\". In 1992, he published \"Gerald's Game\" and \"Dolores Claiborne\", two novels about women loosely linked by a solar eclipse. The latter novel is narrated by the title character in an unbroken monologue; Mark Singer described it as \"a morally riveting confession from the earthy mouth of a sixty-six-year-old Maine coastal-island native with a granite-hard life but not a grain of self-pity\". King said he based the character of Claiborne on his mother. \nIn 1994, King's story \"The Man in the Black Suit\" was published in the Halloween issue of \"The New Yorker\". The story went on to win the 1996 O. Henry Award. In 1996, King published \"The Green Mile,\" the story of a death row inmate, as a serial novel in six parts. It had the distinction of holding the first, fourth, tenth, twelfth, fourteenth, and fifteenth positions on the \"New York Times\" paperback-best-seller list at the same time. In 1998, he published \"Bag of Bones\", his first book with Scribner, about a recently widowed novelist. Several reviewers said that it showed King's maturation as a writer; Charles de Lint wrote \"He hasn't forsaken the spookiness and scares that have made him a brand name, but he uses them more judiciously now... The present-day King has far more insight into the human condition than did his younger self, and better yet, all the skills required to share it with us.\" \"Bag of Bones\" won the Bram Stoker and August Derleth Awards. \nIn 1999, he published \"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon\", about a girl who gets lost in the woods and finds solace in listening to broadcasts of Boston Red Sox games, and \"Hearts in Atlantis\", a book of linked novellas and short stories about coming of age in the 1960s. Later that year, King was hospitalized after being hit by a van. Reflecting on the incident, he said \"it occurs to me that I have nearly been killed by a character out of one of my own novels. It's almost funny.\" He said his nurses were \"told in no uncertain terms, don't make any \"Misery\" jokes\".\n2000s: \"On Writing\" to \"Under the Dome\".\nIn 2000, King published \"\", a mix of memoir and style manual which \"The Wall Street Journal\" called \"a one-of-a-kind classic\". Later that year he published \"Riding the Bullet\", \"the world's first mass e-book, with more than 500,000 downloads\". Inspired by its success, he began publishing an epistolary horror novel, \"The Plant\", in online installments using the pay what you want method provided by Amazon.com's Honor System. He suggested readers pay $1 per installment, and said he'd only continue publishing if 75% of readers paid. When \"The Plant\" folded, the public assumed that King had abandoned the project because sales were unsuccessful, but King later said he had simply run out of stories. The unfinished novel is still available from King's official site, now free. \nIn 2002, King published \"From a Buick 8\", a return to the territory of \"Christine\". In 2005, he published the mystery \"The Colorado Kid\" for the Hard Case Crime imprint. In 2006, he published \"Cell,\" in which a mysterious signal broadcast over cell phones turns users into mindless killers. That same year, he published \"Lisey's Story\", about the widow of a novelist. He calls it his favorite of his novels, because \"I've always felt that marriage creates its own secret world, and only in a long marriage can two people at least approach real knowledge about each other. I wanted to write about that, and felt that I actually got close to what I really wanted to say.\" In 2007, King served as guest editor for the annual anthology \"The Best American Short Stories\".\nIn 2008, King published \"Duma Key\", his first novel set in Florida, and the collection \"Just After Sunset\". In 2009, it was announced he would serve as a writer for \"Fangoria\". King's novel \"Under the Dome\" was published later that year, and debuted at No. 1 on \"The New York Times\" Bestseller List. Janet Maslin said of it, \"Hard as this thing is to hoist, it's even harder to put down.\"\n2010s: \"Full Dark, No Stars\" to \"The Institute\".\nIn 2010, King published \"Full Dark, No Stars\", a collection of four novellas with the common theme of retribution. In 2011, he published \"11/22/63\", about a time portal leading to 1958, and an English teacher who travels through it to try to prevent the Kennedy assassination. Errol Morris called it \"one of the best time travel stories since H. G. Wells\". In 2013, he published \"Joyland\", his second book for Hard Case Crime. Later that year, he published \"Doctor Sleep\", a sequel to \"The Shining.\"\nDuring his Chancellor's Speaker Series talk at University of Massachusetts Lowell on December 7, 2012, King said that he was writing a crime novel about a retired policeman being taunted by a murderer, with the working title \"Mr. Mercedes\". In an interview with \"Parade\", he confirmed that the novel was \"more or less\" completed. It was published in 2014 and won the Edgar Allan Poe Award for Best Novel. He returned to horror with \"Revival\", which he called \"a nasty, dark piece of work\". King announced in June 2014 that \"Mr. Mercedes\" was part of a trilogy; the sequel, \"Finders Keepers\", was published in 2015. The third book of the trilogy, \"End of Watch\", was released in 2016. In 2018, he released \"The Outsider\", which features the character Holly Gibney, and the novella \"Elevation\". In 2019, he released \"The Institute\". \n2020s: \"If It Bleeds\" to present.\nIn 2020, King released \"If It Bleeds\", a collection of four novellas. In 2021, he published \"Later\", his third book for Hard Case Crime. In 2022, King released the novel \"Fairy Tale\". \"Holly\", about Holly Gibney was released in September 2023. In November 2023, the short story collection \"You Like It Darker\", featuring twelve stories (seven previously published and five unreleased) was published by Scribner in May 2024. The book debuted at No. 1 on \"The New York Times\" fiction best-seller list for the week ending May 25, 2024. King announced a novel named \"Never Flinch\", featuring once again the character Holly Gibney\",\" on November 18, 2024. The novel was released on May 27, 2025.\nPseudonyms.\nKing published five short novels\u2014\"Rage\" (1977), \"The Long Walk\" (1979), \"Roadwork\" (1981), \"The Running Man\" (1982) and \"Thinner\" (1984)\u2014under the pseudonym Richard Bachman. He explains: \"I did that because back in the early days of my career there was a feeling in the publishing business that one book a year was all the public would accept...eventually the public got wise to this because you can change your name but you can't really disguise your style.\" Bachman's surname is derived from the band Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive and his first name is a nod to Richard Stark, the pseudonym Donald E. Westlake used to publish his darker work. The Bachman books are grittier than King's usual fare; King called his alter-ego \"Dark-toned, despairing...not a very nice guy.\" A Literary Guild member praised \"Thinner\" as \"what Stephen King would write like if Stephen King could really write.\" \nBachman was exposed as King's pseudonym in 1985 by Steve Brown, a Washington, D.C. bookstore clerk who noticed stylistic similarities between King and Bachman and located publisher's records at the Library of Congress that named King as the author of \"Rage\". King announced Bachman's death from \"cancer of the pseudonym\". King reflected that \"Richard Bachman began his career not as a delusion but as a sheltered place where I could publish a few early books which I felt readers might like. Then he began to grow and come alive, as the creatures of a writer's imagination so frequently do... He took on his own reality, that's all, and when his cover was blown, he died.\" Originally, King planned \"Misery\" to be released under the pseudonym before his identity was discovered.\nWhen \"Desperation\" (1996) was released, the companion novel \"The Regulators\" was published as a \"discovered manuscript\" by Bachman. In 2006, King announced that he had discovered another Bachman novel, \"Blaze\", which was published the following year. The original manuscript had been held at the University of Maine for many years and had been covered by numerous King experts. King rewrote the original 1973 manuscript for its publication.\nKing has used other pseudonyms. In 1972, the short story \"The Fifth Quarter\" was published under the name John Swithen (a \"Carrie\" character) in \"Cavalier\". \"Charlie the Choo-Choo: From the World of The Dark Tower\" was published in 2016 under the pseudonym Beryl Evans and illustrated by Ned Dameron. It is adapted from a fictional book central to the plot of King's \"\".\n\"The Dark Tower\".\nIn the late 1970s, King began a series about a lone gunslinger, Roland, who pursues the \"Man in Black\" in an alternate universe that is a cross between J. R. R. Tolkien's Middle-earth and the American Wild West as depicted by Clint Eastwood and Sergio Leone in their spaghetti Westerns. The first story, \"\", was initially published in five installments in \"The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction\" under the editorship of Edward L. Ferman, from 1977 to 1981. It grew into an eight-volume epic, \"The Dark Tower\", published between 1978 and 2012.\nCollaborations.\nLiterature.\nKing co-wrote two novels with Peter Straub, \"The Talisman\" (1984) and \"Black House\" (2001). Straub recalls that \"We tried to make it as difficult as possible for readers to identify who wrote what. Eventually, we were able to successfully imitate each other's style... Steve threw in more commas or clauses, and I kind of made things more simple in sentence structure. And I tried to make things as vivid as I could because Steve is just fabulous at that, and also I tried to write more colloquially.\" Straub said the only person who could correctly identify who wrote which passages was a fellow author, Neil Gaiman.\nKing and the photographer F-Stop Fitzgerald collaborated on the coffee table book \"Nightmares in the Sky: Gargoyles and Grotesques\" (1988). He produced an artist's book with designer Barbara Kruger, \"My Pretty Pony\" (1989), published in a limited edition of 250 by the Library Fellows of the Whitney Museum of American Art. Alfred A. Knopf released it in a general trade edition. \nKing co-wrote \"Throttle\" (2009) with his son Joe Hill. The novella is an homage to Richard Matheson's \"Duel\". Their second collaboration, \"In the Tall Grass\" (2012), was published in two parts in \"Esquire\". King and his son Owen co-wrote \"Sleeping Beauties\" (2018), set in a West Virginia women's prison. King and Richard Chizmar co-wrote \"Gwendy's Button Box\" (2017). A sequel, \"Gwendy's Magic Feather\" (2019), was a solo effort by Chizmar. In 2022, King and Chizmar rejoined forces for \"Gwendy's Final Task\".\nFilm and television.\nKing made his screenwriting debut with George A. Romero's \"Creepshow\" (1982), a tribute to EC horror comics. In 1985, he wrote another horror anthology film, \"Cat's Eye\". Rob Reiner, whose film \"Stand by Me\" (1986) is an adaptation of King's novella \"The Body\", named his production company Castle Rock Entertainment after King's fictional town. Castle Rock Entertainment would produce other King adaptations, including Reiner's \"Misery\" (1990) and Frank Darabont's \"The Shawshank Redemption\" (1994).\nIn 1986, King made his directorial debut with \"Maximum Overdrive\", an adaptation of his story \"Trucks\". He recalls: \"I was coked out of my mind all through its production, and really didn't know what I was doing.\" It was neither a critical nor a commercial success; King was nominated for a Golden Raspberry for Worst Director, but lost to Prince, for \"Under the Cherry Moon\".\nIn the 1990s, King wrote several miniseries: \"Golden Years\" (1991), \"The Stand\" (1994), \"The Shining\" (1997) and \"Storm of the Century\" (1999). He wrote the miniseries \"Rose Red\" (2002); \"\" (2001) was written by Ridley Pearson and published anonymously as a tie-in for the series. He also developed \"Kingdom Hospital\" (2004), based on Lars von Trier's \"The Kingdom\".\nMusic and theater.\nKing collaborated with Stan Winston and Mick Garris on the music video \"Michael Jackson's Ghosts\" (1996). He co-wrote the musical \"Ghost Brothers of Darkland County\" (2012) with T. Bone Burnett and John Mellencamp. A soundtrack album was released, featuring Taj Mahal, Elvis Costello and Rosanne Cash, among others.\nComics.\nIn 1985, King wrote a few pages of the benefit X-Men comic book \"Heroes for Hope Starring the X-Men\". He wrote the introduction to \"Batman\" No. 400, an anniversary issue where he expressed his preference for the character over Superman. In 2010, DC Comics premiered \"American Vampire\", a comic book series co-written by King and Scott Snyder and illustrated by Rafael Albuquerque. King wrote the backstory of the first American vampire, Skinner Sweet, in the first five-issues story arc.\nStyle, themes and influences.\nStyle.\nIn \"\", King recalls:When, during the course of an interview for \"The New Yorker\", I told the interviewer (Mark Singer) that I believed stories are found things, like fossils in the ground, he said that he didn't believe me. I replied that that was fine, as long as he believed that \"I\" believe it. And I do. Stories aren't souvenir tee-shirts or GameBoys. Stories are relics, part of an undiscovered pre-existing world. The writer's job is to use the tools in his or her toolbox to get as much of each one out of the ground intact as possible. Sometimes the fossil you uncover is small, a seashell. Sometimes it's enormous, a \"Tyrannosaurus Rex\" with all those gigantic ribs and grinning teeth. Either way, short story or thousand-page whopper of a novel, the techniques of excavation remain basically the same.King often starts with a \"what-if\" scenario, asking what would happen if an alcoholic writer was stranded with his family in a haunted hotel (\"The Shining\"), or if one could see the outcome of future events (\"The Dead Zone\"), or if one could travel in time to alter the course of history (\"11/22/63\"). He writes that \"The situation comes first. The characters\u2014always flat and unfeatured, to begin with\u2014come next. Once these things are fixed in my mind, I begin to narrate. I often have an idea of what the outcome may be, but I have never demanded a set of characters that they do things my way. On the contrary, I want them to do things \"their\" way. In some instances, the outcome is what I visualized. In most, however, it's something I never expected.\" \nJoyce Carol Oates called King \"both a storyteller and an inventor of startling images and metaphors, which linger long in the memory.\" An example of King's imagery is seen in \"The Body\" when the narrator recalls a childhood clubhouse with a tin roof and rusty screen door: \"No matter what time of day you looked out that screen door, it looked like sunset... When it rained, being inside the club was like being inside a Jamaican steel drum.\" King writes that \"The use of simile and other figurative language is one of the chief delights of fiction\u2014reading it and writing it, as well. [...] By comparing two seemingly unrelated objects\u2014a restaurant bar and a cave, a mirror and a mirage\u2014we are sometimes able to see an old thing in a new and vivid way. Even if the result is mere clarity instead of beauty, I think writer and reader are participating together in a kind of miracle. Maybe that's drawing it a little strong, but yeah\u2014it's what I believe.\"\nThemes.\nWhen asked if fear was his main subject, King said \"In every life you get to a point where you have to deal with something that's inexplicable to you, whether it's the doctor saying you have cancer or a prank phone call. So whether you talk about ghosts or vampires or Nazi war criminals living down the block, we're still talking about the same thing, which is an intrusion of the extraordinary into ordinary life and how we deal with it. What that shows about our character and our interactions with others and the society we live in interests me a lot more than monsters and vampires and ghouls and ghosts.\" \nJoyce Carol Oates said that \"Stephen King's characteristic subject is small-town American life, often set in fictitious Derry, Maine; tales of family life, marital life, the lives of children banded together by age, circumstance, and urgency, where parents prove oblivious or helpless. The human heart in conflict with itself\u2014in the guise of the malevolent Other. The 'gothic' imagination magnifies the vicissitudes of 'real life' in order to bring it into a sharper and clearer focus.\" King's \"The Body\" is about coming of age, a theme he has returned to several times, for example in \"Joyland\".\nKing often uses authors as characters, such as Ben Mears in \"'Salem's Lot\", Jack Torrance in \"The Shining\", adult Bill Denbrough in \"It\" and Mike Noonan in \"Bag of Bones\". He has extended this to breaking the fourth wall by including himself as a character in three novels of \"The Dark Tower\". Among other things, this allows King to explore themes of authorship; George Stade writes that \"Misery\" \"is a parable in chiller form of the popular writer's relation to his audience, which holds him prisoner and dictates what he writes, on pain of death\" while \"The Dark Half\" \"is a parable in chiller form of the popular writer's relation to his creative genius, the vampire within him, the part of him that only awakes to raise Cain when he writes.\"\nIntroducing King at the National Book Awards, Walter Mosley said \"Stephen King once said that daily life is the frame that makes the picture. His commitment, as I see it, is to celebrate and empower the everyday man and woman as they buy aspirin and cope with cancer. He takes our daily lives and makes them into something heroic. He takes our world, validates our distrust of it and then helps us to see that there's a chance to transcend the muck. He tells us that even if we fail in our struggles, we are still worthy enough to pass on our energies in the survival of humanity.\" In his acceptance speech for the Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters, King said:\"Frank Norris, the author of \"McTeague\", said something like this: 'What should I care if they, i.e., the critics, single me out for sneers and laughter? I never truckled, I never lied. I told the truth.' And that's always been the bottom line for me. The story and the people in it may be make believe but I need to ask myself over and over if I've told the truth about the way real people would behave in a similar situation... We understand that fiction is a lie to begin with. To ignore the truth inside the lie is to sin against the craft, in general, and one's own work in particular.\"\nInfluences.\nIn \"On Writing\", King says \"If you want to be a writer, you must do two things above all: read a lot and write a lot.\" He emphasizes the importance of good description, which \"begins with clear seeing and ends with clear writing, the kind of writing that employs fresh images and simple vocabulary. I began learning my lessons in this regard by reading Chandler, Hammett, and Ross Macdonald; I gained perhaps even more respect for the power of compact, descriptive language from reading T. S. Eliot (those ragged claws scuttling across the ocean floor; those coffee spoons), and William Carlos Williams (white chickens, red wheelbarrow, the plums that were in the ice box, so sweet and so cold).\"\nKing has called Richard Matheson \"the author who influenced me most\". Other influences include Ray Bradbury, Joseph Payne Brennan, James M. Cain, Jack Finney, Graham Greene, Elmore Leonard, John D. MacDonald, Don Robertson and Thomas Williams. He often pays homage to classic horror stories by retelling them in a modern context. He recalls that while writing \"'Salem's Lot\", \"I decided I wanted to try to use the book partially as a form of literary homage (as Peter Straub had done in \"Ghost Story\", working in the tradition of such 'classical' ghost story writers as Henry James, M. R. James, and Nathaniel Hawthorne). So my novel bears an intentional similarity to Bram Stoker's \"Dracula\", and after a while it began to seem I was playing an interesting\u2014to me, at least\u2014game of literary racquet-ball: \"'Salem's Lot\" itself was the ball and \"Dracula\" was the wall I kept hitting it against, watching to see how and where it could bounce, so I could hit it again. As a matter of fact, it took some pretty interesting bounces, and I ascribe this mostly to the fact that, while my ball existed in the twentieth century, the wall was very much a product of the nineteenth.\" Similarly, King's \"Revival\" is a modern riff on Mary Shelley's \"Frankenstein\". King dedicated it to \"the people who built my house\": Shelley, Stoker, H. P. Lovecraft, Clark Ashton Smith, Donald Wandrei, Fritz Leiber, August Derleth, Shirley Jackson, Robert Bloch, Straub and Arthur Machen, \"whose short novel \"The Great God Pan\" has haunted me all my life\". \nHe provided an appreciation for \"The Golden Argosy\", a collection of short stories featuring Cather, Hemingway, Faulkner, Fitzgerald and others: \"I first found \"The Golden Argosy\" in a Lisbon Falls (Maine) bargain barn called the Jolly White Elephant, where it was on offer for $2.25. At that time I only had four dollars, and spending over half of it on one book, even a hardcover, was a tough decision. I've never regretted it... \"The Golden Argosy\" taught me more about good writing than all the writing classes I've ever taken. It was the best $2.25 I ever spent.\"\nReception and influence.\nCritical reception.\nKing has been praised for his use of realistic detail. In \"A Century of Great Suspense Stories\", editor Jeffery Deaver wrote that \"While there were many good best-selling writers before him, King, more than anybody since John D. MacDonald, brought reality to genre novels. He has often remarked that \"'Salem's Lot\" was '\"Peyton Place\" meets \"Dracula\"'. And so it was. The rich characterization, the careful and caring social eye, the interplay of story line and character development announced that writers could take worn themes such as vampirism and make them fresh again. Before King, many popular writers found their efforts to make their books serious blue-penciled by their editors. 'Stuff like that gets in the way of the story,' they were told. Well, it's stuff like that that has made King so popular, and helped free the popular name from the shackles of simple genre writing. He is a master of masters.\" Daniel Mendelsohn, reviewing \"Bag of Bones\", wrote that \"Stephen King is so widely accepted as America's master of paranormal terrors that you can forget his real genius is for the everyday... This is a book about reanimation: the ghosts', of course, but also Mike's, his desire to re-embrace love and work after a long bereavement that King depicts with an eye for the kind of small but moving details that don't typically distinguish blockbuster horror novels.\"\nMany critics argue that King has matured as a writer. In his analysis of post\u2013World War II horror fiction, \"The Modern Weird Tale\" (2001), S. T. Joshi devotes a chapter to King's work. Joshi argues that King's best-known works are his worst, describing them as mostly bloated, illogical, maudlin and prone to \"deus ex machina\" endings. Despite these criticisms, Joshi argues that since \"Gerald's Game\" (1992), King has been tempering the worst of his writing faults, producing books that are leaner, more believable and generally better written.\nIn 2003, King was honored by the National Book Awards with a lifetime achievement award, the Medal of Distinguished Contribution to American Letters. Some in the literary community expressed disapproval of the award: Richard E. Snyder, the former CEO of Simon &amp; Schuster, described King's work as \"non-literature\" and critic Harold Bloom denounced the choice: \"The decision to give the National Book Foundation's annual award for 'distinguished contribution' to Stephen King is extraordinary, another low in the shocking process of dumbing down our cultural life. I've described King in the past as a writer of penny dreadfuls, but perhaps even that is too kind. He shares nothing with Edgar Allan Poe. What he is is an immensely inadequate writer on a sentence-by-sentence, paragraph-by-paragraph, book-by-book basis.\"\nKing acknowledged the controversy in his acceptance speech: \"There are some people who have spoken out passionately about giving me this medal. There are some people who think it's an extraordinarily bad idea. There have been some people who have spoken out who think it's an extraordinarily good idea. You know who you are and where you stand and most of you who are here tonight are on my side. I'm glad for that. But I want to say it doesn't matter in a sense which side you were on. The people who speak out, speak out because they are passionate about the book, about the word, about the page and, in that sense, we're all brothers and sisters. Give yourself a hand.\" Shirley Hazzard, whose novel \"The Great Fire\" was that year's National Book Award winner, responded by criticizing King; she later said that she had never read him.\nRoger Ebert wrote that \"A lot people were outraged when he was honored at the National Book Awards, as if a popular writer couldn't be taken seriously. But after finding that his book \"On Writing\" has more useful and observant things to say about the craft than any book since Strunk and White's \"The Elements of Style\", I have gotten over my own snobbery. King has, after all, been responsible for the movies \"The Shawshank Redemption\", \"The Green Mile\", \"The Dead Zone\", \"Misery\", \"Apt Pupil\", \"Christine\", \"Hearts in Atlantis\", \"Stand By Me\" and \"Carrie\"... And we must not be ungrateful for \"Silver Bullet\", which I awarded three stars because it was 'either the worst movie made from a Stephen King story, or the funniest', and you know which side of that I'm gonna come down on.\"\nAppraisal by other authors.\nCynthia Ozick said that, upon giving a reading with King, \"It dawned on me as I listened to him that, never mind all the best sellers and all the stereotypes -- this man is a genuine, true-born \"writer\", and that was a revelation. He is not Tom Clancy. He writes sentences, and he has a literary focus, and his writing is filled with literary history. It's not glib, it's not just contemporary chatter and it's not stupid -- that's a bad way to say that something's smart, but that's what I mean.\" \nJoyce Carol Oates praised King's sense of place: \"His fiction is famously saturated with the atmosphere of Maine; much of his mostly vividly imagined work\u2014\"Salem's Lot\", \"Dolores Claiborne\", the elegantly composed story 'The Reach', for instance\u2014is a poetic evocation of that landscape, its history and its inhabitants.\" Oates included the latter story in the second edition of \"The Oxford Book of American Short Stories\".\nPeter Straub compared King favorably to Charles Dickens: \"Both are novelists of vast popularity and enormous bibliographies, both are beloved writers with a pronounced taste for the morbid and grotesque, both display a deep interest in the underclass.\" Straub included King's short story \"That Feeling, You Can Only Say What It Is in French\" in the Library of America anthology \"American Fantastic Tales\".\nDavid Foster Wallace assigned \"Carrie\" and \"The Stand\" while teaching at Illinois State University. Wallace praised King's ear for dialogue: \"He's one of the first people to talk about real Americans and how they live, to capture real American dialogue in all its, like, foulmouthed grandeur... He has a deadly ear for the way people speak... Students come to me and a lot of them have been led to believe that there's good stuff and bad stuff, literary books and popular books, stuff that's redemptive and commercial shit\u2014with a sharp line drawn between the two categories. It's good to show them that there's a certain amount of blurring. Surface-wise, King's work is a bit televisual, but there's really a lot going on.\"\nInfluence.\nIn an interview, Sherman Alexie recalls the influence of \"Stephen King, who was always writing about underdogs, and bullied kids, and kids fighting back against overwhelming, often supernatural forces... The world aligned against them. As an Indian boy growing up on a reservation, I always identified with his protagonists. Stephen King, fighting the monsters.\"\nLauren Groff says that \"I love Stephen King and I owe him more than I could ever express... I love his wild imagination and his vivid scenes, many of which populate my nightmares even decades after I last read the books they're in. But the greatest thing I gleaned most from reading Stephen King is his big-hearted glee, the way he treats writing with gratitude, the way he sees his job not as the source of anguish and pain many writers self-pityingly see it as, but rather as something he's over-the-moon delighted to be lucky enough to do. If I could steal one thing from King, and keep it close to my heart forever, it is his sense of almost-holy glee when it comes to writing.\"\nThe hero of Junot D\u00edaz's \"The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao\" dreams of being \"the Dominican Stephen King\", and D\u00edaz alludes to King's work several times throughout the novel. Colson Whitehead recalls that \"The first big book I read was \"Night Shift\" by Stephen King, you know, a huge book of short stories. And so for many years I just wanted to write horror fiction.\" In a talk at Virginia Commonwealth University, Whitehead recalls that in college \"I wanted to write the black \"Shining\" or the black \"Salem's Lot\"... Take any Stephen King title and put 'the black' in front of it. That's basically what I wanted to do.\"\nViews and activism.\nKing was raised Methodist, but lost his belief in organized religion while in high school. While not conventionally religious, he says he does believe in God. \nKing has supported several Democrats in presidential races. In 1984, King endorsed Gary Hart's presidential campaign. During the 2008 presidential election, King endorsed Barack Obama. In 2016, King was one of many writers who signed a letter condemning the candidacy of Donald Trump. In the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries, King endorsed Elizabeth Warren's campaign. Warren eventually suspended her campaign, and King later endorsed Joe Biden's campaign in the 2020 general election. In July 2024, he called on Joe Biden to step down from the presidential race. King went on to endorse Kamala Harris.\nOn April 30, 2012, King published an article in \"The Daily Beast\" calling for rich Americans, including himself, to pay more taxes, citing it as \"a practical necessity and moral imperative that those who have received much should be obligated to pay ... in the same proportion\". King testified in an August 2022 case brought by the U.S. Justice Department to block a $2.2\u00a0billion merger of Penguin Random House and Simon &amp; Schuster (two of the \"Big Five\" book publishers). \"The New York Times\" credited King's high-profile testimony, which was against his own publisher, with helping to convince presiding judge Florence Y. Pan with ultimately blocking the merger.\nIn April 2008, King spoke out against HB 1423, a bill pending in the Massachusetts state legislature that would restrict or ban the sale of violent video games to anyone under the age of 18. King argued that such laws allow legislators to ignore the economic divide between the rich and poor and the easy availability of guns, which he believed were the actual causes of violence. In 2013 King published an essay titled \"Guns,\" which discusses the gun debate in the wake of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. King called for gun owners to support a ban on automatic and semi-automatic weapons. \nIn June 2018, King called for the release of the Ukrainian filmmaker Oleg Sentsov, who was jailed in Russia. In July 2022, Stephen King appeared in a video call with the Russian pranksters Vovan and Lexus who played the role of Volodymyr Zelenskyy. In the call Stephen King said \"You can always find things about people to pull them down. Washington and Jefferson were slave owners\u2014that doesn't mean they didn't do many good things to the United States of America. There are always people who have flaws, we are humans. On the whole, I think Bandera is a great man, and you're a great man, and Viva Ukraine!\" However, King later realized that he was pranked and apologized on Twitter, noting that he was not the only victim and \"other victims who fell for these guys include J. K. Rowling, Prince Harry, and Justin Trudeau\".\nTwo days after the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, King posted on X, \"He advocated stoning gays to death. Just sayin'.\" The comment sparked backlash, leading King to issue an apology in a later tweet.\nMaine politics.\nKing endorsed Shenna Bellows in the 2014 U.S. Senate election for the seat held by Republican Susan Collins. King publicly criticized Paul LePage during LePage's tenure as Governor of Maine, referring to him as one of The Three Stooges (with then-Florida Governor Rick Scott and then-Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker being the other two). He was critical of LePage for incorrectly suggesting in a 2015 radio address that King avoided paying Maine income taxes by living out of state for part of the year. The statement was later corrected by the governor's office, but no apology was issued. King said LePage was \"full of the stuff that makes the grass grow green\" and demanded that LePage \"man up and apologize\". LePage declined to apologize to King, stating, \"I never said Stephen King did not pay income taxes. What I said was, Stephen King's not in Maine right now. That's what I said.\"\nThe attention garnered by the LePage criticism led to efforts to encourage King to run for Governor of Maine in the then-upcoming 2018 gubernatorial election. King said he would not run or serve. King sent a tweet on June 30, 2015, calling LePage \"a terrible embarrassment to the state I live in and love. If he won't govern, he should resign.\" He later clarified that he was not calling on LePage to resign, but to \"go to work or go back home\". On August 27, 2016, King called LePage \"a bigot, a homophobe, and a racist\".\nPhilanthropy.\nKing subsidizes the National Poetry Foundation, which was directed by his professor and mentor Burton Hatlen, and has endowed scholarships named for another professor, Edward Holmes. Mark Singer also notes Bangor's \"most monumental testament to King's philanthropy\", the \"Shawn T. Mansfield Baseball Complex, dedicated six years ago in memory of the son of a Little League coach and friend of King's who died at fourteen of cerebral palsy.\" King has stated that he donates approximately $4\u00a0million per year \"to libraries, local fire departments that need updated lifesaving equipment (Jaws of Life tools are always a popular request), schools, and a scattering of organizations that underwrite the arts\". The Stephen and Tabitha King Foundation, chaired by King and his wife, ranks sixth among Maine charities in terms of average annual giving, with over $2.8\u00a0million in grants per year, according to The Grantsmanship Center.\nIn 2002, King, Peter Straub, John Grisham and Pat Conroy organized the Wavedancer Benefit, a public reading to raise funds for the actor and audiobook reader Frank Muller, who had been injured in a motorcycle accident. Their reading was released as an audiobook. In November 2011, the STK Foundation donated $70,000 in matched funding via his radio station to help pay the heating bills for families in need in his hometown of Bangor, Maine, during the winter. In February 2021, King's Foundation donated $6,500 to help children from the Farwell Elementary School in Lewiston, Maine, to publish two novels on which they had been working over the course of several prior years, before being stopped due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Maine.\nPersonal life.\nAfter meeting her while studying at the University of Maine, King married Tabitha Spruce on January 2, 1971. She is also a novelist and philanthropist. She has been supportive of him throughout his career, even rescuing his early manuscript of \"Carrie\" from the trash when he doubted himself. They own and divide their time between three houses: one in Bangor, Maine, one in Lovell, Maine, and for the winter a waterfront mansion located off the Gulf of Mexico in Sarasota, Florida. King's home in Bangor has been described as an unofficial tourist attraction, and as of 2019[ [update]], the couple plan to convert it into a facility housing his archives and a writers' retreat.\nThe Kings have three children\u2014two sons and a daughter, Naomi (born June 1, 1970), who is a Unitarian Universalist Church minister in Plantation, Florida, with her partner, Thandeka. Both of King's sons are also professional authors: Owen King (born February 21, 1977) published his first collection of stories, \"We're All in This Together: A Novella and Stories\", in 2005. Joseph Hillstr\u00f6m King (born June 4, 1972), who writes as Joe Hill, published his first collection of short stories, \"20th Century Ghosts\", in 2005.\nKing is a longtime fan of baseball, particularly the Boston Red Sox. In 1990, King published an essay about Owen's Little League team in \"The New Yorker\". King and Stewart O'Nan coauthored \"Faithful\", a chronicle of their correspondence about the historic 2004 Boston Red Sox season which culminated in the Sox winning the 2004 World Series. The game features in King's novellas \"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon\" (1999) and \"Blockade Billy\" (2010).\nMusic, particularly rock, plays a role in much of King's work. On the BBC program \"Desert Island Discs\", King's number one choice was Bob Dylan's \"Desolation Row\". On another BBC program, \"Paperback Writers\", he made new selections, among them AC/DC's \"Stiff Upper Lip\", Danny &amp; the Juniors's \"At the Hop\" and Creedence Clearwater Revival's \"It Came Out of the Sky\". He played guitar for the Rock Bottom Remainders, a charity supergroup whose members included Amy Tan, Barbara Kingsolver, Dave Barry, Scott Turow, James McBride, Mitch Albom, Roy Blount, Jr., Matt Groening, Greg Iles, Kathi Kamen Goldmark and other authors. They released an album, \"Stranger Than Fiction\" (1998), under Goldmark's label, Don't Quit Your Day Job Records. King and his band-mates coauthored \"Midlife Confidential: The Rock Bottom Remainders Tour America With Three Chords and an Attitude\" (1994) and the e-book \"Hard Listening: The Greatest Rock Band Ever (of Authors) Tells All\" (2013). King's favorite books about music are Greil Marcus's \"Mystery Train\" and \"\" and Chris Willman's \"Rednecks and Bluenecks\".\nKing and his wife own the Zone Corporation, a radio station group established in 1983 to acquire WACZ in Bangor, which was renamed WZON. Two additional stations, WKIT-FM and WNSW in Brewer, were added in 1995; WNSW was quickly closed down. A third station, WDME-FM in Dover-Foxcroft (later renamed WZLO), was acquired in 2001. In December 2024, King announced that the stations would shut down at the end of the year. He cited his advancing age and financial losses from the stations as reasons for the closure. Ahead of the planned closure, King reached a deal to sell WKIT to two Bangor businessmen; WZON and WZLO remain slated for closure.\nKing remains a voracious reader. In J. Peder Zane's \"The Top Ten: Authors Pick Their Favorite Books\", King chose \"The Golden Argosy\", \"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\", \"The Satanic Verses\", \"McTeague\", \"Lord of the Flies\", \"Bleak House\", \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\", \"The Raj Quartet\", \"Light in August\" and \"Blood Meridian\". In 2022, he provided another list of ten favorite books; \"Lord of the Flies\", \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\" and \"Blood Meridian\" remained, and he added \"Ship of Fools\", \"The Orphan Master's Son\", \"Invisible Man\", \"Watership Down\", \"The Hair of Harold Roux\", \"American Pastoral\" and \"The Lord of the Rings\". He added, \"Although Anthony Powell's novels should probably be on here, especially the sublimely titled \"Casanova's Chinese Restaurant\" and \"Books Do Furnish a Room\". And Paul Scott's Raj Quartet. And at least six novels by Patricia Highsmith. And what about Patrick O'Brian? See how hard this is to do?\" \nWhen asked about his reading habits, King replied, \"I'm sort of an omnivore, apt to go from the latest John Sandford to D. H. Lawrence to Cormac McCarthy.\" When asked what books we'd be surprised to find on his shelves, he answered \"Poetry, maybe? I love Anne Sexton, Richard Wilbur, W. B. Yeats. The poetry I come back to again and again are the narrative poems of Stephen Dobyns.\" When asked which novel he comes back to, he named Thomas Williams's \"The Hair of Harold Roux.\" When asked who his favorite novelist is, he said \"Probably Don Robertson, author of \"Paradise Falls\", \"The Ideal, Genuine Man\" and the marvelously titled \"Miss Margaret Ridpath and the Dismantling of the Universe.\" What I appreciate most in novels and novelists is generosity, a complete baring of the heart and mind, and Robertson always did that. He also wrote the best single line I've ever read in a novel: Of a funeral he wrote, 'There were that day, o Lord, squadrons of birds.'\"\nCar accident and aftermath.\nOn June 19, 1999, at about 4:30\u00a0pm, King was walking on the shoulder of Maine State Route 5, in Lovell, Maine. Driver Bryan Edwin Smith, distracted by an unrestrained dog moving in the back of his minivan, struck King, who landed in a depression in the ground about 14 feet (four meters) from the pavement of Route 5. Early reports at the time from Oxford County Sheriff deputy Matt Baker claimed King was hit from behind, and some witnesses said the driver was not speeding, reckless, or drinking. \nSmith was later arrested and charged with driving to endanger and aggravated assault. He pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of driving to endanger and was sentenced to six months in county jail (suspended) and had his driving license suspended for a year. In his book \"On Writing\", King states he was heading north, walking against the traffic. Shortly before the crash took place, a woman in a car, also northbound, passed King first followed by a light blue Dodge van. The van was looping from one side of the road to the other, and the woman told her passenger she hoped \"that guy in the van doesn't hit him\".\nKing was conscious enough to give the deputy phone numbers to contact his family but was in considerable pain. He was transported to Northern Cumberland Hospital in Bridgton and then flown by air ambulance to Central Maine Medical Center (CMMC) in Lewiston. His injuries\u2014a collapsed right lung, multiple fractures of his right leg, scalp laceration and a broken hip\u2014kept him at CMMC until July\u00a09. His leg bones were so shattered that doctors initially considered amputating his leg but stabilized the bones in the leg with an external fixator. After five operations in 10 days and physical therapy, King resumed work on \"On Writing\" in July, though his hip was still shattered and he could sit for only about 40 minutes before the pain became unbearable.\nKing's wife got in touch with his lawyer to purchase Smith's van, reportedly to prevent it from appearing on eBay. He recalls: \"When I was in the hospital, mostly unconscious, my wife got a lawyer who's just a friend of the family... And she got in touch with him and said, buy it so that somebody else doesn't buy it and decide to break it up and sell it on eBay, on the Internet. And so he did. And for about six months, I did have these, sort of, fantasies of smashing the van up. But my wife\u2014I don't always listen to her the first time, but sooner or later, she usually gets through. And what she says makes more sense than what I had planned. And her thought was that the best thing to do would be to very quietly remove it from this plane of existence, which is what we did.\"\nOther media appearances.\nIn \"The Princess Bride\", William Goldman writes that Stephen King is \"doing the abridgment\" of the fictional book \"Buttercup's Baby.\" King explains this is an inside joke from Goldman, \"who's an old friend. He's done the screen adaptations for a number of my novels. He did \"Misery\", \"Dreamcatcher\" and he also did \"Hearts in Atlantis\", and although he's not credited, he worked on \"Dolores Claiborne\" as well, so Bill and I go back a long way. I admired his books before I ever met him and as a kind of return tip of the cap, he put me in that book \"The Princess Bride\".\"\nIn 1988, the band Blue \u00d6yster Cult recorded an updated version of its 1974 song \"Astronomy\"; the single released for radio play featured a narrative intro spoken by King. In 2012, King provided the narration for Shooter Jennings's album \"Black Ribbons\". King was a contestant on \"Celebrity Jeopardy!\" in 1995 and 1998. He has made cameos in adaptations of his work, and appeared as the character Bachman on \"Sons of Anarchy\"; the name is a nod to his pseudonym Richard Bachman. He voiced himself in \"The Simpsons\" episode \"Insane Clown Poppy\", where he appears with fellow authors Amy Tan, John Updike and Tom Wolfe at a book fair. King tells Marge he is taking a break from horror to write a biography of Benjamin Franklin.\nAwards and honors.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\n\"Carrie\" was included on the New York Public Library's list of Books of the Century under the category \"Pop Culture Mass &amp; Entertainment\". In 2008, \"On Writing\" was ranked 21st on \"Entertainment Weekly\"'s list of \"The New Classics: The 100 Best Reads from 1983 to 2008\". It also made \"Time\"'s list of the 100 greatest nonfiction books published since the magazine's founding in 1923. Gilbert Cruz wrote, \"it's the most practical and unpretentious writer's manual around\u2014as practical and unpretentious as its author, who, yes, just happens to be one of the world's most famous novelists.\"\n\"11/22/63\" (2011) was named one of the five best fiction books of the year in \"The New York Times\": \"Throughout his career, King has explored fresh ways to blend the ordinary and the supernatural.

{"id": "26956", "revid": "35936988", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26956", "title": "Silent film", "text": "Motion pictures without synchronized recorded sound\nA silent film is a film without synchronized recorded sound (or more generally, no audible dialogue). Though silent films convey narrative and emotion visually, various plot elements (such as a setting or era) or key lines of dialogue may, when necessary, be conveyed by the use of inter-title cards.\nThe term \"silent film\" is something of a misnomer, as these films were almost always accompanied by live sounds. During the silent era, which existed from the mid-1890s to the late 1920s, a pianist, theater organist\u2014or even, in larger cities, an orchestra\u2014would play music to accompany the films. Pianists and organists would play either from sheet music, or improvisation. Sometimes a person would even narrate the inter-title cards for the audience. Though at the time the technology to synchronize sound with the film did not exist, music was seen as an essential part of the viewing experience. \"Silent film\" is typically used as a historical term to describe an era of cinema prior to the invention of synchronized sound, but it also applies to such sound-era films as \"City Lights\", \"Modern Times\" and \"Silent Movie\" which are accompanied by a music-only soundtrack in place of dialogue.\nThe term \"silent film\" is a retronym\u2014a term created to retroactively distinguish something from later developments. Early sound films, starting with \"The Jazz Singer\" in 1927, were variously referred to as the \"talkies\", \"sound films\", or \"talking pictures\". The idea of combining motion pictures with recorded sound is older than film (it was suggested almost immediately after Edison introduced the phonograph in 1877), and some early experiments had the projectionist manually adjusting the frame rate to fit the sound, but because of the technical challenges involved, the introduction of synchronized dialogue became practical only in the late 1920s with the perfection of the Audion amplifier tube and the advent of the Vitaphone system. Within a decade, the widespread production of silent films for popular entertainment had ceased, and the industry had moved fully into the sound era, in which movies were accompanied by synchronized sound recordings of spoken dialogue, music and sound effects.\nMost early motion pictures are considered lost owing to their physical decay, as the nitrate filmstock used in that era was extremely unstable and flammable. Many films were destroyed, because they had negligible remaining financial value in that era. It has often been claimed that around 75 percent of silent films produced in the US have been lost, though these estimates' accuracy cannot be determined due to a lack of numerical data.\nElements and beginnings (1833\u20131894).\nFilm projection mostly evolved from magic lantern shows, in which images from handpainted glass slides were projected onto a wall or screen. After the advent of photography in the 19th century, still photographs were sometimes used. Narration of the showman was important in spectacular entertainment screenings and vital in the lecturing circuit.\nThe principle of stroboscopic animation was well-known since the introduction of the phenakistiscope in 1833, a popular optical toy, but the development of cinematography was hampered by long exposure times for photographic emulsions, until Eadweard Muybridge managed to record a chronophotographic sequence in 1878. After others had animated his pictures in zoetropes, Muybridge started lecturing with his own zoopraxiscope animation projector in 1880.\nThe work of other pioneering chronophotographers, including \u00c9tienne-Jules Marey and Ottomar Ansch\u00fctz, furthered the development of motion picture cameras, projectors and transparent celluloid film.\nAlthough Thomas Edison was keen to develop a film system that would be synchronised with his phonograph, he eventually introduced the kinetoscope as a silent motion picture viewer in 1893 and later \"kinetophone\" versions remained unsuccessful.\nSilent era.\nThe art of motion pictures grew into full maturity in the \"silent era\" (1894 in film \u2013 1929 in film). The height of the silent era (from the early 1910s in film to the late 1920s) was a particularly fruitful period, full of artistic innovation. The film movements of Classical Hollywood as well as French Impressionism, German Expressionism, and Soviet Montage began in this period. Silent filmmakers pioneered the art form to the extent that virtually every style and genre of film-making of the 20th and 21st centuries has its artistic roots in the silent era. The silent era was also a pioneering one from a technical point of view. Three-point lighting, the close-up, long shot, panning, and continuity editing all became prevalent long before silent films were replaced by \"talking pictures\" or \"talkies\" in the late 1920s. Some scholars claim that the artistic quality of cinema decreased for several years, during the early 1930s, until film directors, actors, and production staff adapted fully to the new \"talkies\" around the mid-1930s.\nThe visual quality of silent movies\u2014especially those produced in the 1920s\u2014was often high, but there remains a widely held misconception that these films were primitive, or are barely watchable by modern standards. This misconception comes from the general public's unfamiliarity with the medium, as well as from carelessness on the part of the industry. Most silent films are poorly preserved, leading to their deterioration, and well-preserved films are often played back at the wrong speed or suffer from censorship cuts and missing frames and scenes, giving the appearance of poor editing. Many silent films exist only in second- or third-generation copies, often made from already damaged and neglected film stock.\nMany early screenings were plagued by flicker on the screen, when the stroboscopic interruptions between frames lay below the critical flicker frequency. This was solved with the introduction of a three-bladed shutter (since 1902), causing two more interruptions per frame.\nAnother widely held misconception is that silent films lacked color. In fact, color was far more prevalent in silent films than in the first few decades of sound films. By the early 1920s, 80 percent of movies could be seen in some sort of color, usually in the form of film tinting or toning or even hand coloring, but also with fairly natural two-color processes such as Kinemacolor and Technicolor. Traditional colorization processes ceased with the adoption of sound-on-film technology. Traditional film colorization, all of which involved the use of dyes in some form, interfered with the high resolution required for built-in recorded sound, and were therefore abandoned. The innovative three-strip technicolor process introduced in the mid-1930s was costly and fraught with limitations, and color would not have the same prevalence in film as it did in the silents for nearly four decades.\nInter-titles.\nAs motion pictures gradually increased in running time, a replacement was needed for the in-house interpreter who would explain parts of the film to the audience. Because silent films had no synchronized sound for dialogue, onscreen inter-titles were used to narrate story points, present key dialogue and sometimes even comment on the action for the audience. The \"title writer\" became a key professional in silent film and was often separate from the \"scenario writer\" who created the story. Inter-titles (or \"titles\" as they were generally called at the time) \"often were graphic elements themselves, featuring illustrations or abstract decorations that commented on the action\".\nLive music and other sound accompaniment.\nShowings of silent films almost always featured live music starting with the first public projection of movies by the Lumi\u00e8re brothers on December 28, 1895, in Paris. This was furthered in 1896 by the first motion-picture exhibition in the United States at Koster and Bial's Music Hall in New York City. At this event, Edison set the precedent that all exhibitions should be accompanied by an orchestra. From the beginning, music was recognized as essential, contributing atmosphere, and giving the audience vital emotional cues. Musicians sometimes played on film sets during shooting for similar reasons. However, depending on the size of the exhibition site, musical accompaniment could drastically change in scale. Small-town and neighborhood movie theatres usually had a pianist. Beginning in the mid-1910s, large city theaters tended to have organists or ensembles of musicians. Massive theatre organs, which were designed to fill a gap between a simple piano soloist and a larger orchestra, had a wide range of special effects. Theatrical organs such as the famous \"Mighty Wurlitzer\" could simulate some orchestral sounds along with a number of percussion effects such as bass drums and cymbals, and sound effects ranging from \"train and boat whistles [to] car horns and bird whistles;\u00a0... some could even simulate pistol shots, ringing phones, the sound of surf, horses' hooves, smashing pottery, [and] thunder and rain\".\nMusical scores for early silent films were either improvised or compiled of classical or theatrical repertory music. Once full features became commonplace, however, music was compiled from photoplay music by the pianist, organist, orchestra conductor or the movie studio itself, which included a cue sheet with the film. These sheets were often lengthy, with detailed notes about effects and moods to watch for. Starting with the mostly original score composed by Joseph Carl Breil for D.\u00a0W. Griffith's epic \"The Birth of a Nation\" (1915), it became relatively common for the biggest-budgeted films to arrive at the exhibiting theater with original, specially composed scores. However, the first designated full-blown scores had in fact been composed in 1908, by Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns for \"The Assassination of the Duke of Guise\", and by Mikhail Ippolitov-Ivanov for \"Stenka Razin\".\nWhen organists or pianists used sheet music, they still might add improvisational flourishes to heighten the drama on screen. Even when special effects were not indicated in the score, if an organist was playing a theater organ capable of an unusual sound effect such as \"galloping horses\", it would be used during scenes of dramatic horseback chases.\nAt the height of the silent era, movies were the single largest source of employment for instrumental musicians, at least in the United States. However, the introduction of talkies, coupled with the roughly simultaneous onset of the Great Depression, was devastating to many musicians.\nA number of countries devised other ways of bringing sound to silent films. The early cinema of Brazil, for example, featured \"fitas cantatas\" (singing films), filmed operettas with singers performing behind the screen. In Japan, films had not only live music but also the \"benshi\", a live narrator who provided commentary and character voices. The \"benshi\" became a central element in Japanese film, as well as providing translation for foreign (mostly American) movies. The popularity of the \"benshi\" was one reason why silent films persisted well into the 1930s in Japan. Conversely, as \"benshi\"-narrated films often lacked intertitles, modern-day audiences may sometimes find it difficult to follow the plots without specialised subtitling or additional commentary.\nScore restorations from 1980 to the present.\nFew film scores survived intact from the silent period, and musicologists are still confronted by questions when they attempt to precisely reconstruct those that remain. Scores used in current reissues or screenings of silent films may be complete reconstructions of compositions, newly composed for the occasion, assembled from already existing music libraries, or improvised on the spot in the manner of the silent-era theater musician.\nInterest in the scoring of silent films fell somewhat out of fashion during the 1960s and 1970s. There was a belief in many college film programs and repertory cinemas that audiences should experience silent film as a pure visual medium, undistracted by music. This belief may have been encouraged by the poor quality of the music tracks found on many silent film reprints of the time. Since around 1980, there has been a revival of interest in presenting silent films with quality musical scores (either reworkings of period scores or cue sheets, or the composition of appropriate original scores). An early effort of this kind was Kevin Brownlow's 1980 restoration of Abel Gance's \"Napol\u00e9on\" (1927), featuring a score by Carl Davis. A slightly re-edited and sped-up version of Brownlow's restoration was later distributed in the United States by Francis Ford Coppola, with a live orchestral score composed by his father Carmine Coppola.\nIn 1984, an edited restoration of \"Metropolis\" (1927) was released with a new rock music score by producer-composer Giorgio Moroder. Although the contemporary score, which included pop songs by Freddie Mercury, Pat Benatar, and Jon Anderson of Yes, was controversial, the door had been opened for a new approach to the presentation of classic silent films.\nToday, a large number of soloists, music ensembles, and orchestras perform traditional and contemporary scores for silent films internationally. The legendary theater organist Gaylord Carter continued to perform and record his original silent film scores until shortly before his death in 2000; some of those scores are available on DVD reissues. Other purveyors of the traditional approach include organists such as Dennis James and pianists such as Neil Brand, G\u00fcnter Buchwald, Philip C. Carli, Ben Model, and William P. Perry. Other contemporary pianists, such as Stephen Horne and Gabriel Thibaudeau, have often taken a more modern approach to scoring. Ben Model in particular advocates in\u2011era scoring\u2014\u201ckeep the sound inside that world so the picture plays the way it should\u201d\u2014rather than contemporary sound palettes.\nOrchestral conductors such as Carl Davis and Robert Israel have written and compiled scores for numerous silent films; many of these have been featured in showings on Turner Classic Movies or have been released on DVD. Davis has composed new scores for classic silent dramas such as \"The Big Parade\" (1925) and \"Flesh and the Devil\" (1927). Israel has worked mainly in silent comedy, scoring the films of Harold Lloyd, Buster Keaton, Charley Chase, and others. Timothy Brock has restored many of Charlie Chaplin's scores, in addition to composing new scores.\nContemporary music ensembles are helping to introduce classic silent films to a wider audience through a broad range of musical styles and approaches. Some performers create new compositions using traditional musical instruments, while others add electronic sounds, modern harmonies, rhythms, improvisation, and sound design elements to enhance the viewing experience. Among the contemporary ensembles in this category are Un Drame Musical Instantan\u00e9, Alloy Orchestra, Club Foot Orchestra, Silent Orchestra, Mont Alto Motion Picture Orchestra, Minima and the Caspervek Trio, RPM Orchestra. Donald Sosin and his wife Joanna Seaton specialize in adding vocals to silent films, particularly where there is onscreen singing that benefits from hearing the actual song being performed. Films in this category include Griffith's \"Lady of the Pavements\" with Lupe V\u00e9lez, Edwin Carewe's \"Evangeline\" with Dolores del R\u00edo, and Rupert Julian's \"The Phantom of the Opera\" with Mary Philbin and Virginia Pearson.\nThe Silent Film Sound and Music Archive digitizes music and cue sheets written for silent films and makes them available for use by performers, scholars, and enthusiasts.\nActing techniques.\nSilent-film actors emphasized body language and facial expression so that the audience could better understand what an actor was feeling and portraying on screen. Much silent film acting is apt to strike modern-day audiences as simplistic or campy. The melodramatic acting style was in some cases a habit actors transferred from their former stage experience. Vaudeville was an especially popular origin for many American silent film actors. The pervading presence of stage actors in film was the cause of this outburst from director Marshall Neilan in 1917: \"The sooner the stage people who have come into pictures get out, the better for the pictures.\" In other cases, directors such as John Griffith Wray required their actors to deliver larger-than-life expressions for emphasis. As early as 1914, American viewers had begun to make known their preference for greater naturalness on screen.\nSilent films became less vaudevillian in the mid-1910s, as the differences between stage and screen became apparent. Due to the work of directors such as D. W. Griffith, cinematography became less stage-like, and the development of the close up allowed for understated and realistic acting. Lillian Gish has been called film's \"first true actress\" for her work in the period, as she pioneered new film performing techniques, recognizing the crucial differences between stage and screen acting. Directors such as Albert Capellani and Maurice Tourneur began to insist on naturalism in their films. By the mid-1920s many American silent films had adopted a more naturalistic acting style, though not all actors and directors accepted naturalistic, low-key acting straight away; as late as 1927, films featuring expressionistic acting styles, such as \"Metropolis\", were still being released. Greta Garbo, whose first American film was released in 1926, would become known for her naturalistic acting.\nAccording to Anton Kaes, a silent film scholar from the University of California, Berkeley, American silent cinema began to see a shift in acting techniques between 1913 and 1921, influenced by techniques found in German silent film. This is mainly attributed to the influx of emigrants from the Weimar Republic, \"including film directors, producers, cameramen, lighting and stage technicians, as well as actors and actresses\".\nProjection speed.\nUntil the standardization of the projection speed of 24 frames per second (fps) for sound films between 1926 and 1930, silent films were shot at variable speeds (or \"frame rates\") anywhere from 12 to 40\u00a0fps, depending on the year and studio. \"Standard silent film speed\" is often said to be 16\u00a0fps as a result of the Lumi\u00e8re brothers' , but industry practice varied considerably; there was no actual standard. William Kennedy Laury Dickson, an Edison employee, settled on the astonishingly fast 40 frames per second. Additionally, cameramen of the era insisted that their cranking technique was exactly 16\u00a0fps, but modern examination of the films shows this to be in error, and that they often cranked faster. Unless carefully shown at their intended speeds silent films can appear unnaturally fast or slow. However, some scenes were intentionally undercranked during shooting to accelerate the action\u2014particularly for comedies and action films.\nSlow projection of a cellulose nitrate base film carried a risk of fire, as each frame was exposed for a longer time to the intense heat of the projection lamp; but there were other reasons to project a film at a greater pace. Often projectionists received general instructions from the distributors on the musical director's cue sheet as to how fast particular reels or scenes should be projected. In rare instances, usually for larger productions, cue sheets produced specifically for the projectionist provided a detailed guide to presenting the film. Theaters also\u2014to maximize profit\u2014sometimes varied projection speeds depending on the time of day or popularity of a film, or to fit a film into a prescribed time slot.\nAll motion-picture film projectors require a moving shutter to block the light whilst the film is moving, otherwise the image is smeared in the direction of the movement. However this shutter causes the image to \"flicker\", and images with low rates of flicker are very unpleasant to watch. Early studies by Thomas Edison for his Kinetoscope machine determined that any rate below 46\u00a0images per second \"will strain the eye\". and this holds true for projected images under normal cinema conditions also. The solution adopted for the Kinetoscope was to run the film at over 40 frames/sec, but this was expensive for film. However, by using projectors with dual- and triple-blade shutters the flicker rate is multiplied two or three times higher than the number of film frames \u2014 each frame being flashed two or three times on screen. A three-blade shutter projecting a 16\u00a0fps film will slightly surpass Edison's figure, giving the audience 48 images per second. During the silent era projectors were commonly fitted with 3-bladed shutters. Since the introduction of sound with its 24 frame/sec standard speed 2-bladed shutters have become the norm for 35\u00a0mm cinema projectors, though three-bladed shutters have remained standard on 16\u00a0mm and 8\u00a0mm projectors, which are frequently used to project amateur footage shot at 16 or 18 frames/sec. A 35\u00a0mm film frame rate of 24\u00a0fps translates to a film speed of per second. One reel requires 11 minutes and 7 seconds to be projected at 24\u00a0fps, while a 16\u00a0fps projection of the same reel would take 16 minutes and 40 seconds, or per second.\nIn the 1950s, many telecine conversions of silent films at grossly incorrect frame rates for broadcast television may have alienated viewers. Film speed is often a vexed issue among scholars and film buffs in the presentation of silents today, especially when it comes to DVD releases of restored films, such as the case of the 2002 restoration of \"Metropolis\".\nTinting.\nWith the lack of natural color processing available, films of the silent era were frequently dipped in dyestuffs and dyed various shades and hues to signal a mood or represent a time of day. Hand tinting dates back to 1895 in the United States with Edison's release of selected hand-tinted prints of \"Butterfly Dance\". Additionally, experiments in color film started as early as in 1909, although it took a much longer time for color to be adopted by the industry and an effective process to be developed. Blue represented night scenes, yellow or amber meant day. Red represented fire and green represented a mysterious atmosphere. Similarly, toning of film (such as the common silent film generalization of sepia-toning) with special solutions replaced the silver particles in the film stock with salts or dyes of various colors. A combination of tinting and toning could be used as an effect that could be striking.\nSome films were hand-tinted, such as \"Annabelle Serpentine Dance\" (1894), from Edison Studios. In it, Annabelle Whitford, a young dancer from Broadway, is dressed in white veils that appear to change colors as she dances. This technique was designed to capture the effect of the live performances of Loie Fuller, beginning in 1891, in which stage lights with colored gels turned her white flowing dresses and sleeves into artistic movement. Hand coloring was often used in the early \"trick\" and fantasy films of Europe, especially those by Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s. M\u00e9li\u00e8s began hand-tinting his work as early as 1897 and the 1899 \"Cendrillion\" (Cinderella) and 1900 \"Jeanne d'Arc\" (Joan of Arc) provide early examples of hand-tinted films in which the color was a critical part of the scenography or \"mise-en-sc\u00e8ne\"; such precise tinting used the workshop of Elisabeth Thuillier in Paris, with teams of female artists adding layers of color to each frame by hand rather than using a more common (and less expensive) process of stenciling. A newly restored version of M\u00e9li\u00e8s's \"A Trip to the Moon\", originally released in 1902, shows an exuberant use of color designed to add texture and interest to the image.\nComments by an American distributor in a 1908 film-supply catalog further underscore France's continuing dominance in the field of hand-coloring films during the early silent era. The distributor offers for sale at varying prices \"High-Class\" motion pictures by Path\u00e9, Urban-Eclipse, Gaumont, Kalem, Itala Film, Ambrosio Film, and Selig. Several of the longer, more prestigious films in the catalog are offered in both standard black-and-white \"plain stock\" as well as in \"hand-painted\" color. A plain-stock copy, for example, of the 1907 release \"Ben Hur\" is offered for $120 ($ USD today), while a colored version of the same 1,000-foot, 15-minute film costs $270 ($) including the extra $150 coloring charge, which amounted to 15 cents more per foot. Although the reasons for the cited extra charge were likely obvious to customers, the distributor explains why his catalog's colored films command such significantly higher prices and require more time for delivery. His explanation also provides insight into the general state of film-coloring services in the United States by 1908:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBy the beginning of the 1910s, with the onset of feature-length films, tinting was used as another mood setter, just as commonplace as music. The director D.\u00a0W. Griffith displayed a constant interest and concern about color, and used tinting as a special effect in many of his films. His 1915 epic \"The Birth of a Nation\" used a number of colors, including amber, blue, lavender, and a striking red tint for scenes such as the \"burning of Atlanta\" and the ride of the Ku Klux Klan at the climax of the picture. Griffith later invented a color system in which colored lights flashed on areas of the screen to achieve a color.\nWith the development of sound-on-film technology and the industry's acceptance of it, tinting was abandoned altogether, because the dyes used in the tinting process interfered with the soundtracks present on film strips.\nEarly studios.\nThe early studios were located in the New York City area. Edison Studios were first in West Orange, New Jersey (1892), they were moved to the Bronx, New York (1907). Fox (1909) and Biograph (1906) started in Manhattan, with studios in St George, Staten Island. Other films were shot in Fort Lee, New Jersey. In December 1908, Edison led the formation of the Motion Picture Patents Company in an attempt to control the industry and shut out smaller producers. The \"Edison Trust\", as it was nicknamed, was made up of Edison, Biograph, Essanay Studios, Kalem Company, George Kleine Productions, Lubin Studios, Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s, Path\u00e9, Selig Studios, and Vitagraph Studios, and dominated distribution through the General Film Company. This company dominated the industry as both a vertical and horizontal monopoly and is a contributing factor in studios' migration to the West Coast. The Motion Picture Patents Co. and the General Film Co. were found guilty of antitrust violation in October 1915, and were dissolved.\nThe Thanhouser film studio was founded in New Rochelle, New York, in 1909 by American theatrical impresario Edwin Thanhouser. The company produced and released 1,086 films between 1910 and 1917, including the first film serial, \"The Million Dollar Mystery\", released in 1914. The first westerns were filmed at Fred Scott's Movie Ranch in South Beach, Staten Island. Actors costumed as cowboys and Native Americans galloped across Scott's movie ranch set, which had a frontier main street, a wide selection of stagecoaches and a 56-foot stockade. The island provided a serviceable stand-in for locations as varied as the Sahara desert and a British cricket pitch. War scenes were shot on the plains of Grasmere, Staten Island. \"The Perils of Pauline\" and its even more popular sequel \"The Exploits of Elaine\" were filmed largely on the island. So was the 1906 blockbuster \"Life of a Cowboy\", by Edwin S. Porter Company, and filming moved to the West Coast c.\u20091912.\nTop-grossing films in the United States.\nThe following are American films from the silent film era that had earned the highest gross income as of 1932. The amounts given are gross rentals (the distributor's share of the box-office) as opposed to exhibition gross.\nDuring the sound era.\nTransition.\nAlthough attempts to create sync-sound motion pictures go back to the Edison lab in 1896, only from the early 1920s were the basic technologies such as vacuum tube amplifiers and high-quality loudspeakers available. The next few years saw a race to design, implement, and market several rival sound-on-disc and sound-on-film sound formats, such as Photokinema (1921), Phonofilm (1923), Vitaphone (1926), Fox Movietone (1927) and RCA Photophone (1928).\nWarner Bros. was the first studio to accept sound as an element in film production and utilize the Vitaphone, a sound-on-disc technology, to do so. The studio then released \"The Jazz Singer\" in 1927, which marked the first commercially successful sound film, but silent films were still the majority of features released in both 1927 and 1928, along with so-called goat-glanded films: silents with a subsection of sound film inserted. Thus the modern sound film era may be regarded as coming to dominance beginning in 1929.\nFor a listing of notable silent-era films, see \"List of years in film\" for the years between the beginning of film and 1928. The following list includes only films produced in the sound era with the specific artistic intention of being silent.\nLater homages.\nSeveral filmmakers have paid homage to the comedies of the silent era, including Charlie Chaplin, with \"Modern Times\" (1936), Orson Welles with \"Too Much Johnson\" (1938), Jacques Tati with \"Les Vacances de Monsieur Hulot\" (1953), Pierre Etaix with \"The Suitor\" (1962), and Mel Brooks with \"Silent Movie\" (1976). Taiwanese director Hou Hsiao-hsien's acclaimed drama \"Three Times\" (2005) is silent during its middle third, complete with intertitles; Stanley Tucci's \"The Impostors\" has an opening silent sequence in the style of early silent comedies. Brazilian filmmaker Renato Falc\u00e3o's \"Margarette's Feast\" (2003) is silent. Writer/director Michael Pleckaitis puts his own twist on the genre with \"Silent\" (2007). While not silent, the \"Mr. Bean\" television series and movies have used the title character's non-talkative nature to create a similar style of humor. A lesser-known example is J\u00e9r\u00f4me Savary's \"La fille du garde-barri\u00e8re\" (1975), an homage to silent-era films that uses intertitles and blends comedy, drama, and explicit sex scenes (which led to it being refused a cinema certificate by the British Board of Film Classification).\nIn 1990, Charles Lane directed and starred in \"Sidewalk Stories\", a low budget salute to sentimental silent comedies, particularly Charlie Chaplin's \"The Kid\".\nThe German film \"Tuvalu\" (1999) is mostly silent; the small amount of dialog is an odd mix of European languages, increasing the film's universality. Guy Maddin won awards for his homage to Soviet-era silent films with his short \"The Heart of the World\" after which he made a feature-length silent, \"Brand Upon the Brain!\" (2006), incorporating live Foley artists, narration and orchestra at select showings. \"Shadow of the Vampire\" (2000) is a highly fictionalized depiction of the filming of Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau's classic silent vampire movie \"Nosferatu\" (1922). Werner Herzog honored the same film in his own version, \"\" (1979).\nSome films draw a direct contrast between the silent film era and the era of talkies. \"Sunset Boulevard\" shows the disconnect between the two eras in the character of Norma Desmond, played by silent film star Gloria Swanson, and \"Singin' in the Rain\" deals with Hollywood artists adjusting to the talkies. Peter Bogdanovich's 1976 film \"Nickelodeon\" deals with the turmoil of silent filmmaking in Hollywood during the early 1910s, leading up to the release of D.\u00a0W. Griffith's epic \"The Birth of a Nation\" (1915).\nIn 1999, the Finnish filmmaker Aki Kaurism\u00e4ki produced \"Juha\" in black and white, which captures the style of a silent film, using intertitles in place of spoken dialogue. Special release prints with titles in several different languages were produced for international distribution. In India, the film \"Pushpak\" (1988), starring Kamal Haasan, was a black comedy entirely devoid of dialog. The Australian film \"Doctor Plonk\" (2007), was a silent comedy directed by Rolf de Heer. Stage plays have drawn upon silent film styles and sources. Actor/writers Billy Van Zandt and Jane Milmore staged their Off-Broadway slapstick comedy \"Silent Laughter\" as a live action tribute to the silent screen era. Geoff Sobelle and Trey Lyford created and starred in \"All Wear Bowlers\" (2004), which started as an homage to Laurel and Hardy then evolved to incorporate life-sized silent film sequences of Sobelle and Lyford who jump back and forth between live action and the silver screen. The animated film \"Fantasia\" (1940), which is eight different animation sequences set to music, can be considered a silent film, with only one short scene involving dialogue. The espionage film \"The Thief\" (1952) has music and sound effects, but no dialogue, as do Thierry Z\u00e9no's 1974 \"Vase de Noces\" and Patrick Bokanowski's 1982 \"The Angel\".\nIn 2005, the H.\u00a0P. Lovecraft Historical Society produced a silent film version of Lovecraft's story \"The Call of Cthulhu\". This film maintained a period-accurate filming style, and was received as both \"the best HPL adaptation to date\" and, referring to the decision to make it as a silent movie, \"a brilliant conceit\".\nThe French film \"The Artist\" (2011), written and directed by Michel Hazanavicius, plays as a silent film and is set in Hollywood during the silent era. It also includes segments of fictitious silent films starring its protagonists. It won the Academy Award for Best Picture.\nThe Japanese vampire film \"Sanguivorous\" (2011) is not only done in the style of a silent film, but even toured with live orchestral accompaniment. Eugene Chadbourne has been among those who have played live music for the film.\n\"Blancanieves\" is a 2012 Spanish black-and-white silent fantasy drama film written and directed by Pablo Berger.\nThe American feature-length silent film \"Silent Life\", which started in 2006 and features performances by Isabella Rossellini and Galina Jovovich, mother of Milla Jovovich, premiered in 2013. The film is based on the life of silent screen icon Rudolph Valentino, known as Hollywood's first \"Great Lover\". After emergency surgery, Valentino loses his grip on reality and begins to see the recollection of his life in Hollywood from a perspective of a coma \u2013 as a silent film shown at a movie palace, the magical portal between life and eternity, between reality and illusion.\n\"The Picnic\" is a 2012 short film made in the style of two-reel silent melodramas and comedies. It was part of the exhibit, \"No Spectators: The Art of Burning Man,\" a 2018\u20132019 exhibit curated by the Renwick Gallery of the Smithsonian American Art Museum. The film was shown inside a miniature 12-seat Art Deco movie palace on wheels called \"The Capitol Theater\", created by Oakland, Ca. art collective Five Ton Crane.\n\"Right There\" is a 2013 short film that is an homage to silent film comedies.\nThe American Theatre Organ Society pays homage to the music of silent films, as well as the theatre organs that played such music. With over 75 local chapters, the organization seeks to preserve and promote theater organs and music as an art form.\nThe Globe International Silent Film Festival (GISFF) is an annual event focusing on image and atmosphere in cinema which takes place in a reputable university or academic environment every year and is a platform for showcasing and judging films from filmmakers who are active in this field. In 2018, film director Christopher Annino shot the now internationally award-winning feature silent film \"Silent Times\". The film pays homage to many of the characters from the 1920s, including Officer Keystone, played by David Blair; Enzio Marchello who portrays a Charlie Chaplin character. \"Silent Times\" won best silent film at the Oniros Film Festival. Set in a small New England town, the story centers on Oliver Henry III (played by Westerly native Geoff Blanchette), a small-time crook turned vaudeville theater owner. From humble beginnings in England, he immigrates to the US in search of happiness and fast cash. He becomes acquainted with people from all walks of life, from burlesque performers, mimes, hobos to classy flapper girls, as his fortunes rise and his life spins ever more out of control.\nIn 2021, director Malte Wirtz brought his silent film Gender Crisis to German cinemas, which is now available online worldwide. The film tells the ancient story of Samson and Delilah in a modern way.\nAlthough animated films \"The Apostle\" (1917) and \"The Adventures of Prince Achmed\" (1926) are considered silent, they have used the synchronized sound and music without use of dialogues (only for gibberish and emotion sounds) for their respective films, in similar veins of Academy Award-nominated animated films like \"Shaun the Sheep Movie\" (2015), \"The Red Turtle\" (2016), and Berger's \"Robot Dreams\" (2023) as well as Academy Award-winning animated film \"Flow\" (2024).\nPreservation and lost films.\nThe vast majority of the silent films produced in the late 19th and early 20th centuries are considered lost. According to a September 2013 report published by the United States Library of Congress, some 70 percent of American silent feature films fall into this category. There are numerous reasons for this number being so high. Some films have been lost unintentionally, but most silent films were destroyed on purpose. Between the end of the silent era and the rise of home video, film studios would often discard large numbers of silent films out of a desire to free up storage in their archives, assuming that they had lost the cultural relevance and economic value to justify the amount of space they occupied. Additionally, due to the fragile nature of the nitrate film stock which was used to shoot and distribute silent films, many motion pictures have irretrievably deteriorated or have been lost in accidents, including fires (because nitrate is highly flammable and can spontaneously combust when stored improperly). Examples of such incidents include the 1965 MGM vault fire and the 1937 Fox vault fire, both of which caused catastrophic losses of films. Many such films not completely destroyed survive only partially, or in badly damaged prints. Some lost films, such as \"London After Midnight\" (1927), lost in the MGM fire, have been the subject of considerable interest by film collectors and historians.\nMajor silent films presumed lost include:\nThough most lost silent films will never be recovered, some have been discovered in film archives or private collections. Discovered and preserved versions may be editions made for the home rental market of the 1920s and 1930s that are discovered in estate sales, etc. The degradation of old film stock can be slowed through proper archiving, and films can be transferred to safety film stock or to digital media for preservation. The preservation of silent films has been a high priority for historians and archivists.\nDawson Film Find.\nDawson City, in the Yukon territory of Canada, was once the end of the distribution line for many films. In 1978, a cache of more than 500 reels of nitrate film was discovered during the excavation of a vacant lot formerly the site of the Dawson Amateur Athletic Association, which had started showing films at its recreation center in 1903. Works by Pearl White, Helen Holmes, Grace Cunard, Lois Weber, Harold Lloyd, Douglas Fairbanks, and Lon Chaney, among others, were included, as well as many newsreels. The titles were stored at the local library until 1929 when the flammable nitrate was used as landfill in a condemned swimming pool. Having spent 50 years under the permafrost of the Yukon, the reels turned out to be extremely well preserved. Owing to its dangerous chemical volatility, the historical find was moved by military transport to Library and Archives Canada and the US Library of Congress for storage (and transfer to safety film). A documentary about the find, \"\", was released in 2016.\nFilm festivals.\nThere are annual silent film festivals around the globe, including: \nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Sister-inline/styles.css\"/&gt; Media related to at Wikimedia Commons"}

It holds that Muhammad designated Ali ibn Abi Talib (r.\u2009656\u00a0\u2013\u00a0661) as both his political successor (caliph) and as the spiritual leader of the Muslim community (imam). However, his right is understood to have been usurped by a number of Muhammad's companions at the meeting of Saqifa, during which they appointed Abu Bakr (r.\u2009632\u00a0\u2013\u00a0634) as caliph instead. As such, Sunni Muslims believe Abu Bakr, Umar (r.\u2009634\u00a0\u2013\u00a0644), Uthman (r.\u2009644\u00a0\u2013\u00a0656) and Ali to be 'rightly-guided caliphs', whereas Shia Muslims regard only Ali as the legitimate successor.\nShia Muslims believe that the imamate continued through Ali's sons, Hasan and Husayn, after which various Shia branches developed and recognized different imams. They revere the , the family of Muhammad, maintaining that they possess divine knowledge. Shia holy sites include the shrine of Ali in Najaf, the shrine of Husayn in Karbala, and other mausoleums of the . Later events, such as Husayn's martyrdom in the Battle of Karbala (680 CE), further influenced the development of Shia Islam, contributing to the formation of a distinct religious sect with its own rituals and shared collective memory.\nShia Islam is followed by 10\u201313% of all Muslims, numbering at an estimated 200\u2013250 million followers worldwide as of 2025. The three main Shia branches are Twelverism, Isma'ilism, and Zaydism. Shia Muslims form a majority of the population in Iran, Iraq, and Azerbaijan, as well as about half of the citizen population of Bahrain. Significant Shia communities are also found in Lebanon, Kuwait, Turkey, Yemen, Saudi Arabia and South Asia. Iran stands as the world's only country where Shia Islam forms the foundation of both its laws and governance system.\nTerminology.\nThe word Shia (or ) () () is derived from . In Arabic, \u201cSh\u012b\u02bfa\u201d means followers and supporters; the term derives from *al-shiy\u0101\u02bf* and *al-mush\u0101ya\u02bfa*, which convey the meanings of following, supporting, and obedience. Shia Islam is also referred to in English as Shiism (or Sh\u012b\u02bfism) (), and Shia Muslims as Shiites (or Sh\u012b\u02bfites) ().\nThe term was first used during Muhammad's lifetime. At present, the word refers to the Muslims who believe that the leadership of the Muslim community after Muhammad belongs to \u02bfAl\u012b ibn Ab\u012b \u1e6c\u0101lib, Muhammad's cousin and son-in-law, and his successors.\nNawbakhti states that the term \"Shia\" refers to a group of Muslims who at the time of Muhammad and after him regarded \u02bfAl\u012b as the Imam and caliph. Al-Shahrastani expresses that the term \"Shia\" refers to those who believe that \u02bfAl\u012b is designated as the heir, Imam, and caliph by Muhammad and that \u02bfAl\u012b's authority is maintained through his descendants. For the adherents of Shia Islam, this conviction is implicit in the Quran and the history of Islam. Shia Muslim scholars emphasize that the notion of authority is linked to the family of the Abrahamic prophets as the Quranic verses https:// and https:// illustrate: \"Indeed, Allah chose Adam, Noah, the family of Abraham, and the family of \u2019Imr\u00e2n above all people. They are descendants of one another. And Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing.\"\nHistory.\nThe original Shia identity referred to the followers of Imam \u02bfAl\u012b, and Shia theology was formulated after the \"hijra\" (8th century CE). The first Shia governments and societies were established by the end of the 9th century CE. The 10th century CE has been referred to by the scholar of Islamic studies Louis Massignon as \"the Shiite Ismaili century in the history of Islam\".\nOrigins.\nThe Shia, originally known as the \"partisans\" of \u02bfAl\u012b ibn Ab\u012b \u1e6c\u0101lib, Muhammad's cousin and Fatima's husband, first emerged as a distinct movement during the First Fitna from 656 to 661 CE. Shia doctrine holds that \u02bfAl\u012b was meant to lead the community after Muhammad's death in 632. Historians dispute over the origins of Shia Islam, with many Western scholars positing that Shia Islam began as a political faction rather than a truly religious movement. Other scholars disagree, considering this concept of religious-political separation to be an anachronistic application of a Western concept.\nShia Muslims believe that Muhammad designated \u02bfAl\u012b ibn Ab\u012b \u1e6c\u0101lib as his heir during a speech at Ghadir Khumm. The point of contention between different Muslim sects arises when Muhammad, whilst giving his speech, gave the proclamation \"Anyone who has me as his , has \u02bfAl\u012b as his \". Some versions add the additional sentence \"O God, befriend the friend of \u02bfAl\u012b and be the enemy of his enemy\". Sunnis maintain that Muhammad emphasized the deserving friendship and respect for \u02bfAl\u012b. In contrast, Shia Muslims assert that the statement unequivocally designates \u02bfAl\u012b as Muhammad's appointed successor. Shia sources also record further details of the event, such as stating that those present congratulated \u02bfAl\u012b and acclaimed him as (\"commander of the believers\").\nWhen Muhammad died in 632 CE, \u02bfAl\u012b ibn Ab\u012b \u1e6c\u0101lib and Muhammad's closest relatives made the funeral arrangements. While they were preparing his body, Ab\u016b Bakr, \u02bfUmar ibn al-Kha\u1e6d\u1e6d\u0101b, and Abu Ubaidah ibn al Jarrah met with the leaders of Medina and elected Ab\u016b Bakr as the first \"r\u0101shid\u016bn\" caliph. Ab\u016b Bakr served from 632 to 634, and was followed by Umar (634\u2013644) and \u02bfUthm\u0101n (644\u2013656).\nWith the murder of \u02bfUthm\u0101n in 657 CE, the Muslims of Medina invited \u02bfAl\u012b to become the fourth caliph as the last source, and he established his capital in Kufa. \u02bfAl\u012b's rule over the early Islamic empire, between 656 CE to 661 CE, was often contested. Tensions eventually led to the First Fitna, the first major civil war between Muslims within the empire, which began as a series of revolts fought against \u02bfAl\u012b. While the rebels had previously affirmed the legitimacy of \u02bfAl\u012b's \"khilaf\u0101\u02be\" (caliphate), they later turned against \u02bfAl\u012b and fought him. \nTensions escalated into the Battle of the Camel in 656, where Ali's forces emerged victorious against Aisha, Talhah, and al-Zubayr. The Battle of Siffin in 657 turned the tide against \u02bfAl\u012b, who lost due to arbitration issues with Muawiyah, the governor of Damascus. \u02bfAl\u012b withdrew to Kufa, overcoming the Kharijis, a faction that had transformed from supporters to bitter rivals, at Nahrawan in 658. In 661, \u02bfAl\u012b was assassinated by a Khariji assassin in Kufa while in the act of prostration during prayer (). Subsequently, Muawiyah asserted his claim to the caliphate.\nHasan, Husayn, and Karbala.\nUpon the death of \u02bfAl\u012b, his elder son \u1e24asan became leader of the Muslims of Kufa. After a series of skirmishes between the Kufa Muslims and the army of Muawiyah, \u1e24asan ibn Ali agreed to cede the caliphate to Muawiyah and maintain peace among Muslims upon certain conditions: The enforced public cursing of \u02bfAl\u012b, e.g. during prayers, should be abandoned; Muawiyah should not use tax money for his own private needs; There should be peace, and followers of \u1e24asan should be given security and their rights; Muawiyah will never adopt the title of \"Amir al-Mu'minin\" (\"commander of the believers\"); Muawiyah will not nominate any successor. \u1e24asan then retired to Medina, where in 670 CE he was poisoned by his wife Ja'da bint al-Ash'ath, after being secretly contacted by Muawiyah who wished to pass the caliphate to his own son Yazid and saw \u1e24asan as an obstacle.\n\u1e24usayn ibn \u02bfAl\u012b, \u02bfAl\u012b's younger son and brother to \u1e24asan, initially resisted calls to lead the Muslims against Muawiyah and reclaim the caliphate. In 680 CE, Muawiyah died and passed the caliphate to his son Yazid, thus breaking the treaty with \u1e24asan ibn \u02bfAl\u012b. Yazid asked Husayn to swear allegiance (\"bay'ah\") to him. \u02bfAl\u012b's faction, having expected the caliphate to return to \u02bfAl\u012b's line upon Muawiyah's death, saw this as a betrayal of the peace treaty and so \u1e24usayn rejected this request for allegiance. There was a groundswell of support in Kufa for \u1e24usayn to return there and take his position as caliph and Imam, so \u1e24usayn collected his family and followers in Medina and set off for Kufa.\nEn route to Kufa, Husayn was blocked by an army of Yazid's men, which included people from Kufa, near Karbala. Rather than surrendering, Husayn and his followers chose to fight. In the Battle of Karbala, \u1e24usayn and approximately 72 of his family members and followers were killed, and Husayn's head was delivered to Yazid in Damascus. The Shi'a community regard \u1e24usayn ibn \u02bfAl\u012b as a martyr (\"shahid\"), and count him as an Imam from the . The Battle of Karbala and martyrdom of \u1e24usayn ibn \u02bfAl\u012b is often cited as the definitive separation between the Shia and Sunn\u012b sects of Islam. \u1e24usayn is the last Imam following \u02bfAl\u012b mutually recognized by all branches of Shia Islam. The martyrdom of Husayn and his followers is commemorated on the Day of Ashura, occurring on the tenth day of Muharram, the first month of the Islamic calendar.\nImamate of the \"Ahl al-Bayt\".\nLater, most denominations of Shia Islam, including Twelvers and Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bl\u012bs, became Imamis. Shia Muslims believe that Imams are the spiritual and political successors to Muhammad. Imams are human individuals who not only rule over the Muslim community with justice, but also are able to keep and interpret the divine law and its esoteric meaning. The words and deeds of Muhammad and the Imams are a guide and model for the community to follow; as a result, they must be free from error and sin, and must be chosen by divine decree () through Muhammad. According to this view peculiar to Shia Islam, there is always an Imam of the Age, who is the divinely appointed authority on all matters of faith and law in the Muslim community. \u02bfAl\u012b was the first Imam of this line, the rightful successor to Muhammad, followed by male descendants of Muhammad through his daughter Fatimah.\nThis difference between following either the \"Ahl al-Bayt\" (Muhammad's family and descendants) or pledging allegiance to Ab\u016b Bakr has shaped the Shia\u2013Sunn\u012b divide on the interpretation of some Quranic verses, hadith literature (accounts of the sayings and living habits attributed to the Islamic prophet Muhammad during his lifetime), and other areas of Islamic belief throughout the history of Islam. For instance, the hadith collections venerated by Shia Muslims are centered on narrations by members of the \"Ahl al-Bayt\" and their supporters, while some hadith transmitted by narrators not belonging to or supporting the \"Ahl al-Bayt\" are not included. \nThose of Abu Hurairah, for example, Ibn Asakir in his \"Ta\u02bfrikh Kabir\", and Muttaqi in his \"Kanzu\u02bfl-Umma\" report that \u02bfUmar ibn al-Kha\u1e6d\u1e6d\u0101b lashed him, rebuked him, and forbade him to narrate \"\u1e25ad\u012bth\" from Muhammad. \u02bfUmar is reported to have said: \"Because you narrate hadith in large numbers from the Holy Prophet, you are fit only for attributing lies to him. (That is, one expects a wicked man like you to utter only lies about the Holy Prophet.) So you must stop narrating hadith from the Prophet; otherwise, I will send you to the land of Dus.\" (An Arab clan in Yemen, to which Abu Hurairah belonged). \nAccording to Sunn\u012b Muslims, \u02bfAl\u012b was the fourth successor to Ab\u016b Bakr, while Shia Muslims maintain that \u02bfAl\u012b was the first divinely sanctioned \"Imam\", or successor of Muhammad. The seminal event in Shia history is the martyrdom at the Battle of Karbala of \u02bfAl\u012b's son, \u1e24usayn ibn \u02bfAl\u012b, and 71 of his followers in 680 CE, who led a non-allegiance movement against the defiant caliph.\nIt is believed in Twelver and Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bl\u012b branches of Shia Islam that divine wisdom (\"\u02bfaql\") was the source of the souls of the prophets and Imams, which bestowed upon them esoteric knowledge (\"\u1e25ikmah\"), and that their sufferings were a means of divine grace to their devotees. Although the Imam was not the recipient of a divine revelation (\"wa\u1e25y\"), he had a close relationship with God, through which God guides him, and the Imam, in turn, guides the people. Imamate, or belief in the divine guide, is a fundamental belief in the Twelver and Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bl\u012b branches of Shia Islam, and is based on the concept that God would not leave humanity without access to divine guidance.\nImam Mahdi, last Imam of the Shia.\nIn Shia Islam, Imam Mahdi is regarded as the prophesied eschatological redeemer of Islam who will rule for seven, nine, or nineteen years (according to differing interpretations) before the Day of Judgment and will rid the world of evil. According to Islamic tradition, the Mahdi's tenure will coincide with the Second Coming of Jesus (\u02bf\u012as\u0101), who is to assist the Mahdi against the (literally, the \"false Messiah\" or Antichrist). Jesus, who is considered the \"Masih\" (\"Messiah\") in Islam, will descend at the point of a white arcade east of Damascus, dressed in yellow robes with his head anointed. He will then join the Mahdi in his war against the Dajjal, where it is believed the Mahdi will slay the Dajjal and unite humankind.\nDynasties.\nIn the century following the Battle of Karbala (680 CE), as various Shia-affiliated groups diffused in the emerging Islamic world, several nations arose based on a Shia leadership or population.\nSafavid Empire.\nA major turning point in the history of Shia Islam was the dominion of the Safavid dynasty (1501\u20131736) in Persia. This caused a number of changes in the Muslim world:\nWith the fall of the Safavids, the state in Iran\u2014including the state system of courts with government-appointed judges (\"q\u0101\u1e0d\u012b\")\u2014became much weaker. This gave the \"shar\u012b\u02bfa\" courts of \"mujtahid\" an opportunity to fill the legal vacuum and enabled the \"ulama\" to assert their judicial authority. The Usuli school of thought also increased in strength at this time.\nBeliefs.\nShia Islam encompasses various denominations and subgroups, all bound by the belief that the leader of the Muslim community (\"Ummah\") should hail from \"Ahl al-Bayt\", the family of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. It embodies a completely independent system of religious interpretation and political authority in the Muslim world.\nAl\u012b: Muhammad's rightful successor.\nShia Muslims believe that just as a prophet is appointed by God alone, only God has the prerogative to appoint the successor to his prophet. They believe God chose \u02bfAl\u012b ibn Ab\u012b \u1e6c\u0101lib to be Muhammad's successor and the first caliph () of Islam. Shia Muslims believe that Muhammad designated Ali as his successor by God's command in several instances, but most notably at Eid Al Ghadir. Additionally, \u02bfAl\u012b was Muhammad's first-cousin, closest living male relative, and his son-in-law, having married Muhammad's daughter, F\u0101\u1e6dimah.\nProfession of faith (\"Shahada\").\nThe Shia version of the \"Shahada\" (), the Islamic profession of faith, differs from that of the Sunn\u012bs. The Sunn\u012b version of the \"Shahada\" states \"La ilaha illallah, Muhammadun rasulullah\" (); Shia Muslims add the phrase \"Ali-un-Waliullah\" (). The basis for the Shia belief in \u02bfAl\u012b ibn Ab\u012b \u1e6c\u0101lib as the \"Wali\" of God is derived from the Qur'anic verse https://.\nThis additional phrase to the declaration of faith embodies the Shia emphasis on the inheritance of authority through Muhammad's family and lineage. The three clauses of the Shia version of the \"Shahada\" thus address the fundamental Islamic beliefs of \"Taw\u1e25\u012bd\" (), \"Nubuwwah\" (), and \"Imamah\" ().\nInfallibility (\"Ismah\").\n\"Ismah\" () is the concept of infallibility or \"divinely bestowed freedom from error and sin\" in Islam. Muslims believe that Muhammad, along with the other prophets and messengers, possessed \"ismah\". Twelver and Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bl\u012b Shia Muslims also attribute the quality to Imams as well as to F\u0101\u1e6dimah, daughter of Muhammad, in contrast to the Zayd\u012b Shias, who do not attribute \"ismah\" to the Imams. Though initially beginning as a political movement, infallibility and sinlessness of the Imams later evolved as a distinct belief of (non-Zayd\u012b) Shia Islam.\nAccording to Shia Muslim theologians, infallibility is considered a rational, necessary precondition for spiritual and religious guidance. They argue that since God has commanded absolute obedience from these figures, they must only order that which is right. The state of infallibility is based on the Shia interpretation of the verse of purification. Thus, they are the most pure ones, the only immaculate ones preserved from, and immune to, all uncleanness. It does not mean that supernatural powers prevent them from committing a sin, but due to the fact that they have absolute belief in God, they refrain from doing anything that is a sin.\nThey also have complete knowledge of God's will. They are in possession of all knowledge brought by the angels () to the prophets () and the messengers (). Their knowledge encompasses the totality of all times. Thus, they are believed to act without fault in religious matters. Shi'a Muslims regard \u02bfAl\u012b ibn Ab\u012b \u1e6c\u0101lib as the successor of Muhammad, not only ruling over the entire Muslim community in justice, but also in interpreting the Islamic faith, practices, and its esoteric meaning. \u02bfAl\u012b is regarded as a \"perfect man\" () similar to Muhammad, according to the Shia perspective.\nOccultation (\"Ghaybah\").\nThe Occultation is an eschatological belief held in various denominations of Shia Islam concerning a messianic figure, the hidden and last Imam known as \"the Mahdi\", that one day shall return on Earth and fill the world with justice. According to the doctrine of Twelver Shia Islam, the main goal of Imam Mahdi will be to establish an Islamic state and to apply Islamic laws that were revealed to Muhammad. The Quran does not contain verses on the Imamate, which is the basic doctrine of Shia Islam. \nSome Shia subsects, such as the Zaydism and Nizari Isma'ilism, do not believe in the idea of Occultation. The groups that believe in it differ as to which lineage of the Imamate is valid and, therefore, which individual has gone into Occultation. They believe many signs will indicate the time of his return.\nTwelver Shia Muslims believe that the prophesied Mahdi and 12th Shia Imam, Hujjat Allah al-Mahdi, is already on Earth in Occultation, and will return at the end of time. \u1e6cayyibi Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bl\u012bs and Fatimid/Bohra/Dawoodi Bohra believe the same but for their 21st \u1e6cayyib, At-Tayyib Abi l-Qasim, and also believe that a \"Da'i al-Mutlaq\" (\"Unrestricted Missionary\") maintains contact with him. Sunn\u012b Muslims believe that the future Mahdi has not yet arrived on Earth.\nHadith tradition.\nShia Muslims believe that the status of Ali is supported by numerous \"\u1e25ad\u012bth\" reports, including the Hadith of the pond of Khumm, Hadith of the two weighty things, Hadith of the pen and paper, Hadith of the invitation of the close families, and Hadith of the Twelve Successors. In particular, the Hadith of the Cloak is often quoted to illustrate Muhammad's feeling towards \u02bfAl\u012b and his family by both Sunn\u012b and Shia scholars. Shia Muslims prefer to study and read the hadith attributed to the \"Ahl al-Bayt\" and close associates, and most have their own separate hadith canon.\nHoly Relics (\"Tabarruk\").\nShia Muslims believe that the armaments and sacred items of all of the Abrahamic prophets, including Muhammad, were handed down in succession to the Imams of the \"Ahl al-Bayt\". Ja\u02bffar al-\u1e62\u0101diq, the 6th Shia Imam, in \"Kitab al-Kafi\" mentions that \"with me are the arms of the Messenger of Allah. It is not disputable.\"\nFurther, he claims that with him is the sword of the Messenger of God, his coat of arms, his Lamam (pennon), and his helmet. In addition, he mentions that with him is the flag of the Messenger of God, the victorious. With him is the Staff of Moses, the ring of Solomon, son of David, and the tray on which Moses used to offer his offerings. With him is the name that whenever the Messenger of God would place it between the Muslims and pagans, no arrow from the pagans would reach the Muslims. With him is a similar object that the angels brought.\nAl-\u1e62\u0101diq also narrated that the passing down of armaments is synonymous with receiving the \"Imamat\" (leadership), similar to how the Ark of the Covenant in the house of the Israelites signaled prophethood. Imam Ali al-Ridha narrates that wherever the armaments among us would go, knowledge would also follow and the armaments would never depart from those with knowledge (\"Imamat\").\nOther doctrines.\nDoctrine about necessity of acquiring knowledge.\nAccording to Muhammad Rida al-Muzaffar, God gives humans the faculty of reason and argument. Also, God orders humans to think carefully about creation, while he refers to all creations as his signs of power and glory. These signs encompass all of the universe. Furthermore, there is an analogy of humans as the little world and the universe as the large world. God does not accept the faith of those who follow him without thinking and only with imitation, but God also blames them for such actions. In other words, humans have to think about the universe with reason and intellect, a faculty bestowed on us by God. Since there is more insistence on the faculty of intellect among Shia Muslims, even evaluating the claims of someone who claims prophecy is based on the intellect.\nPractices.\nShia religious practices, such as prayers, differ only slightly from the Sunn\u012bs. While all Muslims pray five times daily, Shia Muslims have the option of combining \"Dhuhr\" with \"Asr\" and \"Maghrib\" with \"Isha\"', as there are three distinct times mentioned in the Quran. The Sunn\u012bs tend to combine only under certain circumstances.\nHolidays.\nShia Muslims celebrate the following annual holidays:\nHoly sites.\nAfter Mecca and Medina, the two holiest cities of Islam, the cities of Najaf, Karbala, Mashhad and Qom are the most revered by Shia Muslims. The Sanctuary of Im\u0101m \u02bfAl\u012b in Najaf, the Shrine of Imam \u1e24usayn in Karbala, The Sanctuary of Imam Reza in Mashhad and the Shrine of F\u0101\u1e6dimah al-Ma\u02bf\u1e63\u016bmah in Qom are very essential for Shia Muslims. Other venerated pilgrimage sites include the Kadhimiya Mosque in Kadhimiya, Al-Askari Mosque in Samarra, the Sahla Mosque, the Great Mosque of Kufa, the Jamkaran Mosque in Qom, and the Tomb of Daniel in Susa.\nMost of the Shia sacred places and heritage sites in Saudi Arabia have been destroyed by the Al Saud-Wahhabi armies of the Ikhwan, the most notable being the tombs of the Imams located in the Al-Baqi' cemetery in 1925. In 2006, a bomb destroyed the shrine of Al-Askari Mosque. (\"See\": Anti-Shi'ism).\nPurity.\nShia orthodoxy, particularly in Twelver Shi'ism, has considered non-Muslims as agents of impurity (\"Naj\u0101sat)\". This categorization sometimes extends to \"kit\u0101b\u1fd1\", individuals belonging to the People of the Book, with Jews explicitly labeled as impure by certain Shia religious scholars. Armenians in Iran, who have historically played a crucial role in the Iranian economy, received relatively more lenient treatment.\nShi'ite theologians and \"mujtahids\" (jurists), such as Mu\u1e25ammad B\u0101qir Majlis\u1fd1, held that Jews' impurity extended to the point where they were advised to stay at home on rainy or snowy days to prevent contaminating their Shia neighbors. Ayatollah Khomeini, Supreme Leader of Iran from 1979 to 1989, asserted that every part of an unbeliever's body, including hair, nails, and bodily secretions, is impure. However, the current leader of Iran, \u02bfAl\u012b Khamene\u02be\u012b, stated in a \"fatwa\" that Jews and other Peoples of the Book are not inherently impure, and touching the moisture on their hands does not convey impurity.\nDemographics.\nShia Islam is the second largest branch of Islam. It is estimated that 10\u201313% of the global Muslim population are Shias. They may number up to 150\u2013200\u00a0million as of 2009. In 1985, Shia Muslims were estimated to be 21% of the Muslim population in South Asia, although the total number is difficult to estimate.\nShia Muslims form a distinct majority of the population in three countries of the Muslim world: Iran, Iraq, and Azerbaijan. A c. 2008 estimate asserted that Shia Muslims constituted 36.3% of the entire population (and 38.6% of the Muslim population) of the Middle East.\nEstimates have placed the proportion of Shia Muslims in Lebanon between 27% and 45% of the population, 30\u201335% of the citizen population in Kuwait (no figures exist for the non-citizen population), over 10% in Turkey, 5\u201315% of the population in Pakistan, and 10\u201319% of Afghanistan's population, and 45% in Bahrain.\nSaudi Arabia hosts a number of distinct Shia communities, including the Twelver Baharna in the Eastern Province and Nakhawila of Medina, and the Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bl\u012b Sulaymani and Zayd\u012b Shias of Najran. Estimations put the number of Shia citizens at roughly 15% of the local population. Approximately 40% of the population of Yemen are Shia Muslims.\nSignificant Shia communities exist in the coastal regions of West Sumatra and Aceh in Indonesia (see Tabuik). The Shia presence is negligible elsewhere in Southeast Asia, where Muslims are predominantly Shafi'i Sunnis.\nA significant Shia minority is present in Nigeria, made up of modern-era converts to a Shia movement centered around Kano and Sokoto states. Several African countries like Kenya, South Africa, Somalia, etc. hold small minority populations of various Shia subsects, primarily descendants of immigrants from South Asia during the colonial period, such as the Khoja.\nSignificant populations worldwide.\nFigures indicated in the first three columns below are based on the October 2009 demographic study by the Pew Research Center report, \"Mapping the Global Muslim Population\".\nMajor denominations or branches.\nThe Shia community throughout its history split over the issue of the Imamate. The largest branch are the Twelvers, followed by the Zayd\u012bs and the Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bl\u012bs. Each subsect of Shia Islam follows its own line of Imamate. All mainstream Twelver and Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bl\u012b Shia Muslims follow the same school of thought, the Ja\u02bdfari jurisprudence, named after Ja\u02bffar al-\u1e62\u0101diq, the 6th Shia Imam. Shia clergymen and jurists usually carry the title of \"mujtahid\" (i.e., someone authorized to issue legal opinions in Shia Islam).\nTwelver.\nTwelver Shia Islam is the largest branch of Shia Islam, and the terms \"Shia Muslim\" and \"Shia\" often refer to the Twelvers by default. The designation \"Twelver\" is derived from the doctrine of believing in twelve divinely ordained leaders, known as \"the Twelve Imams\". Twelver Shia are otherwise known as \"Imami\" or \"Ja\u02bffari\"; the latter term derives from Ja\u02bffar al-\u1e62\u0101diq, the 6th Shia Imam, who elaborated the Twelver jurisprudence. Twelver Shia constitute the majority of the population in Iran (90%), Iraq (65%) and Azerbaijan (55%). Significant populations also exist in Afghanistan, Bahrain (40% of Muslims) and Lebanon (27\u201329% of Muslims).\nDoctrine.\nTwelver doctrine is based on five principles. These five principles known as \"Usul ad-Din\" are as follow:\nBooks.\nBesides the Quran, which is the sacred text common to all Muslims, Twelver Shias derive scriptural and authoritative guidance from collections of sayings and traditions (hadith) attributed to Muhammad and the Twelve Imams. Below is a list of some of the most prominent of these books:\nThe Twelve Imams.\nAccording to the theology of Twelvers, the successor of Muhammad is an infallible human individual who not only rules over the Muslim community with justice but also is able to keep and interpret the divine law (\"shar\u012b\u02bfa\") and its esoteric meaning. The words and deeds of Muhammad and the Twelve Imams are a guide and model for the Muslim community to follow; as a result, they must be free from error and sin, and Imams must be chosen by divine decree (\"nass\") through Muhammad. The twelfth and final Imam is Hujjat Allah al-Mahdi, who is believed by Twelvers to be currently alive and hidden in Occultation.\nJurisprudence.\nThe Twelver jurisprudence is called \"Ja\u02bdfari jurisprudence\". In this school of Islamic jurisprudence, the \"sunnah\" is considered to be comprehensive of the oral traditions of Muhammad and their implementation and interpretation by the Twelve Imams. There are three schools of Ja\u02bffari jurisprudence: Usuli, Akhbari, and Shaykhi; the Usuli school is by far the largest of the three. Twelver groups that do not follow the Ja\u02bffari jurisprudence include Alevis, Bektashi, and Qizilbash.\nThe five pillars of Islam to the Ja\u02bffari jurisprudence are known as \"Usul ad-Din\":\nIn Ja\u02bffari jurisprudence, there are eight secondary pillars, known as \"Furu ad-Din\", which are as follows:\nAccording to Twelvers, defining and interpretation of Islamic jurisprudence (\"fiqh\") is the responsibility of Muhammad and the Twelve Imams. Since the 12th Imam is currently in Occultation, it is the duty of Shia clerics to refer to the Islamic literature, such as the Quran and hadith, and identify legal decisions within the confines of Islamic law to provide means to deal with current issues from an Islamic perspective. In other words, clergymen in Twelver Shia Islam are believed to be the guardians of \"fiqh\", which is believed to have been defined by Muhammad and his twelve successors. This process is known as \"ijtihad\" and the clerics are known as \"marja\u02bf\", meaning \"reference\"; the labels \"Allamah\" and \"Ayatollah\" are in use for Twelver clerics.\nIslamists.\nIslamist Shia () is a new denomination within Twelver Shia Islam greatly inspired by the political ideology of the Muslim Brotherhood and mysticism of Ibn Arabi. It sees Islam as a political system and differs from the other mainstream Usuli and Akhbari groups in favoring the idea of the establishment of an Islamic state in Occultation under the rule of the 12th Imam. Hadi Khosroshahi was the first person to identify himself as \"ikhwani\" (Islamist) Shia Muslim. \nBecause of the concept of the hidden Imam, Muhammad al-Mahdi, Shia Islam is inherently secular in the age of Occultation, therefore Islamist Shia Muslims had to borrow ideas from Sunn\u012b Islamists and adjust them in accordance with the doctrine of Shia Islam. Its foundations were laid during the Persian Constitutional Revolution at the start of 20th century in Qajar Empire (1905\u20131911), when Fazlullah Nouri supported the Persian king Ahmad Shah Qajar against the will of Muhammad Kazim Khurasani, the Usuli \"marja\u02bf\" of the time.\nIsm\u0101\u02bf\u012bl\u012b.\nIsm\u0101\u02bf\u012bl\u012bs, otherwise known as \"Sevener\", derive their name from their acceptance of Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bl ibn Ja\u02bffar as the divinely appointed spiritual successor (Imam) to Ja\u02bffar al-\u1e62\u0101diq, the 6th Shia Imam, wherein they differ from the Twelvers, who recognize M\u016bs\u0101 al-K\u0101\u1e93im, younger brother of Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bl, as the true Imam.\nAfter the death or Occultation of Muhammad ibn Imam Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bl in the 8th century CE, the teachings of Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bl\u012bsm further transformed into the belief system as it is known today, with an explicit concentration on the deeper, esoteric meaning (\"b\u0101\u1e6din\") of the Islamic faith. With the eventual development of Twelver Shia Islam into the more literalistic \"(zah\u012br)\" oriented Akhbari and later Usuli schools of thought, Shia Islam further developed in two separate directions: the metaphorical Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bl\u012b group focusing on the mystical path and nature of God and the divine manifestation in the personage of the \"Imam of the Time\" as the \"Face of God\", with the more literalistic Twelver group focusing on divine law (\"shar\u012b'ah\") and the deeds and sayings (\"sunnah\") attributed to Muhammad and his successors (the \"Ahl al-Bayt\"), who as A'immah were guides and a light (\"n\u016br\") to God.\nThough there are several subsects amongst the Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bl\u012bs, the term in today's vernacular generally refers to the Shia Imami Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bl\u012b Niz\u0101r\u012b community, often referred to as the \"Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bl\u012bs\" by default, who are followers of the Aga Khan and the largest group within Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bl\u012bsm. Another Shia Imami Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bl\u012b community are the Dawudi Bohras, led by a \"Da'i al-Mutlaq\" (\"Unrestricted Missionary\") as representative of a hidden Imam. While there are many other branches with extremely differing exterior practices, much of the spiritual theology has remained the same since the days of the faith's early Imams. In recent centuries, Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bl\u012bs have largely been an Indo-Iranian community, but they can also be found in India, Pakistan, Syria, Palestine, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Jordan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Afghanistan, East and South Africa, and in recent years several Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bl\u012bs have emigrated to China, Western Europe (primarily in the United Kingdom), Australia, New Zealand, and North America.\nIsm\u0101\u02bf\u012bl\u012b Imams.\nIn the Niz\u0101r\u012b Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bl\u012b interpretation of Shia Islam, the Imam is the guide and the intercessor between humans and God, and the individual through whom God is recognized. He is also responsible for the esoteric interpretation of the Quran (\"ta\u02bew\u012bl\"). He is the possessor of divine knowledge and therefore the \"Prime Teacher\". According to the \"Epistle of the Right Path\", a Persian Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bl\u012b prose text from the post-Mongol period of Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bl\u012b history, by an anonymous author, there has been a chain of Imams since the beginning of time, and there will continue to be an Imam present on the Earth until the end of time. The worlds would not exist in perfection without this uninterrupted chain of Imams. The proof (\"hujja\") and gate (\"b\u0101b\") of the Imam are always aware of his presence and are witness to this uninterrupted chain.\nAfter the death of Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bl ibn Ja\u02bffar, many Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bl\u012bs believed that one day the eschatological figure of Imam Mahdi, whom they believed to be Muhammad ibn Imam Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bl, would return and establish an age of justice. One group included the violent Qarmatians, who had a stronghold in Bahrain. In contrast, some Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bl\u012bs believed the Imamate \"did\" continue, and that the Imams were in Occultation and still communicated and taught their followers through a network of \"Da'i\" (\"Missionaries\").\nIn 909 CE, Abdullah al-Mahdi Billah, a claimant to the Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bl\u012b Imamate, established the Fatimid Caliphate. During this period, three lineages of Imams were formed. The first branch, known today as the Druze, began with Al-\u1e24\u0101kim bi-Amr All\u0101h. Born in 985 CE, he ascended as ruler at the age of eleven. When in 1021 CE his mule returned without him, soaked in blood, a religious group that was forming in his lifetime broke off from mainstream Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bl\u012bsm and did not acknowledge his successor. \nLater to be known as the Druze, they believe Al-\u1e24\u0101kim to be God incarnate and the prophesied Mahdi on Earth, who would one day return and bring justice to the world. The Druze faith further split from Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bl\u012bsm as it developed into a distinct monotheistic Abrahamic religion and ethno-religious group with its own unique doctrines, and finally separated from both Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bl\u012bsm and Islam altogether. Thus, the Druze do not identify themselves as Muslims, and are not considered as such by Muslims either.\nThe second split occurred between Niz\u0101r\u012b and Musta\u2018l\u012b Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bl\u012bs following the death of Ma'ad al-Mustansir Billah in 1094 CE. His rule was the longest of any caliph in any Islamic empire. Upon his death, his sons, Niz\u0101r (the older) and Al-Musta\u2018l\u012b (the younger), fought for political and spiritual control of the dynasty. Niz\u0101r was defeated and jailed, but according to the Niz\u0101r\u012b tradition his son escaped to Alamut, where the Iranian Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bl\u012b had accepted his claim. From here on, the Niz\u0101r\u012b Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bl\u012b community has continued with a present, living Imam.\nThe Musta\u2018l\u012b Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bl\u012bs split between the \u1e6cayyibi and the \u1e24\u0101fi\u1e93i; \u1e6cayyibi Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bl\u012bs, also known as \"Bohras\", are further divided between Dawudi Bohras, Sulaymani Bohras, and Alavi Bohras. The former denomination claims that At-Tayyib Abi l-Qasim, son of Al-Amir bi-Ahkami l-Lah, and the Imams following him went into a period of anonymity (\"Dawr-e-Satr\") and appointed a \"Da'i al-Mutlaq\" (\"Unrestricted Missionary\") to guide the community, in a similar manner as the Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bl\u012bs had lived after the death of Muhammad ibn Imam Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bl. The latter denomination claims that the ruling Fatimid caliph was the Imam, and they died out with the fall of the Fatimid Empire.\nPillars.\nIsm\u0101\u02bf\u012bl\u012bs have categorized their practices which are known as \"seven pillars\":\nContemporary leadership.\nThe Niz\u0101r\u012bs place importance on a scholarly institution because of the existence of a present Imam. The Imam of the Age defines the jurisprudence, and his guidance may differ with Imams previous to him because of different times and circumstances. For Niz\u0101r\u012b Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bl\u012bs, the current Imam is Karim al-Husayni Aga Khan IV. The Niz\u0101r\u012b line of Imams has continued to this day as an uninterrupted chain.\nDivine leadership has continued in the Bohra branch through the institution of the \"Missionary\" (\"Da'i\"). According to the Bohra tradition, before the last Imam, At-Tayyib Abi l-Qasim, went into seclusion, his father, the 20th Al-Amir bi-Ahkami l-Lah, had instructed Al-Hurra Al-Malika the Malika (Queen consort) in Yemen to appoint a vicegerent after the seclusion\u2014the \"Da'i al-Mutlaq\" (\"Unrestricted Missionary\"), who as the Imam's vicegerent has full authority to govern the community in all matters both spiritual and temporal while the lineage of Musta\u2018l\u012b-\u1e6cayyibi Imams remains in seclusion (\"Dawr-e-Satr\"). The three branches of Musta\u2018l\u012b Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bl\u012bs (Dawudi Bohras, Sulaymani Bohras, and Alavi Bohras) differ on who the current \"Unrestricted Missionary\" is.\nZayd\u012b.\nZaydism, otherwise known as Zaydiyya or as Zaydi Shia Islam, is a branch of Shia Islam named after Zayd ibn \u02bfAl\u012b. Followers of the Zayd\u012b school of jurisprudence are called Zayd\u012bs or occasionally \"Fivers\". However, there is also a group called \"Zayd\u012b W\u0101si\u1e6d\u012bs\" who are Twelvers (see below). Zayd\u012bs constitute roughly 42\u201347% of the population of Yemen.\nDoctrine.\nThe Zayd\u012bs, Twelvers, and Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bl\u012bs all recognize the same first four Imams; however, the Zayd\u012bs consider Zayd ibn \u02bfAl\u012b as the 5th Imam. After the time of Zayd ibn \u02bfAl\u012b, the Zayd\u012bs believed that any descendant (\"Sayyid\") of \u1e24asan ibn \u02bfAl\u012b or \u1e24usayn ibn \u02bfAl\u012b could become the next Imam, after fulfilling certain conditions. Other well-known Zayd\u012b Imams in history were Yahya ibn Zayd, Muhammad al-Nafs al-Zakiyya, and Ibrahim ibn Abdullah.\nThe Zayd\u012b doctrine of Imamah does not presuppose the infallibility of the Imam, nor the belief that the Imams are supposed to receive divine guidance. Moreover, Zayd\u012bs do not believe that the Imamate must pass from father to son but believe it can be held by any \"Sayyid\" descended from either \u1e24asan ibn \u02bfAl\u012b or \u1e24usayn ibn \u02bfAl\u012b (as was the case after the death of the former). Historically, Zayd\u012bs held that Zayd ibn \u02bfAl\u012b was the rightful successor of the 4th Imam since he led a rebellion against the Umayyads in protest of their tyranny and corruption. Muhammad al-Baqir did not engage in political action, and the followers of Zayd ibn \u02bfAl\u012b maintained that a true Imam must fight against corrupt rulers.\nJurisprudence.\nIn matters of Islamic jurisprudence, Zayd\u012bs follow the teachings of Zayd ibn \u02bfAl\u012b, which are documented in his book \"Majmu'l Fiqh\" (in Arabic: \u0645\u062c\u0645\u0648\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0650\u0642\u0647). Al-\u1e24\u0101d\u012b ila'l-\u1e24aqq Ya\u1e25y\u0101, the first Zayd\u012b Imam and founder of the Zayd\u012b State in Yemen, is regarded as the codifier of Zayd\u012b jurisprudence, and as such most Zayd\u012b Shias today are known as \"Hadawis\".\nTimeline.\nThe Idrisids () were Arab Zayd\u012b Shias whose dynasty, named after its first sultan, Idris I, ruled in the western Maghreb from 788 to 985 CE. Another Zayd\u012b State was established in the region of Gilan, Deylaman, and Tabaristan (northern Iran) in 864 CE by the Alavids; it lasted until the death of its leader at the hand of the Samanids in 928 CE. Roughly forty years later, the Zayd\u012b State was revived in Gilan and survived under Hasanid leaders until 1126 CE. Afterwards, from the 12th to 13th centuries, the Zayd\u012b Shias of Deylaman, Gilan, and Tabaristan then acknowledged the Zayd\u012b Imams of Yemen or rival Zayd\u012b Imams within Iran.\nThe Buyids were initially Zayd\u012b Shias, as were the Banu Ukhaidhir rulers of al-Yamama in the 9th and 10th centuries. The leader of the Zayd\u012b community took the title of caliph; thus, the ruler of Yemen was known by this title. Al-Hadi Yahya bin al-Hussain bin al-Qasim ar-Rassi, a descendant of \u1e24asan ibn \u02bfAl\u012b, founded the Zayd\u012b Imamate at Sa'dah in 893\u2013897 CE, and the Rassid dynasty continued to rule over Yemen until the middle of the 20th century, when the republican revolution of 1962 deposed the last Zayd\u012b Imam. \"See\": Arab Cold War. \nThe founding Zayd\u012b branch in Yemen was the Jarudiyya. With increasing interaction with the \u1e24anaf\u012b and Sh\u0101fi\u02bf\u012b schools of Sunn\u012b jurisprudence, there was a shift from the Jarudiyya group to the Sulaimaniyya, Tabiriyya, Butriyya, and Salihiyya. Zayd\u012b Shias form the second dominant religious group in Yemen. Currently, they constitute about 40\u201345% of the population in Yemen; Ja\u02bffaris and Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bl\u012bs constitute the 2\u20135%. In Saudi Arabia there are over 1\u00a0million Zayd\u012b Shias, primarily in the western provinces.\nCurrently, the most prominent Zayd\u012b political movement is the Houthi movement in Yemen, known by the name of \"Shabab al-Mu'mineen\" (\"Believing Youth\") or \"Ansar Allah\" (\"Partisans of God\"). In 2014\u20132015, Houthis took over the Yemeni government in Sana'a, which led to the fall of the Saudi Arabian-backed government of Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi. Houthis and their allies gained control of a significant part of Yemen's territory, and resisted the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen seeking to restore Hadi in power. (\"See\": Iran\u2013Saudi Arabia proxy conflict). Both the Houthis and the Saudi Arabian-led coalition were being attacked by the Sunn\u012b Islamist militant group and Salafi-jihadist terrorist organization ISIL/ISIS/IS/Daesh.\nPersecution of Shia Muslims.\nThe history of Shia\u2013Sunni relations has often involved religious discrimination, persecution, and violence, dating back to the earliest development of the two competing sects.\nAt various times throughout the history of Islam, Shia groups and minorities have faced persecution perpetrated by Sunn\u012b Muslims.\nMilitarily established and holding control over the Umayyad government, many Sunn\u012b rulers perceived the Shias as a threat\u2014both to their political and religious authority. The Sunn\u012b rulers under the Umayyad dynasty sought to marginalize the Shia minority, and later the Abbasids turned on their Shia allies and imprisoned, persecuted, and killed them. The persecution of Shia Muslims throughout history by their Sunn\u012b co-religionists has often been characterized by brutal and genocidal acts. Comprising only about 10\u201315% of the global Muslim population, Shia Muslims remain a marginalized community to this day in many Sunn\u012b-dominant Arab countries, and are denied the rights to practice their religion and freely organize.\nIn 1514, the Ottoman sultan Selim I (1512\u20131520) ordered the massacre of 40,000 Alevis and Bektashi (Anatolian Shia Muslims). According to Jalal Al-e-Ahmad, \"Sultan Selim I carried things so far that he announced that the killing of one Shia had as much otherworldly reward as killing 70 Christians.\" In 1802, the Al Saud-Wahhabi armies of the Ikhwan from the First Saudi State (1727\u20131818) attacked and sacked the city of Karbala, the Shia shrine in Najaf (eastern region of Iraq) that commemorates the martyrdom and death of \u1e24usayn ibn \u02bfAl\u012b.\nDuring the rule of Saddam Hussein's Ba'athist Iraq, Shia political activists were arrested, tortured, expelled or killed, as part of a crackdown launched after an assassination attempt against Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz in 1980. In March 2011, the Malaysian government declared Shia Islam a \"deviant\" sect and banned Shia Muslims from promoting their faith to other Muslims, but left them free to practice it themselves privately.\nThe most recent campaign of anti-Shia oppression was the Islamic State organization's persecution of Shias in its territories in Northern Iraq, which occurred alongside the persecution of various religious groups and the genocide of Yazidis by the same organization.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "26962", "revid": "12530063", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26962", "title": "Special relativity", "text": "Theory of interwoven space and time by Albert Einstein\nIn physics, the special theory of relativity, or special relativity for short, is a scientific theory of the relationship between space and time. In Albert Einstein's 1905 paper, \"On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies\", the theory is presented as being based on just two postulates:\nThe first postulate was first formulated by Galileo Galilei (see \"Galilean invariance\").\nOverview.\nRelativity is a theory that accurately describes objects moving at speeds far beyond normal experience. Relativity replaces the idea that time flows equally everywhere in the universe with a new concept that time flows differently for every independent object. The flow of time can be expressed by counting ticks on a clock. Moving clocks run slower. At speeds encountered in normal experience, the slow down cannot be observed. Two events measured at the same time on a stationary clock occur at different times if measured on moving clocks. Near the speed of light many physical effects can only be understood by including the effects of special relativity. \nBasis.\nUnusual among modern topics in physics, the theory of special relativity needs only mathematics at high school level and yet it fundamentally alters our understanding, especially our understanding of the concept of time. Built on just two postulates or assumptions, many interesting consequences follow. \nThe two postulates both concern observers moving at a constant speed relative to each other. The first postulate, the , says the laws of physics do not depend on objects being at absolute rest: for example, an observer on a train sees natural phenomena on that train that look the same whether the train is moving or not. The second postulate, constant speed of light, says observers in a train station see light travel at the same speed whether they measure light from within the station or light from a moving train. A light signal from the station to the train has the same speed, no matter how fast a train goes.\nIn the theory of special relativity, the two postulates combine to change the definition of \"relative speed\". Rather than the simple concept of distance traveled divided by time spent, the new theory incorporates the speed of light as the maximum possible speed. In special relativity, covering ten times more distance on the ground in the same amount of time according to a moving watch does not result in a speed up as seen from the ground by a factor of ten.\nConsequences.\nSpecial relativity has a wide range of consequences that have been experimentally verified. The conceptual effects include:\nCombined with other laws of physics, the two postulates of special relativity predict the equivalence of mass and energy, as expressed in the mass\u2013energy equivalence formula &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, where formula_1 is the speed of light in vacuum.\nSpecial relativity replaced the conventional notion of an absolute, universal time with the notion of a time that is local to each observer. Information about distant objects can arrive no faster than the speed of light so visual observations always report events that have happened in the past. This effect makes visual descriptions of the effects of special relativity especially prone to mistakes. \nSpecial relativity also has profound technical consequences.\nA defining feature of special relativity is the replacement of Euclidean geometry with Lorentzian geometry. Distances in Euclidean geometry are calculated with the Pythagorean theorem and only involved spatial coordinates. In Lorentzian geometry, 'distances' become 'intervals' and include a time coordinate with a minus sign. Unlike spatial distances, the interval between two events has the same value for all observers independent of their relative velocity. When comparing two sets of coordinates in relative motion the Lorentz transformation replaces the Galilean transformation of Newtonian mechanics. \nOther effects include the relativistic corrections to the Doppler effect and the Thomas precession. \nIt also explains how electricity and magnetism are related.\nHistory.\nThe principle of relativity, forming one of the two postulates of special relativity, was described by Galileo Galilei in 1632 using a thought experiment involving observing natural phenomena on a moving ship. His conclusions were summarized as Galilean relativity and used as the basis of Newtonian mechanics. This principle can be expressed as a coordinate transformation, between two coordinate systems. Isaac Newton noted that many transformations, such as those involving rotation or acceleration, will not preserve the observation of physical phenomena. Newton considered only those transformations involving motion with respect to an immovable absolute space, now called transformations between inertial frames.\nIn 1864 James Clerk Maxwell presented a theory of electromagnetism which did not obey Galilean relativity. The theory specifically predicted a constant speed of light in vacuum, no matter the motion (velocity, acceleration, etc.) of the light emitter or receiver or its frequency, wavelength, direction, polarization, or phase. This, as yet untested theory, was thought at the time to be only valid in inertial frames fixed in an aether. Numerous experiments followed, attempting to measure the speed of light as Earth moved through the proposed fixed aether, culminating in the 1887 Michelson\u2013Morley experiment which only confirmed the constant speed of light.\nSeveral fixes to the aether theory were proposed, with those of George Francis FitzGerald, Hendrik Antoon Lorentz, and Jules Henri Poincare all pointing in the direction of a result similar to the theory of special relativity. The final important step was taken by Albert Einstein in a paper published on 26 September 1905 titled \"On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies\". Einstein applied the Lorentz transformations known to be compatible with Maxwell's equations for electrodynamics to the classical laws of mechanics. This changed Newton's mechanics situations involving all motions, especially velocities close to that of light (known as \"&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;relativistic velocities\"). \nAnother way to describe the advance made by the special theory is to say Einstein extended the Galilean principle so that it accounted for the constant speed of light, a phenomenon that had been observed in the Michelson\u2013Morley experiment. He also postulated that it holds for all the laws of physics, including both the laws of mechanics and of electrodynamics.\nThe theory became essentially complete in 1907, with Hermann Minkowski's papers on spacetime.\nSpecial relativity has proven to be the most accurate model of motion at any speed when gravitational and quantum effects are negligible. Even so, the Newtonian model remains accurate at low velocities relative to the speed of light, for example, everyday motion on Earth.\nWhen updating his 1911 book on relativity, to include general relativity in 1920, Robert Daniel Carmichael called the earlier work the \"restricted theory\" as a \"special case\" of the new general theory; he also used the phrase \"special theory of relativity\". In comparing to the general theory in 1923 Einstein specifically called his earlier work \"the special theory of relativity\", saying he meant a restriction to frames uniform motion.\nJust as Galilean relativity is accepted as an approximation of special relativity that is valid for low speeds, special relativity is considered an approximation of general relativity that is valid for weak gravitational fields, that is, at a sufficiently small scale (e.g., when tidal forces are negligible) and in conditions of free fall. But general relativity incorporates non-Euclidean geometry to represent gravitational effects as the geometric curvature of spacetime. Special relativity is restricted to the flat spacetime known as Minkowski space. As long as the universe can be modeled as a pseudo-Riemannian manifold, a Lorentz-invariant frame that abides by special relativity can be defined for a sufficiently small neighborhood of each point in this curved spacetime.\nTerminology.\nSpecial relativity builds upon important physics ideas. Among the most basic of these are the following:\nTwo observers in relative motion receive information about two events via light signals traveling at constant speed, independent of either observer's speed. Their motion during the transit time causes them to get the information at different times on their local clock.\nThe more technical background ideas include:\nformula_2\nTraditional \"two postulates\" approach to special relativity.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"Reflections of this type made it clear to me as long ago as shortly after 1900, i.e., shortly after Planck's trailblazing work, that neither mechanics nor electrodynamics could (except in limiting cases) claim exact validity. Gradually I despaired of the possibility of discovering the true laws by means of constructive efforts based on known facts. The longer and the more desperately I tried, the more I came to the conviction that only the discovery of a universal formal principle could lead us to assured results\u00a0... How, then, could such a universal principle be found?\"\nAlbert Einstein: \"Autobiographical Notes\"\nEinstein discerned two fundamental propositions that seemed to be the most assured, regardless of the exact validity of the (then) known laws of either mechanics or electrodynamics. These propositions were the constancy of the speed of light in vacuum and the independence of physical laws (especially the constancy of the speed of light) from the choice of inertial system. In his initial presentation of special relativity in 1905 he expressed these postulates as:\nThe constancy of the speed of light was motivated by Maxwell's theory of electromagnetism and the lack of evidence for the luminiferous ether. There is conflicting evidence on the extent to which Einstein was influenced by the null result of the Michelson\u2013Morley experiment. In any case, the null result of the Michelson\u2013Morley experiment helped the notion of the constancy of the speed of light gain widespread and rapid acceptance.\nThe derivation of special relativity depends not only on these two explicit postulates, but also on several tacit assumptions, including the isotropy and homogeneity of space and the independence of measuring rods and clocks from their past history.\nPrinciple of relativity.\nReference frames and relative motion.\nReference frames play a crucial role in relativity theory. The term reference frame as used here is an observational perspective in space that is not undergoing any change in motion (acceleration), from which a position can be measured along 3 spatial axes (so, at rest or constant velocity). In addition, a reference frame has the ability to determine measurements of the time of events using a \"clock\" (any reference device with uniform periodicity).\nAn event is an occurrence that can be assigned a single unique moment and location in space relative to a reference frame: it is a \"point\" in spacetime. Since the speed of light is constant in relativity irrespective of the reference frame, pulses of light can be used to unambiguously measure distances and refer back to the times that events occurred to the clock, even though light takes time to reach the clock after the event has transpired.\nFor example, the explosion of a firecracker may be considered to be an \"event\". We can completely specify an event by its four spacetime coordinates: The time of occurrence and its 3-dimensional spatial location define a reference point. Let's call this reference frame \"S\".\nIn relativity theory, we often want to calculate the coordinates of an event from differing reference frames. The equations that relate measurements made in different frames are called \"transformation equations\".\nStandard configuration.\nTo gain insight into how the spacetime coordinates measured by observers in different reference frames compare with each other, it is useful to work with a simplified setup with frames in a \"standard configuration\". With care, this allows simplification of the math with no loss of generality in the conclusions that are reached. In Fig.\u00a02-1, two Galilean reference frames (i.e., conventional 3-space frames) are displayed in relative motion. Frame S belongs to a first observer \"O\", and frame \"S\"\u2032 (pronounced \"S\u00a0prime\" or \"S dash\") belongs to a second observer \"O\"\u2032.\nSince there is no absolute reference frame in relativity theory, a concept of \"moving\" does not strictly exist, as everything may be moving with respect to some other reference frame. Instead, any two frames that move at the same speed in the same direction are said to be \"comoving\". Therefore, \"S\" and \"S\"\u2032 are not \"comoving\".\nLack of an absolute reference frame.\nThe principle of relativity, which states that physical laws have the same form in each inertial reference frame, dates back to Galileo, and was incorporated into Newtonian physics. But in the late 19th century the existence of electromagnetic waves led some physicists to suggest that the universe was filled with a substance they called \"aether\", which, they postulated, would act as the medium through which these waves, or vibrations, propagated (in many respects similar to the way sound propagates through air). The aether was thought to be an absolute reference frame against which all speeds could be measured, and could be considered fixed and motionless relative to Earth or some other fixed reference point. The aether was supposed to be sufficiently elastic to support electromagnetic waves, while those waves could interact with matter, yet offering no resistance to bodies passing through it (its one property was that it allowed electromagnetic waves to propagate). The results of various experiments, including the Michelson\u2013Morley experiment in 1887 (subsequently verified with more accurate and innovative experiments), led to the theory of special relativity, by showing that the aether did not exist. Einstein's solution was to discard the notion of an aether and the absolute state of rest. In relativity, any reference frame moving with uniform motion will observe the same laws of physics. In particular, the speed of light in vacuum is always measured to be \"c\", even when measured by multiple systems that are moving at different (but constant) velocities.\nRelativity without the second postulate.\nFrom the principle of relativity alone without assuming the constancy of the speed of light (i.e., using the isotropy of space and the symmetry implied by the principle of special relativity) it can be shown that the spacetime transformations between inertial frames are either Euclidean, Galilean, or Lorentzian. In the Lorentzian case, one can then obtain relativistic interval conservation and a certain finite limiting speed. Experiments suggest that this speed is the speed of light in vacuum.\nLorentz transformation.\nTwo- vs one- postulate approaches.\nEinstein combined the two postulates \u2013 of relativity \u2013 and of the invariance of the speed of light, into a single postulate, the Lorentz transformation:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFollowing Einstein's original presentation of special relativity in 1905, many different sets of postulates have been proposed in various alternative derivations, but Einstein stuck to his approach throughout work.\nHenri Poincar\u00e9 provided the mathematical framework for relativity theory by proving that Lorentz transformations are a subset of his Poincar\u00e9 group of symmetry transformations. Einstein later derived these transformations from his axioms.\nWhile the traditional two-postulate approach to special relativity is presented in innumerable college textbooks and popular presentations, other treatments of special relativity base it on the single postulate of universal Lorentz covariance, or, equivalently, on the single postulate of Minkowski spacetime. Textbooks starting with the single postulate of Minkowski spacetime include those by Taylor and Wheeler and by Callahan.\nLorentz transformation and its inverse.\nDefine an event to have spacetime coordinates (\"t\", \"x\", \"y\", \"z\") in system \"S\" and (\"t\"\u2032, \"x\"\u2032, \"y\"\u2032, \"z\"\u2032) in a reference frame \"S\"\u2032 moving at a velocity \"v\" along the \"x\"-axis. Then the Lorentz transformation specifies that these coordinates are related in the following way:\nformula_3\nwhere formula_4 is the Lorentz factor and \"c\" is the speed of light in vacuum, and the velocity \"v\" of \"S\"\u2032, relative to \"S\", is parallel to the \"x\"-axis. For simplicity, the \"y\" and \"z\" coordinates are unaffected; only the \"x\" and \"t\" coordinates are transformed. These Lorentz transformations form a one-parameter group of linear mappings, that parameter being called rapidity.\nSolving the four transformation equations above for the unprimed coordinates yields the inverse Lorentz transformation:\nformula_5\nThis shows that the unprimed frame is moving with the velocity \u2212\"v\", as measured in the primed frame.\nThere is nothing special about the \"x\"-axis. The transformation can apply to the \"y\"- or \"z\"-axis, or indeed in any direction parallel to the motion (which are warped by the \"\u03b3\" factor) and perpendicular; see the article Lorentz transformation for details.\nA quantity that is invariant under Lorentz transformations is known as a Lorentz scalar.\nWriting the Lorentz transformation and its inverse in terms of coordinate differences, where one event has coordinates (\"x\"1, \"t\"1) and (\"x\"\u20321, \"t\"\u20321), another event has coordinates (\"x\"2, \"t\"2) and (\"x\"\u20322, \"t\"\u20322), and the differences are defined as\nwe get\nIf we take differentials instead of taking differences, we get\nGraphical representation of the Lorentz transformation.\nSpacetime diagrams (also called Minkowski diagrams) are an extremely useful aid to visualizing how coordinates transform between different reference frames. Although it is not as easy to perform exact computations using them as directly invoking the Lorentz transformations, their main power is their ability to provide an intuitive grasp of the results of a relativistic scenario.\nTo draw a spacetime diagram, begin by considering two Galilean reference frames, S and S\u2032, in standard configuration, as shown in Fig.\u00a02-1.\nFig.\u00a03-1a. Draw the formula_16 and formula_17 axes of frame S. The formula_16 axis is horizontal and the formula_19 (time written in units of space) axis is vertical, which is the opposite of the usual convention in kinematics. The formula_19 axis is scaled by a factor of formula_1 so that both axes have common units of length. In the diagram shown, the gridlines are spaced one unit distance apart. The 45\u00b0 diagonal lines represent the \"worldlines\" of two photons passing through the origin at time formula_22 The slope of these worldlines is 1 because the photons advance one unit in space per unit of time. Two events, formula_23 and formula_24 have been plotted on this graph so that their coordinates may be compared in the S and S' frames.\nFig.\u00a03-1b. Draw the formula_25 and formula_26 axes of frame S'. The formula_26 axis represents the worldline of the origin of the S' coordinate system as measured in frame S. In this figure, formula_28 Both the formula_26 and formula_25 axes are tilted from the unprimed axes by an angle formula_31 where formula_32 The primed and unprimed axes share a common origin because frames S and S' had been set up in standard configuration, so that formula_33 when formula_34\nFig.\u00a03-1c. Units in the primed axes have a different scale from units in the unprimed axes. From the Lorentz transformations, it can be observed that formula_35 coordinates of formula_36 in the primed coordinate system transform to formula_37 in the unprimed coordinate system. Likewise, formula_35 coordinates of formula_39 in the primed coordinate system transform to formula_40 in the unprimed system. Draw gridlines parallel with the formula_26 axis through points formula_42 as measured in the unprimed frame, where formula_43 is an integer. Likewise, draw gridlines parallel with the formula_25 axis through formula_45 as measured in the unprimed frame. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we observe that the spacing between formula_26 units equals formula_47 times the spacing between formula_19 units, as measured in frame S. This ratio is always greater than 1, and approaches infinity as formula_49\nFig.\u00a03-1d. Since the speed of light is an invariant, the \"worldlines\" of two photons passing through the origin at time formula_50 still plot as 45\u00b0 diagonal lines. The primed coordinates of formula_23 and formula_52 are related to the unprimed coordinates through the Lorentz transformations and \"could\" be approximately measured from the graph (assuming that it has been plotted accurately enough), but the real merit of a Minkowski diagram is its granting us a geometric view of the scenario. For example, in this figure, we observe that the two timelike-separated events that had different x-coordinates in the unprimed frame are now at the same position in space.\nWhile the unprimed frame is drawn with space and time axes that meet at right angles, the primed frame is drawn with axes that meet at acute or obtuse angles. This asymmetry is due to unavoidable distortions in how spacetime coordinates map onto a Cartesian plane. The frames are equivalent.\nConsequences derived from the Lorentz transformation.\nThe consequences of special relativity can be derived from the Lorentz transformation equations. These transformations, and hence special relativity, lead to different physical predictions than those of Newtonian mechanics at all relative velocities, and most pronounced when relative velocities become comparable to the speed of light. The speed of light is so much larger than anything most humans encounter that some of the effects predicted by relativity are initially counterintuitive.\nInvariant interval.\nIn Galilean relativity, the spatial separation, (&amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;), and the temporal separation, (&amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;), between two events are independent invariants, the values of which do not change when observed from different frames of reference. In special relativity, however, the interweaving of spatial and temporal coordinates generates the concept of an invariant interval, denoted as &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;:\nformula_53\nIn considering the physical significance of &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, there are three cases:\nThe interweaving of space and time revokes the implicitly assumed concepts of absolute simultaneity and synchronization across non-comoving frames.\nThe form of &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, being the \"difference\" of the squared time lapse and the squared spatial distance, demonstrates a fundamental discrepancy between Euclidean and spacetime distances. The invariance of \u0394\"s\"2 under standard Lorentz transformation is analogous to the invariance of squared distances \u0394\"r\"2 under rotations in Euclidean space. Although space and time have an equal \"footing\" in relativity, the minus sign in front of the spatial terms marks space and time as being of essentially different character. They are not the same. Because it treats time differently than it treats the 3 spatial dimensions, Minkowski space differs from four-dimensional Euclidean space. The invariance of this interval is a property of the \"general\" Lorentz transform (also called the Poincar\u00e9 transformation), making it an isometry of spacetime. The general Lorentz transform extends the standard Lorentz transform (which deals with translations without rotation, that is, Lorentz boosts, in the x-direction) with all other translations, reflections, and rotations between any Cartesian inertial frame.\nIn the analysis of simplified scenarios, such as spacetime diagrams, a reduced-dimensionality form of the invariant interval is often employed:\nformula_65\nDemonstrating that the interval is invariant is straightforward for the reduced-dimensionality case and with frames in standard configuration:\nformula_66\nThe value of formula_67 is hence independent of the frame in which it is measured.\nRelativity of simultaneity.\nConsider two events happening in two different locations that occur simultaneously in the reference frame of one inertial observer. They may occur non-simultaneously in the reference frame of another inertial observer (lack of absolute simultaneity).\nFrom Equation\u00a03 (the forward Lorentz transformation in terms of coordinate differences)\nformula_68\nIt is clear that the two events that are simultaneous in frame \"S\" (satisfying \u0394\"t\" = 0), are not necessarily simultaneous in another inertial frame \"S\"\u2032 (satisfying \u0394\"t\"\u2032 = 0). Only if these events are additionally co-local in frame \"S\" (satisfying \u0394\"x\" = 0), will they be simultaneous in another frame \"S\"\u2032.\nThe Sagnac effect can be considered a manifestation of the relativity of simultaneity for local inertial frames comoving with a rotating Earth. Instruments based on the Sagnac effect for their operation, such as ring laser gyroscopes and fiber optic gyroscopes, are capable of extreme levels of sensitivity.\nTime dilation.\nThe time lapse between two events is not invariant from one observer to another, but is dependent on the relative speeds of the observers' reference frames.\nSuppose a clock is at rest in the unprimed system \"S\". The location of the clock on two different ticks is then characterized by \u0394\"x\" = 0. To find the relation between the times between these ticks as measured in both systems, Equation\u00a03 can be used to find:\n formula_69\u00a0for events satisfying\u00a0formula_70\nThis shows that the time (\u0394\"t\"\u2032) between the two ticks as seen in the frame in which the clock is moving (\"S\"\u2032), is \"longer\" than the time (\u0394\"t\") between these ticks as measured in the rest frame of the clock (\"S\"). Time dilation explains a number of physical phenomena; for example, the lifetime of high speed muons created by the collision of cosmic rays with particles in the Earth's outer atmosphere and moving towards the surface is greater than the lifetime of slowly moving muons, created and decaying in a laboratory.\nWhenever one hears a statement to the effect that \"moving clocks run slow\", one should envision an inertial reference frame thickly populated with identical, synchronized clocks. As a moving clock travels through this array, its reading at any particular point is compared with a stationary clock at the same point.\nThe measurements obtained from direct observation of a moving clock would be delayed by the finite speed of light, i.e. the times seen would be distorted by the Doppler effect. Measurements of relativistic effects must always be understood as having been made after finite speed-of-light effects have been factored out.\nLangevin's light-clock.\nPaul Langevin, an early proponent of the theory of relativity, did much to popularize the theory in the face of resistance by many physicists to Einstein's revolutionary concepts. Among his numerous contributions to the foundations of special relativity were independent work on the mass\u2013energy relationship, a thorough examination of the twin paradox, and investigations into rotating coordinate systems. His name is frequently attached to a hypothetical construct called a \"light-clock\" (originally developed by Lewis and Tolman in 1909), which he used to perform a novel derivation of the Lorentz transformation.\nA light-clock is imagined to be a box of perfectly reflecting walls wherein a light signal reflects back and forth from opposite faces. The concept of time dilation is frequently taught using a light-clock that is traveling in uniform inertial motion perpendicular to a line connecting the two mirrors. (Langevin himself made use of a light-clock oriented parallel to its line of motion.)\nConsider the scenario illustrated in Fig. 4-3A. Observer A holds a light-clock of length formula_71 as well as an electronic timer with which she measures how long it takes a pulse to make a round trip up and down along the light-clock. Although observer A is traveling rapidly along a train, from her point of view the emission and receipt of the pulse occur at the same place, and she measures the interval using a single clock located at the precise position of these two events. For the interval between these two events, observer A finds &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;. A time interval measured using a single clock that is motionless in a particular reference frame is called a \"proper time interval\".\nFig. 4-3B illustrates these same two events from the standpoint of observer B, who is parked by the tracks as the train goes by at a speed of &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;. Instead of making straight up-and-down motions, observer B sees the pulses moving along a zig-zag line. However, because of the postulate of the constancy of the speed of light, the speed of the pulses along these diagonal lines is the same formula_1 that observer A saw for her up-and-down pulses. B measures the speed of the vertical component of these pulses as formula_73 so that the total round-trip time of the pulses is formula_74&amp;NoBreak;}&amp;NoBreak;. Note that for observer B, the emission and receipt of the light pulse occurred at different places, and he measured the interval using two stationary and synchronized clocks located at two different positions in his reference frame. The interval that B measured was therefore \"not\" a proper time interval because he did not measure it with a single resting clock.\nReciprocal time dilation.\nIn the above description of the Langevin light-clock, the labeling of one observer as stationary and the other as in motion was completely arbitrary. One could just as well have observer B carrying the light-clock and moving at a speed of formula_54 to the left, in which case observer A would perceive B's clock as running slower than her local clock.\nThere is no paradox here, because there is no independent observer C who will agree with both A and B. Observer C necessarily makes his measurements from his own reference frame. If that reference frame coincides with A's reference frame, then C will agree with A's measurement of time. If C's reference frame coincides with B's reference frame, then C will agree with B's measurement of time. If C's reference frame coincides with neither A's frame nor B's frame, then C's measurement of time will disagree with \"both\" A's and B's measurement of time.\nTwin paradox.\nThe reciprocity of time dilation between two observers in separate inertial frames leads to the so-called twin paradox, articulated in its present form by Langevin in 1911. Langevin imagined an adventurer wishing to explore the future of the Earth. This traveler boards a projectile capable of traveling at 99.995% of the speed of light. After making a round-trip journey to and from a nearby star lasting only two years of his own life, he returns to an Earth that is two hundred years older.\nThis result appears puzzling because both the traveler and an Earthbound observer would see the other as moving, and so, because of the reciprocity of time dilation, one might initially expect that each should have found the other to have aged less. In reality, there is no paradox at all, because in order for the two observers to perform side-by-side comparisons of their elapsed proper times, the symmetry of the situation must be broken: At least one of the two observers must change their state of motion to match that of the other.\nKnowing the general resolution of the paradox, however, does not immediately yield the ability to calculate correct quantitative results. Many solutions to this puzzle have been provided in the literature and have been reviewed in the Twin paradox article. We will examine in the following one such solution to the paradox.\nOur basic aim will be to demonstrate that, after the trip, both twins are in perfect agreement about who aged by how much, regardless of their different experiences. Fig 4-4 illustrates a scenario where the traveling twin flies at 0.6 c to and from a star 3 ly distant. During the trip, each twin sends yearly time signals (measured in their own proper times) to the other. After the trip, the cumulative counts are compared. On the outward phase of the trip, each twin receives the other's signals at the lowered rate of &amp;NoBreak;}&amp;NoBreak;. Initially, the situation is perfectly symmetric: note that each twin receives the other's one-year signal at two years measured on their own clock. The symmetry is broken when the traveling twin turns around at the four-year mark as measured by her clock. During the remaining four years of her trip, she receives signals at the enhanced rate of &amp;NoBreak;}&amp;NoBreak;. The situation is quite different with the stationary twin. Because of light-speed delay, he does not see his sister turn around until eight years have passed on his own clock. Thus, he receives enhanced-rate signals from his sister for only a relatively brief period. Although the twins disagree in their respective measures of total time, we see in the following table, as well as by simple observation of the Minkowski diagram, that each twin is in total agreement with the other as to the total number of signals sent from one to the other. There is hence no paradox.\nLength contraction.\nThe dimensions (e.g., length) of an object as measured by one observer may be smaller than the results of measurements of the same object made by another observer (e.g., the ladder paradox involves a long ladder traveling near the speed of light and being contained within a smaller garage).\nSimilarly, suppose a measuring rod is at rest and aligned along the \"x\"-axis in the unprimed system \"S\". In this system, the length of this rod is written as \u0394\"x\". To measure the length of this rod in the system \"S\"\u2032, in which the rod is moving, the distances \"x\u2032\" to the end points of the rod must be measured simultaneously in that system \"S\"\u2032. In other words, the measurement is characterized by \u0394\"t\"\u2032 = 0, which can be combined with Equation\u00a04 to find the relation between the lengths \u0394\"x\" and \u0394\"x\"\u2032:\n formula_76\u00a0\u00a0for events satisfying\u00a0formula_77\nThis shows that the length (\u0394\"x\"\u2032) of the rod as measured in the frame in which it is moving (\"S\"\u2032), is \"shorter\" than its length (\u0394\"x\") in its own rest frame (\"S\").\nTime dilation and length contraction are not merely appearances. Time dilation is explicitly related to our way of measuring \"time intervals\" between events that occur at the same place in a given coordinate system (called \"co-local\" events). These time intervals are \"different\" in another coordinate system moving with respect to the first, unless the events, in addition to being co-local, are also simultaneous. Similarly, length contraction relates to our measured distances between separated but simultaneous events in a given coordinate system of choice. If these events are not co-local, but are separated by distance (space), they will \"not\" occur at the same \"spatial distance\" from each other when seen from another moving coordinate system.\nLorentz transformation of velocities.\nConsider two frames \"S\" and \"S\"\u2032 in standard configuration. A particle in \"S\" moves in the x direction with velocity vector &amp;NoBreak;}&amp;NoBreak;. What is its velocity formula_78 in frame \"S\"\u2032?\nWe can write\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Numbered block/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Numbered block/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSubstituting expressions for formula_79 and formula_80 from Equation\u00a05 into Equation\u00a08, followed by straightforward mathematical manipulations and back-substitution from Equation\u00a07 yields the Lorentz transformation of the speed formula_81 to &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;:\nThe inverse relation is obtained by interchanging the primed and unprimed symbols and replacing formula_82 with &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Numbered block/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFor formula_83 not aligned along the x-axis, we write:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Numbered block/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Numbered block/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe forward and inverse transformations for this case are:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Numbered block/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Numbered block/styles.css\" /&gt;\nEquation\u00a010 and Equation\u00a014 can be interpreted as giving the \"resultant\" formula_84 of the two velocities formula_85 and &amp;NoBreak;}&amp;NoBreak;, and they replace the formula &amp;NoBreak;}&amp;NoBreak;. which is valid in Galilean relativity. Interpreted in such a fashion, they are commonly referred to as the \"relativistic velocity addition (or composition) formulas\", valid for the three axes of \"S\" and \"S\"\u2032 being aligned with each other (although not necessarily in standard configuration).\nWe note the following points:\nThere is nothing special about the \"x\" direction in the standard configuration. The above formalism applies to any direction; and three orthogonal directions allow dealing with all directions in space by decomposing the velocity vectors to their components in these directions. See \"Velocity-addition formula\" for details.\nThomas rotation.\nThe composition of two non-collinear Lorentz boosts (i.e., two non-collinear Lorentz transformations, neither of which involve rotation) results in a Lorentz transformation that is not a pure boost but is the composition of a boost and a rotation.\nThomas rotation results from the relativity of simultaneity. In Fig.\u00a04-5a, a rod of length formula_71 in its rest frame (i.e., having a proper length of &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;) rises vertically along the y-axis in the ground frame.\nIn Fig.\u00a04-5b, the same rod is observed from the frame of a rocket moving at speed formula_54 to the right. If we imagine two clocks situated at the left and right ends of the rod that are synchronized \"in the frame of the rod\", relativity of simultaneity causes the observer in the rocket frame to observe (not \"see\") the clock at the right end of the rod as being advanced in time by &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, and the rod is correspondingly observed as tilted.\nUnlike second-order relativistic effects such as length contraction or time dilation, this effect becomes quite significant even at fairly low velocities. For example, this can be seen in the spin of moving particles, where Thomas precession is a relativistic correction that applies to the spin of an elementary particle or the rotation of a macroscopic gyroscope, relating the angular velocity of the spin of a particle following a curvilinear orbit to the angular velocity of the orbital motion.\nThomas rotation provides the resolution to the well-known \"meter stick and hole paradox\".\nCausality and prohibition of motion faster than light.\nIn Fig.\u00a04-6, the time interval between the events A (the \"cause\") and B (the \"effect\") is 'timelike'; that is, there is a frame of reference in which events A and B occur at the \"same location in space\", separated only by occurring at different times. If A precedes B in that frame, then A precedes B in all frames accessible by a Lorentz transformation. It is possible for matter (or information) to travel (below light speed) from the location of A, starting at the time of A, to the location of B, arriving at the time of B, so there can be a causal relationship (with A the cause and B the effect).\nThe interval AC in the diagram is 'spacelike'; that is, there is a frame of reference in which events A and C occur simultaneously, separated only in space. There are also frames in which A precedes C (as shown) and frames in which C precedes A. But no frames are accessible by a Lorentz transformation, in which events A and C occur at the same location. If it were possible for a cause-and-effect relationship to exist between events A and C, paradoxes of causality would result.\nFor example, if signals could be sent faster than light, then signals could be sent into the sender's past (observer B in the diagrams). A variety of causal paradoxes could then be constructed.\nConsider the spacetime diagrams in Fig.\u00a04-7. A and B stand alongside a railroad track, when a high-speed train passes by, with C riding in the last car of the train and D riding in the leading car. The world lines of A and B are vertical (\"ct\"), distinguishing the stationary position of these observers on the ground, while the world lines of C and D are tilted forwards (\"ct\u2032\"), reflecting the rapid motion of the observers C and D stationary in their train, as observed from the ground.\nIt is not necessary for signals to be instantaneous to violate causality. Even if the signal from D to C were slightly shallower than the formula_25 axis (and the signal from A to B slightly steeper than the formula_16 axis), it would still be possible for B to receive his message before he had sent it. By increasing the speed of the train to near light speeds, the formula_26 and formula_25 axes can be squeezed very close to the dashed line representing the speed of light. With this modified setup, it can be demonstrated that even signals only \"slightly\" faster than the speed of light will result in causality violation.\nTherefore, if causality is to be preserved, one of the consequences of special relativity is that no information signal or material object can travel faster than light in vacuum.\nOnly matter and energy are limited by the speed of light. Various trivial situations can be described where some imaginary points move faster than light. For example, the location where the beam of a search light hits the bottom of a cloud can move faster than light when the search light is turned rapidly. The light beam is not solid and it does not instantly follow the motion of the search light and thus does not violate causality or any other relativistic phenomenon.\nOptical effects.\nDragging effects.\nIn 1850, Hippolyte Fizeau and L\u00e9on Foucault independently established that light travels more slowly in water than in air, thus validating a prediction of Fresnel's wave theory of light and invalidating the corresponding prediction of Newton's corpuscular theory. The speed of light was measured in still water. What would be the speed of light in flowing water?\nIn 1851, Fizeau conducted an experiment to answer this question, a simplified representation of which is illustrated in Fig.\u00a05-1. A beam of light is divided by a beam splitter, and the split beams are passed in opposite directions through a tube of flowing water. They are recombined to form interference fringes, indicating a difference in optical path length, that an observer can view. The experiment demonstrated that dragging of the light by the flowing water caused a displacement of the fringes, showing that the motion of the water had affected the speed of the light.\nAccording to the theories prevailing at the time, light traveling through a moving medium would be a simple sum of its speed \"through\" the medium plus the speed \"of\" the medium. Contrary to expectation, Fizeau found that although light appeared to be dragged by the water, the magnitude of the dragging was much lower than expected. If formula_94 is the speed of light in still water, and formula_54 is the speed of the water, and formula_96 is the water-borne speed of light in the lab frame with the flow of water adding to or subtracting from the speed of light, then\nformula_97\nFizeau's results, although consistent with Fresnel's earlier hypothesis of partial aether dragging, were extremely disconcerting to physicists of the time. Among other things, the presence of an index of refraction term meant that, since formula_98 depends on wavelength, \"the aether must be capable of sustaining different motions at the same time\". A variety of theoretical explanations were proposed to explain Fresnel's dragging coefficient, that were completely at odds with each other. Even before the Michelson\u2013Morley experiment, Fizeau's experimental results were among a number of observations that created a critical situation in explaining the optics of moving bodies.\nFrom the point of view of special relativity, Fizeau's result is nothing but an approximation to Equation\u00a010, the relativistic formula for composition of velocities.\n formula_99 formula_100 formula_101 formula_102\nRelativistic aberration of light.\nBecause of the finite speed of light, if the relative motions of a source and receiver include a transverse component, then the direction from which light arrives at the receiver will be displaced from the geometric position in space of the source relative to the receiver. The classical calculation of the displacement takes two forms and makes different predictions depending on whether the receiver, the source, or both are in motion with respect to the medium. (1) If the receiver is in motion, the displacement would be the consequence of the aberration of light. The incident angle of the beam relative to the receiver would be calculable from the vector sum of the receiver's motions and the velocity of the incident light. (2) If the source is in motion, the displacement would be the consequence of light-time correction. The displacement of the apparent position of the source from its geometric position would be the result of the source's motion during the time that its light takes to reach the receiver.\nThe classical explanation failed experimental test. Since the aberration angle depends on the relationship between the velocity of the receiver and the speed of the incident light, passage of the incident light through a refractive medium should change the aberration angle. In 1810, Arago used this expected phenomenon in a failed attempt to measure the speed of light, and in 1870, George Airy tested the hypothesis using a water-filled telescope, finding that, against expectation, the measured aberration was identical to the aberration measured with an air-filled telescope. A \"cumbrous\" attempt to explain these results used the hypothesis of partial aether-drag, but was incompatible with the results of the Michelson\u2013Morley experiment, which apparently demanded \"complete\" aether-drag.\nAssuming inertial frames, the relativistic expression for the aberration of light is applicable to both the receiver moving and source moving cases. A variety of trigonometrically equivalent formulas have been published. Expressed in terms of the variables in Fig.\u00a05-2, these include\n formula_103 \u00a0\u00a0OR\u00a0\u00a0 formula_104 \u00a0\u00a0OR\u00a0\u00a0 formula_105\nRelativistic Doppler effect.\nRelativistic longitudinal Doppler effect.\nThe classical Doppler effect depends on whether the source, receiver, or both are in motion with respect to the medium. The relativistic Doppler effect is independent of any medium. Nevertheless, relativistic Doppler shift for the longitudinal case, with source and receiver moving directly towards or away from each other, can be derived as if it were the classical phenomenon, but modified by the addition of a time dilation term, and that is the treatment described here.\nAssume the receiver and the source are moving \"away\" from each other with a relative speed formula_54 as measured by an observer on the receiver or the source (The sign convention adopted here is that formula_54 is \"negative\" if the receiver and the source are moving \"towards\" each other). Assume that the source is stationary in the medium. Then\nformula_108\nwhere formula_109 is the speed of sound.\nFor light, and with the receiver moving at relativistic speeds, clocks on the receiver are time dilated relative to clocks at the source. The receiver will measure the received frequency to be\nformula_110\nwhere\nAn identical expression for relativistic Doppler shift is obtained when performing the analysis in the reference frame of the \"receiver\" with a moving source.\nTransverse Doppler effect.\nThe transverse Doppler effect is one of the main novel predictions of the special theory of relativity.\nClassically, one might expect that if source and receiver are moving transversely with respect to each other with no longitudinal component to their relative motions, that there should be no Doppler shift in the light arriving at the receiver.\nSpecial relativity predicts otherwise. Fig.\u00a05-3 illustrates two common variants of this scenario. Both variants can be analyzed using simple time dilation arguments. In Fig.\u00a05-3a, the receiver observes light from the source as being blueshifted by a factor of &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;. In Fig.\u00a05-3b, the light is redshifted by the same factor.\nMeasurement versus visual appearance.\nTime dilation and length contraction are not optical illusions, but genuine effects. Measurements of these effects are not an artifact of Doppler shift, nor are they the result of neglecting to take into account the time it takes light to travel from an event to an observer.\nScientists make a fundamental distinction between \"measurement\" or \"observation\" on the one hand, versus \"visual appearance\", or what one \"sees\". The measured shape of an object is a hypothetical snapshot of all of the object's points as they exist at a single moment in time. But the visual appearance of an object is affected by the varying lengths of time that light takes to travel from different points on the object to one's eye.\nFor many years, the distinction between the two had not been generally appreciated, and it had generally been thought that a length contracted object passing by an observer would be observed as length contracted. In 1959, James Terrell and Roger Penrose independently pointed out that differential time lag effects in signals reaching the observer from the different parts of a moving object result in a fast moving object's visual appearance being quite different from its measured shape. For example, a receding object would \"appear\" contracted, an approaching object would \"appear\" elongated, and a passing object would have a skew appearance that has been likened to a rotation. A sphere in motion retains the circular outline for all speeds, for any distance, and for all view angles, although\nthe surface of the sphere and the images on it will appear distorted.\nBoth Fig.\u00a05-4 and Fig.\u00a05-5 illustrate objects moving transversely to the line of sight. In Fig.\u00a05-4, a cube is viewed from a distance of four times the length of its sides. At high speeds, the sides of the cube that are perpendicular to the direction of motion appear hyperbolic in shape. The cube is not rotated. Rather, light from the rear of the cube takes longer to reach one's eyes compared with light from the front, during which time the cube has moved to the right. At high speeds, the sphere in Fig.\u00a05-5 takes on the appearance of a flattened disk tilted up to 45\u00b0 from the line of sight. If the objects' motions are not strictly transverse but instead include a longitudinal component, exaggerated distortions in perspective may be seen. This illusion has come to be known as \"Terrell rotation\" or the \"Terrell\u2013Penrose effect\".\nAnother example where visual appearance is at odds with measurement comes from the observation of apparent superluminal motion in various radio galaxies, BL Lac objects, quasars, and other astronomical objects that eject relativistic-speed jets of matter at narrow angles with respect to the viewer. An apparent optical illusion results giving the appearance of faster than light travel. In Fig.\u00a05-6, galaxy M87 streams out a high-speed jet of subatomic particles almost directly towards us, but Penrose\u2013Terrell rotation causes the jet to appear to be moving laterally in the same manner that the appearance of the cube in Fig.\u00a05-4 has been stretched out.\nDynamics.\nSection \"\" dealt strictly with kinematics, the study of the motion of points, bodies, and systems of bodies without considering the forces that caused the motion. This section discusses masses, forces, energy and so forth, and as such requires consideration of physical effects beyond those encompassed by the Lorentz transformation itself.\nEquivalence of mass and energy.\nMass\u2013energy equivalence is a consequence of special relativity. The energy and momentum, which are separate in Newtonian mechanics, form a four-vector in relativity, and this relates the time component (the energy) to the space components (the momentum) in a non-trivial way. For an object at rest, the energy\u2013momentum four-vector is (\"E\"/\"c\", 0, 0, 0): it has a time component, which is the energy, and three space components, which are zero. By changing frames with a Lorentz transformation in the x direction with a small value of the velocity v, the energy momentum four-vector becomes (\"E\"/\"c\", \"Ev\"/\"c\"2, 0, 0). The momentum is equal to the energy multiplied by the velocity divided by \"c\"2. As such, the Newtonian mass of an object, which is the ratio of the momentum to the velocity for slow velocities, is equal to \"E\"/\"c\"2.\nThe energy and momentum are properties of matter and radiation, and it is impossible to deduce that they form a four-vector just from the two basic postulates of special relativity by themselves, because these do not talk about matter or radiation, they only talk about space and time. The derivation therefore requires some additional physical reasoning. In his 1905 paper, Einstein used the additional principles that Newtonian mechanics should hold for slow velocities, so that there is one energy scalar and one three-vector momentum at slow velocities, and that the conservation law for energy and momentum is exactly true in relativity. Furthermore, he assumed that the energy of light is transformed by the same Doppler-shift factor as its frequency, which he had previously shown to be true based on Maxwell's equations. The first of Einstein's papers on this subject was \"Does the Inertia of a Body Depend upon its Energy Content?\" in 1905. Although Einstein's argument in this paper is nearly universally accepted by physicists as correct, even self-evident, many authors over the years have suggested that it is wrong. Other authors suggest that the argument was merely inconclusive because it relied on some implicit assumptions.\nEinstein acknowledged the controversy over his derivation in his 1907 survey paper on special relativity. There he notes that it is problematic to rely on Maxwell's equations for the heuristic mass\u2013energy argument. The argument in his 1905 paper can be carried out with the emission of any massless particles, but the Maxwell equations are implicitly used to make it obvious that the emission of light in particular can be achieved only by doing work. To emit electromagnetic waves, all you have to do is shake a charged particle, and this is clearly doing work, so that the emission is of energy.\nEinstein's 1905 demonstration of \"E\" = \"mc\"2.\nIn his fourth of his 1905 Annus mirabilis papers, Einstein presented a heuristic argument for the equivalence of mass and energy. Although, as discussed above, subsequent scholarship has established that his arguments fell short of a broadly definitive proof, the conclusions that he reached in this paper have stood the test of time.\nEinstein took as starting assumptions his recently discovered formula for relativistic Doppler shift, the laws of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum, and the relationship between the frequency of light and its energy as implied by Maxwell's equations.\nFig. 6-1 (top). Consider a system of plane waves of light having frequency formula_113 traveling in direction formula_114 relative to the x-axis of reference frame \"S\". The frequency (and hence energy) of the waves as measured in frame \"S\"\u2032 that is moving along the x-axis at velocity formula_54 is given by the relativistic Doppler shift formula that Einstein had developed in his 1905 paper on special relativity:\n formula_116\nFig. 6-1 (bottom). Consider an arbitrary body that is stationary in reference frame \"S\". Let this body emit a pair of equal-energy light-pulses in opposite directions at angle formula_114 with respect to the x-axis. Each pulse has energy &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;. Because of conservation of momentum, the body remains stationary in \"S\" after emission of the two pulses. Let formula_118 be the energy of the body before emission of the two pulses and formula_119 after their emission.\nNext, consider the same system observed from frame \"S\"\u2032 that is moving along the x-axis at speed formula_54 relative to frame \"S\". In this frame, light from the forwards and reverse pulses will be relativistically Doppler-shifted. Let formula_121 be the energy of the body measured in reference frame \"S\"\u2032 before emission of the two pulses and formula_122 after their emission. We obtain the following relationships:\n formula_123\nFrom the above equations, we obtain the following:\nThe two differences of form formula_124 seen in the above equation have a straightforward physical interpretation. Since formula_125 and formula_126 are the energies of the arbitrary body in the moving and stationary frames, formula_127 and formula_128 represents the kinetic energies of the bodies before and after the emission of light (except for an additive constant that fixes the zero point of energy and is conventionally set to zero). Hence,\nTaking a Taylor series expansion and neglecting higher order terms, he obtained\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Numbered block/styles.css\" /&gt;\nComparing the above expression with the classical expression for kinetic energy, \"K.E.\"\u00a0=\u00a0\"mv\"2, Einstein then noted: \"If a body gives off the energy \"L\" in the form of radiation, its mass diminishes by \"L\"/\"c\"2.\"\nRindler has observed that Einstein's heuristic argument suggested merely that energy \"contributes\" to mass. In 1905, Einstein's cautious expression of the mass\u2013energy relationship allowed for the possibility that \"dormant\" mass might exist that would remain behind after all the energy of a body was removed. By 1907, however, Einstein was ready to assert that \"all\" inertial mass represented a reserve of energy. \"To equate \"all\" mass with energy required an act of aesthetic faith, very characteristic of Einstein.\" Einstein's bold hypothesis has been amply confirmed in the years subsequent to his original proposal.\nFor a variety of reasons, Einstein's original derivation is currently seldom taught. Besides the vigorous debate that continues until this day as to the formal correctness of his original derivation, the recognition of special relativity as being what Einstein called a \"principle theory\" has led to a shift away from reliance on electromagnetic phenomena to purely dynamic methods of proof.\nHow far can you travel from the Earth?\nSince nothing can travel faster than light, one might conclude that a human can never travel farther from Earth than ~\u00a0100 light years. You would easily think that a traveler would never be able to reach more than the few solar systems that exist within the limit of 100 light years from Earth. However, because of time dilation, a hypothetical spaceship can travel thousands of light years during a passenger's lifetime. If a spaceship could be built that accelerates at a constant 1\"g\", it will, after one year, be travelling at almost the speed of light as seen from Earth. This is described by:\nformula_129\nwhere \"v\"(\"t\") is the velocity at a time \"t\", \"a\" is the acceleration of the spaceship and \"t\" is the coordinate time as measured by people on Earth. Therefore, after one year of accelerating at 9.81\u00a0m/s2, the spaceship will be travelling at \"v\" = 0.712 \"c\" and 0.946 \"c\" after three years, relative to Earth. After three years of this acceleration, with the spaceship achieving a velocity of 94.6% of the speed of light relative to Earth, time dilation will result in each second experienced on the spaceship corresponding to 3.1 seconds back on Earth. During their journey, people on Earth will experience more time than they do \u2013 since their clocks (all physical phenomena) would really be ticking 3.1 times faster than those of the spaceship. A 5-year round trip for the traveller will take 6.5 Earth years and cover a distance of over 6 light-years. A 20-year round trip for them (5 years accelerating, 5 decelerating, twice each) will land them back on Earth having travelled for 335 Earth years and a distance of 331 light years. A full 40-year trip at 1\"g\" will appear on Earth to last 58,000 years and cover a distance of 55,000 light years. A 40-year trip at 1.1 \"g\" will take years and cover about light years. A one-way 28 year (14 years accelerating, 14 decelerating as measured with the astronaut's clock) trip at 1\"g\" acceleration could reach 2,000,000 light-years to the Andromeda Galaxy. This same time dilation is why a muon travelling close to \"c\" is observed to travel much farther than \"c\" times its half-life (when at rest).\nElastic collisions.\nExamination of the collision products generated by particle accelerators around the world provides scientists evidence of the structure of the subatomic world and the natural laws governing it. Analysis of the collision products, the sum of whose masses may vastly exceed the masses of the incident particles, requires special relativity.\nIn Newtonian mechanics, analysis of collisions involves use of the conservation laws for mass, momentum and energy. In relativistic mechanics, mass is not independently conserved, because it has been subsumed into the total relativistic energy. We illustrate the differences that arise between the Newtonian and relativistic treatments of particle collisions by examining the simple case of two perfectly elastic colliding particles of equal mass. (\"Inelastic\" collisions are discussed in Spacetime#Conservation laws. Radioactive decay may be considered a sort of time-reversed inelastic collision.)\nElastic scattering of charged elementary particles deviates from ideality due to the production of Bremsstrahlung radiation.\nNewtonian analysis.\nFig. 6-2 provides a demonstration of the result, familiar to billiard players, that if a stationary ball is struck elastically by another one of the same mass (assuming no sidespin, or \"English\"), then after collision, the diverging paths of the two balls will subtend a right angle. (a) In the stationary frame, an incident sphere traveling at 2v strikes a stationary sphere. (b) In the center of momentum frame, the two spheres approach each other symmetrically at \u00b1v. After elastic collision, the two spheres rebound from each other with equal and opposite velocities \u00b1u. Energy conservation requires that |u| = |v|. (c) Reverting to the stationary frame, the rebound velocities are v \u00b1 u. The dot product (v + u) \u22c5 (v \u2212 u) = v2 \u2212 u2 = 0, indicating that the vectors are orthogonal.\nRelativistic analysis.\nConsider the elastic collision scenario in Fig.\u00a06-3 between a moving particle colliding with an equal mass stationary particle. Unlike the Newtonian case, the angle between the two particles after collision is less than 90\u00b0, is dependent on the angle of scattering, and becomes smaller and smaller as the velocity of the incident particle approaches the speed of light:\nThe relativistic momentum and total relativistic energy of a particle are given by\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Numbered block/styles.css\" /&gt;\nConservation of momentum dictates that the sum of the momenta of the incoming particle and the stationary particle (which initially has momentum = 0) equals the sum of the momenta of the emergent particles:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Numbered block/styles.css\" /&gt;\nLikewise, the sum of the total relativistic energies of the incoming particle and the stationary particle (which initially has total energy mc2) equals the sum of the total energies of the emergent particles:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Numbered block/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBreaking down (6-5) into its components, replacing formula_54 with the dimensionless &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, and factoring out common terms from (6-5) and (6-6) yields the following:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Numbered block/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Numbered block/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Numbered block/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFrom these we obtain the following relationships:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Numbered block/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFor the symmetrical case in which formula_131 and &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, (6-12) takes on the simpler form:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Numbered block/styles.css\" /&gt;\nRapidity.\nLorentz transformations relate coordinates of events in one reference frame to those of another frame. Relativistic composition of velocities is used to add two velocities together. The formulas to perform the latter computations are nonlinear, making them more complex than the corresponding Galilean formulas.\nThis nonlinearity is an artifact of our choice of parameters. We have previously noted that in an \"x\"\u2013\"ct\" spacetime diagram, the points at some constant spacetime interval from the origin form an invariant hyperbola. We have also noted that the coordinate systems of two spacetime reference frames in standard configuration are hyperbolically rotated with respect to each other.\nThe natural functions for expressing these relationships are the hyperbolic analogs of the trigonometric functions. Fig.\u00a07-1a shows a unit circle with sin(\"a\") and cos(\"a\"), the only difference between this diagram and the familiar unit circle of elementary trigonometry being that \"a\" is interpreted, not as the angle between the ray and the \"x\"-axis, but as twice the area of the sector swept out by the ray from the \"x\"-axis. Numerically, the angle and 2 \u00d7 area measures for the unit circle are identical. Fig.\u00a07-1b shows a unit hyperbola with sinh(\"a\") and cosh(\"a\"), where \"a\" is likewise interpreted as twice the tinted area. Fig.\u00a07-2 presents plots of the sinh, cosh, and tanh functions.\nFor the unit circle, the slope of the ray is given by\n formula_132\nIn the Cartesian plane, rotation of point (\"x\", \"y\") into point (\"x\"', \"y\"') by angle \"\u03b8\" is given by\n formula_133\nIn a spacetime diagram, the velocity parameter formula_134 is the analog of slope. The \"rapidity\", \"\u03c6\", is defined by\n formula_135\nwhere\n formula_136\nThe rapidity defined above is very useful in special relativity because many expressions take on a considerably simpler form when expressed in terms of it. For example, rapidity is simply additive in the collinear velocity-addition formula;\n formula_137 formula_138 formula_139\nor in other words, &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;.\nThe Lorentz transformations take a simple form when expressed in terms of rapidity. The \"\u03b3\" factor can be written as\n formula_140 formula_141\n formula_142 formula_143\nTransformations describing relative motion with uniform velocity and without rotation of the space coordinate axes are called \"boosts\".\nSubstituting \"\u03b3\" and \"\u03b3\u03b2\" into the transformations as previously presented and rewriting in matrix form, the Lorentz boost in the \"x\"-direction may be written as\n formula_144\nand the inverse Lorentz boost in the \"x\"-direction may be written as\n formula_145\nIn other words, Lorentz boosts represent hyperbolic rotations in Minkowski spacetime.\nThe advantages of using hyperbolic functions are such that some textbooks such as the classic ones by Taylor and Wheeler introduce their use at a very early stage.\nMinkowski spacetime.\nThe physical theory of special relativity was recast by Hermann Minkowski in a 4-dimensional geometry now called Minkowski space. Minkowski spacetime appears to be very similar to the standard 3-dimensional Euclidean space, but there is a crucial difference with respect to time.\nIn 3D space, the differential of distance (line element) \"ds\" is defined by\nformula_146\nwhere \"d\"x = (\"dx\"1, \"dx\"2, \"dx\"3) are the differentials of the three spatial dimensions. In Minkowski geometry, there is an extra dimension with coordinate \"X\"0 derived from time, such that the distance differential fulfills\nformula_147\nwhere \"d\"X = (\"dX\"0, \"dX\"1, \"dX\"2, \"dX\"3) are the differentials of the four spacetime dimensions. This suggests a deep theoretical insight: special relativity is simply a rotational symmetry of our spacetime, analogous to the rotational symmetry of Euclidean space (see Fig.\u00a010-1). Just as Euclidean space uses a Euclidean metric, so spacetime uses a Minkowski metric. Basically, special relativity can be stated as the \"invariance of any spacetime interval\" (that is the 4D distance between any two events) when viewed from \"any inertial reference frame\". All equations and effects of special relativity can be derived from this rotational symmetry (the Poincar\u00e9 group) of Minkowski spacetime.\nThe form of \"ds\" above depends on the metric and on the choices for the \"X\"0 coordinate.\nTo make the time coordinate look like the space coordinates, it can be treated as imaginary: \"X\"0 = \"ict\" (this is called a Wick rotation).\nAccording to Misner, Thorne and Wheeler (1971, \u00a72.3), ultimately the deeper understanding of both special and general relativity will come from the study of the Minkowski metric (described below) and to take \"X\"0 = \"ct\", rather than a \"disguised\" Euclidean metric using \"ict\" as the time coordinate.\nSome authors use \"X\"0 = \"t\", with factors of \"c\" elsewhere to compensate; for instance, spatial coordinates are divided by \"c\" or factors of \"c\"\u00b12 are included in the metric tensor.\nThese numerous conventions can be superseded by using natural units where \"c\" = 1. Then space and time have equivalent units, and no factors of \"c\" appear anywhere.\nA four dimensional space has four-dimensional vectors, or \"four-vectors\". The simplest example of a four-vector is the position of an event in spacetime, which constitutes a timelike component \"ct\" and spacelike component x = (\"x\", \"y\", \"z\"), in a contravariant position four-vector with components:\nformula_148\nwhere we define \"X\"0 = \"ct\" so that the time coordinate has the same dimension of distance as the other spatial dimensions; so that space and time are treated equally.\n4\u2011vectors.\n4\u2011vectors, and more generally tensors, simplify the mathematics and conceptual understanding of special relativity. Working exclusively with such objects leads to formulas that are \"manifestly\" relativistically invariant, which is a considerable advantage in non-trivial contexts. For instance, demonstrating relativistic invariance of Maxwell's equations in their usual form is not trivial, while it is merely a routine calculation, really no more than an observation, using the field strength tensor formulation.\nDefinition of 4-vectors.\nA 4-tuple, &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; is a \"4-vector\" if its component \"Ai\" transform between frames according to the Lorentz transformation.\nIf using &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; coordinates, \"A\" is a 4\u2013vector if it transforms (in the \"x\"-direction) according to\n formula_149\nwhich comes from simply replacing \"ct\" with \"A\"0 and \"x\" with \"A\"1 in the earlier presentation of the Lorentz transformation.\nAs usual, when we write \"x\", \"t\", etc. we generally mean \u0394\"x\", \u0394\"t\" etc.\nThe last three components of a 4\u2013vector must be a standard vector in three-dimensional space. Therefore, a 4\u2013vector must transform like &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; under Lorentz transformations as well as rotations.\n In addition to being invariant under Lorentz transformation, the above inner product is also invariant under rotation in 3-space.\n Two vectors are said to be \"orthogonal\" if &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;. Unlike the case with 3-vectors, orthogonal 4-vectors are not necessarily at right angles to each other. The rule is that two 4-vectors are orthogonal if they are offset by equal and opposite angles from the 45\u00b0 line, which is the world line of a light ray. This implies that a lightlike 4-vector is orthogonal to \"itself\".\n The 4-velocity is tangent to the world line of a particle, and has a length equal to one unit of time in the frame of the particle.\n An accelerated particle does not have an inertial frame in which it is always at rest. However, an inertial frame can always be found that is momentarily comoving with the particle. This frame, the \"momentarily comoving reference frame\" (MCRF), enables application of special relativity to the analysis of accelerated particles.\n Since photons move on null lines, formula_162 for a photon, and a 4-velocity cannot be defined. There is no frame in which a photon is at rest, and no MCRF can be established along a photon's path.\n As indicated before, there are varying treatments for the energy\u2013momentum 4-vector so that one may also see it expressed as formula_164 or &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;. The first component is the total energy (including mass) of the particle (or system of particles) in a given frame, while the remaining components are its spatial momentum. The energy\u2013momentum 4-vector is a conserved quantity.\nExamples of 4-vectors.\nAs expected, the final components of the above 4-vectors are all standard 3-vectors corresponding to spatial 3-momentum, 3-force etc.\n4-vectors and physical law.\nThe first postulate of special relativity declares the equivalency of all inertial frames. A physical law holding in one frame must apply in all frames, since otherwise it would be possible to differentiate between frames. Newtonian momenta fail to behave properly under Lorentzian transformation, and Einstein preferred to change the definition of momentum to one involving 4-vectors rather than give up on conservation of momentum.\nPhysical laws must be based on constructs that are frame independent. This means that physical laws may take the form of equations connecting scalars, which are always frame independent. However, equations involving 4-vectors require the use of tensors with appropriate rank, which themselves can be thought of as being built up from 4-vectors.\n General relativity from the outset relies heavily on 4\u2011vectors, and more generally tensors, representing physically relevant entities.\nAcceleration.\nSpecial relativity does accommodate accelerations as well as accelerating frames of reference.\nIt is a common misconception that special relativity is applicable only to inertial frames, and that it is unable to handle accelerating objects or accelerating reference frames. It is only when gravitation is significant that general relativity is required.\nProperly handling accelerating frames does require some care, however. The difference between special and general relativity is that (1) In special relativity, all velocities are relative, but acceleration is absolute. (2) In general relativity, all motion is relative, whether inertial, accelerating, or rotating. To accommodate this difference, general relativity uses curved spacetime.\nIn this section, we analyze several scenarios involving accelerated reference frames.\nDewan\u2013Beran\u2013Bell spaceship paradox.\nThe Dewan\u2013Beran\u2013Bell spaceship paradox (Bell's spaceship paradox) is a good example of a problem where intuitive reasoning unassisted by the geometric insight of the spacetime approach can lead to issues.\nIn Fig.\u00a07-4, two identical spaceships float in space and are at rest relative to each other. They are connected by a string that is capable of only a limited amount of stretching before breaking. At a given instant in our frame, the observer frame, both spaceships accelerate in the same direction along the line between them with the same constant proper acceleration. In relativity theory, proper acceleration is the physical acceleration (i.e., measurable acceleration as by an accelerometer) experienced by an object. It is thus acceleration relative to a free-fall, or inertial, observer who is momentarily at rest relative to the object being measured. Will the string break?\nWhen the paradox was new and relatively unknown, even professional physicists had difficulty working out the solution. Two lines of reasoning lead to opposite conclusions. Both arguments, which are presented below, are flawed even though one of them yields the correct answer.\nThe problem with the first argument is that there is no \"frame of the spaceships\". There cannot be, because the two spaceships measure a growing distance between the two. Because there is no common frame of the spaceships, the length of the string is ill-defined. Nevertheless, the conclusion is correct, and the argument is mostly right. The second argument, however, completely ignores the relativity of simultaneity.\nA spacetime diagram (Fig.\u00a07-5) makes the correct solution to this paradox almost immediately evident. Two observers in Minkowski spacetime accelerate with constant magnitude formula_172 acceleration for proper time formula_173 (acceleration and elapsed time measured by the observers themselves, not some inertial observer). They are comoving and inertial before and after this phase. In Minkowski geometry, the length along the line of simultaneity formula_174 turns out to be greater than the length along the line of simultaneity &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;.\nThe length increase can be calculated with the help of the Lorentz transformation. If, as illustrated in Fig.\u00a07-5, the acceleration is finished, the ships will remain at a constant offset in some frame &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;. If formula_175 and formula_176 are the ships' positions in &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, the positions in frame formula_177 are:\n formula_178\nThe \"paradox\", as it were, comes from the way that Bell constructed his example. In the usual discussion of Lorentz contraction, the rest length is fixed and the moving length shortens as measured in frame &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;. As shown in Fig.\u00a07-5, Bell's example asserts the moving lengths formula_179 and formula_180 measured in frame formula_181 to be fixed, thereby forcing the rest frame length formula_174 in frame formula_177 to increase.\nAccelerated observer with horizon.\nCertain special relativity problem setups can lead to insight about phenomena normally associated with general relativity, such as event horizons. In the text accompanying Section \"Invariant hyperbola\" of the article Spacetime, the magenta hyperbolae represented paths that are tracked by a constantly accelerating traveler in spacetime. During periods of positive acceleration, the traveler's velocity just \"approaches\" the speed of light, while, measured in our frame, the traveler's acceleration constantly decreases.\nFig.\u00a07-6 details various features of the traveler's motions with more specificity. At any given moment, her space axis is formed by a line passing through the origin and her current position on the hyperbola, while her time axis is the tangent to the hyperbola at her position. The velocity parameter formula_184 approaches a limit of one as formula_19 increases. Likewise, formula_186 approaches infinity.\nThe shape of the invariant hyperbola corresponds to a path of constant proper acceleration. This is demonstrable as follows:\nFig.\u00a07-6 illustrates a specific calculated scenario. Terence (A) and Stella (B) initially stand together 100 light\u00a0hours from the origin. Stella lifts off at time 0, her spacecraft accelerating at 0.01\u00a0\"c\" per hour. Every twenty hours, Terence radios updates to Stella about the situation at home (solid green lines). Stella receives these regular transmissions, but the increasing distance (offset in part by time dilation) causes her to receive Terence's communications later and later as measured on her clock, and she \"never\" receives any communications from Terence after 100 hours on his clock (dashed green lines).\nAfter 100 hours according to Terence's clock, Stella enters a dark region. She has traveled outside Terence's timelike future. On the other hand, Terence can continue to receive Stella's messages to him indefinitely. He just has to wait long enough. Spacetime has been divided into distinct regions separated by an \"apparent\" event horizon. So long as Stella continues to accelerate, she can never know what takes place behind this horizon.\nRelativity and unifying electromagnetism.\nTheoretical investigation in classical electromagnetism led to the discovery of wave propagation. Equations generalizing the electromagnetic effects found that finite propagation speed of the E and B fields required certain behaviors on charged particles. The general study of moving charges forms the Li\u00e9nard\u2013Wiechert potential, which is a step towards special relativity.\nThe Lorentz transformation of the electric field of a moving charge into a non-moving observer's reference frame results in the appearance of a mathematical term commonly called the magnetic field. Conversely, the \"magnetic\" field generated by a moving charge disappears and becomes a purely \"electrostatic\" field in a comoving frame of reference. Maxwell's equations are thus simply an empirical fit to special relativistic effects in a classical model of the Universe. As electric and magnetic fields are reference frame dependent and thus intertwined, one speaks of \"electromagnetic\" fields. Special relativity provides the transformation rules for how an electromagnetic field in one inertial frame appears in another inertial frame.\nMaxwell's equations in the 3D form are already consistent with the physical content of special relativity, although they are easier to manipulate in a manifestly covariant form, that is, in the language of tensor calculus.\nTheories of relativity and quantum mechanics.\n\"Special\" relativity can be combined with quantum mechanics to form relativistic quantum mechanics and quantum electrodynamics. How \"general\" relativity and quantum mechanics can be unified is one of the unsolved problems in physics; quantum gravity and a \"theory of everything\", which require a unification including general relativity too, are active and ongoing areas in theoretical research.\nThe early Bohr\u2013Sommerfeld atomic model explained the fine structure of alkali metal atoms using both special relativity and the preliminary knowledge on quantum mechanics of the time.\nIn 1928, Paul Dirac constructed an influential relativistic wave equation, now known as the Dirac equation in his honour, that is fully compatible both with special relativity and with the final version of quantum theory existing after 1926. This equation not only described the intrinsic angular momentum of the electrons called \"spin\", it also led to the prediction of the antiparticle of the electron (the positron), and fine structure could only be fully explained with special relativity. It was the first foundation of \"relativistic quantum mechanics\".\nOn the other hand, the existence of antiparticles leads to the conclusion that relativistic quantum mechanics is not enough for a more accurate and complete theory of particle interactions. Instead, a theory of particles interpreted as quantized fields, called \"quantum field theory\", becomes necessary; in which particles can be created and destroyed throughout space and time.\nStatus.\nSpecial relativity in its Minkowski spacetime is accurate only when the absolute value of the gravitational potential is much less than \"c\"2 in the region of interest. In a strong gravitational field, one must use general relativity. General relativity becomes special relativity at the limit of a weak field. At very small scales, such as at the Planck length and below, quantum effects must be taken into consideration resulting in quantum gravity. But at macroscopic scales and in the absence of strong gravitational fields, special relativity is experimentally tested to extremely high degree of accuracy (10\u221220)\nand thus accepted by the physics community. Experimental results that appear to contradict it are not reproducible and are thus widely believed to be due to experimental errors.\nSpecial relativity is mathematically self-consistent, and it is an organic part of all modern physical theories, most notably quantum field theory, string theory, and general relativity (in the limiting case of negligible gravitational fields).\nNewtonian mechanics mathematically follows from special relativity at small velocities (compared to the speed of light) \u2013 thus Newtonian mechanics can be considered as a special relativity of slow moving bodies. See \"Classical mechanics\" for a more detailed discussion.\nSeveral experiments predating Einstein's 1905 paper are now interpreted as evidence for relativity. Of these it is known Einstein was aware of the Fizeau experiment before 1905, and historians have concluded that Einstein was at least aware of the Michelson\u2013Morley experiment as early as 1899 despite claims he made in his later years that it played no role in his development of the theory.\nParticle accelerators accelerate and measure the properties of particles moving at near the speed of light, where their behavior is consistent with relativity theory and inconsistent with the earlier Newtonian mechanics. These machines would simply not work if they were not engineered according to relativistic principles. In addition, a considerable number of modern experiments have been conducted to test special relativity.

{"id": "26968", "revid": "50841751", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26968", "title": "Saab AB", "text": "Swedish aerospace and defense company\nSaab AB (originally , lit.\u2009'The Swedish Aeroplane Corporation', acronym SAAB), with subsidiaries collectively known as the Saab Group (), is a Swedish aerospace and defence company primarily operating from Sweden. The company is headquartered in Stockholm, but its development and manufacturing operations are undertaken in Link\u00f6ping.\nThe company was formally founded by AB Bofors in 1937, by reforming the aero engine division of company NOHAB (founded in 1930), located in Trollh\u00e4ttan, into a proper aircraft manufacturer. It would soon merge with aircraft manufacturer ASJA (founded in 1931), located in Link\u00f6ping, in 1940, which had its own design bureau and is considered the spiritual predecessor to today's Saab AB. This formed the SAAB-concern, with the factory in Trollh\u00e4ttan becoming \"SAAB/T\" and the factory in Link\u00f6ping (previously ASJA) becoming \"SAAB/L\" and design headquarters.\nFrom 1947, Saab started producing automobiles, the automobile division being spun off as Saab Automobile in 1990, a joint venture with General Motors. The joint venture ended in 2000 when GM took complete ownership. From 1968 onwards the company was in a merger with commercial vehicle manufacturer Scania-Vabis, known as Saab-Scania. The two were de-merged in 1995 by the new owners, Investor AB.\nHistory.\nSvenska Aeroplan Aktiebolaget (SAAB).\nSaab was founded by AB Bofors in 1937 as \"Svenska Aeroplan Aktiebolaget\" (acronym \"SAAB\"; lit.\u2009'The Swedish Aeroplane Corporation'), located in Trollh\u00e4ttan, by reforming the aircraft engine division of engineering company NOHAB (\"Nohab Flygmotorfabrik AB\", lit.\u2009'Nohab Aero engine factory'), which had been acquired by Bofors in 1935. Bofors had in recent years been in development with the Swedish Air Force (SAF) to create aircraft weaponry and ordnance and wanted to create an aircraft manufacturing subortinate which could take a monopoly over the SAF's future aircraft orders, a premise supported by the SAF. At the time, however, there already was a competing company formed with this premise in 1931, by the name of ASJA (\"AB Svenska J\u00e4rnv\u00e4gsverkst\u00e4dernas Aeroplanavdelning\", lit.\u2009'The Swedish Railway workshops Aeroplane department'), located in Link\u00f6ping, which was a successor to Svenska Aero (\"SA\") under Sven Blomberg, head designer of the Svenska Aero Jaktfalken fighter plane. ASJA had solicit Blomberg from Svenska Aero in 1930 and later purchased the company in 1932 along with their portfolio of designs, quickly making them the leading aeroplane manufacturer in Sweden at the time.\nBofors started negotiating with ASJA in 1936 to see if they could enter into a sort of stock sharing consortium lead under a parent company. Such a deal was struck in 1937, with support from the SAF, the parent company being named \"AB F\u00f6renade Flygverkst\u00e4der\" (\"AFF\"). To ease future competition, Bofors bought out small competitor E. Sparmanns aircraft workshop, which at the time was developing a modern fighter for the SAF, under the name of Sparmann E4.\nDespite the consortium, SAAB in Trollh\u00e4ttan (previously Nohab Flygmotorfabrik AB) still had to compete with ASJA over contracts and the cooperation never came to fruition. While SAAB in Trollh\u00e4ttan got a few contracts, such as license producing the Junkers Ju 86 bomber for the Swedish Air Force (SAF designation \"B 3\") in 1938, ASJA won most of the contracts from the SAF, such as license production of the Hawker Hart (\"B 4\") and Northrop Model 8 (\"B 5\"). After ASJA's design bureau produced the winning designs for what eventually became the Saab 17 (ASJA L-10) and Saab 18 (ASJA L-11), beating out AFF/SAAB's competing F.1 and G.1 designs, it was decided in March 1939 to scrap AFF and formally reform ASJA into the SAAB-concern, the Trollh\u00e4ttan factory (previously Nohab) becoming \"SAAB/T\" and the Link\u00f6ping factory (previous ASJA) becoming \"SAAB/L\", the latter becoming headquarters.\nThe basic initial development was the problems for the Swedish government to get quality military aircraft delivered at the beginning of the Second World War. The final trigger was the inability to get a large number of Seversky P-35 delivered from the United States. From then on the Swedish government focused on establishing domestic production and development of military aircraft which Saab became involved in, a policy that has continued to this day. The first SAAB-developed aircraft was the SAAB 17 light dive bomber (first flight: 1940-05-18), soon followed by the SAAB 18 schnellbomber (first flight: 1942-06-19) and SAAB 21 single-seat fighter (first flight: 1943-07-30), among other developments, the latter being the first aircraft to see service with a modern style ejection seat, using gunpowder to eject instead of compressed air like the contemporary German counterparts.\nOriginally manufacturing aircraft, the company sought ways in which to diversify its business. Before the Second World War, a majority of cars in Sweden were imported from the United States. The US car manufacturers were producing tanks during the war, and the US domestic market took all the US car production in the late 1940s. Hence there was a large supply shortage of private cars in Europe and Sweden, and buyers were facing waiting lists for years for new cars. In the late 1940s, Saab began manufacturing cars at its Saab Automobile division, based in Trollh\u00e4ttan. The first car was the Saab 92; full-scale production started 12 December 1949, based on the prototype Ursaab. Around 1950 the style \"Saab\" started being used instead of the all caps \"SAAB\".\nIn the late 1950s Saab ventured into the computer market with Datasaab. The company was a result partly of the need to make a computer that would be small enough to mount in an aeroplane as navigational equipment. During the 1960s several computers were developed and sold to European countries, for uses such as banking. The aircraft computer (CK 37) was used in 1971 in the Viggen. The company was sold in 1975 to Sperry UNIVAC, while Saab retained its flight computer development.\nSaab AB.\nIn May 1965, the company name was changed to Saab AB to reflect its broad range of activities.\nIn 1968 Saab AB merged with the Swedish lorry, bus and heavy-duty diesel engine manufacturer Scania-Vabis, and became Saab-Scania AB.\nIn 1990 General Motors bought 51% of the car division Saab Automobile, and acquired the rest a decade later.\nIn 1991 Investor AB completed a leveraged buyout of Saab-Scania AB. Investor AB acquired all the outstanding shares in Saab-Scania for approximately SEK 21 billion. Saab-Scania became a wholly owned subsidiary of Investor AB and the company was de-listed.\nIn 1995 Saab-Scania was divided by Investor AB into two independent companies, de-merging into Scania AB and Saab AB. The intention by Investor AB was to broaden ownership in the two companies later. Following the sale of 50% of the car division Saab Automobile AB to General Motors, the main reason behind the merger with lorry manufacturer Scania-Vabis in 1968 had disappeared.\nAlso in 1995 Saab Military Aircraft and British Aerospace (now BAE Systems) formed the joint venture company Saab-BAe Gripen AB, to manufacture, market and support Gripen internationally. This co-operation was extended in 2001 with the formation of Gripen International for the same purpose. From 1998 until 2005, British Aerospace/BAE was the largest shareholder in Saab following its acquisition of a 35% stake from Investor AB. In January 2005, BAE Systems reduced its shareholding to 20%. Investor AB maintained a 20% share.\nOn 16 November 1999, Saab announced its intention is to purchase Celsius AB and the acquisition was concluded by early March 2000.\nIn September 2000 United Defense Industries (UDI) purchased Bofors Weapon Systems from Saab (the autocannon and tube artillery interests), while Saab retained the missile interests.\nIn December 2005 Saab joined the Dassault nEUROn project as a major partner.\nIn October 2008 the company announced its intention to merge its operations with that of Simrad Optronics. The new unit will develop high-tech optronics products and will be headquartered in Norway, although other details of the new arrangement have not been finalized.\nIn 2010 the company restructured from fifteen business units into five business areas; Aeronautics, Dynamics, Electronic Defence Systems, Security and Defence Solutions, and Support and Services. According to Saab the restructuring was undertaken to become more market and customer oriented.\nIn March 2010, BAE Systems sold half of its 20% stake in the company to Investor AB, which then became the major shareholder. In June 2011, the British company sold its remaining stake bringing its 16-year involvement in Saab to an end.\nAs of August 2020, Investor AB owns a 30.16% stake in the company (39.69% of the voting rights) and is the top owner.\nIn August 2023, it was announced Saab had acquired the Bedford, UK\u2013based manufacturer of AI-enabled autonomous swarm systems, Blue Bear Research Systems.\nIn September 2023, it was announced Saab had acquired the San Francisco\u2013headquartered artificial intelligence / machine learning development company CrowdAI.\nAircraft production.\nThe main focus of aircraft production is fighter aircraft. Saab has been making aircraft since the 1930s, and the jet predecessors of the JAS 39 Gripen were the Tunnan, the Lansen, the Draken and the Viggen. The last civilian models made by Saab were the Saab 340 and Saab 2000. Both were mid-range turboprop-powered airliners. The development and the manufacturing of these aircraft is undertaken in Link\u00f6ping.\nIn May 2019, Saab announced plans to locate a new U.S. manufacturing operation in Discovery Park District Aerospace on the west side of the Purdue University campus. The facility will do the final assembly of the T-X advanced jet trainer, which is a plane developed by Boeing and Saab for the United States Air Force.\nOrganization.\nAeronautics.\nAeronautics offers airborne systems, related subsystems, Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) and aerostructures. The business area Aeronautics is responsible for airframe structures for JAS 39 Gripen, and whole sections for Airbus, Boeing and NH90; &amp; system development of the JAS 39 Gripen and the Skeldar VTOL UAV. Aeronautics is also partner in the European joint UAV-project Dassault nEUROn, where Saab develop avionics and is responsible for the overall architecture and design. Marketing and support of the JAS 39 Gripen fighter jet is also included in the Aeronautics business area.\nDynamics.\nDynamics offers ground combat weapons, missile systems, torpedoes, sensor systems, unmanned underwater vehicles such as \"Sabertooth\" and signature management systems, remotely operated vehicles for armed forces as well as civil security applications.\nShort range weapons offered include the Carl Gustaf, AT4/AT4 CS, STRIX and NLAW. Missile systems offered are the RBS 70, RBS 23 and RBS 15.\nSurveillance.\nSurveillance offers airborne surveillance (including GlobalEye, Saab 2000 Erieye) AEW&amp;C and fighter radar, ground-based and naval radar (including the Giraffe radar range), electronic warfare (including IDAS and ESTL) and combat systems and C4I.\nIndustrial Products and Services.\nIndustrial Products and Services was established on 1 January 2015 and comprises the business units Combitech, Avionics Systems, Aerostructures, Traffic Management, Vricon as well as the development of product ideas that fall outside of Saab's core business.\nThe business units within Industrial Products and Services differ from Saab's other operations by their focus on business-to-business (B2B) customers or because they are not dependent on Saab's principal end-customers. Other business areas within Saab have a customer base largely consisting of public authorities. With different customer groups come different management strategies and priorities. Opportunities to strengthen these operations in the long term are greater in the new organisation. Industrial Products and Services will work with individual growth strategies for each business unit.\nSupport and Services.\nSupport and Services offer maintenance, integrated support, field facilities, logistics and regional aircraft maintenance.\nSaab Aircraft Leasing leases and resells Saab aircraft to airlines. It completed 30 transactions in 2010.\nSaab Barracuda LLC.\nThe Saab Barracuda LLC facility in Lillington, North Carolina, manufactures signature management products and provides customized services. Foremost among the camouflage, concealment and deception products is the Ultra Lightweight Camouflage Net System (ULCANS) which provides multi-spectral protection against visual, near infrared, thermal infrared and broadband radar detection. ULCANS is fielded with the U.S. Army and other Department of Defense organizations and is available in both woodland and desert versions. Saab Barracuda is one of only two qualified suppliers of ULCANS in North America, and currently has a competed US$1.76 billion contract, along with GMA Cover Corp.\nSaab Kockums.\nThe Kockums shipyard is the base for the company's submarine division.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

(), often shortened to \u0160koda, is a Czech automobile manufacturer established in 1925 as the successor to Laurin &amp; Klement and headquartered in Mlad\u00e1 Boleslav, Czech Republic. \u0160koda Works became state owned in 1948. After the Velvet Revolution, it was gradually privatized starting in 1991, eventually becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of the German multinational conglomerate Volkswagen Group in 2000.\n\u0160koda automobiles are sold in over 100 countries, and in 2018, total global sales reached 1.25 million units, an increase of 4.4% from the previous year. The operating profit was \u20ac1.6 billion in 2017, an increase of 34.6% over the previous year. As of 2017, \u0160koda's profit margin was the second-highest of all Volkswagen AG brands after Porsche.\nHistory.\nThe \u0160koda Works was founded by Czech engineer Emil von \u0160koda in 1859 in Plze\u0148, then in the Kingdom of Bohemia in the Austrian Empire, and was originally an arms manufacturer. It was one of the largest European industrial conglomerates in the 20th century, and is the predecessor of today's \u0160koda Auto, Doosan \u0160koda Power, and \u0160koda Transportation companies. Although \u0160koda is named after its founder, the word \"\u0161koda\" also means \"pity\" or \"shame\" in Czech.\nLaurin &amp; Klement.\nAs with many long-established car manufacturers, the company that became \u0160koda Auto started by manufacturing bicycles. \u0160koda (then Laurin &amp; Klement) was founded in 1896 as a velocipede manufacturer.\nIn 1894 ( )\u00a0(1894), 26-year-old V\u00e1clav Klement (1868\u20131938), who was a bookseller in Mlad\u00e1 Boleslav, Kingdom of Bohemia (today's Czech Republic, then part of Austria-Hungary), was unable to obtain spare parts to repair his German bicycle. Klement returned his bicycle to the manufacturers, Seidel and Naumann, with a letter, in Czech, asking them to carry out repairs, only to receive a reply, in German: \"If you want us to answer you, we insist that you convey your message in a language we understand.\" Not satisfied with the reply and realizing the business potential, Klement, despite having no technical experience, decided to start a bicycle repair shop, which he and V\u00e1clav Laurin opened in 1896 in Mlad\u00e1 Boleslav. Before going into partnership with Klement, Laurin had been an established bicycle manufacturer in the nearby town of Turnov.\nIn 1898, after moving to their newly built factory, the pair bought a Werner \"Motocyclette\". Laurin &amp; Klement's first motorcyclette, powered by an engine mounted on the handlebars driving the front wheels, proved dangerous and unreliable \u2013 an early accident on it cost Laurin a front tooth. To design a safer machine with its structure around the engine, the pair wrote to German ignition specialist Robert Bosch for advice on a different electromagnetic system. Their new Slavia motorcycle made its debut in 1899, and the company became the first motorcycle factory in Central Europe. In 1900, with a company workforce of 32, Slavia exports began and 150 machines were shipped to London for the Hewtson firm. Shortly afterwards, the press credited them as makers of the first motorcycle.\nBy 1905, the firm was manufacturing automobiles, making it the second-oldest car manufacturer in the Czech lands after Tatra. The company, with an area of , had a workforce of 320 and used 170 special machine tools, power-driven by of steam power. The first model, Voiturette A, was a success, and the company was established both within Austria-Hungary and internationally.\n\u0160koda.\nAfter World War I, the Laurin &amp; Klement company began producing trucks, but in 1924, after running into problems and being affected by a fire on their premises, the company sought a new partner.\nMeanwhile, \"Akciov\u00e1 spole\u010dnost, d\u0159\u00edve \u0160kodovy z\u00e1vody\" (Limited Company, formerly the \u0160koda Works), an arms manufacturer and multisector concern in Plze\u0148, which had become one of the largest industrial enterprises in Europe and the largest in Czechoslovakia, sought to enlarge its non-arms-manufacturing base, so it acquired Laurin &amp; Klement in 1925. It also started manufacturing cars in cooperation with Hispano-Suiza. Most of the later production took place under \u0160koda's name.\nAn assembly line was used for production from 1930 onwards. Also in 1930, a formal spin-off of the car became a new company, \"Akciov\u00e1 spole\u010dnost pro automobilov\u00fd pr\u016fmysl\" or abbreviated \"ASAP\", happened. ASAP remained a wholly owned subsidiary of the \u0160koda Works, and continued to sell cars under the \u0160koda marque. Apart from the factory in Mlad\u00e1 Boleslav, it also included the firm's representation, sales offices, and services, as well as a central workshop in Prague. At the time, the car factory in Mlad\u00e1 Boleslav covered an area of 215,000 m2 and employed 3,750 blue-collar and 500 white-collar workers.\nIn 1932, ASAP-\u0160koda in Mlad\u00e1 Boleslav, Bohemia, produced a type \u0160koda 932 prototype of a streamlined 4-seater two-door car with a rear air-cooled flat-four engine designed by Karel Hrdli\u010dka and Vsevold Korolkov. This car's bodywork closely resembled the small car designs yet to come.\nAfter a decline caused by the economic depression, \u0160koda introduced a new line of cars in the 1930s, which significantly differed from its previous products. A new design of chassis with backbone tube and all-around independent suspension was developed under the leadership of chief engineer Vladim\u00edr Matou\u0161 and modelled on the one first introduced by Hans Ledwinka in Tatra. First used on model \u0160koda 420 Standard in 1933, it aimed at solving the insufficient torsional stiffness of the ladder frame.\nThe new design of chassis became the basis for models Popular (845\u20131,089 cc), Rapid (1,165\u20131,766 cc), Favorit (1,802\u20132,091 cc), and Superb (2,492\u20133,991 cc). While in 1933 \u0160koda had a 14% share of the Czechoslovak car market and occupied third place behind Praga and Tatra, the new line made it a market leader by 1936, with a 39% share in 1938.\nWorld War II.\nDuring the occupation of Czechoslovakia in World War II, the \u0160koda Works were turned into part of the \"Reichswerke Hermann G\u00f6ring\" serving the Nazi German war effort by producing components for military terrain vehicles, military planes, other weapons components, and cartridge cases. Vehicle output decreased from 7,052 in 1939 to 683 in 1944, of which only 35 were passenger cars. Between January and May 1945, 316 trucks were produced. The UK and US air forces bombed the \u0160koda works repeatedly between 1940 and 1945. The final massive air raid took place on 25 April 1945, and resulted in the near-complete destruction of the \u0160koda armament works and about 1,000 dead or wounded.\nPost World War II.\nWhen, by July 1945, the Mlad\u00e1 Boleslav factory had been reconstructed, production of \u0160koda's first post-World War II car, the 1101 series, began. It was essentially an updated version of the pre-World War II \u0160koda Popular. In the autumn of 1948, \u0160koda (along with all other large manufacturers) became part of the communist planned economy, which meant it was separated from the parent company, \u0160koda Works. Despite unfavourable political conditions and losing contact with technical development in noncommunist countries, \u0160koda retained a good reputation until the 1960s, producing models such as the \u0160koda 440 Spartak, 445 Octavia, Felicia, and \u0160koda 1000 MB.\nStarting in 1957, the \u0160koda Octavia, and later the Felicia, were imported to the United States amid a wave of new imports as some American consumers sought out cars smaller than typical Detroit offerings. \u0160koda\u2019s American dealerships, concentrated on the West Coast and in the Northeast, quickly encountered buyer resistance due to the Cold War political climate in ways that comparable Western European cars did not. The cars were also not well supported after sale, making even minor repairs difficult. U.S. sales peaked in 1959 but fell sharply after 1960, and many were sold at steep discounts. A few later cars, including 1000MB models, were sold in the U.S. as late as 1966-67, but in very small numbers. \u0160koda has not sold vehicles in the U.S. since then, but did sell cars in Canada from 1984 to 1990.\nIn the late 1980s, \u0160koda (then named \"Automobilov\u00e9 z\u00e1vody, n\u00e1rodn\u00ed podnik\" or abbreviated \"AZNP\") was still manufacturing cars that conceptually dated back to the 1960s, and in Western Europe at least, were aimed squarely at the budget end of the market. Rear-engined models such as the \u0160koda 105/120 (Estelle) and Rapid sold steadily and performed well against more modern makes in races such as the RAC Rally in the 1970s and 1980s. They won their class in the RAC rally for 17 years running. They were powered by a , engine. Despite its dated image and becoming the subject of negative jokes, what do you call a \u0160koda with a sunroof? A skip!\u2013\u0160kodas remained a common sight on the roads of the United Kingdom and Western Europe throughout the 1970s and 1980s.\nSport versions of the Estelle and earlier models were produced, using the name \"Rapid\" (originally sold as the Garde in some markets). Soft-top versions were also available. The Rapid was once described as the \"poor man's Porsche\", and had significant sales success in the UK during the 1980s.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;To drivers in the UK, the vehicles which chugged off \u0160koda's production line in Pilsen, Czechoslovakia, embodied all that was wrong with the planned economies of the Soviet satellite states. Of course, the \u0160koda became such a figure of fun in part due to its ubiquity on Britain's roads. The company must have been doing something right.\nIn 1987, the Favorit was introduced, and was one of a trio of compact front-wheel drive hatchbacks from the three main Eastern Bloc manufacturers around that time, the others being VAZ's Lada Samara and Zastava's Yugo Sana. The Favorit's appearance was the work of Italian design company Bertone. With some motor technology licensed from Western Europe, but still using the \u0160koda-designed 1289\u00a0cc engine, \u0160koda engineers designed a car comparable to Western production. The technological gap still existed, but began closing rapidly. The Favorit was very popular in Czechoslovakia and other Eastern Bloc countries. It also sold well in Western Europe, especially in the UK and Denmark, due to its low price, and was regarded as solid and reliable. However, it was perceived as having poor value compared with contemporary Western European designs. The Favorit's trim levels were improved, and it continued to be sold until the introduction of the Felicia in 1994.\nVolkswagen Group subsidiary.\nUntil 1990, \u0160koda was still making its outdated range of rear-engined small family cars, although it had started production of the Favorit front-wheel drive hatchback in 1987 as an eventual replacement.\nThe fall of communism with the Velvet Revolution brought great changes to Czechoslovakia, and most industries were subject to privatization. In the case of \u0160koda Automobile, the state authorities brought in a strong foreign partner. The tender for privatization was announced in 1990; 24 different companies were registered for the tender, while only eight of them expressed a serious interest \u2013 BMW, GM, Renault, Volvo, Volkswagen, Ford, Fiat, and Mercedes-Benz. In August 1990, VW and Renault were on the shortlist. Renault first offered to terminate Favorit production and replace it with the outdated Renault 18 derivative and new Renault Twingo, which would have eliminated the \u0160koda brand. This offer was declined, and Renault prepared a new one. They offered a 60:40 joint venture (40% share of Renault), while \u0160koda Favorit production was to be retained and produced side by side with the Renault 19, and producing engine units, gearboxes, and other components for Renault. Total investment would have been US$2.6 billion (US$ billion in 2019).\nVolkswagen offered to continue Favorit production and preserve the \u0160koda brand, including retention of research and development. Volkswagen offered a purchase of 30% \u0160koda share, gradually increasing to 70%. Volkswagen's total investment would have been US$6.6 billion (US$ billion in 2019) by 2000. The government inclined on the Renault side, while the \u0160koda trade union preferred VW, because it offered significantly larger potential for development of the company.\nVolkswagen was chosen by the Czech government on 9 December 1990, and as a result, on 28 March 1991 a joint-venture partnership agreement with Volkswagen took place, marked by the transfer of a 30% share to the Volkswagen Group on 16 April 1991, raised later on 19 December 1994 to 60.3% and the year after, on 11 December 1995, to 70% of its shares, to make VW the largest and controlling shareholder of \u0160koda. On 30 May 2000, Volkswagen AG bought the remaining 30% of the company, thus making \u0160koda Auto a wholly owned subsidiary of the group. Backed by Volkswagen Group expertise and investments, the design\u2013both style and engineering\u2013has improved greatly. The 1994 model Felicia was effectively a reskin of the Favorit, but quality and equipment improvements helped, and in the Czech Republic, the car was perceived as a good value for money and became popular. Sales improved across Europe, including the United Kingdom, where the Felicia was one of the highest-ranking cars in customer satisfaction surveys.\nVolkswagen AG chairman Ferdinand Pi\u00ebch personally chose Dirk van Braeckel as head of design, and the subsequent Octavia and Fabia models made their way to the demanding European Union markets. They are built on common Volkswagen Group floorpans. The Fabia, launched at the end of 1999, formed the basis for later versions of the Volkswagen Polo and SEAT Ibiza, while the Octavia, launched in 1996, has shared its floorpan with a host of cars, the most popular of which is the Volkswagen Golf Mk4.\nThe perception of \u0160koda in Western Europe has completely changed since the takeover by VW, in stark comparison with the reputation of the cars throughout the 1980s described by some as \"the laughing stock\" of the automotive world. As technical development progressed and attractive new models were marketed, \u0160koda's image was initially slow to improve. In the UK, a major change was achieved with the ironic \"It is a \u0160koda, honest\" campaign, which began in 2000 when the Fabia was launched. In a 2003 advertisement on British television, a new employee on the production line is fitting \u0160koda badges on the car bonnets. When some attractive-looking cars come along, he stands back, not fitting the badge, since they look so good they \"cannot be \u0160kodas\". This market campaign worked by confronting \u0160koda's image problem head-on \u2013 a tactic which marketing professionals regarded as high risk. By 2005, \u0160koda was selling over 30,000 cars a year in the UK, a market share of over 1%. For the first time in its UK history, a waiting list developed for deliveries from \u0160koda. UK owners have consistently ranked the brand at or near the top of customer-satisfaction surveys since the late 1990s.\nIn 1991, \u0160koda built 172,000 units, exporting 26% of its production to 30 countries, while in 2000, it built 435,000 units, exporting 82% of its production to 72 countries.\nGrowth strategy.\nOne of the most important years for \u0160koda Auto was 2010, in terms of both products and management. On 1 September 2010, Prof. Dr. H.C. Winfried Vahland assumed responsibility for the management of the company, becoming the CEO of \u0160koda Auto. In the same year, \u0160koda set forth plans to double the company's annual sales to at least 1.5 million by 2018 (later known as the 'Growth Strategy', ).\nAt the 2010 Paris Motor Show in September 2010, the company unveiled the Octavia Green E Line. This e-car concept was the forerunner to the e-car test fleet that \u0160koda released in 2012. The final first-generation Octavia (Tour) was produced at the Mlad\u00e1 Boleslav plant in November 2010. The worldwide production of this model has exceeded 1.4 million units since its release in 1996. In 2010, for the first time in history, China overtook Germany in sales to become \u0160koda's largest individual market. In 2011, \u0160koda Auto celebrated its 20-year partnership with the Volkswagen Group. More than 75,000 visitors attended an open-house event held in Mlad\u00e1 Boleslav in April. Earlier that year, the company provided details on its 2018 Growth Strategy: for at least one new or completely revised model to be released every six months. With this in mind, the company redesigned its logo and CI, which was presented at the 2011 Geneva Motor Show. \u0160koda's main attraction at the event was the Vision\"D\" design concept, a forerunner to the future third-generation Octavia. \u0160koda presented the Mission\"L\" design study at the IAA in Frankfurt am Main in September, which was to become the basis of the company's forthcoming compact model, the European Rapid.\nIn the same year, the company started production of the new Rapid model in Pune, India (October 2011), and launched the \u0160koda Citigo at Volkswagen's Bratislava plant (November 2011). In 2012, \u0160koda introduced two new mass production models. The European version of the Rapid premiered at the Paris Motor Show. This car was a successor to the first-generation Octavia in terms of its price bracket. The second model was the third-generation Octavia, which premiered in December 2012. In the same month, local production of the Yeti was launched at the Nizhny Novgorod GAZ factory.\nIn 2012, \u0160koda introduced an emission-free (on the street) fleet of Octavia Green E Line e-cars on Czech roads to be used by external partners. Since internal tests on the fleet in late 2011, the e-fleet had driven more than 250,000\u00a0km. During the same year, \u0160koda celebrated several milestones, including 14 million \u0160koda cars being produced since 1905 (January), three million Fabias (May), 500,000 Superbs at the Kvasiny plant (June), and 5 years of \u0160koda operations in China.\nMassive rejuvenation of the model range was a major tune for 2013 at \u0160koda: The Czech car maker launched the third-generation Octavia Combi and Octavia RS (both liftback and estate), as well as facelifted Superb and Superb Combi. They were accompanied by brand new members of the Rapid family as the Rapid Spaceback, the first \u0160koda hatchback car in the compact segment, and the Chinese version of the Rapid. The Yeti also faced significant changes. With the facelift, two design variants of \u0160koda's compact SUV are now available, the city-oriented Yeti and rugged Yeti Outdoor. Chinese customers were also given a Yeti with an extended wheelbase.\nIn 2015, Volkswagen admitted that it had installed pollution-cheating software in many of its cars to fool regulators that its cars met emissions standards, when in fact they polluted at much higher levels than government standards. About 1.2 million \u0160koda cars worldwide were fitted with this emissions-cheating device. \u0160koda said that Volkswagen would recall and cover refitting costs for all of the cars affected by the scandal. In 2015, \u0160koda was voted the most reliable car brand in the UK. A corporate strategy was launched in 2015 to produce a range of all-electric cars from 2019.\n\u0160koda Auto began manufacturing the large, seven-seat SUV \u0160koda Kodiaq in 2016, it was introduced at the Paris Motor Show in October 2016, and sales began at early 2017. In the second half of 2017, sales began of the new compact SUV \u0160koda Karoq, which officially replaced the \u0160koda Yeti. The automaker introduced in December 2018 a new small family car, the \u0160koda Scala. In February 2019, the company introduced in Geneva the new subcompact crossover \u0160koda Kamiq.\nElectrification strategy.\nIn 2015, new \u0160koda chairman Bernhard Maier said that the Volkswagen Group \"is working on a modular, new electric platform and we are in the team\", and \"there is no alternative to electrification.\" New \u0160koda corporate \"Strategy 2025\", which replaces the previous \"Strategy 2018\", aims to start production of a fully electric vehicle in 2020, and five electric models across different segments by 2025.\nAt Auto Shanghai in 2017, \u0160koda displayed its Vision E concept for an all-electric 300-bhp coup\u00e9-SUV, with level 3 autonomy capability and range. It is based on the VW MEB platform and \u0160koda Auto will also manufacture electric-vehicle batteries for the Volkswagen Group in its facility in the Czech Republic. The second development stage, the \u0160koda Vision iV, was revealed in March 2019.\nA plug-in hybrid car, the \u0160koda Superb iV, was available for sale from early 2020, and a small SUV model \u0160koda Kamiq with a natural gas-electric hybrid powertrain and a hybrid Fabia from later the same year. By March 2018, the electrification plan was expanded to 10 electrified models for 2025 - six fully electric cars and four plug-in-hybrids. Out of these, five models are to be available by 2020. In 2018, the brand launched its largest-ever investment plan of \u20ac2 billion over five years into its electrification.\nThe brand's first fully electric car, a city car \u0160koda Citigo-e iV, was sold from 2019 to 2020. The all-electric \u0160koda Enyaq iV is available for sale since September 2020. The \u0160koda Enyaq Coup\u00e9 has been from May 2023.\nSales and markets.\n\u0160koda has maintained sound financial stability over recent years. In 2013, the brand achieved sales revenues totalling \u20ac10.3 billion (2012: \u20ac10.4 billion). Due to the weak economic situation in many European countries and the expansion of the model range, operating profit reached a modest \u20ac522 million (2012: \u20ac712 million). \u0160koda achieved a successful start to 2014. As well as recording the highest number of deliveries to customers in a first quarter ever (247,200; up 12.1%), it recorded a significant increase in sales revenue (23.7%) to almost \u20ac3 billion. Operating profit increased 65.2% to \u20ac185 million over the previous year.\nMarkets.\nAs of August 2016, \u0160koda is being sold in 102 countries. In 2022, the top markets for \u0160koda by number of sales were Germany (134,260), Czech Republic (71,152), India (51,865), Great Britain (49,555) and Poland (44,985). In the Asia-Pacific region, \u0160koda is also being sold in Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan and Brunei. \u0160koda is also planning to expand into Iran, where imports are to be started from 2018 and production of vehicles by 2020. Expansion strategy also includes Singapore.\nProduction.\n\u0160koda cars are made in factories in the Czech Republic (635,213 cars), India (55,750 cars), China (41,936 cars), and Slovakia (16,116 cars). A smaller number of \u0160koda models are additionally manufactured in Solomonovo, Ukraine through local partner. Until 2020, there was manufacturing in \u00d6skemen, Kazazhstan. Cars were also built in two locations in Russia; however, this ended following the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022. This table lists the factories and their production models in 2019.\nMotorsport.\nThe \u0160koda brand has been engaged in motor sport since 1901, and has gained several titles with various vehicles around the world. The team had competed as a manufacturer in the Intercontinental Rally Challenge (before it merged with ERC in 2013) and World Rally Championship between 1999 and 2005. Now it competes in the European Rally Championship and WRC-2.\nUntil the final season of IRC in 2012, \u0160koda Motorsport was the most successful manufacturer with a total of 27 points, winning the rallying series in 2010\u20132012. Since 2013, when the two competing series were merged, it has continued to compete in the European Rally Championship.\n\u0160koda Motorsport drivers won with the \u0160koda Fabia S2000 the European Rally Championships in 2012\u20132014.\nWorld Rally Championship.\nAfter a long history of class victories in lower levels of motorsport, \u0160koda became a participant in the FIA World Rally Championship in the 1999 season, with World Rally Car models of the \u0160koda Octavia. \u0160koda's best result with the Octavia WRC was Armin Schwarz's third place at the 2001 Safari Rally. From mid 2003, the Octavia was replaced by the smaller \u0160koda Fabia. \u0160koda used the 2004 season to develop the car further, but did not achieve much success in the following season. However, at the season-ending Rally Australia, 1995 world champion Colin McRae was running second before retiring. \u0160koda then withdrew from the series, and the 2006 season saw \u0160koda represented by the semi-privateer Red Bull \u0160koda Team. Jan Kopeck\u00fd drove the Fabia WRC to fifth place at the Rally Catalunya, and as late as the 2007 Rallye Deutschland the Fabia still achieved a fifth-place result, again in the hands of Kopeck\u00fd. Former works Ford and Citroen driver Fran\u00e7ois Duval also drove a Fabia WRC in 2006 for the privateer First Motorsport team, achieving a sixth-place finish in Catalunya.\nWRC2.\nIn 2009, \u0160koda entered the Intercontinental Rally Challenge (IRC) for the first time, using the Fabia S2000, winning three rallies and finishing second in both the drivers and manufacturers' championships. In 2010, \u0160koda won a total of seven IRC events, winning both the manufacturers' and driver championships for Juho H\u00e4nninen. These achievements were repeated in the following two seasons, with Andreas Mikkelsen as the driver's champion. In 2013, the Intercontinental Rally Challenge was merged with the European Rally Championship (ERC), and the team gained the drivers' championship title once again for Jan Kopeck\u00fd. The car was also raced by privateers in several championships, including Red Bull, Barwa, Rene Georges, and Rufa in the 2010 Super 2000 World Rally Championship.\n\u0160koda Motorsport won the 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018 WRC-2 championships with \u0160koda Fabia R5.\nBonneville Speedway.\nIn August 2011, a special \u0160koda Octavia vRS set a world record at the Bonneville Speedway and became the fastest production car in the world with an engine up to two litres, when it hit . The current fastest production \u0160koda car is the \u0160koda Superb III, with a top speed of and an acceleration from in 5.8 seconds.\nLogo.\nIn 1923, two different trademarks were registered at the Office for Innovation and Model Registration in Plze\u0148. The first depicted a winged arrow pointing to the right with five feathers in a circle and the second was a winged arrow with three feathers. The famous winged arrow with three feathers still forms the \u0160koda logo today. The \"\u0160KODA\" text was added to the logo in 1936. The arrow represents speed, the wings progress and freedom, the eye precision, and the circle unity, completeness, world, and harmony. The story goes that, on his travels through the US, Emil \u0160koda had once been so taken with a Native American's feathered headdress that he had returned to Plze\u0148 with a relief image which inspired the logo.\nExplanatory notes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "26972", "revid": "41906662", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26972", "title": "Scandinavian Peninsula", "text": "Land mass in Northern Europe\nThe Scandinavian Peninsula is located in Northern Europe, and roughly comprises the mainlands of Sweden, Norway and the northwestern area of Finland. It is the largest of the peninsulas of Europe, with a greater area than the Balkan, Iberian and Italian peninsulas. \nThe name of the peninsula is derived from the term Scandinavia, the cultural region of Denmark, Norway and Sweden. That cultural name is in turn derived from the name of Scania, the region at the southern extremity of the peninsula which was for centuries a part of Denmark, which was the ancestral home of the Danes, and is now part of Sweden.\nDuring the Ice Ages, the sea level of the Atlantic Ocean dropped so much that the Baltic Sea, the Gulf of Bothnia and the Gulf of Finland disappeared, and the countries now surrounding them, including Germany, Poland, the other Baltic countries and Scandinavia, were directly joined by land. In the modern era, the peninsula has been secluded from much of Europe with its land connection as far north as the Arctic Circle. Locals of the region, and historic Germanic philology, view it as a separate entity not a part of Mainland Europe, which they refer to as \"the Continent\".\nGeography.\nThe largest peninsula in Europe, the Scandinavian Peninsula is approximately long with a width varying approximately from . The Scandinavian mountain range generally defines the border between Norway and Sweden.\nIts highest elevation was Glittertinden in Norway at above sea level, but since the glacier at its summit partially melted, the highest elevation is at at Galdh\u00f8piggen, also in Norway. These mountains also have the largest glacier on the mainland of Europe, Jostedalsbreen.\nAbout one quarter of the Scandinavian Peninsula lies north of the Arctic Circle, its northernmost point being at Cape Nordkyn, Norway.\nThe climate across Scandinavia varies from tundra (K\u00f6ppen: ET) and subarctic (Dfc) in the north, with cool marine west coast climate (Cfc) in northwestern coastal areas reaching just north of Lofoten, to humid continental (Dfb) in the central portion and marine west coast (Cfb) in the south and southwest.\nThe region is rich in timber, iron and copper with the best farmland in southern Sweden. Large petroleum and natural-gas deposits have been found off Norway's coast in the North Sea and the Atlantic Ocean.\nMuch of the population of the Scandinavian Peninsula is naturally concentrated in its southern part, which is also its agricultural region. The largest cities of the peninsula are Stockholm, Sweden; Oslo, Norway; Gothenburg, Sweden; Malm\u00f6, Sweden and Bergen, Norway, in that order.\nGeology.\nThe Scandinavian Peninsula occupies part of the Baltic Shield, a stable and large crust segment formed of very old, crystalline metamorphic rocks. Most of the soil covering this substrate was scraped by glaciers during the Ice Ages of antiquity, As a consequence of this scouring, the elevation of the land, and the cool-to-cold climate, a relatively small percentage of its land is arable.\nThe glaciation during the Ice Ages also deepened many of the river valleys, which were invaded by the sea when the ice melted, creating the noteworthy fjords of Norway. In the southern part of the peninsula, the glaciers deposited vast numbers of terminal moraines, configuring a very chaotic landscape. These terminal moraines covered all of what is now Denmark.\nAlthough the Baltic Shield is mostly geologically stable and hence resistant to the influences of other neighbouring tectonic formations, the weight of nearly four kilometres of ice during the Ice Ages caused all of the Scandinavian terrain to sink. When the ice sheet disappeared, the shield rose again, a tendency that continues to this day at a rate of about one metre per century. Conversely, the southern part has tended to sink to compensate, causing flooding of the Low Countries and Denmark.\nThe crystalline substrate of the land and absence of soil in many places have exposed mineral deposits of metal ores, such as those of iron, copper, nickel, zinc, silver and gold. The very most valuable of these have been the deposits of iron ore in northwestern Sweden. In the 19th century these deposits prompted the building of a railway from northwestern Sweden to the Norwegian seaport of Narvik so that the iron ore could be exported by ship to places like southern Sweden, Germany, Great Britain and Belgium for smelting into iron and steel. This railway is in a region of Norway and Sweden that otherwise does not have any railways because of the very rugged terrain, mountains and fjords of that part of Scandinavia.\nPeople.\nThe first recorded human presence in the southern area of the peninsula and Denmark dates from 12,000 years ago. As the ice sheets from the glaciation retreated, the climate allowed a tundra biome that attracted reindeer hunters. The climate warmed up gradually, favouring the growth of evergreen trees first and then deciduous forest which brought animals like aurochs. Groups of hunter-fisher-gatherers started to inhabit the area from the Mesolithic (8200 BC), up to the advent of agriculture in the Neolithic (3200 BC).\nThe northern and central part of the peninsula is partially inhabited by the Sami, who began to arrive several thousand years after the Scandinavian Peninsula had already been inhabited in the south. In the earliest recorded periods they occupied the arctic and subarctic regions as well as the central part of the peninsula as far south as Dalarna, Sweden. They speak the Sami language, a non-Indo-European language of the Uralic family which is related to Finnish and Estonian. The first inhabitants of the peninsula were the Norwegians on the west coast of Norway, the Danes in what is now southern and western Sweden and southeastern Norway, the Svear in the region around M\u00e4laren as well as a large portion of the present day eastern seacoast of Sweden and the Geats in V\u00e4sterg\u00f6tland and \u00d6sterg\u00f6tland. These peoples spoke closely related dialects of an Indo-European language, Old Norse. Although political boundaries have shifted, descendants of these peoples still are the dominant populations in the peninsula in the early 21st century.\nPolitical development.\nAlthough the Nordic countries look back on more than 1,000 years of history as distinct political entities, the international boundaries came late and emerged gradually. It was not until the middle of the 17th century that Sweden had a secure outlet on the Kattegat and control of the south Baltic coast. The Swedish and Norwegian boundaries were finally agreed and marked out in 1751. The Finnish-Norwegian border on the peninsula was established after extensive negotiation in 1809, and the common Norwegian-Russian districts were not partitioned until 1826. Even then the borders were still fluid, with Finland gaining access to the Barents Sea in 1920, but ceding this territory to the Soviet Union in 1944.\nDenmark, Sweden and the Russian Empire dominated the political relationships on the Scandinavian Peninsula for centuries, with Iceland, Finland and Norway only gaining their full independence during the 20th century. The Kingdom of Norway\u00a0\u2013 long held in personal union by Denmark\u00a0\u2013 fell to Sweden after the Napoleonic Wars and only attained full independence in 1905. Having been an autonomous grand duchy within the Russian Empire since 1809, Finland declared independence during the Soviet revolution of Russia in 1917. Iceland declared its independence from Denmark in 1944, while Denmark was under the occupation of Nazi Germany. Iceland was encouraged to do this by the British and American armed forces that were defending Iceland from Nazi invasion.\nThe Wehrmacht invaded Norway in 1940 and the German Army occupied all of Norway until May 1945. With the acquiescence of the Kingdom of Sweden, German troops moved from northern Norway, across northern Sweden, into Finland, which had become an ally of Nazi Germany. Then, in the spring of 1941, the German Army and the Finnish Army invaded the Soviet Union together. The Republic of Finland had a grievance against the Soviet Union because the Red Army had invaded southeastern Finland in the Winter War (1939\u201340) and had taken a large area of territory away from Finland.\nSweden remained a neutral country during the First World War, the Korean War and the Cold War.\nIn 1945, Norway, Denmark and Iceland were founding members of the United Nations. Sweden joined the U.N. soon after. Finland joined during the 1950s. The first Secretary General of the United Nations, Trygve Lie, was a Norwegian citizen. The second Secretary General of the United Nations, Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld, was a Swedish citizen. Thus the people of the Scandinavian Peninsula had a strong influence in international affairs during the 20th century.\nIn 1949, Norway, Denmark and Iceland became founding members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation for their defence against East Germany, the Soviet Union and all other potential invaders. Finland later joined NATO in 2023, and Sweden in 2024, in response to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.\nSweden and Finland joined the European Union in 1995. Norway, however, remains outside the Union.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is dominated by the cities of San Francisco, San Jose, and Oakland.\nSan Francisco Bay drains water from approximately 40 percent of California. Water from the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers, and from the Sierra Nevada mountains, flow into Suisun Bay, which then travels through the Carquinez Strait to meet with the Napa River at the entrance to San Pablo Bay, which connects at its south end to San Francisco Bay. It then connects to the Pacific Ocean via the Golden Gate strait. However, this entire group of interconnected bays is often called \"San Francisco Bay\". The bay was designated a Ramsar Wetland of International Importance on February 2, 2013, and the Port of Oakland on the bay is one of the busiest cargo ports on the west coast.\nGeography.\nThe bay covers somewhere between , depending on which sub-bays (such as San Pablo Bay), estuaries, wetlands, and so on are included in the measurement. The main part of the bay measures wide east-to-west and somewhere between 1 and 2 north-to-south.\nSan Francisco Bay is the second-largest estuary on the Pacific coast of the Americas, following the Salish Sea in Washington State and British Columbia, Canada.\nThe bay was navigable as far south as San Jose until the 1850s, when hydraulic mining released massive amounts of sediment from the rivers that settled in those parts of the bay that had little or no current. Later, wetlands and inlets were deliberately filled in, reducing the bay's size since the mid-19th century by as much as one third. Recently, large areas of wetlands have been restored, further confusing the issue of the bay's size. Despite its value as a waterway and harbor, many thousands of acres of marshy wetlands at the edges of the bay were, for many years, considered wasted space. As a result, soil excavated for building projects or dredged from channels was often dumped onto the wetlands and other parts of the bay as landfill.\nFrom the mid-19th century through the late 20th century, more than a third of the original bay was filled and often built on. The deep, damp soil in these areas is subject to soil liquefaction during earthquakes, and most of the major damage close to the bay in the Loma Prieta earthquake of 1989 occurred to structures on these areas.\nThe Marina District of San Francisco, hard hit by the 1989 earthquake, was built on fill that had been placed there for the Panama-Pacific International Exposition, although liquefaction did not occur on a large scale. In the 1990s, San Francisco International Airport proposed filling in hundreds more acres to extend its overcrowded international runways in exchange for purchasing other parts of the bay and converting them back to wetlands. The idea was, and remains, controversial. (\"For further details, see the \"Bay fill and depth profile\" section.\")\nThere are five large islands in San Francisco Bay. Alameda, the largest island, was created when a shipping lane was cut to form the Port of Oakland in 1901. It is now a suburban community. Angel Island was known as \"Ellis Island West\" because it served as the entry point for immigrants from East Asia. It is now a state park accessible by ferry. Mountainous Yerba Buena Island is pierced by a tunnel linking the east and west spans of the San Francisco\u2013Oakland Bay Bridge. Attached to the north is the artificial and flat Treasure Island, site of the 1939 Golden Gate International Exposition. From the Second World War until the 1990s, both islands served as military bases and are now being redeveloped. Isolated in the center of the bay is Alcatraz, the site of the famous federal penitentiary. The federal prison on Alcatraz Island no longer functions, but the complex is a popular tourist site. Despite its name, Mare Island in the northern part of the bay is a peninsula rather than an island.\nGeology.\nSan Francisco Bay is thought to represent a down-warping of the Earth's crust between the San Andreas Fault to the west and the Hayward Fault to the east, though the precise nature of this remains under study. About 560,000 years ago, a tectonic shift caused the large inland Lake Corcoran to spill out from the central valley and through the Carquinez Strait, carving out sediment and forming canyons in what is now the northern part of San Francisco Bay and Golden Gate strait.\nSan Francisco Bay has been filled and emptied of sea water many times during the Pleistocene in accordance with sea level changes caused by glacial advances and retreats. During the Wisconsin Glaciation, between 15,000 and about 10,000 years ago, the basin which is now filled by San Francisco Bay was a large river valley with small hills, channeling the Sacramento River through the Golden Gate Strait into the ocean. When the great ice sheets began to melt, around 11,000 years ago, the sea level started to rise rapidly, by about 1 inch per year. Melting glaciers in the Sierra Nevada washed huge amounts of sediment down the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers, which accumulated on the shores of the bay, forming huge mudflats and marshes that supported local wildlife. By 5000\u00a0BC the sea level rose , filling the valley with water from the Pacific. The Farallon Islands are what used to be hills along the old coastline, and Potato Patch Shoal is an area of sand dunes now covered by the ocean.\nHistory.\nThe indigenous inhabitants of San Francisco Bay are Ohlone. In the eastern part of the bay, the native Chochenyo people called the bay \"ommu\", in the Chochenyo language. \nThe bay eluded discovery by passing European mariners for centuries, \"because its entrance was narrow and often fog-shrouded\".\nThe first European to see San Francisco Bay is likely N. de Morena, who was left at New Albion at Drakes Bay in Marin County, California, by Sir Francis Drake in 1579 and then walked to Mexico.\nThe first recorded European discovery of San Francisco Bay was on November 4, 1769, when Spanish explorer Gaspar de Portol\u00e1, unable to find the Port of Monterey, continued north close to what is now Pacifica and reached the summit of the Sweeney Ridge, now marked as the place where he first sighted San Francisco Bay. Portol\u00e1 and his party did not realize what they had discovered, thinking they had arrived at a large arm of what is now called Drakes Bay. At the time, Drakes Bay went by the name \"Bahia de San Francisco\" and thus both bodies of water became associated with the name. Eventually, the larger, more important body of water fully appropriated the name \"San Francisco Bay\".\nThe first European to enter the bay is believed to have been the Spanish explorer Juan de Ayala, who passed through the Golden Gate on August 5, 1775, in his ship the \"San Carlos\" and moored in a bay of Angel Island now known as Ayala Cove. Ayala continued to explore the San Francisco Bay Area and the expedition's cartographer, Jos\u00e9 de Ca\u00f1izares, gathered the information necessary to produce the first map of the area. A number of place names survive (anglicized) from that first map, including Point Reyes, Angel Island, Farallon Islands, and Alcatraz Island.\nAlaskan Native sea otter hunters using Aleutian kayaks and working for the Russian\u2013American Company entered San Francisco Bay in 1807 and again over 1810\u20131811. Led by the Russian Timofei Nikitich Tarakanov, these hunting raids probably wiped out sea otters in the bay. Thousands of sea otter skins were taken to Sitka, then Guangzhou (Canton), China, where they commanded a high price.\nThe United States seized the region from Mexico during the Mexican\u2013American War (1846\u20131848). On February 2, 1848, the Mexican province of Alta California was annexed to the United States with the signing of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. A year and a half later, California requested to join the United States on December 3, 1849, and was accepted as the 31st State of the Union on September 9, 1850.\nIn 1921, a tablet was dedicated by a group of men in downtown San Francisco, marking the site of the original shoreline. The tablet reads: \"This tablet marks the shore line of San Francisco Bay at the time of the discovery of gold in California, January 24, 1848. Map reproduced above delineates old shore line. Placed by the Historic Landmarks committee, Native Sons of the Golden West, 1921.\"\nThe bay became the center of American settlement and commerce in the Far West through most of the remainder of the 19th century. During the California Gold Rush (1848\u20131855), San Francisco Bay suddenly became one of the world's great seaports, dominating shipping in the American West until the last years of the 19th century. The bay's regional importance increased further when the first transcontinental railroad was connected to its western terminus at Alameda on September 6, 1869. The terminus was switched to the Oakland Long Wharf two months later on November 8, 1869.\nIn 1910, the Southern Pacific railroad company built the Dumbarton Rail Bridge, the first bridge crossing San Francisco Bay. The first automobile crossing was the Dumbarton Bridge, completed in January 1927. More crossings were later constructed \u2013 the Carquinez Bridge in May 1927, the San Francisco\u2013Oakland Bay Bridge in 1936, the Golden Gate Bridge in 1937, the Richmond\u2013San Rafael Bridge in 1956, and the San Mateo\u2013Hayward Bridge in 1967.\nDuring the 20th century, the bay was subject to the 1940s Reber Plan, which would have filled in parts of the bay in order to increase industrial activity along the waterfront. In 1959, the United States Army Corps of Engineers released a report stating that if current infill trends continued, the bay would be as big as a shipping channel by 2020. This news led to the creation of the Save the Bay movement in 1960,&lt;ref name=\"digicoll.lib.berkeley.edu/218492\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; which mobilized to stop the infill of wetlands as well as the bay itself, which had shrunk to two-thirds of its size in the century before 1961.\nOn September 17, 1965, the California State Legislature enacted the McAteer-Petris Act, which created the San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission. Since then, the Commission has strictly regulated bay fill. Foster City, Redwood Shores, Paradise Cay, and Emeryville's western expansion were among the last developments along the bay shoreline before McAteer-Petris limited additional filling of the bay.\nSan Francisco Bay continues to support some of the densest industrial production and urban settlement in the United States. The San Francisco Bay Area is the American West's second-largest urban area, with approximately seven million residents.\nEcology.\nDespite its urban and industrial character, San Francisco Bay and the Sacramento\u2013San Joaquin River Delta remain perhaps California's most important ecological habitats. California's Dungeness crab, California halibut, and Pacific salmon fisheries rely on the bay as a nursery. The few remaining salt marshes now represent most of California's remaining salt marsh, supporting a number of endangered species and providing key ecosystem services such as filtering pollutants and sediments from the rivers. San Francisco Bay is recognized for protection by the California Bays and Estuaries Policy, with oversight provided by the San Francisco Estuary Partnership.\nMost famously, the bay is a key link in the Pacific Flyway. Millions of waterfowl annually use the bay shallows as a refuge. Two endangered species of birds are found here: the California least tern and the Ridgway's Rail. Exposed bay muds provide important feeding areas for shorebirds, but underlying layers of bay mud pose geological hazards for structures near many parts of the bay perimeter. San Francisco Bay provided the nation's first wildlife refuge, Oakland's artificial Lake Merritt, constructed in the 1860s, and America's first urban National Wildlife Refuge, the Don Edwards San Francisco Bay National Wildlife Refuge (SFBNWR) in 1972. The bay is also plagued by non-native species.\nSalt produced from San Francisco Bay is produced in salt evaporation ponds and is shipped throughout the Western United States to bakeries, canneries, fisheries, cheese makers and other food industries and used to de-ice winter highways, clean kidney dialysis machines, for animal nutrition, and in many industries. Many companies have produced salt in the bay, with the Leslie Salt Company the largest private land owner in the Bay Area in the 1940s.\nLow-salinity salt ponds mirror the ecosystem of the bay, with fish and fish-eating birds in abundance. Mid-salinity ponds support dense populations of brine shrimp, which provide a rich food source for millions of shorebirds. Only salt-tolerant micro-algae survive in the high salinity ponds, and impart a deep red color to these ponds from the pigment within the algae protoplasm. The salt marsh harvest mouse is an endangered species endemic to the wetlands of San Francisco Bay with a high salt tolerance. It needs native pickleweed, which is often displaced by invasive cordgrass, for its habitat.\nThe seasonal range of water temperature in the bay is from January's to September's when measured at Fort Point, which is near the southern end of the Golden Gate Bridge and at the entrance to San Francisco Bay.\nFor the first time in 65 years, Pacific Harbor Porpoise (\"Phocoena phocoena\") returned to the bay in 2009. Golden Gate Cetacean Research, a non-profit organization focused on research on cetaceans, has developed a photo-identification database enabling the scientists to identify specific porpoise individuals and is trying to ascertain whether a healthier bay has brought their return. Pacific harbor porpoise range from Point Conception, California, to Alaska and across to the Kamchatka Peninsula and Japan. Recent genetic studies show that there is a local stock from San Francisco to the Russian River and that eastern Pacific coastal populations rarely migrate far, unlike western Atlantic Harbor porpoise.\nThe common bottlenose dolphin (\"Tursiops truncatus\") has been extending its current range northwards from the Southern California Bight. The first coastal bottlenose dolphin in the Bay Area in recent times was spotted in 1983 off the San Mateo County coast in 1983. In 2001, bottlenose dolphins were first spotted east of the Golden Gate Bridge and confirmed by photographic evidence in 2007. Zooarcheological remains of bottlenose dolphins indicated that bottlenose dolphins inhabited San Francisco Bay in prehistoric times until at least 700 years before present, and dolphin skulls dredged from the bay suggest occasional visitors in historic times.\nPollution.\nSan Francisco Bay faces many of the same water quality issues as other urban waterways in industrialized countries, or downstream of intensive agriculture. According to state water quality regulators, San Francisco Bay waters do not meet water quality standards for the following pollutants:\nMercury.\nIndustrial, mining, and other uses of mercury have resulted in a widespread distribution in the bay, with uptake in the bay's phytoplankton and contamination of its sportfish.\nOil spills.\nIn January 1971, two Standard Oil tankers collided in the bay, creating an oil spill disaster, which spurred environmental protection of the bay. In November 2007, a ship named \"COSCO Busan\" collided with the San Francisco\u2013Oakland Bay Bridge and spilled over of bunker fuel, creating the largest oil spill in the region since 1996.\nNutrients.\nThe bay also has some of the highest levels of dissolved inorganic nitrogen known from any coastal water body, mostly originating from treated wastewater from Publicly owned treatment works. In other bays, such nutrient levels would likely lead to eutrophication, but historically, the bay has had less harmful algal blooms than other water bodies with similar nutrient concentrations. Potential explanations have included the presence of intensive \"top-down control\" from grazing clams like \"Potamocorbula\", high sediment supply limiting light availability for the algae, and intensive tidal mixing. The occurrence of an unprecedented harmful algal bloom of \"Heterosigma akashiwo\" in 2022, resulting in mass fish deaths and anoxia, suggests that the mechanisms of control on algal growth may be eroding.\nPBDEs.\nThe bay was once considered a hotspot for polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) flame retardants used to make upholstered furniture and infant care items less flammable. PBDEs have been largely phased out and replaced with alternative phosphate flame retardants. A 2019 San Francisco Estuary Institute (SFEI) study assayed a wide range of these newer flame retardant chemicals in Bay waters, bivalve California mussels (\"Mytilus californianus\"), and harbor seals (\"Phoca vitulina\") which haul out in Corkscrew Slough on Bair Island in San Mateo County, with phosphate flame retardant contaminants such as tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl)phosphate (TDCPP) and triphenyl phosphate (TPhP) found at levels comparable to thresholds for aquatic toxicity.\nEmerging contaminants.\nThousands of man-made chemicals are found in Bay water, sediment, and organisms. For many of these, there is little or no data on their impacts on the environment or human health, and they are not regulated by state or federal law. These are often referred to as \"contaminants of emerging concern.\" The San Francisco Estuary Institute has studied these chemicals in the Bay since 2001. Scientists have identified the following most likely to have a negative impact on Bay wildlife:\nBay fill and depth profile.\nSan Francisco Bay's profile changed dramatically in the late 19th century and again with the initiation of dredging by the US Army Corps of Engineers in the 20th century. Before about 1860, most bay shores (with the exception of rocky shores, such as those in Carquinez Strait; along Marin shoreline; Point Richmond; Golden Gate area) contained extensive wetlands that graded nearly invisibly from freshwater wetlands to salt marsh and then tidal mudflat. A deep channel ran through the center of the bay, following the ancient drowned river valley.\nIn the 1860s and continuing into the early 20th century, miners dumped staggering quantities of mud and gravel from hydraulic mining operations into the upper Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers. GK Gilbert's estimates of debris total more than eight times the amount of rock and dirt moved during construction of the Panama Canal. This material flowed down the rivers, progressively eroding into finer and finer sediment, until it reached the bay system. Here some of it settled, eventually filling in Suisun Bay, San Pablo Bay, and San Francisco Bay, in decreasing order of severity.\nBy the end of the 19th century, these \"slickens\" had filled in much of the shallow bay flats, raising the entire bay profile. New marshes were created in some areas.\nIn the decades surrounding 1900, at the behest of local political officials and following Congressional orders, the U.S. Army Corps began dredging the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers and the deep channels of San Francisco Bay. This work has continued without interruption ever since. Some of the dredge spoils were initially dumped in the bay shallows (including helping to create Treasure Island on the former shoals to the north of Yerba Buena Island) and used to raise islands in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. The net effect of dredging has been to maintain a narrow deep channel\u2014deeper perhaps than the original bay channel\u2014through a much shallower bay. At the same time, most of the marsh areas have been filled or blocked off from the bay by dikes.\nLarge ships transiting the bay must follow deep underwater channels that are maintained by frequent dredging as the average depth of the bay is only as deep as a swimming pool\u2014approximately . Between Hayward and San Mateo to San Jose it is . The deepest part of the bay is under and out of the Golden Gate Bridge, at .\nIn the late 1990s, a 12-year harbor-deepening project for the Port of Oakland began; it was largely completed by September 2009. Previously, the bay waters and harbor facilities only allowed for ships with a draft of , but dredging activities undertaken by the United States Army Corps of Engineers in partnership with the Port of Oakland succeeded in providing access for vessels with a draft. Four dredging companies were employed in the US$432\u00a0million project, with $244\u00a0million paid for with federal funds and $188\u00a0million supplied by the Port of Oakland. Some of mud from the dredging was deposited at the western edge of Middle Harbor Shoreline Park to become a shallow-water wetlands habitat for marine and shore life. Further dredging followed in 2011, to maintain the navigation channel. This dredging enabled the arrival of the largest container ship ever to enter San Francisco Bay, the \"MSC Fabiola\". Bay pilots trained for the visit on a simulator at the California Maritime Academy for over a year. The ship arrived drawing less than its full draft of because it held only three-quarters of a load after its stop in Long Beach.\nTransportation.\nSan Francisco Bay was traversed by watercraft before the arrival of Europeans. Indigenous peoples used canoes to fish and clam along the shoreline. Sailing ships enabled transportation between the bay and other parts of the world\u2014and served as ferries and freighters within the bay and between the bay and inland ports, such as Sacramento and Stockton. These were gradually replaced by steam-powered vessels starting in the late 19th century. Several shipyards were established around the bay, augmented during wartime (e.g., the Kaiser Shipyards, Richmond Shipyards) near Richmond in 1940 for World War II for construction of mass-produced, assembly line Liberty and Victory cargo ships.\nSan Francisco Bay is spanned by nine bridges, eight of which carry cars.\nThe Transbay Tube, an underwater rail tunnel, carries BART services between Oakland and San Francisco.\nPrior to the bridges and, later, the Transbay Tube, transbay transportation was dominated by fleets of ferryboats operated by the Southern Pacific Railroad and the Key System transit company. However, in recent decades, ferries have returned, primarily serving commuters from Marin County, relieving the traffic bottleneck of the Golden Gate Bridge (see Ferries of San Francisco Bay).\nThe bay also continues to serve as a major seaport. The Port of Oakland is one of the largest cargo ports in the United States, while the Port of Richmond and the Port of San Francisco provide smaller services.\nAn additional crossing south of the Bay Bridge has long been proposed.\nRecreation.\nSan Francisco Bay is popular for sailors (boats, as well as windsurfing and kitesurfing), due to consistent strong westerly/northwesterly thermally-generated winds \u2013 Beaufort force 6 () is common on summer afternoons \u2013 and protection from large open ocean swells. Yachting and yacht racing are popular pastimes and the San Francisco Bay Area is home to many of the world's top sailors. A shoreline bicycle and pedestrian trail known as the San Francisco Bay Trail encircles the edge of the bay. The San Francisco Bay Area Water Trail, a growing network of launching and landing sites around the bay for non-motorized small boat users (such as kayakers) is being developed. Parks and protected areas around the bay include Eden Landing Ecological Reserve, Hayward Regional Shoreline, Don Edwards San Francisco Bay National Wildlife Refuge, Hayward Shoreline Interpretive Center, Crown Memorial State Beach, Eastshore State Park, Point Isabel Regional Shoreline, Brooks Island Regional Preserve, and C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez Park.\nThe California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) has developed a safe eating advisory for fish caught in San Francisco Bay based on levels of mercury or PCBs found in local species.\nThe San Francisco Bay Area Water Trail is a planned system of designated trailheads designed to improve non-motorized small boat access to the bay. The California Coastal Conservancy approved funding in March 2011 to begin implementation of the water trail.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

On its northern tip is the City and County of San Francisco. Its southern base is Palo Alto, Mountain View, Los Altos and Sunnyvale, in Santa Clara County. Most of the Peninsula is occupied by San Mateo County, which is between San Francisco and Santa Clara counties, and the Peninsula includes the cities and towns of Atherton, Belmont, Brisbane, Burlingame, Colma, Daly City, East Palo Alto, El Granada, Foster City, Half Moon Bay, Hillsborough, La Honda, Loma Mar, Los Altos, Los Altos Hills, Menlo Park, Millbrae, Mountain View, Pacifica, Palo Alto, Pescadero, Portola Valley, Redwood City, Redwood Shores, San Bruno, San Carlos, San Mateo, South San Francisco, Sunnyvale, West Menlo Park and Woodside.\nWhereas the term \"peninsula\" in a geographical sense technically refers to the entire San Francisco Peninsula, in local jargon, \"The Peninsula\" does not include the city of San Francisco.\nHistory.\nIn 1795, Governor Diego de Borica gave Jos\u00e9 Dar\u00edo Arg\u00fcello a Spanish land grant known as Rancho de las Pulgas. This rancho was the largest grant on the peninsula consisting of .\nAs a local geographic term, the area referred to as \"the Peninsula\" is distinct from that denoted by \"the City\", and refers to the portion south of San Francisco. The appellation may date to the period prior to 1856, when the City of San Francisco and the County of San Francisco were separate entities, the latter then coextensive with contemporary San Mateo County and San Francisco City-County. The City-County owns several disjunct properties along the whole of the Peninsula (mostly water pumping stations connected to the Hetch Hetchy Valley on which San Francisco has a permanent leasehold) \u2013 thus, most of the larger communities in San Mateo County are \"de facto\" suburbs of San Francisco, with the neighboring communities of Pacifica, Daly City, Broadmoor, Colma, South San Francisco, Half Moon Bay, San Bruno, and Brisbane being immediate suburbs. The remaining suburban area of the Peninsula is on the east side of the Santa Cruz Mountains, along San Francisco Bay; the west and south-central portions of the Peninsula are mostly rural, unincorporated, and unorganized areas.\nA substantial portion of Silicon Valley is located on the peninsula. In Silicon Valley are the headquarters of some of the largest tech companies in the world, such as Google, Yahoo, Facebook, and Apple. Since 2010, droughts and wildfires have increased in frequency and become less seasonal and more year-round, further straining the region's water security.\nGeography and transportation.\nAlong the center line of the Peninsula is the northern half of the Santa Cruz Mountains, formed by the action of plate tectonics along the San Andreas Fault. In the middle of the Peninsula along the fault is the Crystal Springs Reservoir. Just north of the Crystal Springs reservoir is San Andreas Lake, after which the geologic fault was originally named.\nThe east side of the peninsula is a densely populated and largely urban and suburban area that includes portions of Silicon Valley. It forms a commuter area between San Francisco to the north and San Jose to the south.\nRoads.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nThe bridges in the Peninsula include the Dumbarton Bridge, the Golden Gate Bridge, the San Francisco - Oakland Bay Bridge, and the San Mateo\u2013Hayward Bridge.\nA number of major thoroughfares run north-south: El Camino Real (SR 82) and US 101 on the east side along the bay, Interstate 280 down the center, Skyline Boulevard (SR 35) along the crest of the Santa Cruz Mountains, and SR 1 on the west along the Pacific, and SR 85 which forms the southern end of the Peninsula.\nTransit.\nCaltrain is the primary passenger rail transit in the peninsula, serving much of the eastern urbanized areas of the peninsula between Mountain View (which also connects to VTA light rail) and San Francisco's 4th and King Street station. In addition, the peninsula has access to Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) northward of Millbrae, connecting San Mateo County and San Francisco to the East Bay through a route over and under Daly City, Glen Park, San Francisco's Mission district, and through part of Market Street subway.\nBus service is predominantly provided by SamTrans and the SFMTA's Muni buses, which primarily run in San Mateo and San Francisco counties respectively. In addition, southward of Palo Alto, the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority operates buses to other parts of Santa Clara County. Most of the peninsula's bus transit to the East Bay and North Bay flowing through San Francisco, as neither AC Transit nor Golden Gate Transit, the primary transit operators for the East and North Bay respectively, serve the peninsula south of San Francisco.\nAirports.\nThe peninsula's largest commercial airport is San Francisco International Airport, itself connected to US 101 and BART and accessible to Caltrain (via a BART connection at Milbrae station).\nSan Jose International Airport, is the next largest airport in the region serving and might be a more viable option for the southern peninsula. The airport is connected to US 101 and there is a single connector bus, VTA Line 60, that links to Caltrain (at Santa Clara Transit Center) and to eastern lines of BART (Milpitas).\nOakland International Airport, located in the East Bay, is the smallest of the three and is also accessible directly via BART.\nEnvironmental features.\nThe San Francisco Peninsula contains a variety of habitats including estuarine, marine, oak woodland, redwood forest, coastal scrub and oak savanna. There are numerous species of wildlife present, especially along the San Francisco Bay estuarine shoreline, San Bruno Mountain, Fitzgerald Marine Reserve and the forests on the Montara Mountain block.\nThe area is home to several endangered species including the San Francisco garter snake, the Mission blue butterfly and the San Bruno elfin butterfly, all of which are endemic to San Mateo County. The endangered California clapper rail is also found on the shores of San Francisco Bay, in the cities of Belmont and San Mateo.\nAlthough tule elk, an elk subspecies found only in California, were historically native to the San Francisco Peninsula, they were hunted to extinction by 1850.

{"id": "26976", "revid": "18833090", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26976", "title": "Silicon Valley", "text": "Technology hub in California, United States\nSilicon Valley is a region in Northern California that is a global center for high technology and innovation. Located in the southern part of the San Francisco Bay Area, it corresponds roughly to the geographical area of the Santa Clara Valley. The term \"Silicon Valley\" refers to the area in which high-tech business has proliferated in Northern California, and it also serves as a general metonym for California's high-tech business sector.\nThe cities of Sunnyvale, Mountain View, Palo Alto and Menlo Park are frequently cited as the birthplace of Silicon Valley. Other major Silicon Valley cities are San Jose, Santa Clara, Redwood City and Cupertino. The San Jose Metropolitan Area has the third-highest GDP per capita in the world (after Zurich and Oslo), according to the Brookings Institution. As of June 2021, it also had the highest percentage of homes valued at $1 million or more in the United States.\nSilicon Valley is home to many of the world's largest high-tech corporations, including the headquarters of more than 30 businesses in the \"Fortune\" 1000, and thousands of startup companies. Silicon Valley also accounts for one-third of all of the venture capital investment in the United States, which has helped it to become a leading hub and startup ecosystem for high-tech innovation, although the tech ecosystem has recently become more geographically dispersed. It was in Silicon Valley that the silicon-based integrated circuit, the microprocessor, and the microcomputer, among other technologies, were developed. As of 2021[ [update]], the region employed about a half million information technology workers.\nAs more high-tech companies were established across San Jose and the Santa Clara Valley, and then north towards the Bay Area's two other major cities, San Francisco and Oakland, the term \"Silicon Valley\" came to have two definitions: a narrower geographic one, referring to Santa Clara County and southeastern San Mateo County, and a metonymical definition referring to high-tech businesses in the entire Bay Area. The term Silicon Valley is often used as a synecdoche for the American high-technology economic sector. The name also became a global synonym for leading high-tech research and enterprises, and thus inspired similarly named locations, as well as research parks and technology centers with comparable structures all around the world. Many headquarters of tech companies in Silicon Valley have become hotspots for tourism.\nEtymology.\n\"Silicon\" refers to the chemical element used in silicon-based transistors and integrated circuit chips, which is the focus of a large number of computer hardware and software innovators and manufacturers in the region.\nThe popularization of the name is often credited to Don Hoefler, the first journalist to use the term in a news story. His article \"Silicon Valley U.S.A.\" was published in the January 11, 1971, issue of the weekly trade newspaper \"Electronic News\". In preparation for this report, during a lunch meeting with marketing people who were visiting the area, he heard them use the term. Earlier uses outside journalism exist; for example, a May 1970 advertisement in the \"Peninsula Times Tribune\" described a Palo Alto company that \"helps production people in Silicon Valley.\"However, the term did not gain widespread use until the early 1980s, at the time of the introduction of the IBM PC and numerous related hardware and software products to the consumer market.\nThe urbanized area is built upon an alluvial plain within a longitudinal valley formed by roughly parallel earthquake faults. The area between the faults subsided into a graben or dropped valley. Hoefler defined Silicon Valley as the urbanized parts of \"the San Francisco Peninsula and Santa Clara Valley\". Before the expansive growth of the tech industry, the region had been the largest fruit-producing and packing region in the world up through the 1960s, with 39 fruit canneries. The nickname it had been known as during that period was \"the Valley of Heart\u2019s Delight\".\nHistory.\nSilicon Valley was born through the intersection of several contributing factors, including a skilled science research base housed in area universities, plentiful venture capital, permissive government regulation, and steady U.S. Department of Defense spending. Stanford University\u2019s leadership was especially important in the valley's early development. Together these elements formed the basis of its growth and success. The United States was more friendly than other countries to business investment, charging much lower taxes on capital gains since the Revenue Act of 1921, and featuring particularly loose free market controls over new business. In 1953, the Small Business Administration was created to foster startups, giving a boost to entrepreneurs. Northern California was even more welcoming, with a group of venture capitalists actively seeking high-tech business ideas, clustered on Sand Hill Road in Menlo Park and Palo Alto. California's civil code undermined the usual non-compete clauses that effectively tied employees to their companies in other states, allowing California workers to freely apply the knowledge they gained from their previous employer. This gave Silicon Valley an advantage over other American tech hubs such as Massachusetts Route 128 curving around Boston.\nEarly military origins.\nThe San Francisco Bay Area had long been a major site of United States Navy research and technology. In 1909, Charles Herrold started the first radio station in the United States with regularly scheduled programming in San Jose. Later that year, Stanford University graduate Cyril Elwell purchased the U.S. patents for Poulsen arc radio transmission technology and founded the Federal Telegraph Corporation (FTC) in Palo Alto. Over the next decade, the FTC created the world's first global radio communication system, and signed a contract with the Navy in 1912.\nIn 1933, Air Base Sunnyvale, California, was commissioned by the United States Government for use as a Naval Air Station (NAS) to house the airship \"USS Macon\" in Hangar One. The station was renamed NAS Moffett Field, and between 1933 and 1947, U.S. Navy blimps were based there. A number of technology firms had set up shop in the area around Moffett Field to serve the Navy. When the Navy gave up its airship ambitions and moved most of its west coast operations to San Diego, the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA, forerunner of NASA) took over portions of Moffett Field for aeronautics research. Many of the original companies stayed, while new ones moved in. The immediate area was soon filled with aerospace firms, such as Lockheed, which was the area's largest employer from the 1950s into 1980s.\nRole of Stanford University.\nStanford University, its affiliates, and graduates have played a major role in the development of the culture of collaboration among high-tech companies. A powerful sense of regional solidarity shaped the outlook of inventors and engineers in California; contrasting markedly from the insular and competitive environment of engineering firms on the East Coast of the United States. From the 1890s, Stanford University's leaders saw its mission as service to the (American) West and shaped the school accordingly. At the same time, the perceived exploitation of the West at the hands of eastern interests fueled booster-like attempts to build self-sufficient local industry. Thus regionalism helped align Stanford's interests with those of the area's high-tech firms.\nFrederick Terman, as Stanford University's dean of the school of engineering from 1946, encouraged faculty and graduates to start their own companies. In 1951 Terman spearheaded the formation of Stanford Industrial Park (now Stanford Research Park, an area surrounding Page Mill Road, south west of El Camino Real and extending beyond Foothill Expressway to Arastradero Road), where the university leased portions of its land to high-tech firms. Terman nurtured companies like Hewlett-Packard, Varian Associates, Eastman Kodak, General Electric, Lockheed Corporation, and other high-tech firms, until what would become Silicon Valley grew up around the Stanford University campus.\nIn 1951, to address the financial demands of Stanford's growth requirements, and to provide local employment-opportunities for graduating students, Frederick Terman proposed leasing Stanford's lands for use as an office park named the Stanford Industrial Park (later Stanford Research Park). Terman invited only high-technology companies. The first tenant was Varian Associates, founded by Stanford alumni in the 1930s to build military-radar components. Terman also found venture capital for civilian-technology start-ups. Hewlett-Packard became one of the major success-stories. Founded in 1939 in Packard's garage by Stanford graduates Bill Hewlett and David Packard, Hewlett-Packard moved its offices into the Stanford Research Park shortly after 1953. In 1954 Stanford originated the Honors Cooperative Program to allow full-time employees of the companies to pursue graduate degrees from the university on a part-time basis. The initial companies signed five-year agreements in which they would pay double the tuition for each student in order to cover the costs. Hewlett-Packard has become the largest personal-computer manufacturer in the world, and transformed the home-printing market when it released the first thermal drop-on-demand ink-jet printer in 1984. Other early tenants included Eastman Kodak, General Electric, and Lockheed.\nRise of Silicon.\nIn 1956, William Shockley, the co-inventor of the first working transistor (with John Bardeen and Walter Houser Brattain), moved from New Jersey to Mountain View, California, to start Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory to live closer to his ailing mother May in Palo Alto. Shockley's work served as the basis for many electronic developments for decades. Both Frederick Terman and William Shockley are often called \"the father of Silicon Valley\". Unlike many other researchers who used germanium as the semiconductor material, Shockley believed that silicon was the better material for making transistors. Shockley intended to replace the current transistor with a new three-element design (today known as the Shockley diode), but the design was considerably more difficult to build than the \"simple\" transistor. In 1957, Shockley decided to end research on the silicon transistor. As a result of Shockley's abusive management style, eight engineers left the company to form Fairchild Semiconductor; Shockley referred to them as the \"traitorous eight\". Two of the original employees of Fairchild Semiconductor, Robert Noyce and Gordon Moore, would go on to found Intel.\nFollowing the 1959 inventions of the monolithic integrated circuit (IC) chip by Robert Noyce at Fairchild, the first commercial MOS IC was introduced by General Microelectronics in 1964. The first single-chip microprocessor was the Intel 4004, designed and realized by Federico Faggin along with Ted Hoff, Masatoshi Shima and Stanley Mazor at Intel in 1971. In April 1974, Intel released the Intel 8080, the second 8-bit microprocessor designed and manufactured by Intel.\nOrigins of the Internet.\nOn April 23, 1963, J. C. R. Licklider, the first director of the Information Processing Techniques Office (IPTO) at The Pentagon's ARPA issued an office memorandum addressed to Members and Affiliates of the Intergalactic Computer Network. It rescheduled a meeting in Palo Alto regarding his vision of a computer network, which he imagined as an electronic commons open to all, the main and essential medium of informational interaction for governments, institutions, corporations, and individuals. As head of IPTO from 1962 to 1964, \"Licklider initiated three of the most important developments in information technology: the creation of computer science departments at several major universities, time-sharing, and networking.\" In 1969, the Stanford Research Institute (now SRI International), operated one of the four original nodes that comprised ARPANET, predecessor to the Internet.\nEmergence of venture capital.\nBy the early 1970s, there were many semiconductor companies in the area, computer firms using their devices, and programming and service companies serving both. Industrial space was plentiful and housing was still inexpensive. Growth during this era was fueled by the emergence of venture capital on Sand Hill Road, beginning with Kleiner Perkins and Sequoia Capital in 1972; the availability of venture capital exploded after the successful $1.3\u00a0billion IPO of Apple Computer in December 1980. Since the 1980s, Silicon Valley has been home to the largest concentration of venture capital firms in the world.\nIn 1971, Don Hoefler traced the origins of Silicon Valley firms, including via investments from Fairchild's eight co-founders. The key investors in Kleiner Perkins and Sequoia Capital were from the same group, directly leading to \"Tech Crunch\" 2014 estimate of 92 public firms of 130 related listed firms then worth over US$2.1 trillion with over 2,000 firms traced back to them.\nBanking.\nAnother important pillar of the Valley's success was Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), founded in 1983 by a group of former Bank of America executives. Before its 2023 collapse, SVB specialized in providing banking services to Silicon Valley entrepreneurs and their startup firms. SVB's original primary commercial lending product was a working capital line of credit, secured by a startup's accounts receivable. In contrast to traditional banks, who focused their commercial lending on already-established businesses, SVB specialized in lending money to small startup companies in the \"preprofit\" stage.\nLawyers and law firms.\nPrior to 1970, most Northern California lawyers were based in San Francisco, especially the experienced patent attorneys whom the high-tech industry needed to protect its intellectual property. During the 1970s, lawyers began to follow venture capitalists down the Peninsula to serve the booming high-tech industry in Silicon Valley. As of 1999, there were 2,400 lawyers practicing law in Palo Alto, a city of only 50,000 people, \"the densest concentration of lawyers\" in the United States outside of Washington, D.C.\nBy the year 2000, large law firms from all over the world were rushing to establish offices in the mid-Peninsula region on or near Sand Hill Road, and Silicon Valley law firms had become global trendsetters in that they were the first legal services employers to adopt business casual apparel (in imitation of their startup clients). During this era, lawyers evolved from their relatively narrow conventional role as protectors of intellectual property into business advisers, intermediaries, and dealmakers, and thereby acquired great prominence in Silicon Valley. For young entrepreneurs new to the Valley's mysterious ways, their lawyer often served as their first coach, mentor, teacher, friend, and cheerleader who helped connect them to the Valley's startup ecosystem.\nAs of 2023, the San Jose-Sunnyvale-Santa Clara metropolitan area had the highest average wage for lawyers in the United States, at $268,570. \"Above the Law\" occasionally publishes lists of top-performing Silicon Valley law firms, which it calls the \"white sandal elite\", a parody of the \"white-shoe firm\" descriptor traditionally applied to certain East Coast professional services firms.\nRise of computer culture.\nThe Homebrew Computer Club was an informal group of electronic enthusiasts and technically minded hobbyists who gathered to trade parts, circuits, and information pertaining to DIY construction of computing devices. It was started by Gordon French and Fred Moore who met at the Community Computer Center in Menlo Park. They both were interested in maintaining a regular, open forum for people to get together to work on making computers more accessible to everyone.\nThe first meeting was held as of March 1975 at French's garage in Menlo Park, San Mateo County, California; which was on occasion of the arrival of the MITS Altair microcomputer, the first unit sent to the area for review by People's Computer Company. Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs credit that first meeting with inspiring them to design the original Apple I and (successor) Apple II computers. As a result, the first preview of the Apple I was given at the Homebrew Computer Club. Subsequent meetings were held at an auditorium at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center.\nAdvent of software.\nAlthough semiconductors are still a major component of the area's economy, Silicon Valley has been most famous in recent years for innovations in software and Internet services. Silicon Valley has significantly influenced computer operating systems, software, and user interfaces. Using money from NASA, the US Air Force, and ARPA, Douglas Engelbart invented the mouse and hypertext-based collaboration tools in the mid-1960s and 1970s while at Stanford Research Institute (now SRI International), first publicly demonstrated in 1968 in what is now known as The Mother of All Demos.\nEngelbart's Augmentation Research Center at SRI was also involved in launching the ARPANET (precursor to the Internet) and starting the Network Information Center (now InterNIC). Xerox hired some of Engelbart's best researchers beginning in the early 1970s. In turn, in the 1970s and 1980s, Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) played a pivotal role in object-oriented programming, graphical user interfaces (GUIs), Ethernet, PostScript, and laser printers.\nWhile Xerox marketed equipment using its technologies, for the most part its technologies flourished elsewhere. The diaspora of Xerox inventions led directly to 3Com and Adobe Systems, and indirectly to Cisco, Apple Computer, and Microsoft. Apple's Macintosh GUI was largely a result of Steve Jobs' visit to PARC and the subsequent hiring of key personnel. Cisco's impetus stemmed from the need to route a variety of protocols over Stanford University's Ethernet campus network.\nInternet age.\nCommercial use of the Internet became practical and grew slowly throughout the early 1990s. In 1995, commercial use of the Internet grew substantially and the initial wave of internet startups, Amazon.com, eBay, and the predecessor to Craigslist began operations. Silicon Valley is generally considered to have been the center of the dot-com bubble, which started in the mid-1990s and collapsed after the NASDAQ stock market began to decline dramatically in April 2000. During the bubble era, real estate prices reached unprecedented levels. For a brief time, Sand Hill Road was home to the most expensive commercial real estate in the world, and the booming economy resulted in severe traffic congestion.\nThe PayPal Mafia is sometimes credited with inspiring the re-emergence of consumer-focused Internet companies after the dot-com bust of 2001. After the dot-com crash, Silicon Valley continues to maintain its status as one of the top research and development centers in the world. A 2006 \"The Wall Street Journal\" story found that 12 of the 20 most inventive towns in America were in California, and 10 of those were in Silicon Valley. San Jose led the list with 3,867 utility patents filed in 2005, and number two was Sunnyvale, at 1,881 utility patents. Silicon Valley is also home to a significant number of \"Unicorn\" ventures, referring to startup companies whose valuation has exceeded $1\u00a0billion dollars.\nEconomy.\nA world-renowned technology hub, San Francisco Bay Area has the largest concentration of high-tech companies in the United States, at 387,000 high-tech jobs, of which Silicon Valley accounts for 225,300 high-tech jobs. Silicon Valley has the highest concentration of high-tech workers of any metropolitan area, with 285.9 out of every 1,000 private-sector workers. Silicon Valley has the highest average high-tech salary in the United States at $144,800. Largely a result of the high technology sector, the San Jose-Sunnyvale-Santa Clara, CA Metropolitan Statistical Area has the most millionaires and the most billionaires in the United States per capita, although the venture capital ecosystem has grown more geographically decentralized over time.\nThe region is the biggest high-tech manufacturing center in the United States. The unemployment rate of the region was 9.4% in January 2009 and has decreased to a record low of 2.7% as of August 2019. But in April 2020, when unemployment was at its peak, it stood at 13.7% and has since fallen to 5.7% in July 2021. Silicon Valley received 41% of all U.S. venture investment in 2011, and 46% in 2012. During the period from 2019 to 2021, Silicon Valley's share of U.S. venture capital investment dropped to 35.9%, but had surged back to 41% as of the first quarter of 2023.\nMore traditional industries also recognize the potential of high-tech development, and several car manufacturers have opened offices in Silicon Valley to capitalize on its entrepreneurial ecosystem. Manufacture of transistors was for a long time the core industry in Silicon Valley. The workforce was for the most part composed of Asian and Latino immigrants who were paid low wages and worked in hazardous conditions due to the chemicals used in the manufacture of integrated circuits. Technical, engineering, design, and administrative staffs were in large part well compensated.\nHousing.\nSilicon Valley has a severe housing shortage, caused by the market imbalance between jobs created and housing units built: from 2010 to 2015, many more jobs have been created than housing units built. (400,000 jobs, 60,000 housing units) This shortage has driven home prices extremely high, far out of the range of production workers. As of 2016 a two-bedroom apartment rented for about $2,500 while the median home price was about $1\u00a0million. The \"Financial Post\" called Silicon Valley the most expensive U.S. housing region. Homelessness is a problem with housing beyond the reach of middle-income residents; there is little shelter space other than in San Jose which, as of 2015, was making an effort to develop shelters by renovating old hotels.\n\"The Economist\" also attributes the high cost of living to the success of the industries in this region. Although, this rift between high and low salaries is driving many residents out who can no longer afford to live there. In the Bay Area, the number of residents planning to leave within the next several years has had an increase of 35% since 2016, from 34% to 46%.\nWealth.\nThe wealth inequality in Silicon Valley is more pronounced than in any other region of the United States. A 2023 report found that the aggregate household wealth of Silicon Valley (including ultra-high net worth individuals) was nearly $1.1 trillion, and less than 1% of the Valley's population held 36% of the wealth. Conversely, as of 2021, 23% of Silicon Valley residents were living below the poverty line. However, the meaning of the term \"poverty\" is dependent upon context; in Silicon Valley, it means something different because of the region's severe housing shortage and high housing prices. As of 2023, the low-income poverty threshold set by the California Department of Housing and Community Development for single-person households in the counties of San Francisco, San Mateo, and Marin was $104,400, followed by $96,000 for the county of Santa Clara. In contrast, the 2023 national low-income poverty threshold set by the U.S. Census Bureau for a single-person household was $14,891.\nNotable companies.\nThousands of high technology companies are headquartered in Silicon Valley. Among those, the following are in the Fortune 1000:\nAdditional notable companies headquartered in Silicon Valley (some of which are defunct, subsumed, or relocated) include:\nDemographics.\nA 1999 study by AnnaLee Saxenian for the Public Policy Institute of California reported that a third of Silicon Valley scientists and engineers were immigrants and that nearly a quarter of Silicon Valley's high-technology firms since 1980 were run by Chinese (17 percent) or Indian descent CEOs (7 percent). In addition, Saxenian's study found that successful immigrant entrepreneurs relied heavily on ethnic resources as they integrated into the Silicon Valley work culture and American society. There is a stratum of well-compensated technical employees and managers, including tens of thousands of \"single-digit millionaires\". This income and range of assets will support a middle-class lifestyle in Silicon Valley.\nGender.\nIn November 2006, the University of California, Davis released a report analyzing business leadership by women within the state. The report showed that although 103 of the 400 largest public companies headquartered in California were located in Santa Clara County (the most of all counties), only 8.8% of Silicon Valley companies had women CEOs. This was the lowest percentage in the state. (San Francisco County had 19.2% and Marin County had 18.5%.)\nSilicon Valley tech leadership positions are occupied almost exclusively by men. This is also represented in the number of new companies founded by women as well as the number of women-lead startups that receive venture capital funding. Wadhwa said he believes that a contributing factor is a lack of parental encouragement to study science and engineering. He also cited a lack of women role models and noted that most famous tech leaders\u2014like Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, and Mark Zuckerberg\u2014are men.\nAs of October 2014, some high-profile Silicon Valley firms were working actively to prepare and recruit women. \"Bloomberg\" reported that Apple, Facebook, Google, and Microsoft attended the 20th annual Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing conference to actively recruit and potentially hire female engineers and technology experts. The same month, the second annual Platform Summit was held to discuss increasing racial and gender diversity in tech. As of April 2015 experienced women were engaged in creation of venture capital firms which leveraged women's perspectives in funding of startups.\nAfter UC Davis published its \"Study of California Women Business Leaders\" in November 2006, some \"San Jose Mercury News\" readers dismissed the possibility that sexism contributed in making Silicon Valley's leadership gender gap the highest in the state. A January 2015 issue of \"Newsweek\" magazine featured an article detailing reports of sexism and misogyny in Silicon Valley. The article's author, Nina Burleigh, asked, \"Where were all these offended people when women like Heidi Roizen published accounts of having a venture capitalist stick her hand in his pants under a table while a deal was being discussed?\" Silicon Valley firms' board of directors are composed of 15.7% women compared with 20.9% in the S&amp;P 100.\nThe 2012 lawsuit \"Pao v. Kleiner Perkins\" was filed in San Francisco County Superior Court by executive Ellen Pao for gender discrimination against her employer, Kleiner Perkins. The case went to trial in February 2015. On March 27, 2015, the jury found in favor of Kleiner Perkins on all counts. Nevertheless, the case, which had wide press coverage, resulted in major advances in consciousness of gender discrimination on the part of venture capital and technology firms and their women employees. Two other cases have been filed against Facebook and Twitter.\nRace.\nA 2017 study showed that white males made up the majority of higher positions, with 58.7% of executive positions and 46.5% of managers. The second highest position holders were Asian men, with 16.3% of executive positions and 17.9% of managers. African/Black and Hispanic/Latino people had the lowest percentages in all categories.\n\"Harvard Business Review\" published an article in 2018 discussing diversity and inclusion and gave statistics on black employees along with advice to future black technicians. LeRon L. Barton, a black man who spent over two decades in Tech, gave an insight on his work experiences. He said he saw no one who looked like him in his profession and said he received many comments that he believed disregarded his skill such as being called the diversity hire. He described being isolated from his team, and constantly having to prove he could do the job he was hired for.\nSome of the most successful Black people in Silicon Valley include Roy Clay, the founder of Hewlett Packard's computing division who is considered the \"Godfather of Silicon Valley\"; Ken Coleman, the first Black recruiter at Hewlett and later an executive at Activision and Silicon Graphics; John W. Thompson, the first Black CEO of a major tech company, the enterprise security software provider Symantec, and the chairman of computing giant Microsoft replacing the founder Bill Gates; Robert F. Smith, former Goldman Sachs technology M&amp;A banker and founder of software private equity firm Vista Equity Partners; Charles Phillips, President of Oracle and CEO of Infor who coined the term \"enterprise software\" during his time as a technology banker at Morgan Stanley with Frank Quattrone and Mary Meeker; and Stacy Brown-Philpot, the first Black female tech CEO at online marketplace TaskRabbit. \nLate 2024 and early 2025 marked a shift in the discourse around DEI or diversity equity and inclusion initiatives in Silicon Valley. As many tech companies faced economic headwinds and pressure to reduce costs in the midst of falling valuations and rising interest rates, leading to widespread layoffs and budget scrutiny by investors, DEI programs were often the first thing out the door. \nStatistics.\nIn 2014, tech companies Google, Yahoo!, Facebook, Apple, and others, released corporate transparency reports that offered detailed employee breakdowns. In May, Google said 17% of its tech employees worldwide were women, and, in the U.S., 1% of its tech workers were black and 2% were Hispanic/Latino. June 2014 brought reports from Yahoo! and Facebook. Yahoo! said that 15% of its tech jobs were held by women, 2% of its tech employees were black and 4% Hispanic. Facebook reported that 15% of its tech workforce was female, and 3% was Hispanic and 1% was black.\nIn August 2014, Apple reported that 80% of its global tech staff was male and that, in the U.S., 54% of its tech jobs were staffed by Caucasians and 23% by Asians. Soon after, \"USA Today\" published an article about Silicon Valley's lack of tech-industry diversity, pointing out that it is largely white or Asian, and male. \"Blacks and Hispanics are largely absent,\" it reported, \"and women are underrepresented in Silicon Valley\u2014from giant companies to start-ups to venture capital firms.\" Civil rights activist Jesse Jackson said of improving diversity in the tech industry, \"This is the next step in the civil rights movement\" while T. J. Rodgers has argued against Jackson's assertions.\nAccording to a 2019 Lincoln Network survey, 48% of high-tech workers in Silicon Valley identify as Christians, with Roman Catholicism (27%) being its largest branch, followed by Protestantism (19%). The same study found that 16% of high-tech workers identify as nothing in particular, 11% as something else, 8% as Agnostics, and 7% as Atheists. Around 4% of high-tech workers in Silicon Valley identify as Jews or Buddhists, 3% as Hindus, 2% as Muslims and 1% as Satanists.\nMunicipalities.\nThe following Santa Clara County cities are traditionally considered to be in Silicon Valley (in alphabetical order):\nThe geographical boundaries of Silicon Valley have changed over the years. Historically, the term Silicon Valley was treated as synonymous with Santa Clara Valley, and then its meaning later evolved to refer to Santa Clara County plus adjacent regions in southern San Mateo County and southern Alameda County. However, over the years this geographical area has been expanded to include San Francisco County, Contra Costa County, and the northern parts of Alameda County and San Mateo County, this shift has occurred due to the expansion in the local economy and the development of new technologies.\nThe United States Department of Labor's Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages program defined Silicon Valley as the counties of Alameda, Contra Costa, San Francisco, San Mateo, Santa Clara, and Santa Cruz. In 2015, MIT researchers developed a novel method for measuring which towns are home to startups with higher growth potential and this defines Silicon Valley to center on the municipalities of Menlo Park, Mountain View, Palo Alto, and Sunnyvale.\nEducation.\nColleges and universities.\nSilicon Valley is associated with many colleges and universities in and near the Valley. The most prominent of those institutions are Stanford University, a private university located in the Valley, and the University of California, Berkeley, a public university located north of Silicon Valley. Both are considered to be world-leading institutions. In addition, San Jos\u00e9 State University plays a vital role in supplying Silicon Valley with a highly skilled and diverse workforce, particularly in engineering, business, and computer science. More broadly, colleges and universities in the area include:\nSecondary Education.\nFunding for public schools in upscale Silicon Valley communities such as Woodside is often supplemented by grants from private foundations set up for that purpose and funded by local residents. Schools in less affluent areas such as East Palo Alto must depend on state funding.\nMedia.\nIn 1980, \"Intelligent Machines Journal\" changed its name to \"InfoWorld\", and, with offices in Palo Alto, began covering the emergence of the microcomputer industry in the valley.\nLocal and national media cover Silicon Valley and its companies. CNN, \"The Wall Street Journal\", and Bloomberg News operate Silicon Valley bureaus out of Palo Alto. Public broadcaster KQED (TV) and KQED-FM, as well as the Bay Area's local ABC station KGO-TV, operate bureaus in San Jose. KNTV, NBC's local Bay Area affiliate \"NBC Bay Area\", is located in San Jose. Produced from this location is the nationally distributed TV Show \"Tech Now\" as well as the CNBC Silicon Valley bureau. San Jose-based media serving Silicon Valley include the \"San Jose Mercury News\" daily and the \"Metro Silicon Valley\" weekly.\nSpecialty media include \"El Observador\" and the \"San Jose / Silicon Valley Business Journal\". Most of the Bay Area's other major TV stations, newspapers, and media operate in San Francisco or Oakland. Patch.com operates various web portals, providing local news, discussion and events for residents of Silicon Valley. Mountain View has a public nonprofit station, KMVT-15. KMVT-15's shows include Silicon Valley Education News (EdNews)-Edward Tico Producer.\nCultural references.\nSome appearances in media, in order by release date:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "26977", "revid": "19376353", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26977", "title": "Stanford University", "text": "Private university in Stanford, California, US\nLeland Stanford Junior University, commonly referred to as Stanford University, is a private research university in Stanford, California, United States. It was founded in 1885 by railroad magnate Leland Stanford (the eighth governor of and then-incumbent United States senator representing California) and his wife, Jane, in memory of their only child, Leland Jr.\nThe university admitted its first students in 1891, opening as a coeducational and non-denominational institution. It struggled financially after Leland died in 1893 and again after much of the campus was damaged by the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. Following World War II, university provost Frederick Terman inspired an entrepreneurial culture to build a self-sufficient local industry (later Silicon Valley). In 1951, Stanford Research Park was established in Palo Alto as the world's first university research park. By 2021, the university had 2,288 tenure-line faculty, senior fellows, center fellows, and medical faculty on staff.\nThe university is organized around seven schools of study on an campus, one of the largest in the nation. It houses the Hoover Institution, a public policy think tank, and is classified among \"R1: Doctoral Universities \u2013 Very high research activity\". Students compete in 36 varsity sports, and the university is one of eight private institutions in the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC). Stanford has won 136 NCAA team championships, and was awarded the NACDA Directors' Cup for 25 consecutive years, beginning in 1994. Students and alumni have won 302 Olympic medals (including 153 gold).\nThe university is associated with 94 billionaires, 58 Nobel laureates, 33 MacArthur Fellows, 29 Turing Award winners, as well as 7 Wolf Foundation Prize recipients, 2 Supreme Court justices of the United States, and 4 Pulitzer Prize winners. Additionally, its alumni include many Fulbright Scholars, Marshall Scholars, Gates Cambridge Scholars, Rhodes Scholars, and members of the United States Congress.\nHistory.\nStanford University was founded in 1885 by Leland and Jane Stanford as a tribute to the memory of their only child, Leland Stanford Jr. The university officially opened in 1891 on the Stanfords' former Palo Alto farm. Modeled after the great Eastern universities, specifically Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, Stanford was often referred to as the \"Cornell of the West\" in its early years. This comparison was largely due to a significant portion of its faculty being former Cornell affiliates, including its first president, David Starr Jordan, and its second president, John Casper Branner. Both Cornell and Stanford were among the first to make higher education accessible, non-sectarian, and inclusive of women and men. Cornell is recognized as one of the first American universities to embrace this progressive approach to education, and Stanford quickly followed suit, solidifying its commitment to these ideals.\nFrom an architectural perspective, the Stanfords sought to distinguish their university by emulating the style of English university buildings while also incorporating elements of local California heritage. They specified in the founding grant that the buildings should \"be like the old adobe houses of the early Spanish days; they will be one-storied; they will have deep window seats and open fireplaces, and the roofs will be covered with the familiar dark red tiles.\" The Stanfords also hired renowned landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted, who previously designed the Cornell campus, to design the Stanford campus.\nWhen Leland Stanford died in 1893, the continued existence of the university was put in jeopardy due to a federal lawsuit against his estate, but Jane Stanford insisted the university remain in operation throughout the financial crisis. The university suffered major damage from the 1906 San Francisco earthquake; most of the damage was repaired, but a new library and gymnasium were demolished, and some original features of Memorial Church and the Quad were never restored. During the early-20th century, the university added four professional graduate schools. Stanford University School of Medicine was established in 1908 when the university acquired Cooper Medical College in San Francisco; it moved to the Stanford campus in 1959.\nThe university's law department, established as an undergraduate curriculum in 1893, was transitioned into a professional law school starting in 1908 and received accreditation from the American Bar Association in 1923. The Stanford University Graduate School of Education grew out of the Department of the History and Art of Education, one of the original twenty-one departments at Stanford, and became a professional graduate school in 1917. The Stanford Graduate School of Business was founded in 1925 at the urging of then-trustee Herbert Hoover. In 1919, The Hoover Institution on War, Revolution and Peace was started by Herbert Hoover to preserve artifacts related to World War I. The SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, established in 1962, performs research in particle physics.\nIn the 1940s and 1950s, Frederick Terman, an engineering professor who later became provost, encouraged Stanford engineering graduates to start their own companies and invent products. During the 1950s, he established Stanford Industrial Park, a high-tech commercial campus on university land. Also in the 1950s, William Shockley, co-inventor of the silicon transistor, recipient of the 1956 Nobel Prize for Physics, and later professor of physics at Stanford, moved to the Palo Alto area and founded a company, Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory. The next year, eight of his employees resigned and formed a competing company, Fairchild Semiconductor. The presence of so many high-tech and semiconductor firms helped to establish Stanford and the mid-Peninsula as a hotbed of innovation, eventually named Silicon Valley after the key ingredient in transistors. Shockley and Terman are both often described as the \"fathers of Silicon Valley\".\nIn the 1950s, Stanford intentionally reduced and restricted Jewish admissions, and for decades, denied and dismissed claims from students, parents, and alumni that they were doing so. Stanford issued its first institutional apology to the Jewish community in 2022 after an internal task force confirmed that the university deliberately discriminated against Jewish applicants, while also misleading those who expressed concerns, including students, parents, alumni, and the ADL. Stanford was once considered a school for \"the wealthy\", but controversies in later decades damaged its reputation. The 1971 Stanford prison experiment was criticized as unethical, and the misuse of government funds from 1981 resulted in severe penalties for the school's research funding, and the resignation of President Donald Kennedy in 1992.\nIn the 1960s, Stanford rose from a regional university to one of the most prestigious in the United States, \"when it appeared on lists of the \"top ten\" universities in America... This swift rise to performance [was] understood at the time as related directly to the university's defense contracts...\" Wallace Sterling was the President from 1949 to 1968 and he oversaw the growth of Stanford from a financially troubled regional university to a financially sound, internationally recognized academic powerhouse, \"the Harvard of the West\". Achievements during Sterling's tenure included:\nLand.\nMost of Stanford is on an campus, one of the largest in the United States. It is on the San Francisco Peninsula, in the northwest part of the Santa Clara Valley (Silicon Valley) approximately southeast of San Francisco and approximately northwest of San Jose. Stanford received $4.5 billion in 2006 and spent more than $2.1 billion in Santa Clara and San Mateo counties. In 2008, 60% of this land remained undeveloped.\nStanford's main campus includes a census-designated place within unincorporated Santa Clara County, although some of the university land (such as the Stanford Shopping Center and the Stanford Research Park) is within the city limits of Palo Alto. The campus also includes much land in unincorporated San Mateo County (including the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory and the Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve), as well as in the city limits of Menlo Park (Stanford Hills neighborhood), Woodside, and Portola Valley.\nThe central campus includes a seasonal lake (Lake Lagunita, an irrigation reservoir), home to the vulnerable California tiger salamander. As of 2012, Lake Lagunita was often dry and the university had no plans to artificially fill it. Heavy rains in January 2023 refilled Lake Lagunita to up to 8 feet of depth. Two other reservoirs, Searsville Lake on San Francisquito Creek and Felt Lake, are on more remote sections of the founding grant.\nCentral campus.\nThe central campus is adjacent to Palo Alto, bounded by El Camino Real, Stanford Avenue, Junipero Serra Blvd, and Sand Hill Road, off State Route 82. The United States Postal Service has assigned it two ZIP Codes: 94305 for campus mail and 94309 for P.O. box mail. It lies within area code 650.\nNon-central campus.\nOn the founding grant:\nOff the founding grant:\nFaculty residences.\nMany Stanford faculty members live in the \"Faculty Ghetto\", within walking or biking distance of campus. The Faculty Ghetto is composed of land owned by Stanford. Similar to a condominium, the houses can be bought and sold to other Stanford faculty but the land under the houses is leased for 51 years with the possibility of extensions. Houses in the \"Ghetto\" appreciate and depreciate, but not as rapidly as overall Silicon Valley values.\nOther uses.\nSome of the land is managed to provide revenue for the university such as the Stanford Shopping Center and the Stanford Research Park. Stanford land is also leased for a token rent by the Palo Alto Unified School District for several schools including Palo Alto High School and Gunn High School. El Camino Park, the oldest Palo Alto city park, is also on Stanford land. Stanford also has the Stanford Golf Course, and Stanford Red Barn Equestrian Center, used by Stanford athletics though the golf course can also be used by the general public.\nLandmarks.\nContemporary campus landmarks include the Main Quad and Memorial Church, the Cantor Center for Visual Arts and the Bing Concert Hall, the Stanford Mausoleum with the nearby Angel of Grief, Hoover Tower, the Rodin Sculpture Garden, the Papua New Guinea Sculpture Garden, the Arizona Cactus Garden, the Stanford University Arboretum, Green Library and the Dish. Frank Lloyd Wright's 1937 Hanna\u2013Honeycomb House and the 1919 Lou Henry Hoover House are both listed on the National Register of Historic Places. White Memorial Fountain (also known as \"The Claw\") between the Stanford Bookstore and the Old Union is a popular place to meet and to engage in the Stanford custom of \"fountain hopping\"; it was installed in 1964 and designed by Aristides Demetrios after a national competition as a memorial for two brothers in the class of 1949, William White and John White II, one of whom died before graduating and one shortly after in 1952.\nAdministration and organization.\nStanford is a private, non-profit university administered as a corporate trust governed by a privately appointed board of trustees with a maximum membership of 38. Trustees serve five-year terms (not more than two consecutive terms) and meet five times annually. A new trustee is chosen by the current trustees by ballot. The Stanford trustees also oversee the Stanford Research Park, the Stanford Shopping Center, the Cantor Center for Visual Arts, Stanford University Medical Center, and many associated medical facilities (including the Lucile Packard Children's Hospital).\nThe board appoints a president to serve as the chief executive officer of the university, to prescribe the duties of professors and course of study, to manage financial and business affairs, and to appoint nine vice presidents. Richard Saller became the interim president in September 2023. On April 4, 2024, the board of trustees announced that Jonathan Levin would become the thirteenth president on August 1, 2024. The provost is the chief academic and budget officer, to whom the deans of each of the seven schools report. Jenny Martinez became the fourteenth provost in October 2023. The university is organized into seven academic schools.\nThe schools of Humanities and Sciences (twenty-seven departments), Engineering (nine departments), and Sustainability (nine departments) have both graduate and undergraduate programs while the Schools of Law, Medicine, Education, and Business have graduate programs only. The powers and authority of the faculty are vested in the Academic Council, which is made up of tenure and non-tenure line faculty, research faculty, senior fellows in some policy centers and institutes, the president of the university, and some other academic administrators. But most matters are handled by the Faculty Senate, made up of 54 elected representatives of the faculty for 2021.\nThe Associated Students of Stanford University (ASSU) is the student government for Stanford and all registered students are members. Its elected leadership consists of the Undergraduate Senate elected by the undergraduate students, the Graduate Student Council elected by the graduate students, and the President and Vice President elected as a ticket by the entire student body. Stanford is the beneficiary of a special clause in the California Constitution, which explicitly exempts Stanford property from taxation so long as the property is used for educational purposes.\nEndowment, assets, and donations.\nStanford's endowment includes real estate and other investments valued at $36.5 billion as of August 2023, and is one of the four largest academic endowments in the United States. The endowment consists of $29.9 billion in a merged pool of assets and $6.6 billion of real estate near the main campus. Stanford is the largest landowner in the Silicon Valley Payouts from the endowment covered approximately 22% of university expenses in the 2023 fiscal year.\nSince inception, the university has been the beneficiary of large donations. The endowment began in 1885, six years before the opening of the university, when Leland Stanford and his wife Jane conveyed approximately $20 million to the university. The university's pioneering of technology intellectual property transfer created both direct investments and enabled a unique pipeline of mega-donors including from alumni-founded companies with Google (Sergey Brin and Larry Page), Nike (Phil Knight), Hewlett-Packard (David Packard and Bill Hewlett), and Sun Microsystems (Vinod Kohsla) as examples. Further, the university's global reputation and continued leadership in technology has attracted large donations from prominent figures such as the co-founder of Netscape (Jim Clark), founder of SAP SE (Hasso Plattner), co-founder of Andreessen Horowitz (Marc Andreessen and Laura Arillaga-Andreessen), chairman of Kleiner Perkins (John Doerr and his wife Ann).\nAcademics.\nAdmissions.\nStanford is considered by \"US News\" to be 'most selective' with an acceptance rate of 4%, one of the lowest\namong US universities. Half of the applicants accepted to Stanford have an SAT score between 1440 and 1570 or an ACT score between 32 and 35, typically with a GPA of 3.94 or higher. Admissions officials consider a student's grade point average to be an important academic factor, with emphasis on an applicant's high school class rank and letters of recommendation. In terms of non-academic materials as of 2019, Stanford ranks extracurricular activities, talent/ability and character/personal qualities as 'very important' in making first-time, first-year admission decisions, while ranking the interview, whether the applicant is a first-generation university applicant, legacy preferences, volunteer work and work experience as 'considered'. Of those students accepted to Stanford's Class of 2026, 1,736 chose to attend, of which 21% were first-generation college students.\nStanford's admission process is need-blind for U.S. citizens and permanent residents; while it is not need-blind for international students, 64% are on need-based aid, with an average aid package of $31,411. In 2012, the university awarded $126 million in need-based financial aid to 3,485 students, with an average aid package of $40,460. Eighty percent of students receive some form of financial aid. Stanford has a no-loan policy. For undergraduates admitted starting in 2015, Stanford waives tuition, room, and board for most families with incomes below $65,000, and most families with incomes below $125,000 are not required to pay tuition; those with incomes up to $150,000 may have tuition significantly reduced. Seventeen percent of students receive Pell Grants, a common measure of low-income students at a college. In 2022, Stanford started its first dual-enrollment computer science program for high school students from low-income communities, as a pilot project which then inspired the founding of the Qualia Global Scholars Program. Stanford plans to expand the program to include courses in Structured Liberal Education and writing.\nTeaching and learning.\nStanford follows a quarter system with the autumn quarter usually beginning in late September and the spring quarter ending in mid-June. The full-time, four-year undergraduate program has arts and sciences focus with high graduate student coexistence. Stanford is accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges with the latest review in 2023.\nResearch centers and institutes.\nStanford is classified among \"R1: Doctoral Universities \u2013 Very high research activity.\" The university's research expenditure in fiscal years of 2021/22 was $1.82 billion and the total number of sponsored projects was 7,900. By 2016, the Office of the Vice Provost and Dean of Research oversaw eighteen independent laboratories, centers, and institutes. Kathryn Ann Moler is the key person for leading those research centers for choosing problems, faculty members, and students. Funding is also provided for undergraduate and graduate students by those labs, centers, and institutes for collaborative research. Other Stanford-affiliated institutions include the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory (originally the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center), the Stanford Research Institute (an independent institution which originated at the university), the Hoover Institution (a conservative think tank), and the Hasso Plattner Institute of Design (a multidisciplinary design school in cooperation with the Hasso Plattner Institute of University of Potsdam that integrates product design, engineering, and business management education).\nStanford is home to the Martin Luther King Jr. Research and Education Institute, which grew out of and still contains the Martin Luther King Jr. Papers Project, a collaboration with the King Center to publish the King papers held by the King Center. It also runs the John S. Knight Fellowship for Professional Journalists and the Center for Ocean Solutions, which brings together marine science and policy to address challenges facing the ocean. It focuses on five points: climate change, overfishing, coastal development, pollution, and plastics. Together with UC Berkeley and UC San Francisco, Stanford is part of the Biohub, a new medical science research center founded in 2016 by a $600 million commitment from Facebook CEO and founder Mark Zuckerberg and pediatrician Priscilla Chan. This medical research center is working for designing advanced-level health care units.\nLibraries and digital resources.\nBy 2014, Stanford University Libraries (SUL) had twenty-four libraries in total. The Hoover Institution Library and Archives is a research center based on history of 20th-century. Stanford University Libraries (SUL) held a collection of more than 9.3 million volumes, nearly 300,000 rare or special books, 1.5 million e-books, 2.5 million audiovisual materials, 77,000 serials, nearly 6 million microform holdings, and thousands of other digital resources. The main library in the SU library system is the Green Library, which also contains various meeting and conference rooms, study spaces, and reading rooms. Lathrop Library (previously Meyer Library, demolished in 2015), holds various student-accessible media resources and houses one of the largest East Asia collections with 540,000 volumes. Stanford University Press, founded in 1892, published about 130 books per year has printed more than 3,000 books. It also has fifteen subject areas.\nOnline encyclopedia.\nThe \"Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy\" is a leading online encyclopedia and academic resource on the subject of philosophy, published and maintained by the university. The encyclopedia was founded by Stanford senior researcher Edward Zalta in 1995.\nArts.\nStanford is home to the Cantor Center for Visual Arts, a museum established with the help of art collector B. Gerald Cantor. It today consists of twenty-four galleries, sculpture gardens, terraces, and a courtyard first established in 1891 by Jane and Leland Stanford as a memorial to their only child. The university's collection of works by Auguste Rodin is among the largest in the world, with as many as 200 sculptures at the Cantor Center alone. These include an original bronze cast of \"The Thinker\" granted residence at Stanford by Cantor in 1988, with the university expected to attain full ownership sometime in the future. The Stanford \"Thinker\" has been loaned for viewing around the world and features across the university's iconography and culture, including the logo of the \"Encyclopedia of Philosophy.\"\nThe Thomas Welton Stanford Gallery, which was built in 1917, serves as a teaching resource for the Department of Art &amp; Art History as well as an exhibition venue. In 2014, Stanford opened the Anderson Collection, a new museum focused on postwar American art and founded by the donation of 121 works by food service moguls Mary and Harry Anderson. There are outdoor art installations throughout the campus, primarily sculptures, but some murals as well. The Papua New Guinea Sculpture Garden near Roble Hall features wood carvings and \"totem poles\".\nThe Stanford music department sponsors many ensembles, including five choirs, the Stanford Symphony Orchestra, Stanford Taiko, and the Stanford Wind Ensemble. Extracurricular activities include theater groups such as Ram's Head Theatrical Society, the Stanford Improvisors, the Stanford Shakespeare Company, and the Stanford Savoyards, a group dedicated to performing the works of Gilbert and Sullivan. Stanford is also host to ten \"a cappella\" groups, including the Mendicants (Stanford's first), Counterpoint (the first all-female group on the West Coast), the Harmonics, the Stanford Fleet Street Singers, Talisman, Everyday People, and Raagapella.\nReputation and rankings.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nStanford is highly ranked by \"U.S. News &amp; World Report\", \"Times Higher Education\", and \"QS World University Rankings\". As noted in The Wall Street Journal's 2024 rankings, \"the usual players are almost always going to come out on top: The Princetons, the Stanfords, the Yales, the Harvards. They will jockey for those first few spots on whatever ranking you happen to be looking.\"\nStandings in rankings.\nIn 2022, \"Washington Monthly\" ranked Stanford at 1st position in their annual list of top universities in the United States. In 2019, Stanford University took 1st place on Reuters' list of the \"World's Most Innovative Universities\" for the fifth consecutive year. Stanford Graduate School of Business has consistently been both the most selective business school in the world and consistently ranked 1st in the list of best business schools year-over-year consecutively by various reputed studies including \"Bloomberg Businessweek\" and \"U.S. News &amp; World Report\" for 2024. Stanford Law School is also consistently been amongst the two most selective law schools in the world and consistently ranked 1st in the list of best law schools year-over-year consecutively for 2024 in \"U.S. News &amp; World Report\".\nIn a 2022 survey by \"The Princeton Review\", Stanford was ranked 1st among the top ten \"dream colleges\" of America, and was considered to be the ultimate \"dream college\" of both students and parents. From polls of college applicants done by \"The Princeton Review\", every year from 2013 to 2020 the most commonly named \"dream college\" for students was Stanford; separately, parents, too, most frequently named Stanford their ultimate \"dream college\". The \"Academic Ranking of World Universities (ARWU)\" ranked Stanford second in the world (after Harvard) most years from 2003 to 2024. \"Times Higher Education\" recognizes Stanford as one of the world's \"six super brands\" on its \"World Reputation Rankings\", along with Berkeley, Cambridge, Harvard, MIT, and Oxford.\nDiscoveries and innovation.\nBusinesses and entrepreneurship.\nStanford is one of the most successful universities worldwide in creating companies and licensing its inventions to existing companies, and it is often considered the model for technology transfer. Stanford's Office of Technology Licensing is responsible for commercializing university research, intellectual property, and university-developed projects. The university is described as having a strong venture culture in which students are encouraged, and often funded, to launch their own companies. Companies founded by Stanford alumni generate more than $2.7 trillion in annual revenue and have created some 5.4 million jobs since the 1930s. When combined, these companies would form the tenth-largest economy in the world.\nSome notable companies closely associated with Stanford and their connections include:\n Co-founders of Hewlett-Packard, Bill Hewlett (BS 1934) and David Packard (BA 1934)\nStudent life.\nStudent body.\nStanford enrolled 6,996 undergraduate and 10,253 graduate students in the 2019\u20132020 school year. Women made up 50.4% of undergraduates and 41.5% of graduate students. In the same academic year, the freshman retention rate was 99%. Stanford awarded 1,819 undergraduate degrees, 2,393 master's degrees, 770 doctoral degrees, and 3270 professional degrees in the 2018\u20132019 school year. The four-year graduation rate for the class of 2017 cohort was 72.9%, and the six-year rate was 94.4%. The relatively low four-year graduation rate is a function of the university's coterminal degree (or \"coterm\") program, which allows students to earn a master's degree as a 1-to-2-year extension of their undergraduate program. In 2010, 15% of undergraduates were first-generation students.\nDormitories and student housing.\nBy 2013, 89% of undergraduate students lived in on-campus university housing. First-year undergraduates are required to live on campus, and all undergraduates are guaranteed housing for all four undergraduate years. Undergraduates live in 80 different houses, including dormitories, co-ops, row houses, and fraternities and sororities. At Manzanita Park, 118 mobile homes were installed as \"temporary\" housing from 1969 to 1991, but have become the site of newer dorms Castano, Kimball, Lantana, and the Humanities House, completed in 2015. Most student residences are just outside the campus core, within ten minutes (on foot or bike) of most classrooms and libraries. Some are reserved for freshmen, sophomores, or upper-class students and some are open to all four classes. Most residences are co-ed; seven are all-male fraternities, three are all-female sororities, and there is also one all-female non-sorority house, Roth House. In most residences, men and women live on the same floor, but some have single-gender floors.\nSeveral residences are considered \"theme\" houses; predating the current classification system are Columbae (Social Change Through Nonviolence, since 1970), and Synergy (Exploring Alternatives, since 1972). The Academic, Language, and Culture Houses include EAST (Education and Society Themed House), Hammarskj\u00f6ld (International Themed House), Haus Mitteleuropa (Central European Themed House), La Casa Italiana (Italian Language and Culture), La Maison Fran\u00e7aise (French Language and Culture House), Slavianskii Dom (Slavic/East European Themed House), Storey (Human Biology Themed House), and Yost (Spanish Language and Culture). Cross-Cultural Themed Houses include Casa Zapata (Chicano/Latino Theme in Stern Hall), Muwekma-tah-ruk (American Indian/Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian Themed House), Okada (Asian-American Themed House in Wilbur Hall), and Ujamaa (Black/African-American Themed House in Lagunita Court). Focus Houses include Freshman-Sophomore College (Academic Focus), Branner Hall (Community Service), Kimball (Arts &amp; Performing Arts), Crothers (Global Citizenship), and Toyon (Sophomore Priority).\nCo-ops or \"Self-Ops\" are another housing option. These houses feature cooperative living, where residents and eating associates each contribute work to keep the house running, such as cooking meals or cleaning shared spaces. These houses have unique themes around which their community is centered. Many co-ops are hubs of music, art and philosophy. The co-ops on campus are 576 Alvarado Row (formerly Chi Theta Chi), Columbae, Enchanted Broccoli Forest (EBF), Hammarskj\u00f6ld, Kairos, Terra (the unofficial LGBT house), and Synergy. Phi Sigma, at 1018 Campus Drive was formerly Phi Sigma Kappa fraternity, but in 1973 became a Self-Op. By 2015, 55 percent of the graduate student population lived on campus. Stanford also subsidizes off-campus apartments in nearby Palo Alto, Menlo Park, and Mountain View for graduate students who are guaranteed on-campus housing but are unable to live on campus due to a lack of space.\nAthletics.\nIn 2016, Stanford had sixteen male varsity sports and twenty female varsity sports, nineteen club sports, and about 27 intramural sports. The Stanford Tree is the Stanford Band's mascot and the unofficial mascot of Stanford University. Stanford's team name is the \"Cardinal\", referring to the vivid Stanford Cardinal Red color (not the common songbird as at several other schools); the university does not have an official mascot. The Tree has been called one of America's most bizarre and controversial college mascots; it regularly appears at the top of Internet \"worst mascot\" lists, but has also appeared on at least one list of top mascots. The Tree is a member of the Leland Stanford Junior University Marching Band (LSJUMB) and appears at football games, basketball games, and other events where the band performs.\nIn 1930, following a unanimous vote by the executive committee for the Associated Students, the athletic department adopted a new mascot (Indian). The Indian symbol and name were dropped by President Richard Lyman in 1972, after objections from Native American students and a vote by the student senate. Stanford is a member of the Atlantic Coast Conference in most sports, the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation in several other sports, and the America East Conference in field hockey with the participation in the inter-collegiate NCAA's Division I FBS. The two official colors of the university are Stanford Cardinal Red and Palo Alto Green.\nFrom 1930 until 1972, Stanford's sports teams had been known as the Indians and during the period from 1951 to 1972, Prince Lightfoot (portrayed by Timm Williams, a member of the Yurok tribe) was the official mascot. But in 1972, Native American students and staff members successfully lobbied University President Richard Lyman to abolish the \"Indian\" name along with what they had come to perceive as an offensive and demeaning mascot. Stanford's teams reverted unofficially to the name \"Cardinal\", the color that had represented the school before 1930.\nFrom 1972 until 1981, Stanford's official nickname was the Cardinal, but, during this time, there was debate among students and administrators concerning what the mascot and team name should be. A 1972 student referendum on the issue was in favor of restoring the Indian, while a second 1975 referendum was against. The 1975 vote included new suggestions, many alluding to the industry of the school's founder, tycoon Leland Stanford: the Robber Barons, the Sequoias, the Trees, the Cardinals, the Railroaders, the Spikes, and the Huns.\nIts traditional sports rival is the University of California, Berkeley. The winner of the annual \"Big Game\" between the Cal and Cardinal football teams gains custody of the Stanford Axe.\nAs of May 23, 2024, Stanford has won 136 NCAA team championships, more than any other school. Stanford has won at least one NCAA team championship each academic year for 48 consecutive years, from 1976\u201377 through to 2023\u201324. As of January 1, 2022, Stanford athletes have also won 529 NCAA individual championships. No other Division I school is within 100 of Stanford's total. Stanford have won 25 consecutive NACDA Directors' Cups, from 1994\u20131995 through to 2018\u201319, awarded annually to the most successful overall college sports program in the nation. 177 Stanford-affiliated athletes have won a total of 296 Summer Olympic medals (150 gold, 79 silver, 67 bronze), including 26 medals at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics and 27 medals at the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics. In the 2020 Tokyo Summer Olympics, Stanford-affiliated athletes won 26 medals, more than any other university.\nReligious life.\nStudents and staff at Stanford are of many different religions. The Stanford Office for Religious Life's mission is \"to guide, nurture and enhance spiritual, religious and ethical life within the Stanford University community\" by promoting enriching dialogue, meaningful ritual, and enduring friendships among people of all religious backgrounds. It is headed by a dean with the assistance of a senior associate dean and an associate dean.\nStanford Memorial Church, in the center of campus, has a Sunday University Public Worship service (UPW) usually in the \"Protestant Ecumenical Christian\" tradition where the Memorial Church Choir sings and a sermon is preached usually by one of the Stanford deans for Religious Life. UPW sometimes has multifaith services. In addition, the church is used by the Catholic community and the other Christian denominations at Stanford. Weddings happen most Saturdays and the university has allowed blessings of same-gender relationships and legal weddings.\nIn addition to the church, the Office for Religious Life has a Center for Inter-Religious Community, Learning, and Experiences (CIRCLE) on the third floor of Old Union. It offers a common room, an interfaith sanctuary, a seminar room, a student lounge area, and a reading room, as well as offices housing a number of Stanford Associated Religions (SAR) member groups and the Senior Associate Dean and Associate Dean for Religious Life. Most though not all religious student groups belong to SAR. The SAR directory includes organizations that serve atheist, Bah\u00e1'\u00ed, Buddhist, Christian, Hindu, Muslim, Jewish, and Sikh groups, though these groups vary year by year. The Windhover Contemplation Center was dedicated in October 2014, and was intended to provide spiritual sanctuary for students and staff in the midst of their course and work schedules; the center displays the \"Windhover\" paintings by Nathan Oliveira, the late Stanford professor and artist. Some religions have a larger and more formal presence on campus in addition to the student groups; these include the Catholic and Hillel communities at Stanford.\nGreek life.\nFraternities and sororities have been active on the Stanford campus since 1891 when the university first opened. In 1944, University President Donald Tresidder banned all Stanford sororities due to extreme competition. However, following Title IX, the Board of Trustees lifted the 33-year ban on sororities in 1977. Students are not permitted to join a fraternity or sorority until spring quarter of their freshman year. Stanford has thirty-one Greek organizations, including fourteen sororities and sixteen fraternities. Nine of the Greek organizations were housed (eight in University-owned houses and one, Sigma Chi, in their own house, although the land is owned by the university). Five chapters were members of the African American Fraternal and Sororal Association, eleven chapters were members of the Interfraternity Council, seven chapters belonged to the Intersorority Council, and six chapters belonged to the Multicultural Greek Council.\nStudent groups.\nStanford has more than 600 student organizations. Groups are often, though not always, partially funded by the university via allocations directed by the student government organization, the ASSU. These funds include \"special fees\", which are decided by a Spring Quarter vote by the student body. Groups span athletics and recreation, careers/pre-professional, community service, ethnic/cultural, fraternities and sororities, health and counseling, media and publications, the arts, political and social awareness, and religious and philosophical organizations. In contrast to many other selective universities, Stanford policy mandates that all recognized student clubs be \"broadly open\" for all interested students to join.\n\"The Stanford Daily\" is a student-run daily newspaper and has been published since the university was founded in 1892. The student-run radio station, KZSU Stanford 90.1 FM, features freeform music programming, sports commentary, and news segments; it started in 1947 as an AM radio station. The Stanford Review is a conservative student newspaper founded in 1987. \"The Fountain Hopper\" (\"FoHo\") is a financially independent, anonymous student-run campus rag publication, notable for having broken the Brock Turner story. Stanford hosts numerous environmental and sustainability-oriented student groups, including Students for a Sustainable Stanford, Students for Environmental and Racial Justice, and Stanford Energy Club. Stanford is a member of the Ivy Plus Sustainability Consortium, through which it has committed to best-practice sharing and the ongoing exchange of campus sustainability solutions along with other member institutions.\nStanford is also home to a large number of pre-professional student organizations, organized around missions from startup incubation to paid consulting. The Business Association of Stanford Entrepreneurial Students (BASES) is one of the largest professional organizations in Silicon Valley, with over 5,000 members. Its goal is to support the next generation of entrepreneurs. StartX is a non-profit startup accelerator for student and faculty-led startups. It is staffed primarily by students. Stanford Women In Business (SWIB) is an on-campus business organization, aimed at helping Stanford women find paths to success in the generally male-dominated technology industry. Stanford Marketing is a student group that provides students hands-on training through research and strategy consulting projects with Fortune 500 clients, as well as workshops led by people from industry and professors in the Stanford Graduate School of Business. Stanford Finance provides mentoring and internships for students who want to enter a career in finance. Stanford Pre Business Association is intended to build connections among industry, alumni, and student communities.\nStanford is also home to several academic groups focused on government and politics, including Stanford in Government and Stanford Women in Politics. The Stanford Society for Latin American Politics is Stanford's first student organization focused on the region's political, economic, and social developments, working to increase the representation and study of Latin America on campus. Former guest speakers include Jos\u00e9 Mujica and Gustavo Petro. Other groups include:\nSafety.\nStanford's Department of Public Safety is responsible for law enforcement and safety on the main campus. Its deputy sheriffs are peace officers by arrangement with the Santa Clara County Sheriff's Office. The department is also responsible for publishing an annual crime report covering the previous three years as required by the Clery Act. Fire protection has been provided by contract with the Palo Alto Fire Department since 1976. Murder is rare on the campus, although a few cases have been notorious, including the 1974 murder of Arlis Perry in Stanford Memorial Church, which was not solved until 2018. Also infamous was Theodore Streleski's murder of his faculty advisor in 1978.\nCampus sexual misconduct.\nIn 2014, Stanford was the tenth highest in the nation in \"total of reports of rape\" on their main campus, with 26 reports of rape. In Stanford's 2015 Campus Climate Survey, 4.7 percent of female undergraduates reported experiencing sexual assault as defined by the university, and 32.9 percent reported experiencing sexual misconduct. According to the survey, 85% of perpetrators of misconduct were Stanford students and 80% were men. Perpetrators of sexual misconduct were frequently aided by alcohol or drugs, according to the survey: \"Nearly three-fourths of the students whose responses were categorized as sexual assault indicated that the act was accomplished by a person or persons taking advantage of them when they were drunk or high, according to the survey. Close to 70 percent of students who reported an experience of sexual misconduct involving nonconsensual penetration and/or oral sex indicated the same.\"\nAssociated Students of Stanford and student and alumni activists with the anti-rape group Stand with Leah criticized the survey methodology for downgrading incidents involving alcohol if students did not check two separate boxes indicating they were both intoxicated and incapacity while sexually assaulted. Reporting on the Brock Turner rape case, a reporter from \"The Washington Post\" analyzed campus rape reports submitted by universities to the U.S. Department of Education, and found that Stanford was one of the top ten universities in campus rapes in 2014, with 26 reported that year, but when analyzed by rapes per 1000 students, Stanford was not among the top ten.\n\"People v. Turner\".\nOn the night of January 17\u201318, 2015, 22-year-old Chanel Miller, who was visiting the campus to attend a party at the fraternity Kappa Alpha Order, was sexually assaulted by Brock Turner, a nineteen-year-old freshman student-athlete from Ohio. Two Stanford graduate students witnessed the attack and intervened; when Turner attempted to flee the two held him down on the ground until police arrived. Stanford immediately referred the case to prosecutors and offered Miller counseling, and within two weeks had barred Turner from campus after conducting an investigation. Turner was convicted on three felony charges in March 2016 and in June 2016 he received a jail sentence of six months and was declared a sex offender, requiring him to register as such for the rest of his life; prosecutors had sought a six-year prison sentence out of the maximum 14 years that was possible. The case and the relatively lenient sentence drew nationwide attention. Two years later, the judge in the case, Stanford graduate Aaron Persky, was recalled by the voters.\nJoe Lonsdale.\nIn February 2015, Elise Clougherty filed a sexual assault and harassment lawsuit against venture capitalist Joe Lonsdale. Lonsdale and Clougherty entered into a relationship in the spring of 2012 when she was a junior and he was her mentor in a Stanford entrepreneurship course. By the spring of 2013 Clougherty had broken off the relationship and filed charges at Stanford that Lonsdale had broken the Stanford policy against consensual relationships between students and faculty and that he had sexually assaulted and harassed her, which resulted in Lonsdale being banned from Stanford for 10 years. Lonsdale challenged Stanford's finding that he had sexually assaulted and harassed her and Stanford rescinded that finding and the campus ban in the fall of 2015. Clougherty withdrew her suit that fall as well.\nNotable people.\nAward laureates and scholars.\nStanford's current community of scholars includes:\nStanford's current and former faculty includes 58 Nobel laureates, as well as 29 winners of the Turing Award, the so-called \"Nobel Prize in computer science\", comprising one-third of the awards given in its 44-year history. The university also has 27 ACM Fellows and is affiliated with four G\u00f6del Prize winners, four Knuth Prize recipients, ten IJCAI Computers and Thought Award winners, and fifteen Grace Murray Hopper Award winners for their work in the foundations of computer science. Stanford alumni have started many companies and, according to \"Forbes\", Stanford has produced the second highest number of billionaires of all universities. By 2022, 128 Stanford students or alumni have also been named Rhodes Scholars.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExplanatory notes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "26980", "revid": "910180", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26980", "title": "Sun Microsystems", "text": "American computer company, 1982\u20132010\nSun Microsystems, Inc., often known as Sun for short, was an American technology company that existed from 1982 to 2010 which developed and sold computers, computer hardware, software, and information technology services. Sun contributed significantly to the evolution of several key computing technologies, among them Unix, RISC processors, thin client computing, and virtualized computing. At its height, Sun's headquarters were in Santa Clara, California (part of Silicon Valley), on the former west campus of the Agnews Developmental Center.\nSun products included computer servers and workstations built on its own RISC-based SPARC processor architecture, as well as on x86-based AMD Opteron and Intel Xeon processors. Sun also developed its own storage systems and a suite of software products, including the Unix-based SunOS and later Solaris operating systems, developer tools, Web infrastructure software, and identity management applications. Technologies that Sun created include the Java programming language, the Java platform and Network File System (NFS).\nIn general, Sun was a proponent of open systems, particularly Unix. It was also a major contributor to open-source software, as evidenced by its $1 billion purchase, in 2008, of MySQL, an open-source relational database management system. Other notable Sun acquisitions include Cray Business Systems Division, Storagetek, and Innotek GmbH, creators of VirtualBox. On April 20, 2009, it was announced that Oracle would acquire Sun for US$7.4\u00a0billion, or US$5.6\u00a0billion net of Sun's cash and debt. The deal was completed on January 27, 2010.\nHistory.\nThe initial design for what became Sun's first Unix workstation, the Sun-1, was conceived by Andy Bechtolsheim when he was a graduate student at Stanford University in Palo Alto, California. Bechtolsheim originally designed the SUN workstation for the Stanford University Network communications project as a personal CAD workstation. It was designed around the Motorola 68000 processor with an advanced memory management unit (MMU) to support the Unix operating system with virtual memory support. He built the first examples from spare parts obtained from Stanford's Department of Computer Science and Silicon Valley supply houses.\nOn February 24, 1982, Scott McNealy, Andy Bechtolsheim, and Vinod Khosla, all Stanford graduate students, founded \"Sun Microsystems\". Bill Joy of Berkeley, a primary developer of the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD), joined soon after and is counted as one of the original founders. The company was the second, after rival Apollo Computer, to specialize in workstations. The name \"Sun\" is derived from the initials of the Stanford University Network (SUN). McNealy focused on operations; \"Fortune\" described him as \"notoriously cheap\". Sun was profitable from its first quarter in July 1982.\nBy 1983, Sun was known for producing 68k-based systems with high-quality graphics that were the only computers other than DEC's VAX to run 4.2BSD. It licensed the computer design to other manufacturers, which typically used it to build Multibus-based systems running Unix from UniSoft. Wall Street was an important early market, as were CAD/CAM, CAE, CASE, and other technical markets. By 1989, \"InfoWorld\" described Sun as \"the unqualified leader in the workstation arena\", and target of DEC and Hewlett-Packard (HP)'s own products.\nSun's initial public offering was in 1986 under the stock symbol \"SUNW\", for \"Sun Workstations\" (later \"Sun Worldwide\"). The symbol was changed in 2007 to \"JAVA\"; Sun stated that the brand awareness associated with its Java platform better represented the company's current strategy.\nSun's logo, which features four interleaved copies of the word \"sun\" in the form of a rotationally symmetric ambigram, was designed by professor Vaughan Pratt, also of Stanford. The initial version of the logo was orange and had the sides oriented horizontally and vertically, but it was subsequently rotated to stand on one corner and re-colored purple, and later blue.\nDot-com bubble and aftermath.\nDuring the dot-com bubble, Sun began making more money, with its stock rising as high as $250 per share. It also began spending much more, hiring workers and building itself out. Some of this was because of genuine demand, but much was from web start-up companies anticipating business that would never happen. In 2000, the bubble burst. Sales in Sun's important hardware division went into freefall as customers closed shop and auctioned high-end servers.\nSeveral quarters of steep losses led to executive departures, rounds of layoffs, and other cost cutting. In December 2001, the stock fell to the 1998, pre-bubble level of about $100. It continued to fall, faster than many other technology companies. A year later, it had reached below $10 (a tenth of what it was in 1990), but it eventually bounced back to $20. In mid-2004, Sun closed their Newark, California, factory and consolidated all manufacturing to Hillsboro, Oregon and Linlithgow, Scotland. In 2006, the rest of the Newark campus was put on the market.\nPost-crash focus.\nIn 2004, Sun canceled two major processor projects which emphasized high instruction-level parallelism and operating frequency. Instead, the company chose to concentrate on processors optimized for multi-threading and multiprocessing, such as the UltraSPARC T1 processor (codenamed \"Niagara\"). The company also announced a collaboration with Fujitsu to use the Japanese company's processor chips in mid-range and high-end Sun servers. These servers were announced on April 17, 2007, as the M-Series, part of the SPARC Enterprise series.\nIn February 2005, Sun announced the Sun Grid, a grid computing deployment on which it offered utility computing services priced at US$1 per CPU/hour for processing and per GB/month for storage. This offering built upon an existing 3,000-CPU server farm used for internal R&amp;D for over 10 years, which Sun marketed as being able to achieve 97% utilization. In August 2005, the first commercial use of this grid was announced for financial risk simulations which were later launched as its first software as a service product.\nIn January 2005, Sun reported a net profit of $19\u00a0million for fiscal 2005 second quarter, for the first time in three years. This was followed by net loss of $9\u00a0million on GAAP basis for the third quarter 2005, as reported on April 14, 2005. In January 2007, Sun reported a net GAAP profit of $126\u00a0million on revenue of $3.337\u00a0billion for its fiscal second quarter. Shortly following that news, it was announced that Kohlberg Kravis Roberts (KKR) would invest $700\u00a0million in the company.\nSun had engineering groups in Bangalore, Beijing, Dublin, Grenoble, Hamburg, Prague, St. Petersburg, Tel Aviv, Tokyo, Canberra and Trondheim.\nIn 2007\u20132008, Sun posted revenue of $13.8\u00a0billion and had $2\u00a0billion in cash. First-quarter 2008 losses were $1.68\u00a0billion; revenue fell 7% to $12.99\u00a0billion. Sun's stock lost 80% of its value November 2007 to November 2008, reducing the company's market value to $3\u00a0billion. With falling sales to large corporate clients, Sun announced plans to lay off 5,000 to 6,000 workers, or 15\u201318% of its work force. It expected to save $700\u00a0million to $800\u00a0million a year as a result of the moves, while also taking up to $600\u00a0million in charges.\nAcquisition by Oracle.\nOn September 3, 2009, the European Commission opened an in-depth investigation into the proposed takeover of Sun Microsystems by Oracle. On November 9, 2009, the Commission issued a statement of objections relating to the acquisition. Finally, on January 21, 2010, the European Commission approved Oracle's acquisition of Sun. The Commission's investigation showed that another open database, PostgreSQL, was considered by many users of this type of software as a credible alternative to MySQL and could to some extent replace the competitive strength that the latter currently represents in the database market.\nSun was sold to Oracle Corporation in 2009 for $5.6 billion.\nSun's staff were asked to share anecdotes about their experiences at Sun. A website containing videos, stories, and photographs from 27 years at Sun was made available on September 2, 2009.\nIn October, Sun announced a second round of thousands of employees to be laid off, blamed partially on delays in approval of the merger.\nThe transaction was completed in early 2010.\nIn January 2011, Oracle agreed to pay $46\u00a0million to settle charges that it submitted false claims to US federal government agencies and paid \"kickbacks\" to systems integrators.\nIn February 2011, Sun's former Menlo Park, California, campus of about was sold, and it was announced that it would become headquarters for Facebook. The sprawling facility, built around an enclosed courtyard, was nicknamed \"Sun Quentin\" by Facebook's employees. Notably, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg did not change the sign in the front of the campus, he simply had it turned it around and the company's logo put on the other side. The remains of the old Sun logo was left as a reminder of \"what happens when you take your eye off the ball.\"\nOn September 1, 2011, Sun India legally became part of Oracle. It had been delayed due to legal issues in Indian court.\nMajor stockholders.\nAs of May 11, 2009, the following shareholders held over 100,000 common shares of Sun and at $9.50 per share offered by Oracle, they received the amounts indicated when the acquisition closed.\nHardware.\nFor the first decade of Sun's history, the company positioned its products as technical workstations, competing successfully as a low-cost vendor during the Workstation Wars of the 1980s. It then shifted its hardware product line to emphasize servers and storage. High-level telecom control systems such as Operational Support Systems service predominantly used Sun equipment.\nMotorola-based systems.\nSun originally used Motorola 68000 family central processing units for the Sun-1 through Sun-3 computer series. The Sun-1 employed a 68000 CPU, the Sun-2 series, a 68010. The Sun-3 series was based on the 68020, with the later Sun-3x using the 68030.\nSPARC-based systems.\nIn 1987, the company began using \"SPARC (Scalable Processor ARChitecture)\", a RISC processor architecture of its own design, in its computer systems, starting with the Sun-4 line. SPARC was initially a 32-bit architecture (SPARC V7) until the introduction of the SPARC V9 architecture in 1995, which added 64-bit extensions.\nSun developed several generations of SPARC-based computer systems, including the SPARCstation, Ultra, and Sun Blade series of workstations, and the SPARCserver, Netra, Enterprise, and Sun Fire line of servers.\nIn the early 1990s the company began to extend its product line to include large-scale symmetric multiprocessing servers, starting with the four-processor SPARCserver 600MP. This was followed by the 8-processor SPARCserver 1000 and 20-processor SPARCcenter 2000, which were based on work done in conjunction with Xerox PARC. In 1995 the company introduced Sun Ultra series machines that were equipped with the first 64-bit implementation of SPARC processors (UltraSPARC). In the late 1990s the transformation of product line in favor of large 64-bit SMP systems was accelerated by the acquisition of Cray Business Systems Division from Silicon Graphics. Their 32-bit, 64-processor Cray Superserver 6400, related to the SPARCcenter, led to the 64-bit Sun Enterprise 10000 high-end server (otherwise known as \"Starfire\" or E10K).\nIn September 2004, Sun made available systems with UltraSPARC IV which was the first multi-core SPARC processor. It was followed by UltraSPARC IV+ in September 2005 and its revisions with higher clock speeds in 2007. These CPUs were used in the most powerful, enterprise class high-end CC-NUMA servers developed by Sun, such as the Sun Fire E15K and the Sun Fire E25K.\nIn November 2005, Sun launched the UltraSPARC T1, notable for its ability to concurrently run 32 threads of execution on 8 processor cores. Its intent was to drive more efficient use of CPU resources, which is of particular importance in data centers, where there is an increasing need to reduce power and air conditioning demands, much of which comes from the heat generated by CPUs. The T1 was followed in 2007 by the UltraSPARC T2, which extended the number of threads per core from 4 to 8. Sun has open sourced the design specifications of both the T1 and T2 processors via the OpenSPARC project.\nIn 2006, Sun ventured into the \"blade server\" (high density rack-mounted systems) market with the Sun Blade (distinct from the Sun Blade workstation).\nIn April 2007, Sun released the SPARC Enterprise server products, jointly designed by Sun and Fujitsu and based on Fujitsu SPARC64 VI and later processors. The \"M-class\" SPARC Enterprise systems include high-end reliability and availability features. Later T-series servers have also been badged SPARC Enterprise rather than Sun Fire.\nIn April 2008, Sun released servers with UltraSPARC T2 Plus, which is an SMP capable version of UltraSPARC T2, available in 2 or 4 processor configurations. It was the first CoolThreads CPU with multi-processor capability and it made possible to build standard rack-mounted servers that could simultaneously process up to massive 256 CPU threads in hardware (Sun SPARC Enterprise T5440), which is considered a record in the industry.\nSince 2010, all further development of Sun machines based on SPARC architecture (including new SPARC T-Series servers, SPARC T3 and T4 chips) is done as a part of Oracle Corporation hardware division.\nx86-based systems.\nIn the late 1980s, Sun also marketed an Intel 80386\u2013based machine, the Sun386i; this was designed to be a hybrid system, running SunOS but at the same time supporting DOS applications. This only remained on the market for a brief time. A follow-up \"486i\" upgrade was announced but only a few prototype units were ever manufactured.\nSun's brief first foray into x86 systems ended in the early 1990s, as it decided to concentrate on SPARC and retire the last Motorola systems and 386i products, a move dubbed by McNealy as \"all the wood behind one arrowhead\". Even so, Sun kept its hand in the x86 world, as a release of Solaris for PC compatibles began shipping in 1993.\nIn 1997, Sun acquired Diba, Inc., followed later by the acquisition of Cobalt Networks in 2000, with the aim of building \"network appliances\" (single function computers meant for consumers). Sun also marketed a Network Computer (a term popularized and eventually trademarked by Oracle); the JavaStation was a diskless system designed to run Java applications.\nAlthough none of these business initiatives were particularly successful, the Cobalt purchase gave Sun a toehold for its return to the x86 hardware market. In 2002, Sun introduced its first general purpose x86 system, the LX50, based in part on previous Cobalt system expertise. This was also Sun's first system announced to support Linux as well as Solaris.\nIn 2003, Sun announced a strategic alliance with AMD to produce x86/x64 servers based on AMD's Opteron processor; this was followed shortly by Sun's acquisition of Kealia, a startup founded by original Sun founder Andy Bechtolsheim, which had been focusing on high-performance AMD-based servers.\nThe following year, Sun launched the Opteron-based Sun Fire V20z and V40z servers, and the Sun Java Workstation W1100z and W2100z workstations.\nIn September 2005 Sun unveiled a new range of Opteron-based servers: the Sun Fire X2100, X4100 and X4200 servers. These were designed from scratch by a team led by Bechtolsheim to address heat and power consumption issues commonly faced in data centers. In July 2006, the Sun Fire X4500 and X4600 systems were introduced, extending a line of x64 systems that support not only Solaris, but also Linux and Microsoft Windows.\nIn January 2007 Sun announced a broad strategic alliance with Intel. Intel endorsed Solaris as a mainstream operating system and as its mission critical Unix for its Xeon processor\u2013based systems, and contributed engineering resources to OpenSolaris. Sun began using the Intel Xeon processor in its x64 server line, starting with the Sun Blade X6250 server module introduced in June 2007.\nIn May 2008 AMD announced its Operating System Research Center (OSRC) was expanding its focus to include optimization to Sun's OpenSolaris and xVM virtualization products for AMD processors.\nSoftware.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Plain image with caption/styles.css\"/&gt; \nLogo of SunSoft, the company's dedicated software division, established in 1991 \nAlthough Sun was initially known as a hardware company, its software history began with its founding in 1982; co-founder Bill Joy was one of the leading Unix developers of the time, having contributed the vi editor, the C shell, and significant work developing TCP/IP and the BSD Unix OS. Sun later developed software such as the Java programming language and acquired software such as StarOffice, VirtualBox and MySQL. In February 1991, the company established SunSoft, Inc., a wholly owned division of Sun dedicated to the development of operating systems and application software.\nSun used community-based and open-source licensing of its major technologies, and for its support of its products with other open source technologies. GNOME-based desktop software called Java Desktop System (originally code-named \"Madhatter\") was distributed for the Solaris operating system, and at one point for Linux. Sun supported its Java Enterprise System (a middleware stack) on Linux. It released the source code for Solaris under the open-source Common Development and Distribution License, via the OpenSolaris community. Sun's positioning includes a commitment to indemnify users of some software from intellectual property disputes concerning that software. It offers support services on a variety of pricing bases, including per-employee and per-socket.\nA 2006 report prepared for the EU by UNU-MERIT stated that Sun was the largest corporate contributor to open source movements in the world. According to this report, Sun's open source contributions exceed the combined total of the next five largest commercial contributors.\nOperating systems.\nSun is best known for its Unix systems, which have a reputation for system stability and a consistent design philosophy.\nSun's first workstation shipped with UniSoft V7 Unix. Later in 1982 Sun began providing SunOS, a customized 4.2BSD Unix, as the operating system for its workstations.\nSunOS included suntools, an early GUI window system.\nIn the late 1980s, AT&amp;T tapped Sun to help them develop the next release of their branded UNIX, and in 1988 announced they would purchase up to a 20% stake in Sun. UNIX System V Release 4 (SVR4) was jointly developed by AT&amp;T and Sun. Sun used SVR4 as the foundation for Solaris 2.x, which became the successor to SunOS 4.1.x (later retroactively named Solaris 1.x). By the mid-1990s, the ensuing Unix wars had largely subsided, AT&amp;T had sold off their Unix interests, and the relationship between the two companies was significantly reduced.\nIn the early 1990s, Brian P. Dougherty, founder of Berkeley Softworks (which would go on to be re-incorporated as the \"GeoWorks Corporation\") accused \nthe Java development team at Sun for studying GeoWorks's PC/GEOS operating system and incorporating features of PC/GEOS into their Unix-based operating system. Brian claimed that the object-oriented and flexible UI of PC/GEOS was \"to this day the most sophisticated UI technology ever built into an OS\".\nFrom 1992 Sun also sold Interactive Unix, an operating system it acquired when it bought Interactive Systems Corporation from Eastman Kodak Company. This was a popular Unix variant for the PC platform and a major competitor to market leader SCO UNIX. Sun's focus on Interactive Unix diminished in favor of Solaris on both SPARC and x86 systems; it was dropped as a product in 2001.\nSun dropped the Solaris 2.x version numbering scheme after the Solaris 2.6 release (1997); the following version was branded Solaris 7. This was the first 64-bit release, intended for the new UltraSPARC CPUs based on the SPARC V9 architecture. Within the next four years, the successors Solaris 8 and Solaris 9 were released in 2000 and 2002 respectively.\nFollowing several years of difficult competition and loss of server market share to competitors' Linux-based systems, Sun began to include Linux as part of its strategy in 2002. Sun supported both Red Hat Enterprise Linux and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server on its x64 systems; companies such as Canonical Ltd., Wind River Systems and MontaVista also supported their versions of Linux on Sun's SPARC-based systems.\nIn 2004, after having cultivated a reputation as one of Microsoft's most vocal antagonists, Sun entered into a joint relationship with them, resolving various legal entanglements between the two companies and receiving US$1.95\u00a0billion in settlement payments from them. Sun supported Microsoft Windows on its x64 systems, and announced other collaborative agreements with Microsoft, including plans to support each other's virtualization environments.\nIn 2005, the company released Solaris 10. The new version included a large number of enhancements to the operating system, as well as very novel features, previously unseen in the industry. Solaris 10 update releases continued through the next 8 years, the last release from Sun Microsystems being Solaris 10 10/09. The following updates were released by Oracle under the new license agreement; the final release is Solaris 10 1/13.\nPreviously, Sun offered a separate variant of Solaris called Trusted Solaris, which included augmented security features such as multilevel security and a least privilege access model. Solaris 10 included many of the same capabilities as Trusted Solaris at the time of its initial release; Solaris 10 11/06 included Solaris Trusted Extensions, which give it the remaining capabilities needed to make it the functional successor to Trusted Solaris.\nAfter the release of Solaris 10, the Solaris source code was opened under the CDDL free software license and developed in open with contributing Opensolaris community through SXCE that used SVR4 .pkg packaging and supported OpenSolaris releases that used IPS.\nFollowing the acquisition of Sun by Oracle, OpenSolaris continued to develop in open under illumos with illumos distributions.\nOracle Corporation continued to develop Solaris, reverting new development back to the proprietary licensing; its next release was Oracle Solaris 11 in November 2011.\nJava platform.\nThe Java platform was developed at Sun by James Gosling in the early 1990s with the objective of allowing programs to function regardless of the device they were used on, sparking the slogan \"Write once, run anywhere\" (WORA). While this objective was not entirely achieved (prompting the riposte \"Write once, debug everywhere\"), Java is regarded as being largely hardware\u2014and operating system\u2014independent.\nJava was initially promoted as a platform for client-side \"applets\" running inside web browsers. Early examples of Java applications were the HotJava web browser and the HotJava Views suite. However, since then Java has been more successful on the server side of the Internet.\nThe platform consists of three major parts: the Java programming language, the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), and several Java Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). The design of the Java platform is controlled by the vendor and user community through the Java Community Process (JCP).\nJava is an object-oriented programming language. Since its introduction in late 1995, it became one of the world's most popular programming languages.\nJava programs are compiled to byte code, which can be executed by any JVM, regardless of the environment.\nThe Java APIs provide an extensive set of library routines. These APIs evolved into the \"Standard Edition\" (Java SE), which provides basic infrastructure and GUI functionality; the \"Enterprise Edition\" (Java EE), aimed at large software companies implementing enterprise-class application servers; and the \"Micro Edition\" (Java ME), used to build software for devices with limited resources, such as mobile devices.\nOn November 13, 2006, Sun announced it would be licensing its Java implementation under the GNU General Public License; it released its Java compiler and JVM at that time.\nIn February 2009, Sun entered a battle with Microsoft and Adobe Systems, which promoted rival platforms to build software applications for the Internet. JavaFX was a development platform for music, video and other applications that builds on the Java programming language.\nOffice suite.\nIn 1999, Sun acquired the German software company Star Division and with it the office suite StarOffice, which Sun later released as OpenOffice.org under both GNU LGPL and the SISSL (Sun Industry Standards Source License). OpenOffice.org supported Microsoft Office file formats (though not perfectly), was available on many platforms (primarily Linux, Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, and Solaris) and was used in the open source community.\nThe principal differences between StarOffice and OpenOffice.org were that StarOffice was supported by Sun, was available as either a single-user retail box kit or as per-user blocks of licensing for the enterprise, and included a wider range of fonts and document templates and a commercial quality spellchecker. StarOffice also contained commercially licensed functions and add-ons; in OpenOffice.org these were either replaced by open-source or free variants, or are not present at all. Both packages had native support for the OpenDocument format.\nDerivatives of OpenOffice.org continue to be developed, these are LibreOffice, Collabora Online and Apache OpenOffice.\nVirtualization and datacenter automation software.\nIn 2007, Sun announced the Sun xVM virtualization and datacenter automation product suite for commodity hardware. Sun also acquired VirtualBox in 2008. Earlier virtualization technologies from Sun like \"Dynamic System Domains\" and \"Dynamic Reconfiguration\" were specifically designed for high-end SPARC servers, and Logical Domains only supports the UltraSPARC T1/T2/T2 Plus server platforms. Sun marketed \"Sun Ops Center\" provisioning software for datacenter automation.\nOn the client side, Sun offered virtual desktop solutions. Desktop environments and applications could be hosted in a datacenter, with users accessing these environments from a wide range of client devices, including Microsoft Windows PCs, Sun Ray virtual display clients, Apple Macintoshes, PDAs or any combination of supported devices. A variety of networks were supported, from LAN to WAN or the public Internet. Virtual desktop products included Sun Ray Server Software, Sun Secure Global Desktop and Sun Virtual Desktop Infrastructure.\nDatabase management systems.\nSun acquired MySQL AB, the developer of the MySQL database in 2008 for US$1\u00a0billion. CEO Jonathan Schwartz mentioned in his blog that optimizing the performance of MySQL was one of the priorities of the acquisition. In February 2008, Sun began to publish results of the MySQL performance optimization work. Sun contributed to the PostgreSQL project. On the Java platform, Sun contributed to and supported Java DB.\nOther software.\nSun offered other software products for software development and infrastructure services. Many were developed in house; others came from acquisitions, including Tarantella, Waveset Technologies, SeeBeyond, and Vaau. Sun acquired many of the Netscape non-browser software products as part a deal involving Netscape's merger with AOL. These software products were initially offered under the \"iPlanet\" brand; once the Sun-Netscape alliance ended, they were re-branded as \"Sun ONE\" (Sun Open Network Environment), and then the \"Sun Java System\".\nSun's middleware product was branded as the \"Java Enterprise System\" (JES), and marketed for web and application serving, communication, calendaring, directory, identity management and service-oriented architecture. Sun's Open ESB and other software suites were available free of charge on systems running Solaris, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, HP-UX, and Windows, with support available optionally.\nSun developed data center management software products, which included the \"Solaris Cluster\" high availability software, and a grid management package called \"Sun Grid Engine\" and firewall software such as SunScreen.\nFor Network Equipment Providers and telecommunications customers, Sun developed the Sun Netra High-Availability Suite.\nSun produced compilers and development tools under the \"Sun Studio\" brand, for building and developing Solaris and Linux applications.\nSun entered the software as a service (SaaS) market with zembly, a social cloud-based computing platform and Project Kenai, an open-source project hosting service.\nStorage.\nSun sold its own storage systems to complement its system offerings; it has also made several storage-related acquisitions.\nOn June 2, 2005, Sun announced it would purchase Storage Technology Corporation (StorageTek) for US$4.1\u00a0billion in cash, or $37.00 per share, a deal completed in August 2005.\nIn 2006, Sun introduced the Sun StorageTek 5800 System, the first application-aware programmable storage solution. In 2008, Sun contributed the source code of the StorageTek 5800 System under the BSD license.\nSun announced the Sun Open Storage platform in 2008 built with open source technologies.\nIn late 2008 Sun announced the Sun Storage 7000 Unified Storage systems (codenamed Amber Road). Transparent placement of data in the systems' solid-state drives (SSD) and conventional hard drives was managed by ZFS to take advantage of the speed of SSDs and the economy of conventional hard disks.\nOther storage products included Sun Fire X4500 storage server and SAM-QFS filesystem and storage management software.\nHigh-performance computing.\nSun marketed the Sun Constellation System for high-performance computing (HPC). Even before the introduction of the Sun Constellation System in 2007, Sun's products were in use in many of the TOP500 systems and supercomputing centers:\nThe \"Sun HPC ClusterTools\" product was a set of Message Passing Interface (MPI) libraries and tools for running parallel jobs on Solaris HPC clusters. Beginning with version 7.0, Sun switched from its own implementation of MPI to Open MPI, and donated engineering resources to the Open MPI project.\nSun was a participant in the OpenMP language committee. Sun Studio compilers and tools implemented the OpenMP specification for shared memory parallelization.\nIn 2006, Sun built the \"TSUBAME supercomputer\", which was until June 2008 the fastest supercomputer in Asia. Sun built \"Ranger\" at the Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC) in 2007. Ranger had a peak performance of over 500 TFLOPS, and was the sixth-most-powerful supercomputer on the TOP500 list in November 2008.\nSun announced an OpenSolaris distribution that integrated Sun's HPC products with others.\nStaff.\nNotable Sun employees included John Gilmore, Whitfield Diffie, Radia Perlman, Ivan Sutherland, Marc Tremblay, and Satya Nadella. Sun was an early advocate of Unix-based networked computing, promoting TCP/IP and especially NFS, as reflected in the company's motto The Network is the Computer, coined by John Gage. James Gosling led the team which developed the Java programming language. Jon Bosak led the creation of the XML specification at W3C.\nIn 2005, Sun Microsystems was one of the first Fortune 500 companies that instituted a formal social media program. Sun staff published articles on the company's blog site. Staff were encouraged to use the site to blog on any aspect of their work or personal life, with few restrictions placed on staff, other than commercially confidential material. Jonathan I. Schwartz was one of the first CEOs of large companies to regularly blog; his postings were frequently quoted and analyzed in the press.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was the founder of the Ayyubid dynasty and the first sultan of both Egypt and Syria. An important figure of the Third Crusade, he spearheaded the Muslim military effort against the Crusader states in the Levant. At the height of his power, the Ayyubid realm spanned Egypt, Syria, Upper Mesopotamia, the Hejaz, Yemen, and Nubia.\nAlongside his uncle Shirkuh, a Kurdish mercenary commander in service of the Zengid dynasty, Saladin was sent to Fatimid Egypt in 1164, on the orders of the Zengid ruler Nur ad-Din. With their original purpose being to help restore Shawar as the vizier to the teenage Fatimid caliph al-Adid, a power struggle ensued between Shirkuh and Shawar after the latter was reinstated. Saladin, meanwhile, climbed the ranks of the Fatimid government by virtue of his military successes against Crusader assaults and his personal closeness to al-Adid. After Shawar was assassinated and Shirkuh died in 1169, al-Adid appointed Saladin as vizier. During his tenure, Saladin, a Sunni Muslim, began to undermine the Fatimid establishment; following al-Adid's death in 1171, he abolished the Cairo-based Isma'ili Shia Muslim Fatimid Caliphate and realigned Egypt with the Baghdad-based Sunni Abbasid Caliphate.\nIn the following years, Saladin led forays against the Crusaders in Palestine, commissioned the successful conquest of Yemen, and staved off pro-Fatimid rebellions in Egypt. Not long after Nur ad-Din died in 1174, Saladin launched his conquest of Syria, peacefully entering Damascus at the request of its governor. By mid-1175, Saladin had conquered Hama and Homs, inviting the animosity of other Zengid lords, who were the official rulers of Syria's principalities; he subsequently defeated the Zengids at the Battle of the Horns of Hama in 1175 and was thereafter proclaimed the 'Sultan of Egypt and Syria' by the Abbasid caliph al-Mustadi. Saladin launched further conquests in northern Syria and Upper Mesopotamia, escaping two attempts on his life by the Assassins before returning to Egypt in 1177 to address local issues there. By 1182, Saladin had completed the conquest of Syria after capturing Aleppo but failed to take over the Zengid stronghold of Mosul.\nUnder Saladin's command, the Ayyubid army defeated the Crusaders at the decisive Battle of Hattin in 1187, capturing Jerusalem and re-establishing Muslim military dominance in the Levant. Although the Crusaders' Kingdom of Jerusalem persisted until the late 13th century, the defeat in 1187 marked a turning point in the Christian military effort against Muslim powers in the region. Saladin died in Damascus in 1193, having given away much of his personal wealth to his subjects; he is buried in a mausoleum adjacent to the Umayyad Mosque. Alongside his significance to Muslim culture, Saladin is revered prominently in Kurdish, Turkic, and Arab culture. He has frequently been described as the most famous Kurdish figure in history.\nEarly life.\nSaladin was born in Tikrit in present-day Iraq. His personal name was \"Yusuf\"; \"Salah ad-Din\" is a \"laqab\", an honorific epithet, meaning \"Righteousness of the Faith\". His family was of Kurdish ancestry, and had originated from the village of Ajdanakan near the city of Dvin in central Armenia. He was the son of a Kurdish mercenary, Najm ad-Din Ayyub. The Rawadiya tribe he hailed from had been partially assimilated into the Arabic-speaking world by this time.\nIn Saladin's era, no scholar had more influence than sheikh Abdul Qadir Gilani, and Saladin was strongly influenced and aided by him and his pupils. In 1132, the defeated army of Zengi, Atabeg of Mosul, found their retreat blocked by the Tigris River opposite the fortress of Tikrit, where Saladin's father, Najm ad-Din Ayyub served as the warden. Ayyub provided ferries for the army and gave them refuge in Tikrit. Mujahid ad-Din Bihruz, a former Greek slave who had been appointed as the military governor of northern Mesopotamia for his service to the Seljuks, reprimanded Ayyub for giving Zengi refuge and in 1137 banished Ayyub from Tikrit after his brother Asad ad-Din Shirkuh killed a friend of Bihruz. According to Baha ad-Din ibn Shaddad, Saladin was born the same night his family left Tikrit. In 1139, Ayyub and his family moved to Mosul, where Imad ad-Din Zengi acknowledged his debt and appointed Ayyub commander of his fortress in Baalbek. After the death of Zengi in 1146, his son, Nur ad-Din, became the regent of Aleppo and the leader of the Zengids.\nSaladin, who now lived in Damascus, was reportedly fond of the city, but information on his early childhood is scarce. About education, Saladin wrote, \"Children are brought up in the way in which their elders were brought up\". According to his biographers, Anne-Marie Edd\u00e9 and al-Wahrani, Saladin was able to answer questions on Euclid, the Almagest, arithmetic, and law, but this was an academic ideal. It was his knowledge of the Qur'an and the \"sciences of religion\" that linked him to his contemporaries; several sources claim that during his studies, he was more interested in religious studies than joining the military.&lt;ref name=\"Who2 Biography: Saladin, Sultan/Military Leader\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Another factor which may have affected his interest in religion was that, during the First Crusade, Jerusalem was taken by the Christians. In addition to Islam, Saladin knew the genealogies, biographies, and histories of the Arabs, as well as the bloodlines of Arabian horses. More significantly, he knew the \"Hamasah\" of Abu Tammam by heart. He spoke Kurdish and Arabic and knew Turkish and Persian.\nPersonality and religious leanings.\nAccording to Baha ad-Din ibn Shaddad (one of Saladin's contemporary biographers), Saladin was a pious Muslim\u2014he loved hearing Qur'an recitals, prayed punctually, and \"hated the philosophers, those that denied God's attributes, the materialists and those who stubbornly rejected the Holy Law.\" He was also a supporter of Sufism and a patron of khanqahs (Sufi hostels) in Egypt and Syria, in addition to madrasas that provided orthodox Sunni teachings. Above all else he was a devotee of jihad:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The sacred works [Koran, hadith, etc.] are full of passages referring to the jihad. Saladin was more assiduous and zealous in this than in anything else... Jihad and the suffering involved in it weighed heavily on his heart and his whole being in every limb; he spoke of nothing else, thought only about equipment for the fight, was interested only in those who had taken up arms, had little sympathy with anyone who spoke of anything else or encouraged any other activity.\nIn 1174, Saladin ordered the arrest of a Sufi mystic, Qadid al-Qaffas (), in Alexandria. In 1191, he ordered his son to execute the Sufi philosopher Yahya al-Suhrawardi, the founder of the Illuminationist current in Muslim philosophy, in Aleppo. Ibn Shaddad, who describes this event as part of his chapter on the sultan's piety, states that Al-Suhrawardi was said to have \"rejected the Holy Law and declared it invalid.\" After consulting with some of the \"ulama\" (religious scholars), Saladin ordered al-Suhrawardi's execution. Saladin also opposed the Order of Assassins, an extremist Isma'ili Shi'i sect in Iran and Syria, seeing them as heretics and as being too close with the Crusaders.\nSaladin welcomed Asiatic Sufis to Egypt and he and his followers founded and endowed many khanqahs and zawiyas of which al-Maqrizi gives a long list. But it is not yet clear what Saladin's interests in the khanqah actually were and why he specifically wanted Sufis from outside Egypt. The answers to these questions lie in the kinds of Sufis he wished to attract. In addition to requiring that the Sufis come from outside Egypt, the waqfiyya seems to have specified that they be of a very particular type: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The inhabitants of the khanqah were known for religious knowledge and piety and their baraka (blessings) was sought after... The founder stipulated that the khanqah be endowed for the Sufis as a group, those coming from abroad and settling in Cairo and Fustat. If those could not be found, then it would be for the poor jurists, either Shafi'i or Maliki, and Ash'ari in their creed.\nEarly expeditions.\nSaladin's military career began under the tutelage of his paternal uncle Asad ad-Din Shirkuh, a prominent military commander under Nur ad-Din, the Zengid emir of Damascus and Aleppo and the most influential teacher of Saladin. In 1163, the vizier to the Fatimid caliph al-Adid, Shawar, had been driven out of Egypt by his rival Dirgham, a member of the powerful Banu Ruzzaik tribe. He asked for military backing from Nur ad-Din, who complied and, in 1164, sent Shirkuh to aid Shawar in his expedition against Dirgham. Saladin, at age 26, went along with them. After Shawar was successfully reinstated as vizier, he demanded that Shirkuh withdraw his army from Egypt for a sum of 30,000 gold dinars, but he refused, insisting it was Nur ad-Din's will that he remain. Saladin's role in this expedition was minor, and it is known that he was ordered by Shirkuh to collect stores from Bilbais prior to its siege by a combined force of Crusaders and Shawar's troops.\nAfter the sacking of Bilbais, the Crusader\u2013Egyptian force and Shirkuh's army were to engage in the Battle of al-Babein on the desert border of the Nile, just west of Giza. Saladin played a major role, commanding the right-wing of the Zengid army, while a force of Kurds commanded the left, and Shirkuh was stationed in the centre. Muslim sources at the time, however, put Saladin in the \"baggage of the centre\" with orders to lure the enemy into a trap by staging a feigned retreat. The Crusader force enjoyed early success against Shirkuh's troops, but the terrain was too steep and sandy for their horses, and commander Hugh of Caesarea was captured while attacking Saladin's unit. After scattered fighting in little valleys to the south of the main position, the Zengid central force returned to the offensive; Saladin joined in from the rear.\nThe battle ended in a Zengid victory, and Saladin is credited with having helped Shirkuh in one of the \"most remarkable victories in recorded history\", according to Ibn al-Athir, although more of Shirkuh's men were killed and the battle is considered by most sources as not a total victory. Saladin and Shirkuh moved towards Alexandria where they were welcomed, given money and arms, and provided a base. Faced by a superior Crusader\u2013Egyptian force attempting to besiege the city, Shirkuh split his army. He and the bulk of his force withdrew from Alexandria, while Saladin was left with the task of guarding the city, where he was besieged.\nIn Egypt.\nVizier of Egypt.\nShirkuh was in a power struggle over Egypt with Shawar and Amalric I of Jerusalem in which Shawar requested Amalric's assistance. In 1169, Shawar was reportedly assassinated by Saladin, and Shirkuh died later that year. Following his death, a number of candidates were considered for the role of vizier to al-Adid, most of whom were ethnic Kurds. Their ethnic solidarity came to shape the Ayyubid family's actions in their political career. Saladin and his close associates were wary of Turkish influence. On one occasion Isa al-Hakkari, a Kurdish lieutenant of Saladin, urged a candidate for the viziership, Emir Qutb ad-Din al-Hadhbani, to step aside by arguing that \"both you and Saladin are Kurds and you will not let the power pass into the hands of the Turks\". Nur ad-Din chose a successor for Shirkuh, but al-Adid appointed Saladin to replace Shawar as vizier.\nThe reasoning behind the Shia caliph al-Adid's selection of Saladin, a Sunni, varies. Ibn al-Athir claims that the caliph chose him after being told by his advisers that \"there is no one weaker or younger\" than Saladin, and \"not one of the emirs [commanders] obeyed him or served him\". However, according to this version, after some bargaining, he was eventually accepted by the majority of the emirs. Al-Adid's advisers were also suspected of promoting Saladin in an attempt to split the Syria-based Zengids. Al-Wahrani wrote that Saladin was selected because of the reputation of his family in their \"generosity and military prowess\". Imad ad-Din wrote that after the brief mourning period for Shirkuh, during which \"opinions differed\", the Zengid emirs decided upon Saladin and forced the caliph to \"invest him as vizier\". Although positions were complicated by rival Muslim leaders, the bulk of the Syrian commanders supported Saladin because of his role in the Egyptian expedition, in which he gained a record of military qualifications.\nInaugurated as vizier on 26 March, Saladin repented \"wine-drinking and turned from frivolity to assume the dress of religion\", according to Arabic sources of the time. Having gained more power and independence than ever before in his career, he still faced the issue of ultimate loyalty between al-Adid and Nur ad-Din. Later in the year, a group of Egyptian soldiers and emirs attempted to assassinate Saladin, but having already known of their intentions thanks to his intelligence chief Ali ibn Safyan, he had the chief conspirator, Naji, Mu'tamin al-Khilafa\u2014the civilian controller of the Fatimid Palace\u2014arrested and killed. The day after, 50,000 Black African soldiers from the regiments of the Fatimid army opposed to Saladin's rule, along with Egyptian emirs and commoners, staged a revolt. By 23 August, Saladin had decisively quelled the uprising, and never again had to face a military challenge from Cairo.\nTowards the end of 1169, Saladin, with reinforcements from Nur ad-Din, defeated a massive Crusader-Byzantine force near Damietta. Afterwards, in the spring of 1170, Nur ad-Din sent Saladin's father to Egypt in compliance with Saladin's request, as well as encouragement from the Baghdad-based Abbasid caliph, al-Mustanjid, who aimed to pressure Saladin in deposing his rival caliph, al-Ad. Saladin himself had been strengthening his hold on Egypt and widening his support base there. He began granting his family members high-ranking positions in the region; he ordered the construction of a college for the Maliki branch of Sunni Islam in the city, as well as one for the Shafi'i denomination to which he belonged in al-Fustat.\nAfter establishing himself in Egypt, Saladin launched a campaign against the Crusaders, besieging Darum in 1170. Amalric withdrew his Templar garrison from Gaza to assist him in defending Darum, but Saladin evaded their force and captured Gaza in 1187. In 1191 Saladin destroyed the fortifications in Gaza built by King Baldwin III for the Knights Templar. It is unclear exactly when, but during that same year, he attacked and captured the Crusader castle of Eilat, built on an island off the head of the Gulf of Aqaba. It did not pose a threat to the passage of the Muslim navy but could harass smaller parties of Muslim ships, and Saladin decided to clear it from his path.\nSultan of Egypt.\nAccording to Imad ad-Din, Nur ad-Din wrote to Saladin in June 1171, telling him to reestablish the Abbasid caliphate in Egypt, which Saladin coordinated two months later after additional encouragement by Najm ad-Din al-Khabushani, the Shafi'i \"faqih\", who vehemently opposed Shia rule in the country. Several Egyptian emirs were thus killed, but al-Adid was told that they were killed for rebelling against him. He then fell ill or was poisoned according to one account. While ill, he asked Saladin to pay him a visit to request that he take care of his young children, but Saladin refused, fearing treachery against the Abbasids, and is said to have regretted his action after realizing what al-Adid had wanted. He died on 13 September, and five days later, the Abbasid \"khutba\" was pronounced in Cairo and al-Fustat, proclaiming al-Mustadi as caliph.\nOn 25 September, Saladin left Cairo to take part in a joint attack on Kerak and Montr\u00e9al, the desert castles of the Kingdom of Jerusalem, with Nur ad-Din who would attack from Syria. Prior to arriving at Montreal, Saladin however withdrew back to Cairo as he received the reports that in his absence the Crusader leaders had increased their support to the traitors inside Egypt to attack Saladin from within and lessen his power, especially the Fatimid who started plotting to restore their past glory. Because of this, Nur ad-Din went on alone.\nDuring the summer of 1173, a Nubian army along with a contingent of Armenian former Fatimid troops were reported on the Egyptian border, preparing for a siege against Aswan. The emir of the city had requested Saladin's assistance and was given reinforcements under Turan-Shah, Saladin's brother. Consequently, the Nubians departed; but returned in 1173 and were again driven off. This time, Egyptian forces advanced from Aswan and captured the Nubian town of Ibrim. Saladin sent a gift to Nur ad-Din, who had been his friend and teacher, 60,000 dinars, \"wonderful manufactured goods\", some jewels, and an elephant. While transporting these goods to Damascus, Saladin took the opportunity to ravage the Crusader countryside. He did not press an attack against the desert castles but attempted to drive out the Muslim Bedouins who lived in Crusader territory with the aim of depriving the Franks of guides.\nOn 31 July 1173, Saladin's father Ayyub was wounded in a horse-riding accident, ultimately causing his death on 9 August. In 1174, Saladin sent Turan-Shah to conquer Yemen to allocate it and its port Aden to the territories of the Ayyubid Dynasty.\nConquest of Syria.\nConquest of Damascus.\nIn the early summer of 1174, Nur ad-Din was mustering an army, sending summons to Mosul, Diyar Bakr, and the Jazira in an apparent preparation of an attack against Saladin's Egypt. The Ayyubids held a council upon the revelation of these preparations to discuss the possible threat and Saladin collected his own troops outside Cairo. On 15 May, Nur ad-Din died after falling ill the previous week and his power was handed to his eleven-year-old son as-Salih Ismail al-Malik. His death left Saladin with political independence and in a letter to as-Salih, he promised to \"act as a sword\" against his enemies and referred to the death of his father as an \"earthquake shock\".\nIn the wake of Nur ad-Din's death, Saladin faced a difficult decision; he could move his army against the Crusaders from Egypt or wait until invited by as-Salih in Syria to come to his aid and launch a war from there. He could also take it upon himself to annex Syria before it could possibly fall into the hands of a rival, but he feared that attacking a land that formerly belonged to his master\u2014forbidden in the Muslim principles in which he believed\u2014could portray him as hypocritical, thus making him unsuitable for leading the war against the Crusaders. Saladin saw that in order to acquire Syria, he needed either an invitation from as-Salih or to warn him that potential anarchy could give rise to danger from the Crusaders.\nWhen as-Salih was removed to Aleppo in August, Gumushtigin, the emir of the city and a captain of Nur ad-Din's veterans assumed guardianship over him. The emir prepared to unseat all his rivals in Syria and the Jazira, beginning with Damascus. In this emergency, the emir of Damascus appealed to Saif ad-Din of Mosul (a cousin of Gumushtigin) for assistance against Aleppo, but he refused, forcing the Syrians to request the aid of Saladin, who complied. Saladin rode across the desert with 700 picked horsemen, passing through al-Kerak then reaching Bosra. According to his own account, was joined by \"emirs, soldiers, and Bedouins\u2014the emotions of their hearts to be seen on their faces.\" On 23 November, he arrived in Damascus amid general acclamation and rested at his father's old home there, until the gates of the Citadel of Damascus, whose commander Raihan initially refused to surrender, were opened to Saladin four days later, after a brief siege by his brother Tughtakin ibn Ayyub. He installed himself in the castle and received the homage and salutations of the inhabitants.\nFurther conquests in Syria.\nLeaving his brother Tughtakin ibn Ayyub as Governor of Damascus, Saladin proceeded to reduce other cities that had belonged to Nur ad-Din, but were now practically independent. His army conquered Hama with relative ease, but avoided attacking Homs because of the strength of its citadel. Saladin moved north towards Aleppo, besieging it on 30 December after Gumushtigin refused to abdicate his throne. As-Salih, fearing capture by Saladin, came out of his palace and appealed to the inhabitants not to surrender him and the city to the invading force. One of Saladin's chroniclers claimed \"the people came under his spell\".\nGumushtigin requested Rashid ad-Din Sinan, chief \"da'i\" of the Assassins of Syria, who were already at odds with Saladin since he replaced the Fatimids of Egypt, to assassinate Saladin in his camp. On 11 May 1175, a group of thirteen Assassins easily gained admission into Saladin's camp, but were detected immediately before they carried out their attack by Nasih ad-Din Khumartekin of Abu Qubays. One was killed by one of Saladin's generals and the others were slain while trying to escape. To deter Saladin's progress, Raymond of Tripoli gathered his forces by Nahr al-Kabir, where they were well placed for an attack on Muslim territory. Saladin later moved toward Homs instead, but retreated after being told a relief force was being sent to the city by Saif ad-Din.\nMeanwhile, Saladin's rivals in Syria and Jazira waged a propaganda war against him, claiming he had \"forgotten his own condition [servant of Nur ad-Din]\" and showed no gratitude for his old master by besieging his son, rising \"in rebellion against his Lord\". Saladin aimed to counter this propaganda by ending the siege, claiming that he was defending Islam from the Crusaders; his army returned to Hama to engage a Crusader force there. The Crusaders withdrew beforehand and Saladin proclaimed it \"a victory opening the gates of men's hearts\". Soon after, Saladin entered Homs and captured its citadel in March 1175, after stubborn resistance from its defenders.\nSaladin's successes alarmed Saif ad-Din. As head of the Zengids, including Gumushtigin, he regarded Syria and Mesopotamia as his family estate and was angered when Saladin attempted to usurp his dynasty's holdings. Saif ad-Din mustered a large army and dispatched it to Aleppo, whose defenders anxiously had awaited them. The combined forces of Mosul and Aleppo marched against Saladin in Hama. Heavily outnumbered, Saladin initially attempted to make terms with the Zengids by abandoning all conquests north of the Damascus province, but they refused, insisting he return to Egypt. Seeing that confrontation was unavoidable, Saladin prepared for battle, taking up a superior position at the Horns of Hama, hills by the gorge of the Orontes River. On 13 April 1175, the Zengid troops marched to attack his forces, but soon found themselves surrounded by Saladin's Ayyubid veterans, who crushed them. The battle ended in a decisive victory for Saladin, who pursued the Zengid fugitives to the gates of Aleppo, forcing as-Salih's advisers to recognize Saladin's control of the provinces of Damascus, Homs, and Hama, as well as a number of towns outside Aleppo such as Ma'arat al-Numan.\nAfter his victory against the Zengids, Saladin proclaimed himself king and suppressed the name of as-Salih in Friday prayers and Muslim coinage. From then on, he ordered prayers in all the mosques of Syria and Egypt as the sovereign king and he issued at the Cairo mint gold coins bearing his official title\u2014\"al-Malik an-Nasir Yusuf Ayyub, ala ghaya\" \"the King Strong to Aid, Joseph son of Job; exalted be the standard.\" The Abbasid caliph in Baghdad graciously welcomed Saladin's assumption of power and declared him \"Sultan of Egypt and Syria\". The Battle of Hama did not end the contest for power between the Ayyubids and the Zengids, with the final confrontation occurring in the spring of 1176. Saladin had gathered massive reinforcements from Egypt while Saif ad-Din was levying troops among the minor states of Diyarbakir and al-Jazira. When Saladin crossed the Orontes, leaving Hama, the sun was eclipsed. He viewed this as an omen, but he continued his march north. He reached the Sultan's Mound, roughly from Aleppo, where his forces encountered Saif ad-Din's army. A hand-to-hand fight ensued and the Zengids managed to plough Saladin's left-wing, driving it before him when Saladin himself charged at the head of the Zengid guard. The Zengid forces panicked and most of Saif ad-Din's officers ended up being killed or captured\u2014Saif ad-Din narrowly escaped. The Zengid army's camp, horses, baggage, tents, and stores were seized by the Ayyubids. The Zengid prisoners of war, however, were given gifts and freed. All of the booty from the Ayyubid victory was accorded to the army, Saladin not keeping anything himself.\nHe continued towards Aleppo, which still closed its gates to him, halting before the city. On the way, his army took Buza'a and then captured Manbij. From there, they headed west to besiege the fortress of A'zaz on 15 May. Several days later, while Saladin was resting in one of his captain's tents, an Assassin rushed forward at him and struck at his head with a knife. The cap of his head armour was not penetrated and he managed to grip the Assassin's hand\u2014the dagger only slashing his gambeson\u2014and the assailant was soon killed. Saladin was unnerved at the attempt on his life, which he accused Gumushtugin and the Assassins of plotting, and so increased his efforts in the siege.\nA'zaz capitulated on 21 June, and Saladin then hurried his forces to Aleppo to punish Gumushtigin. His assaults were again resisted, but he managed to secure not only a truce, but a mutual alliance with Aleppo, in which Gumushtigin and as-Salih were allowed to continue their hold on the city, and in return, they recognized Saladin as the sovereign over all of the dominions he conquered. The \"emirs\" of Mardin and Keyfa, the Muslim allies of Aleppo, also recognised Saladin as the King of Syria. When the treaty was concluded, the younger sister of as-Salih came to Saladin and requested the return of the Fortress of A'zaz; he complied and escorted her back to the gates of Aleppo with numerous presents.\nCampaign against the Assassins.\nSaladin had by now agreed to truces with his Zengid rivals and the Kingdom of Jerusalem (the latter occurred in the summer of 1175), but faced a threat from the Isma'ili sect known as the Assassins, led by Rashid ad-Din Sinan. Based in the an-Nusayriyah Mountains, they commanded nine fortresses, all built on high elevations. As soon as he dispatched the bulk of his troops to Egypt, Saladin led his army into the an-Nusayriyah range in August 1176. He retreated the same month, after laying waste to the countryside, but failing to conquer any of the forts. Most Muslim historians claim that Saladin's uncle, the governor of Hama, mediated a peace agreement between him and Sinan.\nSaladin had his guards supplied with link lights and had chalk and cinders strewed around his tent outside Masyaf\u2014which he was besieging\u2014to detect any footsteps by the Assassins. According to this version, one night Saladin's guards noticed a spark glowing down the hill of Masyaf and then vanishing among the Ayyubid tents. Presently, Saladin awoke to find a figure leaving the tent. He saw that the lamps were displaced and beside his bed laid hot scones of the shape peculiar to the Assassins with a note at the top pinned by a poisoned dagger. The note threatened that he would be killed if he did not withdraw from his assault. Saladin gave a loud cry, exclaiming that Sinan himself was the figure that had left the tent.\nAnother version claims that Saladin hastily withdrew his troops from Masyaf because they were urgently needed to fend off a Crusader force in the vicinity of Mount Lebanon. In reality, Saladin sought to form an alliance with Sinan and his Assassins, consequently depriving the Crusaders of a potent ally against him. Viewing the expulsion of the Crusaders as a mutual benefit and priority, Saladin and Sinan maintained cooperative relations afterwards, the latter dispatching contingents of his forces to bolster Saladin's army in a number of decisive subsequent battlefronts.\nReturn to Cairo and forays in Palestine.\nAfter leaving the an-Nusayriyah Mountains, Saladin returned to Damascus and had his Syrian soldiers return home. He left Turan Shah in command of Syria and left for Egypt with only his personal followers, reaching Cairo on 22 September. Having been absent for roughly two years, he had much to organize and supervise in Egypt, namely fortifying and reconstructing Cairo. The city walls were repaired and their extensions laid out, while the construction of the Cairo Citadel was commenced. The deep Bir Yusuf (\"Joseph's Well\") was built on Saladin's orders. The chief public work he commissioned outside of Cairo was the large bridge at Giza, which was intended to form an outwork of defence against a potential Moorish invasion.\nSaladin remained in Cairo supervising its improvements, building colleges such as the Madrasa of the Sword Makers and ordering the internal administration of the country. In November 1177, he set out upon a raid into Palestine; the Crusaders had recently forayed into the territory of Damascus, so Saladin saw the truce as no longer worth preserving. The Christians sent a large portion of their army to besiege the fortress of Harim north of Aleppo, so southern Palestine bore few defenders. Saladin found the situation ripe and marched to Ascalon, which he referred to as the \"Bride of Syria\". William of Tyre recorded that the Ayyubid army consisted of soldiers, of which 8,000 were elite forces and were black soldiers from Sudan. This army proceeded to raid the countryside, sack Ramla and Lod, and disperse themselves as far as the Gates of Jerusalem.\nBattles and truce with Baldwin.\nThe Ayyubids allowed Baldwin IV of Jerusalem to enter Ascalon with his famous Gaza-based Knights Templar without taking any precautions against a sudden attack. Although the Crusader force consisted of only 375 knights, Saladin hesitated to ambush them because of the presence of highly skilled templar generals. On 25 November, while the greater part of the Ayyubid army was absent, Saladin and his men were surprised near Ramla in the battle of Montgisard (possibly at Gezer, also known as Tell Jezar). Before they could form up, the Templar force hacked the Ayyubid army down by body-to-body of sword. Initially, Saladin attempted to organize his men into battle order, but as his bodyguards were being killed, he saw that defeat was inevitable and so with a small remnant of his troops mounted a swift camel, riding all the way to the territories of Egypt.\nNot discouraged by his defeat at Montgisard, Saladin was prepared to fight the Crusaders once again. In the spring of 1178, he was encamped under the walls of Homs, and a few skirmishes occurred between his generals and the Crusader army. His forces in Hama won a victory over their enemy and brought the spoils, together with many prisoners of war, to Saladin who ordered the captives to be beheaded for \"plundering and laying waste the lands of the Faithful\". He spent the rest of the year in Syria without a confrontation with his enemies.\nSaladin's intelligence services reported to him that the Crusaders were planning a raid into Syria. He ordered one of his generals, Farrukh-Shah, to guard the Damascus frontier with a thousand of his men to watch for an attack, then to retire, avoiding battle, and to light warning beacons on the hills, after which Saladin would march out. In April 1179, the Crusaders and Templars led by King Baldwin expected no resistance and waited to launch a surprise attack on Muslim herders grazing their herds and flocks east of the Golan Heights. Baldwin advanced too rashly in pursuit of Farrukh-Shah's force, which was concentrated southeast of Quneitra and was subsequently defeated by the Ayyubids. With this victory, Saladin decided to call in more troops from Egypt; he requested al-Adil to dispatch 1,500 horsemen.\nIn the summer of 1179, King Baldwin had set up an outpost on the road to Damascus and aimed to fortify a passage over the Jordan River, known as Jacob's Ford, that commanded the approach to the Banias plain (the plain was divided by the Muslims and the Christians). Saladin had offered 100,000 gold pieces to Baldwin to abandon the project, which was particularly offensive to the Muslims, but to no avail. He then resolved to destroy the fortress, called \"Chastellet\" and defended by the Templars knights, moving his headquarters to Banias. As the Crusaders hurried down to attack the Muslim forces, they fell into disorder, with the infantry falling behind. Despite early success, they pursued the Muslims far enough to become scattered, and Saladin took advantage by rallying his troops and charging at the Crusaders. The engagement ended in a decisive Ayyubid victory, and many high-ranking knights were captured. Saladin then moved to besiege the fortress, which fell on 30 August 1179.\nIn the spring of 1180, while Saladin was in the area of Safad, anxious to commence a vigorous campaign against the Kingdom of Jerusalem, King Baldwin sent messengers to him with proposals of peace. Because droughts and bad harvests hampered his commissariat, Saladin agreed to a truce. Raymond of Tripoli denounced the truce but was compelled to accept after an Ayyubid raid on his territory in May and upon the appearance of Saladin's naval fleet off the port of Tartus.\nDomestic affairs.\nIn June 1180, Saladin hosted a reception for Nur ad-Din Muhammad, the Artuqid \"emir\" of Keyfa, at Geuk Su, in which he presented him and his brother Abu Bakr with gifts, valued at over 100,000 dinars according to Imad ad-Din. This was intended to cement an alliance with the Artuqids and to impress other \"emirs\" in Mesopotamia and Anatolia. Previously, Saladin offered to mediate relations between Nur ad-Din and Kilij Arslan II\u2014the Seljuk sultan of R\u00fbm\u2014after the two came into conflict. The latter demanded that Nur ad-Din return the lands given to him as a dowry for marrying his daughter when he received reports that she was being abused and used to gain Seljuk territory. Nur ad-Din asked Saladin to mediate the issue, but Arslan refused.\nAfter Nur ad-Din and Saladin met at Geuk Su, the top Seljuk emir, Ikhtiyar ad-Din al-Hasan, confirmed Arslan's submission, after which an agreement was drawn up. Saladin was later enraged when he received a message from Arslan accusing Nur ad-Din of more abuses against his daughter. He threatened to attack the city of Malatya, saying, \"it is two days march for me and I shall not dismount [my horse] until I am in the city.\" Alarmed at the threat, the Seljuks pushed for negotiations. Saladin felt that Arslan was correct to care for his daughter, but Nur ad-Din had taken refuge with him, and therefore he could not betray his trust. It was finally agreed that Arslan's daughter would be sent away for a year and if Nur ad-Din failed to comply, Saladin would move to abandon his support for him.\nLeaving Farrukh-Shah in charge of Syria, Saladin returned to Cairo at the beginning of 1181. According to Abu Shama, he intended to spend the fast of Ramadan in Egypt and then make the \"hajj\" pilgrimage to Mecca in the summer. For an unknown reason, he apparently changed his plans regarding the pilgrimage and was seen inspecting the Nile River banks in June. He was again embroiled with the Bedouin; he removed two-thirds of their fiefs to use as compensation for the fief-holders at Fayyum. The Bedouin were also accused of trading with the Crusaders and, consequently, their grain was confiscated and they were forced to migrate westward. Later, Ayyubid warships were deployed against Bedouin river pirates, who were plundering the shores of Lake Tanis.\nIn the summer of 1181, Saladin's former palace administrator Baha ad-Din Qaraqush led a force to arrest Majd ad-Din\u2014a former deputy of Turan-Shah in the Yemeni town of Zabid\u2014while he was entertaining Imad ad-Din al-Ishfahani at his estate in Cairo. Saladin's intimates accused Majd ad-Din of misappropriating the revenues of Zabid, but Saladin himself believed there was no evidence to back the allegations. He had Majd ad-Din released in return for a payment of 80,000 dinars. In addition, other sums were to be paid to Saladin's brothers al-Adil and Taj al-Muluk Buri. The controversial detainment of Majd ad-Din was a part of the larger discontent associated with the aftermath of Turan-Shah's departure from Yemen. Although his deputies continued to send him revenues from the province, centralized authority was lacking and an internal quarrel arose between Izz ad-Din Uthman of Aden and Hittan of Zabid. Saladin wrote in a letter to al-Adil: \"this Yemen is a treasure house ... We conquered it, but up to this day we have had no return and no advantage from it. There have been only innumerable expenses, the sending out of troops ... and expectations which did not produce what was hoped for in the end.\"\nImperial expansions.\nCampaign against the Franks and War with the Zengids.\nSaif ad-Din had died earlier in June 1181 and his brother Izz ad-Din inherited leadership of Mosul. On 4 December, the crown prince of the Zengids, as-Salih, died in Aleppo. Prior to his death, he had his chief officers swear an oath of loyalty to Izz ad-Din, as he was the only Zengid ruler strong enough to oppose Saladin. Izz ad-Din was welcomed in Aleppo, but possessing it and Mosul put too great of a strain on his abilities. He thus, handed Aleppo to his brother Imad ad-Din Zangi, in exchange for Sinjar. Saladin offered no opposition to these transactions in order to respect the treaty he previously made with the Zengids.\nOn 11 May 1182, Saladin, along with half of the Egyptian Ayyubid army and numerous non-combatants, left Cairo for Syria. On the evening before he departed, he sat with his companions and the tutor of one of his sons quoted a line of poetry: \"enjoy the scent of the ox-eye plant of Najd, for after this evening it will come no more\". Saladin took this as an evil omen and he never saw Egypt again. Knowing that Crusader forces were massed upon the frontier to intercept him, he took the desert route across the Sinai Peninsula to Ailah at the head of the Gulf of Aqaba. Meeting no opposition, Saladin ravaged the countryside of Montreal, whilst Baldwin's forces watched on, refusing to intervene. He arrived in Damascus in June to learn that Farrukh-Shah had attacked the Galilee, sacking Daburiyya and capturing Habis Jaldek, a fortress of great importance to the Crusaders. In July, Saladin led his army across the Jordan and into Galilee, where he marched south to sack Bethsan. He was met by a substantial Crusader force in an inconclusive battle near Belvoir Castle, but he was unable to destroy the Christian army and could not logistically sustain his own army any longer, so he withdrew across the river. In August, he passed through the Beqaa Valley to Beirut, where he rendezvoused with the Egyptian fleet and laid siege to the city. Failing to make any headway, he withdrew after a few days to deal with matters in Mesopotamia.\nKukbary (Muzaffar ad-Din G\u00f6kb\u00f6ri), the \"emir\" of Harran, invited Saladin to occupy the Jazira region, making up northern Mesopotamia. He complied and the truce between him and the Zengids officially ended in September 1182. Prior to his march to Jazira, tensions had grown between the Zengid rulers of the region, primarily concerning their unwillingness to pay deference to Mosul. Before he crossed the Euphrates, Saladin besieged Aleppo for three days, signaling that the truce was over.\nOnce he reached Bira, near the river, he was joined by Kukbary and Nur ad-Din of Hisn Kayfa and the combined forces captured the cities of Jazira, one after the other. First, Edessa fell, followed by Saruj, then Raqqa, Qirqesiya and Nusaybin. Raqqa was an important crossing point and held by Qutb ad-Din Inal, who had lost Manbij to Saladin in 1176. Upon seeing the large size of Saladin's army, he made little effort to resist and surrendered on the condition that he would retain his property. Saladin promptly impressed the inhabitants of the town by publishing a decree that ordered a number of taxes to be canceled and erased all mention of them from treasury records, stating \"the most miserable rulers are those whose purses are fat and their people thin\". From Raqqa, he moved to conquer al-Fudain, al-Husain, Maksim, Durain, 'Araban, and Khabur\u2014all of which swore allegiance to him.\nSaladin proceeded to take Nusaybin which offered no resistance. A medium-sized town, Nusaybin was not of great importance, but it was located in a strategic position between Mardin and Mosul and within easy reach of Diyarbakir. In the midst of these victories, Saladin received word that the Crusaders were raiding the villages of Damascus. He replied, \"Let them... whilst they knock down villages, we are taking cities; when we come back, we shall have all the more strength to fight them.\" Meanwhile, in Aleppo, the \"emir\" of the city Zangi raided Saladin's cities to the north and east, such as Balis, Manbij, Saruj, Buza'a, al-Karzain. He also destroyed his own citadel at A'zaz to prevent it from being used by the Ayyubids if they were to conquer it.\nFight for Mosul.\nAs Saladin approached Mosul, he faced the issue of taking over a large city and justifying the action. The Zengids of Mosul appealed to an-Nasir, the Abbasid caliph at Baghdad whose vizier favored them. An-Nasir sent Badr al-Badr (a high-ranking religious figure) to mediate between the two sides. Saladin arrived at the city on 10 November 1182. Izz ad-Din would not accept his terms because he considered them disingenuous and extensive, and Saladin immediately laid siege to the heavily fortified city.\nAfter several minor skirmishes and a stalemate in the siege that was initiated by the caliph, Saladin intended to find a way to withdraw without damage to his reputation while still keeping up some military pressure. He decided to attack Sinjar, which was held by Izz ad-Din's brother Sharaf ad-Din. It fell after a 15-day siege on 30 December. Saladin's soldiers broke their discipline, plundering the city; Saladin managed to protect the governor and his officers only by sending them to Mosul. After establishing a garrison at Sinjar, he awaited a coalition assembled by Izz ad-Din consisting of his forces, those from Aleppo, Mardin, and Armenia. Saladin and his army met the coalition at Harran in February 1183, but on hearing of his approach, the latter sent messengers to Saladin asking for peace. Each force returned to their cities and al-Fadil wrote: \"They [Izz ad-Din's coalition] advanced like men, like women they vanished.\"\nOn 2 March, al-Adil from Egypt wrote to Saladin that the Crusaders had struck the \"heart of Islam\". Raynald de Ch\u00e2tillon had sent ships to the Gulf of Aqaba to raid towns and villages off the coast of the Red Sea. It was not an attempt to extend the Crusader influence into that sea or to capture its trade routes, but merely a piratical move. Nonetheless, Imad ad-Din writes the raid was alarming to the Muslims because they were not accustomed to attacks on that sea, and Ibn al-Athir adds that the inhabitants had no experience with the Crusaders either as fighters or traders.\nIbn Jubair was told that sixteen Muslim ships were burnt by the Crusaders, who then captured a pilgrim ship and caravan at Aidab. He also reported that they intended to attack Medina and remove Muhammad's body. Al-Maqrizi added to the rumor by claiming Muhammad's tomb was going to be relocated to Crusader territory so Muslims would make pilgrimages there. Al-Adil had his warships moved from Fustat and Alexandria to the Red Sea under the command of an Armenian mercenary Lu'lu. They broke the Crusader blockade, destroyed most of their ships, and pursued and captured those who anchored and fled into the desert. The surviving Crusaders, numbered at 170, were ordered to be killed by Saladin in various Muslim cities.\nFrom the point of view of Saladin, in terms of territory, the war against Mosul was going well, but he still failed to achieve his objectives and his army was shrinking; Taqi ad-Din took his men back to Hama, while Nasir ad-Din Muhammad and his forces had left. This encouraged Izz ad-Din and his allies to take the offensive. The previous coalition regrouped at Harzam some 140\u00a0km from Harran. In early April, without waiting for Nasir ad-Din, Saladin and Taqi ad-Din commenced their advance against the coalition, marching eastward to Ras al-Ein unhindered. By late April, after three days of \"actual fighting\", according to Saladin, the Ayyubids had captured Amid. He handed the city to Nur ad-Din Muhammad together with its stores, which consisted of 80,000 candles, a tower full of arrowheads, and 1,040,000 books. In return for a diploma\u2014granting him the city, Nur ad-Din swore allegiance to Saladin, promising to follow him in every expedition in the war against the Crusaders, and repairing the damage done to the city. The fall of Amid, in addition to territory, convinced Il-Ghazi of Mardin to enter the service of Saladin, weakening Izz ad-Din's coalition.\nSaladin attempted to gain the Caliph an-Nasir's support against Izz ad-Din by sending him a letter requesting a document that would give him legal justification for taking over Mosul and its territories. Saladin aimed to persuade the caliph claiming that while he conquered Egypt and Yemen under the flag of the Abbasids, the Zengids of Mosul openly supported the Seljuks (rivals of the caliphate) and only came to the caliph when in need. He also accused Izz ad-Din's forces of disrupting the Muslim \"Holy War\" against the Crusaders, stating \"they are not content not to fight, but they prevent those who can\". Saladin defended his own conduct claiming that he had come to Syria to fight the Crusaders, end the heresy of the Assassins, and stop the wrong-doing of the Muslims. He also promised that if Mosul was given to him, it would lead to the capture of Jerusalem, Constantinople, Georgia, and the lands of the Almohads in the Maghreb, \"until the word of God is supreme and the Abbasid caliphate has wiped the world clean, turning the churches into mosques\". Saladin stressed that all this would happen by the will of God, and instead of asking for financial or military support from the caliph, he would capture and give the caliph the territories of Tikrit, Daquq, Khuzestan, Kish Island, and Oman.\nPossession of Aleppo.\nSaladin turned his attention from Mosul to Aleppo, sending his brother Taj al-Muluk Buri to capture Tell Khalid, 130\u00a0km northeast of the city. A siege was set, but the governor of Tell Khalid surrendered upon the arrival of Saladin himself on 17 May before a siege could take place. According to Imad ad-Din, after Tell Khalid, Saladin took a detour northwards to Aintab, but he gained possession of it when his army turned towards it, allowing him to quickly move backward another c. 100\u00a0km towards Aleppo. On 21 May, he camped outside the city, positioning himself east of the Citadel of Aleppo, while his forces encircled the suburb of Banaqusa to the northeast and Bab Janan to the west. He stationed his men dangerously close to the city, hoping for an early success.\nZangi did not offer long resistance. He was unpopular with his subjects and wished to return to his Sinjar, the city he governed previously. An exchange was negotiated where Zangi would hand over Aleppo to Saladin in return for the restoration of his control of Sinjar, Nusaybin, and Raqqa. Zangi would hold these territories as Saladin's vassals in terms of military service. On 12 June, Aleppo was formally placed in Ayyubid hands. The people of Aleppo had not known about these negotiations and were taken by surprise when Saladin's standard was hoisted over the citadel. Two \"emir\"s, including an old friend of Saladin, Izz ad-Din Jurduk, welcomed and pledged their service to him. Saladin replaced the Hanafi courts with Shafi'i administration, despite a promise that he would not interfere in the religious leadership of the city. Although he was short of money, Saladin also allowed the departing Zangi to take all the stores of the citadel that he could travel with and to sell the remainder\u2014which Saladin purchased himself. In spite of his earlier hesitation to go through with the exchange, he had no doubts about his success, stating that Aleppo was \"the key to the lands\" and \"this city is the eye of Syria and the citadel is its pupil\". For Saladin, the capture of the city marked the end of over eight years of waiting since he told Farrukh-Shah that \"we have only to do the milking and Aleppo will be ours\".\nAfter spending one night in Aleppo's citadel, Saladin marched to Harim, near the Crusader-held Antioch. The city was held by Surhak, a \"minor \"mamluk\"\". Saladin offered him the city of Busra and property in Damascus in exchange for Harim, but when Surhak asked for more, his own garrison in Harim forced him out. He was arrested by Saladin's deputy Taqi ad-Din on allegations that he was planning to cede Harim to Bohemond III of Antioch. When Saladin received its surrender, he proceeded to arrange the defense of Harim from the Crusaders. He reported to the caliph and his own subordinates in Yemen and Baalbek that he was going to attack the Armenians. Before he could move, however, there were a number of administrative details to be settled. Saladin agreed to a truce with Bohemond in return for Muslim prisoners being held by him and then he gave A'zaz to Alam ad-Din Suleiman and Aleppo to Saif ad-Din al-Yazkuj\u2014the former was an \"emir\" of Aleppo who joined Saladin and the latter was a former \"mamluk\" of Shirkuh who helped rescue him from the assassination attempt at A'zaz.\nWars against Crusaders.\nCrusader attacks provoked further responses by Saladin. Raynald of Ch\u00e2tillon, in particular, harassed Muslim trading and pilgrimage routes with a fleet on the Red Sea, a water route that Saladin needed to keep open. Raynald threatened to attack the holy cities of Mecca and Medina. On 29 September 1183, Saladin crossed the Jordan River to attack Beisan, which was found to be empty. The next day his forces sacked and burned the town and moved westwards. They intercepted Crusader reinforcements from Karak and Shaubak along the Nablus road and took prisoners. Meanwhile, the main Crusader force under Guy of Lusignan moved from Sepphoris to al-Fula. Saladin sent out 500 skirmishers to harass their forces, and he himself marched to Ain Jalut. When the Crusader force\u2014reckoned to be the largest the kingdom ever produced from its own resources, but still outmatched by the Muslims\u2014advanced, the Ayyubids unexpectedly moved down the stream of Ain Jalut. After a few Ayyubid raids\u2014including attacks on Zir'in, Forbelet, and Mount Tabor\u2014the Crusaders still were not tempted to attack their main force, and Saladin led his men back across the river once provisions and supplies ran low. Saladin still had to exact retribution on Raynald, so he twice besieged Kerak, Raynald's fortress in Oultrejordain. The first time was in 1183, following his unsuccessful campaign into Galilee, but a relief force caused him to withdraw. He opened his campaign of 1184 with a second siege of Kerak, hoping this time to draw the Crusader army into battle on open ground, but they outmaneuvered him and successfully relieved the fortress.\nFollowing the failure of his Kerak sieges, Saladin temporarily turned his attention back to another long-term project and resumed attacks on the territory of Izz ad-Din (Mas'ud ibn Mawdud ibn Zangi), around Mosul, which he had begun with some success in 1182. However, since then, Mas\u02bb\u016bd had allied himself with the powerful governor of Azerbaijan and Jibal, who in 1185 began moving his troops across the Zagros Mountains, causing Saladin to hesitate in his attacks. The defenders of Mosul, when they became aware that help was on the way, increased their efforts, and Saladin subsequently fell ill, so in March 1186 a peace treaty was signed. Meanwhile, Raynald retaliated for the earlier sieges of Kerak by looting a caravan of pilgrims on the Hajj during the winter of 1186\u201387. According to the later 13th-century \"Old French Continuation of William of Tyre\", Raynald captured Saladin's sister in a raid on a caravan; this claim is not attested in contemporary sources, Muslim or Frankish, however, instead stating that Raynald had attacked a preceding caravan, and Saladin set guards to ensure the safety of his sister and her son, who came to no harm. On hearing of the attack, Saladin vowed that he would personally slay Raynald for breaking the truce, a vow he would keep. The outrage also led Saladin to resolve to dispense with half-measures to rein in the unruly lord of Kerak, and to instead topple the entire edifice of the Christian Kingdom of Jerusalem, thus precipitating the invasion of the summer of 1187.\nOn 4 July 1187, Saladin faced the combined forces of Guy of Lusignan, King Consort of Jerusalem, and Raymond III of Tripoli at the Battle of Hattin. In this battle alone the Crusader force was largely annihilated by Saladin's determined army. It was a major disaster for the Crusaders and a turning point in the history of the Crusades. Saladin captured Raynald and was personally responsible for his execution in retaliation for his attacks against Muslim caravans. The members of these caravans had, in vain, besought his mercy by reciting the truce between the Muslims and the Crusaders, but Raynald ignored this and insulted the Muslim prophet, Muhammad, before murdering and torturing some of them. Upon hearing this, Saladin swore an oath to personally execute Raynald. Guy of Lusignan was also captured. Seeing the execution of Raynald, he feared he would be next. However, his life was spared by Saladin, who said of Raynald, \"[i]t is not the wont of kings, to kill kings; but that man had transgressed all bounds, and therefore did I treat him thus.\"\nCapture of Jerusalem.\nSaladin had captured almost every Crusader city. Saladin preferred to take Jerusalem without bloodshed and offered generous terms, but those inside refused to leave their holy city, vowing to destroy it in a fight to the death rather than see it handed over peacefully. Jerusalem capitulated to his forces on Friday, 2 October 1187, after a siege. When the siege had started, Saladin was unwilling to promise terms of quarter to the Frankish inhabitants of Jerusalem. Balian of Ibelin threatened to kill every Muslim hostage, estimated at 5,000, and to destroy Islam's holy shrines of the Dome of the Rock and the al-Aqsa Mosque if such quarter were not provided. Saladin consulted his council and the terms were accepted. The agreement was read out through the streets of Jerusalem so that everyone might within forty days provide for himself and pay to Saladin the agreed tribute for his freedom. An unusually low ransom was to be paid for each Frank in the city, whether man, woman, or child, but Saladin, against the wishes of his treasurers, allowed many families who could not afford the ransom to leave. Patriarch Heraclius of Jerusalem organised and contributed to a collection that paid the ransoms for about 18,000 of the poorer citizens, leaving another 15,000 to be enslaved. Saladin's brother al-Adil \"asked Saladin for a thousand of them for his own use and then released them on the spot.\" Most of the foot soldiers were sold into slavery. Upon the capture of Jerusalem, Saladin summoned the Jews and permitted them to resettle in the city. In particular, the residents of Ascalon, a large Jewish settlement, responded to his request.\nTyre, on the coast of modern-day Lebanon, was the last major Crusader city that was not captured by Muslim forces. Strategically, it would have made more sense for Saladin to capture Tyre before Jerusalem; Saladin, however, chose to pursue Jerusalem first because of the importance of the city to Islam. Tyre was commanded by Conrad of Montferrat, who strengthened its defences and withstood two sieges by Saladin. In 1188, at Tortosa, Saladin released Guy of Lusignan and returned him to his wife Sibylla of Jerusalem. They went first to Tripoli, then to Antioch. In 1189, they sought to reclaim Tyre for their kingdom but were refused admission by Conrad, who did not recognize Guy as king. Guy then set about besieging Acre.\nSaladin was on friendly terms with Queen Tamar of Georgia. Saladin's biographer Baha ad-Din ibn Shaddad reports that, after Saladin's conquest of Jerusalem, the Georgian Queen sent envoys to the sultan to request the return of confiscated possessions of the Georgian monasteries in Jerusalem. Saladin's response is not recorded, but the queen's efforts seem to have been successful as Jacques de Vitry, the Bishop of Acre, reports the Georgians were, in contrast to the other Christian pilgrims, allowed a free passage into the city with their banners unfurled. Ibn \u0160add\u0101d furthermore claims that Queen Tamar outbid the Byzantine emperor in her efforts to obtain the relics of the True Cross, offering 200,000 gold pieces to Saladin who had taken the relics as booty at the battle of Hattin, but to no avail.\nAccording to Baha ad-Din, after these victories, Saladin mused of invading Europe, saying: \"I think that when God grants me victory over the rest of Palestine I shall divide my territories, make a will stating my wishes, then set sail on this sea for their far-off lands in and pursue the Franks there, so as to free the earth of anyone who does not believe in God, or die in the attempt.\"\nThird Crusade.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIt is equally true that his generosity, his piety, devoid of fanaticism, that flower of liberality and courtesy which had been the model of our old chroniclers, won him no less popularity in Frankish Syria than in the lands of Islam.\n\"Ren\u00e9 Grousset (writer)\"\nHattin and the fall of Jerusalem prompted the Third Crusade (1189\u20131192), which was partially financed by a special \"Saladin tithe\" in 1188. King Richard I led Guy's siege of Acre, conquered the city and executed almost 3,000 Muslim prisoners of war. Baha ad-Din wrote:&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe armies of Saladin engaged in combat with the army of King Richard at the Battle of Arsuf on 7 September 1191, at which Saladin's forces suffered heavy losses and were forced to withdraw. After the battle of Arsuf, Richard occupied Jaffa, restoring the city's fortifications. Meanwhile, Saladin moved south, where he dismantled the fortifications of Ascalon to prevent this strategically important city, which lay at the junction between Egypt and Palestine, from falling into Crusader hands.\nIn October 1191, Richard began restoring the inland castles on the coastal plain beyond Jaffa in preparation for an advance on Jerusalem. During this period, Richard and Saladin passed envoys back and forth, negotiating the possibility of a truce. Richard proposed that his sister Joan should marry Saladin's brother and that Jerusalem could be their wedding gift. However, Saladin rejected this idea when Richard insisted that Saladin's brother convert to Christianity. Richard suggested that his niece Eleanor, Fair Maid of Brittany be the bride instead, an idea that Saladin also rejected.\nIn January 1192, Richard's army occupied Beit Nuba, just twelve miles from Jerusalem, but withdrew without attacking the Holy City. Instead, Richard advanced south on Ascalon, where he restored the fortifications. In July 1192, Saladin tried to threaten Richard's command of the coast by attacking Jaffa. The city was besieged, and Saladin very nearly captured it; however, Richard arrived a few days later and defeated Saladin's army in a battle outside the city.\nThe Battle of Jaffa (1192) proved to be the last military engagement of the Third Crusade. After Richard reoccupied Jaffa and restored its fortifications, he and Saladin again discussed terms. At last Richard agreed to demolish the fortifications of Ascalon, while Saladin agreed to recognize Crusader control of the Palestinian coast from Tyre to Jaffa. The Christians would be allowed to travel as unarmed pilgrims to Jerusalem, and Saladin's kingdom would be at peace with the Crusader states for the following three years.\nDeath.\nSaladin died of a fever on 4 March 1193 (27 Safar 589 AH) at Damascus, not long after King Richard's departure. In Saladin's possession at the time of his death were one piece of gold and forty pieces of silver. He had given away his great wealth to his poor subjects, leaving nothing to pay for his funeral. He was buried in a mausoleum in the garden outside the Umayyad Mosque in Damascus, Syria. Originally the tomb was part of a complex which also included a school, Madrassah al-Aziziah, of which little remains except a few columns and an internal arch. Seven centuries later, Emperor Wilhelm II of Germany donated a new marble sarcophagus to the mausoleum. However, the original sarcophagus was not replaced; instead, the mausoleum, which is open to visitors, now has two sarcophagi: the marble one placed on the side and the original wooden one, which covers Saladin's tomb.\nFamily.\nImad ad-Din al-Isfahani compiled a list of Saladin's sons along with their dates of birth, according to information provided by Saladin late in his reign. Notable members of Saladin's progeny, as listed by Imad, include:\nThe sons listed by Imad number fifteen, but elsewhere he writes that Saladin was survived by seventeen sons and one daughter. Saladin's daughter is said to have married her cousin al-Kamil Muhammad ibn Adil. Saladin may also have had other children who died before him. One son, Al-Zahir Dawud, whom Imad listed eighth, is recorded as being Saladin's twelfth son in a letter written by his minister.\nNot much is known of Saladin's wives or slave-women. He married Ismat ad-Din Khatun, the widow of Nur ad-Din Zengi, in 1176. She did not have children. One of his wives, Shamsah, is buried with her son al-Aziz in the tomb of al-Shafi'i.\nRecognition and legacy.\nMuslim world.\nSaladin has become a prominent figure in Muslim, Arab, Turkish and Kurdish culture, and he has been described as the most famous Kurd in history. Historian ibn Munqidh mentioned him as the person who revived the reign of \"Rashidun Caliphs\". The Turkish writer Mehmet Akif Ersoy called him the most beloved sultan of the Orient.\nIn 1898, German emperor Wilhelm II visited Saladin's tomb to pay his respects. The visit, coupled with anti-imperialist sentiments, encouraged the image in the Arab world of Saladin as a hero of the struggle against the West, building on was the romantic one created by Walter Scott and other Europeans in the West at the time. Saladin's reputation had previously been largely forgotten in the Muslim world, eclipsed by more successful figures, such as Baybars of Egypt.\nModern Arab states have sought to commemorate Saladin through various measures, often based on the image created of him in the 19th-century west. A governorate centered around Tikrit and Samarra in modern-day Iraq is named after him, as is Salahaddin University in Erbil, the largest city of Iraqi Kurdistan. A suburban community of Erbil, Masif Salahaddin, is also named after him.\nFew structures associated with Saladin survive within modern cities. Saladin first fortified the Citadel of Cairo (1175\u20131183), which had been a domed pleasure pavilion with a fine view in more peaceful times. In Syria, even the smallest city is centred on a defensible citadel, and Saladin introduced this essential feature to Egypt.\nAlthough the Ayyubid dynasty that he founded would outlive him by only 57 years, the legacy of Saladin within the Arab world continues to this day. With the rise of Arab nationalism in the 20th century, particularly with regard to the Arab\u2013Israeli conflict, Saladin's heroism and leadership gained a new significance. Saladin's recapture of Palestine from the European Crusaders is considered an inspiration for modern-day Arabs' opposition to Zionism. Moreover, the glory and comparative unity of the Arab world under Saladin was seen as the perfect symbol for the new unity sought by Arab nationalists, such as Gamal Abdel Nasser. For this reason, the Eagle of Saladin became the symbol of revolutionary Egypt, and was subsequently adopted by several other Arab states (the United Arab Republic, Iraq, Libya, the State of Palestine, and Yemen).\nAmong Egyptian Shias, Saladin is dubbed as \"Kharab ad-Din\", the destroyer of religion\u2014a derisive play on the name \"Saladin.\"\nWestern world.\nSaladin was widely renowned in medieval Europe as a model of kingship, and in particular of the courtly virtue of regal generosity. As early as 1202/03, Walther von der Vogelweide urged the German King Philip of Swabia to be more like Saladin, who believed that a king's hands should have holes to let the gold fall through.\nBy the 1270s, Jans der Enikel was spreading the fictitious but approving story of Saladin's table, which presented him as both pious and wise to religious diversity.\nIn \"The Divine Comedy\" (1308\u20131320), Dante mentions him as one of the virtuous non-Christians in limbo, and he is also depicted favorably in Boccaccio's \"The Decameron\" (1438\u201353).\nAlthough Saladin faded into history after the Middle Ages, he appears in a sympathetic light in modern literature, first in Lessing's play \"Nathan the Wise\" (1779), which transfers the central idea of \"Saladin's table\" to the post-medieval world. He is a central character in Sir Walter Scott's novel \"The Talisman\" (1825), which more than any other single text influenced the romantic view of Saladin. Scott presented Saladin as a \"modern [19th-century] liberal European gentlemen, beside whom medieval Westerners would always have made a poor showing\". 20th-century French author Albert Champdor described him as \"Le plus pur h\u00e9ros de l'Islam\" (). Despite the Crusaders' slaughter when they originally conquered Jerusalem in 1099, Saladin granted amnesty and free passage to all common Catholics and even to the defeated Christian army, as long as they were able to pay the aforementioned ransom (the Greek Orthodox Christians were treated even better because they often opposed the western Crusaders).\nNotwithstanding the differences in beliefs, the Muslim Saladin was respected by Christian lords, Richard especially. Richard once praised Saladin as a great prince, saying that he was, without doubt, the greatest and most powerful leader in the Muslim world. Saladin, in turn, stated that there was not a more honorable Christian lord than Richard. After the treaty, Saladin and Richard sent each other many gifts as tokens of respect but never met face to face. In April 1191, a Frankish woman's three-month-old baby had been stolen from her camp and sold on the market. The Franks urged her to approach Saladin herself with her grievance. According to Ibn Shaddad, Saladin used his own money to buy the child back:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;He gave it to the mother and she took it; with tears streaming down her face, and hugged the baby to her chest. The people were watching her and weeping and I (Ibn Shaddad) was standing amongst them. She suckled it for some time and then Saladin ordered a horse to be fetched for her and she went back to camp.\nMark Cartwright, the publishing director of \"World History Encyclopedia\", writes: \"Indeed, it is somewhat ironic that the Muslim leader became one of the great exemplars of chivalry in 13th century European literature. Much has been written about the sultan during his own lifetime and since, but the fact that an appreciation for his diplomacy and leadership skills can be found in both contemporary Muslim and Christian sources would suggest that Saladin is indeed worthy of his position as one of the great medieval leaders.\"\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "26984", "revid": "47248563", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26984", "title": "Sophocles", "text": "5th century BC Athenian tragic playwright\nSophocles (; , , \"Sophokl\u1ec5s\"; c. 497/496 \u2013 winter 406/405 BC) was an ancient Greek tragedian, one of three from whom at least two plays have survived in full. His first plays were written later than, or contemporary with, those of Aeschylus and earlier than, or contemporary with, those of Euripides. Sophocles wrote more than 120 plays, but only seven have survived in a complete form: \"Ajax\", \"Antigone\", \"Women of Trachis\", \"Oedipus Rex\", \"Electra\", \"Philoctetes\", and \"Oedipus at Colonus\". For almost 50 years, Sophocles was the most celebrated playwright in the dramatic competitions of the city-state of Athens, which took place during the religious festivals of the Lenaea and the Dionysia. He competed in 30 competitions, won 24, and was never judged lower than second place. Aeschylus won 13 competitions and was sometimes beaten by Sophocles; Euripides won four.\nThe most famous tragedies of Sophocles feature Oedipus and Antigone: they are generally known as the Theban plays, though each was part of a different tetralogy (the other members of which are now lost). Sophocles influenced the development of drama, most importantly by adding a third actor (attributed to Sophocles by Aristotle; to Aeschylus by Themistius), thereby reducing the importance of the chorus in the presentation of the plot. He also developed his characters to a greater extent than earlier playwrights.\nLife.\nSophocles, the son of Sophillus, was a wealthy member of the rural \"deme\" (small community) of Hippeius Colonus in Attica, which was to become a setting for his play Oedipus at Colonus. He was also probably born there, a few years before the Battle of Marathon in 490 BC: the exact year is unclear, but 497/6 is most likely. He was born into a wealthy family (his father was an armour manufacturer) and was highly educated. His first artistic triumph was in 468 BC, when he took first prize in the Dionysia, beating the reigning master of Athenian drama, Aeschylus. According to Plutarch, the victory came under unusual circumstances: instead of following the usual custom of choosing judges by lot, the archon asked Cimon, and the other \"strategoi\" present, to decide the victor of the contest. Plutarch further contends that, following this loss, Aeschylus soon left for Sicily. Though Plutarch says that this was Sophocles's first production, it is now thought that his first production was probably in 470 BC. \"Triptolemus\" was perhaps one of the plays that Sophocles presented at this festival.\nIn 480 BC, Sophocles was chosen to lead the paean (a choral chant to a god), celebrating the Greek victory over the Persians at the Battle of Salamis. Early in his career, the politician Cimon might have been one of his patrons, but if he was, there was no ill will borne by Pericles, Cimon's rival, when Cimon was ostracized in 461 BC. In 443/2, Sophocles served as one of the \"Hellenotamiai\", or treasurers of Athena, helping to manage the finances of the city during the political ascendancy of Pericles. In 441 BC, according to the \"Vita Sophoclis\", he was elected one of the ten generals, executive officials at Athens, as a junior colleague of Pericles; and he served in the Athenian campaign against Samos. He was supposed to have been elected to this position due to his production of \"Antigone\", but this is \"most improbable\".\nIn 420 BC, he was chosen to receive the image of Asclepius in his own house when the cult was being introduced to Athens and lacked a proper place (\u03c4\u03ad\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2). For this, the Athenians gave him the posthumous epithet \"Dexion\" (receiver). But \"some doubt attaches to this story\". He was also elected, in 411 BC, one of the commissioners (\"probouloi\") who responded to the catastrophic destruction of the Athenian expeditionary force in Sicily during the Peloponnesian War.\nSophocles died at the age of 90 or 91 in the winter of 406/5 BC, having seen, within his lifetime, both the Greek triumph in the Persian Wars and the bloodletting of the Peloponnesian War. As with many famous men in classical antiquity, his death inspired a number of apocryphal stories. One claimed that he died from the strain of trying to recite a long sentence from his \"Antigone\" without pausing to take a breath. Another account suggests he choked while eating grapes at the Anthesteria festival in Athens. A third holds that he died of happiness after winning his final victory at the City Dionysia. A few months later, a comic poet, in a play titled \"The Muses\", wrote this eulogy: \"Blessed is Sophocles, who had a long life, was a man both happy and talented, and the writer of many good tragedies; and he ended his life well without suffering any misfortune.\" According to some accounts, however, his own sons tried to have him declared incompetent near the end of his life, and he refuted their charge in court by reading from his new \"Oedipus at Colonus\". One of his sons, Iophon, and a grandson, also named Sophocles (son of Ariston), also became playwrights.\nAn ancient source, Athenaeus's work \"Sophists at Dinner\", contains references to Sophocles's sexuality. In that work, a character named Myrtilus claims that Sophocles \"was partial to boys, in the same way that Euripides was partial to women\" (\"\u03c6\u03b9\u03bb\u03bf\u03bc\u03b5\u1fd6\u03c1\u03b1\u03be \u03b4\u1f72 \u1f26\u03bd \u1f41 \u03a3\u03bf\u03c6\u03bf\u03ba\u03bb\u1fc6\u03c2, \u1f61\u03c2 \u0395\u1f50\u03c1\u03b9\u03c0\u03af\u03b4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03c6\u03b9\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03cd\u03bd\u03b7\u03c2\"), and relates an anecdote, attributed to Ion of Chios, of Sophocles flirting with a serving-boy at a symposium:&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt; He also says that Hieronymus of Rhodes, in his \"Historical Notes\", claims that Sophocles once led a boy outside the city walls for sex; and that the boy snatched Sophocles's cloak (\u03c7\u03bb\u03b1\u03bd\u03af\u03c2, \"khlanis\"), leaving his own child-sized robe (\"\u03c0\u03b1\u03b9\u03b4\u03b9\u03ba\u1f78\u03bd \u1f31\u03bc\u03ac\u03c4\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd\") for Sophocles. Moreover, when Euripides heard about this (it was much discussed), he mocked the disdainful treatment, saying that he had himself had sex with the boy, \"but had not given him anything more than his usual fee\" (\"\u1f00\u03bb\u03bb\u1f70 \u03bc\u03b7\u03b4\u1f72\u03bd \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c3\u03b8\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9\"), or, \"but that nothing had been taken off\" (\"\u1f00\u03bb\u03bb\u1f70 \u03bc\u03b7\u03b4\u1f72\u03bd \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03b5\u03b8\u1fc6\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9\"). In response, Sophocles composed this elegy: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\u1f2d\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 \u1f26\u03bd, \u03bf\u1f50 \u03c0\u03b1\u1fd6\u03c2, \u0395\u1f50\u03c1\u03b9\u03c0\u03af\u03b4\u03b7, \u1f45\u03c2 \u03bc\u03b5 \u03c7\u03bb\u03b9\u03b1\u03af\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd&lt;br&gt;\u03b3\u03c5\u03bc\u03bd\u1f78\u03bd \u1f10\u03c0\u03bf\u03af\u03b7\u03c3\u03b5\u03bd\u00b7 \u03c3\u03bf\u1f76 \u03b4\u1f72 \u03c6\u03b9\u03bb\u03bf\u1fe6\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9 \u2020 \u1f11\u03c4\u03b1\u03af\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd \u2020&lt;br&gt;\u0392\u03bf\u03c1\u03c1\u1fb6\u03c2 \u1f61\u03bc\u03af\u03bb\u03b7\u03c3\u03b5. \u03c3\u1f7a \u03b4\u1fbf \u03bf\u1f50 \u03c3\u03bf\u03c6\u03cc\u03c2, \u1f43\u03c2 \u03c4\u1f78\u03bd \u1f1c\u03c1\u03c9\u03c4\u03b1,&lt;br&gt;\u1f00\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03c4\u03c1\u03af\u03b1\u03bd \u03c3\u03c0\u03b5\u03af\u03c1\u03c9\u03bd, \u03bb\u03c9\u03c0\u03bf\u03b4\u03cd\u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u1f00\u03c0\u03ac\u03b3\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2.&lt;br&gt;It was the Sun, Euripides, and not a boy, that got me hot&lt;br&gt;and stripped me naked.

You're not so clever, if you arrest&lt;br&gt;Eros for stealing clothes while you're sowing another man's field.\nWorks and legacy.\nSophocles is known for innovations in dramatic structure; deeper development of characters than earlier playwrights; and, if it was not Aeschylus, the addition of a third actor, which further reduced the role of the chorus, and increased opportunities for development and conflict. Aeschylus, who dominated Athenian playwriting during Sophocles's early career, adopted the third actor into his own work. Besides the third actor, Aristotle credits Sophocles with the introduction of \"skenographia\", or scenery-painting; but this too is attributed elsewhere to someone else (by Vitruvius, to Agatharchus of Samos). After Aeschylus died, in 456 BC, Sophocles became the pre-eminent playwright in Athens, winning competitions at eighteen Dionysia, and six Lenaia festivals. His reputation was such that foreign rulers invited him to attend their courts; but, unlike Aeschylus, who died in Sicily, or Euripides, who spent time in Macedon, Sophocles never accepted any of these invitations. Aristotle, in his \"Poetics\" (c.\u2009335 BC), used Sophocles's \"Oedipus Rex\" as an example of the highest achievement in tragedy.\nOnly two of the seven surviving plays can be dated securely: \"Philoctetes\" to 409 BC, and \"Oedipus at Colonus\" to 401 BC (staged after his death, by his grandson). Of the others, \"Electra\" shows stylistic similarities to these two, suggesting that it was probably written in the later part of his career; \"Ajax\", \"Antigone\", and \"The Trachiniae\", are generally thought early, again based on stylistic elements; and \"Oedipus Rex\" is put in a middle period. Most of Sophocles's plays show an undercurrent of early fatalism, and the beginnings of Socratic logic as a mainstay for the long tradition of Greek tragedy.\nTheban plays.\nThe Theban plays comprise three plays: \"Oedipus Rex\" (also called \"Oedipus Tyrannus\" or \"Oedipus the King\"), \"Oedipus at Colonus\", and \"Antigone\". All three concern the fate of Thebes during and after the reign of King Oedipus. They have often been published under a single cover; but Sophocles wrote them for separate festival competitions, many years apart. The Theban plays are not a proper trilogy (i.e. three plays presented as a continuous narrative), nor an intentional series; they contain inconsistencies. Sophocles also wrote other plays pertaining to Thebes, such as the \"Epigoni\", but only fragments have survived.\nSubjects.\nThe three plays involve the tale of Oedipus, who kills his father and marries his mother, not knowing they are his parents. His family is cursed for three generations.\nIn \"Oedipus Rex\", Oedipus is the protagonist. His infanticide is planned by his parents, Laius and Jocasta, to prevent him fulfilling a prophecy; but the servant entrusted with the infanticide passes the infant on, through a series of intermediaries, to a childless couple, who adopt him, not knowing his history. Oedipus eventually learns of the Delphic Oracle's prophecy of him, that he would kill his father, and marry his mother; he attempts to flee his fate without harming those he knows as his parents (at this point, he does not know that he is adopted). Oedipus meets a man at a crossroads accompanied by servants; Oedipus and the man fight, and Oedipus kills the man (who was his father, Laius, although neither knew at the time). He becomes the ruler of Thebes after solving the riddle of the Sphinx and in the process, marries the widowed queen, his mother Jocasta. Thus the stage is set for horror. When the truth comes out, following from another true but confusing prophecy from Delphi, Jocasta commits suicide, Oedipus blinds himself and leaves Thebes. At the end of the play, order is restored. This restoration is seen when Creon, brother of Jocasta, becomes king, and also when Oedipus, before going off to exile, asks Creon to take care of his children. Oedipus's children will always bear the weight of shame and humiliation because of their father's actions.\nIn \"Oedipus at Colonus\", the banished Oedipus and his daughter Antigone arrive at the town of Colonus, where they encounter Theseus, King of Athens. Oedipus dies and strife begins between his sons Polyneices and Eteocles. They fight, and simultaneously run each other through.\nIn \"Antigone\", the protagonist is Oedipus's daughter, Antigone. She is faced with the choice of allowing her brother Polyneices's body to remain unburied, outside the city walls, exposed to the ravages of wild animals, or to bury him and face death. The king of the land, Creon, has forbidden the burial of Polyneices for he was a traitor to the city. Antigone decides to bury his body and face the consequences of her actions. Creon sentences her to death. Eventually, Creon is persuaded to free Antigone from her punishment, but his decision comes too late and Antigone commits suicide. Her suicide triggers the suicide of two others close to King Creon: his son, Haemon, who was to wed Antigone, and his wife, Eurydice, who commits suicide after losing her only surviving son.\nComposition and inconsistencies.\nThe plays were written across 36 years of Sophocles's career and were not composed in chronological order, but instead were written in the order \"Antigone\", \"Oedipus Rex\", and \"Oedipus at Colonus\". Nor were they composed as a \"trilogy\" \u2013 a group of plays to be performed together, but are the remaining parts of three different groups of plays. As a result, there are some inconsistencies: notably, Creon is the undisputed king at the end of \"Oedipus Rex\" and, in consultation with Apollo, single-handedly makes the decision to expel Oedipus from Thebes. Creon is also instructed to look after Oedipus's daughters Antigone and Ismene at the end of \"Oedipus Rex\". By contrast, in the other plays there is some struggle with Oedipus's sons Eteocles and Polynices in regard to the succession. In \"Oedipus at Colonus\", Sophocles attempts to work these inconsistencies into a coherent whole: Ismene explains that, in light of their tainted family lineage, her brothers were at first willing to cede the throne to Creon. Nevertheless, they eventually decided to take charge of the monarchy, with each brother disputing the other's right to succeed. In addition to being in a clearly more powerful position in \"Oedipus at Colonus\", Eteocles and Polynices are also culpable: they consent (l. 429, Theodoridis, tr.) to their father's going to exile, which is one of his bitterest charges against them.\nOther plays.\nIn addition to the three Theban plays, there are four surviving plays by Sophocles: \"Ajax\", \"Women of Trachis\", \"Electra\", and \"Philoctetes\", the last of which won first prize in 409 BC.\n\"Ajax\" focuses on the proud hero of the Trojan War, Telamonian Ajax, who is driven to treachery and eventually suicide. Ajax becomes gravely upset when Achilles's armor is presented to Odysseus instead of himself. Despite their enmity toward him, Odysseus persuades the kings Menelaus and Agamemnon to grant Ajax a proper burial.\n\"The Women of Trachis\" (named for the Trachinian women who make up the chorus) dramatizes Deianeira's accidentally killing Heracles after he had completed his famous twelve labors. Tricked into thinking it is a love charm, Deianeira applies poison to an article of Heracles's clothing; this poisoned robe causes Heracles to die an excruciating death. Upon learning the truth, Deianeira kills herself.\n\"Electra\" corresponds roughly to the plot of Aeschylus's \"Libation Bearers\". It details how Electra and Orestes avenge their father Agamemnon's murder by Clytemnestra and Aegisthus.\n\"Philoctetes\" retells the story of Philoctetes, an archer who had been abandoned on Lemnos by the rest of the Greek fleet while on the way to Troy. After learning that they cannot win the Trojan War without Philoctetes's bow, the Greeks send Odysseus and Neoptolemus to retrieve him; due to the Greeks' earlier treachery, however, Philoctetes refuses to rejoin the army. It is only Heracles's deus ex machina appearance that persuades Philoctetes to go to Troy.\nFragmentary plays.\nAlthough more than 120 titles of plays associated with Sophocles are known and presented below, little is known of the precise dating of most of them. \"Philoctetes\" is known to have been written in 409 BC, and \"Oedipus at Colonus\" is known to have only been performed in 401 BC, posthumously, at the initiation of Sophocles's grandson. The convention on writing plays for the Greek festivals was to submit them in tetralogies of three tragedies along with one satyr play. Along with the unknown dating of the vast majority of more than 120 plays, it is also largely unknown how the plays were grouped. It is, however, known that the three plays referred to in the modern era as the \"Theban plays\" were never performed together in Sophocles's own lifetime, and are therefore not a trilogy (which they are sometimes erroneously seen as).\nFragments of \"Ichneutae\" (\"Tracking Satyrs\") were discovered in Egypt in 1907. These amount to about half of the play, making it the best preserved satyr play after Euripides's \"Cyclops\", which survives in its entirety. Fragments of the \"Epigoni\" were discovered in April 2005 by classicists at Oxford University with the help of infrared technology previously used for satellite imaging. The tragedy tells the story of the second siege of Thebes. A number of other Sophoclean works have survived only in fragments, including:\nSophocles's view of his own work.\nThere is a passage of Plutarch's tract \"De Profectibus in Virtute 7 \" in which Sophocles discusses his own growth as a writer. A likely source of this material for Plutarch was the \"Epidemiae\" of Ion of Chios, a book that recorded many conversations of Sophocles; but a Hellenistic dialogue about tragedy, in which Sophocles appeared as a character, is also plausible. The former is a likely candidate to have contained Sophocles's discourse on his own development because Ion was a friend of Sophocles, and the book is known to have been used by Plutarch. Though some interpretations of Plutarch's words suggest that Sophocles says that he imitated Aeschylus, the translation does not fit grammatically, nor does the interpretation that Sophocles said that he was making fun of Aeschylus's works. C. M. Bowra argues for the following translation of the line:\n\"After practising to the full the bigness of Aeschylus, then the painful ingenuity of my own invention, now in the third stage I am changing to the kind of diction which is most expressive of character and best.\"\nHere Sophocles says that he has completed a stage of Aeschylus's work, meaning that he went through a phase of imitating Aeschylus's style but is finished with that. Sophocles's opinion of Aeschylus was mixed. He certainly respected him enough to imitate his work early on in his career, but he had reservations about Aeschylus's style, and thus did not keep his imitation up. Sophocles's first stage, in which he imitated Aeschylus, is marked by \"Aeschylean pomp in the language\". Sophocles's second stage was entirely his own. He introduced new ways of evoking feeling out of an audience, as in his \"Ajax\", when Ajax is mocked by Athene, then the stage is emptied so that he may commit suicide alone. Sophocles mentions a third stage, distinct from the other two, in his discussion of his development. The third stage pays more heed to diction. His characters spoke in a way that was more natural to them and more expressive of their individual character feelings.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "26985", "revid": "10202399", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26985", "title": "Salinity", "text": "Proportion of salt dissolved in water\nSalinity () is the saltiness or amount of salt dissolved in a body of water, called saline water (see also soil salinity). It is usually measured in g/L or g/kg (grams of salt per liter/kilogram of water; the latter is dimensionless and equal to \u2030). \nSalinity is an important factor in determining many aspects of the chemistry of natural waters and of biological processes within it, and is a thermodynamic state variable that, along with temperature and pressure, governs physical characteristics like the density and heat capacity of the water. These in turn are important for understanding ocean currents and heat exchange with the atmosphere.\nA contour line of constant salinity is called an \"isohaline\", or sometimes \"isohale\".\nDefinitions.\nSalinity in rivers, lakes, and the ocean is conceptually simple, but technically challenging to define and measure precisely. Conceptually the salinity is the quantity of dissolved salt content of the water. Salts are compounds like sodium chloride, magnesium sulfate, potassium nitrate, and sodium bicarbonate which dissolve into ions. The concentration of dissolved chloride ions is sometimes referred to as chlorinity. Operationally, dissolved matter is defined as that which can pass through a very fine filter (historically a filter with a pore size of 0.45 \u03bcm, but later usually 0.2 \u03bcm). Salinity can be expressed in the form of a mass fraction, i.e. the mass of the dissolved material in a unit mass of solution.\nSeawater typically has a mass salinity of around 35 g/kg, although lower values are typical near coasts where rivers enter the ocean. Rivers and lakes can have a wide range of salinities, from less than 0.01 g/kg to a few g/kg, although there are many places where higher salinities are found. The Dead Sea has a salinity of more than 200 g/kg. Precipitation typically has a TDS of 20 mg/kg or less.\nWhatever pore size is used in the definition, the resulting salinity value of a given sample of natural water will not vary by more than a few percent (%). Physical oceanographers working in the abyssal ocean, however, are often concerned with precision and intercomparability of measurements by different researchers, at different times, to almost five significant digits. A bottled seawater product known as IAPSO Standard Seawater is used by oceanographers to standardize their measurements with enough precision to meet this requirement.\nComposition.\nMeasurement and definition difficulties arise because natural waters contain a complex mixture of many different elements from different sources (not all from dissolved salts) in different molecular forms. The chemical properties of some of these forms depend on temperature and pressure. Many of these forms are difficult to measure with high accuracy, and in any case complete chemical analysis is not practical when analyzing multiple samples. Different practical definitions of salinity result from different attempts to account for these problems, to different levels of precision, while still remaining reasonably easy to use.\nFor practical reasons salinity is usually related to the sum of masses of a subset of these dissolved chemical constituents (so-called \"solution salinity\"), rather than to the unknown mass of salts that gave rise to this composition (an exception is when artificial seawater is created). For many purposes this sum can be limited to a set of eight major ions in natural waters, although for seawater at highest precision an additional seven minor ions are also included. The major ions dominate the inorganic composition of most (but by no means all) natural waters. Exceptions include some pit lakes and waters from some hydrothermal springs.\nThe concentrations of dissolved gases like oxygen and nitrogen are not usually included in descriptions of salinity. However, carbon dioxide gas, which when dissolved is partially converted into carbonates and bicarbonates, is often included. Silicon in the form of silicic acid, which usually appears as a neutral molecule in the pH range of most natural waters, may also be included for some purposes (e.g., when salinity/density relationships are being investigated).\nSeawater.\nThe term \"salinity\" is, for oceanographers, usually associated with one of a set of specific measurement techniques. As the dominant techniques evolve, so do different descriptions of salinity. Salinities were measured mainly using titration-based techniques before the 1980s. Titration with silver nitrate could be used to determine the concentration of halide ions (mainly chlorine and bromine) to give a chlorinity. The chlorinity was then multiplied by a factor to account for all other constituents. The resulting 'Knudsen salinities' are expressed in units of parts per thousand (ppt or \u2030).\nThe use of electrical conductivity measurements to estimate the ionic content of seawater led to the development of the scale called the \"practical salinity scale 1978\" (PSS-78). Salinities measured using PSS-78 do not have units. The suffix psu or PSU (denoting \"practical salinity unit\") is sometimes added to PSS-78 measurement values. The addition of PSU as a unit after the value is \"formally incorrect and strongly discouraged\".\nIn 2010, a new standard for the properties of seawater called the \"thermodynamic equation of seawater 2010\" (TEOS-10) was introduced, advocating absolute salinity as a replacement for practical salinity, and conservative temperature as a replacement for potential temperature. This standard includes a new scale called the \"reference composition salinity scale\". Absolute salinities on this scale are expressed as a mass fraction, in grams per kilogram of solution. Salinities on this scale are determined by combining electrical conductivity measurements with other information that accounts for regional changes in seawater composition. They can also be determined by making direct density measurements.\nA sample of seawater from most locations with a chlorinity of 19.37\u00a0ppt will have a Knudsen salinity of 35.00\u00a0ppt, a PSS-78 practical salinity of about 35.0, and a TEOS-10 absolute salinity of about 35.2\u00a0g/kg. The electrical conductivity of this water at a temperature of 15\u00a0\u00b0C is 42.9 mS/cm.\nOn a global scale, human-caused climate change has contributed to observed changes in surface and subsurface salinity since the 1950s. Projections of surface salinity changes throughout the 21st century indicate that fresh ocean regions will continue to get fresher and salty regions will continue to get saltier.\nSalinity serves as a tracer of different masses. Surface water is pulled in to replace the sinking water, which in turn eventually becomes cold and salty enough to sink. Salinity distribution contributes to shaping the oceanic circulation.\nLakes and rivers.\nLimnologists and chemists often define salinity in terms of mass of salt per unit volume, expressed in units of mg/L or g/L. It is implied, although often not stated, that this value applies accurately only at some reference temperature because solution volume varies with temperature. Values presented in this way are typically accurate to the order of 1%. Limnologists also use electrical conductivity, or \"reference conductivity\", as a proxy for salinity. This measurement may be corrected for temperature effects, and is usually expressed in units of \u03bcS/cm.\nA river or lake water with a salinity of around 70\u00a0mg/L will typically have a specific conductivity at 25 \u00b0C of between 80 and 130 \u03bcS/cm. The actual ratio depends on the ions present. The actual conductivity usually changes by about 2% per degree Celsius, so the measured conductivity at 5 \u00b0C might only be in the range of 50\u201380 \u03bcS/cm.\nDirect density measurements are also used to estimate salinities, particularly in highly saline lakes. Sometimes density at a specific temperature is used as a proxy for salinity. At other times an empirical salinity/density relationship developed for a particular body of water is used to estimate the salinity of samples from a measured density.\nClassification of water bodies based upon salinity.\nMarine waters are those of the ocean, another term for which is \"euhaline seas\". The salinity of euhaline seas is 30 to 35 \u2030. \"Brackish seas\" or waters have salinity in the range of 0.5 to 29 \u2030 and \"metahaline seas\" from 36 to 40 \u2030. These waters are all regarded as \"thalassic\" because their salinity is derived from the ocean and defined as \"homoiohaline\" if salinity does not vary much over time (essentially constant). The table on the right, modified from Por (1972), follows the \"Venice system\" (1959).\nIn contrast to homoiohaline environments are certain \"poikilohaline\" environments (which may also be \"thalassic\") in which the salinity variation is biologically significant. \"Poikilohaline\" water salinities may range anywhere from 0.5 to greater than 300 \u2030. The important characteristic is that these waters tend to vary in salinity over some biologically meaningful range seasonally or on some other roughly comparable time scale. Put simply, these are bodies of water with quite variable salinity.\nHighly saline water, from which salts crystallize (or are about to), is referred to as brine.\nEnvironmental considerations.\nSalinity is an ecological factor of considerable importance, influencing the types of organisms that live in a body of water. As well, salinity influences the kinds of plants that will grow either in a water body, or on land fed by a water (or by a groundwater). A plant adapted to saline conditions is called a halophyte. A halophyte which is tolerant to residual sodium carbonate salinity are called glasswort or saltwort or barilla plants. Organisms (mostly bacteria) that can live in very salty conditions are classified as extremophiles, or halophiles specifically. An organism that can withstand a wide range of salinities is euryhaline.\nSalts are expensive to remove from water, and salt content is an important factor in water use, factoring into potability and suitability for irrigation. Increases in salinity have been observed in lakes and rivers in the United States, due to common road salt and other salt de-icers in runoff.\nThe degree of salinity in oceans is a driver of the world's ocean circulation, where density changes due to both salinity changes and temperature changes at the surface of the ocean produce changes in buoyancy, which cause the sinking and rising of water masses. Changes in the salinity of the oceans are thought to contribute to global changes in carbon dioxide as more saline waters are less soluble to carbon dioxide. In addition, during glacial periods, the hydrography is such that a possible cause of reduced circulation is the production of stratified oceans. In such cases, it is more difficult to subduct water through the thermohaline circulation. \nNot only is salinity a driver of ocean circulation, but changes in ocean circulation also affect salinity, particularly in the subpolar North Atlantic where from 1990 to 2010 increased contributions of Greenland meltwater were counteracted by increased northward transport of salty Atlantic waters. However, North Atlantic waters have become fresher since the mid-2010s due to increased Greenland meltwater flux.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It contains 15 families and around 100 genera, with nearly 2,500 species. Well-known and economically important members of this order include saxifrages (after whom the order is named), blackcurrants, redcurrants, gooseberries, peonies, liquidambars, witch-hazel, Persian ironwood, katsura, jade plant, houseleeks, and water milfoil.\nOf the 15 families, many are small, with eight of them being monotypic (having only a single genus). The largest family is the Crassulaceae (stonecrops), a diverse group of mostly succulent plants, with about 35 genera. Saxifragales are found worldwide, primarily in temperate to subtropical zones, rarely being encountered growing wild in the tropics; however, many species are now cultivated throughout the world as knowledge of plant husbandry has improved. They can be found in a wide variety of environments, from deserts to fully aquatic habitats, with species adapted to alpine, forested or fully-aquatic habitats. Many are epiphytic or lithophytic, growing on exposed cliff faces, on trees or on rocks, and not requiring a highly organic or nutrient-dense substrate to thrive. \nGlobally, the saxifrages have a wide variety of uses by humans, ranging from textiles and timber to foodstuffs. Several families\u2014such as the aforementioned Crassulaceae\u2014and genera are of significant commercial importance in some countries and economies, being cultivated on a large scale for sale as ornamental plants. Apart from ornamentals, another highly-prized group are the Grossulariaceae (currants and gooseberries), particularly blackcurrants, redcurrants and white currants. \nOverall, the order is extremely diverse, encompassing numerous trees, shrubs, perennial herbs and succulent plants, as well as aquatic and semi-aquatic species. The order's high degree of diversity, in terms of vegetative and reproductive traits (and sheer amount of species), can make it challenging to find any common or unifying features amongst the respective genera.\nIn the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group classification system, the Saxifragales are placed within the major division of flowering plants referred to as eudicots, specifically the core eudicots. This subgroup consists of the Dilleniaceae, superasterids and superrosids. The superrosids, in turn, have two components, rosids and Saxifragales. The Saxifragales order has undergone considerable revision since its original classification, which had been based purely on plant characteristics. The modern classification is based on genetic studies, using molecular phylogenetics. There is an extensive fossil record from the Turonian-Campanian phase of the late Cretaceous, dating to about 90 million years ago (Myr). However, molecular studies may suggest an older origin, from the early Cretaceous (102\u2013108\u00a0Myr), with rapid and early diversification to more modern forms.\nDescription.\nThe order Saxifragales is extremely morphologically diverse (hyper-diverse). It includes trees (e.g. witch hazel, witch alder in Hamamelidaceae), fruit bearing shrubs (e.g. currants, gooseberries in Grossulariaceae), lianas, annual and perennial herbs, rock garden plants (e.g. saxifrage in Saxifragaceae), ornamental garden plants (e.g. peonies in Paeoniaceae), succulents (e.g. stonecrop in Crassulaceae) and aquatics (e.g. watermilfoil in Haloragaceae). The flowers demonstrate major variations in sepal, petal, stamen, and carpel number, as well as ovary position (\"see\" Biogeography and evolution).\nThis degree of diversity makes defining synapomorphy (derived common characteristics) for the group extremely difficult, the order being defined on the basis of molecular affinity rather than morphology. However, some characteristics that are prevalent (common traits) represent potential or putative synapomorphies based on ancestral states. These include flowers that are usually radially symmetric and petals that are free. The gynoecium (female reproductive part) generally consists of two carpels (ovary, style and stigma) that are free, at least toward the apex (partially fused bicarpellate gynoecium) and possess a hypanthium (cup shaped basal floral tube). In the androecium (male reproductive part), the stamen anthers are generally basifixed (attached at its base to the filament), sometimes dorsifixed (attached at centre) (\"see Figure 2\"). Other commonly occurring features are fruit that is generally follicular (formed from a single carpel), seeds with abundant endosperm surrounding the embryo and leaves with glandular teeth at their margins (glandular dentate, \"see image\"). Within the Saxifragales, while the families of the woody clade are primarily woody, the primarily herbaceous families of Crassulaceae and Saxifragaceae exhibit woody features as a secondary transition.\nTaxonomy.\nSaxifragales is a relatively small angiosperm order, having only 15 families, about 100 genera and about 2,470 species.\nHistory.\nSaxifragales was first described in 1820 by Berchtold and Presl as a group of plants, Saxifrageae, with five genera, including \"Saxifraga\", lending their names as the botanical authority (Bercht. &amp; J.Presl). At times, that authority has also been given to Dumortier, due to a later publication (1829). Dumortier first used the word Saxifragaceae. By the time of John Lindley's \"The Vegetable Kingdom\" (1853), the term Saxifragales was in use, which Lindley called an Alliance, containing five families. Later, the Saxifragales were placed in the angiosperm class Dicotyledons, also called Magnoliopsida.\nPhylogeny.\nThe order Saxifragales has undergone considerable revision in both placement and composition, since the use of molecular phylogenetics, and the use of the modern Angiosperm Phylogeny Group (APG) classification. They are identified as a strongly monophyletic group.\nIn the initial APG publication (1998), the Saxifragales were identified within the core eudicots clade but its relationship to other clades was uncertain. The core eudicots consist of the order Gunnerales and a large clade of Pentapetalae (so named for having a synapomorphy of pentamerous (5 part) perianths), the latter representing about 70% of all angiosperms, with eight major lineages. Later (2003), the order was described as \"one of the major surprises of molecular phylogenetic analyses of the angiosperms\", having elements previously placed in three or four separate subclasses based on morphology. This was eventually resolved in the third APG system (2009), placing Saxifragales as a sister group to the rosids (Rosidae), within the Pentapetalae clade. This large combination has subsequently been given the name superrosids (Superrosidae), representing part of an early diversification of the angiosperms. Among the rosids, they share a number of similarities with the Rosales, particularly Rosaceae, including a hypanthium, five part flowers and free floral parts. As circumscribed, Saxifragales account for 1.3% of eudicot diversity.\nBiogeography and evolution.\nDiversification among Saxifragales was rapid, with the extensive fossil record indicating that the order was more diverse and more widespread than an examination of the extant members suggests, with considerable phenotypic diversity occurring early. The earliest fossil evidence is found in the Turonian-Campanian (late Cretaceous), suggesting a minimum age of 89.5\u00a0Myr. However, molecular divergence time estimation suggest an earlier time of 102\u2013108\u00a0Myr, into the early Cretaceous, for the crown and stem groups respectively. Within the order Saxifragales, the molecular data imply a very rapid initial diversification time of about 6\u20138\u00a0Myr, between 112 and 120\u00a0Myr, with major lineages appearing within 3\u20136\u00a0Myr.\nThe ancestral state appears to be woody, as in Peridiscaceae and the woody clade, but is also ancestral to Grossulariaceae. A number of independent transitions to a herbaceous habit occurred in the ancestors of Crassulaceae, Saxifragaceae and the base of the Haloragaceae-Penthoraceae clade (the other two families in Haloragaceae \"s.l.\" remaining woody), while other taxa reverted to a woody habit, especially Crassulaceae. Most of Saxifragales have a superior ovary, but some families show frequent transition with inferior or subinferior position, particularly Saxifragaceae and to a lesser extent Hamamelidaceae. Almost all Grossulariaceae have an inferior ovary. The ancestral carpel number is two, with transition to higher numbers, such as four in Haloragaceae \"s.l.\" and Peridiscaceae with five in Penthoraceae. The ancestral carpel number for Crassulaceae is five, decreasing to four in \"Kalanchoe\", where it is synapomorphic for the genus, though the most frequent transition in this family is 6\u201310, but only where stamen number is increased above five. Some Macaronesian taxa (Aeonieae) have 8\u201312, with up to 32 carpels for \"Aeonium\".\nThe ancestral petal number is five, with three major transitions; 5 to 0, 5 to 4, 5 to 6\u201310. Increased petal number is seen in Paeoniaceae and Crassulaceae, particularly where stamen number is also increased. Cercidiphyllum + Daphniphyllum, Chrysosplenium and \"Altingia\" are examples of the complete loss of petals. The ancestral stamen:petal ratio is 1, with transitions characterising several clades, e.g. Paeonicaceae+woody clade &gt;2, Crassulaceae 2 (but \"Crassula\" 1). Overall there has been a decrease over evolution, but independent of a decrease in petal number, so that it is the stamen number that has decreased. The ancestral habitat appears to be forests, followed by early diversification into desert and aquatic habitats, with shrubland the most recent colonization.\nSpecies diversification was rapid following a transition from a warmer, wetter Earth in the Eocene (56\u201340\u00a0Myr) to early Miocene (23\u201316\u00a0Myr), to the cooler drier conditions of the mid-Miocene (16\u201312\u00a0Myr). However, this appears to not have coincided with ecological and phenotypic evolution, which are themselves correlated. There is a clear lag, whereby increase in species diversification was followed later by increases in niche and phenotypic lability.\nSubdivision.\nThe first APG classification (1998) placed 13 families within the order Saxifragales: \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nThis was subsequently revised to 15, in the fourth version (2016). The Saxifragales families have been grouped into a number of informally named suprafamilial subclades, with the exception of the basal split of Peridiscaceae, which thus forms a sister group with the rest of Saxifragales. The two major ones are (Paeoniaceae + the woody clade of primarily woody families) and the \"core\" Saxifragales (i.e. the primarily herbaceous families), with the latter subdivided into two further subclades, (Haloragaceae \"sensu lato\" + Crassulaceae) and the Saxifragaceae alliance.\nIn the clade Haloragaceae \"sensu lato\" \"(s.l.)\" + Crassulaceae the genera constituting Haloragaceae \"s.l.\" are all small, and APG II (2003) proposed merging them into a single larger Haloragaceae \"s.l.\", but transferred \"Aphanopetalum\" from Cunoniaceae to this group. The Saxifragaceae alliance represents Saxifragaceae together with a number of woody members of the traditional Saxifragaceae \"sensu\" Engler (1930). Within this, APG II (2003) proposed placing the two species of \"Pterostemon\" that constitute Pterostemonaceae within Iteaceae, and all subsequent versions have maintained this practice. Thus Saxifragales \"sensu\" APG II consisted of only 10 families. The third version (2009) added Peridiscaceae (from Malpighiales), as sister to all other families, but re-expanded Haloragaceae to provide for a narrower circumscription, Haloragaceae \"sensu stricto\" (\"s.s.\"), to give a total of 14 families. APG IV (2016) added the parasitic family Cynomoriaceae to provide a total of 15 families, although its placement within the order remained unclear.\nOf the 15 families included in APG IV, the basal divergence Peridiscaceae underwent radical shifting and recircumscription from 2003 to 2009. Originally, it consisted of two closely related genera, \"Peridiscus\" and \"Whittonia\". The APG II system placed the family in Malpighiales, based on a DNA sequence for the \"rbcL\" gene from \"Whittonia\". This sequence turned out to be not from \"Whittonia\", but from other plants whose DNA had contaminated the sample. After placement in Saxifragales, it was expanded to include \"Soyauxia\" in 2007, and \"Medusandra\" in 2009.\nIn the first of the subclades of the remaining Saxifragales, Paeoniaceae possesses many unique features and its taxonomic position was controversial for a long time, and \"Paeonia\" was placed in Ranunculales, close to \"Glaucidium\", prior to transfer to Saxifragales as sister to the woody clade.\nIn the woody clade, the genus \"Liquidambar\" was included in Hamamelidaceae until molecular phylogenetic studies showed that its inclusion might make Hamamelidaceae paraphyletic, and was segregated as a separate monotypic family, Altingiaceae in 2008. Cercidiphyllaceae was for a long time associated with Hamamelidaceae and Trochodendraceae and was often thought to be closer to the latter, which is now in the basal eudicot order Trochodendrales. \"Daphniphyllum\" was always thought to have an anomalous combination of characters and was placed in several different orders before molecular phylogenetic analysis showed it to belong to Saxifragales.\nIn the core Saxifragales, Crassulaceae and Tetracarpaeaceae have been associated with Saxifragaceae, while \"Penthorum\" has been associated both with Crassulaceae and Saxifragaceae, before being placed here. \"Aphanopetalum\" was often placed in Cunoniaceae, a family in Oxalidales, even though there were good reasons to put it in Saxifragales, and it was subsequently transferred. Haloragaceae was included in Myrtales, before being placed in Saxifragales.\nThe other \"core\" group, the Saxifragaceae alliance comprises four families: Pterostemonaceae, Iteaceae, Grossulariaceae, and Saxifragaceae, which have long been known to be related to each other, but the circumscription of Saxifragaceae has been much reduced and Pterostemonaceae submerged as \"Pterostemon\" in Iteaceae.\nMost of the families are monogeneric. \"Choristylis\" is now considered a synonym of \"Itea\", but the addition of \"Pterostemon\", gives Iteaceae two genera. \"Liquidambar\" and \"Semiliquidambar\" are also submerged into \"Altingia\", making Altingiaceae monogeneric. About 95% of the species are in five families: Crassulaceae (1400), Saxifragaceae (500), Grossulariaceae (150\u2013200), Haloragaceae (150), and Hamamelidaceae (100).\nThe relationships of the Saxifragales families to each other is shown in the following cladogram. The phylogeny in this cladogram still has some uncertainty as to the exact relationships, and the phylogenetic tree is subject to further revision. Cynomoriaceae, previously placed in Santales or Rosales is included in Saxifragales, but unplaced within it. Li et al. (2019) have slightly different relationships, and also place Cynomoriaceae as the first branch in the Crassulaceae+Haloragaceae \"s.l.\" tree, i.e. as sister to those two families. The number of genera in each family is shown in parentheses:\nDistribution and habitat.\nSaxifragales are found worldwide, though primarily in temperate zones and rarely in the tropics. They occupy a wide variety of habitats from arid desert (Crassulaceae) to aquatic conditions (Haloragaceae), with 6 families, including North American species, that are obligate aquatic (fully dependent on an aquatic environment), and including forests, grasslands and tundra. Saxifragales exceeds all other comparably sized clades in terms of diversity of habitats. Most of the diversity occurs in temperate (including montane and arid) conditions that expanded globally during cooling and drying trends in the last 15 My.\nThe most common habitats are forests and cliffs, with about 300 species occupying each, but with forests being the most diverse phenotypically, where nearly all families are represented. In contrast, desert and tundra, with only two families each, contain only about 10% of species. About 90% of species can be assigned to a single habitat.\nConservation.\n\"Whittonia\" (Peridiscaceae) is thought to be extinct. As of 2019[ [update]] the IUCN lists 9 critically endangered, 12 endangered, 19 vulnerable and 7 near threatened species. Among the most threatened Saxifragales are \"Aichryson dumosum\" and \"Monanthes wildpretii\" (Crassulaceae), \"Haloragis stokesii\" and \"Myriophyllum axilliflorum\" (Haloragaceae), \"Ribes malvifolium\" and \"R. sardoum\" (Grossulariaceae), \"Saxifraga artvinensis\" (Saxifragaceae) and \"Molinadendron hondurense\" (Hamamelidaceae).\nCultivation.\nA number of Saxifragales genera are commercially cultivated. \"Paeonia\" are cultivated both as ornamental shrubs (generally sold as root stock) and for cut flowers, with the Netherlands representing the largest production, other more minor producers are Israel, New Zealand, Chile and the United States. \"Liquidambar\" is used for hardwood, with the American Sweetgum (\"Liquidambar styraciflua\") being among the most important sources of commercial hardwood in the Southeast United States, with one of its uses being veneer for plywood. \"Hamamelis\" is cultivated in New England for distilleries extracting witch-hazel, widely used in skincare, and is the largest source of this medicament in the world. Among the Crassulaceae, economic importance is limited to horticulture, with many species and cultivars important as ornamentals, including \"Crassula ovata\" (jade plant) and \"Jovibarba\" (hen and chicken). \"Hylotelphium\", \"Phedimus\", \"Sedum\" and \"Sempervivum\" are cultivated for rock gardens and for \"green roofs\". In particular, cultivars of the Madagascan \"Kalanchoe blossfeldiana\", e.g. 'Florists kalanchoe' have achieved commercial success throughout the world, being popular Christmas decorative plants. The Haloragaceae aquatic genus \"Myriophyllum\" and the closely related \"Proserpinaca\" are cultivated for the commercial aquarium trade. \"Myriophyllum\" is also economically important for purification of water and as feed for pigs, ducks, and fish, and polishing wood. \nA number of \"Ribes\" (Grossulariaceae) are in commercial production, concentrated in Europe and the USSR from species native to those areas. \"R. nigrum\" (blackcurrant) was first cultivated in monastery gardens in Russia in the 11th century, and currant cultivation more generally later in Western Europe, \"R. uva-crispa\" (gooseberry) production began around 1700. The first colonists in North America began cultivating currants in the late 1700s. \"R. nigrum\" is the most important commercial currant crop, being produced in more than 23 countries, with the major centres being Russia (more than 63 thousand hectares), Poland, Germany, Scandinavia and the UK. An important source of Vitamin C, black currants are used in the manufacture of jam, fruit jelly, compote, syrup, juice and other drinks, including the cordial Ribena and the liqueur Cassis. Other commercial crops include \"R. rubrum\" (red currant). World \"Ribes\" crop production was over 750,000 tons in 2002, of which about 150,000 tons were gooseberries, and the largest group blackcurrants.\nUses.\nPlants in the order Saxifragales have found a wide variety of uses, including traditional medicines, ornamental, household, aquarium, pond and garden plants, spices, foodstuffs (fruit and greens), dyestuffs, smoking, resin, timber, and roof coverings.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The last models to be released worldwide were the PEG-TJ27, PEG-TJ37, and PEG-TH55. The last model released in Japan was the PEG-VZ90. Soon after the closure of the CLI\u00c9 line, Sony stopped providing original installation drivers, including Sony's version of Palm Desktop for the CLI\u00c9, which are necessary for Hotsyncing with the PC and otherwise taking advantage of the handhelds' many features for which a PC may be needed.

This allowed for synchronizing the basic personal information manager (PIM) functions, and for installing new software, though this ability was unusable because the Mac HotSync software would not recognize the handheld. PalmSource, however, silently added the ability to recognize older CLI\u00c9 devices when providing new versions of its Palm Desktop software for Mac. This was necessary for those who could synchronize only via USB.\nThe CLI\u00c9 user community soon discovered that these \"updates\" were simply a matter of adding a few lines to the USB-detection property-list file. Since then, detailed http:// have been posted online for those who want to synchronize their CLI\u00c9 handhelds. No modifications are required for Bluetooth synchronizing, but Wi-Fi synchronizing is impossible because the Mac OS HotSync software does not support network synchronizing. Some workarounds for the multimedia features also exist. For those who desire stronger Mac OS/CLI\u00c9 integration, the product Missing Sync made by the company Mark/Space is also available. This does make unencrypted Wi-Fi synchronizing possible but a bug in the CLI\u00c9 network stack reverses IP addresses which means that the Macintosh involved needs a palindromic IP address such as 10.0.0.10.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The Sony Group encompasses various businesses, including electronics (Sony Corporation), imaging and sensing (Sony Semiconductor Solutions), film (Sony Pictures Entertainment), music (Sony Music Group and Sony Music Entertainment Japan), video games (Sony Interactive Entertainment), and others.\nSony was founded in 1946 as initially by Masaru Ibuka and Akio Morita. In 1958, the company adopted the name Initially an electronics firm, it gained early recognition for products such as the TR-55 transistor radio and the CV-2000 home video tape recorder, contributing significantly to Japan's post-war economic recovery. After Ibuka's retirement in the 1970s, Morita served as chairman until 1994, overseeing Sony's rise as a global brand recognized for innovation in consumer electronics. Landmark products included the Trinitron color television, the Walkman portable audio player, and the co-development of the compact disc.\nExpanding beyond electronics, Sony acquired Columbia Records in 1988 and Columbia Pictures in 1989, while also entering the home video game console market with the launch of the PlayStation in 1994. In Japan, the company further diversified by establishing a financial services division, that would be turned into a separate company in September 2025, with the group maintaining 20% of the shares. In 2021, the company was renamed Sony Group Corporation as it transitioned into a holding company structure, with its electronics business continuing under the name Sony Corporation.\nAs of 2020[ [update]], Sony holds a 55% share of the global image sensor market, making it the largest image sensor manufacturer, the second largest camera manufacturer, a semiconductor sales leader, and the world's third-largest television manufacturer by sales.\nAlthough Sony is not part of a traditional \"keiretsu\", it has historical ties to the Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group, dating back to the 1950s when it relied exclusively on Mitsui Bank for financing. Sony is publicly traded on the Tokyo Stock Exchange (a component of the Nikkei 225 and TOPIX Core30 indices) and also maintains American depositary receipts on the New York Stock Exchange, where it has been listed since 1961. As of 2021, it ranked 88th on the \"Fortune\" Global 500 and 57th on the 2023 \"Forbes\" Global 2000 list.\nHistory.\nTokyo Tsushin Kogyo.\nSony began in the wake of World War II. In 1946, Masaru Ibuka started an electronics shop in Shirokiya, a department store building in the Nihonbashi area of Tokyo. The company started with a capital of \u00a5190,000 and a total of eight employees. On 7 May 1946, Ibuka was joined by Akio Morita to establish a company called . The company built Japan's first tape recorder, called the Type-G. In 1958, the company changed its name to \"Sony\".\nName.\n\"Tokyo Tsushin Kogyo\" founders Morita and Ibuka realized that to achieve success and grow, their business had to expand to the global market, which required labeling their products with a short and easy brand name. While looking for a romanized name, they at first strongly considered using their initials, TTK. The primary reason they did not is that the railway company Tokyo Kyuko was known as TTK. The company occasionally used the syllabic acronym \"Totsuko\" in Japan, but during his visit to the United States, Morita discovered that Americans had trouble pronouncing that name. Another early name that was tried out for a while was \"Tokyo Teletech\" until Akio Morita discovered that there was an American company already using Teletech as a brand name.\nThe name \"Sony\" was chosen for the brand as a mix of two words: one was the Latin word \"\"sonus\", which is the root of sonic and sound, and the other was \"sonny\"\", a common slang term used in 1950s America to call a young boy. In 1950s Japan, \"sonny boys\" was a loan word in Japanese, which connoted smart and presentable young men, which Akio Morita and Masaru Ibuka considered themselves to be.\nThe first Sony-branded product, the TR-55 transistor radio, appeared in 1955, but the company name did not change to Sony until January 1958.\nAt the time of the change, it was extremely unusual for a Japanese company to use Roman letters to spell its name instead of writing it in kanji. The move was not without opposition: TTK's principal bank at the time, Mitsui, had strong feelings about the name. They pushed for a name such as Sony Electronic Industries, or Sony Teletech. Akio Morita was firm, however, as he did not want the company name tied to any particular industry. Eventually, both Ibuka and Mitsui Bank's chairman gave their approval.\nGlobalization.\nAccording to Schiffer, Sony's TR-63 radio \"cracked open the U.S. market and launched the new industry of consumer microelectronics.\" By the mid-1950s, American teens had begun buying portable transistor radios in huge numbers, helping to propel the fledgling industry from an estimated 100,000 units in 1955 to 5\u00a0million units by the end of 1968.\nSony co-founder Akio Morita founded Sony Corporation of America in 1960. In the process, he was struck by the mobility of employees between American companies, which was unheard of in Japan at that time. When he returned to Japan, he encouraged experienced, middle-aged employees of other companies to reevaluate their careers and consider joining Sony. The company filled many positions in this manner, and inspired other Japanese companies to do the same. Moreover, Sony played a major role in the development of Japan as a powerful exporter during the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, supplying the U.S. Military with bomb parts used in the Vietnam War. It also helped to significantly improve American perceptions of \"made in Japan\" products. Known for its production quality, Sony was able to charge above-market prices for its consumer electronics and resisted lowering prices.\nIn 1971, Masaru Ibuka handed the position of president over to his co-founder Akio Morita. Sony began a life insurance company in 1979, one of its many peripheral businesses. Amid a global recession in the early 1980s, electronics sales dropped and the company was forced to cut prices. Sony's profits fell sharply. \"It's over for Sony\", one analyst concluded. \"The company's best days are behind it.\"\nAround that time, Norio Ohga took up the role of president. He encouraged the development of the compact disc (CD) in the 1970s and 1980s, and of the PlayStation in the early 1990s. Ohga went on to purchase CBS Records in 1988 and Columbia Pictures in 1989, greatly expanding Sony's media presence. Ohga would succeed Morita as chief executive officer in 1989.\nUnder the vision of co-founder Akio Morita and his successors, the company had aggressively expanded into new businesses. Part of its motivation for doing so was the pursuit of \"convergence\", linking film, music and digital electronics via the Internet. This expansion proved unrewarding and unprofitable, threatening Sony's ability to charge a premium on its products as well as its brand name. In 2005, Howard Stringer replaced Nobuyuki Idei as chief executive officer, marking the first time that a foreigner had run a major Japanese electronics firm. Stringer helped to reinvigorate the company's struggling media businesses, encouraging blockbusters such as \"Spider-Man\" while cutting 9,000 jobs. He hoped to sell off peripheral business and focus the company again on electronics. Furthermore, he aimed to increase cooperation between business units, which he described as \"silos\" operating in isolation from one another. In a bid to provide a unified brand for its global operations, Sony introduced a slogan known as \"make.believe\" in 2009.\nDespite some successes, the company faced continued struggles in the mid- to late-2000s. In 2012, Kazuo Hirai was promoted to president and CEO, replacing Stringer. Shortly thereafter, Hirai outlined his company-wide initiative, named \"One Sony\" to revive Sony from years of financial losses and bureaucratic management structure, which proved difficult for former CEO Stringer to accomplish, partly due to differences in business culture and native languages between Stringer and some of Sony's Japanese divisions and subsidiaries. Hirai outlined three major areas of focus for Sony's electronics business, which include imaging technology, gaming and mobile technology, as well as a focus on reducing the major losses from the television business.\nIn February 2014, Sony announced the sale of its Vaio PC division to a new corporation owned by investment fund Japan Industrial Partners and spinning its TV division into its own corporation as to make it more nimble to turn the unit around from past losses totaling $7.8\u00a0billion over a decade. Later that month, they announced that they would be closing 20 stores. In April, the company announced that they would be selling 9.5\u00a0million shares in Square Enix (roughly 8.2 percent of the game company's total shares) in a deal worth approximately $48\u00a0million. In May 2014 the company announced it was forming two joint ventures with Shanghai Oriental Pearl Group to manufacture and market Sony's PlayStation game consoles and associated software in China.\nIn 2015, Sony purchased Toshiba's image sensor business.\nIt was reported in December 2016 by multiple news outlets that Sony was considering restructuring its U.S. operations by merging its TV &amp; film business, Sony Pictures Entertainment, with its gaming business, Sony Interactive Entertainment. According to the reports, such a restructuring would have placed Sony Pictures under Sony Interactive's CEO, Andrew House, though House would not have taken over day-to-day operations of the film studio. According to one report, Sony was set to make a final decision on the possibility of the merger of the TV, film, &amp; gaming businesses by the end of its fiscal year in March of the following year (2017).\nIn 2017, Sony sold its lithium-ion battery business to Murata Manufacturing.\nIn 2019, Sony merged its mobile, TV and camera businesses.\nOn 1 April 2020, Sony Electronics Corporation was established as an intermediate holding company to own and oversee its electronics and IT solutions businesses.\nOn 19 May 2020, the company announced that it would change its name to Sony Group Corporation as of 1 April 2021. Subsequently, Sony Electronics Corporation would be renamed to Sony Corporation. On the same day the company announced that it would turn Sony Financial Holdings (currently Sony Financial Group), of which Sony already owns 65.06% of shares, to a wholly owned subsidiary through a takeover bid.\nOn 1 April 2021, Sony Corporation was renamed Sony Group Corporation. On the same day, Sony Mobile Communications Inc. absorbed Sony Electronics Corporation, Sony Imaging Products &amp; Solutions Inc., and Sony Home Entertainment &amp; Sound Products Inc. and changed its trade name to Sony Corporation.\nFormats and technologies.\nSony has historically been notable for creating its own in-house standards for new recording and storage technologies, instead of adopting those of other manufacturers and standards bodies, while its success in the early years owes to a smooth capitalization on the Digital Compact Cassette standard introduced by Philips, with which Sony went on to enjoy a decades-long technological relationship in various areas. Sony (either alone or with partners) has introduced several of the most popular recording formats, including the 3.5-inch floppy disk, compact disc and Blu-ray disc.\nVideo recording.\nSony introduced U-matic, the world's first videocassette format, in 1971, but the standard was unpopular for domestic use due to the high price. The company subsequently launched the Betamax format in 1975. Sony was involved in the videotape format war of the early 1980s, when they were marketing the Betamax system for video cassette recorders against the VHS format developed by JVC. In the end, VHS gained critical mass in the marketbase and became the worldwide standard for consumer VCRs.\nBetamax is, for all practical purposes, an obsolete format. Sony's professional-oriented component video format called Betacam, which was derived from Betamax, was used until 2016 when Sony announced it was stopping production of all remaining 1/2-inch video tape recorders and players, including the Digital Betacam format.\nIn 1985, Sony launched their Handycam products and the Video8 format. Video8 and the follow-on hi-band Hi8 format became popular in the consumer camcorder market. In 1987 Sony launched the 4\u00a0mm DAT or Digital Audio Tape as a new digital audio tape standard.\nVisual display.\nSony held a patent for its proprietary Trinitron until 1996.\nSony introduced the Triluminos Display, the company's proprietary color reproduction enhancing technology, in 2004, featured in the world's first LED-backlit LCD televisions. It was widely used in other Sony's products as well, including computer monitors, laptops, and smartphones. In 2013, Sony released a new line of televisions with an improved version of the technology, which incorporated quantum dots in the backlight system. It was the first commercial use of quantum dots.\nIn 2012, the company revealed a prototype of an ultrafine RGB LED display, which it calls the Crystal LED Display.\nAudio recording.\nSony used the Compact Cassette format in many of its tape recorders and players, including the Walkman, the world's first portable music player. Sony introduced the MiniDisc format in 1992 as an alternative to Philips DCC or Digital Compact Cassette and as a successor to the Compact Cassette. Since the introduction of MiniDisc, Sony has attempted to promote its own audio compression technologies under the ATRAC brand, against the more widely used MP3. Until late 2004, Sony's Network Walkman line of digital portable music players did not support the MP3 standard natively.\nIn 2004, Sony built upon the MiniDisc format by releasing Hi-MD. Hi-MD allows the playback and recording of audio on newly introduced 1 GB Hi-MD discs in addition to playback and recording on regular MiniDiscs. In addition to saving audio on the discs, Hi-MD allows the storage of computer files such as documents, videos and photos.\nAudio encoding.\nIn 1993, Sony challenged the industry standard Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound format with a newer and more advanced proprietary motion picture digital audio format called SDDS (Sony Dynamic Digital Sound). This format employed eight channels (7.1) of audio opposed to just six used in Dolby Digital 5.1 at the time. Ultimately, SDDS has been vastly overshadowed by the preferred DTS (Digital Theatre System) and Dolby Digital standards in the motion picture industry. SDDS was solely developed for use in the theatre circuit; Sony never intended to develop a home theatre version of SDDS.\nSony and Philips jointly developed the Sony-Philips digital interface format (S/PDIF) and the high-fidelity audio system SACD. The latter became entrenched in a format war with DVD-Audio. Still, neither gained a major foothold with the general public. CDs had been preferred by consumers because of the ubiquitous presence of CD drives in consumer devices until the early 2000s when the iPod and streaming services became available.\nIn 2015, Sony introduced LDAC, a proprietary audio coding technology which allows streaming high-resolution audio over Bluetooth connections at up to 990\u00a0kbit/s at 32 bit/96\u00a0kHz. Sony also contributed it as part of the Android Open Source Project starting from Android 8.0 \"Oreo\", enabling every OEM to integrate this standard into their own Android devices freely. However the \"decoder\" library is proprietary, so receiving devices require licenses. On 17 September 2019, the Japan Audio Society (JAS) certified LDAC with their Hi-Res Audio Wireless certification. Currently the only codecs with the Hi-Res Audio Wireless certification are LDAC and LHDC, another competing standard.\nOptical storage.\nSony demonstrated an optical digital audio disc in 1977 and soon joined hands with Philips, another major contender for the storage technology, to establish a worldwide standard. In 1983, the two companies jointly announced the Compact Disc (CD). In 1984, Sony launched the Discman series, an expansion of the Walkman brand to portable CD players. Sony began to improve performance and capacity of the novel format. It launched write-once optical discs (WO) and magneto-optical discs which were around 125MB size for the specific use of archival data storage, in 1986 and 1988 respectively.\nIn the early 1990s, two high-density optical storage standards were being developed: one was the MultiMedia Compact Disc (MMCD), backed by Philips and Sony, and the other was the Super Density Disc (SD), supported by Toshiba and many others. Philips and Sony abandoned their MMCD format and agreed upon Toshiba's SD format with only one modification. The unified disc format was called DVD and was introduced in 1997.\nSony was one of the leading developers of the Blu-ray optical disc format, the newest standard for disc-based content delivery. The first Blu-ray players became commercially available in 2006. The format emerged as the standard for HD media over the competing format, Toshiba's HD DVD, after a two-year-long high-definition optical disc format war.\nSony's laser communication devices for small satellites rely on the technologies developed for the company's optical disc products.\nDisk storage.\nIn 1983, Sony introduced 90\u00a0mm micro diskettes, better known as floppy disks, which it had developed at a time when there were 4\" floppy disks, and many variations from different companies, to replace the then on-going 5.25\" floppy disks. Sony had great success and the format became dominant. 3.5\" floppy disks gradually became obsolete as they were replaced by current media formats. Sony held more than a 70 percent share of the market when it decided to pull the plug on the format in 2010.\nSony still develops magnetic tape storage technologies along with IBM, and are one of only two manufacturers of Linear Tape-Open (LTO) cartridges.\nFlash memory.\nIn 1998, Sony launched the Memory Stick format, the flash memory cards for use in Sony lines of digital cameras and portable music players. It has seen little support outside of Sony's own products, with Secure Digital cards (SD) commanding considerably greater popularity. Sony has made updates to the Memory Stick format with Memory Stick Duo and Memory Stick Micro. The company has also released USB flash drive products, branded under the Micro Vault line.\nCommunication.\nSony introduced FeliCa, a contactless IC card technology primarily used in contactless payment, as a result of the company's joint development and commercialization of Near-Field Communication (NFC) with Philips. The standard is largely offered in two forms, either chips embedded in smartphones or plastic cards with chips embedded in them. Sony plans to implement this technology in train systems across Asia.\nIn 2019, Sony launched the ELTRES, the company's proprietary low-power wide-area wireless communication (LPWAN) standard.\nVideo gaming.\nUntil 1991, Sony had little direct involvement with the video game industry. The company supplied components for other consoles, such as the sound chip for the Super Famicom from Nintendo, and operated a video game studio, Sony Imagesoft. As part of a joint project between Nintendo and Sony that began as early as 1988, the two companies worked to create a CD-ROM version of the Super Famicom, though Nintendo denied the existence of the Sony deal as late as March 1991. At the Consumer Electronics Show in June 1991, Sony revealed a Super Famicom with a built-in CD-ROM drive, named the \"Play Station\" (also known as SNES-CD). However, a day after the announcement at CES, Nintendo announced that it would be breaking its partnership with Sony, opting to go with Philips instead but using the same technology. The deal was broken by Nintendo after they were unable to come to an agreement on how revenue would be split between the two companies. The breaking of the partnership infuriated Sony President Norio Ohga, who responded by appointing Kutaragi with the responsibility of developing the PlayStation project to rival Nintendo.\nAt that time, negotiations were still on-going between Nintendo and Sony, with Nintendo offering Sony a \"non-gaming role\" regarding their new partnership with Philips. This proposal was swiftly rejected by Kutaragi who was facing increasing criticism over his work with regard to entering the video game industry from within Sony. Negotiations officially ended in May 1992 and in order to decide the fate of the PlayStation project, a meeting was held in June 1992, consisting of Sony President Ohga, PlayStation Head Kutaragi and several senior members of Sony's board. At the meeting, Kutaragi unveiled a proprietary CD-ROM-based system he had been working on which involved playing video games with 3D graphics to the board. Eventually, Sony President Ohga decided to retain the project after being reminded by Kutaragi of the humiliation he suffered from Nintendo. Nevertheless, due to strong opposition from a majority present at the meeting as well as widespread internal opposition to the project by the older generation of Sony executives, Kutaragi and his team had to be shifted from Sony's headquarters to Sony Music, a completely separate financial entity owned by Sony, so as to retain the project and maintain relationships with Philips for the MMCD development project (which helped lead to the creation of the DVD)\nContinued research and development.\nIn 2021, the WIPO's annual review of the World Intellectual Property Indicators report ranked Sony's as ninth in the world for the number of patent applications published under the PCT System. 1,793 patent applications were published by Sony during 2020. This position is up from their previous ranking as 13th in 2019 with 1,566 applications.\nBusiness units.\nSony offers a wide variety of product lines in many areas. At its peak, it was dubbed as a \"corporate octopus\", for its sprawling ventures from private insurance to chemicals to cosmetics to home shopping to a Tokyo-based French food joint, in addition its core businesses such as electronics and entertainment. Even after it has unwound many business units including Sony Chemicals and Vaio PC, Sony still runs diverse businesses.\nAs of 2020, Sony is organized into the following business segments: Game &amp; Network Services (G&amp;NS), Music, Pictures, Electronics Products &amp; Solutions (EP&amp;S), Imaging &amp; Sensing Solutions (I&amp;SS), Financial Services, and Others. Usually, each business segment has a handful of corresponding intermediate holding companies under which all the related businesses are folded into, such as Columbia Records being part of Sony Music Group, a subsidiary and, at the same time, a holding company for Sony's music businesses, along with SMEJ.\nElectronics products &amp; solutions.\nSony Corporation (Sony Electronics Corporation until 1 April 2021) is the electronics business unit of the Sony Group. It primarily conducts research and development (R&amp;D), planning, designing, manufacturing and marketing for electronics products. Sony Global Manufacturing &amp; Operations Corporation (SGMO) is a wholly owned subsidiary of Sony Corporation and responsible for managing manufacturing operations both in Japan and overseas, through its own factories as well as third party contract manufacturers.\nAudio.\nIn 1979, Sony released the world's first portable music player, the Walkman, bundled with the MDL-3L2 headphones. This line fostered a fundamental change in music listening habits by allowing people to carry music with them and listen to music through lightweight headphones. Originally used to refer to portable audio cassette players, the Walkman brand has been widely adopted by the company to encompass its portable digital audio and video players as well as a line of former Sony Ericsson mobile phones. In the case of optical disc players, the Discman brand was used until the late 1990s. In 2025, a model TPS-L2 cassette Walkman from 1979 was included in \",\" an exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art featuring \"widely recognized design icons [...] highlighting pivotal moments in design history.\" \nIn 1999 Sony's first portable digital audio players were introduced; one was a player using Memory Stick flash storage created by the Walkman division, and the other was a smaller pen-sized player with embedded flash storage created by the Vaio division; both accompanied with Sony's OpenMG copyright protection technology and PC software for music transfer. Sony continue to develop Walkman digital audio players, although it was unable to capture the large share and influence in the digital world as it did in the cassette era.\nSony is a major audio products manufacturer and one of the active noise control technology leaders.\nSony's high-end microphones and headphones for professional use are produced at Sony/Taiyo Corporation, a designated special subsidiary at which 67% of employees have a disability, in \u014cita Prefecture, Japan.\nCar audio.\nSony partnered with Chery to provide OEM car audio for vehicles such as the Tiggo 8 and Tiggo 9, Ford to provide OEM audio for their vehicles such as the F-150, Fiesta, Focus, Mondeo and Taurus, Jaecoo with the Jaecoo 7, Omoda with their Omoda 5 and Omoda 9, Toyota with their Avensis and the Celica, Volkswagen with their Golf, Passat and also the Polo. A specialist Sony Xplod audio system was fitted to the Ford GTX1 supercar.\nSony currently produces aftermarket car audio with their Mobile ES series.\nVideo.\nSony produced the TV8-301, the world's first all-transistor television, in 1959. In 1968, the company introduced the Trinitron brand name for its lines of aperture grille cathode-ray tube televisions and afterwards computer monitors. Sony stopped production of Trinitron for most markets, but continued producing sets for markets such as Pakistan, Bangladesh and China. Sony discontinued its series of Trinitron computer monitors in 2005. The company discontinued the last Trinitron-based television set in the U.S. in early 2007. The end of Trinitron marked the end of Sony's analog television sets and monitors.\nSony used the LCD WEGA name for its LCD TVs until summer 2005. The company then introduced the BRAVIA name. BRAVIA is an in-house brand owned by Sony which produces high-definition LCD televisions, projection TVs and front projectors, home cinemas and the BRAVIA home theatre range. All Sony high-definition flat-panel LCD televisions in North America have carried the logo for BRAVIA since 2005. In 2006, Sony lost its decades-long No.1 market share in the global television market. In November 2007, the Sony XEL-1, the first OLED television, was released and manufactured for two years. Later in 2013, Sony demonstrated the first 4K OLED television. As of 2012, Sony was the third-largest maker of televisions in the world and the business unit had been unprofitable for eight consecutive years.\nFrom 2011, Sony started restructuring of its loss-making television business, mainly by downsizing business units and outsourcing the manufacturing of display panels to the companies like Sharp Corporation, LG Display, and Samsung Electronics. In December 2011, Sony agreed to sell all stake in an LCD joint venture with Samsung Electronics (S-LCD) for about $940\u00a0million. On 28 March 2012, Sony and Sharp announced that they have agreed to further amend the joint venture agreement originally executed by the parties in July 2009, as amended in April 2011, for the establishment and operation of Sharp Display Products Corporation (\"SDP\"), a joint venture to produce and sell large-sized LCD panels and modules. The agreement was eventually terminated as Sony parted ways. Sony's small-sized LCD business subsidiary and medium-to-large-sized OLED display business unit were spun off and became part of Japan Display and JOLED, respectively.\nIn 2017, Sony launched OLED televisions under the BRAVIA brand.\nAlso, Sony has sold a range of tapes, discs, recorders and players for videocassette, DVD, and Blu-ray formats for decades.\nPhotography and videography.\nSony offers a wide range of digital cameras. Its point-and-shoot models are branded Cyber-shot, while DSLRs and mirrorless models are branded Alpha, though Sony no longer makes DSLRs. It also produces action cameras and camcorders, with the company's cinema-grade products being sold under the CineAlta name.\nSony demonstrated a prototype of the Sony Mavica in 1981 and released it for the consumer market in 1988. The first Cyber-shot was introduced in 1996. Sony's market share of the digital camera market fell from a high of 20% to 9% by 2005.\nSony entered the market for digital single-lens reflex cameras in 2006 when it acquired the camera business of Konica Minolta. Sony rebranded the company's line of cameras as its Alpha line. Sony is the world's third largest manufacturer of the cameras, behind Canon and Nikon respectively.\nIn 2010, Sony introduced their first mirrorless interchangeable-lens cameras, which were the NEX-3 and the NEX-5. They also started a new lens mount system, which was the E-mount. There were quite a few NEX models out there, when Sony decided to melt the NEX series into the Alpha series. The first Alpha MILC was the \u03b13000, which was introduced in August 2013. It was followed by the Full-Frame \u03b17 and \u03b17R in October, then the successors of the NEX-5, the NEX-6 and NEX-7, the \u03b15000 and the \u03b16000 in 2014. The \u03b16000 became the most popular MILC ever and Sony became the largest MILC manufacturer.\nComputing.\nSony produced computers (SMC-777 personal computer, MSX home computers and NEWS workstations) during the 1980s. The company withdrew from the computer business around 1990. Sony entered again into the global computer market under the new VAIO brand, began in 1996. Short for \"Video Audio Integrated Operation\", the line was the first computer brand to highlight visual-audio features.\nSony faced considerable controversy when some of its laptop batteries exploded and caught fire in 2006, resulting in the largest computer-related recall to that point in history.\nIn a bid to join the tablet computer market, the company launched its Sony Tablet line of Android tablets in 2011. Since 2012, Sony's Android products have been marketed under the Xperia brand used for its smartphones.\nOn 4 February 2014, Sony announced that it would sell its VAIO PC business due to poor sales and Japanese company Japan Industrial Partners (JIP) will purchase the VAIO brand, with the deal finalized by the end of March 2014. As of 2018, Sony maintained a 5% stake in the new, independent company.\nIn the 1990s, Sony was contracted to manufacture laptop computers for Apple and Dell. The Raspberry Pi Foundation delegates the manufacture of its single-board computers to Sony. Most Raspberry Pi computers are made at Sony UK Technology Centre in Pencoed, Wales, UK.\nHealthcare and biotechnology.\nSony has targeted medical, healthcare and biotechnology business as a growth sector in the future. The company acquired iCyt Mission Technology, Inc. (renamed Sony Biotechnology Inc. in 2012), a manufacturer of flow cytometers, in 2010 and Micronics, Inc., a developer of microfluidics-based diagnostic tools, in 2011.\nIn 2012, Sony announced that it would acquire all shares of So-net Entertainment Corporation, the largest shareholder of M3, Inc., an operator of portal sites (m3.com, MR-kun, MDLinx and MEDI:GATE) for healthcare professionals.\nOn 28 September 2012, Olympus and Sony announced that the two companies will establish a joint venture to develop new surgical endoscopes with 4K resolution (or higher) and 3D capability. Sony Olympus Medical Solutions Inc. (Sony 51%, Olympus 49%) was established on 16 April 2013.\nOn 28 February 2014, Sony, M3 and Illumina established a joint venture called P5, Inc. to provide a genome analysis service for research institutions and enterprises in Japan.\nMobility.\nIn 2000, Sony was a marginal player in the mobile phone market with a share of less than 1 percent. In 2001, Sony entered into a joint venture with Swedish telecommunications company Ericsson, forming Sony Ericsson Mobile Communications. Initial sales were rocky, and the company posted losses in 2001 and 2002. However, Sony Ericsson reached a profit in 2003. The company distinguished itself with multimedia-capable mobile phones, which included features such as cameras. These were unusual at the time. Despite their innovations, Sony Ericsson faced intense competition from Apple's iPhone, which was released in 2007. From 2008 to 2010, amid a global recession, Sony Ericsson slashed its workforce by several thousand. In 2009, Sony Ericsson was the fourth-largest mobile phone manufacturer in the world (after Nokia, Samsung and LG). By 2010, its market share had fallen to sixth place. Sony acquired Ericsson's share of the venture in 2012 for over US$1\u00a0billion. Sony Mobile focuses exclusively on the smartphone market under the Xperia brand.\nIn 2013, Sony contributed to around two percent of the mobile phone market with 37\u00a0million mobile phones sold. Sony Mobile's sales reached a peak in 2014 with 40\u00a0million handsets, the volume has since decreased. Sony shipped 13.5\u00a0million phones in 2017, 6.5\u00a0million in 2018, and 2.9\u00a0million handsets in FY 2020.\nRobotics.\nSince the late 1990s, Sony has released numerous consumer robots, including dog-shaped robots called AIBO, a music playing robot called Rolly, and a humanoid robot called QRIO. Despite being a pioneer in the field, Sony had ceased robotics-related operations for 10 years due to financial difficulties, until it decided to revive them in 2016.\nIn 2015, Sony partnered with an autonomous driving startup ZMP INC. to establish an aerial surveillance and reconnaissance drone manufacturer named Aerosense. At the CES 2021, Sony unveiled a drone with the brand Airpeak, the smallest of its kind that can incorporate a Sony Alpha camera according to the company, entering the drone business on its own for the first time.\nIn 2019, as part of the London Design Festival, Sony Design showcased \"Affinity in Autonomy\", a conceptual environmental art installation in the Prince Consort Gallery of the Victoria and Albert Museum that represented the company's vision of the future of AI and Robotics.\nImaging &amp; sensing solutions.\nSony traces its roots in the semiconductor business back to 1954, when it became the first Japanese company to commercialize the transistor, invented and licensed by Bell Labs, whilst some of the biggest and well-established names in Japan at the time like Toshiba and Mitsubishi Electric initially stuck with vacuum tubes they had been thriving on; despite being an expert on the vacuum tube himself, Ibuka saw potential of the novel technology and had Morita negotiate the terms for licensing, making Sony into one of the earliest and the youngest licensees of the transistor, together with Texas Instruments. In 1957, Sony employee Leo Esaki and his colleagues invented a tunnel diode (usually referred to as Esaki diode) by which they discovered the quantum tunneling effect in solids, for which Esaki received the Nobel prize in Physics in 1973. Sony has commanded a dominant share in the charge-coupled device market.\nAs of 2020, Sony is the world's largest manufacturer of CMOS image sensors as its chips are widely used in digital cameras, tablet computers, smartphones, drones and more recently, self-driving systems in automobiles.\nAs of 2020, the company, through its chip business arm Sony Semiconductor Solutions, designs, manufactures, and sells a wide range of semiconductors and electronic components, including image sensors (HAD CCD, Exmor), image processors (BIONZ), laser diodes, system LSIs, mixed-signal LSIs, emerging memory storage, emerging displays (microLED, microOLED, and holographic display), multi-functional microcomputer (\"SPRESENSE\"), etc.\nIn 2020, Sony has launched the first intelligent vision sensors with AI edge computing capabilies.\nGame &amp; network services.\nSony Interactive Entertainment (formerly Sony Computer Entertainment) is most notable for producing PlayStation consoles. The line grew out of a failed partnership with Nintendo. Originally, Nintendo requested Sony to develop an add-on for its Super Nintendo Entertainment System that would play CD-ROMs. In 1991 Sony announced the add-on, as well as a dedicated console known as the \"Play Station\". However, a disagreement over software licensing for the console caused the partnership to fall through. Sony then continued the project independently.\nLaunched in 1994, the first PlayStation gained 61% of global console sales and broke Nintendo's long-standing lead in the market. Sony followed up with the PlayStation 2 in 2000, which was even more successful. The console has become the most successful of all time, selling over 150\u00a0million units as of 2011[ [update]]. Sony released the PlayStation 3, a high-definition console, in 2006. It was the first console to use the Blu-ray format, and was considerably more expensive than the competitors Xbox 360 and Wii due to the Cell processor.\nEarly on, poor sales performance resulted in significant losses for the company, pushing it to sell the console at a loss. The PlayStation 3 sold generally more poorly than its competitors in the early years of its release but managed to overtake the Xbox 360 in global sales later on. It later introduced the PlayStation Move, an accessory that allows players to control video games using motion gestures.\nSony extended the brand to the portable games market in 2004 with the PlayStation Portable (PSP). The console has sold reasonably, but has taken a second place to a rival handheld, the Nintendo DS. Sony developed the Universal Media Disc (UMD) optical disc medium for use on the PlayStation Portable. Early on, the format was used for movies, but it has since lost major studio support. Sony released a disc-less version of its PlayStation Portable, the PSP Go, in 2009. The company went on to release its second portable video game system, PlayStation Vita, in 2011 and 2012. Sony launched its fourth console, the PlayStation 4, on 15 November 2013, which as of 31 December 2017 has sold 73.6\u00a0million units globally.\nOn 18 March 2014, at GDC, president of SCE Worldwide Studios Shuhei Yoshida announced their new virtual reality technology dubbed Project Morpheus, and later named PlayStation VR, for PlayStation 4. The headset brought VR gaming and non-gaming software to the company's console. According to a report released by Houston-based patent consulting firm LexInnova in May 2015, Sony is leading the virtual reality patent race. According to the firm's analysis of nearly 12,000 patents or patent applications, Sony has 366 virtual reality patents or patent applications. PlayStation VR was released worldwide on 13 October 2016.\nOn 31 March 2019, the successor to the PlayStation 4 was announced and on 12 November 2020, the PlayStation 5 was released in North America, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, South Korea, and Singapore. The console was launched in Indonesia on 22 January 2021. Upon completion of the fiscal quarter, Sony sold 4.5 million PlayStation 5 consoles, keeping pace with the best-selling console of all time, the PlayStation 2.\nPictures and music.\nSony Entertainment has two divisions: Sony Pictures Entertainment, Sony Music Group (Sony Music Entertainment, Sony Music Publishing). Sony USA previously owned and operated Sony Trans Com: a technology business that provided in-flight entertainment programming as well as video and audio playback equipment for the airline industry. Sony had purchased the business from Sundstrand Corp. in 1989 and subsequently sold it to Rockwell Collins in 2000.\nIn 2012, Sony rolled most of its consumer content services (including video, music and gaming) into the Sony Entertainment Network, the predecessor of PlayStation Network.\nSony Pictures Entertainment.\nSony Pictures Entertainment Inc. (SPE) is the television and film production/distribution unit of Sony. With 12.5% box office market share in 2011, the company was ranked third among movie studios. Its group sales in 2010 were US$7.2\u00a0billion. The company has produced many notable movie franchises, including \"Spider-Man\", \"The Karate Kid\" and \"Men in Black\". It has also produced the popular television game shows \"Jeopardy!\" and \"Wheel of Fortune\".\nSony entered the television and film production market when it acquired Columbia Pictures Entertainment in 1989 for $3.4\u00a0billion. Columbia lives on in the Sony Pictures Motion Picture Group, a division of SPE which in turn owns Columbia Pictures and TriStar Pictures among other film production and distribution companies such as Screen Gems, Sony Pictures Classics, Sony Pictures Home Entertainment. SPE's television division is known as Sony Pictures Television.\nFor the first several years of its existence, Sony Pictures Entertainment performed poorly, leading many to suspect the company would sell off the division. In 2006, Sony started using ARccOS Protection on some of their film DVDs, but later issued a recall.\nIn late 2014, Sony Pictures became the target of a hack attack from a clandestine group called Guardians of Peace, weeks before releasing the anti-North Korean comedy film \"The Interview\".\nIn February 2024, Sony entered into an agreement with Disney under which Sony Pictures Home Entertainment Corporation of Japan will handle the release of Disney products on DVD and Blu-ray on a licensing model, as well as production on physical media. Sony will market, sell and distribute new Disney releases and catalog films on DVD, Blu-ray and 4K Ultra DVD through Canadian and American retailers and distributors.\nSony Music Group and SMEJ.\nSony Music Entertainment (also known as SME or Sony Music) is the largest global recorded music company of the \"big three\" record companies and is controlled by Sony Corporation of America, the United States subsidiary of Sony.\nIn one of its largest-ever acquisitions, Sony purchased CBS Record Group in 1988 for US$2\u00a0billion. In the process, Sony partnered and gained the rights to the ATV catalogue of Michael Jackson, considered by the \"Guinness Book of World Records\" to be the most successful entertainer of all time. The acquisition of CBS Records provided the foundation for the formation of Sony Music Entertainment, which Sony established in 1991.\nIn 1968, Sony and CBS Records had formed a 50:50 joint-venture CBS/Sony Records, later renamed CBS/Sony Group, in Japan. When CBS Records was acquired, a 50% stake in CBS/Sony Group owned by CBS was also transferred to Sony. In March 1988, four wholly owned subsidiaries were folded into CBS/Sony Group and the company was renamed as Sony Music Entertainment Japan (SMEJ). It operates independently of Sony Music as it is directly owned by Japanese Sony.\nIn 2004, Sony entered into a joint venture with Bertelsmann AG, merging Sony Music Entertainment with Bertelsmann Music Group to create Sony BMG. In 2005, Sony BMG faced a copy protection scandal, because its music CDs had installed malware on users' computers that was posing a security risk to affected customers. In 2007, the company acquired Famous Music for US$370\u00a0million, gaining the rights to the catalogues of Eminem and Akon, among others. Sony bought out Bertelsmann's share in Sony BMG and formed a new Sony Music Entertainment in 2008. Since then, the company has undergone management changes.\nSony purchased digital music recognition company Gracenote for US$260\u00a0million in 2008. Tribune Media Company acquired Gracenote from Sony in 2014 for $170\u00a0million.\nBesides its record label, Sony operates other music businesses. In 1995, Sony merged its publisher with Michael Jackson's ATV Music Publishing, forming Sony/ATV Music Publishing. At the time, the publishing company was the second largest of its kind in the world. The company owns the publishing rights to over 4\u00a0million compositions, including The Beatles' Lennon\u2013McCartney catalogue, Bob Dylan, Eminem, Lady Gaga, Sam Smith, Ed Sheeran, and Taylor Swift.\nIn 2012, Sony/ATV acquired a majority stake in EMI Music Publishing, becoming the world's largest music publishing company. In 2018, Sony bought the rest of the shares in the publisher, making it a wholly owned subsidiary. Since 2016, Sony owns all of Sony/ATV.\nAnime.\nSony's entering into the Japanese animation, or anime, business happened in 1995 when its Sony Music Entertainment Japan (SMEJ) division established Aniplex as its subsidiary managing creative productions, which founded A-1 Pictures, the first anime studio of Sony, ten years later. Since then, through group-wide and international ventures, Sony has solidified its position in the industry, elevating the business to what is called the \"fourth pillar of its entertainment portfolio\" according to \"The Nikkei\".\nThe anime business operations of Sony are scattered around the group, mainly in its Pictures and Music units, as follows: SMEJ's notable related businesses include Aniplex and its subsidiaries CloverWorks and A-1 Pictures; Aniplex and U.S.-headquartered Sony Pictures co-own U.S.-based anime distribution company Crunchyroll, which since 2022, has become the successor company to Funimation, which it acquired in 2017 and included subsidiaries such as Wakanim (absorbing into Crunchyroll itself) and Madman Anime (to be rebranded as Crunchyroll Pty. Ltd.)\nIn December 2020, Funimation announced that it would buy AT&amp;T's animation business Crunchyroll for $1.175 billion, which would help the company to compete more globally with entertainment giants such as Netflix. This acquisition was completed in August 2021.\nFinancial services.\nSony Financial Group is a holding company for Sony's financial services business which includes Sony Life (in Japan and the Philippines), Sony Assurance, Sony Bank, etc. The unit proved to be the most profitable of Sony's businesses in FY 2005, earning $1.7\u00a0billion in profit. Sony Financial's low fees have aided the unit's popularity while threatening Sony's premium brand name.\nOthers.\nElectric vehicles and batteries.\nA company behind the commercialization of lithium-ion battery, Sony had been exploring the possibility to manufacture the batteries for electric vehicles. In 2014, Sony participated within NRG Energy eVgo Ready for Electric Vehicle (REV) program, for EV charging parking lots. However, the company then decided to sell its lithium-ion battery business to Murata Manufacturing in 2016.\nIn 2015, Sony invested $842,000 in ZMP INC., drawing speculations that it is contemplating developing self-driving cars. In January 2020, Sony unveiled a concept electric car at the Consumer Electronics Show, named Vision-S, designed in collaboration with components manufacturer Magna International. At the occasion, Sony also stated its goal of developing technology for the automotive sector, especially concerning autonomous driving, sensors, and in-car entertainment.\nIn 2022, Sony Group and Honda launched a joint venture for their electric vehicle partnership, Sony Honda Mobility (SHM), which would deliver its first electric vehicles by 2026 and sell them online, starting in the United States and Japan. The joint venture announced their new \"Afeela\" brand and its first prototype model at the CES 2023.\nCorporate information.\nInstitutional ownership.\nSony is a \"kabushiki kaisha\" (joint stock company) listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange in Japan with American depositary receipts listed on New York Stock Exchange. As of 2023[ [update]], the largest shareholders of Sony are as follows:\nBusiness trends.\nThe key trends for Sony are (as of the financial year ending March 31):\nAs of January 2024, Sony, one of the largest Japanese companies by market capitalization and operating profit, was valued at over $112\u00a0billion. At the same period, it was also recognized as the most cash-rich Japanese company, with its net cash reserves of \u00a51.8\u00a0trillion.\nThe company was immensely profitable throughout the 1990s and early 2000s in part because of the success of its new PlayStation line. The company encountered financial difficulty in the mid- to late-2000s due to several factors: the Great Recession, increased competition for PlayStation, and the 2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami. The company faced three consecutive years of losses leading up to 2011. While noting the negative effects of intervening circumstances such as natural disasters and fluctuating currency exchange rates, the \"Financial Times\" criticized the company for its \"lack of resilience\" and \"inability to gauge the economy,\" voicing skepticism about Sony's revitalization efforts, given a lack of tangible results.\nIn September 2000 Sony had a market capitalization of $100\u00a0billion; but by December 2011 it had plunged to $18\u00a0billion, reflecting falling prospects for Sony but also reflecting grossly inflated share prices of the 'dot-com bubble' years. Net worth, as measured by stockholder equity, has steadily grown from $17.9\u00a0billion in March 2002 to $35.6\u00a0billion through December 2011. Earnings yield (inverse of the price to earnings ratio) has never been more than 5% and usually much less; thus Sony has always traded in over-priced ranges with the exception of the 2009 market bottom.\nOn 9 December 2008, Sony announced that it would be cutting 8,000 jobs, dropping 8,000 contractors and reducing its global manufacturing sites by 10% to save $1.1\u00a0billion per year.\nIn April 2012, Sony announced that it would reduce its workforce by 10,000 (6% of its employee base) as part of CEO Kaz Hirai's effort to get the company back into the black. This came after a loss of 520\u00a0billion yen (roughly US$6.36\u00a0billion) for fiscal 2012, the worst since the company was founded. Accumulation loss for the past four years was 919.32\u00a0billion-yen. Sony planned to increase its marketing expenses by 30% in 2012. 1,000 of the jobs cut come from the company's mobile phone unit's workforce. 700 jobs will be cut in the 2012\u20132013 fiscal year and the remaining 300 in the following fiscal year. Sony had revenues of \u00a56.493\u00a0trillion in 2012 and maintained large reserves of cash, with \u00a5895\u00a0billion on hand as of 2012. In May 2012, Sony's market capitalization was valued at about $15\u00a0billion.\nIn January 2013, Sony announced it was selling its US headquarters building for $1.1\u00a0billion to a consortium led by real estate developer The Chetrit Group.\nOn 28 January 2014, Moody's Investors Services dropped Sony's credit rating to Ba1\u2014\"judged to have speculative elements and a significant credit risk\"\u2014saying that the company's \"profitability is likely to remain weak and volatile.\"\nOn 6 February 2014, Sony announced it would trim as many as 5,000 jobs as it attempts to sell its PC business and focus on mobile and tablets.\nIn 2014, Sony South Africa closed its TV, Hi-Fi and camera divisions with the purpose of reconsidering its local distribution model and, in 2017, it returned facilitated by Premium Brand Distributors (Pty) Ltd.\nIn November 2018, Sony posted its earning report for the second quarter showing it has lost about US$480 million in the mobile phone division, prompting another round of downsizing in the unit, including the closure of a manufacturing plant and halving of its workforce.\nIn November 2025, Israeli business media outlets, including Globes, reported that the Japanese company Sony plans to cease its telecommunications chip development activities in Israel.\nCriticism &amp; controversies.\nOver the years, Sony has faced a number of allegations and criticism pertaining to their corporate behavior, often leading to legal proceedings and customer dissatisfaction.\nIn August 2000, then Sony Pictures Entertainment U.S. senior vice president Steve Heckler was quoted saying \"The industry will take whatever steps it needs to protect itself and protect its revenue streams ...\". Sony then worked on a DRM system that works like a rootkit in order to enforce its copyright claims upon users of music CDs.\nWith respect to Sony's gaming consoles, subsequent updates are released to the said consoles, many of which strip the user of some of the originally advertised features in order to save the company some licensing fees or protect itself from the modding community. \nOn April 1, 2010, Sony released a patch for the PS3 that would remove OtherOS from being installed onto the system after hackers were looking for ways to exploit OtherOS in order to run homebrew software. Then on January 12, 2011, Sony filled lawsuits against \"geohot\" and \"fail0verflow\" for their efforts on exploiting the PS3.\nIn December 2023, Sony announced that it will remove the Discovery app and its content, even if previously paid for, from its gaming consoles.\nIn November 2025, a collaborative decision was made by Sony Semiconductor Israel and the headquarters of Sony Corporation in Japan, stating that Sony Israel will detach from Sony Corporation and will recommence its operations as an independent entity under its original name, Altair Semiconductor.\nEnvironmental record.\nIn November 2011, Sony was ranked ninth (jointly with Panasonic) in Greenpeace's Guide to Greener Electronics. This chart grades major electronics companies on their environmental work. The company scored 3.6/10, incurring a penalty point for comments it has made in opposition to energy efficiency standards in California. It also risks a further penalty point in future editions for being a member of trade associations that have commented against energy efficiency standards. Together with Philips, Sony receives the highest score for energy policy advocacy after calling on the EU to adopt an unconditional 30% reduction target for greenhouse gas emissions by 2020. Meanwhile, it receives full marks for the efficiency of its products. In June 2007, Sony ranked 14th on the Greenpeace guide. Sony fell from its earlier 11th-place ranking due to Greenpeace's claims that Sony had double standards in their waste policies.\nAs of \u00a02018[ [update]] Greenpeace's 2017 Guide to Greener Electronics rated Sony approximately in the middle among electronics manufacturers with a grade of D+.\nSince 1976, Sony has had an Environmental Conference. Sony's policies address their effects on global warming, the environment, and resources. They are taking steps to reduce the amount of greenhouse gases that they put out as well as regulating the products they get from their suppliers in a process that they call \"green procurement\". Sony has said that they have signed on to have about 75 percent of their Sony Building running on geothermal power. The \"Sony Take Back Recycling Program\" allow consumers to recycle the electronics products that they buy from Sony by taking them to eCycle (Recycling) drop-off points around the U.S. The company has also developed a biobattery that runs on sugars and carbohydrates that works similarly to the way living creatures work. This is the most powerful small biobattery to date.\nIn 2000, Sony faced criticism for a document entitled \"NGO Strategy\" that was leaked to the press. The document involved the company's surveillance of environmental activists in an attempt to plan how to counter their movements. It specifically mentioned environmental groups that were trying to pass laws that held electronics-producing companies responsible for the cleanup of the toxic chemicals contained in their merchandise.\nCartel.\nIn 2007 an investigation launched in 2002 by the European Commission culminated in Sony, Fuji and Maxell receiving a total of 110 million US dollar fine for fixing professional videotape prices between 1999 and 2002 through regular meetings and other illegal contracts; at the time the three corporations shared a combined 85% control of the market. Sony's part of the fine was raised by a third for trying to obstruct the investigation by refusing to answer inquiries made by the EU officials and shredding of evidence during the multiple law-enforcement raids. During the year 2001 prior to the investigation Sony sold professional videotapes for a total of \u20ac115 million inside the EU.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Although studying many of the same substantive topics as its counterpart in the field of sociology, psychological social psychology places more emphasis on the individual, rather than society; the influence of social structure and culture on individual outcomes, such as personality, behavior, and one's position in social hierarchies. Social psychologists typically explain human behavior as a result of the relationship between mental states and social situations, studying the social conditions under which thoughts, feelings, and behaviors occur, and how these variables influence social interactions.\nHistory.\n19th century.\nIn the 19th century, social psychology began to emerge from the larger field of psychology. At the time, many psychologists were concerned with developing concrete explanations for the different aspects of human nature. They attempted to discover concrete cause-and-effect relationships that explained social interactions. In order to do so, they applied the scientific method to human behavior. One of the first published studies in the field was Norman Triplett's 1898 experiment on the phenomenon of social facilitation. These psychological experiments later went on to form the foundation of much of 20th century social psychological findings.\n20th century.\nAccording to Wolfgang Stroebe, modern social psychology began in 1924 with the publication of a classic textbook by Floyd Allport, which defined the field as the experimental study of social behavior.\nAn early, influential research program in social psychology was established by Kurt Lewin and his students. During World War II, social psychologists were mostly concerned with studies of persuasion and propaganda for the U.S. military (see also psychological warfare). Following the war, researchers became interested in a variety of social problems, including issues of gender and racial prejudice. Social stigma, which refers to the disapproval or discrimination against individuals based on perceived differences, became increasingly prevalent as societies sought to redefine norms and group boundaries after the war.\nDuring the years immediately following World War II, there were frequent collaborations between psychologists and sociologists. The two disciplines, however, have become increasingly specialized and isolated from each other in recent years, with sociologists generally focusing on high-level, large-scale examinations of society, and psychologists generally focusing on more small-scale studies of individual human behaviors.\nDuring the 1960s, there was growing interest in topics such as cognitive dissonance, bystander intervention, and aggression. These developments were part of a trend of increasingly sophisticated laboratory experiments using college students as participants and analysis of variance designs.\nIn the 1970s, a number of conceptual challenges to social psychology emerged over issues such as ethical concerns about laboratory experimentation, whether attitudes could accurately predict behavior, and to what extent science could be done in a cultural context. It was also in this period where situationism, the theory that human behavior changes based on situational factors, emerged and challenged the relevance of self and personality in psychology.\nBy the 1980s and 1990s, social psychology had developed a number of solutions to these issues with regard to theory and methodology.\n21st century.\nAt present, ethical standards regulate research, and pluralistic and multicultural perspectives to the social sciences have emerged. Most modern researchers in the 21st century are interested in phenomena such as attribution, social cognition, and self-concept. During the COVID-19 pandemic, social psychologists examined the effects of social isolation, fear, and misinformation on collective behavior. Research also focused on how pandemic-related stress affected mental health and social cohesion. Social psychologists are, in addition, concerned with applied psychology, contributing towards applications of social psychology in health, education, law, and the workplace.\nCore theories and concepts.\nAttitudes.\nIn social psychology, an attitude is a learned, global evaluation that influences thought and action. Attitudes are basic expressions of approval and disapproval or likes and dislikes. For example, enjoying chocolate ice cream or endorsing the values of a particular political party are examples of attitudes. Because people are influenced by multiple factors in any given situation, general attitudes are not always good predictors of specific behavior. For example, a person may generally value the environment but may not recycle a plastic bottle because of specific factors on a given day.\nOne of the most influential 20th century attitude theories was Cognitive dissonance theory. According to this theory, attitudes must be logically consistent with each other. Noticing incongruence among one's attitudes leads to an uncomfortable state of tension, which may motivate a change in attitudes or behavior.\nResearch on attitudes has examined the distinction between traditional, self-reported attitudes and implicit, unconscious attitudes. Experiments using the Implicit Association Test (IAT), for instance, have found that people often demonstrate implicit bias against other races, even when their explicit responses profess impartiality. Likewise, one study found that in interracial interactions, explicit attitudes correlate with verbal behavior, while implicit attitudes correlate with nonverbal behavior.\nAttitudes are also involved in several other areas of the discipline, such as conformity, interpersonal attraction, social perception, and prejudice.\nPersuasion.\nPersuasion is an active method of influencing that attempts to guide people toward the adoption of an attitude, idea, or behavior by rational or emotive means. Persuasion relies on appeals rather than strong pressure or coercion. The process of persuasion has been found to be influenced by numerous variables that generally fall into one of five major categories:\nDual-process theories of persuasion (such as the elaboration likelihood model) maintain that persuasion is mediated by two separate routes: central and peripheral. The central route of persuasion is influenced by facts and results in longer-lasting change, but requires motivation to process. The peripheral route is influenced by superficial factors (e.g. smiling, clothing) and results in shorter-lasting change, but does not require as much motivation to process.\nSocial cognition.\nSocial cognition studies how people perceive, recognize, and remember information about others. Much research rests on the assertion that people think about other people differently than they do non-social, or non-human, targets. This assertion is supported by the social-cognitive deficits exhibited by people with Williams syndrome and autism.\nAttribution.\nA major research topic in social cognition is attribution. Attributions are explanations of behavior, either one's own behavior or the behavior of others.\nOne element of attribution ascribes the cause of behavior to internal and external factors. An internal, or dispositional, attribution reasons that a behavior is caused by inner traits such as personality, disposition, character, and ability. An external, or situational, attribution reasons that a behavior is caused by situational elements such as the weather.A second element of attribution ascribes the cause of behavior to stable and unstable factors (i.e., whether the behavior will be repeated or changed under similar circumstances). Individuals also attribute causes of behavior to controllable and uncontrollable factors (i.e., how much control one has over the situation at hand).\nNumerous biases in the attribution process have been discovered. For instance, the fundamental attribution error is the bias towards making dispositional attributions for other people's behavior.The actor-observer bias is an extension of the theory, positing that tendency exists to make dispositional attributions for other people's behavior and situational attributions for one's own. The self-serving bias is the tendency to attribute dispositional causes for successes, and situational causes for failure, particularly when self-esteem is threatened. This leads to assuming one's successes are from innate traits, and one's failures are due to situations.\nHeuristics.\nHeuristics are cognitive shortcuts which are used to make decisions in lieu of conscious reasoning. The availability heuristic occurs when people estimate the probability of an outcome based on how easy that outcome is to imagine. As such, vivid or highly memorable possibilities will be perceived as more likely than those that are harder to picture or difficult to understand. The representativeness heuristic is a shortcut people use to categorize something based on how similar it is to a prototype they know of. Several other biases have been found by social cognition researchers. The hindsight bias is a false memory of having predicted events, or an exaggeration of actual predictions, after becoming aware of the outcome. The confirmation bias is a type of bias leading to the tendency to search for or interpret information in a way that confirms one's preconceptions.\nSchemas.\nSchemas are generalized mental representations that organize knowledge and guide information processing. They organize social information and experiences. Schemas often operate automatically and unconsciously. This leads to biases in perception and memory. Schemas may induce expectations that lead us to see something that is not there. One experiment found that people are more likely to misperceive a weapon in the hands of a black man than a white man. This type of schema is a stereotype, a generalized set of beliefs about a particular group of people (when incorrect, an ultimate attribution error). Stereotypes are often related to negative or preferential attitudes and behavior. Schemas for behaviors (e.g., going to a restaurant, doing laundry) are known as \"scripts\".\nSelf-concept.\nSelf-concept is the whole sum of beliefs that people have about themselves. The self-concept is made up of cognitive aspects called self-schemas\u2014beliefs that people have about themselves and that guide the processing of self-referential information. For example, an athlete at a university would have multiple selves that would process different information pertinent to each self: the student would be oneself, who would process information pertinent to a student (taking notes in class, completing a homework assignment, etc.); the athlete would be the self who processes information about things related to being an athlete. These selves are part of one's identity and the self-referential information is that which relies on the appropriate self to process and react to it.\nThere are many theories on the perception of our own behavior. Leon Festinger's 1954 \"social comparison theory\" posits that people evaluate their own abilities and opinions by comparing themselves to others when they are uncertain of their own ability or opinions. Daryl Bem's 1972 \"self-perception theory\" claims that when internal cues are difficult to interpret, people gain self-insight by observing their own behavior.\nSocial influence.\nSocial influence is an overarching term that denotes the persuasive effects people have on each other. It is seen as a fundamental concept in social psychology. The study of it overlaps considerably with research on attitudes and persuasion. The three main areas of social influence include conformity, compliance, and obedience. Social influence is also closely related to the study of group dynamics, as most effects of influence are strongest when they take place in social groups.\nThe first major area of social influence is conformity. Conformity is defined as the tendency to act or think like other members of a group. The identity of members within a group (i.e., status), similarity, expertise, as well as cohesion, prior commitment, and accountability to the group help to determine the level of conformity of an individual. Conformity is often driven by two types of social influences: informational social influence, which involves conforming to gain accurate information, and normative social influence, which involves conforming to be accepted or liked by the group. Individual variations among group members play a key role in the dynamic of how willing people will be to conform. Conformity is usually viewed as a negative tendency in American culture, but a certain amount of conformity is adaptive in some situations, as is nonconformity in other situations.\nThe second major area of social influence research is compliance, which refers to any change in behavior that is due to a request or suggestion from another person. Two common compliance strategies are 'foot-in-the-door,' which involves getting a person to agree to a small request to increase the likelihood of agreeing to a larger one, and 'door-in-the-face,' which involves making a large request that is likely to be refused to make a subsequent smaller request more likely to be accepted. The foot-in-the-door technique is a compliance method in which the persuader requests a small favor and then follows up with a larger favor (e.g., asking for the time and then asking for ten dollars). A related trick is the bait and switch, which is a disingenuous sales strategy that involves enticing potential customers with advertisements of low-priced items which turn out to be unavailable in order to sell a more expensive item.\nThe third major form of social influence is obedience; this is a change in behavior that is the result of a direct order or command from another person. Obedience as a form of compliance was dramatically highlighted by the Milgram study, wherein people were ready to administer shocks to a person in distress on a researcher's command.\nAn unusual kind of social influence is the self-fulfilling prophecy. This is a prediction that, by being made, causes itself to become true. For example, in the financial field, if it is widely believed that a crash is imminent, investors may lose confidence, sell most of their stock, and thus cause a crash. Similarly, people may expect hostility in others and induce this hostility by their own behavior.\nPsychologists have spent decades studying the power of social influence, and the way in which it manipulates people's opinions and behavior. Specifically, social influence refers to the way in which individuals change their ideas and actions to meet the demands of a social group, received authority, social role, or a minority within a group wielding influence over the majority.\nGroup dynamics.\nSocial psychologists study group-related phenomena such as the behavior of crowds. A group can be defined as two or more individuals who are connected to each other by social relationships. Groups tend to interact, influence each other, and share a common identity. They have a number of emergent qualities that distinguish them from coincidental, temporary gatherings, which are termed social aggregates:\nThe shared social identity of individuals within a group influences intergroup behavior, which denotes the way in which groups behave towards and perceive each other. These perceptions and behaviors in turn define the social identity of individuals within the interacting groups.\nThe tendency to define oneself by membership in a group may lead to intergroup discrimination, which involves favorable perceptions and behaviors directed towards the in-group, but negative perceptions and behaviors directed towards the out-group.\nGroups often moderate and improve decision making, and are frequently relied upon for these benefits, such as in committees and juries. Groups also affect performance and productivity. Social facilitation, for example, is a tendency to work harder and faster in the presence of others.\nAnother important concept in this area is deindividuation, a reduced state of self-awareness that can be caused by feelings of anonymity. Deindividuation is associated with uninhibited and sometimes dangerous behavior. It is common in crowds and mobs, but it can also be caused by a disguise, a uniform, alcohol, dark environments, or online anonymity.\nInterpersonal attraction.\nA major area of study of people's relations to each other is interpersonal attraction, which refers to all factors that lead people to like each other, establish relationships, and in some cases fall in love. Several general principles of attraction have been discovered by social psychologists. One of the most important factors in interpersonal attraction is how similar two particular people are. The more similar two people are in general attitudes, backgrounds, environments, worldviews, and other traits, the more likely they will be attracted to each other.\nPhysical attractiveness is an important element of romantic relationships, particularly in the early stages characterized by high levels of passion. Later on, similarity and other compatibility factors become more important, and the type of love people experience shifts from passionate to companionate. In 1986, Robert Sternberg suggested that there are actually three components of love: intimacy, passion, and commitment. When two (or more) people experience all three, they are said to be in a state of consummate love.\nAccording to social exchange theory, relationships are based on rational choice and cost-benefit analysis. A person may leave a relationship if their partner's \"costs\" begin to outweigh their benefits, especially if there are good alternatives available. This theory is similar to the minimax principle proposed by mathematicians and economists. With time, long-term relationships tend to become communal rather than simply based on exchange.\nResearch.\nMethods.\nSocial psychology is an empirical science that attempts to answer questions about human behavior by testing hypotheses. Careful attention to research design, sampling, and statistical analysis is important in social psychology.\nWhenever possible, social psychologists rely on controlled experimentation, which requires the manipulation of one or more independent variables in order to examine the effect on a dependent variable. Experiments are useful in social psychology because they are high in internal validity, meaning that they are free from the influence of confounding or extraneous variables, and so are more likely to accurately indicate a causal relationship. However, the small samples used in controlled experiments are typically low in external validity, or the degree to which the results can be generalized to the larger population. There is usually a trade-off between experimental control (internal validity) and being able to generalize to the population (external validity).\nBecause it is usually impossible to test everyone, research tends to be conducted on a sample of persons from the wider population. Social psychologists frequently use survey research when they are interested in results that are high in external validity. Surveys use various forms of random sampling to obtain a sample of respondents that is representative of a population. This type of research is usually descriptive or correlational because there is no experimental control over variables. Some psychologists have raised concerns for social psychological research relying too heavily on studies conducted on university undergraduates in academic settings, or participants from crowdsourcing labor markets such as Amazon Mechanical Turk. In a 1986 study by David O. Sears, over 70% of experiments used North American undergraduates as subjects, a subset of the population that is unrepresentative of the population as a whole.\nRegardless of which method has been chosen, social psychologists statistically review the significance of their results before accepting them in evaluating an underlying hypothesis. Statistics and probability testing define what constitutes a significant finding, which can be as low as 5% or less, and is unlikely due to chance. Replication testing is also important in ensuring that the results are valid and not due to chance. False positive conclusions, often resulting from the pressure to publish or the author's own confirmation bias, are a hazard in the field.\nFamous experiments.\nAsch conformity experiments.\nThe Asch conformity experiments used a line-length estimation task to demonstrate the power of people's impulses to conform with other members in a small group. The task was designed to be easy to assess but wrong answers were deliberately given by at least some, oftentimes most, of the other participants. In well over a third of the trials, participants conformed to the majority, even though the majority judgment was clearly wrong. Seventy-five percent of the participants conformed at least once during the experiment. Additional manipulations of the experiment showed that participant conformity decreased when at least one other individual failed to conform but increased when the individual began conforming or withdrew from the experiment. Also, participant conformity increased substantially as the number of \"incorrect\" individuals increased from one to three, and remained high as the incorrect majority grew. Participants with three other, incorrect participants made mistakes 31.8% of the time, while those with one or two incorrect participants made mistakes only 3.6% and 13.6% of the time, respectively.\nFestinger cognitive dissonance experiments.\nIn Leon Festinger's cognitive dissonance experiment, participants were divided into two groups and were asked to perform a boring task. Both groups were later asked to dishonestly give their opinion of the task, but were rewarded according to two different pay scales. At the end of the study, some participants were paid $1 to say that they enjoyed the task, while the group of participants were paid $20 to tell the same lie. The first group ($1) later reported liking the task better than the second group ($20). Festinger's explanation was that for people in the first group, being paid only $1 was not sufficient incentive. This led them to experience dissonance, or discomfort and internal conflict. They could only overcome that dissonance by justifying their lies. They did this by changing their previously unfavorable attitudes about the task. Being paid $20 provided a reason for doing the boring task, which resulted in no dissonance.\nMilgram experiment.\nThe Milgram experiment was designed to study how far people would go in obeying an authority figure. The experiment showed that normal American citizens would follow orders even when they believed they were causing an innocent person to suffer or even apparently die.\nStanford prison experiment.\nPhilip Zimbardo's Stanford prison study, a simulated exercise involving students playing at being prison guards and inmates, attempted to show how far people would go in role playing. In just a few days, the guards became brutal and cruel, and the prisoners became miserable and compliant. This was initially argued to be an important demonstration of the power of the immediate social situation and its capacity to overwhelm normal personality traits. Subsequent research has contested the initial conclusions of the study. For example, it has been pointed out that participant self-selection may have affected the participants' behavior, and that the participants' personalities influenced their reactions in a variety of ways, including how long they chose to remain in the study. The 2002 BBC prison study, designed to replicate the conditions in the Stanford study, produced conclusions that were drastically different from the initial findings.\nBandura's Bobo doll.\nAlbert Bandura's Bobo doll experiment attempted to demonstrate how aggression is learned by imitation. In the experiment, 72 children, grouped based on similar levels of pre-tested aggressivity, either witnessed an aggressive or a non-aggressive actor interact with a \"bobo doll.\" The children were then placed alone in the room with the doll and observed to see if they would imitate the same behavior of the actor they had observed. As hypothesized, the children who had witnessed the aggressive actor, imitated the behavior and proceeded to act aggressively towards the doll. Both male and female children who witnessed the non-aggressive actor behaved less aggressively towards the doll. However, boys were more likely to exhibit aggression, especially after observing the behavior from an actor of the same gender. In addition, boys were found to imitate more physical aggression, while girls displayed more verbal aggression.\nEthics.\nThe goal of social psychology is to understand cognition and behavior as they naturally occur in a social context, but the very act of observing people can influence and alter their behavior. For this reason, many social psychology experiments utilize deception to conceal or distort certain aspects of the study. Deception may include false cover stories, false participants (known as confederates or stooges), false feedback given to the participants, and other techniques that help remove potential obstacles to participation.\nThe practice of deception has been challenged by psychologists who maintain that deception under any circumstances is unethical and that other research strategies (e.g., role-playing) should be used instead. Research has shown that role-playing studies do not produce the same results as deception studies, and this has cast doubt on their validity. In addition to deception, experimenters have at times put people in potentially uncomfortable or embarrassing situations (e.g., the Milgram experiment and Stanford prison experiment), and this has also been criticized for ethical reasons.\nVirtually all social psychology research in the modern day must pass an ethical review. At most colleges and universities, this is conducted by an ethics committee or institutional review board, which examines the proposed research to make sure that no harm is likely to come to the participants, and that the study's benefits outweigh any possible risks or discomforts to people participating.\nFurthermore, a process of informed consent is often used to make sure that volunteers know what will be asked of them in the experiment and understand that they are allowed to quit the experiment at any time. A debriefing is typically done at the experiment's conclusion in order to reveal any deceptions used and generally make sure that the participants are unharmed by the procedures. Today, most research in social psychology involves minimal risk, or no greater risk of harm than can be expected from normal daily activities or routine psychological testing.\nReplication crisis.\nMany social psychological research findings have proven difficult to replicate, leading some to argue that social psychology is undergoing a replication crisis. A 2014 special edition of \"Social Psychology\" focused on replication studies, finding that a number of previously held social psychological beliefs were difficult to replicate. Likewise, a 2012 special edition of \"Perspectives on Psychological Science\" focused on issues ranging from publication bias to null-aversion which have contributed to the replication crisis.\nSome factors have been identified in social psychological research as contributing to the crisis. For one, questionable research practices have been identified as common. Such practices, while not necessarily intentionally fraudulent, often involve converting undesired statistical outcomes into desired outcomes via the manipulation of statistical analyses, sample sizes, or data management systems, typically to convert non-significant findings into significant ones. Some studies have suggested that at least mild versions of these practices are prevalent.\nSome social psychologists have also published fraudulent research that has entered into mainstream academia, most notably the admitted data fabrication by Diederik Stapel as well as allegations against others. Fraudulent research is not the main contributor to the replication crisis. Many researchers attribute the failure to replicate as a result of the difficulty of being able to recreate the exact same conditions of a study conducted many years before, as the environment and people have changed.\nEven before the current replication crisis, several effects in social psychology have also been found to be difficult to replicate. For example, the scientific journal \"Judgment and Decision Making\" has published several studies over the years that fail to provide support for the unconscious thought theory.\nReplication failures are not unique to social psychology and are found in many fields of science. One of the consequences of the current crisis is that some areas of social psychology once considered solid, such as social priming, have come under increased scrutiny due to failure to replicate findings.\nThe \"WEIRD\" Problem.\nThe \"WEIRD problem\" highlights the disproportionate representation of participants from Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic (WEIRD) societies in psychological research. This issue has significant implications for how findings are generalized to all human populations. The heavy reliance on WEIRD samples may result in unrepresentative data, making it difficult to draw accurate conclusions about human behavior that apply to people from all cultural backgrounds.\nResearchers have found that relying predominantly on WEIRD samples limits our ability to understand global human behaviors accurately. Cross-cultural variations are often ignored, leading to the misconception that findings from WEIRD populations can be universally applied. This is problematic because WEIRD populations are not representative of the broader diversity of human experiences, which affects our understanding of basic psychological processes such as perception, cognition, and well-being.\nRecognizing cultural diversity is essential not only for gaining multiple perspectives in problem-solving but also for ensuring that everyone feels included and represented in the study of psychology. Understanding different cultures enriches our knowledge of human nature and challenges existing biases, ultimately leading to a more comprehensive and inclusive body of psychological research. Thus, the WEIRD problem represents both a challenge and an opportunity: a need to broaden the scope of research to better reflect the true diversity of humanity.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The Ottoman Empire under him ruled over at least 25\u00a0million people.\nAfter succeeding his father Selim I on 30 September 1520, Suleiman began his reign by launching military campaigns against the Christian powers of Central and Eastern Europe and the Mediterranean; Belgrade fell to him in 1521 and Rhodes in 1522\u20131523, and at Moh\u00e1cs in 1526, Suleiman broke the strength of the Kingdom of Hungary. Hungary was subsequently divided, with much of it incorporated directly into the empire. However, his defeat at the siege of Vienna in 1529 prevented him from advancing further into Europe.\nRuling over the Ottoman Empire at the height of its economic, military, and political power, Suleiman rose to become a prominent monarch of the 16th century, personally leading Ottoman armies in their campaigns against a number of European Christian strongholds. He also fought for years against the Shia Muslim Safavid Empire of Persia, and annexed Mesopotamia. In North Africa, Ottoman Tripolitania was established and the Ottoman fleet dominated the seas from the Mediterranean to the Red Sea and into the Persian Gulf.\nLeading the rapidly expanding Ottoman Empire, Suleiman personally instituted major judicial changes pertaining to society, education, taxation, and criminal law. His reforms, carried out in conjunction with the Ottoman chief judicial official Ebussuud Efendi, brought together the two forms of Ottoman law: sultanic (Kanun) and Islamic (Sharia). He was also a distinguished poet and goldsmith; and a great patron of fine culture, overseeing the \"Golden Age\" of the Ottoman Empire which was at the height of its artistic, literary, and architectural development.\nIn 1533, Suleiman broke with Ottoman tradition by marrying Roxelana, a woman from his Imperial Harem. Roxelana, so named in Western Europe for her red hair, was a Ruthenian who converted to Sunni Islam from Eastern Orthodox Christianity. She became one of the most influential figures of the \"Sultanate of Women\" period in Ottoman history. Upon Suleiman's death in 1566, which ended his 46-year-long reign, he was succeeded by his and Roxelana's son Selim II. Suleiman's other potential heirs, Mehmed and Mustafa, had died; Mehmed had succumbed to smallpox in 1543, while Mustafa had been executed via strangling on Suleiman's orders in 1553. His other son Bayezid was also executed on his orders, along with Bayezid's four sons, after a rebellion in 1561. The death of Suleiman marks a watershed moment in Ottoman history, although scholars typically regard the period after his death to be one of crisis and adaptation rather than of simple decline. In the following decades, the Ottoman Empire began to experience significant political, institutional, and economic changes, a period often referred to as the Era of Transformation.\nAlternative names and titles.\nSuleiman the Magnificent ( ), as he was known in the West, was also called Suleiman the First ( ), and Suleiman the Lawgiver ( ) for his reform of the Ottoman legal system.\nIt is unclear when exactly the term (the Lawgiver) first came to be used as an epithet for Suleiman. It is entirely absent from sixteenth and seventeenth-century Ottoman sources and may date from the early 18th century.\nThere is a tradition of Western origin, according to which Suleiman the Magnificent was \"Suleiman II\", but that tradition has been based on an erroneous assumption that S\u00fcleyman \u00c7elebi was to be recognised as a legitimate sultan.\nEarly life.\nSuleiman was born in Trabzon on the southern coast of the Black Sea to \u015eehzade Selim (later Selim I), probably on 6 November 1494, although this date is not known with absolute certainty or evidence. His mother was Hafsa Sultan, a concubine convert to Islam of unknown origins, who died in 1534. At the age of seven, Suleiman began studies of science, history, literature, theology and military tactics in the schools of the imperial Topkap\u0131 Palace in Constantinople. As a young man, he befriended Pargal\u0131 Ibrahim, a Greek slave who later became one of his most trusted advisers (but who was later executed on Suleiman's orders). At age seventeen, he was appointed as the governor of first Kaffa (Theodosia), then Manisa, with a brief tenure at Edirne.\nAccession.\nUpon the death of his father, Selim I (r. 1512\u20131520), Suleiman entered Constantinople and ascended to the throne as the tenth Ottoman sultan. An early description of Suleiman, a few weeks following his accession, was provided by the Venetian envoy Bartolomeo Contarini: \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nMilitary campaigns.\nConquests in Europe.\nUpon succeeding his father, Suleiman began a series of military conquests, eventually leading to a revolt led by the Ottoman-appointed governor of Damascus in 1521. Suleiman soon made preparations for the conquest of Belgrade from the Kingdom of Hungary\u2014something his great-grandfather Mehmed II had failed to achieve because of John Hunyadi's strong defense in the region. Its capture was vital in removing the Hungarians and Croats who, following the defeats of the Albanians, Bosniaks, Bulgarians, Byzantines and the Serbs, remained the only formidable force who could block further Ottoman gains in Europe. Suleiman encircled Belgrade on 28 August 1521, with 250,000 Turkish soldiers and over 100 ships. and began a series of heavy bombardments from an island in the Danube. Belgrade was made the seat of the Pashalik of Belgrade (also known as the Sanjak of Smederevo), and quickly became the second largest Ottoman town in Europe at over 100,000 people, surpassed only by Constantinople.\nThe road to Hungary and Austria lay open, but Suleiman turned his attention instead to the Eastern Mediterranean island of Rhodes, the home base of the Knights Hospitaller. Suleiman built a large fortification, Marmaris Castle, that served as a base for the Ottoman Navy. Following a five-month siege, Rhodes capitulated and Suleiman allowed the Knights of Rhodes to depart. The conquest of the island cost the Ottomans 50,000 to 60,000 dead from battle and sickness (Christian claims went as high as 64,000 Ottoman battle deaths and 50,000 disease deaths).\nAs relations between Hungary and the Ottoman Empire deteriorated, Suleiman resumed his campaign in Central Europe, and on 29 August 1526 he defeated Louis II of Hungary (1506\u20131526) at the Battle of Moh\u00e1cs. The Hungarian army, encouraged by the nobility to engage prematurely, launched a frontal assault that collapsed under coordinated Ottoman counterattacks. King Louis and much of the Hungarian aristocracy were killed, resulting in the destruction of the royal army and the end of the Jagiellonian dynasty in Hungary and Bohemia. The aftermath saw the partition of Hungary between the Ottoman Empire, the Habsburg monarchy, and the Principality of Transylvania. The battle marked the beginning of sustained Ottoman\u2013Habsburg wars and the decline of Hungary as an independent power. Upon encountering the lifeless body of King Louis, Suleiman is said to have lamented: \"I came indeed in arms against him; but it was not my wish that he should be thus cut off before he scarcely tasted the sweets of life and royalty.\" While Suleiman was campaigning in Hungary, Turkmen tribes in central Anatolia (in Cilicia) revolted under the leadership of Kalender \u00c7elebi.\nSome Hungarian nobles proposed that Ferdinand, who was the ruler of neighboring Austria and tied to Louis II's family by marriage, be King of Hungary, citing previous agreements that the Habsburgs would take the Hungarian throne if Louis died without heirs. However, other nobles turned to the nobleman John Z\u00e1polya, whom Suleiman supported. Under Charles V and his brother Ferdinand I, the Habsburgs reoccupied Buda and took possession of Hungary. Reacting in 1529, Suleiman marched through the valley of the Danube and regained control of Buda; in the following autumn, his forces laid siege to Vienna. This was to be the Ottoman Empire's most ambitious expedition and the apogee of its drive to the West. With a reinforced garrison of 16,000\u00a0men, the Austrians inflicted the first defeat on Suleiman, sowing the seeds of a bitter Ottoman\u2013Habsburg rivalry that lasted until the 20th century. His second attempt to conquer Vienna failed in 1532, as Ottoman forces were delayed by the siege of G\u00fcns and failed to reach Vienna. In both cases, the Ottoman army was plagued by bad weather, forcing them to leave behind essential siege equipment, and was hobbled by overstretched supply lines. In 1533 the Treaty of Constantinople was signed by Ferdinand I, in which he acknowledged Ottoman suzerainty and recognised Suleiman as his \"father and suzerain\", he also agreed to pay an annual tribute and accepted the Ottoman grand vizier as his brother and equal in rank.\nBy the 1540s, a renewal of the conflict in Hungary presented Suleiman with the opportunity to avenge the defeat suffered at Vienna. In 1541, the Habsburgs attempted to lay siege to Buda but were repulsed, and more Habsburg fortresses were captured by the Ottomans in two consecutive campaigns in 1541 and 1544 as a result, In 1542, after Ferdinand's repeated sieges of Buda and Pest, \u00a0Suleiman went to Edirne on 17 November 1542 to prepare for a new campaign and stayed there for a while. On 23 April 1543, he set out on another campaign against Hungary. On 8 August, after a two-week siege, Esztergom was captured by the Ottoman Empire. Within a few weeks, the cities of Sikl\u00f3s, Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r and Szeged were also taken. Ferdinand and Charles were forced to conclude a humiliating five-year treaty with Suleiman. Ferdinand renounced his claim to the Kingdom of Hungary and was forced to pay a fixed yearly sum to the Sultan for the Hungarian lands he continued to control. Of more symbolic importance, the treaty referred to Charles V not as \"Emperor\" but as the \"King of Spain\", leading Suleiman to identify as the true \"Caesar\". In 1552, Suleiman's forces laid siege to Eger, located in the northern part of the Kingdom of Hungary, but the defenders led by Istv\u00e1n Dob\u00f3 repelled the attacks and defended the Eger Castle.\nSuleiman, set out on his 13th expedition, Siege of Szigetv\u00e1r on 1 May 1566, at the age of 72, after an absence of approximately 13 years. The Ottoman army, which arrived in Belgrade on 27 June and was joined by Sigismund Zapolya's forces, arrived in Szigetv\u00e1r on 2 August. Suleiman arrived at the siege on 5 August and settled in his tent on a hill from which the siege could be seen. On 6 September, Suleiman died in his tent, one day before the fall of Szigetv\u00e1r. His death was kept secret with great effort, with only the Sultan's innermost circle knowing of his demise. This was because the Ottomans feared that their soldiers would give up the battle if they knew that their leader had died, so his death was kept secret for 48 days. A courier was dispatched from the camp with a message for Suleiman's successor, Selim II.\nOttoman\u2013Safavid War.\nSuleiman's father had made war with Persia a high priority. At first, Suleiman shifted attention to Europe and was content to contain Persia, which was preoccupied by its own enemies to its east. After Suleiman stabilized his European frontiers, he now turned his attention to Persia, the base for the rival Shia Muslim faction. The Safavid dynasty became the main enemy after two episodes. First, Shah Tahmasp killed the Baghdad governor loyal to Suleiman, and put his own man in. Second, the governor of Bitlis had defected and sworn allegiance to the Safavids. As a result, in 1533, Suleiman ordered his Pargal\u0131 Ibrahim Pasha to lead an army into eastern Asia Minor where he retook Bitlis and occupied Tabriz without resistance. Suleiman joined Ibrahim in 1534. They made a push towards Persia, only to find the Shah sacrificing territory instead of facing a pitched battle, resorting to harassment of the Ottoman army as it proceeded along the harsh interior. In 1535 Suleiman made a grand entrance into Baghdad. He enhanced his local support by restoring the tomb of Abu Hanifa, the founder of the Hanafi school of Islamic law to which the Ottomans adhered.\nAttempting to defeat the Shah once and for all, Suleiman embarked upon a second campaign in 1548\u20131549. As in the previous attempt, Tahmasp avoided confrontation with the Ottoman army and instead chose to retreat, using scorched earth tactics in the process and exposing the Ottoman army to the harsh winter of the Caucasus. Suleiman abandoned the campaign with temporary Ottoman gains in Tabriz and the Urmia region, a lasting presence in the province of Van, control of the western half of Azerbaijan and some forts in Georgia.\nIn 1553, Suleiman began his third and final campaign against the Shah. Having initially lost territories in Erzurum to the Shah's son, Suleiman retaliated by recapturing Erzurum, crossing the Upper Euphrates and laying waste to parts of Persia. The Shah's army continued its strategy of avoiding the Ottomans, leading to a stalemate from which neither army made any significant gain. In 1555, a settlement known as the Peace of Amasya was signed, which defined the borders of the two empires. By this treaty, Armenia and Georgia were divided equally between the two, with Western Armenia, western Kurdistan, and western Georgia (incl. western Samtskhe) falling in Ottoman hands while Eastern Armenia, eastern Kurdistan, and eastern Georgia (incl. eastern Samtskhe) stayed in Safavid hands. The Ottoman Empire obtained most of Iraq, including Baghdad, which gave them access to the Persian Gulf, while the Persians retained their former capital Tabriz and all their other northwestern territories in the Caucasus and as they were prior to the wars, such as Dagestan and all of what is now Azerbaijan.\nCampaigns in the Indian Ocean.\nOttoman ships had been sailing in the Indian Ocean since the year 1518. Ottoman admirals such as Hadim Suleiman Pasha, Seydi Ali Reis and Kurto\u011flu H\u0131z\u0131r Reis are known to have voyaged to the Mughal imperial ports of Thatta, Surat and Janjira. The Mughal Emperor Akbar the Great himself is known to have exchanged six documents with Suleiman the Magnificent.\nSuleiman led several naval campaigns against the Portuguese in an attempt to remove them and reestablish trade with the Mughal Empire. Aden in Yemen was captured by the Ottomans in 1538, in order to provide an Ottoman base for raids against Portuguese possessions on the western coast of the Mughal Empire. Sailing on, the Ottomans failed against the Portuguese at the siege of Diu in September 1538, but then returned to Aden, where they fortified the city with 100 pieces of artillery. From this base, Sulayman Pasha managed to take control of the whole country of Yemen, also taking Sana'a.\nWith its strong control of the Red Sea, Suleiman successfully managed to dispute control of the trade routes to the Portuguese and maintained a significant level of trade with the Mughal Empire throughout the 16th century.\nFrom 1526 until 1543, Suleiman stationed over 900 Turkish soldiers to fight alongside the Somali Adal Sultanate led by Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi during the Conquest of Abyssinia. After the first Ajuran-Portuguese war, the Ottoman Empire would in 1559 absorb the weakened Adal Sultanate into its domain. This expansion furthered Ottoman rule in Somalia and the Horn of Africa. This also increased its influence in the Indian Ocean to compete with the Portuguese Empire with its close ally, the Ajuran Empire.\nIn 1564, Suleiman received an embassy from Aceh (a sultanate on Sumatra, in modern Indonesia), requesting Ottoman support against the Portuguese. As a result, an Ottoman expedition to Aceh was launched, which was able to provide extensive military support to the Acehnese.\nThe discovery of new maritime trade routes by Western European states allowed them to avoid the Ottoman trade monopoly. The Portuguese discovery of the Cape of Good Hope in 1488 initiated a series of Ottoman-Portuguese naval wars in the Ocean throughout the 16th century. The Ajuran Sultanate allied with the Ottomans defied the Portuguese economic monopoly in the Indian Ocean by employing a new coinage which followed the Ottoman pattern, thus proclaiming an attitude of economic independence in regard to the Portuguese.\nMediterranean and North Africa.\nHaving consolidated his conquests on land, Suleiman was greeted with the news that the fortress of Koroni in Morea (the modern Peloponnese, peninsular Greece) had been lost to Charles V's admiral, Andrea Doria. The presence of the Spanish in the Eastern Mediterranean concerned Suleiman, who saw it as an early indication of Charles V's intention to rival Ottoman dominance in the region. Recognizing the need to reassert naval preeminence in the Mediterranean, Suleiman appointed an exceptional naval commander in the form of Khair ad Din, known to Europeans as Barbarossa. Once appointed admiral-in-chief, Barbarossa was charged with rebuilding the Ottoman fleet.\nIn 1535, Charles V led a Holy League of 26,700 soldiers (10,000 Spaniards, 8,000 Italians, 8,000 Germans, and 700 Knights of St. John) to victory against the Ottomans at Tunis, which together with the war against Venice the following year, led Suleiman to accept proposals from Francis I of France to form an alliance against Charles. Huge Muslim territories in North Africa were annexed. The piracy carried on thereafter by the Barbary pirates of North Africa can be seen in the context of the wars against Spain.\nIn 1541, the Spaniards led an unsuccessful expedition to Algiers. In 1542, facing a common Habsburg enemy during the Italian Wars, Francis I sought to renew the Franco-Ottoman alliance. In early 1542, Polin successfully negotiated the details of the alliance, with the Ottoman Empire promising to send 60,000 troops against the territories of the German king Ferdinand, as well as 150 galleys against Charles, while France promised to attack Flanders, harass the coasts of Spain with a naval force, and send 40 galleys to assist the Turks for operations in the Levant.\nIn August 1551, Ottoman naval commander Turgut Reis attacked and captured Tripoli, which had been a possession of the Knights of Malta since 1530. In 1553, Turgut Reis was nominated commander of Tripoli by Suleiman, making the city an important center for piratical raids in the Mediterranean and the capital of the Ottoman province of Tripolitania. In 1560, a powerful naval force was sent to recapture Tripoli, but that force was defeated in the Battle of Djerba.\nElsewhere in the Mediterranean, when the Knights Hospitallers were re-established as the Knights of Malta in 1530, their actions against Muslim navies quickly drew the ire of the Ottomans, who assembled another massive army in order to dislodge the Knights from Malta. The Ottomans invaded Malta in 1565, undertaking the Great Siege of Malta, which began on 18 May and lasted until 8 September, and is portrayed vividly in the frescoes of Matteo Perez d'Aleccio in the Hall of St. Michael and St. George. At first, it seemed that this would be a repeat of the battle on Rhodes, with most of Malta's cities destroyed and half the Knights killed in battle; but a relief force from Spain entered the battle, resulting in the loss of 10,000 Ottoman troops and the victory of the local Maltese citizenry.\nLegal and political reforms.\nWhile Sultan Suleiman was known as \"the Magnificent\" in the West, he was always \"Kanuni\" Suleiman or \"The Lawgiver\" () to his Ottoman subjects. The overriding law of the empire was the Shari'ah, or Sacred Law, which as the divine law of Islam was outside of the Sultan's powers to change. Yet an area of distinct law known as the \"Kanuns\" (, canonical legislation) was dependent on Suleiman's will alone, covering areas such as criminal law, land tenure and taxation. He collected all the judgments that had been issued by the nine Ottoman Sultans who preceded him. After eliminating duplications and choosing between contradictory statements, he issued a single legal code, all the while being careful not to violate the basic laws of Islam.\nIt was within this framework that Suleiman, supported by his Grand Mufti Ebussuud, sought to reform the legislation to adapt to a rapidly changing empire. When the Kanun laws attained their final form, the code of laws became known as the \"kanun\u2010i Osmani\" (), or the \"Ottoman laws\". Suleiman's legal code was to last more than three hundred years.\nThe Sultan also played a role in protecting the Jewish subjects of his empire for centuries to come. In late 1553 or 1554, on the suggestion of his favorite doctor and dentist, the Spanish Jew Moses Hamon, the Sultan issued a \"firman\" () formally denouncing blood libels against the Jews. Furthermore, Suleiman enacted new criminal and police legislation, prescribing a set of fines for specific offenses, as well as reducing the instances requiring death or mutilation. In the area of taxation, taxes were levied on various goods and produce, including animals, mines, profits of trade, and import-export duties.\nHigher \"medreses\" provided education of university status, whose graduates became \"imams\" () or teachers. Educational centers were often one of many buildings surrounding the courtyards of mosques, others included libraries, baths, soup kitchens, residences and hospitals for the benefit of the public.\nThe arts under Suleiman.\nUnder Suleiman's patronage, the Ottoman Empire entered the golden age of its cultural development. Hundreds of imperial artistic societies (called the \"Ehl-i Hiref\", \"Community of the Craftsmen\") were administered at the Imperial seat, the Topkap\u0131 Palace. After an apprenticeship, artists and craftsmen could advance in rank within their field and were paid commensurate wages in quarterly annual installments. Payroll registers that survive testify to the breadth of Suleiman's patronage of the arts, the earliest of the documents dating from 1526 list 40\u00a0societies with over 600\u00a0members. The \"Ehl-i Hiref\" attracted the empire's most talented artisans to the Sultan's court, both from the Islamic world and from the recently conquered territories in Europe, resulting in a blend of Arabic, Turkish and European cultures. Artisans in service of the court included painters, book binders, furriers, jewellers and goldsmiths. Whereas previous rulers had been influenced by Persian culture (Suleiman's father, Selim I, wrote poetry in Persian), Suleiman's patronage of the arts saw the Ottoman Empire assert its own artistic legacy.\nThe long reign of Suleiman the Magnificent is also recognized as the apogee of Ottoman political and cultural development, with extensive patronage in art and architecture by the sultan, his family, and his high-ranking officials. The master architect of the classical period, Mimar Sinan, served as the chief court architect (\"mimarba\u015fi\") from 1538 until his death in 1588. Sinan credited himself with the design of over 300 buildings, though another estimate of his works puts it at nearly 500. He is credited with designing buildings as far as Buda (present-day Budapest) and Mecca. Sinan was probably not present to directly supervise projects far from the capital, so in these cases his designs were most likely executed by his assistants or by local architects. This also demonstrates the ability of the central Ottoman state to commission and plan building projects across its vast territory at the time, a practice that also helped to establish Ottoman sovereignty in these provinces through the construction of monuments in a visibly Ottoman style. Architects in the capital were able to draw plans and delegate them to other architects who carried them out locally, while the imperial administration developed a set of standards for planning and construction and was able to coordinate the procurement and transportation of the necessary materials.\nSuleiman himself was an accomplished poet, writing in Persian and Turkish under the takhallus (nom de plume) \"Muhibbi\" (, \"Lover\"). Some of Suleiman's verses have become Turkish proverbs, such as the well-known \"Everyone aims at the same meaning, but many are the versions of the story\". When his young son Mehmed died in 1543, he composed a moving chronogram to commemorate the year: \"Peerless among princes, my Sultan Mehmed\". In Turkish the chronogram reads (\"\u015eehzadeler g\u00fczidesi Sultan Muhammed'\u00fcm\"), in which the Arabic Abjad numerals total 955, the equivalent in the Islamic calendar of 1543\u00a0AD. In addition to Suleiman's own work, many great talents enlivened the literary world during Suleiman's rule, including Fuz\u00fbl\u00ee and B\u00e2k\u00ee. The literary historian Elias John Wilkinson Gibb observed that \"at no time, even in Turkey, was greater encouragement given to poetry than during the reign of this Sultan\". Suleiman's most famous verse is:\n&lt;poem style=\"margin-left:2em\"&gt;\nThe people think of wealth and power as the greatest fate,\nBut in this world a spell of health is the best state.\nWhat men call sovereignty is a worldly strife and constant war;\nWorship of God is the highest throne, the happiest of all estates.\n&lt;/poem&gt;\nSuleiman is credited with large-scale cultivation of the tulip and it is thought that the tulips spread throughout Europe because of Suleiman. It is thought that diplomats who visited him were gifted the flowers while visiting his court. Some of the nobles in the court had seen the tulip and they also began growing their own. Soon images of the tulip were woven into rugs and fired into ceramics.\nArtistic developments.\nAmong the leading poets who emerged during the reign of Suleiman I are Fuz\u00fbl\u00ee , B\u00e2ki , Pir Sultan Abdal and Ba\u011fdatl\u0131 Ruhi . \u00a0Matrak\u00e7\u0131 Nasuh was one of the important painters, historians and miniature artists of the period. \u00a0Also living in this period and writing the \"Suleimanname\" , Shahnameh Arif\u00ee, Nakka\u015f Nigar\u00ee and calligrapher Ahmed Karahisari are among the leading artists of the period.\nDuring the reign of Sultan Suleiman, the Grand Vizier Pargal\u0131 Ibrahim Pasha also brought mythological statues known as \"the Three Beauties\" from Buda to Istanbul after the Battle of Moh\u00e1cs and erected them in his palace in the At Meydan\u0131. Although these statues attracted attention, they were not permanent because they were seen as idols by some circles and were not welcomed. In addition to these statues, works by some Eastern and Western thinkers were brought from Buda to Istanbul and a library was established. These works were obtained as war booty from the large library established by the Hungarian king Matthias Corvinus. In this respect, Suleiman takes his place as an influential and important sultan in the Ottoman library culture. At the same time, in 1532, during the Ottoman-Habsburg rivalry, Suleiman the Magnificent wanted to show his superiority in every field, so he had a four-tiered crown made by Venetian merchants for 115,000 ducats through the Italian chief treasurer Alvise Gritti and with the encouragement of Makbul \u0130brahim Pasha . The four layers of the crown represent the four continents known at the time, and it is also known that it was made as a reference to the famous three-tiered crown of the Pope. Although it is thought that the crown was melted down after S\u00fcleyman, its legend in Europe did not end, and it was frequently depicted by European painters on the heads of Ottoman Sultans such as Mehmed IV and Ahmed I.\nSuleiman also became renowned for sponsoring a series of monumental architectural developments within his empire. The Sultan sought to turn Constantinople into the center of Islamic civilization by a series of projects, including bridges, mosques, palaces and various charitable and social establishments. The greatest of these were built by the Sultan's chief architect, Mimar Sinan, under whom Ottoman architecture reached its zenith. Sinan became responsible for over three hundred monuments throughout the empire, including his two masterpieces, the S\u00fcleymaniye and Selimiye mosques\u2014the latter built in Adrianople (now Edirne) in the reign of Suleiman's son Selim II. Suleiman also restored the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem and the Walls of Jerusalem (which are the current walls of the Old City of Jerusalem), renovated the Kaaba in Mecca, and constructed a complex in Damascus.\n\u015eehzade Mosque complex, commissioned by Suleiman was dedicated to \u015eehzade Mehmed, his son who died in 1543. The mosque complex was built between 1545 and 1548. Like all imperial \"k\u00fclliye\"s, it included multiple buildings, of which the mosque was the most prominent element. The mosque has a rectangular floor plan divided into two equal squares, with one square occupied by the courtyard and the other occupied by the prayer hall. Two minarets stand on either side at the junction of these two squares.\nIn 1550, through Mimar Sinan, Suleiman began construction for the S\u00fcleymaniye complex, a monumental religious and charitable complex dedicated to him. Construction finished in 1557. Following the example of the earlier Fatih complex, it consists of many buildings arranged around the main mosque in the center, on a planned site occupying the summit of a hill in Istanbul. The buildings included the mosque itself, four general madrasas, a madrasa specialized for medicine, a madrasa specialized for hadiths (\"dar\u00fclhadis\"), a \"mektep\", a \"dar\u00fc\u015f\u015fifa\", a caravanserai, a \"tabhane\", an imaret, a hammam, rows of shops, and a cemetery with two mausoleums. The site was formerly occupied by the grounds of the Old Palace (\"Eski Saray\") built by Mehmet II, which had been damaged by fire. By this point, Suleiman had also moved his own residence and the royal family to Topkap\u0131 Palace. In order to adapt the hilltop site, Sinan had to begin by laying solid foundations and retaining walls to form a wide terrace. The overall layout of buildings is less rigidly symmetrical than the Fatih complex, as Sinan opted to integrate it more flexibly into the existing urban fabric. Thanks to its refined architecture, its scale, its dominant position on the city skyline, and its role as a symbol of Suleiman's powerful reign, the S\u00fcleymaniye Mosque complex is one of the most important symbols of Ottoman architecture and is often considered by scholars to be the most magnificent mosque in Istanbul.\nThe prayer hall consists of a central dome surrounded by semi-domes on four sides, with smaller domes occupying the corners. Smaller semi-domes also fill the space between the corner domes and the main semi-domes. This design represents the culmination of the previous domed and semi-domed buildings in Ottoman architecture, bringing complete symmetry to the dome layout. An early version of this design, on a smaller scale, had been used before Sinan as early as 1520 or 1523 in the Fatih Pasha Mosque in Diyarbakir. While a cross-like layout had symbolic meaning in Christian architecture, in Ottoman architecture this was purely focused on heightening and emphasizing the central dome.\nUnder his reign, The Topkap\u0131 Palace was greatly expanded with the permanent addition of the Imperial Harem to the Palace. From the reign of Suleiman, Topkapi not only served as the administrative center of the Empire, but also as the Imperial Residence of all succeeding Ottoman Sultans and the entire Ottoman Royal family until the 19th century.\nPersonal life.\nConsorts.\nSuleiman had two known consorts:\nSons.\nSuleiman I had at least eight sons:\nDaughters.\nSuleiman had two daughters: \nRelationship with Hurrem Sultan.\nSuleiman fell in love with Hurrem Sultan, a harem girl from Ruthenia, then part of Poland. Western diplomats, taking notice of the palace gossip about her, called her \"Russelazie\" or \"Roxelana\", referring to her Ruthenian origins. The daughter of an Orthodox priest, she was captured by Tatars from Crimea, sold as a slave in Constantinople, and eventually rose through the ranks of the Harem to become Suleiman's favorite. Hurrem, a former concubine, became the legal wife of the Sultan, much to the astonishment of the observers in the palace and the city. He also allowed Hurrem Sultan to remain with him at court for the rest of her life, breaking another tradition\u2014that when imperial heirs came of age, they would be sent along with the imperial concubine who bore them to govern remote provinces of the Empire, never to return unless their progeny succeeded to the throne.\nHurrem was the first Ottoman woman to directly take part in state affairs of the Ottoman Empire and she acted as an advisor to Suleiman in taking decisions. She used to sign documents in his absence, attended Imperial council meetings, held meetings with Grand Viziers and ministers to discuss regarding state affairs, controlled the appointments and even removal of ministers, grand vizier and even the Sheikh-ul-Islam from office and corresponded with ambassadors and Foreign rulers, particularly with Sigismund II Augustus. She played a major role in the creation of the Polish-Ottoman alliance. Suleiman not only declared her as his legal wife, but also created an Institutionalized title and position for her as the Haseki sultan of the Ottoman Empire, making her as the second most powerful person in the empire after Suleiman. Suleiman was completely loyal towards her for rest of his life, and his love for her and his decisions to grant her more powers, made rumors throughout the Ottoman court that the sultan had been bewitched.\nUnder his pen name, Muhibbi, Sultan Suleiman composed this poem for Hurrem Sultan:\n&lt;poem style=\"margin-left:2em\"&gt;\nThrone of my lonely niche, my wealth, my love, my moonlight.\nMy most sincere friend, my confidant, my very existence, my Sultan, my one and only love.\nThe most beautiful among the beautiful\u00a0...\nMy springtime, my merry faced love, my daytime, my sweetheart, laughing leaf\u00a0...\nMy plants, my sweet, my rose, the one only who does not distress me in this room\u00a0...\nMy Istanbul, my Karaman, the earth of my Anatolia\nMy Badakhshan, my Baghdad and Khorasan\nMy woman of the beautiful hair, my love of the slanted brow, my love of eyes full of misery\u00a0...\nI'll sing your praises always\nI, lover of the tormented heart, Muhibbi of the eyes full of tears, I am happy.\n&lt;/poem&gt;\nGrand Vizier Pargal\u0131 Ibrahim Pasha.\nBefore his downfall, Pargal\u0131 Ibrahim Pasha was an inseparable friend and possible lover of Suleiman. In fact, he is referred to by his chroniclers as \"the favourite\" (Ma\u1e33b\u016bl) along with \"the executed\" (Ma\u1e33t\u016bl). Historians state that Suleiman I is remembered for \"his passion for two of his slaves: for his beloved Ibrahim when the sultan was a hot-blooded youth, and for his beloved Hurrem when he was mature.\"\nIbrahim was originally a Christian from Parga (in Epirus), who was captured in a raid during the 1499\u20131503 Ottoman\u2013Venetian War, and was given as a slave to Suleiman most likely in 1514. Ibrahim converted to Islam and Suleiman made him the royal falconer, then promoted him to first officer of the Royal Bedchamber. It was reported that they slept together in the same bed. The sultan also built Ibrahim a lavish palace on the ancient Hippodrome, Istanbul's main forum outside the Hagia Sophia and Topkap\u0131 Palace. Despite his following marriage and his new sumptuous residence, Ibrahim sometimes spent the night with Suleiman I at Topkap\u0131 Palace. In turn, the sultan occasionally slept at Ibrahim's lodgings. Ibrahim Pasha rose to Grand Vizier in 1523 and commander-in-chief of all the armies. Suleiman also conferred upon Ibrahim Pasha the honor of \"beylerbey\" of Rumelia (first-ranking military governor-general), granting Ibrahim authority over all Ottoman territories in Europe, as well as command of troops residing within them in times of war. At the time, Ibrahim was only about thirty years old and lacked any actual military expertise; it is said that 'tongues wagged' at this unprecedented promotion straight from palace service to the two highest offices of the empire.\nDuring his thirteen years as Grand Vizier, his rapid rise to power and vast accumulation of wealth had made Ibrahim many enemies at the Sultan's court. Suleiman's suspicion of Ibrahim was worsened by a quarrel between the latter and the finance secretary (\"defterdar\") \u0130skender \u00c7elebi. The dispute ended in the disgrace of \u00c7elebi on charges of intrigue, with Ibrahim convincing Suleiman to sentence the \"defterdar\" to death. Ibrahim also supported \u015eehzade Mustafa as the successor of Suleiman. This caused disputes between him and Hurrem Sultan, who wanted her sons to succeed to the throne. Ibrahim eventually fell from grace with the Sultan and his wife. Suleiman consulted his Qadi, who suggested that Ibrahim be put to death. The Sultan recruited assassins and ordered them to strangle Ibrahim in his sleep.\nSuccession.\nSultan Suleiman's two known consorts (Hurrem and Mahidevran) had borne him six sons, four of whom survived past the 1550s. They were Mustafa, Selim, Bayezid, and Cihangir. The eldest was Mahidevran's son, while Selim, Bayezid, and Cihangir were born to Hurrem. Hurrem is usually held at least partly responsible for the intrigues in nominating a successor, though there is no evidence to support this. Although she was Suleiman's wife, she exercised no official public role. This did not, however, prevent Hurrem from wielding powerful political influence. Until the reign of Ahmed I (1603\u20131617), the Empire had no formal means of nominating a successor, so successions usually involved the death of competing princes in order to avert civil unrest and rebellions.\nBy 1552, when the campaign against Persia had begun with R\u00fcstem appointed commander-in-chief of the expedition, intrigues against Mustafa began. R\u00fcstem sent one of Suleiman's most trusted men to report that since Suleiman was not at the head of the army, the soldiers thought the time had come to put a younger prince on the throne; at the same time, he spread rumours that Mustafa had proved receptive to the idea. Angered by what he came to believe were Mustafa's plans to claim the throne, the following summer upon return from his campaign in Persia, Suleiman summoned him to his tent in the Ere\u011fli valley. When Mustafa entered his father's tent to meet with him, Suleiman's eunuchs attacked Mustafa, and after a long struggle the mutes killed him using a bow-string.\nCihangir is said to have died of grief a few months after the news of his half-brother's murder. The two surviving brothers, Selim and Bayezid, were given command in different parts of the empire. Within a few years, however, civil war broke out between the brothers, each supported by his loyal forces. With the aid of his father's army, Selim defeated Bayezid in Konya in 1559, leading the latter to seek refuge with the Safavids along with his four sons. Following diplomatic exchanges, the Sultan demanded from the Safavid Shah that Bayezid be either extradited or executed. In return for large amounts of gold, the Shah allowed a Turkish executioner to strangle Bayezid and his four sons in 1561, clearing the path for Selim's succession to the throne five years later.\nDeath.\nOn 6 September 1566, Suleiman, who had set out from Constantinople to command an expedition to Hungary, died before an Ottoman victory at the siege of Szigetv\u00e1r in Hungary at the age of 71 and his Grand Vizier Sokollu Mehmed Pasha kept his death secret during the retreat for the enthronement of Selim II. The sultan's body was taken back to Istanbul to be buried, while his heart, liver, and some other organs were buried in Turb\u00e9k, outside Szigetv\u00e1r. A mausoleum constructed above the burial site came to be regarded as a holy place and pilgrimage site. Within a decade a mosque and Sufi hospice were built near it, and the site was protected by a salaried garrison of several dozen men.\nLegacy.\nThe formation of Suleiman's legacy began even before his death. Throughout his reign literary works were commissioned praising Suleiman and constructing an image of him as an ideal ruler, most significantly by Celalzade Mustafa, chancellor of the empire from 1534 to 1557. Later Ottoman writers applied this idealised image of Suleiman to the Near Eastern literary genre of advice literature named \"na\u1e63\u012b\u1e25atn\u0101me\", urging sultans to conform to his model of rulership and to maintain the empire's institutions in their sixteenth-century form. Such writers were pushing back against the political and institutional transformation of the empire after the middle of the sixteenth century, and portrayed deviation from the norm as it had existed under Suleiman as evidence of the decline of the empire. Western historians, failing to recognise that these 'decline writers' were working within an established literary genre and often had deeply personal reasons for criticizing the empire, long took their claims at face value and consequently adopted the idea that the empire entered a period of decline after the death of Suleiman. Since the 1980s this view has been thoroughly reexamined, and modern scholars have come to overwhelmingly reject the idea of decline, labelling it an \"untrue myth\".\nSuleiman's conquests had brought under the control of the Empire major Muslim cities (such as Baghdad), many Balkan provinces (reaching present day Croatia and Hungary), and most of North Africa. His expansion into Europe had given the Ottoman Turks a powerful presence in the European balance of power. Indeed, such was the perceived threat of the Ottoman Empire under the reign of Suleiman that Austria's ambassador Busbecq warned of Europe's imminent conquest: \"On [the Turks'] side are the resources of a mighty empire, strength unimpaired, habituation to victory, endurance of toil, unity, discipline, frugality and watchfulness\u00a0... Can we doubt what the result will be?\u00a0... When the Turks have settled with Persia, they will fly at our throats supported by the might of the whole East; how unprepared we are I dare not say.\" Suleiman's legacy was not, however, merely in the military field. The French traveler Jean de Th\u00e9venot bears witness a century later to the \"strong agricultural base of the country, the well being of the peasantry, the abundance of staple foods and the pre-eminence of organization in Suleiman's government\".\nEven thirty years after his death, \"Sultan Solyman\" was quoted by the English playwright William Shakespeare as a military prodigy in \"The Merchant of Venice\", where the Prince of Morocco boasts about his prowess by saying that he defeated Suleiman in three battles (Act 2, Scene 1).\nThrough the distribution of court patronage, Suleiman also presided over a golden age in Ottoman arts, witnessing immense achievement in the realms of architecture, literature, art, theology and philosophy. Today the skyline of the Bosphorus and of many cities in modern Turkey and the former Ottoman provinces, are still adorned with the architectural works of Mimar Sinan. One of these, the S\u00fcleymaniye Mosque, is the final resting place of Suleiman: he is buried in a domed mausoleum attached to the mosque.\nNevertheless, assessments of Suleiman's reign have frequently fallen into the trap of the Great Man theory of history. The administrative, cultural, and military achievements of the age were a product not of Suleiman alone, but also of the many talented figures who served him, such as grand viziers Ibrahim Pasha and R\u00fcstem Pasha, the Grand Mufti Ebussuud Efendi, who played a major role in legal reform, and chancellor and chronicler Celalzade Mustafa, who played a major role in bureaucratic expansion and in constructing Suleiman's legacy.\nIn an inscription dating from 1537 on the citadel of Bender, Moldova, Suleiman the Magnificent gave expression to his power:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I am God's slave and sultan of this world. By the grace of God I am head of Muhammad's community. God's might and Muhammad's miracles are my companions. I am S\u00fcleym\u00e2n, in whose name the hutbe is read in Mecca and Medina. In Baghdad I am the shah, in Byzantine realms the caesar, and in Egypt the sultan; who sends his fleets to the seas of Europe, the Maghrib and India. I am the sultan who took the crown and throne of Hungary and granted them to a humble slave. The voivoda Petru raised his head in revolt, but my horse's hoofs ground him into the dust, and I conquered the land of Moldovia.\nSuleiman, as sculpted by Joseph Kiselewski, is present on one of the 23 relief portraits over the gallery doors of the House Chamber of the United States Capitol that depicts historical figures noted for their work in establishing the principles that underlie American law.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nPrinted sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAdditional on-line sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
