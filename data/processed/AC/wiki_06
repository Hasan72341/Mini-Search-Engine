The longtime icon and mascot of the Walt Disney Company, Mickey is an anthropomorphic mouse who typically wears red shorts, large shoes, and white gloves. He is often depicted with a cast of characters including his girlfriend Minnie Mouse, his pet dog Pluto, his best friends Donald Duck and Goofy, and his nemesis Pete.\nMickey was created as a replacement for a prior Disney character, Oswald the Lucky Rabbit. The character was originally to be named \"Mortimer Mouse\", until Disney's wife, Lillian, suggested \"Mickey\". Mickey first appeared in two 1928 shorts \"Plane Crazy\" and \"The Gallopin' Gaucho\" (which were not picked up for distribution) before his public debut in \"Steamboat Willie\" (1928). The character went on to appear in over 130 films, mostly shorts as well as features such as \"Fantasia\" (1940). Since 1930, Mickey has been featured extensively in comic strips (including the \"Mickey Mouse\" comic strip, which ran for 45 years) and comic books (such as \"Mickey Mouse\"). The character has also been featured in television series such as \"The Mickey Mouse Club\" (1955\u20131996).\nInspired by such silent film personalities as Charlie Chaplin and Douglas Fairbanks, Mickey is traditionally portrayed as a sympathetic underdog who gets by on pluck and ingenuity in the face of challenges bigger than himself. The character's depiction as a small mouse is personified through his diminutive stature and falsetto voice, the latter of which was originally provided by Walt Disney. Though originally characterized as a cheeky lovable rogue, Mickey was rebranded over time as a nice guy, usually seen as a spirited, yet impulsive hero.\nMickey also appears in media such as video games as well as merchandising and is a meetable character at the Disney parks. He is one of the world's most recognizable and universally acclaimed fictional characters. Ten of Mickey's cartoons were nominated for the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film, one of which, \"Lend a Paw\", won the award in 1941. In 1978, Mickey became the first cartoon character to have a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCreation.\nMickey Mouse was created as a replacement for Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, an earlier cartoon character that was created by the Disney studio but owned at the time by Universal Pictures. Charles Mintz served as a middleman producer between Disney and Universal through his company, Winkler Pictures, for the series of cartoons starring Oswald. In a February 1928 meeting with Mintz to renew the Oswald contract, Disney was met by a disappointing budget cut proposal, along with Mintz's revelation that several of the most important Disney animators were coming over to his studio. Among the few who stayed at the Disney studio were animator Ub\u00a0Iwerks, apprentice artist Les Clark, and Wilfred Jackson.\nA new character was workshopped out of necessity and in relative secret. Various myths exist of Walt Disney's inspiration for Mickey (including some which were likely ghostwritten), such as that the starving artist drew inspiration from a tame mouse (or pair of mice) at his desk at Laugh-O-Gram Studio in Kansas City, Missouri, or that he undertook a romantic search for inspiration on the train ride home from his disappointing meeting with Mintz. At Disney's behest, Iwerks sketched new character ideas based on various animals such as dogs and cats, but none of these appealed to Disney. A female cow and male horse were rejected, as was a male frog. In 1925, Hugh Harman drew some sketches of mice around a photograph of Walt Disney, reputedly based on Disney's own designs (similar to those he included on family birthday cards). These inspired Iwerks to create a new mouse character for Disney.\n\"Mortimer Mouse\" had been Disney's original name for the character before his wife, Lillian, convinced him to change it. It has been speculated that Disney saw the name on a similarly named Performo toy. Additionally, actor Mickey Rooney claimed that during his time performing as the title character of the \"Mickey McGuire\" film series (1927\u20131934), he met Walt Disney at the Warner Bros. studio, inspiring Disney to name the character after him; however, Disney Studios was located on Hyperion Avenue at the time, with Disney conducting no business at Warner Bros.\nThe first feature-length movie with dialogue sequences, \"The Jazz Singer\" starring Al\u00a0Jolson, was released on October 6, 1927. Several additional talkies followed, and movie theaters began installing the necessary equipment. Walt Disney reputedly discussed making sound cartoons in late May 1928. After composer Carl W. Stalling initially voiced Mickey for the 1929 talkie shorts \"The Karnival Kid\" and \"Wild Waves\", Disney himself provided the often-shy falsetto voice\u2014a large part of the character's onscreen persona.\nDesign.\nMickey's original design strongly resembled Oswald the Rabbit, save for the ears, nose, and tail. Ub Iwerks designed Mickey's body out of circles (distinctly, the ears) to make the character easy to animate.\nUpon his creation, Mickey's features shared similarities to a number of his cartoon predecessors with large eyes and mouth on a black body (e.g. Oswald and Felix the Cat). From early 1929, Mickey also wore white gloves (similar to those appearing on later characters, e.g. Bosko and Bimbo). Several sources state that this scheme evolved from blackface caricatures used in minstrel shows.\nAdditionally, Mickey's original black hands could not be seen if they passed in front of his torso. This limitation encouraged animators to base their poses on silhouette, much in the manner of Charlie Chaplin films.\nMinnie Mouse was designed similarly to Mickey, with only superficial details being different. In the 1930s, animator Fred Moore tried giving Mickey's body more of a pear shape to increase his acting range; Walt Disney liked this adaptation and declared, \"that's the way I want Mickey to be drawn from now on.\" Moore maintained that the character should always be drawn from a pleasing angle, ears included, as opposed to depicting Mickey as a realistic 3D character.\nMickey's eyes were originally large and white with black outlines, with the tops able to deform like eyebrows; the pupil was circular (with a triangle cut out in\u00a0poster close-ups to simulate reflected light). Starting with \"Steamboat Willie\", the bottom portion of the black outlines was removed, often making the pupil placement look strange. The pupils began to be treated as stationary, dotlike eyes, requiring the entire head to be moved to make Mickey look around. During the production of \"Fantasia\" in the late 1930s, Fred Moore redesigned Mickey with small white pupilled eyes, with the redefined facial area being given a light skin color. Distinct, lined eyebrows were later added and are currently used occasionally.\nBesides Mickey's gloves and shoes, he typically wears only a pair of shorts with two large buttons in the front. Before Mickey was seen regularly in color animation, Mickey's shorts were either red or a dull blue-green. With the advent of Mickey's color films, they were always red. When Mickey is not wearing his shorts, he is often still wearing red clothing. Due to budgetary limits imposed by World War\u00a0II, Mickey temporarily lost his tail, e.g. in \"The Little Whirlwind\" (1941).\nAppearances.\nFilm.\nDebut (1928).\nMickey was first seen in a test screening of the cartoon short \"Plane Crazy\", on May 15, 1928, but it failed to impress the audience and Walt could not find a distributor for it. Walt went on to produce a second Mickey short, \"The Gallopin' Gaucho\", which was also not released for lack of a distributor.\n\"Steamboat Willie\" was first released on November 18, 1928, in New York. It was co-directed by Walt Disney and Ub Iwerks. Iwerks again served as the head animator, assisted by Les Clark, Johnny Cannon, Wilfred Jackson and Dick Lundy. This short was a nod to Buster Keaton's \"Steamboat Bill,\u00a0Jr.\", released earlier that year. Although it was the third Mickey cartoon produced, it was the first to find a distributor, and thus is considered by The Disney Company as Mickey's debut. It also featured some design refinements, and included the use of a bouncing ball on the film print to allow conductors and musicians to match the tempo of their music with the film.\nThe cartoon was not the first cartoon to feature a soundtrack connected to the action. Fleischer Studios, headed by brothers Dave and Max Fleischer, had already released a number of sound cartoons using the DeForest system in the mid-1920s. However, these cartoons did not keep the sound synchronized throughout the film. For \"Willie\", Disney had the sound recorded with a click track that kept the musicians on the beat. This precise timing is apparent during the \"Turkey in the Straw\" sequence when Mickey's actions exactly match the accompanying instruments. Animation historians have long debated who had served as the composer for the film's original music. This role has been variously attributed to Wilfred Jackson, Carl Stalling and Bert Lewis, but identification remains uncertain. Walt Disney himself was voice actor for both Mickey and Minnie and would remain the source of Mickey's voice through 1946 for theatrical cartoons. Jimmy MacDonald took over the role in 1946, but Walt provided Mickey's voice again from 1955 to 1959 for \"The Mickey Mouse Club\" television series on ABC.\nAudiences at the time of \"Steamboat Willie\"'s release were reportedly impressed by the use of sound for comedic purposes. Sound films or \"talkies\" were still considered innovative. Most other cartoon studios were still producing silent products and so were unable to effectively act as competition to Disney. As a result, Mickey would soon become the most prominent animated character of the time. Walt Disney soon worked on adding sound to both \"Plane Crazy\" and \"The Gallopin' Gaucho\" (which had originally been silent releases) and their new release added to Mickey's success and popularity. A fourth Mickey short, \"The Barn Dance\", was also put into production; however, Mickey does not actually speak until \"The Karnival Kid\" (1929). After \"Steamboat Willie\" was released, Mickey became a close competitor to Felix the Cat, and his popularity would grow as he was continuously featured in sound cartoons. By 1929, Felix would lose popularity among theater audiences, and Pat Sullivan decided to produce all future Felix cartoons in sound as a result. Audiences did not respond well to Felix's transition to sound and by 1930, Felix had faded from the screen.\nBlack and white films (1929\u20131935).\nIn Mickey's early films he was often characterized not as a hero, but as an ineffective young suitor to Minnie Mouse. \"The Barn Dance\" (March 14, 1929) is the first time in which Mickey is turned down by Minnie in favor of Pete. \"The Opry House\" (March 28, 1929) was the first time in which Mickey wore his white gloves. Mickey wears them in almost all of his subsequent appearances and many other characters followed suit. The three lines on the back of Mickey's gloves represent darts in the gloves' fabric extending from between the digits of the hand, typical of glove design of the era.\n\"When the Cat's Away\" (April 18, 1929), essentially a remake of the \"Alice Comedy\", \"Alice Rattled by Rats\", was an unusual appearance for Mickey. Although Mickey and Minnie still maintained their anthropomorphic characteristics, they were depicted as the size of regular mice and living with a community of many other mice as pests in a home. Mickey and Minnie would later appear the size of regular humans in their own setting. In appearances with real humans, Mickey has been shown to be about two to three feet high. The next Mickey short was also unusual. \"The Barnyard Battle\" (April 25, 1929) was the only film to depict Mickey as a soldier and also the first to place him in combat. \"The Karnival Kid\" (1929) was the first time Mickey spoke. Before this he had only whistled, laughed, and grunted. His first words were \"Hot dogs! Hot dogs!\" said while trying to sell hot dogs at a carnival. \"Mickey's Follies\" (1929) introduced the song \"Minnie's Yoo-Hoo\" which would become the theme song for \"Mickey Mouse\" films until 1935. The same song sequence was also later reused with different background animation as its own special short shown only at the commencement of 1930s theater-based Mickey Mouse Clubs. Mickey's dog Pluto first appeared as Mickey's pet in \"The Moose Hunt\" (1931) after previously appearing as Minnie's dog \"Rover\" in \"The Picnic\" (1930).\n\"Wild Waves\" was the last Mickey Mouse cartoon to be animated by Ub Iwerks. Iwerks left to start his own studio, bankrolled by Disney's then-distributor Pat Powers. Powers and Disney had a falling out over money due Disney from the distribution deal. It was in response to losing the right to distribute Disney's cartoons that Powers made the deal with Iwerks, who had long harbored a desire to head his own studio. The departure is considered a turning point in Mickey's career, as well as that of Walt Disney. Walt lost the man who served as his closest colleague and confidant since 1919. Mickey lost the man responsible for his original design and for the direction or animation of several of the shorts released till this point. Advertising for the early Mickey Mouse cartoons credited them as \"A Walt Disney Comic, drawn by Ub Iwerks\". Later Disney Company reissues of the early cartoons tend to credit Walt Disney alone. \"Wild Waves\" was also composer Carl Stalling's last film with the Walt Disney Studio. Stalling joined Iwerks at his new studio.\nDisney and his remaining staff continued the production of the Mickey series, and he was able to eventually find a number of animators to replace Iwerks. As the Great Depression progressed and Felix the Cat faded from the movie screen, Mickey's popularity would rise, and by 1932 The Mickey Mouse Club would have one million members. At the 5th Academy Awards in 1932, Mickey received his first Academy Award nomination, received for \"Mickey's Orphans\" (1931). Walt Disney also received an honorary Academy Award for the creation of Mickey Mouse. Despite being eclipsed by the \"Silly Symphony\" short the \"Three Little Pigs\" in 1933, Mickey still maintained great popularity among theater audiences too, until 1935, when polls showed that Popeye was more popular than Mickey. By 1934, Mickey merchandise had earned $600,000 a year. In 1935, Disney began to phase out the Mickey Mouse Clubs, due to administration problems.\nAbout this time, story artists at Disney were finding it increasingly difficult to write material for Mickey. As he had developed into a role model for children, they were limited in the types of gags they could present. This led to Mickey taking more of a secondary role in some of his next films, allowing for more emphasis on other characters. In \"Orphan's Benefit\" (1934), Mickey first appeared with Donald Duck who had been introduced earlier that year in the \"Silly Symphony\" series. The tempestuous duck would provide Disney with seemingly endless story ideas and would remain a recurring character in Mickey's cartoons.\nColor films (1935\u20131953).\nMickey first appeared animated in color in \"Parade of the Award Nominees\" in 1932; however, the film strip was created for the 5th Academy Awards ceremony and was not released to the public. Mickey's official first color film came in 1935 with \"The Band Concert\". The Technicolor film process was used in the film production. Here Mickey conducted the \"William Tell Overture\", but the band is swept up by a tornado. It is said that conductor Arturo Toscanini so loved this short that, upon first seeing it, he asked the projectionist to run it again. In 1994, \"The Band Concert\" was voted the third-greatest cartoon of all time in a poll of animation professionals. By colorizing and partially redesigning Mickey, Walt put Mickey back on top once again. Mickey reach new heights of popularity. Also in 1935, Walt would receive a special award from the League of Nations for creating Mickey.\nThe second half of the 1930s saw the character Goofy reintroduced as a series regular. Together, Mickey, Donald Duck, and Goofy would go on several adventures together. Several of the films by the comic trio are some of Mickey's most critically acclaimed films, including \"Mickey's Fire Brigade\" (1935), \"Moose Hunters\" (1937), \"Clock Cleaners\" (1937), \"Lonesome Ghosts\" (1937), \"Boat Builders\" (1938), and \"Mickey's Trailer\" (1938). Also during this era, Mickey was the star in \"Brave Little Tailor\" (1938), an adaptation of \"The Valiant Little Tailor\", which was nominated for an Academy Award.\nIn 1939, Mickey appeared in \"Mickey's Surprise Party\", along with Minnie, with a new design, which gave him smaller, more detailed eyes. In 1940, Mickey appeared in his first feature-length film, \"Fantasia\", which utilized his redesign. His screen role as The Sorcerer's Apprentice, set to the symphonic poem of the same name by Paul Dukas, is perhaps the most famous segment of the film and one of Mickey's most iconic roles. The apprentice (Mickey), not willing to do his chores, puts on the sorcerer's magic hat after the sorcerer goes to bed and casts a spell on a broom, which causes the broom to come to life and perform the most tiring chore\u2014filling up a deep well using two buckets of water. When the well eventually overflows, Mickey finds himself unable to control the broom, leading to a near-flood. After the segment ends, Mickey is seen in silhouette shaking hands with conductor Leopold Stokowski. Mickey has often been pictured in the red robe and blue sorcerer's hat in merchandising. It was also featured into the climax of Fantasmic!, an attraction at the Disney theme parks.\nAfter 1940, Mickey's popularity declined until his 1955 re-emergence as a daily children's television personality. Despite this, the character continued to appear regularly in animated shorts until 1943 (winning his only competitive Academy Award\u2014with canine companion Pluto\u2014for the short subject \"Lend a Paw\") and again from 1946 to 1952. In these later cartoons, Mickey was often just a supporting character in his own shorts. Pluto was instead used as the main character.\nThe last regular installment of the \"Mickey Mouse\" film series came in 1953 with \"The Simple Things\" in which Mickey and Pluto go fishing and are pestered by a flock of seagulls.\nTelevision and later films.\nIn the 1950s, Mickey became more known for his appearances on television, particularly with \"The Mickey Mouse Club\". Many of his theatrical cartoon shorts were rereleased on television series such as \"Ink &amp; Paint Club\", various forms of the Walt Disney anthology television series, and on home video. Mickey returned to theatrical animation in 1983 with \"Mickey's Christmas Carol\", an adaptation of Charles Dickens' \"A Christmas Carol\" in which Mickey played Bob Cratchit. This was followed up in 1990 with \"The Prince and the Pauper\".\nThroughout the decades, Mickey Mouse competed with Warner Bros.' Bugs Bunny for animated popularity. But in 1988, the two rivals finally shared screen time in the Robert Zemeckis Touchstone Pictures/Amblin Entertainment film \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\". Disney and Warner signed an agreement stating that each character had the same amount of screen time in the scene.\nSimilar to his animated inclusion into a live-action film in \"Roger Rabbit\", Mickey made a featured cameo appearance in the 1990 television special \"The Muppets at Walt Disney World\" where he met Kermit the Frog. The two are established in the story as having been old friends, although they have not made any other appearance together outside of this.\nHis most recent theatrical cartoon short was 2013's \"Get a Horse!\" which was preceded by 1995's \"Runaway Brain\", while from 1999 to 2004, he appeared in direct-to-video features like \"Mickey's Once Upon a Christmas\", \"\" and \"Mickey's Twice Upon a Christmas\".\nMany television series have centered on Mickey, such as the ABC shows \"Mickey Mouse Works\" (1999\u20132000), \"House of Mouse\" (2001\u20132003), Disney Jr.'s \"Mickey Mouse Clubhouse\" (2006\u20132016), \"Mickey Mouse Mixed-Up Adventures\" (2017\u20132021), \"Mickey Mouse Funhouse\" (2021\u2013present), and \"Mickey Mouse Clubhouse+\" (2025-present). Prior to all these, Mickey was also featured as an unseen character in the \"Bonkers\" episode \"I Oughta Be in Toons\".\nIn 2013, Disney Channel started airing new 3-minute \"Mickey Mouse\" shorts, with animator Paul Rudish at the helm, incorporating elements of Mickey's late twenties-early thirties look with a contemporary twist. On November 10, 2020, the series was revived as \"The Wonderful World of Mickey Mouse\" and premiered on Disney+. Furthermore, The creative team behind the 2017 \"DuckTales\" reboot had hoped to have Mickey Mouse in the series, but this idea was rejected by Disney executives. However, a watermelon bearing Mickey's physical likeness appears in one episode as a ventriloquist dummy companion to Donald Duck.\nIn August 2018, ABC television announced a two-hour prime time special, \"Mickey's 90th Spectacular\", in honor of Mickey's 90th birthday. The program featured never-before-seen short videos and several other celebrities who wanted to share their memories about Mickey Mouse and performed some of the Disney songs to impress Mickey. The show took place at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles and was produced and directed by Don Mischer on November 4, 2018. On November 18, 2018, a 90th anniversary event for the character was celebrated around the world. In December 2019, both Mickey and Minnie served as special co-hosts of \"Wheel of Fortune\" for two weeks while Vanna White served as the main host during Pat Sajak's absence.\nMickey is the subject of the 2022 documentary film \"\", directed by Jeff Malmberg. Premiering at the South by Southwest film festival prior to its premiere on the Disney+ streaming service, the documentary examines the history and cultural impact of Mickey Mouse. The feature is accompanied by an original, hand-drawn animated short film starring Mickey titled \"Mickey in a Minute\".\nMickey appeared in Walt Disney Animation Studios' centennial short film, \"Once Upon a Studio\", in which he corrals the characters of Disney's animated features to take a group picture.\nComics.\nMickey first appeared in comics after he had appeared in 15 commercially successful animated shorts and was easily recognized by the public. Walt Disney was approached by King Features Syndicate with the offer to license Mickey and his supporting characters for use in a comic strip. Disney accepted and \"Mickey Mouse\" made its first appearance on January 13, 1930. The comical plot was credited to Disney himself, art to Ub Iwerks and inking to Win Smith. The first week or so of the strip featured a loose adaptation of \"Plane Crazy\". Minnie soon became the first addition to the cast. The strips first released between January 13, 1930, and March 31, 1930, have been occasionally reprinted in comic book form under the collective title \"Lost on a Desert Island\". Animation historian Jim Korkis notes, \"After the eighteenth strip, Iwerks left and his inker, Win Smith, continued drawing the gag-a-day format.\"\nIn early 1930, after Iwerks' departure, Disney was at first content to continue scripting the Mickey Mouse comic strip, assigning the art to Win Smith. However, Disney's focus had always been in animation and Smith was soon assigned with the scripting as well. Smith was apparently discontent at the prospect of having to script, draw, and ink a series by himself as evidenced by his sudden resignation.\nDisney then searched for a replacement among the remaining staff of the Studio. He selected Floyd Gottfredson, a recently hired employee. At the time Gottfredson was reportedly eager to work in animation and somewhat reluctant to accept his new assignment. Disney had to assure him the assignment was only temporary and that he would eventually return to animation. Gottfredson accepted and ended up holding this \"temporary\" assignment from May 5, 1930, to November 15, 1975.\nWalt Disney's last script for the strip appeared May 17, 1930. Gottfredson's first task was to finish the storyline Disney had started on April 1, 1930. The storyline was completed on September 20, 1930, and later reprinted in comic book form as \"Mickey Mouse in Death Valley\". This early adventure expanded the cast of the strip which to this point only included Mickey and Minnie. Among the characters who had their first comic strip appearances in this story were Clarabelle Cow, Horace Horsecollar, and Black Pete as well as the debuts of corrupted lawyer Sylvester Shyster and Minnie's uncle Mortimer Mouse. The Death Valley narrative was followed by \"Mr. Slicker and the Egg Robbers\", first printed between September 22 and December 26, 1930, which introduced Marcus Mouse and his wife as Minnie's parents.\nStarting with these two early comic strip stories, Mickey's versions in animation and comics are considered to have diverged from each other. While Disney and his cartoon shorts would continue to focus on comedy, the comic strip effectively combined comedy and adventure. This adventurous version of Mickey would continue to appear in comic strips and later comic books throughout the 20th and into the 21st century.\nFloyd Gottfredson left his mark with stories such as \"Mickey Mouse Joins the Foreign Legion\" (1936) and \"The Gleam\" (1942). He also created the Phantom Blot, Eega Beeva, Morty and Ferdie, Captain Churchmouse, and Butch. Besides Gottfredson artists for the strip over the years included Roman Arambula, Rick Hoover, Manuel Gonzales, Carson Van Osten, Jim Engel, Bill Wright, Ted Thwailes and Daan Jippes; writers included Ted Osborne, Merrill De Maris, Bill Walsh, Dick Shaw, Roy Williams, Del Connell, and Floyd Norman.\nThe next artist to leave his mark on the character was Paul Murry in Dell Comics. His first Mickey tale appeared in 1950 but Mickey did not become a specialty until Murry's first serial for \"Walt Disney's Comics and Stories\" in 1953 (\"The Last Resort\"). In the same period, Romano Scarpa in Italy for the magazine \"Topolino\" began to revitalize Mickey in stories that brought back the Phantom Blot and Eega Beeva along with new creations such as the Atomo Bleep-Bleep. While the stories at Western Publishing during the Silver Age emphasized Mickey as a detective in the style of Sherlock Holmes, in the modern era several editors and creators have consciously undertaken to depict a more vigorous Mickey in the mold of the classic Gottfredson adventures. This renaissance has been spearheaded by Byron Erickson, David Gerstein, Noel Van Horn, Michael T. Gilbert and C\u00e9sar Ferioli.\nIn Europe, Mickey Mouse became the main attraction of a number of comics magazines, the most famous being \"Topolino\" in Italy from 1932 onward, \"Le\u00a0Journal de Mickey\" in France from 1934 onward, \"Don Miki\" in Spain and the Greek \"Miky Maous\".\nMickey was the main character for the series \"MM\u00a0Mickey Mouse Mystery Magazine\", published in Italy from 1999 to 2001.\nIn 2006, he appeared in the Italian fantasy comic saga \"Wizards of Mickey\".\nIn 1958, Mickey Mouse was introduced to the Arab world through another comic book called \"Sameer\". He became very popular in Egypt and got a comic book with his name. Mickey's comics in Egypt are licensed by Disney and were published since 1959 by \"Dar Al-Hilal\" and they were successful, however Dar Al-Hilal stopped the publication in 2003 because of problems with Disney. The comics were re-released by \"Nahdat Masr\" in 2004 and the first issues were sold out in less than 8 hours.\nPortrayal.\nMickey is traditionally characterized as a sympathetic underdog who gets by on pluck and ingenuity in the face of challenges much bigger than himself. As a mouse, an inherently vulnerable creature, Mickey is often depicted as having minimal resources and attributes at his disposal. Consequently, he must rely on sheer wit to overcome obstacles. The character is frequently pitted against larger-than-life villains to accentuate this idea; namely the hulking cat Pegleg Pete, and numerous one-shot antagonists such as the giants of \"Giantland\" (1933) and \"Brave Little Tailor\" (1938), the king of cards in \"Thru the Mirror\" (1936) and Mortimer Mouse in \"Mickey's Rival\" (1936). These adversaries were decidedly portrayed as overbearing figures of authority, thusly painting Mickey as a rebellious hero. When not facing an opponent, Mickey is oft placed in situations where his pursuits of grandeur or simple accomplishment lead to disastrous results, typically at the hands of his own impulsivity, as was the case in \"The Sorcerer's Apprentice\" (1940) among others. Mickey is not portrayed as a hero in the traditional sense, instead acting as a subversion of the stock archetype. He often fumbles his way through adventures; his small size and misplaced optimism serving as his dominating flaws. His manner of problem-solving is generally unorthodox to comedic effect; in \"Ye Olden Days\" (1933), Mickey's jousting horse was an infantile mule. In \"Shanghaied\" (1934), Mickey battled with a broadbill in place of a sword. The underdog nature of Mickey's character has been interpreted by historians as a symbolic reflection of Walt Disney's early struggles as a farm boy breaking into the imposing Hollywood industry in the 1920s. It has also been perceived as an allegory for the Great Depression in the United States, with Mickey's unrelenting optimism symbolizing the \"American endurance to survive\" in the face of economic woes.\nCharlie Chaplin, known by audiences of the time for his role as the \"Little Tramp\", was identified by Disney as a source of inspiration for the Mickey character. Disney himself was a noted admirer of Chaplin's work, ascribing his development as a storyteller to the actor. In \"The American Magazine\" for March 1931, Disney explained, \"I think we were rather indebted to Charlie Chaplin for the idea [of Mickey Mouse]. We wanted something appealing and we thought of a tiny bit of a mouse that would have something of the wistfulness of Chaplin... a little fellow trying to do the best he could.\" American journalist Alva Johnston noted the similarities between the two figures, stating, \"Chaplin was a kind of godfather to Mickey Mouse. It is now and always has been the aim of Disney to graft the psychology of Chaplin upon Mickey. The two universal characters have something in common in their approach to their problems. They have the same blend of hero and coward, nitwit and genius, mug and gentleman.\"\nBesides Chaplin, other notable figures of the silent era have been credited to Mickey's characterization. Chief among them was Douglas Fairbanks, whose swashbuckling screen adventures would inspire Mickey's animated epics. Ub Iwerks wrote in 1970, \"He was the super-hero of his day, always winning, gallant and swashbuckling. Mickey's action was in that vein. He was never intended to be a sissy, he was always an adventurous character. I thought of him in that respect, and I had him do naturally the sort of thing Doug Fairbanks would do.\" Disney was also noted to have been influenced by Fairbanks, along with other screen personalities including Harold Lloyd and Fred Astaire.\nAn adaptive character, Mickey's personality lends itself to function within a multitude of situations, while retaining core elements of its design. He is not bound to a particular formula or motif, and as such, has been portrayed in a variety of settings and occupational roles. His film series, meanwhile, spans numerous genres besides the traditional musical comedy; \"The Mad Doctor\" (1933) and \"Runaway Brain\" (1995) parody the horror genre, whereas stories such as \"Mickey's Good Deed\" (1932) and \"The Prince and the Pauper\" (1990) are largely dramatic works. This versatility is said to have attributed to Mickey's popularity with audiences. As expressed by writer Chelsea Tatham, \"From his beginnings, Mickey was able to appeal to a wide audience. He catered to neither the 'highbrow' nor the 'hick,' but the ordinary intelligent picturegoer.\"\nThere are a number of catchphrases and colloquialisms associated with the character. Mickey's first spoken words, \"Hot dog!\" from \"The Karnival Kid\" (1929), has endured as a recurring phrase for the character, made especially recognizable to modern audiences for its extensive use in the preschool television program \"Mickey Mouse Clubhouse\". Mickey's signature closing line, \"See ya real soon!\", is derived from the \"Mickey Mouse March\" reprise from the original 1955 run of \"The Mickey Mouse Club\" (\"M-I-C; see you real soon!\").\nVoice actors.\nBetween 1929 and 1930, studio staff members would provide Mickey's dialogue and vocal effects for some cartoons. Composer Carl W. Stalling provided lines for Mickey in the 1929 shorts \"The Karnival Kid\" and \"Wild Waves\" and performed his singing voice in \"Mickey's Follies\". From this point on, Mickey was voiced by Walt Disney himself, being a job in which he appeared to take great personal pride. Helen Lynd filled in for Disney on one occasion in 1930.\nBilly Bletcher and Pinto Colvig provided Mickey's mask voice and screams in \"Mickey's Man Friday\". J. Donald Wilson and Joe Twerp provided the voice in some 1938 broadcasts of \"The Mickey Mouse Theater of the Air\", and Ford Banes voiced Mickey briefly in \"Tugboat Mickey\", \"Pluto's Dream House\", \"The Little Whirlwind\", \"A Gentleman's Gentleman\", \"Canine Caddy\", and \"Mickey and the Seal\", although Disney remained Mickey's official voice during this period. However, by 1946, Disney was becoming too busy with running the studio to do regular voice work which meant he could not do Mickey's voice on a regular basis anymore. It is also speculated that his cigarette habit had damaged his voice over the years. After recording the \"Mickey and the Beanstalk\" section of \"Fun and Fancy Free\", Mickey's voice was handed over to veteran Disney musician and actor Jimmy MacDonald. Walt would reprise Mickey's voice occasionally until his passing in 1966, such as in the introductions to the original 1955\u20131959 run of \"The Mickey Mouse Club\" TV series, the \"Fourth Anniversary Show\" episode of the Walt Disney's Disneyland TV series that aired on September 11, 1957, and the \"Disneyland USA at Radio City Music Hall\" show from 1962.\nMacDonald voiced Mickey in most of the remaining theatrical shorts and for various television and publicity projects up until his retirement in 1976. However, other actors would occasionally play the role during this era. Clarence Nash, the voice of Donald Duck, provided Mickey's voice in four theatrical shorts, \"Plutopia\", \"R'coon Dawg\", \"Pluto's Party\", and \"Pluto's Christmas Tree\". Stan Freberg voiced Mickey in the Freberg-produced record \"Mickey Mouse's Birthday Party\".\nAlan Young voiced Mickey in the Disneyland record album \"An Adaptation of Dickens' Christmas Carol, Performed by The Walt Disney Players\" in 1974.\nThe 1983 short film \"Mickey's Christmas Carol\" marked the theatrical debut of Wayne Allwine as Mickey Mouse, who was the official voice of Mickey from 1977 until his death in 2009, although MacDonald returned to voice Mickey for an appearance at the 50th Academy Awards in 1978. Allwine once recounted something MacDonald had told him about voicing Mickey: \"The main piece of advice that Jim gave me about Mickey helped me keep things in perspective. He said, 'Just remember kid, you're only filling in for the boss.' And that's the way he treated doing Mickey for years and years. From Walt, and now from Jimmy.\" In 1991, Allwine married Russi Taylor, the voice of Minnie Mouse from 1986 until her death in 2019.\nPeter Renaday voiced Mickey in many 1970s and 1980s Disney records and albums, such as \"Yankee Doodle Mickey\", \"Mickey Mouse Splashdance\", and several Disney Read-Along titles. He also provided his voice for \"The Talking Mickey Mouse\" toy in 1986. Jack Wagner voiced Mickey and other Disney characters in the 1980s, primarily for live entertainment offerings in the parks, \"Disney on Ice\" shows, and live-action clips for television. Les Perkins did the voice of Mickey in two TV specials, \"Down and Out with Donald Duck\" and \"DTV Valentine\", in the mid-1980s. Quinton Flynn briefly filled in for Allwine as the voice of Mickey in a few episodes of the first season of \"Mickey Mouse Works\" whenever Allwine was unavailable to record.\nBret Iwan, a former Hallmark greeting card artist, has been the official voice of Mickey since 2009. Iwan was originally cast as an understudy for Allwine due to the latter's declining health, but Allwine died before Iwan could get a chance to meet him and Iwan became the new official voice of the character at the time. Iwan's early recordings in 2009 included work for the Disney Cruise Line, Mickey toys, the Disney theme parks and the \"Disney on Ice: Celebrations!\" ice show. He directly replaced Allwine as Mickey for the \"Kingdom Hearts\" video game series and the TV series \"Mickey Mouse Clubhouse\". His first video game voice-over of Mickey Mouse can be heard in '. Iwan also became the first voice actor to portray Mickey during Disney's rebranding of the character, providing the vocal effects of Mickey in \"Epic Mickey\" as well as his voice lines in ' and the remake of \"Castle of Illusion\". An openly gay man, Iwan is the character's first LGBT+ performer.\nIn addition to Iwan, Chris Diamantopoulos was cast as Mickey for the \"Mickey Mouse\" 2013 animated series developed by Paul Rudish, as the producers were looking for a voice closer to Walt Disney's portrayal of the character to match the vintage look of the series. Diamantopoulos is the first voice of Mickey to be nominated for two Emmy Awards and two Annie Awards for his work in the series. He reprised the role in the 2017 \"DuckTales\" reboot (in the form of a watermelon that Donald uses as a ventriloquist dummy), the Walt Disney World attraction Mickey &amp; Minnie's Runaway Railway, \"The Wonderful World of Mickey Mouse\", and \"Once Upon a Studio\".\nNancy Cartwright voiced Mickey in several \"Simpsons\" shorts produced for Disney +.\nMerchandising.\nSince his early years, Mickey Mouse has been licensed by Disney to appear on many different kinds of merchandise. Mickey was produced as plush toys and figurines, and Mickey's image has graced almost everything from T-shirts to lunchboxes. Largely responsible for early Disney merchandising was Kay Kamen, Disney's head of merchandise and licensing from 1932 until his death in 1949, who was called a \"stickler for quality\". Kamen was recognized by the Walt Disney Company as having a significant part in Mickey's rise to stardom and was named a Disney Legend in 1998. At the time of his 80th-anniversary celebration in 2008, \"Time\" declared Mickey Mouse one of the world's most recognized characters, even when compared against Santa Claus. Disney officials have stated that 98% of children aged 3\u201311 around the world are at least aware of the character. Disney expected the \"Mickey Mouse &amp; Friends\" brand to make $9 billion in retail sales in 2011.\nDisney parks.\nAs the official Walt Disney mascot, Mickey has played a central role in the Disney parks since the opening of Disneyland in 1955. As with other characters, Mickey is often portrayed by a non-speaking costumed actor. In this form, he has participated in ceremonies and countless parades, and poses for photographs with guests. As of the presidency of Barack Obama (who jokingly referred to him as \"a world leader who has bigger ears than me\") Mickey has met every U.S. president since Harry Truman, with the exception of Lyndon B. Johnson.\nMickey also features in several specific attractions at the Disney parks. Mickey's Toontown (Disneyland and Tokyo Disneyland) is a themed land which is a recreation of Mickey's neighborhood. Buildings are built in a cartoon style and guests can visit Mickey or Minnie's houses, Donald Duck's boat, or Goofy's garage. This is a common place to meet the characters.\nMickey's PhilharMagic (Magic Kingdom, Tokyo Disneyland, Hong Kong Disneyland, Disney California Adventure) is a 4D film which features Mickey in the familiar role of symphony conductor. At Main Street Cinema several of Mickey's short films are shown on a rotating basis; the sixth film is always \"Steamboat Willie\". Mickey plays a central role in \"Fantasmic!\" (Disneyland Resort, Disney's Hollywood Studios) a live nighttime show which famously features Mickey in his role as the Sorcerer's Apprentice. Mickey was also a central character in the now-defunct Mickey Mouse Revue (Magic Kingdom, Tokyo Disneyland) which was an indoor show featuring animatronic characters. Mickey's face formerly graced the Mickey's Fun Wheel (now Pixar Pal-A-Round) at Disney California Adventure Park, where a figure of him also stands on top of Silly Symphony Swings.\nMickey &amp; Minnie's Runaway Railway at Disney's Hollywood Studios is a trackless dark ride themed to Mickey Mouse.\nIn addition to Mickey's overt presence in the parks, numerous images of him are also subtly included in sometimes unexpected places. This phenomenon is known as \"Hidden Mickeys\", involving hidden images in Disney films, theme parks, and merchandise.\nVideo games.\nMickey has starred in many video games, including \"Mickey Mousecapade\" on the Nintendo Entertainment System, ', \"Mickey's Ultimate Challenge\", and \"Disney's Magical Quest\" on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, \"Castle of Illusion Starring Mickey Mouse\" on the Mega Drive/Genesis, ' on the Game Boy, and many others. In the 2000s, the \"Disney's Magical Quest\" series were ported to the Game Boy Advance, while Mickey made his sixth generation era debut in \"Disney's Magical Mirror Starring Mickey Mouse\", a GameCube title aimed at younger audiences. Mickey plays a major role in the \"Kingdom Hearts\" series, where he is depicted as a Keyblade Master and the king of Disney Castle. \"Epic Mickey\", featuring a darker version of the Disney universe, was released in 2010 for the Wii. The game is part of an effort by the Walt Disney Company to re-brand the Mickey Mouse character by moving away from his current squeaky clean image and reintroducing the mischievous side of his personality. Mickey Mouse is a playable character in the mobile game \"Disney Heroes: Battle Mode\".\nWatches and clock.\nMickey was famously featured on wristwatches and alarm clocks, typically utilizing his hands as the actual hands on the face of the clock. The first Mickey Mouse watches were manufactured in 1933 by the Ingersoll Watch Company. The seconds were indicated by a turning disk below Mickey. The first Mickey watch was sold at the Century of Progress in Chicago, 1933 for $3.75 (). Mickey Mouse watches have been sold by other companies and designers throughout the years, including Timex, Elgin, Helbros, Bradley, Lorus, and G\u00e9rald Genta. The fictional character Robert Langdon from Dan Brown's novels was said to wear a Mickey Mouse watch as a reminder \"to stay young at heart.\"\nOther products.\nIn 1989, Milton Bradley released the electronic talking game titled \"Mickey Says\", with three modes featuring Mickey Mouse as its host. Mickey also appeared in other toys and games, including the Worlds of Wonder released \"The Talking Mickey Mouse\".\nFisher-Price has produced a line of talking animatronic Mickey dolls including \"Dance Star Mickey\" (2010) and \"Rock Star Mickey\" (2011).\nIn total, approximately 40% of Disney's revenues for consumer products are derived from Mickey Mouse merchandise, with revenues peaking in 1997.\nSocial impact.\nUse in protest votes.\nIn the United States, protest votes are often made to indicate dissatisfaction with the slate of candidates presented on a particular ballot or to highlight the inadequacies of a particular voting procedure. Since most states' electoral systems do not provide for blank balloting or a choice of \"None of the Above\", most protest votes take the form of a clearly non-serious candidate's name entered as a write-in vote. Mickey Mouse is often selected for this purpose. As an election supervisor in Georgia observed, \"If Mickey Mouse doesn't get votes in our election, it's a bad election.\" The earliest known mention of Mickey Mouse as a write-in candidate dates back to the 1932 New York City mayoral elections.\nMickey Mouse's name has also been known to appear fraudulently on voter registration lists, such as in the 2008 U.S. presidential election.\nPejorative use of Mickey's name.\n\"Mickey Mouse\" is a slang expression meaning small-time, amateurish or trivial. In the United Kingdom and Ireland, it also means poor quality or counterfeit. In Poland the phrase \"ma\u0142y Miki\", which translates to \"small Mickey\", means something very simple and trivial \u2013 usually used in the comparison between two things. However, in parts of Australia it can mean excellent or very good (rhyming slang for \"grouse\"). Examples of the negative usages include the following:\nAdditionally, the term \"Mickey Mousing\" refers to the exact synching of a film score to each action depicted onscreen, in reference to the early cartoons that used this technique. Although not inherently a pejorative term, the technique has long fallen out of fashion, and the term has taken on a secondary meaning indicating material interpreted as being too simplistic for its target audience.\nParodies and criticism.\nMickey Mouse's global fame has made him both a symbol of the Walt Disney Company and of the United States itself. For this reason, Mickey has been used frequently in anti-establishment or anti-American satire, such as the infamous underground cartoon \"Mickey Mouse in Vietnam\" (1969) and the Palestinian children's propaganda series \"Tomorrow's Pioneers\" where a Mickey Mouse-esque character named Farfour is used to promote Islamic extremism. There have been numerous parodies of Mickey Mouse, such as the two-page parody \"Mickey Rodent\" by Will Elder (published in \"Mad\" #19, 1955) in which the mouse walks around unshaven and jails Donald Duck out of jealousy over the duck's larger popularity. In \"The Simpsons Movie\", Bart Simpson puts a black bra on his head to mimic Mickey Mouse and says: \"I'm the mascot of an evil corporation!\" \"The Simpsons\" would later become Disney property as its distributor Fox was acquired by Disney. In the Comedy Central series \"South Park\", Mickey (voiced by Trey Parker) serves as a recurring antagonist, depicted as the sadistic, greedy, and foul-mouthed boss of the Walt Disney Company. He also appears briefly with Donald Duck in the comic \"Squeak the Mouse\" by Italian cartoonist Massimo Mattioli.\nMickey Mouse has also been particularly commented upon in the context of fascism and antisemitism in Nazi Germany. A pro-Nazi newspaper in the mid-1930s denounced Disney's use of \"the greatest bacteria carrier in the animal kingdom\" as evidence of the \"Jewish brutalization of the people\". Artist Horst Rosenthal created a comic book, \"Mickey au Camp de Gurs\" (\"Mickey Mouse in the Gurs Internment Camp\") while detained in the Gurs internment camp, subtitled \"Publi\u00e9 Sans Autorisation de Walt Disney\" (\"Published without Walt Disney's Permission\"); Rosenthal's Mickey names Walt Disney as his father, but is sorted into the camps as a Jew after being unable to name a mother, a seeming parody of both Disney's rumoured antisemitism and of the American public's ignorance around racial divisions in Europe. Cartoonist Art Spiegelman adapted Nazi descriptions of Jews as rodents and vermin for his graphic novel \"Maus\"; The original three-page strip uses a young Mickey Mouse as a stand-in for Spiegelman, listening to tales of \"Mauschwitz\" and the Holocaust told by his father Vladek. The full 1991 adaptation of the strip uses a comparatively direct anthropomorphization of Spiegelman, but otherwise continues to use Mickey Mouse imagery to connect contemporary America to the genocide.\nIn the 1969 parody novel \"Bored of the Rings\", Mickey Mouse is satirized as Dickey Dragon.\nLegal issues.\nAlthough the earliest designs of Mickey Mouse entered the public domain in 2024, the character, like all major Disney characters, remains trademarked by Disney. Trademarks last for as long as it continues to be used commercially by its owner. So, while people are free to use early designs of Mickey Mouse, due to him being trademarked, there are still limitations. For example, the character cannot be referred to as \"Mickey Mouse\" without permission, nor can the early designs be used \"...in a way that misleads consumers into thinking your work is produced or sponsored by Disney.\" \nBetween 1991 and 1998, the Walt Disney Company filed a trademark infringement complaint against the Paraguayan Mickey brand whose logo shares similarities with Mickey Mouse. Ultimately, Disney lost the case as Mickey SRL had continuously used the trademark since 1956 without prior complaint.\nDue to the Copyright Term Extension Act of the United States (sometimes called the \"Mickey Mouse Protection Act\" because of extensive lobbying by the Disney corporation) and similar legislation within the European Union and other jurisdictions where copyright terms have been extended, the early Steamboat Willie version of Mickey Mouse cartoons remained under copyright until the end of 2023. The 1928 version of Mickey entered the U.S. public domain at the start of 2024, and in 2025 the cartoons and versions of Mickey from 1929 joined them.\nCopyright scholars have argued that Disney's copyright on the earliest version of the character may have been invalid due to ambiguity in the copyright notice for \"Steamboat Willie\".\nThe Walt Disney Company is well known for zealously protecting its trademark on Mickey Mouse\u2014whose likeness is synonymous and closely associated with the company. In 1989, Disney threatened legal action against three daycare centers in the Orlando, Florida region (where Walt Disney World is a dominant employer) for having Mickey Mouse and other Disney characters painted on their walls. The characters were removed, and the newly opened rival Universal Studios Florida allowed the centers to use their own cartoon characters with their blessing, to build community goodwill.\n\"Walt Disney Productions v. Air Pirates\".\nIn 1971, a group of underground cartoonists calling themselves the Air Pirates, after a group of villains from early Mickey Mouse films, produced a comic called \"Air Pirates Funnies\". In the first issue, cartoonist Dan O'Neill depicted Mickey and Minnie Mouse engaging in explicit sexual behavior and consuming drugs. As O'Neill explained, \"The air pirates were...some sort of bizarre concept to steal the air, pirate the air, steal the media...Since we were cartoonists, the logical thing was Disney.\" Rather than change the appearance or name of the character, which O'Neill felt would dilute the parody, the mouse depicted in \"Air Pirates Funnies\" looks like and is named \"Mickey Mouse\". Disney sued for copyright infringement, and after a series of appeals, O'Neill eventually lost and was ordered to pay Disney $1.9 million. The outcome of the case remains controversial among free-speech advocates. New York Law School professor Edward Samuels said, \"The Air Pirates set parody back twenty years.\"\nCopyright status.\nPrior to 2024, there had been multiple attempts in the United States to argue that certain versions of Mickey Mouse were in fact in the public domain. In the 1980s, archivist George S. Brown attempted to recreate and sell cels from the 1933 short \"The Mad Doctor\", on the theory that they were in the public domain because Disney had failed to renew the copyright as required by current law. However, Disney successfully sued Brown to prevent such sale, arguing that the lapse in copyright for \"The Mad Doctor\" did not put Mickey Mouse in the public domain because of the copyright in the earlier films. Brown attempted to appeal, noting imperfections in the earlier copyright claims, but the court dismissed his argument as untimely.\nIn 1999, Lauren Vanpelt, a law student at Arizona State University, wrote a paper making a similar argument. Vanpelt points out that copyright law at the time required a copyright notice specify the year of the copyright and the copyright owner's name. The title cards to early Mickey Mouse films \"Steamboat Willie\", \"Plane Crazy\", and \"Gallopin' Gaucho\" do not clearly identify the copyright owner, and also misidentify the copyright year. However, Vanpelt notes that copyright cards in other early films may have been done correctly, which could make Mickey Mouse \"protected as a component part of the larger copyrighted films\".\nA 2003 article by Douglas A. Hedenkamp in the \"Virginia Sports and Entertainment Law Journal\" analyzed Vanpelt's arguments, and concluded that she is likely correct. Hedenkamp provided additional arguments, and identified some errors in Vanpelt's paper, but still found that due to imperfections in the copyright notice on the title cards, Walt Disney forfeited his copyright in Mickey Mouse. He concluded: \"The forfeiture occurred at the moment of publication, and the law of that time was clear: publication without proper notice irrevocably forfeited copyright protection.\" Disney threatened to sue Hedenkamp for slander of title, but did not follow through. The claims in Vanpelt and Hedenkamp's articles have not been tested in court.\nIn a 2023 episode of \"Last Week Tonight with John Oliver\", John Oliver suggested that without copyright protection to stop the unauthorized use of Mickey Mouse, the Walt Disney Company would likely use trademark law to achieve the same results, potentially arguing that Mickey Mouse is so closely associated with their brand that any unauthorized use would cause consumer confusion. Oliver then revealed that \"Last Week Tonight\"'s opening titles had been using an image from \"Steamboat Willie\" since the start of the season and that he would begin to use his own version of Mickey Mouse as a mascot of the show. He stated:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;We are staking our claim to Mickey Mouse right now and, I know Disney's lawyers might argue that this Mickey is closely associated with their brand, although they should know that he's pretty associated with our brand now too.\nOn January 1, 2024, the copyrights of the first three animated Mickey Mouse cartoons and their portrayal of Mickey Mouse expired in the United States, and they entered the public domain. They are the silent versions of the cartoons \"Plane Crazy\" and \"The Gallopin' Gaucho\", as well as the sound cartoon \"Steamboat Willie\". Newer versions of Mickey Mouse remain copyright-protected.\nQuinton Hoover, a YouTube user who uploaded a copy of \"Steamboat Willie\" after its U.S. copyright expired on January 1, 2024, noted that three attempts to upload the short to the service triggered copyright claims from Disney, including one that claimed a copyright on the short's soundtrack. Users of Twitch noted similar behavior in that attempts to stream \"Steamboat Willie\" would end up with the audio muted. Disney withdrew a separate copyright strike from a different uploader shortly after it was challenged.\nCensorship.\nIn 1930, the German Board of Film Censors prohibited any presentations of the 1929 Mickey Mouse cartoon \"The Barnyard Battle\". The animated short, which features the mouse as a kepi-wearing soldier fighting cat enemies in German-style helmets, was viewed by censors as a negative portrayal of Germany. It was claimed by the board that the film would \"reawaken the latest anti-German feeling existing abroad since the War\". The \"Barnyard Battle\" incident did not incite wider anti-Mickey sentiment in Germany in 1930; however, after Adolf Hitler came to power several years later, the Nazi regime unambiguously propagandized against Disney. A mid-1930s German newspaper article read:\nAmerican cartoonist and writer Art Spiegelman would later use this quote on the opening page of the second volume of his graphic novel \"Maus\".\nIn 1935, Romanian authorities also banned Mickey Mouse films from cinemas, purportedly fearing that children would be \"scared to see a ten-foot mouse in the movie theatre\". In 1938, based on the Ministry of Popular Culture's recommendation that a reform was necessary \"to raise children in the firm and imperialist spirit of the Fascist revolution\", the Italian Government banned foreign children's literature except Mickey; Disney characters were exempted from the decree for the \"acknowledged artistic merit\" of Disney's work. Actually, Mussolini's children were fond of Mickey Mouse, so they managed to delay his ban as long as possible. In 1942, after Italy declared war on the United States, Italian publishers were forced to stop printing any Disney stories. Mickey's stories were replaced by the adventures of \"Tuffolino\", a new human character that looked like Mickey, created by Federico Pedrocchi (script) and Pier Lorenzo De Vita (art). After the downfall of Italy's fascist government in 1945, the ban was removed.\nFilmography.\nSelected short films.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nFull-length films.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nTelevision series.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAwards and honors.\nMickey Mouse has received ten nominations for the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film. These are \"Mickey's Orphans\" (1931), \"Building a Building\" (1933), \"Brave Little Tailor\" (1938), \"The Pointer\" (1939), \"Lend a Paw\" (1941), \"Squatter's Rights\" (1946), \"Mickey and the Seal\" (1948), \"Mickey's Christmas Carol\" (1983), \"Runaway Brain\" (1995), and \"Get a Horse!\" (2013). Among these, \"Lend a Paw\" was the only film to actually win the award. Additionally, in 1932 Walt Disney received an honorary Academy Award in recognition of Mickey's creation.\nIn 1994, four of Mickey's cartoons were included in the book \"The 50 Greatest Cartoons\" which listed the greatest cartoons of all time as voted by members of the animation field. The films were \"The Band Concert\" (#3), \"Steamboat Willie\" (#13), \"Brave Little Tailor\" (#26), and \"Clock Cleaners\" (#27).\nOn November 18, 1978, in honor of his 50th anniversary, Mickey became the first cartoon character to have a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. The star is located on 6925 Hollywood Blvd.\nMelbourne (Australia) runs the annual Moomba festival street procession and appointed Mickey Mouse as their \"King of Moomba\" (1977). Although immensely popular with children, there was controversy with the appointment: some Melburnians wanted a \"home-grown\" choice, e.g. Blinky Bill; when it was revealed that Patricia O'Carroll (from Disneyland's Disney on Parade show) was performing the mouse, Australian newspapers reported \"Mickey Mouse is really a girl!\"\nMickey was the Grand Marshal of the Tournament of Roses Parade on New Year's Day 2005. He was the first cartoon character to receive the honor and only the second fictional character after Kermit the Frog in 1996.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "20860", "revid": "2300502", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20860", "title": "Meher Baba", "text": "Indian spiritual master (1894\u20131969)\nMeher Baba (born Merwan Sheriar Irani; 25 February 1894 \u2013 31 January 1969) was an Indian spiritual master who said he was the Avatar, or the total manifestation of God in human form. A spiritual figure of the 20th century, he had a following of hundreds of thousands of people, mostly in India, with a smaller number of followers in North America, Europe, South America, and Australia.\nMeher Baba's map of consciousness has been described as \"a unique amalgam of Sufi, Vedic, and Yogic terminology\". He taught that the goal of all beings was to become conscious of their own divinity, and to realise the oneness of God.\nAt the age of 19, Meher Baba began a seven-year period of spiritual transformation, during which he had encounters with Hazrat Babajan, Upasni Maharaj, Sai Baba of Shirdi, Tajuddin Baba, and Narayan Maharaj. In 1925, he began a 44-year period of silence, during which he communicated first using an alphabet board and by 1954 entirely through hand gestures using an interpreter. Meher Baba died on 31 January 1969 and was entombed at Meherabad. His tomb, or \"samadhi\", has become a place of pilgrimage for his followers, often known as \"Baba lovers\".\nOverview of teachings.\nMeher Baba's teachings concerned the nature and purpose of life. He described the phenomenal world as illusory, and taught that the universe is imagination. He taught that God alone exists, and each soul is God passing through imagination in order to realise its own divinity. He advised followers wishing to attain God-realisation, emphasizing love and selfless-service. His other teachings included discussion of Perfect Masters, the Avatar, spiritual aspirants, and the various stages of the spiritual path, which he termed involution. \"God Speaks\" and \"Discourses\" are regarded as among his most important written works.\nFor decades he declined to speak and later refrained from communicating via written language. This practice has remained a topic of discussion among some of his followers.\nWider influence.\nHis legacy includes the Avatar Meher Baba Charitable Trust he established in India, and a handful of centers for information and pilgrimage. He has influenced pop culture creators and introduced the slogan \"Don't worry; be happy\". This was used in Bobby McFerrin's hit 1988 song of the same name. Among his followers were well-known musicians such as Melanie Safka and Pete Townshend, as well as journalists including Sir Tom Hopkinson.\nIn 1971, Meher Baba's following in the United States was estimated at 7,000 people. Some commentators have suggested that the size of the movement has been underestimated due to the rarity of proselytising by Meher Baba's followers, and that in 1975, the movement was larger than the more visible Hare Krishna movement.\nMeher Baba was accepted as the leader of a Sufi organization based in California which he renamed Sufism Reoriented. Meher Baba's Sufi influence is said to have drawn from Sai Baba of Shirdi, whom Meher Baba designated as a \"Qutb\". However, some commentators have asserted that Meher Baba's interpretation of Sufism shared very few similarities with the Sufi Movement apart from universalism and anti-dogmatism.\nLife and works.\nEarly life.\nMeher Baba was born to Irani Zoroastrian parents in 1894 in Pune, India (formerly Poona). He was named Merwan Sheriar Irani, the second son of Sheriar Irani and Shireen Irani. Sheriar Irani was a Persian Zoroastrian from Khorramshahr who had spent years wandering in search of spiritual experiences before settling in Pune.\nAs a boy, Baba formed the Cosmopolitan Club, which was dedicated to remaining informed on world affairs and donating money to charity. He was a multi-instrumentalist and poet. Fluent in several languages, he was fond of the poetry of Hafez, William Shakespeare, and Percy Bysshe Shelley.\nHis spiritual transformation began when he was 19 years old and lasted for seven years. At 19, he met Hazrat Babajan, an elderly Muslim saint. He was cycling past a tree that she had made her abode, when she called to him. When he approached her, she kissed him on the forehead, causing him to enter a nine-month-long trance which he described as \"divine bliss\", with a lack of consciousness of his body. Babajan predicted that he would become a spiritual leader. He then encountered Upasni Maharaj, who he later said helped him to integrate his mystical experiences with ordinary consciousness, thus enabling him to function in the world without diminishing his experience of God-realisation.\nOver the next several years, he encountered other spiritual figures, namely Tajuddin Baba, Narayan Maharaj, and Sai Baba of Shirdi, who, along with Babajan and Upasni Maharaj, Baba later said were the five \"Perfect Masters\" of the age. By early 1922, at the age of 27, Baba began gathering his own disciples. They gave him the name \"Meher Baba\", which means \"compassionate father\".\nIn 1922, Meher Baba and his followers established Manzil-e-Meem (House of the Master) in Mumbai. There, Baba commenced his practice of demanding strict discipline and obedience from his disciples. A year later, Baba and his mandali moved to an area a few miles outside Ahmednagar which he named Meherabad. This ashram would become the center for his work. During the 1920s, Meher Baba opened a school, hospital, and dispensary at Meherabad, all of which were free and open to all castes and faiths.\nFrom 10 July 1925 until the end of his life, Meher Baba maintained silence. He now communicated first through chalk and slate, then by an alphabet board, and later via a unique repertoire of gestures. On 1 December 1926, he wrote his last message, and began relying on an alphabet board. With his \"mandali\" (circle of disciples), he spent long periods in seclusion, during which he often fasted. He also traveled widely, held public gatherings, and engaged in works of charity with lepers and the poor.\n1930\u20131939: First contact with the West.\nBeginning in 1931, Meher Baba made the first of many visits to the West. Throughout that decade, Meher Baba began a period of world travel and took several trips to Europe and the United States. It was during this period that he established contact with his first close group of Western disciples. He traveled on a Persian passport, as he had given up writing, as well as speaking, and would not sign the forms required by the British government of India. \nOn his first trip to England in 1931, he traveled on the \"SS Rajputana\", at the same time as Mahatma Gandhi, who was sailing to the second Round Table Conference in London. Baba and Gandhi met three times on board. One of these exchanges lasted for three hours. The British press publicized these meetings, but an aide to Gandhi said, \"You may say emphatically that Gandhi never asked Meher Baba for help or for spiritual or other advice.\"\nIn the West, Meher Baba met with a number of celebrities and artists, including Gary Cooper, Charles Laughton, Tallulah Bankhead, Boris Karloff, Tom Mix, Maurice Chevalier, and Ernst Lubitsch. On 1 June 1932, Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. held a reception for Baba at Pickfair at which he delivered a message to Hollywood. As a result, says Robert S. Ellwood, Meher Baba emerged as \"one of the enthusiasms of the '30s\".\nIn 1934, after announcing that he would break his self-imposed silence in the Hollywood Bowl, Baba changed his plans abruptly, boarded the RMS \"Empress of Canada\", and sailed to Hong Kong without explanation. The Associated Press reported that \"Baba had decided to postpone the word-fast-breaking until next February because 'conditions are not yet ripe'.\" He returned to England in 1936, but did not return to the United States again until the early 1950s.\nIn the late 1930s, Meher Baba invited a group of Western women to join him in India, where he arranged a series of trips throughout India and British Ceylon that became known as the Blue Bus Tours. When the tour returned home, many newspapers treated their journey as an occasion for scandal. \"Time\" magazine's 1936 review of \"God Is My Adventure\" describes the US's fascination with the \"long-haired, silky-mustached Parsee named Shri Sadgaru [sic] Meher Baba\" four years earlier.\n1940\u20131949: Masts and the New Life.\nIn the 1930s and 1940s, Meher Baba worked with masts, or those \"intoxicated with God\". According to Baba, these individuals are disabled by their enchanting experience of the higher spiritual planes. Although outwardly masts may appear irrational or insane, Baba claimed that their spiritual status was elevated, and that by meeting with them he helped them to progress spiritually while enlisting their aid in his spiritual work. One of these masts, Mohammed, lived at Meher Baba's encampment at Meherabad until his death in 2003.\nDuring his journey in 1946, Meher Baba went to Sehwan Sharif to meet a Sufi saint and descendant of Lal Shahbaz Qalandar, Murshid Nadir Ali Shah, whom Baba referred to as an advanced pilgrim.\nIn 1949, Baba began a period that he called the New Life. Following a series of questions on their readiness to obey even the most difficult of his requests, Baba selected twenty companions to join him in a life of complete \"hopelessness and helplessness\".\nHe made provisions for those dependent on him, after which he and his companions otherwise gave up nearly all property and financial responsibilities. They traveled around India incognito while begging for food and carrying out Baba's instructions according to a strict set of conditions, including acceptance of any circumstance and consistent good cheer in the face of any difficulty. Companions who failed to comply were sent away.\nConcerning the New Life, Meher Baba wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;This New Life is endless, and even after my physical death it will be kept alive by those who live the life of complete renunciation of falsehood, lies, hatred, anger, greed and lust; and who, to accomplish all this, do no lustful actions, do no harm to anyone, do no backbiting, do not seek material possessions or power, who accept no homage, neither covet honor nor shun disgrace, and fear no one and nothing; by those who rely wholly and solely on God, and who love God purely for the sake of loving; who believe in the lovers of God and in the reality of Manifestation, and yet do not expect any spiritual or material reward; who do not let go the hand of Truth, and who, without being upset by calamities, bravely and wholeheartedly face all hardships with one hundred percent cheerfulness, and give no importance to caste, creed and religious ceremonies. This New Life will live by itself eternally, even if there is no one to live it.\nMeher Baba ended the New Life in February 1952 and once again began a round of public appearances throughout India and the West.\n1950\u20131959: \"God Speaks\" and automobile accidents.\nAfter being injured as a passenger in two serious automobile accidents, one near Prague, Oklahoma in the United States in 1952, and one in India in 1956, Meher Baba's ability to walk became limited.\nIn the 1950s, Baba established two centers outside of India, namely the Meher Spiritual Center in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina in the United States and Avatar's Abode near Brisbane, Australia. He inaugurated the Meher Spiritual Center in April 1952. On 24 May 1952, en route from the Meher Spiritual Center to Meher Mount in Ojai, California, the car in which he was a passenger was struck head-on near Prague, Oklahoma. He and his companions were thrown from the vehicle and injured. Baba's leg was severely broken and he sustained facial injuries including a broken nose. The injured were treated at Prague Memorial Hospital, after which they returned to Myrtle Beach to recuperate. While recuperating at Youpon Dunes, a home owned by Elizabeth Patterson, he worked on the charter for a group of Sufis, which he named Sufism Reoriented.\nIn August 1953, in Dehradun, Meher Baba began dictating his major book, \"God Speaks, The Theme of Creation and Its Purpose\". He dedicated this book \"To the Universe\u200a\u2014\u200athe Illusion that sustains Reality\". In September 1954, Meher Baba gave a men-only sahavas at Meherabad that later became known as the Three Incredible Weeks. During this time Baba issued a declaration, \"Meher Baba's Call\", wherein he once again affirmed his Avatarhood \"irrespective of the doubts and convictions\" of others. At the end of this sahavas, Meher Baba gave the completed manuscript of his book \"God Speaks\" to two members of Sufism Reoriented, Ludwig H. Dimpfl and Don E. Stevens, for editing and publication in America. The book was published by Dodd, Mead and Company the following year.\nOn 30 September 1954, Meher Baba gave his Final Declaration message.\nIn October 1954, Meher Baba discarded his alphabet board and began using a unique set of hand gestures to communicate, which he used for the rest of his life.\nOn 2 December 1956, outside Satara, India, the car in which Meher Baba was riding lost control and a second serious automobile accident occurred. Baba suffered a fractured pelvis and other severe injuries. Nilu, one of Baba's mandali, was killed. This collision seriously incapacitated Baba. Despite his physicians' predictions, Baba began to walk again, but from that point was in constant pain and had limited mobility. During his trip to the West in 1958, he often needed to be carried from venue to venue.\nIn 1956, during his fifth visit to the United States, Baba stayed at New York's Hotel Delmonico before traveling to the Meher Spiritual Center at Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. In July he traveled to Washington, D.C., and received friends and disciples at the home of Ivy Duce, wife of James Terry Duce, the vice-president of the Arabian American Oil Company. He then traveled to Meher Mount at Ojai, California before proceeding to Australia. His final visits to the United States and Australia were made in 1958.\n1960\u20131969: Final years and death.\nIn 1962, Baba held one of his last public functions, a mass meeting in India called the East-West Gathering. At these meetings, at which his Western followers were invited to meet his Indian disciples, Baba gave darshan to many thousands, despite the physical strain this caused him. Despite deteriorating health, he continued what he called his \"Universal Work\", which included fasting and seclusion, until his death on 31 January 1969. His \"samadhi\" in Meherabad, India, has become a place of international pilgrimage. In the mid-1960s Baba became concerned with the drug culture in the West and began correspondences with several Western academics, including Timothy Leary and Richard Alpert, in which he discouraged the use of hallucinogenic drugs for spiritual purposes. In 1966, Baba's responses to questions on drugs were published in a pamphlet titled \"God in a Pill?\" Meher Baba stated that drug use was spiritually damaging and that if enlightenment were possible through drugs then \"God is not worthy of being God\". Meher Baba instructed his young Western disciples to spread this message; in doing so, they increased awareness of Meher Baba's teachings. In an interview with Frederick Chapman, a Harvard graduate and Fulbright scholar who met Meher Baba during a year of study in India, Baba described LSD as \"harmful physically, mentally, and spiritually\" and warned that \"[its continued use] leads to madness or death\". Baba lovers in the United States, Europe, and Australia initiated an anti-drug campaign during this period. Though some contend that this campaign was mostly futile, it attracted new followers to Meher Baba. Furthermore, some of Baba's views entered into academic debate on the merits and dangers of hallucinogens.\nFrom the East-West Gathering of 1962 onward, Meher Baba's health deteriorated. Despite the physical toll it took on his body, he continued to undergo periods of seclusion and fasting. In late July 1968, Baba stated that he had completed a particularly taxing period of seclusion and noted that his work was \"completed 100% to my satisfaction\". He was by then using a wheelchair. Within a few months, his condition had worsened and he was bedridden, wracked by muscle spasms without clear medical origin. Despite the care of several physicians, the spasms worsened. On 31 January 1969, at 12:15p.m., he died after a violent spasm wracked his body. He conveyed by his last gestures, \"Do not forget that I am God.\" In time, his devotees called the anniversary of his death \"Amartithi\" (deathless day). Meher Baba's body was placed at his samadhi at Meherabad, covered with roses and cooled by ice. His body was kept available to the public for one week before its final burial. Prior to his death, Meher Baba had made extensive preparations for a public darshan program to be held in Pune. His mandali decided to proceed with the arrangements despite the absence of the host. Several thousand attended this \"Last Darshan\", including many hundreds from the United States, Europe, and Australia.\nSilence.\nFrom 10 July 1925, until his death in 1969, Meher Baba was silent. He communicated first by using an alphabet board and later by unique hand gestures which were interpreted and spoken out by one of his mandali, often Eruch Jessawala. Meher Baba said that his silence was not undertaken as a spiritual exercise but solely in connection with his universal work.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Man's inability to live God's words makes the Avatar's teaching a mockery. Instead of practicing the compassion he taught, man has waged wars in his name. Instead of living the humility, purity, and truth of his words, man has given way to hatred, greed, and violence. Because man has been deaf to the principles and precepts laid down by God in the past, in this present Avataric form, I observe silence.\nMeher Baba often signaled the moment \"that he would 'break' his silence by speaking the 'Word' in every heart, thereby giving a spiritual push forward to all living things\".\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;When I break My Silence, the impact of My Love will be universal and all life in creation will know, feel and receive of it. It will help every individual to break himself free from his own bondage in his own way. I am the Divine Beloved who loves you more than you can ever love yourself. The breaking of My Silence will help you to help yourself in knowing your real Self.\nMeher Baba asserted that the breaking of his silence would be a defining event in the spiritual evolution of the world.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nOn many occasions Meher Baba promised to break his silence with an audible word before he died, often stating a specific time and place when this would occur, but according to all contemporary accounts, Meher Baba remained silent until his death. His failure to break his silence disappointed some of his followers, while others viewed it as a test of their faith. Some of his followers speculate that \"the Word\" will yet be \"spoken\" or that Meher Baba broke his silence in a spiritual rather than a physical way.\nFor many years Meher Baba asked his followers to undertake austerities on 10 July, the anniversary of the day his silence began, such as keeping silence, fasting, and praying. In his final Silence Day request to his followers in 1968, he asked only that they keep silent. Many followers continue to celebrate Silence Day by keeping silence in his honor.\nTeachings.\nMeher Baba's teachings can be divided into two interrelated categories: his metaphysics on the nature of the soul and the universe, and practical advice for the spiritual aspirant. His metaphysics is mostly found in his principal book on the subject, \"God Speaks\". It contains detailed statements on his cosmology, the purpose of life, and the progression of the soul. His teachings on the practical spiritual life are mostly contained in the \"Discourses\", although it also covers many metaphysical areas mirroring or amplifying \"God Speaks\".\n\"God Speaks\".\n\"God Speaks\" describes the journey of the soul from its original state of unconscious divinity to the ultimate attainment of conscious divinity. The whole journey is a journey of imagination, in which the original indivisible state of God imagines becoming countless individualised souls which he likens to bubbles within an infinite ocean. Each soul, powered by the desire to become conscious, starts its journey in the most rudimentary form of consciousness. This limitation brings the need of a more developed form to advance it towards an increasingly conscious state. Consciousness grows in relation to the impressions each form is capable of gathering.\nAccording to Meher Baba, each soul pursues conscious divinity by evolving; that is, experiencing itself in a succession of imagined forms through seven \"kingdoms\" of stone/metal, vegetable, worm, fish, bird, animal, and human. The soul identifies itself with each successive form, becoming thus tied to illusion. During this evolution of forms, the power of thought increases, until in human form thought becomes infinite. Although in human form, the soul is capable of conscious divinity, all the impressions that it has gathered during evolution are illusory ones that create a barrier against the soul knowing itself. For this barrier to be overcome, further births in human form are needed in a process known as reincarnation.\nThe soul will reach a stage where its previously gathered impressions grow thin or weak enough that it enters a final stage called involution. This stage also requires a series of human births, during which the soul begins an inner journey, by which it realises its true identity as God. Baba breaks this inner journey into seven stages he called \"planes\". The process culminates, at the seventh plane, with God-realisation, at which the goal of life for the soul is reached.\n\"Discourses\".\nThe \"Discourses\" are a collection of explanations that Meher Baba has given on topics that concern the advancement of the spiritual aspirant. These topics include: sanskaras (mental impressions), Maya (the principle of illusion), the nature of the ego, reincarnation, karma, violence and non-violence, meditation, love, discipleship, and God-realisation. His explanations often include stories from the lore of India and the Sufi culture. One such story, the wise man and the ghost, shows the power that superstitious beliefs can have on a person, while another, Majnun and Layla, shows how selfless love, even in human relations, can lead one to discipleship.\nMeher Baba's suggestions include putting theory into practice, internally renouncing desires, offering selfless service to humanity or the master, spontaneity, and avoiding actions that bind one to illusion. Rather than lay out moral rules, Baba explains why some actions bind the individual whereas others aid emancipation. Several chapters discuss the mechanisms by which consciousness gets caught up between the opposites of experience, such as pleasure and pain, good and evil, and suggest how to transcend these opposites.\nPerfect Masters and the Avatar.\nMeher Baba related that there are 56 incarnate God-realised souls on Earth at any given time. Of these souls there are always five who constitute the five Perfect Masters of their era. When one of the five Perfect Masters dies, another God-realised soul immediately replaces him or her.\nThe Avatar, according to Baba, is a special Perfect Master, the first soul to achieve God-realisation. This soul, the original Perfect Master, or Ancient One, never ceases to incarnate. Baba indicated that this soul personifies the state of God called Vishnu in Hinduism and Parvardigar in Sufism, i.e. the sustainer or preserver state of God. Baba taught that the Avatar appears on Earth every 700\u20131400 years and is \"brought down\" into human form by the five Perfect Masters of the time to aid creation in the endless process of moving toward Godhood. Baba claimed that in other ages this role had been fulfilled by Zoroaster, Rama, Krishna, Buddha, Jesus, and Muhammad.\nBaba described the Avatar as \"a gauge against which man can measure what he is and what he may become. He trues the standard of human values by interpreting them in terms of divinely human life.\"\nMost of Meher Baba's followers accept his claim of avatarhood, and he is said to be \"revered by millions around the world as the Avatar of the age and a God-realized being\".\nLegacy.\nMeher Baba's travels and teachings left a legacy of followers and devotees worldwide.\nThe Avatar Meher Baba Charitable Trust, established by Meher Baba in 1959, maintains his tomb and pilgrimage facilities, as well as a free school and dispensary, a cataract clinic, and a veterinary clinic. The Trust follows the charter Meher Baba left for it, but does not act as spiritual authority over groups. Likewise, the Trust does not engage in propaganda, promote creeds or dogmas, or seek converts. Baba discouraged evangelizing, stating, \"I need no propaganda or publicity.\" Rather, he encouraged his followers to \"let your life itself be my message of love and truth to others\" and to \"spread my message of Love and Truth as far and wide as possible\". Though some followers of Meher Baba have no established rituals, others perform practices such as pujas, aartis, prayers, music, plays, and viewing films of Baba. The primary focus for many followers is living as Meher Baba would approve, such as by abstaining from marijuana and psychedelic drugs, and trying to remember God with love.\nGatherings of Baba followers are generally informal. Special effort is made to gather together on Amartithi, the anniversary of Baba's death, and on his birthday. Many Baba followers keep silent on 10 July (Silence Day), observing the request Baba frequently made of his followers during his lifetime. Aarti is performed morning and evening at Baba's samadhi in India. At Meherabad, his followers maintain Baba's practice of lighting a dhuni fire on the 12th of each month.\nIn popular culture.\nMeher Baba had gained public attention in the West as early as 1932, due to contacts with celebrities of the time, and from the rather disillusioned account of Paul Brunton in his \"A Search in Secret India\" (1934). Baba received further attention posthumously via various mentions in Western pop-culture.\nFor example, Pete Townshend of the Who became a follower of Baba and dedicated his 1969 rock opera \"Tommy\" to him in the gatefold. The Who's 1971 song \"Baba O'Riley\" was named in part after Meher Baba, and Townshend recorded several Meher Baba tribute albums and music videos including \"Happy Birthday\", \"I Am\", \"Who Came First\", \"With Love\", and \"You Alone Exist\".\nIn 1969, Indian filmmaker Jagat Murari co-produced the ethnographic film on Meher Baba titled \"The Awakener\". The 35-millimeter, 118 minute found footage film was distributed by Films Division of India.\nIn 1970, Melanie Safka (stage name \"Melanie\") mentioned Baba in the spoken word intro to her song \"Lay Down (Candles in the Rain)\". Listed as a standalone piece entitled \"Candles in the Rain\", the lyrics are \"Meher Baba lives again\". Bobby McFerrin's 1988 Grammy Award\u2013winning song \"Don't Worry, Be Happy\" was inspired by Baba's adage, which has appeared on many posters and inspirational cards depicting him.\nVarious Indian films produced by Edida Nageswara Rao have depicted Meher Baba's images. Works such as \"Swathi Kiranam\" (1992) were exclusively filmed at the Meher Baba center in Tapeswaram, Andhra Pradesh, depicting life size images of Meher Baba.\nElements of Meher Baba's philosophy, as well as an unnamed character based upon him, have appeared in the works of comic book writer and screenwriter J. M. DeMatteis. Works particularly influenced by Baba include DeMatteis' scripts for \"Doctor Fate\" and DeMatteis creator-owned comic book \"Seekers into the Mystery\". \"The Theme of Creation\" (2005) was an American documentary film produced, written, edited and directed by Tim Thelen. Nagendra Babu played young Meher Baba in the 2009 film Jagadguru Sri Shiridi Saibaba. \nIn 2012, the feature film \"Nema Aviona za Zagreb\" premiered in the Netherlands with an exclusive interview with Meher Baba filmed in 1967. In the interview, Baba explains the difference between God-realisation and drug-induced hallucinations and the scene plays a pivotal role in the documentary's narrative.\n\"The Visa \u2013 A Meher Baba\" film was produced by Sufism Reoriented's American Young Adult Sahavas team in 2018, and stars followers of Meher Baba such as Natasha K. Mehta. Meher Filmworks produces and archives remastered film footage of Meher Baba.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "20861", "revid": "7611264", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20861", "title": "Cavity magnetron", "text": "Device for generating microwaves\nThe cavity magnetron is a high-power vacuum tube used in early radar systems and subsequently in microwave ovens and in linear particle accelerators. A cavity magnetron generates microwaves using the interaction of a stream of electrons with a magnetic field, while moving past a series of cavity resonators, which are small, open cavities in a metal block. Electrons pass by the cavities and cause microwaves to oscillate within, similar to the functioning of a whistle producing a tone when excited by an air stream blown past its opening. The resonant frequency of the arrangement is determined by the cavities' physical dimensions. Unlike other vacuum tubes, such as a klystron or a traveling-wave tube (TWT), the magnetron cannot function as an amplifier for increasing the intensity of an applied microwave signal; the magnetron serves solely as an electronic oscillator generating a microwave signal from direct-current electricity supplied to the vacuum tube.\nThe use of magnetic fields as a means to control the flow of an electric current was spurred by the invention of the Audion by Lee de Forest in 1906. Albert Hull of General Electric Research Laboratory, USA, began development of magnetrons to avoid de Forest's patents, but these were never completely successful. Other experimenters picked up on Hull's work and a key advance, the use of two cathodes, was introduced by Habann in Germany in 1924. Further research was limited until Okabe's 1929 Japanese paper noting the production of centimeter-wavelength signals, which led to worldwide interest. The development of magnetrons with multiple cathodes was proposed by A. L. Samuel of Bell Telephone Laboratories in 1934, leading to designs by Postumus in 1934 and Hans Hollmann in 1935. Production was taken up by Philips, General Electric Company (GEC), Telefunken and others, limited to perhaps 10\u00a0W output. By this time the klystron was producing more power and the magnetron was not widely used, although a 300\u00a0W device was built by Aleksereff and Malearoff in the USSR in 1936 (published in 1940).\nThe \"cavity\" magnetron was a radical improvement introduced by John Randall and Harry Boot at the University of Birmingham, England in 1940. Their first working example produced hundreds of watts at 10\u00a0cm wavelength, an unprecedented achievement. Within weeks, engineers at GEC had improved this to well over a kilowatt (kW), and within months 25\u00a0kW, over 100\u00a0kW by 1941 and pushing towards a megawatt by 1943. The high power pulses were generated from a device the size of a small book and transmitted from an antenna only centimeters long, reducing the size of practical radar systems by orders of magnitude. New radars appeared for night-fighters, anti-submarine aircraft and even the smallest escort ships, and from that point on the Allies of World War II held a lead in radar that their counterparts in Germany and Japan were never able to close. By the end of the war, practically every Allied radar was based on the magnetron.\nThe magnetron continued to be used in radar in the post-war period but fell from favour in the 1960s as high-power klystrons and traveling-wave tubes emerged. A key characteristic of the magnetron is that its output signal changes from pulse to pulse, both in frequency and phase. This renders it less suitable for pulse-to-pulse comparisons for performing moving target indication and removing \"clutter\" from the radar display. The magnetron remains in use in some radar systems, but has become much more common as a low-cost source for microwave ovens. In this form, over one billion magnetrons are in use.\nConstruction and operation.\nConventional tube design.\nIn a conventional electron tube (vacuum tube), electrons are emitted from a negatively charged, heated component called the cathode and are attracted to a positively charged component called the anode. The components are normally arranged concentrically, placed within a tubular-shaped container from which all air has been evacuated, so that the electrons can move freely (hence the name \"vacuum\" tubes, called \"valves\" in British English).\nIf a third electrode (called a control grid) is inserted between the cathode and the anode, the flow of electrons between the cathode and anode can be regulated by varying the voltage on this third electrode. This allows the resulting electron tube (called a \"triode\" because it now has three electrodes) to function as an amplifier because small variations in the electric charge applied to the control grid will result in identical variations in the much larger current of electrons flowing between the cathode and anode.\nHull or single-anode magnetron.\nThe idea of using a grid for control was invented by Philipp Lenard, who received the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1905. In the USA it was later patented by Lee de Forest, resulting in considerable research into alternate tube designs that would avoid his patents. One concept used a magnetic field instead of an electrical charge to control current flow, leading to the development of the magnetron tube. In this design, the tube was made with two electrodes, typically with the cathode in the form of a metal rod in the center, and the anode as a cylinder around it. The tube was placed between the poles of a horseshoe magnet arranged such that the magnetic field was aligned parallel to the axis of the electrodes.\nWith no magnetic field present, the tube operates as a diode, with electrons flowing directly from the cathode to the anode. In the presence of the magnetic field, the electrons will experience a force at right angles to their direction of motion (the Lorentz force). In this case, the electrons follow a curved path between the cathode and anode. The curvature of the path can be controlled by varying either the magnetic field using an electromagnet, or by changing the electrical potential between the electrodes.\nAt very high magnetic field settings the electrons are forced back onto the cathode, preventing current flow. At the opposite extreme, with no field, the electrons are free to flow straight from the cathode to the anode. There is a point between the two extremes, the critical value or Hull cut-off magnetic field (and cut-off voltage), where the electrons just reach the anode. At fields around this point, the device operates similar to a triode. However, magnetic control, due to hysteresis and other effects, results in a slower and less faithful response to control current than electrostatic control using a control grid in a conventional triode (not to mention greater weight and complexity), so magnetrons saw limited use in conventional electronic designs.\nIt was noticed that when the magnetron was operating at the critical value, it would emit energy in the radio frequency spectrum. This occurs because a few of the electrons, instead of reaching the anode, continue to circle in the space between the cathode and the anode. Due to an effect now known as cyclotron radiation, these electrons radiate radio frequency energy. The effect is not very efficient. Eventually the electrons hit one of the electrodes, so the number in the circulating state at any given time is a small percentage of the overall current. It was also noticed that the frequency of the radiation depends on the size of the tube, and even early examples were built that produced signals in the microwave regime.\nEarly conventional tube systems were limited to the high frequency bands, and although very high frequency systems became widely available in the late 1930s, the ultra high frequency and microwave bands were well beyond the ability of conventional circuits. The magnetron was one of the few devices able to generate signals in the microwave band and it was the only one that was able to produce high power at centimeter wavelengths.\nSplit-anode magnetron.\nThe original magnetron was very difficult to keep operating at the critical value, and even then the number of electrons in the circling state at any time was fairly low. This meant that it produced very low-power signals. Nevertheless, as one of the few devices known to create microwaves, interest in the device and potential improvements was widespread.\nThe first major improvement was the split-anode magnetron, also known as a negative-resistance magnetron. As the name implies, this design used an anode that was split in two\u2014one at each end of the tube\u2014creating two half-cylinders. When both were charged to the same voltage the system worked like the original model. But by slightly altering the voltage of the two plates, the electrons' trajectory could be modified so that they would naturally travel towards the higher voltage side. The plates were connected to an oscillator that reversed the relative voltage of the two plates at a given frequency.\nAt any given instant, the electron will naturally be pushed towards the higher-voltage side of the tube. The electron will then oscillate back and forth as the voltage changes. At the same time, a strong magnetic field is applied, stronger than the critical value in the original design. This would normally cause the electron to circle back to the cathode, but due to the oscillating electrical field, the electron instead follows a looping path that continues toward the anodes.\nSince all of the electrons in the flow experienced this looping motion, the amount of RF energy being radiated was greatly improved. And as the motion occurred at any field level beyond the critical value, it was no longer necessary to carefully tune the fields and voltages, and the overall stability of the device was greatly improved. Unfortunately, the higher field also meant that electrons often circled back to the cathode, depositing their energy on it and causing it to heat up. As this normally causes more electrons to be released, it could sometimes lead to a runaway effect, damaging the device.\nCavity magnetron.\nThe great advance in magnetron design was the resonant cavity magnetron or electron-resonance magnetron, which works on entirely different principles. In this design the oscillation is created by the physical shape of the anode, rather than external circuits or fields.\nMechanically, the cavity magnetron consists of a large, solid cylinder of metal with a hole drilled through the centre of the circular face. A wire acting as the cathode is run down the center of this hole, and the metal block itself forms the anode. Around this hole, known as the \"interaction space\", are a number of similar holes (\"resonators\") drilled parallel to the interaction space, connected to the interaction space by a short channel. The resulting block looks something like the cylinder on a revolver, with a somewhat larger central hole. Early models were cut using Colt pistol jigs. Remembering that in an AC circuit the electrons travel along the surface, not the core, of the conductor, the parallel sides of the slot act as a capacitor while the round holes form an inductor: an LC circuit made of solid copper, with the resonant frequency defined entirely by its dimensions.\nThe magnetic field is set to a value well below the critical, so the electrons follow curved paths towards the anode. When they strike the anode, they cause it to become negatively charged in that region. As this process is random, some areas will become more or less charged than the areas around them. The anode is constructed of a highly conductive material, almost always copper, so these differences in voltage cause currents to appear to even them out. Since the current has to flow around the outside of the cavity, this process takes time. During that time additional electrons will avoid the hot spots and be deposited further along the anode, as the additional current flowing around it arrives too. This causes an oscillating current to form as the current tries to equalize one spot, then another.\nThe oscillating currents flowing around the cavities, and their effect on the electron flow within the tube, cause large amounts of microwave radiofrequency energy to be generated in the cavities. The cavities are open on one end, so the entire mechanism forms a single, larger, microwave oscillator. A \"tap\", normally a wire formed into a loop, extracts microwave energy from one of the cavities. In some systems the tap wire is replaced by an open hole, which allows the microwaves to flow into a waveguide.\nAs the oscillation takes some time to set up, and is inherently random at the start, subsequent startups will have different output parameters. Phase is almost never preserved, which makes the magnetron difficult to use in phased array systems. Frequency also drifts from pulse to pulse, a more difficult problem for a wider array of radar systems. Neither of these present a problem for continuous-wave radars, nor for microwave ovens.\nCommon features.\nAll cavity magnetrons consist of a heated cylindrical cathode at a high (continuous or pulsed) negative potential created by a high-voltage, direct-current power supply. The cathode is placed in the center of an evacuated, lobed, circular metal chamber. The walls of the chamber are the anode of the tube. A magnetic field parallel to the axis of the cavity is imposed by a permanent magnet. The electrons initially move radially outward from the cathode attracted by the electric field of the anode walls. The magnetic field causes the electrons to spiral outward in a circular path, a consequence of the Lorentz force. Spaced around the rim of the chamber are cylindrical cavities. Slots are cut along the length of the cavities that open into the central, common cavity space. As electrons sweep past these slots, they induce a high-frequency radio field in each resonant cavity, which in turn causes the electrons to bunch into groups. A portion of the radio frequency energy is extracted by a short coupling loop that is connected to a waveguide (a metal tube, usually of rectangular cross section). The waveguide directs the extracted RF energy to the load, which may be a cooking chamber in a microwave oven or a high-gain antenna in the case of radar.\nThe size of the cavities determine the resonant frequency, and thereby the frequency of the emitted microwaves. However, the frequency is not precisely controllable. The operating frequency varies with changes in load impedance, with changes in the supply current, and with the temperature of the tube. This is not a problem in uses such as heating, or in some forms of radar where the receiver can be synchronized with an imprecise magnetron frequency. Where precise frequencies are needed, other devices, such as the klystron, are used.\nThe magnetron is a self-oscillating device requiring no external elements other than a power supply. A well-defined threshold anode voltage must be applied before oscillation will build up; this voltage is a function of the dimensions of the resonant cavity, and the applied magnetic field. In pulsed applications there is a delay of several cycles before the oscillator achieves full peak power, and the build-up of anode voltage must be coordinated with the build-up of oscillator output.\nWhere there are an even number of cavities, two concentric rings can connect alternate cavity walls to prevent inefficient modes of oscillation. This is called pi-strapping because the two straps lock the phase difference between adjacent cavities at \u03c0 radians (180\u00b0).\nThe modern magnetron is a fairly efficient device. In a microwave oven, for instance, a 1.1-kilowatt input will generally create about 700 watts of microwave power, an efficiency of around 65%. (The high-voltage and the properties of the cathode determine the power of a magnetron.) Large S band magnetrons can produce up to 2.5 megawatts peak power with an average power of 3.75\u00a0kW. Some large magnetrons are water cooled. The magnetron remains in widespread use in roles which require high power, but where precise control over frequency and phase is unimportant.\nApplications.\nRadar.\nIn a radar set, the magnetron's waveguide is connected to an antenna. The magnetron is operated with very short pulses of applied voltage, resulting in a short pulse of high-power microwave energy being radiated. As in all primary radar systems, the radiation reflected from a target is analyzed to produce a radar map on a screen.\nSeveral characteristics of the magnetron's output make radar use of the device somewhat problematic. The first of these factors is the magnetron's inherent instability in its transmitter frequency. This instability results not only in frequency shifts from one pulse to the next, but also a frequency shift within an individual transmitted pulse. The second factor is that the energy of the transmitted pulse is spread over a relatively wide frequency spectrum, which requires the receiver to have a correspondingly wide bandwidth. This wide bandwidth allows ambient electrical noise to be accepted into the receiver, thus obscuring somewhat the weak radar echoes, thereby reducing overall receiver signal-to-noise ratio and thus performance. The third factor, depending on application, is the radiation hazard caused by the use of high-power electromagnetic radiation. In some applications, for example, a marine radar mounted on a recreational vessel, a radar with a magnetron output of 2 to 4 kilowatts is often found mounted very near an area occupied by crew or passengers. In practical use these factors have been overcome, or merely accepted, and there are thousands of magnetron aviation and marine radar units in service. Recent advances in aviation weather-avoidance radar and in marine radar have successfully replaced the magnetron with microwave semiconductor oscillators, which have a narrower output frequency range. These allow a narrower receiver bandwidth to be used, and the higher signal-to-noise ratio in turn allows a lower transmitter power, reducing exposure to EMR.\nHeating.\nIn microwave ovens, the waveguide leads to a radio-frequency-transparent port into the cooking chamber. As the fixed dimensions of the chamber and its physical closeness to the magnetron would normally create standing wave patterns in the chamber, the pattern is randomized by a motorized fan-like \"mode stirrer\" in the waveguide (more often in commercial ovens), or by a turntable that rotates the food (most common in consumer ovens).\nAn early example of this application was when British scientists in 1954 used a microwave oven to resurrect cryogenically frozen hamsters.\nLighting.\nIn microwave-excited lighting systems, such as a sulfur lamp, a magnetron provides the microwave field that is passed through a waveguide to the lighting cavity containing the light-emitting substance (e.g., sulfur, metal halides, etc.). Although efficient, these lamps are much more complex than other methods of lighting and therefore not commonly used.\nMore modern variants use HEMTs or GaN-on-SiC power semiconductor devices instead of magnetrons to generate the microwaves, which are substantially less complex and can be adjusted to maximize light output using a PID controller.\nHistory.\nIn 1910, Hans Gerdien (1877\u20131951) of the Siemens Corporation invented a magnetron. In 1912, Swiss physicist Heinrich Greinacher was looking for new ways to calculate the electron mass. He settled on a system consisting of a diode with a cylindrical anode surrounding a rod-shaped cathode, placed in the middle of a magnet. The attempt to measure the electron mass failed because he was unable to achieve a good vacuum in the tube. However, as part of this work, Greinacher developed mathematical models of the motion of the electrons in the crossed magnetic and electric fields.\nIn the US, Albert Hull put this work to use in an attempt to bypass Western Electric's patents on the triode. Western Electric had gained control of this design by buying Lee De Forest's patents on the control of current flow using electric fields via the \"grid\". Hull intended to use a variable magnetic field, instead of an electrostatic one, to control the flow of the electrons from the cathode to the anode. Working at General Electric's Research Laboratories in Schenectady, New York, Hull built tubes that provided switching through the control of the ratio of the magnetic and electric field strengths. He released several papers and patents on the concept in 1921.\nHull's magnetron was not originally intended to generate VHF (very-high-frequency) electromagnetic waves. However, in 1924, Czech physicist August \u017d\u00e1\u010dek (1886\u20131961) and German physicist Erich Habann (1892\u20131968) independently discovered that the magnetron could generate waves of 100 megahertz to 1 gigahertz. \u017d\u00e1\u010dek, a professor at Prague's Charles University, published first; however, he published in a journal with a small circulation and thus attracted little attention. Habann, a student at the University of Jena, investigated the magnetron for his doctoral dissertation of 1924. Throughout the 1920s, Hull and other researchers around the world worked to develop the magnetron. Most of these early magnetrons were glass vacuum tubes with multiple anodes. However, the two-pole magnetron, also known as a split-anode magnetron, had relatively low efficiency.\nWhile radar was being developed during World War II, there arose an urgent need for a high-power microwave generator that worked at shorter wavelengths, around 10\u00a0cm (3\u00a0GHz), rather than the 50 to 150\u00a0cm (200\u00a0MHz) that was available from tube-based generators of the time. It was known that a multi-cavity resonant magnetron had been developed and patented in 1935 by Hans Hollmann in Berlin. However, the German military considered the frequency drift of Hollman's device to be undesirable, and based their radar systems on the klystron instead. But klystrons could not at that time achieve the high power output that magnetrons eventually reached. This was one reason that German night fighter radars, which never strayed beyond the low-UHF band to start with for front-line aircraft, were not a match for their British counterparts. Likewise, in the UK, Albert Beaumont Wood proposed in 1937 a system with \"six or eight small holes\" drilled in a metal block, differing from the later production designs only in the aspects of vacuum sealing. However, his idea was rejected by the Navy, who said their valve department was far too busy to consider it.\nIn 1940, at the University of Birmingham in the UK, John Randall and Harry Boot produced a working prototype of a cavity magnetron that produced about 400\u00a0W. Within a week this had improved to 1\u00a0kW, and within the next few months, with the addition of water cooling and many detail changes, this had improved to 10 and then 25\u00a0kW. To deal with its drifting frequency, they sampled the output signal and synchronized their receiver to whatever frequency was actually being generated. In 1941, the problem of frequency instability was solved by James Sayers coupling (\"strapping\") alternate cavities within the magnetron, which reduced the instability by a factor of 5\u20136. (For an overview of early magnetron designs, including that of Boot and Randall, see .) \nGEC at Wembley made 12 prototype cavity magnetrons in August 1940, and No 12 was sent to America with Bowen on the Tizard Mission, where it was shown on 19 September 1940 in Alfred Loomis\u2019 apartment. The American NDRC Microwave Committee was stunned at the power level produced. However Bell Labs' director was upset when it was X-rayed and had eight holes rather than the six holes shown on the GEC plans. After contacting (via the transatlantic cable) Dr Eric Megaw, GEC\u2019s vacuum tube expert Megaw recalled that when he had asked for 12 prototypes he said make 10 with 6 holes, one with 7 and one with 8; there was no time to amend the drawings. And No 12 with 8 holes was chosen for the Tizard Mission. So Bell Labs chose to copy the sample; and while early British magnetrons had six cavities the American ones had eight cavities. \nAccording to Andy Manning from the RAF Air Defence Radar Museum, Randall and Boot's discovery was \"a massive, massive breakthrough\" and \"deemed by many, even now [2007], to be the most important invention that came out of the Second World War\", while professor of military history at the University of Victoria in British Columbia, David Zimmerman, states:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The magnetron remains the essential radio tube for shortwave radio signals of all types. It not only changed the course of the war by allowing us to develop airborne radar systems, it remains the key piece of technology that lies at the heart of your microwave oven today. The cavity magnetron's invention changed the world.\nBecause France had just fallen to the Nazis and Britain had no money to develop the magnetron on a massive scale, Winston Churchill agreed that Sir Henry Tizard should offer the magnetron to the Americans in exchange for their financial and industrial help. An early 10\u00a0kW version, built in England by the General Electric Company Research Laboratories in Wembley, London, was taken on the Tizard Mission in September 1940. As the discussion turned to radar, the US Navy representatives began to detail the problems with their short-wavelength systems, complaining that their klystrons could only produce 10\u00a0W. With a flourish, \"Taffy\" Bowen pulled out a magnetron and explained it produced 1000 times that.\nBell Telephone Laboratories took the example and quickly began making copies, and before the end of 1940, the Radiation Laboratory had been set up on the campus of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to develop various types of radar using the magnetron. By early 1941, portable centimetric airborne radars were being tested in American and British aircraft. In late 1941, the Telecommunications Research Establishment in the United Kingdom used the magnetron to develop a revolutionary airborne, ground-mapping radar codenamed H2S. The H2S radar was in part developed by Alan Blumlein and Bernard Lovell.\nThe cavity magnetron was widely used during World War II in microwave radar equipment and is often credited with giving Allied radar a considerable performance advantage over German and Japanese radars, thus directly influencing the outcome of the war. It was later described by American historian James Phinney Baxter III as \"[t]he most valuable cargo ever brought to our shores\".\nCentimetric radar, made possible by the cavity magnetron, allowed for the detection of much smaller objects and the use of much smaller antennas. The combination of small-cavity magnetrons, small antennas, and high resolution allowed small, high quality radars to be installed in aircraft. They could be used by maritime patrol aircraft to detect objects as small as a submarine periscope, which allowed aircraft to attack and destroy submerged submarines which had previously been undetectable from the air. Centimetric contour mapping radars like H2S improved the accuracy of Allied bombers used in the strategic bombing campaign, despite the existence of the German FuG 350 \"Naxos\" device to specifically detect it. Centimetric gun-laying radars were likewise far more accurate than the older technology. They made the big-gunned Allied battleships more deadly and, along with the newly developed proximity fuze, made anti-aircraft guns much more dangerous to attacking aircraft. The two coupled together and used by anti-aircraft batteries, placed along the flight path of German V-1 flying bombs on their way to London, are credited with destroying many of the flying bombs before they reached their target.\nSince then, many millions of cavity magnetrons have been manufactured; while some have been for radar the vast majority have been for microwave ovens. The use in radar itself has dwindled to some extent, as more accurate signals have generally been needed and developers have moved to klystron and traveling-wave tube systems for these needs.\nHealth hazards.\nAt least one hazard in particular is well known and documented. As the lens of the eye has no cooling blood flow, it is particularly prone to overheating when exposed to microwave radiation. This heating can in turn lead to a higher incidence of cataracts in later life.\nThere is also a considerable electrical hazard around magnetrons, as they require a high voltage power supply.\nContrary to popular belief, most consumer magnetrons use aluminium oxide (alumina) instead of the much more dangerous beryllium oxide for the insulators. Alumina is considerably cheaper for consumer magnetrons and if broken does not carry the same health risks of broken beryllium oxide. Some higher power magnetrons and very old microwave ovens do use beryllium oxide and, at least on modern magnetrons, it is typically labeled with a beryllium oxide warning.\nAnother hazard of a dismantled magnetron is the thorium mixed with tungsten in the filament. Exceptions to this are higher power magnetrons that operate above approximately 10,000 volts where positive ion bombardment becomes damaging to thorium metal, hence pure tungsten (potassium doped) is used. While thorium is a radioactive metal, an increased risk of cancer is unrealistic, as its radioactivity is very low, with a half-life on the order of billions of years. Only if the filament were taken out of the magnetron, finely crushed, and inhaled (which is unlikely) could it pose a health hazard.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Its defining features included a large, sometimes fortified manor house or castle in which the lord of the manor and his dependants lived and administered a rural estate, and a population of labourers or serfs who worked the surrounding land to support themselves and the lord. These labourers fulfilled their obligations with labour time or in-kind produce at first, and later by cash payment as commercial activity increased. Manorialism was part of the feudal system.\nManorialism originated in the Roman villa system of the Late Roman Empire, and was widely practised in medieval western Europe and parts of central Europe. An essential element of feudal society, manorialism was slowly replaced by the advent of a money-based market economy and new forms of agrarian contract.\nManorialism faded away slowly and piecemeal, along with its most vivid feature in the landscape, the open field system. It outlasted serfdom in the sense that it continued with freehold labourers. As an economic system, it outlasted feudalism, according to Andrew Jones, because \"it could maintain a warrior, but it could equally well maintain a capitalist landlord. It could be self-sufficient, yield produce for the market, or it could yield a money rent.\" The last feudal dues in France were abolished at the French Revolution. In parts of eastern Germany, the \"Rittergut\" manors of Junkers remained until World War II.\nHistorical and geographical distribution.\nThe term is most often used with reference to medieval Western Europe. Antecedents of the system can be traced to the rural economy of the later Roman Empire (Dominate). Labour was the key factor of production. Successive administrations tried to stabilise the imperial economy by freezing the social structure into place: sons were to succeed their fathers in their trading, councillors were forbidden to resign, and \"coloni\", the cultivators of land, were not to move from the land they were attached to. The workers of the land were on their way to becoming serfs.\nSeveral factors conspired to merge the status of former slaves and former free farmers into a dependent class of such \"coloni\": it was possible to be described as \"servus et colonus\", \"both slave and \"colonus\"\". The Laws of Constantine I around 325 both reinforced the semi-servile status of the \"coloni\" and limited their rights to sue in the courts; the \"Codex Theodosianus\" promulgated under Theodosius II extended these restrictions. The legal status of \"adscripti\", \"bound to the soil\", contrasted with barbarian \"foederati\", who were permitted to settle within the imperial boundaries, remaining subject to their own traditional law.\nAs the Germanic kingdoms succeeded Roman authority in the west in the fifth century, Roman landlords were often simply replaced by Germanic ones, with little change to the underlying situation or displacement of populations.\nThe process of rural self-sufficiency was given an abrupt boost in the eighth century, when normal trade in the Mediterranean Sea was disrupted.\nDescription.\nThe word derives from traditional inherited divisions of the countryside, reassigned as local jurisdictions known as manors or seigneuries; each manor being subject to a lord (French \"seigneur\"), usually holding his position in return for undertakings offered to a higher lord (see Feudalism). The lord held a manorial court, governed by public law and local custom. Not all territorial seigneurs were secular; bishops and abbots also held lands that entailed similar obligations.\nBy extension, the word \"manor\" is sometimes used in England as a slang term for any home area or territory in which authority is held, often in a police or criminal context.\nIn the generic plan of a medieval manor from \"Shepherd's Historical Atlas\", the strips of individually worked land in the open field system are immediately apparent. In this plan, the manor house is set slightly apart from the village, but equally often the village grew up around the forecourt of the manor, formerly walled, while the manor lands stretched away outside, as still may be seen at Petworth House. As concerns for privacy increased in the 18th century, manor houses were often located a farther distance from the village. For example, when a grand new house was required by the new owner of Harlaxton Manor, Lincolnshire, in the 1830s, the site of the existing manor house at the edge of its village was abandoned for a new one, isolated in its park, with the village out of view.\nIn an agrarian society, the conditions of land tenure underlie all social or economic factors. There were two legal systems of pre-manorial landholding. One, the most common, was the system of holding land \"allodially\" in full outright ownership. The other was a use of \"precaria\" or benefices, in which land was held conditionally (the root of the English word \"precarious\").\nTo these two systems, the Carolingian monarchs added a third, the \"aprisio\", which linked manorialism with feudalism. The \"aprisio\" made its first appearance in Charlemagne's province of Septimania in the south of France, when Charlemagne had to settle the Visigothic refugees who had fled with his retreating forces after the failure of his Zaragoza expedition of 778. He solved this problem by allotting \"desert\" tracts of uncultivated land belonging to the royal \"fisc\" under direct control of the emperor. These holdings \"aprisio\" entailed specific conditions. The earliest specific \"aprisio\" grant that has been identified was at Fontjoncouse, near Narbonne (see Lewis, links). In former Roman settlements, a system of villas, dating from Late Antiquity, was inherited by the medieval world.\nThe seigneur.\nThe possessor of a seigneurie bears the title of \"Lord\". He can be an individual, in the vast majority of cases a national of the nobility or of the Bourgeoisie, but also a judicial person most often an ecclesiastical institution such as an abbey, a cathedral or canonical chapter or a military order. The power of the lord was exercised through various intermediaries, the most important of which was the bailiff. The sovereign can also be a lord; the seigneuries he owns form the royal domain.\nThe title of lord is also granted, especially in modern times, to individuals holding noble fiefdoms which are not for all that seigneuries. These \"lords\" are sometimes called sieurs, equivalent terms in medieval times.\nThe land lordship.\nThe lord is the direct or prominent owner of the land assets of his lordship. The notion of absolute ownership over a common good cannot be applied, because there are also others than the main user who have rights over these goods. We distinguish in the land lordship two sets the reserves which is the set of goods of which the lord reserves the direct exploitation and tenant-in-chief, property whose exploitation is entrusted to a tenant against payment of a royalty, most often called cens and services such as Corv\u00e9e. The distribution between reserve and tenure varies depending on the period and region.\nCommon features.\nManors each consisted of up to three classes of land:\nAdditional sources of income for the lord included charges for use of his mill, bakery or wine-press, or for the right to hunt or to let pigs feed in his woodland, as well as court revenues and single payments on each change of tenant. On the other side of the account, manorial administration involved significant expenses, perhaps a reason why smaller manors tended to rely less on villein tenure.\nDependent holdings were held nominally by arrangement of lord and tenant, but tenure became in practice almost universally hereditary, with a payment made to the lord on each succession of another member of the family. Villein land could not be abandoned, at least until demographic and economic circumstances made flight a viable proposition; nor could they be passed to a third party without the lord's permission, and the customary payment.\nAlthough not free, villeins were by no means in the same position as slaves: they enjoyed legal rights, subject to local custom, and had recourse to the law subject to court charges, which were an additional source of manorial income. Sub-letting of villein holdings was common, and labour on the demesne might be commuted into an additional money payment, as happened increasingly from the 13th century.\nLand which was neither let to tenants nor formed part of demesne lands was known as \"manorial waste\"; typically, this included hedges, verges, etc. Common land where all members of the community had right of passage was known as \"lord's waste\". Part of the demesne land of the manor which being uncultivated was termed the Lord's Waste and served for public roads and for common pasture to the lord and his tenants. In many settlements during the early modern period, illegal building was carried out on lord's waste land by squatters who would then plead their case to remain with local support. An example of a lord's waste settlement, where the main centres grew up in this way, is the village of Bredfield in Suffolk. Lord's waste continues to be a source of rights and responsibilities issues in places such as Henley-in-Arden, Warwickshire.\nIn examining the origins of the monastic cloister, Walter Horn found that \"as a manorial entity the Carolingian monastery\u00a0... differed little from the fabric of a feudal estate, save that the corporate community of men for whose sustenance this organisation was maintained consisted of monks who served God in chant and spent much of their time in reading and writing.\"\nTenants.\nTenants owned land on the manor under one of several legal agreements: freehold, copyhold, customary freehold and leasehold.\nVariation among manors.\nLike feudalism which, together with manorialism, formed the legal and organisational framework of feudal society, manorial structures were not uniform or coordinated. In the later Middle Ages, areas of incomplete or non-existent manorialisation persisted while the manorial economy underwent substantial development with changing economic conditions.\nNot all manors contained all three classes of land. Typically, demesne accounted for roughly a third of the arable area, and villein holdings rather more; but some manors consisted solely of demesne, others solely of peasant holdings. The proportion of unfree and free tenures could likewise vary greatly, with more or less reliance on wage labour for agricultural work on the demesne.\nThe proportion of the cultivated area in demesne tended to be greater in smaller manors, while the share of villein land was greater in large manors, providing the lord of the latter with a larger supply of obligatory labour for demesne work. The proportion of free tenements was generally less variable, but tended to be somewhat greater on the smaller manors.\nManors varied similarly in their geographical arrangement: most did not coincide with a single village, but rather consisted of parts of two or more villages, most of the latter containing also parts of at least one other manor. This situation sometimes led to replacement by cash payments or their equivalents in kind of the demesne labour obligations of those peasants living furthest from the lord's estate.\nAs with peasant plots, the demesne was not a single territorial unit, but consisted rather of a central house with neighbouring land and estate buildings, plus strips dispersed through the manor alongside free and villein ones: in addition, the lord might lease free tenements belonging to neighbouring manors, as well as holding other manors some distance away to provide a greater range of produce.\nNor were manors held necessarily by lay lords rendering military service (or again, cash in lieu) to their superior: a substantial share (estimated by value at 17% in England in 1086) belonged directly to the king, and a greater proportion (rather more than a quarter) were held by bishoprics and monasteries. Ecclesiastical manors tended to be larger, with a significantly greater villein area than neighbouring lay manors.\nThe effect of circumstances on manorial economy is complex and at times contradictory: upland conditions tended to preserve peasant freedoms (livestock husbandry in particular being less labour-intensive and therefore less demanding of villein services); on the other hand, some upland areas of Europe showed some of the most oppressive manorial conditions, while lowland eastern England is credited with an exceptionally large free peasantry, in part a legacy of Scandinavian settlement.\nSimilarly, the spread of money economy stimulated the replacement of labour services by money payments, but the growth of the money supply and resulting inflation after 1170 initially led nobles to take back leased estates and to re-impose labour dues as the value of fixed cash payments declined in real terms.\nAbolition.\nThe last feudal dues in France were abolished at the French Revolution. The last patroonship was abolished in New York in the 1840s as a result of the Anti-Rent War. In parts of eastern Germany, the \"Rittergut\" manors of Junkers remained until World War II. In Quebec, the last feudal rents were paid in 1970 under the modified provisions of the \"Seigniorial Dues Abolition Act\" of 1935.\nSee also.\nSimilar land tenure systems in other parts of the world.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Mitchell wrote only one novel that was published during her lifetime, the American Civil War-era novel \"Gone with the Wind\", for which she won the National Book Award for Fiction for Most Distinguished Novel of 1936 and the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1937. Long after her death, a collection of Mitchell's girlhood writings and a novella she wrote as a teenager, titled \"Lost Laysen\", were published. A collection of newspaper articles written by Mitchell for \"The Atlanta Journal\" was republished in book form.\nFamily history.\nMargaret Mitchell was a lifelong resident of Georgia. She was born in 1900 into a wealthy and politically prominent family. Her father, Eugene Muse Mitchell, was an attorney, and her mother, Mary Isabel \"Maybelle\" Stephens, was a suffragist and Catholic activist. She had two brothers, Russell Stephens Mitchell, who died in infancy in 1894, and Alexander Stephens Mitchell, born in 1896.\nMitchell's family on her father's side were descendants of Thomas Mitchell, originally of Aberdeenshire, Scotland, who settled in Wilkes County, Georgia in 1777, and served in the American Revolutionary War. Thomas Mitchell was a surveyor by profession. He was on a surveying trip in Henry County, Georgia, at the home of John Lowe, about 6 miles from McDonough, Georgia, when he died in 1835 and is buried in that location. Thomas Mitchell's son, William Mitchell, born December 8, 1777, in Edgefield County, South Carolina, moved in 1834-1835 to a farm along the South River in the Flat Rock community in Georgia. William Mitchell died February 24, 1859, at the age of 81 and is buried in the family graveyard near Panola Mountain State Park. Margaret Mitchell's great-grandfather Issac Green Mitchell moved to a farm along the Flat Shoals Road located in the Flat Rock community in 1839. Four years later he sold this farm to Ira O. McDaniel and purchased a farm 3 miles farther down the road on the north side of the South River in DeKalb County, Georgia.\nHer grandfather, Russell Crawford Mitchell, of Atlanta, enlisted in the Confederate States Army on June 24, 1861, and served in Hood's Texas Brigade. He was severely wounded at the Battle of Sharpsburg, demoted for \"inefficiency\", and detailed as a nurse in Atlanta. After the Civil War, he made a large fortune supplying lumber for the rapid rebuilding of Atlanta. Russell Mitchell had thirteen children from two wives; the eldest was Eugene, who graduated from the University of Georgia Law School.\nMitchell's maternal great-grandfather, Philip Fitzgerald, emigrated from Ireland and eventually settled on a slaveholding plantation, Rural Home, near Jonesboro, Georgia, where he had one son and seven daughters with his wife, Elenor McGahan, who was from an Irish Catholic family with ties to Colonial Maryland. Mitchell's grandparents, married in 1863, were Annie Fitzgerald and John Stephens; he had also emigrated from Ireland and became a captain in the Confederate States Army. John Stephens was a prosperous real estate developer after the Civil War and one of the founders of the Gate City Street Railroad (1881), a mule-drawn Atlanta trolley system. John and Annie Stephens had twelve children together; the seventh child was May Belle Stephens, who married Eugene Mitchell. May Belle Stephens had studied at the Bellevue Convent in Quebec and completed her education at the Atlanta Female Institute.\nThe \"Atlanta Constitution\" reported that May Belle Stephens and Eugene Mitchell were married at the Jackson Street mansion of the bride's parents on November 8, 1892:\nthe maid of honor, Miss Annie Stephens, was as pretty as a French pastel, in a directoire costume of yellow satin with a long coat of green velvet sleeves, and a vest of gold brocade. ... The bride was a fair vision of youthful loveliness in her robe of exquisite ivory white and satin ... her slippers were white satin wrought with pearls ... an elegant supper was served. The dining room was decked in white and green, illuminated with numberless candles in silver candlelabras. ... The bride's gift from her father was an elegant house and lot. ... At 11 o'clock Mrs. Mitchell donned a pretty going-away gown of green English cloth with its jaunty velvet hat to match and bid goodbye to her friends.\nEarly influences.\nMitchell spent her early childhood on Jackson Hill, east of downtown Atlanta. Her family lived near her maternal grandmother, Annie Stephens, in a Victorian house painted bright red with yellow trim. Mrs. Stephens had been a widow for several years prior to Margaret's birth; Captain John Stephens died in 1896. After his death, she inherited property on Jackson Street where Margaret's family lived.\nGrandmother Annie Stephens was quite a character, both vulgar and a tyrant. After gaining control of her father Philip Fitzgerald's money after he died, she splurged on her younger daughters, including Margaret's mother, and sent them to finishing school in the north. There they learned that Irish Americans were not treated as equal to other immigrants. Margaret's relationship with her grandmother would become quarrelsome in later years as she entered adulthood. However, for Margaret, her grandmother was a great source of \"eye-witness information\" about the Civil War and Reconstruction in Atlanta prior to her death in 1934.\nGirlhood on Jackson Hill.\nWhen Mitchell was about three years old, her dress caught fire on an iron grate. Although Mitchell was unharmed, the accident was traumatic for her mother. Fearing it would happen again, Mitchell's mother began dressing her in boys' pants, and she was nicknamed \"Jimmy\", the name of a character in the comic strip \"Little Jimmy\". Her brother insisted she would have to be a boy named Jimmy to play with him. Having no sisters to play with, Mitchell said she was a boy named Jimmy until she was fourteen.\nStephens Mitchell said his sister was a tomboy who would happily play with dolls occasionally, and she liked to ride her Texas plains pony. As a little girl, Mitchell went riding every afternoon with a Confederate veteran and a young lady of \"beau-age\". She was raised in an era when children were \"seen and not heard\" and was not allowed to express her personality by running and screaming on Sunday afternoons while her family was visiting relatives.\nMitchell learned the gritty details of specific battles from these visits with aging Confederate soldiers. But she didn't learn that the South had actually lost the war until she was 10 years of age:\nI heard everything in the world except that the Confederates lost the war. When I was ten years old, it was a violent shock to learn that General Lee had been defeated. I didn't believe it when I first heard it and I was indignant. I still find it hard to believe, so strong are childhood impressions.\nHer mother would swat her with a hairbrush or a slipper as a form of discipline.\nMay Belle Mitchell was \"hissing blood-curdling threats\" to her daughter to make her behave the evening she took her to a women's suffrage rally led by Carrie Chapman Catt. Her daughter sat on a platform wearing a Votes-for-Women banner, blowing kisses to the gentlemen, while her mother gave an impassioned speech. She was nineteen years old when the Nineteenth Amendment was ratified, which gave women the right to vote.\nMay Belle Mitchell was president of the Atlanta Woman's Suffrage League (1915), co-founder of Georgia's division of the League of Women Voters, chairwoman of press publicity for the Georgia Mothers' Congress and Parent Teacher Association, a member of the Pioneer Society, the Atlanta Woman's Club, and several Catholic and literary societies.\nMitchell's father was not in favor of corporal punishment in school. During his tenure as president of the educational board (1911\u20131912), corporal punishment in the public schools was abolished. Reportedly, Eugene Mitchell received a whipping on the first day he attended school and the mental impression of the thrashing lasted far longer than the physical marks.\nJackson Hill was an old, affluent part of the city. At the bottom of Jackson Hill was an area of African-American homes and businesses called \"Darktown\". The mayhem of the Atlanta Race Riot occurred over four days in September 1906 when Mitchell was five years old. Local white newspapers printed unfounded rumors that several white women had been assaulted by black men, prompting an angry mob of 10,000 to assemble in the streets, pulling black people from street cars, beating, and killing dozens over the next three days.\nEugene Mitchell went to bed early the night the rioting began, but was awakened by the sounds of gunshots. The following morning, as he later wrote to his wife, he learned \"16 negroes had been killed and a multitude had been injured\" and that rioters \"killed or tried to kill every Negro they saw\". As the rioting continued, rumors ran wild that black people would burn Jackson Hill. At his daughter's suggestion, Eugene Mitchell, who did not own a gun, stood guard with a sword.\nThough the rumors proved untrue and no attack arrived, Mitchell recalled twenty years later the terror she felt during the riot. Mitchell grew up in a Southern culture where the fear of black-on-white rape incited mob violence, and in this world, white Georgians lived in fear of the \"black beast rapist\".\nA few years after the riot, the Mitchell family decided to move away from Jackson Hill. In 1912, they moved to the east side of Peachtree Street just north of Seventeenth Street in Atlanta. Past the nearest neighbor's house was forest, and beyond it the Chattahoochee River. Mitchell's former Jackson Hill home was destroyed in the Great Atlanta Fire of 1917.\nMitchell's father was of a Protestant background, while her mother was a devout Catholic; Mitchell was raised in a Catholic household. As a young woman, she spent time visiting the Sisters of Mercy convent affiliated with St. Joseph's Infirmary in downtown Atlanta. Her religious upbringing influenced her decision to make the O'Hara family in her novel Catholics in a Protestant-majority state. One of Mitchell's mother's cousins entered the Sisters of Mercy at St. Vincent's Convent in Savannah in 1883, becoming Sister Mary Melanie. The characters Melanie Hamilton and Carreen O'Hara were probably based on this relation.\nThe South of \"Gone with the Wind\".\nWhile \"the South\" exists as a geographical region of the United States, it is also said to exist as \"a place of the imagination\" of writers. An image of \"the South\" was fixed in Mitchell's imagination when at six years old her mother took her on a buggy tour through ruined plantations and \"Sherman's sentinels\", the brick and stone chimneys that remained after William Tecumseh Sherman's \"March and torch\" through Georgia. Mitchell would later recall what her mother had said to her:\nShe talked about the world those people had lived in, such a secure world, and how it had exploded beneath them. And she told me that my world was going to explode under me, someday, and God help me if I didn't have some weapon to meet the new world.\nFrom an imagination cultivated in her youth, Margaret Mitchell's defensive weapon would become her writing.\nMitchell said she heard Civil War stories from her relatives when she was growing up:\nOn Sunday afternoons when we went calling on the older generation of relatives, those who had been active in the Sixties, I sat on the bony knees of veterans and the fat slippery laps of great aunts and heard them talk.\nOn summer vacations, she visited her maternal great-aunts, Mary Ellen (\"Mamie\") Fitzgerald and Sarah (\"Sis\") Fitzgerald, who still lived at her great-grandparents' plantation home in Jonesboro. Mamie had been twenty-one years old and Sis was thirteen when the Civil War began.\nAn avid reader.\nAn avid reader, young Margaret read \"boys' stories\" by G.A. Henty, the Tom Swift series, and the Rover Boys series by Edward Stratemeyer. Her mother read Mary Johnston's novels to her before she could read. They both wept reading Johnston's \"The Long Roll\" (1911) and \"Cease Firing\" (1912). Between the \"scream of shells, the mighty onrush of charges, the grim and grisly aftermath of war\", \"Cease Firing\" is a romance novel involving the courtship of a Confederate soldier and a Louisiana plantation belle with Civil War illustrations by N. C. Wyeth. She also read the plays of William Shakespeare, and novels by Charles Dickens and Sir Walter Scott. Mitchell's two favorite children's books were by author Edith Nesbit: \"Five Children and It\" (1902) and \"The Phoenix and the Carpet\" (1904). She kept both on her bookshelf even as an adult and gave them as gifts.\nYoung storyteller.\nAn imaginative and precocious writer, Margaret Mitchell began with stories about animals, then progressed to fairy tales and adventure stories. She fashioned book covers for her stories, bound the tablet paper pages together and added her own artwork. At age eleven she gave a name to her publishing enterprise: \"Urchin Publishing Co.\" Later her stories were written in notebooks. May Belle Mitchell kept her daughter's stories in white enamel bread boxes and several boxes of her stories were stored in the house by the time Margaret went off to college.\n\"Margaret\" is a character riding a galloping pony in \"The Little Pioneers\", and plays \"Cowboys and Indians\" in \"When We Were Shipwrecked\".\nRomantic love and honor emerged as themes of abiding interest for Mitchell in \"The Knight and the Lady\" (ca. 1909), in which a \"good knight\" and a \"bad knight\" duel for the hand of the lady. In \"The Arrow Brave and the Deer Maiden\" (ca. 1913), a half-white Indian brave, Jack, must withstand the pain inflicted upon him to uphold his honor and win the girl. The same themes were treated with increasing artistry in \"Lost Laysen\", the novella Mitchell wrote as a teenager in 1916, and, with much greater sophistication, in Mitchell's last known novel, \"Gone with the Wind\", which she began in 1926.\nIn her pre-teens, Mitchell also wrote stories set in foreign locations, such as \"The Greaser\" (1913), a cowboy story set in Mexico. In 1913 she wrote two stories with Civil War settings; one includes her notation that \"237 pages are in this book\".\nSchool life.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFancy Dress Masquerade\nSeventy girls and boys were the guests of Miss Margaret Mitchell at a fancy dress masquerade yesterday afternoon at the home of her parents Mr. and Mrs. Eugene Mitchell on Peachtree street and the occasion was beautiful and enjoyable.\nThere was a prize for guessing the greatest number of identities under the masks, and another for the guest who best concealed his or her identity.\nThe pretty young hostess was a demure Martha Washington in flowered crepe gown over a pink silk petticoat and her powdered hair was worn high.\nMrs. Mitchell wore a ruby velvet gown.\n\"The Constitution\", Atlanta, November 21, 1914.\nWhile the Great War carried on in Europe (1914\u20131918), Margaret Mitchell attended Atlanta's Washington Seminary (now The Westminster Schools), a \"fashionable\" private girls' school with an enrollment of over 300 students. She was very active in the Drama Club. Mitchell played the male characters: Nick Bottom in Shakespeare's \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\" and Launcelot Gobbo in Shakespeare's \"The Merchant of Venice\", among others. She wrote a play about snobbish college girls that she acted in as well. She also joined the Literary Club and had two stories published in the yearbook: \"Little Sister\" and \"Sergeant Terry\". Ten-year-old \"Peggy\" is the heroine in \"Little Sister\". She hears her older sister being raped and shoots the rapist:\nColdly, dispassionately she viewed him, the chill steel of the gun giving her confidence. She must not miss now\u2014she would not miss\u2014and she did not.\nMitchell received encouragement from her English teacher, Mrs. Paisley, who recognized her writing talent. A demanding teacher, Paisley told her she had ability if she worked hard and would not be careless in constructing sentences. A sentence, she said, must be \"complete, concise and coherent\".\nMitchell read the books of Thomas Dixon, Jr., and in 1916, when the silent film, \"The Birth of a Nation\", was showing in Atlanta, she dramatized Dixon's \"The Traitor: A Story of the Fall of the Invisible Empire\" (1907). As both playwright and actress, she took the role of Steve Hoyle. For the production, she made a Ku Klux Klan costume from a white crepe dress and wore a boy's wig. (Note: Dixon rewrote \"The Traitor\" as \"The Black Hood\" (1924) and Steve Hoyle was renamed George Wilkes.)\nDuring her years at Washington Seminary, Mitchell's brother, Stephens, was away studying at Harvard University (1915\u20131917), and he left in May 1917 to enlist in the army, about a month after the U.S. declared war on Germany. He set sail for France in April 1918, participated in engagements in the Lagny and Marbache sectors, then returned to Georgia in October as a training instructor. While Margaret and her mother were in New York in September 1918 preparing for Margaret to attend college, Stephens wired his father that he was safe after his ship had been torpedoed en route to New York from France.\nStephens Mitchell thought college was the \"ruination of girls\". However, May Belle Mitchell placed a high value on education for women and she wanted her daughter's future accomplishments to come from using her mind. She saw education as Margaret's weapon and \"the key to survival\". The classical college education she desired for her daughter was one that was on par with men's colleges, and this type of education was available only at northern schools. Her mother chose Smith College in Northampton, Massachusetts for Margaret because she considered it to be the best women's college in the United States.\nUpon graduating from Washington Seminary in June 1918, Mitchell fell in love with a Harvard graduate, a young army lieutenant, Clifford West Henry, who was chief bayonet instructor at Camp Gordon from May 10 until the time he set sail for France on July 17. Henry was \"slightly effeminate\", \"ineffectual\", and \"rather effete-looking\" with \"homosexual tendencies\", according to biographer Anne Edwards. Before departing for France, he gave Mitchell an engagement ring.\nOn September 14, while she was enrolled at Smith College, Henry was mortally wounded in action in France and died on October 17. As Henry waited in the Verdun trenches, shortly before being wounded, he composed a poem on a leaf torn from his field notebook, found later among his effects. The last stanza of Lieutenant Clifford W. Henry's poem follows:\n&lt;poem&gt;\nIf \"out of luck\" at duty's call\nIn glorious action I should fall\n At God's behest,\nMay those I hold most dear and best\nKnow I have stood the acid test\n Should I \"go West.\"\n&lt;/poem&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n General Edwards Presents Medal \nMrs. Ira Henry of Sound Beach was presented the Distinguished Service medal from the War department today in honor of her son, Captain Clifford W. Henry for bravery under fire during the World war. The medal, recommended by General Pershing, was presented by Major General Edwards.\nCaptain Henry, who during the war was a lieutenant with Co.F, 102nd infantry, captured the town of Vignuelles, nine kilometers inside the Hindenburg line on September 13, 1918. Lieutenant Henry and 50 of his men were killed the next day by a terrific explosion in the town. Captain Henry was a graduate of Harvard University.\n\"The Bridgeport Telegram\", July 4, 1927.\nHenry repeatedly advanced in front of the platoon he commanded, drawing machine-gun fire so that the German nests could be located and wiped out by his men. Although wounded in the leg in this effort, his death was the result of shrapnel wounds from an air bomb dropped by a German plane. He was awarded the French \"Croix de guerre avec palme\" for his acts of heroism. From the President of the United States, the Commander in Chief of the United States Armed Forces, he was presented with the Distinguished Service Cross and an Oak Leaf Cluster in lieu of a second Distinguished Service Cross.\nClifford Henry was the great love of Margaret Mitchell's life, according to her brother. In a letter to a friend (A. Edee, March 26, 1920), Mitchell wrote of Clifford that she had a \"memory of a love that had in it no trace of physical passion\".\nMitchell had vague aspirations of a career in psychiatry, but her future was derailed by an event that killed over fifty million people worldwide, the 1918 flu pandemic. On January 25, 1919, her mother, May Belle Mitchell, succumbed to pneumonia from the \"Spanish flu\". Mitchell arrived home from college a day after her mother had died. Knowing her death was imminent, May Belle Mitchell wrote her daughter a brief letter and advised her:\nGive of yourself with both hands and overflowing heart, but give only the excess after you have lived your own life.\nAn average student at Smith College, Mitchell did not excel in any area of academics. She held a low estimation of her writing abilities. Even though her English professor had praised her work, she felt the praise was undue. After finishing her freshman year at Smith, Mitchell returned to Atlanta to take over the household for her father and never returned to college. In October 1919, while regaining her strength after an appendectomy, she confided to a friend that giving up college and her dreams of a \"journalistic career\" to keep house and take her mother's place in society meant \"giving up all the worthwhile things that counted for\u2014nothing!\"\nMarriage.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nMiss Mitchell, Hostess\nMiss Mitchell was hostess at an informal buffet supper last evening at her home on Peachtree road, the occasion complimenting Miss Blanche Neel, of Macon, who is visiting Miss Dorothy Bates.\nSpring flowers adorned the laced covered table in the dining room. Miss Neel was gowned in blue Georgette crepe. Miss Mitchell wore pink taffeta. Miss Bates was gowned in blue velvet.\nInvited to meet the honor guest were Miss Bates, Miss Virginia Walker, Miss Ethel Tye, Miss Caroline Tye, Miss Helen Turman, Miss Lethea Turman, Miss Frances Ellis, Miss Janet Davis, Miss Lillian Raley, Miss Mary Woolridge, Charles DuPree, William Cantrell, Lieutenant Jack Swarthout, Lieutenant William Gooch, Stephen Mitchell, McDonald Brittain, Harry Hallman, George Northen, Frank Hooper, Walter Whiteman, Frank Stanton, Val Stanton, Charles Belleau, Henry Angel, Berrien Upshaw and Edmond Cooper.\n\"The Constitution\", Atlanta, February 2, 1921.\nMargaret began using the name \"Peggy\" at Washington Seminary, and the abbreviated form \"Peg\" at Smith College, when she found an icon for herself in the mythological winged horse, \"Pegasus\", that inspires poets. Peggy made her Atlanta society debut in the 1920 winter season. In the \"gin and jazz style\" of the times, she did her \"flapping\" in the 1920s. At a 1921 Atlanta debutante charity ball, she performed an Apache dance. The dance included a kiss with her male partner that shocked Atlanta high society and led to her being blacklisted from the Junior League. The Apache and the Tango were scandalous dances for their elements of eroticism, the latter popularized in a 1921 silent film, \"The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse\", that made its lead actor, Rudolph Valentino, a sex symbol for his ability to Tango.\nMitchell was, in her own words, an \"unscrupulous flirt\". She found herself engaged to five men, but maintained that she neither lied to nor misled any of them. A local gossip columnist, who wrote under the name Polly Peachtree, described Mitchell's love life in a 1922 column:\n...she has in her brief life, perhaps, had more men really, truly 'dead in love' with her, more honest-to-goodness suitors than almost any other girl in Atlanta.\nIn April 1922, Mitchell was seeing two men almost daily: one was Berrien (\"Red\") Kinnard Upshaw (March 10, 1901 \u2013 January 13, 1949), whom she is thought to have met in 1917 at a dance hosted by the parents of one of her friends, and the other, Upshaw's roommate and friend, John Robert Marsh (October 6, 1895 \u2013 March 5, 1952), a copy editor from Kentucky who worked for the Associated Press. Upshaw was an Atlanta boy, a few months younger than Mitchell, whose family moved to Raleigh, North Carolina in 1916. In 1919 he was appointed to the United States Naval Academy, but resigned for academic deficiencies on January 5, 1920. He was readmitted in May, then 19 years old, and spent two months at sea before resigning a second time on September 1, 1920. Unsuccessful in his educational pursuits and with no job, in 1922 Upshaw earned money bootlegging alcohol out of the Georgia mountains.\nAlthough her family disapproved, Peggy and Red married on September 2, 1922; the best man at their wedding was John Marsh, who would become her second husband. The couple resided at the Mitchell home with her father. By December the marriage to Upshaw had dissolved and he left. Mitchell suffered physical and emotional abuse, the result of Upshaw's alcoholism and violent temper. Upshaw agreed to an uncontested divorce after John Marsh gave him a loan and Mitchell agreed not to press assault charges against him. Upshaw and Mitchell were divorced on October 16, 1924.\nDuring this time, Mitchell left the Catholic Church and became an Episcopalian.\nOn July 4, 1925, 24-year-old Margaret Mitchell and 29-year-old John Marsh were married in the Unitarian-Universalist Church. The Marshes made their home at the Crescent Apartments in Atlanta, taking occupancy of Apt. 1, which they affectionately named \"The Dump\" (now the Margaret Mitchell House and Museum).\nReporter for \"The Atlanta Journal\".\nWhile still legally married to Upshaw and needing income for herself, Mitchell got a job writing feature articles for \"The Atlanta Journal Sunday Magazine\". She received almost no encouragement from her family or \"society\" to pursue a career in journalism, and had no prior newspaper experience. Medora Field Perkerson, who hired Mitchell said:\nThere had been some skepticism on the Atlanta Journal Magazine staff when Peggy came to work as a reporter. Debutantes slept late in those days and didn't go in for jobs.\nHer first story, \"Atlanta Girl Sees Italian Revolution\", by Margaret Mitchell Upshaw, appeared on December 31, 1922. She wrote on a wide range of topics, from fashions to Confederate generals and King Tut. In an article that appeared on July 1, 1923, \"Valentino Declares He Isn't a Sheik\", she interviewed celebrity actor Rudolph Valentino, referring to him as \"Sheik\" from his film role. Less thrilled by his looks than his \"chief charm\", his \"low, husky voice with a soft, sibilant accent\", she described his face as \"swarthy\":\nHis face was swarthy, so brown that his white teeth flashed in startling contrast to his skin; his eyes\u2014tired, bored, but courteous.\nMitchell was quite thrilled when Valentino took her in his arms and carried her inside from the rooftop of the Georgian Terrace Hotel.\nMany of her stories were vividly descriptive. In an article titled, \"Bridesmaid of Eighty-Seven Recalls Mittie Roosevelt's Wedding\", she wrote of a white-columned mansion in which lived the last surviving bridesmaid at Theodore Roosevelt's mother's wedding:\nThe tall white columns glimpsed through the dark green of cedar foliage, the wide veranda encircling the house, the stately silence engendered by the century-old oaks evoke memories of Thomas Nelson Page's \"On Virginia\". The atmosphere of dignity, ease, and courtesy that was the soul of the Old South breathes from this old mansion...\nIn another article, \"Georgia's Empress and Women Soldiers\", she wrote short sketches of four notable Georgia women. One was the first woman to serve in the United States Senate, Rebecca Latimer Felton, a suffragist who held white supremacist views. The other women were: Nancy Hart, Lucy Mathilda Kenny (also known as Private Bill Thompson of the Confederate States Army) and Mary Musgrove. The article generated mail and controversy from her readers. Mitchell received criticism for depicting \"strong women who did not fit the accepted standards of femininity\".\nMitchell's journalism career, which began in 1922, came to an end less than four years later; her last article appeared on May 9, 1926. Several months after marrying John Marsh, Mitchell quit due to an ankle injury that would not heal properly and chose to become a full-time wife. During the time Mitchell worked for the \"Atlanta Journal\", she wrote 129 feature articles, 85 news stories, and several book reviews.\nInterest in erotica.\nMitchell began collecting erotica from book shops in New York City while in her twenties. The newlywed Marshes and their social group were interested in \"all forms of sexual expression\". Mitchell discussed her interest in dirty book shops and sexually explicit prose in letters to a friend, Harvey Smith. Smith noted her favorite reads were \"Fanny Hill\", \"The Perfumed Garden\", and \"\".\nMitchell developed an appreciation for the works of Southern writer James Branch Cabell, and his 1919 classic, \"Jurgen, A Comedy of Justice\". She read books about sexology and took particular interest in the case studies of Havelock Ellis, a British physician who studied human sexuality. During this period in which Mitchell was reading pornography and sexology, she was also writing \"Gone with the Wind\".\nNovelist.\nEarly works.\n\"Lost Laysen\".\nMitchell wrote a romance novella, \"Lost Laysen\", when she was fifteen years old (1916). She gave \"Lost Laysen\", which she had written in two notebooks, to a boyfriend, Henry Love Angel. He died in 1945 and the novella remained undiscovered among some letters she had written to him until 1994. The novella was published in 1996, eighty years after it was written, and became a \"New York Times\" Best Seller.\nIn \"Lost Laysen\", Mitchell explores the dynamics of three male characters and their relationship to the only female character, Courtenay Ross, a strong-willed American missionary to the South Pacific island of Laysen. The narrator of the tale is Billy Duncan, \"a rough, hardened soldier of fortune\", who is frequently involved in fights that leave him near death. Courtenay quickly observes Duncan's hard-muscled body as he works shirtless aboard a ship called \"Caliban\". Courtenay's suitor is Douglas Steele, an athletic man who apparently believes Courtenay is helpless without him. He follows Courtenay to Laysen to protect her from perceived foreign savages. The third male character is the rich, powerful yet villainous Juan Mardo. He leers at Courtenay and makes rude comments of a sexual nature, in Japanese no less. Mardo provokes Duncan and Steele, and each feels he must defend Courtenay's honor. Ultimately Courtenay defends her own honor rather than submit to shame.\nMitchell's half-breed\nantagonist, Juan Mardo, lurks in the shadows of the story and has no dialogue. The reader learns of Mardo's evil intentions through Duncan:\nThey were saying that Juan Mardo had his eye on you\u2014and intended to have you\u2014any way he could get you!\nMardo's desires are similar to those of Rhett Butler in his ardent pursuit of Scarlett O'Hara in Mitchell's epic novel, \"Gone with the Wind\". Rhett tells Scarlett:\nI always intended having you, one way or another.\nThe \"other way\" is rape. In \"Lost Laysen\" the male seducer is replaced with the male rapist.\n\"The Big Four\".\nIn Mitchell's teenage years, she is known to have written a 400-page novel about girls in a boarding school, \"The Big Four\". The novel is thought to be lost; Mitchell destroyed some of her manuscripts herself and others were destroyed after her death.\n\"Ropa Carmagin\".\nIn the 1920s, Mitchell completed a novelette, \"Ropa Carmagin\", about a Southern white girl who loves a biracial man. Mitchell submitted the manuscript to Macmillan Publishers in 1935 along with her manuscript for \"Gone with the Wind\". The novelette was rejected; Macmillan thought the story was too short for book form.\nWriting \"Gone with the Wind\".\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Rquote/styles.css\"/&gt;{ class=\"rquote pullquote floatright\" role=\"presentation\" style=\"display:table; border-collapse:collapse; border-style:none; float:right; margin:0.5em 0.75em; width:33%; \"\nIn May 1926, after Mitchell had left her job at the \"Atlanta Journal\" and was recovering at home from her ankle injury, she wrote a society column for the \"Sunday Magazine\", \"Elizabeth Bennet's Gossip\", which she continued to write until August. Meanwhile, her husband was growing weary of lugging armloads of books home from the library to keep his wife's mind occupied while she hobbled around the house; he emphatically suggested that she write her own book instead:\nFor God's sake, Peggy, can't you write a book instead of reading thousands of them?\nTo aid her in her literary endeavors, John Marsh brought home a Remington Portable No. 3 typewriter (c. 1928). For the next three years Mitchell worked exclusively on writing a Civil War-era novel whose heroine was named Pansy O'Hara (prior to \"Gone with the Wind\"'s publication Pansy was changed to Scarlett). She used parts of the manuscript to prop up a wobbly couch.\nIn April 1935, Harold Latham of Macmillan, an editor looking for new fiction, read her manuscript and saw that it could be a best-seller. After Latham agreed to publish the book, Mitchell worked for another six months checking the historical references and rewriting the opening chapter several times. Mitchell and John Marsh edited the final version of the novel. \"Gone with the Wind\" was published in June 1936.\nWorld War II.\nDuring World War II, Margaret Mitchell was a volunteer for the American Red Cross and she raised money for the war effort by selling war bonds. She was active in Home Defense, sewed hospital gowns and put patches on trousers. Her personal attention, however, was devoted to writing letters to men in uniform\u2014soldiers, sailors, and marines, sending them humor, encouragement, and her sympathy.\nThe USS \"Atlanta\" (CL-51) was a light cruiser used as an anti-aircraft ship of the United States Navy sponsored by Margaret Mitchell and used in the naval Battle of Midway and the Eastern Solomons. The ship was heavily damaged during night surface action on November 13, 1942, during the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal and subsequently scuttled on orders of her captain having earned five battle stars and a Presidential Unit Citation as a \"heroic example of invincible fighting spirit\".\nMitchell sponsored a second light cruiser named after the city of Atlanta, the USS \"Atlanta\" (CL-104). On February 6, 1944, she christened \"Atlanta\" in Camden, New Jersey, and the cruiser began fighting operations in May 1945. \"Atlanta\" was a member of task forces protecting fast carriers, was operating off the coast of Honsh\u016b when the Japanese surrendered on August 15, 1945, and earned two battle stars. She was finally sunk during explosive testing off San Clemente Island on October 1, 1970.\nDeath and legacy.\nMargaret Mitchell was struck by a speeding motorist as she crossed Peachtree Street at 13th Street in Atlanta with her husband, John Marsh, while on her way to see the movie \"A Canterbury Tale\" on the evening of August 11, 1949. She died at age 48 at Grady Hospital five days later on August 16 without fully regaining consciousness.\nMitchell was struck by Hugh Gravitt, an off-duty taxi driver who was driving his personal vehicle. After the collision, Gravitt was arrested for drunken driving and released on a $5,450 bond until Mitchell's death.\nGravitt was originally charged with drunken driving, speeding, and driving on the wrong side of the road. He was convicted of involuntary manslaughter in November 1949 and sentenced to 18 months in jail. He served almost 11 months. Gravitt died in 1994 at the age of 74.\nMargaret Mitchell was buried at Oakland Cemetery, Georgia. When her husband John died in 1952, he was buried next to his wife.\nIn 1978, Mitchell was inducted into the Georgia Newspaper Hall of Fame, followed by the Georgia Women of Achievement in 1994, and the Georgia Writers Hall of Fame in 2000.\nIn 1994, Shannen Doherty starred in the television film \"\", a fictionalized account of Mitchell's life directed by Larry Peerce.\nWhen Mitchell's nephew, Joseph Mitchell, died in 2011, he left fifty percent of trademark and literary rights of the Margaret Mitchell Estate, as well as some personal belongings of Mitchell's, to the Archdiocese of Atlanta.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Some insects, fish, amphibians, mollusks, crustaceans, cnidarians, echinoderms, and tunicates undergo metamorphosis, which is often accompanied by a change of nutrition source or behavior. Animals can be divided into species that undergo complete metamorphosis (\"holometaboly\"), incomplete metamorphosis (\"hemimetaboly\"), or no metamorphosis (\"ametaboly\").\nGenerally organisms with a larval stage undergo metamorphosis, and during metamorphosis the organism loses larval characteristics.\nEtymology.\nThe word \"metamorphosis\" derives from Ancient Greek , \"transformation, transforming\", from ('), \"after\" and ('), \"form\".\nHormonal control.\nIn insects, growth and metamorphosis are controlled by hormones synthesized by endocrine glands near the front of the body (anterior). Neurosecretory cells in an insect's brain secrete a hormone, the prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH) that activates prothoracic glands, which secrete a second hormone, usually ecdysone (an ecdysteroid), that induces ecdysis (shedding of the exoskeleton).\nPTTH also stimulates the corpora allata, a retrocerebral organ, to produce juvenile hormone, which prevents the development of adult characteristics during ecdysis. In holometabolous insects, molts between larval instars have a high level of juvenile hormone, the moult to the pupal stage has a low level of juvenile hormone, and the final, or imaginal, molt has no juvenile hormone present at all. Experiments on firebugs have shown how juvenile hormone can affect the number of nymph instar stages in hemimetabolous insects.\nIn chordates, metamorphosis is iodothyronine-induced and an ancestral feature of all chordates.\nInsects.\nAll three categories of metamorphosis can be found in the diversity of insects, including no metamorphosis (\"ametaboly\"), incomplete or partial metamorphosis (\"hemimetaboly\"), and complete metamorphosis (\"holometaboly\"). While ametabolous insects show very little difference between larval and adult forms (also known as \"direct development\"), both hemimetabolous and holometabolous insects have significant morphological and behavioral differences between larval and adult forms, the most significant being the inclusion, in holometabolous organisms, of a pupal or resting stage between the larval and adult forms.\nDevelopment and terminology.\nIn hemimetabolous insects, immature stages are called nymphs. Development proceeds in repeated stages of growth and ecdysis (moulting); these stages are called instars. The juvenile forms closely resemble adults, but are smaller and lack adult features such as wings and genitalia. The size and morphological differences between nymphs in different instars are small, often just differences in body proportions and the number of segments; in later instars, external wing buds form. The period from one molt to the next is called a stadium.\nIn holometabolous insects, immature stages are called larvae and differ markedly from adults. Insects which undergo holometabolism pass through a larval stage, then enter an inactive state called pupa (called a \"chrysalis\" in butterfly species), and finally emerge as adults.\nEvolution.\nThe earliest insect forms showed direct development (ametabolism), and the evolution of metamorphosis in insects is thought to have fuelled their dramatic radiation (1,2). Some early ametabolous \"true insects\" are still present today, such as bristletails and silverfish. Hemimetabolous insects include cockroaches, grasshoppers, dragonflies, and true bugs. Phylogenetically, all insects in the Pterygota undergo a marked change in form, texture and physical appearance from immature stage to adult. These insects either have hemimetabolous development, and undergo an incomplete or partial metamorphosis, or holometabolous development, which undergo a complete metamorphosis, including a pupal or resting stage between the larval and adult forms.\nA number of hypotheses have been proposed to explain the evolution of holometaboly from hemimetaboly, mostly centering on whether or not the intermediate stages of hemimetabolous forms are homologous in origin to the pupal stage of holometabolous forms.\nTemperature-dependent metamorphosis.\nAccording to a 2009 study, temperature plays an important role in insect development as individual species are found to have specific thermal windows that allow them to progress through their developmental stages. These windows are not significantly affected by ecological traits, rather, the windows are phylogenetically adapted to the ecological circumstances insects are living in.\nRecent research.\nAccording to research from 2008, adult \"Manduca sexta\" is able to retain behavior learned as a caterpillar. Another caterpillar, the ornate moth caterpillar, is able to carry toxins that it acquires from its diet through metamorphosis and into adulthood, where the toxins still serve for protection against predators.\nMany observations published in 2002, and supported in 2013 indicate that programmed cell death plays a considerable role during physiological processes of multicellular organisms, particularly during embryogenesis, and metamorphosis. Additional research in 2019 found that both autophagy and apoptosis, the two ways programmed cell death occur, are processes undergone during insect metamorphosis.\nBelow is the sequence of steps in the metamorphosis of the butterfly (illustrated):\n1 \u2013 The larva of a butterfly \n2 \u2013 The pupa is now spewing the thread to form chrysalis \n3 \u2013 The chrysalis is fully formed \n4 \u2013 Adult butterfly coming out of the chrysalis\nChordata.\nAmphioxus.\nIn cephalochordata, metamorphosis is iodothyronine-induced and it could be an ancestral feature of all chordates.\nFish.\nSome fish, both bony fish (Osteichthyes) and jawless fish (Agnatha), undergo metamorphosis. Fish metamorphosis is typically under strong control by the thyroid hormone.\nExamples among the non-bony fish include the lamprey. Among the bony fish, mechanisms are varied.\nThe salmon is diadromous, meaning that it changes from a freshwater to a saltwater lifestyle.\nMany species of flatfish begin their life bilaterally symmetrical, with an eye on either side of the body; but one eye moves to join the other side of the fish \u2013 which becomes the upper side \u2013 in the adult form.\nThe European eel has a number of metamorphoses, from the larval stage to the leptocephalus stage, then a quick metamorphosis to glass eel at the edge of the continental shelf (eight days for the Japanese eel), two months at the border of fresh and salt water where the glass eel undergoes a quick metamorphosis into elver, then a long stage of growth followed by a more gradual metamorphosis to the migrating phase. In the pre-adult freshwater stage, the eel also has phenotypic plasticity because fish-eating eels develop very wide mandibles, making the head look blunt. Leptocephali are common, occurring in all Elopomorpha (tarpon- and eel-like fish).\nMost other bony fish undergo metamorphosis initially from egg to immotile larvae known as \"sac fry\" (fry with a yolk sac), then to motile larvae (often known as fingerlings due to them roughly reaching the length of a human finger) that have to forage for themselves after the yolk sac resorbs, and then to the juvenile stage where the fish progressively start to resemble adult morphology and behaviors until finally reaching sexual maturity.\nAmphibians.\nIn typical amphibian development, eggs are laid in water and larvae are adapted to an aquatic lifestyle. Frogs, toads, and newts all hatch from the eggs as larvae with external gills but it will take some time for the amphibians to interact outside with pulmonary respiration. Afterwards, newt larvae start a predatory lifestyle, while tadpoles mostly scrape food off surfaces with their horny tooth ridges.\nMetamorphosis in amphibians is regulated by thyroxin concentration in the blood, which stimulates metamorphosis, and prolactin, which counteracts its effect. Specific events are dependent on threshold values for different tissues. Because most embryonic development is outside the parental body, development is subject to many adaptations due to specific ecological circumstances. For this reason tadpoles can have horny ridges for teeth, whiskers, and fins. They also make use of the lateral line organ. After metamorphosis, these organs become redundant and will be resorbed by controlled cell death, called apoptosis. The amount of adaptation to specific ecological circumstances is remarkable, with many discoveries still being made.\nFrogs and toads.\nWith frogs and toads, the external gills of the newly hatched tadpole are covered with a gill sac after a few days, and lungs are quickly formed. Front legs are formed under the gill sac, and hindlegs are visible a few days later. Following that there is usually a longer stage during which the tadpole lives off a vegetarian diet. Tadpoles use a relatively long, spiral\u2010shaped gut to digest that diet. Recent studies suggest tadpoles do not have a balanced homeostatic feedback control system until the beginning stages of metamorphosis. At this point, their long gut shortens and begins favoring the diet of insects.\nRapid changes in the body can then be observed as the lifestyle of the frog changes completely. The spiral\u2010shaped mouth with horny tooth ridges is resorbed together with the spiral gut. The animal develops a big jaw, and its gills disappear along with its gill sac. Eyes and legs grow quickly, a tongue is formed, and all this is accompanied by associated changes in the neural networks (development of stereoscopic vision, loss of the lateral line system, etc.) All this can happen in about a day. It is not until a few days later that the tail is reabsorbed, due to the higher thyroxin concentrations required for tail resorption.\nSalamanders.\nSalamander development is highly diverse; some species go through a dramatic reorganization when transitioning from aquatic larvae to terrestrial adults, while others, such as the axolotl, display pedomorphosis and never develop into terrestrial adults. Within the genus \"Ambystoma\", species have evolved to be pedomorphic several times, and pedomorphosis and complete development can both occur in some species.\nNewts.\nIn newts, metamorphosis occurs due to the change in habitat, not a change in diet, because newt larvae already feed as predators and continue doing so as adults. Newts' gills are never covered by a gill sac and will be resorbed only just before the animal leaves the water. Adults can move faster on land than in water. Newts often have an aquatic phase in spring and summer, and a land phase in winter. For adaptation to a water phase, prolactin is the required hormone, and for adaptation to the land phase, thyroxin. External gills do not return in subsequent aquatic phases because these are completely absorbed upon leaving the water for the first time.\nCaecilians.\nBasal caecilians such as \"Ichthyophis\" go through a metamorphosis in which aquatic larva transition into fossorial adults, which involves a loss of the lateral line. More recently diverged caecilians (the Teresomata) do not undergo an ontogenetic niche shift of this sort and are in general fossorial throughout their lives. Thus, most caecilians do not undergo an anuran-like metamorphosis.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Plainlist/styles.css\"/&gt;"}

{"id": "20869", "revid": "48643156", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20869", "title": "Monoamine oxidase inhibitor", "text": "Type of medication\nMonoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) are a class of drug that inhibit the activity of one or both monoamine oxidase enzymes: monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) and monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B). MAOIs are effective antidepressants due to their specialized function of the inhibition of the enzyme that is responsible for neurotransmitter degradation in the synaptic cleft. This is especially true for treatment-resistant depression, which is a type of depression that is resistant to common treatments of typical depression, such as selective-serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs).\nMAOIs are also utilized to treat panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, Parkinson's disease, and several other disorders.\nReversible inhibitors of monoamine oxidase A (RIMAs) are a subclass of MAOIs that selectively and reversibly inhibit the MAO-A enzyme. RIMAs are used clinically in the treatment of depression and dysthymia. Due to their reversibility, they are safer in single-drug overdose than the older, irreversible MAOIs, and weaker in increasing the monoamines important in depressive disorder. RIMAs have not gained widespread market share in the United States. \nMedical uses.\nMAOIs have been found to be effective in the treatment of panic disorder with agoraphobia, social phobia, atypical depression or mixed anxiety disorder and depression, bulimia, and post-traumatic stress disorder, as well as borderline personality disorder, and obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder (OCD). MAOIs appear to be particularly effective in the management of bipolar depression according to a retrospective-analysis from 2009. There are reports of MAOI efficacy in OCD, trichotillomania, body dysmorphic disorder, and avoidant personality disorder, but these reports are from uncontrolled case reports.\nMAOIs can also be used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease by targeting MAO-B in particular (therefore affecting dopaminergic neurons), as well as providing an alternative for migraine prophylaxis. Inhibition of both MAO-A and MAO-B is used in the treatment of clinical depression and anxiety.\nMAOIs appear to be particularly indicated for outpatients with dysthymia complicated by panic disorder or hysteroid dysphoria.\nNewer MAOIs such as selegiline (typically used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease) and the reversible MAOI moclobemide provide a safer alternative and are now sometimes used as first-line therapy.\nPargyline is a non-selective MAOI that was previously used as an antihypertensive agent to treat hypertension (high blood pressure).\nSide effects.\nHypertensive crisis.\nPeople taking MAOIs generally need to change their diets to limit or avoid foods and beverages containing tyramine. If large amounts of tyramine are consumed, they may develop a hypertensive crisis, which can be fatal. Examples of foods and beverages with potentially high levels of tyramine include cheese, Chianti wine, and pickled fish. Excessive concentrations of tyramine in blood plasma can lead to hypertensive crisis by increasing the release of norepinephrine (NE), which causes blood vessels to constrict by activating alpha-1 adrenergic receptors. Ordinarily, MAO-A would destroy the excess NE; when MAO-A is inhibited, however, NE levels get too high, leading to dangerous increases in blood pressure.\nRIMAs are displaced from MAO-A in the presence of tyramine, rather than inhibiting its breakdown in the liver as general MAOIs do. Additionally, MAO-B remains free and continues to metabolize tyramine in the stomach, although this is less significant than the liver action. Thus, RIMAs are unlikely to elicit tyramine-mediated hypertensive crisis; moreover, dietary modifications are not usually necessary when taking a reversible inhibitor of MAO-A (i.e., moclobemide) or low doses of selective MAO-B inhibitors (e.g., selegiline 6 mg/24 hours transdermal patch).\nDrug interactions.\nThe most significant risk associated with the use of MAOIs is the potential for drug interactions with over-the-counter, prescription, or illegally obtained medications, and some dietary supplements (e.g., St. John's wort or tryptophan). It is vital that a doctor supervise such combinations to avoid adverse reactions. For this reason, many users carry an MAOI-card, which lets emergency medical personnel know what drugs to avoid (e.g. adrenaline [epinephrine] dosage should be reduced by 75%, and duration is extended).\nTryptophan supplements can be consumed with MAOIs, but can result in transient serotonin syndrome.\nMAOIs should not be combined with other psychoactive substances (antidepressants, painkillers, stimulants, including prescribed, OTC and illegally acquired drugs, etc.) except under expert care. Certain combinations can cause lethal reactions; common examples include SSRIs, tricyclics, MDMA, meperidine, tramadol, and dextromethorphan, whereas combinations with LSD, psilocybin, or DMT appear to be relatively safe. Drugs that affect the release or reuptake of epinephrine, norepinephrine, serotonin or dopamine typically need to be administered at lower doses due to the resulting potentiated and prolonged effect. MAOIs also interact with tobacco-containing products (e.g. cigarettes) and may potentiate the effects of certain compounds in tobacco. This may be reflected in the difficulty of smoking cessation, as tobacco contains naturally occurring MAOI compounds in addition to the nicotine.\nWhile safer than general MAOIs, RIMAs still possess significant and potentially serious drug interactions with many common drugs; in particular, they can cause serotonin syndrome or hypertensive crisis when combined with almost any antidepressant or stimulant, common migraine medications, certain herbs, or most cold medicines (including decongestants, antihistamines, and cough syrup).\nOcular alpha-2 agonists such as brimonidine and apraclonidine are glaucoma medications which reduce intraocular pressure by decreasing aqueous production. These alpha-2 agonists should not be given with oral MAOIs due to the risk of hypertensive crisis.\nWithdrawal.\nAntidepressants including MAOIs have some dependence-producing effects, the most notable one being a discontinuation syndrome, which may be severe especially if MAOIs are discontinued abruptly or too rapidly. The dependence-producing potential of MAOIs or antidepressants in general is not as significant as benzodiazepines. Discontinuation symptoms can be managed by tapering, a gradual reduction in dosage over a period of days, weeks or sometimes months to minimize or prevent withdrawal symptoms.\nMAOIs, as with most antidepressant medication, may not alter the course of the disorder in a significant, permanent way, so it is possible that discontinuation can return the patient to the pre-treatment state. This consideration complicates prescribing between an MAOI and an SSRI, because it is necessary to clear the system completely of one drug before starting another. One physician organization recommends the dose to be tapered down over a minimum of four weeks, followed by a two-week washout period. The result is that a depressed patient will have to bear the depression without chemical help during the drug-free interval. This may be preferable to risking the effects of an interaction between the two drugs.\nMechanism of action.\nMAOIs act by inhibiting the activity of monoamine oxidase. Monoamine oxidase is an enzyme that is responsible for the degradation of monoamine neurotransmitters, such as dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine, and prevents these neurotransmitters from remaining in the synaptic cleft for extended periods of time. Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors are responsible for inhibiting monoamine oxidase, ultimately leading to prevention of the degradation of neurotransmitters in the synaptic cleft, leading to higher concentrations of neurotransmitters to remain in the synaptic cleft for longer periods of time.\nThere are two isoforms of monoamine oxidase, MAO-A and MAO-B. MAO-A preferentially deaminates serotonin, melatonin, epinephrine, and norepinephrine. MAO-B preferentially deaminates phenethylamine and certain other trace amines; in contrast, MAO-A preferentially deaminates other trace amines, like tyramine, whereas dopamine is equally deaminated by both types.\nReversibility.\nThe early MAOIs covalently bound to the monoamine oxidase enzymes, thus inhibiting them irreversibly; the bound enzyme could not function and thus enzyme activity was blocked until the cell made new enzymes. The enzymes turn over approximately every two weeks. A few newer MAOIs, a notable one being moclobemide, are reversible, meaning that they are able to detach from the enzyme to facilitate usual catabolism of the substrate. The level of inhibition in this way is governed by the concentrations of the substrate and the MAOI.\nHarmaline found in \"Peganum harmala\", \"Banisteriopsis caapi\", and \"Passiflora incarnata\" is a reversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase A (RIMA).\nSelectivity.\nIn addition to reversibility, MAOIs differ by their selectivity of the MAO enzyme subtype. Some MAOIs inhibit both MAO-A and MAO-B equally, other MAOIs have been developed to target one over the other.\nMAO-A inhibition reduces the breakdown of primarily serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine; selective inhibition of MAO-A allows for tyramine to be metabolised via MAO-B. Agents that act on serotonin, if taken with another serotonin-enhancing agent, may result in a potentially fatal interaction called serotonin syndrome; if taken with irreversible and unselective inhibitors (such as older MAOIs) a hypertensive crisis may result due to tyramine food interactions. Tyramine is broken down by MAO-A and MAO-B, therefore inhibiting this action may result in its excessive build-up, so diet must be monitored for tyramine intake.\nMAO-B inhibition reduces the breakdown mainly of dopamine and phenethylamine, so there are no associated dietary restrictions. MAO-B would also metabolize tyramine, as the only differences between dopamine, phenethylamine, and tyramine are two phenylhydroxyl groups on carbons 3 and 4. The 4-OH would not be a steric hindrance to MAO-B on tyramine. Selegiline is selective for MAO-B at low doses, but non-selective at higher doses.\nHistory.\nThe knowledge of MAOIs began with the serendipitous discovery that iproniazid was a potent MAO inhibitor (MAOI). Originally intended for the treatment of tuberculosis, in 1952, iproniazid's antidepressant properties were discovered when researchers noted that the depressed patients given iproniazid experienced a relief of their depression. Subsequent in vitro work led to the discovery that it inhibited MAO and eventually to the monoamine theory of depression. MAOIs became widely used as antidepressants in the early 1950s. The discovery of the 2 isoenzymes of MAO has led to the development of selective MAOIs that may have a more favorable side-effect profile.\nThe older MAOIs' heyday was mostly between the years 1957 and 1970. The initial popularity of the 'classic' non-selective irreversible MAO inhibitors began to wane due to their serious interactions with sympathomimetic drugs and tyramine-containing foods that could lead to dangerous hypertensive emergencies. As a result, the use by medical practitioners of these older MAOIs declined. When scientists discovered that there are two different MAO enzymes (MAO-A and MAO-B), they developed selective compounds for MAO-B, (for example, selegiline, which is used for Parkinson's disease), to reduce the side-effects and serious interactions. Further improvement occurred with the development of compounds (moclobemide and toloxatone) that not only are selective but cause reversible MAO-A inhibition and a reduction in dietary and drug interactions. Moclobemide, was the first reversible inhibitor of MAO-A to enter widespread clinical practice.\nA transdermal patch form of the MAOI selegiline, called Emsam, was approved for use in depression by the Food and Drug Administration in the United States on 28 February 2006.\nList of MAO inhibiting drugs.\nMarketed MAOIs.\nLinezolid is an antibiotic drug with weak, reversible MAO-inhibiting activity.\nThe antibiotic furazolidone also has MAO-inhibiting activity \nMethylene blue (methylthioninium chloride), the antidote indicated for drug-induced methemoglobinemia on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, among a plethora of other off-label uses, is a highly potent, reversible MAO inhibitor.\nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved these MAOIs to treat depression:\nList of RIMAs.\nMarketed pharmaceuticals\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nOther pharmaceuticals\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNaturally occurring RIMAs in plants\nOnly reversible phytochemical MAOIs have been characterized.\nResearch compounds\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Fungi can be a source of tinder, food, traditional medicine, as well as entheogens, poison, and infection. Yeasts are among the most heavily utilized members of the fungus kingdom, particularly in food manufacturing.\nMycology branches into the field of phytopathology, the study of plant diseases. The two disciplines are closely related, because the vast majority of plant pathogens are fungi. A biologist specializing in mycology is called a mycologist.\nOverview.\nThe word \"mycology\" comes from the Ancient Greek: \u03bc\u03cd\u03ba\u03b7\u03c2 (\"muk\u0113s\"), meaning \"fungus\" and the suffix (\"-logia\"), meaning \"study.\" Pioneer mycologists included Elias Magnus Fries, Christiaan Hendrik Persoon, Heinrich Anton de Bary, Elizabeth Eaton Morse, and Lewis David de Schweinitz. Beatrix Potter, author of \"The Tale of Peter Rabbit\", also made significant contributions to the field.\nPier Andrea Saccardo developed a system for classifying the imperfect fungi by spore color and form, which became the primary system used before classification by DNA analysis. He is most famous for his \"Sylloge Fungorum\", which was a comprehensive list of all of the names that had been used for mushrooms. \"Sylloge\" is still the only work of this kind that was both comprehensive for the botanical kingdom Fungi and reasonably modern.\nMany fungi produce toxins, antibiotics, and other secondary metabolites. For example, the cosmopolitan genus \"Fusarium\" and their toxins associated with fatal outbreaks of alimentary toxic aleukia in humans were extensively studied by Abraham Z. Joffe.\nFungi are fundamental for life on earth in their roles as symbionts, e.g. in the form of mycorrhizae, insect symbionts, and lichens. Many fungi are able to break down complex organic biomolecules such as lignin, the more durable component of wood, and pollutants such as xenobiotics, petroleum, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. By decomposing these molecules, fungi play a critical role in the global carbon cycle.\nFungi and other organisms traditionally recognized as fungi, such as oomycetes and myxomycetes (slime molds), often are economically and socially important, as some cause diseases of animals (including humans) and of plants.\nApart from pathogenic fungi, many fungal species are very important in controlling the plant diseases caused by different pathogens. For example, species of the filamentous fungal genus \"Trichoderma\" are considered one of the most important biological control agents as an alternative to chemical-based products for effective crop disease management.\nField meetings to find interesting species of fungi are known as 'forays', after the first such meeting organized by the Woolhope Naturalists' Field Club in 1868 and entitled \"A foray among the funguses [\"sic\"]\".\nSome fungi can cause disease in humans and other animals; the study of pathogenic fungi that infect animals is referred to as medical mycology.\nHistory.\nIt is believed that humans started collecting mushrooms as food in prehistoric times. Mushrooms were first written about in the works of Euripides (480\u2013406 BC). The Greek philosopher Theophrastos of Eresos (371\u2013288 BC) was perhaps the first to try to systematically classify plants; mushrooms were considered to be plants missing certain organs. It was later Pliny the Elder (23\u201379 AD), who wrote about truffles in his encyclopedia \"Natural History\".\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Rquote/styles.css\"/&gt;{ class=\"rquote pullquote floatright\" role=\"presentation\" style=\"display:table; border-collapse:collapse; border-style:none; float:right; margin:0.5em 0.75em; width:33%; \"\nThe Middle Ages saw little advancement in the body of knowledge about fungi. However, the invention of the printing press allowed authors to dispel superstitions and misconceptions about the fungi that had been perpetuated by the classical authors.\nThe start of the modern age of mycology begins with Pier Antonio Micheli's 1737 publication of \"Nova plantarum genera\". Published in Florence, this seminal work laid the foundations for the systematic classification of grasses, mosses and fungi. He originated the still current genus names \"Polyporus\" and \"Tuber\", both dated 1729 (though the descriptions were later amended as invalid by modern rules).\nThe founding nomenclaturist Carl Linnaeus included fungi in his binomial naming system in 1753, where each type of organism has a two-word name consisting of a genus and species (whereas up to then organisms were often designated with Latin phrases containing many words). He originated the scientific names of numerous well-known mushroom taxa, such as \"Boletus\" and \"Agaricus\", which are still in use today. During this period, fungi were still considered to belong to the plant kingdom, so they were categorized in his \"Species Plantarum\". Linnaeus' fungal taxa were not nearly as comprehensive as his plant taxa, however, grouping together all gilled mushrooms with a stem in genus \"Agaricus\". Thousands of gilled species exist, which were later divided into dozens of diverse genera; in its modern usage, \"Agaricus\" only refers to mushrooms closely related to the common shop mushroom, \"Agaricus bisporus\". For example, Linnaeus gave the name \"Agaricus deliciosus\" to the saffron milk-cap, but its current name is \"Lactarius deliciosus\". On the other hand, the field mushroom \"Agaricus campestris\" has kept the same name ever since Linnaeus's publication. The English word \"agaric\" is still used for any gilled mushroom, which corresponds to Linnaeus's use of the word.\nAlthough mycology was historically considered a branch of botany, the 1969 discovery of fungi's close evolutionary relationship to animals resulted in the study's reclassification as an independent field. The term \"mycology\" and the complementary term \"mycologist\" are traditionally attributed to M.J. Berkeley in 1836. However, \"mycologist\" appeared in writings by English botanist Robert Kaye Greville as early as 1823 in reference to Schweinitz.\nScope and importance.\nProduction, trade, and food manufacturing.\nLumber and timber products are a key element of international trade, as they are used for all things from architecture to firewood. The cultivation of forested ecosystems to produce this amount of usable wood is highly dependent on the mycorrhizal symbiotic relationships between plants, specifically trees, and fungi. The fungi provide a great number of benefits to their symbiotic plant partner, such as disease tolerance, improved growth and mineral nutrition, stress tolerance, and even fertilizer utilization.\nAnother major component of international trade over recent years has been edible and medicinal mushrooms. While many fungal species can be cultivated in large farming installations, the cultivation of some coveted species has yet to be fully understood, which means that there are many species that can only be found naturally in the wild. While the demand of wild mushroom species has increased worldwide over recent years, the rarity of these species has not changed. Even still, mushroom hunting has become a key factor in local economies.\nIncreased scientific knowledge of fungal diversity has led to biotechnological advances in food manufacturing. Humans have utilized this knowledge by cultivating various types of fungi, particularly yeasts. There are over 500 species of yeasts that have been cultivated for different purposes, the most common of which is \"Saccharomyces cerevisiae\", also known as baker's yeast. As its common name suggests, \"S. cerevisiae\" has been used for winemaking, baking, and brewing since ancient times.\nFermentation is one of the earliest forms of food preservation, with the earliest recorded use dating back over 13,000 years ago in Israel. The cultivation of bacteria and fungi, particularly yeasts, have been used for centuries to increase the storage life of meats, vegetables, grains, and other foods. Fermentation also plays a significant role in the production of various food products and alcoholic beverages such as beer and wine. About 90% of the world's beer production comes from lager beer and 5% from ale beer, while the rest is from spontaneous fermentation of a variety of yeasts and bacteria. Production of alcoholic beverages play significant roles in the economics of many countries, with beer often being a crucial export.\nPlant pathogenic fungi.\nPlant pathogenic fungi are a serious threat when it comes to crop availability and food security. These fungi can infiltrate plants and food crops, which can cause serious economic issues for agricultural industries in numerous countries. Various plant pathogens can cause cash crops to become inedible and virtually useless to the farmer that is growing them. This problem has increased over the years as the usage of monocultures have become more prevalent: a limited variety of plants in one area can lead to the rapid spread of specific pathogens. \"Puccinia graminis\" is a type of stem rust that targets wheat crops worldwide from Africa to Europe. Another devastating fungal pathogen is \"Sarocladium oryzae\", which is a type of sheath rot fungus prevalent in India and is a great threat to rice cultivation. Historically, one of the more well-known cases of plant-fungal pandemics was the potato blight of Ireland, which was caused by a water mold known as \"Phytophthora infestans\". This event is known as the Great Famine of Ireland.\nMycology and drug discovery.\nFor centuries, certain mushrooms have been documented as a folk medicine in China, Japan, and Russia. Although the use of mushrooms in folk medicine is centered largely on the Asian continent, people in other parts of the world like the Middle East, Poland, and Belarus have been documented using mushrooms for medicinal purposes.\nMushrooms produce large amounts of vitamin D when exposed to ultraviolet (UV) light. Penicillin, ciclosporin, griseofulvin, cephalosporin and psilocybin are examples of drugs that have been isolated from molds or other fungi.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Besides a pathological condition, melancholy could also refer to a mood or temperament and at times it was even used as a description of the human condition in general.\nMelancholy (or more precisely the 'black bile', from which melancholy derives its name) was regarded as one of the four temperaments matching the four humours. Until the 18th century, doctors and other scholars classified melancholic conditions as such by their perceived common cause\u00a0\u2013 an excess of a notional fluid known as \"black bile\", which was commonly linked to the spleen. Hippocrates and other ancient physicians described melancholia as a distinct disease with mental and physical symptoms, including persistent fears and despondencies, poor appetite, abulia, sleeplessness, irritability, and agitation. Later, fixed delusions were added by Galen and other physicians to the list of symptoms. In the Middle Ages, the understanding of melancholia shifted to a religious perspective, with sadness seen as a vice and demonic possession, rather than somatic causes, as a potential cause of the disease.\nDuring the late 16th and early 17th centuries, a cultural and literary cult of melancholia emerged in England, linked to Neoplatonist and humanist Marsilio Ficino's transformation of melancholia from a sign of vice into a mark of genius. This fashionable melancholy became a prominent theme in literature, art, and music of the era.\nBetween the late 18th and late 19th centuries, \"melancholia\" was a common medical diagnosis. In this period, the focus was on the abnormal beliefs associated with the disorder, rather than depression and affective symptoms. In the 19th century, melancholia was considered to be rooted in subjective 'passions' that seemingly caused disordered mood (in contrast to modern biomedical explanations for mood disorders). In Victorian Britain, the notion of melancholia as a disease evolved as it became increasingly classifiable and diagnosable with a set list of symptoms that contributed to a biomedical model for the understanding mental disease. However, in the 20th century, the focus again shifted, and the term became used essentially as a synonym for depression. Indeed, modern concepts of depression as a mood disorder eventually arose from this historical context. Today, the term \"melancholia\" and \"melancholic\" are still used in medical diagnostic classification, such as in ICD-11 and DSM-5, to specify certain features that may be present in major depression. \nThe 20th and 21st century accounts of depression are the successors of melancholia in psychiatry, but melancholia (or melancholy) also had a much wider use before the 19th century. It was a subject with which not only psychiatrists and doctors, but also philosophers, poets, artists, and writers all engaged. This led to a relatively ambiguous field of meaning, in which melancholy was accommodated within an understanding of human nature on the basis of humoral theory.\nRelated terms used in historical medicine include lugubriousness (from Latin ), moroseness (from Latin ), wistfulness (from a blend of \"wishful\" and the obsolete English \"wistly\", meaning 'intently'), and saturnineness (from Latin ).\nEarly history.\nThe name \"melancholia\" comes from the old medical belief of the four humours: disease or ailment being caused by an imbalance in one or more of the four basic bodily liquids, or humours. Personality types were similarly determined by the dominant humor in a particular person. According to Hippocrates and subsequent tradition, melancholia was caused by an excess of black bile, hence the name, which means \"black bile\", from Ancient Greek \u03bc\u03ad\u03bb\u03b1\u03c2 (), \"dark, black\", and \u03c7\u03bf\u03bb\u03ae (), \"bile\"; a person whose constitution tended to have a preponderance of black bile had a \"melancholic\" disposition. In the complex elaboration of humorist theory, it was associated with the earth from the Four Elements, the season of autumn, the spleen as the originating organ and cold and dry as related qualities. In astrology it showed the influence of Saturn, hence the related adjective \"saturnine\".\nMelancholia was described as a distinct disease with particular mental and physical symptoms in the 5th and 4th centuries BC. Hippocrates, in his \"\", characterized all \"fears and despondencies, if they last a long time\" as being symptomatic of melancholia. Other symptoms mentioned by Hippocrates include: poor appetite, abulia, sleeplessness, irritability, agitation. The Hippocratic clinical description of melancholia shows significant overlaps with contemporary nosography of depressive syndromes (6 symptoms out of the 9 included in DSM diagnostic criteria for a Major Depressive).\nIn ancient Rome, Galen added \"fixed delusions\" to the set of symptoms listed by Hippocrates. Galen also believed that melancholia caused cancer. Aretaeus of Cappadocia, in turn, believed that melancholia involved both a state of anguish, and a delusion. In the 10th century Persian physician Al-Akhawayni Bokhari described melancholia as a chronic illness caused by the impact of black bile on the brain. He described melancholia's initial clinical manifestations as \"suffering from an unexplained fear, inability to answer questions or providing false answers, self-laughing and self-crying and speaking meaninglessly, yet with no fever.\"\nIn Middle-Ages Europe, the humoral, somatic paradigm for understanding sustained sadness lost primacy in front of the prevailing religious perspective. Sadness came to be a vice (\u03bb\u03cd\u03c0\u03b7 in the Greek vice list by Evagrius Ponticus, tristitia vel acidia in the 7 vice list by Pope Gregory I). When a patient could not be cured of the disease it was thought that the melancholia was a result of demonic possession.\nIn his study of French and Burgundian courtly culture, Johan Huizinga noted that \"at the close of the Middle Ages, a sombre melancholy weighs on people's souls.\" In chronicles, poems, sermons, even in legal documents, an immense sadness, a note of despair and a fashionable sense of suffering and deliquescence at the approaching end of times, suffuses court poets and chroniclers alike: Huizinga quotes instances in the ballads of Eustache Deschamps, \"monotonous and gloomy variations of the same dismal theme\", and in Georges Chastellain's prologue to his Burgundian chronicle, and in the late 15th-century poetry of Jean Meschinot. Ideas of reflection and the workings of imagination are blended in the term \"merencolie\", embodying for contemporaries \"a tendency\", observes Huizinga, \"to identify all serious occupation of the mind with sadness\".\nPainters were considered by Vasari and other writers to be especially prone to melancholy by the nature of their work, sometimes with good effects for their art in increased sensitivity and use of fantasy. Among those of his contemporaries so characterised by Vasari were Pontormo and Parmigianino, but he does not use the term of Michelangelo, who used it, perhaps not very seriously, of himself. A famous allegorical engraving by Albrecht D\u00fcrer is entitled \"Melencolia I\". This engraving has been interpreted as portraying melancholia as the state of waiting for inspiration to strike, and not necessarily as a depressive affliction. Amongst other allegorical symbols, the picture includes a magic square and a truncated rhombohedron. The image in turn inspired a passage in \"The City of Dreadful Night\" by James Thomson (B.V.), and, a few years later, a sonnet by Edward Dowden.\nThe most extended treatment of melancholia comes from Robert Burton, whose \"The Anatomy of Melancholy\" (1621) treats the subject from both a literary and a medical perspective. His concept of melancholia includes all mental illness, which he divides into different types. Burton wrote in the 17th century that music and dance were critical in treating mental illness.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;But to leave all declamatory speeches in praise of divine music, I will confine myself to my proper subject: besides that excellent power it hath to expel many other diseases, it is a sovereign remedy against despair and melancholy, and will drive away the devil himself. Canus, a Rhodian fiddler, in Philostratus, when Apollonius was inquisitive to know what he could do with his pipe, told him, \"That he would make a melancholy man merry, and him that was merry much merrier than before, a lover more enamoured, a religious man more devout.\" Ismenias the Theban, Chiron the centaur, is said to have cured this and many other diseases by music alone: as now they do those, saith Bodine, that are troubled with St. Vitus's Bedlam dance.\nIn the Encyclop\u00e9die of Diderot and d'Alembert, the causes of melancholia are stated to be similar to those that cause Mania: \"grief, pains of the spirit, passions, as well as all the love and sexual appetites that go unsatisfied.\"\nEnglish cultural movement.\nDuring the later 16th and early 17th centuries, a curious cultural and literary cult of melancholia arose in England. In an influential 1964 essay in Apollo, art historian Roy Strong traced the origins of this fashionable melancholy to the thought of the popular Neoplatonist and humanist Marsilio Ficino (1433\u20131499), who replaced the medieval notion of melancholia with something new: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"The Anatomy of Melancholy\" (\"The Anatomy of Melancholy, What it is: With all the Kinds, Causes, Symptomes, Prognostickes, and Several Cures of it... Philosophically, Medicinally, Historically, Opened and Cut Up\") by Burton, was first published in 1621 and remains a defining literary monument to the fashion. Another major English author who made extensive expression upon being of an melancholic disposition is Sir Thomas Browne in his \"Religio Medici\" (1643).\n\"Night-Thoughts\" (\"The Complaint: or, Night-Thoughts on Life, Death, &amp; Immortality\"), a long poem in blank verse by Edward Young was published in nine parts (or \"nights\") between 1742 and 1745, and hugely popular in several languages. It had a considerable influence on early Romantics in England, France and Germany. William Blake was commissioned to illustrate a later edition.\nIn the visual arts, this fashionable intellectual melancholy occurs frequently in portraiture of the era, with sitters posed in the form of \"the lover, with his crossed arms and floppy hat over his eyes, and the scholar, sitting with his head resting on his hand\"\u00a0\u2013 descriptions drawn from the frontispiece to the 1638 edition of Burton's \"Anatomy\", which shows just such by-then stock characters. These portraits were often set out of doors where Nature provides \"the most suitable background for spiritual contemplation\" or in a gloomy interior.\nIn music, the post-Elizabethan cult of melancholia is associated with John Dowland, whose motto was \"Semper Dowland, semper dolens\" (\"Always Dowland, always mourning\"). The melancholy man, known to contemporaries as a \"malcontent\", is epitomized by Shakespeare's Prince Hamlet, the \"Melancholy Dane\".\nA similar phenomenon, though not under the same name, occurred during the German \"Sturm und Drang\" movement, with such works as \"The Sorrows of Young Werther\" by Goethe or in Romanticism with works such as \"Ode on Melancholy\" by John Keats or in Symbolism with works such as \"Isle of the Dead\" by Arnold B\u00f6cklin. In the 20th century, much of the counterculture of modernism was fueled by comparable alienation and a sense of purposelessness called \"anomie\"; earlier artistic preoccupation with death has gone under the rubric of memento mori. The medieval condition of acedia (\"acedie\" in English) and the Romantic Weltschmerz were similar concepts, most likely to affect the intellectual.\nModern connotations.\nUntil the 18th century, writings on melancholia were mainly concerned with beliefs that were considered abnormal, rather than affective symptoms.\nMelancholia was a category that \"the well-to-do, the sedentary, and the studious were even more liable to be placed in the eighteenth century than they had been in preceding centuries.\"\nIn the 20th century, \"melancholia\" lost its attachment to abnormal beliefs, and in common usage became entirely a synonym for depression. Sigmund Freud published a paper on Mourning and Melancholia in 1918.\nIn 1907, the German psychiatrist Emil Kraepelin influentially proposed the existence of a condition he called 'involutional melancholia', which he thought could help explain the more frequent occurrence of depression among elderly people. He surmised that in the elderly \"the processes of involution in the body are suited to engender mournful or anxious moodiness\", though by 1913 he had returned to his earlier view (first expounded in 1899) that age-related depression could be understood in terms of manic-depressive illness.\nIn 1996, Gordon Parker and Dusan Hadzi-Pavlovic described \"melancholia\" as a specific disorder of movement and mood. They attached the term to the concept of \"endogenous depression\" (claimed to be caused by internal forces rather than environmental influences).\nIn 2006, Michael Alan Taylor and Max Fink also defined melancholia as a systemic disorder that could be identified by depressive mood rating scales, verified by the presence of abnormal cortisol metabolism. They considered it to be characterized by depressed mood, abnormal motor functions, and abnormal vegetative signs, and they described several forms, including retarded depression, psychotic depression and postpartum depression.\nMelancholic depression.\nMedical condition&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Infobox/styles-images.css\" /&gt;\nFor the purposes of medical diagnostic classification, the terms \"melancholia\" and \"melancholic\" are still in use (for example, in ICD-11 and DSM-5) to specify certain features that may be present in major depression, referred to as depression with melancholic features such as:\nA specifier essentially is a subcategory of a disease, explaining specific features or symptoms that are added to the main diagnosis. According to the DSM-IV, the \"melancholic features\" specifier may be applied to the following only:\nIt is important to note, however, that people who suffer from melancholic depression do not need to have melancholic features in every depressive episode.\nSigns and symptoms.\nMelancholic depression requires at least one of the following symptoms during the last depressive episode:\nAnd at least three of the following:\nMelancholic features apply to an episode of depression that occurs as part of either major depressive disorder, persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia), or bipolar disorder I or II. They are more likely to occur in patients who suffer from depression with psychotic features. People with melancholic depression also tend to have more physically visible symptoms such as slower movement or speech.\nCauses.\nThe causes of melancholic depressive disorder are believed to be mostly biological factors that can be hereditary. Biological origins of the condition include problems with the HPA axis and sleep structure of patients. MRI studies have indicated that melancholic depressed patients have issues with the connections between different regions of the brain, specifically the insula and fronto-parietal cortex. Some studies have found that there are biological marker differences between patients with melancholic depression and other subtypes of depression.\nThe research regarding melancholic depression consistently finds that men are more likely to receive a melancholic depression diagnosis.\nTreatment.\nMelancholic depression, due to some fundamental differences with standard clinical depression or other subtypes of depression, has specific types of treatments that work, and the success rates for different treatments can vary. Treatment can involve antidepressants and empirically supported treatments such as cognitive behavioral therapy and interpersonal therapy for depression.\nMelancholic depression is often considered to be a biologically based and particularly severe form of depression. Therefore, the treatments for this specifier of depression are more biomedical and less psychosocial (which would include talk therapy and social support). The general initial or \"ideal\" treatment for melancholic depression is antidepressant medication, and psychotherapy is added later on as support if at all. The scientific support for medication as the best treatment is that patients with melancholic depression are less likely to improve with placebos, unlike other depression patients. This indicates the improvements observed after medication actually come from the biological basis of the condition and the treatment. There are several types of antidepressants that can be prescribed including SSRIs, SNRIs, tricyclic antidepressants, and MAOIs; the antidepressants tend to vary on how they work and what specific chemical messengers in the brain they target. SNRIs are generally more effective than SSRIs because they target more than one chemical messenger (serotonin and norepinephrine).\nAlthough psychotherapy treatments can be used such as talk therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), they have shown to be less effective than medication. In a randomized clinical trial, it was shown that CBT was less effective than medication in treating symptoms of melancholic depression after 12 weeks.\nElectroconvulsive therapy (ECT) was previously believed to be an effective treatment for melancholic depression. ECT has been more commonly used for patients with melancholic depression due to the severity. In 2010, a study found that 60% of depression patients treated with ECT had melancholic symptoms. However, studies since the 2000s have failed to demonstrate positive treatment results from ECT, although studies also indicate a more positive response to ECT in melancholic patients than other depressed patients.\nIt has been observed in studies that patients with melancholic depression tend to recover less often than other types of depression.\nFrequency.\nThe prevalence of having the melancholic depression specifier among patients diagnosed with clinical depression is estimated to be about 25% to 30%.\nThe incidence of melancholic depression has been found to increase when the temperature and/or sunlight are low.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Species are native to the Americas, from North Dakota to northern Argentina, and to eastern Africa (Tanzania, Mozambique, and Madagascar) as well as the Indian subcontinent and Indochina. The generic name is derived from the Greek word (\"mimos\"), 'actor' or 'mime', and the feminine suffix -\"osa\", 'resembling', suggesting its 'sensitive leaves' which seem to 'mimic conscious life'.\nTwo species in the genus are especially notable. One is \"Mimosa pudica\", commonly known as touch-me-not, which folds its leaves when touched or exposed to heat. It is native to southern Central and South America but is widely cultivated elsewhere for its curiosity value, both as a houseplant in temperate areas, and outdoors in the tropics. Outdoor cultivation has led to weedy invasion in some areas, notably Hawaii. The other is \"Mimosa tenuiflora\", which is best known for its use in shamanic ayahuasca brews due to the psychedelic drug dimethyltryptamine found in its root bark.\nTaxonomy.\nThe taxonomy of the genus \"Mimosa\" has gone through several periods of splitting and lumping, ultimately accumulating over 3,000 names, many of which have either been synonymized under other species or transferred to other genera. In part due to these changing circumscriptions, the name \"Mimosa\" has also been applied to several other related species with similar pinnate or bipinnate leaves, but are now classified in other genera. The most common examples of this are \"Albizia julibrissin\" (Persian silk tree) and \"Acacia dealbata\" (wattle).\nDescription.\nMembers of this genus are among the few plants capable of rapid movement; examples outside of \"Mimosa\" include the telegraph plant, \"Aldrovanda\", some species of \"Drosera\" and the Venus flytrap. The leaves of the \"Mimosa pudica\" close quickly when touched. Some mimosas raise their leaves in the day and lower them at night, and experiments done by Jean-Jacques d'Ortous de Mairan on mimosas in 1729 provided the first evidence of biological clocks.\n\"Mimosa\" can be distinguished from the large related genera, \"Acacia\" and \"Albizia\", since its flowers have ten or fewer stamens. Botanically, what appears to be a single globular flower is actually a cluster of many individual ones. Mimosas contain some level of heptanoic acid.\nSpecies.\nThere are about 590 species including:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

While rye is the traditional whiskey of choice, other commonly used whiskies include Canadian whisky, bourbon, blended whiskey, and Tennessee whiskey. The cocktail is usually stirred with ice then strained into a chilled cocktail glass and garnished traditionally with a maraschino cherry. A Manhattan may also be served on the rocks in a lowball glass.\nThe whiskey-based Manhattan is one of five cocktails named for a New York City borough. It is closely related to the Brooklyn cocktail, which uses dry vermouth and Maraschino liqueur in place of the Manhattan's sweet vermouth, and Amer Picon in place of the Manhattan's angostura bitters.\nThe Manhattan is one of six basic drinks listed in David A. Embury's 1948 classic \"The Fine Art of Mixing Drinks\".\nOrigin and history.\nPopular history suggests that the drink originated at the Manhattan Club in New York City in the mid-1870s, where it was invented by Iain Marshall for a banquet hosted by Jennie Jerome (Lady Randolph Churchill, mother of Winston) in honor of presidential candidate Samuel J. Tilden. The success of the banquet made the drink fashionable, later prompting several people to request the drink by referring to the name of the club where it originated\u2014\"the \"Manhattan\" cocktail\". However, Lady Randolph was in France at the time and pregnant, so the story is likely to be fiction.\nHowever, there are prior references to various similar cocktail recipes called \"Manhattan\" and served in the Manhattan area. By one account it was invented in the 1860s by a bartender named Black at a bar on Broadway near Houston Street.\nSome of the earliest records of the cocktail can be found in Charlie Paul's \"American and other Drinks\" and O.H. Byron's \"The Modern Bartender's Guide\", both written in 1884. Paul describes it containing \"three or four drops of angostura bitters, ditto of plain syrup; add half a liqueur glass of vermouth, half wine glassful of Scotch whiskey\" and garnished with lemon. Byron describes two versions, one with French vermouth and the other with Italian. Another early record of the cocktail can be found in William Schmidt's \"The Flowing Bowl\", published in 1891. In it, he details a drink containing 2 dashes of gum (gomme syrup), 2 dashes of bitters, 1 dash of absinthe, &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;2\u20443 portion of whiskey, and &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u20443 portion of vermouth.\nThe same cocktail appears listed as a \"Tennessee Cocktail\" in \"Shake 'em Up!\" by V. Elliott and P. Strong: \"Two parts of whiskey, one part of Italian Vermouth, and a dash of bitters poured over ice and stirred vigorously.\"\nDuring Prohibition (1920\u20131933) Canadian whisky was primarily used because it was available.\nTraditions.\nOn the small North Frisian island of F\u00f6hr, the Manhattan cocktail is a standard drink at almost every cafe, restaurant, and \"get together\" of locals. The story goes that many of the people of F\u00f6hr emigrated to Manhattan during deep sea fishing trips, took a liking to the drink, and brought it back to F\u00f6hr with them. The drink is usually mixed 1 part vermouth to 2 parts whiskey, with a dash of bitters, served ice cold, in an ice cold glass, or with ice and a cherry garnish.\nVariations.\nTraditional views insist that a Manhattan be made with American rye whiskey. However it can also be made with bourbon or Canadian whisky. The Manhattan is subject to considerable variation and innovation, and is often a way for the best bartenders to show off their creativity. Some shake the ingredients with ice in a cocktail shaker instead of stirring it, creating a froth on the surface of the drink. Angostura is the classic bitters, but orange bitters or Peychaud's Bitters may be used. Some make their own bitters and syrups, substitute comparable digestifs in place of vermouth, specialize in local or rare whiskeys, or use other exotic ingredients. A lemon peel may be used as garnish. Some add juice from the cherry jar or Maraschino liqueur to the cocktail for additional sweetness and color.\nOriginally, bitters were considered an integral part of any cocktail, as the ingredient that differentiated a cocktail from a sling. Over time, those definitions of \"cocktail\" and \"sling\" have become archaic, as \"sling\" has fallen out of general use (other than in certain drink names), and \"cocktail\" can mean any drink that resembles a martini, or simply any mixed drink.\nThe following are other variations on the classic Manhattan: \nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The system consists of a variable red giant (Mira A) along with a white dwarf companion (Mira B). Mira A is a pulsating variable star and was the first non-supernova variable star discovered, with the possible exception of Algol. It is the prototype of the Mira variables. The system lies at a distance of .\nNomenclature.\n\u03bf Ceti (Latinised to \"Omicron Ceti\") is the star's Bayer designation. It was named Mira (Latin for 'wonderful' or 'astonishing') by Johannes Hevelius in his \"Historiola Mirae Stellae\" (1662). In 2016, the International Astronomical Union organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalog and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN's first bulletin of July 2016 included a table of the first two batches of names approved by the WGSN, which included Mira for this star.\nObservation history.\nEvidence that the variability of Mira was known in ancient China, Babylon or Greece is at best only circumstantial. What is certain is that the variability of Mira was recorded by the astronomer David Fabricius beginning on August 3, 1596. Observing what he thought was the planet Mercury (later identified as Jupiter), he needed a reference star for comparing positions and picked a previously unremarked third-magnitude star nearby. By August 21, however, it had increased in brightness by one magnitude, then by October had faded from view. Fabricius assumed it was a nova, but then saw it again on February 16, 1609.\nIn 1638 Johannes Holwarda determined a period of the star's reappearances, eleven months; he is often credited with the discovery of Mira's variability. Johannes Hevelius was observing it at the same time and named it Mira in 1662, for it acted like no other known star. Ismail Bouillaud then estimated its period at 333 days, less than one day off the modern value of 332 days. Bouillaud's measurement may not have been erroneous: Mira is known to vary slightly in period, and may even be slowly changing over time. The star is estimated to be a six-billion-year-old red giant.\nThere is considerable speculation as to whether Mira had been observed prior to Fabricius. Certainly Algol's history (known for certain as a variable only in 1667, but with legends and such dating back to antiquity showing that it had been observed with suspicion for millennia) suggests that Mira might have been known, too. Karl Manitius, a modern translator of Hipparchus' \"Commentary on Aratus\", has suggested that certain lines from that second-century text may be about Mira. The other pre-telescopic Western catalogs of Ptolemy, al-Sufi, Ulugh Beg and Tycho Brahe turn up no mentions, even as a regular star. There are three observations from Chinese and Korean archives, in 1596, 1070 and the same year when Hipparchus would have made his observation (134 BC) that are suggestive.\nAn estimate obtained in 1925 from interferometry by Francis G. Pease at the Mount Wilson Observatory gave Mira a diameter of 250-260 million miles (402 to 418 million km, or approximately 290-300\u00a0R\u2609), making it the then-second largest star known and comparable to historical estimates of Betelgeuse, surpassed only by Antares. On the contrary, Otto Struve thought of Mira as a red supergiant with an approximate radius of 500\u00a0R\u2609, while modern consensus accepts Mira to be a highly evolved asymptotic giant branch star.\nDistance and background Information.\nPre-\"Hipparcos\" estimates centered on 220 light-years; while Hipparcos data from the 2007 reduction suggest a distance of 299 light-years, with a margin of error of 11%. The age of Mira is suspected to be about 6 billion years old. Its gaseous material is scattered, as much as one-thousandth as thin as the air around us. Mira is also among the coolest known bright stars of the red giant class, with a temperature ranging from 3,000 to 4,000 degrees Fahrenheit (1,600 to 2,200 degrees Celsius). As with other long-period variables, Mira's deep red color at minimum pales to a lighter orange as the star brightens. Within the next few million years, Mira will discard its outer layers and become a planetary nebula, leaving behind a white dwarf.\nStellar system.\nThis binary star system consists of a red giant (Mira, designated Mira A) undergoing mass loss and a high-temperature white dwarf companion (Mira B) that is accreting mass from the primary. Such an arrangement of stars is known as a symbiotic system and this is the closest such symbiotic pair to the Sun. Examination of this system by the Chandra X-ray Observatory shows a direct mass exchange along a bridge of matter from the primary to the white dwarf. The two stars are currently separated by about 70\u00a0astronomical units.\nComponent A.\nMira A is currently an asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star, in the thermally pulsing AGB phase. Each pulse lasts a decade or more, and an amount of time on the order of 10,000\u00a0years passes between each pulse. With every pulse cycle Mira increases in luminosity and the pulses grow stronger. This is also causing dynamic instability in Mira, resulting in dramatic changes in luminosity and size over shorter, irregular time periods.\nThe overall shape of Mira A has been observed to change, exhibiting pronounced departures from symmetry. These appear to be caused by bright spots on the surface that evolve their shape on time scales of 3\u201314 months. Observations of Mira A in the ultraviolet band by the Hubble Space Telescope have shown a plume-like feature pointing toward the companion star.\nVariability.\nMira A is a variable star, specifically the prototypical Mira variable. The 6,000 to 7,000 known stars of this class are all red giants whose surfaces pulsate in such a way as to increase and decrease in brightness over periods ranging from about 80 to more than 1,000 days.\nIn the particular case of Mira, its increases in brightness take it up to about magnitude 3.5 on average, placing it among the brighter stars in the Cetus constellation. Individual cycles vary too; well-attested maxima go as high as magnitude 2.0 in brightness and as low as 4.9, a range almost 15 times in brightness, and there are historical suggestions that the real spread may be three times this or more. Minima range much less, and have historically been between 8.6 and 10.1, a factor of four times in luminosity. The total swing in brightness from absolute maximum to absolute minimum (two events which did not occur on the same cycle) is 1,700 times. Mira emits the vast majority of its radiation in the infrared, and its variability in that band is only about two magnitudes. The shape of its light curve is of an increase over about 100 days, and the return to minimum taking twice as long. Contemporary approximate maxima for Mira:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nFrom northern temperate latitudes, Mira is generally not visible between late March and June due to its proximity to the Sun. This means that at times several years can pass without it appearing as a naked-eye object.\nThe pulsations of Mira variables cause the star to expand and contract, but also to change its temperature. The temperature is highest slightly after the visual maximum, and lowest slightly before minimum. The photosphere, measured at the Rosseland radius, is smallest just before visual maximum and close to the time of maximum temperature. The largest size is reached slightly before the time of lowest temperature. The bolometric luminosity is proportional to the fourth power of the temperature and the square of the radius, but the radius varies by over 20% and the temperature by less than 10%.\nIn Mira, the highest luminosity occurs close to the time when the star is hottest and smallest. The visual magnitude is determined both by the luminosity and by the proportion of the radiation that occurs at visual wavelengths. Only a small proportion of the radiation is emitted at visual wavelengths and this proportion is very strongly influenced by the temperature (Planck's law). Combined with the overall luminosity changes, this creates the very big visual magnitude variation with the maximum occurring when the temperature is high.\nInfrared VLTI measurements of Mira at phases 0.13, 0.18, 0.26, 0.40 and 0.47, show that the radius varies from at phase 0.13 just after maximum to at phase 0.40 approaching minimum. The temperature at phase 0.13 is and at phase 0.26 about halfway from maximum to minimum. The luminosity is calculated to be at phase 0.13 and at phase 0.26.\nThe pulsations of Mira have the effect of expanding its photosphere by around 50% compared to a non-pulsating star. In the case of Mira, if it was not pulsating it is modelled to have a radius of only around 240\u00a0R\u2609.\nMass loss.\nUltraviolet studies of Mira by NASA's Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) space telescope have revealed that it sheds a trail of material from the outer envelope, leaving a tail 13 light-years in length, formed over tens of thousands of years. It is thought that a hot bow wave of compressed plasma/gas is the cause of the tail; the bow wave is a result of the interaction of the stellar wind from Mira A with gas in interstellar space, through which Mira is moving at an extremely high speed of . The tail consists of material stripped from the head of the bow wave, which is also visible in ultraviolet observations. Mira's bow shock will eventually evolve into a planetary nebula, the form of which will be considerably affected by the motion through the interstellar medium (ISM). Mira\u2019s tail offers a unique opportunity to study how stars like the Sun die and ultimately seed new planetary systems. As Mira hurls along, its tail drops off carbon, oxygen and other important elements needed for new stars, planets, and possibly even life to form. This tail material, visible now for the first time, has been shed over the past 30,000 years.\nComponent B.\nThe companion star is away from the main star. It was resolved by the Hubble Space Telescope in 1995, when it was 70 astronomical units from the primary; and results were announced in 1997. The HST ultraviolet images and later X-ray images by the Chandra space telescope show a spiral of gas rising off Mira in the direction of Mira B. The companion's orbital period around Mira is approximately 497.9 years.\nIn 2007, observations showed a protoplanetary disc around the companion, Mira B. This disc is being accreted from material in the solar wind from Mira and could eventually form new planets. These observations also hinted that the companion was a main-sequence star of around 0.7 solar mass and spectral type K, instead of a white dwarf as originally thought. However, in 2010 further research indicated that Mira B is, in fact, a white dwarf.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Owned and operated by Sealift Incorporated of Oyster Bay, New York, the ship is one of seventeen container\u2014roll-on/roll-off ships in use by the Military Sealift Command, and one of 28 ships assigned to that organization's Sealift Program Office. The ship was previously known as the MV \"Saint Magnus and the MV \"Jolly Indaco.\nCargo equipment.\nThe ship had one large cargo hold with a tween deck that could be set at three different heights. It had a single 800-ton derrick for heavy-lift use. In addition it had a single traveling gantry crane fitted with dual portal cranes, both of which were rated at independently, and could be operated together for lifts up to . For roll-on/roll-off (roro) cargo, the ship had two trailer elevators and roro ramps.\nHistory.\nBuilt as \"Saint Magnus\" at Bremer Vulkan, Bremen, Germany in 1984, \"Virginian\" spent her first years in the commercial shipping service. Ironically, the ship that would later be known for carrying military supplies to the Middle East was accidentally hit by an Exocet missile while off-loading commercial cargo in Iraq in 1986. In these early years, the ship was also renamed \"Jolly Indaco\".\nMSC first chartered the ship, then known as MV \"Strong Virginian\", in 1992. For the next five years, a 500-bed fleet hospital was prepositioned aboard the ship as she carried out a variety of missions for the Department of Defense. Some of its jobs during this time included delivering equipment and supplies to Africa as part of Operation Restore Hope, transporting a bio-safety lab from Inchon, Korea, to Jakarta, Indonesia, and ferrying harbor tugs used by the U.S. Navy from Diego Garcia to Guam and back.\nOn March 14, 1997, the United States Department of Defense announced a new charter for the \"Strong Virginian\". This contract, number N00033-97-C-3007, was a $23,592,099 time charter contract from the Military Sealift Command to operator Van Ommeren Shipping (USA), Inc., of Stamford, Connecticut. Under the contract, the \"Strong Virginian\" was to be used in the prepositioning of United States Army cargo in the Indian Ocean at the island of Diego Garcia. The contract included options which could have brought the cumulative value up to US$47,992,099 and was to expire by March 1999. This contract was competitively procured with 250 proposals solicited and four offers received.\nVirginian was chartered again in 1998 and, for the next four years, the ship was used to support the U.S. Army. Virginian delivered combat craft, tugboats and barges and other elements of the Army's port opening packages. These packages are used to give the military access to rarely used ports in areas vital to U.S. military operations. On September 30, 2002, the ship was released from MSC service and returned to its owner.\nSealift Incorporated bought the ship from Van Ommeren Shipping USA, Inc. taking delivery on June 10, 2003. At that point, Sealift renamed the ship the \"Virginian\". Between November 2002 and May 2006, the \"Virginian\" completed 21 missions for the U.S. military, delivering almost , or nearly 30 football fields, of cargo.\nOn October 16, 2007, the United States Department of Defense announced that it awarded contract N00033-08-C-5500 to Sealift Incorporated. This was a $10,614,000 firm-fixed-price contract plus reimbursables for the \"Virginian\". The ship was contracted to carry containers laden with ammunition to support the global war on terrorism and the United States Central Command. The contract includes options, which, if exercised, would bring the cumulative value of this contract to $39,814,000. If options are exercised, work may continue through October 2011. This contract was competitively procured via Federal Business Opportunities and the Military Sealift Command websites, with more than 200 proposals solicited and three offers received. The U.S. Navy's Military Sealift Command is the contracting authority.\nThe ship was sold for scrap in August 2012 in Singapore and was recycled in Bangladesh that same month.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "20883", "revid": "15881234", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20883", "title": "Mojito", "text": "Traditional Cuban punch cocktail\nMojito (; ) is a traditional Cuban punch. The cocktail often consists of five ingredients: white rum, sugar (traditionally sugar cane juice), lime juice, soda water, and mint. Its combination of sweetness, citrus, and herbaceous mint flavors is intended to complement the rum, and has made the mojito a popular summer drink.\nWhen preparing a mojito, fresh lime juice is added to sugar (or to simple syrup) and mint leaves. The mixture is then gently mashed with a muddler. The mint leaves should only be bruised to release the essential oils and should not be shredded. Then rum is added and the mixture is briefly stirred to dissolve the sugar and to lift the mint leaves up from the bottom for better presentation. Finally, the drink is topped with crushed ice and sparkling soda water. Mint sprigs or lime wedges are used to garnish the glass.\nIn Cuba, the mint used to make mojito is most commonly \"Mentha \u00d7 villosa\" (called or in Cuba) which has a light minty-citrus aroma, but outside of Cuba spearmint, which has a stronger mint aroma, is often used.\nHistory.\nHavana, Cuba, is the birthplace of the mojito, although its exact origin is a subject of debate. It was known that the native people had remedies for various tropical illnesses, so a small boarding party went ashore on Cuba and came back with ingredients for an effective medicine. The ingredients were \"aguardiente de ca\u00f1a\" (translated as \"burning water\", a crude form of rum made from sugar cane) mixed with local tropical ingredients: lime, sugarcane juice, and mint. Lime juice on its own would have significantly prevented scurvy and dysentery, and tafia/rum was soon added as it became widely available to the British (ca. 1650). Mint, lime and sugar were also helpful in hiding the harsh taste of this spirit. Another theory is that it was invented by Sir Francis Drake. The \"El Draque\" cocktail was prepared with brandy. While this drink was not called a Mojito at this time, it was the original combination of these ingredients.\nThere are several theories behind the origin of the name \"Mojito\": one such theory holds that name relates to mojo, a Cuban seasoning made from lime and used to flavor dishes. Another theory is that the name Mojito is simply a derivative of \"mojadito\" (Spanish for \"lightly wet\"), the diminutive of \"mojado\" (\"wet\").\nThe mojito has routinely been presented as a favorite drink of author Ernest Hemingway. It has also often been said that Hemingway made the bar called La Bodeguita del Medio famous when he became one of its regulars and wrote \"My Mojito in La Bodeguita, My Daiquiri in El Floridita\" on a wall of the bar. This epigraph, handwritten and signed in his name, persists despite doubts expressed by Hemingway biographers about such patronage and the author's taste for mojitos. La Bodeguita del Medio is better known for its food than its drink.\nA survey by an international market research company found that in 2016 the mojito was the most popular cocktail in Britain and France.\nVariations.\nIt is said that some hotels in Havana use powdered sugar with the mint leaves rather than granulated sugar as the former dissolves more readily, while many establishments use simple syrup instead. The \"rose mojito\", which is a mojito variation containing the rose-flavored spirit, Lanique, was first created at the Albert's Schloss bar in Manchester, England. A mojito without alcohol is called a \"virgin mojito\" or \"nojito\". The Cojito adds coconut flavor, often through the use of coconut-flavored rum. A dirty mojito calls for gold rum instead of white rum, and raw sugar or demerara sugar. Demerara is a light brown, partially refined, sugar produced from the first crystallization during processing cane juice into sugar crystals. Adding this to a mojito gives it a caramel-like flavor. A dark rum mojito simply calls for a dark rum to be used instead of white.\nIn Mexico, tequila brand Don Julio offers the \"mojito blanco\" by simply replacing rum with tequila.\nIn Peru, there are mojito variations that are made by adding fruits like grapefruit, called \"mojito de toronja\", or with passionfruit, called \"mojito de maracuy\u00e1\". Many restaurants serve them, and these added ingredients enhance the cocktail and its original flavor. Some other fruits are found in other mojito recipes: pears, raspberries, and oranges. Purees of such fruits may also be used instead of the whole fruit itself. The strawberry mojito includes muddled strawberries; a further departure along these lines substitutes gin for the light rum and lemon juice for lime juice, and adds tonic.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Ruling for 40 years, Zahir Shah was the longest-serving ruler of Afghanistan since the foundation of the Durrani Empire in the 18th century.\nHe expanded Afghanistan's diplomatic relations with many countries, including with both sides of the Cold War. In the 1950s, Zahir Shah began modernizing the country, culminating in the creation of a new constitution and a constitutional monarchy system. Demonstrating nonpartisanism, his long reign was marked by peace in the country which was lost afterwards with the onset of the Afghan conflict.\nIn 1973, while Zahir Shah was undergoing medical treatment in Italy, his regime was overthrown in a coup d'\u00e9tat by his cousin and former prime minister, Mohammad Daoud Khan, who established a single-party republic, ending more than 225 years of continuous monarchical government. He remained in exile near Rome until 2002, returning to Afghanistan after the end of the Taliban government. He was given the title Father of the Nation, which he held until his death in 2007.\nEarly life.\nPrince Mohammad Zahir Khan was born on 15 October 1914, in a city quarter called Deh Afghanan in Kabul in the Emirate of Afghanistan, into the royal Musahiban family, who belonged to the Mohammadzai clan of the Barakzai tribe of Pashtuns. He was the son of Mohammad Nadir Shah (1883\u20131933) and Mah Parwar Begum (d. 1941). Nadir was a senior member of the Mohammadzai clan and Commander-in-Chief of the Royal Afghan Army under King Amanullah Khan.\nZahir Khan was educated in a special class for princes at Elementary Primary, built in 1904 by the United Kingdom, and Habibia High School, where many subjects were taught in English. For his secondary education, he went to the Amaniya High School (built during the reign of King Amanullah by France, where many subjects were taught in French. This school was renamed by Nadir Shah as Esteqlal High School) after the fall of King Amanullah. Zahir Khan studied at the Infanterie Military School in the winter (school year in Kabul, 21 March to November). He was then sent to France for further training. He continued his education in France where his father had served as a diplomatic envoy, studying at the Pasteur Institute and the University of Montpellier. When he returned to Afghanistan, he helped his father and uncles restore order and reassert government control during a period of lawlessness in the country. He was later enrolled at an Infantry School and appointed a privy counsellor, later serving in the government positions of deputy war minister and minister of education.\nAncestry.\nZahir's father, Mohammad Nadir Shah, was the son of Sardar Mohammad Yusuf Khan. Born in Dehradun, British India, Nadir's family had been exiled after the Second Anglo-Afghan War. Nadir Shah was a descendant of Sardar Sultan Mohammad Khan Telai, half-brother of Emir Dost Mohammad Khan. His grandfather Mohammad Yahya Khan (father in law of Emir Yaqub Khan) was in charge of the negotiations with the British resulting in the Treaty of Gandamak. After the British invasion after the killing of Sir Louis Cavagnari during 1879, Yaqub Khan, Yahya Khan and his sons Princes Mohammad Yusuf Khan and Mohammad Asef Khan were taken captive by the British and transferred to the British Raj, where they remained forcibly until the two princes were invited back to Afghanistan by Emir Abdur Rahman Khan during the last year of his reign (1901). During the reign of Amir Habibullah they received the title of Companions of the King (Musahiban). Nadir assumed the throne after the execution of the self-proclaimed ruler of Afghanistan Habibullah Kalakani on 1 November 1929.\nReign.\nZahir Khan was proclaimed king (shah) on 8 November 1933 at the age of 19, after the assassination of his father Mohammad Nadir Shah. After his ascension to the throne he was given the regnal title, \"He who puts his trust in God, follower of the firm religion of Islam\". For the first 20 years, he did not effectively rule, instead ceding power to his paternal uncles, Mohammad Hashim Khan and Shah Mahmud Khan, who both served as Prime Ministers. This period fostered a growth in Afghanistan's relations with the international community as during 1934, Afghanistan joined the League of Nations while also receiving formal recognition from the United States. By the end of the 1930s, agreements on foreign assistance and trade had been reached with many countries, most notably with the Axis powers of Germany, Italy, and Japan.\nZahir Shah provided aid, weapons, and Afghan fighters to the Uighur and Kirghiz Muslim rebels who had established the breakaway Turkic Islamic Republic of East Turkestan. The aid was not capable of saving the East Turkestan republic, as the combined forces were defeated in 1934 by the Kuomintang Chinese Muslim New 36th Division of the National Revolutionary Army, commanded by General Ma Zhancang at the Battle of Kashgar and Battle of Yarkand. All Afghan volunteers were killed by Chinese Muslim troops, who then abolished the East Turkestan republic, and reestablished Chinese government control over the area.Despite close relations to the Axis powers, Zahir Shah and his governments refused to take sides during World War II and Afghanistan was one of the few countries in the world which remained neutral. From 1944 to 1947, Afghanistan experienced a series of revolts by various tribes. After the end of World War II, Zahir Shah recognised the need for the modernisation of Afghanistan and recruited a number of foreign advisers to assist with the process. During this period, Afghanistan's first modern university was founded.&lt;ref name=\"10/01\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; A number of potential advances and reforms were derailed as a result of factionalism and political infighting. Zahir Shah also requested financial aid from both the United States and the Soviet Union, and Afghanistan was one of few countries in the world to receive aid from both Cold War adversaries. In a 1969 interview, Zahir Shah said that he is \"not a capitalist. But I also don't want socialism. I don't want socialism that would bring about the kind of situation [that exists] in Czechoslovakia. I don't want us to become the servants of Russia or China or the servant of any other place.\"\nHe was considered a relatively lenient leader compared to previous kings; Zahir Shah had never signed a warrant for the execution of anyone for political reasons during his reign. He also used his power several times to commute capital punishment sentences given to some convicted criminals. At Zahir Shah's behest, a new constitution was promulgated in 1964, which made Afghanistan a modern democratic state by introducing free elections, a parliament, civil and political rights, women's rights, and universal suffrage.\nAt least five Afghani Pul coins during his reign bore the Arabic title (), which means \"The leaner on God, Mohammad Zahir Shah\". The honorific title of \"leaner on God\" is taken from Quran 8:61.\nBy the time he returned to Afghanistan in 2002, Zahir Shah's rule was characterized as a lengthy era of peace.\nExile.\nIn 1973, while Zahir Shah was abroad in Italy, his cousin Mohammad Daoud Khan staged a coup d'\u00e9tat and established an autocratic republican government. As a former Prime Minister, Daoud Khan had been forced to resign by Zahir Shah a decade earlier and felt that Zahir Shah lacked leadership and that the parliamentary system prevented real progressivism. In August 1973, Zahir Shah sent a letter from Rome to Khan in Kabul declaring his abdication, saying he respected \"the will of my compatriots\" after realizing the people of Afghanistan \"with absolute majority welcomed a Republican regime\".\nZahir Shah lived in exile in Italy for 29 years alongside his wife Queen Humaira Begum and other royal family members. Initially, they lived in a three\u2010room apartment on Rome's Via Cassia. Relatives of the 1920s King Amanullah Khan, of the same house of Barakzai, also lived in Rome. President Daoud Khan continued to send money to them in Italy consisting of income from property and estates of the former royal family. After the Saur Revolution, the leftist Khalq government cut all funds to Italy.\nZahir Shah eventually lived in a villa in the affluent community of Olgiata on Via Cassia, north of Rome, where he spent his time playing golf and chess, as well as tending to his garden. He was financially supported by the Shah of Iran since the new Afghan government failed to provide him a monthly salary. The Shah also supported his two sons who were studying in the United States and Canada. He was prohibited from returning to Afghanistan during the late 1970s by the Soviet-assisted Communist government. In 1983 during the Soviet\u2013Afghan War, Zahir Shah was cautiously involved with plans to develop a government in exile. Ultimately these plans failed because he could not reach a consensus with powerful Islamist factions. It has also been reported that Afghanistan, the Soviet Union, and India had all tried to persuade Zahir Shah to return as chief of a neutral, possibly interim, administration in Kabul. Both the Soviet Union and the United States sent representatives to meet him, and President Mohammad Najibullah supported Zahir Shah to play a role in a possible interim government in the quest for peace. In May 1990, Zahir Shah issued a long statement through Voice of America and the BBC calling for unity and peace among Afghans, and offering his services. This reportedly led to a spark of interest and approval among the Kabul populace. However, the idea of a revived political role for Zahir Shah was met with hostility by some, notably radical Islamist Gulbuddin Hekmatyar.\nIn 1991, Zahir Shah survived an attempt on his life by a knife-wielding assassin masquerading as a Portuguese journalist who later revealed that the attempted assassination was ordered by Osama bin Laden. The assassin stated \u201cNow I must kill you\u201d, before stabbing Zahir Shah in his breast-pocket, the former king\u2019s life being saved by a tin of Caf\u00e9 Cr\u00e8me cigarillos. The assassin then stabbed Zahir Shah in the neck several times, before being overpowered by former General Abdul Wali. Zahir Shah was rushed to hospital and later recovered, with the assassin being sentenced to 10 years in a high-security prison in Rebibbia. After the fall of the pro-Soviet government, Zahir Shah was favored by many to return and restore the monarchy to unify the country as he was acceptable to most factions. However, these efforts were blocked mostly by Pakistan's ISI, who feared his stance on the Durand Line issue. In June 1995, Zahir Shah's former envoy Sardar Wali announced at talks in Islamabad, Pakistan, that Zahir Shah was willing to participate in peace talks to end the Afghan Civil War, but no consensus was ever reached.\nReturn to Afghanistan.\nOn 18 April 2002, at the age of 87 and four months after the end of Taliban rule, Zahir Shah returned to Afghanistan, flown in on an Italian military plane, and welcomed at Kabul's airport by Hamid Karzai and other officials. His return was widely welcomed by Afghans, and he was liked by all ethnic groups. There were proposals for a return to the monarchy \u2013 Zahir Shah himself let it be known that he would accept whatever responsibility was given him by the Loya Jirga, which he initiated in June 2002. However he was obliged to publicly renounce monarchical leadership at the behest of the United States. As Pakistan would not accept Zahir as king due to fears regarding his stance on the Durand Line issue; the American government knew allowing him to be restored could result in Pakistan feeling threatened to the point they may cease cooperating with the international coalition and potentially even resume their support for the Taliban. At the time, most delegates to the Loya Jirga were prepared to vote for Zahir Shah and block the U.S.-backed leader of the Northern Alliance, Hamid Karzai. While he was prepared to become chief of state Zahir made it known that it would not necessarily be as monarch: \"I will accept the responsibility of head of state if that is what the Loya Jirga demands of me, but I have no intention to restore the monarchy. I do not care about the title of king. The people call me Baba and I prefer this title.\" Karzai called Zahir Shah a \"symbol of unity, a very kind man\" and a \"fatherly figure.\"\nZahir Shah visited his father's tomb soon after arriving in Kabul and reportedly gasped after witnessing rocket holes and gunfire damage on the tomb caused by the civil war.\nHamid Karzai, who was favored by Zahir Shah, became president of Afghanistan after the Loya Jirga. Karzai, from the Pashtun Popalzai clan, provided Zahir Shah's relatives with major jobs in the transitional government. Following the Loya Jirga he was given the title \"Father of the Nation\" by Karzai, symbolizing his role in Afghanistan's history as a symbol of national unity. This title ended with his death. In August 2002 he relocated back to the Arg, his old palace, after 29 years.\nDuring an October 2002 visit to France, Zahir Shah bruised his ribs after slipping in a bathroom, and on 21 June 2003, while returning to France for a medical check-up, he broke his femur.\nOn 3 February 2004, Zahir Shah was flown from Kabul to New Delhi, India, for medical treatment after complaining of an intestinal problem. He was hospitalized for two weeks and remained in New Delhi under observation. On 18 May 2004, he was brought to a hospital in the United Arab Emirates because of nose bleeding caused by heat.\nZahir Shah attended the 7 December 2004 swearing-in of Hamid Karzai as President of Afghanistan. During his final years, he was frail and required a microphone pinned to his collar so that his faint voice could be heard. In January 2007, Zahir was reported to be seriously ill and bedridden.\nDeath.\nZahir Shah died on 23 July 2007 in the compound of the Arg in Kabul at the age of 92 after a long illness \u2013 34 years after his abdication and nearly 74 years after he ascended the throne. His death was announced by President Karzai, who said \"He was the servant of his people, the friend of his people, he was a very kind person, kind hearted. He believed in the rule of the people and in human rights.\" Karzai also declared three days of national mourning for the deceased king.\nHis funeral, which was held the day after his death, began on the premises of the presidential palace, where politicians and dignitaries paid their respects; his coffin was then taken to a mosque before being moved to the royal mausoleum on Maranjan Hill in eastern Kabul.\nPersonal life.\nZahir Shah was reportedly shy, modest and \"soft-spoken\". He liked photography, chess, and smoking cigars.\nZahir Shah was fluent in Pashto, Dari (his mother tongue) and French, and could also speak English.\nTo Afghan people, he was known as \"Baba\".\nFamily.\nHe married his first cousin Humaira Begum (1918\u20132002) on 7 November 1931 in Kabul. They had six sons and two daughters:\nIn January 2009, an article by Ahmad Majidyar of the American Enterprise Institute included one of his grandsons, Mustafa Zahir, on a list of fifteen possible candidates in the 2009 Afghan presidential election. However, Mustafa did not become a candidate. His granddaughter, Princess Noal of Afghanistan, is the wife of Muhammad Ali, Prince of the Sa'id, the heir apparent to the abolished thrones of Egypt and Sudan.\nTitles and styles.\nDuring his reign, \"His Majesty Mohammad Zahir Shah, King of Afghanistan\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is a thick paste produced by fermenting soybeans with salt and k\u014dji (the fungus \"Aspergillus oryzae\"), and sometimes rice, barley, seaweed, or other ingredients. It is used for sauces and spreads; pickling vegetables, fish, or meats; and mixing with dashi soup stock to serve as miso soup, a Japanese culinary staple food. Miso is high in protein and rich in minerals, and it played an important nutritional role in feudal Japan. Miso is widely used in both traditional and modern cooking in Japan, and as of 2018 had been gaining worldwide interest.\nTypically, miso is salty, but its flavor and aroma depend on the ingredients and fermentation process. Different varieties of miso have been variously described as salty, sweet, earthy, fruity, or savory.\nHistory.\nThe origin of miso in Japan is not completely clear. \nIn the Kamakura period (1185\u20131333), a common meal was made up of a bowl of rice, some dried fish, a serving of miso, and a fresh vegetable. Until the Muromachi period (1337 to 1573), miso was made without grinding the soybeans, somewhat like . In the Muromachi era, Buddhist monks discovered that soybeans could be ground into a paste, spawning new methods using miso to flavor other foods. In medieval times, the word , meaning homemade miso, appeared. Miso production is relatively simple, so homemade versions spread throughout Japan. Miso was used as military provisions during the Sengoku period, and making miso was an important economic activity for of that era.\nDuring the Edo period (1603\u20131868), miso was also called () and () and various types of miso that fit with each local climate and culture emerged throughout Japan.\nToday, miso is produced industrially in large quantities, and traditional homemade miso has become a rarity. In recent years, many new types of miso have appeared, including ones with added soup stocks or calcium, made with beans other than soy, or having reduced salt for health, among other varieties available.\nIngredients.\nThe ingredients used to produce miso may include any mix of soybeans, barley, rice, buckwheat, millet, rye, wheat, hemp seed, and cycad, among others. Lately, producers in other countries have also begun selling miso made from chickpeas, corn, azuki beans, amaranth, and quinoa. Fermentation time ranges from as little as five days to several years. The variety of Japanese miso is difficult to classify but is commonly done by grain type, color, taste, and background.\nMany regions have their own specific variation on the miso standard. For example, the soybeans used in Sendai miso are much more coarsely mashed than in normal soy miso.\nMiso made with rice such as miso () and miso () is called miso ().\nTypes and flavor.\nMiso's taste, aroma, texture, and appearance vary by region and season. Other important variables that contribute to a particular miso's flavor include temperature, fermentation duration, salt content, variety of , and fermenting vessel. The most common flavor categories of miso are:\nAlthough white and red ( and ) are the most common misos available, different varieties may be preferred in particular regions of Japan. In the eastern Kant\u014d region that includes Tokyo, the darker brownish is popular while in the western Kansai region encompassing Osaka, Kyoto, and Kobe, the lighter is preferred.\nA more nuanced breakdown of the flavors is as follows:\nChemical properties of flavor and aroma compounds.\nThe distinct and unique aroma of miso determines its quality. Many reactions occur among the components of miso, primarily the Maillard reaction, a non-enzymatic reaction of an amino group with a reducing sugar. The volatile compounds produced from this reaction give miso its characteristic flavor and aroma. Depending on the microorganism in combination with the variety of soybean or cereal used, many flavor compounds are produced that give rise to the different types of miso. Fermentation products such as furanone compounds, including 4-hydroxy-2(or 5)-ethyl-5(or 2)-methyl-3(2H)-furanone (HEMF) and 4-hydroxy-2,5 dimethyl-3(2H)-furanone (HDMF) are novel flavor compounds of miso. HEMF is especially known for its sweet aroma and is very important for the sensory evaluation of the aroma of rice miso.\nThe unique sensory properties of miso are complex. The key factor in the final product's overall quality is the microorganisms' enzymatic activity. They use the composition of miso (rice, barley, and soybeans) to produce different pigments, flavors, and aroma compounds.\nProteolysis of soybean protein produces constituent amino acids that impart an umami taste that enhances the relatively dull taste of soybean by itself. Soy protein contains a substantial amount of glutamate, the salt of which is known as MSG or monosodium glutamate, a popular ingredient used by food manufacturers to improve the taste of their products. The umami effect of MSG itself is one-dimensional. The umami taste of miso is multidimensional because of the myriad amino acids and fermentation products.\nBarley miso is a traditional farmhouse variety made for personal use. Often called \"rural miso\", domestic barley is used more than imported barley. Containing glutamic acid and aromatic compounds such as ferulic acid and vanillic acid, barley miso is distinguished by a characteristic flavor.\nFermentation.\nMiso's unique properties and flavor profile can be attributed to the compounds produced through the fermentation process. Miso, depending on the variety, consists of a starter culture called (), soybeans, and usually a grain (either rice, barley, or rye). The miso goes through a two-step process; first creating the , and second the is combined with the other components, and the mixture is left to be enzymatically digested, fermented and aged.\nCreating koji.\nKoji is produced by introducing the mold \"Aspergillus oryzae\" onto steamed white rice. This mold culture comes from dried \"A. oryzae\" spores called (, ) or \"starter koji\" and is isolated from plant matter (usually rice) and cultivated. In the past, the natural presence of \"A. oryzae\" spores was relied upon to create koji, but because of the difficulty of producing the culture, is added almost exclusively in both industrial and traditional production of miso. is produced much in the same way as koji, but also has a small portion of wood ash added to the mixture which gives important nutrients to the fungus as well as promoting sporulation.\n\"A. oryzae\" is an aerobic fungus and is the most active fermenting agent in koji as it produces amylolytic, and proteolytic enzymes which are essential to creating the final miso product. Amylolytic enzymes such as amylase aid in the breakdown of starch in the grains to sugar and dextrin, while proteolytic enzymes such as protease catalyze the breakdown of proteins into smaller peptides or amino acids. These both aid in the enzymatic digestion of rice and soybeans. Depending on the strain of \"A. oryzae\", the enzymatic composition varies, thereby changing the characteristics of the final miso product. For example, the strain used to create the sweeter white miso would likely produce a higher content of amylolytic enzymes, while comparatively, soybean miso might have a higher content of proteolytic enzymes.\nTo create optimal conditions for enzymatic production and the growth of \"A.\u00a0oryzae\", the koji's environment must be carefully regulated. Temperature, humidity, and oxygen content are all important factors in maximizing mold growth and enzyme production and preventing other harmful bacteria from producing. Once the koji has reached a desirable flavor profile, it is usually mixed with salt to prevent further fermentation.\nAlthough other strains of fungi have been used to produce koji, \"A.\u00a0oryzae\" is the most desirable because of several properties, including the fact that it does not produce aflatoxin.\nStorage and preparation.\nMiso typically comes as a paste in a sealed container requiring refrigeration after opening. Natural miso is a living food containing many beneficial microorganisms such as \"Tetragenococcus halophilus\", which can be killed by overcooking. For this reason, the miso should be added to soups or other foods prepared just before they are removed from the heat. Using miso without any cooking may be even better.\nUsage.\nMiso is a part of many Japanese-style meals. It most commonly appears as the main ingredient of miso soup, which is eaten daily by much of the Japanese population. The pairing of plain rice and miso soup is a fundamental unit of Japanese cuisine. This pairing is the basis of a traditional Japanese breakfast.\nMiso is used in many other types of soup and soup-like dishes, including some kinds of ramen, udon, , and . Generally, such dishes have the title miso prefixed to their name (for example, ) and have a heavier, earthier flavor and aroma than other Japanese soups that are not miso-based.\nMany traditional confections use a sweet, thick miso glaze, such as and . Miso-glazed treats are strongly associated with Japanese festivals, although they are available year-round at supermarkets. The consistency of miso glaze ranges from thick and taffy-like to thin and drippy.\nSoybean miso is used to make a type of pickle called . These pickles are typically made from cucumber, daikon, napa cabbage, or eggplant, and are sweeter and less salty than the standard Japanese salt pickle.\nOther foods with miso as an ingredient include:\nNutrition and health.\nClaims that miso is high in vitamin B12 have been contradicted in some studies.\nSome experts suggest that miso is a source of \"Lactobacillus acidophilus\". Miso is relatively high in salt which could contribute to increased blood pressure in the small percentage of the population with sodium-sensitive prehypertension or hypertension. Several studies using salt-sensitive hypertensive models and analyzing long-term intake have suggested that miso lessens salt's effects on blood pressure.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was the son of Donald II.\nBiography.\nMalcolm was born in 897, the son of Donald II, who had reigned from 889 until 900. By the 940s, he was no longer a young man, and may have become impatient in awaiting the throne. Willingly or not\u2014the 11th century \"The Prophecy of Berch\u00e1n\", a verse history in the form of a supposed prophecy, states that it was not a voluntary decision that Constantine II abdicated in 943 and entered a monastery, leaving the kingdom to M\u00e1el Coluim.\nSeven years later, the \"Chronicle of the Kings of Alba\" says:\n[Malcolm I] plundered the English as far as the River Tees, and he seized a multitude of people and many herds of cattle: and the Scots called this the raid of Albidosorum, that is, Nainndisi. But others say that Constantine made this raid, asking of the king, Malcolm, that the kingship should be given to him for a week's time, so that he could visit the English. In fact, it was Malcolm who made the raid, but Constantine incited him, as I have said. Woolf suggests that the association of Constantine with the raid is a late addition, one derived from a now-lost saga or poem.\nM\u00e1el Coluim was the third in his immediate family to die violently, his father Donald II and grandfather Constantine I both having met similar fates 54 years earlier in 900 and 77 years earlier in 877, respectively.\nIn 945, Edmund I of England, having expelled Amla\u00edb Cuar\u00e1n (Olaf Sihtricsson) from Northumbria, devastated Cumbria and blinded two sons of Domnall mac E\u00f3gain, king of Strathclyde. It is said that he then \"let\" or \"commended\" Strathclyde to M\u00e1el Coluim in return for an alliance. What is to be understood by \"let\" or \"commended\" is unclear, but it may well mean that M\u00e1el Coluim had been the overlord of Strathclyde and that Edmund recognised this while taking lands in southern Cumbria for himself.\nThe \"Chronicle of the Kings of Alba\" says that M\u00e1el Coluim took an army into Moray \"and slew Cellach\". Cellach is not named in the surviving genealogies of the rulers of Moray, and his identity is unknown.\nM\u00e1el Coluim appears to have kept his agreement with the late English king, which may have been renewed with the new king, Edmund having been murdered in 946 and succeeded by his brother Eadred. Eric Haraldsson took York in 948, before being driven out by Eadred, and when Amla\u00edb Cuar\u00e1n again took York in 949\u2013950, M\u00e1el Coluim raided Northumbria as far south as the Tees taking \"a multitude of people and many herds of cattle\" according to the Chronicle. The \"Annals of Ulster\" for 952 report a battle between \"the men of Alba and the Britons [of Strathclyde] and the English\" against the foreigners, \"i.e.\", the Northmen or the Norse\u2013Gaels. This battle is not reported by the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\", and it is unclear whether it should be related to the expulsion of Amla\u00edb Cuar\u00e1n from York or the return of Eric.\nThe \"Annals of Ulster\" report that M\u00e1el Coluim was killed in 954. Other sources place this most probably in the Mearns, either at Fetteresso following the Chronicle, or at Dunnottar following \"The Prophecy of Berch\u00e1n\". He was buried on Iona. Some versions of the \"Chronicle\", and the \"Chronicle of Melrose\", are read as placing M\u00e1el Coluim's death at Blervie, near Forres.\nIssue.\nThe name of M\u00e1el Coluim's wife is not known; however, it is known he had 2 sons:\nFurther reading.\n\"For primary sources see also\" External links \"below.\""}

He was later nicknamed \"Canmore\" (, lit.\u2009'big head', understood as \"great chief\"). Malcolm's long reign of 35 years preceded the beginning of the Scoto-Norman age. Henry I of England and Eustace III, Count of Boulogne were his sons-in-law, making him the maternal grandfather of Empress Matilda, William Adelin and Matilda I, Countess of Boulogne. All three of them were prominent in English politics during the 12th century.\nMalcolm's kingdom did not extend over the full territory of modern Scotland: many of the islands and the land north of the River Oykel were Scandinavian, and south of the Firth of Forth there were numerous independent or semi-independent realms, including the kingdom of Strathclyde and Bamburgh, and it is not certain what if any power the Scots exerted there on Malcolm's accession. Throughout his reign, Malcolm III led at least five invasions into English territory. One of Malcolm's primary achievements was to secure the position of the lineage that ruled Scotland until the late thirteenth century, although his role as founder of a dynasty has more to do with the propaganda of his descendants than with history. He appears as a major character in William Shakespeare's \"Macbeth\", while his second wife, Margaret, was canonised as a saint in the thirteenth century.\nBackground.\nMalcolm's father Duncan I became king in late 1034, on the death of Malcolm II, Duncan's maternal grandfather and Malcolm's great-grandfather. One Scottish king-list gives Malcolm's mother the name Suthen (Suthain), a Gaelic name; John of Fordun states that Malcolm's mother was a \"blood relative\" (\"consanguinea\") of the Danish earl Siward, though this may be a late attempt to deepen the Scottish royal family's links to the earldom of Northampton (of which Siward was regarded as founder). Later tradition, attested by the fifteenth century, makes Malcolm's mother the daughter of the miller of Forteviot and presents Malcolm as a bastard.\nDuncan's reign ended violently; he was killed in battle in Moray on 15 August 1040, by a force under the command of Macbeth. Duncan may have been young at the time of his death, and Malcolm and his brother Donald were probably children. Malcolm's paternal grandfather was killed in battle in 1045, possibly as part of some continuing conflict with Macbeth.\nAccording to later tradition, Duncan's two young sons were sent away for greater safety \u2014 exactly where is the subject of debate. According to one version, Malcolm's brother Donald was sent to the Isles; and Malcolm was sent to England; based on Fordun's account, it came to be assumed that Malcolm passed most of Macbeth's seventeen-year reign in the Kingdom of England at the court of Edward the Confessor. It is also possible that Malcolm went into exile at the court of Thorfinn Sigurdsson, Earl of Orkney, an enemy of Macbeth's family. Ireland and Strathclyde may be other candidates, but neither the place of exile nor, in fact, exile itself, are certainties.\nAn English invasion in 1054, with Siward, Earl of Northumbria in command, had as its goal the installation of one \"M\u00e1el Coluim, son of the king of the Cumbrians\". This M\u00e1el Coluim was traditionally identified with the later Malcolm III. The interpretation derives from the \"Chronicle\" attributed to John of Fordun, as well as from earlier sources such as William of Malmesbury. The latter reported that Macbeth was killed in the battle by Siward, but it is known that Macbeth outlived Siward by two years. A.A.M. Duncan argued in 2002 that, using the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\" entry as their source, later writers innocently misidentified \"M\u00e1el Coluim\" with the later Scottish king of the same name. Duncan's argument has been supported by several subsequent historians specialising in the era, such as Richard Oram, Dauvit Broun and Alex Woolf. It has also been suggested that M\u00e1el Coluim may have been a son of Owain Foel, British king of Strathclyde perhaps by a daughter of Malcolm II, King of Scotland.\nIn 1057, various chroniclers report the death of Macbeth at Malcolm's hand, on 15 August 1057 at Lumphanan in Aberdeenshire. Macbeth was succeeded by his stepson Lulach, who was crowned at Scone, probably on 8 September 1057. Lulach was killed by Malcolm, \"by treachery\", near Huntly on 23 April 1058. After this, Malcolm became king, perhaps inaugurated on 25 April 1058, although only John of Fordun reports this.\nEarly reign.\nIf Orderic Vitalis is to be relied upon, in the time of Edward the Confessor Malcolm was betrothed to the English king's kinswoman Margaret, and it is possible this happened when he visited England in 1059. If a marriage agreement was made in 1059, it did not stop the Scots plundering Lindisfarne in 1061. It was common practice in medieval Gaelic-speaking societies for kings to launch an invasion, the so-called \"crech r\u00edg\", of a neighbour soon after taking power, and the Lindisfarne raid may have been used to boost the stability of the new regime. Since the invasion affected directly only the territory of the rulers of Bamburgh, it is unlikely to have particularly bothered either King Edward or the ealdorman of Northumbria in York, Tostig Godwinson, who at that time on pilgrimage to Rome and who did not enjoy a good relationship with the Bamburgh family. Malcolm may have had specific political motives. For instance, it has been suggested that he may have been trying to advance the position of Gospatric, his possible cousin, at the expense of the ruling Eadwulfing family. It has also been suggested that the raid may have been part of a dispute about the status of Strathclyde.\nA tradition in the thirteenth-century \"Orkneyinga saga\" related that Malcolm married the widow of Thorfinn Sigurdsson, Ingibiorg, a daughter of Finn Arnesson. Ingibiorg may have died prior to Malcolm's marriage with Margaret. Malcolm may also have discarded Ingibiorg when the opportunity to marry a higher-status lady arose in 1068. The \"Orkneyinga Saga\" also claims that Duncan (Donnchad mac Ma\u00edl Coluim), later king, was a product of this union. Some Medieval commentators, following William of Malmesbury, claimed that Duncan was illegitimate, but this claim is propaganda reflecting the need of Malcolm's descendants by Margaret to undermine the claims of Duncan's descendants, the MacWilliams. Similarly, however, the importance of the MacWilliams to the earls of Orkney around 1200 would have provided an incentive to strengthen the historical ties between the two families, and thus Ingibiorg's marriage to Malcolm may have been created to fabricate common descent.\nThe obituary of a certain Domnall, another son of Malcolm, is reported in 1085; since Domnall has no recorded mother, he may also have been born to Ingibiorg or else to some other unrecorded woman. If historical, Malcolm's marriage to Ingibiorg would have helped create a favourable political position in the north and west. The \"Heimskringla\" tells that her father Finn had been an adviser to Harald Hardrada, king of Norway, and, after falling out with Harald, was then made an Earl by Sweyn Estridsson, king of Denmark, which may have been another recommendation for the match. Malcolm appears to have enjoyed a peaceful relationship with the Earldom of Orkney, ruled jointly by his possible stepsons, Paul and Erlend Thorfinnsson. The \"Orkneyinga Saga\" reports strife with Norway, but this may be misplaced as it associates this with Magnus Barefoot, who became king of Norway only in 1093, the year of Malcolm's death.\nMalcolm gave sanctuary to Tostig Godwinson when the Northumbrians drove him out in 1065 and appears to have offered indirect support to the ill-fated invasion of England by Harald Hardrada and Tostig in 1066, which ended in defeat and death at the battle of Stamford Bridge. In 1068, he granted asylum to a group of English exiles fleeing from William of Normandy, among them Agatha, widow of Edward the Confessor's nephew Edward the Exile, and her children: Edgar \u00c6theling and his sisters Margaret and Cristina. They were accompanied by Gospatric, by this time earl of Bamburgh. The exiles were disappointed, however, if they had expected immediate assistance from the Scots.\nMarriage to Margaret.\nIn 1069, the exiles returned to England to join a spreading revolt in the north. Even though Gospatric and Siward's son Waltheof submitted by the end of the year, the arrival of a Danish army under Sweyn Estridsson seemed to ensure that William's position remained weak. Malcolm decided on war and took his army south into Cumbria and across the Pennines, wasting Teesdale and Cleveland then marching north, loaded with loot, to Wearmouth, now part of the City of Sunderland. There, Malcolm met Edgar and his family, who were invited to return with him but did not. As Sweyn had by now been bought off with a large Danegeld, Malcolm took his army home. Against the backdrop of William's scorched earth policy against the northern English rebels, William sent Gospatric to raid Scotland through Cumbria as a further act of reprisal. In return, the Scots fleet raided the Northumbrian coast, where Gospatric's possessions were concentrated. Late in the year, perhaps shipwrecked on their way to a European exile, Edgar and his family again arrived in Scotland, this time to remain. By the end of 1070, Malcolm had married Edgar's sister Margaret (later known as Saint Margaret).\nThe naming of their children represented a break with the traditional Scots regal names such as Malcolm, Cin\u00e1ed and \u00c1ed. The point of naming Margaret's sons \u2014 Edward after her father Edward the Exile, Edmund for her grandfather Edmund Ironside, Ethelred for her great-grandfather Ethelred the Unready and Edgar for her great-great-grandfather Edgar and her brother, briefly the elected king, Edgar \u00c6theling \u2014 was unlikely to be missed in England, where William of Normandy's grasp on power was far from secure. Whether the adoption of the classical Alexander for the future Alexander I of Scotland (either for Pope Alexander II or for Alexander the Great) and the biblical David for the future David I of Scotland represented a recognition that William of Normandy would not be easily removed, or was due to the repetition of Anglo-Saxon royal names \u2014 another Edmund had preceded Edgar \u2014 is not known. Margaret also gave Malcolm two daughters, Edith, who married Henry I of England, and Mary, who married Eustace III of Boulogne.\nIn 1072, with the Harrying of the North completed and his position again secure, William of Normandy came north with an army and a fleet. Malcolm met William at Abernethy and, in the words of the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\", \"became his man\" and handed over his eldest son Duncan as a hostage and arranged peace between William and Edgar. Accepting the overlordship of the king of the English was no novelty, as previous kings had done so without result. The same was true of Malcolm; his agreement with the English king was followed by further raids into Northumbria, which led to further trouble in the earldom and the killing of Bishop Walcher at Gateshead. In 1080, William sent his son Robert Curthose north with an army while his brother Odo punished the Northumbrians. Malcolm again made peace, and this time kept it for over a decade.\nMalcolm faced little recorded internal opposition, except for Lulach's son M\u00e1el Snechtai. In an unusual entry, for the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\" contains little on Scotland, it says that in 1078:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Malcholom [M\u00e1el Coluim] seized the mother of M\u00e6lsl\u00e6htan [M\u00e1el Snechtai] ... and all his treasures, and his cattle; and he himself escaped with difficulty.\nWhatever provoked this strife, M\u00e1el Snechtai survived until 1085.\nMalcolm and William Rufus.\nWhen William Rufus became king of England after his father's death, Malcolm did not intervene in the rebellions by supporters of William's elder brother Robert Curthose which followed. In 1091, William Rufus confiscated Edgar \u00c6theling's lands in England, and Edgar fled north to Scotland. In May, Malcolm marched south, not to raid and take slaves and plunder, but to besiege Newcastle, where the New Castle had been built by Robert Curthose in 1080. This appears to have been an attempt to advance the frontier south from the River Tweed to the River Tees. The threat was enough to bring the English king back from Normandy, where he had been fighting Robert Curthose. In September, learning of William Rufus's approaching army, Malcolm withdrew north, and the English followed. Unlike in 1072, Malcolm was prepared to fight, but a peace was arranged by Edgar \u00c6theling and Robert Curthose whereby Malcolm again acknowledged the overlordship of the English king.\nIn 1092, the peace began to break down. Based on the idea that the Scots controlled much of modern Cumbria, it had been supposed that William Rufus's new castle at Carlisle and his settlement of English peasants in the surrounds was the cause. It is unlikely that Malcolm controlled Cumbria, and the dispute instead concerned the estates granted to Malcolm by William Rufus's father in 1072 for his maintenance when visiting England. Malcolm sent messengers to discuss the question, and William Rufus agreed to a meeting. Malcolm travelled south to Gloucester, stopping at Wilton Abbey to visit his daughter Edith and sister-in-law Cristina. Malcolm arrived there on 24 August 1093 to find that William Rufus refused to negotiate, insisting that the dispute be judged by the English barons. This Malcolm refused to accept and returned immediately to Scotland.\nIt does not appear that William Rufus intended to provoke a war, but, as the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\" reports, war came:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;For this reason therefore they parted with great dissatisfaction, and King Malcolm returned to Scotland. And soon after he came home, he gathered his army, and came harrowing into England with more hostility than behoved him ...Malcolm was accompanied by Edward, his eldest son by Margaret and probable heir-designate (or t\u00e1naiste), and by Edgar. Even by the standards of the time, the ravaging of Northumbria by the Scots was seen as harsh.\nDeath.\nWhile marching north again, Malcolm was ambushed by Robert de Mowbray, Earl of Northumbria, whose lands he had devastated, near Alnwick on 13 November 1093. There he was killed by Arkil Morel, steward of Bamburgh Castle. The conflict became known as the Battle of Alnwick. Edward was mortally wounded in the same fight. Margaret, it is said, died soon after receiving the news of their deaths from Edgar. The Annals of Ulster say:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Mael Coluim son of Donnchad, over-king of Scotland, and Edward his son, were killed by the French [i.e. Normans] in Inber Alda in England. His queen, Margaret, moreover, died of sorrow for him within nine days.\nMalcolm's body was taken to Tynemouth Priory for burial. The king's body was sent north for reburial, in the reign of his son Alexander, at Dunfermline Abbey, or possibly Iona.\nOn 19 June 1250, following the canonisation of Malcolm's wife Margaret by Pope Innocent IV, Margaret's remains were disinterred and placed in a reliquary. It was claimed that as the reliquary was carried to the high altar of Dunfermline Abbey, past Malcolm's grave, it became too heavy to move. As a result, Malcolm's remains were also disinterred and buried next to Margaret beside the altar. The remains of Margaret and her husband were removed from Dunfermline by Abbot George Durie to safeguard them from the attacks of Protestant reformers; initially they went to the rural estate at Craigluscar then abroad, and by 1580 they were enshrined at the instigation of king Philip II of Spain in the royal monastery of St Lawrence near Madrid, San Lorenzo de El Escorial, where they remain.\nIssue.\nMalcolm and Ingibiorg had three sons:\nMalcolm and Margaret had eight children, six sons and two daughters:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The MTU relates to, but is not identical to the maximum frame size that can be transported on the data link layer, e.g., Ethernet frame.\nLarger MTU is associated with reduced overhead. Smaller MTU values can reduce network delay. In many cases, MTU is dependent on underlying network capabilities and must be adjusted manually or automatically so as to not exceed these capabilities. MTU parameters may appear in association with a communications interface or standard. Some systems may decide MTU at connect time, e.g. using Path MTU Discovery.\nApplicability.\nMTUs apply to communications protocols and network layers. The MTU is specified in terms of bytes or octets of the largest PDU that the layer can pass onwards. MTU parameters usually appear in association with a communications interface (NIC, serial port, etc.). Standards (Ethernet, for example) can fix the size of an MTU; or systems (such as point-to-point serial links) may decide MTU at connect time.\nUnderlying data link and physical layers usually add overhead to the network layer data to be transported, so for a given maximum frame size of a medium, one needs to subtract the amount of overhead to calculate that medium's MTU. For example, with Ethernet, the maximum frame size is 1518 bytes, 18 bytes of which are overhead (header and frame check sequence), resulting in an MTU of 1500 bytes.\nTradeoffs.\nA larger MTU brings greater efficiency because each network packet carries more user data while protocol overheads, such as headers or underlying per-packet delays, remain fixed; the resulting higher efficiency means an improvement in bulk protocol throughput. A larger MTU also requires processing of fewer packets for the same amount of data. In some systems, per-packet-processing can be a critical performance limitation.\nHowever, this gain is not without a downside. Large packets occupy a link for more time than a smaller packet, causing greater delays to subsequent packets, and increasing network delay and delay variation. For example, a 1500-byte packet, the largest allowed by Ethernet at the network layer, ties up a 14.4k modem for about one second.\nLarge packets are also problematic in the presence of communications errors. If no forward error correction is used, corruption of a single bit in a packet requires that the entire packet be retransmitted, which can be costly. At a given bit error rate, larger packets are more susceptible to corruption. Their greater payload makes retransmissions of larger packets take longer. Despite the negative effects on retransmission duration, large packets can still have a net positive effect on end-to-end TCP performance.\nInternet protocol.\nThe Internet protocol suite was designed to work over many different networking technologies, each of which may use packets of different sizes. While a host will know the MTU of its own interface and possibly that of its peers (from initial handshakes), it will not initially know the lowest MTU in a chain of links to other peers. Another potential problem is that higher-level protocols may create packets larger than even the local link supports.\nIPv4 allows fragmentation which divides the datagram into pieces, each small enough to accommodate a specified MTU limitation. This fragmentation process takes place at the internet layer. The fragmented packets are marked so that the IP layer of the destination host knows it should reassemble the packets into the original datagram.\nAll fragments of a packet must arrive for the packet to be considered received. If the network drops any fragment, the entire packet is lost.\nWhen the number of packets that must be fragmented or the number of fragments is great, fragmentation can cause unreasonable or unnecessary overhead. For example, various tunneling situations may exceed the MTU by very little as they add just a header's worth of data. The addition is small, but each packet now has to be sent in two fragments, the second of which carries very little payload. The same amount of payload is being moved, but every intermediate router has to forward twice as many packets.\nThe Internet Protocol requires that hosts must be able to process IP datagrams of at least 576 bytes (for IPv4) or 1280 bytes (for IPv6). However, this does not preclude link layers with an MTU smaller than this minimum MTU from conveying IP data. For example, according to IPv6's specification, if a particular link layer cannot deliver an IP datagram of 1280 bytes in a single frame, then the link layer must provide its own fragmentation and reassembly mechanism, separate from the IP fragmentation mechanism, to ensure that a 1280-byte IP datagram can be delivered, intact, to the IP layer.\nMTUs for common media.\nIn the context of Internet Protocol, MTU refers to the maximum size of an IP packet that can be transmitted without fragmentation over a given medium. The size of an IP packet includes IP headers but excludes headers from the link layer. In the case of an Ethernet frame this adds a protocol overhead of 18 bytes, or 22 bytes with an IEEE 802.1Q tag for VLAN tagging or class of service.\nThe MTU should not be confused with the minimum datagram size (in one piece or in fragments) that all hosts must be prepared to accept. This is 576 bytes for IPv4 and 1280 bytes for IPv6.\nEthernet maximum frame size.\nThe IP MTU and Ethernet maximum frame size are configured separately. In Ethernet switch configuration, MTU may refer to Ethernet maximum frame size. In Ethernet-based routers, MTU normally refers to the IP MTU. If jumbo frames are allowed in a network, the IP MTU should also be adjusted upwards to take advantage of this.\nSince the IP packet is carried by an Ethernet frame, the Ethernet frame has to be larger than the IP packet. With the normal untagged Ethernet frame overhead of 18 bytes and the 1500-byte payload, the Ethernet maximum frame size is 1518 bytes. If a 1500-byte IP packet is to be carried over a tagged Ethernet connection, the Ethernet frame maximum size needs to be 1522 bytes due to the larger size of an 802.1Q tagged frame. 802.3ac increases the standard Ethernet maximum frame size to accommodate this.\nPath MTU Discovery.\nThe Internet Protocol defines the \"path MTU\" of an Internet transmission path as the smallest MTU supported by any of the hops on the path between a source and destination. Put another way, the path MTU is the largest packet size that can traverse this path without suffering fragmentation.\n\"Path MTU Discovery\" is a technique for determining the path MTU between two IP hosts, defined for both IPv4 and IPv6. It works by sending packets with the DF (don't fragment) option in the IP header set. Any device along the path whose MTU is smaller than the packet will drop such packets and send back an ICMP Destination Unreachable (Datagram Too Big) message which indicates its MTU. This information allows the source host to reduce its assumed path MTU appropriately. The process repeats until the MTU becomes small enough to traverse the entire path without fragmentation.\nStandard Ethernet supports an MTU of 1500 bytes and Ethernet implementation supporting jumbo frames, allow for an MTU up to 9000 bytes. However, border protocols like PPPoE will reduce this. Path MTU Discovery exposes the difference between the MTU seen by Ethernet end-nodes and the Path MTU.\nUnfortunately, increasing numbers of networks drop ICMP traffic (for example, to prevent denial-of-service attacks), which prevents path MTU discovery from working. \"Packetization Layer Path MTU Discovery\" is a Path MTU Discovery technique which responds more robustly to ICMP filtering. In an IP network, the path from the source address to the destination address may change in response to various events (load-balancing, congestion, outages, etc.) and this could result in the path MTU changing (sometimes repeatedly) during a transmission, which may introduce further packet drops before the host finds a new reliable MTU.\nA failure of Path MTU Discovery carries the possible result of making some sites behind badly configured firewalls unreachable. A connection with mismatched MTU may work for low-volume data but fail as soon as a host sends a large block of data. For example, with Internet Relay Chat a connecting client might see the initial messages up to and including the initial ping (sent by the server as an anti-spoofing measure), but get no response after that. This is because the large set of welcome messages sent at that point are packets that exceed the path MTU. One can possibly work around this, depending on which part of the network one controls; for example one can change the MSS (maximum segment size) in the initial packet that sets up the TCP connection at one's firewall.\nIn other contexts.\nMTU is sometimes used to describe the maximum PDU sizes in communication layers other than the network layer.\nThe transmission of a packet on a physical network segment that is larger than the segment's MTU is known as jabber. This is almost always caused by faulty devices. Network switches and some repeater hubs have a built-in capability to detect when a device is jabbering.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Mount Baker has the second-most thermally active crater in the Cascade Range after Mount St. Helens. About due east of the city of Bellingham, Whatcom County, Mount Baker is the youngest volcano in the Mount Baker volcanic field. While volcanism has persisted here for some 1.5 million years, the current volcanic cone is likely no more than 140,000 years old, and possibly no older than 80\u201390,000 years. Older volcanic edifices have mostly eroded away due to glaciation.\nAfter Mount Rainier, Mount Baker has the heaviest glacier cover of the Cascade Range volcanoes; the volume of snow and ice on Mount Baker, is greater than that of all the other Cascades volcanoes (except Rainier) combined. It is also one of the snowiest places in the world; in 1999, Mount Baker Ski Area, located to the northeast, set the world record for recorded snowfall in a single season\u2014.\nMount Baker is the third-highest mountain in Washington and the fifth-highest in the Cascade Range, if Little Tahoma Peak, a subpeak of Mount Rainier, and Shastina, a subpeak of Mount Shasta, are not counted. Located in the Mount Baker Wilderness, it is visible from much of Greater Victoria, Nanaimo, and Greater Vancouver in British Columbia, and to the south, from Seattle (and on clear days Tacoma) in Washington.\nIndigenous peoples have known the mountain for thousands of years, but the first written record of the mountain is from Spanish explorer Gonzalo Lopez de Haro, who mapped it in 1790 as \"\". The explorer George Vancouver later named the mountain for 3rd Lieutenant Joseph Baker of HMS \"Discovery\", who saw it on April 30, 1792.\nName and etymology.\nMount Baker is known to the several Indigenous peoples surrounding the mountain by different names.\nThe Nooksack, who live in the closest proximity to the north face of the mountain, have multiple names for different areas of the mountain. The name , meaning \"white mountain,\" refers to Mount Baker as a whole, and specifically, to the glacier-covered summit above 7,000 feet. The open slopes of Mt. Baker, between about 5,000 feet and 7,000 feet, are known as , meaning \"shooting place,\" referring to the act of going hunting up on the slopes. The third main name for the mountain is , meaning \"many meadows,\" refers to the sheltered meadows below around 5,500 feet.\nThe Upper Skagit peoples, who live in the closest proximity to the south face of the mountain along the Skagit River watershed, call the mountain in Lushootseed, which means \"permanently snow-covered mountain.\"\nOther Indigenous peoples, such as the Lummi or Halkomelem-speaking peoples, use names for the mountain borrowed from the Nooksack term, as, due to the distance to the mountain from the core homelands of those peoples, only those closely related to the Nooksack might travel to hunt and gather with them at . Thus, the names for Mount Baker in Lummi and Halkomelem are \"\" and respectively. The name in the nearby Thompson language, , may be a loan from Nooksack or Halkomelem.\nIn the language of the unidentified \"Koma tribe,\" the name is \"Tukullum\" or \"Nahcullum.\"\nThe first Europeans to see and name the mountain were the Spanish. Gonzalo Lopez de Haro was the first European to record the mountain, calling it \"\", meaning \"Great Mount Carmel\".\nThe current English name for the mountain, Mount Baker, was chosen by George Vancouver. Vancouver named the mountain for 3rd Lieutenant Joseph Baker of HMS \"Discovery\", who saw it on April 30, 1792.\nMount Baker is sometimes also known by the alternative English name \"Kulshan\" which is the Anglicized form of the Nooksack name . The other related name, \"Koma Kulshan,\" is likely the Anglicized version of the Nooksack phrase, , meaning \"go up into the mountains to .\"\nHistory.\nPrior to European colonization, the Nooksack and Upper Skagit peoples hunted and gathered on the north and south faces of the mountain.\nFor the Nooksack, Mount Baker is extremely important in traditional religious beliefs, and was historically a great source of wealth (in the form of mountain goat wool, a highly prized commodity) and food. Nooksack families would travel via the North Fork () or Middle Fork () of the Nooksack River to the alpine meadows where they would set up temporary summer camps to dry picked berries and meat. From those camps, people would disperse across the mountain to pick berries or hunt. The high slopes of the mountain were prime territory for hunting deer, elk, mountain goat, bear, marmot, and grouse. Nooksack families held almost exclusive usage rights to the northwestern areas of the mountain, while the usage rights to the southeastern half were held by Skagit families. Certain families of tribes such as the Lummi or Halkomelem-speaking peoples could travel to the mountain if they were intermarried and closely allied with Nooksack families. This meant that some groups which had more hostile relations with the Nooksack, such as the Thompson, were generally barred from the mountain.\nIn 1790, Manuel Quimper of the Spanish Navy set sail from Nootka, a temporary settlement on Vancouver Island, with orders to explore the newly discovered Strait of Juan de Fuca. Accompanying Quimper was first-pilot Gonzalo Lopez de Haro, who drew detailed charts during the six-week expedition. Although Quimper's journal of the voyage does not refer to the mountain, one of Haro's manuscript charts includes a sketch of Mount Baker. The Spanish named the snowy volcano \"\", as it reminded them of the white-clad monks of the Carmelite Monastery.\nThe British explorer George Vancouver left England a year later. His mission was to survey the northwest coast of North America. Vancouver and his crew reached the Pacific Northwest coast in 1792. While anchored in Dungeness Bay on the south shore of the Strait of Juan de Fuca, Joseph Baker made an observation of Mount Baker, which Vancouver recorded in his journal:&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSix years later, the official narrative of this voyage was published, including the first printed reference to the mountain. By the mid-1850s, Mount Baker was a well-known feature on the horizon to the explorers and fur traders who traveled in the Puget Sound region. Isaac I. Stevens, the first governor of Washington Territory, wrote about Mount Baker in 1853:&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nClimbing history.\nFirst European ascent.\nEdmund Thomas Coleman, an Englishman who resided in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada and a veteran of the Alps, made the first attempt to ascend the mountain in 1866. He chose a route via the Skagit River, but was forced to turn back when local Native Americans refused him passage.\nLater that same year, Coleman recruited Whatcom County settlers Edward Eldridge, John Bennett, and John Tennant to aid him in his second attempt to scale the mountain. After approaching via the North Fork of the Nooksack River, the party navigated through what is now known as Coleman Glacier and ascended to within several hundred feet of the summit before turning back in the face of an \"overhanging cornice of ice\" and threatening weather. Coleman later returned to the mountain after two years. At 4:00\u00a0pm on August\u00a017, 1868, Coleman, Eldridge, Tennant and two new companions (David Ogilvy and Thomas Stratton) scaled the summit via the Middle Fork Nooksack River, Marmot Ridge, Coleman Glacier, and the north margin of the Roman Wall.\nGeology.\nThe present-day cone of Mount Baker is relatively young, perhaps less than 100,000\u00a0years old. The volcano sits atop a similar older volcanic cone called Black Buttes, which was active between 500,000 and 300,000\u00a0years ago.\nMuch of Mount Baker's earlier geological record eroded away during the last ice age (which culminated 15,000\u201320,000 years ago), by thick ice sheets that filled the valleys and surrounded the volcano. In the last 14,000\u00a0years, the area around the mountain has been largely ice-free, but the mountain itself remains heavily covered with snow and ice.\nIsolated ridges of lava and hydrothermally altered rock, especially in the area of Sherman Crater, are exposed between glaciers on the upper flanks of the volcano; the lower flanks are steep and heavily vegetated. Volcanic rocks of Mount Baker and Black Buttes rest on a foundation of non-volcanic rocks.\nDeposits recording the last 14,000 years at Mount Baker indicate that Mount Baker has not had highly explosive eruptions like those of other volcanoes in the Cascade Volcanic Arc, such as Mount St. Helens, Glacier Peak, or the Mount Meager massif, nor has it erupted frequently. During this period, four episodes of magmatic eruptive activity have been recently recognized.\nMagmatic eruptions have produced tephra, pyroclastic flows, and lava flows from summit vents and the Schriebers Meadow Cone. The most destructive and most frequent events at Mount Baker have been lahars or debris flows and debris avalanches. Many, if not most, of these were not related to magmatic eruptions, but may have been induced by magma intrusion, steam eruptions, earthquakes, gravitational instability, or possibly even heavy rainfall.\nEruptive history.\nEarly history.\nResearch beginning in the late 1990s shows that Mount Baker is the youngest of several volcanic centers in the area and one of the youngest volcanoes in the Cascade Range. The Pliocene Hannegan caldera is preserved northeast of Mount Baker Volcanic activity in the Mount Baker volcanic field began more than one million years ago, but many of the earliest lava and tephra deposits have been removed by glacial erosion. The pale-colored rocks northeast of the modern volcano mark the site of the ancient (1.15\u00a0 million years old) Kulshan caldera that collapsed after an enormous ash eruption one million years ago. Subsequently, eruptions in the Mount Baker area have produced cones and lava flows of andesite, the rock that constitutes much of the other Cascade Range volcanoes such as Rainier, Adams, and Hood. From about 900,000\u00a0 years ago to the present, numerous andesitic volcanic centers in the area have come and disappeared through glacial erosion. The largest of these cones is the Black Buttes edifice, active between 500,000 and 300,000\u00a0 years ago and formerly bigger than today's Mount Baker.\nModern craters and cone.\nMount Baker was built from stacks of lava and volcanic breccia prior to the end of the last glacial period, which ended about 15,000\u00a0years ago. Two craters are on the mountain. Ice-filled Carmelo Crater is under the summit ice dome. This crater is the source for the last cone-building eruptions\nThe highest point of Mount Baker, Grant Peak, is on the exposed southeast rim of Carmelo Crater, which is a small pile of andesitic scoria lying on top of a stack of lava flows just below. Carmelo Crater is deeply dissected on its south side by the younger Sherman Crater. This crater is south of the summit, and its ice-covered floor is below the summit ice dome. This crater is the site of all Holocene eruptive activity. Hundreds of fumaroles vent gases, primarily H2O, CO2, and H2S.\nLava flows from the summit vent erupted between 30,000 and 10,000\u00a0years ago, and during the final stages of edifice construction, blocky pyroclastic flows entered the volcano's southeastern drainages. An eruption from Sherman Crater 6,600\u00a0years ago erupted a blanket of ash that extended more than to the east. Today, sulfurous gases reach the surface via two fumarole pathways: Dorr Fumarole, northeast of the summit, and Sherman Crater, south of the summit. Both are sites of hydrothermal alteration, converting lavas to weak, white-to-yellow clays; sulfur is a common mineral around these fumaroles. At Sherman Crater, collapses of this weakened rock generated lahars in the 1840s.\nMazama Park eruptive period: 6,600 years ago.\nSource:\nAround 6,600 years ago, a series of discrete events culminated in the largest tephra-producing eruption in postglacial time at Mount Baker. This is the last episode of undoubted magmatic activity preserved in the geologic record. First, the largest collapse in the history of the volcano occurred from the Roman Wall and transformed into a lahar that was over deep in the upper reaches of the Middle Fork of the Nooksack River. It was at least deep downstream from the volcano. At that time, the Nooksack River is believed to have drained north into the Fraser River; this lahar is unlikely to have reached Bellingham Bay. Next, a small hydrovolcanic eruption occurred at Sherman Crater, triggering a second collapse of the flank just east of the Roman Wall. That collapse also became a lahar that mainly followed the course of the first lahar for at least , and also spilled into tributaries of the Baker River. Finally, an eruption cloud deposited ash as far as downwind to the northeast and east.\nHistorical activity.\nSeveral eruptions occurred from Sherman Crater during the 19th century; they were witnessed from the Bellingham area. A possible eruption was seen in June 1792 during the Spanish expedition of Dionisio Alcal\u00e1 Galiano and Cayetano Vald\u00e9s. Their report read, in part:&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;During the night [while anchored in Bellingham Bay] we constantly saw light to the south and east of the mountain of Carmelo [Baker] and even at times some bursts of flame, signs which left no doubt that there are volcanoes with strong eruptions in those mountains. Most of Mount Baker's eruptions that have a confirmed VEI level had a VEI of 2 but two possible eruptions had a VEI of 3.\nIn 1843, explorers reported a widespread layer of newly fallen rock fragments \"like a snowfall\" and that the forest was \"on fire for miles around\". These fires were unlikely to have been caused by ashfall, however, as charred material is not found with deposits of this fine-grained volcanic ash, which was almost certainly cooled in the atmosphere before falling. Rivers south of the volcano were reportedly clogged with ash, and Native Americans reported that many salmon perished. Reports of flooding on the Skagit River from the eruption are, however, probably greatly exaggerated. A short time later, two collapses of the east side of Sherman Crater produced two lahars, the first and larger of which flowed into the natural Baker Lake, increasing its level by at least . The location of the 19th-century lake is now covered by waters of the modern dam-impounded Baker Lake. Similar but lower-level hydrovolcanic activity at Sherman Crater continued intermittently for several decades afterward. On 26 November 1860, passengers who were traveling by steamer from New Westminster to Victoria reported that Mount Baker was \"puffing out large volumes of smoke, which upon breaking, rolled down the snow-covered sides of the mountain, forming a pleasing effect of light and shade.\" In 1891, about of rock fell producing a lahar that traveled more than and covered .\nActivity in the 20th century decreased from the 19th century. Numerous small debris avalanches fell from Sherman Peak and descended the Boulder Glacier; a large one occurred on July\u00a027, 2007. In early March 1975, a dramatic increase in fumarolic activity and snow melt in the Sherman Crater area raised concern that an eruption might be imminent. Heat flow increased more than tenfold. Additional monitoring equipment was installed and several geophysical surveys were conducted to try to detect the movement of magma. The increased thermal activity prompted public officials and Puget Power to temporarily close public access to the popular Baker Lake recreation area and to lower the reservoir's water level by . If those actions had not been taken, significant avalanches of debris from the Sherman Crater area could have swept directly into the reservoir, triggering a disastrous wave that could have caused human fatalities and damage to the reservoir. Other than the increased heat flow, few anomalies were recorded during the geophysical surveys, nor were any other precursory activities observed that would indicate that magma was moving up into the volcano. Several small lahars formed from material ejected onto the surrounding glaciers and acidic water was discharged into Baker Lake for many months.\nActivity gradually declined over the next two years, but stabilized at a higher level than before 1975. The increased level of fumarolic activity has continued at Mount Baker since 1975, but no other changes suggest that magma movement is involved.\nCurrent research at Mount Baker.\nA considerable amount of research has been done at Mount Baker over the past decade, and it is now among the most-studied of the Cascade Volcanoes. Recent and ongoing projects include gravimetric and GPS-based geodetic monitoring, fumarole gas sampling, tephra distribution mapping, new interpretations of the Schriebers Meadow lava flow, and hazards analyses. Mapping of Carmelo and Sherman craters, and interpretations of the eruptive history, continue, as well. The Mount Baker Volcano Research Center maintains an online archive of abstracts of this work, and an extensive references list, as well as photos.\nClimate.\nMount Baker has an alpine tundra climate (ET)\nGlaciers and hydrology.\nEleven named glaciers descend from Mount Baker. Two additional glaciers (Hadley Glacier and Sholes Glacier) descend from lower slopes detached from the main glacial mass. The Coleman Glacier is the largest; it has a surface area of . The other large glaciers\u2014which have areas greater than \u2014are Roosevelt Glacier, Mazama Glacier, Park Glacier, Boulder Glacier, Easton Glacier, and Deming Glacier. All retreated during the first half of the century, advanced from 1950 to 1975 and have been retreating with increasing rapidity since 1980. It is estimated that Baker's glaciers will disappear around 2055 or 2075 due to global warming.\nMount Baker is drained on the north by streams that flow into the North Fork Nooksack River, on the west by the Middle Fork Nooksack River, and on the southeast and east by tributaries of the Baker River. Lake Shannon and Baker Lake are the largest nearby bodies of water, formed by two dams on the Baker River.\nU.S. Navy.\nTwo ammunition ships of the United States Navy (traditionally named for volcanoes) have been named after the mountain. The first was USS \"Mount Baker\" (AE-4), which was commissioned from 1941 to 1947 and from 1951 to 1969. In 1972, the Navy commissioned USS \"Mount Baker\" (AE-34). She was decommissioned in 1996 and placed in service with the Military Sealift Command as USNS \"Mount Baker\" (T-AE-34). She was scrapped in 2012.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In 1987, as a teenage amateur pilot, he flew from Helsinki, Finland, to Moscow, without authorization. According to Russian claims, he was tracked several times by Soviet Air Defence Forces and civilian air traffic controllers, as well as Soviet Air Force interceptor aircraft. The Soviet fighters did not receive permission to shoot him down, and his aeroplane was mistaken for a friendly aircraft several times. Also, 28 May 1987 was Border Guards Day, leaving many guards distracted. He landed on Bolshoy Moskvoretsky Bridge, next to Red Square near the Kremlin in the capital of the USSR.\nRust said he wanted to create an \"imaginary bridge\" to the East, and that his flight was intended to reduce tension and suspicion between the two Cold War sides. Rust was sentenced to four years in a general-regime labour camp for violation of border crossing and air traffic regulations, and for provoking an emergency situation upon his landing. After 14 months in prison, he was pardoned by Andrei Gromyko, the Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, and released.\nRust's flight through a supposedly impenetrable air defence system had a great effect on the Soviet military and resulted in the dismissal of many senior officers, including Minister of Defence Marshal of the USSR Sergei Sokolov and the Commander-in-Chief of the Soviet Air Defence Forces, former World War II fighter pilot ace Chief Marshal Alexander Koldunov. The incident aided Mikhail Gorbachev in the implementation of his reforms, by allowing him to dismiss numerous military officials opposed to his policies.\nMoscow flight.\nRust, aged 18, was an inexperienced pilot, with about 50 hours of flying experience at the time of his flight. On 13 May 1987, Rust left Uetersen Airport, near Hamburg and his home town Wedel, in his rented Reims Cessna F172P, registration D-ECJB, which was modified by removing some of the seats and replacing them with auxiliary fuel tanks. He spent the next two weeks travelling across northern Europe, visiting the Faroe Islands, spending a week in Iceland, and then visiting Bergen on his way back. He later said that he had the idea of attempting to reach Moscow even before the departure, and he considered the journey to Iceland (where he visited Hofdi House, the site of unsuccessful talks between the U.S. and Soviet governments during October 1986) as a method of testing his piloting skills.\nOn 28 May 1987, Rust refuelled at Helsinki-Malmi Airport. He told air traffic control that he was going to Stockholm, and took off at 12:21. Immediately after his final communication with traffic control, he turned his plane to the east near Nummela, Vihti. Air traffic controllers tried to contact him as he was moving around the busy Helsinki\u2013Moscow route, but Rust had turned off all his communications equipment.\nRust disappeared from the Finnish air traffic radar near Espoo. Control personnel presumed an emergency and a rescue effort was organized, including a Finnish Border Guard patrol boat. They found an oil patch near Sipoo where Rust had disappeared from radar observation, and conducted an underwater search but did not find anything.\nRust crossed the Baltic coastline over Estonia and turned towards Moscow. At 14:29 he appeared on Soviet Air Defence Forces (PVO) radar and, after failure to reply to an Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) signal, was assigned combat number 8255. Three surface-to-air missile battalions of 54th Air Defence Corps tracked him for some time, but failed to obtain permission to launch missiles at him. All air defences were readied and two interceptors were sent to investigate. At 14:48, near Gdov, MiG-23 pilot Senior Lieutenant A. Puchnin observed a white sport airplane similar to a Yakovlev Yak-12 and asked for permission to engage, but was denied.\nThe fighters lost contact with Rust soon after this. While they were being directed back to him, he disappeared from radar near Staraya Russa. West German magazine \"Bunte\" speculated that he might have landed there for some time, noting that he changed his clothes during his flight and that he took too much time to fly to Moscow considering his airplane's speed and the weather conditions.\nAir defence re-established contact with Rust's plane several times but confusion resulted from all of these events. The PVO system had shortly before been divided into several districts, which simplified management but created additional work for tracking officers at the districts' borders. The local air regiment near Pskov was on maneuvers and, due to inexperienced pilots' tendency to forget correct IFF designator settings, local control officers assigned all traffic in the area friendly status, including Rust.\nNear Torzhok, there was a similar situation, as increased air traffic was created by a search and rescue operation. Rust, flying a slow propeller-driven aircraft, was confused with one of the helicopters participating with the operation. He was detected several more times and given false friendly recognition twice. Rust was considered as a domestic training airplane defying regulations, and was assigned the least priority by air defense.\nAround 19:00, Rust appeared above Moscow. He had initially intended to land in the Kremlin, but he reasoned that landing inside, hidden by the Kremlin walls, would have allowed the KGB to arrest him and deny the incident. Therefore, he changed his landing place to Red Square. Dense pedestrian traffic did not allow him to land there either, so after circling about the square one more time, he was able to land on Bolshoy Moskvoretsky Bridge by St. Basil's Cathedral. A later inquiry found that trolleybus wires normally strung over the bridge\u2014which would have prevented his landing there\u2014had been removed for maintenance that morning, and were replaced the next day. After taxiing past the cathedral, he stopped about from the square, where he was greeted by curious passersby and asked for autographs. When asked where he was from, he replied \"Germany\" making the bystanders think he was from East Germany; but when he said West Germany, they were surprised. A British doctor videotaped Rust circling over Red Square and landing on the bridge. Rust was arrested two hours later.\nAftermath.\nRust's trial began in Moscow on 2 September 1987. He was sentenced to four years in a general-regime labour camp for hooliganism, for disregard of aviation laws, and for breaching the Soviet border. He was never transferred to a labour camp, and instead served his time at the high security Lefortovo temporary detention facility in Moscow. Two months later, Reagan and Gorbachev agreed to sign a treaty to eliminate intermediate-range nuclear weapons in Europe, and the Supreme Soviet ordered Rust to be released in August 1988 as a goodwill gesture to the West.\nRust's return to Germany on 3 August 1988 was accompanied by huge media attention, but he did not talk to the journalists assembled; his family had sold the exclusive rights to the story to the German magazine \"Stern\" for 100,000\u00a0DM. He reported that he had been treated well in the Soviet prison. Journalists described him as \"psychologically unstable and unworldly in a dangerous manner\".\nWilliam E. Odom, former director of the U.S. National Security Agency and author of \"The Collapse of the Soviet Military\", says that Rust's flight irreparably damaged the reputation of the Soviet military. This enabled Gorbachev to remove many of the strongest opponents to his reforms. Minister of Defence Sergei Sokolov and the commander of the Soviet Air Defence Forces Alexander Koldunov were dismissed along with hundreds of other officers. This was the biggest turnover in the Soviet military since Stalin's purges 50 years earlier.\nRust's rented Reims Cessna F172P (serial #F17202087), registered \"D-ECJB\", was sold to Japan where it was exhibited for several years. In 2008 it was returned to Germany and was placed in the German Museum of Technology in Berlin.\nBecause Rust's flight seemed harmful to the authority of the Soviet regime, it was the source of numerous jokes and legends. For a while after the incident, Red Square was referred to jokingly by some Muscovites as Sheremetyevo-3 (Sheremetyevo-1 and -2 being the two terminals at Moscow's international airport). At the end of 1987, the police radio code used by law enforcement officers in Moscow was allegedly updated to include a code for an aircraft landing.\nAt Saka Manor Park in Estonia, there is a monument dedicated to Rust's flight.\nLater life.\nOn 24 November 1989, while doing his obligatory community service (\"Zivildienst\") as an orderly in a West German hospital, Rust stabbed a female co-worker who had \"apparently rejected him\". He was sentenced to two and a half years in prison, but was released after 15 months. Since then, he has lived a fragmented life, describing himself as a \"bit of an oddball\". After being released from court, he converted to Hinduism in 1996 to become engaged to a daughter of an Indian tea merchant. In 2001, he was convicted of stealing a cashmere pullover and ordered to pay a fine of 10,000\u00a0DM, which was later reduced to 600\u00a0DM. Another legal incident occurred during 2005, when he was convicted of fraud and had to pay a \u20ac1,500 fine. In 2009, Rust described himself as a professional poker player. Most recently, in 2012, he described himself as an analyst for a Z\u00fcrich-based investment bank, dividing his time between Hamburg, Switzerland and Asia, and is training to be a yoga teacher. He said he had plans to open a yoga school in Hamburg.\nPeace activism.\nIn October 2015, \"The Hindu\" published an interview with Rust to commemorate the 25th anniversary of German reunification. Rust opined that institutional failures in Western countries to preserve moral standards and democratic ideals were creating mistrust between peoples and governments. Referring to the genesis of a New Cold War between Russia and the Western powers, Rust suggested that India should be cautious and avoid entanglement: \"India will be better served if it follows a policy of neutrality while interacting with EU member countries as the big European powers at present are following the foreign policy of the U.S. unquestioningly\". He claimed: \"Governments have been dominated by the corporate entities and citizens have ceased to matter in public policy\".\nIn the media.\nIn 2007, for the 20th anniversary of his flight, Rust was interviewed by different media outlets about the flight and its aftermath. \"The Washington Post\" and \"Bild\" both have online editions of their interviews. The most comprehensive televised interview available online is produced by the Danish Broadcasting Corporation. In their interview \"Rust in Red Square\", recorded in May 2007, Rust gives a full account of the flight in English.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "20901", "revid": "48362980", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20901", "title": "Malware", "text": "Malicious software\nMalware (a portmanteau of malicious software) is any software intentionally designed to cause disruption to a computer, server, client, or computer network, leak private information, gain unauthorized access to information or systems, deprive access to information, or which unknowingly interferes with the user's computer security and privacy. Researchers tend to classify malware into one or more sub-types (i.e. computer viruses, worms, Trojan horses, logic bombs, ransomware, spyware, adware, rogue software, wipers and keyloggers).\nMalware poses serious problems to individuals and businesses on the Internet. According to Symantec's 2018 Internet Security Threat Report (ISTR), malware variants number has increased to 669,947,865 in 2017, which is twice as many malware variants as in 2016. Cybercrime, which includes malware attacks as well as other crimes committed by computer, was predicted to cost the world economy US$6 trillion in 2021, and is increasing at a rate of 15% per year. Since 2021, malware has been designed to target computer systems that run critical infrastructure such as the electricity distribution network.\nThe defense strategies against malware differ according to the type of malware but most can be thwarted by installing antivirus software, firewalls, applying regular patches, securing networks from intrusion, having regular backups and isolating infected systems. Malware can be designed to evade antivirus software detection algorithms.\nHistory.\nThe notion of a self-reproducing computer program can be traced back to initial theories about the operation of complex automata. John von Neumann showed that in theory a program could reproduce itself. This constituted a plausibility result in computability theory. Fred Cohen experimented with computer viruses and confirmed Neumann's postulate and investigated other properties of malware such as detectability and self-obfuscation using rudimentary encryption. His 1987 doctoral dissertation was on the subject of computer viruses. The combination of cryptographic technology as part of the payload of the virus, exploiting it for attack purposes was initialized and investigated from the mid-1990s, and includes initial ransomware and evasion ideas.\nBefore Internet access became widespread, viruses spread on personal computers by infecting executable programs or boot sectors of floppy disks. By inserting a copy of itself into the machine code instructions in these programs or boot sectors, a virus causes itself to be run whenever the program is run or the disk is booted. Early computer viruses were written for the Apple II and Mac, but they became more widespread with the dominance of the IBM PC and MS-DOS. The first IBM PC virus in the wild was a boot sector virus dubbed (c)Brain, created in 1986 by the Farooq Alvi brothers in Pakistan. Malware distributors would trick the user into booting or running from an infected device or medium. For example, a virus could make an infected computer add autorunnable code to any USB stick plugged into it. Anyone who then attached the stick to another computer set to autorun from USB would in turn become infected, and also pass on the infection in the same way.\nOlder email software would automatically open HTML email containing potentially malicious JavaScript code. Users may also execute disguised malicious email attachments. The \"2018 Data Breach Investigations Report\" by Verizon, cited by CSO Online, states that emails are the primary method of malware delivery, accounting for 96% of malware delivery around the world.\nThe first worms, network-borne infectious programs, originated not on personal computers, but on multitasking Unix systems. The first well-known worm was the Morris worm of 1988, which infected SunOS and VAX BSD systems. Unlike a virus, this worm did not insert itself into other programs. Instead, it exploited security holes (vulnerabilities) in network server programs and started itself running as a separate process. This same behavior is used by today's worms as well.\nWith the rise of the Microsoft Windows platform in the 1990s, and the flexible macros of its applications, it became possible to write infectious code in the macro language of Microsoft Word and similar programs. These \"macro viruses\" infect documents and templates rather than applications (executables), but rely on the fact that macros in a Word document are a form of executable code.\nMany early infectious programs, including the Morris Worm, the first internet worm, were written as experiments or pranks. Today, malware is used by both black hat hackers and governments to steal personal, financial, or business information. Today, any device that plugs into a USB port \u2013 even lights, fans, speakers, toys, or peripherals such as a digital microscope \u2013 can be used to spread malware. Devices can be infected during manufacturing or supply if quality control is inadequate.\nPurposes.\nSince the rise of widespread broadband Internet access, malicious software has more frequently been designed for profit. Since 2003, the majority of widespread viruses and worms have been designed to take control of users' computers for illicit purposes. Infected \"zombie computers\" can be used to send email spam, to host contraband data such as child pornography, or to engage in distributed denial-of-service attacks as a form of extortion. Malware is used broadly against government or corporate websites to gather sensitive information, or to disrupt their operation in general. Further, malware can be used against individuals to gain information such as personal identification numbers or details, bank or credit card numbers, and passwords.&lt;ref name=\"theregister/2022-raccoon\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nBeyond its use in criminal enterprises, malware has also been deployed as a tool for sabotage, often driven by political objectives. A notable example is Stuxnet, which was engineered to interfere with specific industrial control systems.\nIn other cases, politically motivated malware attacks have targeted entire networks, causing widespread disruption. These incidents have included the mass deletion of files and damage to master boot records\u2014actions sometimes described as \"computer killing.\" High-profile examples include the attack on Sony Pictures Entertainment in November 2014, which involved malware known as Shamoon (also referred to as W32.Disttrack), and a similar strike against Saudi Aramco in August 2012.\nIn 2024, a botnet owner was arrested for engaging in a pay-per-install operation for financial gain.\nTypes.\nMalware can be classified in numerous ways, and certain malicious programs may fall into two or more categories simultaneously. Broadly, software can categorised into three types: (i) goodware; (ii) grayware and (iii) malware.\nMalware.\nVirus.\nA computer virus is software usually hidden within another seemingly harmless program that can produce copies of itself and insert them into other programs or files, and that usually performs a harmful action (such as destroying data). They have been likened to biological viruses. An example of this is a portable execution infection, a technique, usually used to spread malware, that inserts extra data or executable code into PE files. A computer virus is software that embeds itself in some other executable software (including the operating system itself) on the target system without the user's knowledge and consent and when it is run, the virus is spread to other executable files.\nWorm.\nA worm is a stand-alone malware software that actively transmits itself over a network to infect other computers and can copy itself without infecting files. These definitions lead to the observation that a virus requires the user to run an infected software or operating system for the virus to spread, whereas a worm spreads itself.\nRootkits.\nOnce malicious software is installed on a system, it is essential that it stays concealed, to avoid detection. Software packages known as \"rootkits\" allow this concealment, by modifying the host's operating system so that the malware is hidden from the user. Rootkits can prevent a harmful process from being visible in the system's list of processes, or keep its files from being read.\nSome types of harmful software contain routines to evade identification or removal attempts, not merely to hide themselves. An early example of this behavior is recorded in the Jargon File tale of a pair of programs infesting a Xerox CP-V time sharing system:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Each ghost-job would detect the fact that the other had been killed, and would start a new copy of the recently stopped program within a few milliseconds. The only way to kill both ghosts was to kill them simultaneously (very difficult) or to deliberately crash the system.\nBackdoors.\nA backdoor is a broad term for a computer program that allows an attacker persistent unauthorised remote access to a victim's machine often without their knowledge. The attacker typically uses another attack (such as a trojan, worm or virus) to bypass authentication mechanisms usually over an unsecured network such as the Internet to install the backdoor application. A backdoor can also be a side effect of a software bug in legitimate software that is exploited by an attacker to gain access to a victim's computer or network.\nThe idea has often been suggested that computer manufacturers preinstall backdoors on their systems to provide technical support for customers, but this has never been reliably verified. It was reported in 2014 that US government agencies had been diverting computers purchased by those considered \"targets\" to secret workshops where software or hardware permitting remote access by the agency was installed, considered to be among the most productive operations to obtain access to networks around the world. Backdoors may be installed by Trojan horses, worms, implants, or other methods.\nTrojan horse.\nA Trojan horse misrepresents itself to masquerade as a regular, benign program or utility in order to persuade a victim to install it. A Trojan horse usually carries a hidden destructive function that is activated when the application is started. The term is derived from the Ancient Greek story of the Trojan horse used to invade the city of Troy by stealth.\nTrojan horses are generally spread by some form of social engineering, for example, where a user is duped into executing an email attachment disguised to be unsuspicious, (e.g., a routine form to be filled in), or by drive-by download. Although their payload can be anything, many modern forms act as a backdoor, contacting a controller (phoning home) which can then have unauthorized access to the affected computer, potentially installing additional software such as a keylogger to steal confidential information, cryptomining software or adware to generate revenue to the operator of the trojan. While Trojan horses and backdoors are not easily detectable by themselves, computers may appear to run slower, emit more heat or fan noise due to heavy processor or network usage, as may occur when cryptomining software is installed. Cryptominers may limit resource usage or only run during idle times in an attempt to evade detection.\nUnlike computer viruses and worms, Trojan horses generally do not attempt to inject themselves into other files or otherwise propagate themselves. Modern Trojans are often disguised within legitimate-looking applications, making them particularly effective at bypassing basic user awareness and simple antivirus measures.\nIn spring 2017, Mac users were hit by the new version of Proton Remote Access Trojan (RAT) trained to extract password data from various sources, such as browser auto-fill data, the Mac-OS keychain, and password vaults.\nDroppers.\nDroppers are a sub-type of Trojans that solely aim to deliver malware upon the system that they infect with the desire to subvert detection through stealth and a light payload. It is important not to confuse a dropper with a loader or stager. A loader or stager will merely load an extension of the malware (for example a collection of malicious functions through reflective dynamic link library injection) into memory. The purpose is to keep the initial stage light and undetectable. A dropper merely downloads further malware to the system.\nRansomware.\nRansomware prevents a user from accessing their files until a ransom is paid. There are two variations of ransomware, being crypto ransomware and locker ransomware. Locker ransomware just locks down a computer system without encrypting its contents, whereas crypto ransomware locks down a system and encrypts its contents. For example, programs such as CryptoLocker encrypt files securely, and only decrypt them on payment of a substantial sum of money.\nLock-screens, or screen lockers is a type of \"cyber police\" ransomware that blocks screens on Windows or Android devices with a false accusation in harvesting illegal content, trying to scare the victims into paying up a fee.\nJisut and SLocker impact Android devices more than other lock-screens, with Jisut making up nearly 60 percent of all Android ransomware detections.\nEncryption-based ransomware, like the name suggests, is a type of ransomware that encrypts all files on an infected machine. These types of malware then display a pop-up ad informing the user that their files have been encrypted and that they must pay (usually in Bitcoin) to recover them. Some examples of encryption-based ransomware are CryptoLocker and WannaCry.\nAccording to Microsoft's Digital Crimes Unit in May 2025, Lumma Stealer (\"Lumma\"), which steals passwords, credit cards, bank accounts, and cryptocurrency wallets, is the favored info-stealing malware used by hundreds of cyber threat actors and enables criminals to empty bank accounts, hold schools for ransom, and disrupt critical services.\nClick Fraud.\nSome malware is used to generate money by click fraud, making it appear that the computer user has clicked an advertising link on a site, generating a payment from the advertiser. It was estimated in 2012 that about 60 to 70% of all active malware used some kind of click fraud, and 22% of all ad-clicks were fraudulent.\nGrayware.\nGrayware is any unwanted application or file that can worsen the performance of computers and may cause security risks but which there is insufficient consensus or data to classify them as malware. Types of grayware typically include spyware, adware, fraudulent dialers, joke programs (\"jokeware\") and remote access tools. For example, at one point, Sony BMG compact discs silently installed a rootkit on purchasers' computers with the intention of preventing illicit copying.\nPotentially unwanted program.\nPotentially unwanted programs (PUPs) are applications that would be considered unwanted despite often being intentionally downloaded by the user. PUPs include spyware, adware, and fraudulent dialers.\nMany security products classify unauthorised key generators as PUPs, although they frequently carry true malware in addition to their ostensible purpose. In fact, Kammerstetter et al. (2012) estimated that as much as 55% of key generators could contain malware and that about 36% malicious key generators were not detected by antivirus software.\nAdware.\nSome types of adware turn off anti-malware and virus protection; technical remedies are available.\nSpyware.\nPrograms designed to monitor users' web browsing, display unsolicited advertisements, or redirect affiliate marketing revenues are called spyware. Spyware programs do not spread like viruses; instead they are generally installed by exploiting security holes. They can also be hidden and packaged together with unrelated user-installed software. The Sony BMG rootkit was intended to prevent illicit copying; but also reported on users' listening habits, and unintentionally created extra security vulnerabilities.\nDetection.\nAntivirus software typically uses two techniques to detect malware: (i) static analysis and (ii) dynamic/heuristic analysis. Static analysis involves studying the software code of a potentially malicious program and producing a signature of that program. This information is then used to compare scanned files by an antivirus program. Because this approach is not useful for malware that has not yet been studied, antivirus software can use dynamic analysis to monitor how the program runs on a computer and block it if it performs unexpected activity.\nThe aim of any malware is to conceal itself from detection by users or antivirus software. Detecting potential malware is difficult for two reasons. The first is that it is difficult to determine if software is malicious. The second is that malware uses technical measures to make it more difficult to detect it. An estimated 33% of malware is not detected by antivirus software.\nThe most commonly employed anti-detection technique involves encrypting the malware payload in order to prevent antivirus software from recognizing the signature. Tools such as crypters come with an encrypted blob of malicious code and a decryption stub. The stub decrypts the blob and loads it into memory. Because antivirus does not typically scan memory and only scans files on the drive, this allows the malware to evade detection. Advanced malware has the ability to transform itself into different variations, making it less likely to be detected due to the differences in its signatures. This is known as polymorphic malware. Other common techniques used to evade detection include, from common to uncommon: (1) evasion of analysis and detection by fingerprinting the environment when executed; (2) confusing automated tools' detection methods. This allows malware to avoid detection by technologies such as signature-based antivirus software by changing the server used by the malware; (3) timing-based evasion. This is when malware runs at certain times or following certain actions taken by the user, so it executes during certain vulnerable periods, such as during the boot process, while remaining dormant the rest of the time; (4) obfuscating internal data so that automated tools do not detect the malware; (v) information hiding techniques, namely stegomalware; and (5) fileless malware which runs within memory instead of using files and utilizes existing system tools to carry out malicious acts. The use of existing binaries to carry out malicious activities is a technique known as LotL, or Living off the Land. This reduces the amount of forensic artifacts available to analyze. Recently these types of attacks have become more frequent with a 432% increase in 2017 and makeup 35% of the attacks in 2018. Such attacks are not easy to perform but are becoming more prevalent with the help of exploit-kits.\nRisks.\nVulnerable software.\nA vulnerability is a weakness, flaw or software bug in an application, a complete computer, an operating system, or a computer network that is exploited by malware to bypass defences or gain privileges it requires to run. For example, TestDisk 6.4 or earlier contained a vulnerability that allowed attackers to inject code into Windows. Malware can exploit security defects (security bugs or vulnerabilities) in the operating system, applications (such as browsers, e.g. older versions of Microsoft Internet Explorer supported by Windows XP), or in vulnerable versions of browser plugins such as Adobe Flash Player, Adobe Acrobat or Reader, or Java SE. For example, a common method is exploitation of a buffer overrun vulnerability, where software designed to store data in a specified region of memory does not prevent more data than the buffer can accommodate from being supplied. Malware may provide data that overflows the buffer, with malicious executable code or data after the end; when this payload is accessed it does what the attacker, not the legitimate software, determines.\nMalware can exploit recently discovered vulnerabilities before developers have had time to release a suitable patch. Even when new patches addressing the vulnerability have been released, they may not necessarily be installed immediately, allowing malware to take advantage of systems lacking patches. Sometimes even applying patches or installing new versions does not automatically uninstall the old versions.\nThere are several ways the users can stay informed and protected from security vulnerabilities in software.\nSoftware providers often announce updates that address security issues. \nCommon vulnerabilities are assigned unique identifiers (CVE IDs) and listed in public databases like the National Vulnerability Database.\nTools like Secunia PSI, free for personal use, can scan a computer for outdated software with known vulnerabilities and attempt to update them.\nFirewalls and intrusion prevention systems can monitor the network traffic for suspicious activity that might indicate an attack.\nExcessive privileges.\nUsers and programs can be assigned more privileges than they require, and malware can take advantage of this. For example, of 940 Android apps sampled, one third of them asked for more privileges than they required. Apps targeting the Android platform can be a major source of malware infection but one solution is to use third-party software to detect apps that have been assigned excessive privileges.\nSome systems allow all users to make changes to the core components or settings of the system, which is considered over-privileged access today. This was the standard operating procedure for early microcomputer and home computer systems, where there was no distinction between an \"administrator\" or \"root\", and a regular user of the system. In some systems, non-administrator users are over-privileged by design, in the sense that they are allowed to modify internal structures of the system. In some environments, users are over-privileged because they have been inappropriately granted administrator or equivalent status. This can be because users tend to demand more privileges than they need, so often end up being assigned unnecessary privileges.\nSome systems allow code executed by a user to access all rights of that user, which is known as over-privileged code. This was also standard operating procedure for early microcomputer and home computer systems. Malware, running as over-privileged code, can use this privilege to subvert the system. Almost all currently popular operating systems, and also many scripting applications allow code too many privileges, usually in the sense that when a user executes code, the system allows that code all rights of that user.\nWeak passwords.\nA credential attack occurs when a user account with administrative privileges is cracked and that account is used to provide malware with appropriate privileges. Typically, the attack succeeds because the weakest form of account security is used, which is typically a short password that can be cracked using a dictionary or brute force attack. Using strong passwords and enabling two-factor authentication can reduce this risk. With the latter enabled, even if an attacker can crack the password, they cannot use the account without also having the token possessed by the legitimate user of that account.\nUse of the same operating system.\nHomogeneity can be a vulnerability. For example, when all computers in a network run the same operating system, upon exploiting one, one worm can exploit them all: In particular, Microsoft Windows or Mac OS X have such a large share of the market that an exploited vulnerability concentrating on either operating system could subvert a large number of systems. It is estimated that approximately 83% of malware infections between January and March 2020 were spread via systems running Windows 10. This risk is mitigated by segmenting the networks into different subnetworks and setting up firewalls to block traffic between them.\nMitigation.\nAntivirus / Anti-malware software.\nAnti-malware (sometimes also called antivirus) programs block and remove some or all types of malware. For example, Microsoft Security Essentials (for Windows XP, Vista, and Windows 7) and Windows Defender (for Windows 8, 10 and 11) provide real-time protection. The Windows Malicious Software Removal Tool removes malicious software from the system. Additionally, several capable antivirus software programs are available for free download from the Internet (usually restricted to non-commercial use). Tests found some free programs to be competitive with commercial ones.\nTypically, antivirus software can combat malware in the following ways:\nReal-time protection.\nA specific component of anti-malware software, commonly referred to as an on-access or real-time scanner, hooks deep into the operating system's core or kernel and functions in a manner similar to how certain malware itself would attempt to operate, though with the user's informed permission for protecting the system. Any time the operating system accesses a file, the on-access scanner checks if the file is infected or not. Typically, when an infected file is found, execution is stopped and the file is quarantined to prevent further damage with the intention to prevent irreversible system damage. Most AVs allow users to override this behaviour. This can have a considerable performance impact on the operating system, though the degree of impact is dependent on how many pages it creates in virtual memory.\nSandboxing.\nSandboxing is a security model that confines applications within a controlled environment, restricting their operations to authorized \"safe\" actions and isolating them from other applications on the host. It also limits access to system resources like memory and the file system to maintain isolation.\nBrowser sandboxing is a security measure that isolates web browser processes and tabs from the operating system to prevent malicious code from exploiting vulnerabilities.\nIt helps protect against malware, zero-day exploits, and unintentional data leaks by trapping potentially harmful code within the sandbox.\nIt involves creating separate processes, limiting access to system resources, running web content in isolated processes, monitoring system calls, and memory constraints.\nInter-process communication (IPC) is used for secure communication between processes.\nEscaping the sandbox involves targeting vulnerabilities in the sandbox mechanism or the operating system's sandboxing features.\nWhile sandboxing is not foolproof, it significantly reduces the attack surface of common threats.\nKeeping browsers and operating systems updated is crucial to mitigate vulnerabilities.\nWebsite security scans.\nWebsite vulnerability scans check the website, detect malware, may note outdated software, and may report known security issues, in order to reduce the risk of the site being compromised.\nNetwork Segregation.\nStructuring a network as a set of smaller networks, and limiting the flow of traffic between them to that known to be legitimate, can hinder the ability of infectious malware to replicate itself across the wider network. Software-defined networking provides techniques to implement such controls.\n\"Air gap\" isolation or \"parallel network\".\nAs a last resort, computers can be protected from malware, and the risk of infected computers disseminating trusted information can be greatly reduced by imposing an \"air gap\" (i.e. completely disconnecting them from all other networks) and applying enhanced controls over the entry and exit of software and data from the outside world. However, malware can still cross the air gap in some situations, not least due to the need to introduce software into the air-gapped network and can damage the availability or integrity of assets thereon. Stuxnet is an example of malware that is introduced to the target environment via a USB drive, causing damage to processes supported on the environment without the need to exfiltrate data.\nAirHopper, BitWhisper, GSMem and Fansmitter are four techniques introduced by researchers that can leak data from air-gapped computers using electromagnetic, thermal and acoustic emissions.\nResearch.\nUtilizing bibliometric analysis, the study of malware research trends from 2005 to 2015, considering criteria such as impact journals, highly cited articles, research areas, number of publications, keyword frequency, institutions, and authors, revealed an annual growth rate of 34.1%. North America led in research output, followed by Asia and Europe. China and India were identified as emerging contributors.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Averaging over six wickets per Test match, he is widely regarded as one of the greatest players in the history of the sport. He is the only bowler to take 800 Test wickets and more than 530 One Day International (ODI) wickets. As of 2025[ [update]], he has taken more wickets in international cricket than any other bowler. Muralitharan was a part of the Sri Lankan team that won the 1996 Cricket World Cup and the team which was joint-winners with India of the 2002 ICC Champions Trophy.\nMuralitharan's international career was beset by controversy over his bowling action. Due to an unusual hyperextension of his congenitally bent arm during delivery, his bowling action was called into question on a number of occasions by umpires and sections of the cricket community. After biomechanical analysis under simulated playing conditions, Muralitharan's action was cleared by the International Cricket Council, first in 1996 and again in 1999.\nMuralitharan held the number one spot in the International Cricket Council's player rankings for Test bowlers for a record period of 1,711 days spanning 214 Test matches. He became the highest wicket-taker in Test cricket when he overtook the previous record-holder Shane Warne on 3 December 2007. Muralitharan had previously held the record when he surpassed Courtney Walsh's 519 wickets in 2004, but he suffered a shoulder injury later that year and was overtaken by Warne. Muralitharan took the wicket of Gautam Gambhir on 5 February 2009 in Colombo to surpass Wasim Akram's ODI record of 502 wickets. He retired from Test cricket in 2010, registering his 800th and final wicket on 22 July 2010 from his final ball in his last Test match.&lt;ref name=\"bbc-12/13/02\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nMuralitharan was rated the greatest Test match bowler by \"Wisden's Cricketers' Almanack\" in 2002, and in 2017 was the first Sri Lankan cricketer to be inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame. He won the Ada Derana Sri Lankan of the Year award in 2017.\nEarly years and personal life.\nMuralitharan was born 17 April 1972 to a Hill Country Tamil Hindu family in Kandy, Sri Lanka, the eldest of the four sons to Sinnasamy Muttiah and Lakshmi. Muralitharan's father, Sinnasamy Muttiah, runs a successful biscuit-making business. Muralitharan's paternal grandfather, Periyasamy Sinasamy, came from South India to work in the tea plantations of central Sri Lanka in 1920.&lt;ref name=\"Telegraph, UK,-09/12/07\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Sinasamy later returned to the country of his birth with his daughters and settled in Tiruchirappalli, Tamil Nadu, India. However, his sons, including Muralitharan's father Muttiah, remained in Sri Lanka.\nWhen he was nine years old, Muralitharan was sent to St. Anthony's College, Kandy, a private school run by Benedictine monks. He began his cricketing career as a medium pace bowler but on the advice of his school coach, Sunil Fernando, he took up off-spin when he was fourteen years old. He soon impressed and went on to play for four years in the school First XI. In those days he played as an all-rounder and batted in the middle order. In his final two seasons at St Anthony's College he took over one hundred wickets and in 1990\u201391 was named as the 'Bata Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year'.\nAfter leaving school he joined Tamil Union Cricket and Athletic Club and was selected for the Sri Lanka A tour of England in 1991. He played in five games but failed to capture a single wicket. On his return to Sri Lanka he impressed against Allan Border's Australian team in a practice game and then went on to make his Test debut at R. Premadasa Stadium in the Second Test match of the series.\nWhen his grandfather died at the age of 104 in July 2004, Muralitharan returned home from Asia Cup to attend his funeral. Periyasamy Sinasamy's first wish to see Muralitharan claiming the world record for the most Test wickets was realised (passing the record set by Courtney Walsh), but not his desire to live to see his grandson married. Muralitharan's grandmother had died one month earlier at the age of 97. Muralitharan's manager, Kushil Gunasekera, stated that \"Murali's family is closely knit and united. They respect traditional values. The late grandfather enjoyed a great relationship with Murali.\"\nMuralitharan married Madhimalar Ramamurthy, a Chennai native, on 21 March 2005.&lt;ref name=\"tribune-2/3/05\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Madhimalar is the daughter of the late Dr S. Ramamurthy of Malar Hospitals, and his wife Dr Nithya Ramamurthy. Their first child, Naren, was born in January 2006.\nMuttiah Muralitharan holds Overseas Citizenship of India (OCI) and he does not need a visa for travelling to India. According to his manager, Kushil Gunasekera, Muralitharan qualifies for this status because his family originates from India. Muttiah announced on 3 April 2011 that he was retiring from all sport.\nSpelling of name.\nEven though his name was widely romanised as Muralitharan from the start of his career, he prefers the spelling Muralidaran. The different spellings have arisen because the Tamil letter \u0ba4 can be pronounced as both 't' and 'd' depending on its place in a word. It is often transliterated as 'th' to distinguish it from another letter, \u0b9f, which is a retroflex 't' or 'd'. In 2007, when Cricket Australia decided to unveil the new Warne-Muralidaran Trophy, to be contested between Australia and Sri Lanka, Muralitharan was requested to clarify how his name should be spelt. Cricket Australia spokesman Peter Young confirmed that \"the spelling he's given is Muralidaran\".\nThe first-day cover involving Muralitharan bears an official seal captioned as \"The highest wicket taker in Test cricket, MUTHIAH MURALIDARAN, First Day of Issue 03.12.2007, Camp Post Office, Asgiriya International Cricket Stadium, Kandy\".\nDomestic cricket.\nIn Sri Lanka.\nIn domestic cricket, Muralitharan played for two first-class Sri Lankan sides, Tamil Union Cricket and Athletic Club in the Premier Trophy and Central Province in the Provincial Championship. His record is exceptional \u2013 234 wickets at 14.51 runs in 46 matches.\nIn England.\nHe also played county cricket in England, mainly for Lancashire (1999, 2001, 2005 and 2007), appearing in twenty-eight first-class games for the club. He played five first class games for Kent during the 2003 season. His bowling record in English domestic cricket is also exceptional \u2013 236 wickets at 15.62 runs in 33 matches. Despite his efforts, he was never on a title-winning first-class domestic team in either the Premier Trophy or the County Championship. He was unusual amongst his contemporaries in that he played in more Test matches than other first-class games (116 Tests and 99 other first-class matches as of 30 November 2007). Muralitharan was signed by Gloucestershire in 2011 to play in T20 matches. He renewed his T20 contract with Gloucestershire in 2012, but did not stay on for the 2013 season.\nIn India.\nMuralitharan was contracted to represent Bengal in the 2008\u201309 Ranji Trophy tournament. He was expected to play about four matches in the tournament's second division \u2013 the Plate League.\nIn February 2008, Muralitharan was slated to play Twenty20 cricket for the Chennai Super Kings in the Indian Premier League (IPL). He was bought for $600,000 by India Cements, the Chennai franchisee of the IPL, through a bidding process. The Chennai Super Kings were the runners-up in the inaugural edition of the IPL, losing to the Rajasthan Royals in the final. Muralitharan captured 11 wickets in 15 games, at an economy rate of 6.96 an over. In 2010, in the third season of IPL, Muralitharan was part of the Chennai Super Kings side that won the IPL championship. Muralitharan also remained the side's leading wicket-taker after all the three tournaments.\nAt the 2011 IPL Player Auction Muralitharan was bought by Kochi Tuskers Kerala for US$1.1\u00a0million.\nIn the 2012 season Muralitharan moved to Royal Challengers Bangalore, where he took 14 wickets in 9 games and had an average economy rate of 6.38. He played for Royal Challengers Bangalore from 2012 to 2014. He decided to retire from the IPL in 2014.\nIn 2015, Muralitharan was appointed as the bowling coach and mentor of the IPL team Sunrisers Hyderabad.\nIn Australia.\nMuttiah Muralitharan signed for the Melbourne Renegades to play Twenty20 cricket in the Big Bash League in 2012. He stated, \"I wanted to play one season in Australia and the opportunity from the Melbourne Renegades was there so I took it with both hands.\"\nInternational career.\nBowling style and career progress.\nMuralitharan is the first wrist-spinning off-spinner in the history of the game.\nHe bowls marathon spells, yet he is usually on the attack. His unique bowling action begins with a short run-up, and culminates with an open-chested extremely wristy release from a partly supinated forearm which had him mistaken for a leg-spinner early in his career by Allan Border. Aside from his stock delivery, the off-break, of which he claimed to have two variations (during a recorded television 'doosra' show off with Mark Nicholas from Channel 4 in 2004), his main deliveries are a fast topspinner which lands on the seam and usually goes straight on, and the doosra, a surprise delivery which turns from leg to off (the opposite direction of his stock delivery) with no easily discernible change of action.&lt;ref name=\"Muttiah Muralitharan - Legend / The Genius\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, he would occasionally use one of his several unnamed novelties. His super-flexible wrist makes him especially potent and guarantees him turn on any surface.\nFrom his debut in 1992, Muralitharan took 800 Test wickets and over 500 One Day International wickets, becoming the first player to take 1,000 wickets combined in the two main forms of international cricket.\nTest cricket.\nEmerging years.\nOn 28 August 1992 at the age of 20, Muralitharan made his debut against Australia at the Khettarama Stadium and claimed 3 for 141. Craig McDermott was his first Test wicket.\nIn August 1993 at Moratuwa, Muralitharan captured 5 for 104 in South Africa's first innings, his first five-wicket haul in Tests. His wickets included Kepler Wessels, Hansie Cronje and Jonty Rhodes.\nPrior to the eventful Boxing Day Test of 1995, Muralitharan had captured 80 wickets in 22 Tests at an unflattering average of 32.74. Even at that point in his career he was the leading wicket taker for Sri Lanka having gone past Rumesh Ratnayake's aggregate of 73 wickets.\nBoxing Day Test 1995.\nDuring the second Test between Sri Lanka and Australia at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on Boxing Day 1995, Australian umpire Darrell Hair called Muralitharan for throwing in front of a crowd of 55,239. The off-spinner was no-balled seven times in three overs by Hair, who believed the then 23-year-old was bending his arm and straightening it in the process of delivery; an illegal action in cricket.\nMuralitharan had bowled two overs before lunch from umpire Steve Dunne's or the Members' End of the ground with umpire Hair at square leg and these passed without incident. At 2:34\u00a0pm he took up the attack from umpire Hair's or the southern end. Muralitharan's third over was a maiden with all deliveries again passed as legitimate but in his fourth Hair no-balled him twice for throwing on the fourth and sixth balls. The umpire continued to call him three times in his fifth over on the second, fourth and sixth balls. While the bowler stood with his hands on his hips perplexed, the five calls provoked an immediate response by the Sri Lankan captain Arjuna Ranatunga who left the field at 3:03\u00a0pm to take advice from his team management. He returned at 3:08\u00a0pm and continued with Muralitharan who was called two more times in his sixth over on the second and sixth balls. At 3:17\u00a0pm Ranatunga removed the bowler from the attack, although he reintroduced him at 3:30\u00a0pm at umpire Dunne's end. Although Hair reports in his book, \"Decision Maker\", that at the end of the tea break he stated that he would call Muralitharan no matter which end he bowled he did not do so. Muralitharan completed another twelve overs without further no-balls and, after bowling Mark Waugh, finished the day with figures of 18\u20133\u201358\u20131.\nAfter being no-balled Muralitharan bowled a further 32 overs from umpire Steve Dunne's end without protest from either Dunne or Hair, at square leg. The Sri Lankan camp was outraged after the incident, but the ICC defended Hair, outlining a list of steps they had taken in the past to determine, without result, the legitimacy of Muralitharan's action. By calling Muralitharan from the bowlers' end Hair overrode what is normally regarded as the authority of the square leg umpire in adjudicating on throwing. Dunne would have had to break convention to support his partner.\nAt the end of the match the Sri Lankans requested from the ICC permission to confer with Hair to find out exactly how to remedy the problem with their bowler. Despite the game's controlling body agreeing to it, the Australian Cricket Board vetoed it on the grounds that it might lead to umpires being quizzed by teams after every game and meant that the throwing controversy would continue into the World Series Cup during the coming week. The Sri Lankans were disappointed they did not get an explanation and decided they would continue playing their bowler in matches not umpired by Hair and wanted to know whether other umpires would support or reject Hair's judgement.\nMuralitharan's action was cleared by the ICC after biomechanical analysis at the University of Western Australia and at the Hong Kong University of Science &amp; Technology in 1996. They concluded that his action created the 'optical illusion of throwing'.\nMid career.\nOn 16 March 1997, Muralitharan became the first Sri Lankan to reach 100 test wickets, when he dismissed Stephen Fleming in the second innings of the Hamilton Test.\nIn January 1998, Muralitharan took his first ten-wicket haul against Zimbabwe in the first test at Kandy. Sri Lanka won by eight wickets and Muralitharan had figures of 12 for 117.\nIn August that same year Muralitharan produces his career-best test match figures of 16 for 220, in the one-off test against England. In England's second innings Muralitharan bowled a marathon 54.2 overs to pick up 9 for 65 runs, the other wicket being a run out. Ben Hollioake becomes his 200th test wicket. Sri Lanka won by ten wickets, their first Test victory in England. After breaking the world record for the most test wickets in 2007, Muralitharan commented that his 1998 performance at the Oval against England, was his career highlight. He stated \"Everyone thought I was a good bowler then and I didn't look back from there.\"\nPlaying his 58th test, Muralitharan claimed his 300th test wicket when he dismissed Shaun Pollock in the First Test in Durban, in December 2000. Only Dennis Lillee reached the milestone faster, in his 56th test.\nOn 4 January 2002 in Kandy Muralitharan might have finished with the best-ever figures for a single innings, but after he had claimed nine wickets against Zimbabwe Russel Arnold dropped a catch at short leg.\nHe missed out on the tenth when Chaminda Vaas dismissed Henry Olonga caught behind amid stifled appeals. Muralitharan follows up his 9 for 51 in the first innings with 4 for 64 in the second, equalling Richard Hadlee's record of 10 ten-wicket match hauls, but needing 15 fewer Tests to do so.\nOn 15 January 2002 playing in his 72nd test, Muralitharan became the fastest and youngest to reach the 400-wicket landmark when he bowled Olonga in the third Test in Galle.\nOn 16 March 2004 Muralitharan became the fastest and the youngest bowler to reach 500 wickets during the second test between Sri Lanka and Australia played in Kandy. In his 87th test, he bowled Kasprowicz to claim his 500th victim just four days after Warne reached the landmark on the fifth day of the First Test between the two teams at Galle. Warne took 108 tests to reach 500. Muralitharan took 4\u201348 on the first day of the second Test as Australia were skittled for 120 in the first innings.\nPassing Walsh and Warne.\nIn May 2004, Muralitharan overtook West Indian Courtney Walsh's record of 519 Test match wickets to become the highest wicket-taker. Zimbabwe's Mluleki Nkala becomes Muralitharan's 520th scalp in Tests. Muralitharan held the record until Shane Warne claimed it in October 2004. Warne surpassed Muralitharan's mark of 532 wickets by dismissing India's Irfan Pathan. Warne said he enjoyed his duel with Muralitharan, who was sidelined following shoulder surgery at the time.\nAfter an outstanding year Muralitharan was adjudged as the Wisden Leading Cricketer in the World in 2006. In six Tests, he took 60 wickets. He took ten in each of four successive matches, the second time he performed such a feat. The opponents for his 60-wicket haul were England away, South Africa at home and New Zealand away: serious opposition. In all, Muralitharan took 90 wickets in 11 Tests in the calendar year. For his performances in 2006, he was named in the World Test XI by ICC and ESPNcricinfo.\nIn July 2007, Muttiah Muralitharan became the second bowler after Warne to capture 700 Test wickets. The off-spinner reached the landmark when he had Bangladesh's last man Syed Rasel caught in the deep by Farveez Maharoof on the fourth day of the third and final Test at the Asgiriya stadium in Kandy. The dismissal signalled Sri Lanka's victory by an innings and 193 runs to give the host a 3\u20130 sweep of the series. Muralitharan finished with six wickets in each innings to claim 10 wickets or more in a Test for the 20th time. However, he was unable to pass Warne's record of 708 wickets when Sri Lanka toured Australia in November 2007, capturing just four wickets in two Test matches.\nMuralitharan reclaimed the record for most Test wickets during the first Test against England at Kandy on 3 December 2007. The spinner bowled England's Paul Collingwood to claim his 709th Test victim and overtaking Shane Warne in the process. Muralitharan reached the mark in his 116th Test \u2013 29 fewer than Warne \u2013 and had conceded only 21.77 runs per wicket compared to the Australian's 25.41. This was Muralitharan's 61st 5-wicket haul. Warne believed that Muralitharan would take \"1,000 wickets\" before he retired. Former record holder Courtney Walsh also opined that this would be possible if Muralitharan retained his hunger for wickets. Muralitharan himself believed there was a possibility that he would reach this milestone. For his performances in 2007, he was named in the World Test XI by ICC and ESPNcricinfo.\nBeyond the world record.\nIn July 2008, Muralitharan and Ajantha Mendis stopped India's strong batting as Sri Lanka won the first Test by a record innings and 239 runs in Colombo. Muralitharan finished the match with 11 wickets for 110, as India were shot out for 138 in their second innings after conceding a lead of 377 on the fourth day. He was well supported by debutant Ajantha Mendis, an unorthodox spinner with plenty of variation, who took eight wickets in his debut match.\nMuralitharan believed the emergence of Mendis would help prolong his own career. Muralitharan, 36, and 23-year-old Mendis formed a formidable partnership in the first Test thrashing of India, taking 19 of the 20 wickets between them. \"If he keeps performing this way, he will definitely take a lot of wickets in international cricket. Now that he has come, I think I can play Test cricket a few more years. Bowling 50 overs in a Test innings is very hard. Now if I bowl only 30\u201335 and he bowls more than me, the job will get easier for me.\"\nFor his performances in 2008, he was named in the World Test XI by ICC.\nPerformance analysis.\nIn July 2007, Muralitharan achieved a career peak Test Bowling Rating of 920, based on the LG ICC Player Rankings. This is the highest ever rating achieved by a spin bowler in Test cricket. This also puts him in fourth place in the LG ICC Best-Ever Test bowling ratings.\nMuralitharan has the unique distinction of getting 10 or more wickets in a match against all other nine Test playing nations as well as capturing over 50 wickets against each of them. He also obtained 7 or more wickets in an innings against five nations, namely England, India, South Africa, West Indies and Zimbabwe (refer to table above). Muttiah Muralitharan also took at least five five-fors against all the other nine Test sides.\nHe currently holds the highest wickets/match ratio (6.1) for any bowler with over 200 Test wickets and also represented Sri Lanka in 118 Tests of the 175 that they have played (67.4%).\nAgainst teams excluding Bangladesh and Zimbabwe, Muralitharan took 624 wickets in 108 Tests. By comparison, excluding his matches against Bangladesh and Zimbabwe, Warne took 691 wickets in 142 tests. Murali's average of 24.05 is slightly superior to Warne's career average of 25.41. Muralitharan won 18 Man of the Match awards in Test cricket.\nDuring Muralitharan's playing days, the ICC Future Tours Programme denied Sri Lanka and several other teams a level playing field. As a consequence Muralitharan never toured South Africa after December 2002 and never playing a Test at the spin-friendly Sydney Cricket Ground.\nAnother comparison of Muralitharan's bowling record against other successful international bowlers is their career record away from home. Muralitharan received criticism that he enjoyed great success on home soil, taking wickets on pitches that are more spin-friendly than other international pitches. A quick analysis of his Test record of matches played outside Sri Lanka shows that from 52 matches he took 278 wickets at an average of 26.24 runs per wicket, with a strike rate of 60.1 balls per wicket. Similarly, spin bowling rival Shane Warne retired with a slightly superior 'away' record of 362 wickets from 73 matches, at an average of 25.50 and a strike rate of 56.7. Due to the variabilities of Test cricket such as grounds played at and opposition played against it is difficult to compare the quality of the top level players and, as such, is very difficult and subjective. However, it is clear that Muralitharan did much better playing at home to test minnows Zimbabwe and Bangladesh, averaging less than 16 runs a wicket.\nCricinfo's statistics editor S Rajesh concluded that the decade 2000\u20132009 was the best 10-year period for Test batsmen since the 1940s. Muralitharan was clearly the leading Test wicket-taker during this period, capturing 565 wickets at 20.97 in spite of the dominance of the bat over ball. Shane Warne captured 357 wickets at an average of 25.17 during the decade. Of spinners with over Test 100 wickets only John Briggs (17.75), Jim Laker (21.24), Bill O'Reilly (22.59) and Clarrie Grimmett (24.21) have sub 25.00 bowling averages.\nMuralitharan was on the winning side on 54 of the 133 test matches he played. In those games he captured a total of 438 wickets (8.1 wickets per match), at an outstanding average of 16.18 per wicket and a strike rate of 42.7.\nMuralitharan took 795 wickets for his country Sri Lanka in 132 tests. The next most wickets for Sri Lanka in these 132 Tests was Chaminda Vaas' 309 \u2013 less than 40% of the spinner's pile. No one else managed 100. Collectively Sri Lankan bowlers tallied 1968 wickets across that span, of which Muralitharan accounted for 40.4%. Among the 24 other Sri Lankans who took more than 10 of those wickets, only Lasith Malinga did so at a better strike rate (52.3) than Muralitharan's 54.9 \u2013 and the latter bowled rather more overs, 6657.1 of them to be precise.\nOne day internationals.\nCareer summary.\nOn 12 August 1993 Muralitharan made his One Day International (ODI) debut against India at the Khettarama Stadium and took 1 for 38 off ten overs. Pravin Amre was his first ODI wicket.\nOn 27 October 2000 in Sharjah, Muralitharan captured 7 for 30 against India, which were then the best bowling figures in One Day Internationals.\nOn 9 April 2002 Muralitharan achieved a career peak ODI Bowling Rating of 913, based on the LG ICC Player Rankings. This is the highest ever rating achieved by a spin bowler in One Day Internationals. This also puts him in fourth place in the LG ICC Best-Ever ODI bowling ratings.\nIn 2006, Muralitharan had the second (now third) highest number of runs (99) hit off him in a One Day International Innings. The Australians, especially Adam Gilchrist, attacked Muralitharan's bowling more than usual that day. Yet, for his performances in 2006, he was named in the World ODI XI by the ICC. Muralitharan does not have a great record against the Australians in ODIs and this was proved again as he was ineffective in the finals of the 2007 World Cup; his chief tormentor again being Gilchrist. Yet, for his performances in 2007, he was named in the World ODI XI by the ICC. He was named in the 'Team of the Tournament' by ESPNcricinfo for the 2007 World Cup.\nMuralitharan played in five Cricket World Cup tournaments, in 1996, 1999, 2003, 2007 and 2011. He captured 67 World Cup wickets and is second in the list behind Glenn McGrath who has 71, and represented Sri Lanka in three World Cup finals. In 1996 Muralitharan was part of Sri Lanka's World Cup winning team that defeated Australia in Lahore, Pakistan. Muralitharan also played in the 2007 World Cup final, when Australia defeated Sri Lanka in Bridgetown, Barbados. He picked up 23 wickets in the 2007 World Cup, and finished as the second highest wicket taker in the tournament behind Glenn McGrath. He was part of the 2011 team who lost the world cup final against India in Mumbai. It was his farewell match as well. He was named in the 'Team of the Tournament' for the 2011 World Cup by the ICC.\nMuttiah Muralitharan was left out of the Sri Lankan one-day squad to tour West Indies in April 2008. The chairman of selectors Ashantha De Mel clarifying the non-selection stated that \"We know he (Muralitharan) can still play in the next World Cup if he is properly looked after, so we want to use him sparingly to preserve him for the big games and the World Cup coming up in the Asian sub-continent where Muralitharan will be a threat.\"\nMuralitharan has the highest number of career wickets in One Day Internationals, having overtaken Wasim Akram on 5 February 2009. Akram took 502 wickets in 356 matches. On 3 February 2009, Muralitharan dismissed Yuvraj Singh in his 327th match, the third ODI against India in Colombo to equal Akram's record. He won 13 Man of the Match awards in this form of the game.\nBatting.\nAn aggressive lower order batsman who usually batted at No. 11, Muralitharan was known for his tendency to back away to leg and slog. Sometimes, he could be troublesome for bowlers because of his unorthodox and adventurous ways. Once, in a Test match against England, while playing Alex Tudor, he moved back towards his leg stump trying to hook the ball and ended up lying on the ground sideways after the shot. He was infamously run out in a match against New Zealand when he left his crease to congratulate Kumar Sangakkara, who had just scored a single to reach his century; the New Zealand fielder had not yet returned the ball to the wicketkeeper, so the ball was still in play. His highest Test score of 67 came against India at Kandy in 2001, including three sixes and five fours. He made valuable scores on occasion, including 30 runs against England at the Oval in 1998, including 5 fours, 38 runs (4 fours, 1 six) against England at Galle in 2003, 43 runs (5 fours, 3 sixes) against Australia at Kandy in 2004 36 runs against the West Indies at Colombo in 2005, and his highest-ever ODI score, 33 not out (4 fours and 2 sixes off 16 balls) against Bangladesh in the final of the 2009 Tri-Series in Bangladesh. In the latter match, Muralitharan's effort, which included three fours and a six off one over, played a key role in Sri Lanka winning the match and series after the first eight overs saw them reduced to 6 for 5, the lowest score ever recorded in an ODI at the fall of the fifth wicket. Muralitharan has a strike rate close to 70 in Test cricket and scored over 55% of his Test runs in fours and sixes.\nMuralitharan, together with Chaminda Vaas, holds the record for the highest 10th wicket partnership in Tests for Sri Lanka. The pair put on 79 runs for the last wicket at the Asgiriya Stadium against Australia in March 2004. Muralitharan also holds the record for scoring most runs in Test cricket while batting at the number 11 position.\nMuralitharan currently holds the record for the most ducks (dismissals for zero) ever in international cricket (Tests, ODI's and Twenty20), with a total of 59 ducks.\nAbuse in Australia.\nMuralitharan voiced his frustration at routinely being heckled by Australian crowds who accused him of throwing \u2013 one common jeer directed at him was \"No Ball!\". Following the then Australian Prime Minister John Howard's statement that Muralitharan was a \"chucker\", in 2004, Muralitharan indicated that he would skip future tours to Australia.\nTom Moody, the former Sri Lanka coach and former Australian Test cricketer, said he was embarrassed by the derogatory reaction and negative attention directed towards Muttiah Muralitharan by Australian crowds. Moody stated that \"As an Australian when I have been with the Sri Lankan team in Australia, or playing against them in the World Cup, it's the only situation we find in the whole of the cricketing world where we have this disgraceful slant on a cricketer\".\nDuring the 2008 Commonwealth Bank series in Australia, some members of the Sri Lankan contingent including Muralitharan, were the target of an egg throwing incident in Hobart. The Sri Lankan cricket selector Don Anurasiri was hit by an egg, while Muralitharan and two others were verbally abused by a car-load of people as they were walking from a restaurant back to the hotel. Due to the incident taking place at night, it is unclear whether Muralitharan was indeed the target of the culprits. Even though the Australian coach of the Sri Lankan team, Trevor Bayliss, down-played the incident as \"a non-event\", Cricket Australia tightened security around the team. In response to this episode Muralitharan was quoted as saying \"When you come to Australia, you expect such incidents\".\nAt the conclusion of Muralitharan's test career cricket writer Rahul Bhattacharya summed up Muralitharan's trials thus:\n\"Murali is described often as a fox. This seems right. Unlike hedgehog bowlers who pursue one big idea, Murali, like a fox, had many ways of pursuit. Like a fox he did not hunt in a pack. Like a fox he was himself cruelly hunted for sport in some parts of the world. Fox hunting was banned a few years ago in England, but is still legal in Australia.\"\nRetirement.\nOn 7 July 2010, Muttiah Muralitharan formally announced his retirement from Test cricket at a media briefing in Colombo. He confirmed that the first Test Match against India due to commence on 18 July, 2010 would be his last, but indicated that he was willing to play One-Day Internationals if it was considered necessary leading up to the 2011 World Cup, which Sri Lanka co-hosted. He identified Sri Lanka's World Cup win of 1996 as his greatest moment as a cricketer. He also stated that there were some regrets during his 19-year playing career. \"Not winning Test matches in South Africa, Australia and India are regrets. But I am sure we will win very soon.\"\nAt the start of his last match, Muralitharan was eight short of 800 wickets. At the fall of the ninth wicket of the Indian's second innings Muralitharan still needed one wicket to reach the milestone. After 90 minutes of resistance Muralitharan was able to dismiss the last Indian batsman Pragyan Ojha on the last delivery of the final over of his Test career. By doing so he became the only bowler to reach 800 wickets in Test cricket. Sri Lanka won the match by 10 wickets, the seventh time they have done so and the second time they have done it against India.\nIn late 2010, Muralitharan announced his retirement from international cricket after 2011 Cricket World Cup, co-hosted by Bangladesh, India and Sri Lanka announcing \"This World Cup will be my last outing. I am retiring totally from international cricket thereafter. My time is up. I've signed up to play for two years in IPL.\" His final ODI appearance in Sri Lankan soil came during the semi-final clash against New Zealand, where Muralitharan took the wicket of Scott Styris in his last delivery. His last ODI was against India in the World Cup final at Mumbai, however Sri Lanka lost the match and Murali couldn't take any wickets.\nAfter retirement.\nIn July 2014, he played for the Rest of the World side in the Bicentenary Celebration match at Lord's.\nCoaching career.\nMuralitharan is the bowling coach of Sunrisers Hyderabad since 2015. Under in his tenure the Sunrisers Hyderabad emerged as IPL Champions in 2016. He has also been appointed as the head coach of Thiruvallur Veerans in the 2nd edition of the TNPL.\nIn 2014, Muralitharan joined the Australian national team as a coaching consultant for the Test series against Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates. On 11 March 2014, he was appointed as the spin bowling consultant for the Cricket Association of Bengal. The tenure started with the players in a four-day camp beginning on 15 March 2014.\nHe was again called up for the Australian team prior to Australia's tour of Sri Lanka in 2016. Despite his presence in the team as consultant, Australia failed to win any of the three Test matches, losing the series 3\u20130. Muralitharan's role in the Australian team generated controversy throughout the country and Sri Lanka Cricket, and Muralitharan traded verbal blows with the then Sri Lanka team manager Charith Senanayake following an altercation. The Head of SLC Thilanga Sumathipala warned Muralitharan for attempting to coach the Australian team, the team which gave more pressure to Muralitharan in the past due to his bowling actions. Muralitharan said that the team which was against him in the past but now called him to coach them to play against Sri Lanka was a big victory in his career.\nWorld records and achievements.\nMuttiah Muralitharan holds a number of world records, and several firsts:\nRecognition.\nIn 2002, Wisden carried out a statistical analysis of all Test matches in an effort to rate the greatest cricketers in history, and Muralitharan was ranked as the best Test bowler of all time. However, two years earlier, Muralitharan was not named as one of the five Wisden Cricketers of the Century. Former Australian captain Steve Waugh called him \"the Don Bradman of bowling\".\nMuralitharan was selected as the Wisden Leading Cricketer in the World in 2000 and in 2006.\nOn 15 November 2007, the Warne-Muralidaran Trophy was unveiled named after the two leading wicket-takers in Test cricket, Shane Warne and Muralitharan. The trophy displays images of the two spin bowlers' hands each holding a cricket ball. This trophy will be contested between Australia and Sri Lanka in all future Test series.\nOn 3 December 2007, just hours after Muttiah Muralitharan became Test cricket's leading Test wicket-taker, Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) announced it had unveiled a portrait of the Sri Lanka off-spinner at Lord's. On the same day the Philatelic Bureau of the Department of Posts in Sri Lanka issued a circular stamp with a denomination of Rs. 5 to mark the world record set by Muttiah Muralitharan. The circular design was meant to denote the cricket ball.\nAustralian musician Alston Koch provoked worldwide interest when he recorded the only official tribute song to Muralitharan. The song was even mentioned on the BBC's Test Match Special. The Muralitharan Song video was also released after he broke the world record.\nOn 10 January 2008, the Parliament of Sri Lanka felicitated Muttiah Muralitharan for his world record breaking feat of being the highest wicket taker in Test cricket.\nThis was the first time that a sportsman had been honoured in the country's Supreme Legislature.\nThe Central Provincial Council in Kandy has renamed the International Cricket Stadium in Pallekele after Muttiah Muralitharan.\nControversy of bowling action.\nThroughout much of his international career, Muralitharan's action was suspected of contravening the laws of the game by the straightening of his bowling arm during delivery. Although he was cited three times, subsequent biomechanical testing led the ICC to clear him of the charge and permit him to continue bowling.\nBiomechanical testing conducted on four occasions fueled debate as to whether his action was in fact illegal or actually an illusion created by his allegedly unique ability to generate extra movement both at the shoulder as well the wrist, which enables him to bowl the doosra without straightening the elbow.\nFirst throwing citation and testing.\nInitial concerns as to whether Muralitharan's action contravened the laws of the game by straightening his bowling arm during delivery broke into open controversy after Australian umpire Darrell Hair called a \"no-ball\" for an illegal action seven times during the Boxing Day Test match in Melbourne, Australia, in 1995. Australian Sir Donald Bradman, universally regarded as the greatest batsman in history, was later quoted as saying it was the \"worst example of umpiring that [he had] witnessed, and against everything the game stands for. Clearly Murali does not throw the ball\".\nTen days later, on 5 January 1996, Sri Lanka played the West Indies in the seventh ODI of the triangular World Series competition, in Brisbane. Umpire Ross Emerson officiating in his debut international match, no-balled Muralitharan three times in his first over, twice in his second and twice in his third. It was an identical tally to that called by Hair on Boxing Day and (like Hair) Emerson made his calls from the bowler's end while his partner stood silent. The main difference was that several no-balls were for leg-breaks instead of the bowler's normal off-breaks.\nIn February 1996, just before the World Cup, Muralitharan underwent biomechanical analysis at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology under the supervision of Prof. Ravindra Goonetilleke, who declared his action legal in the conditions tested, citing a congenital defect in Muralitharan's arm which makes him incapable of fully straightening the arm but gives the appearance of fully straightening it. Although under the original Laws a bowler's arm did not have to be fully straightened to be an illegal delivery, it was concluded that his action created the 'optical illusion of throwing'. Based on this evidence, ICC gave clearance to Muralitharan to continue bowling.\nSecond citation and testing.\nDoubts about Muralitharan's action persisted, however. On the 1998\u201399 tour to Australia he was once again called for throwing by Ross Emerson during a One Day International against England at the Adelaide Oval in Australia. The Sri Lankan team almost abandoned the match, but after instructions from the President of the Board of Control for Cricket in Sri Lanka, the game resumed. The Sri Lankan captain at the time Arjuna Ranatunga, was later fined and given a suspended ban from the game as a result. It later emerged that at the time of this match Emerson was on sick leave from his non-cricket job due to a stress-related illness and he stood down for the rest of the series. Muralitharan was sent for further tests in Perth and England and was cleared again. At no stage was Muralitharan requested to change or remodel his action, by the ICC. Up to this point in his career (1999) Muralitharan primarily bowled two types of deliveries, namely the off-break and the topspinner. He had not yet mastered the doosra.\nThird citation and testing.\nMuralitharan continued bowling, taking his 500th Test wicket in the second Test against Australia in Kandy on 16 March 2004. At the end of the series his doosra delivery was officially called into question by match referee Chris Broad. At the University of Western Australia (Department of Human Movement and Exercise Science), three-dimensional kinematic measurements of Muttiah Muralitharan's bowling arm were taken using an optical motion capture system while he bowled his doosra. Muralitharan's mean elbow extension angle for the doosra delivery was 14\u00b0, which was subsequently reduced to a mean of 10.2\u00b0 after remedial training at the university. The findings reported to ICC by the University of Western Australia's study was that Muralitharan's doosra contravened the established ICC elbow extension limit of 5\u00b0 for spinners.\nUnder the original throwing Laws of Cricket, the umpires officiating were under an obligation to call \"no-ball\" to a delivery that they were not entirely happy was absolutely fair. This Law gave the umpires absolutely no discretion. In 2000, the Laws were changed to put an allowable figure of straightening of 5\u00b0 for spinners, 7.5\u00b0 for medium pacers and 10\u00b0 for fast bowlers in an attempt to more clearly define what was legal. But these figures proved difficult to enforce due to umpires being unable to discern actual amounts of straightening and the differentiation between the three different allowable figures. Testing in Test match conditions is not currently possible \"when the identification of elbow and shoulder joint centres in on-field data collection, where a shirt is worn, also involves large errors. In a match the ability to differentiate anatomical movements such as 'elbow extension' by digitising segment end-points, particularly if you have segment rotations, is extremely difficult and prone to error. This is certainly the case with spin bowlers. It is therefore not surprising that laboratory testing is preferred, particularly for spin bowlers, where an appropriate pitch length and run-up can be structured. This is clearly the only way to test players, where data would be able to withstand scientific and therefore legal scrutiny.\"\nAn extensive ICC study, the results of which were released in November 2004, was conducted to investigate the \"chucking issue\". A laboratory kinematic analysis of 42 non-Test playing bowlers done by Ferdinands and Kersting (2004) established that the 5\u00b0 limit for slow and spin bowlers was particularly impractical.\nDue to the overwhelming scientific findings, researchers recommended that a flat rate of 15\u00b0 tolerable elbow extension be used to define a preliminary demarcation point between bowling and throwing. A panel of former Test players consisting of Aravinda de Silva, Angus Fraser, Michael Holding, Tony Lewis, Tim May and the ICC's Dave Richardson, with the assistance of several biomechanical experts, stated that 99% of all bowlers in the history of cricket straighten their arms when bowling. Only one player tested (part-time bowler Ramnaresh Sarwan) reportedly did not transgress the pre 2000 rules. Many of these reports have controversially not been published and as such, the 99% figure stated has yet to be proved. In fact, Muralitharan stirred up controversy when he said during an interview with a Melbourne radio station that Jason Gillespie, Glenn McGrath and Brett Lee flexed their arms by 12, 13 and 14\u201315 degrees respectively, although it is unclear as to where Muralitharan quoted these figures from. Muralitharan was censured by the Sri Lankan Cricket Board for these comments.\nThe ICC Executive was asked to ratify the panel's recommendations at the ICC's Annual General Meeting in February 2005. Based on the recommendations the ICC issued a new guideline (which was effective from 1 March 2005) allowing for extensions or hyperextensions of up to 15 degrees for all types of bowlers, thus deeming Muralitharan's doosra to be legal.\nExplaining why the maximum level of 15 degrees was arrived at, panel member Angus Fraser stated \"That is the number which biomechanics says that it (straightening) becomes visible. It is difficult for the naked eye to see less than 15 degrees in a bowler's action. We found when the biceps reached the shoulder the amount of bend was around 165 degrees. Very few bowlers can get to 180 degrees because the joint doesn't allow that.\u00a0... but once you go further than 15 degrees you get into an area which is starting to give you an unfair advantage and you are breaking the law\".\nUniversity of South Australia study.\nThe original decision of disallowing the doosra bowling action was hailed widely as justifiable on account of being scientifically based. Hence, a team of Australian scientists representing the University of South Australia conducted an independent research, in line with modern Artificial Intelligence and biomechanics to solve the controversial issue arise from doosra. The University of South Australia's study, founded by Prof. Mahinda Pathegama, and contributed by Prof. Ozdemir Gol, Prof. J. Mazumdar, Prof. Tony Worsley and Prof. Lakmi Jain has analyzed the previous studies with close scrutiny since the techniques in their fields of expertise are employed in the course of assessment as the basis for decision-making. The findings based on this scientific study are overwhelming and Dave Richardson, general manager ICC stated that \"the ICC is currently reviewing the Law on throwing and the ICC regulations and the study done by Prof. Mahinda Pathegama with UniSA scientists is a valuable source of information in this regard.\" The team of Australian scientists including Sri Lankan-born Australian scientist, Prof. Mahinda Pathegama reporting their findings, in line with the Muralitharan test to ICC, has analyzed in-depth various issues, such as Pitfalls in image interpretation when using 2D images for 3D modeling associates compared to the modern techniques in Artificial Intelligence and biomechanics, and Biomechanics assessment for doosra bowling action, etc. Pathegama at al. (2004) further reports on the Disagreement of expression on measurement accuracy in the Murali Report, with the analysis of the Motion tracking system used for the Murali Report, and discussing Cognitive aspects, Evidence of errors in Anthropometric assessment and movement tracking, Lateral inhibition in response tracking, Psycho-physiological aspect on post-assessments, Angular measurement errors, Skin marker induced errors, Geometrics-and physics-based 3D modeling and the Approach to on-field assessment, etc.\nThe Muralitharan Report produced by the University of Western Australia's study has considered the Richards study done in 1999 to evaluate the error margin. University of South Australia's study done by Prof. Mahinda Pathegama argued that the Richards study which was presented by the University of Western Australia's study has used a rigid aluminium bar that only rotated in the horizontal plane to introduce such error margin. Pathegama's report stated that \"in view of the system used in the test itself yielding considerable error even with a rigid aluminum bar (an \"accuracy level of approximately 4 degrees\" as stated in the Murali Report), it stands to reason that the error margin would be considerably larger when tracking skin markers on a spin bowler's moving upper limb by this same system\". Sri Lankan born Australian medical doctor Siri Kannangara who also then served as the director of the New South Wales Institute of Sports Medicine, was also present at the forefront in analyzing Muttiah Muralitharan's bowling action as part of the University of South Australia case study to determine whether Muralitharan's bowling action was genuinely legitimate or if he was chucking the ball in his bowling runup when delivering the ball in his follow-through at the international level.\nVincent Barnes in an interview argues that Bruce Elliott, the UWA professor who is also the ICC biomechanist, had made an interesting discovery in his dealings with finger spinners. \"He said he had found that a lot of bowlers from the subcontinent could bowl the doosra legally, but not Caucasian bowlers.\"\nFourth round of testing.\nOn 2 February 2006, Muralitharan underwent a fourth round of biomechanical testing at the University of Western Australia. There had been criticism that the previous round of tests in July 2004 did not replicate match conditions due to a slower bowling speed in the laboratory tests. The results showed that the average elbow extension while bowling the 'doosra' delivery was 12.2 degrees, at an average of . The average for his off-break was 12.9 degrees at .\nBowling with an arm brace.\nIn July 2004 Muralitharan was filmed in England, bowling with an arm brace on. The film was shown on Britain's Channel 4 during the Test against England on 22 July 2004.\nInitially, Muralitharan bowled three balls \u2013 the off-spinner, the top-spinner and the doosra \u2013 as he would in a match. Then he bowled the same three balls with a brace that is made from steel bars, which are set into strong resin. This brace has been moulded to his right arm, is approximately 46 centimetres long and weighs just under 1 kilogram.\nTV presenter Mark Nicholas who tried the brace himself, confirmed that \"There is no way an arm can be bent, or flexed, when it is in this brace.\" All three balls reacted in the same way as when bowled without the brace. They were not bowled quite so fast because the weight of the brace restricts the speed of Muralitharan's shoulder rotation, but the spin was still there.\nWith the brace on, there still appeared to be a jerk in his action. When studying the film at varying speeds, it still appeared as if he straightened his arm, even though the brace makes it impossible to do so. His unique shoulder rotation and amazing wrist action seem to create the illusion that he straightens his arm.\nThe off-spinner said the exercise was to convince a sceptical public rather than sway an ICC investigation into bowling actions launched after he was reported by match referee Chris Broad for his doosra delivery in March 2004, the third time action was taken on his bowling. In an interview for August 2004 edition of Wisden Asia Cricket, Muralitharan stated \"I think it will prove a point to those who had said that it was physically impossible to bowl a ball that turned the other way. I proved that it was possible to bowl the doosra without bending the arm.\"\nIn 2004 at the R Premadasa Stadium in Colombo, Muralitharan voluntarily performed a series of tests with live video cameras. Michael Slater and Ravi Shastri witnessed it all unfold. Muralitharan once again showed he could bowl all his deliveries including the doosra with an arm brace that prevents any straightening of his elbow. Orthopediatrician Dr Mandeep Dillon stated that Muralitharan's unusual ability to generate extra movement both at the shoulder as well the wrist enables him to bowl the doosra without straightening the elbow.\nCritics and converts.\nTwo vocal critics of Muralitharan's action have been former test cricketers, Australian Dean Jones and Bishan Bedi, the former Indian captain. Dean Jones later admitted to being wrong in his assessment of Murali when he witnessed first hand Murali bowling with an arm-brace on.\nMichael Holding, the former West Indian fast bowler was also a critic of Muralitharan, but withdrew his criticisms under the light of the tests carried out. Holding had been quoted as being in \"110% agreement\" with Bedi, who likened Murali's action to a \"javelin throw\" and more recently, compared to a \"shot putter\". Following the ICC study, as a member of the panel that conducted the study, Holding stated, \"The scientific evidence is overwhelming\u00a0... When bowlers who to the naked eye look to have pure actions are thoroughly analysed with the sophisticated technology now in place, they are likely to be shown as straightening their arm by 11 and in some cases 12 degrees. Under a strict interpretation of the Law, these players are breaking the rules. The game needs to deal with this reality and make its judgment as to how it accommodates this fact.\"\nIn May 2002, Adam Gilchrist, speaking at a Carlton (Australian) Football Club luncheon, claimed Muralitharan's action does not comply with the laws of cricket. The Melbourne-based Age newspaper quoted Gilchrist as saying.\"Yeah, I think he does (chuck), and I say that because, if you read the laws of the game, there's no doubt in my mind that he and many others, throughout cricket history have.\" These comments were made before the doosra controversy, in spite of Muralitharan's action having been cleared by ICC in both 1996 and 1999. For his comment Gilchrist was reprimanded by the Australian Cricket Board (ACB) and found guilty of being in breach of ACB rules concerned with \"detrimental public comment\".\nDuring the 2006 tour of New Zealand another Muralitharan critic, former New Zealand captain and cricket commentator Martin Crowe, called for Muralitharan's doosra to be monitored more closely, asserting that his action seemed to deteriorate during a match. Earlier that year when delivering the Cowdrey lecture at Lords Martin Crowe had demanded zero tolerance instead of 15 degrees for throwing and specifically branded Muttiah Muralitharan a chucker. In response to Crowe's criticism ICC general manager Dave Richardson stated that the scientific evidence presented by biomechanists Professor Bruce Elliot, Dr Paul Hurrion and Mr Marc Portuswith was overwhelming and clarified that \"Some bowlers, even those not suspected of having flawed actions, were found likely to be straightening their arms by 11 or 12 degrees. And at the same time, some bowlers that may appear to be throwing may be hyper-extending or bowl with permanently bent elbows. Under a strict interpretation of the law, they were breaking the rules \u2013 but if we ruled out every bowler that did that then there would be no bowlers left.\"\nScientific research on bowling actions.\nSince 1999 there has been a number of scientific research publications discussing Muralitharan's bowling action as well the need for defining the legality of a bowling action using biomechanical concepts. This research directly contributed towards the official acceptance of Muralitharan's bowling action and convinced the ICC to redefine the bowling laws in cricket.\nThe key publications are listed below:\nPhilanthropy.\nMuralitharan, along with his manager Kushil Gunasekara, established the charitable organisation Foundation of Goodness in the early 2000s. The organisation is committed to the wellbeing of the Seenigama region (in southern Sri Lanka) and supports local communities through a range of projects across areas including children's needs, education and training, health care and psycho-social support, housing, livelihoods, sport and the environment. Murali's Seenigama project raised funds from cricketers and administrators in England and Australia. Canadian pop-star Bryan Adams donated a swimming pool.\nMuralitharan also planned to build a second sports complex for war-displaced civilians in Mankulam, a town located 300 kilometres from north of Colombo. The two-year, $1 million dollar project aimed to build a sports centre, a school, English and IT training centres and an Elders' home. While the Sports Complex remains the main project, Foundation of Goodness also plans to help educate children, youth and adults. English cricketer Sir Ian Botham visited Mankulam with Muralitharan, and later addressing the media in Colombo on 27 March 2011 said that he will consider a walk from Point Pedro (the extreme northern tip of Sri Lanka) to Dondra Head (the extreme southern tip of Sri Lanka) to raise funds for the project.\nIn June 2004, Muralitharan also joined the United Nations World Food Program as an ambassador to fight hunger among school children.\nWhen the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake devastated Sri Lanka on 26 December 2004, Muralitharan contributed to the relief programs. He himself narrowly escaped death, arriving 20 minutes late at Seenigama, where he was to give away prizes at one of the charity projects he worked on. While international agencies were bringing food in by air, Muralitharan paid for and organised three convoys of ten trucks each to get assist in the distribution. He persuaded those who could to donate clothes, and supervised the delivery himself.\nDuring the rehabilitation efforts in the tsunami's aftermath, cement was in short supply. Muralitharan promptly signed an endorsement deal with Lafarge, a global cement giant, that was a straight barter, where cement would be supplied to the Foundation for Goodness in exchange for work Muralitharan did. During the first three years since the tsunami, the foundation raised more than US$ 4 million to help survivors, and has built homes, schools, sports facilities and computer centres.\nOther work.\nOn 1 August 2015, Muralitharan and fellow Sri Lankan cricketer Tillakaratne Dilshan were appointed by President of Sri Lanka Maithripala Sirisena as the Brand Ambassadors for the Presidential Task Force to combat kidney disease.\nIn popular culture.\nIn July 2019, it was announced that a biopic would be made in Tamil titled \"800\" with actor Vijay Sethupathi portraying Muralitharan. The film was set to be produced by actor Rana Daggubati under his banner Suresh Productions with MS Sripathy director. However the filming was put on hold due to various reasons such as political opposition. On 8 October 2020, the filmmakers announced that the biopic film tentatively titled as \"800\" would be proceeded as planned and also revealed that first look poster of the film would be released sooner along with the details of cast and crew members.\nSethupathi received widespread criticism and backlash in the social media for portraying the role of Muttiah Muralitharan in the biopic flick. Netizens also claimed that Muralitharan himself is a pro Rajapaksa supporter and requested Sethupathi to leave the filming. In addition, politicians from Tamil Nadu also cautioned that a Tamil actor shouldn't play the role of a Sri Lankan recalling the claims of genocide massacre of over 200,000 Sri Lankan Tamils during the final stage of the Sri Lankan Civil War. Dravidian outfit in Coimbaitore also urged Vijay Sethupathi to drop out from the project insisting that Muralitharan supported Sinhalese during the Sri Lankan Civil War. #Shame on Vijay Sethupathi hashtag was trending on the social media on 13 October 2020 soon after the motion poster release of the film which was released via Star Sports prior to the group stage match between Chennai Super Kings and Sunrisers Hyderabad during the 2020 Indian Premier League. Muralitharan denied the allegations regarding supporting the killing of civilians during the civil war and insisted that the war should not be glorified. Due to the political upheavals regarding the film, Muralitharan himself urged Sethupathi to opt out of the project and the film project did not materialise.\nOn 17 April 2023, coinciding with the birthday of Muralitharan, the first look poster of the biopic titled \"800\" was released with Madhur Mittal replacing Sethupathi. The film, produced by Movie Train Motion Pictures, was filmed across Sri Lanka, Chennai, Cochin, England, and Australia.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "20907", "revid": "46085058", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20907", "title": "Mot\u00f6rhead", "text": "English rock band (1975\u20132015)\nMot\u00f6rhead ( ) were an English rock band formed in London in 1975 by bassist and lead vocalist Lemmy Kilmister, guitarist Larry Wallis and drummer Lucas Fox. Kilmister was the primary songwriter and only constant member. The band are often considered a precursor to the new wave of British heavy metal, which re-energised heavy metal in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Though several guitarists and drummers played in Mot\u00f6rhead, most of their best-selling albums and singles featured drummer Phil \"Philthy Animal\" Taylor and guitarist \"Fast\" Eddie Clarke. From 1995 until the band's break-up in 2015, the group consisted of Kilmister, guitarist Phil Campbell and drummer Mikkey Dee.\nMot\u00f6rhead released 22 studio albums, 10 live recordings, 12 compilation albums and five EPs over a career spanning 40 years. Usually a power trio, they had particular success in the early 1980s with several successful singles in the UK Top 40 chart. The albums \"Overkill\", \"Bomber\" (both 1979), \"Ace of Spades\" (1980) and, particularly, the live album \"No Sleep 'til Hammersmith\" (1981) cemented Mot\u00f6rhead's reputation as a top-tier rock band. The band are ranked number 26 on VH1's 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock. By 2025, the band has sold more than 25 million albums worldwide.\nMost often classified as heavy metal, Mot\u00f6rhead has been credited with being part of and influencing numerous musical scenes, thrash metal and speed metal especially. Lemmy, however, always insisted that they were a rock and roll band. He said they had more in common with punk bands, but with their own unique sound, Mot\u00f6rhead is embraced in both punk and metal scenes. Their lyrics typically covered such topics as war, good and evil, abuse of power, promiscuity, substance abuse and, most famously, gambling, the last theme being the focus of their hit song \"Ace of Spades\".\nLemmy died on 28 December 2015 from cardiac arrhythmia and congestive heart failure, after being diagnosed with prostate cancer. The day after his death, longtime members Dee and Campbell both confirmed that Mot\u00f6rhead had disbanded. By 2018, all three members of Mot\u00f6rhead's best-known line-up (Lemmy, Taylor and Clarke) had died.\nHistory.\n1975\u20131977: Formation and early years.\nLemmy was dismissed from Hawkwind in May 1975 after being arrested in Canada for drug possession; he said \"the band dismissed me for doing the wrong drugs\". Now on his own, Lemmy decided to form a new band called Mot\u00f6rhead, the name was inspired by the final song he had written for Hawkwind.\nLemmy wanted the music to be \"fast and vicious, just like the MC5\". His stated aim was to \"concentrate on very basic music: loud, fast, city, raucous, arrogant, paranoid, speedfreak rock n roll ... it will be so loud that if we move in next door to you, your lawn will die\". He recruited guitarist Larry Wallis (formerly of Pink Fairies) on the recommendation of Mick Farren, based on Wallis' work with Steve Peregrin Took's band Shagrat, and Lucas Fox on drums. According to Lemmy, the band's first practice was at the now defunct Sound Management rehearsal studios, in Kings Road, Chelsea in 1975. Sound Management leased the basement area of furniture store The Furniture Cave, located in adjacent Lots Road. Kilmister has said they used to steal equipment, as the band was short on gear. Their first engagement was supporting Greenslade at The Roundhouse, London on 20 July 1975. On 19 October, having played 10 gigs, they became the supporting act to Blue \u00d6yster Cult at the Hammersmith Odeon.\nThe band were contracted to United Artists by Andrew Lauder, the A&amp;R man for Lemmy's previous band, Hawkwind. They recorded sessions at Rockfield Studios in Monmouth with producer Dave Edmunds, during which Fox proved to be unreliable and was replaced by drummer Phil \"Philthy Animal\" Taylor, a casual acquaintance of Lemmy's. Their record label was dissatisfied with the material and refused to release it, although it was subsequently issued as \"On Parole\" in 1979 after the band had established some success.\nIn March 1976, deciding that two guitarists were required, the band auditioned an acquaintance of drummer Taylor's named \"Fast\" Eddie Clarke. Wallis, who was continuing to tour with a reformed Pink Fairies, quit immediately after the auditions and Clarke remained as the sole guitarist. This trio of Lemmy/Clarke/Taylor is today regarded as the \"classic\" Mot\u00f6rhead line-up. In December, the band recorded the Holland\u2013Dozier\u2013Holland composition \"Leaving Here\" for early punk rock and pub rock label, Stiff Records, but United Artists intervened to prevent its general release as the band were still under contract to them, despite the label's refusal to issue their debut album. Initial reactions to the band had been unfavourable; they won a poll for \"the best worst band in the world\" in the music magazine \"NME\".\nBy April 1977, living in squats and with little recognition, Taylor and Clarke decided to quit the band, and after some debate, they agreed to do a farewell show at the Marquee Club in London. Lemmy had become acquainted with Ted Carroll from Chiswick Records and asked him to bring a mobile studio to the show to record it for posterity. Carroll was unable to get the mobile unit to the Marquee Club on 1 April 1977, but showed up backstage after the engagement and offered them two days at Escape Studios with producer Speedy Keen to record a single. The band took the chance, and instead of recording a single they laid down 11 unfinished tracks. Carroll gave them a few more days at Olympic Studios to finish the vocals and the band completed 13 tracks for release as an album. Chiswick issued the single \"Motorhead\" in June, followed by the album \"Mot\u00f6rhead\" in August, which spent one week in the UK Albums Chart at number 43. The band toured the UK supporting Hawkwind in June, then from late July they commenced the \"Beyond the Threshold of Pain Tour\" with the Count Bishops, a band who were gaining some popularity on the early punk rock and pub rock scene.\nIn August, Tony Secunda took over the management of the band, and their cohesiveness became so unstable that by March 1978, Clarke and Taylor had formed and were performing as the Muggers with Speedy Keen and Billy Rath of American punk band The Heartbreakers.\n1978\u20131979: Rise to success: \"Overkill\" and \"Bomber\".\nIn July 1978, the band returned to the management of Douglas Smith, who secured a one-off singles deal with Gerry Bron's Bronze Records. The resulting \"Louie Louie\" single (a cover version of Richard Berry and The Kingsmen standard) was issued in September peaking at number 68 on the UK Singles Chart, and the band toured the UK to promote it, recorded a BBC Radio 1 \"John Peel in session\" on 18 September (these tracks were later issued on the 2005 \"BBC Live &amp; In-Session\" album), and appeared for the first time on BBC Television's \"Top of the Pops\" on 25 October. Pub rock and early Punk rock label Chiswick Records capitalised on this new level of success by re-issuing the debut album \"Mot\u00f6rhead\" on white vinyl through EMI Records.\nThe single's success led to Bronze extending their contract, and put the band back into the studio to record an album, this time with producer Jimmy Miller at Roundhouse Studios. A hint of what the band had recorded for the album came on 9 March 1979 when the band played \"Overkill\" on \"Top of the Pops\" to support the release of the single ahead of the \"Overkill\" album, which was released on 24 March. It became Mot\u00f6rhead's first album to break into the top 40 of the UK Albums chart, reaching number 24, with the single reaching number 39 on the UK Singles Chart. These releases were followed by the \"Overkill\" UK tour which began on 23 March. A subsequent single was released in June, coupling the album track \"No Class\" as the A-side with the previously unreleased song \"Like a Nightmare\" on the B-side. It fared worse than both the album and previous single but reached number 61 on the UK singles chart.\nDuring July and August, except for a break to appear at the Reading Festival, the band were working on their next album, \"Bomber\". Released on 27 October, it reached number 12 on the UK Albums Chart. On 1 December, it was followed by the \"Bomber\" single, which reached number 34 on the UK Singles Chart. The \"Bomber\" Europe and UK tour followed, with support from Saxon. The stage show featured a spectacular aircraft bomber-shaped lighting rig. During the \"Bomber\" tour, United Artists put together tapes recorded during the Rockfield Studios sessions in 1975\u20131976 and released them as the album \"On Parole\", which peaked at number 65 on the UK Albums Chart in December.\nOn 8 May 1980, while the band were on tour in Europe, Bronze released \"The Golden Years\", which sold better than any of their previous releases, reaching number eight on the UK Singles Chart. The band had, however, preferred the title \"Flying Tonight\", in reference to the \"Bomber\" lighting rig. On 20 August, the band had a 40-minute filmed slot, along with Girlschool's 20 minutes performing live at the Nottingham Theatre Royal for the \"Rockstage\" programme, broadcast on UK television by the ATV on 4 April 1981.\n1980\u20131982: \"Ace of Spades\" and \"Iron Fist\".\nDuring August and September 1980, the band were at Jackson's Studios in Rickmansworth, recording with producer Vic Maile. The \"Ace of Spades\" single was released on 27 October 1980 as a preview of the \"Ace of Spades\" album, which followed on 8 November. The single reached No. 15 and the album reached No. 4 on the UK charts, the latter being the highest position in the band's history. Bronze celebrated its gold record status by pressing a limited edition of the album in gold vinyl.\nMot\u00f6rhead made an appearance on \"Top of the Pops\" in November that year with \"Ace of Spades\", and between 22 October and 29 November the band were on their \"Ace Up Your Sleeve\" UK tour with support from Girlschool and Vardis, and also made an appearance as guests on the ITV children's show \"Tiswas\" on 8 November. The \"Arizona desert-style\" pictures used on the album sleeve and tour booklet cover were taken during a photo session at a sandpit in Barnet. \"Ace of Spades\", considered to be the definitive Mot\u00f6rhead anthem, \"put a choke on the English music charts and proved to all that a band could succeed without sacrificing its blunt power and speed\".\nTo coincide with the \"Ace of Spades\" release, Big Beat, who had inherited the Chiswick catalogue, put together four unused tracks from the Escape Studios sessions in 1977 and released them as \"Beer Drinkers and Hell Raisers\", which reached No. 43 on the UK Singles Chart in November.\nThe band had more chart hits in 1981 with the releases \"St. Valentine's Day Massacre\" EP, their collaboration with Girlschool which reached No. 5 on the UK Singles Chart in February; the live version of \"Motorhead\", which reached No. 6 on the UK Singles Chart in July; and the album it was taken from, \"No Sleep 'til Hammersmith\", which reached No. 1 on the UK Albums Chart in June. During March 1981, the band had been touring Europe, and in the final week of the month they conducted the \"Short Sharp, Pain in the Neck\" UK tour from which the recordings for \"No Sleep 'til Hammersmith\" were made.\nFrom April through to July, the band toured North America for the first time as guests of Blizzard of Ozz, an early incarnation of Ozzy Osbourne's band, but were still able to make an appearance on \"Top of the Pops\" on 9 July to promote the live \"Motorhead\" single. In October the band recorded tracks at BBC's Maida Vale studio for the David Jensen show broadcast on 6 October. The band commenced a European tour on 20 November, supported by Tank, after which Clarke produced Tank's debut album \"Filth Hounds of Hades\" at Ramport Studios in December and January.\nBetween 26 and 28 January 1982, the band started recording their self-produced new album at Ramport Studios, before moving onto Morgan Studios to continue the sessions throughout February. On 3 April the single \"Iron Fist\" was released, reaching No. 29 on the UK Singles Chart, followed by the parent album \"Iron Fist\", released on 17 April and peaking at No. 6 on the UK Albums Chart. They were the last releases to feature the Lemmy, Clarke, Taylor line-up, though the line-up continued to perform in the \"Iron Fist\" UK tour between 17 March and 12 April, and the band's first headlining North America tour from 12 May until Clarke's last engagement at the New York Palladium on 14 May.\n1982\u20131985: Departures, \"Another Perfect Day\" and \"No Remorse\".\nClarke left as a consequence of the band recording \"Stand By Your Man\", a cover version of the Tammy Wynette classic, in collaboration with Wendy O. Williams and the Plasmatics. Clarke felt that the song compromised the band's principles, refused to play on the recording and resigned, later forming his own band, Fastway. Lemmy and Taylor made numerous telephone calls to find a guitarist, including one to Brian Robertson, formerly with Thin Lizzy, who was recording a solo album in Canada. He agreed to help out and complete the tour with them. Robertson signed a one-album deal resulting in 1983's \"Another Perfect Day\" and the two singles from it, \"Shine\" and \"I Got Mine\".\nIn June and July the band played five dates in Japan, and from mid-October until mid-November they toured Europe. From late May until early July, the band conducted the \"Another Perfect Tour\", followed by an American tour between July and August, and another European tour in October and November. Robertson began to cause friction in the band as a result of his on-stage attire, consisting of shorts and ballet shoes, and with his refusal to play old standards that Mot\u00f6rhead audiences expected to hear. Robertson left the band soon after their concert at the Berlin Metropol on 11 November 1983.\nAfter Robertson's departure, the band received tapes from guitarists from all over the world who wished to be considered for a place in Mot\u00f6rhead. The group returned to the concept of dual lead guitars by hiring unknowns W\u00fcrzel and Phil Campbell (formerly of Persian Risk). In February 1984, the Lemmy, Campbell, W\u00fcrzel, and Taylor line-up recorded \"Ace of Spades\" for the \"Bambi\" episode in the British television series, \"The Young Ones\". Scenes of the band playing are interspersed with the characters' antics as they rush to the railway station, in a parody of the Beatles' comedy film \"A Hard Day's Night\". Taylor quit the band after that recording, causing Lemmy to quip: \"Did I leave them or did they leave me?\". Before joining Mot\u00f6rhead, Phil Campbell had met former Saxon drummer Pete Gill, and the trio decided to call him to see if he would like to visit London. The try-outs went well and Gill was hired.\nBronze Records thought the new line-up would not make the grade and decided to \"nail down the lid\" on the group with a compilation album. When Lemmy found out, he took over the project, selecting tracks, providing sleeve notes and insisted that Mot\u00f6rhead record four brand new tracks to go at the end of each side of the album. During the sessions between 19 and 25 May 1984 at Britannia Row Studios, London, the band recorded six tracks for the single's B-side and the album. The single \"Killed by Death\" was released on 1 September and reached No. 51 in the UK Singles Chart, the double album \"No Remorse\" was released on 15 September and reached silver disc status, attaining the position of No. 14 in the UK Album charts.\nThe band were involved in a court case with Bronze over the next two years, believing that their releases were not being promoted properly, and the record company banned them from the recording studio. The band looked to more touring for income; Australia and New Zealand in late July to late August, a brief tour of Hungary in September, and the \"No Remorse\" \"Death on the Road\" tour between 24 October and 7 November. They kicked off their tour in the UK by making a live appearance on the early morning children's TV show \"The Saturday Starship\". Their set, which included \"Iron Fist\", \"Ace of Spades\", and \"Overkill\", was performed in the car park of the Central TV studios, Birmingham, prompting complaints about the noise from local residents.\nOn 26 October the band made a live appearance on the British Channel 4 music programme \"The Tube\", performing \"Killed By Death\", \"Steal Your Face\" (over which the programme's end-credits were played) and the unbroadcast \"Overkill\", before going on to their next engagement that evening. From 19 November to 15 December the band toured America with Canadian speed metal band Exciter and Danish heavy metal band Mercyful Fate and from 26 to 30 December performed five shows in West Germany.\nOn 5 April 1985, ITV broadcast four songs that were recorded after the band went off air on their earlier appearance on \"The Tube\" programme. A week later the band, dressed in tuxedos, played four songs on the live Channel 4 music show \"ECT\" (Extra-Celestial Transmission). To celebrate the band's 10th anniversary, two shows were arranged at Hammersmith Odeon on 28 and 29 June, a video of the second show was taken and later released as \"The Birthday Party\". From early June until early August the band were on their 'It Never Gets Dark' tour of Sweden and Norway, an American tour followed in mid-November until late December.\n1986\u20131989: \"Orgasmatron\" and \"Rock 'n' Roll\".\nFrom 26 March to 3 April 1986, the band toured West Germany, the Netherlands and Denmark on their \"Easter Metal Blast\" and in June, played two dates in Bologna and Milan in Italy. The court case with Bronze was finally settled in the band's favour. The band's management instigated their own label, GWR. Recording took place in Master Rock Studios, London and the single \"Deaf Forever\" was released on 5 July as a taster for the \"Orgasmatron\" album, which was released on 9 August. On the same day as the release of the album, Lemmy and W\u00fcrzel were interviewed by Andy Kershaw on the BBC Radio 1 \"Saturday Live\" show and \"Orgasmatron\" and \"Deaf Forever\" were played. The single reached No. 67 and the album reached No. 21 in the UK charts.\nOn 16 August, the band played at the Monsters of Rock at Castle Donington and was recorded by BBC Radio 1 for a future \"Friday Rock Show\" broadcast. The performance closed with a flypast by a couple of Second World War German aircraft. Also that day Lemmy was filmed giving his views on spoof metal act \"Bad News\" for inclusion in a Peter Richardson Comic Strip film entitled \"More Bad News\" since the band featuring Rik Mayall, Peter Richardson, Nigel Planer and Adrian Edmondson were also performing at Donington. In September the band conducted their \"Orgasmatron\" tour in Great Britain, supported by fledgling act Zodiac Mindwarp and the Love Reaction. In October they toured America and in December were in West Germany.\nIn 1987, during the filming of \"Eat the Rich\" \u2013 in which Lemmy was taking a starring role alongside well-known comedy actors such as Robbie Coltrane, Kathy Burke, the regulars from the Comic Strip ensemble, and various other musician cameo appearances \u2013 Gill left the band and Taylor returned to appear in the band's cameo as \"In House Club Band\" alongside W\u00fcrzel and Campbell. The band wrote \"Eat the Rich\" especially for the film, its soundtrack featured tracks from \"Orgasmatron\" and W\u00fcrzel's solo single \"Bess\". The band's second album for GWR was \"Rock 'n' Roll\", released on 5 September, after a tight work schedule in the studio. While having some popular tracks and using \"Eat the Rich\" as its second track, the band commented that the album was virtually \"nailed together\".\nOn 2 July 1988 Mot\u00f6rhead were one of the performers at the Giants of Rock Festival in H\u00e4meenlinna, Finland. The tracks were released as \"No Sleep at All\" on 15 October. A single from the album was planned with the band wanting \"Traitor\" as the A-side, but \"Ace of Spades\" was chosen instead. When the band noticed the change, they refused to allow the single to be distributed to the shops, and it was withdrawn and became available only on the \"No Sleep at All\" tour and through the \"Mot\u00f6rheadbangers\" fan club. While they continued to play live shows during 1989 and 1990, Mot\u00f6rhead once again felt unhappy with their career, and a court case with GWR followed, which was not resolved until mid-1990.\n1990\u20131992: Epic/WTG years: \"1916\" and \"March \u00f6r Die\".\nWith the court case resolved, Mot\u00f6rhead signed to Epic/WTG and spent the last half of 1990 recording a new album and single in Los Angeles. Just prior to the album sessions the band's former manager, Doug Smith, released the recording of the band's 10th anniversary show, much against the bands wishes, having previously told him that they did not want it released, in 1986. In the studio they recorded four songs with producer Ed Stasium, before deciding he had to go.\nWhen Lemmy listened to one of the mixes of \"Going to Brazil\", he asked for him to turn up four tracks, and on doing so heard claves and tambourines that Stasium had added without their knowledge. Stasium was fired and Peter Solley was hired as producer. The story according to Stasium was that Lemmy's drug and alcohol intake had far exceeded the limitations of Stasium's patience so he quit. The single \"The One to Sing the Blues\" issued on 24 December 1990 (7\" and CD) and 5 January 1991 (12\"), was followed by the album \"1916\" on 21 January. The single, which was issued in 7\", cassette, shaped picture disc, 12\" and CD single, reached No. 45 in the UK Singles Chart, the album reached No. 24 in the UK Album Charts.\nThe band conducted their \"It Serves You Right\" tour of Britain in February, the \"Lights Out Over Europe\" tour followed, lasting until early April, when the band returned to Britain to play another six venues. In June the band played five dates in Japan and five dates in Australia and New Zealand. Between July and August, they played across the United States with Judas Priest, Alice Cooper, Metal Church and opener Dangerous Toys on the \"Operation Rock 'n' Roll\" tour. The band finished the year with six dates in Germany during December.\nOn 28 March 1992, the band played what would turn out to be Taylor's last engagement at Irvine Meadows, Irvine, California. The band had been wanting Lemmy to get rid of their manager, Doug Banker, for some time and after an unsolicited visit from Todd Singerman, who insisted he should manage them despite never having managed a band before, the band met with Singerman and decided to take him on board, firing Banker. In the midst of this, the band were recording an album at Music Grinder Studios, in the city's east part of Hollywood during the 1992 Los Angeles riots. Three drummers participated in the making of the \"March \u00f6r Die\" album: Phil Taylor, who was fired because he did not learn the drum tracks on the song \"I Ain't No Nice Guy\"; Tommy Aldridge who recorded most of the material on the album; and Mikkey Dee, who recorded \"Hellraiser\", a song originally written by Lemmy for Ozzy Osbourne's \"No More Tears\" album. \"March \u00f6r Die\" features guest appearances by Ozzy Osbourne and Slash.\n1993\u20131997: \"Bastards\", \"Sacrifice\", and \"Overnight Sensation\".\nLemmy had known Mikkey Dee from the time when King Diamond had toured with Mot\u00f6rhead. He had asked Dee to become Mot\u00f6rhead's drummer before, but Dee had declined due to his commitment to King Diamond. On this occasion, Dee was available and met the band to try out. Playing the song \"Hellraiser\" first, Lemmy thought \"he was very good immediately. It was obvious that it was going to work.\" After recording \"Hellraiser\" and \"Hell on Earth\" in the studio, Dee's first engagement with Mot\u00f6rhead was on 30 August at the Saratoga Performing Arts Center. The new line-up then went on tour, playing dates with Ozzy Osbourne, Skew Siskin and Exodus. On 27 September, the band played at the Los Angeles Coliseum with Metallica and Guns N' Roses. The band toured Argentina and Brazil during October and conducted the \"Bombers and Eagles in '92\" tour of Europe with Saxon throughout December.\nMot\u00f6rhead played two dates at the Arena Obras Sanitarias in Buenos Aires in April 1993 and toured Europe from early June until early July, returning to the United States to play one show at the New York Ritz on 14 August. A new producer was sought for the band's next album and eventually Howard Benson, who was to produce the band's next four albums, was chosen. The band recorded at A&amp;M Studios and Prime Time Studios in Hollywood and the resultant album, titled \"Bastards\", was released on 29 November 1993. The single \"Don't Let Daddy Kiss Me\" included the song \"Born to Raise Hell\", which also appeared on the album and would later be re-recorded with collaborative vocals from both Ice-T and Ugly Kid Joe frontman Whitfield Crane for the soundtrack of the movie \"Airheads\" (in which Lemmy also made a cameo appearance) and released as a single in its own right. Although \"Bastards\" received airtime, the record company ZYX Music would not pay for promotional copies, so the band sent out copies themselves. A further tour of Europe was made throughout December that year.\nIn February and March 1994, Mot\u00f6rhead toured the United States with Black Sabbath and Morbid Angel. In April the band resumed their tour of the States until early May, playing an engagement with the Ramones on 14 May at the Estadio Velez in Buenos Aires, attracting a crowd of 50,000 people. The band toured Japan in late May and Europe in June, August and December.\nThe band's 1995 touring schedule began in Europe in late April. In June, they went on a second tour with Black Sabbath, this time supported by Tiamat, until the band succumbed to influenza and headed back to Los Angeles and Cherokee Studios in Hollywood where they were to record an album. During the sessions it became clear that W\u00fcrzel was not extending himself and left the band after the recording. The title track from the album, \"Sacrifice\", was later used in the movie \"Tromeo and Juliet\", a film in which Lemmy appears as the narrator. The band decided to continue as a three-man line-up and a tour of Europe was performed throughout October and the first two days of November. A three-day tour of South America followed the week after. Lemmy celebrated his 50th Birthday later that year with the band at the Whisky a Go Go in Los Angeles; Metallica played at the event under the name the Lemmy's.\nIn 1996, the band began touring the States in early January and played 30 venues up to 15 February; a seven-date tour of Europe in June and July was followed by two engagements in South America during August. A tour of the United States with Belladonna and Speedball began with two shows (Los Angeles &amp; Hollywood) in early October 1996 and concluded in Washington on 4 December. During this time the band had recorded \"Overnight Sensation\", at Ocean Studio and Track House Recording Studio. The album was released on 15 October, the first official album of the band as a three-piece since \"Another Perfect Day\" and the best distributed album the band had had for years. The band concluded the year's touring with 13 dates in Germany.\nDuring 1997, the band toured extensively, beginning with the first leg of the \"Overnight Sensation\" tour in Europe on 12 January at the London Astoria, where the guest musicians were Todd Campbell, Phil Campbell's son, on \"Ace of Spades\" and \"Fast\" Eddie Clarke for \"Overkill\". The European leg lasted until March and was followed by four dates in Japan, from late May to 1 June, and an American tour with W.A.S.P. throughout the rest of June. In August, three dates in Europe were followed by seven dates in Britain, which ended with a show at the Brixton Academy on 25 October, where the guest musician was Paul Inder, Lemmy's son, for \"Ace of Spades\". A further four dates in October in Russia concluded the year 1997.\n1998\u20132003: \"Snake Bite Love\", \"We Are Mot\u00f6rhead\", and \"Hammered\".\nLemmy recalled that the touring was going particularly well, with some countries like Argentina and Japan putting the band in larger venues, and the English promoters discovered that \"they could turn a nice profit with Mot\u00f6rhead shows\". In his opinion, the three-piece line-up was performing excellently and it was high time they made another live record. The band did eventually, but made another studio album first, \"Snake Bite Love\", recorded in various studios and released on 3 March 1998.\nThe band joined with Judas Priest at the Los Angeles Universal Amphitheatre on 3 April, to begin their \"Snake Bite Love\" tour. On 21 May, Mot\u00f6rhead were recorded at The Docks in Hamburg. The tracks from this performance were later released as \"Everything Louder Than Everyone Else\". The band were invited to join the Ozzfest Tour and played dates across the States during early July until early August and were in Europe from early October until late November. The British leg of the tour was dubbed the \"No Speak With Forked Tongue\" tour and included support bands Groop Dogdrill, Radiator and Psycho Squad, which was fronted by Phil Campbell's son Todd.\nIn 1999 Mot\u00f6rhead made a tour of the states between 20 April and 2 June, before going to Karo Studios in Brackel, Germany to record their next album, \"We Are Mot\u00f6rhead\", which was released in May the following year. During the time the album sessions took place, the band played at venues around Europe, the first of which was at Fila Forum in Assago, near Milan, where Metallica's James Hetfield joined the band on-stage to play \"Overkill\". In October and early November, the band toured the states with Nashville Pussy. Throughout the rest of November, the band conducted their European \"Monsters of the Millennium\" tour with Manowar, Dio and Lion's Share, ending the Millennium with two shows at the London Astoria. The two shows were billed under the \"Kerrang!\" \"X-Fest\" banner and at the first show were supported by Backyard Babies and during the second show guest vocals were provided by Skin from Skunk Anansie and Nina C. Alice from Skew Siskin for \"Born to Raise Hell\", and Ace from Skunk Anansie played \"Overkill\" with the band.\nIn May 2000, the release of \"We Are Mot\u00f6rhead\" and the single from it, a cover of the Sex Pistol's \"God Save the Queen\", coincided with the start of the band's \"We Are Mot\u00f6rhead\" tour across South and North America during May and June, with a further nine shows across in Europe in July. Shows in the United States and France were followed by the release of a double-disc compilation album, \"The Best Of\", on 26 August.\nFour dates in Japan preceded the band's 25th anniversary concert on 22 October at the Brixton Academy in London, where guest appearances were made by \"Fast\" Eddie Clarke, Brian May, Doro Pesch, Whitfield Crane, Ace, Paul Inder and Todd Campbell. The show also featured the return of the Bomber lighting rig. The event was filmed and released the following year as the \"25 &amp; Alive Boneshaker\" DVD, and the CD of the show, \"Live at Brixton Academy\", was released two years after that. Lemmy states the reason for the DVD as wanting \"to record it for the posterity or whatever it is. I nodded off through the 10th anniversary, we never did anything on the 20th, so the 25th made sense.\"\nA tour of West and East Europe followed the anniversary concert, taking the band through October, November and December. The schedule for the Eastern European tour was quite brutal, involving two 18-hour drives back-to-back and little time off, at the Warsaw venue the band did not arrive until 11 o'clock and the crew were still loading into the venue at one in the morning, while the fans waited.\nAfter taking a month off, the band began working on a new album at Chuck Reid's house in the Hollywood Hills. This album, \"Hammered\", was released the following year. On 1 April 2001, the band gave a one-song performance for Triple H's entrance at WrestleMania X-Seven at the Reliant Astrodome in Houston. The second leg of the \"We Are Mot\u00f6rhead\" tour began in May in Ireland, moving across to the United Kingdom. In Manchester, the band were supported by Goldblade, and by Pure Rubbish at the two London shows. The second London show also included Backyard Babies and Paul Inder, who was guest musician for \"Killed By Death\". Between June and August, Mot\u00f6rhead played at a number of rock festivals in Europe; including as the Graspop Metal Meeting in Belgium, the Quart Festival in Norway, and the Wacken Open Air on 4 August, where four songs were recorded for the \"25 &amp; Alive Boneshaker\" DVD. The band returned to the States for a seven show tour between late September and early October.\nIn April 2002, a DVD of some of Mot\u00f6rhead's performances from the 1970s and 1980s along with some stock footage of the band was released as \"The Best of Mot\u00f6rhead\". Two weeks earlier, the \"Hammered\" album was released and supported by the \"Hammered\" tour, which kicked off in the States at around the same time. The United States dates continued until late May, and a European leg followed between June and August. In October, the band played five dates in Great Britain with Anthrax, Skew Siskin and Psycho Squad. The final venue was the Wembley Arena in London, where instead of Psycho Squad, the band were supported by Hawkwind, with Lemmy performing \"Silver Machine\" on stage with them. Throughout the rest of October and better part of November, the band were on a European tour with Anthrax.\nIn April and May 2003, the band continued to promote the \"Hammered\" album in the States, and on the three dates Phil Campbell had to miss, his mother having died, Todd Youth stood in for him. Between late May and mid-July the band played seven dates at Summer Festivals in Europe and from late-July until the end of August, they were touring the United States with Iron Maiden and Dio. On 7 October a comprehensive five-disc collection of the band's recordings covering 1975\u20132002 was released as \"Stone Deaf Forever!\". On 1 September 2003, the band returned to Hollywood's Whisky A Go-Go club for the Hollywood Rock Walk of Fame Induction. During October, the band performed a tour of Great Britain with the Wildhearts and Young Heart Attack. The band performed seven shows across Belgium, the Netherlands and Spain between 21 and 28 October and from late November until early December they were in Germany and Switzerland, touring with Skew Siskin and Mustasch. On 9 December, the previously recorded \"Live at Brixton Academy\" album was released.\n2004\u20132009: \"Inferno\", \"Kiss of Death\", and \"Mot\u00f6rizer\".\nMot\u00f6rhead performed an invitation-only concert at the Royal Opera House in Covent Garden, London on 22 February 2004; at Summer Festivals in South America during May; and in Europe during June, July and August. They had already spent time in the studio, working on \"Inferno\", which was released on 22 June and followed by the \"Inferno\" tour of Ireland with Class of Zero for three dates. Joined by Sepultura, the tour hit Great Britain. Some of the London show at the Hammersmith Apollo was filmed for TV as Gene Simmons introduced the extra opening act the Class, made up of school children from his Channel 4 series \"Rock School\". W\u00fcrzel guested on \"Overkill\". The band continued the tour with Sepultura across Europe through the rest of November and December. At the show in Magdeburg, Germany on 4 December Mot\u00f6rhead joined Sepultura on stage during their support slot playing the song \"Orgasmatron\", in celebration of Sepultura's 20th Anniversary. The show on 7 December at the Philipshalle in D\u00fcsseldorf was recorded and later released as the \"Stage Fright\" DVD.\nMot\u00f6rhead picked up their first Grammy in the awards of 2005 in the Best Metal Performance category for their cover of Metallica's \"Whiplash\" on \"\". \"They've managed to get the knife in,\" Lemmy grumbled. \"It was only a mercy fuck \u2013 it was our 30th anniversary. If they gave us a Grammy for one of our albums or songs, it would mean something.\"\nFrom March until early May 2005, the band toured the United States, and in June and August were on the \"30th Anniversary\" tour in Europe. On 22 August, they were the subject of an hour-long documentary, \"Live Fast, Die Old\", aired on Channel 4 as part of \"The Other Side\" series of documentaries, filmed by new and established directors.\nOn 20 September, a compilation containing the band's appearances on BBC Radio 1 and a concert recording from Paris Theatre, London, was released as \"BBC Live &amp; In-Session\". In October, the band toured Europe with Mondo Generator before returning to Britain to tour with In Flames and Girlschool in October and November. During the show at the Brixton Academy on 19 November, Lemmy joined Girlschool on stage to play \"Please Don't Touch\". Mot\u00f6rhead finished the year's tours in December, with two engagements in New Zealand and five in Australia with M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce. Also in 2005, Mot\u00f6rhead played on the Vaya Con Tioz farewell festival B\u00f6hse Onkelz at Lausitzring. In 2006, the band performed a four-date House of Blues tour in the States in March with Meldrum and from June until early August played at European open-air festivals with some indoor headlining shows. On 28 October, the band performed at The Rock Freakers Ball in Kansas City before heading off to tour Great Britain with Clutch and Crucified Barbara.\nDuring that tour, \"Kiss of Death\" was released on 29 August 2006 via Sanctuary Records, with a video for \"Be My Baby\". The tour ended on 25 November at the Brixton Academy, where Phil Campbell played on \"Killed By Death\" during Crucified Barbara's support set. Twelve shows in Europe with Meldrum took them through the end of November to early December, the first two shows also featuring Skew Siskin.\nIn November, the band agreed to a sponsorship deal with the Greenbank B under-10s football team from North Hykeham, Lincoln, putting the band's name as well as War-Pig on the team's shirts; the under-10s run out to \"Ace of Spades\". Lemmy is old friends with Gary Weight, the team's manager; Weight \"sent an email off to them and they came back and said it was a great idea\" and hopes the deal will draw inspired performances from his team. On 25 April 2007, the band played at the Poliedro de Caracas in Caracas, Venezuela, and on 29 April at the Fundi\u00e7ao Progresso, Rio de Janeiro. In June, Mot\u00f6rhead played an engagement at the Royal Festival Hall as part of Jarvis Cocker's Meltdown. On 26 February 2008, \"No Sleep 'til Hammersmith\" was reissued again as a two disc CD.\nFrom March through to June 2008, the band convened in Los Angeles with producer Cameron Webb to begin work on their 19th album \"Mot\u00f6rizer\". Mikkey Dee's drum tracks were recorded at Dave Grohl's studio. \"Mot\u00f6rizer\" was released on 26 August. It does not feature artwork by Joe Petagno, the artist who designed many of their classic covers. In June 2008 the band performed on the main stage of the Download festival. Between 6 and 31 August, Mot\u00f6rhead joined Judas Priest, Heaven &amp; Hell and Testament on the Metal Masters Tour. On 20 August the band played at the Roseland Ballroom, New York, as part of \"The Volcom Tour 2008\", which continued with the Misfits, Airbourne, Valient Thorr and Year Long Disaster at House of Blues, Anaheim, California, on 2 September, playing a further thirteen dates. The band concluded the tour without the supporting bands, playing one more show at the Roseland Ballroom on 20 September, and the final engagement, at The Stone Pony, Asbury Park, New Jersey on 21 September.\nOn 30 September, Reuters reported that Neverdie Studios had signed a deal with Lemmy and Mot\u00f6rhead to develop and market Lemmy's Castle and Motorhead Stadium inside the virtual world of Entropia Universe, an online universe. The year's touring ended with a 34-date tour of Europe with a variety of support bands including Danko Jones, Saxon, Witchcraft, and Airbourne.\nOn 6 March 2009, the band played in the Middle East for the first time, at the annual Dubai Desert Rock Festival. On 1 April Mot\u00f6rhead were reported to have entered into a two-year sponsorship deal with UK Roller Derby team the Lincolnshire Bombers Roller Girls. That September, noted drummer Matt Sorum filled in for Mikkey Dee for a U.S. tour. \"I was absolutely blown away and was very honoured to get the call,\" Sorum said. \"You know what I love about Lemmy? He's always on time. We go on stage, no delays. Being in bands where you have to wait around for a couple of hours fucks you up.\"\nIn November 2009, the band were supported by NWOBHM veterans Sweet Savage on the Irish leg of the tour (30 years after first sharing the stage together) and punk and goth rock legends the Damned on the UK leg of their world tour. On the Damned's official website, Captain Sensible said: \"Ha ha ... we're working with Lemmy again, are we? Excellent! He's the real deal, the absolute antithesis to all that the likes of Simon Cowell stand for. And for that we should all be grateful. This tour will be a celebration of all things rock 'n' roll ... pity the poor roadies is all I can say!\"\n2010\u20132015: \"The W\u00f6rld Is Yours\", \"Aftershock\", and \"Bad Magic\".\nIn a November 2009 interview with ABORT Magazine's E.S. Day, Lemmy said that Mot\u00f6rhead would enter the studio in February 2010 \"to rehearse, write and record\" their 20th studio album, to be released by the end of the year. The album was recorded with Cameron Webb and Welsh producer Romesh Dodangoda in Longwave Studio, Cardiff. In an interview with Hungarian television in July 2010, drummer Mikkey Dee announced that the album was finished, with 11 tracks. The album's name was said to be \"The W\u00f6rld Is Yours\". On 3 November 2010, Future plc, a UK media company, announced that Mot\u00f6rhead were to release \"The W\u00f6rld is Yours\" via an exclusive publishing deal with \"Classic Rock\" magazine on 14 December 2010. The standard CD release of \"The W\u00f6rld is Yours\" would go on sale on 17 January 2011, through Mot\u00f6rhead's own label, Mot\u00f6rhead Music.\nTo coincide with the release of their upcoming album, Mot\u00f6rhead embarked on a 35th Anniversary UK tour, from 8\u201328 November 2010, and a European tour from 30 November 2010 \u2013 19 December 2010. They also took their tour to the Americas in 2011. In October, the band recorded a slow blues version of their longtime hit \"Ace of Spades\" for a TV spot for Kronenbourg beer. On 5 December the single \"Get Back in Line\" was released, followed by the release of a video for the single on 6 December. In December, Mikkey Dee stated to French journalists that Mot\u00f6rhead are planning to release a box-set with several DVDs in 2011. He did not give any details but said that it will come in a \"beautiful package including many surprises\".\nOn 17 January 2011, it was announced that Mot\u00f6rhead would be part of the Sonisphere Festival in Knebworth. In August 2011, they headlined the Brutal Assault open-air festival in the Czech Republic. On 2 March 2011 Mot\u00f6rhead performed on \"Late Night with Jimmy Fallon\".\nOn 9 July 2011, former guitarist W\u00fcrzel died of a heart attack. In celebration of 35 years' touring, in late 2011 the band released the live DVD \"The W\u00f6rld Is Ours \u2013 Vol 1 \u2013 Everywhere Further Than Everyplace Else\", including performances at the O2 Apollo Manchester, Best Buy Theater, New York City and Teatro Caupolic\u00e1n, Santiago de Chile. On 19 December 2011, it was announced that Mot\u00f6rhead would play at the German festivals Rock am Ring and Rock im Park in N\u00fcrburgring and Nuremberg respectively in June 2012. On 12 January 2012, it was announced that Mot\u00f6rhead were touring the US and Canada in early 2012, along with three other metal bands Megadeth, Volbeat and Lacuna Coil. The Gigantour took place from 26 January to 28 February 2012, but Mot\u00f6rhead missed the final four shows because Lemmy had a combination of an upper respiratory viral infection and voice strain, resulting in severe laryngitis. Lemmy wrote on Facebook, \"I'm giving my voice a good rest\", hoping he would recover soon to play at the Mayhem Festival, which was held from 30 June to 5 August 2012. Mot\u00f6rhead also took part on 23 June in the Rock-A-Field Luxembourg Open Air Festival in Roeser.\nIn an April 2012 interview with Classic Rock Revisited, Lemmy was asked if Mot\u00f6rhead were planning to make a follow-up to \"The W\u00f6rld Is Yours\". He replied, \"We have not started writing any songs yet but we will. We put out an album out every two years. I will continue to do that as long as I can afford an amp.\" On 28 June 2012, Lemmy told Auburn Reporter that Mot\u00f6rhead will release their next album in 2013 and they had written \"about 6 songs so far.\" On 23 October 2012, Lemmy told Billboard.com that the band had planned to enter the studio in January to begin recording the album for a mid-2013 release. On 28 February 2013, it was announced that Mot\u00f6rhead had begun recording their new album. Mot\u00f6rhead released the live DVD \"The W\u00f6rld Is Ours \u2013 Vol. 2 \u2013 Anyplace Crazy As Anywhere Else\" in September 2012. On 18 June 2013, the new album's title was revealed to be \"Aftershock\".\nIn mid-November 2013, Mot\u00f6rhead were due to embark on a European tour alongside Saxon, followed by a tour in Germany and Scandinavia due to last until mid December 2013 but the dates were postponed and rescheduled for February and March 2014 due to Lemmy's health problems. However, in January 2014, Mot\u00f6rhead announced the cancellation of the new February and March dates of their European tour as Lemmy was still to reach full recovery from diabetes related health problems. But the same month, the band was confirmed for Coachella Festival to take place across two weekends in spring 2014 (12\u201314 and 19\u201321 April) in Indio, California, the exact dates to be revealed as 13 and 20 April 2014. In February 2014, Mot\u00f6rhead confirmed a Summer tour 2014 with eight European dates (from 24 June to 10 August) in France (2 dates), Switzerland, Italy, Germany (2 dates), Russia and Ukraine. In March 2014, the band announced a Los Angeles date on 11 April 2014 at Club Nokia. Later on, two new dates on 17 and 18 April 2014 respectively in Las Vegas (Pearl) and San Francisco (Warfield) were added. Still in March 2014, Mot\u00f6rhead announced that three heavy metal bands Megadeth, Anthrax and themselves would perform from 22 to 26 September 2014 at the first annual Mot\u00f6rhead's Mot\u00f6rboat cruise on board the Carnival Ecstasy (self-proclaimed \"The Loudest Boat in the World\"), due to sail from Miami and visit the ports of Key West and the Cozumel island just off Mexico's Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula.\nIn a September 2014 interview on Full Metal Jackie, Lemmy stated that Mot\u00f6rhead would \"probably\" enter the studio in January 2015 to start work on their 22nd studio album for a tentative late 2015 release. On 25 February 2015, Mot\u00f6rhead officially confirmed that they were in the studio recording their new album in Los Angeles with longtime producer Cameron Webb. On 27 May 2015, the band released teasers on their Facebook page with the roman number \"XXXX\" on it. On 4 June the new album (which would be their last) \"Bad Magic\" was launched for pre-order on Amazon, revealing its title and cover art which also shows the \"XXXX\", coinciding with the 40th anniversary of the band. The album was released on 28 August 2015. The band performed at the UK's Glastonbury Festival in June 2015. Their final UK gig was at the Eden Project on 27 June 2015.\nWhile touring the album as the \"40th anniversary Tour\", Mot\u00f6rhead had to cut short their Salt Lake City show on 27 August 2015 (in the Rocky Mountains) due to Lemmy's breathing problems (the result of an altitude sickness) and then they had to cancel completely day-off their Denver Riot Fest set on 28 August 2015. Their tour picked up again on 1 September 2015 at Emo's in Austin, Texas (moved from Cedar Park Center) but the group were again forced to abandon their set after three songs and to cancel subsequent shows (from the show on 2 September 2015 in San Antonio, Texas to the show on 5 September 2015 in Houston, Texas included).\nDespite his ongoing health issues forcing Mot\u00f6rhead to cut short or cancel several US shows, Lemmy Kilmister was able to bounce back in time for the trio's annual Mot\u00f6rboat heavy metal cruise from Miami to the Bahamas which ran from 28 September through 2 October 2015 including performances by bands such as Slayer, Anthrax, Exodus, Suicidal Tendencies and Corrosion of Conformity. For this occasion, Mot\u00f6rhead performed live two entire (identical) sets on 30 September and 1 October 2015.\nMot\u00f6rhead continued the \"40th Anniversary Tour\" in Europe in November and December. They played concerts in Germany, Sweden, Norway and Finland. Their final concert was in Berlin, Germany on 11 December 2015. After Lemmy's death, drummer Mikkey Dee spoke in an interview about him: \"He was terribly gaunt. He spent all his energy on stage and afterwards he was very, very tired. It's incredible that he could even play, that he could finish the Europe tour. It was only 20 days ago. Unbelievable.\" The \"40th Anniversary Tour\" was planned to continue in January 2016 in the band's home country the UK, the first concert would have been in Newcastle on 23 January 2016.\n2015: Lemmy's death and break-up.\nOn 28 December 2015, Lemmy died, four days after celebrating his 70th birthday. He was the second Mot\u00f6rhead member to die in 2015, following Phil Taylor the previous month. The band posted the following message on Facebook:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;There is no easy way to say this... our mighty, noble friend Lemmy passed away today after a short battle with an extremely aggressive cancer. He had learnt of the disease on December 26th, and was at home, sitting in front of his favourite video game from The Rainbow which had recently made its way down the street, with his family.\nWe cannot begin to express our shock and sadness, there aren't words.\nWe will say more in the coming days, but for now, please... play Mot\u00f6rhead loud, play Hawkwind loud, play Lemmy's music LOUD.\nHave a drink or few.\nShare stories.\nCelebrate the LIFE this lovely, wonderful man celebrated so vibrantly himself.\nHE WOULD WANT EXACTLY THAT.\nIan 'Lemmy' Kilmister\n1945\u20132015\nBorn to lose, lived to win.\nThe following day, drummer Mikkey Dee confirmed that Mot\u00f6rhead would not continue, stating, \"Mot\u00f6rhead is over, of course. Lemmy was Mot\u00f6rhead. We won't be doing any more tours or anything. And there won't be any more records. But the brand survives, and Lemmy lives on in the hearts of everyone.\" Two days after Lemmy's death, guitarist Phil Campbell also stated that \"Mot\u00f6rhead is no longer\".\nA few days later, the band's long-time manager Todd Singerman told the press that Lemmy had experienced chest pains two days after his 70th birthday party (held at Whisky a Go Go) and visited into the emergency room, but was released the next day. However, Singerman was concerned because Lemmy's speech was \"getting bad\" and took him to a brain scan. On 26 December the doctor came into Lemmy's apartment, \"brought the results and told us all that he has two to six months to live\". Lemmy reacted calmly. \"He took it better than all of us\", said Singerman. \"His only comment was, 'Oh, only two months, huh?' The doctor goes, 'Yeah, Lem, I don't want to bullshit you. It's bad, and there's nothing anyone can do. I would be lying to you if I told you there was a chance.'\" Plans were made to treat Lemmy at home. A video game console at the Rainbow Bar and Grill that Lemmy loved to play was brought to his apartment. On 28 December 2015, he spent hours on the console, and Rainbow owner Mikael Maglieri paid a visit. Lemmy died in his sleep later that day.\nAn autopsy on Kilmister showed that the causes of death were prostate cancer, a cardiac arrhythmia, and congestive heart failure.\n2016\u2013present: Aftermath and posthumous releases.\nSince Mot\u00f6rhead's break-up, Campbell and Dee have remained musically active. Campbell went on to form Phil Campbell and the Bastard Sons. The band originally focused on performing Mot\u00f6rhead songs at major festivals. The band has subsequently performed in supporting slots with Guns N' Roses, Hawkwind, Saxon, and Airbourne. Following their debut album \"The Age of Absurdity\", released in January 2018 they have gone on to produce several acclaimed albums of their own material and to establish a reputation as a successful touring band in their own right. Dee joined Thin Lizzy to play on their anniversary shows in January 2016. However, on 19 April, it was announced that he would not be participating. Subsequently, it was announced that Dee would be filling in for James Kottak on the Scorpions' twelve North American headlining dates, including a run of shows at the Hard Rock Hotel in Las Vegas dubbed \"Scorpions blacked out in Las Vegas\". Dee later joined the band permanently.\nInitially planned on 27 May 2016, UDR Music released on 10 June 2016 \"Clean Your Clock\", a Mot\u00f6rhead archive live album featuring material recorded at the 20 and 21 November 2015 shows at the Zenith in Munich. On 1 September 2017, Mot\u00f6rhead released \"Under C\u00f6ver\", a covers album featuring covers throughout Mot\u00f6rhead's history, along with covers only found on tribute albums, and new recordings.\nFormer Mot\u00f6rhead guitarist \"Fast\" Eddie Clarke died on 10 January 2018 after a battle with pneumonia at the age of 67, making him the last member of the band's classic line-up (following Taylor and Lemmy) to die.\nOriginal Mot\u00f6rhead guitarist Larry Wallis died on 19 September 2019 at age 70 from an unknown cause.\nOn 27 June 2025, a \"lost\" Mot\u00f6rhead album called \"The Manticore Tapes\" was released. It is a compilation of tracks that were recorded in August 1976 at Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer's Manticore Studio in Fulham, representing the first recorded material from the lineup of Lemmy, Taylor and Clarke.\nMusical style.\nAllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote: \"Mot\u00f6rhead's overwhelmingly loud and fast style of heavy metal was one of the most groundbreaking styles the genre had to offer in the late '70s\" and though \"Mot\u00f6rhead wasn't punk rock ... they were the first metal band to harness that energy and, in the process, they created speed metal and thrash metal.\"\nAlthough Mot\u00f6rhead is often considered a heavy metal band, Lemmy always described Mot\u00f6rhead's music as simply \"rock and roll\". In 2011, he said: \"We were not heavy metal. We were a rock 'n' roll band. Still are. Everyone always describes us as heavy metal even when I tell them otherwise. Why won't people listen?\" In 2014, he reiterated to \"Der Spiegel\" that he did not particularly like heavy metal.\nLemmy had stated that he generally felt more kinship with punk rockers than with heavy metal bands: Mot\u00f6rhead had engagements with fellow Brits, the Damned, with whom he played bass on a handful of late 1970s engagements, as well as having penned the song \"R.A.M.O.N.E.S.\" as a tribute to the Ramones. Mot\u00f6rhead, Lemmy stated, have more in common aesthetically with the Damned than Black Sabbath, and nothing whatsoever in common with Judas Priest. Lemmy said he felt little kinship with the speed metal bands Mot\u00f6rhead have inspired:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;They've just got the wrong bit. They think that being fast and loud is the whole thing and it isn't. The guitar solos are not really difficult for a guitar player, it's just playing scales. To feel a solo and bend into it &amp; I mean Hendrix is the best guitarist you've ever seen in your life. And he learned from people like Buddy Guy, Lightnin' Hopkins and people like that inspired Hendrix. To be influenced by something, you're gonna have to play it the same.\nThe \"NME\" stated that their brief solos were just long enough \"... to open another bottle of beer\", while a 1977 \"Stereo Review\" commented that \"they know they're like animals, and they don't want to appear any other way. In view of the many ugly frogs in heavy metal who think they are God's gift to womankind these Quasimodos even seem charming in their own way\". Mot\u00f6rhead's approach did not change drastically over the band's career, though this is a deliberate choice: erstwhile Mot\u00f6rhead drummer Phil \"Philthy Animal\" Taylor said that rock icons like Chuck Berry and Little Richard never drastically altered their style, and, like them, Mot\u00f6rhead preferred to play what they enjoyed and did best. This fondness for the first decade of rock and roll (mid-1950s to mid-1960s) is also reflected in some of Mot\u00f6rhead's occasional cover songs from that era.\nLemmy often played power chords in his basslines. When asked about whether he had begun as a rhythm guitarist, he stated:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;No, I play a lot of notes, but I also play a lot of chords. And I play a lot of open strings. I just don't play like a bass player. There are complaints about me from time to time. It's not like having a bass player; it's like having a deep guitarist.\nName and logo.\nThe name \"Mot\u00f6rhead\" is a reference to users of the drug amphetamine. The band's distinctive fanged-face logo, with its oversized boar's tusks, chains, and spikes, was created by artist Joe Petagno in 1977 for the cover of the \"Mot\u00f6rhead\" album and has appeared in many variations on covers of ensuing albums. The fanged face has been referred to variously as \"War-Pig\" and \"Snaggletooth\". The band's name is usually printed in a lowercase form of blackletter. The umlaut character \u00f6 is possibly derived from the similar \"heavy metal umlaut\" in the name of their 1975 acquaintances Blue \u00d6yster Cult. However, this umlaut does not alter the pronunciation of the band's name. When asked if Germans pronounced the band \"Motuuuurhead\", Lemmy answered \"No, they don't. I only put it in there to look mean\". \nSnaggletooth is the fanged face that serves as the symbol of Mot\u00f6rhead. Artist Joe Petagno drew it in 1977 for the cover of the band's debut album (with designer Phil Smee who turned it into a negative and did the lettering to complete the logo), having met Lemmy while doing some work with Hawkwind. Petagno stated:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The inspiration came from just being a naturally pissed-off bastard! And Lemmy's the same way! So it was bound to be an alchemal wedding of a more \"primordial nature\". I did a lot of research on skull types and found a cross-breed gorilla-wolf-dog combination would work nicely with some oversized boars horns. Lemmy added Helmet, chains, spit, spikes and grit.\nEddie Clarke was less sure about the imagery to begin with:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I shuddered when I saw it the first time. I thought, \"Blimey, this ain't gonna go down that well\", because it was just way over the top, then. But I grew to love it ... [At first] it was not scary or horrifying, it would've been, in those days, deemed bad taste.\nIt has remained a symbol of Mot\u00f6rhead throughout the years, with Petagno creating many variations of Snaggletooth/War-Pig, for the covers of ensuing albums. Only two of the original covers for Mot\u00f6rhead's 22 studio albums do not feature any variation of War-Pig on the cover: \"On Parole\" and \"Overnight Sensation\" (of which, \"On Parole\" was never sanctioned by the band), and was in any case reissued with a black Snaggletooth on a white background. Phil is wearing a Snaggletooth badge on the cover of \"Ace of Spades\". The cover of \"Iron Fist\" depicts a metal gauntlet wearing four skull-shaped rings, one of which is Snaggletooth, while the rear of the album-sleeve shows a fully detailed metal sculpture of the symbol. Originally the Snaggletooth design included a swastika on one of the helmet's spikes. This was painted out on later re-releases of the albums on CD.\nOn 21 September 2007, Petagno announced that \"there will be no more \"HEADS\" from my hand\", citing irreconcilable differences between himself and the band's current management, Singerman Entertainment. Petagno stated:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;It has been a long, exciting and industrious journey, full of art and intuition, difference in repetition, and creative innovation. I feel I accomplished something unique in Metal history over the last 31 years by breathing life again and again into a figment of my own imagination, an image or better an entity which has taken on a life of its own, which I actually believe goes beyond the music it was created to represent. I'm damn proud of that!\nIn reply, Lemmy stated:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;As many of you know, we have been working with Joe Petagno for 31 years. We always treated Joe fairly, and I would like to stress that at no time did my manager demand what Joe thinks he demanded \u2014 it is all a colossal misunderstanding. We have always loved his artwork, obviously, and if he now decides to stop working with us, we have no choice but to use someone else. However ... if he will not discuss this personally and try to work things out, I think it's a great tragedy. If Joe continues with us, no one would be more delighted than me. If it's goodbye, Joe, I wish you well, but I hope, even at this stage, to be reconciled and continue our association.\nProfessional wrestling.\nMot\u00f6rhead are well known in the professional wrestling world for performing wrestler Triple H's entrance music, \"The Game\", which he has used as his entrance music since January 2001. In addition to the song playing whenever Triple H appears on WWE programming such as \"Raw\" or \"SmackDown\", and at other pay-per-view wrestling events, the band have performed the song live for him at WrestleMania X-Seven and WrestleMania 21. Their song \"Rock Out\" was also used as the theme song of the WWE pay-per-view Unforgiven in 2008. Mot\u00f6rhead also provided the entrance music for Triple H's faction Evolution, entitled \"Line in the Sand\". \"The Game\" was released on both the American version of the \"Hammered\" and \"WWF The Music, Vol. 5\" albums, and \"Line in the Sand\" was released on the \"\" album. Mot\u00f6rhead have since performed a third entrance track for Triple H, entitled \"King of Kings\", which made its debut at WrestleMania 22 in April 2006. Triple H has also introduced the band in concert. Lemmy inspired Triple H's facial hair, and Triple H spoke at Lemmy's funeral.\nMotorhead also covered Metallica's \"Enter Sandman\" for the \"ECW Extreme Music\" album, released in 1998.\nAwards and nominations.\nClassic Rock Roll of Honour Awards.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Awards table/styles.css\" /&gt;\nRock and Roll Hall of Fame.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Awards table/styles.css\" /&gt;\n! scope=\"col\" | Year\n! scope=\"col\" | Nominee / work\n! scope=\"col\" | Award\n! scope=\"col\" | Result\nDiscography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nTours.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nVideo game.\n\"Mot\u00f6rhead\", a side-scrolling beat 'em up based on the band, was released for the Amiga only in the UK in 1992 and was published by Virgin Games, Ltd. and developed by Kaitsu Software.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Together, these universes are presumed to comprise everything that exists: the entirety of space, time, matter, energy, information, and the physical laws and constants that describe them. The different universes within the multiverse are called \"parallel universes\", \"flat universes\", \"other universes\", \"alternate universes\", \"multiple universes\", \"plane universes\", \"parent and child universes\", \"many universes\", or \"many worlds\". One common assumption is that the multiverse is a \"patchwork quilt of separate universes all bound by the same laws of physics.\"\nThe concept of multiple universes, or a multiverse, has been discussed throughout history. It has evolved and has been debated in various fields, including cosmology, physics, and philosophy. Some physicists have argued that the multiverse is a philosophical notion rather than a scientific hypothesis, as it cannot be empirically falsified. In recent years, there have been proponents and skeptics of multiverse theories within the physics community. Although some scientists have analyzed data in search of evidence for other universes, no statistically significant evidence has been found. Critics argue that the multiverse concept lacks testability and falsifiability, which are essential for scientific inquiry, and that it raises unresolved metaphysical issues.\nMax Tegmark and Brian Greene have proposed different classification schemes for multiverses and universes. Tegmark's four-level classification consists of Level I: an extension of our universe, Level II: universes with different physical constants, Level III: many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics, and Level IV: ultimate ensemble. Brian Greene's nine types of multiverses include quilted, inflationary, brane, cyclic, landscape, quantum, holographic, simulated, and ultimate. The ideas explore various dimensions of space, physical laws, and mathematical structures to explain the existence and interactions of multiple universes. Some other multiverse concepts include twin-world models, cyclic theories, M-theory, and black-hole cosmology.\nThe anthropic principle suggests that the existence of a multitude of universes, each with different physical laws, could explain the asserted appearance of fine-tuning of our own universe for conscious life. The weak anthropic principle posits that we exist in one of the few universes that support life. Debates around Occam's razor and the simplicity of the multiverse versus a single universe arise, with proponents like Max Tegmark arguing that the multiverse is simpler and more elegant. The many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics and modal realism, the belief that all possible worlds exist and are as real as our world, are also subjects of debate in the context of the anthropic principle.\nHistory of the concept.\nAccording to some, the idea of infinite worlds was first suggested by the pre-Socratic Greek philosopher Anaximander in the sixth century BCE. However, there is debate as to whether he believed in multiple worlds, and if he did, whether those worlds were co-existent or successive.\nThe first figures to whom historians can definitively attribute the concept of innumerable worlds are the Ancient Greek Atomists, beginning with Leucippus and Democritus in the 5th century BCE, followed by Epicurus (341\u2013270 BCE) and the Roman Epicurean Lucretius (1st century BCE). In the third century BCE, the philosopher Chrysippus suggested that the world eternally expired and regenerated, effectively suggesting the existence of multiple universes across time. The concept of multiple universes became more defined in the Middle Ages. In the Renaissance, Giordano Bruno (1548\u20131600) expressed the concept of infinite worlds.\nThe American philosopher and psychologist William James used the term \"multiverse\" in 1895, but in a different context.\nThe concept first appeared in the modern scientific context in the course of the debate between Boltzmann and Zermelo in 1895.\nIn Dublin in 1952, Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger gave a lecture in which he jocularly warned his audience that what he was about to say might \"seem lunatic\". He said that when his equations seemed to describe several different histories, these were \"not alternatives, but all really happen simultaneously\". This sort of duality is called \"superposition\".\nSearch for evidence.\nIn the 1990s, after recent works of fiction about the concept gained popularity, scientific discussions about the multiverse and journal articles about it gained prominence.\nAround 2010, scientists such as Stephen M. Feeney analyzed Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) data and claimed to find evidence suggesting that this universe collided with other (parallel) universes in the distant past. However, a more thorough analysis of data from the WMAP and from the Planck satellite, which has a resolution three times higher than WMAP, did not reveal any statistically significant evidence of such a bubble universe collision. In addition, there was no evidence of any gravitational pull of other universes on ours.\nIn 2015, an astrophysicist may have found evidence of alternate or parallel universes by looking back in time to a time immediately after the Big Bang, although it is still a matter of debate among physicists. Dr. Ranga-Ram Chary, after analyzing the cosmic radiation spectrum, found a signal 4,500 times brighter than it should have been, based on the number of protons and electrons scientists believe existed in the very early universe. This signal\u2014an emission line that arose from the formation of atoms during the era of recombination\u2014is more consistent with a universe whose ratio of matter particles to photons is about 65 times greater than our own. There is a 30% chance that this signal is noise, and not really a signal at all; however, it is also possible that it exists because a parallel universe dumped some of its matter particles into our universe. If additional protons and electrons had been added to our universe during recombination, more atoms would have formed, more photons would have been emitted during their formation, and the signature line that arose from all of these emissions would be greatly enhanced. Chary said:&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Many other regions beyond our observable universe would exist with each such region governed by a different set of physical parameters than the ones we have measured for our universe.\u2014\u200a\nChary also noted:&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Unusual claims like evidence for alternate universes require a very high burden of proof.\u2014\u200a\nThe signature that Chary has isolated may be a consequence of incoming light from distant galaxies, or even from clouds of dust surrounding our own galaxy.\nProponents and skeptics.\nModern proponents of one or more of the multiverse hypotheses include Lee Smolin, Don Page, Brian Greene, Max Tegmark, Alan Guth, Andrei Linde, Michio Kaku, David Deutsch, Leonard Susskind, Alexander Vilenkin, Yasunori Nomura, Raj Pathria, Laura Mersini-Houghton, Neil deGrasse Tyson, Sean Carroll and Stephen Hawking.\nScientists who are generally skeptical of the concept of a multiverse or popular multiverse hypotheses include Sabine Hossenfelder, David Gross, Paul Steinhardt, Anna Ijjas, Abraham Loeb, David Spergel, Neil Turok, Viatcheslav Mukhanov, Michael S. Turner, Roger Penrose, George Ellis, Joe Silk, Carlo Rovelli, Adam Frank, Marcelo Gleiser, Jim Baggott and Paul Davies.\nArguments against multiverse hypotheses.\nIn his 2003 \"New York Times\" opinion piece, \"A Brief History of the Multiverse\", author and cosmologist Paul Davies offered a variety of arguments that multiverse hypotheses are non-scientific: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;For a start, how is the existence of the other universes to be tested? To be sure, all cosmologists accept that there are some regions of the universe that lie beyond the reach of our telescopes, but somewhere on the slippery slope between that and the idea that there is an infinite number of universes, credibility reaches a limit. As one slips down that slope, more and more must be accepted on faith, and less and less is open to scientific verification. Extreme multiverse explanations are therefore reminiscent of theological discussions. Indeed, invoking an infinity of unseen universes to explain the unusual features of the one we do see is just as ad hoc as invoking an unseen Creator. The multiverse theory may be dressed up in scientific language, but in essence, it requires the same leap of faith.\u2014\u200a\nGeorge Ellis, writing in August 2011, provided a criticism of the multiverse, and pointed out that it is not a traditional scientific theory. He accepts that the multiverse is thought to exist far beyond the cosmological horizon. He emphasized that it is theorized to be so far away that it is unlikely any evidence will ever be found. Ellis also explained that some theorists do not believe the lack of empirical testability and falsifiability is a major concern, but he is opposed to that line of thinking: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Many physicists who talk about the multiverse, especially advocates of the string landscape, do not care much about parallel universes \"per se\". For them, objections to the multiverse as a concept are unimportant. Their theories live or die based on internal consistency and, one hopes, eventual laboratory testing.\nEllis says that scientists have proposed the idea of the multiverse as a way of explaining the nature of existence. He points out that it ultimately leaves those questions unresolved because it is a metaphysical issue that cannot be resolved by empirical science. He argues that observational testing is at the core of science and should not be abandoned: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;As skeptical as I am, I think the contemplation of the multiverse is an excellent opportunity to reflect on the nature of science and on the ultimate nature of existence: why we are here. ... In looking at this concept, we need an open mind, though not too open. It is a delicate path to tread. Parallel universes may or may not exist; the case is unproved. We are going to have to live with that uncertainty. Nothing is wrong with scientifically based philosophical speculation, which is what multiverse proposals are. But we should name it for what it is.\u2014\u200a\nPhilosopher Philip Goff argues that the inference of a multiverse to explain the apparent fine-tuning of the universe is an example of Inverse Gambler's Fallacy.\nStoeger, Ellis, and Kirchersec. 7 note that in a true multiverse theory, \"the universes are then completely disjoint and nothing that happens in any one of them is causally linked to what happens in any other one. This lack of any causal connection in such multiverses really places them beyond any scientific support\".\nIn May 2020, astrophysicist Ethan Siegel expressed criticism in a Forbes blog post that parallel universes would have to remain a science fiction dream for the time being, based on the scientific evidence available to us.\n\"Scientific American\" contributor John Horgan also argues against the idea of a multiverse, claiming that they are \"bad for science.\"\nTypes.\nMax Tegmark and Brian Greene have devised classification schemes for the various theoretical types of multiverses and universes that they might comprise.\nMax Tegmark's four levels.\nCosmologist Max Tegmark has provided a taxonomy of universes beyond the familiar observable universe. The four levels of Tegmark's classification are arranged such that subsequent levels can be understood to encompass and expand upon previous levels. They are briefly described below.\nLevel I: An extension of our universe.\nA prediction of cosmic inflation is the existence of an infinite ergodic universe, which, being infinite, must contain Hubble volumes realizing all initial conditions.\nAccordingly, an infinite universe will contain an infinite number of Hubble volumes, all having the same physical laws and physical constants. In regard to configurations such as the distribution of matter, almost all will differ from our Hubble volume. However, because there are infinitely many, far beyond the cosmological horizon, there will eventually be Hubble volumes with similar, and even identical, configurations. Tegmark estimates that an identical volume to ours should be about 1010115 meters away from us.\nGiven infinite space, there would be an infinite number of Hubble volumes identical to ours in the universe. This follows directly from the cosmological principle, wherein it is assumed that our Hubble volume is not special or unique.\nLevel II: Universes with different physical constants.\nIn the eternal inflation theory, which is a variant of the cosmic inflation theory, the multiverse or space as a whole is stretching and will continue doing so forever, but some regions of space stop stretching and form distinct bubbles (like gas pockets in a loaf of rising bread). Such bubbles are embryonic level I multiverses.\nDifferent bubbles may experience different spontaneous symmetry breaking, which results in different properties, such as different physical constants.\nLevel II also includes John Archibald Wheeler's oscillatory universe theory and Lee Smolin's fecund universes theory.\nLevel III: Many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics.\nHugh Everett III's many-worlds interpretation (MWI) is one of several mainstream interpretations of quantum mechanics.\nIn brief, one aspect of quantum mechanics is that certain observations cannot be predicted absolutely. Instead, there is a range of possible observations, each with a different probability. According to the MWI, each of these possible observations corresponds to a different \"world\" within the Universal wavefunction, with each world as real as ours. Suppose a six-sided die is thrown and that the result of the throw corresponds to observable quantum mechanics. All six possible ways the die can fall correspond to six different worlds. In the case of the Schr\u00f6dinger's cat thought experiment, both outcomes would be \"real\" in at least one \"world\".\nTegmark argues that a Level III multiverse does not contain more possibilities in the Hubble volume than a Level I or Level II multiverse. In effect, all the different worlds created by \"splits\" in a Level III multiverse with the same physical constants can be found in some Hubble volume in a Level I multiverse. Tegmark writes that, \"The only difference between Level I and Level III is where your doppelg\u00e4ngers reside. In Level I they live elsewhere in good old three-dimensional space. In Level III they live on another quantum branch in infinite-dimensional Hilbert space.\"\nSimilarly, all Level II bubble universes with different physical constants can, in effect, be found as \"worlds\" created by \"splits\" at the moment of spontaneous symmetry breaking in a Level III multiverse. According to Yasunori Nomura, Raphael Bousso, and Leonard Susskind, this is because global spacetime appearing in the (eternally) inflating multiverse is a redundant concept. This implies that the multiverses of Levels I, II, and III are, in fact, the same thing. This hypothesis is referred to as \"Multiverse = Quantum Many Worlds\". According to Yasunori Nomura, this quantum multiverse is static, and time is a simple illusion.\nAnother version of the many-worlds idea is H. Dieter Zeh's \"many-minds\" interpretation.\nLevel IV: Ultimate ensemble.\nThe ultimate mathematical universe hypothesis is Tegmark's own hypothesis.\nThis level considers all universes to be equally real which can be described by different mathematical structures.\nTegmark writes: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Abstract mathematics is so general that any Theory Of Everything (TOE) which is definable in purely formal terms (independent of vague human terminology) is also a mathematical structure. For instance, a TOE involving a set of different types of entities (denoted by words, say) and relations between them (denoted by additional words) is nothing but what mathematicians call a set-theoretical model, and one can generally find a formal system that it is a model of.\nHe argues that this \"implies that any conceivable parallel universe theory can be described at Level IV\" and \"subsumes all other ensembles, therefore brings closure to the hierarchy of multiverses, and there cannot be, say, a Level V.\"\nJ\u00fcrgen Schmidhuber, however, says that the set of mathematical structures is not even well-defined and that it admits only universe representations describable by constructive mathematics\u2014that is, computer programs.\nSchmidhuber explicitly includes universe representations describable by non-halting programs whose output bits converge after a finite time, although the convergence time itself may not be predictable by a halting program, due to the undecidability of the halting problem. He also explicitly discusses the more restricted ensemble of quickly computable universes.\nBrian Greene's nine types.\nThe American theoretical physicist and string theorist Brian Greene discussed nine types of multiverses:\nThe quilted multiverse works only in an infinite universe. With an infinite amount of space, every possible event will occur an infinite number of times. However, the speed of light prevents us from being aware of these other identical areas.\nThe inflationary multiverse is composed of various pockets in which inflation fields collapse and form new universes.\nThe brane multiverse version postulates that our entire universe exists on a membrane (brane) which floats in a higher dimension or \"bulk\". In this bulk, there are other membranes with their own universes. These universes can interact with one another, and when they collide, the violence and energy produced is more than enough to give rise to a Big Bang. The branes float or drift near each other in the bulk, and every few trillion years, attracted by gravity or some other force we do not understand, collide and bang into each other. This repeated contact gives rise to multiple or \"cyclic\" Big Bangs. This particular hypothesis falls under the string theory umbrella as it requires extra spatial dimensions.\nThe cyclic multiverse has multiple branes that have collided, causing Big Bangs. The universes bounce back and pass through time until they are pulled back together and again collide, destroying the old contents and creating them anew.\nThe landscape multiverse relies on string theory's Calabi\u2013Yau spaces. Quantum fluctuations drop the shapes to a lower energy level, creating a pocket with a set of laws different from that of the surrounding space.\nThe quantum multiverse creates a new universe when a diversion in events occurs, as in the real-worlds variant of the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics.\nThe holographic multiverse is derived from the theory that the surface area of a space can encode the contents of the volume of the region.\nThe simulated multiverse exists on complex computer systems that simulate entire universes. A related hypothesis, as put forward as a possibility by astronomer Avi Loeb, is that universes may be creatable in laboratories of advanced technological civilizations who have a theory of everything. Other related hypotheses include brain in a vat-type scenarios where the perceived universe is either simulated in a low-resource way or not perceived directly by the virtual/simulated inhabitant species.\nThe ultimate multiverse contains every mathematically possible universe under different laws of physics.\nTwin-world models.\nThere are models of two related universes that e.g. attempt to explain the baryon asymmetry \u2013 why there was more matter than antimatter at the beginning \u2013 with a mirror anti-universe. One two-universe cosmological model could explain the Hubble constant (H0) tension via interactions between the two worlds. The \"mirror world\" would contain copies of all existing fundamental particles. Another twin/pair-world or \"bi-world\" cosmology is shown to theoretically be able to solve the cosmological constant (\u039b) problem, closely related to dark energy: two interacting worlds with a large \u039b each could result in a small shared effective \u039b.\nCyclic theories.\nIn several theories, there is a series of, in some cases infinite, self-sustaining cycles \u2013 typically a series of Big Crunches (or Big Bounces). However, the respective universes do not exist at once but are forming or following in a logical order or sequence, with key natural constituents potentially varying between universes (see \u00a7 Anthropic principle).\nM-theory.\nA multiverse of a somewhat different kind has been envisaged within string theory and its higher-dimensional extension, M-theory.\nThese theories require the presence of 10 or 11 spacetime dimensions, respectively. The extra six or seven dimensions may either be compactified on a very small scale, or our universe may simply be localized on a dynamical (3+1)-dimensional object, a D3-brane. This opens up the possibility that there are other branes which could support other universes.\nBlack-hole cosmology.\nBlack-hole cosmology is a cosmological model in which the observable universe is the interior of a black hole existing as one of possibly many universes inside a larger universe. This includes the theory of white holes, which are on the opposite side of space-time.\nAnthropic principle.\nThe concept of other universes has been proposed to explain how our own universe appears to be fine-tuned for conscious life as we experience it.\nIf there were a large (possibly infinite) number of universes, each with possibly different physical laws (or different fundamental physical constants), then some of these universes (even if very few) would have the combination of laws and fundamental parameters that are suitable for the development of matter, astronomical structures, elemental diversity, stars, and planets that can exist long enough for life to emerge and evolve.\nThe weak anthropic principle could then be applied to conclude that we (as conscious beings) would only exist in one of those few universes that happened to be finely tuned, permitting the existence of life with developed consciousness. Thus, while the probability might be extremely small that any particular universe would have the requisite conditions for life (as we understand life), those conditions do not require intelligent design as an explanation for the conditions in the Universe that promote our existence in it.\nAn early form of this reasoning is evident in Arthur Schopenhauer's 1844 work \"Von der Nichtigkeit und dem Leiden des Lebens\", where he argues that our world must be the worst of all possible worlds, because if it were significantly worse in any respect it could not continue to exist.\nOccam's razor.\nProponents and critics disagree about how to apply Occam's razor. Critics argue that to postulate an almost infinite number of unobservable universes, just to explain our own universe, is contrary to Occam's razor. However, proponents argue that in terms of Kolmogorov complexity the proposed multiverse is simpler than a single idiosyncratic universe.\nFor example, multiverse proponent Max Tegmark argues: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;[A]n entire ensemble is often much simpler than one of its members. This principle can be stated more formally using the notion of algorithmic information content. The algorithmic information content in a number is, roughly speaking, the length of the shortest computer program that will produce that number as output. For example, consider the set of all integers. Which is simpler, the whole set or just one number? Naively, you might think that a single number is simpler, but the entire set can be generated by quite a trivial computer program, whereas a single number can be hugely long. Therefore, the whole set is actually simpler... (Similarly), the higher-level multiverses are simpler. Going from our universe to the Level I multiverse eliminates the need to specify initial conditions, upgrading to Level II eliminates the need to specify physical constants, and the Level IV multiverse eliminates the need to specify anything at all... A common feature of all four multiverse levels is that the simplest and arguably most elegant theory involves parallel universes by default. To deny the existence of those universes, one needs to complicate the theory by adding experimentally unsupported processes and ad hoc postulates: finite space, wave function collapse and ontological asymmetry. Our judgment therefore comes down to which we find more wasteful and inelegant: many worlds or many words. Perhaps we will gradually get used to the weird ways of our cosmos and find its strangeness to be part of its charm.\u2014\u200a\nPossible worlds and real worlds.\nIn any given set of possible universes \u2013 e.g. in terms of histories or variables of nature \u2013 not all may be ever realized, and some may be realized many times. For example, over infinite time there could, in some potential theories, be infinite universes, but only a small or relatively small real number of universes where humanity could exist and only one where it ever does exist (with a unique history). It has been suggested that a universe that \"contains life, in the form it has on Earth, is in a certain sense radically non-ergodic, in that the vast majority of possible organisms will never be realized\". On the other hand, some scientists, theories and popular works conceive of a multiverse in which the universes are so similar that humanity exists in many equally real separate universes but with varying histories.\nThere is a debate about whether the other worlds are real in the many-worlds interpretation (MWI) of quantum mechanics. In Quantum Darwinism one does not need to adopt a MWI in which all of the branches are equally real.\nModal realism.\nPossible worlds are a way of explaining probability and hypothetical statements. Some philosophers, such as David Lewis, posit that all possible worlds exist and that they are just as real as the world we live in. This position is known as modal realism.\nReferences.\nFootnotes\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "20922", "revid": "29596807", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20922", "title": "Molotov cocktail", "text": "Type of improvised incendiary weapon\nA Molotov cocktail (among several other names \u2013 \"see \") is a hand-thrown incendiary weapon consisting of a frangible container filled with flammable substances and equipped with a fuse (typically a glass bottle filled with flammable liquids sealed with a cloth wick). In use, the fuse attached to the container is lit and the weapon is thrown, shattering on impact. This ignites the flammable substances contained in the bottle and spreads flames as the fuel burns.\nDue to their relative ease of production, Molotov cocktails are typically improvised weapons. Their improvised usage spans criminals, gangsters, rioters, football hooligans, urban guerrillas, terrorists, irregular soldiers, freedom fighters, and even regular soldiers; usage in the latter case is often due to a shortage of equivalent military-issued munitions. Despite the weapon's improvised nature and uncertain quality, many modern militaries exercise the use of Molotov cocktails.\nHowever, Molotov cocktails are not always improvised in the field. It is not uncommon for them to be mass-produced to a certain standard as part of preparation for combat. Some examples of this being done are the anti-invasion preparations of the British Home Guard during World War II and the Ukrainian volunteer units during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. During World War II, Molotov cocktails were even factory produced in several countries, such as Finland, Nazi Germany,&lt;ref name=\"brandhandgranate 48/57\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; the Soviet Union, Sweden, and the United States; some featuring specially designed frangible containers and fuses (such as the US Frangible Grenade M1 for example).\nEtymology.\nThe name \"Molotov cocktail\" () was coined by the Finns during the Winter War in 1939. The name was a pejorative reference to Soviet foreign minister Vyacheslav Molotov, who was one of the architects of the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact on the eve of World War II.\nThe name's origin came from the propaganda Molotov produced during the Winter War, mainly his declaration on Soviet state radio that incendiary bombing missions over Finland were actually \"airborne humanitarian food deliveries\" for their \"starving\" neighbours. As a result, the Finns sarcastically dubbed the Soviet incendiary cluster bombs \"Molotov bread baskets\" () in reference to Molotov's propaganda broadcasts. When the hand-held bottle firebomb was developed to attack and destroy Soviet tanks, the Finns called it the \"Molotov cocktail\", as \"a drink to go with his food parcels\".\nDespite the now infamous name, the formal Finnish military term for the weapon type was, and continues to be, \"burn-bottle\" (, Fenno-Swedish: \"br\u00e4nnflaska\").\nOther names.\nThe weapon most often known as the Molotov cocktail goes under a great variety of other names around the globe. Some are more formal than others but the weapon is often given a descriptive name in the respective language.\nSynonyms and nicknames.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nDesign.\nA Molotov cocktail is a glass bottle containing a flammable substance such as petrol (gasoline), alcohol or a napalm-like mixture and a source of ignition, such as a burning cloth wick, held in place by the bottle's stopper. The wick is usually soaked in alcohol or kerosene rather than petrol. For winter warfare, a method of ignition has been to attach storm matches to the side of the bottle, as these are less likely to be put out by wind. Some examples are fitted with ballast for improved throwing accuracy (such as filling &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u20443 of the bottle with sand).\nIn action, the wick/match is lit and the bottle hurled at a target such as a vehicle or fortification. When the bottle smashes on impact, the ensuing cloud of fuel droplets and vapour is ignited by the attached wick, causing an immediate fireball followed by spreading flames as the remainder of the fuel is consumed.\nOther flammable liquids, such as diesel fuel, methanol, turpentine, jet fuel, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol (rubbing alcohol), have been used in place of, or combined with, petrol. Thickening agents, such as solvents, extruded polystyrene (XPS) foam (known colloquially as styrofoam), baking soda, petroleum jelly, tar, strips of tyre tubing, nitrocellulose, motor oil, rubber cement, detergent and dish soap, have been added to promote adhesion of the burning liquid and to create clouds of thick, choking smoke. There also exist variations on the Molotov cocktail-concept where the bottle is filled with a smoke generating mixture such as sulfur trioxide dissolved in chlorosulfonic acid. These so-called \"smoke bottles\" do not need a source for ignition, as the mixture reacts with the air once the bottle is smashed.\nDevelopment and use in war.\nSpanish Civil War.\nImprovised incendiary devices of this type were used in warfare for the first time in the Spanish Civil War between July 1936 and April 1939, before they became known as \"Molotov cocktails\". In 1936, General Francisco Franco ordered Spanish Nationalist forces to use the weapon against Soviet T-26 tanks supporting the Spanish Republicans in a failed assault on the Nationalist stronghold of Sese\u00f1a, near Toledo, south of Madrid. After that, both sides used simple petrol bombs set fire with toxic gas or petrol-soaked blankets with some success. Tom Wintringham, a veteran of the International Brigades, later publicised his recommended method of using them:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;We made use of \"petrol bombs\" roughly as follows: take a 2lb glass jam jar. Fill with petrol. Take a heavy curtain, half a blanket, or some other heavy material. Wrap this over the mouth of the jar, tie it round the neck with string, leave the ends of the material hanging free. When you want to use it have somebody standing by with a light [i.e., a source of ignition]. Put a corner of the material down in front of you, turn the bottle over so that petrol soaks out round the mouth of the bottle and drips on to this corner of the material. Turn the bottle right way up again, hold it in your right hand, most of the blanket bunched beneath the bottle, with your left hand take the blanket near the corner that is wetted with petrol. Wait for your tank. When near enough, your pal [or comrade-in-arms] lights the petrol soaked corner of the blanket. Throw the bottle and blanket as soon as this corner is flaring. (You cannot throw it far.) See that it drops in front of the tank. The blanket should catch in the tracks or in a cog-wheel, or wind itself round an axle. The bottle will smash, but the petrol should soak the blanket well enough to make a really healthy fire which will burn the rubber wheels on which the tank track runs, set fire to the carburettor or frizzle the crew. Do not play with these things. They are highly dangerous.\nKhalkhin Gol.\nThe Battle of Khalkhin Gol, a border conflict of 1939 ostensibly between Mongolia and Manchukuo, saw heavy fighting between Japanese and Soviet forces. Short of anti-tank equipment, Japanese infantry attacked Soviet tanks with gasoline-filled bottles. Japanese infantrymen claimed that several hundred Soviet tanks had been destroyed this way, though Soviet loss records do not support this assessment.\nWorld War II.\nFinland.\nOn 30 November 1939, the Soviet Union attacked Finland, starting what came to be known as the Winter War. The Finnish perfected the design and tactical use of the petrol bomb. The fuel for the Molotov cocktail was refined to a slightly sticky mixture of alcohol, kerosene, tar, and potassium chlorate. Further refinements included the attachment of wind-proof matches or a phial of chemicals that would ignite on breakage, thereby removing the need to pre-ignite the bottle, and leaving the bottle about one-third empty was found to make breaking more likely.\nA British War Office report dated June 1940 noted that:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The Finns' policy was to allow the Russian tanks to penetrate their defences, even inducing them to do so by 'canalising' them through gaps and concentrating their small arms fire on the infantry following them. The tanks that penetrated were taken on by gun fire in the open and by small parties of men armed with explosive charges and petrol bombs in the forests and villages... The essence of the policy was the separation of the AFVs from the infantry, as once on their own the tank has many blind spots and once brought to a stop can be disposed of at leisure.\nMolotov cocktails were eventually mass-produced by the Alko corporation at its Rajam\u00e4ki distillery, bundled with matches to light them. A bottle was filled with a mixture of petrol and paraffin, plus a small amount of tar. The basic bottle had two long pyrotechnic storm matches attached to either side. Before use, one or both of the matches were lit; when the bottle broke on impact, the mixture ignited. The storm matches were found to be safer to use than a burning rag on the mouth of the bottle. There was also an \"A bottle\". This replaced the matches with a small ampoule inside the bottle; it ignited when the bottle broke. By spring 1940 they had produced 542,104 bottles.\nGreat Britain.\nEarly in 1940, with the prospect of immediate invasion of Great Britain, the possibilities of the petrol bomb gripped the imagination of the British public. For laypersons, the petrol bomb had the benefit of using entirely familiar and available materials, and they were quickly improvised in large numbers, with the intention of using them against enemy tanks.\nThe Finns had found that they were effective when used in the right way and in sufficient numbers. Although the experience of the Spanish Civil War received more publicity, the more sophisticated petroleum warfare tactics of the Finns were not lost on British commanders. In his 5 June address to LDV leaders, General Ironside said:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I want to develop this thing they developed in Finland, called the \"Molotov cocktail\", a bottle filled with resin, petrol and tar which if thrown on top of a tank will ignite, and if you throw half a dozen or more on it you have them cooked. It is quite an effective thing. If you can use your ingenuity, I give you a picture of a [road] block with two houses close to the block, overlooking it. There are many villages like that. Out of the top windows is the place to drop these things on the tank as it passes the block. It may only stop it for two minutes there, but it will be quite effective.\nWintringham advised that a tank that was isolated from supporting infantry was potentially vulnerable to men who had the required determination and cunning to get close. Rifles or even a shotgun would be sufficient to persuade the crew to close all the hatches, and then the view from the tank is very limited; a turret-mounted machine gun has a very slow traverse and cannot hope to fend off attackers coming from all directions. Once sufficiently close, it is possible to hide where the tank's gunner cannot see: \"The most dangerous distance away from a tank is 200 yards; the safest distance is six inches.\" Petrol bombs will soon produce a pall of blinding smoke, and a well-placed explosive package or even a stout iron bar in the tracks can immobilise the vehicle, leaving it at the mercy of further petrol bombs\u00a0\u2013 which will suffocate the engine and possibly the crew\u00a0\u2013 or an explosive charge or anti-tank mine.\nBy August 1940, the War Office produced training instructions for the creation and use of Molotov cocktails. The instructions suggested scoring the bottles vertically with a diamond to ensure breakage and providing fuel-soaked rag, windproof matches or a length of cinema film (then composed of highly flammable nitrocellulose) as a source of ignition.\nOn 29 July 1940, manufacturers Albright &amp; Wilson of Oldbury demonstrated to the RAF how their white phosphorus could be used to ignite incendiary bombs. The demonstration involved throwing glass bottles containing a mixture of petrol and phosphorus at pieces of wood and into a hut. On breaking, the phosphorus was exposed to the air and spontaneously ignited; the petrol also burned, resulting in a fierce fire. Because of safety concerns, the RAF was not interested in white phosphorus as a source of ignition, but the idea of a self-igniting petrol bomb took hold. Initially known as an A.W. bomb, it was officially named the No. 76 Grenade, but more commonly known as the SIP (Self-Igniting Phosphorus) grenade. The perfected list of ingredients was white phosphorus, benzene, water and a two-inch strip of raw rubber; all in a half-pint bottle sealed with a crown stopper. Over time, the rubber would slowly dissolve, making the contents slightly sticky, and the mixture would separate into two layers\u00a0\u2013 this was intentional, and the grenade should not be shaken to mix the layers, as this would only delay ignition. When thrown against a hard surface, the glass would shatter and the contents would instantly ignite, liberating choking fumes of phosphorus pentoxide and sulfur dioxide as well as producing a great deal of heat. Strict instructions were issued to store the grenades safely, preferably underwater and certainly never in a house. Mainly issued to the Home Guard as an anti-tank weapon, it was produced in vast numbers; by August 1941 well over 6,000,000 had been manufactured.\nThere were many who were sceptical about the efficacy of Molotov cocktails and SIP grenades against the more modern German tanks. Weapon designer Stuart Macrae witnessed a trial of the SIP grenades at Farnborough: \"There was some concern that, if the tank drivers could not pull up quickly enough and hop out, they were likely to be frizzled to death, but after looking at the bottles they said they would be happy to take a chance.\" The drivers were proved right, trials on modern British tanks confirmed that Molotov and SIP grenades caused the occupants of the tanks \"no inconvenience whatsoever.\"\nWintringham, though enthusiastic about improvised weapons, cautioned against a reliance on petrol bombs and repeatedly emphasised the importance of using explosive charges.\nUnited States.\nThe U.S. army designated Molotov cocktails as frangible grenades. They presented a notable amount of variations, from those that used thin fuel with varied ignition systems, to those that used obscurants and chemical weapons. Various frangible grenade designs were developed, with those investiged by the NDRC showing the highest technological level. These incendiary devices employed the most technologically advanced fillers in the conflict.\nThe M1 frangible grenade was the standard US device, but each division of the army could come up with its own. Two non-industrial models of these grenades were developed and manufactured in a certain quantity. In all, about five thousand were manufactured. The frangible grenades featured standardized chemical igniters, some were specific to each flammable filler.\nMost of the frangible devices were made in an improvised way, with no standardization regarding the bottle and filling. The frangible grenades were eventually declared obsolete, due to the very limited destructive effect.\n1107 frangible, M1, NP type were supplied to the navy and its units for field use at Iwo Jima. The United States Marine Corps developed a version during World War II that used a tube of nitric acid and a lump of metallic sodium to ignite a mixture of petrol and diesel fuel.\nOther fronts of World War II.\nThe Polish Home Army developed a version which ignited on impact without the need of a wick. Ignition was caused by a reaction between concentrated sulfuric acid mixed with the fuel and a mixture of potassium chlorate and sugar which was crystallized from solution onto a rag attached to the bottle.\nDuring the Norwegian campaign in 1940 the Norwegian Army lacking suitable anti-tank weaponry had to rely on petrol bombs and other improvised weapons to fight German armored vehicles. Instructions from Norwegian High Command sent to army units in April 1940 encouraged soldiers to start ad-hoc production of \"Hitler cocktails\" (a different take on the Finnish nickname for the weapon) to combat tanks and armored cars. During the campaign there were instances of petrol bombs being relatively effective against the lighter tanks employed in Norway by Germany, such as the Panzer I and Panzer II.\nThe first Indochina War and Vietnam War.\nDuring national resistance, the Vietminh made Molotov cocktails to combat French tanks and armored vehicles. In the Vietnam war, during the struggle movement of Saigon students during resistance against America to save the country, a prominent event was the students occupying the Cambodian Embassy to protest against the Lon Nol government's murder of overseas Vietnamese. The defense was well-arranged with all the weapons available and those taken from the field police. They also made hundreds of petrol bombs from easily available materials such as foam and rubber crepe stuffed into coke bottles, sardine bottles filled with petrol..., a terrifying weapon for the field police.\nThe Troubles.\nDuring the Troubles, both the Provisional Irish Republican Army (PIRA) and civilians used petrol bombs, although with different uses. Civilians tended to use petrol bombs and rocks against police officers in riots; however, the PIRA tended to use them in attacks rather than in self-defence. Over time, as the PIRA became more co-ordinated, it shifted to using IEDs rather than petrol bombs.\nModern warfare.\nDuring the Second Battle of Fallujah in 2004, U.S. Marines employed Molotov cocktails made with \"one part liquid laundry detergent, two parts gas [gasoline]\" while clearing houses \"when contact is made in a house and the enemy must be burned out\". The tactic \"was developed in response to the enemy's tactics\" of guerrilla warfare and particularly martyrdom tactics which often resulted in U.S. Marine casualties. The cocktail was a less expedient alternative to white phosphorus mortar rounds or propane tanks detonated with C4 (nicknamed the \"House Guest\"), all of which proved effective at burning out engaged enemy combatants.\nDuring the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Ukrainian Defense Ministry told civilians to make Molotov cocktails, locally called \"Bandera smoothies\", to fight Russian troops. The defense ministry distributed a recipe for producing Molotov cocktails to civilians through Ukrainian television, which included the use of styrofoam as a thickening agent to aid in helping the burning liquid stick to vehicles or other targets. The Pravda Brewery of Lviv, which converted from making beer to Molotov cocktails, said that its recipe was \"3 cups polystyrene, 2 cups grated soap, 500 millilitres gasoline, 100 millilitres oil, 1 jumbo tampon fuse.\" The Russian media control organisation Roskomnadzor sued Twitter for not removing instructions for how to prepare and use molotov cocktails, so that Twitter had to pay a fine of 3 million roubles (US$41,000).\nCivilian use.\nMolotov cocktails were reportedly used in the United States for arson attacks on shops and other buildings during the 1992 Los Angeles riots.\nMolotov cocktails were used by protesters and civilian militia in Ukraine during Euromaidan and the Revolution of Dignity. Protesters during the Ferguson riots also used Molotov cocktails.\nIn Bangladesh, during anti-government protests in 2013 and 2014, many buses and cars were targeted with petrol bombs. A number of people burned to death and many more were injured due to these attacks.\nDuring the 2019\u201320 Hong Kong protests, riots broke out and Molotov cocktails were used to attack the police and create roadblocks. They were also used to attack an MTR station, causing severe damage. A journalist was also struck by a Molotov cocktail during the protests.\nMolotov cocktails were used by some during the riots following the 2020 George Floyd protests in the United States.\nIn 2025, a man in Boulder, Colorado, United States used a Molotov cocktail and an improvised flamethrower to attack a group of peaceful demonstrators calling for the release of Israeli hostages.\nNon-incendiary variants.\nDuring the 2014\u201317 Venezuelan protests, protesters used Molotov cocktails similar to those used by demonstrators in other countries. As the 2017 Venezuelan protests intensified, demonstrators began using \"Puputovs\" (a portmanteau of the words \"poo-poo\" and \"Molotov\"), with glass containers filled with excrement being thrown at authorities after the PSUV ruling-party official, Jacqueline Far\u00eda, mocked protesters who had to crawl through sewage in Caracas' Guaire River to avoid tear gas.\nOn 8 May, the hashtag #puputov became the top trending hashtag on Twitter in Venezuela, as reports of authorities vomiting after being drenched in excrement began to circulate. A month later, on 4 June 2017, during protests against Donald Trump in Portland, Oregon, police claimed protesters began throwing balloons filled with \"unknown, foul-smelling liquid\" at officers.\nLegality.\nAs incendiary devices, Molotov cocktails are illegal to manufacture or possess in many regions.\nIn Canada.\nIn Canada, Molotov cocktails are considered an \"explosive substance\" under the Criminal Code (Canada) and possession is illegal. Under section 82:\n\"Possession of explosive (1) Every person who, without lawful excuse, makes or has in their possession or under their care or control any explosive substance is guilty of (a) an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for a term of not more than five years; or (b) an offence punishable on summary conviction.\"\nIn the United Kingdom.\nIn the United Kingdom, molotov cocktails are considered illegal under the Explosive Substances Act 1883.\nIn the United States.\nIn the United States, Molotov cocktails are considered \"destructive devices\" under the National Firearms Act and are regulated by the ATF. Wil Casey Floyd, from Elkhart Lake, Wisconsin, was arrested after throwing Molotov cocktails at Seattle police officers during a protest in May 2016; he pleaded guilty for using the incendiary devices in February 2018.\nIn Simpson County, Kentucky, 20-year-old Trey Alexander Gwathney-Law attempted to burn Franklin-Simpson County Middle School with five Molotov cocktails; he was found guilty of making and possessing illegal firearms and was sentenced to 20 years in prison in 2018.\nSymbolism.\nDue to the Molotov's ease of production and use by civilian forces, the Molotov cocktail has become a symbol of civil uprising and revolution. The Molotov's extensive use by civilian and partisan forces has also thereby led to the Molotov becoming a symbol representing civil unrest. The contrast of a Molotov cocktail and an organized force has become a popular symbol in popular culture, and is often utilized as a weapon in various video games.\nReferences.\nSpecific.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Matzah can be either soft like a pita or a crisp variety, widely produced commercially because of its long shelf life. The soft matzah only keeps for a day or so unless frozen; very limited commercial production, only in the period leading up to Passover, is available. Some versions of the crisp type are available all year.\nMatzah meal and matzah cake meal is crisp matzah that has been ground. The cake meal has a very fine near flour-like consistency, useful in baking, while the standard matzah meal is somewhat coarser and used in cooking. Matzah meal is used to make matzah balls (kneidles/kneidlach), the principal ingredient of kneydlach soup (often translated as \"matzah ball soup\"). Sephardic Jews typically cook with matzah itself rather than matzah meal.\nMatzah that is kosher for Passover is limited in Ashkenazi tradition to plain matzah made from flour and water. The flour may be made from whole or refined grain, but must be made from one of five grains: wheat, spelt, barley, rye, or oat. Some Sephardic communities allow matzah to be made with eggs or fruit juice to be used throughout the holiday, while Ashkenazi Jews do not use such matzah on Passover, except in special circumstances, as for the sick and elderly.\nBiblical sources.\n\"Matzah\" is mentioned in the Torah several times in relation to The Exodus from Egypt:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;That night, they are to eat the meat, roasted in the fire; they are to eat it with \"matzah\" and \"maror\".\u2014\u200a\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;From the evening of the fourteenth day of the first month until the evening of the twenty-first day, you are to eat \"matzah\".\u2014\u200a\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;You are not to eat any \"chametz\" with it; for seven days you are to eat with it \"matzah\", the bread of affliction; for you came out of the land of Egypt in haste. Thus you will remember the day you left the land of Egypt as long as you live.\u2014\u200a\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;For six days you are to eat \"matzah\"; on the seventh day there is to be a festive assembly for \"Hashem\" your God; do not do any kind of work.\u2014\u200a\nReligious significance.\nThere are numerous explanations behind the symbolism of matzah:\nIngredients.\nAt the Passover seder, simple matzah made of flour and water is mandatory for all. The flour must be ground from one of the five grains specified in Jewish law for Passover matzah: wheat, barley, spelt, rye or oat. Ashkenazic, but not Sephardi, tradition, requires that matzah made with the addition of wine, fruit juice, onion, garlic, etc., may not be used during the Passover festival except by the elderly or unwell.\nNon-Passover matzah is not subject to ritual requirements and may use any kosher ingredients.\nGluten-free preparations.\nPeople who suffer from coeliac disease cannot safely eat cereals containing gluten; the only one of the permitted five grains (wheat, barley, oat, spelt, and rye) without gluten is oat. However, some authorities have expressed doubt about whether oat is truly one of the five grains, or whether it resulted from a historical mistranslation. Some manufacturers produce gluten-free matzah-lookalikes made from potato starch, tapioca, and other non-traditional flour for gluten-intolerant people. However, the Orthodox Union states that, although unleavened gluten-free products may be eaten on Passover, they do not fulfill the commandment (\"mitzvah\") of eating matzah at the Seder, because matzah must be made from one of the five grains.\nWhile oat is considered to be one of the five grains and does not itself contain gluten, matzah made from it would be gluten-free only if there were no contamination by gluten-containing grains. From 2013 some matzah manufacturers have produced gluten-free oat matzah certified kosher for Passover. Given the doubts about oats truly being one of the five grains, it has been suggested that matzah could be made from a mixture of 90% rice flour and 10% wheat flour (as rice is deemed so bland that the taste of wheat flour dominates, and thus meets ritual requirements), for those who can handle eating the small amount of wheat in this mixture. For those who can eat no wheat, eating oat matzah at the Seder is still considered the best option.\nPreparation.\nMatzah dough is quickly mixed and rolled out without an autolyse step as used for leavened breads. Most forms are pricked with a fork or a similar tool to keep the finished product from puffing up, and the resulting flat piece of dough is cooked at high temperature until it develops dark spots, then set aside to cool and, if sufficiently thin, to harden to crispness. Dough is considered to begin the leavening process 18 minutes from the time it gets wet; sooner if eggs, fruit juice, or milk is added to the dough. The entire process of making matzah takes only a few minutes in efficient modern matzah bakeries.\nAfter baking, matzah may be ground into fine, or slightly coarser, crumbs, known as matzah meal, that can be used like flour during the week of Passover when flour can otherwise be used only to make matzah.\nVariations.\nThere are two major forms of matzah. Prior to the late 18th century, all matzah was soft and relatively thick, but thinner, crisper matzah later became popular in parts of Europe due to its longer shelf life. With the invention of the first matzah-making machine in France in 1839, cracker-like mass-produced matzah became the most common form in Europe and North America and is now ubiquitous in all Ashkenazic and most Sephardic communities. Yemenite and Iraqi Jews continue to use a form of soft matzah which looks like Greek pita or like a tortilla. Soft matzah is made only by hand, and generally with \"shmurah\" flour.\nFlavored varieties of matzah are produced commercially, such as poppy seed- or onion-flavored. Oat and spelt matzah with kosher certification are produced. Oat matzah is generally suitable for those who cannot eat gluten. Whole wheat, bran and organic matzah are also available. Chocolate-covered matzah is a favorite among children, although some consider it \"enriched matzah\" and will not eat it during the Passover holiday. A quite different flat confection of chocolate and nuts that resembles matzah is sometimes called \"chocolate matzah\".\nMass-produced matzah contains typically 111 calories per 1-ounce/28g (USDA Nutrient Database), about the same as rye crispbread.\nShmurah matzah.\n\"Sh\u0115mura\" (\"guarded\") matzah ( \"matsa sh\u0115mura\") is made from grain that has been under special supervision from the time it was harvested to ensure that no fermentation has occurred, and that it is suitable for eating on the first night of Passover. (\"Sh\u0115mura\" wheat may be formed into either handmade or machine-made matzah, while non-\"sh\u0115mura\" wheat is only used for machine-made matzah. It is possible to hand-bake matzah in \"sh\u0115mura\" style from non-shmurah flour\u2014this is a matter of style, it is not actually in any way \"sh\u0115mura\"\u2014but such matzah has rarely been produced since the introduction of machine-made matzah.)\nHaredi Judaism is scrupulous about the supervision of matzah and have the custom of baking their own or at least participating in some stage of the baking process. Rabbi Chaim Halberstam of Sanz ruled in the 19th century that machine-made matzah were chametz. According to that opinion, handmade non-\"shmurah\" matzah may be used on the eighth day of Passover outside of the Holy Land. However the non-Hasidic Haredi community of Jerusalem follows the custom that machine-made matzah may be used, with preference to the use of \"sh\u0115murah\" flour, in accordance with the ruling of Rabbi Yosef Chaim Sonnenfeld, who ruled that machine-made matzah may be preferable to hand made in some cases. The commentators to the Shulhan `Aruch record that it is the custom of some of Diaspora Jewry to be scrupulous in giving Hallah from the dough used for baking \"Matzat Mitzvah\" (the sh\u0115murah matzah eaten during Passover) to a Kohen child to eat.\nEgg matzah.\nThe requirement for eating Matzah at the Seder cannot be fulfilled with \"[egg] matza.\" \n\"Egg (sometimes \"enriched\") matzah\" are matzot usually made with fruit juice, often grape juice or apple juice, instead of water, but not necessarily with eggs themselves. There is a custom among some Ashkenazi Jews not to eat them during Passover, except for the elderly, infirm, or children, who cannot digest plain matzah; these matzot are considered to be kosher for Passover if prepared otherwise properly. The issue of whether egg matzah is allowed for Passover comes down to whether there is a difference between the various liquids that can be used. Water facilitates a fermentation of grain flour specifically into what is defined as chametz, but the question is whether fruit juice, eggs, honey, oil or milk are also deemed to do so within the strict definitions of Jewish laws regarding chametz.\nThe \"Talmud\", Pesachim 35a, states that liquid food extracts do not cause flour to leaven the way that water does. According to this view, flour mixed with other liquids would not need to be treated with the same care as flour mixed with water. The \"Tosafot\" (commentaries) explain that such liquids only produce a leavening reaction within flour \"if\" they themselves have had water added to them and otherwise the dough they produce is completely permissible for consumption during Passover, whether or not made according to the laws applying to matzot.\nAs a result, Joseph ben Ephraim Karo, author of the \"Shulchan Aruch\" or \"Code of Jewish Law\" (Orach Chayim 462:4) granted blanket permission for the use of any matzah made from non-water-based dough, including egg matzah, on Passover. Many egg matzah boxes no longer include the message, \"Ashkenazi custom is that egg matzah is only allowed for children, elderly and the infirm during Passover.\" Even amongst those who consider that enriched matzot may not be \"eaten\" during Passover, it is permissible to \"retain\" it in the home.\nChocolate-covered matzah.\nChocolate-covered matzah was sold in boxes as a standard product, alongside boxes of egg matzah.\nThe matzah itself is not \"Hamotzi\" (meaning that it is \"Mezonot\").\nCooking with matzah.\nMatzah may be used whole, broken, chopped (\"matzah farfel\"), or finely ground (\"matzah meal\"); to make numerous matzah-based cooked dishes. These include matzah balls, which are traditionally served in chicken soup; matzah brei, a dish of Ashkenazi origin made from matzah soaked in water, mixed with beaten egg, and fried; helzel, poultry neck skin stuffed with matzah meal; matzah pizza, in which the piece of matzah takes the place of pizza crust and is topped with melted cheese and sauce; and kosher for Passover cakes and cookies, which are made with matzah meal or a finer variety called \"cake meal\" that gives them a denser texture than ordinary baked foods made with flour. Hasidic Jews do not cook with matzah, believing that mixing it with water may allow leavening; this stringency is known as \"gebrochts\". However, Jews who avoid eating \"gebrochts\" will eat cooked matzah dishes on the eighth day of Passover outside the Land of Israel, as the eighth day is of rabbinic and not Torah origin. Matzah meal or \"gebrokts\" in Yiddish meaning \"broken pieces\" is accepted in some communities but not others.\nSephardim use matzah soaked in water or stock to make pies or lasagne, known as \"mina\", \"m\u00e9guena\", \"mayena\" or .\nIn Christianity.\nCommunion wafers used by the Roman Catholic Church as well as in some Protestant traditions for the Eucharist are flat, unleavened bread. The main reason for the use of this bread is the belief that, because the Last Supper was described in the Synoptic Gospels as a Passover meal, the unleavened matzah bread was used by Jesus when he held it up and said \"this is my body\". All Byzantine Rite churches use leavened bread for the Eucharist as this symbolizes the risen Christ.\nSome Oriental Orthodox and Eastern Catholic Christians use leavened bread, as in the east there is the tradition, based upon the gospel of John, that leavened bread was on the table of the Last Supper. In the Armenian Apostolic Church, the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church and Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church, unleavened bread called \"q\u01ddddus qurban\" in Ge'ez, the liturgical language of the Eritreans and Ethiopians, is used for communion.\nSaint Thomas Christians living on the Malabar coast of Kerala, India have the customary celebration of Pesaha in their homes. On the evening before Good Friday, Pesaha bread is made at home. It is made with unleavened flour and they consume a sweet drink made up of coconut milk and jaggery along with this bread. On the Pesaha night, the bread is baked (steamed) immediately after rice flour is mixed with water and they pierce it many times with handle of the spoon to let out steam so that the bread will not rise (this custom is called \"juthante kannu kuthal\" in the Malayalam language meaning \"piercing the bread according to the custom of Jews\"). This bread is cut by the head of the family and shared among the family members.\nWorld War II.\nAt the end of World War II, the National Jewish Welfare Board had a matzah factory (according to the American Jewish Historical Society, it was probably the Manischewitz matzah factory in New Jersey) produce matzah in the shape of a large \"V\" for \"Victory\", for use in the U.S. and military bases overseas by Jewish military personnel for Passover seders.\nIn film.\n\"Streit's\" is the story of the last family-owned matzah bakery in America during their final year at their historic New York City factory.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Tremblay's first professionally produced play, \"Les Belles-S\u0153urs\", was written in 1965 and premiered at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Rideau Vert on August 28, 1968. It transformed the old guard of Canadian theatre and introduced joual to the mainstream. It stirred up controversy by portraying the lives of working-class women and attacking the strait-laced, deeply religious society of mid-20th century Quebec.\nCareer and impact.\nTremblay's early plays, including \"Hosanna\" and \"La Duchesse de Langeais\", challenged the boundaries of French Canadian society. Until the Quiet Revolution of the early 1960s, Tremblay saw Quebec as a poor, working-class province dominated by an English-speaking elite and the Roman Catholic Church. Tremblay's work was part of a vanguard of liberal, nationalist thought that helped create an essentially modern society. His most famous plays are usually centred on gay characters. The first Canadian play about and starring a drag queen was his play \"Hosanna\", which was first performed at Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de Quat'Sous in Montreal in 1973.\nThe women in his plays are usually strong but possessed with demons they must vanquish. It is said he sees Quebec as a matriarchal society. He is considered one of the best playwrights for women. In the late 1980s, \"Les Belles-s\u0153urs\" (\"The Sisters-in-Law\") was produced in Scotland in Scots, as \"The Guid-Sisters\" (\"guid-sister\" being Scots for \"sister-in-law\"). His work has been translated into many languages, including Yiddish, and including such works as \"Sainte-Carmen de la Main\", \"\u00c7'ta ton tour, Laura Cadieux\", and \"Forever Yours, Marilou\" (\"\u00c0 toi pour toujours, ta Marie-Lou\").\nHe has been openly gay throughout his public life, and he has written many novels (\"The Duchess and the Commoner\", \"La nuit des princes charmants\", \"Le Coeur d\u00e9couvert\", \"Le Coeur \u00e9clat\u00e9\") and plays (\"Hosanna\", \"La duchesse de Langeais\", \"Fragments de mensonges inutiles\") centred on gay characters. In a 1987 interview with Shelagh Rogers for CBC Radio's \"The Arts Tonight\", he remarked that he has always avoided behaviours he has considered masculine; for example, he does not smoke and he noted that he was 45 years old and did not know how to drive a car. \"I think I am a rare breed,\" he said, \"A homosexual who doesn't like men.\" He claims one of his biggest regrets in life was not telling his mother that he was gay before she died.\nHis latest play to receive wide acclaim is \"For the Pleasure of Seeing Her Again\", a comedic and nostalgic play, centred on the memories of his mother. He later published the Plateau Mont-Royal Chronicles, a cycle of six novels including \"The Fat Woman Next Door is Pregnant\" (\"La grosse femme d'\u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 est enceinte\", 1978) and \"The Duchess and the Commoner\" (\"La duchesse et le roturier\", 1982). The second novel of this series, \"Therese and Pierrette and the Little Hanging Angel\" (\"Th\u00e9r\u00e8se et Pierrette \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole des Saints-Anges\", 1980), was one of the novels chosen for inclusion in the French version of \"Canada Reads\", \"Le combat des livres\", broadcast on Radio-Canada in 2005, where it was championed by union activist Monique Simard.\nTremblay also worked on a television series entitled \"Le C\u0153ur d\u00e9couvert\" (\"The Heart Laid Bare\"), about the lives of a gay couple in Quebec, for the French-language TV network Radio-Canada. In 2005 he completed another novel cycle, the \"Cahiers\" (\"Le Cahier noir\" (translated as \"The Black Notebook\"), \"Le Cahier rouge\", \"Le Cahier bleu\"), dealing with the changes that occurred in 1960s Montreal during the Quiet Revolution. In 2009 \"The Fat Woman Next Door\" was a finalist in CBC's prestigious Canada Reads competition.\nPolitical views.\nFor many years, Tremblay has believed that the only reasonable solution for Quebec is to separate from Canada. Once the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois was elected in Quebec, he softened his views on allowing his plays to be produced in English there. He made it clear, however, that that did not mean that he agreed with bilingualism, calling it \"stupid\" and stating that he thought it ridiculous to expect a housewife in Vancouver to be fluent in both English and French.\nDespite his often outspoken views in public, Tremblay's treatment of politics in his plays is subtle. Speaking of politics and the theatre in an CBC interview in 1978, Tremblay said:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIn April 2006 he declared that he did not support the arguments put forward for the separation of Quebec. But he clarified his thoughts some time later by saying he was still a supporter of Quebec sovereignty, though critical of the actual state of the debate, which in his opinion was too much focused on economic issues. In response to this, the columnist Marc Cassivi of \"La Presse\" wrote that \"there was only one closet a Quebec artist could never exit and that was the federalist one.\"\nAwards and honours.\nTremblay has received numerous awards in recognition of his work. These include the \"Prix Victor-Morin\" (1974), the \"Prix France-Qu\u00e9bec\" (1984), the Chalmers Award (1986) and the Molson Prize (1994).\nHe received the Lieutenant-Governor's award for Ontario in 1976 and 1977. Tremblay was named the \"Montr\u00e9alais le plus remarquable des deux derni\u00e8res d\u00e9cennies dans le domaine du th\u00e9\u00e2tre\" (the most remarkable Montrealer of the past two decades in theatre) (1978). In 1991 he was appointed \"Officier de l'Ordre de France,\" and in the same year, \"Chevalier de l'Ordre National du Qu\u00e9bec.\" He is also a recipient of the \"Chevalier de l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres de France\" (1994).\nIn 1999, Tremblay received a Governor General's Performing Arts Award, Canada's highest honour in the performing arts. This produced controversy when several well-known Quebec nationalists suggested that he should refuse the award. While he did not do this, he did admit, for the first time, that he had refused the Order of Canada in 1990.\nIn 2000, \"Encore une fois, si vous le permettez\" (\"For The Pleasure of Seeing Her Again\") won a Chalmers Award and a Dora Mavor Moore Award.\nIn 2003 he was awarded an honorary degree for his contributions to theatre and playwrighting by Queen Margaret University in a ceremony at the Edinburgh Festival Theatre in Scotland.\nIn 2024, a plaza-playground in the Plateau-Mont-Royal was named Place de l'Ange-Cornu in honour of Tremblay's book \"Un ange cornu avec des ailes de t\u00f4le\".\nWorks.\nNovels and short story collections.\nNote: Most titles also available in English translations\n\"La grosse femme d'\u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 est enceinte\" (1978) (\"The Fat Woman Next Door is Pregnant\")\n\"Therese and Pierrette and the Little Hanging Angel|Th\u00e9r\u00e8se et Pierrette \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole des Saints-Anges\" (1980) (\"Therese and Pierrette and the Little Hanging Angel\")\n\"La Duchesse et le roturier\" (1982) (\"The Duchess and the Commoner\")\n\"Des nouvelles d'\u00c9douard\" (1984) (\"News from \u00c9douard\")\n\"Le Premier Quartier de la lune\" (1989) (\"The First Quarter of the Moon\")\n\"Un objet de beaut\u00e9\" (1997) (\"A Thing of Beauty\")\n\"Le Cahier noir\" (2003) (\"The Black Notebook\")\n\"Le Cahier rouge\" (2004) (\"The Red Notebook\")\n\"Le Cahier bleu (Tremblay)|Le Cahier bleu\" (2005) (\"The Blue Notebook\")\nPlays.\nNote: Most titles also available in English translations\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "20926", "revid": "1319341948", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20926", "title": "Supervised learning", "text": "Machine learning paradigm\nIn machine learning, supervised learning (SL) is a type of machine learning paradigm where an algorithm learns to map input data to a specific output based on example input-output pairs. This process involves training a statistical model using labeled data, meaning each piece of input data is provided with the correct output. For instance, if you want a model to identify cats in images, supervised learning would involve feeding it many images of cats (inputs) that are explicitly labeled \"cat\" (outputs).\nThe goal of supervised learning is for the trained model to accurately predict the output for new, unseen data. This requires the algorithm to effectively generalize from the training examples, a quality measured by its \"generalization error\". Supervised learning is commonly used for tasks like classification (predicting a category, e.g., spam or not spam) and regression (predicting a continuous value, e.g., house prices).\nSteps to follow.\nTo solve a given problem of supervised learning, the following steps must be performed:\nAlgorithm choice.\nA wide range of supervised learning algorithms are available, each with its strengths and weaknesses. There is no single learning algorithm that works best on all supervised learning problems (see the No free lunch theorem).\nThere are four major issues to consider in supervised learning:\nBias\u2013variance tradeoff.\nA first issue is the tradeoff between \"bias\" and \"variance\". Imagine that we have available several different, but equally good, training data sets. A learning algorithm is biased for a particular input formula_1 if, when trained on each of these data sets, it is systematically incorrect when predicting the correct output for formula_1. A learning algorithm has high variance for a particular input formula_1 if it predicts different output values when trained on different training sets. The prediction error of a learned classifier is related to the sum of the bias and the variance of the learning algorithm. Generally, there is a tradeoff between bias and variance. A learning algorithm with low bias must be \"flexible\" so that it can fit the data well. But if the learning algorithm is too flexible, it will fit each training data set differently, and hence have high variance. A key aspect of many supervised learning methods is that they are able to adjust this tradeoff between bias and variance (either automatically or by providing a bias/variance parameter that the user can adjust).\nFunction complexity and amount of training data.\nThe second issue is of the amount of training data available relative to the complexity of the \"true\" function (classifier or regression function). If the true function is simple, then an \"inflexible\" learning algorithm with high bias and low variance will be able to learn it from a small amount of data. But if the true function is highly complex (e.g., because it involves complex interactions among many different input features and behaves differently in different parts of the input space), then the function will only be able to learn with a large amount of training data paired with a \"flexible\" learning algorithm with low bias and high variance.\nDimensionality of the input space.\nA third issue is the dimensionality of the input space. If the input feature vectors have large dimensions, learning the function can be difficult even if the true function only depends on a small number of those features. This is because the many \"extra\" dimensions can confuse the learning algorithm and cause it to have high variance. Hence, input data of large dimensions typically requires tuning the classifier to have low variance and high bias. In practice, if the engineer can manually remove irrelevant features from the input data, it will likely improve the accuracy of the learned function. In addition, there are many algorithms for feature selection that seek to identify the relevant features and discard the irrelevant ones. This is an instance of the more general strategy of dimensionality reduction, which seeks to map the input data into a lower-dimensional space prior to running the supervised learning algorithm.\nNoise in the output values.\nA fourth issue is the degree of noise in the desired output values (the supervisory target variables). If the desired output values are often incorrect (because of human error or sensor errors), then the learning algorithm should not attempt to find a function that exactly matches the training examples. Attempting to fit the data too carefully leads to overfitting. You can overfit even when there are no measurement errors (stochastic noise) if the function you are trying to learn is too complex for your learning model. In such a situation, the part of the target function that cannot be modeled \"corrupts\" your training data \u2013 this phenomenon has been called deterministic noise. When either type of noise is present, it is better to go with a higher bias, lower variance estimator.\nIn practice, there are several approaches to alleviate noise in the output values such as early stopping to prevent overfitting as well as detecting and removing the noisy training examples prior to training the supervised learning algorithm. There are several algorithms that identify noisy training examples and removing the suspected noisy training examples prior to training has decreased generalization error with statistical significance.\nOther factors to consider.\nOther factors to consider when choosing and applying a learning algorithm include the following:\nWhen considering a new application, the engineer can compare multiple learning algorithms and experimentally determine which one works best on the problem at hand (see cross-validation). Tuning the performance of a learning algorithm can be very time-consuming. Given fixed resources, it is often better to spend more time collecting additional training data and more informative features than it is to spend extra time tuning the learning algorithms.\nAlgorithms.\nThe most widely used learning algorithms are: \nHow supervised learning algorithms work.\nGiven a set of formula_4 training examples of the form formula_5 such that formula_6 is the feature vector of the formula_7-th example and formula_8 is its label (i.e., class), a learning algorithm seeks a function formula_9, where formula_10 is the input space and formula_11 is the output space. The function formula_12 is an element of some space of possible functions formula_13, usually called the \"hypothesis space\". It is sometimes convenient to represent formula_12 using a scoring function formula_15 such that formula_12 is defined as returning the formula_17 value that gives the highest score: formula_18. Let formula_19 denote the space of scoring functions.\nAlthough formula_13 and formula_19 can be any space of functions, many learning algorithms are probabilistic models where formula_12 takes the form of a conditional probability model formula_23, or formula_24 takes the form of a joint probability model formula_25. For example, naive Bayes and linear discriminant analysis are joint probability models, whereas logistic regression is a conditional probability model.\nThere are two basic approaches to choosing formula_24 or formula_12: empirical risk minimization and structural risk minimization. Empirical risk minimization seeks the function that best fits the training data. Structural risk minimization includes a \"penalty function\" that controls the bias/variance tradeoff.\nIn both cases, it is assumed that the training set consists of a sample of independent and identically distributed pairs, formula_28. In order to measure how well a function fits the training data, a loss function formula_29 is defined. For training example formula_30, the loss of predicting the value formula_31 is formula_32.\nThe \"risk\" formula_33 of function formula_12 is defined as the expected loss of formula_12. This can be estimated from the training data as\nformula_36.\nEmpirical risk minimization.\nIn empirical risk minimization, the supervised learning algorithm seeks the function formula_12 that minimizes formula_33. Hence, a supervised learning algorithm can be constructed by applying an optimization algorithm to find formula_12.\nWhen formula_12 is a conditional probability distribution formula_41 and the loss function is the negative log likelihood: formula_42, then empirical risk minimization is equivalent to maximum likelihood estimation.\nWhen formula_13 contains many candidate functions or the training set is not sufficiently large, empirical risk minimization leads to high variance and poor generalization. The learning algorithm is able to memorize the training examples without generalizing well (overfitting).\nStructural risk minimization.\nStructural risk minimization seeks to prevent overfitting by incorporating a regularization penalty into the optimization. The regularization penalty can be viewed as implementing a form of Occam's razor that prefers simpler functions over more complex ones.\nA wide variety of penalties have been employed that correspond to different definitions of complexity. For example, consider the case where the function formula_12 is a linear function of the form\nformula_45.\nA popular regularization penalty is formula_46, which is the squared Euclidean norm of the weights, also known as the formula_47 norm. Other norms include the formula_48 norm, formula_49, and the formula_50 \"norm\", which is the number of non-zero formula_51s. The penalty will be denoted by formula_52.\nThe supervised learning optimization problem is to find the function formula_12 that minimizes\nformula_54\nThe parameter formula_55 controls the bias-variance tradeoff. When formula_56, this gives empirical risk minimization with low bias and high variance. When formula_55 is large, the learning algorithm will have high bias and low variance. The value of formula_55 can be chosen empirically via cross-validation.\nThe complexity penalty has a Bayesian interpretation as the negative log prior probability of formula_12, formula_60, in which case formula_61 is the posterior probability of formula_12.\nGenerative training.\nThe training methods described above are \"discriminative training\" methods, because they seek to find a function formula_12 that discriminates well between the different output values (see discriminative model). For the special case where formula_25 is a joint probability distribution and the loss function is the negative log likelihood formula_65 a risk minimization algorithm is said to perform \"generative training\", because formula_24 can be regarded as a generative model that explains how the data were generated. Generative training algorithms are often simpler and more computationally efficient than discriminative training algorithms. In some cases, the solution can be computed in closed form as in naive Bayes and linear discriminant analysis.\nGeneralizations.\nThere are several ways in which the standard supervised learning problem can be generalized:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In 1552, he became Rector of St. Maria Magdalena School in Breslau (now Wroc\u0142aw, in Poland).

Some applications, such as Microsoft Office, Excel, PowerPoint allow macro programs to be embedded in documents such that the macros are run automatically when the document is opened, and this provides a distinct mechanism by which malicious computer instructions can spread. This is one reason it can be dangerous to open unexpected attachments in e-mails. Many antivirus programs can detect macro viruses; however, the macro virus' behavior can still be difficult to detect.\nFundamentals.\nA macro is a series of commands and actions that helps automating some tasks - usually a quite short and simple program. However they are created, they need to be executed by some system which interprets the stored commands. Some macro systems are self-contained programs, but others are built into complex applications (for example word processors) to allow users to repeat sequences of commands easily, or to allow developers to tailor the application to local needs.\nOperation.\nA macro virus can be spread through e-mail attachments, removable media, networks and the Internet, and is notoriously difficult to detect. A common way for a macro virus to infect a computer is by replacing normal macros with a virus. The macro virus replaces regular commands with the same name and runs when the command is selected. These malicious macros may start automatically when a document is opened or closed, without the user's knowledge.\nOnce a file containing a macro virus is opened, the virus can infect the system. When triggered, it will begin to embed itself in other documents and templates. It may corrupt other parts of the system, depending on what resources a macro in this application can access. When the infected documents are shared with other users and systems, the virus spreads. Macro viruses have been used as a method of installing software on a system without the user's consent, as they can be used to download and install software from the internet through the use of automated key-presses. However, this is uncommon as it is usually not fruitful for the virus coder since the installed software is usually noticed and uninstalled by the user.\nSince a macro virus depends on the application rather than the operating system, it can infect a computer running any operating system to which the targeted application has been ported. In particular, since Microsoft Word is available on Macintosh computers, word macro viruses can attack some Macs in addition to Windows platforms.\nAn example of a macro virus is the Melissa virus which appeared in March 1999. When a user opens a Microsoft Word document containing the Melissa virus, their computer becomes infected. The virus then sends itself by email to the first 50 people in the person's address book. This made the virus replicate at a fast rate.\nNot all macro viruses are detected by antivirus software. Caution when opening email attachments and other documents decreases the chance of becoming infected.\nDue to the prevalence of macro viruses, starting with Microsoft Office 2007, Microsoft assigned a separate set of file extensions ending in \"m\" to Office files containing macros in order to prevent users from opening macro virus-infected files that were not intended to contain macros in the first place.\nCurrent versions of Microsoft Office block macros by default in files originating from the internet, a change that first appeared in April 2022.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is part of the Microsoft 365 suite of applications, included in the Professional and higher editions or sold separately.\nMicrosoft Access stores data in its own format based on the Access Database Engine (formerly Jet Database Engine). It can also import or link directly to data stored in other applications and databases.\nSoftware developers, data architects and power users can use Microsoft Access to develop application software. Like other Microsoft Office applications, Access is supported by Visual Basic for Applications (VBA), an object-based programming language that can reference a variety of objects including the legacy DAO (Data Access Objects), ActiveX Data Objects, and many other ActiveX components. Visual objects used in forms and reports expose their methods and properties in the VBA programming environment, and VBA code modules may declare and call Windows operating system operations.\nHistory.\nIn the 1980s, Microsoft Access referred to an unrelated telecommunication program that provided terminal emulation and interfaces for ease of use in accessing online services such as Dow Jones, CompuServe and electronic mailbox.\nWith the popularization of personal computing at home and in the workplace, in the 1990s desktop databases became commonplace. Prior to the introduction of Access, Borland (with Paradox), Ashton-Tate (with dBase, acquired by Borland in 1991) and Fox (with FoxPro) dominated the desktop database market. Microsoft Access was the first mass-market database program for Windows. With Microsoft's purchase of FoxPro in 1992 and the incorporation of Fox's Rushmore query optimization routines into Access, Microsoft Access quickly became the dominant database for Windows\u2014effectively eliminating the competition which failed to transition from the MS-DOS world.\nProject Omega.\nMicrosoft's first attempt to sell a relational database product was during the mid-1980s, when Microsoft obtained the license to sell . In the late 1980s Microsoft developed its own solution codenamed Omega. It was confirmed in 1988 that a database product for Windows and OS/2 was in development. It was going to include the \"EB\" Embedded Basic language, which was going to be the language for writing macros in all Microsoft applications, but the unification of macro languages did not happen until the introduction of Visual Basic for Applications (VBA). Omega was also expected to provide a front end to the Microsoft SQL Server. The application was very resource-intensive, and there were reports that it was working slowly on the 386 processors that were available at the time. It was scheduled to be released in the 1st quarter of 1990, but in 1989 the development of the product was reset and it was rescheduled to be delivered no sooner than in January 1991. Parts of the project were later used for other Microsoft projects: Cirrus (codename for Access) and Thunder (codename for Visual Basic, where the Embedded Basic engine was used). After Access's premiere, the Omega project was demonstrated in 1992 to several journalists and included features that were not available in Access.\nProject Cirrus.\nAfter the Omega project was scrapped, some of its developers were assigned to the Cirrus project (most were assigned to the team which created Visual Basic). Its goal was to create a competitor for applications like Paradox or dBase that would work on Windows. After Microsoft acquired FoxPro, there were rumors that the Microsoft project might get replaced with it, but the company decided to develop them in parallel. It was assumed that the project would make use of Extensible Storage Engine (Jet Blue) but, in the end, only support for Jet Database Engine (Jet Red) was provided. The project used some of the code from both the Omega project and a pre-release version of Visual Basic. In July 1992, betas of Cirrus shipped to developers and the name Access became the official name of the product. \"Access\" was originally used for an older terminal emulation program from Microsoft. Years after the program was abandoned, they decided to reuse the name here.\nTimeline.\nMicrosoft released Access version 1.0 on November 16, 1992, announcing its immediate availability at the fall Comdex trade show, and an Access 1.1 release in May 1993 to improve compatibility with other Microsoft products and to include the Access Basic programming language.\nWith Access v2.0, Microsoft specified the minimum hardware requirements to be Microsoft Windows v3.1 with 4\u00a0MB of RAM required, 6\u00a0MB RAM recommended; 8\u00a0MB of available hard disk space required, 14\u00a0MB hard disk space recommended. The product shipped on seven 1.44\u00a0MB diskettes. The manual shows a 1994 copyright date.\nAs a part of the Microsoft Office 4.3 Professional with Book Shelf, Microsoft Access 2.0 was included with first sample databases \"NorthWind Trader\" which covered every possible aspect of programming a database. The Northwind Traders sample first introduced the Main Switchboard features new to Access 2.0 for 1994.\nWith Office 95, Microsoft Access 7.0 (a.k.a. \"Access 95\") became part of the Microsoft Office Professional Suite, joining Microsoft Excel, Word, and PowerPoint and transitioning from Access Basic to VBA. Since then, Microsoft has released new versions of Microsoft Access with each release of Microsoft Office.\nVersions 3.0 and 3.5 of Jet Database Engine (used by Access 7.0 and the later-released Access 97, respectively) had a critical issue which made these versions of Access unusable on a computer with more than 1\u00a0GB of memory. While Microsoft fixed this problem for Jet 3.5/Access 97 post-release, it never fixed the issue with Jet 3.0/Access 95.\nThe native Access database format (the Jet MDB Database) has also evolved over the years. Formats include Access 1.0, 1.1, 2.0, 7.0, 97, 2000, 2002, and 2007. The most significant transition was from the Access 97 to the Access 2000 format; which is not backward compatible with earlier versions of Access. As of 2011,[ [update]] all newer versions of Access support the Access 2000 format. New features were added to the Access 2002 format which can be used by Access 2002, 2003, 2007, and 2010.\nMicrosoft Access 2000 increased the maximum database size to 2\u00a0GB from 1\u00a0GB in Access 97.\nMicrosoft Access 2007 introduced a new database format: ACCDB. It supports links to SharePoint lists and complex data types such as multi-value and attachment fields. These new field types are essentially recordsets in fields and allow the storage of multiple values or files in one field. Microsoft Access 2007 also introduced File Attachment field, which stored data more efficiently than the OLE (Object Linking and Embedding) field.\nMicrosoft Access 2010 introduced a new version of the ACCDB format supported hosting Access Web services on a SharePoint 2010 server. For the first time, this allowed Access applications to be run without having to install Access on a user's PC and was the first support for Mac users. Any user on the SharePoint site with sufficient rights could use the Access Web service. A copy of Access was still required for the developer to create the Access Web service, and the desktop version of Access remained part of Access 2010. The Access Web services were not the same as the desktop applications. Automation was only through the macro language (not VBA) which Access automatically converted to JavaScript. The data was no longer in an Access database but SharePoint lists. An Access desktop database could link to the SharePoint data, so hybrid applications were possible so that SharePoint users needing basic views and edits could be supported while the more sophisticated, traditional applications could remain in the desktop Access database.\nMicrosoft Access 2013 offers traditional Access desktop applications plus a significantly updated SharePoint 2013 web service. The Access Web model in Access 2010 was replaced by a new architecture that stores its data in actual SQL Server databases. Unlike SharePoint lists, this offers true relational database design with referential integrity, scalability, extensibility and performance one would expect from SQL Server. The database solutions that can be created on SharePoint 2013 offer a modern user interface designed to display multiple levels of relationships that can be viewed and edited, along with resizing for different devices and support for touch. The Access 2013 desktop is similar to Access 2010 but several features were discontinued including support for Access Data Projects (ADPs), pivot tables, pivot charts, Access data collections, source code control, replication, and other legacy features. Access desktop database maximum size remained 2\u00a0GB (as it has been since the 2000 version).\nMicrosoft Access is no longer included in the one-time-purchase version of Microsoft Office 2021, but remains within the Microsoft 365 counterpart, as Apps for business and Business Standard editions. Features new to Access 2021 include an extended-precision date/time data type and dark theme support.\nIn addition to using its own database storage file, Microsoft Access also may be used as the 'front-end' of a program while other products act as the 'back-end' tables, such as Microsoft SQL Server and non-Microsoft products such as Oracle and Sybase. Multiple backend sources can be used by a Microsoft Access Jet Database (ACCDB and MDB formats). Similarly, some applications such as Visual Basic, ASP.NET, or Visual Studio .NET will use the Microsoft Access database format for its tables and queries. Microsoft Access may also be part of a more complex solution, where it may be integrated with other technologies such as Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Outlook, Microsoft Word, Microsoft PowerPoint and ActiveX controls.\nAccess tables support a variety of standard field types, indices, and referential integrity including cascading updates and deletes. Access also includes a query interface, forms to display and enter data, and reports for printing. The underlying Access database, which contains these objects, is multi-user and handles record-locking.\nRepetitive tasks can be automated through macros with point and click options. It is also easy to place a database on a network and have multiple users share and update data without overwriting each other's work. Data is locked at the record level which is significantly different from Excel which locks the entire spreadsheet.\nThere are template databases within the program and for download from Microsoft's website. These options are available upon starting Access and allow users to enhance a database with predefined tables, queries, forms, reports, and macros. Database templates support VBA code, but Microsoft's templates do not include VBA code.\nProgrammers can create solutions using VBA, which is similar to Visual Basic 6.0 (VB6) and used throughout the Microsoft Office programs such as Excel, Word, Outlook and PowerPoint. Most VB6 code, including the use of Windows API calls, can be used in VBA. Power users and developers can extend basic end-user solutions to a professional solution with advanced automation, data validation, error trapping, and multi-user support.\nThe number of simultaneous users that can be supported depends on the amount of data, the tasks being performed, level of use, and application design. Generally accepted limits are solutions with 1 GB or less of data (Access supports up to 2 GB) and it performs quite well with 100 or fewer simultaneous connections (255 concurrent users are supported). This capability is often a good fit for department solutions. If using an Access database solution in a multi-user scenario, the application should be \"split\". This means that the tables are in one file called the back end (typically stored on a shared network folder) and the application components (forms, reports, queries, code, macros, linked tables) are in another file called the front end. The linked tables in the front end point to the back end file. Each user of the Access application would then receive his or her own copy of the front end file.\nApplications that run complex queries or analysis across large datasets would naturally require greater bandwidth and memory. Microsoft Access is designed to scale to support more data and users by linking to multiple Access databases or using a back-end database like Microsoft SQL Server. With the latter design, the amount of data and users can scale to enterprise-level solutions.\nMicrosoft Access's role in web development prior to version 2010 is limited. User interface features of Access, such as forms and reports, only work in Windows. In versions 2000 through 2003 an Access object type called Data Access Pages created publishable web pages. Data Access Pages are no longer supported. The Jet Database Engine, core to Access, can be accessed through technologies such as ODBC or OLE DB. The data (i.e., tables and queries) can be accessed by web-based applications developed in ASP.NET, PHP, or Java. With the use of Microsoft's Terminal Services and Remote Desktop Application in Windows Server 2008 R2, organizations can host Access applications so they can be run over the web. This technique does not scale the way a web application would but is appropriate for a limited number of users depending on the configuration of the host.\nAccess 2010 allows databases to be published to SharePoint 2010 web sites running Access Services. These web-based forms and reports run in any modern web browser. The resulting web forms and reports, when accessed via a web browser, do not require any add-ins or extensions (e.g., ActiveX and Silverlight).\nAccess 2013 can create web applications directly in SharePoint 2013 sites running Access Services. Access 2013 web solutions store its data in an underlying SQL Server database which is much more scalable and robust than the Access 2010 version which used SharePoint lists to store its data.\nAccess Services in SharePoint has since been retired.\nA compiled version of an Access database (file extensions .MDE /ACCDE or .ADE; ACCDE only works with Access 2007 or later) can be created to prevent users from accessing the design surfaces to modify module code, forms, and reports. An MDE or ADE file is a Microsoft Access database file with all modules compiled and all editable source code removed. Both the .MDE and .ADE versions of an Access database are used when end-user modifications are not allowed or when the application's source code should be kept confidential.\nMicrosoft also offers developer extensions for download to help distribute Access 2007 applications, create database templates, and integrate source code control with Microsoft Visual SourceSafe.\nFeatures.\nUsers can create tables, queries, forms and reports, and connect them together with macros. Advanced users can use VBA to write rich solutions with advanced data manipulation and user control. Access also has report creation features that can work with any data source that Access can access.\nThe original concept of Access was for end users to be able to access data from any source. Other features include: the import and export of data to many formats including Excel, Outlook, ASCII, dBase, Paradox, FoxPro, SQL Server and Oracle. It also has the ability to link to data in its existing location and use it for viewing, querying, editing, and reporting. This allows the existing data to change while ensuring that Access uses the latest data. It can perform heterogeneous joins between data sets stored across different platforms. Access is often used by people downloading data from enterprise level databases for manipulation, analysis, and reporting locally.\nThere is also the Access Database (ACE and formerly Jet) format (MDB or ACCDB in Access 2007) which can contain the application and data in one file. This makes it very convenient to distribute the entire application to another user, who can run it in disconnected environments.\nOne of the benefits of Access from a programmer's perspective is its relative compatibility with SQL (structured query language)\u2014queries can be viewed graphically or edited as SQL statements, and SQL statements can be used directly in Macros and VBA Modules to manipulate Access tables. Users can mix and use both VBA and \"Macros\" for programming forms and logic and offers object-oriented possibilities. VBA can also be included in queries.\nMicrosoft Access offers parameterized queries. These queries and Access tables can be referenced from other programs like VB6 and .NET through DAO or ADO. From Microsoft Access, VBA can reference parameterized stored procedures via ADO.\nThe desktop editions of Microsoft SQL Server can be used with Access as an alternative to the Jet Database Engine. This support started with MSDE (Microsoft SQL Server Desktop Engine), a scaled down version of Microsoft SQL Server 2000, and continues with the SQL Server Express versions of SQL Server 2005 and 2008.\nMicrosoft Access is a file server-based database. Unlike client\u2013server relational database management systems (RDBMS), Microsoft Access does not implement database triggers, stored procedures, or transaction logging. Access 2010 includes table-level triggers and stored procedures built into the ACE data engine. Thus a Client-server database system is not a requirement for using stored procedures or table triggers with Access 2010.\nTables, queries, forms, reports and macros can now be developed specifically for web based applications in Access 2010. Integration with Microsoft SharePoint 2010 is also highly improved.\nThe 2013 edition of Microsoft Access introduced a mostly flat design and the ability to install apps from the Office Store, but it did not introduce new features. The theme was partially updated again for 2016, but no dark theme was created for Access.\nAccess Services and Web database.\nASP.NET web forms can query a Microsoft Access database, retrieve records and display them on the browser.\nSharePoint Server 2010 via Access Services allows for Access 2010 databases to be published to SharePoint, thus enabling multiple users to interact with the database application from any standards-compliant Web browser. Access Web databases published to SharePoint Server can use standard objects such as tables, queries, forms, macros, and reports. Access Services stores those objects in SharePoint.\nAccess 2013 offers the ability to publish Access web solutions on SharePoint 2013. Rather than using SharePoint lists as its data source, Access 2013 uses an actual SQL Server database hosted by SharePoint or SQL Azure. This offers a true relational database with referential integrity, scalability, maintainability, and extensibility compared to the SharePoint views Access 2010 used. The macro language is enhanced to support more sophisticated programming logic and database level automation.\nImport or link sources.\nMicrosoft Access can also import or link directly to data stored in other applications and databases. Microsoft Office Access 2007 and newer can import from or link to:\nMicrosoft Access Runtime.\nMicrosoft offers free runtime versions of Microsoft Access which allow users to run an Access desktop application without needing to purchase or install a retail version of Microsoft Access. This actually allows Access developers to create databases that can be freely distributed to an unlimited number of end-users. These runtime versions of Access 2007 and later can be downloaded for free from Microsoft. The runtime versions for Access 2003 and earlier were part of the Office Developer Extensions/Toolkit and required a separate purchase.\nThe runtime version allows users to view, edit and delete data, along with running queries, forms, reports, macros and VBA module code. The runtime version does not allow users to change the design of Microsoft Access tables, queries, forms, reports, macros or module code. The runtime versions are similar to their corresponding full version of Access and usually compatible with earlier versions; for example Access Runtime 2010 allows a user to run an Access application made with the 2010 version as well as 2007 through 2000. Due to deprecated features in Access 2013, its runtime version is also unable to support those older features. During development one can simulate the runtime environment from the fully functional version by using the codice_1 command-line option.\nDevelopment.\nAccess stores all database tables, queries, forms, reports, macros, and modules in the Access Jet database as a single file.\nFor query development, Access offers a \"Query Designer\", a graphical user interface that allows users to build queries without knowledge of structured query language. In the Query Designer, users can \"show\" the datasources of the query (which can be tables or queries) and select the fields they want returned by clicking and dragging them into the grid. One can set up joins by clicking and dragging fields in tables to fields in other tables. Access allows users to view and manipulate the SQL code if desired. Any Access table, including linked tables from different data sources, can be used in a query.\nAccess also supports the creation of \"pass-through queries\". These snippets of SQL code can address external data sources through the use of ODBC connections on the local machine. This enables users to interact with data stored outside the Access program without using linked tables or Jet.\nUsers construct the pass-through queries using the SQL syntax supported by the external data source.\nWhen developing reports (in \"Design View\") additions or changes to controls cause any linked queries to execute in the background and the designer is forced to wait for records to be returned before being able to make another change. This feature cannot be turned off.\nNon-programmers can use the macro feature to automate simple tasks through a series of drop-down selections. Macros allow users to easily chain commands together such as running queries, importing or exporting data, opening and closing forms, previewing and printing reports, etc. Macros support basic logic (IF-conditions) and the ability to call other macros. Macros can also contain sub-macros which are similar to subroutines. In Access 2007, enhanced macros included error-handling and support for temporary variables. Access 2007 also introduced embedded macros that are essentially properties of an object's event. This eliminated the need to store macros as individual objects. However, macros were limited in their functionality by a lack of programming loops and advanced coding logic until Access 2013. With significant further enhancements introduced in Access 2013, the capabilities of macros became fully comparable to VBA. They made feature rich web-based application deployments practical, via a greatly enhanced Microsoft SharePoint interface and tools, as well as on traditional Windows desktops.\nIn common with other products in the Microsoft Office suite, the other programming language used in Access is Microsoft VBA. It is similar to Visual Basic 6.0 (VB6) and code can be stored in modules, classes, and code behind forms and reports. To create a richer, more efficient and maintainable finished product with good error handling, most professional Access applications are developed using the VBA programming language rather than macros, except where web deployment is a business requirement.\nTo manipulate data in tables and queries in VBA or macros, Microsoft provides two database access libraries of COM components:\nAs well as DAO and ADO, developers can also use OLE DB and ODBC for developing native C/C++ programs for Access. For ADPs and the direct manipulation of SQL Server data, ADO is required. DAO is most appropriate for managing data in Access/Jet databases, and the only way to manipulate the complex field types in ACCDB tables.\nIn the database container or navigation pane in Access 2007 and later versions, the system automatically categorizes each object by type (e.g., table, query, macro). Many Access developers use the Leszynski naming convention, though this is not universal; it is a programming convention, not a DBMS-enforced rule. It is particularly helpful in VBA where references to object names may not indicate its data type (e.g. tbl for tables, qry for queries).\nDevelopers deploy Microsoft Access most often for individual and workgroup projects (the Access 97 speed characterization was done for 32 users). Since Access 97, and with Access 2003 and 2007, Microsoft Access and hardware have evolved significantly. Databases under 1 GB in size (which can now fit entirely in RAM) and 200 simultaneous users are well within the capabilities of Microsoft Access. Of course, performance depends on the database design and tasks. Disk-intensive work such as complex searching and querying take the most time.\nAs data from a Microsoft Access database can be cached in RAM, processing speed may substantially improve when there is only a single user or if the data is not changing. In the past, the effect of packet latency on the record-locking system caused Access databases to run slowly on a virtual private network (VPN) or a wide area network (WAN) against a Jet database. As of 2010,[ [update]] broadband connections have mitigated this issue. Performance can also be enhanced if a continuous connection is maintained to the back-end database throughout the session rather than opening and closing it for each table access.\nIn July 2011, Microsoft acknowledged an intermittent query performance problem with all versions of Access and Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 due to the nature of resource management being vastly different in newer operating systems. This issue severely affects query performance on both Access 2003 and earlier with the Jet Database Engine code, as well as Access 2007 and later with the Access Database Engine (ACE). Microsoft has issued hotfixes http:// for Access 2007 and http:// for Access 2010, but will not fix the issue with Jet 4.0 as it is out of mainstream support.\nIn earlier versions of Microsoft Access, the ability to distribute applications required the purchase of the Developer Toolkit; in Access 2007, 2010 and Access 2013 the \"Runtime Only\" version is offered as a free download, making the distribution of royalty-free applications possible on Windows XP, Vista, 7 and Windows 8.x.\nSplit database architecture.\nMicrosoft Access applications can adopt a split-database architecture. The single database can be divided into a separate \"back-end\" file that contains the data tables (shared on a file server) and a \"front-end\" (containing the application's objects such as queries, forms, reports, macros, and modules). The \"front-end\" Access application is distributed to each user's desktop and linked to the shared database. Using this approach, each user has a copy of Microsoft Access (or the runtime version) installed on their machine along with their application database. This reduces network traffic since the application is not retrieved for each use. The \"front-end\" database can still contain local tables for storing a user's settings or temporary data. This split-database design also allows development of the application independent of the data. One disadvantage is that users may make various changes to their own local copy of the application and this makes it hard to manage version control. When a new version is ready, the front-end database is replaced without impacting the data database. Microsoft Access has two built-in utilities, Database Splitter and Linked Table Manager, to facilitate this architecture.\nLinked tables in Access use absolute paths rather than relative paths, so the development environment either has to have the same path as the production environment or a \"dynamic-linker\" routine can be written in VBA.\nFor very large Access databases, this may have performance issues and a SQL backend should be considered in these circumstances. This is less of an issue if the entire database can fit in the PC's RAM since Access caches data and indexes.\nMigration to SQL Server.\nTo scale Access applications to enterprise or web solutions, one possible technique involves migrating to Microsoft SQL Server or equivalent server database. A client\u2013server design significantly reduces maintenance and increases security, availability, stability, and transaction logging.\nAccess 2000 through Access 2010 included a feature called the Upsizing Wizard that allowed users to upgrade their databases to Microsoft SQL Server, an ODBC client\u2013server database. This feature was removed from Access 2013. An additional solution, the SQL Server Migration Assistant for Access (SSMA), continues to be available for free download from Microsoft.\nA variety of upgrading options are available. After migrating the data and queries to SQL Server, the Access database can be linked to the SQL database, subject to data type conversion limitations: \nRegardless, SQL Server is still the easiest migration. Retrieving data from linked tables is optimized to just the records needed, but this scenario may operate less efficiently than what would otherwise be optimal for SQL Server. For example, in instances where multi-table joins still require copying the whole table across the network.\nIn previous versions of Access, including Access 2010, databases can also be converted to Access Data Projects (ADP) which are tied directly to one SQL Server database. This feature was removed from Access 2013. ADP's support the ability to directly create and modify SQL Server objects such as tables, views, stored procedures, and SQL Server constraints. The views and stored procedures can significantly reduce the network traffic for multi-table joins. SQL Server supports temporary tables and links to other data sources beyond the single SQL Server database.\nFinally, some Access databases are completely replaced by another technology such as ASP.NET or Java once the data is converted. However, any migration may dictate major effort since the Access SQL language is a more powerful superset of standard SQL. Further, Access application procedures, whether VBA and macros, are written at a relatively higher level versus the currently available alternatives that are both robust and comprehensive. The Access macro language, allowing an even higher level of abstraction than VBA, was significantly enhanced in Access 2010 and again in Access 2013.\nIn many cases, developers build direct web-to-data interfaces using ASP.NET, while keeping major business automation processes, administrative and reporting functions that do not need to be distributed to everyone in Access for information workers to maintain.\nWhile all Access data can migrate to SQL Server directly, some queries cannot migrate successfully. In some situations, you may need to translate VBA functions and user defined functions into T\u2013SQL or .NET functions / procedures. Crosstab queries can be migrated to SQL Server using the PIVOT command.\nProtection.\nMicrosoft Access applications can be made secure by various methods, the most basic being password access control; this is a relatively weak form of protection.\nA higher level of protection is the use of workgroup security requiring a user name and password. Users and groups can be specified along with their rights at the object type or individual object level. This can be used to specify people with read-only or data entry rights but may be challenging to specify. A separate workgroup security file contains the settings which can be used to manage multiple databases. Workgroup security is not supported in the Access 2007 and Access 2010 ACCDB database format, although Access 2007 and Access 2010 still support it for MDB databases.\nDatabases can also be encrypted. The ACCDB format offers significantly advanced encryption from previous versions.\nAdditionally, if the database design needs to be secured to prevent changes, Access databases can be locked/protected (and the source code compiled) by converting the database to a .MDE file. All changes to the VBA project (modules, forms, or reports) need to be made to the original MDB and then reconverted to MDE. In Access 2007 and Access 2010, the ACCDB database is converted to an ACCDE file. Some tools are available for unlocking and \"decompiling\", although certain elements including original VBA comments and formatting are normally irretrievable.\nFile extensions.\nMicrosoft Access saves information under the following file formats:\nVersions.\nThere are no Access versions between 2.0 and 7.0 because the Office 95 version was launched with Word 7. All of the Office 95 products have OLE 2 capabilities, and Access 7 shows that it was compatible with Word 7.\nVersion number 13 was skipped.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The reactants, products, and intermediates of an enzymatic reaction are known as metabolites, which are modified by a sequence of chemical reactions catalyzed by enzymes. In most cases of a metabolic pathway, the product of one enzyme acts as the substrate for the next. However, side products are considered waste and removed from the cell.\nDifferent metabolic pathways function in the position within a eukaryotic cell and the significance of the pathway in the given compartment of the cell. For instance, the electron transport chain and oxidative phosphorylation all take place in the mitochondrial membrane. In contrast, glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway, and fatty acid biosynthesis all occur in the cytosol of a cell.\nThere are two types of metabolic pathways that are characterized by their ability to either synthesize molecules with the utilization of energy (anabolic pathway), or break down complex molecules and release energy in the process (catabolic pathway).\nThe two pathways complement each other in that the energy released from one is used up by the other. The degradative process of a catabolic pathway provides the energy required to conduct the biosynthesis of an anabolic pathway. In addition to the two distinct metabolic pathways is the amphibolic pathway, which can be either catabolic or anabolic based on the need for or the availability of energy.\nPathways are required for the maintenance of homeostasis within an organism and the flux of metabolites through a pathway is regulated depending on the needs of the cell and the availability of the substrate. The end product of a pathway may be used immediately, initiate another metabolic pathway or be stored for later use. The metabolism of a cell consists of an elaborate network of interconnected pathways that enable the synthesis and breakdown of molecules (anabolism and catabolism).\nOverview.\nEach metabolic pathway consists of a series of biochemical reactions that are connected by their intermediates: the products of one reaction are the substrates for subsequent reactions, and so on. Metabolic pathways are often considered to flow in one direction. Although all chemical reactions are technically reversible, conditions in the cell are often such that it is thermodynamically more favorable for flux to proceed in one direction of a reaction. For example, one pathway may be responsible for the synthesis of a particular amino acid, but the breakdown of that amino acid may occur via a separate and distinct pathway. One example of an exception to this \"rule\" is the metabolism of glucose. Glycolysis results in the breakdown of glucose, but several reactions in the glycolysis pathway are reversible and participate in the re-synthesis of glucose (gluconeogenesis).\nMajor metabolic pathways.\nCatabolic pathway (catabolism).\nA catabolic pathway is a series of reactions that bring about a net release of energy in the form of a high energy phosphate bond formed with the energy carriers adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and guanosine diphosphate (GDP) to produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and guanosine triphosphate (GTP), respectively. The net reaction is, therefore, thermodynamically favorable, for it results in a lower free energy for the final products. A catabolic pathway is an exergonic system that produces chemical energy in the form of ATP, GTP, NADH, NADPH, FADH2, etc. from energy containing sources such as carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. The end products are often carbon dioxide, water, and ammonia. Coupled with an endergonic reaction of anabolism, the cell can synthesize new macromolecules using the original precursors of the anabolic pathway. An example of a coupled reaction is the phosphorylation of fructose-6-phosphate to form the intermediate fructose-1,6-bisphosphate by the enzyme phosphofructokinase accompanied by the hydrolysis of ATP in the pathway of glycolysis. The resulting chemical reaction within the metabolic pathway is highly thermodynamically favorable and, as a result, irreversible in the cell.\n&lt;chem&gt;Fructose-6-Phosphate + ATP -&gt; Fructose-1,6-Bisphosphate + ADP&lt;/chem&gt;\nCellular respiration.\nA core set of energy-producing catabolic pathways occur within all living organisms in some form. These pathways transfer the energy released by breakdown of nutrients into ATP and other small molecules used for energy (e.g. GTP, NADPH, FADH2). All cells can perform anaerobic respiration by glycolysis. Additionally, most organisms can perform more efficient aerobic respiration through the citric acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation. Additionally plants, algae and cyanobacteria are able to use sunlight to anabolically synthesize compounds from non-living matter by photosynthesis.\nAnabolic pathway (anabolism).\nIn contrast to catabolic pathways, anabolic pathways require an energy input to construct macromolecules such as polypeptides, nucleic acids, proteins, polysaccharides, and lipids. The isolated reaction of anabolism is unfavorable in a cell due to a positive Gibbs free energy (+\u0394\"G\"). Thus, an input of chemical energy through a coupling with an exergonic reaction is necessary. The coupled reaction of the catabolic pathway affects the thermodynamics of the reaction by lowering the overall activation energy of an anabolic pathway and allowing the reaction to take place. Otherwise, an endergonic reaction is non-spontaneous.\nAn anabolic pathway is a biosynthetic pathway, meaning that it combines smaller molecules to form larger and more complex ones. An example is the reversed pathway of glycolysis, otherwise known as gluconeogenesis, which occurs in the liver and sometimes in the kidney to maintain proper glucose concentration in the blood and supply the brain and muscle tissues with adequate amount of glucose. Although gluconeogenesis is similar to the reverse pathway of glycolysis, it contains four distinct enzymes(pyruvate carboxylase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase, glucose 6-phosphatase) from glycolysis that allow the pathway to occur spontaneously.\nAmphibolic pathway (Amphibolism).\nAn amphibolic pathway is one that can be either catabolic or anabolic based on the availability of or the need for energy. The currency of energy in a biological cell is adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which stores its energy in the phosphoanhydride bonds. The energy is utilized to conduct biosynthesis, facilitate movement, and regulate active transport inside of the cell. Examples of amphibolic pathways are the citric acid cycle and the glyoxylate cycle. These sets of chemical reactions contain both energy producing and utilizing pathways. To the right is an illustration of the amphibolic properties of the TCA cycle.\nThe glyoxylate shunt pathway is an alternative to the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, for it redirects the pathway of TCA to prevent full oxidation of carbon compounds, and to preserve high energy carbon sources as future energy sources. This pathway occurs only in plants and bacteria and transpires in the absence of glucose molecules.\nRegulation.\nThe flux of the entire pathway is regulated by the rate-determining steps. These are the slowest steps in a network of reactions. The rate-limiting step occurs near the beginning of the pathway and is regulated by feedback inhibition, which ultimately controls the overall rate of the pathway. The metabolic pathway in the cell is regulated by covalent or non-covalent modifications. A covalent modification involves an addition or removal of a chemical bond, whereas a non-covalent modification (also known as allosteric regulation) is the binding of the regulator to the enzyme via hydrogen bonds, electrostatic interactions, and Van der Waals forces.\nThe rate of turnover in a metabolic pathway, also known as the metabolic flux, is regulated based on the stoichiometric reaction model, the utilization rate of metabolites, and the translocation pace of molecules across the lipid bilayer. The regulation methods are based on experiments involving 13C-labeling, which is then analyzed by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) or gas chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry (GC\u2013MS)\u2013derived mass compositions. The aforementioned techniques synthesize a statistical interpretation of mass distribution in proteinogenic amino acids to the catalytic activities of enzymes in a cell.\nClinical applications in targeting metabolic pathways.\nTargeting oxidative phosphorylation.\nMetabolic pathways can be targeted for clinically therapeutic uses. Within the mitochondrial metabolic network, for instance, there are various pathways that can be targeted by compounds to prevent cancer cell proliferation. One such pathway is oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) within the electron transport chain (ETC). Various inhibitors can downregulate the electrochemical reactions that take place at Complex I, II, III, and IV, thereby preventing the formation of an electrochemical gradient and downregulating the movement of electrons through the ETC. The substrate-level phosphorylation that occurs at ATP synthase can also be directly inhibited, preventing the formation of ATP that is necessary to supply energy for cancer cell proliferation. Some of these inhibitors, such as lonidamine and atovaquone, which inhibit Complex II and Complex III, respectively, are currently undergoing clinical trials for FDA approval. Other non-FDA-approved inhibitors have still shown experimental success in vitro.\nTargeting Heme.\nHeme, an important prosthetic group present in Complexes I, II, and IV can also be targeted, since heme biosynthesis and uptake have been correlated with increased cancer progression. Various molecules can inhibit heme via different mechanisms. For instance, succinylacetone has been shown to decrease heme concentrations by inhibiting \u03b4-aminolevulinic acid in murine erythroleukemia cells. The primary structure of heme-sequestering peptides, such as HSP1 and HSP2, can be modified to downregulate heme concentrations and reduce proliferation of non-small lung cancer cells.\nTargeting the tricarboxylic acid cycle and glutaminolysis.\nThe tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) and glutaminolysis can also be targeted for cancer treatment, since they are essential for the survival and proliferation of cancer cells. Ivosidenib and enasidenib, two FDA-approved cancer treatments, can arrest the TCA cycle of cancer cells by inhibiting isocitrate dehydrogenase-1 (IDH1) and isocitrate dehydrogenase-2 (IDH2), respectively. Ivosidenib is specific to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and cholangiocarcinoma, whereas enasidenib is specific to just acute myeloid leukemia (AML).\nIn a clinical trial consisting of 185 adult patients with cholangiocarcinoma and an IDH-1 mutation, there was a statistically significant improvement (p&lt;0.0001; HR: 0.37) in patients randomized to ivosidenib. Still, some of the adverse side effects in these patients included fatigue, nausea, diarrhea, decreased appetite, ascites, and anemia. In a clinical trial consisting of 199 adult patients with AML and an IDH2 mutation, 23% of patients experienced complete response (CR) or complete response with partial hematologic recovery (CRh) lasting a median of 8.2 months while on enasidenib. Of the 157 patients who required transfusion at the beginning of the trial, 34% no longer required transfusions during the 56-day time period on enasidenib. Of the 42% of patients who did not require transfusions at the beginning of the trial, 76% still did not require a transfusion by the end of the trial. Side effects of enasidenib included nausea, diarrhea, elevated bilirubin and, most notably, differentiation syndrome.\nGlutaminase (GLS), the enzyme responsible for converting glutamine to glutamate via hydrolytic deamidation during the first reaction of glutaminolysis, can also be targeted. In recent years, many small molecules, such as azaserine, acivicin, and CB-839 have been shown to inhibit glutaminase, thus reducing cancer cell viability and inducing apoptosis in cancer cells. Due to its effective antitumor ability in several cancer types such as ovarian, breast and lung cancers, CB-839 is the only GLS inhibitor currently undergoing clinical studies for FDA-approval.\nGenetic engineering of metabolic pathways.\nMany metabolic pathways are of commercial interest. For instance, the production of many antibiotics or other drugs requires complex pathways. The pathways to produce such compounds can be transplanted into microbes or other more suitable organism for production purposes. For example, the world's supply of the anti-cancer drug vinblastine is produced by relatively ineffient extraction and purification of the precursors vindoline and catharanthine from the plant \"Catharanthus roseus\", which are then chemically converted into vinblastine. The biosynthetic pathway to produce vinblastine, including 30 enzymatic steps, has been transferred into yeast cells which is a convenient system to grow in large amounts. With these genetic modifications yeast can use its own metabolites geranyl pyrophosphate and tryptophan to produce the precursors of catharanthine and vindoline. This process required 56 genetic edits, including expression of 34 heterologous genes from plants in yeast cells.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

According to this belief, a Messianic Age (the so-called \"Christian Millennium\") will be established on Earth prior to the Last Judgment and the future permanent state of \"eternity\".\nChristianity and Judaism have both produced messianic movements which featured millennialist teachings\u2014such as the notion that an earthly kingdom of God was at hand. These millenarian movements often led to considerable social unrest.\nSimilarities to millennialism also exist in Zoroastrianism, which identified successive thousand-year periods, each of which will end in a cataclysm of heresy and destruction, until the final destruction of evil and the final destruction of the spirit of evil by a triumphant king of peace at the end of the final millennial age. Jewish and then Christian interpretations built on Zoroastrianism and on Babylonian astrology, resulting in the construction of a schema of a sequence of seven successive thousand-year periods (\"millennia\") of earthly human existence.\nScholars have linked various social and political movements, both religious and secular, to millennialist metaphors.\nChristianity.\nMost Christian millennialist thinking is based upon the Book of Revelation, specifically Revelation 20, which describes the vision of an angel who descends from heaven with a large chain and a key to a bottomless pit, and captures Satan, imprisoning him for a thousand years:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;He seized the dragon, that ancient serpent, who is the Devil and Satan, and bound him for a thousand years and threw him into the pit and locked and sealed it over him, so that he would deceive the nations no more, until the thousand years were ended. After that, he must be let out for a little while.\u2014\u200a\nThe Book of Revelation then describes a series of judges who are seated on thrones, as well as John's vision of the souls of those who were beheaded for their testimony in favor of Jesus and their rejection of the mark of the beast. These souls:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;came to life and reigned with Christ a thousand years. (The rest of the dead did not come to life until the thousand years were ended.) This is the first resurrection. Blessed and holy are those who share in the first resurrection. Over these the second death has no power, but they will be priests of God and of Christ, and they will reign with him a thousand years\u2014\u200a\nEarly church.\nPremillennialism.\nDuring the first centuries after Christ, various forms of chiliasm (millennialism) were to be found in the Church, both East and West. Premillennialism held by the Early Church is called \"historic premillennialism\", and it was supported in the early church by Papias, Irenaeus, Justin Martyr, Tertullian, Polycarp, Pseudo-Barnabas, Methodius, Lactantius, Commodianus, Theophilus, Melito, Hippolytus of Rome, Victorinus of Pettau, Nepos, Julius Africanus, Tatian and Montanus. However, the premillennial views of Montanus probably affected the later rejection of premillennialism in the Church, as Montanism was seen as a heresy. \nAmillennialism.\nIn the 2nd century, the Alogi (those who rejected all of John's writings) were amillennial, as was Caius in the first quarter of the 3rd century. With the influence of Platonism, Clement of Alexandria and Origen denied premillennialism. Likewise, Dionysius of Alexandria (died 264) argued that Revelation was not written by John and could not be interpreted literally; he was amillennial.\nJustin Martyr (died 165), who had chiliastic tendencies in his theology, mentions differing views in his \"Dialogue with Trypho the Jew\", chapter 80:\"I and many others are of this opinion [premillennialism], and [believe] that such will take place, as you assuredly are aware; but, on the other hand, I signified to you that many who belong to the pure and pious faith, and are true Christians, think otherwise.\"Augustine in his early days affirmed premillennialism, but later changed to amillennialism, causing the view to become popularized together with Pope Gregory the Great.\nThe \"Catholic Encyclopedia\" notes that the 2nd-century proponents of various Gnostic beliefs (themselves considered heresies) also rejected millenarianism.\nReformation and beyond.\nChristian views on the future order of events diversified after the Protestant Reformation (c.\u20091517). In particular, new emphasis was placed on the passages in the Book of Revelation which seemed to say that as Christ would return to judge the living and the dead, Satan would be locked away for 1000 years, but then released on the world to instigate a final battle against God and his Saints. Previous Catholic and Orthodox theologians had no clear or consensus view on what this actually meant (only the concept of the end of the world coming unexpectedly, \"like a thief in the night\", and the concept of \"the Antichrist\" were almost universally held). Millennialist theories try to explain what this \"1000 years of Satan bound in chains\" would be like.\nVarious types of millennialism exist with regard to Christian eschatology, especially within Protestantism, such as Premillennialism, Postmillennialism, and Amillennialism. The first two refer to different views of the relationship between the \"millennial Kingdom\" and Christ's second coming.\nPremillennialism sees Christ's second advent as preceding the millennium, thereby separating the Second Coming from the Final Judgment. In this view, \"Christ's reign\" will be physically on the earth.\nPostmillennialism sees Christ's second coming as subsequent to the millennium and concurrent with the final judgment. In this view \"Christ's reign\" (during the millennium) will be spiritual in and through the church.\nAmillennialism sees the 1000 year kingdom as being metaphorically described in Rev. 20:1\u20136 in which \"Christ's reign\" is current in and through the church. Thus, while this view does not hold to a future millennial reign, it does hold that the New Heavens and New Earth will appear upon the return of Christ.\n19th and 20th centuries.\nCatholic Church.\nThe Catholic Church strongly condemns millennialism as the following shows:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The Antichrist's deception already begins to take shape in the world every time the claim is made to realize within history that messianic hope which can only be realized beyond history through the eschatological judgment. The Church has rejected even modified forms of this falsification of the kingdom to come under the name of millenarianism, especially the \"intrinsically perverse\" political form of a secular messianism.\u2014\u200a\nBible Student movement.\nThe Bible Student movement is a millennialist movement based on views expressed in \"The Divine Plan of the Ages,\" in 1886, in Volume One of the \"Studies in the Scriptures\" series, by Pastor Charles Taze Russell. (This series is still being published, since 1927, by the Dawn Bible Students Association.) Bible Students believe that there will be a universal opportunity for every person, past and present, not previously recipients of a heavenly calling, to gain everlasting life on Earth during the Millennium.\nJehovah's Witnesses.\nJehovah's Witnesses believe that Christ will rule from heaven for 1,000 years as king over the earth, assisted by the 144,000 ascended humans. According to them during this 1,000 year reign the earth will become a paradise, like the Garden of Eden, and humans will themselves return to the perfection lost by Adam and Eve.\nThe Church of Almighty God.\nAlso known as Eastern Lightning, The Church of Almighty God mentions in its teachings the Age of Millennial Kingdom, which will follow the catastrophes prophesied in the Book of Revelation in the Bible.\nNew Apostolic Reformation.\nCounter to much of the Pentecostal movement, which tends towards belief in premillennialism, the rise of the Antichrist, and the decay of the world prior to the Second Coming, the New Apostolic Reformation's focus is instead on an \"optimistic\" eschatology. It holds that most end-time prophecies have long since been fulfilled and that modern-day prophets and apostles have divine authority; the end times will be an era in which obedient Christians, through using spiritual warfare and shaping all aspects of society into aligning with their Christian beliefs (Seven Mountain Mandate), will bring about the Second Coming.\nJudaism.\nMillennialist thinking first emerged in Jewish apocryphal literature of the tumultuous Second Temple period,\nGerschom Scholem profiles medieval and early modern Jewish millennialist teachings in his book \"Sabbatai Sevi, the mystical messiah\", which focuses on the 17th-century movement centered on the self-proclaimed messiahship (1648) of Sabbatai Zevi (1626\u20131676)\nIslam.\nThe Prophet Muhammad has stated that a man from his Household will come and rid the world of all injustice and tyranny. He will be known as the Mahdi.\nMuslims also believe that Jesus will come alongside the Mahdi and will fight together with him against oppression and injustice, where the Mahdi will rule for a period of time before the Day of Judgement. The Mahdi is noted in the Sunni books, Sunan Abi Dawud 4285, Sunan Ibn Majah 4083, and Sahih Muslim 2913.\nShia and Sunni Muslims differ on who exactly the Mahdi is. While they both agree that he will come alongside Jesus to save mankind from injustice and oppression; Sunnis believe he is yet to be born, while Shias believe that he is currently alive and in occultation.\nBaha'i Faith.\nBah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h mentioned in the \"Kit\u00e1b-i-\u00cdq\u00e1n\" that God will renew the \"City of God\" about every thousand years, and specifically mentioned that a new Manifestation of God would not appear within 1,000 years (1852\u20132852 CE) of Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h's Dispensation, but that the authority of Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h's message could last up to 500,000 years.\nFurther reading: William P. Collins (2025). \"https://\". Routledge.\nTheosophy.\nThe Theosophist Alice Bailey taught that \"The Christ\" or \"The World Teacher\" would return \"sometime after AD 2025\", and that this would be the New Age equivalent of the Christian concept of the Second Coming of Christ. Note that the being she speaks of as \"The World Teacher\" is the same as that spiritual being best known to other Theosophists as \"Maitreya\".\nSocial movements.\nMillennial social movements, a specific form of millenarianism, have as their basis some concept of a cycle of one-thousand years. Sometimes the two terms are used as synonyms, but purists regard this as not entirely accurate. Millennial social movements need not have a religious foundation, but they must have a vision of an apocalypse that can be utopian or dystopian. Those associated with millennial social movements are \"prone to [be violent]\", with certain types of millennialism connected to violence.\nIn progressive millennialism, the \"transformation of the social order is gradual and humans play a role in fostering that transformation\".\nCatastrophic millennialism \"deems the current social order as irrevocably corrupt, and total destruction of this order is necessary as the precursor to the building of a new, godly order\".\nHowever, the link between millennialism and violence may be problematic, as new religious movements may stray from the catastrophic view as time progresses.\nNazism.\nThe most controversial interpretation of the three-age system and of millennialism in general involves Adolf Hitler's \"Third Reich\" (), which in his vision would last for a thousand years to come () but ultimately lasted for only 12 years (1933\u20131945).\nThe German thinker Arthur Moeller van den Bruck coined the phrase \"Third Reich\" and in 1923 published a book titled \"Das Dritte Reich\". Looking back at German history, he distinguished two separate periods, and identified them with the ages of the 12th-century Italian theologian Joachim of Fiore:\nAfter the interval of the Weimar Republic (1918 onwards), during which constitutionalism, parliamentarianism and even pacifism dominated, these were then to be followed by:\nAlthough van den Bruck was unimpressed by Hitler when he met him in 1922 and did not join the Nazi Party, nevertheless the Nazis adopted the term \"Third Reich\" to label the totalitarian state they wanted to set up when they gained power, which they succeeded in doing in 1933. Later, however, the Nazi authorities banned the informal use of \"Third Reich\" throughout the German press in the summer of 1939, instructing it to use more official terms such as \"German Reich\", \"Greater German Reich\", and \"National Socialist Germany\" exclusively.\nDuring the early part of the Third Reich many Germans also referred to Hitler as being the \"German Messiah\", especially when he conducted the Nuremberg rallies, which came to be held annually (1933\u20131938) at a date somewhat before the September equinox in Nuremberg.\nIn a speech held on 27 November 1937, Hitler commented on his plans to have major parts of Berlin torn down and rebuilt:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;[...] to build a millennial city adequate [in splendour] to a thousand-year-old people with a thousand-year-old historical and cultural past, for its never-ending [glorious] future [...]\nAfter Adolf Hitler's unsuccessful attempt to implement a thousand-year reign, the Vatican issued an official statement that millennial claims could not be safely taught and that the related scriptures in Revelation (also called the Apocalypse) should be understood spiritually. Catholic author Bernard LeFrois wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Millenium [\"sic\"]: [...] Since the Holy Office decreed (July 21, 1944) that it cannot be safely taught that Christ at His Second Coming will reign visibly with only some of His saints (risen from the dead) for a period of time before the final and universal judgment, a spiritual millenium is to be seen in Apoc. 20:4\u20136. St. John gives a recapitulation of the activity of Satan, and the spiritual reign of the saints with Christ in heaven and in His Church on earth.\u2014\u200a\nUtopianism.\nThe early Christian concepts of millennialism had ramifications far beyond strictly religious concerns during the centuries to come, as various theorists blended and enhanced them with ideas of utopia.\nIn the wake of early millennial thinking, the Three Ages philosophy developed. The Italian monk and theologian Joachim of Fiore (died 1202) saw all of human history as a succession of three ages:\nIt was believed that the Age of the Holy Spirit would begin at c.\u20091260, and that from then on all believers would live as monks, mystically transfigured and full of praise for God, for a thousand years until Judgment Day would put an end to the history of our planet.\nJoachim of Fiore's divisions of historical time also highly influenced the New Age movement, which transformed the Three Ages philosophy into astrological terminology, relating the Northern-hemisphere vernal equinox to different constellations of the zodiac. In this scenario the Age of the Father was recast as the Age of Aries, the Age of the Son became the Age of Pisces, and the Age of the Holy Spirit was called the Aquarian New Age. The current so-called \"Age of Aquarius\" will supposedly witness the development of a number of great changes for humankind, reflecting the typical features of some manifestations of millennialism.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The original \"Might and Magic\" series ended with the closure of the 3DO Company. The rights to the \"Might and Magic\" name were purchased for US$1.3 million by Ubisoft, which rebooted the franchise with a new series with no apparent connection to the previous continuity, starting with the games \"Heroes of Might and Magic V\" and \"Dark Messiah of Might and Magic\".\nHistory.\nSpin-offs.\nThere have been several spin-offs from the main series, including the long-running \"Heroes of Might and Magic\" series, \"Crusaders of Might and Magic\", \"Warriors of Might and Magic\", \"Shifters of Might and Magic\", \"Legends of Might and Magic\", \"\", and the fan-made \"Swords of Xeen\".\nIn August 2003, Ubisoft acquired the rights to the \"Might and Magic\" franchise for US$1.3 million after 3DO filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Ubisoft has since released multiple new projects using the \"Might and Magic\" brand, including a fifth installment of the \"Heroes\" series developed by Nival, an action-style game \"Dark Messiah of Might and Magic\" developed by Arkane Studios, a puzzle RPG \"\" developed by \"Capybara Games\", and the mobile strategy RPG titled \"Might &amp; Magic: Elemental Guardians\".\nGameplay.\nThe majority of the gameplay takes place in medieval fantasy settings, while later sections of the games are often based on science fiction tropes, the transition often serving as a plot twist. The player controls a party of player characters, which can consist of members of various character classes. The game world is presented to the player in first person perspective. In the earlier games the interface is very similar to that of \"Bard's Tale\", but from \"\" onward, the interface features a three-dimensional environment. Combat is turn-based, though the later games allowed the player to choose to conduct combat in real time.\nThe game worlds in all of the Might and Magic games are quite large, and a player can expect each game to provide several dozen hours of gameplay. It is usually quite combat-intensive and often involves large groups of enemy creatures. Monsters and situations encountered throughout the series tend to be well-known fantasy staples such as giant rats, werewolf curses, dragon flights and zombie hordes, rather than original creations. \"Isles of Terra\" and the \"Xeen\" games featured a more distinct environment, blending fantasy and science fiction elements in a unique way.\nThe \"Might and Magic\" games have some replay value as the player can choose their party composition, develop different skills, choose sides, do quests in a different order, hunt for hidden secrets and easter eggs, and/or change difficulty level.\nPlot.\nAlthough most of the gameplay reflects a distinctly fantasy genre, the overarching plot of the first nine games has a science fiction background. The series is set in a fictional galaxy as part of an alternative universe, where planets are overseen by a powerful race of space travelers known as Ancients who seeded them with humans, elves, dwarves, goblins and others. In each of the games, a party of characters fights monsters and completes quests on one of these planets, until they eventually become involved in the affairs of the Ancients. As such, \"Might and Magic\" is an example of science fantasy.\nThe producer of the series was Jon Van Caneghem. Van Caneghem has stated in interview that the \"Might and Magic\" setting is inspired by his love for both science fiction and fantasy. He cites \"The Twilight Zone\" and the \"Star Trek\" episode \"For the World is Hollow and I Have Touched the Sky\" as having inspired \"Might and Magic\" lore.\nThe first five games in the series concern the renegade android Sheltem created by the Ancients to be the Guardian of the planet Terra, who becomes irrevocably corrupted, developing a penchant for throwing worlds into suns to sabotage the Ancients' Great Experiment, as his faulty programming views them as a threat to Terra. Sheltem establishes himself on a series of flat worlds known as nacelles (which are carried inside giant spaceships) and Corak, a second Guardian and creation of the Ancients, pursues him across the Void with the assistance of the player characters. Eventually both Corak and Sheltem are destroyed in a climactic battle on the nacelle world of Xeen.\nThe sixth, seventh and eighth games take place on Enroth, a single planet where a large continent also named Enroth is ruled by the Ironfist dynasty, and chronicle the events and aftermath of an invasion by the Kreegan (colloquially referred to as \"devils\"), the demon-like archenemies of the Ancients. It is also revealed that the destruction wrought by the Ancients' wars with the Kreegan is the reason why the worlds of \"Might and Magic\" exist as medieval fantasy settings despite once being seeded with futuristic technology \u2013 the worlds have been 'cut off' from the Ancients and descended into barbarism. The first through third games in the \"Heroes of Might and Magic\" series trace the fortunes of the Ironfists in more detail. None of the science fiction elements appear in the \"Heroes\" series besides the appearance of Kreegan characters in \"Heroes of Might and Magic III\" and \"IV\". \"Might and Magic IX\" and \"Heroes IV\" take place on Axeoth, another planet which the survivors of Enroth were brought to through portals after it was destroyed in an event called the Reckoning.\nThe Ubisoft release ' departs from this continuity and is set in the world of Ashan, a separate setting established by Ubisoft in \"Heroes of Might and Magic V\" and subsequent \"Heroes\" games after New World Computing went out of business. Ashan is a high fantasy setting with no science fiction elements in its lore. The original setting remained abandoned until the 2025 game ', a prequel taking place on Enroth's continent Jadame, which was first featured in \"\".\nReception.\n\"Might and Magic\" is considered one of the defining examples of early role-playing video games, along with \"The Bard's Tale\", \"Ultima\" and \"Wizardry\" series. By March 1994, combined sales of the \"Might and Magic\" series totaled 1 million units. The number rose to 2.5 million sales by November 1996. and 4 million by March 1999.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It allows streaming of audio and video, and can capture mouse, keyboard, microphone, and camera input.\nArtists may produce Flash graphics and animations using Adobe Animate (formerly known as Adobe Flash Professional). Software developers may produce applications and video games using Adobe Flash Builder, FlashDevelop, Flash Catalyst, or any text editor combined with the Apache Flex SDK. End users view Flash content via Flash Player (for web browsers), Adobe AIR (for desktop or mobile apps), or third-party players such as Scaleform (for video games). Adobe Flash Player (which is available on Microsoft Windows, macOS, and Linux) enables end users to view Flash content using web browsers. Adobe Flash Lite enabled viewing Flash content on older smartphones, but since has been discontinued and superseded by Adobe AIR.\nThe ActionScript programming language allows the development of interactive animations, video games, web applications, desktop applications, and mobile applications. Programmers can implement Flash software using an IDE such as Adobe Animate, Adobe Flash Builder, Adobe Director, FlashDevelop, and Powerflasher FDT. Adobe AIR enables full-featured desktop and mobile applications to be developed with Flash and published for Windows, macOS, Android, iOS, Xbox One, PlayStation 4, Wii U, and Nintendo Switch.\nFlash was initially used to create fully-interactive websites, but this approach was phased out with the introduction of HTML5. Instead, Flash found a niche as the dominant platform for online multimedia content, particularly for browser games. Following an open letter written by Steve Jobs in 2010 stating that he would not approve the use of Flash on Apple's iOS devices due to numerous security flaws, use of Flash declined as Adobe transitioned to the Adobe AIR platform. The Flash Player was deprecated in 2017 and officially discontinued at the end of 2020 for all users outside mainland China as well as non-enterprise users, with many web browsers and operating systems scheduled to remove the Flash Player software around the same time. Adobe continues to develop Adobe Animate, which supports web standards such as HTML5 instead of the Flash format.\nApplications.\nWebsites.\nIn the early 2000s, Flash was widely installed on desktop computers, and was often used to display interactive web pages and online games, and to play video and audio content. In 2005, YouTube was founded by former PayPal employees, and it used Adobe Flash Player as a means to display compressed video content on the web.\nBetween 2000 and 2010, numerous businesses used Flash-based websites to launch new products or to create interactive company portals. Notable users include Nike, Hewlett-Packard (now HP Inc.), Nokia, General Electric, World Wildlife Fund, HBO, Cartoon Network, Disney, and Motorola. After Adobe introduced hardware-accelerated 3D for Flash (Stage3D), Flash websites saw a growth of 3D content for product demonstrations and virtual tours.\nIn 2007, YouTube offered videos in HTML5 format to support the iPhone and iPad, which did not support Flash Player. After a controversy with Apple, Adobe stopped developing Flash Player for Mobile, focusing its efforts on Adobe AIR applications and HTML5 animation. In 2015, Google introduced Google Swiffy, a tool that converted Flash animation to HTML5, which Google used to automatically convert Flash web ads for mobile devices. In 2016, Google discontinued Swiffy and its support. In 2015, YouTube switched to HTML5 technology on most devices by default;. However, YouTube supported the Flash-based video player for older web browsers and devices until 2017.\nRich Internet Applications.\nAfter Flash 5 introduced ActionScript in 2000, developers combined the visual and programming capabilities of Flash to produce interactive experiences and applications for the Web. Such Web-based applications eventually became known as \"Rich Internet Applications\" and later \"Rich Web Applications\".\nIn 2004, Macromedia Flex was released, and specifically targeted the application development market. Flex introduced new user interface components, advanced data visualization components, data remoting, and a modern IDE (Flash Builder). Flex competed with Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX) and Microsoft Silverlight during its tenure. Flex was upgraded to support integration with remote data sources, using AMF, BlazeDS, Adobe LiveCycle, Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud, and others.\nBetween 2006 and 2016, the Speedtest.net web service conducted over 9.0 billion speed tests with a utility built with Adobe Flash. In 2016, the service shifted to HTML5 due to the decreasing availability of Adobe Flash Player on PCs.\nDevelopers could create rich internet applications and browser plugin-based applets in ActionScript 3.0 programming language with IDEs, including Adobe Flash Builder, FlashDevelop, and Powerflasher FDT. Flex applications were typically built using Flex frameworks such as PureMVC.\nVideo games.\nFlash video games were popular on the Internet, with portals like Newgrounds, Kongregate, and Armor Games dedicated to hosting Flash-based games. Many Flash games were developed by individuals or groups of friends due to the simplicity of the software. Popular Flash games include \"Farmville, Alien Hominid, QWOP\", \"Club Penguin\", and \"Dofus\".\nAdobe introduced various technologies to help build video games, including Adobe AIR (to release games for desktop or mobile platforms), Adobe Scout (to improve performance), CrossBridge (to convert C++-based games to run in Flash), and Stage3D (to support GPU-accelerated video games). 3D frameworks like Away3D and Flare3D simplified creation of 3D content for Flash.\nAdobe AIR allows the creation of Flash-based mobile games, which may be published to the Google Play and Apple app stores.\nFlash is also used to build interfaces and HUDs for 3D video games using Scaleform GFx, a technology that renders Flash content within non-Flash video games. Scaleform is supported by more than 10 major video game engines, including Unreal Engine 3, CryEngine, and PhyreEngine, and has been used to provide 3D interfaces for more than 150 major video game titles since its launch in 2003.\nFilm and animation.\nNotable users of Flash include DHX Media Vancouver for productions including \"Pound Puppies, Littlest Pet Shop and\" ', Fresh TV for \"Total Drama\", Nelvana for \"6teen\" and \"Clone High\", Williams Street for \"Metalocalypse\" and \"Squidbillies\", Nickelodeon Animation Studio for ', Starz Media for \"Wow! Wow! Wubbzy!\", Ankama Animation for \"\", among others.\nHistory.\nFutureWave.\nThe precursor to Flash was SmartSketch, a product published by FutureWave Software in 1993. The company was founded by Charlie Jackson, Jonathan Gay, and Michelle Alsip-Welsh. SmartSketch was a vector drawing application for pen computers running the PenPoint OS. When PenPoint failed in the marketplace, SmartSketch was ported to Microsoft Windows and Mac OS.\nAs the Internet became more popular, FutureWave realized the potential for a vector-based web animation tool that might challenge Macromedia Shockwave technology. In 1995, FutureWave modified SmartSketch by adding frame-by-frame animation features and released this new product as FutureSplash Animator on Macintosh and PC.\nFutureWave approached Adobe Systems with an offer to sell them FutureSplash in 1995, but Adobe turned down the offer at that time. Microsoft wanted to create an \"online TV network\" (MSN 2.0) and adopted FutureSplash animated content as a central part of it. Disney Online used FutureSplash animations for their subscription-based service Disney's Daily Blast. Fox Broadcasting Company launched \"The Simpsons\" using FutureSplash.\nMacromedia.\nIn December 1996, FutureSplash was acquired by Macromedia, and Macromedia re-branded and released \"FutureSplash Animator\" as \"Macromedia Flash 1.0\". Flash was a two-part system, a graphics and animation editor known as Macromedia Flash, and a player known as Macromedia Flash Player.\n\"FutureSplash Animator\" was an animation tool originally developed for pen-based computing devices. Due to the small size of the \"FutureSplash Viewer\", it was particularly suited for download on the Web. Macromedia distributed Flash Player as a free browser plugin to quickly gain market share. By 2005, more computers worldwide had Flash Player installed than any other Web media format, including Java, QuickTime, RealNetworks, and Windows Media Player.\nMacromedia upgraded the Flash system between 1996 and 1999, adding MovieClips, Actions (the precursor to ActionScript), Alpha transparency, and other features. As Flash matured, Macromedia's focus shifted from marketing it as a graphics and media tool to promoting it as a Web application platform, adding scripting and data access capabilities to the player while attempting to retain its small footprint.\nIn 2000, the first major version of ActionScript was developed and released with \"Flash 5\". ActionScript 2.0 was released with \"Flash MX 2004\" and supported object-oriented programming, improved UI components, and other programming features. The last version of Flash released by Macromedia was \"Flash 8\", which focused on graphical upgrades such as filters (blur, drop shadow, etc.), blend modes (similar to Adobe Photoshop), and advanced features for FLV video.\nAdobe.\nOn December 3, 2005, Adobe Systems acquired Macromedia alongside its product line which included Flash, Dreamweaver, Director/Shockwave, Fireworks, and Authorware.\nIn 2007, Adobe's first version release was \"Adobe Flash CS3 Professional\", the ninth major version of Flash. It introduced the ActionScript 3.0 programming language, which supported modern programming practices and enabled business applications to be developed with Flash. Adobe Flex Builder (built on Eclipse) targeted the enterprise application development market, and was also released the same year. Flex Builder included the Flex SDK, a set of components that included charting, advanced UI, and data services (\"Flex Data Services\").\nIn 2008, Adobe released the tenth version of Flash, \"Adobe Flash CS4\". Flash 10 improved animation capabilities within the Flash Editor, adding a motion editor panel. (similar to Adobe After Effects), inverse kinematics (bones), basic 3D object animation, object-based animation, and other text and graphics features. \"Flash Player 10\" included an in-built 3D engine (without GPU acceleration) that allowed basic object transformations in 3D space (position, rotation, scaling).\nAlso in 2008, Adobe released the first version of Adobe Integrated Runtime (later re-branded as \"Adobe AIR\"), a runtime engine that replaced Flash Player, and provided additional capabilities to the ActionScript 3.0 language to build desktop and mobile applications. With AIR, developers could access the file system (the user's files and folders), and connected devices such as a joystick, gamepad, and sensors for the first time.\nIn 2011, \"Adobe Flash Player 11\" was released, and with it the first version of Stage3D, allowing GPU-accelerated 3D rendering for Flash applications and games on desktop platforms such as Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X. Adobe further improved 3D capabilities from 2011 to 2013, adding support for 3D rendering on Android and iOS platforms, alpha-channels, compressed textures, texture atlases, and other features. Adobe AIR was upgraded to support 64-bit computers, and to allow developers to add additional functionality to the AIR runtime using \"AIR Native Extensions\" (ANE).\nIn May 2014, Adobe announced that Adobe AIR was used in over 100,000 unique applications and had over 1 billion installations logged worldwide. Adobe AIR was voted the \"Best Mobile Application Development\" product at the Consumer Electronics Show on two consecutive years (CES 2014 and CES 2015).\nIn 2016, Adobe renamed Flash Professional, the primary authoring software for Flash content, to Adobe Animate to reflect its growing use for authoring HTML5 content in favor of Flash content.\nOpen Source.\nAdobe has taken steps to reduce or eliminate Flash licensing costs. For instance, the SWF file format documentation is provided free of charge after they relaxed the requirement of accepting a non-disclosure agreement to view it in 2008. Adobe also created the Open Screen Project, which removes licensing fees and opens data protocols for Flash.\nAdobe has also open-sourced many components relating to Flash.\nAdobe has not been willing to make complete source code of the Flash Player available for free software development and even though free and open source alternatives such as Shumway and Gnash have been built, they are no longer under active development.\nOpen Screen Project.\nOn May 1, 2008, Adobe announced the \"Open Screen Project\", with the intent of providing a consistent application interface across devices such as personal computers, mobile devices, and consumer electronics. When the project was announced, seven goals were outlined: the abolition of licensing fees for Adobe Flash Player and Adobe AIR, the removal of restrictions on the use of the Shockwave Flash (SWF) and Flash Video (FLV) file formats, the publishing of application programming interfaces for porting Flash to new devices, and the publishing of The Flash Cast protocol and Action Message Format (AMF), which let Flash applications receive information from remote databases.\nAs of February 2009[ [update]], the specifications removing the restrictions on the use of SWF and FLV/F4V specs have been published. The Flash Cast protocol\u2014now known as the Mobile Content Delivery Protocol\u2014and AMF protocols have also been made available, with AMF available as an open source implementation, BlazeDS.\nThe list of mobile device providers who have joined the project includes Palm, Motorola, and Nokia, who, together with Adobe, have announced a $10 million Open Screen Project fund.\nEnd of life.\nOne of Flash's primary uses on the Internet when it was first released was for building fully immersive, interactive websites. These were typically highly creative site designs that provided more flexibility over what the current HTML standards could provide, as well as operate over dial-up connections. However, these sites limited accessibility by \"breaking the Back Button\", dumping visitors out of the Flash experience entirely by returning them to whatever page they had been on before first arriving at the site. Fully Flash-run sites fell out of favor for more strategic use of Flash plugins for video and other interactive features among standard HTML conventions, corresponding with the availability of HTML features like cascading style-sheets in the mid-00's. At the same time, this also led to Flash being used for new apps, including video games and animations. Precursors to YouTube featuring user-generated Flash animations and games such as Newgrounds became popular destinations, further helping to spread the use of Flash.\nToward the end of the millennium, the Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) was released, corresponding with the development of Dynamic HTML. Fifteen years later, WAP had largely been replaced by full-capability implementations, and the HTML5 standard included more support for interactive and video elements. Support for Flash in these mobile browsers was not included. In 2010, Apple's Steve Jobs famously wrote \"Thoughts on Flash\", an open letter to Adobe criticizing the closed nature of the Flash platform and the inherent security problems with the application to explain why Flash was not supported on iOS. Adobe created the Adobe AIR environment as a means to appease Apple's concerns, and spent time legally fighting Apple over terms of its App Store to allow AIR to be used on iOS. While Adobe eventually won, allowing for other third-party development environments to get access to the iOS, Apple's decision to block Flash itself was considered the \"death blow\" to the Flash application. In November 2011, about a year after Jobs' open letter, Adobe announced it would no longer be developing Flash and advised developers to switch to HTML5.\nIn 2011, Adobe ended support for Flash on Android. Adobe stated that Flash platform was transitioning to Adobe AIR and OpenFL, a multi-target open-source implementation of the Flash API. In 2015, Adobe rebranded Flash Professional, the main Flash authoring environment, as Adobe Animate to emphasize its expanded support for HTML5 authoring, and stated that it would \"encourage content creators to build with new web standards\" rather than use Flash.\nIn July 2017, Adobe deprecated Flash, and announced its End-Of-Life (EOL) at the end of 2020, and will cease support, distribution, and security updates for Flash Player.\nWith Flash's EOL announced, many browsers took steps to gradually restrict Flash content (cautioning users before launching it, eventually blocking all content without an option to play it). By January 2021, all major browsers were blocking all Flash content unconditionally. Only IE11, niche browser forks, and some browsers built for China plan to continue support. Furthermore, excluding the China variant of Flash, Flash execution software has a built-in kill switch that prevents it from playing Flash after January 12, 2021. In January 2021, Microsoft released an optional update KB4577586 which removes Flash Player from Windows; in July 2021 this update was pushed out as a security update and applied automatically to all remaining systems.\nPost EOL support.\nAdobe Flash will still be supported in China and worldwide on some specialized enterprise platforms beyond 2020.\nContent preservation projects.\nAs early as 2014, around the same time that Adobe began encouraging Flash developers to transition their works to HTML5 standards, others began efforts to preserve existing Flash content through emulation of Flash in open standards. While some Flash applications were utilitarian, several applications were experimental art, while others had laid the foundation of independent video game development. An early project was Mozilla's Shumway, an open source project that attempted to emulate the Flash standard in HTML5, but the project was shuttered as the team found that more developers were switching to HTML5 than seeking to keep their content in Flash, coupled with the difficulties in assuring full compatibility. Google had developed the Swiffy application, released in 2014, to convert Flash applications to HTML5-compatible scripts for viewing on mobile devices, but it was shut down in 2016.\nCloser to Flash's EOL date in 2020, there were more concentrated efforts simply to preserve existing Flash applications, including websites, video games, and animations beyond Flash's EOL. In November 2020, the Internet Archive integrated Ruffle within its Emularity system to emulate Flash games and animations without the security holes, opening a new collection for creators and users to save and preserve Flash content. By October 2023, the Flashpoint Archive had collected more than 160,000 Flash applications, excluding those that were commercial products, and offered as a freely available archive for users to download. Kongregate, one of the larger sites that offered Flash games, has been working with the Strong Museum of Play to preserve its games.\nFormat.\nFLA.\nFlash source files are in the FLA format and contain graphics and animation, as well as embedded assets such as bitmap images, audio files, and FLV video files. The Flash source file format was a proprietary format, and Adobe Animate and Adobe Flash Pro were the only available authoring tools capable of editing such files. Flash source files (.fla) may be compiled into Flash movie files (.swf) using Adobe Animate. Note that FLA files can be edited, but output (.swf) files cannot.\nSWF.\nFlash movie files were in the \"SWF\" format, traditionally called \"ShockWave Flash\" movies, \"Flash movies\", or \"Flash applications\", usually have a .swf file extension, and may be used in the form of a web page plug-in, strictly \"played\" in a standalone Flash Player, or incorporated into a self-executing Projector movie (with the .exe extension in Microsoft Windows). Flash Video files have a .flv file extension. And are either used from within .swf files or played through a flv-aware player, such as VLC or QuickTime and Windows Media Player with external codecs added.\nThe use of vector graphics combined with program code allows Flash files to be smaller\u2014and thus allows streams to use less bandwidth\u2014than the corresponding bitmaps or video clips. For content in a single format (such as just text, video, or audio), other alternatives may provide better performance and consume less CPU power than the corresponding Flash movie, for example, when using transparency or making large screen updates such as photographic or text fades.\nIn addition to a vector-rendering engine, the Flash Player includes a virtual machine called the ActionScript Virtual Machine (AVM) for scripting interactivity at run-time, with video, MP3-based audio, and bitmap graphics. As of Flash Player 8, it offered two video codecs: On2 Technologies VP6 and Sorenson Spark, and run-time JPEG, Progressive JPEG, PNG, GIF and (DWG) AutoCAD Drawing file (WMV) Windows Metafile capability.\n3D.\nFlash Player 11 introduced a full 3D shader API, called Stage3D, which is fairly similar to WebGL. Stage3D enables GPU-accelerated rendering of 3D graphics within Flash games and applications, and has been used to build \"Angry Birds\", and a couple of other notable games.\nVarious 3D frameworks have been built for Flash using Stage3D, such as Away3D 4, CopperCube, Flare3D, and Starling. Professional game engines like Unreal Engine and Unity also export Flash versions which use Stage3D to render 3D graphics.\nFlash Video.\nVirtually all browser plugins for video are free of charge and cross-platform, including Adobe's offering of Flash Video, which was introduced with Flash version 6. Flash Video had been a popular choice for websites due to the large installed user base and programmability of Flash. In 2010, Apple publicly criticized Adobe Flash, including its implementation of video playback, for not taking advantage of hardware acceleration, one reason Flash was not found on Apple's mobile devices. Soon after Apple's criticism, Adobe demoed and released a beta version of Flash 10.1, which used available GPU hardware acceleration even on a Mac. Flash 10.2 beta, released December 2010, added hardware acceleration for the whole video rendering pipeline.\nFlash Player supports two distinct modes of video playback, and hardware-accelerated video decoding may not be used for older video content. Such content causes excessive CPU usage compared to comparable content played with other players.\nSoftware Rendered Video: Flash Player supports software-rendered video since version 6. Such a video supports vector animations displayed above the video content. This obligation may, depending on graphic APIs exposed by the operating system, prohibit using a video overlay, like a traditional multimedia player would use, with the consequence that color space conversion and scaling must happen in software.\nIn tests done by Ars Technica in 2008 and 2009, Adobe Flash Player performed better on Windows than Mac OS X and Linux with the same hardware.\nPerformance has later improved for the latter two, on Mac OS X with Flash Player 10.1, and on Linux with Flash Player 11.\nFlash Audio.\nFlash Audio is most commonly encoded in MP3; however, it can also use ADPCM (an IMA ADPCM variation that can use 2, 3, 4, or 5 bits per sample), Nellymoser (Nellymoser Asao Codec) and Speex audio codecs. Flash allows sample rates of 5512, 11025, 22050, and 44100\u00a0Hz (but Speex uses 16\u00a0kHz and Nellymoser Asao can also use 8\u00a0kHz and 16\u00a0kHz). It cannot have a 48\u00a0kHz audio sample rate, which is the standard TV and DVD sample rate.\nOn August 20, 2007, Adobe announced on its blog that with Update 3 of Flash Player 9, Flash Video will also implement some parts of the MPEG-4 international standards. Specifically, Flash Player will work with video compressed in H.264 (MPEG-4 Part 10), audio compressed using AAC (MPEG-4 Part 3), the F4V, MP4 (MPEG-4 Part 14), M4V, M4A, 3GP, and MOV multimedia container formats, 3GPP Timed Text specification (MPEG-4 Part 17), which is a standardized subtitle format and partial parsing capability for the \"ilst\" atom, which is the ID3 equivalent iTunes uses to store metadata. MPEG-4 Part 2 and H.263 will not work in F4V file format. Adobe also announced that it will be gradually moving away from the FLV format to the standard ISO base media file format (MPEG-4 Part 12) owing to functional limits with the FLV structure when streaming H.264. The final release of the Flash Player, implementing some parts of the MPEG-4 standards had become available in Fall 2007.\nAdobe Flash Player 10.1 does not have acoustic echo cancellation, unlike the VoIP offerings of Skype and Google Voice, making this and earlier versions of Flash less suitable for group calling or meetings. Flash Player 10.3 Beta incorporates acoustic echo cancellation.\nActionScript.\nFlash programs use \"ActionScript\" programming language. It is an enhanced superset of the ECMAScript programming language, with a classical Java-style class model, rather than JavaScript's prototype model.\nSpecifications.\nIn October 1998, Macromedia disclosed the Flash Version 3 Specification on its website. It did this in response to many new and often semi-open formats competing with SWF, such as Xara's Flare and Sharp's Extended Vector Animation formats. Several developers quickly created a C library for producing SWF. In February 1999, MorphInk 99 was introduced, the first third-party program to create SWF files. Macromedia also hired Middlesoft to create a freely available developers' kit for the SWF file format versions 3 to 5.\nMacromedia made the Flash Files specifications for versions 6 and later available only under a non-disclosure agreement, but they are widely available from various sites.\nIn April 2006, the Flash SWF file format specification was released with details on the then newest version format (Flash 8). Although still lacking specific information on the incorporated video compression formats (On2, Sorenson Spark, etc.), this new documentation covered all the new features offered in Flash v8, including new ActionScript commands, expressive filter controls, and so on. The file format specification document is offered only to developers who agree to a license agreement that permits them to use the specifications only to develop programs that can export to the Flash file format. The license does not allow the use of the specifications to create programs that can be used for the playback of Flash files. The Flash 9 specification was made available under similar restrictions.\nIn June 2009, Adobe launched the Open Screen Project (https://), which made the SWF specification available without restrictions. Previously, developers could not use the specification for making SWF-compatible players, but only for making SWF-exporting authoring software. The specification still omits information on codecs such as Sorenson Spark, however.\nAnimation tools.\nOfficial tools.\nThe Adobe Animate authoring program is primarily used to design graphics and animation and publish the same for websites, web applications, and video games. The program also offers limited support for audio and video embedding and ActionScript scripting.\nAdobe released Adobe LiveMotion, designed to create interactive animation content and export it to a variety of formats, including SWF. LiveMotion failed to gain any notable user base.\nIn February 2003, Macromedia purchased Presedia, which had developed a Flash authoring tool that automatically converted PowerPoint files into Flash. Macromedia subsequently released the new product as Breeze, which included many new enhancements.\nThird-party tools.\nVarious free and commercial software packages can output animations into the Flash SWF format, including:\nThe Flash 4 Linux project was an initiative to develop an open source Linux application as an alternative to Adobe Animate. Development plans included authoring capacity for 2D animation, and tweening, as well as outputting SWF file formats. F4L evolved into an editor that was capable of authoring 2D animation and publishing SWF files. Flash 4 Linux was renamed UIRA. UIRA intended to combine the resources and knowledge of the F4L project and the Qflash project, both of which were open-source applications that aimed to provide an alternative to the proprietary Adobe Flash.\nProgramming tools.\nOfficial tools.\nAdobe provides a series of tools to develop software applications and video games for Flash:\nThird-party tools.\nThird-party development tools have been created to assist developers in creating software applications and video games with Flash.\nPlayers.\nProprietary.\nAdobe Flash Player is the multimedia and application player originally developed by Macromedia and acquired by Adobe Systems. It plays SWF files, which can be created by Adobe Animate, Apache Flex, or several other Adobe Systems and 3rd party tools. It has support for a scripting language called ActionScript, which can be used to display Flash Video from an SWF file.\nScaleform GFx is a commercial alternative Flash player that features fully hardware-accelerated 2D graphics rendering using the GPU. Scaleform has high conformance with both Flash 10 ActionScript 3 and Flash 8 ActionScript 2. Scaleform GFx is a game development middleware solution that helps create graphical user interfaces or HUDs within 3D video games. It does not work with web browsers.\nIrfanView, an image viewer, uses Flash Player to display SWF files.\nOpen source.\nOpenFL, a cross-platform open-source implementation of the Adobe Flash API, supports importing SWF assets.\nLightspark is a free and open-source SWF player that supports most of ActionScript 3.0 and has a Mozilla-compatible plug-in. It will fall back on Gnash, a free SWF player supporting ActionScript 1.0 and 2.0 (AVM1) code. Lightspark supports OpenGL-based rendering for 3D content. The player is also compatible with H.264 Flash videos on YouTube.\nGnash aimed to create a software player and browser plugin replacement for the Adobe Flash Player. Gnash can play SWF files up to version 7, and 80% of ActionScript 2.0. Gnash runs on Windows, Linux and other platforms for the 32-bit, 64-bit, and other operating systems, but development has slowed significantly in recent years.\nShumway was an open source Flash Player released by Mozilla in November 2012. It was built in JavaScript and is thus compatible with modern web browsers. In early October 2013, Shumway was included by default in the Firefox nightly branch. Shumway rendered Flash contents by translating contents inside Flash files to HTML5 elements, and running an ActionScript interpreter in JavaScript. It supported both AVM1 and AVM2, and ActionScript versions 1, 2, and 3. Development of Shumway ceased in early 2016.\nIn the same year that Shumway was abandoned, work began on Ruffle, a Flash emulator written in Rust. It also runs in web browsers, by compiling down to WebAssembly and using HTML5 Canvas. In 2020, the Internet Archive added support for emulating SWF by adding Ruffle to its emulation scheme. As of March 2023, Ruffle states that it supports 95% of the AS1/2 language and 73% of the AS1/2 APIs, but does not correctly run most AS3 (AVM2) applications.\nAvailability.\nDesktop computers.\nAdobe Flash Player.\nAdobe Flash Player is currently only supported with the enterprise and China variants, it has been deprecated everywhere else.\nAdobe Flash Player is available in four flavors:\nThe \"ActiveX\" version is an ActiveX control for use in Internet Explorer and any other Windows applications that support ActiveX technology. The \"Plug-in\" versions are available for browsers supporting either NPAPI or PPAPI plug-ins on Microsoft Windows, macOS, and Linux. The \"projector\" version is a standalone player that can open SWF files directly.\nAdobe AIR.\nAdobe AIR shares some code with Adobe Flash Player and essentially embeds it.\nMobile devices.\nAdobe Flash Player.\nAdobe Flash Player was previously available for a variety of mobile operating systems, including Android (between versions 2.2 and 4.0.4)., Pocket PC/Windows CE, QNX (e.g., on BlackBerry PlayBook), Symbian, Palm OS, and webOS (since version 2.0). Flash Player for smartphones was originally made available to handset manufacturers at the end of 2009. In November 2011, Adobe announced the withdrawal of support for Flash Player on mobile devices.\nIn 2011, Adobe reaffirmed its commitment to \"aggressively contribute\" to HTML5. Adobe announced the end of Flash for mobile platforms or TV, instead focusing on HTML5 for browser content and Adobe AIR for the various mobile application stores and described it as \"the beginning of the end\". BlackBerry LTD (formerly known as RIM) announced that it would continue to develop Flash Player for the PlayBook.\nThere is no Adobe Flash Player for iOS devices (iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch). However, Flash content can be made to run on iOS devices in a variety of ways:\nThe mobile version of Internet Explorer for Windows Phone cannot play Flash content; however, Flash support is still present on the tablet version of Windows.\nAdobe AIR.\nAIR is a cross-platform runtime system for developing applications for mobile devices running Android (ARM Cortex-A8 and above) and Apple iOS.\nAdobe Flash Lite.\nAdobe Flash Lite is a lightweight version of Adobe Flash Player intended for mobile phones and other portable electronic devices like Chumby and iRiver.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;Alternatives on the web.\nFor a list of non-web alternative players, see .\nOpenFL.\nOpenFL is an open-source software framework that mirrors the Adobe Flash API. It allows developers to build a single application against the OpenFL APIs, and simultaneously target multiple platforms including iOS, Android, HTML5 (choice of Canvas, WebGL, SVG or DOM), Windows, macOS, Linux, WebAssembly, Flash, AIR, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3, PlayStation Vita, Xbox One, Wii U, TiVo, Raspberry Pi, and Node.js. OpenFL mirrors the Flash API for graphical operations. OpenFL applications can be written in Haxe, JavaScript (EcmaScript 5 or 6+), or TypeScript.\nMore than 500 video games have been developed with OpenFL, including the BAFTA-award-winning game \"Papers, Please\", Rymdkapsel, Lightbot, and Madden NFL Mobile.\nHTML5.\nHTML5 is often cited as an alternative to Adobe Flash technology usage on web pages. Adobe released a tool that converts Flash to HTML5, and in June 2011, Google released an experimental tool that does the same. In January 2015, YouTube defaulted to HTML5 players to better support more devices.\nFlash to HTML5.\nThe following tools allow converting Flash content to HTML5:\nThe following tools run Flash content in an HTML5-enabled browser but do not convert to an HTML5 webpage:\nCriticisms.\nMobile support.\nWebsites built with Adobe Flash will not function on most modern mobile devices running Google Android or iOS (iPhone, iPad). The only alternative is using HTML5 and responsive web design to build websites that support both desktop and mobile devices.\nHowever, Flash is still used to build mobile games using Adobe AIR. Such games will not work in mobile web browsers but must be installed via the appropriate app store.\nVendor lock-in.\nThe reliance on Adobe for decoding Flash made its use on the World Wide Web a concern\u2014the completeness of its public specifications is debated, and no complete implementation of Flash is publicly available in source code form with a license that permits reuse. Generally, public specifications are what make a format re-implementable (see future proofing data storage), and reusable codebases can be ported to new platforms without the endorsement of the format creator.\nAdobe's restrictions on the use of the SWF/FLV specifications were lifted in February 2009 (see Adobe's Open Screen Project). However, despite efforts of projects like Gnash, Swfdec, and Lightspark, a complete free Flash player is yet to be seen, as of September 2011. For example, Gnash cannot use SWF v10 yet. Notably, Gnash was listed on the Free Software Foundation's high priority list, from at least 2007, to its removal in January 2017.\nNotable advocates of free software, open standards, and the World Wide Web have warned against the use of Flash:\nThe founder of Mozilla Europe, Tristan Nitot, stated in 2008:\nCompanies building websites should beware of proprietary rich-media technologies like Adobe's Flash and Microsoft's Silverlight. (...) You're producing content for your users and there's someone in the middle deciding whether users should see your content.\nRepresenting open standards, inventor of CSS and co-author of HTML5, H\u00e5kon Wium Lie explained in a Google tech talk of 2007, entitled \"the &lt;video&gt; element\", the proposal of Theora as the format for HTML video:\nI believe very strongly that we need to agree on some kind of baseline video format if [the video element] is going to succeed. Flash is today the baseline format on the web. The problem with Flash is that it's not an open standard.\nRepresenting the free software movement, Richard Stallman stated in a speech in 2004 that: \"The use of Flash in websites is a major problem for our community.\"\nAccessibility and usability.\nUsability consultant Jakob Nielsen published an Alertbox in 2000 entitled, \"Flash: 99% Bad\", stating that \"Flash tends to degrade websites for three reasons: it encourages design abuse, it breaks with the Web's fundamental interaction principles, and it distracts attention from the site's core value.\" Some problems have been at least partially fixed since Nielsen's complaints: text size can be controlled using full page zoom and it has been possible for authors to include alternative text in Flash since Flash Player 6.\nFlash blocking in web browsers.\nFlash content is usually embedded using the codice_1 or codice_2 HTML element. A web browser that does not fully implement one of these elements displays the replacement text, if supplied by the web page. Often, a plugin is required for the browser to fully implement these elements, though some users cannot or will not install it.\nSince Flash can be used to produce content (such as advertisements) that some users find obnoxious or take a large amount of bandwidth to download, some web browsers, by default, do not play Flash content until the user clicks on it, e.g., Konqueror, K-Meleon.\nMost current browsers have a feature to block plugins, playing one only when the user clicks it. Opera versions since 10.5 feature native Flash blocking. Opera Turbo requires the user to click to play Flash content, and the browser also allows the user to enable this option permanently. Both Chrome and Firefox have an option to enable \"click to play plugins\". Equivalent \"Flash blocker\" extensions are also available for many popular browsers: Firefox has Flashblock and NoScript, Internet Explorer has Foxie, which contains several features, one of them named Flashblock. WebKit-based browsers under macOS, such as Apple's Safari, have ClickToFlash. In June 2015, Google announced that Chrome will \"pause\" advertisements and \"non-central\" Flash content by default.\nFirefox (from version 46) rewrites old Flash-only YouTube embed code into YouTube's modern embedded player that is capable of using either HTML video or Flash. Such embed code is used by non-YouTube sites to embed YouTube's videos, and can still be encountered, for example, on old blogs and forums.\nHowever, there are ways to pass this error in the absence of Flash Player by deleting the validation code in HTML. This also depends on browser vision.\nSecurity.\nFor many years, Adobe Flash Player's security record has led many security experts to recommend against installing the player, or to block Flash content. The US-CERT has recommended blocking Flash, and security researcher Charlie Miller recommended \"not to install Flash\"; however, for people still using Flash, Intego recommended that users get trusted updates \"only directly from the vendor that publishes them.\" Adobe Flash Player has over 1078 CVE entries, of which over 842 lead to arbitrary code execution, and past vulnerabilities have enabled spying via web cameras. Security experts have long predicted the demise of Flash, saying that with the rise of HTML5 \"...the need for browser plugins such as Flash is diminishing\".\nActive moves by third parties to limit the risk began with Steve Jobs in 2010, saying that Apple would not allow Flash on the iPhone, iPod Touch, and iPad, citing abysmal security as one reason. Flash often used the ability to dynamically change parts of the runtime on languages on OSX to improve their own performance, but caused general instability. In July 2015, a series of newly discovered vulnerabilities resulted in Facebook's chief security officer, Alex Stamos, issuing a call to Adobe to discontinue the software entirely and the Mozilla Firefox web browser, Google Chrome, and Apple Safari to blacklist all earlier versions of Flash Player.\nFlash cookies.\nLike the HTTP cookie, a flash cookie (also known as a \"Local Shared Object\") can be used to save application data. Flash cookies are not shared across domains. An August 2009 study by the Ashkan Soltani and a team of researchers at UC Berkeley found that 50% of websites using Flash were also employing Flash cookies, yet privacy policies rarely disclosed them, and user controls for privacy preferences were lacking. Most browsers' cache and history suppress or delete functions did not affect Flash Player's writing Local Shared Objects to its own cache in version 10.2 and earlier, at which point the user community was much less aware of the existence and function of Flash cookies than HTTP cookies. Thus, users with those versions, having deleted HTTP cookies and purged browser history files and caches, may believe that they have purged all tracking data from their computers when in fact Flash browsing history remains. Adobe's own Flash https://, a submenu of the https://, and other editors and toolkits can manage settings for and delete Flash Local Shared Objects.\nExplanatory footnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "20948", "revid": "50714462", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20948", "title": "Brainwashing", "text": "Systematic coercive persuasion\nBrainwashing is the systematic effort to get someone to adopt a particular deception, loyalty, instruction, or doctrine without their will or awareness. Brainwashing is also a colloquial term that refers in general to psychological techniques that manipulate action or thought against a person's will, desire, or knowledge. It attempts to damage individual or group attitudes, frames of reference, beliefs, values or loyalties by demonstrating that current thinking patterns and attitudes are wrong and need change. Brainwashing is said to reduce its subject's ability to think critically or independently, to allow the introduction of new, unwanted thoughts and ideas into their minds.\nThe term \"brainwashing\" was first used in English by Edward Hunter in 1950 to describe how the Chinese government appeared to make people cooperate with them during the Korean War. Research into the concept also looked at Nazi Germany and present-day North Korea, at some criminal cases in the United States, and at the actions of human traffickers. Scientific and legal debate followed, as well as media attention, about the possibility of brainwashing being a factor when lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) was used, or in the induction of people into groups which are considered to be cults.\nBrainwashing has become a common theme in popular culture especially in war stories, thrillers, and science fiction stories. In casual speech, \"brainwashing\" and its verb form, \"brainwash\", are used figuratively to describe the use of propaganda to sway public opinion.\nChina and the Korean War.\nThe Chinese term ( lit.\u2009'wash brain') was originally used by early 20th century Chinese intellectuals to refer to \"modernizing\" one's way of thinking. The term was later used to describe the coercive persuasion used under the Maoist government in China, which aimed to transform \"reactionary\" people into \"right-thinking\" members of the new Chinese social system. The term punned on the Taoist custom of \"cleansing/washing the heart/mind\" () before conducting ceremonies or entering holy places.\nThe earliest known English-language usage of the word \"brainwashing\" in an article by a journalist Edward Hunter, in \"Miami News\", published in 1950. Hunter was an anticommunist and worked for the CIA. Hunter and others used the Chinese term to explain why, during the Korean War (1950\u20131953), some American prisoners of war (POWs) cooperated with their Chinese captors, and even in a few cases defected to their side. British radio operator Robert W. Ford and British army Colonel James Carne also claimed that the Chinese subjected them to brainwashing techniques during their imprisonment.\nThe U.S. military and government laid charges of brainwashing in an effort to undermine confessions made by POWs to war crimes, including biological warfare. After Chinese radio broadcasts claimed to quote Frank Schwable, Chief of Staff of the First Marine Air Wing admitting to participating in germ warfare, United Nations commander General Mark W. Clark asserted: \"Whether these statements ever passed the lips of these unfortunate men is doubtful. If they did, however, too familiar are the mind-annihilating methods of these Communists in extorting whatever words they want ... The men themselves are not to blame, and they have my deepest sympathy for having been used in this abominable way.\"\nBeginning in 1953, Robert Jay Lifton interviewed American servicemen who had been POWs during the Korean War as well as priests, students, and teachers who had been held in prison in China after 1951. In addition to interviews with 25 Americans and Europeans, Lifton interviewed 15 Chinese citizens who had fled after having been subjected to indoctrination in Chinese universities. (Lifton's 1961 book \"\", was based on this research.) Lifton found that when the POWs returned to the United States their thinking soon returned to normal, contrary to the popular image of \"brainwashing.\"\nIn 1956, after reexamining the concept of brainwashing following the Korean War, the U.S. Army published a report entitled \"Communist Interrogation, Indoctrination, and Exploitation of Prisoners of War\", which called brainwashing a \"popular misconception\". The report concludes that \"exhaustive research of several government agencies failed to reveal even one conclusively documented case of 'brainwashing' of an American prisoner of war in Korea.\"\nLegal cases and the \"brainwashing defense\".\nThe concept of brainwashing has been raised in defense of criminal charges. The 1969 to 1971 case of Charles Manson, who was said to have brainwashed his followers to commit murder and other crimes, brought the issue to renewed public attention.\nIn 1974, Patty Hearst, a member of the wealthy Hearst family, when 19 years old was kidnapped by the Symbionese Liberation Army, a left-wing militant organization. After several weeks of captivity, she agreed to join the group and took part in their activities. In 1975, she was arrested and charged with bank robbery and the use of a gun in committing a felony. Her attorney, F. Lee Bailey, argued in her trial that she should not be held responsible for her actions since her treatment by her captors was the equivalent of the alleged brainwashing of Korean War POWs (see also Diminished responsibility). Bailey developed his case in conjunction with psychiatrist Louis Jolyon West and psychologist Margaret Singer. They had both studied the experiences of Korean War POWs. (In 1996, Singer published her theories in her best-selling book \"Cults in Our Midst\".) Despite this defense, Hearst was found guilty.\nIn 1990, Steven Fishman, who was a member of the Church of Scientology, was charged with mail fraud for conducting a scheme to sue large corporations via conspiring with minority stockholders in shareholder class action lawsuits. Fishman's attorneys notified the court that they intended to rely on an insanity defense, using the theories of brainwashing and the expert witnesses of Singer and Richard Ofshe to claim that the Church of Scientology had practiced brainwashing on him, which left him unsuitable to make independent decisions. The court ruled that the use of brainwashing theories is inadmissible in expert witnesses, citing the Frye standard, which states that scientific theories utilized by expert witnesses must be generally accepted in their respective fields. Since then, United States courts have consistently rejected testimony about mind control or brainwashing on the grounds that these theories are not part of accepted science under the Frye standard.\nIn 2003, the brainwashing defense was used unsuccessfully in defense of Lee Boyd Malvo, who was charged with murder for his part in the D.C. sniper attacks. Allegations of brainwashing have also been raised by plaintiffs in child custody cases.\nThomas Andrew Green, in his 2014 book \"Freedom and Criminal Responsibility in American Legal Thought\", argues that the brainwashing defense undermines the law's fundamental premise of free will. In 2003, forensic psychologist Dick Anthony said that \"no reasonable person would question that there are situations where people can be influenced against their best interests, but those arguments are evaluated based on fact, not bogus expert testimony.\"\nAnti-cult movement.\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, the anti-cult movement applied the concept of brainwashing to explain religious conversions to some new religious movements (NRMs) and other groups that they considered cults. News media reports tended to accept their view and social scientists sympathetic to the anti-cult movement, who were usually psychologists, revised models of brainwashing. While some psychologists were receptive to the concept, most sociologists were skeptical of its ability to explain conversion. Some critics of Mormonism have accused it of brainwashing.\nPhilip Zimbardo defined mind control as \"the process by which individual or collective freedom of choice and action is compromised by agents or agencies that modify or distort perception, motivation, affect, cognition or behavioral outcomes.\" He suggested that any human being is susceptible to such manipulation.\nBenjamin Zablocki, late professor of sociology at Rutgers University said that the number of people who attest to brainwashing in interviews (performed in accordance with guidelines of the National Institute of Mental Health and National Science Foundation) is too large to result from anything other than a genuine phenomenon. He said that in the two most prestigious journals dedicated to the sociology of religion there have been no articles \"supporting the brainwashing perspective,\" while over one hundred such articles have been published in other journals \"marginal to the field.\" He concluded that the concept of brainwashing had been blacklisted.\nEileen Barker criticized the concept of brainwashing because it functioned to justify costly interventions such as deprogramming or exit counseling. She has also criticized some mental health professionals, including Singer, for accepting expert witness jobs in court cases involving NRMs. Barker's 1984 book, \"\", describes the religious conversion process to the Unification Church (whose members are sometimes informally referred to as \"Moonies\"), which had been one of the best-known groups said to practice brainwashing. Barker spent close to seven years studying Unification Church members and wrote that she rejects the \"brainwashing\" theory because it does not explain why many people attended a recruitment meeting and did not become members nor why so many members voluntarily disaffiliate or leave groups.\nJames Richardson said that if the new religious movements had access to powerful brainwashing techniques, one would expect that they would have high growth rates, yet in fact, most have not had notable success in recruiting or retaining members. For this and other reasons, sociologists of religion including David Bromley and Anson Shupe consider the idea that \"cults\" are brainwashing American youth to be implausible.\nThomas Robbins, Massimo Introvigne, Lorne Dawson, Gordon Melton, Marc Galanter, and Saul V. Levine, amongst other scholars researching NRMs, have argued and established to the satisfaction of courts, relevant professional associations and scientific communities that there exists no generally accepted scientific theory, based upon methodologically sound research, that supports the concept of brainwashing.\nIn 1999, forensic psychologist Dick Anthony criticized another adherent to this view, Jean-Marie Abgrall, for allegedly employing a pseudoscientific approach and lacking any evidence that anyone's worldview was substantially changed by these coercive methods. He claimed that the concept and the fear surrounding it was used as a tool for the anti-cult movement to rationalize the persecution of minority religious groups. Additionally, Anthony, in the book \"Misunderstanding Cults\", argues that the term \"brainwashing\" has such sensationalist connotations that its use is detrimental to any further scientific inquiry.\nIn 2016, Israeli anthropologist of religion and fellow at the Van Leer Jerusalem Institute Adam Klin-Oron said about then proposed \"anti-cult\" legislation: \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;In the 1980s there was a wave of 'brainwashing' claims, and then parliaments around the world examined the issue, courts around the world examined the issue, and reached a clear ruling: That there is no such thing as cults\u2026that the people making these claims are often not experts on the issue. And in the end courts, including in Israel, rejected expert witnesses who claimed there is \"brainwashing.\"\nUnited States scientific research.\nResearch by the U.S. government.\nFor 20 years, starting in the early 1950s, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the U.S. Department of Defense conducted secret research, including Project MKUltra, in an attempt to develop practical brainwashing techniques. These experiments ranged \"from electroshock therapy to high doses of LSD\".\nThe director Sidney Gottlieb and his team were apparently able to \"blast away the existing mind\" of a human being by using torture techniques; however, reprogramming, in terms of finding \"a way to insert a new mind into that resulting void\", was not so successful.\nControversial psychiatrist Colin A. Ross claims that the CIA was successful in creating programmable so-called \"Manchurian Candidates\" even at the time. The CIA experiments using various psychedelic drugs such as LSD and Mescaline drew from previous Nazi human experimentation.\nIn 1979, John D. Marks wrote in his book \"The Search for the Manchurian Candidate\" that until the MKUltra program was effectively terminated in 1963, the agency's researchers had found no reliable way to brainwash another person, as all experiments at some stage always ended in either amnesia or catatonia, making any operational use impossible.\nA bipartisan Senate Armed Services Committee report, released in part in December 2008 and in full in April 2009, reported that U.S. military trainers who came to Guant\u00e1namo Bay in December 2002 had based an interrogation class on a chart copied from a 1957 Air Force study of \"Chinese Communist\" brainwashing techniques used to elicit false confessions from American POWs during the Korean War. The report showed how the Secretary of Defense's 2002 authorization of the aggressive techniques at Guant\u00e1namo led to their use in Afghanistan and in Iraq, including at Abu Ghraib.\nAmerican Psychological Association.\nIn 1983, the American Psychological Association (APA) asked Singer to chair a task force called the APA Task Force on Deceptive and Indirect Techniques of Persuasion and Control (DIMPAC) to investigate whether brainwashing or coercive persuasion did indeed control cults members. The task force concluded that: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Cults and large group awareness trainings have generated considerable controversy because of their widespread use of deceptive and indirect techniques of persuasion and control. These techniques can compromise individual freedom, and their use has resulted in serious harm to thousands of individuals and families. On 11 May 1987, the APA's Board of Social and Ethical Responsibility for Psychology (BSERP) rejected the DIMPAC report because the report \"lacks the scientific rigor and evenhanded critical approach necessary for APA imprimatur\" and concluded that \"after much consideration, BSERP does not believe that we have sufficient information available to guide us in taking a position on this issue.\"\nOther areas and studies.\nJoost Meerloo, a Dutch psychiatrist, was an early proponent of the concept of brainwashing. \"Menticide\" is a neologism he coined meaning \"killing of the mind\". Meerloo's view was influenced by his experiences during the German occupation of his country during the Second World War and his work with the Dutch government and the American military in the interrogation of accused Nazi war criminals. He later emigrated to the United States and taught at Columbia University. His best-selling 1956 book, \"The Rape of the Mind\", concludes by saying: \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The modern techniques of brainwashing and menticide\u2014those perversions of psychology\u2014can bring almost any man into submission and surrender. Many of the victims of thought control, brainwashing, and menticide that we have talked about were strong men whose minds and wills were broken and degraded. But although the totalitarians use their knowledge of the mind for vicious and unscrupulous purposes, our democratic society can and must use its knowledge to help man to grow, to guard his freedom, and to understand himself.\nRussian historian Daniel Romanovsky, who interviewed survivors and eyewitnesses in the 1970s, reported on what he called \"Nazi brainwashing\" of the people of Belarus by the occupying Germans during the Second World War, which took place through both mass propaganda and intense re-education, especially in schools. Romanovsky noted that very soon, most people had adopted the Nazi view that the Jews were an inferior race and were closely tied to the Soviet government, views that had not been at all common before the German occupation.\nItaly has had controversy over the concept of \"plagio\", a crime consisting in an absolute psychological\u2014and eventually physical\u2014domination of a person. The effect is said to be the annihilation of the subject's freedom and self-determination and the consequent negation of his or her personality. The crime of plagio has rarely been prosecuted in Italy, and only one person was ever convicted. In 1981, an Italian court found that the concept is imprecise, lacks coherence and is liable to arbitrary application.\nRecent scientific book publications in the field of the mental disorder dissociative identity disorder (DID) mention torture-based brainwashing by criminal networks and malevolent actors as a deliberate means to create multiple \"programmable\" personalities in a person to exploit this individual for sexual and financial reasons. Earlier scientific debates in the 1980s and 1990s about torture-based ritual abuse in cults was known as \"satanic ritual abuse,\" which was mainly viewed as a \"moral panic.\"\n\"Brain-Washing: A Synthesis of the Russian Textbook on Psychopolitics\" published by the Church of Scientology in 1955 about brainwashing. L. Ron Hubbard authored the text and alleged it was the secret manual written by Lavrentiy Beria, the Soviet secret police chief, in 1936. When the FBI ignored him, Hubbard wrote again stating that Soviet agents had, on three occasions, attempted to hire him to work against the United States, and were upset about his refusal, and that one agent specifically attacked him using electroshock as a weapon.\nKathleen Barry, co-founder of the United Nations NGO, the Coalition Against Trafficking in Women (CATW), prompted international awareness of human sex trafficking in her 1979 book \"Female Sexual Slavery\". In his 1986 book \"Woman Abuse: Facts Replacing Myths,\" Lewis Okun reported that: \"Kathleen Barry shows in \"Female Sexual Slavery\" that forced female prostitution involves coercive control practices very similar to thought reform.\" In their 1996 book, \"Casting Stones: Prostitution and Liberation in Asia and the United States\", Rita Nakashima Brock and Susan Brooks Thistlethwaite report that the methods commonly used by pimps to control their victims \"closely resemble the brainwashing techniques of terrorists and paranoid cults.\"\nIn his 2000 book, \"Destroying the World to Save It: Aum Shinrikyo, Apocalyptic Violence, and the New Global Terrorism\", Robert Lifton applied his original ideas about thought reform to Aum Shinrikyo and the war on terrorism, concluding that, in this context, thought reform was possible without violence or physical coercion. He also pointed out that in their efforts against terrorism, Western governments were also using some alleged mind control techniques.\nIn her 2004 popular science book, \"\", neuroscientist and physiologist Kathleen Taylor reviewed the history of mind control theories, as well as notable incidents. In it, she theorized that persons under the influence of brainwashing may have more rigid neurological pathways, and that can make it more difficult to rethink situations or to be able to later reorganize these pathways.\nIn 2006 \"\" is a non-fiction book about the evolution of brainwashing from its origins in the Cold War through to today's war on terror. The author, Dominic Streatfeild,\nuses formerly classified documentation and interviews from the CIA. \nNon-suggestive interviews of Sirhan Sirhan over eleven years by psychologist Daniel Brown provided evidence of Sirhan's preparation as a \"Manchurian Candidate\" for the 1968 assassination of Senator Robert Kennedy.\nIn popular culture.\nIn George Orwell's 1949 dystopian novel \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\", the main character is subjected to imprisonment, isolation, and torture to conform his thoughts and emotions to the wishes of the rulers of the book's fictional future totalitarian society. The torturer representing the authorities says, \"We make the brain perfect before we blow it out...Everyone is washed clean.\" Orwell's vision influenced Hunter and is still reflected in the popular concept of brainwashing.\nIn the 1950s, some American films were made that featured brainwashing of POWs, including \"The Rack\", \"The Bamboo Prison\", \"Toward the Unknown\", and \"The Fearmakers\". \"Forbidden Area\" told the story of Soviet secret agents who had been brainwashed through classical conditioning by their own government so they wouldn't reveal their identities. In 1962, \"The Manchurian Candidate\" (based on the 1959 novel by Richard Condon) \"put brainwashing front and center\" by featuring a plot by the Soviet government to take over the United States by using a brainwashed sleeper agent for political assassination.\nThe concept of brainwashing became popularly associated with the research of Russian psychologist Ivan Pavlov, which mostly involved dogs as subjects. In \"The Manchurian Candidate\" the head brainwasher is \"Dr.\u00a0Yen Lo, of the Pavlov Institute.\"\nThe science fiction stories of Cordwainer Smith (pen name of Paul Myron Anthony Linebarger (1913\u20131966), a U.S. Army officer who specialized in military intelligence and psychological warfare during the Second World War and the Korean War) depict brainwashing to remove memories of traumatic events as a normal and benign part of future medical practice.\nBrainwashing remains an important theme in science fiction. A subgenre is \"corporate mind control\", in which a future society is run by one or more business corporations that dominate society, using advertising and mass media to control the population's thoughts and feelings. Terry O'Brien commented: \"Mind control is such a powerful image that if hypnotism did not exist, then something similar would have to have been invented: The plot device is too useful for any writer to ignore. The fear of mind control is equally as powerful an image.\"\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The pact was signed in Moscow on 24 August 1939 (backdated 23 August 1939) by Soviet Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov and German Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop. \nTripartite discussions between the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom and France had broken down after the Soviet Union was excluded from the Munich Agreement in September 1938. Joseph Stalin, the General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, had indicated that the USSR was willing to support Czechoslovakia militarily if France did so as well. Subsequently, rapprochement between Soviet Union and Nazi Germany began in early 1939. Later that year the Soviet-German pact was agreed, committing both sides to neither aid nor ally itself with an enemy of the other for the following 10 years. Under the Secret Additional Protocol of 23 August 1939, Germany and the Soviet Union agreed to partition Poland; Latvia, Estonia, Finland and Bessarabia were allotted to the Soviet sphere, while Lithuania \u2013 apart from the Vilnius region, whose \"interests\" were recognized \u2013 lay in the German sphere (Lithuania \u2013 including the Vilnius region, but excluding a strip of land \u2013 was only transferred to the Soviet sphere by the 28 September 1939 Boundary and Friendship Treaty). In the west, rumored existence of the Secret Protocol was proven only when it was made public during the Nuremberg trials.\nA week after signing the pact, on 1 September 1939, Germany invaded Poland. On 17 September, one day after a Soviet\u2013Japanese ceasefire came into effect after the Battles of Khalkhin Gol, and one day after the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union approved the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact, Stalin, stating concern for ethnic Ukrainians and Belarusians in Poland, ordered the Soviet invasion of Poland. After a short war ending in military defeat for Poland, Germany and the Soviet Union drew up a new border between them on formerly Polish territory in the supplementary protocol of the German\u2013Soviet Boundary and Friendship Treaty.\nIn March 1940, the Soviet Union annexed parts of Karelia, Salla and Kuusamo following the Winter War against Finland. The Soviet annexation of Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and parts of Romania (Bessarabia, Northern Bukovina and the Hertsa region) followed. Stalin's invasion of Bukovina in 1940 violated the pact, since it went beyond the Soviet sphere of influence that had been agreed with the Axis.\nThe territories of Poland annexed by the Soviet Union following the 1939 Soviet invasion east of the Curzon line remained in the Soviet Union after the war and are now in Ukraine and Belarus. Vilnius was given to Lithuania. Only Podlaskie and a small part of Galicia east of the San River, around Przemy\u015bl, were returned to Poland. Of all the other territories annexed by the Soviet Union in 1939\u20131940, those detached from Finland (parts of Karelia, Salla and Kuusamo), Estonia (Estonian Ingria and Petseri County) and Latvia (Abrene) remain part of Russia, the successor state to the Russian SFSR and the Soviet Union after the collapse of the USSR in 1991. The territories annexed from Romania were also integrated into the Soviet Union (such as the Moldavian SSR, or oblasts of the Ukrainian SSR). The core of Bessarabia now forms Moldova. Northern Bessarabia, Northern Bukovina and the Hertsa region now form the Chernivtsi Oblast of Ukraine. Southern Bessarabia is part of the Odesa Oblast, which is also now in Ukraine.\nThe pact was terminated on 22 June 1941, when Germany launched Operation Barbarossa and invaded the Soviet Union, in pursuit of the ideological goal of \"Lebensraum\". The Anglo-Soviet Agreement succeeded it. After the war, Ribbentrop was convicted of war crimes at the Nuremberg trials and executed in 1946, whilst Molotov died in 1986.\nBackground.\nThe outcome of World War I was disastrous for both the German and the Russian empires. The Russian Civil War broke out in late 1917 after the Bolshevik Revolution and Vladimir Lenin, the first leader of the new Soviet Russia, recognised the independence of Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland. Moreover, facing a German military advance, Lenin and Trotsky were forced to agree to the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, which ceded many western Russian territories to Germany. After the German collapse, a multinational Allied-led army intervened in the civil war (1917\u20131922).\nOn 16 April 1922, the German Weimar Republic and the Soviet Union agreed to the Treaty of Rapallo in which they renounced territorial and financial claims against each other. Each party also pledged neutrality in the event of an attack against the other with the Treaty of Berlin (1926). Trade between the two countries had fallen sharply after World War I, but trade agreements signed in the mid-1920s helped to increase trade to 433\u00a0million\u00a0\u211b\ufe01\u2133\ufe01 per year by 1927.\nAt the beginning of the 1930s, the Nazi Party's rise to power increased tensions between Germany and the Soviet Union, along with other countries with ethnic Slavs, who were considered \"Untermenschen\" (subhuman) according to Nazi racial ideology. Moreover, the antisemitic Nazis associated ethnic Jews with both communism and financial capitalism, both of which they opposed. Nazi theory held that Slavs in the Soviet Union were being ruled by \"Jewish Bolshevik\" masters. Hitler had spoken of an inevitable battle for the acquisition of land for Germany in the east. The resulting manifestation of German anti-Bolshevism and an increase in Soviet foreign debts caused a dramatic decline in German\u2013Soviet trade. Imports of Soviet goods to Germany fell to 223\u00a0million\u00a0\u211b\ufe01\u2133\ufe01 in 1934 by the more isolationist Stalinist regime asserting power and by the abandonment of postwar Treaty of Versailles military controls, both of which decreased Germany's reliance on Soviet imports.\nIn 1935 Germany, after a previous German\u2013Polish declaration of non-aggression, Hermann G\u00f6ring proposed a military alliance with Poland against the Soviet Union, but this was rejected.\nIn 1936, Germany and Fascist Italy supported the Spanish Nationalists in the Spanish Civil War, but the Soviets supported the Spanish Republic. As such, the Spanish Civil War became a proxy war between Germany and the Soviet Union. In 1936, Germany and Japan entered the Anti-Comintern Pact. and they were joined a year later by Italy, despite Italy having previously signed the Italo-Soviet Pact.\nIn 1938 on 30 September, Britain and France, by the Munich Agreement and its associated declarations, secured Germany\u2019s pledge of no further territorial demands or war. None of these public instruments contained secret carve-ups of third states unlike the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. \nIn 1939 on March 31, Britain extended a guarantee to Poland that \"if any action clearly threatened Polish independence, and if the Poles felt it vital to resist such action by force, Britain would come to their aid\". Hitler was furious since that meant that the British were committed to political interests in Europe and that his land grabs such as the takeover of Czechoslovakia would no longer be taken lightly. His response to the political checkmate would later be heard at a rally in Wilhelmshaven: \"No power on earth would be able to break German might, and if the Western Allies thought Germany would stand by while they marshalled their 'satellite states' to act in their interests, then they were sorely mistaken\". Ultimately, Hitler's discontent with a British\u2013Polish alliance led to a restructuring of strategy towards Moscow. Alfred Rosenberg wrote that he had spoken to Hermann G\u00f6ring of the potential pact with the Soviet Union: \"When Germany's life is at stake, even a temporary alliance with Moscow must be contemplated\". Sometime in early May 1939 at Berghof, Ribbentrop showed Hitler a film of Stalin viewing his military in a recent parade. Hitler became intrigued with the idea of allying with the Soviets and Ribbentrop recalled Hitler saying that Stalin \"looked like a man he could do business with\". Ribbentrop was then given the nod to pursue negotiations with Moscow.\nMunich Conference.\nHitler's fierce anti-Soviet rhetoric was one of the reasons that Britain and France decided that Soviet participation in the 1938 Munich Conference on Czechoslovakia would be both dangerous and useless. In the Munich Agreement that followed the conference agreed to a German annexation of part of Czechoslovakia in late 1938, but in early 1939 it had been completely dissolved. The policy of appeasement toward Germany was conducted by the governments of British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain and French Prime Minister \u00c9douard Daladier. The policy immediately raised the question of whether the Soviet Union could avoid being next on Hitler's list. Meanwhile the Soviet leadership believed that the West wanted to encourage German aggression in the East. \nFor Germany, an autarkic economic approach and an alliance with Britain were impossible and so closer relations with the Soviet Union to obtain raw materials became necessary. Besides economic reasons, an expected British blockade during a war would also create massive shortages for Germany in a number of key raw materials. After the Munich Agreement, the resulting increase in German military supply needs and Soviet demands for military machinery made talks between the two countries occur from late 1938 to March 1939. Also, the third Soviet five-year plan required new infusions of technology and industrial equipment. German war planners had estimated serious shortfalls of raw materials if Germany entered a war without the Soviet supply.\nOn 31 March 1939, in response to Germany's defiance of the Munich Agreement and the creation of the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, Britain pledged its support and that of France to guarantee the independence of Poland, Belgium, Romania, Greece and Turkey. On 6 April, Poland and Britain agreed to formalise the guarantee as a military alliance, pending negotiations. On 28 April, Hitler denounced the 1934 German\u2013Polish declaration of non-aggression and the 1935 Anglo\u2013German Naval Agreement.\nIn mid-March 1939, attempting to contain Hitler's expansionism, the Soviet Union, Britain and France started to trade a flurry of suggestions and counterplans on a potential political and military agreement. Informal consultations started in April, but the main negotiations began only in May. Meanwhile, throughout early 1939, Germany had secretly hinted to Soviet diplomats that it could offer better terms for a political agreement than could Britain and France.\nThe Soviet Union, which feared Western powers and the possibility of \"capitalist encirclements\", had little hope of preventing war and wanted nothing less than an ironclad military alliance with France and Britain to provide guaranteed support for a two-pronged attack on Germany. As such, Stalin's adherence to the collective security line was purely conditional. Britain and France believed that war could still be avoided, and that the Soviet Union had been so weakened by the Great Purge that it could not be a main military participant. Many military sources were at variance with the last point, especially after the Soviet victories over the Japanese Kwantung Army in Manchuria. France was more anxious to find an agreement with the Soviet Union than Britain was. As a continental power, France was more willing to make concessions and more fearful of the dangers of an agreement between the Soviet Union and Germany. The contrasting attitudes partly explain why the Soviets have often been charged with playing a double game in 1939 of carrying on open negotiations for an alliance with Britain and France but secretly considering propositions from Germany.\nBy the end of May, drafts had been formally presented. In mid-June, the main tripartite negotiations started. Discussions were focused on potential guarantees to Central and Eastern Europe in the case of German aggression. The Soviets proposed to consider that a political turn towards Germany by the Baltic states would constitute an \"indirect aggression\" towards the Soviet Union. Britain opposed such proposals because they feared the Soviets' proposed language would justify a Soviet intervention in Finland and the Baltic states or push those countries to seek closer relations with Germany. The discussion of a definition of \"indirect aggression\" became one of the sticking points between the parties, and by mid-July, the tripartite political negotiations effectively stalled while the parties agreed to start negotiations on a military agreement, which the Soviets insisted had to be reached at the same time as any political agreement. One day before the military negotiations began, the Soviet Politburo pessimistically expected the coming negotiations to go nowhere and formally decided to consider German proposals seriously. The military negotiations began on 12 August in Moscow, with a British delegation headed by Admiral Sir Reginald Drax, French delegation headed by General and the Soviet delegation headed by Kliment Voroshilov, the commissar of defence, and Boris Shaposhnikov, chief of the general staff. Without written credentials, Drax was not authorised to guarantee anything to the Soviet Union and had been instructed by the British government to prolong the discussions as long as possible and to avoid answering the question of whether Poland would agree to permit Soviet troops to enter the country if the Germans invaded.\nNegotiations.\nBeginning of secret talks.\nFrom April to July, Soviet and German officials made statements on the potential for the beginning of political negotiations, but no actual negotiations took place. \"The Soviet Union had wanted good relations with Germany for years and was happy to see that feeling finally reciprocated\", wrote the historian Gerhard L. Weinberg. The ensuing discussion of a potential political deal between Germany and the Soviet Union had to be channeled into the framework of economic negotiations between the two countries, since close military and diplomatic connections that existed before the mid-1930s had been largely severed. In May, Stalin replaced his foreign minister from 1930 to 1939, Maxim Litvinov, who had advocated rapprochement with the West and was also Jewish, with Vyacheslav Molotov to allow the Soviet Union more latitude in discussions with more parties, instead of only Britain and France.\nOn 23 August 1939, two Focke-Wulf Condors, containing German diplomats, officials, and photographers (about 20 in each plane), headed by Ribbentrop, descended into Moscow. German Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop used a specially outfitted Condor \"Grenzmark\", on his two flights to Moscow in 1939, during which he negotiated and signed the \"Treaty of Non-Aggression between Germany and the Soviet Union\", better known as the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact. His aircraft bore the German civil registration of D-ACVH.As the Nazi emissaries stepped off the plane, a Soviet military band played \"Deutschland, Deutschland \u00fcber Alles\". The Nazi arrival was well planned, with all aesthetics in order. The classic hammer and sickle was propped up next to the swastika of the Nazi flag that had been used in a local film studio for Soviet propaganda films. After stepping off the plane and shaking hands, Ribbentrop and Gustav Hilger along with German ambassador Friedrich-Werner von der Schulenburg and Stalin's chief bodyguard, Nikolai Vlasik, entered a limousine operated by the NKVD to travel to Red Square. The limousine arrived close to Stalin's office and was greeted by Alexander Poskrebyshev, the chief of Stalin's personal chancellery. The Germans were led up a flight of stairs to a room with lavish furnishings. Stalin and Molotov greeted the visitors, much to the Nazis' surprise. It was well known that Stalin avoided meeting foreign visitors, and so his presence at the meeting showed how seriously the Soviets were taking the negotiations.\nIn late July and early August 1939, Soviet and German officials agreed on most of the details of a planned economic agreement and specifically addressed a potential political agreement, which the Soviets stated could come only after an economic agreement.\nThe German presence in the Soviet capital during negotiations were rather tense. German pilot Hans Baur recalled that Soviet secret police followed every move. Their job was to inform authorities when he left his residence and where he was headed. Baur's guide informed him: \"Another car would tack itself onto us and follow us fifty or so yards in the rear, and wherever we went and whatever we did, the secret police would be on our heels.\" Baur also recalled trying to tip his Russian driver, which led to a harsh exchange of words: \"He was furious. He wanted to know whether this was the thanks he got for having done his best for us to get him into prison. We knew perfectly well it was forbidden to take tips.\"\nAugust negotiations.\nIn early August, Germany and the Soviet Union worked out the last details of their economic deal and started to discuss a political agreement. Both countries' diplomats explained to each other the reasons for the hostility in their foreign policy in the 1930s and found common ground in both countries' anticapitalism with Karl Schnurre stating: \"there is one common element in the ideology of Germany, Italy, and the Soviet Union: opposition to the capitalist democracies\" or that \"it seems to us rather unnatural that a socialist state would stand on the side of the western democracies\".\nAt the same time, British, French, and Soviet negotiators scheduled three-party talks on military matters to occur in Moscow in August 1939 that aimed to define what the agreement would specify on the reaction of the three powers to a German attack. The tripartite military talks, started in mid-August, hit a sticking point on the passage of Soviet troops through Poland if Germans attacked, and the parties waited as British and French officials overseas pressured Polish officials to agree to such terms. Polish officials refused to allow Soviet troops into Polish territory if Germany attacked; Polish Foreign Minister J\u00f3zef Beck pointed out that the Polish government feared that if the Red Army entered Polish territory, it would never leave.\nOn 19 August, the 1939 German\u2013Soviet Commercial Agreement was finally signed. On 21 August, the Soviets suspended the tripartite military talks and cited other reasons. The same day, Stalin received assurances that Germany would approve secret protocols to the proposed non-aggression pact that would place the half of Poland east of the Vistula River as well as Latvia, Estonia, Finland and Bessarabia in the Soviet sphere of influence. That night, Stalin replied that the Soviets were willing to sign the pact and that he would receive Ribbentrop on 23 August.\nNews leaks.\nOn 25 August 1939, the \"New York Times\" ran a front-page story by Otto D. Tolischus, \"Nazi Talks Secret\", whose subtitle included \"Soviet and Reich Agree on East\". On 26 August 1939, the \"New York Times\" reported Japanese anger and French communist surprise over the pact. The same day, however, Tolischus filed a story that noted Nazi troops on the move near Gleiwitz (now Gliwice), which led to the false flag Gleiwitz incident on 31 August 1939. On 28 August 1939, the \"New York Times\" was still reporting on fears of a Gleiwitz raid. On 29 August 1939, the \"New York Times\" reported that the Supreme Soviet had failed on its first day of convening to act on the pact. The same day, the \"New York Times\" also reported from Montreal, Canada, that American Professor Samuel N. Harper of the University of Chicago had stated publicly his belief that \"the Russo-German non-aggression pact conceals an agreement whereby Russia and Germany may have planned spheres of influence for Eastern Europe\". On 30 August 1939, the \"New York Times\" reported a Soviet buildup on its Western frontiers by moving 200,000 troops from the Far East.\nSecret protocol.\nOn 22 August, one day after talks broke down with France and Britain, Moscow revealed that Ribbentrop would visit Stalin the next day. The Soviets were still negotiating with the British and the French missions in Moscow. With the Western nations unwilling to accede to Soviet demands, Stalin instead entered a secret German\u2013Soviet pact. On 23 August, a ten-year non-aggression pact was signed with provisions that included consultation, arbitration if either party disagreed, neutrality if either went to war against a third power and no membership of a group \"which is directly or indirectly aimed at the other\". The article \"On Soviet\u2013German Relations\" in the Soviet newspaper \"Izvestia\" of 21 August 1939, stated:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Following completion of the Soviet\u2013German trade and credit agreement, there has arisen the question of improving political links between Germany and the USSR.\nThere was also a secret protocol to the pact, which was revealed only after Germany's defeat in 1945 although hints about its provisions had been leaked much earlier, so as to influence Lithuania. According to the protocol, Poland, Romania, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, and Finland were divided into German and Soviet \"spheres of influence\". In the north, Finland, Estonia, and Latvia were assigned to the Soviet sphere. Poland was to be partitioned in the event of its \"political rearrangement\": the areas east of the Pisa, Narew, Vistula, and San rivers would go to the Soviet Union, and Germany would occupy the west. Warsaw, in turn, would be effectively divided between them into two parts. Lithuania, which was adjacent to East Prussia, was assigned to the German sphere of influence, but a second secret protocol, agreed to in September 1939, reassigned Lithuania to the Soviet Union. According to the protocol, Lithuania would be granted its historical capital, Vilnius, which was part of Poland during the interwar period. Another clause stipulated that Germany would not interfere with the Soviet Union's actions towards Bessarabia, which was then part of Romania. As a result, Bessarabia as well as the Northern Bukovina and Hertsa regions were occupied by the Soviets and integrated into the Soviet Union.\nAt the signing, Ribbentrop and Stalin enjoyed warm conversations, exchanged toasts and further addressed the prior hostilities between the countries in the 1930s. They characterised Britain as always attempting to disrupt Soviet\u2013German relations and stated that the Anti-Comintern Pact was aimed not at the Soviet Union but actually at Western democracies and \"frightened principally the City of London [British financiers] and the English shopkeepers.\"\nRevelation.\nThe agreement stunned the world. John Gunther, in Moscow in August 1939, recalled how the news of the 19 August commercial agreement surprised journalists and diplomats, who hoped for world peace. They did not expect the 21 August announcement of the non-aggression pact: \"Nothing more unbelievable could be imagined. Astonishment and skepticism turned quickly to consternation and alarm\". The news was met with utter shock and surprise by government leaders and media worldwide, most of whom were aware of only the British\u2013French\u2013Soviet negotiations, which had taken place for months; by Germany's allies, notably Japan; by the Comintern and foreign Communist parties; and Jewish communities all around the world.\nChurchill remembered the event as a \u201cnever-to-be-forgotten transaction\u201d and later Historian Geoffrey\u00a0Roberts named it as the \u201cmost stunning volte-face in diplomatic history.\u201d Anglo - American leaders felt, in the words of Churchill, as if \u201ca deadly bomb\u201d had been thrown at the Democracies: \u201cThe sinister news broke in the world like an explosion.\u201d British Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Sir Alexander Cadogan, recorded in his Diary the day after the Pact: \u201cBlack day... Terms of German-Soviet Pact [are] out...\u00a0There is really nothing to do. We have got to wait and hope.\u201d First Viscount Templewood, Samuel Hoare, remembered: \u201cAugust 1939 was the worst month I have ever spent.\u201d US Secretary of the Interior, Harold L. Ickes, recorded in his Diary on August 26, 1939:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;This [Pact] completely upset the diplomatic applecart\u2026 The Russian \u2013 German alliance has been a great shock\u2026 It is a terrible situation\u2026 [Unless] a miracle happens, it seems to me that the dismemberment of the British Empire, and that of the French as well, is in sight \u2026 I doubt very much whether England and France can now defeat Germany and Italy with Russia sterilized \u2026 The situation is still uncertain but it is woeful\u2026 [It] is shocking that Russia should have entered into an alliance with Germany, which may mean the submerging of democratic civilizations not only in Europe but in the world.\nThe day before the Pact, on August 22, 1939, former US Ambassador to Moscow, Joseph E. Davies, had reported to his Under Secretary of State Sumner Welles that, from any point of view, Hitler \"has won a smashing diplomatic victory.\" Britain and France are on the verge of the most disastrous loss of prestige in their history. The real menace to the future of Western civilization lies in the prospect that the resources of Russia supplement the industry and science of Germany. \"The threat of Fascist domination of the world looms larger than ever before.\"\nArnold A. Offner cited several expressions heard in Washington after the pact: An unchecked new combination confronted the United States with \u201cimperialist schemes\"\u00a0but now backed up by an extremely strong military force. The Nazi - Soviet pact created a \u201cbloc running from the Pacific clear to the Rhine\"; the \u201ccombined Soviet - Nazi allies now have all Europe...\u201d Hitler and Stalin are \u201cable to rule from Manchuria to the Rhine... and nothing\u00a0to stop\u00a0the combined Russian - German force at any point... Europe is gone.\u201d\nThe impact on the West was perceived by Hitler: \u201cToday's announcement of the non-aggression pact with Russia came as a bombshell.\u201d According to Max Domarus, it was \"Hitler's design to brew the British 'one devilish portion' - to enter into a pact with the devil himself \u2013\u00a0Bolshevism. This would give them a healthy fright and make their knees trembling at the prospect of the Nazi-Communist alliance.\"\nMeanwhile, in Germany the revelation of the Pact saw a more positive reaction. Reich Minister of Armaments, Albert Speer, recorded his impression: \u201cTo see the names of Hitler and Stalin linked in friendship on a piece of paper was the most staggering, the most exciting turn of events I could possibly have imagined.\u201d \nA Berlin newspaper wrote: \"80 million Germans and 180 million Russians! Their unity would create a bloc representing the greatest military-industrial power in the world, an empire, stretching across the unprecedented greatest lebensraum of Europe and Asia.\"\nOn 24 August, \"Pravda\" and \"Izvestia\" carried news of the pact's public portions, complete with the now-famous front-page picture of Molotov signing the treaty with a smiling Stalin looking on. The same day, German diplomat Hans von Herwarth, whose grandmother was Jewish, informed Italian diplomat Guido Relli and American charg\u00e9 d'affaires Charles Bohlen of the secret protocol on the vital interests in the countries' allotted \"spheres of influence\" but failed to reveal the annexation rights for \"territorial and political rearrangement\". The agreement's public terms so exceeded the terms of an ordinary non-aggression treaty\u2014requiring that both parties consult with each other, and not aid a third party attacking either\u2014that Gunther heard a joke that Stalin had joined the anti-Comintern pact. \"Time Magazine\" repeatedly referred to the Pact as the \"Communazi Pact\" and its participants as \"communazis\" until April 1941.\nSoviet propaganda and representatives went to great lengths to minimize the importance of the fact that they had opposed and fought the Germans in various ways for a decade prior to signing the pact. Molotov tried to reassure the Germans of his good intentions by commenting to journalists that \"fascism is a matter of taste\". For its part, Germany also did a public volte-face regarding its virulent opposition to the Soviet Union. On August 31, 1939,\u00a0Molotov referred to the Pact in his speech to the Supreme Soviets:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The day the Soviet-German non-aggression pact was signed, August 23, 1939, should be regarded as a day of great historical importance. The\u2026pact\u2026 marks a turning point in the history of Europe, and not of Europe alone\u2026 The countries which suffered most of all in the war of 1914-18 were Russia and Germany. Therefore, the interests of the peoples of the Soviet Union and Germany are not in mutual enmity... This pact not only eliminates the menace of war with Germany, narrows down the zone of possible hostilities in Europe, and serves thereby the cause of universal peace; it should secure for us new possibilities of increasing our strength, the further consolidation of our position, and the further growth of the influence of the Soviet Union on international developments.\nLater historiography widely argues that Hitler still viewed an attack on the Soviet Union as \"inevitable\". This confidence, however, was not expressed by the contemporary policy-makers and observers. Many of them emphasized a common camp of the Axis and Soviet powers and expected this camp to evolve into a military\u00a0alliance. Such an alliance was\u00a0advocated\u00a0by many Axis leaders, such as Ribbentrop, Schulenburg, Halder, Raeder, Weizs\u00e4cker, Niedermayer, Haushofer, Hilger, Warlimont, Tojo and Matsuoka. Hitler\u00a0himself, for a year since the conclusion of the Pact, repeatedly described it as a \"triumph of reason\" that marks the decisive difference between World War I and the present War, and\u00a0stressed other advantages of the Pact both publicly and privately (to Mussolini). \n\u201cContrary to expectations, there is nothing to suggest that Hitler had seriously envisaged war against the Soviet Union prior to July 1940.\u201d Some\u00a0policy-makers of the democratic Allies\u00a0advocated attacking both Germany and the\u00a0USSR until as late\u00a0as June 1941 and Churchill adhered to the advice.\nConcerns over the possible existence of a secret protocol were expressed first by the intelligence organizations of the Baltic states only days after the pact was signed. Speculation grew stronger when Soviet negotiators referred to its content during the negotiations for military bases in those countries (see occupation of the Baltic States).\nThe day after the pact was signed, the Franco-British military delegation urgently requested a meeting with Soviet military negotiator Kliment Voroshilov. On 25 August, Voroshilov told them that \"in view of the changed political situation, no useful purpose can be served in continuing the conversation\". The same day, Hitler told the British ambassador to Berlin that the pact with the Soviets prevented Germany from facing a two-front war, which changed the strategic situation from that in World War I, and that Britain should accept his demands on Poland.\nJoseph E. Davies recorded in his Diary on August 26, 1939: \"The die was cast when Hitler closed his eastern gates and when Ribbentrop flew to Moscow a few days ago. The fat is already in the fire. Everyone in Europe knows that Germany is already mobilized for an immediate invasion of Poland.\" On 25 August, surprised by Britain joining a defense pact with Poland, Hitler postponed an invasion of Poland from 26 August to 1 September. In accordance with the defence pact, Britain and France declared war on Germany on 3 September.\nConsequences in Finland, Poland, the Baltic States and Romania.\nInitial invasions.\nOn 1 September 1939, Germany invaded Poland from the west. Within a few days, Germany began conducting massacres of Polish and Jewish civilians and POWs, which took place in over 30 towns and villages in the first month of the German occupation. The Luftwaffe also took part by strafing fleeing civilian refugees on roads and by carrying out a bombing campaign. The Soviet Union assisted German air forces by allowing them to use signals broadcast by the Soviet radio station at Minsk, allegedly \"for urgent aeronautical experiments\".\nHitler declared at Danzig:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIn the opinion of Robert Service, Stalin did not move instantly but was waiting to see whether the Germans would halt within the agreed area, and the Soviet Union also needed to secure the frontier in the Soviet\u2013Japanese border conflicts. On 17 September, the Red Army invaded Poland, violating the 1932 Soviet\u2013Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and occupied the Polish territory assigned to it by the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact. That was followed by co-ordination with German forces in Poland. Polish troops already fighting much stronger German forces on its west desperately tried to delay the capture of Warsaw. Consequently, Polish forces could not mount significant resistance against the Soviets. On 18 September, \"The New York Times\" published an editorial arguing that \"Hitlerism is brown communism, Stalinism is red fascism...The world will now understand that the only real 'ideological' issue is one between democracy, liberty and peace on the one hand and despotism, terror and war on the other.\"\nOn 21 September, Marshal of the Soviet Union Voroshilov, German military attach\u00e9 General K\u00f6string, and other officers signed a formal agreement in Moscow co-ordinating military movements in Poland, including the \"purging\" of saboteurs and the Red Army assisting with destruction of the \"enemy\". Joint German\u2013Soviet parades were held in Lviv and Brest-Litovsk, and the countries' military commanders met in the latter city. Stalin had decided in August that he was going to liquidate the Polish state, and a German\u2013Soviet meeting in September addressed the future structure of the \"Polish region\". Soviet authorities immediately started a campaign of Sovietisation of the newly acquired areas. The Soviets organised staged elections, the result of which was to become a legitimisation of the Soviet annexation of eastern Poland.\nModification of secret protocols.\nEleven days after the Soviet invasion of the Polish Kresy, the secret protocol of the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact was modified by the German\u2013Soviet Boundary and Friendship Treaty, allotting Germany a larger part of Poland and transferring Lithuania, with the exception of the left bank of the River Scheschupe, the \"Lithuanian Strip\", from the envisioned German sphere to the Soviet sphere. On 28 September 1939, the Soviet Union and German Reich issued a joint declaration in which they declared:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;After the Government of the German Reich and the Government of the USSR have, by means of the treaty signed today, definitively settled the problems arising from the collapse of the Polish state and have thereby created a sure foundation for lasting peace in the region, they mutually express their conviction that it would serve the true interest of all peoples to put an end to the state of war existing at present between Germany on the one side and England and France on the other. Both Governments will, therefore, direct their common efforts, jointly with other friendly powers if the occasion arises, toward attaining this goal as soon as possible.\nShould, however, the efforts of the two Governments remain fruitless, this would demonstrate the fact that England and France are responsible for the continuation of the war, whereupon, in case of the continuation of the war, the Governments of Germany and of the USSR shall engage in mutual consultations with regard to necessary measures.\nOn 3 October, Friedrich Werner von der Schulenburg, the German ambassador in Moscow, informed Joachim Ribbentrop that the Soviet government was willing to cede the city of Vilnius and its environs. On 8 October 1939, a new German\u2013Soviet agreement was reached by an exchange of letters between Vyacheslav Molotov and the German ambassador.\nThe Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania were given no choice but to sign a so-called \"Pact of Defence and Mutual Assistance\", which permitted the Soviet Union to station troops in them.\nSoviet war with Finland and Katyn massacre.\nAfter the Baltic states had been forced to accept treaties, Stalin turned his sights on Finland and was confident that its capitulation could be attained without great effort. The Soviets demanded territories on the Karelian Isthmus, the islands of the Gulf of Finland and a military base near the Finnish capital, Helsinki, which Finland rejected. The Soviets staged the shelling of Mainila on 26 November and used it as a pretext to withdraw from the Soviet\u2013Finnish Non-Aggression Pact. On 30 November, the Red Army invaded Finland, launching the Winter War with the aim of annexing Finland into the Soviet Union. The Soviets formed the Finnish Democratic Republic to govern Finland after Soviet conquest. The leader of the Leningrad Military District, Andrei Zhdanov, commissioned a celebratory piece from Dmitri Shostakovich, \"Suite on Finnish Themes\", to be performed as the marching bands of the Red Army would be parading through Helsinki. After Finnish defenses surprisingly held out for over three months and inflicted stiff losses on Soviet forces, under the command of Semyon Timoshenko, the Soviets settled for an interim peace. Finland ceded parts of Karelia, Kuusamo, and Salla together with Hanko leased as a naval base (9% of Finnish territory), which resulted in approximately 422,000 Finns (12% of Finland's population) losing their homes. Soviet official casualty counts in the war exceeded 200,000 although Soviet First Secretary Nikita Khrushchev later claimed that the casualties may have been one million.\nAround that time, after several Gestapo\u2013NKVD conferences, Soviet NKVD officers also conducted lengthy interrogations of 300,000 Polish POWs in camps that were a selection process to determine who would be killed. On 5 March 1940, in what would later be known as the Katyn massacre, 22,000 members of the military as well as intellectuals were executed, labelled \"nationalists and counterrevolutionaries\" or kept at camps and prisons in western Ukraine and Belarus.\nSoviet Union occupies the Baltic states and part of Romania.\nIn mid-June 1940, while international attention focused on the German invasion of France, Soviet NKVD troops raided border posts in Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia.\nState administrations were liquidated and replaced by Soviet cadres, who deported or killed 34,250 Latvians, 75,000 Lithuanians and almost 60,000 Estonians. Elections took place, with a single pro-Soviet candidate listed for many positions, and the resulting people's assemblies immediately requesting admission into the Soviet Union, which was granted. (The Soviets annexed the whole of Lithuania, including the \u0160e\u0161up\u0117 area, which had been earmarked for Germany.)\nFinally, on 26 June, four days after the armistice between France and Nazi Germany, the Soviet Union issued an ultimatum that demanded Bessarabia and unexpectedly Northern Bukovina from Romania. Two days later, the Romanians acceded to the Soviet demands, and the Soviets occupied the territories. The Hertsa region was initially not requested by the Soviets but was later occupied by force after the Romanians had agreed to the initial Soviet demands. The subsequent waves of deportations began in Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina.\nBeginnings of Operation Tannenberg and other Nazi atrocities.\nAt the end of October 1939, Germany enacted the death penalty for disobedience to the German occupation. Germany began a campaign of \"Germanization\", which meant assimilating the occupied territories politically, culturally, socially and economically into the German Reich. 50,000\u2013200,000 Polish children were kidnapped to be Germanised.\nThe elimination of Polish elites and intelligentsia was part of \"Generalplan Ost\". The \"Intelligenzaktion\", a plan to eliminate the Polish intelligentsia, Poland's 'leadership class', took place soon after the German invasion of Poland and lasted from fall of 1939 to the spring of 1940. As the result of the operation, in ten regional actions, about 60,000 Polish nobles, teachers, social workers, priests, judges and political activists were killed. It was continued in May 1940, when Germany launched \"AB-Aktion\", More than 16,000 members of the intelligentsia were murdered in Operation Tannenberg alone.\nGermany also planned to incorporate all of the land into Nazi Germany. That effort resulted in the forced resettlement of two million Poles. Families were forced to travel in the severe winter of 1939\u20131940, leaving behind almost all of their possessions without compensation. As part of Operation Tannenberg alone, 750,000 Polish peasants were forced to leave, and their property was given to Germans. A further 330,000 were murdered. Germany planned the eventual move of ethnic Poles to Siberia.\nAlthough Germany used forced labourers in most other occupied countries, Poles and other Slavs were viewed as inferior by Nazi propaganda and thus better suited for such duties. Between 1 and 2.5\u00a0million Polish citizens were transported to the Reich for forced labour. All Polish males were made to perform forced labour. While ethnic Poles were subject to selective persecution, all ethnic Jews were targeted by the Reich. In the winter of 1939\u201340, about 100,000 Jews were thus deported to Poland. They were initially gathered into massive urban ghettos, such as the 380,000 held in the Warsaw Ghetto, where large numbers died of starvation and diseases under their harsh conditions, including 43,000 in the Warsaw Ghetto alone. Poles and ethnic Jews were imprisoned in nearly every camp of the extensive concentration camp system in German-occupied Poland and the Reich. In Auschwitz, which began operating on 14 June 1940, 1.1\u00a0million people perished.\nRomania and Soviet republics.\nIn the summer of 1940, fear of the Soviet Union, in conjunction with German support for the territorial demands of Romania's neighbours and the Romanian government's own miscalculations, resulted in more territorial losses for Romania. Between 28 June and 4 July, the Soviet Union occupied and annexed Bessarabia, Northern Bukovina and the Hertsa region of Romania.\nOn 30 August, Ribbentrop and Italian Foreign Minister Galeazzo Ciano issued the Second Vienna Award, giving Northern Transylvania to Hungary. On 7 September, Romania ceded Southern Dobruja to Bulgaria (Axis-sponsored Treaty of Craiova). After various events over the following months, Romania increasingly took on the aspect of a German-occupied country.\nThe Soviet-occupied territories were converted into republics of the Soviet Union. During the two years after the annexation, the Soviets arrested approximately 100,000 Polish citizens and deported between 350,000 and 1,500,000, of whom between 250,000 and 1,000,000 died, mostly civilians. Forced re-settlements into gulag labour camps and exile settlements in remote areas of the Soviet Union occurred. According to Norman Davies, almost half of them were dead by July 1940.\nFurther secret protocol modifications settling borders and immigration issues.\nOn 10 January 1941, Germany and the Soviet Union signed an agreement settling several ongoing issues. Secret protocols in the new agreement modified the \"Secret Additional Protocols\" of the German\u2013Soviet Boundary and Friendship Treaty, ceding the Lithuanian Strip to the Soviet Union in exchange for US$7.5\u00a0million (31.5\u00a0million\u00a0\u211b\ufe01\u2133\ufe01). The agreement formally set the border between Germany and the Soviet Union between the Igorka River and the Baltic Sea. It also extended trade regulation of the 1940 German-Soviet Commercial Agreement until 1 August 1942, increased deliveries above the levels of the first year of that agreement, settled trading rights in the Baltics and Bessarabia, calculated the compensation for German property interests in the Baltic states that were now occupied by the Soviets and covered other issues. It also covered the migration to Germany within &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;2+1\u20442 months of ethnic Germans and German citizens in Soviet-held Baltic territories and the migration to the Soviet Union of Baltic and \"White Russian\" \"nationals\" in the German-held territories.\nSoviet\u2013German relations.\nEarly political issues.\nBefore the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop pact was announced, Western communists denied that such a treaty would be signed. Herbert Biberman, a future member of the Hollywood Ten, denounced rumours as \"Fascist propaganda\". Earl Browder, the head of the Communist Party USA, stated that \"there is as much chance of agreement as of Earl Browder being elected president of the Chamber of Commerce.\" Gunther wrote, however, that some knew \"communism and Fascism were more closely allied than was normally understood\", and Ernst von Weizs\u00e4cker had told Nevile Henderson on 16 August that the Soviet Union would \"join in sharing in the Polish spoils\". In September 1939, the Comintern suspended all anti-Nazi and anti-fascist propaganda and explained that the war in Europe was a matter of capitalist states attacking one another for imperialist purposes. Western communists acted accordingly; although they had previously supported collective security, they now denounced Britain and France for going to war.\nWhen anti-German demonstrations erupted in Prague, Czechoslovakia, the Comintern ordered the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia to employ all of its strength to paralyse \"chauvinist elements\". Moscow soon forced the French Communist Party and the Communist Party of Great Britain to adopt anti-war positions. On 7 September, Stalin called Georgi Dimitrov, who sketched a new Comintern line on the war that stated that the war was unjust and imperialist, which was approved by the secretariat of the Comintern on 9 September. Thus, western communist parties now had to oppose the war and to vote against war credits. Although the French communists had unanimously voted in Parliament for war credits on 2 September and declared their \"unshakeable will\" to defend the country on 19 September, the Comintern formally instructed the party to condemn the war as imperialist on 27 September. By 1 October, the French communists advocated listening to German peace proposals, and leader Maurice Thorez deserted from the French Army on 4 October and fled to Russia. Other communists also deserted from the army.\nThe Communist Party of Germany featured similar attitudes. In \"Die Welt\", a communist newspaper published in Stockholm the exiled communist leader Walter Ulbricht opposed the Allies, stated that Britain represented \"the most reactionary force in the world\", and argued, \"The German government declared itself ready for friendly relations with the Soviet Union, whereas the English\u2013French war bloc desires a war against the socialist Soviet Union. The Soviet people and the working people of Germany have an interest in preventing the English war plan\".\nDespite a warning by the Comintern, German tensions were raised when the Soviets stated in September that they must enter Poland to \"protect\" their ethnic Ukrainian and Belarusian brethren from Germany. Molotov later admitted to German officials that the excuse was necessary because the Kremlin could find no other pretext for the Soviet invasion.\nDuring the early months of the Pact, Soviet foreign policy became critical of the Allies and more pro-German in turn. During the Fifth Session of the Supreme Soviet on 31 October 1939, Molotov analysed the international situation, thus giving the direction for communist propaganda. According to Molotov, Germany had a legitimate interest in regaining its position as a great power, and the Allies had started an aggressive war in order to maintain the Versailles system.\nExpansion of raw materials and military trading.\nGermany and the Soviet Union entered an intricate trade pact on 11 February 1940 that was over four times larger than the one that the two countries had signed in August 1939. The new trade pact helped Germany surmount a British blockade. In the first year, Germany received one million tons of cereals, half-a-million tons of wheat, 900,000 tons of oil, 100,000 tons of cotton, 500,000 tons of phosphates and considerable amounts of other vital raw materials, along with the transit of one million tons of soybeans from Manchuria. Those and other supplies were being transported through Soviet and occupied Polish territories. The Soviets were to receive a naval cruiser, the plans to the battleship \"Bismarck\", heavy naval guns, other naval gear and 30 of Germany's latest warplanes, including the Bf 109 and Bf 110 fighters and Ju 88 bomber. The Soviets would also receive oil and electric equipment, locomotives, turbines, generators, diesel engines, ships, machine tools, and samples of German artillery, tanks, explosives, chemical-warfare equipment, and other items.\nThe Soviets also helped Germany to avoid British naval blockades by providing a submarine base, Basis Nord, in the northern Soviet Union near Murmansk. That also provided a refueling and maintenance location and a takeoff point for raids and attacks on shipping. In addition, the Soviets provided Germany with access to the Northern Sea Route for both cargo ships and raiders though only the commerce raider used the route before the German invasion, which forced Britain to protect sea lanes in both the Atlantic and the Pacific.\nSummer deterioration of relations.\nThe Finnish and Baltic invasions began a deterioration of relations between the Soviets and Germany. Stalin's invasions were a severe irritant to Berlin since the intent to accomplish them had not been communicated to the Germans beforehand, and they prompted concern that Stalin was seeking to form an anti-German bloc. Molotov's reassurances to the Germans only intensified the Germans' mistrust. On 16 June, as the Soviets invaded Lithuania but before they had invaded Latvia and Estonia, Ribbentrop instructed his staff \"to submit a report as soon as possible as to whether in the Baltic States a tendency to seek support from the Reich can be observed or whether an attempt was made to form a bloc.\"\nIn August 1940, the Soviet Union briefly suspended its deliveries under its commercial agreement after relations were strained after disagreements over policy in Romania, the Soviet war with Finland, Germany's falling behind on its deliveries of goods under the pact and Stalin's worry that Hitler's war with the West might end quickly after France signed an armistice. The suspension created significant resource problems for Germany. By the end of August, relations had improved again, as the countries had redrawn the Hungarian and Romanian borders and settled some Bulgarian claims, and Stalin was again convinced that Germany would face a long war in the west with Britain's improvement in its air battle with Germany and the execution of an agreement between the United States and Britain regarding destroyers and bases.\nIn early September however, Germany arranged its own occupation of Romania, targeting its oil fields. That move raised tensions with the Soviets, who responded that Germany was supposed to have consulted with the Soviet Union under Article III of the pact.\nGerman\u2013Soviet Axis talks.\nAfter Germany in September 1940 entered the Tripartite Pact with Japan and Italy, Ribbentrop wrote to Stalin, inviting Molotov to Berlin for negotiations aimed to create a 'continental bloc' of Germany, Italy, Japan, and the Soviet Union. Stretching from Gibraltar to Yokohama, the bloc would be powerful enough to oppose Britain and the United States. This strategy was consistently preferred by Ribbentrop over Hitler's \u201cPush to the East.\u201d Stalin sent Molotov to Berlin to negotiate the terms for the Soviet Union to join the Axis and potentially to enjoy the spoils of the pact. After negotiations during November 1940 on where to extend the Soviet sphere of influence, Hitler broke off talks and resumed planning for the eventual invasion of the Soviet Union.\nLate relations.\nIn an effort to demonstrate peaceful intentions toward Germany, on 13 April 1941, the Soviets signed a neutrality pact with Japan, an Axis power. While Stalin had little faith in Japan's commitment to neutrality, he felt that the pact was important for its political symbolism to reinforce a public affection for Germany. Stalin felt that there was a growing split in German circles about whether Germany should initiate a war with the Soviet Union. Stalin did not know that Hitler had been secretly discussing an invasion of the Soviet Union since summer 1940 and that Hitler had ordered his military in late 1940 to prepare for war in the East, regardless of the parties' talks of a potential Soviet entry as a fourth Axis power.\nOn 1 May 1941 USSR held an annual International Workers Day parade on Red Square in Moscow with German diplomat Ernst August K\u00f6string and Wehrmacht general Hans Krebs invited as prominent guests.\nTermination.\nGermany unilaterally terminated the pact at 03:15 on 22 June 1941 by launching a massive attack on the Soviet Union in Operation Barbarossa. Stalin had ignored repeated warnings that Germany was likely to invade and ordered no \"full-scale\" mobilisation of forces although the mobilisation was ongoing. After the launch of the invasion, the territories gained by the Soviet Union as a result of the pact were lost in a matter of weeks. The southeastern part was absorbed into Greater Germany's General Government, and the rest was integrated with the Reichskommissariats Ostland and Ukraine. Within six months, the Soviet military had suffered 4.3\u00a0million casualties, and three million more had been captured. The lucrative export of Soviet raw materials to Germany over the course of the economic relations continued uninterrupted until the outbreak of hostilities. The Soviet exports in several key areas enabled Germany to maintain its stocks of rubber and grain from the first day of the invasion to October 1941.\nAftermath.\nDiscovery of the secret protocol.\nThe German original of the secret protocols was presumably destroyed in the bombing of Germany, but in late 1943, Ribbentrop had ordered the most secret records of the German Foreign Office from 1933 onward, amounting to some 9,800 pages, to be microfilmed. When the various departments of the Foreign Office in Berlin were evacuated to Thuringia at the end of the war, Karl von Loesch, a civil servant who had worked for the chief interpreter Paul Otto Schmidt, was entrusted with the microfilm copies. He eventually received orders to destroy the secret documents but decided to bury the metal container with the microfilms as personal insurance for his future well-being. In May 1945, von Loesch approached the British Lieutenant Colonel Robert C. Thomson with the request to transmit a personal letter to Duncan Sandys, Churchill's son-in-law. In the letter, von Loesch revealed that he had knowledge of the documents' whereabouts but expected preferential treatment in return. Thomson and his American counterpart, Ralph Collins, agreed to transfer von Loesch to Marburg, in the American zone if he would produce the microfilms. The microfilms contained a copy of the Non-Aggression Treaty as well as the Secret Protocol. Both documents were discovered as part of the microfilmed records in August 1945 by US State Department employee Wendell B. Blancke, the head of a special unit called \"Exploitation German Archives\" (EGA).\nNews of the secret protocols first appeared during the Nuremberg trials. Alfred Seidl, the attorney for defendant Hans Frank, was able to place into evidence an affidavit that described them. It was written from memory by Nazi Foreign Office lawyer Friedrich Gaus, who wrote the text and was present at its signing in Moscow. Later, Seidl obtained the German-language text of the secret protocols from an anonymous Allied source and attempted to place them into evidence while he was questioning witness Ernst von Weizs\u00e4cker, a former Foreign Office State Secretary. The Allied prosecutors objected, and the texts were not accepted into evidence, but Weizs\u00e4cker was permitted to describe them from memory, thus corroborating the Gaus affidavit. Finally, at the request of a \"St. Louis Post-Dispatch\" reporter, American deputy prosecutor Thomas J. Dodd acquired a copy of the secret protocols from Seidl and had it translated into English. They were first published on 22 May 1946 in a front-page story in that newspaper. Later, in Britain, they were published by \"The Manchester Guardian\".\nThe protocols gained wider media attention when they were included in an official State Department collection, \"Nazi\u2013Soviet Relations 1939\u20131941\", edited by Raymond J. Sontag and James S. Beddie and published on 21 January 1948. The decision to publish the key documents on German\u2013Soviet relations, including the treaty and protocol, had been taken already in spring 1947. Sontag and Beddie prepared the collection throughout the summer of 1947. In November 1947, President Harry S. Truman personally approved the publication, but it was held back in view of the Foreign Ministers Conference in London scheduled for December. Since negotiations at that conference did not prove to be constructive from an American point of view, the document edition was sent to press. The documents made headlines worldwide. State Department officials counted it as a success: \"The Soviet Government was caught flat-footed in what was the first effective blow from our side in a clear-cut propaganda war.\"\nDespite publication of the recovered copy in western media, for decades, the official policy of the Soviet Union was to deny the existence of the secret protocol. The secret protocol's existence was officially denied until 1989. Vyacheslav Molotov, one of the signatories, went to his grave categorically rejecting its existence. The French Communist Party did not acknowledge the existence of the secret protocol until 1968, as the party de-Stalinized.\nOn 23 August 1986, tens of thousands of demonstrators in 21 western cities, including New York, London, Stockholm, Toronto, Seattle, and Perth participated in Black Ribbon Day Rallies to draw attention to the secret protocols.\nStalin's \"Falsifiers of History\" and Axis negotiations.\nIn response to the publication of the secret protocols and other secret German\u2013Soviet relations documents in the State Department edition \"Nazi\u2013Soviet Relations\" (1948), Stalin published \"Falsifiers of History\", which included the claim that during the pact's operation, Stalin rejected Hitler's claim to share in a division of the world, without mentioning the Soviet offer to join the Axis. That version persisted, without exception, in historical studies, official accounts, memoirs, and textbooks published in the Soviet Union until the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Later on, Soviet diplomat Victor Israelyan stated that the book \"certainly did nothing to disprove the existence of Soviet-German cooperation in the first years of World War II, a cooperation that to a certain degree assisted Hitler's plan\".\nThe book also claimed that the Munich Agreement was a \"secret agreement\" between Germany and \"the west\" and a \"highly important phase in their policy aimed at goading the Hitlerite aggressors against the Soviet Union.\"\nDenial of the secret protocol.\nFor decades, it was the official policy of the Soviet Union to deny the existence of the secret protocol to the Soviet\u2013German Pact. At the behest of Mikhail Gorbachev, Alexander Yakovlev headed a commission investigating the existence of such a protocol. In December 1989, the commission concluded that the protocol had existed and revealed its findings to the Congress of People's Deputies of the Soviet Union. As a result, the Congress passed the declaration confirming the existence of the secret protocols and condemning and denouncing them. The Soviet government thus finally acknowledged and denounced the Secret Treaty and Mikhail Gorbachev, the last Head of State condemned the pact. Vladimir Putin condemned the pact as \"immoral\" but also defended it as a \"necessary evil\". In 2019, Putin went further and announced that the signing of the pact was no worse than the 1938 Munich Agreement, which led to the partition of Czechoslovakia.\nBoth successor states of the pact parties have declared the secret protocols to be invalid from the moment that they were signed: the Federal Republic of Germany on 1 September 1989 and the Soviet Union on 24 December 1989, following an examination of the microfilmed copy of the German originals.\nThe Soviet copy of the original document was declassified in 1992 and published in a scientific journal in early 1993.\nIn August 2009, in an article written for the Polish newspaper \"Gazeta Wyborcza\", Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin condemned the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact as \"immoral\".\nThe new Russian nationalists and revisionists, including Russian negationist Aleksandr Dyukov and Nataliya Narotchnitskaya, whose book carried an approving foreword by the Russian foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, described the pact as a necessary measure because of the British and French failure to enter into an antifascist pact.\nPostwar commentary on motives of Stalin and Hitler.\nSome scholars believe that, from the very beginning of the Tripartite negotiations between the Soviet Union, Great Britain and France, the Soviets clearly required the other parties to agree to a Soviet occupation of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, and for Finland to be included in the Soviet sphere of influence.\nOn the timing of German rapprochement, many historians agree that the dismissal of Maxim Litvinov, whose Jewish ethnicity was viewed unfavourably by Nazi Germany, removed an obstacle to negotiations with Germany. Stalin immediately directed Molotov to \"purge the ministry of Jews.\" Given Litvinov's prior attempts to create an anti-fascist coalition, association with the doctrine of collective security with France and Britain and a pro-Western orientation by the standards of the Kremlin, his dismissal indicated the existence of a Soviet option of rapprochement with Germany. Likewise, Molotov's appointment served as a signal to Germany that the Soviet Union was open to offers. The dismissal also signaled to France and Britain the existence of a potential negotiation option with Germany. One British official wrote that Litvinov's termination also meant the loss of an admirable technician or shock-absorber but that Molotov's \"modus operandi\" was \"more truly Bolshevik than diplomatic or cosmopolitan.\" Carr argued that the Soviet Union's replacement of Litvinov with Molotov on 3 May 1939 indicated not an irrevocable shift towards alignment with Germany but rather was Stalin's way of engaging in hard bargaining with the British and the French by appointing a proverbial hard man to the Foreign Commissariat. Historian Albert Resis stated that the Litvinov dismissal gave the Soviets freedom to pursue faster German negotiations but that they did not abandon British\u2013French talks. Derek Watson argued that Molotov could get the best deal with Britain and France because he was not encumbered with the baggage of collective security and could negotiate with Germany. Geoffrey Roberts argued that Litvinov's dismissal helped the Soviets with British\u2013French talks because Litvinov doubted or maybe even opposed such discussions.\nE. H. Carr stated: \"In return for 'non-intervention' Stalin secured a breathing space of immunity from German attack.\" According to Carr, the \"bastion\" created by means of the pact \"was and could only be, a line of defense against potential German attack.\" According to Carr, an important advantage was that \"if Soviet Russia had eventually to fight Hitler, the Western Powers would already be involved.\" However, during the last decades, that view has been disputed. Historian Werner Maser - who served the German army during the second World War - stated that \"the claim that the Soviet Union was at the time threatened by Hitler, as Stalin supposed... is a legend, to whose creators Stalin himself belonged. In Maser's view, \"neither Germany nor Japan were in a situation [of] invading the USSR even with the least perspective [\"sic\"] of success,\" which must not have been known to Stalin. Carr further stated that for a long time, the primary motive of Stalin's sudden change of course was assumed to be the fear of German aggressive intentions. On the other hand, Soviet-born Australian historical writer Alex Ryvchin characterized the pact as \"a Soviet deal with the devil, which contained a secret protocol providing for the remaining independent states of East-Central Europe to be treated as courses on some debauched degustation menu for two of the greatest monsters in history.\"\nTwo weeks after Soviet armies had entered the Baltic states, Berlin requested Finland to permit the transit of German troops, and five weeks later Hitler issued a secret directive \"to take up the Russian problem, to think about war preparations,\" a war whose objective would include establishment of a Baltic confederation.\nA number of German historians have debunked the claim that Operation Barbarossa was a preemptive strike, such as Andreas Hillgruber, Rolf-Dieter M\u00fcller, and Christian Hartmann, but they also acknowledge that the Soviets were aggressive to their neighbors.\nStalin's daughter, Svetlana Alliluyeva, \"remembered her father saying after [the war]: 'Together with the Germans we would have been invincible'.\"\nRussian Trotskyist historian Vadim Rogovin argued that Stalin had destroyed thousands of foreign communists capable of leading socialist change in their respective countries. He referenced the thousands of German communists that were handed over from Stalin to the Gestapo after the signing of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. Rogovin also noted that sixteen members of the Central Committee of the German Communist Party became victims of Stalinist terror. Similarly, historian Eric D. Weitz discussed the areas of collaboration between the regimes in which hundreds of German citizens, the majority of whom were Communists, had been handed over to the Gestapo from Stalin's administration. Weitz also stated that a higher proportion of the KPD Politburo members had died in the Soviet Union than in Nazi Germany. However, according to the work of Wilhelm Mensing, there is no evidence which suggests that the Soviets specifically targeted German and Austrian Communists or others who perceived themselves as \"anti-fascists\" for deportations to Nazi Germany.\nRemembrance and response.\nThe pact was a taboo subject in the postwar Soviet Union. In December 1989, the Congress of People's Deputies of the Soviet Union condemned the pact and its secret protocol as \"legally deficient and invalid\". In modern Russia, the pact is often portrayed positively or neutrally by the pro-government propaganda; for example, Russian textbooks tend to describe the pact as a defensive measure, not as one aiming at territorial expansion. In 2009, Russian President Vladimir Putin stated that \"there are grounds to condemn the Pact\", but described it in 2014 as \"necessary for Russia's survival\". Accusations that cast doubt on the positive portrayal of the USSR's role in World War II have been seen as highly problematic for the modern Russian state, which sees Russia's victory in the war as one of \"the most venerated pillars of state ideology\", which legitimises the current government and its policies. In February 2021, the State Duma voted in favor of a law to punish the dissemination of \"fake news\" regarding the Soviet Union's role in World War II, including claiming that Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union held equal responsibility due to the pact.\nIn 2009, the European Parliament proclaimed 23 August, the anniversary of the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact, as the European Day of Remembrance for Victims of Stalinism and Nazism, to be commemorated with dignity and impartiality. In connection with the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe parliamentary resolution condemned both communism and fascism for starting World War II and called for a day of remembrance for victims of both Stalinism and Nazism on 23 August. In response to the resolution, Russian lawmakers threatened the OSCE with \"harsh consequences\". A similar resolution was passed by the European Parliament a decade later, blaming the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact for the outbreak of war in Europe and again leading to criticism by Russian authorities.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "20952", "revid": "49730707", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20952", "title": "Mobile, Alabama", "text": "City in Alabama, United States\nMobile ( , ) is a city and the county seat of Mobile County, Alabama, United States. The population was 187,041 at the 2020 census and estimated at 204,689 following an annexation in 2023, making it the second-most populous city in Alabama. The Mobile metropolitan area, with an estimated 412,000 people, is the third-most populous metropolitan area in the state.\nAlabama's only saltwater port, Mobile is located on the Mobile River at the head of Mobile Bay on the north-central Gulf Coast. The Port of Mobile has always played a key role in the economic health of the city, beginning with the settlement as an important trading center between the French colonists and Native Americans, and now to its current role as the 12th-largest port in the United States. During the American Civil War, the city surrendered to Federal forces on April 12, 1865, after Union victories at two forts protecting the city.\nConsidered one of the Gulf Coast's cultural centers, Mobile has several art museums, a symphony orchestra, professional opera, professional ballet company, and a large concentration of historic architecture. Mobile is known for having Mardi Gras, the oldest organized Carnival celebration in the United States. Alabama's French Creole population celebrated this festival from the first decade of the 18th century. Beginning in 1830, Mobile was home to the first organized Carnival mystic society to celebrate with a parade in the United States.\nHistory.\nEtymology.\nThe city named after the Mobile tribe that the French colonists encountered living around Mobile Bay. Although it is debated by Alabama historians, they may have been descendants of the Native American tribe from the small fortress town, Mabila, in central Alabama. The Mobile tribe became allies with the French colonists and suggested the location for the original town of Mobile and a river fort. The tribe's language was the basis for Mobilian Jargon, a Choctaw-derived \"lingua franca\" widely used to facilitate trade among the various Gulf Coast peoples. About seven years after the founding of the French Mobile settlement, the Mobile tribe, along with the Tohom\u00e9, gained permission from the colonists to settle near the fort.\nColonial.\nIn 1702, French colonists founded the Old Mobile Site south of existing Native American villages on the Mobile River. The \"Fort Louis de la Louisiane\" was built on a bluff that today is upriver from the Mobile River's mouth. The original town of Mobile was built on lower ground just downriver from the fort. French Canadian brothers Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville and Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne, Sieur de Bienville founded the site to establish control over France's claims to \"La Louisiane\". From 1702 to 1711, it was the French colonial capital. Mobile's Roman Catholic parish was established on July 20, 1703, by Jean-Baptiste de la Croix de Chevri\u00e8res de Saint-Vallier, Bishop of Quebec, and was the first French Catholic parish established on the Gulf Coast. In 1704, the ship \"P\u00e9lican\" delivered 23 Frenchwomen to the colony, but passengers had contracted yellow fever at a stop in Havana; though most recovered, many colonists and neighboring Native Americans contracted the disease and died. African slaves were transported to Mobile on a supply ship from the French colony of Saint-Domingue in the Caribbean.\nDisease and flooding plagued French colonists at the Old Mobile Site. The colony grew to 279 persons by 1708 but shrank to 178 persons two years later. Bienville ordered the settlement to relocate downriver and Mobile moved to its present location at the confluence of the Mobile River and Mobile Bay in 1711. According to anthropologist Greg Waselkov, French colonists burned the Old Mobile Site to the ground, likely to prevent their enemies from occupying it. An earth-and-palisade Fort Louis was constructed at the new site. The capital of La Louisiane was moved in 1720 to Biloxi, and Mobile became a regional military and trading center. In 1723 the construction of a new brick fort with a stone foundation began and it was renamed Fort Cond\u00e9 in honor of Louis Henri, Duke of Bourbon.\nIn 1763, Britain defeated France in the Seven Years' War. The Treaty of Paris ceded French territories east of the Mississippi River to Britain, including Mobile. The city became part of the expanded British West Florida colony. The British changed the name of Fort Cond\u00e9 to Fort Charlotte, after Queen Charlotte.\nThe British promised religious tolerance to the French colonists, and 112 French colonists remained in Mobile. The first permanent Jewish settlers came to Mobile in 1763 as a result of the new British rule and religious tolerance; Jews were not allowed to officially reside in colonial French Louisiana due to the Code Noir. Most colonial-era Jews in Mobile were merchants and traders from Sephardic Jewish communities in Savannah, Georgia and Charleston, South Carolina. By 1766, the town's population was estimated to be 860 people, although the borders were smaller than during the French colonial period. During the American Revolutionary War, West Florida and Mobile became a refuge for loyalists fleeing the other colonies.\nWhile the British were fighting rebellious colonists along the Atlantic coast, the Spanish entered the war in 1779. The Spanish wished to eliminate any British threat to their Louisiana colony west of the Mississippi River, which they had received from France in the 1763 Treaty of Paris. Bernardo de Galvez, the Spanish Governor of Louisiana, captured Mobile during the Battle of Fort Charlotte in 1780. Their actions were condoned by the revolting American colonies, partially evidenced by the presence of Oliver Pollack, representative of the American Continental Congress. Due to strong trade ties, many residents of Mobile and West Florida remained loyal to the British Crown. The Spanish renamed the fort as Fortaleza Carlota, and held Mobile as a part of Spanish West Florida until 1813, when it was seized by United States General James Wilkinson during the War of 1812.\n19th century.\nWhen Mobile was included in the Mississippi Territory in 1813, the population had dwindled to roughly 300 people. The territory was split in 1817, and the eastern half, including the Mobile Bay area, became the Alabama Territory for two years before being admitted to the union as the state of Alabama. Mobile's population had increased to 809 by that time. Mobile was well situated for trade, as its location tied it to a river system that served as the principal navigational access for most of Alabama and a large part of Mississippi. River transportation was aided by the introduction of steamboats in the early decades of the 19th century. By 1822, the city's population had risen to 2,800.\nThe Industrial Revolution in Great Britain created shortages of cotton, increasing prices on world markets. Much land well suited to growing cotton lies in the vicinity of the Mobile River, and its main tributaries the Tombigbee and Alabama Rivers. A plantation economy using slave labor developed in the region and Mobile's population quickly grew. From the 1830s onward, Mobile expanded into a city of commerce focused on the cotton and slave trades. Slaves were transported by ship in the coastwise slave trade from the Upper South. Many businesses in the city were related to the slave trade, and the city's booming businesses attracted merchants from the North; by 1850 10% of its population was from New York City, which was deeply involved in the cotton industry.\nMobile was the slave-trading center of the state until the 1850s, when it was surpassed by Montgomery. The prosperity stimulated a building boom that was underway by the mid-1830s. This was cut short in part by the Panic of 1837 and yellow fever epidemics. The waterfront was developed with wharves, terminal facilities, and fireproof brick warehouses. The exports of cotton grew in proportion to the amounts being produced in the Black Belt; by 1840 Mobile was second only to New Orleans in cotton exports in the nation. Mobile slaveholders owned relatively few slaves compared to planters in the upland plantation areas, but many households had domestic slaves, and many other slaves worked on the waterfront and on riverboats. The last slaves to enter the United States from the African trade were brought to Mobile on the slave ship \"Clotilda\", including Cudjoe Lewis, who was the last survivor of the slave trade.\nBy 1860 Mobile's population within the city limits had reached 29,258 people; it was the 27th-largest city in the United States and 4th-largest in what would soon be the Confederate States of America. The free population in the whole of Mobile County, including the city, consisted of 29,754 citizens, of which 1,195 were free people of color. Additionally, 1,785 slave owners in the county held 11,376 people in bondage, about one-quarter of the total county population of 41,130 people.\nDuring the American Civil War, Mobile was a Confederate city. The \"H. L. Hunley\", the first submarine to sink an enemy ship, was built in Mobile. One of the most famous naval engagements of the war was the Battle of Mobile Bay, resulting in the Union taking control of Mobile Bay on August 5, 1864. On April 12, 1865, three days after Robert E. Lee's surrender at Appomattox Courthouse, the city surrendered to the Union army to avoid destruction after Union victories at nearby Spanish Fort and Fort Blakeley.\nOn May 25, 1865, the city suffered great loss when some three hundred people died as a result of an explosion at a federal ammunition depot on Beauregard Street. The explosion left a deep hole at the depot's location, and sank ships docked on the Mobile River; the resulting fires destroyed the northern portion of the city.\nFederal Reconstruction in Mobile began after the Civil War and effectively ended in 1874 when the local Democrats gained control of the city government. The last quarter of the 19th century was a time of economic depression and municipal insolvency for Mobile. One example can be provided by the value of Mobile's exports during this period of depression. The value of exports leaving the city fell from $9 million in 1878 to $3\u00a0million in 1882.\n20th century before WWII.\nThe turn of the 20th century brought the Progressive Era to Mobile. The economic structure developed with new industries, generating new jobs and attracting a significant increase in population. The population increased from around 40,000 in 1900 to 60,000 by 1920. During this time the city received $3 million in federal grants for harbor improvements to deepen the shipping channels. During and after World War I, manufacturing became increasingly vital to Mobile's economic health, with shipbuilding and steel production being two of the most important industries.\nDuring this time, social justice and race relations in Mobile worsened. The state passed a new constitution in 1901 that disenfranchised most blacks and many poor whites; and the white Democratic-dominated legislature passed other discriminatory legislation. In 1902, the city government passed Mobile's first racial segregation ordinance, segregating the city streetcars. It legislated what had been informal practice, enforced by convention. Mobile's African-American population responded to this with a two-month boycott, but the law was not repealed. After this, Mobile's \"de facto\" segregation was increasingly replaced with legislated segregation as whites imposed Jim Crow laws to maintain supremacy.\nIn 1911 the city adopted a commission form of government, which had three members elected by at-large voting. Considered to be progressive, as it would reduce the power of ward bosses, this change resulted in the elite white majority strengthening its power, as only the majority could gain election of at-large candidates. In addition, poor whites and blacks had already been disenfranchised. Mobile was one of the last cities to retain this form of government, which prevented smaller groups from electing candidates of their choice. But Alabama's white yeomanry had historically favored single-member districts in order to elect candidates of their choice.\nThe red imported fire ant was first introduced into the United States via the Port of Mobile. Sometime in the late 1930s they came ashore off cargo ships arriving from South America. The ants were carried in the soil used as ballast on those ships. They have spread throughout the South and Southwest.\nDuring World War II, the defense buildup in Mobile shipyards resulted in a considerable increase in the city's white middle-class and working-class population, largely due to the massive influx of workers coming to work in the shipyards and at Brookley Army Air Field. Between 1940 and 1943, more than 89,000 people moved into Mobile to work for war effort industries.\nMobile was one of eighteen United States cities producing Liberty ships. Its Alabama Drydock and Shipbuilding Company (ADDSCO) supported the war effort by producing ships faster than the Axis powers could sink them. ADDSCO also churned out a copious number of T2 tankers for the War Department. Gulf Shipbuilding Corporation, a subsidiary of Waterman Steamship Corporation, focused on building freighters, s, and minesweepers. The rapid increase of population in the city produced crowded conditions, increasing social tensions in the competition for housing and good jobs.\nIn May 1943, a race riot broke out between whites and blacks. ADDSCO management had long maintained segregated conditions at the shipyards, although the Roosevelt administration had ordered defense contractors to integrate facilities. That year ADDSCO promoted 12 blacks to positions as welders, previously reserved for whites; and whites objected to the change by rioting on May 24. The mayor appealed to the governor to call in the National Guard to restore order, but it was weeks before officials allowed African Americans to return to work.\nPost-WWII.\nIn the late 1940s, the transition to the postwar economy was hard for the city, as thousands of jobs were lost at the shipyards with the decline in the defense industry. Eventually the city's social structure began to become more liberal. Replacing shipbuilding as a primary economic force, the paper and chemical industries began to expand. No longer needed for defense, most of the old military bases were converted to civilian uses. Following the war, in which many African Americans had served, veterans and their supporters stepped up activism to gain enforcement of their constitutional rights and social justice, especially in the Jim Crow South. During the 1950s the City of Mobile integrated its police force and Spring Hill College accepted students of all races. Unlike in the rest of the state, by the early 1960s the city buses and lunch counters voluntarily desegregated.\nThe Alabama legislature passed the Cater Act in 1949, allowing cities and counties to set up industrial development boards (IDB) to issue municipal bonds as incentives to attract new industry into their local areas. The city of Mobile did not establish a Cater Act board until 1962. George E. McNally, Mobile's first Republican mayor since Reconstruction, was the driving force behind the founding of the IDB. The Mobile Area Chamber of Commerce, believing its members were better qualified to attract new businesses and industry to the area, considered the new IDB as a serious rival. After several years of political squabbling, the Chamber of Commerce emerged victorious. While McNally's IDB prompted the Chamber of Commerce to become more proactive in attracting new industry, the chamber effectively shut Mobile city government out of economic development decisions.\nIn 1963, three African-American students brought a case against the Mobile County School Board for being denied admission to Murphy High School. This was nearly a decade after the United States Supreme Court had ruled in \"Brown v. Board of Education\" (1954) that segregation of public schools was unconstitutional. The federal district court ordered that the three students be admitted to Murphy for the 1964 school year, leading to the desegregation of Mobile County's school system.\nThe civil rights movement gained congressional passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Voting Rights Act of 1965, which increased the percentage of black residents able to vote, ended multiple forms of segregation, and allowed the NAACP to return to Mobile. However, the city's commission form of government with at-large voting resulted in all positions being elected by the white majority, as African Americans could not command a majority for their candidates in the informally segregated city. Many forms of de facto segregation persisted for decades.\nIn 1969, the Department of Defense closed Brookley Air Force Base, dealing a blow to Mobile's economy. It affected about 10% of workers in the city. In total, 16,000 people lost their jobs.\nMobile's city commission form of government was challenged and finally overturned in 1982 in \"City of Mobile v. Bolden\", which was remanded by the United States Supreme Court to the district court. Finding that the city had adopted a commission form of government in 1911 and at-large positions with discriminatory intent, the court proposed that the three members of the city commission should be elected from single-member districts, likely ending their division of executive functions among them. Mobile's state legislative delegation in 1985 finally enacted a mayor-council form of government, with seven members elected from single-member districts. This was approved by voters. As white conservatives increasingly entered the Republican Party in the late 20th century, African-American residents of the city have elected members of the Democratic Party as their candidates of choice. Since the change to single-member districts, more women and African Americans were elected to the council than under the at-large system.\nBeginning in the late 1980s, newly elected mayor Mike Dow and the city council began an effort termed the \"String of Pearls Initiative\" to make Mobile into a competitive city. The city initiated construction of numerous new facilities and projects, and the restoration of hundreds of historic downtown buildings and homes. City and county leaders also made efforts to attract new business ventures to the area.\nGeography.\nMobile is located in the southwestern region of the U.S. state of Alabama.\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , with of it being land, and , or 22.5% of the total, being covered by water.

Although a Category-2, Sally moved slowly through Alabama causing significant damage in its path. While the area was still recovering from Sally, a month later Hurricane Zeta struck the area as a Category-3.\nChristmas Day tornado.\nIn December 2012, the city suffered two major tornadoes. One touched down on December 20, and the other five days later. On December 20, an EF1 tornado touched down near Davidson High School and took a path ending in Prichard.

The heaviest damage to houses was along Carlen Street, Rickarby Place, Dauphin Street, Old Shell Road, Margaret Street, Silverwood Street, and Springhill Avenue. The second tornado was classified as an EF2 tornado by the National Weather Service on December 26. As a result of the significant damage from the tornado, Murphy High School students were transferred to nearby Clark-Shaw Magnet School to finish out the school year as repairs were being made to Murphy High. This increased the student body at the Clark-Shaw campus from 700 students to almost 3,000 students.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAs of the 2020 census, there were 187,041 people, 77,772 households, and 45,953 families residing in the city.

The annual Carnival celebration, Mardi Gras, is an example of its differences. Mobile has the longest history of celebrating Mardi Gras in the United States, dating to the early 18th century during the French colonial period. Carnival in Mobile evolved over 300 years from a sedate French Catholic tradition to a mainstream multi-week celebration. Mobile's official cultural ambassadors are the Azalea Trail Maids, meant to embody the ideals of Southern hospitality.\nCarnival and Mardi Gras.\nThe Carnival season has expanded throughout the late fall and winter: balls in the city may be scheduled as early as November, with the parades beginning after January 5 and the Twelfth Day of Christmas or Epiphany on January 6. Carnival celebrations end at midnight on Mardi Gras, which falls on the Tuesday before Ash Wednesday. During the Carnival season, mystic societies build floats, parade through downtown, and toss small gifts to spectators. They also hold formal masquerade balls, usually by invitation only.\nCarnival was first celebrated in Mobile in 1703 when colonial French Catholic settlers carried out their traditional celebration at the Old Mobile Site. Mobile's first Carnival society was established in 1711 with the \"Boeuf Gras Society\" (Fatted Ox Society). In 1830 Mobile's Cowbellion de Rakin Society was the first formally organized and masked mystic society in the United States to celebrate with a parade. The Cowbellions began their parade with rakes, hoes, and cowbells. They introduced horse-drawn floats in 1840. The Striker's Independent Society, formed in 1843, is the oldest surviving mystic society in the United States. Carnival celebrations were canceled during the American Civil War.\nMardi Gras parades were revived by Joe Cain in the 1860s. He paraded as a fictional \"undefeated Chickasaw chief\" supported by a band of \"Lost Cause Minstrels\" in defiance of Union-led Reconstruction. Founded in 2004, the Conde Explorers in 2005 were the first integrated Mardi Gras society to parade in downtown Mobile. The Explorers were featured in the documentary, \"The Order of Myths\" (2008), by Margaret Brown about Mobile's Mardi Gras.\nArchives and libraries.\nThe National African American Archives and Museum features the history of African-American participation in Mardi Gras, slavery-era artifacts, and portraits and biographies of famous African Americans.

In the old \"Press-Register\" building, there is the Alabama Contemporary Art Center, which contains artworks by living artists.\nHistoric architecture.\nMobile has surviving antebellum architectural examples of the Creole cottage, Greek Revival, Gothic Revival, and Italianate styles. The earliest homes and fortifications were simple wooden structures, elevated on pilings driven into the frequently soaked soil. Early cottages, similar to those in other French settlements, were built as rows of two or three separate rooms each with a front and rear door that often opened onto an external porch running the length of the home. Kitchens were separate buildings. Some of these wooden structures rotted away in the 1700s. Fires in 1827 and 1839 destroyed the city's remaining wooden colonial architecture.\nWood continued to be used for nearly all homes in the 1800s, and the colonial cottages evolved into what became known as the Creole cottage in the 1840s. Creole cottages, such as the Carlen House, have front and rear porches covered by the roof. They run parallel to the street, often with a chimney at either end. The 1827 fire and an economic boom in the 1830s allowed much of the city to be rebuilt, often in the optimistic and then-popular Greek Revival style. Structures like the Mobile City Hospital were built on an imposing scale with round doric columns in their facades. A simplified Gothic Revival style gained popularity in the 1850s, with cresting along some rooflines and simple tracery framing the windows. The Italianate style emerged before the Civil War and thrived after it. Italianate detailing can be seen in surviving examples such as the Martin Horst House, with its cast iron rails, elaborate exterior molding, bracketed eaves, and parapet around the hipped roof. Italianate storefronts became common in downtown Mobile until they were surpassed by the Victorian style in the late 1800s. Victorian cottages with board-and-batten siding also became popular in the late 1800s, but few survive. The city's lone example of the Egyptian Revival style is the Scottish Rite Temple, with Egyptian motifs, including obelisks and sphinxes. Other architectural styles in the city include shotgun houses, Colonial Revival, Tudor Revival, Spanish Colonial Revival, and Beaux-Arts.\nThe city's historic districts include: Old Dauphin Way, Oakleigh Garden, Lower Dauphin Street, Leinkauf, De Tonti Square, Church Street East, Ashland Place, Campground, and Midtown. Many storefronts from the 1800s still stand along Lower Dauphin Street. Renovations to the ground floors of some buildings often leave the upper floors untouched. The Oakleigh Garden District is centered around the most photographed house in Mobile, Oakleigh. Many bracketed Italianate residences were later built around it.\nThe Cathedral Basilica of the Immaculate Conception was built on the colonial-era Campo Santo cemetery, of which no trace remains. Several historic cemeteries were established shortly after the colonial era. The Church Street Graveyard contains above-ground tombs and monuments spread over and was founded in 1819. The nearby Magnolia Cemetery was established in 1836 and served as Mobile's primary burial site during the 19th and early 20th centuries.

However, efforts to restart passenger rail service between Mobile and New Orleans were revived in 2019 by the 21-member Southern Rail Commission after receiving a $33 million Federal Railroad Administration grant in June of that year. Louisiana quickly dedicated its $10 million toward the project, and Mississippi initially balked before committing its $15 million sum but Governor Kay Ivey resisted committing the estimated $2.7 million state allocation from Alabama because of concerns regarding long-term financial commitments and potential competition with freight traffic from the Port of Mobile.\nThe Winter of 2019 was marked by repeated postponement of votes by the Mobile City Council as it requested more information on how rail traffic from the port would be impacted and where the Amtrak station would be built as community support for the project became more vocal, especially among millennials. A day before a deadline in the federal grant matching program being used to fund the project, the city council committed about $3 million in a 6\u20131 vote.\nAbout $2.2 million was still needed for infrastructure improvements and the train station must still be built before service begins. Potential locations for the station include at the foot of Government Street in downtown and in the Mobile Aeroplex at Brookley, which was favored by the Port of Mobile. Eventually, it was determined that a pocket track and a platform would be constructed for service to resume.

The Alabama State Port Authority owns and operates the public terminals at the Port of Mobile. The public terminals handle containerized, bulk, breakbulk, roll-on/roll-off, and heavy-lift cargoes. The port is also home to private bulk terminal operators, as well as a number of highly specialized shipbuilding and repair companies with two of the largest floating dry docks on the Gulf Coast.\nThe city was a home port for cruise ships from Carnival Cruise Lines. The first cruise ship to call the port home was the \"Holiday\", which left the city in November 2009 so that a larger and newer ship could take its place. The \"Carnival Fantasy\" operated from Mobile from then on until the \"Carnival Elation\" arrived in May 2010. In early 2011, Carnival announced that despite fully booked cruises, the company would cease operations from Mobile in October 2011. This cessation of cruise service left the city with an annual debt service of around two million dollars related to the terminal. In September 2015, Carnival announced that the \"Carnival Fantasy\" was relocating from Miami, Florida, to Mobile and would offer four- and five-night cruises to Mexico that started in November 2016 through November 2017. Her first departure from Mobile left on November 9, 2016, on a five-night cruise to Cozumel and Progreso. \"Carnival Fascination\" will be replacing \"Carnival Fantasy\" in 2022.&lt;\nUtilities.\nNatural gas has been used in Mobile since 1836 when natural gas was used for lighting. Between 1933 and 2016 natural gas was provided by Mobile Gas. In 2016, Spire Inc. bought EnergySouth, Inc, the parent company of Mobile Gas and has been provide the service to the surrounding community since then.\nThe water for Mobile is provided by Mobile Area Water and Sewer System (MAWSS). When MAWSS was founded in 1814, it used Three-Mile Creek to provide water to the city. In 1952, MAWSS constructed a dam at Tanner Williams road to block Big Creek stream creating Big Creek Lake, a water reservoir for the city and the surrounding area.\nIn 1884 with the demonstration of an incandescent lightbulb, Mobile Electric Company began providing electricity to the city as an alternative lighting method. In 1925, Alabama Power bought the Mobile Electric Company. Electricity is still available from Alabama Power to this day. Alabama Power owns and operates James M. Barry Electric Generating Plant, fueled by coal and natural gas, and Theodore Cogen Facility, fueled by natural gas. These two power plants generate a total capacity of 3,519,870\u00a0kW for the surrounding communities.\nHealthcare.\nMobile serves the central Gulf Coast as a regional center for medicine. The 200-year-old Mobile County Health Department (MCHD) provides education and preventive health services to Mobile and surrounding areas. Infirmary Health is Alabama's largest nonprofit, non-governmental health care system. It includes their flagship hospital Mobile Infirmary, two emergency centers and three outpatient surgery centers. Mobile Infirmary is the largest nonprofit hospital in the state.\nUniversity of South Alabama Health (USA Health) operates 30 locations in the Mobile area, including three hospitals: USA Health Providence Hospital, the Children's &amp; Women's Hospital, and University Hospital. Providence Hospital was founded in 1854 by the Daughters of Charity. In 2023, USA Health acquired Providence Hospital from its private Catholic ownership. The University of South Alabama Medical Center was founded in 1830 as the old city-owned Mobile City Hospital and associated medical school. A teaching hospital, it is designated as Mobile's only level I trauma center by the Alabama Department of Public Health and is also a regional burn center. Children's &amp; Women's Hospital is dedicated exclusively to the care of women and minors. In 2008, the University of South Alabama opened the Mitchell Cancer Center Institute, which includes the first academic cancer research center in the central Gulf Coast region.\nBayPointe Hospital and Children's Residential Services is the city's only psychiatric hospital. It houses a residential unit for children, an acute unit for children and adolescents, and an age-segregated involuntary hospital unit for adults undergoing evaluation ordered by the Mobile Probate Court. Springhill Medical Center was founded in 1975 and is Mobile's only for-profit facility.\nSister cities.\nMobile has nine sister cities:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nExternal links.\nstyle=\"width:100%\" class=\"wraplinks\""}
{"id": "20953", "revid": "7903804", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20953", "title": "Monoamine oxidase", "text": "Family of enzymes\nMonoamine oxidases (MAO) (EC https://) are a family of enzymes that catalyze the oxidation of monoamines, employing oxygen to clip off their amine group. They are found bound to the outer membrane of mitochondria in most cell types of the body. The first such enzyme was discovered in 1928 by Mary Bernheim in the liver and was named tyramine oxidase. The MAOs belong to the protein family of flavin-containing amine oxidoreductases.\nMAOs are important in the breakdown of monoamines ingested in food, and also serve to inactivate monoamine neurotransmitters. Because of the latter, they are involved in a number of psychiatric and neurological diseases, some of which can be treated with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) which block the action of MAOs.\nSubtypes and tissue distribution.\nIn humans there are two types of MAO: MAO-A and MAO-B.\nMAO-A appears at roughly 80% of adulthood levels at birth, increasing very slightly after the first 4 years of life, while MAO-B is almost non-detectable in the infant brain. Regional distribution of the monoamine oxidases is characterized by extremely high levels of both MAOs in the hypothalamus and hippocampal uncus, as well as a large amount of MAO-B with very little MAO-A in the striatum and globus pallidus. The cortex has relatively high levels of only MAO-A, with the exception of areas of the cingulate cortex, which contains a balance of both. Autopsied brains demonstrated the predicted increased concentration of MAO-A in regions dense in serotonergic neurotransmission, however MAO-B only correlated with norepinephrine.\nOther studies, in which the activities of MAO (not protein amounts) were examined in rat brain, revealed the highest MAO-B activity in the median eminence of hypothalamus. Dorsal raphe nucleus and medial preoptic area have relatively high MAO-B activity, but much lower than MAO-B activity in the median eminence. Among cerebral endocrine glands, pineal gland has high MAO-B activity (its median value is lower than that for median eminence and higher than that for medial preoptic area). Pituitary has the lowest level of MAO-B activity when compared with brain areas studied.\nFunction.\nMonoamine oxidases catalyze the oxidative deamination of monoamines. In the first part of the reaction, cofactor FAD oxidizes the substrate yielding the corresponding imine which converts the cofactor into its reduced form FADH2. The imine is then non-enzymatically hydrolyzed to the corresponding ketone (or aldehyde) and ammonia. Oxygen is used to restore the reduced FADH2 cofactor back to the active FAD form. Monoamine oxidases contain the covalently bound cofactor FAD and are, thus, classified as flavoproteins. Monoamine oxidase A and B share roughly 70% of their structure and both have substrate binding sites that are predominantly hydrophobic. Two tyrosine residues (398, 435 within MAO-B, 407 and 444 within MAO-A) in the binding pocket that are commonly involved in inhibitor activity have been hypothesized to be relevant to orienting substrates, and mutations of these residues are relevant to mental health. Four main models have been proposed for the mechanism of electron transfer (single electron transfer, hydrogen atom transfer, nucleophilic model, and hydride transfer) although there is insufficient evidence to support any of them.\nIn 2021, it was discovered that MAO-B does not mediate dopamine catabolism in the rodent striatum but instead participates in striatal \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA) synthesis from putrescine and that synthesized GABA in turn inhibits dopaminergic neurons in this brain area. It has been found that MAO-B, via the putrescine pathway, importantly mediates GABA synthesis in astrocytes in various brain areas, including in the hippocampus, cerebellum, striatum, cerebral cortex, and substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc). These findings may warrant a rethinking of the actions of MAO-B inhibitors in the treatment of Parkinson's disease.\nSubstrates and specificities.\nMonoamine oxidases are well known enzymes in pharmacology, since they are the target for the action of a number of monoamine oxidase inhibitor drugs. MAO-A is particularly important in the catabolism of monoamines ingested in food. Both MAOs are also vital to the inactivation of monoamine neurotransmitters, for which they display different specificities.\nSpecific reactions catalyzed by MAO include:\nOther endogenous substrates of MAO include telemethylhistamine, a metabolite of histamine, and \"N\"-acetylputrescine, a metabolite of putrescine and a precursor and metabolic intermediate in a minor metabolic pathway resulting in the synthesis of \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA).\nBesides endogenous compounds, a variety of exogenous compounds and drugs are substrates of the MAOs. Examples include substituted phenethylamine sympathomimetics and sympatholytics like phenylephrine, propranolol, and pronethalol, substituted tryptamine serotonergic agents like dimethyltryptamine (DMT), 5-MeO-DMT, bufotenin, almotriptan, rizatriptan, and sumatriptan, and other compounds like bicifadine, citalopram, CP-409092, KW-2449, milacemide, MPTP, nomifensine, primaquine, rivaroxaban, sertraline, and ticlopidine, among others. Haloperidol is another possible substrate of MAO, which may contribute to formation of its neurotoxic metabolite HPP+.\nClinical significance.\nBecause of the vital role that MAOs play in the inactivation of neurotransmitters, MAO dysfunction (too much or too little MAO activity) is thought to contribute to a number of psychiatric and neurological disorders. Unusually high or low levels of MAOs in the body have been associated with schizophrenia, depression, attention deficit disorder, substance abuse, migraines, and irregular sexual maturation. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors are one of the major classes of drug prescribed for the treatment of depression, although they are often last-line treatment due to risk of the drug's interaction with diet or other drugs. Excessive levels of catecholamines (epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine) may lead to a hypertensive crisis, and excessive levels of serotonin may lead to serotonin syndrome.\nIn fact, MAO-A inhibitors act as antidepressant and anti-anxiety agents, whereas MAO-B inhibitors are used alone or in combination to treat Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Some research suggests that certain phenotypes of depression, such as those with anxiety, and \"atypical\" symptoms involving psychomotor retardation, weight gain and interpersonal sensitivity respond better to MAO inhibitors than other classes of anti-depressant. However the findings related to this have not been consistent. MAOIs may be effective in treatment resistant depression, especially when it does not respond to tricyclic antidepressants.\nParasite interactions.\nSleeping sickness - caused by trypanosomes - gets its name from the sleep disruption it causes in mammals. That sleep disruption is caused, at least in part, by trypanosomes' tendency to disrupt MAO activity in the orexin system.\nAnimal models.\nThere are significant differences in MAO activity in different species. Dopamine is primarily deaminated by MAO-A in rats, but by MAO-B in vervet monkeys and humans.\nMice unable to produce either MAO-A or MAO-B display autistic-like traits. These knockout mice display an increased response to stress.\nArthropods.\nInsects.\nInsect brains express MAOs, and some insecticides work by inhibiting them. An MAOI effect is especially important for chlordimeform (although one result shows little or no effect in \"Periplaneta americana\"); and dieldrin may or may not be an MAOI in \"Locusta migratoria\".\nAcari.\nMAO activity has been detected in \"Rhipicephalus microplus\" and chlordimeform is an MAOI in \"R. m.\".\nGenetics.\nThe genes encoding MAO-A and MAO-B are located side-by-side on the short arm of the X chromosome, and have about 70% sequence similarity. Rare mutations in the gene are associated with Brunner syndrome.\nA study based on the Dunedin cohort concluded that maltreated children with a low-activity polymorphism in the promoter region of the MAO-A gene were more likely to develop antisocial conduct disorders than maltreated children with the high-activity variant. Out of the 442 total males in the study (maltreated or not), 37% had the low activity variant. Of the 13 maltreated males with low MAO-A activity, 11 had been assessed as exhibiting adolescent conduct disorder and 4 were convicted for violent offenses. The suggested mechanism for this effect is the decreased ability of those with low MAO-A activity to quickly degrade norepinephrine, the synaptic neurotransmitter involved in sympathetic arousal and rage. This is argued to provide direct support for the idea that genetic susceptibility to disease is not determined at birth, but varies with exposure to environmental influences. However, most individuals with conduct disorder or convictions did not have low activity of MAO-A; maltreatment was found to have caused stronger predisposition for antisocial behavior than differences in MAO-A activity.\nThe claim that an interaction between low MAO-A activity and maltreatment would cause anti-social behavior has been criticized since the predisposition towards anti-social behavior could equally well have been caused by \"other\" genes inherited from abusive parents.\nA possible link between predisposition to novelty seeking and a genotype of the MAO-A gene has been found.\nA particular variant (or genotype), dubbed \"warrior gene\" in the popular press, was over-represented in M\u0101ori. This supported earlier studies finding different proportions of variants in different ethnic groups. This is the case for many genetic variants, with 33% White/Non-Hispanic, 61% Asian/Pacific Islanders having the low-activity MAO-A promoter variant.\nAging.\nUnlike many other enzymes, MAO-B activity is increased during aging in the brain of humans and other mammals. Increased MAO-B activity was also found in the pineal gland of aging rats. This may contribute to lowered levels of monoamines in aged brain and pineal gland.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "20958", "revid": "46232118", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20958", "title": "Magna Carta", "text": "English charter of freedoms made in 1215\n (Medieval Latin for \"Great Charter\"), sometimes spelled Magna Charta, is a royal charter of rights sealed by King John of England at Runnymede, near Windsor, on 15 June 1215. First drafted by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Cardinal Stephen Langton, to make peace between the unpopular king and a group of rebel barons who demanded that the King confirm the Charter of Liberties, it promised the protection of church rights, protection for the barons from illegal imprisonment, access to swift and impartial justice, and limitations on feudal payments to the Crown, to be implemented through a council of 25 barons. Neither side stood by their commitments, and the charter was annulled by Pope Innocent III, leading to the First Barons' War.\nAfter John's death, the regency government of his young son, Henry III, reissued the document in 1216, stripped of some of its more radical content, in an unsuccessful bid to build political support for their cause. At the end of the war in 1217, it formed part of the peace treaty agreed at Lambeth, where the document acquired the name \"Magna Carta\", to distinguish it from the smaller Charter of the Forest, which was issued at the same time. Short of funds, Henry reissued the charter again in 1225 in exchange for a grant of new taxes. His son, Edward I, repeated the exercise in 1297, this time confirming it as part of England's statute law. However, Magna Carta was not unique; other legal documents of its time, both in England and beyond, made broadly similar statements of rights and limitations on the powers of the Crown. The charter became part of English political life and was typically renewed by each monarch in turn. As time went by and the fledgling Parliament of England passed new laws, it lost some of its practical significance.\nAt the end of the 16th century, there was an upsurge of interest in Magna Carta. Lawyers and historians at the time believed that there was an ancient English constitution, going back to the days of the Anglo-Saxons, that protected individual English freedoms. They argued that the Norman invasion of 1066 had overthrown these rights and that Magna Carta had been a popular attempt to restore them, making the charter an essential foundation for the contemporary powers of Parliament and legal principles such as \"habeas corpus\". Although this historical account was badly flawed, jurists such as Sir Edward Coke invoked Magna Carta extensively in the early 17th century, arguing against the divine right of kings. Both James I and his son Charles I attempted to suppress the discussion of Magna Carta. The political myth of Magna Carta as a medieval revival of ancient personal liberties persisted after the Glorious Revolution of 1688 until well into the 19th century. It influenced the early American colonists in the Thirteen Colonies and the formation of the United States Constitution, which became the supreme law of the land in the new republic of the United States.\nResearch by Victorian historians showed that the original 1215 charter had concerned the medieval relationship between the monarch and the barons, and not ordinary subjects. The majority of historians now see the interpretation of the charter as a unique and early charter of universal legal rights as a myth that was created centuries later. Despite the changes in views of historians, the charter has remained a powerful, iconic document, even after almost all of its content was repealed from the statute books in the 19th and 20th centuries. Magna Carta still forms an important symbol of liberty today, often cited by politicians and campaigners, and is held in great respect by the British and American legal communities, Lord Denning describing it in 1956 as \"the greatest constitutional document of all times\u2014the foundation of the freedom of the individual against the arbitrary authority of the despot\". In the 21st century, four exemplifications of the original 1215 charter remain in existence, two at the British Library, one at Lincoln Castle and one at Salisbury Cathedral. These are recognised by UNESCO on its Memory of the World international register. There are also a handful of the subsequent charters in public and private ownership, including copies of the 1297 charter in both the United States and Australia. The 800th anniversary of Magna Carta in 2015 included extensive celebrations and discussions, and the four original 1215 charters were displayed together at the British Library. None of the original 1215 Magna Carta is currently in force since it has been repealed; however, three clauses of the original charter are enshrined in the 1297 reissued Magna Carta and do still remain in force in England and Wales.\nHistory.\n13th century.\nBackground.\nMagna Carta originated as an unsuccessful attempt to achieve peace between royalist and rebel factions in 1215, as part of the events leading to the outbreak of the First Barons' War. England was ruled by King John, the third of the Angevin kings. Although the kingdom had a robust administrative system, the nature of government under the Angevin monarchs was ill-defined and uncertain. John and his predecessors had ruled using the principle of , or \"force and will\", taking executive and sometimes arbitrary decisions, often justified on the basis that a king was above the law. Many contemporary writers believed that monarchs should rule in accordance with the custom and the law, with the counsel of the leading members of the realm, but there was no model for what should happen if a king refused to do so.\nJohn had lost most of his ancestral lands in France to King Philip II in 1204 and had struggled to regain them for many years, raising extensive taxes on the barons to accumulate money to fight a war which ended in expensive failure in 1214. Following the defeat of his allies at the Battle of Bouvines, John had to sue for peace and pay compensation. John was already personally unpopular with many of the barons, many of whom owed money to the Crown, and little trust existed between the two sides. A triumph would have strengthened his position, but in the face of his defeat, within a few months after his return from France, John found that rebel barons in the north and east of England were organising resistance to his rule.\nThe rebels took an oath that they would \"stand fast for the liberty of the church and the realm\", and demanded that the King confirm the Charter of Liberties that had been declared by King Henry I in the previous century, and which was perceived by the barons to protect their rights. The rebel leadership was unimpressive by the standards of the time, even disreputable, but were united by their hatred of John; Robert Fitzwalter, later elected leader of the rebel barons, claimed publicly that John had attempted to rape his daughter, and was implicated in a plot to assassinate John in 1212.\nJohn held a council in London in January 1215 to discuss potential reforms, and sponsored discussions in Oxford between his agents and the rebels during the spring. Both sides appealed to Pope Innocent III for assistance in the dispute. During the negotiations, the rebellious barons produced an initial document, which historians have termed \"the Unknown Charter of Liberties\", which drew on Henry I's Charter of Liberties for much of its language; seven articles from that document later appeared in the \"Articles of the Barons\" and the subsequent charter.\nIt was John's hope that the Pope would give him valuable legal and moral support, and accordingly John played for time; the King had declared himself to be a papal vassal in 1213 and correctly believed he could count on the Pope for help. John also began recruiting mercenary forces from France, although some were later sent back to avoid giving the impression that the King was escalating the conflict. In a further move to shore up his support, John took an oath to become a crusader, a move which gave him additional political protection under church law, even though many felt the promise was insincere.\nLetters backing John arrived from the Pope in April, but by then the rebel barons had organised into a military faction. They congregated at Northampton in May and renounced their feudal ties to John, marching on London, Lincoln, and Exeter. John's efforts to appear moderate and conciliatory had been largely successful, but once the rebels held London, they attracted a fresh wave of defectors from the royalists. The King offered to submit the problem to a committee of arbitration with the Pope as the supreme arbiter, but this was not attractive to the rebels. Stephen Langton, the archbishop of Canterbury, had been working with the rebel barons on their demands, and after the suggestion of papal arbitration failed, John instructed Langton to organise peace talks.\nGreat Charter of 1215.\nJohn met the rebel leaders at Runnymede, a water-meadow on the south bank of the River Thames, on 10 June 1215. Runnymede was a traditional place for assemblies, but it was also located on neutral ground between the royal fortress of Windsor Castle and the rebel base at Staines, and offered both sides the security of a rendezvous where they were unlikely to find themselves at a military disadvantage. Here the rebels presented John with their draft demands for reform, the 'Articles of the Barons'. Stephen Langton's pragmatic efforts at mediation over the next ten days turned these incomplete demands into a charter capturing the proposed peace agreement; a few years later, this agreement was renamed Magna Carta, meaning \"Great Charter\". By 15 June, general agreement had been made on a text, and on 19 June, the rebels renewed their oaths of loyalty to John and copies of the charter were formally issued.\nAlthough, as the historian David Carpenter has noted, the charter \"wasted no time on political theory\", it went beyond simply addressing individual baronial complaints, and formed a wider proposal for political reform. It promised the protection of church rights, protection from illegal imprisonment, access to swift justice, and, most importantly, limitations on taxation and other feudal payments to the Crown, with certain forms of feudal taxation requiring baronial consent. It focused on the rights of free men\u2014in particular, the barons. The rights of serfs were included in articles 16, 20 and 28. Its style and content reflected Henry I's Charter of Liberties, as well as a wider body of legal traditions, including the royal charters issued to towns, the operations of the Church and baronial courts and European charters such as the Statute of Pamiers. Magna Carta reflected other legal documents of its time, in England and beyond, which made broadly similar statements of rights and limitations on the powers of the Crown. \nUnder what historians later labelled \"clause 61\", or the \"security clause\", a council of 25 barons would be created to monitor and ensure John's future adherence to the charter. If John did not conform to the charter within 40 days of being notified of a transgression by the council, the 25 barons were empowered by clause 61 to seize John's castles and lands until, in their judgement, amends had been made. Men were to be compelled to swear an oath to assist the council in controlling the King, but once redress had been made for any breaches, the King would continue to rule as before.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Hlist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIn one sense this was not unprecedented. Other kings had previously conceded the right of individual resistance to their subjects if the King did not uphold his obligations. Magna Carta was novel in that it set up a formally recognised means of collectively coercing the King. The historian Wilfred Warren argues that it was almost inevitable that the clause would result in civil war, as it \"was crude in its methods and disturbing in its implications\". The barons were trying to force John to keep to the charter, but clause 61 was so heavily weighted against the King that this version of the charter could not survive.\nJohn and the rebel barons did not trust each other, and neither side seriously attempted to implement the peace accord. The 25 barons selected for the new council were all rebels, chosen by the more extremist barons, and many among the rebels found excuses to keep their forces mobilised. Disputes began to emerge between the royalist faction and those rebels who had expected the charter to return lands that had been confiscated.\nClause 61 of Magna Carta contained a commitment from John that he would \"seek to obtain nothing from anyone, in our own person or through someone else, whereby any of these grants or liberties may be revoked or diminished\". Despite this, the King appealed to Pope Innocent for help in July, arguing that the charter compromised the Pope's rights as John's feudal lord. As part of the June peace deal, the barons were supposed to surrender London by 15 August, but this they refused to do. Meanwhile, instructions from the Pope arrived in August, written before the peace accord, with the result that papal commissioners excommunicated the rebel barons and suspended Langton from office in early September.\nOnce aware of the charter, the Pope responded in detail: in a letter dated 24 August and arriving in late September, he declared the charter to be \"not only shameful and demeaning but also illegal and unjust\" since John had been \"forced to accept\" it, and accordingly the charter was \"null, and void of all validity for ever\"; under threat of excommunication, the King was not to observe the charter, nor the barons try to enforce it.\nBy then, violence had broken out between the two sides. Less than three months after it had been agreed, John and the loyalist barons firmly repudiated the failed charter: the First Barons' War erupted. The rebel barons concluded that peace with John was impossible, and turned to Philip II's son, the future Louis VIII, for help, offering him the English throne. The war soon settled into a stalemate. The King became ill and died on the night of 18 October 1216, leaving the nine-year-old Henry III as his heir.\nCharters of the Welsh Princes.\nMagna Carta was the first document in which reference is made to English and Welsh law alongside one another, including the principle of the common acceptance of the lawful judgement of peers.\nChapter 56: The return of lands and liberties to Welshmen if those lands and liberties had been taken by English (and vice versa) without a law abiding judgement of their peers.\nChapter 57: The return of Gruffudd ap Llywelyn ap Iorwerth, illegitimate son of Llywelyn ap Iorwerth (Llywelyn the Great) along with other Welsh hostages which were originally taken for \"peace\" and \"good\".\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Hidden begin/styles.css\"/&gt;Lists of participants in 1215\nCounsellors named in Magna Carta.\nThe preamble to Magna Carta includes the names of the following 27 ecclesiastical and secular magnates who had counselled John to accept its terms. The names include some of the moderate reformers, notably Archbishop Stephen Langton, and some of John's loyal supporters, such as William Marshal, Earl of Pembroke. They are listed here in the order in which they appear in the charter itself:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nThe Council of Twenty-Five Barons.\nThe names of the Twenty-Five Barons appointed under clause 61 to monitor John's future conduct are not given in the charter itself, but do appear in four early sources, all seemingly based on a contemporary listing: a late-13th-century collection of law tracts and statutes, a Reading Abbey manuscript now in Lambeth Palace Library, and the and of Matthew Paris. The process of appointment is not known, but the names were drawn almost exclusively from among John's more active opponents. They are listed here in the order in which they appear in the original sources:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nExcommunicated rebels.\nIn September 1215, the papal commissioners in England\u2014Subdeacon Pandulf, Peter des Roches, Bishop of Winchester, and Simon, Abbot of Reading\u2014excommunicated the rebels, acting on instructions earlier received from Rome. A letter sent by the commissioners from Dover on 5 September to Archbishop Langton explicitly names nine senior rebel barons (all members of the Council of Twenty-Five), and six clerics numbered among the rebel ranks:\nBarons\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nClerics\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nGreat Charter of 1216.\nAlthough the Charter of 1215 was a failure as a peace treaty, it was resurrected under the new government of the young Henry III as a way of drawing support away from the rebel faction. On his deathbed, King John appointed a council of thirteen executors to help Henry reclaim the kingdom, and requested that his son be placed into the guardianship of William Marshal, one of the most famous knights in England. William knighted the boy, and Cardinal Guala Bicchieri, the papal legate to England, then oversaw his coronation at Gloucester Cathedral on 28 October.\nThe young King inherited a difficult situation, with over half of England occupied by the rebels. He had substantial support though from Guala, who intended to win the civil war for Henry and punish the rebels. Guala set about strengthening the ties between England and the Papacy, starting with the coronation itself, during which Henry gave homage to the Papacy, recognising the Pope as his feudal lord. Pope Honorius III declared that Henry was the Pope's vassal and ward, and that the legate had complete authority to protect Henry and his kingdom. As an additional measure, Henry took the cross, declaring himself a crusader and thereby entitled to special protection from Rome.\nThe war was not going well for the loyalists, but Prince Louis and the rebel barons were also finding it difficult to make further progress. John's death had defused some of the rebel concerns, and the royal castles were still holding out in the occupied parts of the country. Henry's government encouraged the rebel barons to come back to his cause in exchange for the return of their lands, and reissued a version of the 1215 Charter, albeit having first removed some of the clauses, including those unfavourable to the Papacy and clause 61, which had set up the council of barons. The move was not successful, and opposition to Henry's new government hardened.\nGreat Charter of 1217.\nIn February 1217, Louis set sail for France to gather reinforcements. In his absence, arguments broke out between Louis' French and English followers, and Cardinal Guala declared that Henry's war against the rebels was the equivalent of a religious crusade. This declaration resulted in a series of defections from the rebel movement, and the tide of the conflict swung in Henry's favour. Louis returned at the end of April, but his northern forces were defeated by William Marshal at the Battle of Lincoln in May.\nMeanwhile, support for Louis' campaign was diminishing in France, and he concluded that the war in England was lost. He negotiated terms with Cardinal Guala, under which Louis would renounce his claim to the English throne. In return, his followers would be given back their lands, any sentences of excommunication would be lifted, and Henry's government would promise to enforce the charter of the previous year. The proposed agreement soon began to unravel amid claims from some loyalists that it was too generous towards the rebels, particularly the clergy who had joined the rebellion.\nIn the absence of a settlement, Louis stayed in London with his remaining forces, hoping for the arrival of reinforcements from France. When the expected fleet arrived in August, it was intercepted and defeated by loyalists at the Battle of Sandwich. Louis entered into fresh peace negotiations. The factions came to agreement on the final Treaty of Lambeth, also known as the Treaty of Kingston, on 12 and 13 September 1217.\nThe treaty was similar to the first peace offer, but excluded the rebel clergy, whose lands and appointments remained forfeit. It included a promise that Louis' followers would be allowed to enjoy their traditional liberties and customs, referring back to the Charter of 1216. Louis left England as agreed. He joined the Albigensian Crusade in the south of France, bringing the war to an end.\nA great council was called in October and November to take stock of the post-war situation. This council is thought to have formulated and issued the Charter of 1217. The charter resembled that of 1216, although some additional clauses were added to protect the rights of the barons over their feudal subjects, and the restrictions on the Crown's ability to levy taxation were watered down. There remained a range of disagreements about the management of the royal forests, which involved a special legal system that had resulted in a source of considerable royal revenue. Complaints existed over both the implementation of these courts, and the geographic boundaries of the royal forests.\nA complementary charter, the Charter of the Forest, was created, pardoning existing forest offences, imposing new controls over the forest courts, and establishing a review of the forest boundaries. To distinguish the two charters, the term (\"the great charter of liberties\") was used by the scribes to refer to the larger document, which in time became known simply as Magna Carta.\nGreat Charter of 1225.\nMagna Carta became increasingly embedded into English political life during Henry III's minority. As the King grew older, his government slowly began to recover from the civil war, regaining control of the counties and beginning to raise revenue once again, taking care not to overstep the terms of the charters. Henry remained a minor and his government's legal ability to make permanently binding decisions on his behalf was limited. In 1223, the tensions over the status of the charters became clear in the royal court, when Henry's government attempted to reassert its rights over its properties and revenues in the counties, facing resistance from many communities that argued\u2014if sometimes incorrectly\u2014that the charters protected the new arrangements.\nThis resistance resulted in an argument between Archbishop Langton and William Brewer over whether the King had any duty to fulfil the terms of the charters, given that he had been forced to agree to them. On this occasion, Henry gave oral assurances that he considered himself bound by the charters, enabling a royal inquiry into the situation in the counties to progress.\nIn 1225, the question of Henry's commitment to the charters re-emerged, when Louis VIII of France invaded Henry's remaining provinces in France, Poitou and Gascony. Henry's army in Poitou was under-resourced, and the province quickly fell. It became clear that Gascony would also fall unless reinforcements were sent from England. In early 1225, a great council approved a tax of \u00a340,000 to dispatch an army, which quickly retook Gascony. In exchange for agreeing to support Henry, the barons demanded that the King reissue Magna Carta and the Charter of the Forest. The content was almost identical to the 1217 versions, but in the new versions, the King declared that the charters were issued of his own \"spontaneous and free will\" and confirmed them with the royal seal, giving the new Great Charter and the Charter of the Forest of 1225 much more authority than the previous versions.\nThe barons anticipated that the King would act in accordance with these charters, subject to the law and moderated by the advice of the nobility. Uncertainty continued, and in 1227, when he was declared of age and able to rule independently, Henry announced that future charters had to be issued under his own seal. This brought into question the validity of the previous charters issued during his minority, and Henry actively threatened to overturn the Charter of the Forest unless the taxes promised in return for it were actually paid. In 1253, Henry confirmed the charters once again in exchange for taxation.\nHenry placed a symbolic emphasis on rebuilding royal authority, but his rule was relatively circumscribed by Magna Carta. He generally acted within the terms of the charters, which prevented the Crown from taking extrajudicial action against the barons, including the fines and expropriations that had been common under his father, John. The charters did not address the sensitive issues of the appointment of royal advisers and the distribution of patronage, and they lacked any means of enforcement if the King chose to ignore them. The inconsistency with which he applied the charters over the course of his rule alienated many barons, even those within his own faction.\nDespite the various charters, the provision of royal justice was inconsistent and driven by the needs of immediate politics: sometimes action would be taken to address a legitimate baronial complaint, while on other occasions the problem would simply be ignored. The royal courts, which toured the country to provide justice at the local level, typically for lesser barons and the gentry claiming grievances against major lords, had little power, allowing the major barons to dominate the local justice system. Henry's rule became lax and careless, resulting in a reduction in royal authority in the provinces and, ultimately, the collapse of his authority at court.\nIn 1258, a group of barons seized power from Henry in a \"coup d'\u00e9tat\", citing the need to strictly enforce Magna Carta and the Charter of the Forest, creating a new baronial-led government to advance reform through the Provisions of Oxford. The barons were not militarily powerful enough to win a decisive victory, and instead appealed to Louis IX of France in 1263\u20131264 to arbitrate on their proposed reforms. The reformist barons argued their case based on Magna Carta, suggesting that it was inviolable under English law and that the King had broken its terms.\nLouis came down firmly in favour of Henry, but the French arbitration failed to achieve peace as the rebellious barons refused to accept the verdict. England slipped back into the Second Barons' War, which was won by Henry's son, the Lord Edward. Edward also invoked Magna Carta in advancing his cause, arguing that the reformers had taken matters too far and were themselves acting against Magna Carta. In a conciliatory gesture after the barons had been defeated, in 1267 Henry issued the Statute of Marlborough, which included a fresh commitment to observe the terms of Magna Carta.\nWitnesses in 1225.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Hidden begin/styles.css\"/&gt;Witnesses to the 1225 charter\nThe following 65 individuals were witnesses to the 1225 issue of Magna Carta, named in the order in which they appear in the charter itself:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nGreat Charter of 1297.\nKing Edward I reissued the Charters of 1225 in 1297 in return for a new tax. It is this version which remains on the statute book today, although with most articles now repealed.\nThe (\"Confirmation of Charters\") was issued in Norman French by Edward I in 1297. Edward, needing money, had taxed the nobility, and they had armed themselves against him, forcing Edward to issue his confirmation of Magna Carta and the Forest Charter to avoid civil war. The nobles had sought to add another document, the , to Magna Carta. Edward I's government was not prepared to concede this, they agreed to the issuing of the , confirming the previous charters and confirming the principle that taxation should be by consent, although the precise manner of that consent was not laid down.\nA passage mandates that copies shall be distributed in \"cathedral churches throughout our realm, there to remain, and shall be read before the people two times by the year\", hence the permanent installation of a copy in Salisbury Cathedral. In the Confirmation's second article, it is confirmed that:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;...if any judgement be given from henceforth contrary to the points of the charters aforesaid by the justices, or by any other our ministers that hold plea before them against the points of the charters, it shall be undone, and holden for nought.\nGreat Charter of 1300.\nWith the reconfirmation of the charters in 1300, an additional document was granted, the (\"The Articles upon the Charters\"). It was composed of 17 articles and sought in part to deal with the problem of enforcing the charters. Magna Carta and the Forest Charter were to be issued to the sheriff of each county, and should be read four times a year at the meetings of the county courts. Each county should have a committee of three men who could hear complaints about violations of the Charters.\nPope Clement V continued the papal policy of supporting monarchs (who ruled by divine grace) against any claims in Magna Carta which challenged the King's rights, and annulled the in 1305. Edward I interpreted Clement V's papal bull annulling the as effectively applying to the , although the latter was not specifically mentioned. In 1306 Edward I took the opportunity given by the Pope's backing to reassert forest law over large areas which had been \"disafforested\". Both Edward and the Pope were accused by some contemporary chroniclers of \"perjury\", and it was suggested by Robert McNair Scott that Robert the Bruce refused to make peace with Edward I's son, Edward II, in 1312 with the justification: \"How shall the king of England keep faith with me, since he does not observe the sworn promises made to his liege men\u00a0...\".\nMagna Carta's influence on English medieval law.\nThe Great Charter was referred to in legal cases throughout the medieval period. For example, in 1226, the knights of Lincolnshire argued that their local sheriff was changing customary practice regarding the local courts, \"contrary to their liberty which they ought to have by the charter of the lord king\". In practice, cases were not brought against the King for breach of Magna Carta and the Forest Charter, but it was possible to bring a case against the King's officers, such as his sheriffs, using the argument that the King's officers were acting contrary to liberties granted by the King in the charters.\nIn addition, medieval cases referred to the clauses in Magna Carta which dealt with specific issues such as wardship and dower, debt collection, and keeping rivers free for navigation. Even in the 13th century, some clauses of Magna Carta rarely appeared in legal cases, either because the issues concerned were no longer relevant, or because Magna Carta had been superseded by more relevant legislation. By 1350 half the clauses of Magna Carta were no longer actively used.\n14th\u201315th centuries.\nDuring the reign of King Edward III six measures, later known as the \"Six Statutes\", were passed between 1331 and 1369. They sought to clarify certain parts of the Charters. In particular the third statute, in 1354, redefined clause 29, with \"free man\" becoming \"no man, of whatever estate or condition he may be\", and introduced the phrase \"due process of law\" for \"lawful judgement of his peers or the law of the land\".\nBetween the 13th and 15th centuries Magna Carta was reconfirmed 32 times according to Sir Edward Coke, and possibly as many as 45 times. Often the first item of parliamentary business was a public reading and reaffirmation of the Charter, and, as in the previous century, parliaments often exacted confirmation of it from the monarch. The Charter was confirmed in 1423 by King Henry VI.\nBy the mid-15th century, Magna Carta ceased to occupy a central role in English political life, as monarchs reasserted authority and powers which had been challenged in the 100 years after Edward I's reign. The Great Charter remained a text for lawyers, particularly as a protector of property rights, and became more widely read than ever as printed versions circulated and levels of literacy increased.\n16th century.\nDuring the 16th century, the interpretation of Magna Carta and the First Barons' War shifted. Henry VII took power at the end of the turbulent Wars of the Roses, followed by Henry VIII, and extensive propaganda under both rulers promoted the legitimacy of the regime, the illegitimacy of any sort of rebellion against royal power, and the priority of supporting the Crown in its arguments with the Papacy.\nTudor historians rediscovered the Barnwell chronicler, who was more favourable to King John than other 13th-century texts, and, as historian Ralph Turner describes, they \"viewed King John in a positive light as a hero struggling against the papacy\", showing \"little sympathy for the Great Charter or the rebel barons\". Pro-Catholic demonstrations during the 1536 uprising cited Magna Carta, accusing the King of not giving it sufficient respect.\nThe first mechanically printed edition of Magna Carta was probably the of 1508 by Richard Pynson, although the early printed versions of the 16th century incorrectly attributed the origins of Magna Carta to Henry III and 1225, rather than to John and 1215, and accordingly worked from the later text. An abridged English-language edition was published by John Rastell in 1527.\nThomas Berthelet, Pynson's successor as the royal printer during 1530\u20131547, printed an edition of the text along with other \"ancient statutes\" in 1531 and 1540.\nIn 1534, George Ferrers published the first unabridged English-language edition of Magna Carta, dividing the Charter into 37 numbered clauses.\nThe mid-sixteenth century funerary monument Sir Rowland Hill of Soulton, placed in St Stephens Wallbroke, included a full statue of the Tudor statesman and judge holding a copy of Magna Carta. Hill was a Mercer and a Lord Mayor of London; both of these statuses were shared with Serlo the Mercer who was a negotiator and enforcer of Magna Carta. The original monument was lost in the Great Fire of London, but it was restated on a 110 foot tall column on his family's estates in Shropshire.\nAt the end of the 16th century, there was an upsurge in antiquarian interest in Magna Carta in England. Legal historians concluded that there was a set of ancient English customs and laws which had been temporarily overthrown by the Norman invasion of 1066, and been recovered in 1215 and recorded in Magna Carta, which in turn gave authority to important 16th-century legal principles. Modern historians regard this narrative as fundamentally incorrect, and many refer to it as a \"myth\".\nThe antiquarian William Lambarde published what he believed were the Anglo-Saxon and Norman law codes, tracing the origins of the 16th-century English Parliament back to this period, but he misinterpreted the dates of many documents concerned. Francis Bacon argued that clause 39 of Magna Carta was the basis of the 16th-century jury system and judicial processes. Antiquarians Robert Beale, James Morice and Richard Cosin argued that Magna Carta was a statement of liberty and a fundamental, supreme law empowering English government. Those who questioned these conclusions, including the Member of Parliament Arthur Hall, faced sanctions.\n17th\u201318th centuries.\nPolitical tensions.\nWith the accession of James VI of Scotland of the House of Stuart to the English throne in 1603, when Elizabeth I of England died childless ending the Tudor dynasty, he became James of England, ruling each kingdom separately in a composite monarchy. There were separate parliaments in each kingdom and separate legal traditions. James believed in the divine right of kings and had ruled Scotland without limits on his power. In England under the Stuart kings, Magna Carta became increasingly important as a political document in arguments over the authority of the English monarchy. James I and Charles I both propounded greater authority for the Crown, justified by the doctrine of the divine right of kings, and Magna Carta was cited extensively by their opponents to challenge the monarchy.\nMagna Carta, it was argued, recognised and protected the liberty of individual Englishmen, made the King subject to the common law of the land, formed the origin of the trial by jury system, and acknowledged the ancient origins of Parliament: because of Magna Carta and this ancient constitution, an English monarch was unable to alter these long-standing English customs. Although the arguments based on Magna Carta were historically inaccurate, they nonetheless carried symbolic power, as the charter had immense significance during this period; antiquarians such as Sir Henry Spelman described it as \"the most majestic and a sacrosanct anchor to English Liberties\".\nSir Edward Coke was a leader in using Magna Carta as a political tool during this period. Still working from the 1225 version of the text \u2013 the first printed copy of the 1215 charter only emerged in 1610 \u2013 Coke spoke and wrote about Magna Carta repeatedly. His work was challenged at the time by Lord Ellesmere, and modern historians such as Ralph Turner and Claire Breay have critiqued Coke as \"misconstruing\" the original charter \"anachronistically and uncritically\", and taking a \"very selective\" approach to his analysis. More sympathetically, J. C. Holt noted that the history of the charters had already become \"distorted\" by the time Coke was carrying out his work.\nIn 1621, a bill was presented to Parliament to renew Magna Carta; although this bill failed, lawyer John Selden argued during Darnell's Case in 1627 that the right of \"habeas corpus\" was backed by Magna Carta. Coke supported the Petition of Right in 1628, which cited Magna Carta in its preamble, attempting to extend the provisions, and to make them binding on the judiciary. The monarchy responded by arguing that the historical legal situation was much less clear-cut than was being claimed, restricted the activities of antiquarians, arrested Coke for treason, and suppressed his proposed book on Magna Carta. Charles initially did not agree to the Petition of Right, and refused to confirm Magna Carta in any way that would reduce his independence as King.\nEngland descended into civil war in the 1640s, resulting in Charles I's execution in 1649. Under the republic that followed, some questioned whether Magna Carta, an agreement with a monarch, was still relevant. An anti-Cromwellian pamphlet published in 1660, \"The English devil\", said that the nation had been \"compelled to submit to this Tyrant Nol or be cut off by him; nothing but a word and a blow, his Will was his Law; tell him of Magna Carta, he would lay his hand on his sword and cry Magna Farta\". In a 2005 speech the Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales, Lord Woolf, repeated the claim that Cromwell had referred to Magna Carta as \"Magna Farta\".\nThe radical groups that flourished during this period held differing opinions of Magna Carta. The Levellers rejected history and law as presented by their contemporaries, holding instead to an \"anti-Normanism\" viewpoint. John Lilburne, for example, argued that Magna Carta contained only some of the freedoms that had supposedly existed under the Anglo-Saxons before being crushed by the Norman yoke. The Leveller Richard Overton described the charter as \"a beggarly thing containing many marks of intolerable bondage\".\nBoth saw Magna Carta as a useful declaration of liberties that could be used against governments they disagreed with. Gerrard Winstanley, the leader of the more extreme Diggers, stated \"the best lawes that England hath, [viz., Magna Carta] were got by our Forefathers importunate petitioning unto the kings that still were their Task-masters; and yet these best laws are yoaks and manicles, tying one sort of people to be slaves to another; Clergy and Gentry have got their freedom, but the common people still are, and have been left servants to work for them.\"\nGlorious Revolution.\nThe first attempt at a proper historiography was undertaken by Robert Brady, who refuted the supposed antiquity of Parliament and belief in the immutable continuity of the law. Brady contended that the liberties of the Charter were limited and argued that the liberties were the grant of the monarch. By putting Magna Carta in historical context, he cast doubt on its contemporary political relevance. Brady's historical interpretation did not survive the Glorious Revolution, which ousted the Stuart monarch James II. According to the historian J. G. A. Pocock, that \"marked a setback for the course of English historiography.\"\nIn the Whig interpretation of history, the Glorious Revolution was an example of reclaiming ancient liberties. Reinforced with Lockean concepts, the Whigs believed England's constitution to be a social contract, based on documents such as Magna Carta, the Petition of Right, and the Bill of Rights. The \"English Liberties\" (1680, in later versions often \"British Liberties\") by the Whig writer Henry Care (d. 1688) was a polemical and influential work that was much-reprinted, in the American colonies as well as Britain. It placed Magna Carta central to the history and the contemporary legitimacy of its subject.\nIdeas about the nature of law in general were beginning to change. In 1716, the Septennial Act was passed, which had a number of consequences. First, it showed that Parliament no longer considered its previous statutes unassailable, as it provided for a maximum parliamentary term of seven years, whereas the Triennial Act (1694) (enacted less than a quarter of a century previously) had provided for a maximum term of three years. It also greatly extended the powers of Parliament. Under this new constitution, monarchical absolutism was replaced by parliamentary supremacy. It was quickly realised that Magna Carta stood in the same relation to the King-in-Parliament as it had to the King without Parliament. This supremacy was challenged by Granville Sharp, who regarded Magna Carta as a fundamental part of the constitution, and maintained that it would be treason to repeal any part of it. He also held that the Charter prohibited slavery.\nSir William Blackstone published a critical edition of the 1215 Charter in 1759, and gave it the numbering system still used today. In 1763, Member of Parliament John Wilkes was arrested for writing an inflammatory pamphlet, \"No. 45, 23 April 1763\", citing Magna Carta throughout. Lord Camden denounced the treatment of Wilkes as a contravention of Magna Carta. Thomas Paine, whose 1776 pamphlet \"Common Sense\" had played an important role in the American Revolution, disregarded Magna Carta and the Bill of Rights in his \"Rights of Man\", arguing that they were not a written constitution devised by elected representatives.\nUse in the Thirteen Colonies and the United States.\nWhen English colonists left for the New World, they brought royal charters that established the colonies. The Massachusetts Bay Company charter, for example, stated that the colonists would \"have and enjoy all liberties and immunities of free and natural subjects.\" The Virginia Charter of 1606, which was largely drafted by Sir Edward Coke, stated that the colonists would have the same \"liberties, franchises and immunities\" as people born in England. The Massachusetts Body of Liberties contained similarities to clause 29 of Magna Carta; when drafting it, the Massachusetts General Court viewed Magna Carta as the chief embodiment of English common law. The other colonies would follow their example. In 1638, Maryland sought to recognise Magna Carta as part of the law of the province, but the request was denied by Charles I.\nIn 1687, William Penn published \"The Excellent Privilege of Liberty and Property: being the birth-right of the Free-Born Subjects of England\", which contained the first copy of Magna Carta printed on American soil. Penn's comments reflected Coke's, indicating a belief that Magna Carta was a fundamental law. The colonists drew on English law books, leading them to an anachronistic interpretation of Magna Carta, believing that it guaranteed trial by jury and \"habeas corpus\".\nThe development of parliamentary supremacy in the British Isles did not constitutionally affect the Thirteen Colonies, which retained an adherence to English common law, but it directly affected the relationship between Britain and the colonies. When American colonists fought against Britain, they were fighting not so much for new freedom, but to preserve liberties and rights that they believed to be enshrined in Magna Carta.\nIn the late 18th century, the United States Constitution became the supreme law of the land, recalling the manner in which Magna Carta had come to be regarded as fundamental law. The Constitution's Fifth Amendment guarantees that \"no person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law\", a phrase that was derived from Magna Carta. In addition, the Constitution included a similar writ in the Suspension Clause, Article 1, Section 9: \"The privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in cases of rebellion or invasion, the public safety may require it.\"\nEach of these proclaim that no person may be imprisoned or detained without evidence that he or she committed a crime. The Ninth Amendment states that \"The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.\" The writers of the U.S. Constitution wished to ensure that the rights they already held, such as those that they believed were provided by Magna Carta, would be preserved unless explicitly curtailed.\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has explicitly referenced Edward Coke's analysis of Magna Carta as an antecedent of the Sixth Amendment's right to a speedy trial.\n19th\u201321st centuries.\nInterpretation.\nInitially, the Whig interpretation of Magna Carta and its role in constitutional history remained dominant during the 19th century. The historian William Stubbs's \"Constitutional History of England\", published in the 1870s, formed the high-water mark of this view. Stubbs argued that Magna Carta had been a major step in the shaping of the English nation, and he believed that the barons at Runnymede in 1215 were not just representing the nobility, but the people of England as a whole, standing up to a tyrannical ruler in the form of King John.\nThis view of Magna Carta began to recede. The late-Victorian jurist and historian Frederic William Maitland provided an alternative academic history in 1899, which began to return Magna Carta to its historical roots. In 1904, Edward Jenks published an article entitled \"The Myth of Magna Carta\", which undermined the previously accepted view of Magna Carta. Historians such as Albert Pollard agreed with Jenks in concluding that Edward Coke had largely \"invented\" the myth of Magna Carta in the 17th century; these historians argued that the 1215 charter had not referred to liberty for the people at large, but rather to the protection of baronial rights.\nThis view also became popular in wider circles, and in 1930 Sellar and Yeatman published their parody on English history, \"1066 and All That\", in which they mocked the supposed importance of Magna Carta and its promises of universal liberty: \"Magna Charter was therefore the chief cause of Democracy in England, and thus a \"Good Thing\" for everyone (except the Common People)\".\nIn many literary representations of the medieval past, however, Magna Carta remained a foundation of English national identity. Some authors used the medieval roots of the document as an argument to preserve the social status quo, while others pointed to Magna Carta to challenge perceived economic injustices. The Baronial Order of Magna Charta was formed in 1898 to promote the ancient principles and values felt to be displayed in Magna Carta. The legal profession in England and the United States continued to hold Magna Carta in high esteem; they were instrumental in forming the Magna Carta Society in 1922 to protect the meadows at Runnymede from development in the 1920s, and in 1957, the American Bar Association erected the Magna Carta Memorial at Runnymede. The prominent lawyer Lord Denning described Magna Carta in 1956 as \"the greatest constitutional document of all times\u2014the foundation of the freedom of the individual against the arbitrary authority of the despot\".\nRepeal of articles and constitutional influence.\nRadicals such as Sir Francis Burdett believed that Magna Carta could not be repealed, but in the 19th century clauses which were obsolete or had been superseded began to be repealed. The repeal of clause 26 in 1829, by the Offences Against the Person Act 1828 (9 Geo. 4. c. 31 s. 1) was the first time a clause of Magna Carta was repealed. Over the next 140 years, nearly the whole of Magna Carta (1297) as statute was repealed, leaving just clauses 1, 9 and 29 still in force (in England and Wales) after 1969. Most of the clauses were repealed in England and Wales by the Statute Law Revision Act 1863, and in modern Northern Ireland and also in the modern Republic of Ireland by the Statute Law Revision (Ireland) Act 1872.\nMany later attempts to draft constitutional forms of government trace their lineage back to Magna Carta. The British dominions, Australia and New Zealand, Canada (except Quebec), and formerly the Union of South Africa and Southern Rhodesia, reflected the influence of Magna Carta in their laws, and the Charter's effects can be seen in the laws of other states that evolved from the British Empire.\nModern legacy.\nMagna Carta continues to have a powerful iconic status in British society, being cited by politicians and lawyers in support of constitutional positions. Its perceived guarantee of trial by jury and other civil liberties, for example, led to Tony Benn's reference to the debate in 2008 over whether to increase the maximum time terrorism suspects could be held without charge from 28 to 42 days as \"the day Magna Carta was repealed\". Although rarely invoked in court in the modern era, in 2012 the Occupy London protestors attempted to use Magna Carta in resisting their eviction from St. Paul's Churchyard by the City of London. In his judgment the Master of the Rolls gave this short shrift, noting somewhat drily that although clause 29 was considered by many the foundation of the rule of law in England, he did not consider it directly relevant to the case, and that the two other surviving clauses ironically concerned the rights of the Church and the City of London and could not help the defendants.\nMagna Carta carries little legal weight in modern Britain, as most of its clauses have been repealed and relevant rights ensured by other statutes, but the historian James Holt remarks that the survival of the 1215 charter in national life is a \"reflexion of the continuous development of English law and administration\" and symbolic of the many struggles between authority and the law over the centuries. The historian W. L. Warren has observed that \"many who knew little and cared less about the content of the Charter have, in nearly all ages, invoked its name, and with good cause, for it meant more than it said\".\nIt also remains a topic of great interest to historians; Natalie Fryde characterised the charter as \"one of the holiest of cows in English medieval history\", with the debates over its interpretation and meaning unlikely to end. The majority of contemporary historians however see the interpretation of the charter as a unique and early charter of legal rights as a myth that was created centuries later. \nIn many ways still a \"sacred text\", Magna Carta is generally considered part of the uncodified constitution of the United Kingdom; in a 2005 speech, the Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales, Lord Woolf, described it as the \"first of a series of instruments that now are recognised as having a special constitutional status\". Magna Carta was reprinted in New Zealand in 1881 as one of the Imperial Acts in force there. Clause 29 of the document remains in force as part of New Zealand law.\nThe document also continues to be honoured in the United States as an antecedent of the United States Constitution and Bill of Rights. In 1976, the UK lent one of four surviving originals of the 1215 Magna Carta to the United States for their bicentennial celebrations and also donated an ornate display case for it. The original was returned after one year, but a replica and the case are still on display in the United States Capitol Crypt in Washington, D.C.\nCelebration of the 800th anniversary.\nThe 800th anniversary of the original charter occurred on 15 June 2015, and organisations and institutions planned celebratory events. The British Library brought together the four existing copies of the 1215 manuscript in February 2015 for a special exhibition. British artist Cornelia Parker was commissioned to create a new artwork, \"Magna Carta (An Embroidery)\", which was shown at the British Library between May and July 2015. The artwork is a copy of the Wikipedia article about Magna Carta (as it appeared on the document's 799th anniversary, 15 June 2014), hand-embroidered by over 200 people.\nOn 15 June 2015, a commemoration ceremony was conducted in Runnymede at the National Trust park, attended by British and American dignitaries. On the same day, Google celebrated the anniversary with a Google Doodle.\nThe copy held by Lincoln Cathedral was exhibited in the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C., from November 2014 until January 2015. A new visitor centre at Lincoln Castle was opened for the anniversary. The Royal Mint released two commemorative two-pound coins.\nIn 2014, Bury St Edmunds in Suffolk celebrated the 800th anniversary of the barons' Charter of Liberties, said to have been secretly agreed there in November 1214.\nCopies.\nPhysical format.\nNumerous copies, known as exemplifications, were made of the various charters, and many of them still survive. The documents were written in heavily abbreviated medieval Latin in clear handwriting, using quill pens on sheets of parchment made from sheep skin, approximately across. They were sealed with the royal great seal by an official called the spigurnel, equipped with a special seal press, using beeswax and resin. There were no signatures on the charter of 1215, and the barons present did not attach their own seals to it. The text was not divided into paragraphs or numbered clauses: the numbering system used today was introduced by the jurist Sir William Blackstone in 1759.\nExemplifications.\n1215 exemplifications.\nAt least thirteen original copies of the charter of 1215 were issued by the royal chancery during that year, seven in the first tranche distributed on 24 June and another six later; they were sent to county sheriffs and bishops, who were probably charged for the privilege. Slight variations exist between the surviving copies, and there was probably no single \"master copy\". Of these documents, only four survive, all held in England: two now at the British Library, one at Salisbury Cathedral, and one, the property of Lincoln Cathedral, on permanent loan to Lincoln Castle. Each of these versions is slightly different in size and text, and each is considered by historians to be equally authoritative.\nThe two 1215 charters held by the British Library, known as \"Cotton MS. Augustus II.106\" and \"Cotton Charter XIII.31A\", were acquired by the antiquarian Sir Robert Cotton in the 17th century. The first had been found by Humphrey Wyems, a London lawyer, who may have discovered it in a tailor's shop, and who gave it to Cotton in January 1629. The second was found in Dover Castle in 1630 by Sir Edward Dering. The Dering charter was traditionally thought to be the copy sent in 1215 to the Cinque Ports, but in 2015 the historian David Carpenter argued that it was more probably that sent to Canterbury Cathedral, as its text was identical to a transcription made from the Cathedral's copy of the 1215 charter in the 1290s. This copy was damaged in the Cotton library fire of 1731, when its seal was badly melted. The parchment was somewhat shrivelled but otherwise relatively unscathed. An engraved facsimile of the charter was made by John Pine in 1733. In the 1830s, an ill-judged and bungled attempt at cleaning and conservation rendered the manuscript largely illegible to the naked eye. This is the only surviving 1215 copy still to have its great seal attached.\nLincoln Cathedral's copy has been held by the county since 1215. It was displayed in the Common Chamber in the cathedral, before being moved to another building in 1846. Between 1939 and 1940 it was displayed in the British Pavilion at the 1939 World Fair in New York City, and at the Library of Congress. When the Second World War broke out, Winston Churchill wanted to give the charter to the American people, hoping that this would encourage the United States, then neutral, to enter the war against the Axis powers, but the cathedral was unwilling, and the plans were dropped.\nAfter December 1941, the copy was stored in Fort Knox, Kentucky, for safety, before being put on display again in 1944 and returned to Lincoln Cathedral in early 1946. It was put on display in 1976 in the cathedral's medieval library. It was displayed in San Francisco, and was taken out of display for a time to undergo conservation in preparation for another visit to the United States, where it was exhibited in 2007 at the Contemporary Art Center of Virginia and the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia. In 2009 it returned to New York to be displayed at the Fraunces Tavern Museum. It is currently on permanent loan to the David P. J. Ross Vault at Lincoln Castle, along with an original copy of the 1217 Charter of the Forest.\nThe fourth copy, held by Salisbury Cathedral, was first given in 1215 to its predecessor, Old Sarum Cathedral. Rediscovered by the cathedral in 1812, it has remained in Salisbury throughout its history, except when being taken off-site for restoration work. It is possibly the best preserved of the four, although small pin holes can be seen in the parchment from where it was once pinned up. The handwriting on this version is different from that of the other three, suggesting that it was not written by a royal scribe but rather by a member of the cathedral staff, who then had it exemplified by the royal court.\nIn 2009, UNESCO added these four surviving exemplars to the Memory of the World international register, recognising them as documentary heritage of global importance.\nLater exemplifications.\nOther early versions of the charters survive today. Only one exemplification of the 1216 charter survives, held in Durham Cathedral. Four copies of the 1217 charter exist; three of these are held by the Bodleian Library in Oxford and one by Hereford Cathedral. Hereford's copy is occasionally displayed alongside the Mappa Mundi in the cathedral's chained library and has survived along with a small document called the that was sent along with the charter, telling the sheriff of the county how to observe the conditions outlined in the document. One of the Bodleian's copies was displayed at San Francisco's California Palace of the Legion of Honor in 2011.\nFour exemplifications of the 1225 charter survive: the British Library holds one, which was preserved at Lacock Abbey until 1945; Durham Cathedral also holds a copy, with the Bodleian Library holding a third. The fourth exemplification of 1225 was held by the museum of the Public Record Office, and is now held by The National Archives. The Society of Antiquaries also holds a draft of the 1215 charter (discovered in 2013 in a late-13th-century register from Peterborough Abbey), a copy of the 1225 third re-issue (within an early-14th-century collection of statutes) and a roll copy of the 1225 reissue.\nFour exemplifications of the 1297 charter also survive, of which two are held outside England. One was purchased in 1952 by the Australian Government for \u00a312,500 from King's School, Bruton, England. Restored in 2024, this copy is now on display in the Members' Hall of Parliament House, Canberra. The second was originally held by the Brudenell family, earls of Cardigan, before they sold it in 1984 to the Perot Foundation in the United States, which in 2007 sold it to U.S. businessman David Rubenstein for US$21.3\u00a0million. Rubenstein commented \"I have always believed that this was an important document to our country, even though it wasn't drafted in our country. I think it was the basis for the Declaration of Independence and the basis for the Constitution\". This exemplification is now on permanent loan to the National Archives in Washington, D.C. Of the other two surviving 1297 exemplifications, one is held in the UK's National Archives, and the other in the Guildhall, London.\nEight exemplifications of the 1300 confirmation by Edward I survive, in Faversham, Oriel College, Oxford, the Bodleian Library, Durham Cathedral, Westminster Abbey, the City of London (held in the archives at the London Guildhall), Sandwich (held in the Sandwich Guildhall Museum) and Cambridge, Massachusetts (held at Harvard Law School). The Sandwich copy was rediscovered in early 2015 in a Victorian scrapbook in the town archives of Sandwich, Kent, one of the Cinque Ports. In the case of the Sandwich and Oriel College exemplifications, the copies of the Charter of the Forest originally issued with them also survive. The Harvard copy, previously thought to be an unofficial secondary copy, was identified as an original exemplification in 2025.\nClauses.\nMost of the 1215 charter and later versions sought to govern the feudal rights of the Crown over the barons. Under the Angevin kings, and in particular during John's reign, the rights of the King had frequently been used inconsistently, often in an attempt to maximise the royal income from the barons. Feudal relief was one way that a king could demand money, and clauses 2 and 3 fixed the fees payable when an heir inherited an estate or when a minor came of age and took possession of his lands.\nScutage was a form of medieval taxation. All knights and nobles owed military service to the Crown in return for their lands, which theoretically belonged to the King. Many preferred to avoid this service and offer money instead. The Crown often used the cash to pay for mercenaries. The rate of scutage that should be payable, and the circumstances under which it was appropriate for the King to demand it, was uncertain and controversial. Clauses 12 and 14 addressed the management of the process.\nThe English judicial system had altered considerably over the previous century, with the royal judges playing a larger role in delivering justice across the country. John had used his royal discretion to extort large sums of money from the barons, effectively taking payment to offer justice in particular cases, and the role of the Crown in delivering justice had become politically sensitive among the barons. Clauses 39 and 40 demanded due process be applied in the royal justice system, while clause 45 required that the King appoint knowledgeable royal officials to the relevant roles.\nAlthough these clauses did not have any special significance in the original charter, this part of Magna Carta became singled out as particularly important in later centuries. In the United States, for example, the Supreme Court of California interpreted clause 45 in 1974 as establishing a requirement in common law that a defendant faced with the potential of incarceration be entitled to a trial overseen by a legally trained judge.\nRoyal forests were economically important in medieval England and were both protected and exploited by the Crown, supplying the King with hunting grounds, raw materials, and money. They were subject to special royal jurisdiction and the resulting forest law was, according to the historian Richard Huscroft, \"harsh and arbitrary, a matter purely for the King's will\". The size of the forests had expanded under the Angevin kings, an unpopular development.\nThe 1215 charter had several clauses relating to the royal forests. Clauses 47 and 48 promised to deforest the lands added to the forests under John and investigate the use of royal rights in this area, but notably did not address the forestation of the previous kings, while clause 53 promised some form of redress for those affected by the recent changes, and clause 44 promised some relief from the operation of the forest courts. Neither Magna Carta nor the subsequent Charter of the Forest proved entirely satisfactory as a way of managing the political tensions arising in the operation of the royal forests.\nSome of the clauses addressed wider economic issues. The concerns of the barons over the treatment of their debts to Jewish moneylenders, who occupied a special position in medieval England and were by tradition under the King's protection, were addressed by clauses 10 and 11. The charter concluded this section with the phrase \"debts owing to other than Jews shall be dealt with likewise\", so it is debatable to what extent the Jews were being singled out by these clauses. Some issues were relatively specific, such as clause 33 which ordered the removal of all fishing weirs\u2014an important and growing source of revenue at the time\u2014from England's rivers.\nThe role of the English Church had been a matter for great debate in the years prior to the 1215 charter. The Norman and Angevin kings had traditionally exercised a great deal of power over the church within their territories. From the 1040s onwards successive popes had emphasised the importance of the church being governed more effectively from Rome, and had established an independent judicial system and hierarchical chain of authority. After the 1140s, these principles had been largely accepted within the English church, even if accompanied by an element of concern about centralising authority in Rome.\nThese changes brought the customary rights of lay rulers such as John over ecclesiastical appointments into question. As described above, John had come to a compromise with Pope Innocent III in exchange for his political support for the King, and clause 1 of Magna Carta prominently displayed this arrangement, promising the freedoms and liberties of the church. The importance of this clause may also reflect the role of Archbishop Langton in the negotiations: Langton had taken a strong line on this issue during his career.\nClauses in detail.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Hidden begin/styles.css\"/&gt;Magna Carta clauses in the 1215 and later charters\nClauses remaining in English law.\nOnly three clauses of Magna Carta still remain on statute in England and Wales. These clauses concern 1) the freedom of the English Church, 2) the \"ancient liberties\" of the City of London (clause 13 in the 1215 charter, clause 9 in the 1297 statute), and 3) a right to due legal process (clauses 39 and 40 in the 1215 charter, clause 29 in the 1297 statute). Using the numbering system from the 1297 statute, these clauses state that:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nClauses in force in other countries.\nClauses of Magna Carta also remain in force in several countries that were formerly British colonies. British colonies received the common and statutory law in force at a particular time in England, often through specific reception statutes or by adoption into local law. As a result chapter 29 of the 1297 Magna Carta remains in force in New Zealand and the Australian states of New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland and the Australian Capital Territory. The entirety of Magna Carta apart from chapter 26 remains in force in the Australian states of Western Australia, Tasmania, South Australia and the Northern Territory.\nExplanatory notes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is ubiquitous in elementary and analytic number theory and most often appears as part of its namesake the M\u00f6bius inversion formula. Following work of Gian-Carlo Rota in the 1960s, generalizations of the M\u00f6bius function were introduced into combinatorics, and are similarly denoted formula_2.\nDefinition.\nThe M\u00f6bius function is defined by\nformula_3\nThe M\u00f6bius function can alternatively be represented as\n formula_4\nwhere formula_5 is the Kronecker delta, formula_6 is the Liouville function, \nformula_7 is the number of distinct prime divisors of formula_8, and formula_9 is the number of prime factors of formula_8, counted with multiplicity.\nAnother characterization by Carl Friedrich Gauss is the sum of all primitive roots.\nValues.\nThe values of formula_1 for the first 50 positive numbers are\nThe first 50 values of the function are plotted below:\nLarger values can be checked in: \nApplications.\nMathematical series.\nThe Dirichlet series that generates the M\u00f6bius function is the (multiplicative) inverse of the Riemann zeta function; if formula_12 is a complex number with real part larger than 1 we have\nformula_13\nThis may be seen from its Euler product\nformula_14\nAlso:\nThe Lambert series for the M\u00f6bius function is\nformula_20\nwhich converges for formula_21. For prime formula_22, we also have\nformula_23\nAlgebraic number theory.\nGauss proved that for a prime number formula_24 the sum of its primitive roots is congruent to formula_25.\nIf formula_26 denotes the finite field of order formula_27 (where formula_27 is necessarily a prime power), then the number formula_29 of monic irreducible polynomials of degree formula_8 over formula_26 is given by\nformula_32\nThe M\u00f6bius function is used in the M\u00f6bius inversion formula.\nPhysics.\nThe M\u00f6bius function also arises in the primon gas or free Riemann gas model of supersymmetry. In this theory, the fundamental particles or \"primons\" have energies formula_33. Under second quantization, multiparticle excitations are considered; these are given by formula_34 for any natural number formula_8. This follows from the fact that the factorization of the natural numbers into primes is unique.\nIn the free Riemann gas, any natural number can occur, if the primons are taken as bosons. If they are taken as fermions, then the Pauli exclusion principle excludes squares. The operator \nformula_36 that distinguishes fermions and bosons is then none other than the M\u00f6bius function formula_1.\nThe free Riemann gas has a number of other interesting connections to number theory, including the fact that the partition function is the Riemann zeta function. This idea underlies Alain Connes's attempted proof of the Riemann hypothesis.\nProperties.\nThe M\u00f6bius function is multiplicative (i.e., \nformula_38 whenever formula_39 and formula_40 are coprime).\nProof: Given two coprime numbers formula_41, we induct on formula_42. If formula_43, then formula_44. Otherwise, formula_45, so\nformula_46\nThe sum of the M\u00f6bius function over all positive divisors of formula_8 (including formula_8 itself and 1) is zero except when formula_49:\nformula_50\nThe equality above leads to the important M\u00f6bius inversion formula and is the main reason why formula_51 is of relevance in the theory of multiplicative and arithmetic functions.\nOther applications of formula_1 in combinatorics are connected with the use of the P\u00f3lya enumeration theorem in combinatorial groups and combinatorial enumerations.\nThere is a formula for calculating the M\u00f6bius function without directly knowing the factorization of its argument:\nformula_53\ni.e. formula_1 is the sum of the primitive formula_8-th roots of unity. (However, the computational complexity of this definition is at least the same as that of the Euler product definition.)\nOther identities satisfied by the M\u00f6bius function include\nformula_56\nand\nformula_57.\nThe first of these is a classical result while the second was published in 2020. Similar identities hold for the Mertens function.\nProof of the formula for the sum of formula_51 over divisors.\nThe formula\nformula_59\ncan be written using Dirichlet convolution as:\nformula_60\nwhere formula_61 is the identity under the convolution.\nOne way of proving this formula is by noting that the Dirichlet convolution of two multiplicative functions is again multiplicative. Thus it suffices to prove the formula for powers of primes. Indeed, for any prime \nformula_24 and for any formula_63\nformula_64,\nwhile for formula_49\nformula_66.\nOther proofs.\nAnother way of proving this formula is by using the identity\nformula_67\nThe formula above is then a consequence of the fact that the formula_8th roots of unity sum to 0, since each formula_8th root of unity is a primitive formula_70th root of unity for exactly one divisor formula_70 of formula_8.\nHowever it is also possible to prove this identity from first principles. First note that it is trivially true when formula_49. Suppose then that formula_74. Then there is a bijection between the factors formula_70 of formula_8 for which formula_77 and the subsets of the set of all prime factors of formula_8. The asserted result follows from the fact that every non-empty finite set has an equal number of odd- and even-cardinality subsets.\nThis last fact can be shown easily by induction on the cardinality formula_79 of a non-empty finite set formula_80. First, if formula_81, there is exactly one odd-cardinality subset of formula_80, namely formula_80 itself, and exactly one even-cardinality subset, namely formula_84. Next, if \nformula_85, then divide the subsets of formula_80 into two subclasses depending on whether they contain or not some fixed element formula_87 in formula_80. There is an obvious bijection between these two subclasses, pairing those subsets that have the same complement relative to the subset formula_89. Also, one of these two subclasses consists of all the subsets of the set formula_90, and therefore, by the induction hypothesis, has an equal number of odd- and even-cardinality subsets. These subsets in turn correspond bijectively to the even- and odd-cardinality formula_89-containing subsets of formula_80. The inductive step follows directly from these two bijections.\nA related result is that the binomial coefficients exhibit alternating entries of odd and even power which sum symmetrically.\nAverage order.\nThe mean value (in the sense of average orders) of the M\u00f6bius function is zero. This statement is, in fact, equivalent to the prime number theorem.\nformula_1 sections.\nformula_94 if and only if formula_8 is divisible by the square of a prime. The first numbers with this property are\n4, 8, 9, 12, 16, 18, 20, 24, 25, 27, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 45, 48, 49, 50, 52, 54, 56, 60, 63, ... (sequence in the OEIS).\nIf formula_8 is prime, then formula_97, but the converse is not true. The first non prime formula_8 for which formula_97 is formula_100. The first such numbers with three distinct prime factors (sphenic numbers) are\n30, 42, 66, 70, 78, 102, 105, 110, 114, 130, 138, 154, 165, 170, 174, 182, 186, 190, 195, 222, ... (sequence in the OEIS).\nand the first such numbers with 5 distinct prime factors are\n2310, 2730, 3570, 3990, 4290, 4830, 5610, 6006, 6090, 6270, 6510, 6630, 7410, 7590, 7770, 7854, 8610, 8778, 8970, 9030, 9282, 9570, 9690, ... (sequence in the OEIS).\nMertens function.\nIn number theory another arithmetic function closely related to the M\u00f6bius function is the Mertens function, defined by\nformula_101\nfor every natural number n. This function is closely linked with the positions of zeroes of the Riemann zeta function. See the article on the Mertens conjecture for more information about the connection between formula_102 and the Riemann hypothesis.\nFrom the formula\nformula_103\nit follows that the Mertens function is given by\nformula_104\nwhere formula_105 is the Farey sequence of order formula_8.\nThis formula is used in the proof of the Franel\u2013Landau theorem.\nGeneralizations.\nIncidence algebras.\nIn combinatorics, every locally finite partially ordered set (poset) is assigned an incidence algebra. One distinguished member of this algebra is that poset's \"M\u00f6bius function\". The classical M\u00f6bius function treated in this article is essentially equal to the M\u00f6bius function of the set of all positive integers partially ordered by divisibility. See the article on incidence algebras for the precise definition and several examples of these general M\u00f6bius functions.\nPopovici's function.\nConstantin Popovici defined a generalised M\u00f6bius function \nformula_107 to be the formula_108-fold Dirichlet convolution of the M\u00f6bius function with itself. It is thus again a multiplicative function with\nformula_109\nwhere the binomial coefficient is taken to be zero if formula_110. The definition may be extended to complex formula_108 by reading the binomial as a polynomial in formula_108.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "20962", "revid": "7611264", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20962", "title": "Methadone", "text": "Opioid medication\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Infobox drug/styles.css\"/&gt;\nMethadone, sold under the brand names Dolophine and Methadose among others, is a synthetic opioid used medically to treat chronic pain and opioid use disorder. Prescribed for daily use, the medicine relieves cravings and opioid withdrawal symptoms. Withdrawal management using methadone can be accomplished in less than a month, or it may be done gradually over a longer period of time, or simply maintained for the rest of the patient's life. While a single dose has a rapid effect, maximum effect can take up to five days of use. After long-term use, in people with normal liver function, effects last 8 to 36 hours. Methadone is usually taken by mouth and rarely by injection into a muscle or vein.\nSide effects are similar to those of other opioids. These frequently include dizziness, sleepiness, nausea, vomiting, and sweating. Serious risks include opioid abuse and respiratory depression. Abnormal heart rhythms may also occur due to a prolonged QT interval. The number of deaths in the United States involving methadone poisoning declined from 4,418 in 2011 to 3,300 in 2015. Risks are greater with higher doses. Methadone is made by chemical synthesis and acts on opioid receptors.\nMethadone was developed in Germany in the late 1930s by Gustav Ehrhart and Max Bockm\u00fchl. It was approved for use as an analgesic in the United States in 1947, and has been used in the treatment of addiction since the 1960s. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nMedical uses.\nOpioid addiction.\nMethadone is used for the treatment of opioid use disorder.\nIt may be used as maintenance therapy or in shorter periods to manage opioid withdrawal symptoms. Its use for the treatment of addiction is usually strictly regulated. In the US, outpatient treatment programs must be certified by the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) and registered by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) to prescribe methadone for opioid addiction.\nA 2009 Cochrane review found methadone was effective in retaining people in treatment and the reduction or cessation of heroin use as measured by self-report and urine/hair analysis and did not affect criminal activity or risk of death.\nTreatment of opioid-dependent persons with methadone follows one of two routes: maintenance or withdrawal management. Methadone maintenance therapy (MMT) usually takes place in outpatient settings. It is usually prescribed as a single daily dose medication for those who wish to abstain from illicit opioid use. Treatment models for MMT differ. It is not uncommon for treatment recipients to be administered methadone in a specialized clinic, where they are observed for around 15\u201320 minutes post-dosing, to reduce the risk of diversion of medication.\nThe duration of methadone treatment programs ranges from a few months to years. Given opioid dependence is characteristically a chronic relapsing/remitting disorder, MMT may be lifelong. The length of time a person remains in treatment depends on a number of factors. While starting doses may be adjusted based on the amount of opioids reportedly used, most clinical guidelines suggest doses start low (e.g., at doses not exceeding 40\u00a0mg daily) and are incremented gradually. It has been found that doses of 40\u00a0mg per day were sufficient to help control the withdrawal symptoms but not enough to curb the cravings for the drug. Doses of 80 to 100\u00a0mg per day have shown higher rates of success in patients and less illicit heroin use during the maintenance therapy. However, higher doses do put a patient more at risk for overdose than a moderately low dose (e.g. 20\u00a0mg/day).\nMethadone maintenance has been shown to reduce the transmission of bloodborne viruses associated with opioid injection, such as hepatitis B and C, and/or HIV. The principal goals of methadone maintenance are to relieve opioid cravings, suppress the abstinence syndrome, and block the euphoric effects associated with opioids.\nChronic methadone dosing will eventually lead to neuroadaptation, characterised by tolerance and dependence. However, when used correctly in treatment, maintenance therapy is medically safe, non-sedating, and can provide a slow recovery from opioid addiction. Methadone has been widely used for pregnant women addicted to opioids.\nPain.\nMethadone is used as an analgesic in chronic pain, often in rotation with other opioids. Due to its activity at the NMDA receptor, it may be more effective against neuropathic pain; for the same reason, tolerance to the analgesic effects may be less than that of other opioids.\nAdverse effects.\nAdverse effects of methadone include:\nWithdrawal symptoms.\nMethadone withdrawal symptoms are reported as being significantly more protracted than withdrawal from opioids with shorter half-lives.\nWhen used for opioid maintenance therapy, Methadone is generally administered as an oral liquid. Methadone has been implicated in contributing to significant tooth decay. Methadone causes dry mouth, reducing the protective role of saliva in preventing decay. Other putative mechanisms of methadone-related tooth decay include craving for carbohydrates related to opioids, poor dental care, and a general decrease in personal hygiene. These factors, combined with sedation, have been linked to the causation of extensive dental damage.\nBlack box warning.\nMethadone has the following U.S. FDA black box warning:\nOverdose.\nMost people who overdose on methadone show some of the following symptoms:\nThe respiratory depression of an overdose can be treated with naloxone. Naloxone is preferred to the newer, longer-acting antagonist naltrexone. Despite methadone's much longer duration of action compared to heroin and other shorter-acting agonists and the need for repeat doses of the antagonist naloxone, it is still used for overdose therapy. As naltrexone has a longer half-life, it is more difficult to titrate. If too large a dose of the opioid antagonist is given to a dependent person, it will result in withdrawal symptoms (possibly severe). When using naloxone, the naloxone will be quickly eliminated and the withdrawal will be short-lived. Doses of methadone take longer to be eliminated from the person's system. A common problem in treating methadone overdoses is that given the short action of naloxone (versus the extremely longer-acting methadone), a dosage of naloxone given to a methadone-overdosed person will initially work to bring the person out of overdose, but once the naloxone wears off, if no further naloxone is administered, the person can go right back into overdose (based upon time and dosage of the methadone ingested).\nTolerance and dependence.\nAs with other opioid medications, tolerance and dependence usually develop with repeated doses. There is some clinical evidence that tolerance to analgesia is less with methadone compared to other opioids; this may be due to its activity at the NMDA receptor. Tolerance to the different physiological effects of methadone varies; tolerance to analgesic properties may or may not develop quickly, but tolerance to euphoria usually develops rapidly, whereas tolerance to constipation, sedation, and respiratory depression develops slowly (if ever).\nDriving.\nMethadone treatment may impair driving ability. Drug abusers had significantly more involvement in serious crashes than non-abusers in a study by the University of Queensland. In the study of a group of 220 drug abusers, most of them poly-drug abusers, 17 were involved in crashes killing people, compared with a control group of other people randomly selected having no involvement in fatal crashes. However, there have been multiple studies verifying the ability of methadone maintenance patients to drive. In the UK, persons who are prescribed oral methadone can continue to drive after they have satisfactorily completed an independent medical examination which will include a urine screen for drugs. The license will be issued for 12 months at a time and even then, only following a favourable assessment from their own doctor. Individuals who are prescribed methadone for either IV or IM administration cannot drive in the UK, mainly due to the increased sedation effects that this route of use can cause.\nMortality.\nIn the United States, deaths linked to methadone more than quadrupled in the five-year period between 1999 and 2004. According to the U.S. National Center for Health Statistics, as well as a 2006 series in the \"Charleston Gazette\" (West Virginia),&lt;ref name=\"http://www.wvgazette.com/section/Series/The+Killer+Cure\"&gt;http:// \"The Charleston Gazette\" 2006&lt;/ref&gt; medical examiners listed methadone as contributing to 3,849 deaths in 2004. That number was up from 790 in 1999. Approximately 82 percent of those deaths were listed as accidental, and most deaths involved combinations of methadone with other drugs (especially benzodiazepines).\nAlthough deaths from methadone are on the rise, methadone-associated deaths are not being caused primarily by methadone intended for methadone treatment programs, according to a panel of experts convened by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, which released a report titled \"Methadone-Associated Mortality, Report of a National Assessment\". The consensus report concludes that \"although the data remains incomplete, National Assessment meeting participants concurred that methadone tablets or Diskets distributed through channels other than opioid treatment programs most likely are the central factors in methadone-associated mortality.\"\nIn 2006, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued a caution about methadone, titled \"Methadone Use for Pain Control May Result in Death.\" The FDA also revised the drug's package insert. The change deleted previous information about the usual adult dosage. The \"Charleston Gazette\" reported, \"The old language about the 'usual adult dose' was potentially deadly, according to pain specialists.\"\nPharmacology.\nMethadone acts by binding to the \u03bc-opioid receptor, but also has some affinity for the NMDA receptor, an ionotropic glutamate receptor. Methadone is metabolized by CYP3A4, CYP2B6, CYP2D6, and is a substrate, or in this case target, for the P-glycoprotein efflux protein, a protein which helps pump foreign substances out of cells, in the intestines and brain. The bioavailability and elimination half-life of methadone are subject to substantial interindividual variability. Its main route of administration is oral. Adverse effects include sedation, hypoventilation, constipation, and miosis, in addition to tolerance, dependence, and withdrawal difficulties. The withdrawal period can be much more prolonged than with other opioids, spanning anywhere from two weeks to several months.\nThe metabolic half-life of methadone differs from its duration of action. The metabolic half-life is 8 to 59 hours (approximately 24 hours for opioid-tolerant people, and 55 hours for opioid-naive people), as opposed to a half-life of 1 to 5 hours for morphine. The length of the half-life of methadone allows for the exhibition of respiratory depressant effects for an extended duration of time in opioid-naive people.\nMethadone at therapeutic concentrations is known to prolong the QTc interval, which indicates that the heart muscle repolarizes more slowly. This QTc prolongation tends to increase the risk of torsades de pointes (TdP), a heart rhythm disturbance that can lead to syncope or sudden death. In a large observational study in Sweden, methadone was associated with a particularly high incidence of TdP, especially in younger patients. The incidence of TdP was 41.9 cases per 100,000 users of methadone in the 18-64 year old age group. In this study of TdP, methadone was the highest-risk drug in the 18-64 year-old group, with the sole exception of the antiarrhythmic drug amiodarone, which was associated with 66.5 cases of TdP per 100,000 amiodarone users. The high incidence of TdP in amiodarone-treated patients may indicate correlation and not causation because amiodarone is often prescribed to patients with preexisting heart conditions that independently increase the risk of TdP. Methadone likely causes cardiac arrhythmias (such as TdP) via two mechanisms. Like many other cardiotoxic drugs, methadone blocks the hERG K+ channel. The two enantiomers of methadone inhibit hERG channels with different potency. Dextromethadone, which is less potent as an opioid, is more potent at blocking the hERG channel with an IC50 of ~12 \u03bcM. Levomethadone has a lower affinity, with an IC50 of ~29\u2009\u03bcM at the hERG channel. Methadone is also known to block the Nav1.5 voltage-gated Na+ channel (SCN5A) with an IC50 of ~10 \u03bcM, which is similar to the local anesthetic bupivacaine. Both enantiomers of methadone block the Nav1.5 channel with similar affinities. Bupivacaine is especially cardiotoxic among local anesthetics, and it is believed to act via this same sodium channel. Plasma concentrations of methadone in recovering addicts can reach 4 \u03bcM during therapy, so the actions of methadone at both the hERG potassium channel and the Nav1.5 sodium channel are possibly clinically relevant in producing cardiac side effects. This also suggests that levomethadone is not completely free of cardiac toxicity.\nMechanism of action.\nLevomethadone (the \"R\"-(\u2013)-methadone enantiomer) is a \u03bc-opioid receptor agonist with higher intrinsic activity than morphine, but lower affinity. Dextromethadone (the \"S\"-(+)-methadone enantiomer) has a much lower affinity to the \u03bc-opioid receptor than levomethadone. Both enantiomers bind to the glutamatergic NMDA (\"N\"-methyl-D-aspartate) receptor, acting as noncompetitive antagonists. Methadone has been shown to reduce neuropathic pain in rat models, primarily through NMDA receptor antagonism. NMDA antagonists such as dextromethorphan, ketamine, tiletamine and ibogaine are being studied for their role in decreasing the development of tolerance to opioids and as possible for eliminating addiction/tolerance/withdrawal, possibly by disrupting memory circuitry. Acting as an NMDA antagonist may be one mechanism by which methadone decreases craving for opioids and tolerance, and has been proposed as a possible mechanism for its distinguished efficacy regarding the treatment of neuropathic pain. Methadone also acted as a potent, noncompetitive \u03b13\u03b24 neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist in rat receptors, expressed in human embryonic kidney cell lines.\nMetabolism.\nMethadone has a slow metabolism and very high fat solubility, making it longer lasting than morphine-based drugs. Methadone has a typical elimination half-life of 15 to 60 hours with a mean of around 22. However, metabolism rates vary greatly between individuals, up to a factor of 100, ranging from as few as 4 hours to as many as 130 hours, or even 190 hours. This variability is apparently due to genetic variability in the production of the associated cytochrome enzymes CYP3A4, CYP2B6 and CYP2D6. Many substances can also induce, inhibit or compete with these enzymes further affecting (sometimes dangerously) methadone half-life. A longer half-life frequently allows for administration only once a day in opioid withdrawal management and maintenance programs. People who metabolize methadone rapidly, on the other hand, may require twice daily dosing to obtain sufficient symptom alleviation while avoiding excessive peaks and troughs in their blood concentrations and associated effects. This can also allow lower total doses in some such people. The analgesic activity is shorter than the pharmacological half-life; dosing for pain control usually requires multiple doses per day normally dividing daily dosage for administration at 8-hour intervals.\nThe main metabolic pathway involves \"N\"-demethylation by CYP3A4 in the liver and intestine to give 2-ethylidene-1,5-dimethyl-3,3-diphenylpyrrolidine (EDDP). This inactive product, as well as the inactive 2-ethyl-5-methyl-3,3-diphenyl-1-pyrroline (EMDP), produced by a second \"N\"-demethylation, are detectable in the urine of those taking methadone.\nRoute of administration.\nThe most common route of administration at a methadone clinic is in a racemic oral solution, though in Germany, only the \"R\" enantiomer (the L optical isomer) has traditionally been used, as it is responsible for most of the desired opioid effects. The single-isomer form is becoming less common due to the higher production costs.\nMethadone is available in traditional pills, sublingual tablets, and two different formulations designed for the person to drink. Drinkable forms include ready-to-dispense liquid (sold in the United States as Methadose), and Diskets (known on the street as \"wafers\" or \"biscuits\") tablets which are dispersible in water for oral administration, used similarly to Alka-Seltzer. The liquid form is the most common as it allows for smaller dose changes. Methadone is almost as effective when administered orally as by injection. Oral medication is usually preferable because it offers safety, and simplicity and represents a step away from injection-based drug abuse in those recovering from addiction. U.S. federal regulations require the oral form in addiction treatment programs. Injecting methadone pills can cause collapsed veins, bruising, swelling, and possibly other harmful effects. Methadone pills often contain talc that, when injected, produces a swarm of tiny solid particles in the blood, causing numerous minor blood clots. These particles cannot be filtered out before injection, and will accumulate in the body over time, especially in the lungs and eyes, producing various complications such as pulmonary hypertension, an irreversible and progressive disease. The formulation sold under the brand name Methadose (flavored liquid suspension for oral dosing, commonly used for maintenance purposes) should not be injected either.\nInformation leaflets included in packs of UK methadone tablets state that the tablets are for oral use only and that use by any other route can cause serious harm. In addition to this warning, additives have now been included in the tablet formulation to make the use of them by the IV route more difficult.\nMethadone is also available in ampoules with strength of 50mg/ml &amp; 10mg/ml for IV/IM/SC use in the UK. Prescribing the injectable formulation was more common in the 90s with prescribers reporting that up to 9-10% of all methadone prescription were for ampoules. This practice is much less common nowadays \nChemistry.\nDetection in biological fluids.\nMethadone and its major metabolite, 2-ethylidene-1,5-dimethyl-3,3-diphenylpyrrolidine (EDDP), are often measured in urine as part of a drug abuse testing program, in plasma or serum to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized victims, or in whole blood to assist in a forensic investigation of a traffic or other criminal violation or a case of sudden death. Methadone usage history is considered in interpreting the results as a chronic user can develop tolerance to doses that would incapacitate an opioid-na\u00efve individual. Chronic users often have high methadone and EDDP baseline values.\nConformation.\nThe protonated form of methadone takes on an extended conformation, while the free base is more compact. In particular, it was found that there is an interaction between the tertiary amine and the carbonyl carbon of the ketone function (R3N \u2022\u2022\u2022 &gt;C=O) that limits the molecule's conformation freedom, though the distance (291 pm by X-ray) is far too long to represent a true chemical bond. However, it does represent the initial trajectory of attack of an amine on a carbonyl group and was an important piece of experimental evidence for the proposal of the B\u00fcrgi\u2013Dunitz angle for carbonyl addition reactions.\nHistory.\nMethadone was developed in 1937 in Germany by scientists working for I.G. Farbenindustrie AG at the Farbwerke Hoechst who were looking for a synthetic opioid that could be created with readily available precursors, to solve Germany's opium and morphine shortage problem. On 11 September 1941 Bockm\u00fchl and Ehrhart filed an application for a patent for a synthetic substance they called Hoechst 10820 or Polamidon (a name still in regular use in Germany) and whose structure had little relation to morphine or other \"true opiates\" such as diamorphine (Heroin), desomorphine (Permonid), nicomorphine (Vilan), codeine, dihydrocodeine, oxymorphone (Opana), hydromorphone (Dilaudid), oxycodone (OxyContin), hydrocodone (Dicodid), and other closely related opium alkaloid derivatives and analogues. It was brought to market in 1943 and was widely used by the German army during WWII as a substitute for morphine.\nIn the 1930s, pethidine (meperidine) went into production in Germany; however, the production of methadone, then being developed under the designation Hoechst 10820, was not carried forward because of side effects discovered in the early research. After the war, all German patents, trade names, and research records were requisitioned and expropriated by the Allies. The records on the research work of the I.G. Farbenkonzern at the Farbwerke Hoechst were confiscated by the U.S. Department of Commerce Intelligence, investigated by a Technical Industrial Committee of the U.S. Department of State and then brought to the US. The report published by the committee noted that while methadone itself was potentially addictive, it produced \"considerably\" less euphoria, sedation, and respiratory depression than morphine at equianalgesic doses and was thus interesting as a commercial drug. The same report also compared methadone to pethidine. German researchers reported that methadone was capable of producing strong morphine-like physical dependence, which is characterized by opioid withdrawal symptoms which are lesser in severity and intensity compared to morphine, but methadone was associated with a considerably prolonged or protracted withdrawal syndrome when compared to morphine. Morphine produced higher rates of self-administration and reinforcing behaviour in both human and animal subjects when compared to both methadone and pethidine. In comparison to equianalgesic doses of pethidine (Demerol), methadone was shown to produce less euphoria, but higher rates of constipation, and roughly equal levels of respiratory depression and sedation.\nIn the early 1950s, methadone (most times the racemic HCl salts mixture) was also investigated for use as an antitussive.\nIsomethadone, noracymethadol, LAAM, and normethadone were first developed in Germany, the United Kingdom, Belgium, Austria, Canada, and the United States in the thirty or so years after the 1937 discovery of pethidine, the first synthetic opioid used in medicine. These synthetic opioids have increased length and depth of satiating any opiate cravings and generate very strong analgesic effects due to their long metabolic half-life and strong receptor affinity at the mu-opioid receptor sites. Therefore, they impart much of the satiating and anti-addictive effects of methadone by suppressing drug cravings.\nIt was only in 1947 that the drug was given the generic name \"methadone\" by the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry of the American Medical Association. Since the patent rights of the I.G. Farbenkonzern and Farbwerke Hoechst were no longer protected, each pharmaceutical company interested in the formula could buy the rights for the commercial production of methadone for just one dollar (MOLL 1990).\nMethadone was introduced into the United States in 1947 by Eli Lilly and Company as an analgesic under the trade name Dolophine. An urban myth later arose that Nazi leader Adolf Hitler ordered the manufacture of methadone or that the brand name 'Dolophine' was named after him, probably based on the similarity of \"doloph\" with \"Adolph\". (The pejorative term \"adolphine\" would appear in the early 1970s.) However, the name \"Dolophine\" was a contraction of \"Dolo\" from the Latin word \"dolor\" (pain), and \"finis\", the Latin word for \"end\". Therefore, Dolophine literally means \"pain end\".\nMethadone was studied as a treatment for opioid addiction at the Addiction Research Center of the Narcotics Farm in Lexington, Kentucky in the 1950s, and by Rockefeller University physicians Robert Dole and Marie Nyswander in the 1960s in New York City. By 1976, methadone clinics had opened in cities including Chicago, New York, and New Haven, with some 38,000 patients treated in New York City alone.\nSociety and culture.\nBrand names.\nBrand names include Dolophine, Symoron, Amidone, Methadose, Physeptone, Metadon, Metadol, Metadol-D, Heptanon and Heptadon among others.\nEconomics.\nIn the US, generic methadone tablets are inexpensive, with retail prices ranging from $0.25 to $2.50 per defined daily dose.\nMethadone maintenance clinics in the US may be covered by private insurance, Medicaid, or Medicare. Medicare covers methadone under the prescription drug benefit, Medicare Part D, when it is prescribed for pain, but not when it is used for opioid dependence treatment because it cannot be dispensed in a retail pharmacy for this purpose. In California methadone maintenance treatment is covered under the medical benefit. Patients' eligibility for methadone maintenance treatment is most often contingent on them being enrolled in substance abuse counseling. People on methadone maintenance in the US either have to pay cash or if covered by insurance must complete a pre-determined number of hours per month in therapeutic groups or counseling. The United States Department of Veteran's Affairs (VA) Alcohol and Drug Dependence Rehabilitation Program offers methadone services to eligible veterans enrolled in the VA health care system.\nMethadone maintenance treatment (MMT) cost analyses often compare the cost of clinic visits versus the overall societal costs of illicit opioid use. A preliminary cost analysis conducted in 2016 by the US Department of Defense determined that methadone treatment, which includes psychosocial and support services, may cost an average of $126.00 per week or $6,552.00 per year. The average cost for one full year of methadone maintenance treatment is approximately $4,700 per patient, whereas one full year of imprisonment costs approximately $24,000 per person.\nRegulation.\nUnited States and Canada.\nMethadone is a Schedule I controlled substance in Canada and Schedule II in the United States, with an ACSCN of 9250 and a 2014 annual aggregate manufacturing quota of 31,875 kilos for sale. Methadone intermediate is also controlled, under ACSCN 9226 also under Schedule II, with a quota of 38,875 kilos. In most countries of the world, methadone is similarly restricted. The salts of methadone in use are the hydrobromide (free base conversion ratio 0.793), hydrochloride (0.894), and HCl monohydrate (0.850). Methadone is also regulated internationally as a Schedule I controlled substance under the United Nations Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs of 1961.\nMethadone clinics.\nIn the United States, prescription of methadone requires intensive monitoring and must be obtained in-person from an Opioid Treatment Program\u2014colloquially known as a 'methadone clinic'\u2014when prescribed for opioid use disorder (OUD). According to federal laws, methadone cannot be prescribed by a doctor and obtained from a pharmacy to treat addiction. Because of its long half-life, methadone is almost invariably prescribed to be taken in a single daily dose. At nearly all methadone clinics in the US, patients must visit a clinic to receive and take their dose under the supervision of a nurse. Both patients who are new to methadone treatment and high-risk patients\u2014such as those who are using drugs and alcohol, including cannabis in some states\u2014must visit the clinic daily.\nOther countries.\nIn Russia, methadone treatment is illegal. In 2008, the Chief Sanitary Inspector of Russia Gennadiy Onishchenko, stated that Russian health officials were not convinced of methadone's efficacy in treating heroin and/or opioid addiction. Instead of replacement therapy and gradual reduction of illicit drug use, Russian doctors encouraged immediate cessation and withdrawal. People who use drugs were generally given sedatives and non-opioid analgesics to cope with withdrawal symptoms.\nAs of 2015, China had the largest methadone maintenance treatment program with over 250,000 people in over 650 clinics in 27 provinces.\nVeterinary use.\nMethadone is a common perioperative analgesic in cats and dogs with a variety of routes of administration. Methadone in combination with acepromazine provides greater sedation than the equivalent combination involving morphine or butorphanol. Methadone's depressive effect on the cardiovascular system is approximately twice as strong as morphine. Methadone is contradicated for gastroduodenoscopy. Methadone provides greater analgesia than buprenorphine for orthopaedic and ovariohysterectomy procedures in dogs. Fluconazole and methadone given concurrently as a subcutaneous administration twice over a 6 hour period can provide analgesia for 12\u201324 hours. Methadone can be used for sedation in horses but is less effective than butorphanol, it can be combined with detomidine, which improves efficacy but can cause ataxia although the combination with detomidine has significantly less cardiovascular depressive effects than a combination with acepromazine. Methadone may be more effective as an analgesic in horses when adiminstered parenterally or epidurally as opposed to intravenously. Opioids are uncommon for livestock due to legislation surrounding usage but intravenous methadone is an effective analgesic in sheep and epidural methadone is an effective analgesic in cattle and sheep.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was introduced into number theory in 1832 by August Ferdinand M\u00f6bius.\nA large generalization of this formula applies to summation over an arbitrary locally finite partially ordered set, with M\u00f6bius' classical formula applying to the set of the natural numbers ordered by divisibility: see incidence algebra.\nStatement of the formula.\nThe classic version states that if g and f are arithmetic functions satisfying\n formula_1\nthen\nformula_2\nwhere \u03bc is the M\u00f6bius function and the sums extend over all positive divisors d of n (indicated by formula_3 in the above formulae). In effect, the original \"f\"(\"n\") can be determined given \"g\"(\"n\") by using the inversion formula. The two sequences are said to be M\u00f6bius transforms of each other.\nThe formula is also correct if f and g are functions from the positive integers into some abelian group (viewed as a Z-module).\nIn the language of Dirichlet convolutions, the first formula may be written as\nformula_4\nwhere \u2217 denotes the Dirichlet convolution, and \"1\" is the constant function \"1\"(\"n\") = 1. The second formula is then written as\nformula_5\nMany specific examples are given in the article on multiplicative functions.\nThe theorem follows because \u2217 is (commutative and) associative, and \"1\" \u2217 \"\u03bc\" = \"\u03b5\", where \u03b5 is the identity function for the Dirichlet convolution, taking values \"\u03b5\"(1) = 1, \"\u03b5\"(\"n\") = 0 for all \"n\" &gt; 1. Thus\nformula_6.\nReplacing formula_7 by formula_8, we obtain the product version of the M\u00f6bius inversion formula:\nformula_9\nSeries relations.\nLet\nformula_10\nso that\nformula_11\nis its transform. The transforms are related by means of series: the Lambert series\nformula_12\nand the Dirichlet series:\nformula_13\nwhere \"\u03b6\"(\"s\") is the Riemann zeta function.\nRepeated transformations.\nGiven an arithmetic function, one can generate a bi-infinite sequence of other arithmetic functions by repeatedly applying the first summation. \nFor example, if one starts with Euler's totient function \u03c6, and repeatedly applies the transformation process, one obtains:\nIf the starting function is the M\u00f6bius function itself, the list of functions is:\nBoth of these lists of functions extend infinitely in both directions. The M\u00f6bius inversion formula enables these lists to be traversed backwards.\nAs an example the sequence starting with \u03c6 is:\nformula_15\nThe generated sequences can perhaps be more easily understood by considering the corresponding Dirichlet series: each repeated application of the transform corresponds to multiplication by the Riemann zeta function.\nGeneralizations.\nA related inversion formula more useful in combinatorics is as follows: suppose \"F\"(\"x\") and \"G\"(\"x\") are complex-valued functions defined on the interval [1, \u221e) such that\nformula_16\nthen\nformula_17\nHere the sums extend over all positive integers n which are less than or equal to x.\nThis in turn is a special case of a more general form. If \"\u03b1\"(\"n\") is an arithmetic function possessing a Dirichlet inverse \"\u03b1\"\u22121(\"n\"), then if one defines\nformula_18\nthen\nformula_19\nThe previous formula arises in the special case of the constant function \"\u03b1\"(\"n\") = 1, whose Dirichlet inverse is \"\u03b1\"\u22121(\"n\") = \"\u03bc\"(\"n\").\nA particular application of the first of these extensions arises if we have (complex-valued) functions \"f\"(\"n\") and \"g\"(\"n\") defined on the positive integers, with\nformula_20\nBy defining \"F\"(\"x\") = \"f\"(\u230a\"x\"\u230b) and \"G\"(\"x\") = \"g\"(\u230a\"x\"\u230b), we deduce that\nformula_21\nA simple example of the use of this formula is counting the number of reduced fractions 0 &lt; &lt; 1, where a and b are coprime and \"b\" \u2264 \"n\". If we let \"f\"(\"n\") be this number, then \"g\"(\"n\") is the total number of fractions 0 &lt; &lt; 1 with \"b\" \u2264 \"n\", where a and b are not necessarily coprime. (This is because every fraction with gcd(\"a\",\"b\") = \"d\" and \"b\" \u2264 \"n\" can be reduced to the fraction with \u2264, and vice versa.) Here it is straightforward to determine \"g\"(\"n\") =, but \"f\"(\"n\") is harder to compute.\nAnother inversion formula is (where we assume that the series involved are absolutely convergent):\nformula_22\nAs above, this generalises to the case where \"\u03b1\"(\"n\") is an arithmetic function possessing a Dirichlet inverse \"\u03b1\"\u22121(\"n\"):\nformula_23\nFor example, there is a well known proof relating the Riemann zeta function to the prime zeta function that uses the series-based form of \nM\u00f6bius inversion in the previous equation when formula_24. Namely, by the Euler product representation of formula_25 for \nformula_26 \nformula_27 \nThese identities for alternate forms of M\u00f6bius inversion are found in. \nA more general theory of M\u00f6bius inversion formulas partially cited in the next section on incidence algebras is constructed by Rota in.\nMultiplicative notation.\nAs M\u00f6bius inversion applies to any abelian group, it makes no difference whether the group operation is written as addition or as multiplication. This gives rise to the following notational variant of the inversion formula:\nformula_28\nProofs of generalizations.\nThe first generalization can be proved as follows. We use Iverson's convention that [condition] is the indicator function of the condition, being 1 if the condition is true and 0 if false. We use the result that\nformula_29\nthat is, formula_30, where formula_31 is the unit function.\nWe have the following:\nformula_32\nThe proof in the more general case where \"\u03b1\"(\"n\") replaces 1 is essentially identical, as is the second generalisation.\nOn posets.\nFor a poset P, a set endowed with a partial order relation formula_33, define the M\u00f6bius function formula_34 of P recursively by \nformula_35\n(Here one assumes the summations are finite.) Then for formula_36, where K is a commutative ring, we have \nformula_37\nif and only if \nformula_38\n(See Stanley's \"Enumerative Combinatorics\", Vol 1, Section 3.7.) \nThe classical arithmetic Mobius function is the special case of the poset \"P\" of positive integers ordered by divisibility: that is, for positive integers \"s, t,\" we define the partial order formula_39 to mean that \"s\" is a divisor of \"t\". On the power set formula_40 of a set formula_41, ordered by formula_42 (set inclusion), the M\u00f6bius inversion theorem reproduces the inclusion\u2013exclusion principle, and on the set formula_43 of natural numbers with their standard (total) ordering by formula_33 the theorem coincides with a discrete version of the fundamental theorem of calculus (See Stanley's \"Enumerative Combinatorics\", Vol 1, Section 3.8). Across the sciences, many measures of interaction can be formulated as M\u00f6bius inversions on different posets. Examples include Shapley values in game theory, maximum entropy interactions in statistical mechanics, epistasis in genetics, and the interaction information, total correlation, and partial information decomposition from information theory.\nContributions of Weisner, Hall, and Rota.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe statement of the general M\u00f6bius inversion formula [for partially ordered sets] was first given independently by Weisner (1935) and Philip Hall (1936); both authors were motivated by group theory problems. Neither author seems to have been aware of the combinatorial implications of his work and neither developed the theory of M\u00f6bius functions. In a fundamental paper on M\u00f6bius functions, Rota showed the importance of this theory in combinatorial mathematics and gave a deep treatment of it. He noted the relation between such topics as inclusion-exclusion, classical number theoretic M\u00f6bius inversion, coloring problems and flows in networks. Since then, under the strong influence of Rota, the theory of M\u00f6bius inversion and related topics has become an active area of combinatorics.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was the second son of the Reverend E. P. Lowry who was the minister of the Wesleyan Church in Aldershot from 1892 to 1919. He was educated at Kingswood School, Bath, Somerset, and then at the Central Technical College in South Kensington. During those years he realized that he wanted to be a chemist. He studied chemistry under Henry Edward Armstrong, an English chemist whose interests were primarily in organic chemistry but also included the nature of ions in aqueous solutions. From 1896 to 1913 Lowry was assistant to Armstrong, and between 1904 and 1913 worked as lecturer in chemistry at the Westminster Training College. In 1913, he was appointed head of the chemical department in Guy\u2019s Hospital Medical and became the first teacher of chemistry in a Medical School to be made a University Professor, at the University of London. From 1920 till his death, Lowry served as the Chair of Physical Chemistry at the University of Cambridge. He married a daughter of the Rev. C. Wood in 1904 and was survived by his widow, two sons and a daughter.\nSince the establishment of the Faraday Society in 1903, Lowry had been its active member and served as its president between 1928 and 1930. In 1914 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society. During and after the World War I, Lowry acted as director of shell-filling (1917\u20131919) and worked for the Trench Warfare Committee, Chemical Warfare Committee and Ordnance Committee. For this service, he was awarded the Order of the British Empire and the Order of Saints Maurice and Lazarus.\nResearch.\nIn 1898, Lowry noted the change in optical rotation on nitro-\"d\"-camphor with time and invented the term \"mutarotational\" to describe this phenomenon. He studied changes in optical rotation caused by acid- and base-catalyzed reactions of camphor derivatives. This led in 1923 to his formulation of the protonic definition of acids and bases, now known as Br\u00f8nsted\u2013Lowry acid\u2013base theory, independently of the work by Johannes Nicolaus Br\u00f8nsted. Lowry published a few hundred papers and several books.

Marvel was founded in 1939 by Martin Goodman as Timely Comics, and by 1951 had generally become known as Atlas Comics. The Marvel era began in August 1961 with the launch of \"The Fantastic Four\" and other superhero titles created by Stan Lee, Jack Kirby, Steve Ditko, and numerous others. The Marvel brand, which had been used over the years and decades, was solidified as the company's primary brand.\nMarvel counts among its characters such well-known superheroes as Spider-Man, Wolverine, Iron Man, Captain America, Hulk, Thor, Doctor Strange, Daredevil, Black Panther, and Captain Marvel, as well as popular superhero teams such as the Avengers, X-Men, Fantastic Four, and Guardians of the Galaxy. Its stable of well-known supervillains includes Doctor Doom, Magneto, Green Goblin, Venom, Red Skull, Loki, Ultron, Thanos, Apocalypse, and Galactus. Most of Marvel's fictional characters operate in a single reality known as the Marvel Universe, with most locations mirroring real-life places; many major characters are based in New York City. Additionally, Marvel has published several licensed properties from other companies. This includes \"Star Wars\" comics, twice from 1977 to 1987, and again since 2015.\nHistory.\nTimely Publications.\nPulp-magazine publisher Martin Goodman created the company later known as Marvel Comics under the name Timely Publications in 1939. Goodman, who had started with a Western pulp in 1933, was expanding into the emerging\u2014and by then already highly popular\u2014new medium of comic books. Launching his new line from his existing company's offices at 330 West 42nd Street, New York City, he officially held the titles of editor, managing editor, and business manager, with Abraham Goodman (Martin's brother) officially listed as publisher.\nTimely's first publication, \"Marvel Comics\" #1 (cover dated Oct. 1939), included the first appearance of Carl Burgos' android superhero the Human Torch, and the first appearances of Bill Everett's anti-hero Namor the Sub-Mariner, among other features. The issue was a great success; it and a second printing the following month sold a combined nearly 900,000 copies. While its contents came from an outside packager, Funnies, Inc., Timely had its own staff in place by the following year. The company's first true editor, writer-artist Joe Simon, teamed with artist Jack Kirby to create one of the first patriotically themed superheroes, Captain America, in \"Captain America Comics\" #1 (March 1941). It, too, proved a hit, with sales of nearly one million. Goodman formed Timely Comics, Inc., beginning with comics cover-dated April 1941 or Spring 1941.\nWhile no other Timely character would achieve the success of these three characters, some notable heroes\u2014many of which continue to appear in modern-day retcon appearances and flashbacks\u2014include the Whizzer, Miss America, the Destroyer, the original Vision, and the Angel. Timely also published one of humor cartoonist Basil Wolverton's best-known features, \"Powerhouse Pepper\", as well as a line of children's talking animal comics featuring characters like Super Rabbit and the duo Ziggy Pig and Silly Seal.\nGoodman hired his wife's 16-year-old cousin, Stanley Lieber, as a general office assistant in 1939. When editor Simon left the company in late 1941, Goodman made Lieber\u2014by then writing pseudonymously as \"Stan Lee\"\u2014interim editor of the comics line, a position Lee kept for decades except for three years during his military service in World War II. Lee wrote extensively for Timely, contributing to a number of different titles.\nGoodman's business strategy involved having his various magazines and comic books published by a number of corporations all operating out of the same office and with the same staff. One of these shell companies through which Timely Comics was published was named Marvel Comics by at least \"Marvel Mystery Comics\" #55 (May 1944). As well, some comics' covers, such as \"All Surprise Comics\" #12 (Winter 1946\u201347), were labeled \"A Marvel Magazine\" many years before Goodman would formally adopt the name in 1961. The company begin identifying the group of its comic division as Marvel Comic Group, on some comics cover-dated November 1948, when the company set up an in-house editorial board to compete with the likes of DC and Fawcett, even though the legal name is still Timely.\nMagazine Management / Atlas Comics.\nThe post-war American comic market saw superheroes falling out of fashion. Goodman's comic book line dropped them for the most part and expanded into a wider variety of genres than even Timely had published, featuring horror, Westerns, humor, talking animal, men's adventure-drama, giant monster, crime, and war comics, and later adding jungle books, romance titles, espionage, and even medieval adventure, Bible stories and sports.\nGoodman began using the globe logo of the Atlas News Company, the newsstand-distribution company he owned, on comics cover-dated November 1951 even though another company, Kable News, continued to distribute his comics through the August 1952 issues. This globe branding united a line put out by the same publisher, staff and freelancers through 59 shell companies, from Animirth Comics to Zenith Publications.\nAtlas, rather than innovate, took a proven route of following popular trends in television and films\u2014Westerns and war dramas prevailing for a time, drive-in film monsters another time\u2014and even other comic books, particularly the EC horror line. Atlas also published a plethora of children's and teen humor titles, including Dan DeCarlo's \"Homer the Happy Ghost\" (similar to \"Casper the Friendly Ghost\") and \"Homer Hooper\" (\u00e0 la Archie Andrews). Atlas unsuccessfully attempted to revive superheroes from late 1953 to mid-1954, with the Human Torch (art by Syd Shores and Dick Ayers, variously), the Sub-Mariner (drawn and most stories written by Bill Everett), and Captain America (writer Stan Lee, artist John Romita Sr.). Atlas did not achieve any breakout hits and, according to Stan Lee, survived chiefly because it produced work quickly, cheaply, and at a passable quality.\nIn 1957, Goodman switched distributors to the American News Company\u2014which shortly afterward lost a Justice Department lawsuit and discontinued its business. Atlas was left without distribution and was forced to turn to Independent News, the distribution arm of its biggest rival, National (DC) Comics, which imposed draconian restrictions on Goodman's company. As then-Atlas editor Stan Lee recalled in a 1988 interview, \"[We had been] turning out 40, 50, 60 books a month, maybe more, and ... suddenly we went ... to either eight or 12 books a month, which was all Independent News Distributors would accept from us.\" The company was briefly renamed to Goodman Comics in 1957 under the distribution deal with Independent News.\nMarvel Comics.\nThe first modern comic books under the Marvel Comics brand were the science-fiction anthology \"Journey into Mystery\" #69 and the teen-humor title \"Patsy Walker\" #95 (both cover dated June 1961), which each displayed an \"MC\" box on its cover. Then, in the wake of DC Comics' success in reviving superheroes in the late 1950s and early 1960s, particularly with the Flash, Green Lantern, Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, Green Arrow, and other members of the team the Justice League of America, Marvel followed suit.\nIn 1961, writer-editor Stan Lee revolutionized superhero comics by introducing superheroes designed to appeal to older readers than the predominantly child audiences of the medium, thus ushering what Marvel later called the Marvel Age of Comics. Modern Marvel's first superhero team, the titular stars of \"The Fantastic Four\" #1 (Nov. 1961), broke convention with other comic book archetypes of the time by squabbling, holding grudges both deep and petty, and eschewing anonymity or secret identities in favor of celebrity status. Subsequently, Marvel comics developed a reputation for focusing on characterization and adult issues to a greater extent than most superhero comics before them, a quality which the new generation of older readers appreciated. This applied to \"The Amazing Spider-Man\" title in particular, which turned out to be Marvel's most successful book. Its young hero suffered from self-doubt and mundane problems like any other teenager, something with which many readers could identify.\nStan Lee and freelance artist and eventual co-plotter Jack Kirby's Fantastic Four originated in a Cold War culture that led their creators to revise the superhero conventions of previous eras to better reflect the psychological spirit of their age. Eschewing such comic book tropes as secret identities and even costumes at first, having a monster as one of the heroes, and having its characters bicker and complain in what was later called a \"superheroes in the real world\" approach, the series represented a change that proved to be a great success.\nMarvel often presented flawed superheroes, freaks, and misfits\u2014unlike the perfect, handsome, athletic heroes found in previous traditional comic books. Some Marvel heroes looked like villains and monsters such as the Hulk and the Thing. This naturalistic approach even extended into topical politics. Comics historian Mike Benton also noted:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;In the world of [rival DC Comics'] Superman comic books, communism did not exist. Superman rarely crossed national borders or involved himself in political disputes. From 1962 to 1965, there were more communists [in Marvel Comics] than on the subscription list of \"Pravda\". Communist agents attack Ant-Man in his laboratory, red henchmen jump the Fantastic Four on the moon, and Viet Cong guerrillas take potshots at Iron Man.\nAll these elements struck a chord with the older readers, including college-aged adults. In 1965, Spider-Man and the Hulk were both featured in \"Esquire\" magazine's list of 28 college campus heroes, alongside John F. Kennedy and Bob Dylan. In 2009, writer Geoff Boucher reflected that,\nSuperman and DC Comics instantly seemed like boring old Pat Boone; Marvel felt like The Beatles and the British Invasion. It was Kirby's artwork with its tension and psychedelia that made it perfect for the times\u2014or was it Lee's bravado and melodrama, which was somehow insecure and brash at the same time?\nIn addition to Spider-Man and the Fantastic Four, Marvel began publishing further superhero titles featuring such heroes and antiheroes as the Hulk, Thor, Ant-Man, Iron Man, the X-Men, Daredevil, the Inhumans, Black Panther, Doctor Strange, Captain Marvel and the Silver Surfer, and such memorable antagonists as Doctor Doom, Magneto, Galactus, Loki, the Green Goblin, and Doctor Octopus, all existing in a shared reality known as the Marvel Universe, with locations that mirror real-life cities such as New York, Los Angeles and Chicago.\nMarvel even lampooned itself and other comics companies in a parody comic, \"Not Brand Echh\" (a play on Marvel's dubbing of other companies as \"Brand Echh\", \u00e0 la the then-common phrase \"Brand X\").\nOriginally, the company's publications were branded by a minuscule \"Mc\" on the upper right-hand corner of the covers. However, artist/writer Steve Ditko put a larger masthead picture of the title character of \"The Amazing Spider-Man\" on the upper left-hand corner on issue #2 that included the series' issue number and price. Lee appreciated the value of this visual motif and adapted it for the company's entire publishing line. This branding pattern, being typically either a full-body picture of the characters' solo titles or a collection of the main characters' faces in ensemble titles, would become standard for Marvel for decades.\nCadence Industries ownership.\nIn 1968, while selling 50\u00a0million comic books a year, company founder Goodman revised the constraining distribution arrangement with Independent News he had reached under duress during the Atlas years, allowing him now to release as many titles as demand warranted. Late that year, he sold Marvel Comics and its parent company, Magazine Management, to the Perfect Film &amp; Chemical Corporation (later known as Cadence Industries), though he remained as publisher. In 1969, Goodman finally ended his distribution deal with Independent by signing with Curtis Circulation Company.\nIn 1971, the United States Department of Health, Education, and Welfare approached Marvel Comics editor-in-chief Stan Lee to do a comic book story about drug abuse. Lee agreed and wrote a three-part Spider-Man story portraying drug use as dangerous and unglamorous. However, the industry's self-censorship board, the Comics Code Authority, refused to approve the story because of the presence of narcotics, deeming the context of the story irrelevant. Lee, with Goodman's approval, published the story regardless in \"The Amazing Spider-Man\" #96\u201398 (May\u2013July 1971), without the Comics Code seal. The market reacted well to the storyline, and the CCA subsequently revised the Code the same year.\nGoodman retired as publisher in 1972 and installed his son, Chip, as publisher. Shortly thereafter, Lee succeeded him as publisher and also became Marvel's president for a brief time. During his time as president, he appointed his associate editor, prolific writer Roy Thomas, as editor-in-chief. Thomas added \"Stan Lee Presents\" to the opening page of each comic book.\nA series of new editors-in-chief oversaw the company during another slow time for the industry. Once again, Marvel attempted to diversify, and with the updating of the Comics Code published titles themed to horror (\"The Tomb of Dracula\"), martial arts (\"Shang-Chi: Master of Kung Fu\"), sword-and-sorcery (\"Conan the Barbarian\" in 1970, \"Red Sonja\"), satire (\"Howard the Duck\") and science fiction (\"\", \"Killraven\" in \"Amazing Adventures\", \"Battlestar Galactica\", \"Star Trek\", and, late in the decade, the long-running \"Star Wars\" series). Some of these were published in larger-format black and white magazines, under its Curtis Magazines imprint.\nMarvel was able to capitalize on its successful superhero comics of the previous decade by acquiring a new newsstand distributor and greatly expanding its comics line. Marvel pulled ahead of rival DC Comics in 1972, during a time when the price and format of the standard newsstand comic were in flux. Goodman increased the price and size of Marvel's November 1971 cover-dated comics from 15 cents for 36 pages total to 25 cents for 52 pages. DC followed suit, but Marvel the following month dropped its comics to 20 cents for 36 pages, offering a lower-priced product with a higher distributor discount.\nIn 1973, Perfect Film &amp; Chemical renamed itself as Cadence Industries and renamed Magazine Management as Marvel Comics Group. Goodman, now disconnected from Marvel, set up a new company called Seaboard Periodicals in 1974, reviving Marvel's old Atlas name for a new Atlas Comics line, but this lasted only a year and a half.\nIn the mid-1970s a decline of the newsstand distribution network affected Marvel. Cult hits such as \"Howard the Duck\" fell victim to the distribution problems, with some titles reporting low sales when in fact the first specialty comic book stores resold them at a later date. But by the end of the decade, Marvel's fortunes were reviving, thanks to the rise of direct market distribution\u2014selling through those same comics-specialty stores instead of newsstands.\nMarvel ventured into audio in 1975 with a radio series and a record, both had Stan Lee as narrator. The radio series was Fantastic Four. The record was \"Spider-Man: Rock Reflections of a Superhero\" concept album for music fans.\nMarvel held its own comic book convention, Marvelcon '75, in spring 1975, and promised a Marvelcon '76. At the 1975 event, Stan Lee used a Fantastic Four panel discussion to announce that Jack Kirby, the artist co-creator of most of Marvel's signature characters, was returning to Marvel after having left in 1970 to work for rival DC Comics. In October 1976, Marvel, which already licensed reprints in different countries, including the UK, created a superhero specifically for the British market. Captain Britain debuted exclusively in the UK, and later appeared in American comics. During this time, Marvel and the Iowa-based Register and Tribune Syndicate launched a number of syndicated comic strips\u2014\"The Amazing Spider-Man\", \"Howard the Duck\", \"Conan the Barbarian\", and \"The Incredible Hulk\". None of the strips lasted past 1982, except for \"The Amazing Spider-Man\", which is still being published.\nIn 1978, Jim Shooter became Marvel's editor-in-chief. Although a controversial personality, Shooter cured many of the procedural ills at Marvel, including repeatedly missed deadlines. During Shooter's nine-year tenure as editor-in-chief, Chris Claremont and John Byrne's run on the \"Uncanny X-Men\" and Frank Miller's run on \"Daredevil\" became critical and commercial successes. Shooter brought Marvel into the rapidly evolving direct market, institutionalized creator royalties, starting with the Epic Comics imprint for creator-owned material in 1982; introduced company-wide crossover story arcs with \"Contest of Champions\" and \"Secret Wars\"; and in 1986 launched the ultimately unsuccessful New Universe line to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the Marvel Comics imprint. Star Comics, a children-oriented line differing from the regular Marvel titles, was briefly successful during this period, although hampered by legal action by the owners of the recently defunct Harvey Comics for purposefully plagiarizing their house style.\nMarvel Entertainment Group ownership.\nIn 1986, Marvel's parent, Marvel Entertainment Group, was sold to New World Entertainment, which within three years sold it to MacAndrews and Forbes, owned by Revlon executive Ronald Perelman in 1989. In 1991 Perelman took MEG public. Following the rapid rise of this stock, Perelman issued a series of junk bonds that he used to acquire other entertainment companies, secured by MEG stock.\nMarvel earned a great deal of money with their 1980s children's comics imprint Star Comics and they earned a great deal more money and worldwide success during the comic book boom of the early 1990s, launching the successful 2099 line of comics set in the future (\"Spider-Man 2099\", etc.) and the creatively daring though commercially unsuccessful Razorline imprint of superhero comics created by novelist and filmmaker Clive Barker. In 1990, Marvel began selling Marvel Universe Cards with trading card maker SkyBox International. These were collectible trading cards that featured the characters and events of the Marvel Universe. The 1990s saw the rise of variant covers, cover enhancements, swimsuit issues, and company-wide crossovers that affected the overall continuity of the Marvel Universe.\nIn early 1992, seven of Marvel's prized artists\u2014Todd McFarlane (known for his work on \"\"), Jim Lee (\"X-Men\"), Rob Liefeld (\"X-Force\"), Marc Silvestri (\"Wolverine\"), Erik Larsen (\"The Amazing Spider-Man\"), Jim Valentino (\"Guardians of the Galaxy\"), and Whilce Portacio (\"Uncanny X-Men\")\u2014left to form Image Comics in a deal brokered by Malibu Comics' owner Scott Mitchell Rosenberg. Three years later, on November 3, 1994, Rosenberg sold Malibu to Marvel. In purchasing Malibu, Marvel now owned computer coloring technology that had been developed by Rosenberg, and also integrated the Ultraverse line of comics and the Genesis Universe into Marvel's multiverse. Earlier that year, the company secured a deal with Harvey Comics, whereas Marvel took on the publishing and distribution of Harvey's titles.\nIn late 1994, Marvel acquired the comic book distributor Heroes World Distribution to use as its own exclusive distributor. As the industry's other major publishers made exclusive distribution deals with other companies, the ripple effect resulted in the survival of only one other major distributor in North America, Diamond Comic Distributors Inc. Then, by the middle of the decade, the industry had slumped, and in December 1996 MEG filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. In early 1997, when Marvel's Heroes World endeavor failed, Diamond also forged an exclusive deal with Marvel\u2014giving the company its own section of its comics catalog \"Previews\".\nMarvel in the early to mid-1990s expanded their entries in other media, including Saturday-morning cartoons and various comics collaborations to explore new genres. In 1992, they released the \"\" which was aired on Fox Kids, they later released \"Spider-Man: The Animated Series\" on the network as well. In 1993, Marvel teamed up with Thomas Nelson to create Christian media genre comics, including a Christian superhero named The Illuminator, they made adaptations of Christian novels too, including \"In His Steps\", \"The Screwtape Letters\", and \"The Pilgrim's Progress\". In 1996, Marvel had some of its titles participate in \"Heroes Reborn\", a crossover that allowed Marvel to relaunch some of its flagship characters such as the Avengers and the Fantastic Four, and outsource them to the studios of two of the former Marvel artists turned Image Comics founders, Jim Lee and Rob Liefeld. The relaunched titles, which saw the characters transported to a parallel universe with a history distinct from the mainstream Marvel Universe, were a solid success amidst a generally struggling industry.\nMarvel Enterprises.\nIn 1997, Toy Biz bought Marvel Entertainment Group to end the bankruptcy, forming a new corporation, Marvel Enterprises. With his business partner Avi Arad, publisher Bill Jemas, and editor-in-chief Bob Harras, Toy Biz co-owner Isaac Perlmutter helped stabilize the comics line.\nIn 1998, the company launched the imprint Marvel Knights, taking place \"with reduced [Marvel] continuity,\" according to one history, with better production quality. The imprint was helmed by soon-to-become editor-in-chief Joe Quesada; it featured tough, gritty stories showcasing such characters as the Daredevil, the Inhumans, and Black Panther.\nWith the new millennium, Marvel Comics emerged from bankruptcy and again began diversifying its offerings. \"X-Force\" #116 \"X-Force\" #119 (October 2001) was the first Marvel Comics title since \"The Amazing Spider-Man\" #96\u201398 in 1971 to not have the Comics Code Authority (CCA) approval seal, due to the violence depicted in the issue. The CCA, which governed the content of American comic books, rejected the issue, requiring that changes be made. Instead, Marvel simply stopped submitting comics to the CCA. It then established its own Marvel Rating System for comics. Marvel also created new imprints, such as MAX (an explicit-content line) and Marvel Adventures (developed for child audiences). The company also created an alternate universe imprint, Ultimate Marvel, that allowed the company to reboot its major titles by revising and updating its characters to introduce to a new generation.\nSome of the company's properties were adapted into successful film franchises, such as the \"Men in Black\" film series (which was based on a Malibu book), starting in 1997, the \"Blade\" film series, starting in 1998, the \"X-Men\" film series, starting in 2000, and the highest grossing series, \"Spider-Man\", beginning in 2002.\nMarvel's \"Conan the Barbarian\" title was canceled in 1993 after 275 issues, while the \"Savage Sword of Conan\" magazine had lasted 235 issues. Marvel published additional titles including miniseries until 2000 for a total of 650 issues. Conan was picked up by Dark Horse Comics three years later.\nIn a cross-promotion, the November 1, 2006, episode of the CBS soap opera \"Guiding Light\", titled \"She's a Marvel\", featured the character Harley Davidson Cooper (played by Beth Ehlers) as a superheroine named the Guiding Light. The character's story continued in an eight-page backup feature, \"A New Light\", that appeared in several Marvel titles published November 1 and 8. Also that year, Marvel created a wiki on its Web site.\nIn late 2007 the company launched \"Marvel Digital Comics Unlimited\", a digital archive of over 2,500 back issues available for viewing, for a monthly or annual subscription fee. At the December 2007 the New York Anime Fest, the company announcement that Del Rey Manga would published two original English language Marvel manga books featuring the X-Men and Wolverine to hit the stands in spring 2009.\nIn 2009 Marvel Comics closed its Open Submissions Policy, in which the company had accepted unsolicited samples from aspiring comic book artists, saying the time-consuming review process had produced no suitably professional work. The same year, the company commemorated its 70th anniversary, dating to its inception as Timely Comics, by issuing the one-shot \"Marvel Mystery Comics 70th Anniversary Special\" #1 and a variety of other special issues.\nDisney conglomerate unit (2009\u2013present).\nOn August 31, 2009, The Walt Disney Company announced it would acquire Marvel Comics' parent corporation, Marvel Entertainment, for a cash and stock deal worth approximately $4\u00a0billion, which if necessary would be adjusted at closing, giving Marvel shareholders $30 and 0.745 Disney shares for each share of Marvel they owned. As of 2008, Marvel and its major competitor DC Comics shared over 80% of the American comic-book market.\nAs of September 2010, Marvel switched its bookstore distribution company from Diamond Book Distributors to Hachette Distribution Services. Marvel moved its office to the Sports Illustrated Building in October 2010.\nMarvel relaunched the CrossGen imprint, owned by Disney Publishing Worldwide, in March 2011. Marvel and Disney Publishing began jointly publishing \"Disney/Pixar Presents\" magazine that May.\nMarvel discontinued its Marvel Adventures imprint in March 2012, and replaced them with a line of two titles connected to the Marvel Universe TV block. Also in March, Marvel announced its Marvel ReEvolution initiative that included Infinite Comics, a line of digital comics, Marvel AR, a software application that provides an augmented reality experience to readers and Marvel NOW!, a relaunch of most of the company's major titles with different creative teams. Marvel NOW! also saw the debut of new flagship titles including \"Uncanny Avengers\" and \"All-New X-Men\".\nIn April 2013, Marvel and other Disney conglomerate components began announcing joint projects. With ABC, a \"Once Upon a Time\" graphic novel was announced for publication in September. With Disney, Marvel announced in October 2013 that in January 2014 it would release its first title under their joint \"Disney Kingdoms\" imprint \"Seekers of the Weird\", a five-issue miniseries. On January 3, 2014, fellow Disney subsidiary Lucasfilm announced that as of 2015, \"Star Wars\" comics would once again be published by Marvel.\nFollowing the events of the company-wide crossover \"Secret Wars\" in 2015, a relaunched Marvel universe began in September 2015, called the All-New, All-Different Marvel.\nMarvel Legacy was the company's Fall 2017 relaunch branding, which began that September. Books released as part of that initiative featured lenticular variant covers that required comic book stores to double their regular issue order to be able to order the variants. The owner of two Comix Experience stores complained about requiring retailers to purchase an excess of copies featuring the regular cover, which they would not be able to sell in order to acquire the more sought-after variant. Marvel responded to these complaints by rescinding these ordering requirements on newer series, but maintained it on more long-running titles like \"Invincible Iron Man.\" As a result, MyComicShop.com and at least 70 other comic book stores boycotted these variant covers. Despite the release of \"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2\", \"Logan\", ', and ' in theaters, none of those characters' titles featured in the top 10 sales and the \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" comic book series was canceled. Conan Properties International announced on January 12, 2018, that Conan would return to Marvel in early 2019.\nOn March 1, 2019, Serial Box, a digital book platform, announced a partnership with Marvel, in which they would publish new and original stories tied to a number of Marvel's popular franchises.\nIn the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, from March to May 2020, Marvel and its distributor Diamond Comic Distributors stopped producing and releasing new comic books.\nOn March 25, 2021, Marvel Comics announced that they planned to shift their direct market distribution for monthly comics and graphic novels from Diamond Comic Distributors to Penguin Random House. The change was scheduled to start on October 1, 2021, in a multi-year partnership. The arrangement would still allow stores the option to order comics from Diamond, but Diamond would be acting as a wholesaler rather than distributor.\nOn March 29, 2023, as a part of a corporate restructuring to fold Marvel Entertainment into The Walt Disney Company, Marvel Comics was transferred to Disney Publishing Worldwide.\nIn June 2024, Marvel unveiled a new logo for Marvel Comics, similar in style to the logos for Marvel Studios and Marvel Studios Animation. This logo was meant to be used for more \"corporate\" purposes and on new social media channels for Marvel Comics, and would not appear on comics themselves.\nOfficers.\nEditors-in-chief.\nMarvel's chief editor originally held the title of \"editor\". This head editor's title later became \"editor-in-chief\". Joe Simon was the company's first true chief-editor, with publisher Martin Goodman, who had served as titular editor only and outsourced editorial operations.\nIn 1994 Marvel briefly abolished the position of editor-in-chief, replacing Tom DeFalco with five group editors-in-chief. As Carl Potts described the 1990s editorial arrangement:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;In the early '90s, Marvel had so many titles that there were three Executive Editors, each overseeing approximately one-third of the line. Bob Budiansky was the third Executive Editor [following the previously promoted Mark Gruenwald and Potts]. We all answered to Editor-in-Chief Tom DeFalco and Publisher Mike Hobson. All three Executive Editors decided not to add our names to the already crowded credits on the Marvel titles. Therefore it wasn't easy for readers to tell which titles were produced by which Executive Editor \u2026 In late '94, Marvel reorganized into a number of different publishing divisions, each with its own Editor-in-Chief.\nMarvel reinstated the overall editor-in-chief position in 1995 with Bob Harras.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nExecutive Editors.\nOriginally called associate editor when Marvel's chief editor just carried the title of editor, the title of the second-highest editorial position became executive editor under the chief editor title of editor-in-chief. The title of associate editor later was revived under the editor-in-chief as an editorial position in charge of few titles under the direction of an editor and without an assistant editor.\nAssociate Editor\nExecutive Editor\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nOwnership.\nParent corporation\nOffices.\nLocated in New York City, Marvel has had successive headquarters:\nProductions.\nTV.\n Animated \nMarket share.\nIn 2017, Marvel held a 38.30% share of the comics market, compared to its competitor DC Comics' 33.93%. By comparison, the companies respectively held 33.50% and 30.33% shares in 2013, and 40.81% and 29.94% shares in 2008.\nMarvel characters in other media.\nMarvel characters and stories have been adapted to multiple media platforms. Some of these adaptations were produced by Marvel Comics and its sister company, Marvel Studios, while others were produced by companies licensing Marvel material.\nGames.\nIn June 1993, Marvel issued its collectable caps for milk caps game under the Hero Caps brand. In 2014, the Japanese TV series was launched together with a collectible game called Bachicombat, a game similar to the milk caps game, by Bandai.\nCollectible card games.\nThe RPG industry brought the development of the collectible card game (CCG) in the early 1990s which there were soon Marvel characters were featured in CCG of their own starting in 1995 with Fleer's OverPower (1995\u20131999). Later collectible card game were:\nMiniatures.\nRole-playing.\nTSR published the pen-and-paper role-playing game Marvel Super Heroes in 1984. TSR then released in 1998 the \"Marvel Super Heroes Adventure Game\" which used a different system, the card-based SAGA system, than their first game. In 2003 Marvel Publishing published its own role-playing game, the \"Marvel Universe Roleplaying Game\", that used a diceless stone pool system. In August 2011 Margaret Weis Productions announced it was developing a tabletop role-playing game based on the Marvel universe, set for release in February 2012 using its house Cortex Plus RPG system.\nVideo games.\nVideo games based on Marvel characters go back to 1984 and the Atari 2600 game, \"Spider-Man\". Since then several dozen video games have been released and all have been produces by outside licensees. In 2014, \"\" was released that brought Marvel characters to the existing Disney sandbox video game.\nFilms.\nAs of the start of September 2015, films based on Marvel's properties represent the highest-grossing U.S. franchise, having grossed over $7.7\u00a0billion as part of a worldwide gross of over $18\u00a0billion. As of 2024, the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) has grossed over $32\u00a0billion.\nProse novels.\nMarvel first licensed two prose novels to Bantam Books, who printed \"The Avengers Battle the Earth Wrecker\" by Otto Binder (1967) and \"Captain America: The Great Gold Steal\" by Ted White (1968). Various publishers took up the licenses from 1978 to 2002. Also, with the various licensed films being released beginning in 1997, various publishers put out film novelizations. In 2003, following publication of the prose young adult novel \"Mary Jane\", starring Mary Jane Watson from the Spider-Man mythos, Marvel announced the formation of the publishing imprint Marvel Press. However, Marvel moved back to licensing with Pocket Books from 2005 to 2008. With few books issued under the imprint, Marvel and Disney Books Group relaunched Marvel Press in 2011 with the Marvel Origin Storybooks line.\nTelevision programs.\nMany television series, both live-action and animated, have based their productions on Marvel Comics characters. These include series for popular characters such as Spider-Man, Iron Man, the Hulk, the Avengers, the X-Men, Fantastic Four, the Guardians of the Galaxy, Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Luke Cage, Iron Fist, the Punisher, the Defenders, S.H.I.E.L.D., Agent Carter, Deadpool, Legion, and others. Additionally, a handful of television films, usually also pilots, based on Marvel Comics characters have been made.\nTheme parks.\nMarvel has licensed its characters for theme parks and attractions, including Marvel Super Hero Island at Universal Orlando's Islands of Adventure in Orlando, Florida, which includes rides based on their iconic characters and costumed performers, as well as The Amazing Adventures of Spider-Man ride cloned from Islands of Adventure to Universal Studios Japan.\nYears after Disney purchased Marvel in late 2009, Walt Disney Parks and Resorts plans on creating original Marvel attractions at their theme parks, with Hong Kong Disneyland becoming the first Disney theme park to feature a Marvel attraction. Due to the licensing agreement with Universal Studios, signed prior to Disney's purchase of Marvel, Walt Disney World and Tokyo Disney Resort are barred from having Marvel characters in their parks. However, this only includes characters that Universal is currently using, other characters in their \"families\" (X-Men, Avengers, Fantastic Four, etc.), and the villains associated with said characters. This clause has allowed Walt Disney World to have meet and greets, merchandise, attractions and more with other Marvel characters not associated with the characters at Islands of Adventures, such as Star-Lord and Gamora from \"Guardians of the Galaxy\".\nImprints.\nDisney Kingdoms.\nMarvel Worldwide with Disney announced in October 2013 that in January 2014 it would release its first comic book title under their joint Disney Kingdoms imprint \"Seekers of the Weird\", a five-issue miniseries inspired by a never built Disneyland attraction Museum of the Weird. Marvel's Disney Kingdoms imprint has since released comic adaptations of Big Thunder Mountain Railroad, Walt Disney's Enchanted Tiki Room, The Haunted Mansion, two series on \"Figment\" based on Journey Into Imagination.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "20970", "revid": "7903804", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20970", "title": "Matthew F. Hale", "text": "White separatist religious leader\nMatthew Frederick Hale (born July 27, 1971) is an American white supremacist, neo-Nazi leader and convicted felon. Hale was the founder of the East Peoria, Illinois-based white separatist group then known as the World Church of the Creator (now called The Creativity Movement), and he declared himself its \"Pontifex Maximus\" (Latin for \"highest priest\") in continuation of the Church of the Creator organization founded by Ben Klassen in 1973.\nIn 1998, Hale was barred from practicing law in Illinois by the state panel responsible for evaluating the character and fitness of prospective lawyers. The panel stated that Hale's incitement of racial hatred, for the ultimate purpose of depriving selected groups of their legal rights, was blatantly immoral and rendered him unfit to be a lawyer.\nIn 2005, Hale was sentenced to a 40-year federal prison term for encouraging an undercover Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) informant to kill federal judge Joan Lefkow. As of July 2020, Hale was transferred out of ADX Florence and into United States Penitentiary, Marion in Illinois. His current projected release date is April 29, 2036.\nEarly life.\nHale was born in 1971 and raised in East Peoria, Illinois, a city on the Illinois River. After his parents divorced when he was nine years old, Hale was raised solely by his father, a police officer. By the age of 12, he was reading books about Nazism, including Adolf Hitler's \"Mein Kampf\", and had formed a Nazi-themed group at his school.\nIn August 1989, Hale entered Bradley University, studying political science. After failing to form a \"White Student Union\" at Bradley, Hale attempted to lead a series of political organizations in a short period: He founded the American White Supremacist Party, but it failed to attract many members; he then dissolved the AWSP in 1990 and attempted to form a chapter of the David Duke incarnation of the National Association for the Advancement of White People, but the chapter was not recognized by the national organization. In 1992 he declared himself the National Leader of the National Socialist White Americans' Party, without having any local members; he disbanded that organization in 1995.\nAround 1990, Hale burned an Israeli flag at a demonstration, leading to a fine from East Peoria for open burning. The next year, he passed out racist pamphlets in the city was fined for littering. In 1991, Hale and his brother allegedly threatened three African Americans with a gun. Hale was arrested for mob action, and because he lied to police about his brother's whereabouts, he was also charged with felony obstruction of justice. Hale was convicted of obstruction, but won a reversal on appeal. In 1992, Hale attacked a security guard at a mall and was charged with criminal trespass, resisting arrest, aggravated battery and carrying a concealed weapon. For this attack, Hale was sentenced to six months of house arrest and 30 months of probation.\nMeanwhile, by 1992, Hale had become involved with an organization called the Church of the Creator. The church believed, and its successors believe, that a \"racial holy war\" is necessary to attain a \"white world\" without Jews and non-whites. To this end, it encourages its members to \"populate the lands of this earth with white people exclusively.\" The COTC's founder, Ben Klassen, committed suicide on August 7, 1993, leaving the organization listless and owing a default judgment of $1 million to the family of a murder victim. Though this was the first such organization Hale had been involved in without appointing himself as leader, he soon achieved the same effect: switching his leadership identity from a political party to religious, Hale dissolved his NSWAP and formed a \"New\" Church of the Creator in 1995 and told followers of Klassen's organization that Hale was the type of leader Klassen had wished for; and in Montana on July 27, 1996, the COTC's Guardians of the Faith Committee renamed the organization to the \"World Church of the Creator\" and anointed Hale as \"Pontifex Maximus\".\nDenial of law license.\nHale began at the Southern Illinois University School of Law in 1995, graduating in May 1998 and passing the Illinois state bar examination in July of the same year.\nOn December 16, 1998, the Illinois Bar Committee on Character and Fitness rejected Hale's application for a license to practice law. Hale appealed, and a hearing was held on April 10, 1999. On June 30, 1999, a Hearing Panel of the Committee refused to certify that Hale had the requisite moral character and fitness to practice law in Illinois. Attorney Glenn Greenwald represented Hale in a failed federal lawsuit to overturn the licensing decision. \nTwo days after Hale was denied a license to practice law, a World Church of the Creator member and college student, Benjamin Smith, went on a three-day shooting spree in which he randomly targeted members of racial and ethnic minority groups in Illinois and Indiana. Smith killed two people and wounded ten others before committing suicide on July 4. Mark Potok, director of intelligence for the Southern Poverty Law Center, believes that Smith may have acted in retaliation after Hale's application to practice law was rejected.\nDuring a television interview in the summer of 1999, Hale stated that his \"church does not condone violent or illegal activities\".\nCourt trials and federal convictions.\nIn 2000, a religious group in Oregon called the Church of the Creator sued Hale's organization, the World Church of the Creator (WCOTC), for trademark infringement.\nHale filed a lawsuit against Judge Joan Lefkow, the United States district court judge presiding over the trademark infringement case who, after an appeal, had ruled against Hale's organization. Hale stated that the WCOTC was in a \"state of war\" with Lefkow, and denounced Lefkow in a news conference, claiming that she was biased against him because she was married to a Jewish man and had biracial grandchildren.\nOn January 8, 2003, Hale was arrested, charged with soliciting an undercover FBI informant named Tony Evola to kill Lefkow.\nOn April 6, 2005, Hale was sentenced to a 40-year prison term exactly one year after the trial began for attempting to solicit Lefkow's murder. U.S. District Court Judge James Moody presided over the sentencing. During the trial, jurors heard more than a dozen tapes of Hale using racial slurs, including one in which he joked about Benjamin Smith's shooting spree. According to prosecutors, Hale had asked one of his followers named Anthony Evola to kill Lefkow. Hale demanded that his attorney Thomas Durkin push for non-whites to be stricken from the jury, and later pushed Durkin to argue that Hale was being persecuted because the government was retaliating against him for \"proving\" that the 9/11 attacks were committed by Israel; Durkin told Hale he would do neither and for Hale to fire him and find a new attorney or represent himself if he was determined to pursue those avenues. Hale and his few supporters have demanded since his conviction that the DA's office give him a lie-detector test to show his innocence and be released from prison, the office ignoring said demands.\nIn June 2016, Hale was transferred out of ADX Florence to medium-security federal prison FCI Terre Haute, Indiana, but by late 2017 was back at Florence. In July 2020, Hale was transferred out of ADX once again, this time to USP Marion, a medium-security institution in Illinois.\nHale's projected release date is April 29, 2036. If released on that date, he will be 64 years old.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
