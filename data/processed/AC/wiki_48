They can be designed for many arrangements of digital and analog I/O, extended temperature ranges, immunity to electrical noise, and resistance to vibration and impact.\nPLCs were first developed in the automobile manufacturing industry to provide flexible, rugged and easily programmable controllers to replace hard-wired relay logic systems. Dick Morley, who invented the first PLC, the Modicon 084, for General Motors in 1968, is considered the father of PLC.\nA PLC is an example of a hard real-time system since output results must be produced in response to input conditions within a limited time, otherwise unintended operation may result. Programs to control machine operation are typically stored in battery-backed-up or non-volatile memory.\nInvention and early development.\nThe PLC originated in the late 1960s in the automotive industry in the US and was designed to replace relay logic systems. Before, control logic for manufacturing was mainly composed of relays, cam timers, drum sequencers, and dedicated closed-loop controllers.\nThe hard-wired nature of these components made it difficult for design engineers to alter the automation process. Changes would require rewiring and careful updating of the documentation. Troubleshooting was a tedious process. When general-purpose computers became available, they were soon applied to control logic in industrial processes. These early computers were unreliable and required specialist programmers and strict control of working conditions, such as temperature, cleanliness, and power quality.\nThe PLC provided several advantages over earlier automation systems. It was designed to tolerate the industrial environment better than systems intended for office use, and was more reliable, compact, and required less maintenance than relay systems. It was easily expandable with additional I/O modules. While relay systems required tedious and sometimes complicated hardware changes in case of reconfiguration, a PLC can be reconfigured by loading new or modified code. This allowed for easier iteration over manufacturing process design. With a simple programming language focused on logic and switching operations, it was more user-friendly than computers using general-purpose programming languages. Early PLCs were programmed in ladder logic, which strongly resembled a schematic diagram of relay logic. It also permitted its operation to be monitored.\nVirtual PLCs.\nIn recent years, the introduction of virtual PLCs has expanded the scope of programmable logic controllers. Virtual PLCs are software-based controllers that simulate the functions of traditional PLCs but are executed on general-purpose hardware, offering a more cost-effective and flexible alternative. These controllers enable automation systems to be managed without the need for dedicated hardware, making them ideal for applications requiring simulation, remote control, or cloud-based systems.\nModicon.\nIn 1968, GM Hydramatic, the automatic transmission division of General Motors, issued a request for proposals for an electronic replacement for hard-wired relay systems based on a white paper written by engineer Edward R. Clark. The winning proposal came from Bedford Associates from Bedford, Massachusetts. The result, built in 1969, was the first PLC and designated the \"084\", because it was Bedford Associates' eighty-fourth project.\nBedford Associates started a company, Modicon, Inc., dedicated to developing, manufacturing, selling, and servicing this new product, which they named &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;Modicon (standing for \"modular digital controller\"). One of the people who worked on that project was Dick Morley, who is considered to be the father of the PLC. The Modicon brand was sold in 1977 to Gould Electronics and later to Schneider Electric, its current owner. About this same time, Modicon created Modbus, a data communications protocol to be used with its PLCs. Modbus has since become a standard open protocol commonly used to connect many industrial electrical devices.\nOne of the first Modicon 084 models built is now on display at Schneider Electric's facility in North Andover, Massachusetts. It was presented to Modicon by GM, when the unit was retired after nearly twenty years of uninterrupted service. Modicon used the 84 moniker at the end of its product range like Modicon Micro 84 and Modicon TSX CSY 84 until after the 984 made its appearance.\nAllen-Bradley.\nIn a parallel development, Odo Josef Struger is sometimes known as the \"father of the programmable logic controller\" as well. He was involved in the invention of the Allen-Bradley programmable logic controller and is credited with coining the PLC acronym. Allen-Bradley (now a brand owned by Rockwell Automation) became a major PLC manufacturer in the United States during his tenure. Struger played a leadership role in developing IEC 61131-3 PLC programming language standards. Allen-Bradley's PLC-5 family, released in the 1980's, was the first modular design found in modern-day systems.\nEarly methods of programming.\nMany early PLC programming applications were not capable of graphical representation of the logic, and so it was instead represented as a series of logic expressions in some kind of Boolean format, similar to Boolean algebra. As programming terminals evolved, because ladder logic was a familiar format used for electro-mechanical control panels, it became more commonly used. Newer formats, such as state logic, function block diagrams, and structured text exist. Ladder logic remains popular because PLCs solve the logic in a predictable and repeating sequence, and ladder logic allows the person writing the logic to see any issues with the timing of the logic sequence more easily than would be possible in other formats.\nUp to the mid-1990s, PLCs were programmed using proprietary programming panels or special-purpose programming terminals, which often had dedicated function keys representing the various logical elements of PLC programs. Some proprietary programming terminals displayed the elements of PLC programs as graphic symbols, but plain ASCII character representations of contacts, coils, and wires were common. Programs were stored on cassette tape cartridges. Facilities for printing and documentation were minimal due to a lack of memory capacity. The oldest PLCs used magnetic-core memory.\nArchitecture.\nA PLC is an industrial microprocessor-based controller with programmable memory used to store program instructions and various functions. It consists of:\nPLCs require a programming device which is used to develop and later download the created program into the memory of the controller.\nModern PLCs generally contain a real-time operating system, such as OS-9 or VxWorks.\nMechanical design.\nThere are two types of mechanical design for PLC systems. A \"single box\" (also called a \"brick\") is a small programmable controller that fits all units and interfaces into one compact casing, although, typically, additional expansion modules for inputs and outputs are available. The second design type\u00a0\u2013 a \"modular\" PLC\u00a0\u2013 has a chassis (also called a \"rack\") that provides space for modules with different functions, such as power supply, processor, selection of I/O modules and communication interfaces\u00a0\u2013 which all can be customized for the particular application. Several racks can be administered by a single processor and may have thousands of inputs and outputs. Either a special high-speed serial I/O link or comparable communication method is used so that racks can be distributed away from the processor, reducing the wiring costs for large plants.\nDiscrete and analog signals.\nDiscrete (digital) signals can only take \"on\" or \"off\" value (1 or 0, \"true\" or \"false\"). Examples of devices providing a discrete signal include limit switches and photoelectric sensors.\nAnalog signals can use voltage or current that is analogous to the monitored variable and can take any value within their scale. Pressure, temperature, flow, and weight are often represented by analog signals. These are typically interpreted as integer values with various ranges of accuracy depending on the device and the number of bits available to store the data. For example, an analog 0 to 10\u00a0V or 4-20\u00a0mA current loop input would be converted into an integer value of 0 to 32,767. The PLC will take this value and translate it into the desired units of the process so the operator or program can read it.\nRedundancy.\nSome special processes need to work permanently with minimum unwanted downtime. Therefore, it is necessary to design a system that is fault tolerant. In such cases, to increase the system availability in the event of hardware component failure, redundant CPU or I/O modules with the same functionality can be added to a hardware configuration to prevent a total or partial process shutdown due to hardware failure. Other redundancy scenarios could be related to safety-critical processes, for example, large hydraulic presses could require that two PLCs turn on output before the press can come down in case one PLC does not behave properly.\nProgramming.\nProgrammable logic controllers are intended to be used by engineers without a programming background. For this reason, a graphical programming language called ladder logic was first developed. It resembles the schematic diagram of a system built with electromechanical relays and was adopted by many manufacturers and later standardized in the IEC 61131-3 control systems programming standard. As of 2015,[ [update]] it is still widely used, thanks to its simplicity.\nAs of 2015,[ [update]] the majority of PLC systems adhere to the IEC 61131-3 standard that defines 2 textual programming languages: Structured Text (similar to Pascal) and Instruction List; as well as 3 graphical languages: ladder logic, function block diagram and sequential function chart. Instruction List was deprecated in the third edition of the standard.\nModern PLCs can be programmed in a variety of ways, from the relay-derived ladder logic to programming languages such as specially adapted dialects of BASIC and C.\nWhile the fundamental concepts of PLC programming are common to all manufacturers, differences in I/O addressing, memory organization, and instruction sets mean that PLC programs are never perfectly interchangeable between different makers. Even within the same product line of a single manufacturer, different models may not be directly compatible.\nProgramming device.\nManufacturers develop programming software for their PLCs. In addition to being able to program PLCs in multiple languages, they provide common features like hardware diagnostics and maintenance, software debugging, and offline simulation.\nPLC programs are typically written in a programming device, which can take the form of a desktop console, special software on a personal computer, or a handheld device. The program is then downloaded to the PLC through a cable connection or over a network. It is stored either in non-volatile flash memory or battery-backed-up RAM on the PLC. In some PLCs, the program is transferred from the programming device using a programming board that writes the program into a removable chip, such as EPROM that is then inserted into the PLC.\nSimulation.\nAn incorrectly programmed PLC can result in lost productivity and dangerous conditions for programmed equipment. PLC simulation is a feature often found in PLC programming software. It allows for testing and debugging early in a project's development. Testing the project in simulation improves its quality, increases the level of safety associated with equipment and can save time during the installation and commissioning of automated control applications since many scenarios can be tried and tested before the system is activated.\nFunctionality.\nThe main difference compared to most other computing devices is that PLCs are intended for and therefore tolerant of more severe environmental conditions (such as dust, moisture, heat, cold), while offering extensive input/output (I/O) to connect the PLC to sensors and actuators. PLC input can include simple digital elements such as limit switches, analog variables from process sensors (such as temperature and pressure), and more complex data such as that from positioning or machine vision systems. PLC output can include elements such as indicator lamps, sirens, electric motors, pneumatic or hydraulic cylinders, magnetic relays, solenoids, or analog outputs. The input/output arrangements may be built into a simple PLC, or the PLC may have external I/O modules attached to a fieldbus or computer network that plugs into the PLC.\nThe functionality of the PLC has evolved over the years to include sequential relay control, motion control, process control, distributed control systems, and networking. The data handling, storage, processing power, and communication capabilities of some modern PLCs are approximately equivalent to desktop computers. PLC-like programming combined with remote I/O hardware allows a general-purpose desktop computer to serve as a PLC in certain applications. Desktop computer controllers have not been generally accepted in heavy industry because desktop computers run on less stable operating systems than PLCs, and because the desktop computer hardware is typically not designed to the same levels of tolerance to temperature, humidity, vibration, and longevity as PLCs.\nBasic functions.\nThe most basic function of a programmable logic controller is to emulate the functions of electromechanical relays. Within the PLC programming environment, discrete inputs are given a unique address, and a PLC instruction can test if the input state is on or off. Just as a series of relay contacts perform a logical AND function, not allowing current to pass unless all the contacts are closed, so a series of \"examine if on\" instructions will energize its output storage bit if all the input bits are on. Similarly, a parallel set of instructions will perform a logical OR. In an electromechanical relay wiring diagram, a group of contacts controlling one coil is called a \"rung\" of a \"ladder diagram\", and this concept is also used to describe PLC logic. The output of each rung sets or clears a storage bit, which may be associated with a discrete output or which may be an \"internal coil\" with no physical connection. Such internal coils can be used, for example, as a common element in multiple separate rungs.\nMore advanced instructions of the PLC may be implemented as functional blocks, which carry out some operation, such as manipulating internal variable, when enabled by a logical input and which produce outputs to signal, for example, completion or errors.\nCommunication.\nPLCs use built-in ports, such as USB, Ethernet, RS-232, RS-485, or RS-422 to communicate with external devices (sensors, actuators) and systems (programming tools, SCADA and other user interfaces). Communication is carried over various industrial network protocols, like Modbus, or EtherNet/IP. Many of these protocols are vendor specific. Formerly, some manufacturers offered dedicated communication modules as an add-on function where the processor had no network connection built-in.\nPLCs used in larger I/O systems may have peer-to-peer (P2P) communication between processors. This allows separate parts of a complex process to have individual control while allowing the subsystems to coordinate over the communication link.\nUser interface.\nPLCs may need to interact with people for the purpose of configuration, alarm reporting, or everyday control. A human-machine interface (HMI) is employed for this purpose. HMIs are also referred to as man-machine interfaces (MMIs) and graphical user interfaces (GUIs). A simple system may use buttons and lights to interact with the user. Text displays are available as well as graphical touch screens. More complex systems use programming and monitoring software installed on a computer, with the PLC connected via a communication interface.\nProcess of a scan cycle.\nA PLC works in a program scan cycle, where it executes its program repeatedly. The simplest scan cycle consists of 3 steps:\nThe program follows the sequence of instructions. It typically takes a time span of tens of milliseconds for the processor to evaluate all the instructions and update the status of all outputs. If the system contains remote I/O\u2014for example, an external rack with I/O modules\u2014then that introduces additional uncertainty in the response time of the PLC system.\nSpecial-purpose I/O modules may be used where the scan time of the PLC is too long to allow predictable performance. Precision timing modules, or counter modules for use with shaft encoders, are used where the scan time would be too long to reliably count pulses or detect the sense of rotation of an encoder. This allows even a relatively slow PLC to still interpret the counted values to control a machine, as the accumulation of pulses is done by a dedicated module that is unaffected by the speed of program execution.\nAs PLCs became more advanced, methods were developed to change the sequence of ladder execution, and subroutines were implemented.\nSecurity.\nIn his book from 1998, E. A. Parr pointed out that even though most programmable controllers require physical keys and passwords, the lack of strict access control and version control systems, as well as an easy-to-understand programming language make it likely that unauthorized changes to programs will happen and remain unnoticed.\nPrior to the discovery of the Stuxnet computer worm in June 2010, the security of PLCs received little attention. Modern programmable controllers generally contain real-time operating systems, which can be vulnerable to exploits in a similar way as desktop operating systems, like Microsoft Windows. PLCs can also be attacked by gaining control of a computer they communicate with. Since 2011,[ [update]] these concerns have grown \u2013 networking is becoming more commonplace in the PLC environment, connecting the previously separated plant floor networks and office networks.\nIn February 2021, Rockwell Automation publicly disclosed a critical vulnerability affecting its Logix controllers family. The secret cryptographic key used to verify communication between the PLC and workstation could be extracted from the programming software (Studio 5000 Logix Designer) and used to remotely change program code and configuration of a connected controller. The vulnerability was given a severity score of 10 out of 10 on the CVSS vulnerability scale. At the time of writing, the mitigation of the vulnerability was to limit network access to affected devices.\nSafety PLCs.\nSafety PLCs can be either a standalone device or a safety-rated hardware and functionality added to existing controller architectures (Allen-Bradley GuardLogix, Siemens F-series, etc.). These differ from conventional PLC types by being suitable for safety-critical applications for which PLCs have traditionally been supplemented with hard-wired safety relays and areas of the memory dedicated to the safety instructions. The standard of safety level is the SIL. \nA safety PLC might be used to control access to a robot cell with trapped-key access, or to manage the shutdown response to an emergency stop button on a conveyor production line. Such PLCs typically have a restricted regular instruction set augmented with safety-specific instructions designed to interface with emergency stop buttons, light screens, and other safety-related devices. \nThe flexibility that such systems offer has resulted in rapid growth of demand for these controllers.\nPLC compared with other control systems.\nPLCs are well adapted to a range of automation tasks. These are typically industrial processes in manufacturing where the cost of developing and maintaining the automation system is high relative to the total cost of the automation, and where changes to the system would be expected during its operational life. PLCs contain input and output devices compatible with industrial pilot devices and controls; little electrical design is required, and the design problem centers on expressing the desired sequence of operations. PLC applications are typically highly customized systems, so the cost of a packaged PLC is low compared to the cost of a specific custom-built controller design. On the other hand, in the case of mass-produced goods, customized control systems are economical. This is due to the lower cost of the components, which can be optimally chosen instead of a \"generic\" solution, and where the non-recurring engineering charges are spread over thousands or millions of units.\nProgrammable controllers are widely used in motion, positioning, or torque control. Some manufacturers produce motion control units to be integrated with PLC so that G-code (involving a CNC machine) can be used to instruct machine movements.\nPLC chip / embedded controller.\nThese are for small machines and systems with low or medium volume. They can execute PLC languages such as Ladder, Flow-Chart/Grafcet, etc. They are similar to traditional PLCs, but their small size allows developers to design them into custom printed circuit boards like a microcontroller, without computer programming knowledge, but with a language that is easy to use, modify and maintain. They sit between the classic PLC / micro-PLC and microcontrollers.\nMicrocontrollers.\nA microcontroller-based design would be appropriate where hundreds or thousands of units will be produced and so the development cost (design of power supplies, input/output hardware, and necessary testing and certification) can be spread over many sales, and where the end-user would not need to alter the control. Automotive applications are an example; millions of units are built each year, and very few end-users alter the programming of these controllers. However, some specialty vehicles such as transit buses economically use PLCs instead of custom-designed controls, because the volumes are low and the development cost would be uneconomical.\nSingle-board computers.\nVery complex process control, such as those used in the chemical industry, may require algorithms and performance beyond the capability of even high-performance PLCs. Very high-speed or precision controls may also require customized solutions; for example, aircraft flight controls. Single-board computers using semi-customized or fully proprietary hardware may be chosen for very demanding control applications where the high development and maintenance cost can be supported. \"Soft PLCs\" running on desktop-type computers can interface with industrial I/O hardware while executing programs within a version of commercial operating systems adapted for process control needs.\nThe rising popularity of single board computers has also had an influence on the development of PLCs. Traditional PLCs are generally closed platforms, but some newer PLCs (e.g. groov EPIC from Opto 22, ctrlX from Bosch Rexroth, PFC200 from Wago, PLCnext from Phoenix Contact, and Revolution Pi from Kunbus) provide the features of traditional PLCs on an open platform.\nProgrammable logic relays (PLR).\nIn more recent years, small products called programmable logic relays (PLRs) or smart relays, have become more common and accepted. These are similar to PLCs and are used in light industries where only a few points of I/O are needed, and low cost is desired. These small devices are typically made in a common physical size and shape by several manufacturers and branded by the makers of larger PLCs to fill their low-end product range. Most of these have 8 to 12 discrete inputs, 4 to 8 discrete outputs, and up to 2 analog inputs. Most such devices include a tiny postage stamp-sized LCD screen for viewing simplified ladder logic (only a very small portion of the program being visible at a given time) and status of I/O points, and typically these screens are accompanied by a 4-way rocker push-button plus four more separate push-buttons, similar to the key buttons on a VCR remote control, and used to navigate and edit the logic. Most have an RS-232 or RS-485 port for connecting to a PC so that programmers can use user-friendly software for programming instead of the small LCD and push-button set for this purpose. Unlike regular PLCs that are usually modular and greatly expandable, the PLRs are usually not modular or expandable, but their cost can be significantly lower than that a PLC, and they still offer robust design and deterministic execution of the logic.\nA variant of PLCs, used in remote locations is the remote terminal unit or RTU. An RTU is typically a low power, ruggedized PLC whose key function is to manage the communications links between the site and the central control system (typically SCADA) or in some modern systems, \"The Cloud\". Unlike factory automation using wired communication protocols such as Ethernet, communications links to remote sites are often radio-based and are less reliable. To account for the reduced reliability, RTU will buffer messages or switch to alternate communications paths. When buffering messages, the RTU will timestamp each message so that a full history of site events can be reconstructed. RTUs, being PLCs, have a wide range of I/O and are fully programmable, typically with languages from the IEC 61131-3 standard that is common to many PLCs, RTUs and DCSs. In remote locations, it is common to use an RTU as a gateway for a PLC, where the PLC is performing all site control and the RTU is managing communications, time-stamping events and monitoring ancillary equipment. On sites with only a handful of I/O, the RTU may also be the site PLC and will perform both communications and control functions.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

His notable comic book work includes an award-winning 12-year run on \"The Incredible Hulk\", as well as runs on \"Aquaman\", \"Young Justice\", \"SpyBoy\", \"Supergirl\", \"Fallen Angel\", \"Spider-Man\", \"Spider-Man 2099\", \"Captain Marvel\", and \"X-Factor\".\nDavid's \"Star Trek\" work included comic books and novels such as the ' book series. His other novels included film adaptations, media tie-ins, and original works, such as the \"Apropos of Nothing\" and \"Knight Life\" series. His television work includes series such as \"Babylon 5\", \"Young Justice\", ' and Nickelodeon's \"Space Cases\", which he co-created with Bill Mumy.\nDavid often jokingly described his occupation as \"Writer of Stuff\", and he was noted for his prolific writing, characterized by its mingling of real-world issues with humor and references to popular culture, as well as elements of metafiction and self-reference.\nOne of the most prolific and influential comic book writers of the modern era, David earned several awards for his work, including a 1992 Eisner Award, a 1993 \"Wizard\" Fan Award, a 1996 Haxtur Award, a 2007 Julie Award, and a 2011 GLAAD Media Award.\nEarly life.\nPeter David was born September 23, 1956, in Fort Meade, Maryland, to Gunter and Dalia David (n\u00e9e Rojansky), an Israeli Jewish mother who had worked with DNA mappers James Watson and Francis Crick, and to whom David credited his sense of humor. Peter David's paternal grandparents, Martin and Hela David, and his father, Gunter, emigrated to the United States in the 1930s after antisemitism in Nazi Germany progressed to the point that Martin's Berlin shoe store became the target of vandalism. He had two siblings, a brother Wally, seven years his junior, who works as an IT Systems Administrator in the financial sector, and a younger sister named Beth.\nDavid first became interested in comics when he was about five years old, reading copies of Harvey Comics' \"Casper\" and \"Wendy\" in a barbershop. He became interested in superheroes through the \"Adventures of Superman\" TV series. Although David's parents approved of his reading Harvey Comics and comics featuring Disney characters, they did not approve of superhero books, especially those published by Marvel Comics, feeling that characters that looked like monsters, such as the Thing or the Hulk, or who wore bug-eyed costumes, like Spider-Man, did not appear heroic. As a result, David read those comics in secret, beginning with his first Marvel book, \"Fantastic Four Annual\" #3 (November 1965), which saw the wedding of Mister Fantastic and the Invisible Woman. His parents eventually allowed him to start reading superhero titles, his favorite of which was \"Superman\". He cited John Buscema as his favorite pre-1970s artist. David attended his first comic book convention around the time that Jack Kirby's \"New Gods\" premiered, after asking his father to take him to one of Phil Seuling's shows in New York, where David obtained Kirby's autograph, his first encounter with a comics professional.\nDavid's earliest interest in writing came through the journalism work of his father, Gunter, who sometimes reviewed movies and took young Peter along (if it was age-appropriate). While Gunter wrote his reviews back at the newspaper's office, David wrote his own, portions of which sometimes found their way into Gunter's published reviews. David began to entertain the notion of becoming a professional writer at age twelve, buying a copy of \"The Guide to the Writer's Market\", and subscribing to similar-themed magazines, in the hopes of becoming a reporter.\nDavid lived in Bloomfield, New Jersey, in a small house at 11 Albert Terrace, and attended Demarest Elementary School. His family later moved to Verona, New Jersey, where he spent his adolescence. By the time he entered his teens, he had lost interest in comic books, feeling he had outgrown them. David's best friend in junior high and first year in high school, Keith, was gay, and David described how both of them were targets of ostracism and harassment from homophobes. Although his family eventually moved to Pennsylvania, his experiences in Verona soured him on that town and shaped his liberal sociopolitical positions regarding LGBT issues. He later made Verona the home location of villain Morgan le Fay in his novel \"Knight Life\", and often discussed his progressive views on LGBT issues in his column and on his blog.\nDavid's interest in comics was rekindled when he saw a copy of \"Superman vs. Muhammad Ali\" (1978) while passing a newsstand, and later, \"X-Men\" #95 (October 1975), and discovered in that latter book the \"All-New, All-Different\" team that had first appeared in \"Giant-Size X-Men\" #1 (May 1975). These two books were the first comics he had purchased in years.\nA seminal moment in the course of his aspirations occurred when he met writer Stephen King at a book signing, and told him that he was an aspiring writer. King signed David's copy of \"Danse Macabre\" with the inscription, \"Good luck with your writing career\", which David in turn inscribed onto books presented to him by fans who told him the same thing. Other authors that David cited as influences included Harlan Ellison, Arthur Conan Doyle, Robert B. Parker, Neil Gaiman, Terry Pratchett, Robert Crais, and Edgar Rice Burroughs. Specific books he mentioned as favorites included \"To Kill a Mockingbird\", \"Tarzan of the Apes\", \"The Princess Bride\", \"The Essential Ellison\", \"A Confederacy of Dunces\", \"Adams Versus Jefferson\", and \"Don Quixote\". David singled out Ellison in particular as a writer whom he tried to emulate.\nDavid attended New York University, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in journalism.\nCareer.\nEarly work.\nDavid's first professional assignment was covering the World Science Fiction Convention held in Washington in 1974 for the \"Philadelphia Bulletin\".\nDavid eventually gravitated towards fiction after his attempts at journalism did not meet with success. His first published fiction appeared in \"Asimov's Science Fiction\" in 1980. He sold an op-ed piece to \"The New York Times\", but overall his submissions that met with rejection far outnumbered those accepted.\nComics career.\n1980s.\nDavid eventually gave up on a career in writing and came to work in book publishing. His first publishing job was for the E.P. Dutton imprint Elsevier/Nelson, where he worked mainly as an assistant to the editor-in-chief. He later worked in sales and distribution for Playboy Paperbacks. He subsequently worked for five years in Marvel Comics' Sales Department, first as Assistant Direct Sales Manager under Carol Kalish, who hired him, and then succeeding Kalish as Sales Manager. During this time he made some cursory attempts to sell stories, including submission of some Moon Knight plots to Dennis O'Neil, but his efforts were unfruitful.\nThree years into David's tenure as Direct Sales Manager, Jim Owsley became editor of the Spider-Man titles. Although crossing over from sales into editorial was considered a conflict of interest in the Marvel offices, Owsley, whom David describes as a \"maverick\", was impressed with how David had not previously hesitated to work with him when Owsley was an assistant editor under Larry Hama. When Owsley became an editor, he purchased a Spider-Man story from David, which appeared in \"The Spectacular Spider-Man\" #103 (June 1985). Owsley subsequently purchased David's \"The Death of Jean DeWolff\", a violent murder mystery darker in tone than the usually lighter Spider-Man stories that ran in issues #107\u2013110 (October 1985\u00a0\u2013 January 1986) of that title. Responding to charges of conflict of interest, David made a point of not discussing editorial matters with anyone during his 9-to-5 hours as Direct Sales Manager, and decided not to exploit his position as Sales Manager by promoting the title. Although David attributed the story's poor sales to this decision, he asserted that such crossing over from Sales to Editorial was now common. In the Marvel offices, a rumor circulated that it was actually Owsley who was writing the stories attributed to David. Nonetheless, David said he was fired from \"Spectacular Spider-Man\" by Owsley due to editorial pressure by Marvel's editor-in-chief Jim Shooter, and he commented that the resentment stirred by Owsley's purchase of his stories may have permanently damaged Owsley's career. Months later, Bob Harras offered David \"The Incredible Hulk\", as it was a struggling title that no one else wanted to write, which gave David free rein with the character.\nDuring his 12-year run on \"Hulk\", David explored the recurring themes of the Hulk's multiple personality disorder, his periodic changes between the raging, less intelligent Green Hulk and the more streetwise, cerebral Grey Hulk, and of being a journeyman hero, which were inspired by \"The Incredible Hulk\" #312 (October 1985), in which writer Bill Mantlo (and possibly, according to David, Barry Windsor-Smith) had first established that Bruce Banner had suffered childhood abuse at the hands of his father Brian Banner. These aspects of the character were later used in the 2003 feature film adaptation by screenwriter Michael France and director Ang Lee. Comic Book Resources credits David with making the formerly poor-selling book \"a must-read mega-hit\". David collaborated with a number of artists who became fan-favorites on the series, including Todd McFarlane, Dale Keown, and Gary Frank. Among the new characters he created during his run on the series were the Riot Squad and the Pantheon. David wrote the first appearance of the Thunderbolts, a team created by Kurt Busiek and Mark Bagley, in \"The Incredible Hulk\" #449 (January 1997).\nIt was after he had been freelancing for a year, and into his run on \"Hulk\", that David felt that his writing career had cemented. After putting out feelers at DC Comics, and being offered the job of writing a four-issue miniseries of The Phantom by editor Mike Gold, David quit his sales position to write full-time. David had a brief tenure writing Green Lantern when the character was exclusive to the short-lived anthology series \"Action Comics Weekly\" (issues #608\u2013620) in 1988.\nDavid took over \"Dreadstar\" during its First Comics run, with issue #41 (March 1989) after Jim Starlin left the title, and remained on it until issue #64 (March 1991), the final issue of that run. David's other Marvel Comics work in the late 1980s and 1990s includes runs on \"Wolverine\", the New Universe series \"\" and \"Justice\", a run on the original \"X-Factor\", and the futuristic series \"Spider-Man 2099\", about a man in the year 2099 who takes up the mantle of Spider-Man, the title character of which David co-created. David left \"X-Factor\" after 19 issues, and he wrote the first 44 issues of \"Spider-Man 2099\" before quitting that book to protest the firing of editor Joey Cavalieri. The book was cancelled two issues later, along with the entire 2099 line.\n1990s.\nIn 1990, David wrote a seven-issue \"Aquaman\" miniseries, \"The Atlantis Chronicles\", for DC Comics, about the history of Aquaman's home of Atlantis, which David referred to as among the written works of which he was most proud, and his first time writing in the full script format. In 1994 he wrote an \"Aquaman\" miniseries, \"Aquaman: Time and Tide\", which led to a relaunched monthly \"Aquaman\" series, the first 46 issues of which he wrote from 1994 to 1998. His run on \"Aquaman\" gained notoriety, for in the book's second issue, Aquaman lost a hand, which was then replaced with a harpoon, a feature of the character that endured for the duration of David's run on the book. More broadly, his run recast the character as an aggressive man of action, one deserving of greater respect, in contrast to the \"fish-talking punch line\" into which the TV series \"Super Friends\" had rendered him. David quit that book over creative differences.\nDavid wrote the \"Star Trek\" comic book for DC from 1988 to 1991, when that company held the licensing rights to the property, though he opined that novels are better suited to \"Star Trek\", whose stories are not highly visual. He and Ron Marz cowrote the \"DC vs. Marvel\" intercompany crossover in 1996. David also had runs on \"Supergirl\" and \"Young Justice\", the latter eventually being canceled so that DC could use that book's characters in a relaunched \"Teen Titans\" monthly.\nDavid's work for Dark Horse Comics included the teen spy adventure \"SpyBoy\", which appeared in a series and a number of miniseries between 1999 and 2004, and the 2007 miniseries \"The Scream\".\nOther 1990s work includes the 1997 miniseries \"Heroes Reborn: The Return\", for Marvel, and two creator-owned properties: \"Soulsearchers and Company\", published by Claypool Comics, and the Epic Comics title \"Sachs and Violens\", which he produced with co-creator/artist George P\u00e9rez.\n2000s.\nDavid's early 2000s work includes runs on two volumes of \"Captain Marvel\" as well as the \"Before the Fantastic Four: Reed Richards\" limited series.\nDavid and his second wife, Kathleen, wrote the final English-language text for the first four volumes of the manga series \"Negima\" for Del Rey Manga.\nIn 2003, David began writing another creator-owned comic, \"Fallen Angel\", for DC Comics, which he created in order to make use of plans he had devised for Supergirl after the \"Many Happy Returns\" storyline, but which were derailed by that series' cancellation. That same year, he wrote a \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\" series for Dreamwave that tied into the animated television series broadcast that year.\nDC canceled \"Fallen Angel\" after 20 issues, but David restarted the title at IDW Publishing at the end of 2005. Other IDW work included a \"\" one-shot and the \"Spike vs. Dracula\" mini-series, both based on the character from the \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" and \"Angel\" television series.\nIn 2005, David briefly returned to \"The Incredible Hulk\", though he left after only 11 issues because of his workload. He started a new series, \"Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man\", beginning with a twelve-part crossover storyline called \"The Other\", which, along with J. Michael Straczynski's run on \"The Amazing Spider-Man\", and Reginald Hudlin's run on \"Marvel Knights Spider-Man,\" depicted the webslinger as he discovered he was dying, lost an eye during a traumatic fight with Morlun, underwent a metamorphosis, and emerged with new abilities and insights into his powers. The storyline caused some controversy among readers for its introduction of retractable stingers in Spider-Man's arms, and the establishment of his powers being derived from his status as a \"Spider-Totem\". David's final issue of that title was #23.\nDavid wrote a \"MadroX\" miniseries that year, whose success led to a relaunch of a monthly \"X-Factor\" volume 3 written by him. This was a revamped version of the title starring both Madrox and other members of the former \"X-Factor\" title that David had written in the early 1990s, now working as investigators in a detective agency of that name. David's work on the title garnered praise from Ain't it Cool News, and David stated that the opt in/opt out policy and greater planning with which Marvel now executes crossover storylines made his second stint on the title far easier. His decision to explicitly establish male characters Shatterstar and Rictor as sharing a sexual attraction to one another (a confirmation of clues that had been established in \"X-Force\" years earlier in issues such as \"X-Force\" #25, 34, 43, 49, 56 and \"X-Force '99 Annual\"), drew criticism from Shatterstar's co-creator, Rob Liefeld, though Editor-in-Chief Joe Quesada supported David's story. David eventually won a 2011 GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding Comic Book for his work on the title.\nOn February 11, 2006, David announced at the WonderCon convention in California in that he had signed an exclusive contract with Marvel Comics. \"Fallen Angel\", \"Soulsearchers and Company\" and David's \"Spike\" miniseries were \"grandfathered\" into the contract, so as to not be affected by it. The first new project undertaken by David after entering into the contract, which he announced on April 5, 2006, was writing the dialogue for \"\", the comic book spin-off of Stephen King's \"The Dark Tower\" novels, which was to be illustrated by Jae Lee, as well as scripting the subsequent \"Dark Tower\" comics.\nDavid took over Marvel's \"She-Hulk\" after writer Dan Slott's departure, beginning with issue #22. His run, which won praise, ended with issue #38, when the series was canceled. He wrote a 2008\u201309 \"Sir Apropos of Nothing\" miniseries, based on the character from his novels, which was published by IDW Publishing.\nDavid's other 2000s comics based on licensed or adapted properties include \"Halo: Helljumper\", a 2009 miniseries based on the \"Halo\" video game, a 2009 \"\" manga book published by Del Rey, \"Ben Folds Four\", a \"Little Mermaid\" story in Jim Valentino's \"Fractured Fables\" anthology that was praised by Ain't It Cool News, an adaptation of the 1982 film \"Tron\" that was released to tie in with that film's , and a \"John Carter of Mars\" prequel to the 2012 feature film. In 2010, he co-wrote \"The Spider-Man Vault: A Museum-in-a-Book with Rare Collectibles Spun from Marvel's Web\" with Robert Greenberger. David wrote the script for \"Avengers: Season One\", an original graphic novel published to promote the DVD release of \"The Avengers\".\n2010s.\nOn November 24, 2011, David was one of the balloon handlers who pulled the Spider-Man balloon during the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade.\nIn October 2013, \"X-Factor\" ended its run with issue #262, concluding the X-Factor Investigations incarnation of the series. The book was then relaunched as \"All-New X-Factor\", a new series with artist Carmine Di Giandomenico, as a part of the All-New Marvel NOW! initiative announced at the 2013 New York Comic Con. The opening storyline, which continues events from issue #260 of the previous series, establishes the new corporate-sponsored version of the team, and includes Polaris, Quicksilver, and Gambit.\nIn July 2014, David returned to Spider-Man 2099, writing the second volume of \"Spider-Man 2099\" with artist Will Sliney. With this series, David was again writing two series, \"X-Factor\" and \"Spider-Man 2099\", after having previously done so decades prior, a coincidence that prompted him to joke at the June 2014 Special Edition NYC convention, \"I don't know whether to be proud of that or if I'm in a rut!\"\nIn 2014, David wrote a six-part story-arc for \"The Phantom\" for publishing company Hermes Press, a story that David, reportedly had wanted to write for many years.\nIn 2015, Simon and Schuster published Stan Lee's autobiographical graphic novel, \"Amazing Fantastic Incredible\", which David co-wrote, and which became a \"New York Times\" bestseller in its first week of release.\nIn April 2017, following the conclusion of the Spider-Man storyline \", which saw the return of Ben Reilly, Marvel premiered the monthly series \", with David as writer. David explained to Syfy Wire that when Marvel offered him the job, he was initially ambivalent, as Ben Reilly had never been his favorite incarnation of Spider-Man, and given Reilly's recent emergence as the villainous Jackal. However, David gave further consideration to the fact that a book whose main character had a skewed, villainous worldview was not something Marvel had historically done much of, and decided that the premise presented itself with opportunities that intrigued him enough to accept the job. His other Spider-Man work during this decade included a 2019 five-issue miniseries \"Symbiote Spider-Man\", which holds a 7.5 out of 10 rating at the review aggregator Comic Book Roundup, and the 2020 follow-up miniseries \"Symbiote Spider-Man: Alien Reality\", which holds a 7.6 rating at Comic Book Roundup.\nNovels.\nDavid's career as a novelist developed concurrently with his comic-book writing career. David had been working at a publisher that went out of business, and a former coworker from that publisher became his agent, through whom he sold his first novel, \"Knight Life\", to Ace Books. Although the sale was made before he wrote any comic books, the novel was not published until eighteen months later, in 1987. The novel depicts the reappearance of King Arthur in modern-day New York City. Another early novel of his, \"Howling Mad\", is about a wolf that turns into a human after being bitten by a werewolf. Ace Books hired David to write the \"Photon\" and \"Psi-Man\" novels, though they published them under the \"house name\" David Peters, over David's objections. David updated \"Knight Life\" years later when Penguin Putnam brought it back into print in 2003, and made it a trilogy with the sequels \"One Knight Only\" and \"Fall of Knight\", which were published in 2004 and 2007, respectively. Penguin rereleased \"Howling Mad\" and the \"Psi-Man books\" under David's actual name.\nDavid first began writing \"Star Trek\" novels at the request of Pocket Books editor Dave Stern, who was a fan of David's \"Star Trek\" comic book work. His \"Star Trek\" novels are among those for which he is best known, including \"Q-in-Law\"; \"I, Q\"; \"Vendetta\"; \"Q-Squared\". His most popular novel was 1993's \"Imzadi\", which told the backstory first romance of the characters William Riker and Deanna Troi. He created the ongoing novel series, \",\" a spin-off from \",\" with John J. Ordover in 1997. David wrote 21 books in that series, a number of which were New York Times best sellers. That line ended in September 2015 with the publication of the third part of the digital novel, \"The Returned\". David's other science fiction tie-in novels include writing five \"Babylon 5\" novels, three of which were originals, and two of which were adaptations of the TV movies ' and '.\nHis other novel adaptations include those of the films \"The Return of Swamp Thing\", \"The Rocketeer\", \"Batman Forever\", \"Spider-Man\", \"Spider-Man 2\", \"Spider-Man 3\", \"Hulk\", \"The Incredible Hulk\", \"Fantastic Four\", and \"Iron Man\". He wrote an original Hulk novel, \"The Incredible Hulk: What Savage Beast\", and an adaptation of an unused \"Alien Nation\" television script, \"Body and Soul\".\nDavid's 2009 novel \"Tigerheart\" is a re-imagining of Peter Pan with a mix of new and old characters, told as a Victorian bedtime story, much like the classic tale. It was praised by Ain't It Cool News, and honored by the \"School Library Journal\" as one of 2008's Best Adult Books for High School Students. His \"Sir Apropos of Nothing\" fantasy trilogy, \"Sir Apropos of Nothing\", \"The Woad to Wuin\" and \"Tong Lashing\", features characters and settings completely of David's own creation, as does his 2007 fantasy novel, \"Darkness of the Light\", which is the first in a new trilogy of novels titled \"The Hidden Earth\". The second installment, \"The Highness of the Low\", was scheduled to be published in September 2009, but David related on his blog that it was delayed until the winter of 2012.\nDavid's 2010 novel work includes \"Year of the Black Rainbow\", a novel cowritten with musician Claudio Sanchez of the band Coheed and Cambria, that was released with the band's album of the same name, and a \"Fable\" original novel \"\", set between the events of \"Fable II\" and \"Fable III\". In April 2011, David announced that, in addition to another \"Fable\" novel, he and a number of other writers, including Glenn Hauman, Mike Friedman and Bob Greenberger, were assembling an electronic publishing endeavor called Crazy Eight Press to publish e-books directly to fans, the first of which would be David's Arthurian story, \"The Camelot Papers\". David explained that the second book in his \"Hidden Earth\" trilogy would be published through Crazy Eight. In September 2013, David acknowledged that books published through Crazy Eight were not as lucrative for him as those for publishers that pay him advances, and announced that his then-impending novel, \"ARTFUL: Being the Heretofore Secret History of that Unique Individual, The Artful Dodger, Hunter of Vampyres (Amongst Other Things.)\", would be published by Amazon.com.\nWriting habits and approach.\nDavid stated that he tried to block out different days and different times to work on different projects. He usually worked in the morning, for example, on novels, and did comics-related work in the afternoon. Having previously used Smith Corona typewriters, he wrote on a Sony Vaio desktop computer, using Microsoft Word for his comics and novel work, and Final Draft for his screenplays. When writing novels, he sometimes outlined the story, and sometimes improvised as he was writing. Following his stroke in December 2012, David began using DragonDictate to write. Todd McFarlane's original art for the cover of \"The Incredible Hulk\" #340, featuring Wolverine, which McFarlane gave to David as a gift, hung in David's office.\nDavid previously wrote his comic book scripts using the Marvel Method, but due to his tendency to overplot, as during his collaboration with McFarlane on \"The Incredible Hulk\", he switched to the full script method, which he continued to use as of 2003[ [update]]. He stated that he preferred to plot his comics stories in six-month arcs. He stated that when he worked on a particular title, he always did so with a particular person or group of people in mind to which he dedicated it, explaining that he had written \"Supergirl\" for his daughters, \"Young Justice\" for a son he might one day have had and \"The Incredible Hulk\" for his first wife, Myra, who first urged him to accept the job of writing that book. David further explained that the events of his own life were sometimes reflected in his work, as when, for example, following the breakup of his first marriage, the direction of \"The Incredible Hulk\" faltered, with the Hulk wandering the world aimlessly, hopelessly looking to be loved.\nDavid stated that his favorite female character of his own creation was Lee, the protagonist of \"Fallen Angel\", which he said is derived from the positive female fan reaction to that character. Characters that David did not write but which he expressed an interest in writing for the comics medium included Batman, Tarzan, Doc Savage, the Dragonriders of Pern, the Steed/Peel Avengers, and Dracula. He specifically mentioned interest in writing a \"Tarzan vs. the Phantom\" story.\nOther media.\nDavid wrote for several television series and video games. He wrote two scripts for \"Babylon 5\" (the second-season episodes \"Soul Mates\" and \"There All the Honor Lies\"), and the episode \"Ruling from the Tomb\" for its sequel series, \"Crusade\". With actor/writer Bill Mumy, he was co-creator of the television series \"Space Cases\", which ran for two seasons on Nickelodeon, and which proved to be his most lucrative work. David himself appeared as Ben, the father of series regular Bova, in the second-season episode \"Long Distance Calls\". David's oldest daughter, Shana, later appeared as Pezu, the emotionally disturbed sentient computer in the series finale \"A Friend in Need\".\nDavid wrote and co-produced several films for Full Moon Entertainment including \"Trancers 4\", \"Trancers 5\", \"Oblivion\", and \"\". He made cameo appearances in some of the films as well and was briefly signed to their unrealized Silver Moon Comics line.\nDavid wrote an unproduced script for the fifth season of \"Babylon 5\" called \"Gut Reactions\", which he wrote with Bill Mumy.\nDavid wrote \"In Charm's Way\", an episode of '. The script was recorded in early 2009, and the episode premiered November 13, 2009. He later wrote three episodes of the sequel series ', the first of which, \"Reflected Glory\", premiered October 15, 2010.\nDavid wrote the script for the Xbox 360 video game \"Shadow Complex\", which debuted in August 2009.\nDavid wrote several episodes of the \"Young Justice\" animated TV series, which premiered in 2010, and is based on the comic book series he wrote from 1998 to 2003. The first episode he wrote was \"Secrets\". The same year, he wrote a graphic novel adaptation of the video game \"Epic Mickey\", and a prequel digicomic, \"Disney's Epic Mickey: Tales of Wasteland\".\nIn 2011 David wrote the video game \"\".\nAt the 2012 San Diego Comic-Con, Stan Lee announced his new YouTube channel, \"Stan Lee's World of Heroes\", which airs several programs created by Lee and other creators. One of them, \"Head Cases\", is a superhero sitcom created by David and his wife Kathleen and produced by David M. Uslan. The series centers on Thunderhead, a would-be hero whose inability to utilize his ability to produce loud thunderblasts without injury to himself leads him to become a source of comedic derision in the superhero community. The series, which explores events that occur in between the battles typically seen in comic books, was based on a concept originated by Uslan, and partly inspired by \"It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia\". David described \"Head Cases\" as a 75-minute film divided into 5-minute webisodes. The series featured guest appearances by other industry personalities, including Stan Lee, who appears as himself, functioning in a similar manner to Norm Peterson from \"Cheers\".\nPublic image.\nOn more than one occasion, editorial problems or corporate pressure to modify or re-script his plotlines prompted David to leave books, particularly his decision to terminate his first run on Marvel's \"X-Factor\", due to constantly having to constrain his plots to accommodate crossover events with other books. He resigned from \"Spider-Man 2099\" to protest the firing of editor Joey Cavalieri and from \"Aquaman\" over other creative differences. When David abruptly left his first stint on \"The Incredible Hulk\" due to editorial pressures, some of the plot points of the character that David established were retconned by later creative teams.\nIn his \"But I Digress\" column, which began appearing in the \"Comics Buyer's Guide\" on July 27, 1990, and in his blog, in operation from April 2002, David was outspoken in many of his views pertaining to the comic book industry and numerous other subjects. He criticized the low regard in which writers are held, the practice of selling polybagged comics, so-called \"poster covers\" that showcase a character without indicating anything about the comic's content, the meaninglessness of killing off characters to be eventually revived, the poor commitment on the part of some to maintaining continuity in shared fictional universes, and the emphasis on gearing monthly comics series toward eventual collection into trade paperbacks. David opined that failure on the part of consumers to purchase the monthly individual issues in favor of waiting for the trade collections hurts the sales of the monthly and its chances of being collected at all. A father of four daughters, David worked on a number of series that feature female leads, such as \"Supergirl\", \"Fallen Angel\" and \"She-Hulk\", and he lamented that the American comic book market was not very supportive of such books. David spoke out about fans who were abusive or threatening to creators, and against copyright infringement, particularly that which is committed through peer-to-peer file sharing and posting literary works in their entirety on the Internet without the permission of the copyright holder.\nOn many occasions, he offered criticisms of specific publishers, as when he criticized \"Wizard\" magazine for ageism. He criticized companies for not sufficiently compensating the creators of their long-standing and lucrative characters, such as Marvel Comics for its treatment of Blade creator Marv Wolfman and Archie Comics for its treatment of \"Josie and the Pussycats\" creator Dan DeCarlo. He criticized publishers for various other business practices, including Marvel and Image Comics. He defended said companies from criticism he feels is unfounded, as when he defended Marvel from a February 17, 1992, \"Barron's\" magazine article. He criticized deletionists on Wikipedia on more than one occasion.\nOn occasion, he disagreed publicly with specific industry personalities such as Frank Miller and Jim Shooter. Particularly publicized were his disagreements with \"Spawn\" creator Todd McFarlane in 1992 and 1993, in the wake of the formation of Image Comics, the company McFarlane co-founded. This came to a head during a public debate they participated in at Philadelphia's Comicfest convention in October 1993, which was moderated by artist George P\u00e9rez. McFarlane claimed that Image was not being treated fairly by the media, and by David in particular. The three judges, Maggie Thompson, editor of the \"Comics Buyer's Guide\", William Christensen of \"Wizard Press\", and John Danovich of the magazine \"Hero Illustrated\", voted 2\u20131 in favor of David, with Danovich voting the debate a tie. David later criticized McFarlane for other business practices, and engaged in public disagreements with \"The Comics Journal\" editor Gary Groth, Erik Larsen, Rob Liefeld, Marvel editor-in-chief Joe Quesada, writer/director Kevin Smith, DC Comics vice president and executive editor Dan DiDio, and John Byrne.\nDespite his differences with Byrne, David stated that he was still a fan of Byrne's, citing Byrne's work on \"X-Men\", \"Fantastic Four\", \"Next Men\", \"Alpha Flight\" and \"Babe\".\nPolitically, David identified himself as liberal. He was critical of the George W. Bush administration in general, and the Iraq War in particular, as well as other Republicans and the religious right. He also became a staunch critic of President Donald Trump and his administration, criticizing his policies on a weekly basis. He spoke out in favor of Israel's right to defend itself from aggressors, and opined that certain criticisms of Israel indicated bias and double standards. He favored gun control, and held progressive or liberal views on LGBT issues, including favoring gay marriage and allowing openly homosexual individuals to serve in the military. He opposed capital punishment. He was an advocate of freedom of speech, having criticized various publicized instances of censorship in general, such as the targeting of comic book retailers for prosecution for selling certain comic books, and the Comics Code Authority in particular. He was a promoter and activist for the Comic Book Legal Defense Fund, which comes to the aid of such creators and retailers. He criticized ideas associated with liberalism or political correctness, such as certain publicized cases of alleged sexual harassment or discrimination that he deems unfounded, and did not shy away from criticizing liberals and Democrats, including Bill Clinton, Al Gore, Hillary Clinton, Michelle Obama, Caroline Kennedy, and Barack Obama.\nIn October 2016, David generated controversy for remarks he made during a panel discussion at the New York Comic Con to Vicente Rodriguez, a fan and the founder of Roma Pop, an organization that seeks to promote more positive representation of the Romani in comics. Rodriguez had asked speakers at multiple panels at the convention about greater Romani representation in comics, in light of what he said were stereotypical depictions of that group. When he asked David about what the public could do about Marvel's editorial policies regarding this, David related an anecdote from a 1993 trip to Bucharest, where he was told by his guide that the crippled children he saw had been maimed by their parents to improve their success as beggars. David then angrily rebuffed further interjections by Rodriguez before moving onto the next question. David would later defend these beliefs on his blog, insisting that he had written Romani characters like Quicksilver in a positive manner, and was angered by the crippling of children. Comics Beat, in reporting on the incident, stated that David's claim about the children is an urban myth commonly circulated in Romania, and that the malformed limbs seen in such children more likely resulted from lack of medical care, owing to the Romani distrust of the medical establishment that resulted from the forcible sterilization programs imposed upon them in many European nations until the 2000s. Two days after his first blog post, and the day after the Comics Beat article, David published a second blog post in which he apologized for his conduct, stating that after researching the matter, he concluded that the children he saw likely suffered from genetic conditions, and that he had no right to speak as he had to Rodriguez. David also related that he had apologized to Rodriguez in person in subsequent encounters at the convention, and resolved to treat Romani characters with respect, as he believed he always had.\nPersonal life.\nBeginning in the early 1990s, David lived in Patchogue, Long Island, where he lived until his death.\nDavid met his first wife, Myra Kasman, at a \"Star Trek\" convention. They married in June 1977, with his childhood friend Keith serving as best man. Together they had three daughters, Shana, Guinevere and Ariel. They separated in late 1996 and were divorced by 1998. David began dating Kathleen O'Shea, a bookseller, puppeteer and writer/editor in 1998. After dating for three years, David proposed to O'Shea at the Adventurers Club in Disney World on September 3, 2000. They married on May 26, 2001, in Atlanta, Georgia. Their daughter, Caroline Helen David, was born on December 5, 2002, and named after David's deceased friend and co-worker, Carol Kalish. David and his family lived in Suffolk County, New York, on the south shore of Long Island, where his favorite local comics shop was Fourth World Comics in Smithtown, New York. David's father, Gunter, died of cancer on April 20, 2015. David's mother, Dalia, died May 27, 2017.\nDavid had been a Conservative Jew but, as of October 2003, attended a Reform synagogue. His Hebrew name in patronymic form was Jacob Ben Joachim. However, he expressed reservations about organized religion.\nDavid was an avid fan of bowling, and a bowler himself, as is his daughter Ariel. He was a fan of the New York Mets, and practiced tai chi. His favorite music included The Beatles, and his favorite albums included Harry Chapin's \"Verities and Balderdash\" and the soundtracks to \"Amadeus\" and \"\". His favorite movies included the James Bond films, \"The Adventures of Robin Hood\", \"Casablanca\", and the early Johnny Weissmuller \"Tarzan\" films. His favorite TV shows included \"Doctor Who\", \"Hill Street Blues\", \"Charmed\", \"Carnivale\", \"Boston Public\", \"The Practice\", \"Friends\", \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\", \"Angel\", \"Alias\" and \"The West Wing\". He was a fan of musicals, in particular \"1776\", \"Man of La Mancha\", \"Li'l Abner\" and \"Into the Woods\", with a taste for Lerner and Loewe and Stephen Sondheim. He also acted in local stage productions.\nHealth and death.\nIn June 2010, David's wife announced on his website that he had successfully undergone surgery to relieve serious back pain. He later explained on his site that the pain, which he had been suffering in his hips and knees for three weeks, left him unable to function, and was eventually diagnosed as a herniated disc caused by bone fragments and fluid buildup. He underwent a three-hour discectomy and was told his full strength would return in six months.\nOn December 29, 2012, David suffered a ischemic stroke while on vacation in Florida. The stroke occurred in the pons section of David's brain, from which he lost most of the use of his right arm and his right leg, and suffered from blurred vision in his right eye. While a total recovery was indicated to be unlikely, he remained in good spirits, and underwent physical therapy in order to return to his prior routine. Two and a half months later, his condition had improved. His vision problems were gone, and he was able to navigate around his house without a wheelchair, and resume bowling and practicing tai chi. He had made slow and steady progress on his right leg and arm, and was continuing his therapy. Six months after the stroke, David had completed his physical therapy, though he still suffered some pain in his shoulder, and intended to work on improving his reduced endurance. David revealed in January 2015 that he had been diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes a year prior.\nIn March 2017, David announced on his blog that the Internal Revenue Service was demanding that he pay US$88,000 in unpaid taxes, penalty and interest, which began to accumulate when his divorce from his first wife used up his savings. He started a GoFundMe campaign to raise the money from friends and fans, which raised $68,000 by April 12. David announced that he would begin a Patreon account where he would publish new work, and which would be used to pay taxes, and asked his readers for their content requests. By May 11, having sold some original comics artwork acquired two decades earlier, the Davids' debts were paid off.\nOn November 27, 2022, another GoFundMe was launched by Graham Murphy, who explained David's health was once again in decline following kidney failure, another series of strokes, and a mild heart attack, in order to defray his \"medical debt due to Peter being rejected for Medicaid.\" By May 20, 2025, David's inability to cough or clear his throat required him to be placed on a ventilator under light sedation. David died on the evening of May 24, at the age of 68, at NYU Langone Hospital \u2014 Suffolk, after a long hospitalization there for the strokes and other health conditions. According to \"Newsday\", the cause of death was a cardiac event, although \"The New York Times\" cited his wife, who said that it had been another stroke. David was cremated and no services were held, although Kathleen planned to hold a memorial later in the year.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It has a reputation as an academic city and centre of research, being home to the Tshwane University of Technology (TUT), the University of Pretoria (UP), the University of South Africa (UNISA), the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), and the Human Sciences Research Council. It also hosts the National Research Foundation and the South African Bureau of Standards. Pretoria was one of the host cities of the 2010 FIFA World Cup.\nPretoria is the central part of the City of Tshwane Metropolitan Municipality which was formed by the amalgamation of several former local authorities, including Bronkhorstspruit, Centurion, Cullinan, Hammanskraal and Soshanguve. Some have proposed changing the official name from Pretoria to Tshwane, which has caused some public controversy.\nPretoria is named after the Voortrekker leader Andries Pretorius, and South Africans sometimes call it the \"Jacaranda City\", because of the thousands of jacaranda trees planted along its streets and in its parks and gardens.\nHistory.\nPretoria was founded in 1855 by Marthinus Pretorius, a leader of the Voortrekkers, who named it after his father Andries Pretorius and chose a spot on the banks of the \"Apies rivier\" (Afrikaans for \"Monkeys river\") to be the new capital of the South African Republic (; ZAR). The elder Pretorius had become a national hero of the Voortrekkers after his victory over Dingane and the Zulus in the Battle of Blood River in 1838. The elder Pretorius also negotiated the Sand River Convention (1852), in which the United Kingdom acknowledged the independence of the Transvaal. It became the capital of the South African Republic on 1 May 1860.\nThe founding of Pretoria as the capital of the South African Republic can be seen as marking the end of the Boers' settlement movements of the Great Trek.\nBoer Wars.\nDuring the First Boer War, the city was besieged by Republican forces in December 1880 and March 1881. The peace treaty that ended the war was signed in Pretoria on 3 August 1881 at the Pretoria Convention.\nThe Second Boer War resulted in the end of the Transvaal Republic and start of British hegemony in South Africa. The city surrendered to British forces under Frederick Roberts on 5 June 1900 and the conflict was ended in Pretoria with the signing of the Peace of Vereeniging on 31 May 1902 at Melrose House.\nThe Pretoria Forts were built for the defence of the city just prior to the Second Boer War. Though some of these forts are today in ruins, a number of them have been preserved as national monuments.\nUnion of South Africa.\nThe Boer Republics of the ZAR and the Orange River Colony were united with the Cape Colony and Natal Colony in 1910 to become the Union of South Africa. Pretoria then became the administrative capital of the whole of South Africa, with Cape Town serving as the legislative capital and Bloemfontein as the judicial capital. Between 1910 and 1994, the city was also the capital of the province of Transvaal. (As the capital of the ZAR, Pretoria had superseded Potchefstroom in that role.)\nOn 14 October 1931, Pretoria achieved official city status. When South Africa became a republic in 1961, Pretoria remained its administrative capital.\nGeography.\nPretoria is situated approximately north-northeast of Johannesburg in the northeast of South Africa, in a transitional belt between the plateau of the Highveld to the south and the lower-lying Bushveld to the north. It lies at an altitude of about above sea level, in a warm, sheltered, fertile valley, surrounded by the hills of the Magaliesberg range.\nClimate.\nPretoria has a monsoon-influenced humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cwa) with long hot, rainy summers, and short, dry and mild winters. The city experiences the typical winters of South Africa, with cold, clear nights and mild to moderately warm days. Although the average lows during winter are mild, it can get cold due to the clear skies, with night time low temperatures in recent years in the range of .\nThe average annual temperature is . This is rather high, considering the city's relatively high altitude of about , and is due mainly to its sheltered valley position, which acts as a heat trap and cuts it off from cool southerly and south-easterly air masses for much of the year.\nRain is chiefly concentrated in the summer months, with drought conditions prevailing over the winter months, when frosts may be sharp. Snowfall is an extremely rare event; snowflakes were spotted in 1959, 1968 and 2012 in the city, but the city has never experienced an accumulation in its history.\nDuring a nationwide heat wave in November 2011, Pretoria experienced temperatures that reached , unusual for that time of the year. Similar record-breaking extreme heat events also occurred in January 2013, when Pretoria experienced temperatures exceeding on several days. The year 2014 was one of the wettest on record for the city. A total of fell up to the end of December, with recorded in this month alone. In 2015, Pretoria saw its worst drought since 1982; the month of November 2015 saw new records broken for high temperatures, with recorded on 11 November after three weeks of temperatures between and . Pretoria reached a new record high of on 7 January 2016.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nDepending on the extent of the area understood to constitute \"Pretoria\", the population ranges from 700,000 to 2.95\u00a0million. The main languages spoken in Pretoria are Sepedi, Setswana, Xitsonga, Tshivenda, Afrikaans, and English. The city of Pretoria has the largest white population in Africa. Since its founding, it has been a major Afrikaner population centre, and there are roughly 1\u00a0million Afrikaners living in or around the city.\nEthnic groups.\nEven since the end of Apartheid, Pretoria itself has had a white majority, albeit with an ever-increasing black middle-class. However, in the townships of Mamelodi, Soshanguve and Atteridgeville black people make up close to all of the population. The largest white ethnic group are the Afrikaners and the largest black ethnic group are the Bapedi.\nThe lower estimate for the population of Pretoria includes largely former white-designated areas, and there is therefore a white majority. However, including the geographically separate townships increases Pretoria's population beyond a million and makes whites a minority.\nPretoria's Indians were ordered to move from Pretoria to Laudium on 6 June 1958.\nCityscape.\nPretoria is known as the \"Jacaranda City\" due to the approximately 60,000-70,000 Jacarandas that line its streets. Purple is a colour often associated with the city and is often included on local council logos and services such as the A Re Yeng rapid bus system and the logo of the local Jacaranda FM radio station.\n\"&lt;templatestyles src=\"Sister-inline/styles.css\"/&gt; Media related to at Wikimedia Commons\"\nArchitecture.\nPretoria has over the years had very diverse cultural influences and this is reflected in the architectural styles that can be found in the city. It ranges from 19th century Dutch, German and British colonial architecture to modern, postmodern, neomodern, and art deco architecture styles with a good mix of a uniquely South African style.\nSome of the notable structures in Pretoria include the late 19th century Palace of Justice, the early 20th century Union Buildings, the post-war Voortrekker Monument, the diverse buildings dotting the main campuses of both the University of Pretoria and the University of South Africa, traditional Cape Dutch style Mahlamba Ndlopfu (the President's House), the Neo-Byzantine Old Synagogue, the more modern Reserve Bank of South Africa (office skyscraper) and the Telkom Lukasrand Tower. Other well-known structures and buildings include the Loftus Versfeld Stadium, The South African State Theatre and the Oliver Tambo building which is the Headquarters of the Department of International Relations and Cooperation.\nCentral business district.\nDespite the many corporate offices, small businesses, shops, and government departments that are situated in Pretoria's sprawling suburbs, its Central Business District still retains its status as the traditional centre of government and commerce. Many banks, businesses, large corporations, shops, shopping centres, and other businesses are situated in the city centre which is towered by several large skyscrapers, the tallest of which is the Poyntons Building ( tall), the ABSA Building ( tall) and the Reserve Bank of South Africa building ( tall).\nThe area contains a large number of historical buildings, monuments, and museums that include the Pretoria City Hall, National Library of South Africa, Pretorius Square, Church Square (along with its many historical buildings and statues), and the Ou Raadsaal. There is also the Transvaal Museum (the country's leading natural history museum, which although it has changed venues a number of times, has been around since 1892), the National Zoological Gardens of South Africa (or more colloquially known as the Pretoria Zoo), Melrose House Museum in Jacob Mar\u00e9 Street, the Pretoria Art Museum and the African Window Cultural History Museum.\nSeveral National Departments also have Head Offices in the Central Business district such as the Department of Health, Basic Education, Transport, Higher Education and Training, Sport and Recreation, Justice and Constitutional Development, Public Service and Administration, Water and Environmental Affairs and the National Treasury. The district also has a high number of residential buildings which house people who primarily work in the district.\nParks and gardens.\nPretoria is home to the National Zoological Gardens of South Africa, as well as the Pretoria National Botanical Garden. There are also a number of smaller parks and gardens located throughout the city, including the Austin Roberts Bird Sanctuary, Pretorius Square gardens, the Pretoria Rosarium, Church Square, Pretoria Showgrounds, Springbok Park, Freedom Park, Jan Cilliers Park and Burgers Park, the oldest park in the city and now a national monument. In the suburbs there are also several parks that are notable: Rietondale Park, \"Die Proefplaas\" in the Queenswood suburb, Magnolia Dell Park, Nelson Mandela Park and Mandela Park Peace Garden and Belgrave Square Park.\nJacaranda city.\nPretoria's nickname \"the Jacaranda City\" comes from the around 70,000 jacaranda trees that grow in Pretoria and decorate the city each October with their purple blossoms. The first two trees were planted in 1888 in the garden of local gardener, J.D. Cilliers, at Myrtle Lodge on Celliers Street in Sunnyside. He obtained the seedlings from a Cape Town nurseryman who had harvested them in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The two trees still stand on the grounds of the Sunnyside Primary School.\nThe jacaranda comes from tropical South America and belongs to the family Bignoniaceae. There are around fifty species of jacaranda, but the one found most often in the warmer areas of Southern Africa is Jacaranda mimosifolia.\nAt the end of the 19th century, the flower and tree grower James Clark imported jacaranda seedlings from Australia and began growing them on a large scale. In November 1906, he donated two hundred small saplings to the Pretoria City Council, which planted them on Koch Street (today Bosman Street). The city engineer Walton Jameson, soon known as \"Jacaranda Jim\", launched a programme to plant jacaranda trees throughout Pretoria, and by 1971 there would already be 55,000 of them in the city.\nMost jacarandas in Pretoria are lilac in colour, but there are also white ones planted on Herbert Baker Street in Groenkloof.\nThe Jacaranda Carnival is an old tradition that was held from 1939 to 1964. After a hiatus of over twenty years, it resumed in 1985. Festivities include a colourful march and the crowning of the Jacaranda Queen.\nTransportation.\nRailway.\nCommuter rail services around Pretoria are operated by Metrorail. The routes, originating from the city centre, extend south to Germiston and Johannesburg, west to Atteridgeville, northwest to Ga-Rankuwa, north to Soshanguve and east to Mamelodi. Via the Pretoria\u2013Maputo railway it is possible to access the port of Maputo, in the east.\nThe Gautrain high-speed railway line runs from the eastern suburb of Hatfield to Pretoria Station and then southwards to Centurion, Midrand, Marlboro, Sandton, Rhodesfield, OR Tambo International Airport, Rosebank and Johannesburg.\nPretoria Station is a departure point for the Blue Train luxury train. Rovos Rail, a luxury mainline train safari service operates from the colonial-style railway station at Capital Park. The South African Friends of the Rail have recently moved their vintage train trip operations from the Capital Park station to the Hercules station.\nBuses.\nVarious bus companies exist in Pretoria, of which PUTCO is one of the oldest and most recognised. Tshwane municipality provides the remainder of the bus services.\nRoad.\nThe N1 is the major freeway that runs through Pretoria. It enters the city from the south as the Ben Schoeman Highway. At the Brakfontein Interchange in Centurion, the Ben Schoeman Highway becomes the N14 to Pretoria Central, the N1 turns north-east, then north, as the Eastern Bypass, bisecting the large expanse of the eastern suburbs, routing traffic from Johannesburg to Polokwane and the north of the country. The N1 is a toll road north of Pretoria. The R101 is the original N1, and served the same function before the construction of the highway. It runs through the centre of the city on regular streets rather than the eastern suburbs.\nThe N4 enters the city as a highway from eMalahleni in the east, merging with the N1 at the Proefplaas Interchange. It begins again north of the city, branching west from the N1 as the Platinum Highway, forming the Northern Bypass, and heading to Rustenburg. The N4 runs east\u2013west through South Africa, connecting Maputo to Gaborone. The N4 is a toll road. Before the Platinum Highway was built, the N4 continued passed the Proefplaas Interchange to the city centre, where it became a regular road, before again becoming a partially-tolled highway west of the city towards Hartbeespoort. These roads through the city centre are now designated as the M2 (from the Proefplaas Interchange to Arcadia) and the M4 (from Arcadia to Hartbeespoort).\nThere is a third, original east\u2013west road: the R104, previously named Church Street, also from eMalahleni in the east through Pretoria to Hartbeespoort and Rustenburg in the west. Church Street has been renamed as Stanza Bopape Street from the M16 to Nelson Mandela Drive (M3), Helen Joseph Street from the M3 to Church Square, WF Nkomo Street from Church Square to the R511 (south-east of Hartbeespoort) and Elias Motswaledi Street from the R511 to Pelindaba.\nThe N14 starts from the R101 just south of the Pretoria CBD, heading south as the Ben Schoeman Freeway. At the Brakfontein interchange in Centurion, the Ben Schoeman Freeway becomes the N1 to Johannesburg, and the N14 continues as the intersecting west-south-westerly highway towards Krugersdorp. The R114 parallels the N14 from Centurion to Muldersdrift.\nThe R21 provides a second north\u2013south highway, further east. It starts from the Fountains Circle south of the city centre, heading south-east to Monument Park, where it becomes a highway. It crosses the N1 at the Flying Saucer Interchange and runs north\u2013south towards Ekurhuleni (specifically Kempton Park and Boksburg). Importantly, it links Pretoria with the OR Tambo International Airport in Kempton Park.\nThe R80 highway (Mabopane Highway) is a highway in the north-west of the city. The highway begins in Soshanguve and it terminates just north of the city centre (in Roseville) at an intersection with the M1.\nPretoria is also served by many regional roads. The R55 starts at an interchange with the R80, and runs north\u2013south from Pretoria West to Sandton. The R50 starts from the N1 in the south-east of the city, and heads south-east towards Bapsfontein and Delmas. The R511 runs north\u2013south from Sandton towards Brits and barely by-passes Pretoria to the west. The R514 starts from the M1, north of the city centre, and terminates at the R511 in Hartbeespoort. The R513 crosses Pretoria's northern suburbs from east to west. It links Pretoria to Cullinan and Bronkhorstspruit in the east and Hartbeespoort in the west. The R566 takes origin in Pretoria's northern suburbs, connecting Pretoria to Brits. The R573 (also called \"Moloto Road\") starts from the R513, just east of the town and heads north-east to KwaMhlanga and Siyabuswa.\nPretoria is also served internally by metropolitan routes.\nAirports.\nFor scheduled air services, Pretoria is served by Johannesburg's airports: OR Tambo International, south of central Pretoria; and Lanseria, south-west of the city. Wonderboom Airport in the suburb of Annlin in the north of Pretoria primarily services light commercial and private aircraft. However, as from August 2015, scheduled flights from Wonderboom Airport to Cape Town International Airport were made available by SA Airlink. There are two military air bases to the south of the city, Swartkop and Waterkloof.\nCulture.\nMedia.\nSince Pretoria forms part the Tshwane Metropolitan Municipality, most radio, television and paper media is the same as the rest of the metro area.\nRadio.\nThere are many radio stations in the greater Pretoria region, some of note are:\nJacaranda FM, previously known as Jacaranda 94.2, is a commercial South African radio station, broadcasting in English and Afrikaans, with a footprint that covers Gauteng, Limpopo, Mpumalanga and the North West Province and boasts a listening audience of 3\u00a0million people a week, and a digital community of more than 1,6\u00a0million people a month.

It is a combination of Tswana and Northern Sotho (Pedi), with influences from Tsotsitaal and other black South African languages. It is a creole language that developed in the city during the years of Apartheid.\nMusic.\nA number of popular South African bands and musicians are originally from Pretoria. These include Desmond and the Tutus, Bittereinder, The Black Cat Bones, Seether, popular mostwako rapper JR, Joshua na die Re\u00ebn and DJ Mujava who was raised in the town of Attridgeville.\nThe song \"Marching to Pretoria\" refers to this city. Pretoria was the capital of the South African Republic (a.k.a. Republic of the Transvaal; 1852\u20131881 and 1884\u20131902) the principal battleground for the First and Second Boer War, the latter which brought both the Transvaal and the Orange Free State republic under British rule. \"Marching to Pretoria\" was one of the songs that British soldiers sang as they marched from the Cape Colony, under British Rule since 1814, to the capital of the Southern African Republic (or in Dutch, \"Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek\"). As the song's refrain puts it: \"We are marching to Pretoria, Pretoria, Pretoria/We are marching to Pretoria, Pretoria, Hurrah.\"\nThe opening line of John Lennon's Beatles' song I Am the Walrus, \"I am he as you are he as you are me and we are all together\", is often believed to be based on the lyric \"I'm with you and you're with me and so we are all together\" in \"Marching to Pretoria\". Lennon denied this, insisting his lyrics came from \"nothing\".\nHip-Hop.\nThe Hip-hop scene in Pretoria is recognised as one of South Africa's most distinctive, marked by its distinctive use of Spitori- a Lingua franca blending SeTswana, Sepedi, Isizulu, Afrikaans and other languages. The city has produced several influential artists, including Focalistic, 25K, Thato Saul and A-Reece.\nBacardi.\nBacardi is a style of music that originated in Pretoria. Early pioneers in the 2000s- including Elvis \"DJ Mujava\" Maswanganyi, Gift \"DJ Dadaman\" Mashaba, and Sammy \"DJ Pencil\" Moripe- helped define the sound with songs like \"Mugwanti, Ko Morago, and Miami\". Characterised by its raw, percussive beats, repetitive rhythms, and deep basslines. Bacardi became a defining soundtrack of township parties and carwash gatherings. The genre is closely tied to the Spitori culture and Pretoria street life. Contemporary artists who make music within the genre include Focalistic, Karabo \"Jelly Babie\" Khakhu, Mellow &amp; Sleazy, and DJ Maphorisa, many of whom blend Bacardi with Amapiano. Another distinctive feature of the genre are its dance moves, which are fast-paced, have intense footwork that match the beat. These have gained international exposure through artists such as Tyla who has included them in her performances\nAmapiano.\nAmapiano has strong roots in Pretoria, where its early producers and DJs experimented with Bacardi rhythms and deep house elements. Emerging in the mid-2010s, amapiano is a hybrid of kwaito, deep house, gqom, jazz, soul, and lounge music characterized by synths and wide, percussive basslines. Amapiano is further defined by its log drum, jazzy piano chords, and smooth tempo. Many of the genre's most influential artists and producers trace their roots to Pretoria. Kabza de Small whilst born in Mpumalanga, relocated to Pretoria and is widely regarged as a pioneer and one of the kings of Amapiano. Vigro Deep, from Atteridgeville in Pretoria, is another leading producer whose early works helped shape the sounds. DJ Maphorisa, one half of the Scorpion Kings duo with Kabza, hails from Soshanguve, Pretoria. Other influential artists include Focalistic and Pabi Cooper.\nPerforming arts and galleries.\nPretoria is home to an extensive portfolio of public art. A diverse and evolving city, Pretoria boasts a vibrant art scene and a variety of works that range from sculptures to murals to pieces by internationally and locally renowned artists. The Pretoria Art Museum is home to a vast collection of local artworks. After a bequest of 17th century Dutch artworks by Lady Michaelis in 1932 the art collection of Pretoria City Council expanded quickly to include South African works by Henk Pierneef, Pieter Wenning, Frans Oerder, Anton van Wouw and Irma Stern. And according to the museum: \"As South African museums in Cape Town and Johannesburg already had good collections of 17th, 18th and 19th century European art, it was decided to focus on compiling a representative collection of South African art\" making it somewhat unusual compared to its contemporaries.\nPretoria houses several performing arts venues including:\nthe South African State Theatre which houses the arts of Opera, musicals, plays and comedic performances.\nA statue of former president Nelson Mandela was unveiled in front of the Union Buildings on 16 December 2013.

Jewish citizens have been in Pretoria since its foundation in the 19th century and played an important role in its industrial and economic growth. A Mr. De Vries, the first Jewish inhabitant of Pretoria, was a prominent citizen and prosecutor, a member of the Volksraad and a pioneer of the Afrikaans language. Another famed Jewish Pretorian was Sammy Marks.\nOther early Jewish settlers, many of them immigrants from Lithuania, were not as educated as De Vries and often did not speak Dutch, Afrikaans, or English. Many of them spoke only Yiddish and made a living as shopkeepers in the local retail industry. Most Jewish residents stayed neutral in the Second Boer War, though some joined the South African Republic army.\nThe first congregation was founded between 1890 and 1895, and in 1898 the first synagogue, The Old Synagogue opened on Paul Kruger Street. A second synagogue, known as the Great Synagogue, opened in 1922. Both synagogues are no longer in operation, but a Reformed synagogue, Temple Menorah, opened in the early 1950s.\nThe Jewish community of Pretoria's golden age was in the early 20th century, when many Jewish sports clubs, charities, and youth groups flourished. After 1948, many Jews left for Cape Town or Johannesburg.\nThe Old Synagogue on Paul Kruger Street was purchased by the government in 1952 to become the new home of the High Court where prominent opposition figures in the Anti-Apartheid Movement were tried, including Nelson Mandela, Walter Sisulu, and 26 others were prosecuted for treason from 1 August 1958 to 29 March 1961; the Rivonia Trial was held there in 1963\u20131964.\nTwo Jewish schools arose in Pretoria, the Miriam Marks School, which was founded in 1905, and the Carmel School, which opened in 1959. Only the second, currently also operating as a synagogue, remains. Pretoria's Reformed congregation shares a rabbi with the Johannesburg one, though the synagogue no longer operates and services take place in worshippers' private homes.\nBuddhist community.\nA Buddhist centre, the Jang Chup Chopel Rigme Centre (\"Centre of Light\") was founded in early January 2015 by Duan Pienaar or Gyalten Nyima (his adopted monastic name) in Waverley around Pretoria-Moot. Pienaar is the only Afrikaner ordained in the highly selective Tibetan Tantric Buddhist community in Bylakuppe, in southern India. His instructor Lama Kyabje Choden Rinpoche is the highest tantric master after the Dalai Lama. Pienaar, who studied Buddhist teachers for twenty years, spent two years in India.\nCoat of arms.\nThe Pretoria civic arms, designed by Frans Engelenburg, were granted by the College of Arms on 7 February 1907. They were registered with the Transvaal Provincial Administration in March 1953 and at the Bureau of Heraldry in May 1968. The Bureau provided new artwork, in a more modern style, in 1989.\nThe arms were: \"Gules, on an mimosa tree eradicated proper within an orle of eight bees volant, Or, an inescutcheon Or and thereon a Roman praetor seated proper\". In layman's terms: a red shield displaying an uprooted mimosa tree surrounded by a border of eight golden bees, superimposed on the tree is a golden shield depicting a Roman praetor. The tree represented growth, the bees industry, and the praetor (judge) was an heraldic pun on the name.\nThe crest was a three-towered golden castle; the supporters were an eland and a kudu; and the motto \"Praestantia praevaleat Pretoria\".\nThe coat of arms have gone out of favour after the City Council amalgamated with its surrounding councils to form the City of Tshwane Metropolitan Municipality.\nEducation.\nSecondary education.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nTertiary education.\nPretoria is one of South Africa's leading academic cities and is home to both the largest residential university in South Africa, largest distance education university in South Africa and a research intensive university. The three Universities in the city in order of the year founded are as follows:\nUniversity of South Africa.\nThe University of South Africa (commonly referred to as Unisa), founded in 1873 as the University of the Cape of Good Hope, is the largest university on the African continent and attracts a third of all higher education students in South Africa. It spent most of its early history as an examining agency for Oxford and Cambridge universities and as an incubator from which most other universities in South Africa are descended. In 1946 it was given a new role as a distance education university and in 2012 it had a student headcount of over 300,000 students, including African and international students in 130 countries worldwide, making it one of the world's mega universities. Unisa is a dedicated open distance education institution and offers both vocational and academic programmes.\nUniversity of Pretoria.\nThe University of Pretoria (commonly referred to as UP, Tuks, or Tukkies) is a multi campus public research university. The university was established in 1908 as the Pretoria campus of the Johannesburg based Transvaal University College and is the fourth South African institution in continuous operation to be awarded university status. Established in 1920, the University of Pretoria Faculty of Veterinary Science is the second oldest veterinary school in Africa and the only veterinary school in South Africa. In 1949 the university launched the first MBA programme outside of North America. Since 1997, the university has produced more research outputs every year than any other institution of higher learning in South Africa, as measured by the Department of Education's accreditation benchmark.\nTshwane University of Technology.\nThe Tshwane University of Technology (commonly referred to as TUT) is a higher education institution, offering vocational oriented diplomas and degrees, and came into being through a merger of Technikon Northern Gauteng, Technikon North-West and Technikon Pretoria. TUT caters for approximately 60,000 students and it has become the largest residential higher education institution in South Africa.\nCSIR.\nThe Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) is South Africa's central scientific research and development organisation. It was established by an act of parliament in 1945 and is situated on its own campus in the city. It is the largest research and development organisation in Africa and accounts for about 10% of the entire African R&amp;D budget. It has a staff of approximately 3,000 technical and scientific researchers, often working in multi-disciplinary teams. In 2002, Sibusiso Sibisi was appointed as the president and CEO of the CSIR.\nMilitary.\nPretoria has earned a reputation as being the centre of South Africa's Military and is home to several military facilities of the South African National Defence Force:\nMilitary headquarters.\nTransito Air Force Headquarters.\nThis complex is the headquarters to the South African Air Force.\nThe Dequar Road Complex.\nA military complex that houses the following:\nThe Sebokeng Complex.\nA military complex located on the corner of Patriot Street and Koraalboom Road that houses the following military headquarters:\nMilitary bases.\nThe Dequar Road Base.\nThis base is situated in the suburb of Salvokop and is divided into two parts:\nThaba Tshwane.\nThaba Tshwane is a large military area south-west of the Pretoria Central Business District and North of Air Force Base Swartkop. It is the headquarters of several army units-\nThe military base also houses the 1 Military Hospital and the Military Police School. Within Thaba Tshwane, a facility known as \"TEK Base\" exists which houses its own units:\nJoint Support Base Wonderboom.\nThe Wonderboom Military Base is located adjacent to the Wonderboom Airport and is the headquarters of the South African Army Signals Formation. It also houses the School of Signals, 1 Signal Regiment, 2 Signal Regiment, 3 Electronic Workshop, 4 Signal Regiment and 5 Signal Regiment.\nMilitary colleges.\nThe South African Air Force College, the South African Military Health Service School for Military Health Training and the South African Army College are situated in the Thaba Tshwane Military Base and are used to train Commissioned and Non-commissioned Officers to perform effectively in combat/command roles in the various branches of the South African National Defence Force. The South African Defence Intelligence College is also located in the Sterrewag Suburb north of Air Force Base Waterkloof.\nAir force bases.\nWhile technically not within the city limits of Pretoria, Air Force Base Swartkop and Air Force Base Waterkloof are often used for defence related matters within the city. These may include aerial military transport duties within the city, aerospace monitoring and defence as well as VIP transport to and from the city.\nProposed change of name.\nOn 26 May 2005 the South African Geographical Names Council (SAGNC), which is linked to the Directorate of Heritage in the Department of Arts and Culture, approved changing the name of Pretoria to Tshwane, which is already the name of the Metropolitan Municipality in which Pretoria and a number of surrounding cities are located. Although the name change was approved by the SAGNC, it was not approved by the Minister of Arts and Culture, who at the time requested further research on the matter. Should the Minister approve the name change, the name will be published in the Government Gazette, giving the public opportunity to comment on the matter. The Minister can then refer that public response back to the SAGNC before presenting a recommendation before parliament for a vote. Various public interest groups warned that any name change would be challenged in court, should the minister approve it. The long process involved makes a name change less likely.\nThe Tshwane Metro Council has advertised \"Africa's leading capital city\" as \"Tshwane\" since the SAGNC decision in 2005. This has led to further controversy, however, as the name of the city had not yet been changed, and the council was, at best, acting prematurely. When a complaint was lodged with the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA), it ruled that such advertisements are deliberately misleading and should be withdrawn from all media. Despite the rulings of the ASA, Tshwane Metro Council failed to discontinue their \"City of Tshwane\" advertisements. As a result, the ASA requested that Tshwane Metro pay for advertisements in which it admits that it has misled the public. After refusing to abide by the ASA's request, the Metro Council was banned from placing any advertisements in the South African media that refer to the capital as Tshwane. ASA may still place additional sanctions on the Metro Council that would prevent it from placing any advertisements in the South African media, including council notices and employment vacancies.\nAfter the ruling, the Metro Council continued to place \"Tshwane\" advertisements, but placed them on council-owned advertising boards and busstops throughout the municipal area. In August 2007, an internal memo was leaked to the media in which the Tshwane mayor sought advice from the premier of Gauteng on whether the municipality could be called the \"City of Tshwane\" instead of just \"Tshwane\". This could increase confusion about the distinction between the city of Pretoria and the municipality of Tshwane.\nIn early 2010 it was again rumoured that the South African government would make a decision regarding the name; however, a media briefing regarding name changes, which could have been an opportunity to discuss it, was cancelled shortly before taking place. Rumours of the name change provoked outrage from Afrikaner civil rights and political groups. It later emerged that the registration of the municipality as a geographic place had been published in the Government Gazette as it had been too late to withdraw the name from the publication, but it was announced that the name had been withdrawn, pending \"further work\" by officials. The following week, the registration of \"Tshwane\" was officially withdrawn in the Government Gazette. The retraction had reportedly been ordered at the behest of the Deputy President of South Africa Kgalema Motlanthe, acting on behalf of President Jacob Zuma, as minister of Arts and Culture Lulu Xingwana had acted contrary to the position of the ANC, which is that Pretoria and the municipality are separate entities, which was subsequently articulated by ANC secretary general Gwede Mantashe.\nIn March 2010 a group supporting the name change, calling themselves the \"Tshwane Royal House Committee\", claimed to be descendants of Chief Tshwane and demanded to be made part of the administration of the municipality.\nAccording to comments made by Mayor Kgosientso Ramokgopa in late 2011, the change would occur in 2012. However, there remained considerable uncertainty about the issue.\nAs of 2025[ [update]], the proposed name change has not occurred and is unlikely to happen.\nInternational relations.\nTwin towns \u2013 sister cities.\nPretoria is twinned with:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotable people.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Psychiatrists are physicians who evaluate patients to determine whether their symptoms are the result of a physical illness, a combination of physical and mental ailments or strictly mental issues. Sometimes a psychiatrist works within a multi-disciplinary team, which may comprise clinical psychologists, social workers, occupational therapists, and nursing staff. Psychiatrists have broad training in a biopsychosocial approach to the assessment and management of mental illness.\nAs part of the clinical assessment process, psychiatrists may employ a mental status examination; a physical examination; brain imaging such as a computerized tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, or positron emission tomography scan; and blood testing. Psychiatrists use pharmacologic, psychotherapeutic, or interventional approaches to treat mental disorders.\nSubspecialties.\nThe field of psychiatry has many subspecialties that require additional (fellowship) training, which, in the US, are certified by the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology (ABPN) and require Maintenance of Certification Program to continue. These include the following: \nFurther, other specialties that exist include:\nThe United Council for Neurologic Subspecialties in the United States offers certification and fellowship program accreditation in the subspecialties of behavioral neurology and neuropsychiatry, which is open to both neurologists and psychiatrists.\nSome psychiatrists specialize in helping certain age groups. Pediatric psychiatry is the area of the profession working with children in addressing psychological problems. Psychiatrists specializing in geriatric psychiatry work with the elderly and are called geriatric psychiatrists or geropsychiatrists. Those who practice psychiatry in the workplace are called occupational psychiatrists in the United States and occupational psychology is the name used for the most similar discipline in the UK. Psychiatrists working in the courtroom and reporting to the judge and jury, in both criminal and civil court cases, are called forensic psychiatrists, who also treat mentally disordered offenders and other patients whose condition is such that they have to be treated in secure units.\nOther psychiatrists may also specialize in psychopharmacology, psychotherapy, psychiatric genetics, neuroimaging, dementia-related disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, sleep medicine, pain medicine, palliative medicine, eating disorders, sexual disorders, women's health, global mental health, early psychosis intervention, mood disorders and anxiety disorders such as obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder.\nPsychiatrists work in a wide variety of settings. Some are full-time medical researchers, many see patients in private medical practices, and consult liaison psychiatrists see patients in hospital settings where psychiatric and other medical conditions interact.\nAs a medical doctor (M.D. or D.O.), a psychiatrist specializes in diagnosing, treating, and preventing mental, emotional, and behavioral disorders, and is uniquely qualified to prescribe medications and order a full range of medical and laboratory tests to assess the physical aspects of psychological problems.\nProfessional requirements.\nWhile requirements to become a psychiatric physician differ from country to country, all require a medical degree.\nIndia.\nIn India, a Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS) degree is the basic qualification needed to do psychiatry. After completing an MBBS (including an internship), they can attend various PG medical entrance exams and get a Doctor of Medicine (M.D.) in psychiatry, which is a 3-year course. Diploma course in psychiatry or DNB psychiatry can also be taken to become a psychiatrist.\nNetherlands.\nIn the Netherlands, one must complete medical school after which one is certified as a medical doctor. After a strict selection program, one can specialize for 4.5-years in psychiatry. During this specialization, the resident has to do a 6-month residency in the field of social psychiatry, a 12-month residency in a field of their own choice (which can be child psychiatry, forensic psychiatry, somatic medicine, or medical research). To become an adolescent psychiatrist, one has to do an extra specialization period of 2 more years. In short, this means that it takes at least 10.5 years of study to become a psychiatrist which can go up to 12.5 years if one becomes a children's and adolescent psychiatrist.\nPakistan.\nIn Pakistan, one must complete basic medical education, an MBBS, then get registered with the Pakistan Medical and Dental Council (PMDC) as a general practitioner after a one-year mandatory internship, house job. After registration with PMDC, one has to take the FCPS-I exam. After that, they pursue four additional years of training in psychiatry at the College of Physicians and Surgeons Pakistan. Training includes rotations in general medicine, neurology, and clinical psychology for three months each, during the first two years. There is a mid-exam intermediate module and a final exam after four years.\nHong Kong.\nIn the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), psychiatrists are required to obtain a medical degree, followed by a minimum of six years of specialized training. Then, they must achieve fellowship at the Hong Kong College of Psychiatrists and attain the qualification of 'specialist in psychiatry' from the Medical Council. Certified psychiatrists are included in the registry.\nThe fees charged by specialist psychiatrists vary. In private clinics, the cost of a consultation starts from HK$1,500. Compared to private clinics, the fees for specialist outpatient services of the Hospital Authority are lower, but the waiting time can be as long as two years. For Eligible Persons, the first consultation fee is HK$135, and each subsequent consultation fee is HK$80. Additionally, the cost for each type of medication is HK$15.\nUnited Kingdom and Ireland.\nIn the United Kingdom, psychiatrists must hold a medical degree. Following this, the individual will work as a foundation house officer for two additional years in the UK, or one year as an intern in Ireland to achieve registration as a basic medical practitioner. Training in psychiatry can then begin and it is taken in two parts: three years of basic specialist training culminating in the MRCPsych exam, followed by three years of higher specialist training referred to as \"ST4-6\" in the UK and \"Senior Registrar Training\" in Ireland. Candidates with MRCPsych degree and complete basic training must reinterview for higher specialist training. At this stage, the development of special interests such as forensic or child/adolescent takes place. At the end of 3 years of higher specialist training, candidates are awarded a Certificate of Completion of (Specialist) Training (CC(S)T). At this stage, the psychiatrist can register as a specialist, and the qualification of CC(S)T is recognized in all EU/EEA states. As such, training in the UK and Ireland is considerably longer than in the US or Canada and frequently takes around 8\u20139 years following graduation from medical school. Those with a CC(S)T will be able to apply for consultant posts. Those with training from outside the EU/EEA should consult local/native medical boards to review their qualifications and eligibility for equivalence recognition (for example, those with a US residency and ABPN qualification).\nUnited States and Canada.\nIn the United States and Canada, one must first attain the degree of M.D. or Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine, followed by practice as a psychiatric resident for another four years (five years in Canada). This extended period involves comprehensive training in psychiatric diagnosis, psychopharmacology, medical care issues, and psychotherapies. All accredited psychiatry residencies in the United States require proficiency in cognitive behavioral, brief, psychodynamic, and supportive psychotherapies. Psychiatry residents are required to complete at least four post-graduate months of internal medicine or pediatrics, plus a minimum of two months of neurology during their first year of residency, referred to as an \"internship\". After completing their training, psychiatrists are eligible to take a specialty board examination to become board-certified. The total amount of time required to complete educational and training requirements in the field of psychiatry in the United States is twelve years after high school. Subspecialists in child and adolescent psychiatry are required to complete a two-year fellowship program, the first year of which can run concurrently with the fourth year of the general psychiatry residency program. This adds one to two years of training. The average compensation for psychiatrists in the U.S. in 2023 was $309,000.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;*List of psychiatrists\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "25005", "revid": "50776455", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25005", "title": "Peano axioms", "text": "Axioms for the natural numbers\nIn mathematical logic, the Peano axioms (, ), also known as the Dedekind\u2013Peano axioms or the Peano postulates, are axioms for the natural numbers presented by the 19th-century Italian mathematician Giuseppe Peano. These axioms have been used nearly unchanged in a number of metamathematical investigations, including research into fundamental questions of whether number theory is consistent and complete.\nThe axiomatization of arithmetic provided by Peano axioms is commonly called Peano arithmetic.\nThe importance of formalizing arithmetic was not well appreciated until the work of Hermann Grassmann, who showed in the 1860s that many facts in arithmetic could be derived from more basic facts about the successor operation and induction. In 1881, Charles Sanders Peirce provided an axiomatization of natural-number arithmetic. In 1888, Richard Dedekind proposed another axiomatization of natural-number arithmetic, and in\u00a01889, Peano published a simplified version of them as a collection of axioms in his book \"The principles of arithmetic presented by a new method\" ().\nPeano\u2019s axioms can be divided into groups according to their subject matter. The first axiom asserts the existence of at least one member of the set of natural numbers. The next four are general statements about equality; in modern treatments these are often not taken as part of the Peano axioms, but rather as axioms of the \"underlying logic\". The next three axioms are first-order statements about natural numbers expressing the fundamental properties of the successor operation. The ninth, final, axiom is a second-order statement of the principle of mathematical induction over the natural numbers, which makes this formulation close to second-order arithmetic. A weaker first-order system is obtained by explicitly adding the addition and multiplication operation symbols and replacing the second-order induction axiom with a first-order axiom schema. The term \"Peano arithmetic\" is sometimes used for specifically naming this restricted system.\nHistorical second-order formulation.\nWhen Peano formulated his axioms, the language of mathematical logic was in its infancy. The system of logical notation he created to present the axioms did not prove to be popular, although it was the genesis of the modern notation for set membership (\u2208, which comes from Peano's \u03b5). Peano maintained a clear distinction between mathematical and logical symbols, which was not yet common in mathematics; such a separation had first been introduced in the \"Begriffsschrift\" by Gottlob Frege, published in 1879. Peano was unaware of Frege's work and independently recreated his logical apparatus based on the work of Boole and Schr\u00f6der.\nThe Peano axioms define the arithmetical properties of \"natural numbers\", usually represented as a set N or formula_1 The non-logical symbols for the axioms consist of a constant symbol 0 and a unary function symbol \"S\".\nThe first axiom states that the constant 0 is a natural number:\nPeano's original formulation of the axioms used 1 instead of 0 as the \"first\" natural number, while the axioms in \"Formulario mathematico\" include zero.\nThe next four axioms describe the equality relation. Since they are logically valid in first-order logic with equality, they are not considered to be part of \"the Peano axioms\" in modern treatments.\nThe remaining axioms define the arithmetical properties of the natural numbers. The naturals are assumed to be closed under a single-valued \"successor\" function \"S\".\nAxioms 1, 6, 7, 8 define a unary representation of the intuitive notion of natural numbers: the number 1 can be defined as \"S\"(0), 2 as \"S\"(\"S\"(0)), etc. However, considering the notion of natural numbers as being defined by these axioms, axioms 1, 6, 7, 8 do not imply that the successor function generates all the natural numbers different from 0.\nThe intuitive notion that each natural number can be obtained by applying \"successor\" sufficiently many times to zero requires an additional axiom, which is sometimes called the \"axiom of induction\".\nThe induction axiom is sometimes stated in the following form:\nIn Peano's original formulation, the induction axiom is a second-order axiom. It is now common to replace this second-order principle with a weaker first-order induction scheme. There are important differences between the second-order and first-order formulations, as discussed in the section below.\nDefining arithmetic operations and relations.\nIf we use the second-order induction axiom, it is possible to define addition, multiplication, and total (linear) ordering on N directly using the axioms. However, and addition and multiplication are often added as axioms. The respective functions and relations are constructed in set theory or second-order logic, and can be shown to be unique using the Peano axioms.\nAddition.\nAddition is a function that maps two natural numbers (two elements of N) to another one. It is defined recursively as:\n formula_2\nFor example:\n formula_3\nTo prove commutativity of addition, first prove formula_4 and formula_5, each by induction on formula_6. Using both results, then prove formula_7 by induction on formula_6.\nThe structure (N, +) is a commutative monoid with identity element 0. (N, +) is also a cancellative magma, and thus embeddable in a group. The smallest group embedding N is the integers.\nMultiplication.\nSimilarly, multiplication is a function mapping two natural numbers to another one. Given addition, it is defined recursively as:\n formula_9\nIt is easy to see that formula_10 is the multiplicative right identity:\nformula_11\nTo show that formula_10 is also the multiplicative left identity requires the induction axiom due to the way multiplication is defined:\nTherefore, by the induction axiom formula_10 is the multiplicative left identity of all natural numbers. Moreover, it can be shown that multiplication is commutative and distributes over addition:\n formula_22.\nThus, formula_23 is a commutative semiring.\nInequalities.\nThe usual total order relation \u2264 on natural numbers can be defined as follows, assuming 0 is a natural number:\n For all \"a\", \"b\" \u2208 N, \"a\" \u2264 \"b\" if and only if there exists some \"c\" \u2208 N such that \"a\" + \"c\" = \"b\".\nThis relation is stable under addition and multiplication: for formula_24, if \"a\" \u2264 \"b\", then:\nThus, the structure (N, +, \u00b7, 1, 0, \u2264) is an ordered semiring; because there is no natural number between 0 and 1, it is a discrete ordered semiring.\nThe axiom of induction is sometimes stated in the following form that uses a stronger hypothesis, making use of the order relation \"\u2264\":\n For any predicate \"\u03c6\", if\n* \"\u03c6\"(0) is true, and\n* for every \"n\" \u2208 N, if \"\u03c6\"(\"k\") is true for every \"k\" \u2208 N such that \"k\" \u2264 \"n\", then \"\u03c6\"(\"S\"(\"n\")) is true,\n* then for every \"n\" \u2208 N, \"\u03c6\"(\"n\") is true.\nThis form of the induction axiom, called \"strong induction\", is a consequence of the standard formulation, but is often better suited for reasoning about the \u2264 order. For example, to show that the naturals are well-ordered\u2014every nonempty subset of N has a least element\u2014one can reason as follows. Let a nonempty \"X\" \u2286 N be given and assume \"X\" has no least element.\nThus, by the strong induction principle, for every \"n\" \u2208 N, \"n\" \u2209 \"X\". Thus, \"X\" \u2229 N = \u2205, which contradicts \"X\" being a nonempty subset of N. Thus \"X\" has a least element.\nModels.\nA model of the Peano axioms is a triple (N, 0, \"S\"), where N is a (necessarily infinite) set, 0 \u2208 N and \"S\": N \u2192 N satisfies the axioms above. Dedekind proved in his 1888 book, \"The Nature and Meaning of Numbers\" (, i.e., \"What are the numbers and what are they good for?\") that any two models of the Peano axioms (including the second-order induction axiom) are isomorphic. In particular, given two models (N\"A\", 0\"A\", \"S\"\"A\") and (N\"B\", 0\"B\", \"S\"\"B\") of the Peano axioms, there is a unique homomorphism \"f\" : N\"A\" \u2192 N\"B\" satisfying\n formula_25\nand it is a bijection. This means that the second-order Peano axioms are categorical. (This is not the case with any first-order reformulation of the Peano axioms, below.)\nSet-theoretic models.\nThe Peano axioms can be derived from set theoretic constructions of the natural numbers and axioms of set theory such as ZF. The standard construction of the naturals, due to John von Neumann, starts from a definition of 0 as the empty set, \u2205, and an operator \"s\" on sets defined as:\n formula_26\nThe set of natural numbers N is defined as the intersection of all sets closed under \"s\" that contain the empty set. Each natural number is equal (as a set) to the set of natural numbers less than it:\n formula_27\nand so on. The set N together with 0 and the successor function \"s\" : N \u2192 N satisfies the Peano axioms.\nPeano arithmetic is equiconsistent with several weak systems of set theory. One such system is ZFC with the axiom of infinity replaced by its negation. Another such system consists of general set theory (extensionality, existence of the empty set, and the axiom of adjunction), augmented by an axiom schema stating that a property that holds for the empty set and holds of an adjunction whenever it holds of the adjunct must hold for all sets.\nInterpretation in category theory.\nThe Peano axioms can also be understood using category theory. Let \"C\" be a category with terminal object 1\"C\", and define the category of pointed unary systems, US1(\"C\") as follows:\nThen \"C\" is said to satisfy the Dedekind\u2013Peano axioms if US1(\"C\") has an initial object; this initial object is known as a natural number object in \"C\". If (N, 0, \"S\") is this initial object, and (\"X\", 0\"X\", \"S\"\"X\") is any other object, then the unique map \"u\" : (N, 0, \"S\") \u2192 (\"X\", 0\"X\", \"S\"\"X\") is such that\n formula_28\nThis is precisely the recursive definition of 0\"X\" and \"S\"\"X\".\nConsistency.\nWhen the Peano axioms were first proposed, Bertrand Russell and others agreed that these axioms implicitly defined what we mean by a \"natural number\". Henri Poincar\u00e9 was more cautious, saying they only defined natural numbers if they were \"consistent\"; if there is a proof that starts from just these axioms and derives a contradiction such as 0 = 1, then the axioms are inconsistent, and don't define anything. In 1900, David Hilbert posed the problem of proving their consistency using only finitistic methods as the second of his twenty-three problems. In 1931, Kurt G\u00f6del proved his second incompleteness theorem, which shows that such a consistency proof cannot be formalized within Peano arithmetic itself, if Peano arithmetic is consistent.\nAlthough it is widely claimed that G\u00f6del's theorem rules out the possibility of a finitistic consistency proof for Peano arithmetic, this depends on exactly what one means by a finitistic proof. G\u00f6del himself pointed out the possibility of giving a finitistic consistency proof of Peano arithmetic or stronger systems by using finitistic methods that are not formalizable in Peano arithmetic, and in 1958, G\u00f6del published a method for proving the consistency of arithmetic using type theory. In 1936, Gerhard Gentzen gave a proof of the consistency of Peano's axioms, using transfinite induction up to an ordinal called \u03b50. Gentzen explained: \"The aim of the present paper is to prove the consistency of elementary number theory or, rather, to reduce the question of consistency to certain fundamental principles\". Gentzen's proof is arguably finitistic, since the transfinite ordinal \u03b50 can be encoded in terms of finite objects (for example, as a Turing machine describing a suitable order on the integers, or more abstractly as consisting of the finite trees, suitably linearly ordered). Whether or not Gentzen's proof meets the requirements Hilbert envisioned is unclear: there is no generally accepted definition of exactly what is meant by a finitistic proof, and Hilbert himself never gave a precise definition.\nThe vast majority of contemporary mathematicians believe that Peano's axioms are consistent, relying either on intuition or the acceptance of a consistency proof such as Gentzen's proof. A small number of philosophers and mathematicians, some of whom also advocate ultrafinitism, reject Peano's axioms because accepting the axioms amounts to accepting the infinite collection of natural numbers. In particular, addition (including the successor function) and multiplication are assumed to be total. Curiously, there are self-verifying theories that are similar to PA but have subtraction and division instead of addition and multiplication, which are axiomatized in such a way to avoid proving sentences that correspond to the totality of addition and multiplication, but which are still able to prove all true formula_29 theorems of PA, and yet can be extended to a consistent theory that proves its own consistency (stated as the non-existence of a Hilbert-style proof of \"0=1\").\nPeano arithmetic as first-order theory.\nAll of the Peano axioms except the ninth axiom (the induction axiom) are statements in first-order logic. The arithmetical operations of addition and multiplication and the order relation can also be defined using first-order axioms. The axiom of induction above is second-order, since it quantifies over predicates (equivalently, sets of natural numbers rather than natural numbers). As an alternative one can consider a first-order \"axiom schema\" of induction. Such a schema includes one axiom per predicate definable in the first-order language of Peano arithmetic, making it weaker than the second-order axiom. The reason that it is weaker is that the number of predicates in first-order language is countable, whereas the number of sets of natural numbers is uncountable. Thus, there exist sets that cannot be described in first-order language (in fact, most sets have this property).\nFirst-order axiomatizations of Peano arithmetic have another technical limitation. In second-order logic, it is possible to define the addition and multiplication operations from the successor operation, but this cannot be done in the more restrictive setting of first-order logic. Therefore, the addition and multiplication operations are directly included in the signature of Peano arithmetic, and axioms are included that relate the three operations to each other.\nThe following list of axioms (along with the usual axioms of equality), which contains six of the seven axioms of Robinson arithmetic, is sufficient for this purpose:\nIn addition to this list of numerical axioms, Peano arithmetic contains the induction schema, which consists of a recursively enumerable and even decidable set of axioms. For each formula \"\u03c6\"(\"x\", \"y\"1, ..., \"y\"\"k\") in the language of Peano arithmetic, the first-order induction axiom for \"\u03c6\" is the sentence\nformula_36\nwhere formula_37 is an abbreviation for \"y\"1...,\"y\"\"k\". The first-order induction schema includes every instance of the first-order induction axiom; that is, it includes the induction axiom for every formula \"\u03c6\".\nEquivalent axiomatizations.\nThe above axiomatization of Peano arithmetic uses a signature that only has symbols for zero as well as the successor, addition, and multiplications operations. There are many other different, but equivalent, axiomatizations. One such alternative uses an order relation symbol instead of the successor operation and the language of discretely ordered semirings (axioms 1-7 for semirings, 8-10 on order, 11-13 regarding compatibility, and 14-15 for discreteness):\nThe theory defined by these axioms is known as PA\u2212. It is also incomplete and one of its important properties is that any structure formula_53 satisfying this theory has an initial segment (ordered by formula_54) isomorphic to formula_55. Elements in that segment are called standard elements, while other elements are called nonstandard elements. \nFinally, Peano arithmetic PA is obtained by adding the first-order induction schema.\nUndecidability and incompleteness.\nAccording to G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorems, the theory of PA (if consistent) is incomplete. Consequently, there are sentences of first-order logic (FOL) that are true in the standard model of PA but are not a consequence of the FOL axiomatization. Essential incompleteness already arises for theories with weaker axioms, such as Robinson arithmetic. \nClosely related to the above incompleteness result (via G\u00f6del's completeness theorem for FOL) it follows that there is no algorithm for deciding whether a given FOL sentence is a consequence of a first-order axiomatization of Peano arithmetic or not. Hence, PA is an example of an undecidable theory. Undecidability arises already for the existential sentences of PA, due to the negative answer to Hilbert's tenth problem, whose proof implies that all computably enumerable sets are diophantine sets, and thus definable by existentially quantified formulas (with free variables) of PA. Formulas of PA with higher quantifier rank (more quantifier alternations) than existential formulas are more expressive, and define sets in the higher levels of the arithmetical hierarchy.\nNonstandard models.\nAlthough the usual natural numbers satisfy the axioms of PA, there are other models as well (called \"non-standard models\"); the compactness theorem implies that the existence of nonstandard elements cannot be excluded in first-order logic. The upward L\u00f6wenheim\u2013Skolem theorem shows that there are nonstandard models of PA of all infinite cardinalities. This is not the case for the original (second-order) Peano axioms, which have only one model, up to isomorphism. This illustrates one way the first-order system PA is weaker than the second-order Peano axioms.\nWhen interpreted as a proof within a first-order set theory, such as ZFC, Dedekind's categoricity proof for PA shows that each model of set theory has a unique model of the Peano axioms, up to isomorphism, that embeds as an initial segment of all other models of PA contained within that model of set theory. In the standard model of set theory, this smallest model of PA is the standard model of PA; however, in a nonstandard model of set theory, it may be a nonstandard model of PA. This situation cannot be avoided with any first-order formalization of set theory.\nIt is natural to ask whether a countable nonstandard model can be explicitly constructed. The answer is affirmative as Skolem in 1933 provided an explicit construction of such a nonstandard model. On the other hand, Tennenbaum's theorem, proved in 1959, shows that there is no countable nonstandard model of PA in which either the addition or multiplication operation is computable. This result shows it is difficult to be completely explicit in describing the addition and multiplication operations of a countable nonstandard model of PA. There is only one possible order type of a countable nonstandard model. Letting \"\u03c9\" be the order type of the natural numbers, \"\u03b6\" be the order type of the integers, and \"\u03b7\" be the order type of the rationals, the order type of any countable nonstandard model of PA is \"\u03c9\" + \"\u03b6\"\u00b7\"\u03b7\", which can be visualized as a copy of the natural numbers followed by a dense linear ordering of copies of the integers.\nOverspill.\nA cut in a nonstandard model \"M\" is a nonempty subset \"C\" of \"M\" so that \"C\" is downward closed (\"x\" &lt; \"y\" and \"y\" \u2208 \"C\" \u21d2 \"x\" \u2208 \"C\") and \"C\" is closed under successor. A proper cut is a cut that is a proper subset of \"M\". Each nonstandard model has many proper cuts, including one that corresponds to the standard natural numbers. However, the induction scheme in Peano arithmetic prevents any proper cut from being definable. The overspill lemma, first proved by Abraham Robinson, formalizes this fact.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Math_theorem/styles.css\" /&gt;\nOverspill lemma\u2014Let \"M\" be a nonstandard model of PA and let \"C\" be a proper cut of \"M\".

It has the Bayer designation \u03b1 Canis Minoris, which is Latinized to Alpha Canis Minoris, and abbreviated \u03b1 CMi or Alpha CMi, respectively. As determined by the European Space Agency \"Hipparcos\" astrometry satellite, this system lies at a distance of just , and is therefore one of Earth's nearest stellar neighbors.\nA binary star system, Procyon consists of a white-hued main-sequence star of spectral type F5\u00a0IV\u2013V, designated component A, in orbit with a faint white dwarf companion of spectral type DQZ, named Procyon B. The pair orbit each other with a period of 40.84\u00a0years and an eccentricity of 0.4.\nObservation.\nProcyon is usually the eighth-brightest star in the night sky, culminating at midnight on 14 January. It forms one of the three vertices of the Winter Triangle asterism, in combination with Sirius and Betelgeuse. The prime period for evening viewing of Procyon is in late winter in the Northern Hemisphere.\nIt has a color index of 0.42, and its hue has been described as having a faint yellow tinge to it.\nStellar system.\nProcyon is a binary star system with a bright primary component, Procyon A, having an apparent magnitude of 0.34, and a faint companion, Procyon B, at magnitude 10.7. The pair orbit each other with a period of 40.84\u00a0years along an elliptical orbit with an eccentricity of 0.4, more eccentric than Mercury's. The plane of their orbit is inclined at an angle of 31.1\u00b0 to the line of sight with the Earth. The average separation of the two components is , a little less than the distance between Uranus and the Sun, though the eccentric orbit carries them as close as 8.9\u00a0AU and as far as 21.0\u00a0AU.\nProcyon A.\nThe primary has a stellar classification of F5IV\u2013V, indicating that it is a late-stage F-type main-sequence star. Procyon A is bright for its spectral class, suggesting that it is evolving into a subgiant that has nearly fused its hydrogen core into helium, after which it will expand as the nuclear reactions move outside the core. As it continues to expand, the star will eventually swell to about 80 to 150 times its current diameter and become a red or orange color. This will probably happen within 10 to 100 million years.\nThe effective temperature of the stellar atmosphere is an estimated , giving Procyon A a white hue. It is 1.5 times the solar mass (M\u2609), twice the solar radius (R\u2609), and has seven times the Sun's luminosity (L\u2609). Both the core and the envelope of this star are convective; the two regions being separated by a wide radiation zone.\nOscillations.\nIn late June 2004, Canada's orbital MOST satellite telescope carried out a 32-day survey of Procyon\u00a0A. The continuous optical monitoring was intended to confirm solar-like oscillations in its brightness observed from Earth and to permit asteroseismology. No oscillations were detected and the authors concluded that the theory of stellar oscillations may need to be reconsidered. However, others argued that the non-detection was consistent with published ground-based radial velocity observations of solar-like oscillations. Subsequent observations in radial velocity have confirmed that Procyon is indeed oscillating.\nPhotometric measurements from the NASA Wide Field Infrared Explorer (WIRE) satellite from 1999 and 2000 showed evidence of granulation (convection near the surface of the star) and solar-like oscillations. Unlike the MOST result, the variation seen in the WIRE photometry was in agreement with radial velocity measurements from the ground. Additional observations with MOST taken in 2007 were able to detect oscillations.\nProcyon B.\nLike Sirius B, Procyon B is a white dwarf that was inferred from astrometric data long before it was observed. Its existence had been postulated by German astronomer Friedrich Bessel as early as 1844, and, although its orbital elements had been calculated by his countryman Arthur Auwers in 1862 as part of his thesis, Procyon\u00a0B was not visually confirmed until 1896 when John Martin Schaeberle observed it at the predicted position using the 36-inch refractor at Lick Observatory. It is more difficult to observe from Earth than Sirius\u00a0B, due to a greater apparent magnitude difference and smaller angular separation from its primary.\nAt 0.6\u00a0M\u2609, Procyon\u00a0B is considerably less massive than Sirius\u00a0B; however, the peculiarities of degenerate matter ensure that it is larger than its more famous neighbor, with an estimated radius of 8,600\u00a0km, versus 5,800\u00a0km for Sirius\u00a0B. The radius agrees with white dwarf models that assume a carbon core. It has a stellar classification of DQZ, having a helium-dominated atmosphere with traces of heavy elements. For reasons that remain unclear, the mass of Procyon\u00a0B is unusually low for a white dwarf star of its type. With a surface temperature of , it is also much cooler than Sirius\u00a0B; this is a testament to its lesser mass and greater age. The mass of the progenitor star for Procyon B was about and it came to the end of its life some \u00a0billion years ago, after a main-sequence lifetime of \u00a0million years.\nX-ray emission.\nAttempts to detect X-ray emission from Procyon with nonimaging, soft X-ray-sensitive detectors prior to 1975 failed. Extensive observations of Procyon were carried out with the \"Copernicus\" and TD-1A satellites in the late 1970s. The X-ray source associated with Procyon AB was observed on 1\u00a0April 1979, with the Einstein Observatory high-resolution imager (HRI). The HRI X-ray pointlike source location is ~4\u2033 south of Procyon A, on the edge of the 90% confidence error circle, indicating identification with Procyon A rather than Procyon B which was located about 5\u2033 north of Procyon\u00a0A (about 9\u2033 from the X-ray source location).\nEtymology and cultural significance.\n\"\u03b1 Canis Minoris\" (Latinized to \"Alpha Canis Minoris\") is the star's Bayer designation.\nThe name \"Procyon\" comes from the Ancient Greek (\"\"), meaning \"before the dog\", since it precedes the \"Dog Star\" Sirius as it travels across the sky due to Earth's rotation. (Although Procyon has a greater right ascension, it also has a more northerly declination, which means it will rise above the horizon earlier than Sirius from most northerly latitudes.) In Greek mythology, Procyon is associated with Maera, a hound belonging to Erigone, daughter of Icarius of Athens. In 2016, the International Astronomical Union organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalog and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN's first bulletin of July 2016 included a table of the first two batches of names approved by the WGSN; which included \"Procyon\" for the star \u03b1 Canis Minoris A.\nThe two dog stars are referred to in the most ancient literature and were venerated by the Babylonians and the Egyptians, In Babylonian mythology, Procyon was known as Nangar (the Carpenter), an aspect of Marduk, involved in constructing and organizing the celestial sky.\nThe constellations in Macedonian folklore represented agricultural items and animals, reflecting their village way of life. To them, Procyon and Sirius were \"Volci\" \"the wolves\", circling hungrily around Orion which depicted a plough with oxen.\nRarer names are the Latin translation of Procyon, \"Antecanis\", and the Arabic-derived names \"Al\u00a0Shira\" and \"Elgomaisa\". Medieval astrolabes of England and Western Europe used a variant of this, \"Algomeiza/Algomeyza\". \"Al\u00a0Shira\" derives from ', \"the Syrian sign\" (the other sign being Sirius; \"Syria\" is supposedly a reference to its northern location relative to Sirius); \"Elgomaisa\" derives from ' \"the bleary-eyed (woman)\", in contrast to \"the teary-eyed (woman)\", which is Sirius. (See Gomeisa.)\nIn Chinese, (), meaning \"South River\", refers to an asterism consisting of Procyon, \u03b5 Canis Minoris and \u03b2 Canis Minoris. Consequently, Procyon itself is known as (, \"the Third Star of South River\"). It is part of the Vermilion Bird.\nThe Hawaiians see Procyon as part of an asterism \"Ke ka o Makali'i\" (\"the canoe bailer of Makali'i\") that helps them navigate at sea. In Hawaiian language, this star is called \"Puana\" (\"blossom\"), which is a new Hawaiian name based on the M\u0101ori name \"Puangahori\". It forms this asterism \"(Ke ka o Makali'i)\" with the Pleiades (Makali'i), Auriga, Orion, Capella, Sirius, Castor and Pollux. In Tahitian lore, Procyon was one of the pillars propping up the sky, known as \"An\u00e2-tahu'a-vahine-o-toa-te-manava\" (\"star-the-priestess-of-brave-heart\"), the pillar for elocution. M\u0101ori astronomers know the star as \"Puangahori\" (\"False Puanga\") which distinguishes it from its pair \"Puanga\" or \"Puanga-rua\" (\"Blossom-cluster\") which refers to a star of great importance to M\u0101ori culture and calendar, known by its western name Rigel.\nProcyon appears on the flag of Brazil, symbolizing the state of Amazonas.\nThe Kalapalo people of Mato Grosso state in Brazil call Procyon and Canopus \"Kofongo\" (\"Duck\"), with Castor and Pollux representing his hands. The asterism's appearance signified the coming of the rainy season and increase in food staple manioc, used at feasts to feed guests.\nKnown as \"Sikuliarsiujuittuq\" to the Inuit, Procyon was quite significant in their astronomy and mythology. Its eponymous name means \"the one who never goes onto the newly formed sea ice\", and refers to a man who stole food from his village's hunters because he was too obese to hunt on ice. He was killed by the other hunters who convinced him to go on the sea ice. Procyon received this designation because it typically appears red (though sometimes slightly greenish) as it rises during the Arctic winter; this red color was associated with Sikuliarsiujuittuq's bloody end.\nView from this system.\nWere the Sun to be observed from this star system, it would appear to be a magnitude 2.55 star in the constellation Aquila with the exact opposite coordinates at right ascension 19h 39m 18.11950s, declination \u00b0\u00a013\u2032\u00a029.9552\u2033. It would be as bright as \u03b2 Scorpii is in our sky.\nProcyon's closest neighboring star is Luyten's Star, about away. Procyon would be the brightest star in the night sky of an exoplanet orbiting Luyten's Star, with an apparent magnitude of -4.68. Luyten's Star would also be visible from Procyon, at an apparent magnitude of 4.61, unlike any red dwarfs from Earth with a possible exception of Lacaille 8760.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The earliest recorded usage of the phrase \"prisoner of war\" dates back to 1610. \nBelligerents hold prisoners of war for a range of reasons. These may include isolating them from enemy combatants still in the field (releasing and repatriating them in an orderly manner after hostilities), demonstrating military victory, punishment, prosecution of war crimes, labour exploitation, recruiting or even conscripting them as combatants, extracting or collecting military and political intelligence, and political or religious indoctrination.\nAncient times.\nFor much of history, prisoners of war would often be slaughtered or enslaved. Early Roman gladiators could be prisoners of war, categorised according to their ethnic roots as Samnites, Thracians, and Gauls (\"Galli\"). Homer's \"Iliad\" describes Trojan and Greek soldiers offering rewards of wealth to opposing forces who have defeated them on the battlefield in exchange for mercy, but such offers were not always accepted.\nTypically, victors made little distinction between enemy combatants and enemy civilians, although they were more likely to spare women and children. Sometimes the purpose of a battle, if not of a war, was to capture women, a practice known as \"raptio\"; the Rape of the Sabines involved, according to tradition, a large mass-abduction by the founders of Rome. Typically women had no rights, and were held legally as chattels.\nIn the fourth century AD, St Acacius of Amida, touched by the plight of Persian prisoners captured in a recent war with the Roman Empire, who were held in his town under appalling conditions and destined for a life of slavery, took the initiative in ransoming them by selling his church's precious gold and silver vessels and letting them return to their country. For this he was later canonised.\nMiddle Ages and Renaissance.\nAccording to legend, during Childeric's siege and blockade of Paris in 464 the nun Genevi\u00e8ve (later canonised as the city's patron saint) pleaded with the Frankish king for the welfare of prisoners of war and met with a favourable response. Later, Clovis I (r.\u2009481\u00a0\u2013\u00a0511) liberated captives after Genevieve urged him to do so.\nKing Henry V's English army killed many French prisoners of war at the Battle of Agincourt in 1415. This was done after a French raiding party returned to the main army after looting the English camp, Henry misinterpreted this as the French receiving reinforcements, and was afraid that the prisoners who would rejoin the fight against the English.\nIn the later Middle Ages a number of religious wars aimed to not only defeat but also to eliminate enemies. Authorities in Christian Europe often considered the extermination of heretics and heathens desirable. Examples of such wars include the 13th-century Albigensian Crusade in Languedoc and the Northern Crusades in the Baltic region. When asked by a crusader how to distinguish between the Catholics and Cathars following the projected capture (1209) of the city of B\u00e9ziers, the papal legate Arnaud Amalric allegedly replied, \"Kill them all, God will know His own.\"\nLikewise, the inhabitants of conquered cities were frequently massacred during crusades in the 11th and 12th centuries. Noblemen could hope to be ransomed; their families would have to send to their captors large sums of wealth commensurate with the social status of the captive.\nFeudal Japan had no custom of ransoming prisoners of war, who could expect for the most part summary execution.\nIn the 13th century the expanding Mongol Empire famously distinguished between cities or towns that surrendered (where the population was spared but required to support the conquering Mongol army) and those that resisted (in which case the city was ransacked and destroyed, and all the population killed). In Termez, on the Oxus: \"all the people, both men and women, were driven out onto the plain, and divided in accordance with their usual custom, then they were all slain.\"\nThe Aztecs warred constantly with neighbouring tribes and groups, aiming to collect live prisoners for sacrifice. For the re-consecration of Great Pyramid of Tenochtitlan in 1487, \"between 10,000 and 80,400 persons\" were sacrificed.\nDuring the early Muslim conquests of 622\u2013750, Muslims routinely captured large numbers of prisoners. Aside from those who converted, most were ransomed or enslaved. Christians captured during the Crusades were usually either killed or sold into slavery if they could not pay a ransom. During his lifetime (c.\u2009570 \u2013 632), Muhammad made it the responsibility of the Islamic government to provide food and clothing, on a reasonable basis, to captives, regardless of their religion; however, if the prisoners were in the custody of a person, then the responsibility was on the individual. On certain occasions where Muhammad felt the enemy had broken a treaty with the Muslims he endorsed the mass execution of male prisoners who participated in battles, as in the case of the Banu Qurayza in 627. The Muslims divided up the females and children of those executed as \"ghanima\" (spoils of war).\nNaval forces from both Christian and Muslim countries often turned prisoners of war into galley slaves. Thus, at the Battle of Lepanto in 1571, 12,000 Christian galley slaves were freed from the Ottoman Turks.\nModern times.\nIn Europe the treatment of prisoners of war became increasingly centralised, in the time period between the 16th and late 18th century. Whereas prisoners of war had previously been regarded as the private property of the captor, captured enemy soldiers were increasingly regarded as state property. The European states strove to exert increasing control over all stages of captivity, from the question of who would be attributed the status of prisoner of war to their eventual release. The act of surrender was regulated so that it, ideally, should be legitimised by officers, who negotiated the surrender of their whole unit. Soldiers whose style of fighting did not conform to the battle line tactics of regular European armies, such as Cossacks and Croats, were often denied the status of prisoners of war.\nIn line with this development the treatment of prisoners of war was increasingly regulated by international treaties, particularly the so-called cartel system, which regulated how warring states would exchange prisoners. The 1648 Peace of Westphalia, which ended the Thirty Years' War, established the rule that prisoners of war should be released and allowed to return to their homelands without ransom after hostilities ended.\nThere also evolved the right of \"parole\", French for \"discourse\", in which a captured officer surrendered his sword and gave his word as a gentleman in exchange for privileges. If he swore not to escape, he could gain better accommodations and the freedom of the prison. If he swore to cease hostilities against the nation that held him captive, he could be repatriated or exchanged but could not serve against his former captors in a military capacity.\nEuropean settlers captured in North America.\nEarly historical narratives of captured European settlers and the perspectives of literate women captured by the indigenous peoples of North America, exist. The writings of Mary Rowlandson, captured in 1676 in the chaotic fighting of King Philip's War, provide an early example. Such narratives enjoyed some popularity, spawning a genre of the captivity narrative, and had lasting influence on the body of early American literature, most notably through the legacy of James Fenimore Cooper's \"The Last of the Mohicans\" (1826). Some Native Americans continued to capture Europeans and use them both as labourers and as bargaining chips into the 19th century; see for example the case of John R. Jewitt, a sailor who wrote a memoir about his years as a captive of the Nootka people on the Pacific Northwest coast from 1802 to 1805.\nGreat Northern War.\nDuring the Great Northern War of 1700 to 1721, Russian authorities sent many Swedish prisoners-of-war, especially those who surrendered after the Battle of Poltava in 1709, to Siberia.\nFrench Revolutionary wars and Napoleonic wars.\nThe earliest known purpose-built prisoner-of-war camp was established at Norman Cross in Huntingdonshire, England in 1797 to house the increasing number of prisoners from the French Revolutionary Wars and Napoleonic Wars. The average prison population was about 5,500 men. The lowest number recorded was 3,300 in October 1804 and 6,272 on 10 April 1810 was the highest number of prisoners recorded in any official document. Norman Cross Prison was intended to be a model depot providing the most humane treatment of prisoners of war. The British government went to great lengths to provide food of a quality at least equal to that available to locals. The senior officer from each quadrangle was permitted to inspect the food as it was delivered to the prison to ensure it was of sufficient quality. Despite the generous supply and quality of food, some prisoners died of starvation after gambling away their rations. Most of the men held in the prison were low-ranking soldiers and sailors, including midshipmen and junior officers, with a small number of privateers. About 100 senior officers and some civilians \"of good social standing\", mainly passengers on captured ships and the wives of some officers, were given \"parole\" outside the prison, mainly in Peterborough although some further afield. They were afforded the courtesy of their rank within English society.\nDuring the Battle of Leipzig, both sides used the city's cemetery as a lazaret and prisoner camp for around 6,000 POWs who lived in burial vaults and used coffins for firewood. Food was scarce and prisoners resorted to eating horses, cats, dogs or even human flesh. The bad conditions inside the graveyard contributed to a city-wide epidemic after the battle.\nPrisoner exchanges.\nThe extensive period of conflict during the American Revolutionary War and Napoleonic Wars (1793\u20131815), followed by the Anglo-American War of 1812, led to the emergence of a cartel system for the exchange of prisoners, even while the belligerents were at war. A cartel was usually arranged by the respective armed service for the exchange of like-ranked personnel. The aim was to achieve a reduction in the number of prisoners held, while at the same time alleviating shortages of skilled personnel in the home country.\nAmerican Civil War.\nAt the start of the American Civil War a system of paroles operated. Captives agreed not to fight until they were officially exchanged. Meanwhile, they were held in camps run by their own army where they were paid but not allowed to perform any military duties. The system of exchanges collapsed in 1863 when the Confederacy refused to exchange black prisoners. \nIn the late summer of 1864, a year after the Dix\u2013Hill Cartel was suspended, Confederate officials approached Union General Benjamin Butler, Union Commissioner of Exchange, about resuming the cartel and including the black prisoners. Butler contacted Grant for guidance on the issue, and Grant responded to Butler on 18 August 1864 with his now famous statement. He rejected the offer, stating in essence, that the Union could afford to leave their men in captivity, the Confederacy could not. After that about 56,000 of the 409,000 POWs died in prisons during the American Civil War, accounting for nearly 10% of the conflict's fatalities. Of the 45,000 Union prisoners of war confined in Camp Sumter, located near Andersonville, Georgia, 13,000 (28%) died. At Camp Douglas in Chicago, Illinois, 10% of its Confederate prisoners died during one cold winter month; and Elmira Prison in New York state, with a death rate of 25% (2,963), nearly equalled that of Andersonville.\nAmelioration.\nDuring the 19th century there were increased efforts to improve the treatment and processing of prisoners. As a result of these emerging conventions, a number of international conferences were held, starting with the Brussels Conference of 1874, with nations agreeing that it was necessary to prevent inhumane treatment of prisoners and the use of weapons causing unnecessary harm. Although no agreements were immediately ratified by the participating nations, work was continued that resulted in new conventions being adopted and becoming recognised as international law that specified that prisoners of war be treated humanely and diplomatically.\nHague and Geneva Conventions.\nChapter II of the Annex to the 1907 Hague Convention \"IV \u2013 The Laws and Customs of War on Land\" covered the treatment of prisoners of war in detail. These provisions were further expanded in the 1929 Geneva Convention on the Prisoners of War and were largely revised in the Third Geneva Convention in 1949.\nArticle 4 of the Third Geneva Convention protects captured military personnel, some guerrilla fighters, and certain civilians. It applies from the moment of capture until release or repatriation. Under the 1949 Geneva Conventions, POWs are protected persons, meaning their deprivation of rights afforded by the Third Convention could amount to a war crime. Article 17 of the Third Geneva Convention states that POWs can only be required to give their name, date of birth, rank and service number.\nThe ICRC has a special role to play, with regards to international humanitarian law, in restoring and maintaining family contact in times of war, in particular concerning the right of prisoners of war and internees to send and receive letters and cards (Geneva Convention (GC) III, art. 71 and GC IV, art. 107).\nHowever, nations vary in their dedication to following these laws, and historically the treatment of POWs has varied greatly. During World War II, Imperial Japan and Nazi Germany were notorious for atrocities against prisoners of war. The German military used the Soviet Union's refusal to sign the Geneva Convention as a reason for not providing the necessities of life to Soviet POWs; the Soviets also used Axis prisoners as forced labour. The Germans routinely executed Allied commandos captured behind German lines per the Commando Order.\nQualifications.\nTo be entitled to POW status, captured persons must be lawful combatants entitled to combatant's privilege\u2014which provides immunity from punishment for lawful acts of war, such as killing enemy combatants. To qualify under the Third Geneva Convention, a combatant must be part of a chain of command, wear a \"fixed distinctive marking, visible from a distance\", bear arms openly, and have conducted military operations according to the laws and customs of war. The Convention recognises a few other groups as well, such as \"Inhabitants of a non-occupied territory, who on the approach of the enemy spontaneously take up arms to resist the invading forces, without having had time to form themselves into regular armed units\".\nUnder Additional Protocol I, the requirement of a distinctive marking is waived. \"Francs-tireurs\", militias, insurgents, terrorists, saboteurs, mercenaries, and spies generally do not qualify because they do not fulfill the criteria of Additional Protocol I and are therefore unlawful combatants. Captured soldiers who do not get POW status are still protected like civilians under the Fourth Geneva Convention.\nThe criteria are applied primarily to \"international\" armed conflicts. The application of prisoner of war status in non-international armed conflicts like civil wars is guided by Additional Protocol II, but insurgents are often treated as traitors, terrorists, or criminals by government forces and are sometimes executed on spot or tortured. Guerrillas and other irregular combatants generally cannot expect to receive benefits from both civilian and military status simultaneously.\nRights.\nUnder the Third Geneva Convention, prisoners of war (POW) must be:\nIn addition, if wounded or sick on the battlefield, the prisoner will receive help from the International Committee of the Red Cross.\nWhen a country is responsible for breaches of prisoner of war rights, those accountable will be punished accordingly. An example of this is the Nuremberg and Tokyo Trials. German and Japanese military commanders were prosecuted for preparing and initiating a war of aggression, murder, ill treatment, and deportation of individuals, and genocide during World War II. Most were executed or sentenced to life in prison for their crimes.\nU.S. Code of Conduct and terminology.\nThe United States Military Code of Conduct was promulgated in 1955 via under President Dwight D. Eisenhower to serve as a moral code for United States service members who have been taken prisoner. It was created primarily in response to the breakdown of leadership and organisation, specifically when U.S. forces were POWs during the Korean War.\nWhen a military member is taken prisoner, the Code of Conduct reminds them that the chain of command is still in effect (the highest ranking service member eligible for command, regardless of service branch, is in command), and requires them to support their leadership. The Code of Conduct also requires service members to resist giving information to the enemy (beyond identifying themselves, that is, \"name, rank, serial number\"), receiving special favours or parole, or otherwise providing their enemy captors aid and comfort.\nSince the Vietnam War, the official U.S. military term for enemy POWs is EPW (Enemy Prisoner of War). This name change was introduced to distinguish between enemy and U.S. captives.\nIn 2000 the U.S. military replaced the designation \"Prisoner of War\" for captured American personnel with \"Missing-Captured\". A January 2008 directive states that the reasoning behind this is since \"Prisoner of War\" is the international legal recognised status for such people there is no need for any individual country to follow suit. This change remains relatively unknown even among experts in the field and \"Prisoner of War\" remains widely used in the Pentagon which has a \"POW/Missing Personnel Office\" and awards the Prisoner of War Medal.\nWorld War I.\nDuring World War I, about eight million men surrendered and were held in POW camps until the war ended. All nations pledged to follow the Hague rules on fair treatment of prisoners of war, and in general the POWs had a much higher survival rate than their peers who were not captured. Individual surrenders were uncommon; usually a large unit surrendered all its men. At Tannenberg 92,000 Russians surrendered during the battle. When the besieged garrison of Kaunas surrendered in 1915, 20,000 Russians became prisoners. Over half the Russian losses were prisoners as a proportion of those captured, wounded or killed. About 3.3\u00a0million men became prisoners.\nThe German Empire held 2.5\u00a0million prisoners; Russia held 2.9\u00a0million, and Britain and France held about 720,000, mostly gained in the period just before the Armistice in 1918. The US held 48,000. The most dangerous moment for POWs was the act of surrender, when helpless soldiers were sometimes killed or mistakenly shot down. Once prisoners reached a POW camp conditions were better (and often much better than in World War II), thanks in part to the efforts of the International Red Cross and inspections by neutral nations.\nThere was much harsh treatment of POWs in Germany, as recorded by the American ambassador (prior to America's entry into the war), James W. Gerard, who published his findings in \"My Four Years in Germany\". Even worse conditions are reported in the book \"Escape of a Princess Pat\" by the Canadian George Pearson. It was particularly bad in Russia, where starvation was common for prisoners and civilians alike; a quarter of the over 2\u00a0million POWs held there died. Nearly 375,000 of the 500,000 Austro-Hungarian prisoners of war taken by Russians perished in Siberia from smallpox and typhus. In Germany, food was short, but only 5 per cent died.\nThe Ottoman Empire often treated prisoners of war poorly. Some 11,800 British soldiers, most from the British Indian Army, became prisoners after the five-month Siege of Kut, in Mesopotamia, in April 1916. Many were weak and starved when they surrendered and 4,250 died in captivity.\nDuring the Sinai and Palestine campaign 217 Australian and unknown numbers of British, New Zealand and Indian soldiers were captured by Ottoman forces. About 50 per cent of the Australian prisoners were light horsemen including 48 missing believed captured on 1 May 1918 in the Jordan Valley. Australian Flying Corps pilots and observers were captured in the Sinai Peninsula, Palestine and the Levant. One third of all Australian prisoners were captured on Gallipoli including the crew of the submarine AE2 which made a passage through the Dardanelles in 1915. Forced marches and crowded railway journeys preceded years in camps where disease, poor diet and inadequate medical facilities prevailed. About 25 per cent of other ranks died, many from malnutrition, while only one officer died. The most curious case came in Russia where the Czechoslovak Legion of Czechoslovak prisoners (from the Austro-Hungarian army) who were released and armed to fight on the side of the Entente, who briefly served as a military and diplomatic force during the Russian Civil War.\nRelease of prisoners.\nAt the end of the war in 1918 there were believed to be 140,000 British prisoners of war in Germany, including thousands of internees held in neutral Switzerland. The first British prisoners were released and reached Calais on 15 November. Plans were made for them to be sent via Dunkirk to Dover and a large reception camp was established at Dover capable of housing 40,000 men, which could later be used for demobilisation.\nOn 13 December 1918, the armistice was extended and the Allies reported that by 9 December 264,000 prisoners had been repatriated. A very large number of these had been released \"en masse\" and sent across Allied lines without any food or shelter. This created difficulties for the receiving Allies and many ex-prisoners died from exhaustion. The released POWs were met by cavalry troops and sent back through the lines in lorries to reception centres where they were refitted with boots and clothing and dispatched to the ports in trains.\nUpon arrival at the receiving camp the POWs were registered and \"boarded\" before being dispatched to their own homes. All commissioned officers had to write a report on the circumstances of their capture and to ensure that they had done all they could to avoid capture. Each returning officer and man was given a message from King George V, written in his own hand and reproduced on a lithograph.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The Queen joins me in welcoming you on your release from the miseries &amp; hardships, which you have endured with so much patience and courage.\nDuring these many months of trial, the early rescue of our gallant Officers &amp; Men from the cruelties of their captivity has been uppermost in our thoughts.\nWe are thankful that this longed for day has arrived, &amp; that back in the old Country you will be able once more to enjoy the happiness of a home &amp; to see good days among those who anxiously look for your return.\u2014\u200a\nWhile the Allied prisoners were sent home at the end of the war, the same treatment was not granted to Central Powers prisoners of the Allies and Russia, many of whom had to serve as forced labour, e.g. in France, until 1920. They were released after many approaches by the ICRC to the Allied Supreme Council.\nWorld War II.\nHistorian Niall Ferguson, in addition to figures from Keith Lowe, tabulated the total death rate for POWs in World War II as follows:\nTreatment of POWs by the Axis.\nEmpire of Japan.\nThe Empire of Japan, which had signed but never ratified the 1929 Geneva Convention on Prisoners of War, did not treat prisoners of war in accordance with international agreements, including provisions of the Hague Conventions, either during the Second Sino-Japanese War or during the Pacific War, because the Japanese viewed surrender as dishonorable. Moreover, according to a directive ratified on 5 August 1937 by Emperor Hirohito, the constraints of the Hague Conventions were explicitly removed on Chinese prisoners of war.\nPrisoners of war from China, the United States, Australia, Britain, Canada, India, the Netherlands, New Zealand, the Philippines, and Japanese-occupied Asia, held by Japanese imperial armed forces were subject to murder, torture (both physical and psychological), beatings, extrajudicial punishment, slavery, medical experiments, starvation rations, poor medical treatment and cannibalism. The most notorious use of forced labour was in the construction of the Burma\u2013Thailand Death Railway. After 20 March 1943, the Imperial Navy was ordered to kill prisoners of war taken at sea. After the Armistice of Cassibile, Italian soldiers and civilians in East Asia were taken as prisoners of war by Japanese armed forces and subject to the same conditions as other POWs.\nAccording to the findings of the Tokyo Tribunal, the Japanese captured 350,000 POWs, of which 131,134 came from Britain, the Netherlands, Australia, the United States, Canada, and New Zealand. Of these 131,134 POWs, 35,756 died while detained, the death rate of Western prisoners was thus 27.1 per cent, seven times that of Western POWs under the Germans and Italians. The death rate of Chinese was much higher. Thus, while 37,583 prisoners from the United Kingdom, 28,500 from the Netherlands, and 14,473 from the United States were released after the surrender of Japan, the number for the Chinese was only 56. The 27,465 US Army POWs captured in the Pacific Theater, including Filipinos, had a 40.4 per cent death rate. The War Ministry in Tokyo issued an order at the end of the war allowing local commanders to kill remaining POWs without formal orders from Tokyo.\nNo direct access to the POWs was provided to the International Red Cross. Escapes among the prisoners of European descent were almost impossible because of the difficulty of hiding in Asiatic populations.\nAllied POW camps and ship-transports became accidental targets of Allied attacks. The number of deaths which occurred when Japanese \"hell ships\"\u2014unmarked transport ships in which POWs were transported in harsh conditions\u2014were attacked by U.S. Navy submarines was particularly high. Gavan Daws has calculated that \"of all POWs who died in the Pacific War, one in three was killed on the water by friendly fire\". Daws states that 10,800 of the 50,000 POWs shipped by the Japanese were killed at sea while Donald L. Miller states that \"approximately 21,000 Allied POWs died at sea, about 19,000 of them killed by friendly fire.\"\nLife in the POW camps was recorded at great risk to themselves by artists such as Jack Bridger Chalker, Philip Meninsky, Ashley George Old, and Ronald Searle. Human hair was often used for brushes, plant juices and blood for paint, toilet paper as the \"canvas\". Some of their works were used as evidence in the trials of Japanese war criminals.\nFemale prisoners (detainees) at Changi Prison in Singapore, recorded their ordeal in seemingly harmless prison quilt embroidery.\nGermany.\nFrench soldiers.\nAfter the French armies surrendered in summer 1940, Germany seized two million French prisoners of war and sent them to camps in Germany. About one third were released on various terms. Of the remainder, the officers and non-commissioned officers were kept in camps and did not work. The privates were sent out to work. About half of them worked for German agriculture, where food supplies were adequate and controls were lenient. The others worked in factories or mines, where conditions were much harsher.\nWestern Allies' POWs.\nGermany and Italy generally treated prisoners from the British Empire and Commonwealth, France, the U.S., and other western Allies in accordance with the Geneva Convention, which had been signed by these countries. Consequently, western Allied officers were not usually made to work and some personnel of lower rank were usually compensated, or not required to work either. The main complaints of western Allied prisoners of war in German POW camps\u2014especially during the last two years of the war\u2014concerned shortages of food.\nOnly a small proportion of western Allied POWs who were Jews\u2014or whom the Nazis believed to be Jewish\u2014were killed as part of the Holocaust or were subjected to other antisemitic policies. For example, Major Yitzhak Ben-Aharon, a Palestinian Jew who had enlisted in the British Army, and who was captured by the Germans in Greece in 1941, experienced four years of captivity under entirely normal conditions for POWs.\nA small number of Allied personnel were sent to concentration camps, for a variety of reasons including being Jewish. As the US historian Joseph Robert White put it: \"An important exception ... is the sub-camp for U.S. POWs at Berga an der Elster, officially called \"Arbeitskommando 625\" [also known as \"Stalag IX-B\"]. Berga was the deadliest work detachment for American captives in Germany. 73 men who participated, or 21 percent of the detachment, perished in two months. 80 of the 350 POWs were Jews.\" Another well-known example was a group of 168 Australian, British, Canadian, New Zealand and US aviators who were held for two months at Buchenwald concentration camp; two of the POWs died at Buchenwald. Two possible reasons have been suggested for this incident: German authorities wanted to make an example of \"Terrorflieger\" (\"terrorist aviators\") or these aircrews were classified as spies, because they had been disguised as civilians or enemy soldiers when they were apprehended.\nInformation on conditions in the stalags is contradictory depending on the source. Some American POWs claimed the Germans were victims of circumstance and did the best they could, while others accused their captors of brutalities and forced labour. In any case, the prison camps were miserable places where food rations were meager and conditions squalid. One American admitted \"The only difference between the stalags and concentration camps was that we weren't gassed or shot in the former. I do not recall a single act of compassion or mercy on the part of the Germans.\" Typical meals consisted of a bread slice and watery potato soup which was still more substantial than what Soviet POWs or concentration camp inmates received. Another prisoner stated that \"The German plan was to keep us alive, yet weakened enough that we wouldn't attempt escape.\"\nAs the Red Army approached some POW camps in early 1945, German guards forced western Allied POWs to walk long distances towards central Germany, often in extreme winter weather conditions. It is estimated that, out of 257,000 POWs, about 80,000 were subject to such marches and up to 3,500 of them died as a result.\nItalian POWs.\nIn September 1943 after the Armistice, Italian officers and soldiers in many places waiting for orders were arrested by Germans and Italian fascists and taken to internment camps in Germany or Eastern Europe, where they were held for the duration of the war. The International Red Cross could do nothing for them, as they were not regarded as POWs, but the prisoners held the status of \"military internees\". Treatment of the prisoners was generally poor. The author Giovannino Guareschi was among those interned and wrote about this time in his life. The book was translated and published as \"My Secret Diary\". He wrote about semi-starvation, the casual murder of individual prisoners by guards and how, when they were released (now from a German camp), they found a deserted German town filled with foodstuffs that they (with other released prisoners) ate.. It is estimated that of the 700,000 Italians taken prisoner by the Germans, around 40,000 died in detention and more than 13,000 lost their lives during the transportation from the Greek islands to the mainland.\nEastern European POWs.\nBetween 1941 and 1945 the Axis powers took about 5.7\u00a0million Soviet prisoners. About one million of them were released during the war, in that their status changed but they remained under German authority. A little over 500,000 either escaped or were liberated by the Red Army. Some 930,000 more were found alive in camps after the war. The remaining 3.3\u00a0million prisoners (57.5% of the total captured) died during their captivity. Between the launching of Operation Barbarossa in the summer of 1941 and the following spring, 2.8\u00a0million of the 3.2\u00a0million Soviet prisoners taken died while in German hands. According to Russian military historian General Grigoriy Krivosheyev, the Axis powers took 4.6\u00a0million Soviet prisoners, of whom 1.8\u00a0million were found alive in camps after the war and 318,770 were released by the Axis during the war and were then drafted into the Soviet armed forces again. By comparison, 8,348 Western Allied prisoners died in German camps during 1939\u201345 (3.5% of the 232,000 total).\nThe Germans officially justified their policy on the grounds that the Soviet Union had not signed the Geneva Convention. Legally, however, under article 82 of the Geneva Convention, signatory countries had to give POWs of all signatory and non-signatory countries the rights assigned by the convention. Shortly after the German invasion in 1941, the USSR made Berlin an offer of a reciprocal adherence to the Hague Conventions. Third Reich officials left the Soviet \"note\" unanswered.\nRomania.\nSoviet POWs.\nBetween 1941 and 1944, 91,060 Soviet prisoners of war were captured by the Romanian Army. Until August 1944, 5,221 Soviet prisoners died in Romanian camps mainly to disease during winter. The POWs were treated according to the 1929 Geneva Convention, which was ratified by Romania on 15 September 1931. Initially, the prisoners were held in five POW camps in Vulcan, G\u0103e\u0219ti, Dr\u0103g\u0103\u0219ani, Alexandria and Slobozia. By 1942, the number reached 12 camps of which 10 were in Romania, and two in Transnistria at Tiraspol and Odesa. As the frontline moved further away, the captured prisoners were given to German POW camps, and then they were transferred to Romanian ones after requests from the Romanian authorities.\nIn the winter of 1941/1942, the conditions of the POW camps were unsatisfactory, leading to the deaths of prisoners due to various diseases. The conditions were improved in 1942 when, by order of Marshal Ion Antonescu, the organisations leading the camps were to permanently control how the prisoners were accommodated, cared for, fed, and used. Due to some problems that arose with the food allowance in 1942, it was decided that the prisoners were to be fed like the Romanian troops, with an allocated 30 lei per soldier per day.\nIn accordance with Article 27 of the Geneva Convention, the POWs were used in various productive activities. In return for providing work, the prisoners were granted payment and accommodation, as well as free time for cleaning, rest, and religious or other activities by their employers, according to the contracts signed with the commanders of the prison camps. The main workplaces for prisoners were in agriculture and industrial enterprises, but also in forestry, civil works, and in service of the POW camps.\nFor correspondence with their families, the prisoners were provided with postcards. However, most of these were not used as the POWs feared reprisals from the Soviet authorities upon learning that they were prisoners in Romania. The punishment of POWs in the Romanian camps was applied following the regulations of the Romanian Army. Executions by firing squad were few. The escapees who were caught and did not commit any acts of sabotage or espionage were tried by court-martial and sentenced to prison terms from 3\u20136 months to several years. After 23 August 1944, the Soviet POWs were handed over to the Soviet headquarters.\nWestern Allies' POWs.\nThe first Americans were captured in Romania following Operation Tidal Wave. The airmen were interned at first in the court of the Central Seminary in Bucharest, with the wounded airmen taken to the no. 415 Hospital in Sinaia. After Marshal Antonescu's visits, a new camp was to be set up, and the prisoners were to be treated according to the Geneva Convention. In September, all 110 POWs were transferred to the villas belonging to the Bra\u0219ov and Giurgiu City Halls at Timi\u0219ul de Jos, in the newly established Camp No. 14 (\"Lag\u0103rul de prizonieri nr. 14\"). The excellent living conditions at the camp earned it the nickname \"gilded cage\", with the prisoners describing it as \"probably the best prison camp in the world\". The treatment of the Allied POWs was overseen by Princess Catherine Caradja, who was nicknamed \"The Angel of Ploie\u0219ti\" by the airmen.\nIn the spring of 1944, with the increasing number of American and British prisoners due to the restarted air campaign, a new camp was set up in Bucharest. Camp No. 13 from Bucharest was initially located within the barracks of the 6th Guard Regiment \"Mihai Viteazul\", in a frequently bombed area. It was later moved to the Normal School on St. Ecaterina Street. In June 1944, the non-commissioned officers were transferred to a wing of the \"Regina Elisabeta\" Military Hospital. After 23 August, at the request of the prisoners to be organised into a military unit, General Mihail Racovi\u021b\u0103 approved the transfer of 896 POWs to the barracks of the 4th V\u00e2n\u0103tori Regiment. All Western Allied POWs were evacuated to Italy during Operation Reunion from 31 August to 3 September.\nTreatment of POWs by the Soviet Union.\nGermans, Romanians, Italians, Hungarians, Finns.\nAccording to some sources, the Soviets captured 3.5\u00a0million Axis servicemen (excluding Japanese), of whom more than a million died. One specific example is that of the German POWs after the Battle of Stalingrad, where the Soviets captured 91,000 German troops in total (completely exhausted, starving and sick), of whom only 5,000 survived the captivity.\nGerman soldiers were kept as forced labour for many years after the war. The last German POWs like Erich Hartmann, the highest-scoring fighter ace in the history of aerial warfare, who had been declared guilty of war crimes but without due process, were not released by the Soviets until 1955, two years after Stalin died.\nPolish.\nAs a result of the Soviet invasion of Poland in 1939, hundreds of thousands of Polish soldiers became prisoners of war in the Soviet Union. Thousands were executed; over 20,000 Polish military personnel and civilians perished in the Katyn massacre. Out of Anders' 80,000 evacuees from the Soviet Union to the United Kingdom, only 310 volunteered to return to Poland in 1947.\nOf the 230,000 Polish prisoners of war taken by the Soviet army, only 82,000 survived.\nJapanese.\nAfter the Soviet\u2013Japanese War, 560,000 to 760,000 Japanese prisoners of war were captured by the Soviet Union. The prisoners were captured in Manchuria, Korea, South Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands, then sent to work as forced labour in the Soviet Union and Mongolia. An estimated 60,000 to 347,000 of these Japanese prisoners of war died in captivity.\nAmericans.\nStories that circulated during the Cold War claimed 23,000 Americans held in German POW camps had been seized by the Soviets and never been repatriated. The claims had been perpetuated after the release of people like John H. Noble. Careful scholarly studies demonstrated that this was a myth based on the misinterpretation of a telegram about Soviet prisoners held in Italy.\nTreatment of POWs by the Western Allies.\nGermans.\nDuring the war, the armies of Western Allied nations such as Australia, Canada, the UK and the US were given orders to treat Axis prisoners strictly in accordance with the Geneva Convention. Some breaches of the Convention took place, however. According to Stephen E. Ambrose, of the roughly 1,000 US combat veterans he had interviewed, only one admitted to shooting a prisoner, saying he \"felt remorse, but would do it again\". However, one-third of interviewees told him they had seen fellow US troops kill German prisoners.\nIn Britain, German prisoners, particularly higher-ranked officers, were housed in luxurious buildings where listening devices were installed. A considerable amount of military intelligence was gained from eavesdropping on what the officers believed were private casual conversations. Much of the listening was carried out by German refugees, in many cases Jews. The work of these refugees in contributing to the Allied victory was declassified over half a century later.\nIn February 1944, 59.7% of POWs in America were employed. This relatively low percentage was due to problems setting wages that would not compete against those of non-prisoners, to union opposition, as well as concerns about security, sabotage, and escape. Given national manpower shortages, citizens and employers resented the idle prisoners, and efforts were made to decentralise the camps and reduce security enough that more prisoners could work. By the end of May 1944, POW employment was at 72.8%, and by late April 1945 it had risen to 91.3%. The sector that made the most use of POW workers was agriculture. There was more demand than supply of prisoners throughout the war, and 14,000 POW repatriations were delayed in 1946 so prisoners could be used in the spring farming seasons, mostly to thin and block sugar beets in the west. While some in Congress wanted to extend POW labour beyond June 1946, President Truman rejected this, leading to the end of the program.\nTowards the end of the war in Europe, as large numbers of Axis soldiers surrendered, the US created the designation of Disarmed Enemy Forces (DEF) so as not to treat prisoners as POWs. A lot of these soldiers were kept in open fields in makeshift camps in the Rhine valley (\"Rheinwiesenlager\"). Controversy has arisen about how Eisenhower managed these prisoners. (see \"Other Losses\").\nAfter the surrender of Germany in May 1945, the POW status of the German prisoners was in many cases maintained, and they were for several years used as public labourers in countries such as the UK and France. Many died when forced to clear minefields in countries such as Norway and France. \"By September 1945 it was estimated by the French authorities that two thousand prisoners were being maimed and killed each month in accidents\".\nIn 1946, the UK held over 400,000 German POWs, many having been transferred from POW camps in the US and Canada. They were employed as labourers to compensate for the lack of manpower in Britain, as a form of war reparation. A public debate ensued in the UK over the treatment of German prisoners of war, with many in Britain comparing the treatment to the POWs to slave labour. In 1947, the Ministry of Agriculture argued against repatriation of working German prisoners, since by then they made up 25 per cent of the land workforce, and it wanted to continue having them work in the UK until 1948.\nThe \"London Cage\", an MI19 prisoner of war facility in London used during and immediately after the war to interrogate prisoners before sending them to prison camps, was subject to allegations of torture.\nAfter the German surrender, the International Red Cross was prohibited from providing aid, such as food or prisoner visits, to POW camps in Germany. However, after making appeals to the Allies in the autumn of 1945, the Red Cross was allowed to investigate the camps in the British and French occupation zones of Germany, as well as providing relief to the prisoners held there. On 4 February 1946, the Red Cross was also permitted to visit and assist prisoners in the US occupation zone of Germany, although only with very small quantities of food. \"During their visits, the delegates observed that German prisoners of war were often detained in appalling conditions. They drew the attention of the authorities to this fact, and gradually succeeded in getting some improvements made\".\nPOWs were also transferred among the Allies, with for example 6,000 German officers transferred from Western Allied camps to the Soviets and subsequently imprisoned in the Sachsenhausen concentration camp, at the time one of the NKVD special camps. Although the Soviet Union had not signed the Geneva Convention, the U.S. chose to hand over several hundred thousand German prisoners to the Soviet Union in May 1945 as a \"gesture of friendship\". U.S. forces also refused to accept the surrender of German troops attempting to surrender to them in Saxony and Bohemia, and handed them over to the Soviet Union instead.\nThe United States handed over 740,000 German prisoners to France, which was a Geneva Convention signatory but which used them as forced labourers. Newspapers reported that the POWs were being mistreated; Judge Robert H. Jackson, chief US prosecutor in the Nuremberg trials, told US President Harry S Truman in October 1945 that the Allies themselves,\nhave done or are doing some of the very things we are prosecuting the Germans for. The French are so violating the Geneva Convention in the treatment of prisoners of war that our command is taking back prisoners sent to them. We are prosecuting plunder and our Allies are practising it.\nHungarians.\nHungarians became POWs of the Western Allies. Some of these were, like the Germans, used as forced labour in France after the cessation of hostilities. After the war, Hungarian POWs were handed over to the Soviets and transported to the Soviet Union for forced labour. Such forced Hungarian labour by the USSR is often referred to as malenkij robot\u2014little work. Andr\u00e1s Toma, a Hungarian soldier taken prisoner by the Red Army in 1944, was discovered in a Russian psychiatric hospital in 2000. It is likely that he was the last prisoner of war from World War II to be repatriated.\nJapanese.\nAlthough thousands of Japanese servicemembers were taken prisoner of war, most fought until they were killed or committed suicide. Of the 22,000 Japanese soldiers present at the beginning of the Battle of Iwo Jima, over 20,000 were killed and only 216 were taken prisoner of war. Of the 30,000 Japanese troops that defended Saipan, fewer than 1,000 remained alive at battle's end. Japanese prisoners of war sent to camps fared well; however, some were killed when attempting to surrender or were massacred just after doing so (see Allied war crimes during World War II in the Pacific). In some instances, Japanese prisoners of war were tortured through a variety of methods. A method of torture used by the Chinese National Revolutionary Army (NRA) included suspending prisoners by the neck in wooden cages until they died. In very rare cases, some were beheaded by sword, and a severed head was once used as a football by Chinese National Revolutionary Army (NRA) soldiers.\nAfter the war, many Japanese POWs were kept on as Japanese Surrendered Personnel until mid-1947 by the Allies. The JSP were used until 1947 for labour purposes, such as road maintenance, recovering corpses for reburial, cleaning, and preparing farmland. Early tasks also included repairing airfields damaged by Allied bombing during the war and maintaining law and order until the arrival of Allied forces in the region.\nItalians.\nIn 1943, Italy overthrew Mussolini and became an Allied co-belligerent. This did not change the status of many Italian POWs, retained in Australia, the UK and US due to labour shortages.\nAfter Italy surrendered to the Allies and declared war on Germany, the United States initially made plans to send Italian POWs back to fight Germany. Ultimately though, the government decided instead to loosen POW work requirements prohibiting Italian prisoners from carrying out war-related work. About 34,000 Italian POWs were active in 1944 and 1945 on 66 US military installations, performing support roles such as quartermaster, repair, and engineering work as Italian Service Units.\nCossacks.\nOn 11 February 1945, at the conclusion of the Yalta Conference, the United States and United Kingdom signed a Repatriation Agreement with the USSR. The interpretation of this agreement resulted in the forcible repatriation of all Soviets (Operation Keelhaul) regardless of their wishes. The forced repatriation operations took place in 1945\u20131947.\nPost-World War II.\nDuring the Korean War, the North Koreans developed a reputation for torturing and severely mistreating prisoners of war (see Treatment of POWs by North Korean and Chinese forces). Their POWs were housed in three camps, according to their potential usefulness to the North Korean army. Peace camps and reform camps were for POWs that were either sympathetic to the cause or who had valued skills that could be useful to the North Korean military; these enemy soldiers were indoctrinated and sometimes conscripted into the North Korean army. While POWs in peace camps were reportedly treated with more consideration, regular prisoners of war were usually tortured or treated very poorly.\nThe 1952 Inter-Camp POW Olympics were held from 15 to 27 November 1952 in Pyuktong, North Korea. The Chinese hoped to gain worldwide publicity, and while some prisoners refused to participate, some 500 POWs of eleven nationalities took part. They came from all the North Korean prison camps and competed in football, baseball, softball, basketball, volleyball, track and field, soccer, gymnastics, and boxing. For the POWs, this was also an opportunity to meet with friends from other camps. The prisoners had their own photographers, announcers, and even reporters, who after each day's competition published a newspaper, the \"Olympic Roundup\".\nAt the end of the First Indochina War, of the 11,721 French soldiers taken prisoner after the Battle of Dien Bien Phu and led by the Viet Minh on death marches to distant POW camps, only 3,290 were repatriated four months later.\nDuring the Vietnam War, the Viet Cong and North Vietnamese Army took many South Vietnamese and United States servicemembers as prisoners of war and subjected them to mistreatment and torture. Some American and South Vietnamese prisoners of war were held in the prison known to US POWs as the Hanoi Hilton. North Vietnamese and Viet Cong held in custody by South Vietnamese and American forces were also tortured and badly treated. After the war, millions of South Vietnamese servicemen and government workers were sent to \"re-education\" camps, where many perished.\nAs in previous conflicts, speculation existed, without evidence, that a handful of American pilots captured during the Korean and Vietnam wars were transferred to the Soviet Union and never repatriated.\nRegardless of regulations determining treatment of prisoners, violations of their rights continue to be reported. Many cases of POW massacres have been reported in recent times, including the murder of Israeli prisoners of war in the 1973 Yom Kippur War by their Egyptian captors, the 13 October massacre in Lebanon by Syrian forces and June 1990 massacre in Sri Lanka.\nIndian intervention in the Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971 led to the third Indo-Pakistan war, which ended in Indian victory and the capture of 93,000 Pakistani POWs, they were later slowly repatriated in a deal with Pakistani President Zulfikar Ali Bhutto.\nIn 1982, during the Falklands War, prisoners were well-treated in general by both sides, with military commanders dispatching enemy prisoners back to their homelands in record time following the end of the war.\nIn 1991, during the Gulf War, American, British, Italian, and Kuwaiti POWs (mostly crew members of downed aircraft and special forces) were tortured by the Iraqi secret police. An American military doctor, Major Rhonda Cornum, a 37-year-old flight surgeon captured when her Blackhawk UH-60 was shot down, was also subjected to sexual abuse.\nDuring the Yugoslav Wars in the 1990s, Serb paramilitary forces supported by JNA forces killed POWs at Vukovar and \u0160karbrnja, while Bosnian Serb forces killed POWs at Srebrenica. A large number of surviving Croatian or Bosnian POWs described the conditions in Serbian concentration camps as similar to those in Germany in World War II, including regular beatings, torture and random executions.\nIn 2001, reports emerged concerning two POWs that India had taken during the Sino-Indian War, Yang Chen and Shih Liang. The two were imprisoned as spies for three years before being interned in a mental asylum in Ranchi, where they spent the following 38 years under a special prisoner status.\nThe last prisoners of the 1980\u20131988 Iran\u2013Iraq War were exchanged in 2003.\nDuring the invasion of Ukraine by Russia, Ukrainian POWs have described being tortured by Russian forces using electrocution, beatings, and sexual abuse. Both sides of the conflict forced prisoners to be naked at times as a humiliating punishment. According to the Israeli human rights group B'tselem, since the outbreak of the Gaza war in October 2023, the abuse of Palestinian detainees has become so institutionalized that the prisons should be called 'torture camps'.\nNumbers of POWs.\nThis section lists nations with the highest number of POWs since the start of World War II and ranked by descending order. These are also the highest numbers in any war since the Convention Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War entered into force on 19 June 1931. The USSR had not signed the Geneva Convention.\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Privacy may also take the form of bodily integrity.\nThroughout history, there have been various conceptions of privacy. Most cultures acknowledge the right of individuals to keep aspects of their personal lives out of the public domain. The right to be free from unauthorized invasions of privacy by governments, corporations, or individuals is enshrined in the privacy laws of many countries and, in some instances, their constitutions.\nWith the rise of technology, the debate regarding privacy has expanded from a bodily sense to include a digital sense. In most countries, the right to digital privacy is considered an extension of the original right to privacy, and many countries have passed acts that further protect digital privacy from public and private entities.\nThere are multiple techniques to invade privacy, which may be employed by corporations or governments for profit or political reasons. Conversely, in order to protect privacy, people may employ encryption or anonymity measures.\nEtymology.\nThe word privacy is derived from the Latin word and concept of '\"privatus\"', which referred to things set apart from what is public; personal and belonging to oneself, and not to the state. Literally, '\"privatus\"' is the past participle of the Latin verb '\"privere\"' meaning 'to be deprived of'.\nHistory.\nPhilosophical views on privacy.\nThe concept of privacy has been explored and discussed by numerous philosophers throughout history.\nPrivacy has historical roots in ancient Greek philosophical discussions. The most well-known of these was Aristotle's distinction between two spheres of life: the public sphere of the \"polis\", associated with political life, and the private sphere of the \"oikos\", associated with domestic life. Privacy is valued along with other basic necessities of life in the Jewish deutero-canonical Book of Sirach.\nIslam's holy text, the Qur'an, states the following regarding privacy: 'Do not spy on one another' (49:12); 'Do not enter any houses except your own homes unless you are sure of their occupants' consent' (24:27).\nEnglish philosopher John Locke's (1632-1704) writings on natural rights and the social contract laid the groundwork for modern conceptions of individual rights, including the right to privacy. In his \"Second Treatise of Civil Government\" (1689), Locke argued that a man is entitled to his own self through one's natural rights of life, liberty, and property. He believed that the government was responsible for protecting these rights so individuals were guaranteed private spaces to practice personal activities.\nIn the political sphere, philosophers hold differing views on the right of private judgment. German philosopher Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel (1770-1831) makes the distinction between \"moralit\u00e4t\", which refers to an individual's private judgment, and \"sittlichkeit\", pertaining to one's rights and obligations as defined by an existing corporate order. On the contrary, Jeremy Bentham (1748-1832), an English philosopher, interpreted law as an invasion of privacy. His theory of utilitarianism argued that legal actions should be judged by the extent of their contribution to human wellbeing, or necessary utility.\nHegel's notions were modified by prominent 19th century English philosopher John Stuart Mill. Mill's essay \"On Liberty\" (1859) argued for the importance of protecting individual liberty against the tyranny of the majority and the interference of the state. His views emphasized the right of privacy as essential for personal development and self-expression.\nDiscussions surrounding surveillance coincided with philosophical ideas on privacy. Jeremy Bentham developed the phenomenon known as the Panoptic effect through his 1791 architectural design of a prison called Panopticon. The phenomenon explored the possibility of surveillance as a general awareness of being watched that could never be proven at any particular moment. French philosopher Michel Foucault (1926-1984) concluded that the possibility of surveillance in the instance of the Panopticon meant a prisoner had no choice but to conform to the prison's rules.\nTechnology.\nAs technology has advanced, the way in which privacy is protected and violated has changed with it. In the case of some technologies, such as the printing press or the Internet, the increased ability to share information can lead to new ways in which privacy can be breached. It is generally agreed that the first publication advocating privacy in the United States was the 1890 article by Samuel Warren and Louis Brandeis, \"The Right to Privacy\", and that it was written mainly in response to the increase in newspapers and photographs made possible by printing technologies.\nIn 1948, \"1984,\" written by George Orwell, was published. A classic dystopian novel, \"1984\" describes the life of Winston Smith in 1984, located in Oceania, a totalitarian state. The all-controlling Party, the party in power led by Big Brother, is able to control power through mass surveillance and limited freedom of speech and thought. George Orwell provides commentary on the negative effects of totalitarianism, particularly on privacy and censorship. Parallels have been drawn between \"1984\" and modern censorship and privacy, a notable example being that large social media companies, rather than the government, are able to monitor a user's data and decide what is allowed to be said online through their censorship policies, ultimately for monetary purposes.\nIn the 1960s, people began to consider how changes in technology were bringing changes in the concept of privacy. Vance Packard's \"The Naked Society\" was a popular book on privacy from that era and led US discourse on privacy at that time. In addition, Alan Westin's \"Privacy and Freedom\" shifted the debate regarding privacy from a physical sense, how the government controls a person's body (i.e. \"Roe v. Wade\") and other activities such as wiretapping and photography. As important records became digitized, Westin argued that personal data was becoming too accessible and that a person should have complete jurisdiction over their data, laying the foundation for the modern discussion of privacy.\nNew technologies can also create new ways to gather private information. In 2001, the legal case \"Kyllo v. United States\" (533 U.S. 27) determined that the use of thermal imaging devices that can reveal previously unknown information without a warrant constitutes a violation of privacy. In 2019, after developing a corporate rivalry in competing voice-recognition software, Apple and Amazon required employees to listen to intimate moments and faithfully transcribe the contents.\nPolice and government.\nPolice and citizens often conflict on what degree the police can intrude a citizen's digital privacy. For instance, in 2012, the Supreme Court ruled unanimously in \"United States v. Jones\" (565 U.S. 400), in the case of Antoine Jones who was arrested of drug possession using a GPS tracker on his car that was placed without a warrant, that warrantless tracking infringes the Fourth Amendment. The Supreme Court also justified that there is some \"reasonable expectation of privacy\" in transportation since the reasonable expectation of privacy had already been established under \"Griswold v. Connecticut\" (1965). The Supreme Court also further clarified that the Fourth Amendment did not only pertain to physical instances of intrusion but also digital instances, and thus \"United States v. Jones\" became a landmark case.\nIn 2014, the Supreme Court ruled unanimously in \"Riley v. California\" (573 U.S. 373), where David Leon Riley was arrested after he was pulled over for driving on expired license tags when the police searched his phone and discovered that he was tied to a shooting, that searching a citizen's phone without a warrant was an unreasonable search, a violation of the Fourth Amendment. The Supreme Court concluded that the cell phones contained personal information different from trivial items, and went beyond to state that information stored on the cloud was not necessarily a form of evidence. \"Riley v. California\" evidently became a landmark case, protecting the digital protection of citizen's privacy when confronted with the police.\nA recent notable occurrence of the conflict between law enforcement and a citizen in terms of digital privacy has been in the 2018 case, \"Carpenter v. United States\" (585 U.S. ____). In this case, the FBI used cell phone records without a warrant to arrest Timothy Ivory Carpenter on multiple charges, and the Supreme Court ruled that the warrantless search of cell phone records violated the Fourth Amendment, citing that the Fourth Amendment protects \"reasonable expectations of privacy\" and that information sent to third parties still falls under data that can be included under \"reasonable expectations of privacy\".\nBeyond law enforcement, many interactions between the government and citizens have been revealed either lawfully or unlawfully, specifically through whistleblowers. One notable example is Edward Snowden, who released multiple operations related to the mass surveillance operations of the National Security Agency (NSA), where it was discovered that the NSA continues to breach the security of millions of people, mainly through mass surveillance programs whether it was collecting great amounts of data through third party private companies, hacking into other embassies or frameworks of international countries, and various breaches of data, which prompted a culture shock and stirred international debate related to digital privacy.\nInternet.\nThe Internet and technologies built on it enable new forms of social interactions at increasingly faster speeds and larger scales. Because the computer networks which underlie the Internet introduce such a wide range of novel security concerns, the discussion of \"privacy\" on the Internet is often conflated with \"security\". Indeed, many entities such as corporations involved in the surveillance economy inculcate a security-focused conceptualization of privacy which reduces their obligations to uphold privacy into a matter of regulatory compliance, while at the same time lobbying to minimize those regulatory requirements.\nThe Internet's effect on privacy includes all of the ways that computational technology and the entities that control it can subvert the privacy expectations of their users. In particular, the right to be forgotten is motivated by both the \"computational ability\" to store and search through massive amounts of data as well as the \"subverted expectations\" of users who share information online without expecting it to be stored and retained indefinitely. Phenomena such as revenge porn and deepfakes are not merely individual because they require both the ability to obtain images without someone's consent as well as the social and economic infrastructure to disseminate that content widely. Therefore, privacy advocacy groups such as the Cyber Civil Rights Initiative and the Electronic Frontier Foundation argue that addressing the new privacy harms introduced by the Internet requires both technological improvements to encryption and anonymity as well as societal efforts such as legal regulations to restrict corporate and government power.\nWhile the Internet began as a government and academic effort up through the 1980s, private corporations began to enclose the hardware and software of the Internet in the 1990s, and now most Internet infrastructure is owned and managed by for-profit corporations. As a result, the ability of governments to protect their citizens' privacy is largely restricted to industrial policy, instituting controls on corporations that handle communications or personal data. Privacy regulations are often further constrained to only protect specific demographics such as children, or specific industries such as credit card bureaus.\nSocial networking.\nSeveral online social network sites (OSNs) are among the top 10 most visited websites globally. Facebook for example, as of August 2015, was the largest social-networking site, with nearly 2.7 billion members, who upload over 4.75 billion pieces of content daily. While Twitter is significantly smaller with 316 million registered users, the US Library of Congress recently announced that it will be acquiring and permanently storing the entire archive of public Twitter posts since 2006.\nA review and evaluation of scholarly work regarding the current state of the value of individuals' privacy of online social networking show the following results: \"first, adults seem to be more concerned about potential privacy threats than younger users; second, policy makers should be alarmed by a large part of users who underestimate risks of their information privacy on OSNs; third, in the case of using OSNs and its services, traditional one-dimensional privacy approaches fall short\". This is exacerbated by deanonymization research indicating that personal traits such as sexual orientation, race, religious and political views, personality, or intelligence can be inferred based on a wide variety of digital footprints, such as samples of text, browsing logs, or Facebook Likes.\nIntrusions of social media privacy are known to affect employment in the United States. Microsoft reports that 75 percent of U.S. recruiters and human-resource professionals now do online research about candidates, often using information provided by search engines, social-networking sites, photo/video-sharing sites, personal web sites and blogs, and Twitter. They also report that 70 percent of U.S. recruiters have rejected candidates based on internet information. This has created a need by many candidates to control various online privacy settings in addition to controlling their online reputations, the conjunction of which has led to legal suits against both social media sites and US employers.\nSelfie culture.\nSelfies are popular today. A search for photos with the hashtag #selfie retrieves over 23 million results on Instagram and 51 million with the hashtag #me. However, due to modern corporate and governmental surveillance, this may pose a risk to privacy. In a research study which takes a sample size of 3763, researchers found that for users posting selfies on social media, women generally have greater concerns over privacy than men, and that users' privacy concerns inversely predict their selfie behavior and activity.\nOnline harassment.\nAn invasion of someone's privacy may be widely and quickly disseminated over the Internet. When social media sites and other online communities fail to invest in content moderation, an invasion of privacy can expose people to a much greater volume and degree of harassment than would otherwise be possible. Revenge porn may lead to misogynist or homophobic harassment, such as in the suicide of Amanda Todd and the suicide of Tyler Clementi. When someone's physical location or other sensitive information is leaked over the Internet via doxxing, harassment may escalate to direct physical harm such as stalking or swatting.\nDespite the way breaches of privacy can magnify online harassment, online harassment is often used as a justification to curtail freedom of speech, by removing the expectation of privacy via anonymity, or by enabling law enforcement to invade privacy without a search warrant. In the wake of Amanda Todd's death, the Canadian parliament proposed a motion purporting to stop bullying, but Todd's mother herself gave testimony to parliament rejecting the bill due to its provisions for warrantless breaches of privacy, stating \"I don't want to see our children victimized again by losing privacy rights.\"\nEven where these laws have been passed despite privacy concerns, they have not demonstrated a reduction in online harassment. When the Korea Communications Commission introduced a registration system for online commenters in 2007, they reported that malicious comments only decreased by 0.9%, and in 2011 it was repealed. A subsequent analysis found that the set of users who posted the most comments actually increased the number of \"aggressive expressions\" when forced to use their real name.\nIn the US, while federal law only prohibits online harassment based on protected characteristics such as gender and race, individual states have expanded the definition of harassment to further curtail speech: Florida's definition of online harassment includes \"any use of data or computer software\" that \"Has the effect of substantially disrupting the orderly operation of a school.\"\nPrivacy and location-based services.\nIncreasingly, mobile devices facilitate location tracking. This creates user privacy problems. A user's location and preferences constitute personal information, and their improper use violates that user's privacy. A recent MIT study by de Montjoye et al. showed that four spatio-temporal points constituting approximate places and times are enough to uniquely identify 95% of 1.5M people in a mobility database. The study further shows that these constraints hold even when the resolution of the dataset is low. Therefore, even coarse or blurred datasets confer little privacy protection.\nSeveral methods to protect user privacy in location-based services have been proposed, including the use of anonymizing servers and blurring of information. Methods to quantify privacy have also been proposed, to calculate the equilibrium between the benefit of obtaining accurate location information and the risks of breaching an individual's privacy.\nEthical controversies over location privacy.\nThere have been scandals regarding location privacy. One instance was the scandal concerning AccuWeather, where it was revealed that AccuWeather was selling locational data. This consisted of a user's locational data, even if they opted out within Accuweather, which tracked users' location. Accuweather sold this data to Reveal Mobile, a company that monetizes data related to a user's location. Other international cases are similar to the Accuweather case. In 2017, a leaky API inside the McDelivery App exposed private data, which consisted of home addresses, of 2.2 million users.\nIn the wake of these types of scandals, many large American technology companies such as Google, Apple, and Facebook have been subjected to hearings and pressure under the U.S. legislative system. In 2011, US Senator Al Franken wrote an open letter to Steve Jobs, noting the ability of iPhones and iPads to record and store users' locations in unencrypted files. Apple claimed this was an unintentional software bug, but Justin Brookman of the Center for Democracy and Technology directly challenged that portrayal, stating \"I'm glad that they are fixing what they call bugs, but I take exception with their strong denial that they track users.\" In 2021, the U.S. state of Arizona found in a court case that Google misled its users and stored the location of users regardless of their location settings.\nAdvertising.\nThe Internet has become a significant medium for advertising, with digital marketing making up approximately half of the global ad spending in 2019. While websites are still able to sell advertising space without tracking, including via contextual advertising, digital ad brokers such as Facebook and Google have instead encouraged the practice of behavioral advertising, providing code snippets used by website owners to track their users via HTTP cookies. This tracking data is also sold to other third parties as part of the mass surveillance industry. Since the introduction of mobile phones, data brokers have also been planted within apps, resulting in a $350 billion digital industry especially focused on mobile devices.\nDigital privacy has become the main source of concern for many mobile users, especially with the rise of privacy scandals such as the Facebook\u2013Cambridge Analytica data scandal. Apple has received some reactions for features that prohibit advertisers from tracking a user's data without their consent. Google attempted to introduce an alternative to cookies named FLoC which it claimed reduced the privacy harms, but it later retracted the proposal due to antitrust probes and analyses that contradicted their claims of privacy.\nMetadata.\nThe ability to do online inquiries about individuals has expanded dramatically over the last decade. Importantly, directly observed behavior, such as browsing logs, search queries, or contents of a public Facebook profile, can be automatically processed to infer secondary information about an individual, such as sexual orientation, political and religious views, race, substance use, intelligence, and personality.\nIn Australia, the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Amendment (Data Retention) Act 2015 made a distinction between collecting the contents of messages sent between users and the metadata surrounding those messages.\nLegal right to privacy.\nMost countries give citizens rights to privacy in their constitutions. Representative examples of this include the Constitution of Brazil, which says \"the privacy, private life, honor and image of people are inviolable\"; the Constitution of South Africa says that \"everyone has a right to privacy\"; and the Constitution of the Republic of Korea says \"the privacy of no citizen shall be infringed.\" The Italian Constitution also defines the right to privacy. Among most countries whose constitutions do not explicitly describe privacy rights, court decisions have interpreted their constitutions to intend to give privacy rights.\nMany countries have broad privacy laws outside their constitutions, including Australia's Privacy Act 1988, Argentina's Law for the Protection of Personal Data of 2000, Canada's 2000 Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, and Japan's 2003 Personal Information Protection Law.\nBeyond national privacy laws, there are international privacy agreements. The United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights says \"No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with [their] privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to attacks upon [their] honor and reputation.\" The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development published its Privacy Guidelines in 1980. The European Union's 1995 Data Protection Directive guides privacy protection in Europe. The 2004 Privacy Framework by the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation is a privacy protection agreement for the members of that organization.\nFree market vs consumer protection.\nApproaches to privacy can, broadly, be divided into two categories: free market or consumer protection.\nOne example of the free market approach is to be found in the voluntary OECD Guidelines on the Protection of Privacy and Transborder Flows of Personal Data. The principles reflected in the guidelines, free of legislative interference, are analyzed in an article putting them into perspective with concepts of the GDPR put into law later in the European Union.\nIn a consumer protection approach, in contrast, it is claimed that individuals may not have the time or knowledge to make informed choices, or may not have reasonable alternatives available. In support of this view, Jensen and Potts showed that most privacy policies are above the reading level of the average person.\nBy country.\nAustralia.\nThe \"Privacy Act 1988\" is administered by the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner. The initial introduction of privacy law in 1998 extended to the public sector, specifically to Federal government departments, under the Information Privacy Principles. State government agencies can also be subject to state based privacy legislation. This built upon the already existing privacy requirements that applied to telecommunications providers (under Part 13 of the \"Telecommunications Act 1997\"), and confidentiality requirements that already applied to banking, legal and patient / doctor relationships.\nIn 2008 the Australian Law Reform Commission (ALRC) conducted a review of Australian privacy law and produced a report titled \"For Your Information\". Recommendations were taken up and implemented by the Australian Government via the Privacy Amendment (Enhancing Privacy Protection) Bill 2012.\nIn 2015, the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Amendment (Data Retention) Act 2015 was passed, to some controversy over its human rights implications and the role of media.\nCanada.\nCanada is a federal state whose provinces and territories abide by the common law save the province of Quebec whose legal tradition is the civil law. Privacy in Canada was first addressed through the \"Privacy Act\", a 1985 piece of legislation applicable to personal information held by government institutions. The provinces and territories would later follow suit with their own legislation. Generally, the purposes of said legislation are to provide individuals rights to access personal information; to have inaccurate personal information corrected; and to prevent unauthorized collection, use, and disclosure of personal information. In terms of regulating personal information in the private sector, the federal \"Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act\" (\"PIPEDA\") is enforceable in all jurisdictions unless a substantially similar provision has been enacted on the provincial level. However, inter-provincial or international information transfers still engage PIPEDA. PIPEDA has gone through two law overhaul efforts in 2021 and 2023 with the involvement of the Office of the Privacy Commissioner and Canadian academics. In the absence of a statutory private right of action absent an OPC investigation, the common law torts of intrusion upon seclusion and public disclosure of private facts, as well as the Civil Code of Quebec may be brought for an infringement or violation of privacy. Privacy is also protected under ss. 7 and 8 of the \"Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms\" which is typically applied in the criminal law context. In Quebec, individuals' privacy is safeguarded by articles 3 and 35 to 41 of the Civil Code of Quebec as well as by s. 5 of the Charter of human rights and freedoms.\nEuropean Union.\nIn 2016, the European Union passed the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which was intended to reduce the misuse of personal data and enhance individual privacy, by requiring companies to receive consent before acquiring personal information from users.\nAlthough there are comprehensive regulations for data protection in the European Union, one study finds that despite the laws, there is a lack of enforcement in that no institution feels responsible to control the parties involved and enforce their laws. The European Union also champions the Right to be Forgotten concept in support of its adoption by other countries.\nIndia.\nSince the introduction of the Aadhaar project in 2009, which resulted in all 1.2 billion Indians being associated with a 12-digit biometric-secured number. Aadhaar has uplifted the poor in India by providing them with a form of identity and preventing the fraud and waste of resources, as normally the government would not be able to allocate its resources to its intended assignees due to the ID issues. With the rise of Aadhaar, India has debated whether Aadhaar violates an individual's privacy and whether any organization should have access to an individual's digital profile, as the Aadhaar card became associated with other economic sectors, allowing for the tracking of individuals by both public and private bodies. Aadhaar databases have suffered from security attacks as well and the project was also met with mistrust regarding the safety of the social protection infrastructures. In 2017, where the Aadhar was challenged, the Indian Supreme Court declared privacy as a human right, but postponed the decision regarding the constitutionality of Aadhaar for another bench. In September 2018, the Indian Supreme Court determined that the Aadhaar project did not violate the legal right to privacy.\nUnited Kingdom.\nIn the United Kingdom, it is not possible to bring an action for invasion of privacy. An action may be brought under another tort (usually breach of confidence) and privacy must then be considered under EC law. In the UK, it is sometimes a defence that disclosure of private information was in the public interest. There is, however, the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), an independent public body set up to promote access to official information and protect personal information. They do this by promoting good practice, ruling on eligible complaints, giving information to individuals and organisations, and taking action when the law is broken. The relevant UK laws include: Data Protection Act 1998; Freedom of Information Act 2000; Environmental Information Regulations 2004; Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations 2003. The ICO has also provided a \"Personal Information Toolkit\" online which explains in more detail the various ways of protecting privacy online.\nUnited States.\nIn the United States, more systematic treatises of privacy did not appear until the 1890s, with the development of privacy law in America. Although the US Constitution does not explicitly include the right to privacy, individual as well as locational privacy may be implicitly granted by the Constitution under the 4th Amendment. The Supreme Court of the United States has found that other guarantees have \"penumbras\" that implicitly grant a right to privacy against government intrusion, for example in \"Griswold v. Connecticut\" and \"Roe v. Wade.\" \"Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization\" later overruled \"Roe v. Wade\", with Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas characterizing \"Griswold\"'s penumbral argument as having a \"facial absurdity\", casting doubt on the validity of a constitutional right to privacy in the United States and of previous decisions relying on it. In the United States, the right of freedom of speech granted in the First Amendment has limited the effects of lawsuits for breach of privacy. Privacy is regulated in the US by the Privacy Act of 1974, and various state laws. The Privacy Act of 1974 only applies to federal agencies in the executive branch of the federal government. Certain privacy rights have been established in the United States via legislation such as the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), the Gramm\u2013Leach\u2013Bliley Act (GLB), and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).\nUnlike the EU and most EU-member states, the US does not recognize the right to privacy of non-US citizens. The UN's Special Rapporteur on the right to privacy, Joseph A. Cannataci, criticized this distinction.\nConceptions of privacy.\nPrivacy as contextual integrity.\nThe theory of contextual integrity, developed by Helen Nissenbaum, defines privacy as an appropriate information flow, where appropriateness, in turn, is defined as conformance with legitimate, informational norms specific to social contexts.\nRight to be let alone.\nIn 1890, the United States jurists Samuel D. Warren and Louis Brandeis wrote \"The Right to Privacy\", an article in which they argued for the \"right to be let alone\", using that phrase as a definition of privacy. This concept relies on the theory of natural rights and focuses on protecting individuals. The citation was a response to recent technological developments, such as photography, and sensationalist journalism, also known as yellow journalism.\nThere is extensive commentary over the meaning of being \"let alone\", and among other ways, it has been interpreted to mean the right of a person to choose seclusion from the attention of others if they wish to do so, and the right to be immune from scrutiny or being observed in private settings, such as one's own home. Although this early vague legal concept did not describe privacy in a way that made it easy to design broad legal protections of privacy, it strengthened the notion of privacy rights for individuals and began a legacy of discussion on those rights in the US.\nLimited access.\nLimited access refers to a person's ability to participate in society without having other individuals and organizations collect information about them.\nVarious theorists have imagined privacy as a system for limiting access to one's personal information. Edwin Lawrence Godkin wrote in the late 19th century that \"nothing is better worthy of legal protection than private life, or, in other words, the right of every man to keep his affairs to himself, and to decide for himself to what extent they shall be the subject of public observation and discussion.\" Adopting an approach similar to the one presented by Ruth Gavison Nine years earlier, Sissela Bok said that privacy is \"the condition of being protected from unwanted access by others\u2014either physical access, personal information, or attention.\"\nControl over information.\nControl over one's personal information is the concept that \"privacy is the claim of individuals, groups, or institutions to determine for themselves when, how, and to what extent information about them is communicated to others.\" Generally, a person who has consensually formed an interpersonal relationship with another person is not considered \"protected\" by privacy rights with respect to the person they are in the relationship with. Charles Fried said that \"Privacy is not simply an absence of information about us in the minds of others; rather it is the control we have over information about ourselves.\" Nevertheless, in the era of big data, control over information is under pressure.\nStates of privacy.\nAlan Westin defined four states\u2014or experiences\u2014of privacy: solitude, intimacy, anonymity, and reserve. Solitude is a physical separation from others; Intimacy is a \"close, relaxed; and frank relationship between two or more individuals\" that results from the seclusion of a pair or small group of individuals. Anonymity is the \"desire of individuals for times of 'public privacy.'\" Lastly, reserve is the \"creation of a psychological barrier against unwanted intrusion\"; this creation of a psychological barrier requires others to respect an individual's need or desire to restrict communication of information concerning themself.\nIn addition to the psychological barrier of reserve, Kirsty Hughes identified three more kinds of privacy barriers: physical, behavioral, and normative. Physical barriers, such as walls and doors, prevent others from accessing and experiencing the individual. (In this sense, \"accessing\" an individual includes accessing personal information about them.) Behavioral barriers communicate to others\u2014verbally, through language, or non-verbally, through personal space, body language, or clothing\u2014that an individual does not want the other person to access or experience them. Lastly, normative barriers, such as laws and social norms, restrain others from attempting to access or experience an individual.\nPrivacy as personal control.\nPsychologist Carl A. Johnson has identified the psychological concept of \"personal control\" as closely tied to privacy. His concept was developed as a process containing four stages and two behavioural outcome relationships, with one's outcomes depending on situational as well as personal factors. Privacy is described as \"behaviors falling at specific locations on these two dimensions\".\nJohnson examined the following four stages to categorize where people exercise personal control: outcome choice control is the selection between various outcomes. Behaviour selection control is the selection between behavioural strategies to apply to attain selected outcomes. Outcome effectance describes the fulfillment of selected behaviour to achieve chosen outcomes. Outcome realization control is the personal interpretation of one's achieved outcome. The relationship between two factors\u2013 primary and secondary control, is defined as the two-dimensional phenomenon where one reaches personal control: primary control describes behaviour directly causing outcomes, while secondary control is behaviour indirectly causing outcomes. Johnson explores the concept that privacy is a behaviour that has secondary control over outcomes.\nLorenzo Magnani expands on this concept by highlighting how privacy is essential in maintaining personal control over one's identity and consciousness. He argues that consciousness is partly formed by external representations of ourselves, such as narratives and data, which are stored outside the body. However, much of our consciousness consists of internal representations that remain private and are rarely externalized. This internal privacy, which Magnani refers to as a form of \"information property\" or \"moral capital,\" is crucial for preserving free choice and personal agency. According to Magnani, when too much of our identity and data is externalized and subjected to scrutiny, it can lead to a loss of personal control, dignity, and responsibility. The protection of privacy, therefore, safeguards our ability to develop and pursue personal projects in our own way, free from intrusive external forces.\nAcknowledging other conceptions of privacy while arguing that the fundamental concern of privacy is behavior selection control, Johnson converses with other interpretations including those of Maxine Wolfe and Robert S. Laufer, and Irwin Altman. He clarifies the continuous relationship between privacy and personal control, where outlined behaviours not only depend on privacy, but the conception of one's privacy also depends on his defined behavioural outcome relationships.\nSecrecy.\nPrivacy is sometimes defined as an option to have secrecy. Richard Posner said that privacy is the right of people to \"conceal information about themselves that others might use to their disadvantage\".\nIn various legal contexts, when privacy is described as secrecy, a conclusion is reached: if privacy is secrecy, then rights to privacy do not apply for any information which is already publicly disclosed. When privacy-as-secrecy is discussed, it is usually imagined to be a selective kind of secrecy in which individuals keep some information secret and private while they choose to make other information public and not private.\nPersonhood and autonomy.\nPrivacy may be understood as a necessary precondition for the development and preservation of personhood. Jeffrey Reiman defined privacy in terms of a recognition of one's ownership of their physical and mental reality and a moral right to self-determination. Through the \"social ritual\" of privacy, or the social practice of respecting an individual's privacy barriers, the social group communicates to developing children that they have exclusive moral rights to their bodies\u2014in other words, moral ownership of their body. This entails control over both active (physical) and cognitive appropriation, the former being control over one's movements and actions and the latter being control over who can experience one's physical existence and when.\nAlternatively, Stanley Benn defined privacy in terms of a recognition of oneself as a subject with agency\u2014as an individual with the capacity to choose. Privacy is required to exercise choice. Overt observation makes the individual aware of himself or herself as an object with a \"determinate character\" and \"limited probabilities.\" Covert observation, on the other hand, changes the conditions in which the individual is exercising choice without their knowledge and consent.\nIn addition, privacy may be viewed as a state that enables autonomy, a concept closely connected to that of personhood. According to Joseph Kufer, an autonomous self-concept entails a conception of oneself as a \"purposeful, self-determining, responsible agent\" and an awareness of one's capacity to control the boundary between self and other\u2014that is, to control who can access and experience him or her and to what extent. Furthermore, others must acknowledge and respect the self's boundaries\u2014in other words, they must respect the individual's privacy.\nThe studies of psychologists such as Jean Piaget and Victor Tausk show that, as children learn that they can control who can access and experience them and to what extent, they develop an autonomous self-concept. In addition, studies of adults in particular institutions, such as Erving Goffman's study of \"total institutions\" such as prisons and mental institutions, suggest that systemic and routinized deprivations or violations of privacy deteriorate one's sense of autonomy over time.\nSelf-identity and personal growth.\nPrivacy may be understood as a prerequisite for the development of a sense of self-identity. Privacy barriers, in particular, are instrumental in this process. According to Irwin Altman, such barriers \"define and limit the boundaries of the self\" and thus \"serve to help define [the self].\" This control primarily entails the ability to regulate contact with others. Control over the \"permeability\" of the self's boundaries enables one to control what constitutes the self and thus to define what is the self.\nIn addition, privacy may be seen as a state that fosters personal growth, a process integral to the development of self-identity. Hyman Gross suggested that, without privacy\u2014solitude, anonymity, and temporary releases from social roles\u2014individuals would be unable to freely express themselves and to engage in self-discovery and self-criticism. Such self-discovery and self-criticism contributes to one's understanding of oneself and shapes one's sense of identity.\nIntimacy.\nIn a way analogous to how the personhood theory imagines privacy as some essential part of being an individual, the intimacy theory imagines privacy to be an essential part of the way that humans have strengthened or intimate relationships with other humans. Because part of human relationships includes individuals volunteering to self-disclose most if not all personal information, this is one area in which privacy does not apply.\nJames Rachels advanced this notion by writing that privacy matters because \"there is a close connection between our ability to control who has access to us and to information about us, and our ability to create and maintain different sorts of social relationships with different people.\" Protecting intimacy is at the core of the concept of sexual privacy, which law professor Danielle Citron argues should be protected as a unique form of privacy.\nPhysical privacy.\nPhysical privacy could be defined as preventing \"intrusions into one's physical space or solitude.\" An example of the legal basis for the right to physical privacy is the U.S. Fourth Amendment, which guarantees \"the right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures\".\nPhysical privacy may be a matter of cultural sensitivity, personal dignity, and/or shyness. There may also be concerns about safety, if, for example one is wary of becoming the victim of crime or stalking. There are different things that can be prevented to protect one's physical privacy, including people watching (even through recorded images) one's intimate behaviours or intimate parts and unauthorized access to one's personal possessions or places. Examples of possible efforts used to avoid the former, especially for modesty reasons, are clothes, walls, fences, privacy screens, cathedral glass, window coverings, etc.\nOrganizational.\nGovernment agencies, corporations, groups/societies and other organizations may desire to keep their activities or secrets from being revealed to other organizations or individuals, adopting various security practices and controls in order to keep private information confidential. Organizations may seek legal protection for their secrets. For example, a government administration may be able to invoke executive privilege or declare certain information to be classified, or a corporation might attempt to protect valuable proprietary information as trade secrets.\nPrivacy self-synchronization.\nPrivacy self-synchronization is a hypothesized mode by which the stakeholders of an enterprise privacy program spontaneously contribute collaboratively to the program's maximum success. The stakeholders may be customers, employees, managers, executives, suppliers, partners or investors. When self-synchronization is reached, the model states that the personal interests of individuals toward their privacy is in balance with the business interests of enterprises who collect and use the personal information of those individuals.\nAn individual right.\nDavid Flaherty believes networked computer databases pose threats to privacy. He develops 'data protection' as an aspect of privacy, which involves \"the collection, use, and dissemination of personal information\". This concept forms the foundation for fair information practices used by governments globally. Flaherty forwards an idea of privacy as information control, \"[i]ndividuals want to be left alone and to exercise some control over how information about them is used\".\nRichard Posner and Lawrence Lessig focus on the economic aspects of personal information control. Posner criticizes privacy for concealing information, which reduces market efficiency. For Posner, employment is selling oneself in the labour market, which he believes is like selling a product. Any 'defect' in the 'product' that is not reported is fraud. For Lessig, privacy breaches online can be regulated through code and law. Lessig claims \"the protection of privacy would be stronger if people conceived of the right as a property right\", and that \"individuals should be able to control information about themselves\".\nA collective value and a human right.\nThere have been attempts to establish privacy as one of the fundamental human rights, whose social value is an essential component in the functioning of democratic societies.\nPriscilla Regan believes that individual concepts of privacy have failed philosophically and in policy. She supports a social value of privacy with three dimensions: shared perceptions, public values, and collective components. Shared ideas about privacy allows freedom of conscience and diversity in thought. Public values guarantee democratic participation, including freedoms of speech and association, and limits government power. Collective elements describe privacy as collective good that cannot be divided. Regan's goal is to strengthen privacy claims in policy making: \"if we did recognize the collective or public-good value of privacy, as well as the common and public value of privacy, those advocating privacy protections would have a stronger basis upon which to argue for its protection\".\nLeslie Regan Shade argues that the human right to privacy is necessary for meaningful democratic participation, and ensures human dignity and autonomy. Privacy depends on norms for how information is distributed, and if this is appropriate. Violations of privacy depend on context. The human right to privacy has precedent in the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights: \"Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.\" Shade believes that privacy must be approached from a people-centered perspective, and not through the marketplace.\nDr. Eliza Watt, Westminster Law School, University of Westminster in London, UK, proposes application of the International Human Right Law (IHRL) concept of \"virtual control\" as an approach to deal with extraterritorial mass surveillance by state intelligence agencies. Dr. Watt envisions the \"virtual control\" test, understood as a remote control over the individual's right to privacy of communications, where privacy is recognized under the ICCPR, Article 17. This, she contends, may help to close the normative gap that is being exploited by nation states.\nPrivacy paradox and economic valuation.\nThe \"privacy paradox\" is a phenomenon in which online users state that they are concerned about their privacy but behave as if they were not. While this term was coined as early as 1998, it was not used in its current popular sense until the year 2000.\nSusan B. Barnes similarly used the term \"privacy paradox\" to refer to the ambiguous boundary between private and public space on social media. When compared to adults, young people tend to disclose more information on social media. However, this does not mean that they are not concerned about their privacy. Susan B. Barnes gave a case in her article: in a television interview about Facebook, a student addressed her concerns about disclosing personal information online. However, when the reporter asked to see her Facebook page, she put her home address, phone numbers, and pictures of her young son on the page.\nThe privacy paradox has been studied and scripted in different research settings. Several studies have shown this inconsistency between privacy attitudes and behavior among online users. However, by now an increasing number of studies have also shown that there are significant and at times large correlations between privacy concerns and information sharing behavior, which speaks against the privacy paradox. A meta-analysis of 166 studies published on the topic reported an overall small but significant relation between privacy concerns and informations sharing or use of privacy protection measures. So although there are several individual instances or anecdotes where behavior appear paradoxical, on average privacy concerns and privacy behaviors seem to be related, and several findings question the general existence of the privacy paradox.\nHowever, the relationship between concerns and behavior is likely only small, and there are several arguments that can explain why that is the case. According to the attitude-behavior gap, attitudes and behaviors are \"in general\" and in most cases not closely related. A main explanation for the partial mismatch in the context of privacy specifically is that users lack awareness of the risks and the degree of protection. Users may underestimate the harm of disclosing information online. On the other hand, some researchers argue that the mismatch comes from lack of technology literacy and from the design of sites. For example, users may not know how to change their default settings even though they care about their privacy. Psychologists Sonja Utz and Nicole C. Kr\u00e4mer particularly pointed out that the privacy paradox can occur when users must trade-off between their privacy concerns and impression management.\nResearch on irrational decision making.\nA study conducted by Susanne Barth and Menno D.T. de Jo demonstrates that decision making takes place on an irrational level, especially when it comes to mobile computing. Mobile applications in particular are often built up in such a way that spurs decision making that is fast and automatic without assessing risk factors. Protection measures against these unconscious mechanisms are often difficult to access while downloading and installing apps. Even with mechanisms in place to protect user privacy, users may not have the knowledge or experience to enable these mechanisms.\nUsers of mobile applications generally have very little knowledge of how their personal data are used. When they decide which application to download, they typically are not able to effectively interpret the information provided by application vendors regarding the collection and use of personal data. Other research finds that this lack of interpretability means users are much more likely to be swayed by cost, functionality, design, ratings, reviews and number of downloads than requested permissions for usage of their personal data.\nThe economic valuation of privacy.\nThe willingness to incur a privacy risk is suspected to be driven by a complex array of factors including risk attitudes, personal value for private information, and general attitudes to privacy (which are typically measured using surveys). One experiment aiming to determine the monetary value of several types of personal information indicated relatively low evaluations of personal information. Providing personal data does not only regard monetary value, but also increased ease of use in voluntary interactions in government processes. Despite claims that ascertaining the value of data requires a \"stock-market for personal information\", surveillance capitalism and the mass surveillance industry regularly place price tags on this form of data as it is shared between corporations and governments.\nInformation asymmetry.\nUsers are not always given the tools to live up to their professed privacy concerns, and they are sometimes willing to trade private information for convenience, functionality, or financial gain, even when the gains are very small. One study suggests that people think their browser history is worth the equivalent of a cheap meal. Another finds that attitudes to privacy risk do not appear to depend on whether it is already under threat or not. The methodology of user empowerment describes how to provide users with sufficient context to make privacy-informed decisions.\nInherent necessity for privacy violation.\nIt is suggested by Andr\u00e9a Belliger and David J. Krieger that the privacy paradox should not be considered a paradox, but more of a \"privacy dilemma\", for services that cannot exist without the user sharing private data. However, the general public is typically not given the choice whether to share private data or not, making it difficult to verify any claim that a service truly cannot exist without sharing private data.\nPrivacy calculus model.\nThe privacy calculus model posits that two factors determine privacy behavior, namely privacy concerns (or perceived risks) and expected benefits. By now, the privacy calculus has been supported by several studies.\nActions which reduce privacy.\nAs with other conceptions of privacy, there are various ways to discuss what kinds of processes or actions remove, challenge, lessen, or attack privacy. In 1960 legal scholar William Prosser created the following list of activities which can be remedied with privacy protection:\nFrom 2004 to 2008, building from this and other historical precedents, Daniel J. Solove presented another classification of actions which are harmful to privacy, including collection of information which is already somewhat public, processing of information, sharing information, and invading personal space to get private information.\nCollecting information.\nIn the context of harming privacy, information collection means gathering whatever information can be obtained by doing something to obtain it. Examples include surveillance and interrogation. Another example is how consumers and marketers also collect information in the business context through facial recognition which has recently caused a concern for things such as privacy. There is currently research being done related to this topic.\nCompanies like Google and Meta collect vast amounts of personal data from their users through various services and platforms. This data includes browsing habits, search history, location information, and even personal communications. These companies then analyze and aggregate this data to create detailed user profiles, which are sold to advertisers and other third parties. This practice is often done without explicit user consent, leading to an invasion of privacy as individuals have little control over how their information is used. The sale of personal data can result in targeted advertising, manipulation, and even potential security risks, as sensitive information can be exploited by malicious actors. This commercial exploitation of personal data undermines user trust and raises significant ethical and legal concerns regarding data protection and privacy rights.\nAggregating information.\nIt can happen that privacy is not harmed when information is available, but that the harm can come when that information is collected as a set, then processed together in such a way that the collective reporting of pieces of information encroaches on privacy. Actions in this category which can lessen privacy include the following:\nInformation dissemination.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Count not him among your friends who will retail your privacies to the world.\u2014\u200a\nInformation dissemination is an attack on privacy when information which was shared in confidence is shared or threatened to be shared in a way that harms the subject of the information.\nThere are various examples of this. Breach of confidentiality is when one entity promises to keep a person's information private, then breaks that promise. Disclosure is making information about a person more accessible in a way that harms the subject of the information, regardless of how the information was collected or the intent of making it available. Exposure is a special type of disclosure in which the information disclosed is emotional to the subject or taboo to share, such as revealing their private life experiences, their nudity, or perhaps private body functions. Increased accessibility means advertising the availability of information without actually distributing it, as in the case of doxing. Blackmail is making a threat to share information, perhaps as part of an effort to coerce someone. Appropriation is an attack on the personhood of someone, and can include using the value of someone's reputation or likeness to advance interests which are not those of the person being appropriated. Distortion is the creation of misleading information or lies about a person.\nInvasion.\nInvasion of privacy, a subset of expectation of privacy, is a different concept from the collecting, aggregating, and disseminating information because those three are a misuse of available data, whereas invasion is an attack on the right of individuals to keep personal secrets. An invasion is an attack in which information, whether intended to be public or not, is captured in a way that insults the personal dignity and right to private space of the person whose data is taken.\nIntrusion.\nAn \"intrusion\" is any unwanted entry into a person's private personal space and solitude for any reason, regardless of whether data is taken during that breach of space. \"Decisional interference\" is when an entity somehow injects itself into the personal decision-making process of another person, perhaps to influence that person's private decisions but in any case doing so in a way that disrupts the private personal thoughts that a person has.\nTechniques to improve privacy.\nSimilarly to actions which reduce privacy, there are multiple angles of privacy and multiple techniques to improve them to varying extents. When actions are done at an organizational level, they may be referred to as cybersecurity.\nEncryption.\nIndividuals can encrypt e-mails via enabling either two encryption protocols, S/MIME, which is built into companies like Apple or Outlook and thus most common, or PGP. The Signal messaging app, which encrypts messages so that only the recipient can read the message, is notable for being available on many mobile devices and implementing a form of perfect forward secrecy. Signal has received praise from whistleblower Edward Snowden. Encryption and other privacy-based security measures are also used in some cryptocurrencies such as Monero and ZCash.\nAnonymity.\nAnonymizing proxies or anonymizing networks like I2P and Tor can be used to prevent Internet service providers (ISP) from knowing which sites one visits and with whom one communicates, by hiding IP addresses and location, but does not necessarily protect a user from third party data mining. Anonymizing proxies are built into a user's device, in comparison to a Virtual Private Network (VPN), where users must download software. Using a VPN hides all data and connections that are exchanged between servers and a user's computer, resulting in the online data of the user being unshared and secure, providing a barrier between the user and their ISP, and is especially important to use when a user is connected to public Wi-Fi. However, users should understand that all their data does flow through the VPN's servers rather than the ISP. Users should decide for themselves if they wish to use either an anonymizing proxy or a VPN.\nIn a more non-technical sense, using incognito mode or private browsing mode will prevent a user's computer from saving history, Internet files, and cookies, but the ISP will still have access to the users' search history. Using anonymous search engines will not share a user's history, clicks, and will obstruct ad blockers.\nUser empowerment.\nConcrete solutions on how to solve paradoxical behavior still do not exist. Many efforts are focused on processes of decision making, like restricting data access permissions during application installation, but this would not completely bridge the gap between user intention and behavior. Susanne Barth and Menno D.T. de Jong believe that for users to make more conscious decisions on privacy matters, the design needs to be more user-oriented. That being said, delivering on privacy protections is difficult due to the complexity of online consent processes, for example.\nOther security measures.\nIn a social sense, simply limiting the amount of personal information that users posts on social media could increase their security, which in turn makes it harder for criminals to perform identity theft. Moreover, creating a set of complex passwords and using two-factor authentication can allow users to be less susceptible to their accounts being compromised when various data leaks occur. Furthermore, users should protect their digital privacy by using anti-virus software, which can block harmful viruses like a pop-up scanning for personal information on a users' computer.\nLegal methods.\nAlthough there are laws that promote the protection of users, in some countries, like the U.S., there is no federal digital privacy law and privacy settings are essentially limited by the state of current enacted privacy laws. To further their privacy, users can start conversing with representatives, letting representatives know that privacy is a main concern, which in turn increases the likelihood of further privacy laws being enacted.\nPrivacy in non-human animals.\nDavid Attenborough, a biologist and natural historian, affirmed that gorillas \"value their privacy\" while discussing a brief escape by a gorilla in London Zoo.\nLack of privacy in public spaces, caused by overcrowding, increases health issues in animals, including heart disease and high blood pressure. Also, the stress from overcrowding is connected to an increase in infant mortality rates and maternal stress. The lack of privacy that comes with overcrowding is connected to other issues in animals, which causes their relationships with others to diminish. How they present themselves to others of their species is a necessity in their life, and overcrowding causes the relationships to become disordered.\nFor example, David Attenborough claims that the gorilla's right to privacy is being violated when they are looked at through glass enclosures. They are aware that they are being looked at, therefore they do not have control over how much the onlookers can see of them. Gorillas and other animals may be in the enclosures due to safety reasons, however Attenborough states that this is not an excuse for them to be constantly watched by unnecessary eyes. Also, animals will start hiding in unobserved spaces. Animals in zoos have been found to exhibit harmful or different behaviours due to the presence of visitors watching them:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It dominates in stars with masses less than or equal to that of the Sun, whereas the CNO cycle, the other known reaction, is suggested by theoretical models to dominate in stars with masses greater than about 1.3\u00a0solar masses.\nIn general, proton\u2013proton fusion can occur only if the kinetic energy (temperature) of the protons is high enough to overcome their mutual electrostatic repulsion.\nIn the Sun, deuteron-producing events are rare. Diprotons are the much more common result of proton\u2013proton reactions within the star, and diprotons almost immediately decay back into two protons. Since the conversion of hydrogen to helium is slow, the complete conversion of the hydrogen initially in the core of the Sun is calculated to take more than ten billion years.\nAlthough sometimes called the \"proton\u2013proton chain reaction\", it is not a chain reaction in the normal sense. In most nuclear reactions, a chain reaction designates a reaction that produces a product, such as neutrons given off during fission, that quickly induces another such reaction. \nThe proton\u2013proton chain is, like a decay chain, a series of reactions. The product of one reaction is the starting material of the next reaction. There are two main chains leading from hydrogen to helium in the Sun. One chain has five reactions, the other chain has six.\nHistory of the theory.\nThe theory that proton\u2013proton reactions are the basic principle by which the Sun and other stars burn was advocated by Arthur Eddington in the 1920s. At the time, the temperature of the Sun was considered to be too low to overcome the Coulomb barrier. After the development of quantum mechanics, it was discovered that tunneling of the wavefunctions of the protons through the repulsive barrier allows for fusion at a lower temperature than the classical prediction.\nIn 1939, Hans Bethe attempted to calculate the rates of various reactions in stars. Starting with two protons combining to give a deuterium nucleus and a positron he found what we now call Branch II of the proton\u2013proton chain. But he did not consider the reaction of two 3He nuclei (Branch I) which we now know to be important. This was part of the body of work in stellar nucleosynthesis for which Bethe won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1967.\nThe proton\u2013proton chain.\nThe first step in all the branches is the fusion of two protons into a deuteron. As the protons fuse, one of them undergoes beta plus decay, converting into a neutron by emitting a positron and an electron neutrino (though a small amount of deuterium nuclei is produced by the \"pep\" reaction, see below):\nThe positron will annihilate with an electron from the environment into two gamma rays. Including this annihilation and the energy of the neutrino, the net reaction\nhas a \"Q\" value (released energy) of 1.442 MeV:\nThe relative amounts of energy going to the neutrino and to the other products is variable.\nThis is the rate-limiting reaction and is extremely slow due to it being initiated by the weak nuclear force. The average proton in the core of the Sun waits 9 billion years before it successfully fuses with another proton. It has not been possible to measure the cross-section of this reaction experimentally because it is so low but it can be calculated from theory.\nAfter it is formed, the deuteron produced in the first stage can fuse with another proton to produce the stable, light isotope of helium, [&lt;noinclude /&gt;[helium-3|He]&lt;noinclude /&gt;]:\nThis process, mediated by the strong nuclear force rather than the weak force, is extremely fast by comparison to the first step. It is estimated that, under the conditions in the Sun's core, each newly created deuterium nucleus exists for only about one second before it is converted into helium-3.\nIn the Sun, each helium-3 nucleus produced in these reactions exists for only about 400 years before it is converted into helium-4. Once the helium-3 has been produced, there are four possible paths to generate [&lt;noinclude /&gt;[helium-4|He]&lt;noinclude /&gt;]. In p\u2013p I, helium-4 is produced by fusing two helium-3 nuclei into beryllium-6, which immediately emits two protons to become helium-4. The p\u2013p II and p\u2013p III branches fuse He with pre-existing He to form beryllium-7, which undergoes further reactions to produce two helium-4 nuclei.\nAbout 99% of the energy output of the sun comes from the various p\u2013p chains, with the other 1% coming from the CNO cycle. According to one model of the sun, 83.3 percent of the [&lt;noinclude /&gt;[helium-4|He]&lt;noinclude /&gt;] produced by the various p\u2013p branches is produced via branch I while p\u2013p II produces 16.68 percent and p\u2013p III 0.02 percent. Since half the neutrinos produced in branches II and III are produced in the first step (synthesis of a deuteron), only about 8.35 percent of neutrinos come from the later steps (see below), and about 91.65 percent are from deuteron synthesis. However, another solar model from around the same time gives only 7.14 percent of neutrinos from the later steps and 92.86 percent from the synthesis of deuterium nuclei. The difference is apparently due to slightly different assumptions about the composition and metallicity of the sun.\nThere is also the extremely rare p\u2013p IV branch. Other even rarer reactions may occur. The rate of these reactions is very low due to very small cross-sections, or because the number of reacting particles is so low that any reactions that might happen are statistically insignificant.\nThe overall reaction is:\n4 1H+ + 2 e- \u2192 4He2+ + 2 \u03bde\nreleasing 26.73 MeV of energy, some of which is lost to the neutrinos.\nThe p\u2013p I branch.\nThe fusion of two He nuclei produces a Be nucleus, which promptly ejects two protons.

The difference is whether the lithium-7 produced is in the ground state or an excited (metastable) state, respectively. The total energy released going from 7Be to stable 7Li is about 0.862\u00a0MeV, almost all of which is lost to the neutrino if the decay goes directly to the stable lithium.\nThe p\u2013p III branch.\nThe last three stages of this chain, plus the positron annihilation, contribute a total of 18.209\u00a0MeV, though much of this is lost to the neutrino.\nThe p\u2013p III chain is dominant if the temperature exceeds .\nThe p\u2013p III chain is not a major source of energy in the Sun, but it was very important in the solar neutrino problem because it generates very high energy neutrinos (up to ).\nThe p\u2013p IV (Hep) branch.\nThis reaction is predicted theoretically, but it has never been observed due to its rarity (about in the Sun). In this reaction, helium-3 captures a proton directly to give helium-4, with an even higher possible neutrino energy (up to ).\nThe mass\u2013energy relationship gives for the energy released by this reaction plus the ensuing annihilation, some of which is lost to the neutrino.\nEnergy release.\nComparing the mass of the final helium-4 nucleus with the masses of the four protons reveals that 0.7 percent of the mass of the original protons has been lost. This mass has been converted into energy, in the form of kinetic energy of produced particles, gamma rays, and neutrinos released during each of the individual reactions. The total energy yield of one whole chain is .\nEnergy released as gamma rays will interact with electrons and protons and heat the interior of the Sun. Also kinetic energy of fusion products (e.g. of the two protons and the [&lt;noinclude /&gt;[helium-4|He]&lt;noinclude /&gt;] from the p\u2013p I reaction) adds energy to the plasma in the Sun. This heating keeps the core of the Sun hot and prevents it from collapsing under its own weight as it would if the sun were to cool down.\nNeutrinos do not interact significantly with matter and therefore do not heat the interior and thereby help support the Sun against gravitational collapse. Their energy is lost: the neutrinos in the p\u2013p I, p\u2013p II, and p\u2013p III chains carry away 2.0%, 4.0%, and 28.3% of the energy in those reactions, respectively.\nThe following table calculates the amount of energy lost to neutrinos and the amount of \"solar luminosity\" coming from the three branches. \"Luminosity\" here means the amount of energy given off by the Sun as electromagnetic radiation rather than as neutrinos. The starting figures used are the ones mentioned higher in this article. The table concerns only the 99% of the power and neutrinos that come from the p\u2013p reactions, not the 1% coming from the CNO cycle.\nThe PEP reaction.\nA deuteron can also be produced by the rare pep (proton\u2013electron\u2013proton) reaction (electron capture):\nIn the Sun, the frequency ratio of the pep reaction versus the p\u2013p reaction is 1:400. However, the neutrinos released by the pep reaction are far more energetic: while neutrinos produced in the first step of the p\u2013p reaction range in energy up to , the pep reaction produces sharp-energy-line neutrinos of . Detection of solar neutrinos from this reaction were reported by the Borexino collaboration in 2012.\nBoth the pep and p\u2013p reactions can be seen as two different Feynman representations of the same basic interaction, where the electron passes to the right side of the reaction as a positron.

Marine plankton include drifting organisms that inhabit the saltwater of oceans and the brackish waters of estuaries. Freshwater plankton are similar to marine plankton, but are found in lakes and rivers. An individual plankton organism in the plankton is called a plankter. In the ocean plankton provide a crucial source of food, particularly for larger filter-feeding animals, such as bivalves, sponges, forage fish and baleen whales.\nPlankton includes organisms from species across all the major biological kingdoms, ranging in size from the microscopic (such as bacteria, archaea, protozoa and microscopic algae and fungi) to larger organisms (such as jellyfish and ctenophores). This is because plankton are defined by their ecological niche and level of motility rather than by any phylogenetic or taxonomic classification. The plankton category differentiates organisms from those that can swim against a current, called \"nekton\", and those that live on the deep sea floor, called \"benthos\". Organisms that float on or near the water's surface are called \"neuston\". Neuston that drift as water currents or wind take them, and lack the swimming ability to counter this, form a special subgroup of plankton. Mostly plankton just drift where currents take them, though some, like jellyfish, swim slowly but not fast enough to generally overcome the influence of currents.\nMicroscopic plankton, smaller than about one millimetre in size, play crucial roles in marine ecosystems. They are a diverse group, including phytoplankton (like diatoms and dinoflagellates) and zooplankton (such as radiolarians, foraminifera and some copepods), and serve as a foundational component of the marine food web. These largely unseen microscopic plankton drive primary production, support local food webs, cycle nutrients, and influence global biogeochemical processes. Their role is foundational for maintaining the health and balance of marine ecosystems.\nAlthough plankton are usually thought of as inhabiting water, there are also airborne versions that live part of their lives drifting in the atmosphere. These \"aeroplankton\" can include plant spores, pollen and wind-scattered seeds. They can also include microorganisms swept into the air from terrestrial dust storms and oceanic plankton swept into the air by sea spray.\nOverview.\nApart from aeroplankton, plankton inhabits oceans, seas, estuaries, rivers, lakes and ponds. Local abundance varies horizontally, vertically and seasonally. The primary cause of this variability is the availability of light. All plankton ecosystems are driven by the input of solar energy (but see chemosynthesis), confining primary production to surface waters, and to geographical regions and seasons having abundant light.\nA secondary variable is nutrient availability. The amount and distribution of plankton depends on available nutrients, the state of water and a large amount of other plankton. The local distribution of plankton can be affected by wind-driven Langmuir circulation and the biological effects of this physical process. Although large areas of the tropical and sub-tropical oceans have abundant light, they experience relatively low primary production because they offer limited nutrients such as nitrate, phosphate and silicate. This results from large-scale ocean circulation and water column stratification. In such regions, primary production usually occurs at greater depth, although at a reduced level (because of reduced light).\nWhile plankton are most abundant in surface waters, they live throughout the water column. At depths where no primary production occurs, zooplankton and bacterioplankton instead consume organic material sinking from more productive surface waters above. This flux of sinking material, so-called marine snow, can be especially high following the termination of spring blooms.\nDespite significant macronutrient concentrations, some ocean regions are unproductive (so-called HNLC regions). The micronutrient iron is deficient in these regions, and adding it can lead to the formation of phytoplankton algal blooms. Iron primarily reaches the ocean through the deposition of dust on the sea surface. Paradoxically, oceanic areas adjacent to unproductive, arid land thus typically have abundant phytoplankton (e.g., the eastern Atlantic Ocean, where trade winds bring dust from the Sahara Desert in north Africa).\nWithin the plankton, holoplankton spend their entire life cycle as plankton (e.g. most algae, copepods, salps, and some jellyfish). By contrast, meroplankton are only planktic for part of their lives (usually the larval stage), and then graduate to either a nektic (swimming) or benthic (sea floor) existence. Examples of meroplankton include the larvae of sea urchins, starfish, crustaceans, marine worms, and most fish.\nMicroscopic plankton.\nPlankton is mostly made up of planktonic microorganisms less than one millimetre across, most visible only through a microscope. Microorganisms have been variously estimated to make up about 70%, or about 90%, of the total ocean biomass. Taken together they form the marine microbiome. Over billions of years this microbiome has evolved many life styles and adaptations and come to participate in the global cycling of almost all chemical elements. \nMicroplankton are ecological linchpins in the marine food web. They are crucial to nutrient recycling in the way they act as decomposers. They are also responsible for nearly all photosynthesis that occurs in the ocean, as well as the cycling of carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus and other nutrients and trace elements. Microplankton sequesters large amounts of carbon and produce much of the world's oxygen.\nIt is estimated marine viruses kill 20% of ocean microplankton biomass every day. Viruses are the main agents responsible for the rapid destruction of harmful algal blooms which often kill other marine life. The number of viruses in the plankton decreases further offshore and deeper into the water, where there are fewer host organisms.\nTerminology.\nThe name \"plankton\" was coined by German marine biologist Victor Hensen in 1887 from shortening the word \"halyplankton\" from Greek \"h\u00e1ls\" \"sea\" and \"plan\u00e1omai\" \"(I) drift\" or \"(I) wander\". Some forms of plankton are capable of independent vertically movement, and can swim hundreds of meters vertically in a single day (a behavior called diel vertical migration). However their horizontal position is primarily determined by the surrounding water movement, so plankton typically flow with the ocean currents. This is in contrast to nekton organisms, such as fish, squid and marine mammals, which can swim against the ambient flow and control their position in the environment.\nThe study of plankton is termed planktology and a planktonic individual is referred to as a plankter. The adjective \"planktonic\" is widely used in both the scientific and popular literature, and is a generally accepted term. However, from the standpoint of prescriptive grammar, the less-commonly used \"planktic\" is more strictly the correct adjective. When deriving English words from their Greek or Latin roots, the gender-specific ending (in this case, \"-on\" which indicates the word is neuter) is normally dropped, using only the root of the word in the derivation.\nBy habitat.\nAeroplankton.\nAeroplankton are tiny lifeforms that float and drift in the air, carried by the current of the wind; they are the atmospheric analogue to oceanic plankton. Most of the living things that make up aeroplankton are very small to microscopic in size, and many can be difficult to identify because of their tiny size. Scientists can collect them for study in traps and sweep nets from aircraft, kites or balloons. Aeroplankton is made up of numerous microbes, including viruses, about 1000 different species of bacteria, around 40,000 varieties of fungi, and hundreds of species of protists, algae, mosses and liverworts that live some part of their life cycle as aeroplankton, often as spores, pollen, and wind-scattered seeds. Additionally, peripatetic microorganisms are swept into the air from terrestrial dust storms, and an even larger amount of airborne marine microorganisms are propelled high into the atmosphere in sea spray. Aeroplankton deposits hundreds of millions of airborne viruses and tens of millions of bacteria every day on every square meter around the planet. This means similar mixes of microscopic plankton taxon can be found in open bodies of water around the world.\nThe sea surface microlayer, compared to the sub-surface waters, contains elevated concentration of bacteria and viruses. These materials can be transferred from the sea-surface to the atmosphere in the form of wind-generated aqueous aerosols due to their high vapour tension and a process known as volatilisation. When airborne, these microbes can be transported long distances to coastal regions. If they hit land they can have an effect on animal, vegetation and human health. Marine aerosols that contain viruses can travel hundreds of kilometers from their source and remain in liquid form as long as the humidity is high enough (over 70%). These aerosols are able to remain suspended in the atmosphere for about 31 days. Evidence suggests that bacteria can remain viable after being transported inland through aerosols. Some reached as far as 200 meters at 30 meters above sea level. The process which transfers this material to the atmosphere causes further enrichment in both bacteria and viruses in comparison to either the SML or sub-surface waters (up to three orders of magnitude in some locations).\nFreshwater plankton.\nFreshwater plankton parallel marine plankton (below), but are found inland in the freshwaters of lakes and rivers.\nGeoplankton.\nMany animals live in terrestrial environments by thriving in transient often microscopic bodies of water and moisture, these include rotifers and gastrotrichs which lay resilient eggs capable of surviving years in dry environments, and some of which can go dormant themselves. Nematodes are usually microscopic with this lifestyle. Water bears, despite only having lifespans of a few months, famously can enter suspended animation during dry or hostile conditions and survive for decades. This allows them to be ubiquitous in terrestrial environments despite needing water to grow and reproduce. Many microscopic crustacean groups like copepods and amphipods (of which sandhoppers are members) and seed shrimp are known to go dormant when dry and live in transient bodies of water too\nMarine plankton.\nMarine plankton includes marine protists (algae and protozoa), drifting and floating animals (particularly microanimals), marine prokaryotes (bacteria and archaea), and marine viruses that inhabit the saltwater of oceans and the brackish waters of estuaries.\nAt the ocean surface.\nPlankton are also found at the ocean surface. Organisms that live at or just below the air-sea interface are called neuston. They float either on the water's surface (epineuston) or swim in the top few centimeters (hyponeuston). Many neuston qualify to be categorised as part of the broader plankton community, because they drift largely as currents or wind dictate, lacking strong enough swimming ability to counter them.\nNeustonic animals are primarily adapted to float upside-down on the ocean surface, similar to an inverted benthos, and form a unique subset of the zooplankton community, which plays a pivotal role in the functioning of marine ecosystems. Neustonic zooplankton are partially responsible for the active energy flux between superficial and deep layers of the ocean.Neustonic plankton is also a food source for marine zooplankton and fish migrating from the deep layers and seabirds.\nIn deep ocean.\nIn 2025, researchers discovered microbial communities inhabiting the ocean conveyor belt, even at great depths in the ocean. Ocean currents are generated by surface wind and storms down to about below the surface. But the average depth of the ocean goes far below to . At these greater depths, currents are driven by differences in water density, which in turn are controlled by differences in water temperature and salinity. This mechanism results in a circulation which behaves like a conveyor belt, carrying water and microorganisms to great depths and around the world.\nWater samples were taken along the full depth of the water column in the South Pacific Ocean, from Easter Island to Antarctica. They found marked increases in microbial diversity about deep, in a layer they call the \"prokaryotic phylocline\". This zone, similar to the pycnocline, represents a shift from less diverse surface waters to abundant microbial ecosystems in the deep ocean. For instance, a group they called the \"Antarctic Bottom Water\" contains microbes suited to cold and high pressure, while another group they called the \"Ancient Water Group\", located in slowly circulating water isolated from the surface for over a millennium, contains microbes with genes adapted to low oxygen.\nBy taxon.\nPlankton contains representatives from all major divisions of life. By taxon, it can be divided into the following broad groups:\nBy size.\nPlankton are also often described in terms of size. Usually the following divisions are used:\u200a\n \nHowever, some of these terms may be used with very different boundaries, especially on the larger end. The term \"microplankton\" is sometimes used more broadly to cover plankton that cannot really be seen without using a microscope, say plankton less than about one millimetre across. The existence and importance of nano- and even smaller plankton was only discovered during the 1980s, but they are thought to make up the largest proportion of all plankton in number and diversity. It is the largely unseen microplankton that are the main drivers of the marine food web.\nMicroplankton and smaller groups are microorganisms that operate at low Reynolds numbers, where the viscosity of water is more important than its mass or inertia.\nBy trophic mode.\nTrophic mode describes the role of a planktonic organism in the food web based on how it obtains energy and nutrients to sustain its growth, reproduction, and survival. By trophic mode, plankton can be divided into four broad functional groups: phytoplankton, zooplankton, mixoplankton and decomposers.\nPhytoplankton.\nPhytoplankton (from Greek \"phyton\", or plant) are autotrophic prokaryotic or eukaryotic algae that live near the water surface where there is sufficient light to support photosynthesis. Among the more important groups are the diatoms, cyanobacteria, dinoflagellates, and coccolithophores.\nZooplankton.\nZooplankton (from Greek \"zoon\", or animal) are small protozoans or metazoans (e.g. crustaceans and other animals) that feed on other plankton. Some of the eggs and larvae of larger nektonic animals, such as fish, crustaceans, and annelids, are included here.\nMixoplankton.\nMixoplankton (from Greek \"mixis\", or mixture) have a mixed trophic strategy. In recent years, there has been a growing recognition that perhaps the majority of plankton can act in both the above modes.\nTraditionally, plankton were divided into just the first two broad trophic groups: plant-like phytoplankton which make their own food, usually by photosynthesis, and animal-like zooplankton that eat other plankton. In recent years, there has been a recognition that many plankton, perhaps over half, are mixotrophic. Plankton have traditionally been categorized as producer, consumer, and recycler groups, but some plankton are able to benefit from more than just one trophic level. This mixed trophic strategy means mixoplankton can act as both producers and consumers, either at the same time or switching between modes of nutrition in response to ambient conditions. In this manner, mixoplankton can use photosynthesis for growth when nutrients and light are abundant, but switch to eating phytoplankton, zooplankton or each other when growing conditions are poor. \nAs a result of these findings, many plankton formally categorized as phytoplankton, including coccolithophores and dinoflagellates, are longer included as strictly phytoplankton, as they not only produce their own food through phototrophy but can also eat other organisms. These organisms are now more correctly termed mixoplankton. This recognition has important consequences for how the functioning of the planktonic food web is viewed.\nMixotrophs can be further divided into two groups; constitutive mixotrophs which are able to perform photosynthesis on their own, and non-constitutive mixotrophs which use phagocytosis to engulf phototrophic prey that are either kept alive inside the host cell, which benefits from its photosynthesis, or they digested, except for the plastids, which continue to perform photosynthesis (kleptoplasty). Recognition of the importance of mixotrophy as an ecological strategy is increasing, as well as the wider role this may play in marine biogeochemistry. Studies have shown that mixoplankton are much more important for marine ecology than previously assumed. Their presence acts as a buffer that prevents the collapse of ecosystems during times with little to no light. Mixoplankton have ancient origins and have been recognized by scientists for over a century. However, it is only in recent years that the widespread significance of mixoplankton has been gaining recognition in mainstream marine science.\nDecomposers.\nInstead of directly building biomass, decomposers break organic nutrients down into inorganic forms which can be recycled (an approach which metabolically can be costly).\nFungi: Mostly tiny mycoplankton (microfungi), yeast, or mobile zoospores, that can recycle organic matter through a process called the mycoloop which involves parasiting plankton.\nBacteria/Archaea: These minute prokaryotes (typically &lt;0.001mm) return organic nutrients to inorganic forms by breaking down particulate and dissolved organic matter through the process called the microbial loop. Some convert ammonium in animal waste to nitrate, while others transform nitrate to nitrogen gas. Viral infections likely destroy many, while others are eaten by protist zooplankton and mixoplankton, which use their nutrients for photosynthesis. However details of their ecology is complex and it is not clear what sustains them.\nViruses: Typically 10 to 100 times smaller than bacteria and also the most abundant (~100 billion per litre), viruses infect other plankton and larger organisms. It is thought they efficiently halt vast plankton blooms within days, by turning biomass into dissolved organic matter that supports bacterial growth through a process called the viral shunt. Being host-specific, they also likely influence the biological and microbial carbon pumps.\nOther groups.\nGelatinous zooplankton.\nGelatinous zooplankton are fragile animals that live in the water column in the ocean. Their delicate bodies have no hard parts and are easily damaged or destroyed. Gelatinous zooplankton are often transparent. All jellyfish are gelatinous zooplankton, but not all gelatinous zooplankton are jellyfish. The most commonly encountered organisms include ctenophores, medusae, salps, and Chaetognatha in coastal waters. However, almost all marine phyla, including Annelida, Mollusca and Arthropoda, contain gelatinous species, but many of those odd species live in the open ocean and the deep sea and are less available to the casual ocean observer.\nIchthyoplankton.\nIchthyoplankton are the eggs and larvae of fish. They are mostly found in the sunlit zone of the water column, less than 200 metres deep, which is sometimes called the epipelagic or photic zone. Ichthyoplankton are planktonic, meaning they cannot swim effectively under their own power, but must drift with the ocean currents. Fish eggs cannot swim at all, and are unambiguously planktonic. Early stage larvae swim poorly, but later stage larvae swim better and cease to be planktonic as they grow into juveniles. Fish larvae are part of the zooplankton that eat smaller plankton, while fish eggs carry their own food supply. Both eggs and larvae are themselves eaten by larger animals. Fish can produce high numbers of eggs which are often released into the open water column. Fish eggs typically have a diameter of about . The newly hatched young of oviparous fish are called larvae. They are usually poorly formed, carry a large yolk sac (for nourishment), and are very different in appearance from juvenile and adult specimens. The larval period in oviparous fish is relatively short (usually only several weeks), and larvae rapidly grow and change appearance and structure (a process termed metamorphosis) to become juveniles. During this transition larvae must switch from their yolk sac to feeding on zooplankton prey, a process which depends on typically inadequate zooplankton density, starving many larvae. In time fish larvae become able to swim against currents, at which point they cease to be plankton and become juvenile fish.\nPseudoplankton.\nPseudoplankton are organisms that attach themselves to planktonic organisms or other floating objects, such as drifting wood, buoyant shells of organisms such as \"Spirula\", or man-made flotsam. Examples include goose barnacles and the bryozoan \"Jellyella\". By themselves these animals cannot float, which contrasts them with true planktonic organisms, such as \"Velella\" and the Portuguese Man o' War, which are buoyant. Pseudoplankton are often found in the guts of filtering zooplankters.\nTychoplankton.\nTychoplankton are organisms, such as free-living or attached benthic organisms and other non-planktonic organisms, that are carried into the plankton through a disturbance of their benthic habitat, or by winds and currents. This can occur by direct turbulence or by disruption of the substrate and subsequent entrainment in the water column. Tychoplankton are, therefore, a primary subdivision for sorting planktonic organisms by duration of lifecycle spent in the plankton, as neither their entire lives nor particular reproductive portions are confined to planktonic existence. Tychoplankton are sometimes called \"accidental plankton\".\nBy life cycle.\nHoloplankton.\nHoloplankton are organisms that are planktic for their entire life cycle. Holoplankton can be contrasted with meroplankton, which are planktic organisms that spend part of their life cycle in the benthic zone. Examples of holoplankton include some diatoms, radiolarians, some dinoflagellates, foraminifera, amphipods, copepods, and salps, as well as some gastropod mollusk species. Holoplankton dwell in the pelagic zone as opposed to the benthic zone. Holoplankton include both phytoplankton and zooplankton and vary in size. The most common plankton are protists.\nMeroplankton.\nMeroplankton are a wide variety of aquatic organisms that have both planktonic and benthic stages in their life cycles. Much of the meroplankton consists of larval stages of larger organisms. Meroplankton can be contrasted with holoplankton, which are planktonic organisms that stay in the pelagic zone as plankton throughout their entire life cycle. After some time in the plankton, many meroplankton graduate to the nekton or adopt a benthic (often sessile) lifestyle on the seafloor. The larval stages of benthic invertebrates make up a significant proportion of planktonic communities. The planktonic larval stage is particularly crucial to many benthic invertebrates in order to disperse their young. Depending on the particular species and the environmental conditions, larval or juvenile-stage meroplankton may remain in the pelagic zone for durations ranging from hours to months.\nEcology.\nFood webs.\nAs well as representing the lower levels of a food chain that supports commercially important fisheries, plankton ecosystems play a role in the biogeochemical cycles of many important chemical elements, including the ocean's carbon cycle. Fish larvae mainly eat zooplankton, which in turn eat phytoplankton\nThe microbial loop: Bacteria play central roles in aquatic food webs. The microbial loop refers to a process in aquatic ecosystems where bacteria consume dissolved organic matter (DOM) and are then consumed by larger microorganisms, effectively cycling nutrients and energy within the ecosystem.\nThe viral shunt: Viruses also play central roles in aquatic food webs. The viral shunt is a process where viruses infect and lyse (burst) host cells, releasing cellular contents (including dissolved organic matter) that can be utilized by other microplankton like bacteria, effectively bypassing the traditional food web pathways. This process plays a significant role in nutrient cycling and carbon flow within aquatic ecosystems.\nFungi have a role as well. The mycoloop is a specific aquatic food web pathway where parasitic chytrid fungi infect large, inedible phytoplankton, and their zoospores (a type of spore) become a food source for zooplankton. In this manner, the chytrid fungi transfer nutrients from otherwise unusable phytoplankton to zooplankton.\nCarbon cycle.\nPrimarily by grazing on phytoplankton, zooplankton provide carbon to the planktic foodweb, either respiring it to provide metabolic energy, or upon death as biomass or detritus. Organic material tends to be denser than seawater, so it sinks into open ocean ecosystems away from the coastlines, transporting carbon along with it. This process, called the biological pump, is one reason that oceans constitute the largest carbon sink on Earth. However, it has been shown to be influenced by increments of temperature. In 2019, a study indicated that at ongoing rates of seawater acidification, Antarctic phytoplanktons could become smaller and less effective at storing carbon before the end of the century.\nIt might be possible to increase the ocean's uptake of carbon dioxide (CO2) generated through human activities by increasing plankton production through iron fertilization \u2013 introducing amounts of iron into the ocean. However, this technique may not be practical at a large scale. Ocean oxygen depletion and resultant methane production (caused by the excess production remineralising at depth) is one potential drawback.\nGreat Calcite Belt.\nThe Great Calcite Belt is a region in the Southern Ocean characterized by high concentrations of coccolithophores, a type of calcite-producing phytoplankton. It plays a significant role in ocean biogeochemistry and the global carbon cycle. Coccolithophores in the belt produce calcium carbonate (calcite or chalk) plates called coccoliths. This process, known as calcification, affects the ocean's carbon cycle by lowering alkalinity and releasing CO2. However, when coccolithophores die, their calcite shells sink, contributing to the biological pump by transporting carbon to the deep ocean, sequestering it for centuries or longer and mitigating atmospheric CO2 levels.\nOxygen production.\nPhytoplankton absorb energy from the Sun and nutrients from the water to produce their own nourishment or energy. In the process of photosynthesis, phytoplankton release molecular oxygen (O2) into the water as a waste byproduct. It is estimated that about 50% of the world's oxygen is produced via phytoplankton photosynthesis. The rest is produced via photosynthesis on land by plants. Furthermore, phytoplankton photosynthesis has controlled the atmospheric CO2/O2 balance since the early Precambrian Eon.\nAbsorption efficiency.\nThe \"absorption efficiency\" (AE) of plankton is the proportion of food absorbed by the plankton that determines how available the consumed organic materials are in meeting the required physiological demands. Depending on the feeding rate and prey composition, variations in absorption efficiency may lead to variations in fecal pellet production, and thus regulates how much organic material is recycled back to the marine environment. Low feeding rates typically lead to high absorption efficiency and small, dense pellets, while high feeding rates typically lead to low absorption efficiency and larger pellets with more organic content. Another contributing factor to dissolved organic matter (DOM) release is respiration rate. Physical factors such as oxygen availability, pH, and light conditions may affect overall oxygen consumption and how much carbon is loss from zooplankton in the form of respired CO2. The relative sizes of zooplankton and prey also mediate how much carbon is released via sloppy feeding. Smaller prey are ingested whole, whereas larger prey may be fed on more \"sloppily\", that is more biomatter is released through inefficient consumption. There is also evidence that diet composition can impact nutrient release, with carnivorous diets releasing more dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and ammonium than omnivorous diets.\nBiomass variability.\nThe growth of phytoplankton populations is dependent on light levels and nutrient availability. The chief factor limiting growth varies from region to region in the world's oceans. On a broad scale, growth of phytoplankton in the oligotrophic tropical and subtropical gyres is generally limited by nutrient supply, while light often limits phytoplankton growth in subarctic gyres. Environmental variability at multiple scales influences the nutrient and light available for phytoplankton, and as these organisms form the base of the marine food web, this variability in phytoplankton growth influences higher trophic levels. For example, at interannual scales phytoplankton levels temporarily plummet during El Ni\u00f1o periods, influencing populations of zooplankton, fishes, sea birds, and marine mammals.\nThe effects of anthropogenic warming on the global population of phytoplankton is an area of active research. Changes in the vertical stratification of the water column, the rate of temperature-dependent biological reactions, and the atmospheric supply of nutrients are expected to have important impacts on future phytoplankton productivity. Additionally, changes in the mortality of phytoplankton due to rates of zooplankton grazing may be significant.\nPlanktonic relationships.\nFish and plankton.\nZooplankton are the initial prey item for almost all fish larvae as they switch from their yolk sacs to external feeding. Fish rely on the density and distribution of zooplankton to match that of new larvae, which can otherwise starve. Natural factors (e.g., current variations, temperature changes) and man-made factors (e.g. river dams, ocean acidification, rising temperatures) can strongly affect zooplankton populations, which can in turn strongly affect fish larval survival, and therefore breeding success.\nIt has been shown that plankton can be patchy in marine environments where there aren't significant fish populations and additionally, where fish are abundant, zooplankton dynamics are influenced by the fish predation rate in their environment. Depending on the predation rate, they could express regular or chaotic behavior.\nA negative effect that fish larvae can have on planktonic algal blooms is that the larvae will prolong the blooming event by diminishing available zooplankton numbers; this in turn permits excessive phytoplankton growth allowing the bloom to flourish .\nThe importance of both phytoplankton and zooplankton is also well-recognized in extensive and semi-intensive pond fish farming. Plankton population-based pond management strategies for fish rearing have been practiced by traditional fish farmers for decades, illustrating the importance of plankton even in man-made environments.\nWhales and plankton.\nOf all animal fecal matter, it is whale feces that is the 'trophy' in terms of increasing nutrient availability. Phytoplankton are the powerhouse of open ocean primary production and they can acquire many nutrients from whale feces. In the marine food web, phytoplankton are at the base of the food web and are consumed by zooplankton &amp; krill, which are preyed upon by larger and larger marine organisms, including whales, so it can be said that whale feces fuels the entire food web.\nHumans and plankton.\nPlankton have many direct and indirect effects on humans.\nAround 70% of the oxygen in the atmosphere is produced in the oceans from phytoplankton performing photosynthesis, meaning that the majority of the oxygen available for us and other organisms that respire aerobically is produced by plankton.\nPlankton also make up the base of the marine food web, providing food for all the trophic levels above. Recent studies have analyzed the marine food web to see if the system runs on a top-down or bottom-up approach. Essentially, this research is focused on understanding whether changes in the food web are driven by nutrients at the bottom of the food web or predators at the top. The general conclusion is that the bottom-up approach seemed to be more predictive of food web behavior. This indicates that plankton have more sway in determining the success of the primary consumer species that prey on them than do the secondary consumers that prey on the primary consumers.\nIn some cases, plankton act as an intermediate host for deadly parasites in humans. One such case is that of cholera, an infection caused by several pathogenic strains of \"Vibrio cholerae\". These species have been shown to have a symbiotic relationship with chitinous zooplankton species like copepods. These bacteria benefit not only from the food provided by the chiton from the zooplankton, but also from the protection from acidic environments. Once the copepods have been ingested by a human host, the chitinous exterior protects the bacteria from the stomach acids in the stomach and proceed to the intestines. Once there, the bacteria bind with the surface of the small intestine and the host will start developing symptoms, including extreme diarrhea, within five days.\nPlankton Manifesto.\nIn 2024, the United Nations Global Compact's Ocean Stewardship Coalition launched the \"Plankton Manifesto\", collaboratively developed by over 30 international experts. It outlines strategic recommendations to guide global efforts at safeguarding plankton and harnessing their potential to address planetary climate change issues, as well as pollution and biodiversity loss. It emphasizes plankton's critical role as the foundation of marine ecosystems, producing about 50% of Earth's oxygen and sequestering 30\u201350 billion metric tonnes of carbon annually.\nKey recommendations include:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Pi Day is observed on March 14 (the 3rd month) since 3, 1, and 4 are the first three significant figures of \u03c0, and was first celebrated in the United States. It was founded in 1988 by Larry Shaw, an employee of a science museum in San Francisco, the Exploratorium. Celebrations often involve eating pie or holding pi recitation competitions. In 2009, the United States House of Representatives supported the designation of Pi Day. UNESCO's 40th General Conference designated Pi Day as the International Day of Mathematics in November 2019.\nOther dates when people celebrate pi include Pi Approximation Day on July 22 (22/7 in the \"day/month\" format), a closer approximation of \u03c0; and June 28 (6.28), an approximation of 2\u03c0 or \ud835\udf0f (tau).\nHistory.\nIn 1988, the earliest known official or large-scale celebration of Pi Day was organized by Larry Shaw at the San Francisco Exploratorium, where Shaw worked as a physicist, with staff and public marching around one of its circular spaces, then consuming fruit pies. The Exploratorium continues to hold Pi Day celebrations.\nOn March 12, 2009, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a non-binding resolution (), recognizing March 14, 2009, as National Pi Day. For Pi Day 2010, Google presented a Google Doodle celebrating the holiday, with the word Google laid over images of circles and pi symbols; and for the 30th anniversary in 2018, it was a Dominique Ansel pie with the circumference divided by its diameter.\nSome observed the entire month of March 2014 (3/14) as \"Pi Month\". In the year 2015, March 14 was celebrated as \"Super Pi Day\". It had special significance, as the date is written as 3/14/15 in month/day/year format. At 9:26:53, the date and time together represented the first ten digits of \u03c0, and later that second, \"Pi Instant\" represented all of \u03c0's digits.\nObservance.\nPi Day has been observed in many ways, including eating pie, throwing pies and discussing the significance of the number \u03c0. The first two are due to a pun based on the words \"pi\" and \"pie\" being homophones in English (), and the coincidental circular shape of many pies. Many pizza and pie restaurants offer discounts, deals, and free products on Pi Day. Also, some schools hold competitions as to which student can recall pi to the highest number of decimal places.\nThe Massachusetts Institute of Technology has often mailed its application decision letters to prospective students for delivery on Pi Day. Starting in 2012, MIT has announced it will post those decisions (privately) online on Pi Day at exactly 6:28\u00a0pm, which they have called \"Tau Time\", to honor the rival numbers \u03c0 and \ud835\udf0f equally. In 2015, the regular decisions were put online at 9:26\u00a0am, following that year's \"pi minute\", and in 2020, regular decisions were released at 1:59 pm, making the first six digits of pi.\nPrinceton, New Jersey, hosts numerous events in a combined celebration of Pi Day and Albert Einstein's birthday, which is also March 14. Einstein lived in Princeton for more than twenty years while working at the Institute for Advanced Study. In addition to pie eating and recitation contests, there is an annual Einstein look-alike contest.\nIn 2024, the recreational mathematician Matt Parker and a team of hundreds of volunteers at City of London School spent six days calculating 139 correct digits of pi by hand, in what Parker claimed was \"the biggest hand calculation in a century\". On 15 August 2024, the main-belt asteroid was named in his honor. The citation highlights Parker's biennial \"Pi Day challenges\", stating that they have helped to popularize mathematics.\nAlternative dates.\nPi Day is frequently observed on March 14 (3/14 in the \"month/day\" date format), but related celebrations have been held on alternative dates.\nPi Approximation Day is observed on July 22 (22/7 in the \"day/month\" date format), since the fraction &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;22\u20447 is a common approximation of \u03c0, which is accurate to two decimal places and dates from Archimedes. In Indonesia, a country that uses the DD/MM/YYYY date format, some people celebrate Pi Day every July 22.\nTau Day, also known as Two-Pi Day, is observed on June 28 (6/28 in the \"month/day\" format). The number \ud835\udf0f, denoted by the Greek letter tau, is the ratio of a circle's circumference to its radius; it equals 2\u03c0, a common multiple in mathematical formulae, and approximately equals 6.28. Some have argued that \ud835\udf0f is the clearer and more fundamental constant and that Tau Day should be celebrated alongside or instead of Pi Day. Celebrants of this date jokingly suggest eating \"twice the pie\".\nSome also celebrate \u03c0 on November 10, since it is the 314th day of the year (in leap years, on November 9).\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The magazine is published intermittently by Pelgrane Press and is named for one of the spells used by various wizards in the \"Dying Earth\" stories.\nPublication history.\nFrom 1950 to 1984, the science fiction and fantasy author Jack Vance wrote four \"Dying Earth\" books, all set in the distant future when the sun is almost exhausted and magic has asserted itself as a dominant force. In 2001, Pelgrane Press published a licensed role-playing game based on Vance's setting. To provide supplementary material for the game, Pelgrane published the first issue of \"The Excellent Prismatic Spray\" in December 2000. Two issues followed in 2001, a double issue in 2003, Number 6 in 2004, and after a four-year hiatus, another double issue in 2008.\nIn the 2014 book \"Designers &amp; Dragons\", game historian Shannon Appelcline noted that Pelgrane provided good support for \"The Dying Earth Roleplaying Game\" through 2008: \"That support began with eight issues of Pelgrane's \"Dying Earth\" magazine, \"The Excellent Prismatic Spray\" (2000\u20132008), which featured articles by RPG luminaries like Keith Baker, Monte Cook, Ed Greenwood, Gary Gygax, and Phil Masters. One or two \"Dying Earth\" supplements also appeared every year, except 2004 and 2005. This included plenty of setting books and some books intended to support the higher levels of play: \"Turjan's Tome of Beauty and Horror\" (2003) and \"Rhialto's Book of Marvels\" (2006). Starting in 2005, Pelgrane also began publishing PDFs for the game, which allowed them to produce more adventures \u2013 which previously appeared mostly within \"The Excellent Prismatic Spray\".\"\nReception.\nIn a review of \"The Dying Earth Roleplaying Game\" in \"Black Gate\", John ONeill said \"Much of the content of the magazine and the additional support material were written in studied imitation of Vance's witty and erudite style, and made terrific reading.\"\nWriting for \"The Guild Companion\", Nicholas Caldwell reviewed the third issue of the magazine, published in 2001, and was impressed by it, calling it \"a masterful addition to the series and well worth the terces.\" He liked the tongue-in-cheek \"in-character advertisements for goods and services for sale or sought on the \"Dying Earth\"\" and also found both the artwork and the writing style struck the right note, saying that it was \"handsomely illustrated by fine cover and interior artwork, and with respectful emulation of the Vancian prose style and humor.\" He concluded, \"Instruct your factor to purchase a copy before the sun goes out!\"\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The Pauli effect is not related to the Pauli exclusion principle, which is a bona fide physical phenomenon named after Pauli. However the Pauli effect was humorously tagged as a second Pauli exclusion principle, according to which \"a functioning device and Wolfgang Pauli may not occupy the same room\".\nAnecdotal evidence.\nSince the 20th century, the work in some subfields of physics research has been divided between theorists and experimentalists. Those theorists who lack an aptitude or interest in experimental work have on occasion earned a reputation for accidentally breaking experimental equipment.\nAn incident occurred in the physics laboratory at the University of G\u00f6ttingen. An expensive measuring device, for no apparent reason, suddenly stopped working, although Pauli was in fact \"absent\". James Franck, the director of the institute, reported the incident to his colleague Pauli in Z\u00fcrich with the humorous remark that at least this time Pauli was innocent. However, it turned out that Pauli had been on a railway journey to Z\u00fcrich and had switched trains in the G\u00f6ttingen rail station at about the time of the failure. The incident is reported in George Gamow's book \"Thirty Years That Shook Physics\", where it is also claimed the more talented the theoretical physicist, the stronger the effect.\nR. Peierls describes a case when at one reception this effect was to be parodied by deliberately crashing a chandelier upon Pauli's entrance. The chandelier was suspended on a rope to be released, but it stuck instead, thus becoming a real example of the Pauli effect.\nIn 1934, Pauli saw a failure of his car during a honeymoon tour with his second wife as proof of a real Pauli effect since it occurred without an obvious external cause.\nIn February 1950, when he was at Princeton University, the cyclotron burnt, and he asked himself if this mischief belonged to such a Pauli effect, named after him.\nReactions.\nFor fear of the Pauli effect, experimental physicist Otto Stern banned Pauli from his laboratory located in Hamburg despite their friendship.\nPauli was convinced that the effect named after him was real. He corresponded with Carl Jung and Marie-Louise von Franz about the concept of synchronicity. He also corresponded with Hans Bender, lecturer at Freiburg university Institut f\u00fcr Grenzgebiete der Psychologie und Psychohygiene and the only parapsychology chair in Germany.\nJung and Pauli saw some parallels between physics and depth psychology. Pauli was among the honored guests at the foundation festivities of the C.G. Jung Institute in Z\u00fcrich in 1948. An example of the Pauli effect happened at the ceremony: As he entered, a china flower vase fell on the floor for no obvious reason. This incident caused Pauli to write his article \"Background-Physics\", in which he tries to find complementary relationships between physics and depth psychology.\nCultural references.\nPhilip K. Dick makes reference to \"Pauli's synchronicity\" in his 1963 science fiction novel \"The Game-Players of Titan\", in reference to pre-cognitive psionic abilities being interfered with by other psionic abilities such as psychokinesis: \"an acausal connective event.\"\nIn the anime series \"Yu-Gi-Oh! Sevens\", Tatsuhisa Kamij\u014d is a self-proclaimed \"demon-embodied\" human who can randomly cause electronic devices such as phones and drones to malfunction or self destruct with his hands. The main character, Yuga Ohdo, attributes this to the Pauli Effect. \nThe anime \"Amnesia: Fated Memories\" and the video game \"Signalis\" also reference the Pauli effect and synchronicity.\nIn the movie \"\", Captain Lochley describes this effect to Lieutenant Corwin, drawing a parallel to how crises seem to emerge only when President Sheridan or ex-security chief Garibaldi are at the station.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He has been called \"the godfather of British comics\".\nHis comics are notable for their violence and anti-authoritarianism. He is best known for creating \"2000 AD\" and playing a major part in the development of \"Judge Dredd\".\nBiography.\nMills started his career as a sub-editor for D. C. Thomson &amp; Co. Ltd, where he met Wagner. In 1971 both left to go freelance, and were soon writing scripts for IPC's girls' and humour comics. After D.C. Thomson launched \"Warlord\", a successful war-themed weekly, Mills was asked in 1975 to develop a rival title for IPC. Based in the girls' comics department to avoid the attention of the staff of the boys' department, Mills, along with Wagner and Gerry Finley-Day, worked in secret to create \"Battle Picture Weekly\". \"Battle\"'s stories were more violent and its characters more working class than IPC's traditional fare, and it was an immediate hit. Having made the comic ready for launch, Mills resigned as editor. He would later write the celebrated First World War series \"Charley's War\", drawn by Joe Colquhoun, for the title.\nAfter launching \"Battle\", Mills began developing a new boys' title, \"Action\", launched in 1976. \"Action\"'s mix of violence and anti-authoritarianism proved controversial and the title lasted less than a year before being withdrawn in the face of media protests. It was briefly revived in neutered form before being merged into \"Battle\".\nHis next creation was the science fiction-themed weekly \"2000 AD\", launched in 1977. As with \"Battle\" and \"Action\" he developed most of the early series before handing them over to other writers. He took over the development of \"Judge Dredd\" when creator John Wagner temporarily walked out, and wrote many of the early stories, establishing the character and his world, before Wagner returned.\nIn 1978 IPC launched \"Starlord\", a short-lived companion title for \"2000 AD\". Mills contributed \"Ro-Busters\", a series about a robot disaster squad, which moved to \"2000 AD\" when \"Starlord\" was cancelled. \"Ro-Busters\" was the beginning of a mini-universe of interrelated stories Mills was to create for \"2000 AD\", including \"ABC Warriors\" and \"Nemesis the Warlock\". Artist Kevin O'Neill was involved in the creation of all three. Another strand of his \"2000 AD\" work was \"Sl\u00e1ine\", a barbarian fantasy based on Celtic mythology and neo-paganism, which he co-created with his then wife Angela Kincaid (with whom he also created the children's series of books, \"The Butterfly Children\").\nMills also had a hand in IPC's line of comics aimed at girls, such as \"Chiller\" (a horror comic), \"Misty\" (supernatural stories) and \"Jinty\" (science fiction).\nIn 1986 he edited the short-lived comic \"Diceman\", which featured characters from \"2000 AD\" in political satire regarding U.S. President Ronald Reagan. Mills wrote nearly every story.\nIn 1988 he was involved in the launch of \"Crisis\", a politically aware \"2000 AD\" spin-off aimed at older readers. For it he wrote \"Third World War\", drawn initially by Carlos Ezquerra. The title lasted until 1991 and launched the careers of talents such as Garth Ennis, John Smith and Sean Phillips.\nIn 1991 Mills launched \"Toxic!\", an independent colour newsstand weekly comic with a violent, anarchic tone, perhaps as a reaction against the politically worthy \"Crisis\", and a creator-owned ideal. Many of the stories were created by Mills and co-writer Tony Skinner, including \"Accident Man\", an assassin who makes his hits look like accidents. \"Toxic!\" lasted less than a year, but gave a start to talents such as Duke Mighten and Martin Emond.\nHe has had little success in American comics, with the exception of \"Metalzoic\" and \"Marshal Law\", published by DC and Epic comics respectively in the late 1980s, both drawn by O'Neill. Mills' \"Toxic\" strips \"Accident Man\" and \"Brats Bizarre\" were reprinted as their own US-format titles (by Dark Horse Comics and Epic, respectively) and Mills wrote \"Punisher 2099\" for Marvel, \"Zombie World\" for Dark Horse, and \"Death Race 2020\" (reuniting Mills with Kevin O'Neill) for Roger Corman's Cosmic Comics.\nIn 1995, he broke into the French market, one of his life's goals, with \"Sha\", created with French artist Olivier Ledroit.\nHe continues to write \"Sl\u00e1ine\", \"Bill Savage\", \"Black Siddha\" and \"ABC Warriors\" for \"2000 AD\", and also the Franco-Belgian comic \"Requiem Vampire Knight\", with art by Olivier Ledroit, and its spin-off \"Claudia Chevalier Vampire\", with art by Franck Tacito.\nTwo new series, \"Greysuit\", a super-powered government agent drawn by John Higgins, and \"Defoe\", a 17th-century zombie hunter drawn by Leigh Gallagher, began in \"2000 AD\" prog 1540.\nMills has formed Repeat Offenders with artist Clint Langley and Jeremy Davis \"to develop graphic novel concepts with big-screen potential\" and the first project is a graphic novel called \"American Reaper\", serialised in the \"Judge Dredd Megazine\" (2011\u20132015). It has been optioned by Trudie Styler's Xingu Films and Mills has written the screenplay.\nHe has also written two \"Doctor Who\" audio plays, \"Dead London\" (2008) and \"The Scapegoat\" (2009) for Big Finish Productions, featuring the Eighth Doctor and Lucie Miller. The first audio play was released as the first part of the second season of the Eighth Doctor Adventures and the second as part of the third season. In 2010 Mills adapted a story that had been started by him and Wagner for Doctor Who in the 1980s and was produced by Big Finish as \"The Song of Megaptera\". In 2023, a 1980 Fourth Doctor comic he penned (with artist Dave Gibbons) for \"Doctor Who Magazine\" was adapted into the Fourteenth Doctor special \"The Star Beast.\"\nIn 2017 he wrote, with Kevin O'Neill, and published two novels, \"Serial Killer\" and \"Goodnight, John-Boy\", part of a planned series of four books. Also in that year, he published his memoirs, \"Be Pure! Be Vigilant! Behave! 2000 AD and Judge Dredd: The Secret History\" in print and as an e-book. Mills also narrated the audiobook version himself. (The title is the catchphrase of the villain in his series \"Nemesis the Warlock\".)\nIn 2018 the film \"Accident Man\" was released, based on his comic strip for \"Toxic!\"\nIn 2019 Mills announced that he would publish a new all-ages science fiction anthology comic called \"Spacewarp\", to be released in 2020, and that the artists would retain the copyright on their work.\nIn 2021 he published another volume of memoirs with a focus on Slaine, \"Kiss My Axe! Slaine the Warped Warrior: The Secret History\".\nBibliography.\nAs well as his influential role in creating and contributing to numerous of British comics, Mills has produced work in both America and Europe.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\nInterviews"}

It is a very approximate measure of the number of unintended pregnancies in 100 woman-years of exposure that is simple to calculate, but has a number of methodological deficiencies.\nThe index was introduced by Raymond Pearl in 1934. It has remained popular for over eighty years, in large part because of the simplicity of the calculation.\nCalculation.\nSeveral kinds of information are needed to calculate a Pearl Index for a particular study:\nThere are two calculation methods for determining the Pearl Index:\nUsage.\nThe Pearl Index is sometimes used as a statistical estimation of the number of unintended pregnancies in 100 woman-years of exposure (e.g. 100 women over one year of use, or 10 women over 10 years). It is also sometimes used to compare birth control methods, a lower Pearl index representing a lower chance of getting unintentionally pregnant.\nUsually two Pearl Indexes are published from studies of birth control methods:\nCriticisms.\nLike all measures of birth control effectiveness, the Pearl Index is a calculation based on the observations of a given sample population. Thus, studies of different populations using the same contraceptive will yield different values for the index. The culture and demographics of the population being studied, and the instruction technique used to teach the method, have significant effects on its failure rate.\nThe Pearl Index has unique shortcomings, however. It assumes a constant failure rate over time. That is an incorrect assumption for two reasons: first, the most fertile couples will get pregnant first. Couples remaining later in the study are, on average, of lower fertility. Second, most birth control methods have better effectiveness in more experienced users. The longer a couple is in the study, the better they are at using the method. So the longer the study length, the lower the Pearl Index will be \u2013 and comparisons of Pearl Indexes from studies of different lengths cannot be accurate.\nThe Pearl Index also provides no information on factors other than accidental pregnancy which may influence effectiveness calculations, such as:\nA common misperception is that the highest possible Pearl Index is 100 \u2013 i.e. 100% of women in the study conceive in the first year. However, if all the women in the study conceived in the first month, the study would yield a Pearl Index of 1200 or 1300. The Pearl Index is only accurate as a statistical estimation of per-year risk of pregnancy if the pregnancy rate in the study was very low.\nIn 1966, two birth control statisticians advocated abandonment of the Pearl Index:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;[The Pearl Index] does not serve as an estimator of any quantity of interest, and comparisons between groups may be impossible to interpret... The superiority of life table methods or other estimators that do not assume a constant hazard rate seems clear."}

His notable works include \"The New York Trilogy\" (1987), \"Moon Palace\" (1989), \"The Music of Chance\" (1990), \"The Book of Illusions\" (2002), \"The Brooklyn Follies\" (2005), \"Invisible\" (2009), \"Sunset Park\" (2010), \"Winter Journal\" (2012), and \"4 3 2 1\" (2017). His books have been translated into more than 40 languages.\nEarly life.\nPaul Auster was born in Newark, New Jersey, son of Samuel Auster, a landlord who owned buildings with his brothers in Jersey City, and Queenie, n\u00e9e Bogat. His middle-class parents were Jewish, of Austrian descent; the marriage was an unhappy one, and they divorced during Auster's senior year of high school, he moving with his mother and sister to an apartment at Weequahic, Newark. An uncle was the translator Allen Mandelbaum. He grew up in South Orange, New Jersey, and Newark, and graduated from Columbia High School in Maplewood.\nDuring the summers of 1958 and 1959, Auster attended, respectively, Camp LakeView (East Brunswick, NJ) and Camp Pontiac (Copake, NY), where his outstanding athletic talents were recognized, especially as a baseball infielder. While attending summer camp, the 14-year-old Auster witnessed what he called the \"seminal experience\" of his life: a boy being struck by lightning and dying instantly. The boy was standing a few inches away from him at the time. This event changed his life, causing him to think about it every day.\nCareer.\nAfter graduating from Columbia University with B.A. and M.A. degrees (English, Comparative Literature) in 1970, he moved to Paris where, among other jobs, he tried to earn a living translating French literature. After returning to the United States in 1974, he continued to work on his poems, essays, and translations of French writers, such as St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9 and Joseph Joubert. His work as a translator led to the publication in 1982 of \"The Random House Book of Twentieth-Century French Poetry\", which he edited.\nFollowing the appearance in 1982 of his acclaimed debut work, a memoir titled \"The Invention of Solitude\", Auster gained renown for a series of three loosely connected novellas published collectively as \"The New York Trilogy\" (1987), and is often cited as his most widely known work to the general reading public.\nAlthough \"The New York Trilogy\" gives a nod to the detective genre, they are not conventional detective stories organized around solving mysteries. Rather, Auster uses the detective form to address questions of identity, space, language, and literature, creating his own distinctively postmodern form in the process. Auster disagrees with this analysis, because he believes that \"the \"Trilogy\" grows directly out of \"The Invention of Solitude\"\".\nSimilar to the themes explored in \"The New York Trilogy\", the search for identity and personal meaning continued to permeate the three novels Auster published in quick succession in the late 1980s. Whether writing about the relationships between people caught in the flux of an uncertain future and uncertain identity (\"In the Country of Last Things\" [1987] and \"Moon Palace\" [1989]), or the role of coincidence and random events in our lives (\"The Music of Chance\" [1990]), Auster was steadily increasing his readership and popularity.\nDuring the 1990s Auster published three more novels, but he increasingly turned his attention to script writing and filmmaking by way of his screenplay and directorial collaborations with Wayne Wang on \"Smoke\" (which won Auster the Independent Spirit Award for Best First Screenplay) and \"Blue in the Face\". He also directed the movie \"Lulu on the Bridge\" (1998).\nAfter a steadfast commitment to filmmaking during the late 1990s, Auster decided to turn his attention once again to writing novels, memoirs, and essays during the remaining two decades of his life. Between 2002 and 2024, Auster published nine novels, two memoirs, an 800-page biography of Stephen Crane (\"Burning Boy\"), and a sustained jeremiad (Auster calls it a \"political pamphlet\") on the long, unending history of gun violence in America (\"Bloodbath Nation\"). Eight of the final ten novels Auster published during his lifetime (from 1999 to 2023) received nominations for the International Dublin Award, and Auster's 2017 novel \"4 3 2 1\" was shortlisted for the Man Booker Prize.\nAuster was on the PEN American Center board of trustees from 2004 to 2009 and its vice president from 2005 through 2007.\nIn 2012, Auster said in an interview that he would not visit Turkey, in protest at its treatment of journalists. Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan replied: \"As if we need you! Who cares if you come, or not?\" Auster responded: \"According to the latest numbers gathered by International PEN, there are nearly one hundred writers imprisoned in Turkey, not to speak of independent publishers such as Rag\u0131p Zarakolu, whose case is being closely watched by PEN Centers around the world.\"\nAuster was willing to give Iranian translators permission to write Persian versions of his works in exchange for a small fee; Iran does not recognize international copyright laws.\nOne of Auster's later books, \"A Life in Words,\" was published in October 2017 by Seven Stories Press. It brought together two years of conversations with the Danish scholar I.B. Siegumfeldt about each of Auster's fiction and non-fiction works. It has been a primary source for understanding Auster's approach to his works.\nReception.\n\"Over the past twenty-five years\", wrote Michael Dirda in \"The New York Review of Books\" in 2008, \"Paul Auster has established one of the most distinctive niches in contemporary literature\". Dirda extolled his virtues in \"The Washington Post\", attesting that Auster had \"perfected a limpid, confessional style\" and constructed suspenseful, sometimes autobiographical plots. His heroes operated in a world that appeared familiar but they confronted \"vague menace and possible hallucination.\"\nWriting about Auster's 2017 novel \"4 3 2 1\", \"Booklist\" critic Donna Seaman remarked that Auster went beyond conventions of storytelling and mixed genres, even crossing over into filmic modes. She praised the complex sense of wonder and gratitude in his works, which often features \"sly humor\" in an oeuvre which she considered \"a grand experiment, not only in storytelling, but also in the endless nature-versus-nurture debate, the perpetual dance between inheritance and free will, intention and chance, dreams and fate. This elaborate investigation into the big what-if is also a mesmerizing dramatization of the multitude of clashing selves we each harbor within.\"\nThe English critic James Wood criticized Auster for what he considered \"borrowed language\" and \"bogus dialogue\", nonetheless conceding that Auster was \"probably America's best-known postmodern novelist\". He noted: \"One reads Auster's novels very fast, because they are lucidly written, because the grammar of the prose is the grammar of the most familiar realism (the kind that is, in fact, comfortingly artificial), and because the plots, full of sneaky turns and surprises and violent irruptions, have what the \"Times\" once called 'all the suspense and pace of a bestselling thriller'.\"\nPersonal life and death.\nAuster's first marriage, to writer Lydia Davis, lasted from 1974 until their separation in 1979; they divorced in 1981. Their only child, Daniel, was charged in April 2022 with second-degree manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide following the fentanyl and heroin overdose death of his 10-month-old daughter. He died later that month of an accidental drug overdose.\nIn 1981, Auster married his second wife, writer Siri Hustvedt, the daughter of professor and scholar Lloyd Hustvedt. They lived in Brooklyn and had one daughter, Sophie Auster, a singer.\nPaul Auster characterized his politics as \"far to the left of the Democratic Party\", but said he voted Democratic because he doubted a socialist candidate could win. He described right-wing Republicans as \"jihadists\", and the election of Donald Trump as \"the most appalling thing I've seen in politics in my life\".\nOn March 11, 2023, Auster's wife Siri Hustvedt revealed on Instagram that he had been diagnosed with cancer in December 2022, and that he had been treated at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York since then.\nPaul Auster died of complications from lung cancer at his home in Brooklyn, on April 30, 2024, at the age of 77. He was survived by his wife Siri Hustvedt, their daughter Sophie Auster, his sister Janet Auster, and a grandson.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "25030", "revid": "51037797", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25030", "title": "Plain text", "text": "Term for computer data consisting only of unformatted characters of readable material\nIn computing, plain text is a loose term for data (e.g. file contents) that represent only characters of readable material but not its graphical representation nor other objects (floating-point numbers, images, etc.). It may also include a limited number of \"whitespace\" characters that affect simple arrangement of text, such as spaces, line breaks, or tabulation characters. Plain text is different from formatted text, where style information is included; from structured text, where structural parts of the document such as paragraphs, sections, and the like are identified; and from binary files in which some portions must be interpreted as binary objects (encoded integers, real numbers, images, etc.).\nThe term is sometimes used quite loosely, to mean files that contain \"only\" \"readable\" content (or just files with nothing that the speaker does not prefer). For example, that could exclude any indication of fonts or layout (such as markup, markdown, or even tabs); characters such as curly quotes, non-breaking spaces, soft hyphens, em dashes, and/or ligatures; or other things.\nIn principle, plain text can be in any encoding, but occasionally the term is taken to imply ASCII. As Unicode-based encodings such as UTF-8 and UTF-16 become more common, that usage may be shrinking.\nPlain text is also sometimes used only to exclude \"binary\" files: those in which at least some parts of the file cannot be correctly interpreted via the character encoding in effect. For example, a file or string consisting of \"hello\" (in any encoding), following by 4 bytes that express a binary integer that is \"not\" a character, is a binary file. Converting a plain text file to a different character encoding does not change the meaning of the text, as long as the correct character encoding is used. However, converting a binary file to a different format may alter the interpretation of the non-textual data.\nPlain text and rich text.\nAccording to The Unicode Standard:\nAccording to other definitions, however, files that contain markup or other meta-data are generally considered plain text, so long as the markup is also in a directly human-readable form (as in HTML, XML, and so on). Thus, representations such as SGML, RTF, HTML, XML, wiki markup, and TeX, as well as nearly all programming language source code files, are considered plain text. The particular content is irrelevant to whether a file is plain text. For example, an SVG file can express drawings or even bitmapped graphics, but is still plain text.\nThe use of plain text rather than binary files enables files to survive much better \"in the wild\", in part by making them largely immune to computer architecture incompatibilities. For example, with all data encoded as UTF-8 text, all the problems of endianness can be avoided.\nUsage.\nThe purpose of using plain text today is primarily independence from programs that require their very own special encoding or formatting or file format. Plain text files can be opened, read, and edited with ubiquitous text editors and utilities.\nA command-line interface allows people to give commands in plain text and get a response, also typically in plain text.\nMany other computer programs are also capable of processing or creating plain text, such as countless programs in DOS, Windows, classic Mac OS, and Unix and its kin; as well as web browsers (a few browsers such as Lynx and the Line Mode Browser produce only plain text for display) and other e-text readers.\nPlain text files are almost universal in programming; a source code file containing instructions in a programming language is almost always a plain text file. Plain text is also commonly used for configuration files, which are read for saved settings at the startup of a program.\nPlain text is used for much e-mail.\nA comment, a \".txt\" file, or a TXT Record generally contains only plain text (without formatting) intended for humans to read.\nThe best format for storing knowledge persistently is plain text, rather than some binary format.\nEncoding.\nCharacter encodings.\nBefore the early 1960s, computers were mainly used for number-crunching rather than for text, and memory was extremely expensive. Computers often allocated only 6 bits for each character, permitting only 64 characters\u2014assigning codes for A-Z, a-z, and 0-9 would leave only 2 codes: nowhere near enough. Most computers opted not to support lower-case letters. Thus, early text projects such as Roberto Busa's Index Thomisticus, the Brown Corpus, and others had to resort to conventions such as keying an asterisk preceding letters actually intended to be upper-case.\nFred Brooks of IBM argued strongly for going to 8-bit bytes, because someday people might want to process text, and won. Although IBM used EBCDIC, most text from then on came to be encoded in ASCII, using values from 0 to 31 for (non-printing) control characters, and values from 32 to 127 for graphic characters such as letters, digits, and punctuation. Most machines stored characters in 8 bits rather than 7, ignoring the remaining bit or using it as a checksum.\nThe near-ubiquity of ASCII was a great help, but failed to address international and linguistic concerns. The dollar-sign (\"$\") was not as useful in England, and the accented characters used in Spanish, French, German, Portuguese, Italian and many other languages were entirely unavailable in ASCII (not to mention characters used in Greek, Russian, and most Eastern languages). Many individuals, companies, and countries defined extra characters as needed\u2014often reassigning control characters, or using values in the range from 128 to 255. Using values above 128 conflicts with using the 8th bit as a checksum, but the checksum usage gradually died out.\nThese additional characters were encoded differently in different countries, making texts impossible to decode without figuring out the originator's rules. For instance, a browser might display \u00acA rather than ` if it tried to interpret one character set as another. The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) eventually developed several code pages under ISO 8859, to accommodate various languages. The first of these (ISO 8859-1) is also known as \"Latin-1\", and covers the needs of most (not all) European languages that use Latin-based characters (there was not quite enough room to cover them all). ISO 2022 then provided conventions for \"switching\" between different character sets in mid-file. Many other organisations developed variations on these, and for many years Windows and Macintosh computers used incompatible variations.\nThe text-encoding situation became more and more complex, leading to efforts by ISO and by the Unicode Consortium to develop a single, unified character encoding that could cover all known (or at least all currently known) languages. After some conflict, these efforts were unified. Unicode currently allows for 1,114,112 code values, and assigns codes covering nearly all modern text writing systems, as well as many historical ones, and for many non-linguistic characters such as printer's dingbats, mathematical symbols, etc.\nText is considered plain text regardless of its encoding. To properly understand or process it the recipient must know (or be able to figure out) what encoding was used; however, they need not know anything about the computer architecture that was used, or about the binary structures defined by whatever program (if any) created the data.\nPerhaps the most common way of explicitly stating the specific encoding of plain text is with a MIME type.\nFor email and HTTP, the default MIME type is \"text/plain\" -- plain text without markup.\nAnother MIME type often used in both email and HTTP is \"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" -- plain text represented using the UTF-8 character encoding with HTML markup.\nAnother common MIME type is \"application/json\" -- plain text represented using the UTF-8 character encoding with JSON markup.\nWhen a document is received without any explicit indication of the character encoding, some applications use charset detection to attempt to guess what encoding was used.\nControl codes.\nASCII reserves the first 32 codes (numbers 0\u201331 decimal) for control characters known as the \"C0 set\": codes originally intended not to represent printable information, but rather to control devices (such as printers) that make use of ASCII, or to provide meta-information about data streams such as those stored on magnetic tape. They include common characters like the newline and the tab character.\nIn 8-bit character sets such as Latin-1 and the other ISO 8859 sets, the first 32 characters of the \"upper half\" (128 to 159) are also control codes, known as the \"C1 set\". They are rarely used directly; when they turn up in documents which are ostensibly in an ISO 8859 encoding, their code positions generally refer instead to the characters at that position in a proprietary, system-specific encoding, such as Windows-1252 or Mac OS Roman, that use the codes to instead provide additional graphic characters.\nUnicode defines additional control characters, including bi-directional text direction override characters (used to explicitly mark right-to-left writing inside left-to-right writing and the other way around) and variation selectors to select alternate forms of CJK ideographs, emoji and other characters.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "25031", "revid": "40012101", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25031", "title": "Presbyterian Church (USA)", "text": "Mainline Protestant denomination in the US\nThe Presbyterian Church (USA), abbreviated PCUSA, is a mainline Protestant denomination in the United States. Despite ongoing severe losses in membership, it remains the largest Presbyterian denomination in the United States. Its theological roots lie primarily in the Scottish Reformation, particularly going back to the reforms done by the Calvinist reformer and minister John Knox of Scotland. Now known for its generally liberal stance on doctrine, The Presbyterian Church (USA) was established with the 1983 merger of the Presbyterian Church in the United States, whose churches were located in the Southern and border states, with the United Presbyterian Church in the United States of America, whose congregations could be found in every state.\nThe church maintains a Book of Confessions, a collection of historic and contemporary creeds and catechisms, including its own Brief Statement of Faith. It is a member of the World Communion of Reformed Churches. The similarly named Presbyterian Church in America (PCA) is a separate denomination whose congregations can also trace their history to the various schisms and mergers of Presbyterian churches in the United States. Unlike the more conservative Presbyterian Church in America, the Presbyterian Church (USA) supports the ordination of women and affirms same-sex marriages. It also welcomes practicing gay and lesbian persons to serve in leadership positions as ministers, deacons, elders, and trustees.\nThe Presbyterian Church (USA) is the largest Presbyterian denomination in the United States, reporting 1,045,848 active members and 17,742 ordained ministers (including retired ones) in 8,432 congregations at the end of 2024. This number does not include members who are baptized but not confirmed, or the inactive members also affiliated. For example, in 2005, the Presbyterian Church (USA) claimed 318,291 baptized but not confirmed members and nearly 500,000 inactive members in addition to active members. In 2025, Pew Research Center estimated that 1 percent of US adults, or approximately 2.6 million people, self-identified with the PC(USA). Its membership has been steadily declining over the past several decades; the trend has significantly accelerated in recent years, partly due to breakaway congregations. Average denominational worship attendance dropped from 748,774 in 2013 to 446,546 in 2024.\nHistory.\nOrigins.\nPresbyterians trace their history to the Protestant Reformation in the 16th century. The Presbyterian heritage, and much of its theology, began with the French theologian and lawyer John Calvin (1509\u20131564), whose writings solidified much of the Reformed tradition that came before him in the form of the sermons and writings of Huldrych Zwingli. From Calvin's headquarters in Geneva, the Reformed movement spread to other parts of Europe. John Knox, a former Roman Catholic priest from Scotland who studied with Calvin in Geneva, took Calvin's teachings back to Scotland and led the Scottish Reformation of 1560. Because of this reform movement, the Church of Scotland embraced Reformed theology and presbyterian polity. The Ulster Scots brought their Presbyterian faith with them to Ireland, where they laid the foundation of what would become the Presbyterian Church in Ireland.\nImmigrants from Scotland, England and Ireland brought Presbyterianism to North America as early as 1640, the first of whom was Rev. Richard Denton, who had preached in Halifax, England until finding it necessary to leave England after excommunication by the Church of England. He would establish the first Presbyterian church in all North America in Hempstead, New York, and a New York state historical marker confirms the fact. Immigration would remain a large source of growth throughout the colonial era. Another source of growth were a number of New England Puritans who left the Congregational churches because they preferred presbyterian polity. In 1706, seven ministers led by Francis Makemie established the first American presbytery at Philadelphia in the Province of Pennsylvania, which was followed by the creation of the Synod of Philadelphia in 1717.\nThe First Great Awakening and the revivalism it generated had a major impact on American Presbyterians. Ministers such as William and Gilbert Tennent, a friend of George Whitefield, emphasized the necessity of a conscious conversion experience and pushed for higher moral standards among the clergy. Disagreements over revivalism, itinerant preaching, and educational requirements for clergy led to a division known as the Old Side\u2013New Side Controversy that lasted from 1741 to 1758.\nIn the South, the Presbyterians were evangelical dissenters, mostly Scotch-Irish, who expanded into Virginia between 1740 and 1758. Spangler in \"Virginians Reborn: Anglican Monopoly, Evangelical Dissent, and the Rise of the Baptists in the Late Eighteenth Century\" (2008) argues they were more energetic and held frequent services better attuned to the frontier conditions of the colony. Presbyterianism grew in frontier areas where the Anglicans had made little impression. Less educated white people, and Black people, were attracted to the emotional worship of the denomination, its emphasis on biblical simplicity, and its psalm singing.\nSome local Presbyterian churches, such as Briery in Prince Edward County, owned slaves. The Briery church purchased five slaves in 1766 and raised money for church expenses by hiring them out to local planters.\nAfter the United States achieved independence from Great Britain, Presbyterian leaders felt that a national Presbyterian denomination was needed, and the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America (PCUSA) was organized. The first general assembly was held in Philadelphia in 1789. John Witherspoon, president of Princeton University and the only minister to sign the Declaration of Independence, was the first moderator.\nNot all American Presbyterians participated in the creation of the PCUSA General Assembly because the divisions then occurring in the Church of Scotland were replicated in America. In 1751, Scottish Covenanters began sending ministers to America, and the Seceders were doing the same by 1753. In 1858, the majority of Covenanters and Seceders merged to create the United Presbyterian Church of North America (UPCNA).\n19th century.\nIn the decades after independence many American Protestants, including Calvinists (Presbyterians and Congregationalists), Methodists, and Baptists, were swept up in Christian revivals that would later become known as the Second Great Awakening. Presbyterians also helped to shape voluntary societies that encouraged educational, missionary, evangelical, and reforming work. As its influence grew, many non-Presbyterians feared that the PCUSA's informal influence over American life might effectively make it an established church.\nThe Second Great Awakening divided the PCUSA over revivalism and fear that revivalism was leading to an embrace of Arminian theology. In 1810, frontier revivalists split from the PCUSA and organized the Cumberland Presbyterian Church. Throughout the 1820s, support and opposition to revivalism hardened into well-defined factions, the New School and Old School respectively. By the 1838, the Old School\u2013New School Controversy had divided the PCUSA. There were now two general assemblies each claiming to represent the PCUSA.\nIn 1858, the New School split along sectional lines when its Southern synods and presbyteries established the pro-slavery United Synod of the Presbyterian Church. Old School Presbyterians followed in 1861 after the start of hostilities in the American Civil War with the formation of the Presbyterian Church in the Confederate States of America. The Presbyterian Church in the CSA absorbed the smaller United Synod in 1864. After the war, this body was renamed the Presbyterian Church in the United States (PCUS) and was commonly nicknamed the \"Southern Presbyterian Church\" throughout its history. In 1869, the northern PCUSA's Old School and New School factions reunited as well and was known as the \"Northern Presbyterian Church\".\n20th century to the present.\nThe early part of the 20th century saw continued growth in both major sections of the church. It also saw the growth of Fundamentalist Christianity (a movement of those who believed in the literal interpretation of the Bible as the fundamental source of the religion) as distinguished from Modernist Christianity (a movement holding the belief that Christianity needed to be re-interpreted in light of modern scientific theories such as evolution or the rise of degraded social conditions brought on by industrialization and urbanization).\nOpen controversy was sparked in 1922, when Harry Emerson Fosdick, a modernist and a Baptist pastoring a PCUSA congregation in New York City, preached a sermon entitled \"Shall the Fundamentalists Win?\" The crisis reached a head the following year when, in response to the New York Presbytery's decision to ordain a couple of men who could not affirm the virgin birth, the PCUSA's General Assembly reaffirmed the \"five fundamentals\": the deity of Christ, the Virgin Birth, the vicarious atonement, the inerrancy of Scripture, and Christ's miracles and resurrection. This move against modernism caused a backlash in the form of the \"Auburn Affirmation\"\u00a0\u2014 a document embracing liberalism and modernism. The liberals began a series of ecclesiastical trials of their opponents, expelled them from the church and seized their church buildings. Under the leadership of J. Gresham Machen, a former Princeton Theological Seminary New Testament professor who had founded Westminster Theological Seminary in 1929, and who was a PCUSA minister, many of these conservatives would establish what became known as the Orthodox Presbyterian Church in 1936. Although the 1930s and 1940s and the ensuing neo-orthodox theological consensus mitigated much of the polemics during the mid-20th century, disputes erupted again beginning in the mid-1960s over the extent of involvement in the civil rights movement and the issue of ordination of women, and, especially since the 1990s, over the issue of ordination of homosexuals.\nMergers.\nThe Presbyterian Church in the United States of America was joined by the majority of the Cumberland Presbyterian Church, mostly congregations in the border and Southern states, in 1906. In 1920, it absorbed the Welsh Calvinist Methodist Church. The United Presbyterian Church of North America merged with the PCUSA in 1958 to form the United Presbyterian Church in the United States of America (UPCUSA).\nUnder Eugene Carson Blake, the UPCUSA's stated clerk, the denomination entered into a period of social activism and ecumenical endeavors, which culminated in the development of the Confession of 1967 which was the church's first new confession of faith in three centuries. The 170th General Assembly in 1958 authorized a committee to develop a brief contemporary statement of faith. The 177th General Assembly in 1965 considered and amended the draft confession and sent a revised version for general discussion within the church. The 178th General Assembly in 1966 accepted a revised draft and sent it to presbyteries throughout the church for final ratification. As the confession was ratified by more than 90% of all presbyteries, the 178th General Assembly adopted it in 1967. The UPCUSA also adopted a \"Book of Confessions\" in 1967, which would include the Confession of 1967, the Westminster Confession and Westminster Shorter Catechism, the Heidelberg Catechism, the Second Helvetic and Scots Confessions and the Barmen Declaration.\nAn attempt to reunite the United Presbyterian Church in the USA with the Presbyterian Church in the United States in the late 1950s failed when the latter church was unwilling to accept ecclesiastical centralization. In the meantime, a conservative group broke away from the Presbyterian Church in the United States in 1973, mainly over the issues of women's ordination and a perceived drift toward theological liberalism. This group formed the Presbyterian Church in America (PCA).\nAttempts at union between the churches (UPCUSA and PCUS) were renewed in the 1970s, culminating in the merger of the two churches to form the Presbyterian Church (USA) on June 10, 1983. At the time of the merger, the churches had a combined membership of 3,121,238. Many of the efforts were spearheaded by the financial and outspoken activism of retired businessman Thomas Clinton who died two years before the merger. A new national headquarters was established in Louisville, Kentucky in 1988 replacing the headquarters of the UPCUSA in New York City and the PCUS located in Atlanta, Georgia.\nThe merger essentially consolidated moderate-to-liberal American Presbyterians into one body. Other US Presbyterian bodies (the Cumberland Presbyterians being a partial exception) place greater emphasis on doctrinal Calvinism, literalist hermeneutics, and conservative politics.\nFor the most part, PC(USA) Presbyterians, not unlike similar mainline traditions such as the Episcopal Church and the United Church of Christ, are fairly progressive on matters such as doctrine, environmental issues, sexual morality, and economic issues, though the denomination remains divided and conflicted on these issues. Like other mainline denominations, the PC(USA) has also seen a great deal of demographic aging, with fewer new members and declining membership since 1967.\nSocial justice initiatives and renewal movements.\nIn the 1990s, 2000s, and 2010s, the General Assembly of PC(USA) adopted several social justice initiatives, which covered a range of topics including: stewardship of God's creation, world hunger, homelessness, and LGBT issues. As of 2011 the PC(USA) no longer excludes Partnered Gay and Lesbian ministers from the ministry. Previously, the PC(USA) required its ministers to remain \"chastely in singleness or with fidelity in marriage.\" Currently, the PC(USA) permits teaching elders to perform same-gender marriages. On a congregational basis, individual sessions (congregational governing bodies) may choose to permit same-gender marriages.\nThese changes have led to several renewal movements and denominational splinters. Some conservative-minded groups in the PC(USA), such as the Confessing Movement and the Presbyterian Lay Committee (formed in the mid-1960s) have remained in the main body, rather than leaving to form new, break-away groups.\nBreakaway Presbyterian denominations.\nSeveral Presbyterian denominations have split from PC(USA) or its predecessors over the years. For example, the Orthodox Presbyterian Church broke away from the Presbyterian Church in the USA in 1936.\nMore recently formed Presbyterian denominations have attracted PC(USA) congregations disenchanted with the direction of the denomination, but wishing to continue in a Reformed, Presbyterian denomination. The Presbyterian Church in America (PCA), which does not allow ordained female clergy, separated from Presbyterian Church in the United States in 1973 and has subsequently become the second largest Presbyterian denomination in the United States. The Evangelical Presbyterian Church (EPC), which gives local presbyteries the option of allowing ordained female pastors, broke away from the United Presbyterian Church and incorporated in 1981. A PC(USA) renewal movement, Fellowship of Presbyterians (FOP) (now The Fellowship Community), held several national conferences serving disaffecting Presbyterians. FOP's organizing efforts culminated with the founding of (ECO), a new Presbyterian denomination that allows ordination of women but is more conservative theologically than PC(USA).\nIn 2013 the presbyteries ratified the General Assembly's 2012 vote to allow the ordination of openly gay persons to the ministry and in 2014 the General Assembly voted to amend the church's constitution to define marriage as the union of two persons instead of the union of a man and woman, which was ratified (by the presbyteries) in 2015. This has led to the departure of several hundred congregations. The majority of churches leaving the Presbyterian Church (USA) have chosen to join other denominations such as the Evangelical Presbyterian Church or ECO. Few have chosen to join the larger more conservative Presbyterian Church in America, which does not permit female clergy.\nYouth.\nSince 1983 the Presbyterian Youth Triennium has been held every three years at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana, US, and is open to Presbyterian high school students throughout the world. The very first Youth Triennium was held in 1980 at Indiana University and the conference for teens is an effort of the Presbyterian Church (USA), the largest Presbyterian denomination in the nation; Cumberland Presbyterian Church; and Cumberland Presbyterian Church in America, the first African-American denomination to embrace Presbyterianism in the reformed tradition.\nSince 1907, Montreat, North Carolina has hosted a youth conference every year. In 1983, Montreat Conference Center became a National Conference Center of the PC(USA) when the northern and southern denominational churches reunited.\nStructure.\nConstitution.\nThe Constitution of PC(USA) is composed of two portions: Part I, the \"Book of Confessions\" and Part II, the \"Book of Order\". The \"Book of Confessions\" outlines the beliefs of the PC(USA) by declaring the creeds by which the Church's leaders are instructed and led. Complementing that is the \"Book of Order\" which gives the rationale and description for the organization and function of the Church at all levels. The \"Book of Order\" is currently divided into four sections \u2013 1) The Foundations of Presbyterian Polity 2) The Form of Government, 3) The Directory For Worship, and 4) The Rules of Discipline.\nCouncils.\nThe Presbyterian Church (USA) has a representative form of government, known as presbyterian polity, with four levels of government and administration, as outlined in the \"Book of Order\". The councils (governing bodies) are as follows: \nSession.\nAt the congregational level, the governing body is called the \"session\", from the Latin word \"sessio\", meaning \"a sitting\". The session is made up of the pastors of the church and all elders elected and installed to active service. Following a pattern set in the first congregation of Christians in Jerusalem described in the Book of Acts in the New Testament, the church is governed by \"presbyters\" (a term and category that includes elders and Ministers of Word and Sacrament, historically also referred to as \"ruling or canon elders\" because they \"measure\" the spiritual life and work of a congregation and ministers as \"teaching elders\").\nThe elders are nominated by a nominating committee of the congregation; in addition, nominations from the floor are permissible. Elders are then elected by the congregation. All elders elected to serve on the congregation's session of elders are required to undergo a period of study and preparation for this order of ministry, after which the session examines the elders-elect as to their personal faith; knowledge of doctrine, government, and discipline contained in the Constitution of the church, and the duties of the office of elder. If the examination is approved, the session appoints a day for the service of ordination and installation. Session meetings are normally moderated by a called and installed pastor and minutes are recorded by a clerk, who is also an ordained presbyter. If the congregation does not have an installed pastor, the Presbytery appoints a minister member or elected member of the presbytery as moderator with the concurrence of the local church session. The moderator presides over the session as first among equals and also serves as a \"liturgical\" bishop over the ordination and installation of elders and deacons within a particular congregation.\nThe session guides and directs the ministry of the local church, including almost all spiritual and fiduciary leadership. The congregation as a whole has only the responsibility to vote on: 1) the call of the pastor (subject to presbytery approval) and the terms of call (the church's provision for compensating and caring for the pastor); 2) the election of its own officers (elders and deacons); 3) buying, mortgaging, or selling real property. All other church matters such as the budget, personnel matters, and all programs for spiritual life and mission, are the responsibility of the session. In addition, the session serves as an ecclesiastical court to consider disciplinary charges brought against church officers or members.\nThe session also oversees the work of the deacons, a second body of leaders also tracing its origins to the Book of Acts. The deacons are a congregational-level group whose duty is \"to minister to those who are in need, to the sick, to the friendless, and to any who may be in distress both within and beyond the community of faith.\" In some churches, the responsibilities of the deacons are taken care of by the session, so there is no board of deacons in that church. In some states, churches are legally incorporated and members or elders of the church serve as trustees of the corporation. However, \"the power and duties of such trustees shall not infringe upon the powers and duties of the Session or of the board of deacons.\" The deacons are a ministry board but not a governing body.\nPresbytery.\nA \"presbytery\" is formed by all the congregations and the Ministers of Word and Sacrament in a geographic area together with elders selected (proportional to congregation size) from each of the congregations. Four special presbyteries are \"non-geographical\" in that they overlay other English-speaking presbyteries, though they are geographically limited to the boundaries of a particular synod (see below); it may be more accurate to refer to them as \"trans-geographical\". Three PC(USA) synods have a non-geographical presbytery for Korean language Presbyterian congregations, and one synod has a non-geographical presbytery for Native American congregations, the Dakota Presbytery. There are currently 166 presbyteries for the 8,432 congregations in the PC(USA).\nOnly the presbytery (not a congregation, session, synod, or General Assembly) has the responsibility and authority to ordain church members to the ordered ministry of Word and Sacrament, also referred to as a Teaching Elder, to install ministers to (or remove them from) congregations as pastors, and to remove a minister from the ministry. A Presbyterian minister is a member of a presbytery. The General Assembly cannot ordain or remove a Teaching Elder, but the Office of the General Assembly does maintain and publish a national directory with the help of each presbytery's stated clerk. This directory is also published bi-annually with the minutes of the General Assembly. A pastor cannot be a member of the congregation he or she serves as a pastor because his or her primary ecclesiastical accountability lies with the presbytery. Members of the congregation generally choose their own pastor with the assistance and support of the presbytery. The presbytery must approve the choice and officially install the pastor at the congregation, or approve the covenant for a temporary pastoral relationship. Additionally, the presbytery must approve if either the congregation or the pastor wishes to dissolve that pastoral relationship.\nThe presbytery has authority over many affairs of its local congregations. Only the presbytery can approve the establishment, dissolution, or merger of congregations. The presbytery also maintains a Permanent Judicial Commission, which acts as a court of appeal from sessions, and which exercises original jurisdiction in disciplinary cases against minister members of the presbytery.\nA presbytery has two elected officers: a moderator and a stated clerk. The Moderator of the presbytery is elected annually and is either a minister member or an elder commissioner from one of the presbytery's congregations. The Moderator presides at all presbytery assemblies and is the chief overseer at the ordination and installation of ministers in that presbytery. The stated clerk is the chief ecclesial officer and serves as the presbytery's executive secretary and parliamentarian in accordance with the church Constitution and Robert's Rules of Order. While the moderator of a presbytery normally serves one year, the stated clerk normally serves a designated number of years and may be re-elected indefinitely by the presbytery. Additionally, an Executive Presbyter (sometimes designated as General Presbyter, Pastor to Presbytery, Transitional Presbyter) is often elected as a staff person to care for the administrative duties of the presbytery, often with the additional role of a pastor to the pastors. Presbyteries may be creative in the designation and assignment of duties for their staff. A presbytery is required to elect a Moderator and a Clerk, but the practice of hiring staff is optional. Presbyteries must meet at least twice a year, but they have the discretion to meet more often and most do.\n\"See \"Map of Presbyteries and Synods\"\".\nSynod.\nPresbyteries are organized within a geographical region to form a \"synod\". Each synod contains at least three presbyteries, and its elected voting membership is to include both elders and Ministers of Word and Sacrament in equal numbers. Synods have various duties depending on the needs of the presbyteries they serve. In general, their responsibilities (G-12.0102) might be summarized as: developing and implementing the mission of the church throughout the region, facilitating communication between presbyteries and the General Assembly, and mediating conflicts between the churches and presbyteries. Every synod elects a Permanent Judicial Commission, which has original jurisdiction in remedial cases brought against its constituent presbyteries, and which also serves as an ecclesiastical court of appeal for decisions rendered by its presbyteries' Permanent Judicial Commissions. Synods are required to meet at least biennially. Meetings are moderated by an elected synod Moderator with support of the synod's Stated Clerk. There are currently 16 synods in the PC(USA) and they vary widely in the scope and nature of their work. An ongoing current debate in the denomination is over the purpose, function, and need for synods.\nSynods of the Presbyterian Church (USA).\nSee also the List of Presbyterian Church (USA) synods and presbyteries.\nGeneral Assembly.\nThe \"General Assembly\" is the highest governing body of the PC(USA). Until the 216th assembly met in Richmond, Virginia in 2004, the General Assembly met annually; since 2004, the General Assembly has met biennially in even-numbered years. It consists of commissioners elected by presbyteries (not synods), and its voting membership is proportioned with parity between elders and Ministers of Word and Sacrament. There are many important responsibilities of the General Assembly. Among them, \"The Book of Order\" lists these four:\nElected officials.\nThe General Assembly elects a moderator at each assembly who moderates the rest of the sessions of that assembly meeting and continues to serve until the next assembly convenes (two years later) to elect a new moderator or co-moderator. Currently, the denomination is served by Co-Moderators Cecelia Armstrong and Anthony Larson, who were elected at the 226th General Assembly (2024). They followed Ruth Santana-Grace and Shavon Starling-Louis, elected in 2022. They followed Elona Street-Stewart and Gregory Bentley, elected in 2020. At the 223rd Assembly in St Louis, MO, Co-Moderators Vilmarie Cintr\u00f3n-Olivieri and Cindy Kohmann were elected. See a complete listing of past moderators at another Wikipedia Article.\nA Stated Clerk of the General Assembly is elected to one or more four-year terms and is responsible for the Office of the General Assembly which conducts the ecclesiastical work of the church. The Office of the General Assembly carries out most of the ecumenical functions and all of the constitutional functions at the Assembly. The Stated Clerks since reunion are: James E. Andrews (1984\u20131996), Clifton Kirkpatrick (1996\u20132008), Gradye Parsons (2008\u20132016), J. Herbert Nelson (2016\u20132023), Bronwen Boswell (2023\u20132024) (interim), and Jihyun Oh (2024\u2013).\nBronwen Boswell was appointed Acting Stated Clerk in June 2023 to serve the remaining year of Nelson's term. She was ineligible to apply for the stated clerk position in 2024, and has limited responsibilities focused primarily on completing plans for the 2024 GA and unification of the OGA and PMA. Her partial characterization of the attempted assassination of Donald Trump as \"two lives lost at a Pennsylvania rally\" blurs the distinction between perpetrator and victim, unlike definitions of mass shootings that often do not include the shooter in the body count. Bronwen's political perspective on the shooting has been contrasted with purely nonpolitical perspectives from other denominations.\nJihyun Oh was installed in July 2024 as the Stated Clerk of the General Assembly, and promoted by the Unification Commission (UC) in October 2024 to lead the interim unified agency. The UC is overseeing unification of OGA and PMA, that was planned for summer of 2025, and subsequently slated for the week of November 17, 2025. The Committee on the Office of the General Assembly (COGA) had oversight over the Stated Clerk and OGA, but COGA and PMAB were dissolved on December 31, 2024, with UC taking over their responsibilities. A new Unification Management Office is managing the integration of PMA and OGA. In March 2024, the former OGA Communications Director was named PCUSA Communications Director and the former PMA Communications Director was named PMA Vision Integration &amp; Constituent Service Manager.\nNelson is the first African American to be elected to the office, and is a third-generation Presbyterian pastor. Nelson announced he would not seek re-election to a third term, and stepped down as Stated Clerk in June 2023, a year before his second term ended. Reported tensions that likely influenced the decision to resign include struggling efforts since 2016 to unify the OGA and PMA agencies, and struggling efforts to return to normal following the pandemic.\nThe Stated Clerk is also responsible for the records of the denomination, a function formalized in 1925 when the General Assembly created the \"Department of Historical Research and Conservation\" as part of the Office of the General Assembly. The current \"Department of History\" is also known as the Presbyterian Historical Society.\nStructure.\nSix (now five) agencies carry out the work of the General Assembly, two of which (OGA and PMA) are being unified, with a new staff reporting structure that seems to imply that OGA and PMA have been dissolved. These are the Office of the General Assembly (OGA), the Presbyterian Publishing Corporation, the Presbyterian Investment and Loan Program, the Board of Pensions, the Presbyterian Foundation, and the Presbyterian Mission Agency (PMA) (formerly known as the General Assembly Mission Council).\nThe Board of Pensions is the oldest and largest of the PCUSA agencies, originally founded in 1717 as the Fund for Pious Uses. The Board provides those who work for congregations and affiliated ministries with healthcare, retirement, and income protection benefits. With over $12 billion in assets, the Board of Pensions is one of the largest Church Plans in the United States. The General Assembly directly elects the Board of Directors and the President. The current President is Frank Clark Spencer. In addition to its benefits program, the Board's education department runs CREDO conferences, the PCUSA's largest in service education program for ministers. The Board's Assistance Program provides financial assistance in the form of income and housing supplements, emergency grants, and debt reduction to current and retired members based on need.\nThe Presbyterian Mission Agency Board (PMAB) (formerly General Assembly Mission Council) was dissolved on December 31, 2024, by a motion approved at a specially called Unification Commission meeting on August 16, two days ahead of the planned PMAB annual retreat. The timing of this motion allowed PMAB to celebrate their work in person, as their only remaining meeting, scheduled for October 29\u201330, 2024, was not in-person. The PMAB had 30 members (20 voting; 10 non-voting). The role of PMA President and Executive Director was phased out, effective October 10\u201331, 2024, with both PMA and OGA staff now reporting to the Rev. Jihyun Oh, who has been named as Stated Clerk of the General Assembly and Executive Director of the Interim Unified Agency (IUA). The announcement did not include any comment from the PMA President and Executive Director, or even any indication that she had been notified of the changes and agreed with the terms. Details of the IUA leadership selection process have not been disclosed. The constitution requires maintaining an office of the Stated Clerk (Book of Order G\u20133.0501c), but not an office of the PMA Executive Director. The 2025 and 2026 budgets (page 18), approved by GA in July 2024, fund the office of the PMA Executive Director at $4,524,347 and $4,613,383, respectively.\nThe budget (page 26) anticipated proposing a $5 million reduction over 2 years at the Unification Commission's October 2024 meeting in order to balance. At this meeting, the UC announced informally that the budget had been scrubbed resulting in a planned small reduction in force. On November 5, Jihyun Oh announced various program reconfigurations that would balance the 2025 and 2026 budgets, including the planned $5 million reduction. Further details were announced on November 13, including 12 layoffs, and two vacant OGA positions to remain unfilled. The November 5 announcement had also warned of further layoffs anticipated in 2025 related to restructuring. On February 5, 2025, Jihyun Oh announced 35 additional layoffs, where \"all World Mission staff positions will be revised, and some will be concluded,\" reducing staff from 79 to 44 in new roles as Global Ecumenical Liaisons, by the end of March 2025.\nThese layoffs were intended to \"help us be more nimble in responding to the ongoing shifts in the world and in the church while continuing to foster deeper and broader relationships with faith communities worldwide,\" based on \"forecasting with the help of actuarial consultants for five years\" to prevent \"a bigger crisis in the near future\". PC(USA) faces a backlash over the layoffs from critics who note that the 2024 General Assembly called for retaining mission co-workers and funded their budget at 60. On February 7, the Rev. Mienda Uriarte, director of World Mission, explained that \"the redesign aims to harmonize compensation and eliminate perceived inequity, thereby enhancing our organizational coherence and employee morale.\"\nPreviously, the General Assembly had elected the executive director of the Presbyterian Mission Agency, as the top administrator overseeing the mission work of the PC(USA). Past Executive Director of the PMA is Ruling Elder Linda Bryant Valentine(2006\u20132015), and Interim RE Tony De La Rosa. Elected in 2018 is Teaching Elder Diane Givens Moffett (2018\u20132024).\nThe General Assembly Permanent Judicial Commission (GAPJC) is the highest Church court of the denomination. It is composed of one member elected by the General Assembly from each of its constituent synods (16). It has ultimate appellate jurisdiction over all Synod Permanent Judicial Commission cases involving issues of Church Constitution, and original jurisdiction over a small range of cases. The General Assembly Permanent Judicial Commission issues Authoritative Interpretations of The Constitution of the Presbyterian Church (USA) through its decisions.\nAffiliated seminaries.\nThe denomination maintains affiliations with ten seminaries in the United States. These are:\nTwo other seminaries are related to the PC(USA) by covenant agreement: Auburn Theological Seminary in New York, New York, and Evangelical Seminary of Puerto Rico in San Juan, Puerto Rico.\nThere are numerous colleges and universities throughout the United States affiliated with PC(USA). For a complete list, see the article Association of Presbyterian Colleges and Universities. For more information, see the article PC(USA) seminaries.\nWhile not affiliated with the PC(USA), Fuller Theological Seminary has educated many candidates for PC(USA) ministry and its former president, Mark Labberton, is an ordained minister of the PC(USA).\nDemographics.\nBefore the United Presbyterian Church in the USA merged with the Presbyterian Church in the United States there were 2,351,119 + 814,931 = 3,166,050 members in 1982, and 3,131,228 members afterwards in 1983. Statistics show steady decline since then. (The combined membership of the PCUS and United Presbyterian Church peaked in 1965 at 4.25 million communicant members.)\nAccording to the PC(USA) data collection, active membership is defined as a member who has been confirmed, or made similar profession of faith, has been baptized, and attends regularly. The reported data on active members do not include \"inactive members\". In addition to active members, the PC(USA) archives data on members who are baptized, but not confirmed, and who are inactive. For example, in 2005, the PC(USA) reported 2.3 million active members, 318,291 baptized, but not confirmed, members, and 466,889 inactive members; the total number of members in 2005 was 3.1 million.\nThe PC (USA) has had the sharpest decline in their active membership among the Protestant denominations in U.S. The denomination lost more than a million active members between 2005 and 2019. As of 2024, the denomination reports having 1,045,848 active members and about 8,432 local congregations. The proposed 2025 and 2026 budgets are based on a projected 4.5% annual membership decline, which projects membership of 1,089,335 (2023), 1,040,315 (2024) and 993,501 (2025). The proposed 2025 per-capita revenue of $10,133,710 at $10.20 per member is unusual, being based on projected 2025 membership, rather than the traditional 2-year lag which would apply 2023 membership. The per-capita rate is set by the General Assembly based on actual reported membership, so it is also unusual that 2023 membership was not reported in time for the 2024 General Assembly meeting. As of August 2024, temporary staff is working rolls and statistics due to an extended medical leave.\nThe average local Presbyterian Church has 128 members (the mean in 2023). About 22% of the total congregations report between 1 and 25 members. Another 22% report between 26 and 50 members. Another 24% report between 51 and 100 members. The average worship attendance of a local Presbyterian congregation (2023) is 52 (41% of members). The largest congregation in the PC(USA) is Peachtree Presbyterian Church in Atlanta, Georgia, with a reported membership of 7,535 (2023) and attendance of 1,371. Bel Air Presbyterian Church reports the highest attendance, 5,074, with membership of 1,636. It was reported that about 34% of the Presbyterian members nationwide are over 71 years old (2024). Membership, attendance, and demographics may be skewed because about 20% of local churches representing an estimated 10% of members (generally smaller churches) did not report statistics in 2022.\nMost PC(USA) members are white (88% in 2023). Other racial and ethnic members include African-Americans (4.6%), Asians (3.7%), Hispanics (1.7%), and others (2%). Despite declines in the total membership of the PC(USA), the percentage of racial-ethnic minority members has stayed about the same since 1995. The ratio of female members (about 60%) to male members (40%) has also remained stable since the mid-1960s.\nSummary membership statistics for 2023 are based on only 65% of churches reporting; for non-reporting churches, the last-reported membership figure is used. Reported membership based on gender: 904,780; based on age: 892,107. The gender membership demographics show an anomalous 5% increase in men from 348,231 in 2022 to 365,632 in 2023, despite total membership decreasing by 4%. This supposed increase in men was initially reported as a notable area of growth and a reason for hope, but that claim has since been removed. The church-trends database and the corrected 2023 GA Minutes, show 384,231 male members in 2022, differing by transposing two digits, which is in line with the 4% total membership decrease from 2022 to 2023.\nBeliefs.\nThe Presbyterian Church (USA) adheres to Reformed theology. The Book of Order of the Presbyterian Church teaches:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;# The election of the people of God for service as well as for salvation;\nWorship.\nThe session of the local congregation has a great deal of freedom in the style and ordering of worship within the guidelines set forth in the Directory for Worship section of the \"Book of Order\". Worship varies from congregation to congregation. The order may be very traditional and highly liturgical, or it may be very simple and informal. This variance is not unlike that seen in the \"High Church\" and \"Low Church\" styles of the Anglican Church. The \"Book of Order\" suggests a worship service ordered around five themes: \"gathering around the Word, proclaiming the Word, responding to the Word, the sealing of the Word, and bearing and following the Word into the world.\" Prayer is central to the service and may be silent, spoken, sung, or read in unison (including the Lord's Prayer). Music plays a large role in most PC(USA) worship services and ranges from chant to traditional Protestant hymns, to classical sacred music, to more modern music, depending on the preference of the individual church and is offered prayerfully and not \"for entertainment or artistic display\". Scripture is read and usually preached upon. An offering is usually taken.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The pastor has certain responsibilities which are not subject to the authority of the session. In a particular service of worship the pastor is responsible for:\nThe pastor may confer with a worship committee in planning particular services of worship.\u2014\u200a\nThe Directory for Worship in the Book of Order provides the directions for what must be, or may be included in worship. During the 20th century, Presbyterians were offered optional use of liturgical books:\nFor more information, see Liturgical book of the Presbyterian Church (USA)\nIn regard to vestments, the Directory for Worship leaves that decision up to the ministers. Thus, on a given Sunday morning service, a congregation may see the minister leading worship in street clothes, Geneva gown, or an alb. Among the Paleo-orthodoxy and emerging church Presbyterians, clergy are moving away from the traditional black Geneva gown and reclaiming not only the more ancient Eucharist vestments of alb and chasuble, but also cassock and surplice (typically a full-length Old English style surplice which resembles the Celtic alb, an ungirdled liturgical tunic of the old Gallican Rite).\nThe Service for the Lord's Day.\nThe Service for the Lord's Day is the name given to the general format or ordering of worship in the Presbyterian Church as outlined in its Constitution's Book of Order. There is a great deal of liberty given toward worship in that denomination, so while the underlying order and components for the Service for the Lord's Day is extremely common, it varies from congregation to congregation, region to region.\nInfluence.\nPresbyterians are among the wealthiest religious groups and are disproportionately represented in American business, law, and politics. Many of the nation's oldest educational institutions, such as Princeton University, were founded by Presbyterian clergy or were associated with the Presbyterian Church.\nHistorically, Presbyterians were overrepresented among American scientific elite and Nobel Prize winners. According to \"Scientific Elite: Nobel Laureates in the United States\" by Harriet Zuckerman, between 1901 and 1972, 72% of American Nobel Prize laureates have come from a Protestant background, mostly from Episcopalian, Presbyterian or Lutheran background.\nThe \"Boston Brahmins\", who were regarded as the nation's social and cultural elites, were often associated with the American upper class, Harvard University; and the Episcopal and the Presbyterian Church. Old money in the United States was typically associated with White Anglo-Saxon Protestant (\"WASP\") status, particularly with the Episcopal and Presbyterian Church.\nMany Presbyterians have been Presidents, the latest being Ronald Reagan; and they represent 13% of the U.S. Senate, despite being only 2.2% (under 0.4% as of 2021) of the general population.\nPresbyterians are among the wealthiest Christian denominations in the United States, Presbyterians tend also to be better educated and they have a high number of graduate (64%) and post-graduate degrees (26%) per capita. According to a 2014 study by the Pew Research Center, Presbyterians ranked as the fourth most financially successful religious group in the United States, with 32% of Presbyterians living in households with incomes of at least $100,000.\nMissions.\nThe Presbyterian Church (USA) has, in the past, been a leading United States denomination in mission work, and many hospitals, clinics, colleges and universities worldwide trace their origins to the pioneering work of Presbyterian missionaries who founded them more than a century ago.\nIn 2008, the church supported about 215 (70 as of 2021) missionaries abroad annually with significant further reductions planned for February 2025, as noted above. Many churches sponsor missionaries abroad at the session level (the local church level), and these are not included in official statistics.\nThe denomination also builds and maintains relationships with Presbyterian, Reformed and other churches around the world, even if this is not usually considered missions.\nThe PC(USA) is a leader in disaster assistance relief and also participates in or relates to work in other countries through ecumenical relationships, in what is usually considered not missions, but deaconship.\nAt the 225th General Assembly in 2022, a three-year process was started to unify the Presbyterian Mission Agency with the Office of General Assembly. After announcing large cuts a months earlier, in February 2025 it was announced that the Presbyterian World Mission would be closed entirely in March, with 54 remaining missionaries laid off and a handful offered alternate roles within the Presbyterian Mission Agency/Interim Unified Agency.\nEcumenical relationships and full communion partnerships.\nThe General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church (USA) determines and approves ecumenical statements, agreements, and maintains correspondence with other Presbyterian and Reformed bodies, other Christians churches, alliances, councils, and consortia. Ecumenical statements and agreements are subject to the ratification of the presbyteries. The following are some of the major ecumenical agreements and partnerships.\nThe church is committed to \"engage in bilateral and multilateral dialogues with other churches and traditions in order to remove barriers of misunderstanding and establish common affirmations.\" As of 2012 it is in dialogue with the Episcopal Church, the Moravian Church, the Korean Presbyterian Church in America, the Cumberland Presbyterian Church, the Cumberland Presbyterian Church in America, and the US Conference of Catholic Bishops. It also participates in international dialogues through the World Council of Churches and the World Communion of Reformed Churches. The most recent international dialogues include Pentecostal churches, the Seventh-day Adventist Church, Orthodox Church in America, and others.\nIn 2011 the National Presbyterian Church in Mexico, in 2012 the Mizoram Presbyterian Church and in 2015 the Independent Presbyterian Church of Brazil along with the Evangelical Presbyterian and Reformed Church in Peru severed ties with the PCUSA because of the PCUSA's teaching with regard to homosexuality.\nNational and international ecumenical memberships.\nThe Presbyterian Church (USA) is in corresponding partnership with the National Council of Churches, the World Communion of Reformed Churches, and the World Council of Churches. It is a member of Churches for Middle East Peace.\nFormula of agreement.\nIn 1997 the PCUSA and three other churches of Reformation heritage \u2013 the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, the Reformed Church in America and the United Church of Christ \u2013 acted on an ecumenical proposal of historic importance, known as \"A Formula of Agreement\". The timing reflected a doctrinal consensus which had been developing over the past thirty-two years coupled with an increasing urgency for the church to proclaim a gospel of unity in contemporary society. In light of identified doctrinal consensus, desiring to bear visible witness to the unity of the Church, and hearing the call to engage together in God's mission, it was recommended:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;That the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, the Presbyterian Church (USA), the Reformed Church in America, and the United Church of Christ declare on the basis of A Common Calling and their adoption of this A Formula of Agreement that they are in full communion with one another. Thus, each church is entering into or affirming full communion with three other churches.\u2014\u200a\nThe term \"full communion\" is understood here to specifically mean that the four churches:\nThe agreement assumed the doctrinal consensus articulated in A Common Calling:The Witness of Our Reformation Churches in North America Today, and is to be viewed in concert with that document. The purpose of A Formula of Agreement is to elucidate the complementarity of affirmation and admonition as the basic principle of entering into full communion and the implications of that action as described in A Common Calling.\nThe 209th General Assembly (1997) approved A Formula of Agreement and in 1998 the 210th General Assembly declared full communion among these Protestant bodies.\nWorld Communion of Reformed Churches.\nAs of \u00a02010,[ [update]] the World Alliance of Reformed Churches merged with the Reformed Ecumenical Council to form the World Communion of Reformed Churches. The result was a form of full communion similar to that outline in the Formula of Agreement, including orderly exchange of ministers.\nChurches Uniting in Christ.\nThe PC(USA) is one of nine denominations that joined to form the Consultation on Church Union, which initially sought a merger of the denominations. In 1998 the Seventh Plenary of the Consultation on Church Union approved a document \"Churches in Covenant Communion: The Church of Christ Uniting\" as a plan for the formation of a covenant communion of churches. In 2002 the nine denominations inaugurated the new relationship and became known as Churches Uniting in Christ. The partnership is considered incomplete until the partnering communions reconcile their understanding of ordination and devise an orderly exchange of clergy.\nControversies.\nHomosexuality.\nParagraph G-6.0106b of the Book of Order, which was adopted in 1996, prohibited the ordination of those who were not faithful in heterosexual marriage or chaste in singleness. This paragraph was included in the Book of Order from 1997 to 2011, and was commonly referred to by its pre-ratification designation, \"Amendment B\". Several attempts were made to remove this from the Book of Order, ultimately culminating in its removal in 2011. In 2011, the Presbyteries of the PC(USA) passed Amendment 10-A permitting congregations to ordain openly gay and lesbian elders and deacons, and allowing presbyteries to ordain ministers without reference to the fidelity/chastity provision, saying \"governing bodies shall be guided by Scripture and the confessions in applying standards to individual candidates\".\nMany Presbyterian scholars, pastors, and theologians have been heavily involved in the debate over homosexuality over the years. The Presbyterian Church of India's cooperation with the Presbyterian Church (USA) was dissolved in 2012 when the PC(USA) voted to ordain openly gay clergy to the ministry. In 2012, the PC(USA) granted permission, nationally, to begin ordaining openly gay and lesbian clergy.\nSince 1980, the More Light Churches Network has served many congregations and individuals within American Presbyterianism who promote the full participation of all people in the PC(USA) regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity. The Covenant Network of Presbyterians was formed in 1997 to support repeal of \"Amendment B\" and to encourage networking among like-minded clergy and congregations. Other organizations of Presbyterians, such as the Confessing Movement and the Alliance of Confessing Evangelicals, have organized on the other side of the issue to support the fidelity/chastity standard for ordination, which was removed in 2011.\nThe Presbyterian Church (USA) voted to allow same-sex marriages on June 19, 2014, during its 221st General Assembly, making it one of the largest Christian denominations in the world to allow same-sex unions. This vote lifted a previous ban, and allows pastors to perform marriages in jurisdictions where it is legal. Additionally, the Assembly approved amending the Book of Order that would change the definition of marriage from \"between a man and a woman\" to \"between two people, traditionally between a man and a woman\".\nGeneral Assembly 2006.\nThe 2006 \"Report of the Theological Task Force on Peace, Unity, and Purity of the Church\", in theory, attempted to find common ground. Some felt that the adoption of this report provided for a clear local option mentioned, while the Stated Clerk of the General Assembly, Clifton Kirkpatrick went on record as saying, \"Our standards have not changed. The rules of the Book of Order stay in force and all ordinations are still subject to review by higher governing bodies.\" The authors of the report stated that it is a compromise and return to the original Presbyterian culture of local controls. The recommendation for more control by local presbyteries and sessions is viewed by its opposition as a method for bypassing the constitutional restrictions currently in place concerning ordination and marriage, effectively making the constitutional \"standard\" entirely subjective.\nIn the General Assembly gathering of June 2006, Presbyterian voting Commissioners passed an \"authoritative interpretation\", recommended by the Theological Task Force, of the \"Book of Order\" (the church constitution). Some argued that this gave presbyteries the \"local option\" of ordaining or not ordaining anyone based on a particular presbytery's reading of the constitutional statute. Others argued that presbyteries have always had this responsibility and that this new ruling did not change but only clarified that responsibility. On June 20, 2006, the General Assembly voted 298 to 221 (or 57% to 43%) to approve such interpretation. In that same session on June 20, the General Assembly also voted 405 to 92 (with 4 abstentions) to uphold the constitutional standard for ordination requiring fidelity in marriage or chastity in singleness.\nGeneral Assembly 2008.\nThe General Assembly of 2008 took several actions related to homosexuality. The first action was to adopt a different translation of the Heidelberg Catechism from 1962, removing the words \"homosexual perversions\" among other changes. This will require the approval of the 2010 and 2012 General Assemblies as well as the votes of the presbyteries after the 2010 Assembly. The second action was to approve a new Authoritative Interpretation of G-6.0108 of the \"Book of Order\" allowing for the ordaining body to make decisions on whether or not a departure from the standards of belief of practice is sufficient to preclude ordination. Some argue that this creates \"local option\" on ordaining homosexual persons. The third action was to replace the text of \"Amendment B\" with new text: \"Those who are called to ordained service in the church, by their assent to the constitutional questions for ordination and installation (W-4.4003), pledge themselves to live lives obedient to Jesus Christ the Head of the Church, striving to follow where he leads through the witness of the Scriptures, and to understand the Scriptures through the instruction of the Confessions. In so doing, they declare their fidelity to the standards of the Church. Each governing body charged with examination for ordination or installation (G-14.0240 and G-14.0450) establishes the candidate's sincere efforts to adhere to these standards.\" This would have removed the \"fidelity and chastity\" clause. This third action failed to obtain the required approval of a majority of the presbyteries by June 2009. Fourth, a resolution was adopted to affirm the definition of marriage from Scripture and the Confessions as being between a man and a woman.\nGeneral Assembly 2010.\nIn July 2010, by a vote of 373 to 323, the General Assembly voted to propose to the presbyteries for ratification a constitutional amendment to remove from the Book of Order section G-6.0106.b. which included this explicit requirement for ordination: \"Among these standards is the requirement to live either in fidelity within the covenant of marriage between a man and a woman (W-4.9001), or chastity in singleness.\" This proposal required ratification by a majority of the 173 presbyteries within 12 months of the General Assembly's adjournment. A majority of presbytery votes was reached in May 2011. The constitutional amendment took effect July 10, 2011. This amendment shifted back to the ordaining body the responsibility for making decisions about whom they shall ordain and what they shall require of their candidates for ordination. It neither prevents nor imposes the use of the so-called \"fidelity and chastity\" requirement, but it removes that decision from the text of the constitution and places that judgment responsibility back upon the ordaining body where it had traditionally been prior to the insertion of the former G-6.0106.b. in 1997. Each ordaining body, the session for deacon or elder and the presbytery for minister, is now responsible to make its own interpretation of what scripture and the confessions require of ordained officers.\nGeneral Assembly 2014.\nIn June 2014, the General Assembly approved a change in the wording of its constitution defining marriage as a contract \"between a woman and a man\" to that of a contract \"between two people, traditionally a man and a woman\". It allowed gay and lesbian weddings within the church and further allowed clergy to perform same-sex weddings. That revision gave clergy the choice of whether or not to preside over same-sex marriages; clergy were not compelled to perform same-sex marriages.\nProperty ownership.\nPC(USA)'s book of order includes a \"trust clause\", under which the presbytery may assert a claim to the property of the congregation in the event of a congregational split, dissolution (closing), or disassociation from the PC(USA). In interpreting this trust clause, PC(USA) does not consider equitable factors such as the congregation's relative contribution to the financing of its property, or the relative percentage of members voting to disassociate. Nor does PC(USA) consider legal factors of state trust law such as written consent to the trust in the property's title deed or the congregation's bylaws. The trust clause does not prevent particular churches from leaving the denomination, but if they do, they may not be permitted to keep their real property unless by agreement with the presbytery. This provision, and a similar provision of the Episcopal Church, has been tested in various courts, with mixed results.\nIsraeli\u2013Palestinian conflict.\nIn June 2004, the General Assembly met in Richmond, Virginia, and adopted by a vote of 431\u201362 a resolution that called on the church's committee on Mission Responsibility through Investment (MRTI) \"to initiate a process of phased, selective divestment in multinational corporations operating in Israel\". The resolution also said \"the occupation ... has proven to be at the root of evil acts committed against innocent people on both sides of the conflict\". The church statement at the time noted that \"divestment is one of the strategies that U.S. churches used in the 1970s and 80s in a successful campaign to end apartheid in South Africa\".\nA second resolution, calling for an end to the construction of a wall by the state of Israel, passed. The resolution opposed to the construction of the Israeli West Bank barrier, regardless of its location, and opposed the United States government making monetary contribution to the construction. The General Assembly also adopted policies rejecting Christian Zionism and allowing the continued funding of conversionary activities aimed at Jews. Together, the resolutions caused tremendous dissent within the church and a sharp disconnect with the Jewish community. Leaders of several American Jewish groups communicated to the church their concerns about the use of economic leverages that apply specifically to companies operating in Israel. Some critics of the divestment policy accused church leaders of anti-Semitism.\nIn June 2006, after the General Assembly in Birmingham, Alabama changed policy (details), both pro-Israel and pro-Palestinian groups praised the resolution. Pro-Israel groups, who had written General Assembly commissioners to express their concerns about a corporate engagement/divestment strategy focused on Israel, praised the new resolution, saying that it reflected the church stepping back from a policy that singled out companies working in Israel. Pro-Palestinian groups said that the church maintained the opportunity to engage and potentially divest from companies that support the Israeli occupation, because such support would be considered inappropriate according to the customary MRTI process.\nIn August 2011, the American National Middle Eastern Presbyterian Caucus (NMEPC) endorsed the boycott, divestment, and sanctions (BDS) campaign against Israel.\nIn January 2014, The PC(USA) published \"Zionism unsettled\", which was commended as \"a valuable opportunity to explore the political ideology of Zionism\". One critic claimed it was anti-Zionist and characterized the Israeli\u2013Palestinian as a conflict fueled by a \"pathology inherent in Zionism\". The Simon Wiesenthal Center described the study guide as \"a hit-piece outside all norms of interfaith dialogue. It is a compendium of distortions, ignorance and outright lies \u2013 that tragically has emanated too often from elites within this church\". The PC(USA) subsequently withdrew the publication from sale on its website.\nOn June 20, 2014, the General Assembly in Detroit approved a measure (310\u2013303) calling for divestment from stock in Caterpillar, Hewlett-Packard and Motorola Solutions in protest of Israeli policies on the West Bank. The vote was immediately and sharply criticized by the American Jewish Committee which accused the General Assembly of acting out of anti-Semitic motives. Proponents of the measure strongly denied the accusations.\nIn June 2022, at its 225th General Assembly, the church's Committee on International Engagement voted to declare Israel an apartheid state and designate Nakba Day. The committee also called for an end to Israel's blockade of the Gaza Strip and affirmed the \"right of all people to live and worship peacefully\" in Jerusalem.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It may be garnished with either a pineapple wedge, maraschino cherry, or both. The drink originated in Puerto Rico.\nEtymology.\nThe name \"pi\u00f1a colada\" (Spanish) literally means \"strained pineapple\", a reference to the freshly pressed and strained pineapple juice used in the drink's preparation.\nHistory.\nFolk origins.\nThe earliest known folktale states that in the 19th century, Puerto Rican pirate Roberto Cofres\u00ed, to boost the morale of his crew, gave them a beverage or cocktail that contained coconut, pineapple, and white rum. This was what would be later known as \"pi\u00f1a colada\". With his death in 1825, the recipe for the beverage was lost.\nFirst mentions.\nIn 1922, \"Travel\" magazine described \"pi\u00f1a colada\" as sugar, lime, and ice mixed in with pineapple juice and Bacardi rum.\nIn 1924, National Geographic magazine, reporting from Puerto Rico, mentioned a pineapple juice and crushed ice beverage, known locally as \"pi\u00f1a fr\u00eda\" (cold pineapple)\".\"\nIn 1950, \"The New York Times\" reported that \"Drinks in the West Indies range from Martinique's famous rum punch to Cuba's pina colada (rum, pineapple and coconut milk).\"\nCreation.\nIn 1954, University of Puerto Rico Professor Ramon L\u00f3pez Irizarry invented a new, improved method for the extraction of coconut cream. He patented the process and created Coco L\u00f3pez, a sweet, creamy coconut cream, which was used in the invention of the pi\u00f1a colada in Puerto Rico. This product, sold today as \"Cream of Coconut\", is widely available around the world, and is most commonly used to make the cocktail. \nThe Caribe Hilton Hotel claims Ram\u00f3n \"Monchito\" Marrero created the pi\u00f1a colada in 1954 while a bartender at the hotel. According to this account, Marrero finally settled upon the recipe for the pi\u00f1a colada, which he felt captured the true nature and essence of Puerto Rico. The hotel was presented with a proclamation in 2004 by Puerto Rico Governor Sila M. Calder\u00f3n celebrating the drink's 50th anniversary.\nA Spaniard by the name of Ricardo Garc\u00eda also claims to have invented the drink in 1953, while working at the Caribe Hilton Hotel in San Juan. \nBarrachina, a restaurant in Puerto Rico, says that \"a traditional Spanish bartender Don Ram\u00f3n Portas Mingot in 1963 created what became the world's famous drink: the Pi\u00f1a Colada.\"\nIn 1978, Puerto Rico proclaimed the cocktail to be its official drink.\nPreparation.\nAs recounted by his friends in Jos\u00e9 L. D\u00edaz de Villegas's book, the original Monchito recipe was to pour 85 grams of cream of coconut, 170 grams of pineapple juice and 43 grams of white rum into a blender or shaker with crushed ice, blend or shake very well until smooth, then pour into chilled glass and garnish with pineapple wedge and/or a maraschino cherry.\nThere are many recipes for pi\u00f1a colada. The International Bartenders Association specifies it as:\nIngredients\nMethod\nMix with crushed ice in blender until smooth, then pour into a chilled glass, garnish and serve. Alternately, the three main components can simply be added to a cocktail glass with ice cubes.\nIn San Juan, Puerto Rico, a different recipe is used:\n\"Ingredients\"\nMethod\nFreeze pineapple juice before use. In a blender, combine cream of coconut, frozen pineapple juice, heavy cream and rum. Pour in a desired 12-ounce container and use a cherry and fresh pineapple for a garnish.\nVariations.\nDifferent proportions of the core ingredients, as well as different types of rum, may all be used in the pi\u00f1a colada. Frozen pi\u00f1a coladas are also served. Other named variations include\nIn popular culture.\nIn the United States, National Pi\u00f1a Colada Day is celebrated on 10 July.\nThe cocktail gained worldwide fame after Rupert Holmes' 1979 song, \"Escape (The Pi\u00f1a Colada Song)\", became an international hit.\nPi\u00f1a coladas are referred to in the 2023 Eurovision entry \"Cha Cha Cha\" by Finnish rapper K\u00e4\u00e4rij\u00e4, in which he describes drinking pi\u00f1a coladas after an exhausting week, before letting himself go on the dancefloor. The song led to an increased popularity of the drink in Finland.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is named after the live music circuit in which most associated bands developed their sound: inner-city and suburban pubs. These often noisy, hot, small and crowded venues favoured loud, riff-based heavy rock.\nAustralian pub rock emerged in the early 1970s, with bands such as Billy Thorpe &amp; the Aztecs, Buffalo, Coloured Balls and Blackfeather pioneering the sound by incorporating hard rock and blues rock, and occasionally elements of progressive rock and psychedelic rock. It developed separately from British pub rock, with the Australian sound being heavier, bluesier and more hard-edged. Later acts such as AC/DC, Rose Tattoo and Cold Chisel expanded the sound further and achieved mainstream success.\nIn a few Australian cities, particularly Melbourne, pub rock was associated with the Sharpies youth subculture.\nHistory.\nBackground.\nThe emergence of the Australian version of the pub rock genre and the related pub circuit was the result of several interconnected factors. From the 1950s to the 1970s, mainly because of restrictive state liquor licensing laws, only a small proportion of live pop and rock music in Australia was performed on licensed premises (mostly private clubs or discotheques); the majority of concerts were held in non-licensed venues like community, church or municipal halls. These concerts and dances were 'all-ages' events\u2014often with adult supervision\u2014and alcohol was not served.\nDuring the 1960s, however, Australian states began liberalising their licensing laws. Sunday Observance Acts were repealed, pub opening hours were extended, discriminatory regulations \u2014 such as the long-standing ban on women entering or drinking in public bars \u2014 were removed, and in the 1970s the age of legal majority was lowered from 21 to 18. Concurrently, the members of the so-called \"Baby Boomer\" generation \u2014 who were the main audience for pop and rock music \u2014 were reaching their late teens and early twenties, and were thus able to enter such licensed premises. Pub owners soon realised that providing live music (which was often free) would draw young people to pubs in large numbers, and regular rock performances soon became a fixture at many pubs.\nFirst bands emerge.\nIn the early 1970s, Sydney-based groups such as Billy Thorpe &amp; The Aztecs, Blackfeather and Buffalo pioneered the Australian pub rock sound. Billy Thorpe &amp; The Aztecs consisted of Thorpe on lead vocals and guitar, Jimmy Thompson on drums, Paul Wheeler on bass guitar and Lobby Loyde (ex-Purple Hearts, Wild Cherries) on lead guitar. They released a cover version of Willie Dixon's \"Good Morning, School Girl\". They developed a heavy sound and in July 1970, Warren 'Pig' Morgan (piano, backing vocals) had joined and the band recorded \"The Hoax Is Over\", which was released in January 1971. Thorpe described their sound: \"[It was] like we were standing on a pair of Boeing 747 engines. It cracked the foundations and broke windows in neighbouring buildings\".\nBy early 1971, Blackfeather consisted of Neale Johns on lead vocals, John Robinson on lead guitar (ex-Lonely Ones, Monday's Children, Dave Miller Set), Robert Fortesque on bass guitar, and Alexander Kash on drums. Their debut album, \"At the Mountains of Madness\", appeared in April 1971. In May they had a hit with \"Seasons of Change\", which peaked at No.\u00a015 on the \"Go-Set\" National Top\u00a040 Singles Chart. Buffalo formed in August 1971 by Dave Tice on co-lead vocals (ex-Head) with Paul Balbi on drums, John Baxter on guitar and Peter Wells on bass guitar. Their debut album, \"Dead Forever...\", appeared in June the following year. According to Australian rock music journalist, Ed Nimmervoll, \"The seeds for Australian heavy rock can be traced back to two important sources, Billy Thorpe's Seventies Aztecs and Sydney band Buffalo\". In 1972, Aztecs member Lobby Lloyd formed Coloured Balls, which became the favoured band of the sharpies youth subculture.\nNotable pub-rock venues include the Largs Pier Hotel and the Governor Hindmarsh Hotel in Adelaide; the Royal Antler Hotel in Narrabeen, Sydney; the Civic Hotel in Sydney's city centre; the Star Hotel in Newcastle, New South Wales; and the Station Hotel in Prahran, Melbourne, which was one of the premier pub-rock venues in Australia for more than two decades. Additionally, Poyntons Carlton Club Hotel in Carlton was Melbourne's first Sunday night live pub-rock venue; Charles Hotel in Perth is the only remaining pub-rock venue in Perth.\nExpansion of the sound.\nMany city and suburban pubs gained renown for their support of live music, and many prominent Australian bands \u2014 including AC/DC, Cold Chisel, The Angels and The Dingoes \u2014 developed their style at these venues in the early days of their careers. Australian musicologist Ian McFarlane described how AC/DC took \"the raw energy of Aussie pub rock, extend its basic guidelines, serve it up to a teenybop \"Countdown\" audience and still reap the benefits of the live circuit by packing out the pubs\". He found that Cold Chisel \"fused a combination of rockabilly, hard rock and rough-house soul'n'blues that was defiantly Australian in outlook\". He noted The Angels had \"a profound effect on the Australian live music scene of the late 1970s/early 1980s. [They] helped redefine the Australian pub rock tradition ... [their] brand of no-frills, hard-driving boogie rock attracted pub goers in unprecedented numbers\". The Dingoes provided a \"spirited combination of R&amp;B, country and red-hot rock'n'roll was imbued with a delightful sense of time and place\" according to McFarlane.\nAs the pub-rock phenomenon expanded, hundreds of hotels in capital cities and major towns began providing regular live music, and a thriving circuit evolved, enabling bands to tour up and down the eastern and southern coast of Australia from North Queensland to South Australia.\nA band like Hunters &amp; Collectors, for example, saw their sound harden from their arty origins (which included a brass section, experimental percussion, and complex arrangements) to a more straightforward rock sound with emphasis on drums, bass, and simple guitar riffs; it was a sound that more suited the beer barns they were to play in over their extensive touring career.\nThough Australia has a relatively small population, the proportionally high number of venues that bands could play in, mainly along the Eastern coast, meant that a band could tour extensively, often playing every night for long periods. This would allow bands such as AC/DC, Cold Chisel, INXS, Midnight Oil, Rose Tattoo and others to build their reputation and take their live skills into large venues in the US and Europe with ease.\nSeveral Australian pub rock bands, including Cosmic Psychos and feedtime, directly influenced the emergent grunge scene in the United States in the late 1980s and early 1990s. In the 2010s, a new generation of Australian bands revived the Australian pub rock sound, including Bad//Dreems, Amyl and the Sniffers and The Chats.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nGeneral references.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "25037", "revid": "42307126", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25037", "title": "Phonation", "text": "Process of creating phonetic sounds\nThe term phonation has slightly different meanings depending on the subfield of phonetics. Among some phoneticians, \"phonation\" is the process by which the vocal folds produce certain sounds through quasi-periodic vibration. This is the definition used among those who study laryngeal anatomy and physiology and speech production in general. Phoneticians in other subfields, such as linguistic phonetics, call this process \"voicing\", and use the term \"phonation\" to refer to any oscillatory state of any part of the larynx that modifies the airstream, of which voicing is just one example. Voiceless and supra-glottal phonations are included under this definition.\nVoicing.\nThe phonatory process, or voicing, occurs when air is expelled from the lungs through the glottis, creating a pressure drop across the larynx. When this drop becomes sufficiently large, the vocal folds start to oscillate. The minimum pressure drop required to achieve phonation is called the phonation threshold pressure (PTP), and for humans with normal vocal folds, it is approximately 2\u20133\u00a0cm. The motion of the vocal folds during oscillation is mostly lateral, though there is also some superior component as well. However, there is almost no motion along the length of the vocal folds. The oscillation of the vocal folds serves to modulate the pressure and flow of the air through the larynx, and this modulated airflow is the main component of the sound of most voiced phones.\nThe sound that the larynx produces is a harmonic series. In other words, it consists of a fundamental tone (called the fundamental frequency, the main acoustic cue for the percept pitch) accompanied by harmonic overtones, which are multiples of the fundamental frequency. According to the source\u2013filter theory, the resulting sound excites the resonance chamber that is the vocal tract to produce the individual speech sounds.\nThe vocal folds will not oscillate if they are not sufficiently close to one another, are not under sufficient tension or under too much tension, or if the pressure drop across the larynx is not sufficiently large. In linguistics, a phone is called voiceless if there is no phonation during its occurrence. In speech, voiceless phones are associated with vocal folds that are elongated, highly tensed, and placed laterally (abducted) when compared to vocal folds during phonation.\nFundamental frequency, the main acoustic cue for the percept \"pitch\", can be varied through a variety of means. Large scale changes are accomplished by increasing the tension in the vocal folds through contraction of the cricothyroid muscle. Smaller changes in tension can be effected by contraction of the thyroarytenoid muscle or changes in the relative position of the thyroid and cricoid cartilages, as may occur when the larynx is lowered or raised, either volitionally or through movement of the tongue to which the larynx is attached via the hyoid bone. In addition to tension changes, fundamental frequency is also affected by the pressure drop across the larynx, which is mostly affected by the pressure in the lungs, and will also vary with the distance between the vocal folds. Variation in fundamental frequency is used linguistically to produce intonation and tone.\nThere are currently two main theories as to how vibration of the vocal folds is initiated: the myoelastic theory and the aerodynamic theory. These two theories are not in contention with one another and it is quite possible that both theories are true and operating simultaneously to initiate and maintain vibration. A third theory, the neurochronaxic theory, was in considerable vogue in the 1950s, but has since been largely discredited.\nMyoelastic and aerodynamic theory.\nThe myoelastic theory states that when the vocal cords are brought together and breath pressure is applied to them, the cords remain closed until the pressure beneath them, the subglottic pressure, is sufficient to push them apart, allowing air to escape and reducing the pressure enough for the muscle tension recoil to pull the folds back together again. The pressure builds up once again until the cords are pushed apart, and the whole cycle keeps repeating itself. The rate at which the cords open and close, the number of cycles per second, determines the pitch of the phonation.\nThe aerodynamic theory is based on the Bernoulli energy law in fluids. The theory states that when a stream of breath is flowing through the glottis while the arytenoid cartilages are held together (by the action of the interarytenoid muscles), a push-pull effect is created on the vocal fold tissues that maintains self-sustained oscillation. The push occurs during glottal opening, when the glottis is convergent, and the pull occurs during glottal closing, when the glottis is divergent. Such an effect causes a transfer of energy from the airflow to the vocal fold tissues which overcomes losses by dissipation and sustain the oscillation. The amount of lung pressure needed to begin phonation is defined by Titze as the oscillation threshold pressure. During glottal closure, the air flow is cut off until breath pressure pushes the folds apart and the flow starts up again, causing the cycles to repeat.\nThe textbook entitled Myoelastic Aerodynamic Theory of Phonation by Ingo Titze credits Janwillem van den Berg as the originator of the theory and provides detailed mathematical development of the theory.\nNeurochronaxic theory.\nThis theory states that the frequency of the vocal fold vibration is determined by the chronaxie of the recurrent nerve, and not by breath pressure or muscular tension. Advocates of this theory thought that every single vibration of the vocal folds was due to an impulse from the recurrent laryngeal nerves and that the acoustic center in the brain regulated the speed of vocal fold vibration. Speech and voice scientists have long since abandoned this theory as the muscles have been shown to not be able to contract fast enough to accomplish the vibration. In addition, persons with paralyzed vocal folds can produce phonation, which would not be possible according to this theory. Phonation occurring in excised larynges would also not be possible according to this theory.\nState of the glottis.\nIn linguistic phonetic treatments of phonation, such as those of Peter Ladefoged, phonation was considered to be a matter of points on a continuum of tension and closure of the vocal cords. More intricate mechanisms were occasionally described, but they were difficult to investigate, and until recently the state of the glottis and phonation were considered to be nearly synonymous.\nIf the vocal cords are completely relaxed, with the arytenoid cartilages apart for maximum airflow, the cords do not vibrate. This is voiceless phonation, and is extremely common with obstruents. If the arytenoids are pressed together for glottal closure, the vocal cords block the airstream, producing stop sounds such as the glottal stop. In between there is a sweet spot of maximum vibration. Also, the existence of an optimal glottal shape for ease of phonation has been shown, at which the lung pressure required to initiate the vocal cord vibration is minimum. This is modal voice, and is the normal state for vowels and sonorants in all the world's languages. However, the aperture of the arytenoid cartilages, and therefore the tension in the vocal cords, is one of degree between the end points of open and closed, and there are several intermediate situations utilized by various languages to make contrasting sounds.\nFor example, Gujarati has vowels with a partially lax phonation called breathy voice or murmured voice (transcribed in IPA with a subscript umlaut ), while Burmese has vowels with a partially tense phonation called creaky voice or laryngealized voice (transcribed in IPA with a subscript tilde ). The Jalapa dialect of Mazatec is unusual in contrasting both with modal voice in a three-way distinction. (Mazatec is a tonal language, so the glottis is making several tonal distinctions simultaneously with the phonation distinctions.)\n\"Note: There was an editing error in the source of this information. The latter two translations may have been mixed up.\"\nJavanese does not have modal voice in its stops, but contrasts two other points along the phonation scale, with more moderate departures from modal voice, called slack voice and stiff voice. The \"muddy\" consonants in Shanghainese are slack voice; they contrast with tenuis and aspirated consonants.\nAlthough each language may be somewhat different, it is convenient to classify these degrees of phonation into discrete categories. A series of seven alveolar stops, with phonations ranging from an open/lax to a closed/tense glottis, are:\nThe IPA diacritics \"under-ring\" and \"subscript wedge\", commonly called \"voiceless\" and \"voiced\", are sometimes added to the symbol for a voiced sound to indicate more lax/open (slack) and tense/closed (stiff) states of the glottis, respectively. (Ironically, adding the 'voicing' diacritic to the symbol for a voiced consonant indicates \"less\" modal voicing, not more, because a modally voiced sound is already fully voiced, at its sweet spot, and any further tension in the vocal cords dampens their vibration.)\nAlsatian, like several Germanic languages, has a typologically unusual phonation in its stops. The consonants transcribed (ambiguously called \"lenis\") are partially voiced: The vocal cords are positioned as for voicing, but do not actually vibrate. That is, they are technically voiceless, but without the open glottis usually associated with voiceless stops. They contrast with both modally voiced and modally voiceless in French borrowings, as well as aspirated word initially.\nIf the arytenoid cartiledges are parted to admit turbulent airflow, the result is whisper phonation if the vocal folds are abducted, and whispery voice phonation (murmur) if the vocal folds vibrate modally. Whisper phonation is heard in many productions of French , and the \"voiceless\" vowels of many North American languages are actually whispered.\nGlottal consonants.\nIt has long been noted that in many languages, both phonologically and historically, the glottal consonants do not behave like other consonants. Phonetically, they have no manner or place of articulation other than the state of the glottis: \"glottal closure\" for , \"breathy voice\" for , and \"open airstream\" for . Some phoneticians have described these sounds as neither glottal nor consonantal, but instead as instances of pure phonation, at least in many European languages. However, in Semitic languages they do appear to be true glottal consonants.\nSupra-glottal phonation.\nIn the last few decades it has become apparent that phonation may involve the entire larynx, with as many as six valves and muscles working either independently or together. From the glottis upward, these articulations are:\nUntil the development of fiber-optic laryngoscopy, the full involvement of the larynx during speech production was not observable, and the interactions among the six laryngeal articulators is still poorly understood. However, at least two supra-glottal phonations appear to be widespread in the world's languages. These are harsh voice ('ventricular' or 'pressed' voice), which involves overall constriction of the larynx, and faucalized voice ('hollow' or 'yawny' voice), which involves overall expansion of the larynx.\nThe Bor dialect of Dinka has contrastive modal, breathy, faucalized, and harsh voice in its vowels, as well as three tones. The \"ad hoc\" diacritics employed in the literature are a subscript double quotation mark for faucalized voice, , and underlining for harsh voice, . Examples are,\nOther languages with these contrasts are Bai (modal, breathy, and harsh voice), Kabiye (faucalized and harsh voice, previously seen as \u00b1ATR), Somali (breathy and harsh voice).\nElements of laryngeal articulation or phonation may occur widely in the world's languages as phonetic detail even when not phonemically contrastive. For example, simultaneous glottal, ventricular, and arytenoid activity (for something other than epiglottal consonants) has been observed in Tibetan, Korean, Nuuchahnulth, Nlaka'pamux, Thai, Sui, Amis, Pame, Arabic, Tigrinya, Cantonese, and Yi.\nEuropean language examples.\nIn languages such as French and Portuguese, all obstruents occur in pairs, one modally voiced and one voiceless: [b] [d] [g] [v] [z] [\u0292] \u2192 [p] [t] [k] [f] [s] [\u0283].\nIn English, every voiced fricative corresponds to a voiceless one. For the pairs of English stops, however, the distinction is better specified as voice onset time rather than simply voice: In initial position, /b d g/ are only partially voiced (voicing begins during the hold of the consonant), and /p t k/ are aspirated (voicing begins only well after its release). Certain English morphemes have voiced and voiceless allomorphs, such as: the plural, verbal, and possessive endings spelled \"-s\" (voiced in \"kids\" but voiceless in \"kits\" ), and the past-tense ending spelled \"-ed\" (voiced in \"buzzed\" but voiceless in \"fished\" ).\nA few European languages, such as Finnish, have no phonemically voiced obstruents but pairs of long and short consonants instead. Outside Europe, the lack of voicing distinctions is common; indeed, in Australian languages it is nearly universal.\nVocal registers.\nPhonology.\nIn phonology, a register is a combination of tone and vowel phonation into a single phonological parameter. For example, among its vowels, Burmese combines modal voice with low tone, breathy voice with falling tone, creaky voice with high tone, and glottal closure with high tone. These four registers contrast with each other, but no other combination of phonation (modal, breath, creak, closed) and tone (high, low, falling) is found.\nPedagogy and speech pathology.\nAmong vocal pedagogues and speech pathologists, a vocal register also refers to a particular phonation limited to a particular range of pitch, which possesses a characteristic sound quality. The term \"register\" may be used for several distinct aspects of the human voice:\nFour combinations of these elements are identified in speech pathology: the vocal fry register, the modal register, the falsetto register, and the whistle register.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Some authors such as Bourbaki refer to PIDs as principal rings.\nPrincipal ideal domains are mathematical objects that behave like the integers, with respect to divisibility: any element of a PID has a unique factorization into prime elements (so an analogue of the fundamental theorem of arithmetic holds); any two elements of a PID have a greatest common divisor (although it may not be possible to find it using the Euclidean algorithm). If \"x\" and \"y\" are elements of a PID without common divisors, then every element of the PID can be written in the form \"ax\" + \"by\", etc.\nPrincipal ideal domains are Noetherian, they are integrally closed, they are unique factorization domains and Dedekind domains. All Euclidean domains and all fields are principal ideal domains.\nPrincipal ideal domains appear in the following chain of class inclusions:\n rngs \u2283 rings \u2283 commutative\u00a0rings \u2283 integral\u00a0domains \u2283 integrally\u00a0closed\u00a0domains \u2283 GCD\u00a0domains \u2283 unique\u00a0factorization\u00a0domains \u2283 principal\u00a0ideal\u00a0domains \u2283 Euclidean\u00a0domains \u2283 fields \u2283 algebraically\u00a0closed fields\nExamples.\nExamples include:\nNon-examples.\nExamples of integral domains that are not PIDs:\nModules.\nThe key result is the structure theorem: If \"R\" is a principal ideal domain, and \"M\" is a finitely\ngenerated \"R\"-module, then formula_20 is a direct sum of cyclic modules, i.e., modules with one generator. The cyclic modules are isomorphic to formula_21 for some formula_22 (notice that formula_23 may be equal to formula_24, in which case formula_21 is formula_26).\nIf \"M\" is a free module over a principal ideal domain \"R\", then every submodule of \"M\" is again free. This does not hold for modules over arbitrary rings, as the example formula_27 of modules over formula_28 shows.\nProperties.\nIn a principal ideal domain, any two elements \"a\",\"b\" have a greatest common divisor, which may be obtained as a generator of the ideal (\"a\", \"b\").\nAll Euclidean domains are principal ideal domains, but the converse is not true.\nAn example of a principal ideal domain that is not a Euclidean domain is the ring formula_29, this was proved by Theodore Motzkin and was the first case known. In this domain no q and r exist, with 0 \u2264 |\"r\"| &lt; 4, so that formula_30, despite formula_31 and formula_32 having a greatest common divisor of 2.\nEvery principal ideal domain is a unique factorization domain (UFD). The converse does not hold since for any UFD \"K\", the ring \"K\"[\"X\", \"Y\"] of polynomials in 2 variables is a UFD but is not a PID. (To prove this look at the ideal generated by formula_33 It is not the whole ring since it contains no polynomials of degree 0, but it cannot be generated by any one single element.)\nThe previous three statements give the definition of a Dedekind domain, and hence every principal ideal domain is a Dedekind domain.\nLet \"A\" be an integral domain, the following are equivalent.\nAny Euclidean norm is a Dedekind-Hasse norm; thus, (5) shows that a Euclidean domain is a PID. (4) compares to:\nAn integral domain is a B\u00e9zout domain if and only if any two elements in it have a gcd \"that is a linear combination of the two.\" A B\u00e9zout domain is thus a GCD domain, and (4) gives yet another proof that a PID is a UFD.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The first program, which ran from 1958 to 1960, unsuccessfully attempted to send spacecraft to orbit the Moon, successfully sent one spacecraft to fly by the Moon, and successfully sent one spacecraft to investigate interplanetary space between the orbits of Earth and Venus. The second program, which ran from 1965 to 1992, sent four spacecraft to measure interplanetary space weather, two to explore Jupiter and Saturn, and two to explore Venus. The two outer planet probes, \"Pioneer 10\" and \"Pioneer 11\", became the first two of five artificial objects to achieve the escape velocity that will allow them to leave the Solar System, and carried a golden plaque each depicting a man and a woman and information about the origin and the creators of the probes, in case any extraterrestrials find them someday.\nNaming.\nCredit for naming the first probe has been attributed to Stephen A. Saliga, who had been assigned to the Air Force Orientation Group, Wright-Patterson AFB, as chief designer of Air Force exhibits. While he was at a briefing, the spacecraft was described to him, as, a \"lunar-orbiting vehicle, with an infrared scanning device.\" Saliga thought the title too long, and lacked theme for an exhibit design. He suggested, \"Pioneer\", as the name of the probe, since \"the Army had already launched and orbited the Explorer satellite, and their Public Information Office was identifying the Army, as, 'Pioneers in Space,'\" and, by adopting the name, the Air Force would \"make a 'quantum jump' as to who, really, [were] the 'Pioneers' in space.'\"\nEarly missions.\nThe earliest missions were attempts to achieve Earth's escape velocity, simply to show it was feasible and to study the Moon. This included the first launch by NASA which was formed from the old NACA. These missions were carried out by the Air Force Ballistic Missile Division, Army, and NASA.\nLater missions (1965\u20131978).\nFive years after the early Able space probe missions ended, NASA Ames Research Center used the Pioneer name for a new series of missions, initially aimed at the inner Solar System, before the flyby missions to Jupiter and Saturn. While successful, the missions returned much poorer images than the Voyager program probes would five years later. In 1978, the end of the program saw a return to the inner Solar System, with the Pioneer Venus Orbiter and Multiprobe, this time using orbital insertion rather than flyby missions.\nThe new missions were numbered beginning with Pioneer 6 (alternate names in parentheses).\nInterplanetary weather.\nThe spacecraft in Pioneer missions 6, 7, 8, and 9 comprised a new interplanetary space weather network:\nPioneer 6 and Pioneer 9 are in solar orbits with 0.8 AU distance to the Sun. Their orbital periods are therefore slightly shorter than Earth's. Pioneer 7 and Pioneer 8 are in solar orbits with 1.1 AU distance to the Sun. Their orbital periods are therefore slightly longer than Earth's. Since the probes' orbital periods differ from that of the Earth, from time to time, they face a side of the Sun that cannot be seen from Earth. The probes can sense parts of the Sun several days before the Sun's rotation reveals it to ground-based Earth orbiting observatories.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "25041", "revid": "4967956", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25041", "title": "Lockheed P-38 Lightning", "text": "American twin-engined fighter of WWII\nThe Lockheed P-38 Lightning is an American single-seat, twin-engined fighter aircraft that was used during World War II. Developed for the United States Army Air Corps (USAAC) by the Lockheed Corporation, the P-38 incorporated a distinctive twin-boom design with a central nacelle containing the cockpit and armament. Along with its use as a general fighter, the P-38 was used in various aerial combat roles, including as a highly effective fighter-bomber, a night fighter, and a long-range escort fighter when equipped with drop tanks. The P-38 was also used as a bomber-pathfinder, guiding streams of medium and heavy bombers, or even other P-38s equipped with bombs, to their targets. Some 1,200 Lightnings, about 1 of every 9, were assigned to aerial reconnaissance, with cameras replacing weapons to become the F-4 or F-5 model; in this role it was one of the most prolific recon airplanes in the war. Although it was not designated a heavy fighter or a bomber destroyer by the USAAC, the P-38 filled those roles and more; unlike German heavy fighters crewed by two or three airmen, the P-38, with its lone pilot, was nimble enough to compete with single-engined fighters.\nThe P-38 was used most successfully in the Pacific and the China-Burma-India theaters of operations as the aircraft of America's top aces, Richard Bong (40 victories), Thomas McGuire (38 victories), and Charles H. MacDonald (27 victories). In the South West Pacific theater, the P-38 was the primary long-range fighter of United States Army Air Forces until the introduction of large numbers of P-51D Mustangs toward the end of the war. Unusually for an early-war fighter design, both engines were supplemented by turbosuperchargers, making it one of the earliest Allied fighters capable of performing well at high altitudes. The turbosuperchargers also muffled the exhaust, making the P-38's operation relatively quiet. The Lightning was extremely forgiving in flight and could be mishandled without incident in many ways, but the initial rate of roll in early versions was low relative to other contemporary fighters; this was addressed in later variants with the introduction of hydraulically boosted ailerons. The smaller and more streamlined P-51 was significantly faster in a dive, which led to the P-51 replacing the P-38 in most European fighter groups by mid-1944. The P-38 was the only American fighter aircraft in large-scale production throughout American involvement in the war, from the Attack on Pearl Harbor to Victory over Japan Day.\nDesign and development.\nThe Lockheed Corporation designed the P-38 in response to a February 1937 specification from the United States Army Air Corps (USAAC). Circular Proposal X-608 was a set of aircraft performance goals authored by First Lieutenants Benjamin S. Kelsey and Gordon P. Saville for a twin-engined, high-altitude \"interceptor\" having \"the tactical mission of interception and attack of hostile aircraft at high altitude.\" Forty years later, Kelsey explained that Saville and he drew up the specification using the word \"interceptor\" as a way to bypass the inflexible Army Air Corps requirement for pursuit aircraft to carry no more than of armament including ammunition, and to bypass the USAAC restriction of single-seat aircraft to one engine. Kelsey was looking for a minimum of of armament. Kelsey and Saville aimed to get a more capable fighter, better at dog fighting and at high-altitude combat. Specifications called for a maximum airspeed of at least at altitude, and a climb to within six minutes, the toughest set of specifications USAAC had ever presented. The unbuilt Vultee XP1015 design was offered to fill this requirement, but was not advanced enough to merit further investigation. A similar proposal for a single-engined fighter was issued at the same time, Circular Proposal X-609, in response to which the Bell P-39 Airacobra was designed. Both proposals required liquid-cooled Allison V-1710 engines with turbosuperchargers and gave extra points for tricycle landing gear.\nLockheed formed a secretive engineering team to implement the project apart from the main factory; this approach later became known as Skunk Works. The Lockheed design team, under the direction of Hall Hibbard and Clarence \"Kelly\" Johnson, considered a range of twin-engined configurations, including both engines in a central fuselage with push\u2013pull propellers.\nThe eventual configuration was rare in contemporary production fighter aircraft design, with the Dutch Fokker G.I heavy fighter, and the later Northrop P-61 Black Widow night fighter and Swedish SAAB 21 having a similar planform. The Lockheed team chose twin booms to accommodate the tail assembly, engines, and turbosuperchargers, with a central nacelle for the pilot and armament. The XP-38 gondola mockup was designed to mount two .50-caliber (12.7\u00a0mm) M2 Browning machine guns with 200\u00a0rounds per gun (rpg), two .30-caliber (7.62\u00a0mm) Brownings with 500\u00a0rpg, and a United States Army Ordnance Department prototype T1 23\u00a0mm (.90 in) autocannon with a rotary magazine as a substitute for the nonexistent 25\u00a0mm Hotchkiss aircraft autocannon specified by Kelsey and Saville. In the prototype YP-38s, an Army Ordnance Department T9 37\u00a0mm (1.46\u00a0in) autocannon (later designated as the M4 in production) with 15 rounds replaced the 23\u00a0mm T1. The 15 rounds were in three, five-round clips, an unsatisfactory arrangement according to Kelsey, and the T9/M4 did not perform reliably in flight. Further armament experiments from March to June 1941 resulted in the P-38E combat configuration of four M2 Browning machine guns, and one Hispano 20\u00a0mm (.79 in) autocannon with 150 rounds.\nClustering all the armament in the nose was unusual in U.S. aircraft, which typically used wing-mounted guns with trajectories set up to crisscross at one or more points in a convergence zone. The P-38 cannon used heavier 20\u00a0mm rounds, creating a different trajectory, so it was inclined upward slightly more than the four machine guns such that the trajectories of the cannon rounds and .50-caliber bullets came together between 350 and 400 yards/meters. Nose-mounted guns did not suffer as much from having their useful ranges limited by pattern convergence, meaning that good pilots could shoot much farther. A Lightning could reliably hit targets at any range up to , whereas the wing guns of other fighters were optimized for a specific range. The rate of fire was about 650 rounds per minute for the 20\u00d7110\u00a0mm cannon round (130-gram shell) at a muzzle velocity of about , and for the .50-caliber machine guns (43-gram rounds), about 850\u00a0rpm at velocity. Combined rate of fire was over 4,000\u00a0rpm with roughly every sixth projectile a 20\u00a0mm shell. The duration of sustained firing for the 20\u00a0mm cannon was about 14 seconds, while the .50-caliber machine guns worked for 35 seconds if each magazine were fully loaded with 500 rounds, or for 21 seconds if 300 rounds were loaded to save weight for long-distance flying.\nThe Lockheed design incorporated tricycle undercarriage and a bubble canopy, and featured two turbosupercharged 12-cylinder Allison V-1710 engines fitted with counter-rotating propellers to eliminate the effect of engine torque, with the turbochargers positioned behind the engines, the exhaust side of the units exposed along the dorsal surfaces of the booms. Counter-rotation was achieved by the use of \"handed\" engines; the crankshafts of the engines turned in opposite directions, a relatively easy task for the V-1710 modular-design aircraft powerplant.\nThe P-38 was the first American fighter to make extensive use of stainless steel and smooth, flush-riveted, butt-jointed aluminum skin panels. It was also the first military airplane to fly faster than in level flight.\nXP-38 and YP-38 prototypes.\nLockheed won the competition on 23 June 1937 with its Model 22, and was contracted to build a prototype XP-38 for US$163,000, though Lockheed's own costs on the prototype would add up to $761,000. Construction began in July 1938 in an old bourbon distillery purchased by Lockheed to house expanding operations. This secure and remote site was later identified by Johnson as the first of five Lockheed Skunk Works locations. The XP-38 first flew on 27 January 1939 at the hands of Ben Kelsey.\nKelsey then proposed a speed dash to Wright Field on 11 February 1939 to relocate the aircraft for further testing. General Henry \"Hap\" Arnold, commander of the USAAC, approved of the record attempt and recommended a cross-country flight to New York. The flight set a speed record by flying from California to New York in seven hours and two minutes, not counting two refueling stops. Kelsey flew conservatively for most of the way, working the engines gently, even throttling back during descent to remove the associated speed advantage. Bundled up against the cold, Arnold congratulated Kelsey at Wright Field during his final refueling stop, and said, \"don't spare the horses\" on the next leg. After climbing out of Wright Field and reaching altitude, Kelsey pushed the XP-38 to . Nearing his destination, Kelsey was ordered by Mitchel Field tower (Hempstead, New York) into a slow landing pattern behind other aircraft. Carburetor icing caused it to be brought down short of the Mitchel runway, and it was wrecked. On the basis of the record flight, though, the USAAC ordered 13 YP-38s on 27 April 1939 for US$134,284 (~$ in 2024) each. (The \"Y\" in \"YP\" was the USAAC's designation for service test, i.e. small numbers of early production aircraft, while the \"X\" in \"XP\" was for experimental.) Lockheed's chief test pilot, Tony LeVier, angrily characterized the accident as an unnecessary publicity stunt, but according to Kelsey, the loss of the prototype, rather than hampering the program, sped the process by cutting short the initial test series. The success of the aircraft design contributed to Kelsey's promotion to captain in May 1939.\nManufacture of YP-38s fell behind schedule, at least partly because of changes to meet the need for mass production, making them substantially different in construction from the prototype. Another factor was the sudden required expansion of Lockheed's facility in Burbank, taking it from a specialized civilian firm dealing with small orders to a large government defense contractor making Venturas, Harpoons, Lodestars, and Hudsons, and designing the Constellation for TWA. The first YP-38 was not completed until September 1940, with its maiden flight on 17 September. The 13th and final YP-38 was delivered to the USAAC in June 1941; 12 aircraft were retained for flight testing and one for destructive stress testing. The YPs were substantially redesigned and differed greatly in detail from the hand-built XP-38. They were lighter and included changes in engine fit. The propeller rotation was reversed, with the blades spinning outward (away from the cockpit) at the top of their arc, rather than inward as before. This improved the aircraft's stability as a gunnery platform.\nHigh-speed compressibility problems.\nTest flights revealed problems initially believed to be tail flutter. During high-speed flight approaching Mach\u00a00.68, especially during dives, the aircraft's tail would begin to shake violently, and the nose would tuck under (see Mach tuck), steepening the dive. Once caught in this dive, the fighter would enter a high-speed compressibility stall and the controls would lock up, leaving the pilot no option but to bail out (if possible) or remain with the aircraft until it got down to denser air, where he might have a chance to pull out. During a test flight in May 1941, USAAC Major Signa Gilkey managed to stay with a YP-38 in a compressibility lockup, riding it out until he recovered gradually using elevator trim. Lockheed engineers were very concerned by this limitation, but first had to concentrate on filling the current order of aircraft. In late June 1941, the Army Air Corps was renamed the U.S. Army Air Forces (USAAF), and 65 Lightnings were finished for the service by September 1941, with more on the way for the USAAF, the Royal Air Force (RAF), and the Free French Air Force operating from England.\nBy November 1941, many of the initial assembly-line challenges had been met, which freed up time for the engineering team to tackle the problem of frozen controls in a dive. Lockheed had a few ideas for tests that would help them find an answer. The first solution tried was the fitting of spring-loaded servo tabs on the elevator trailing edge designed to aid the pilot when control yoke forces rose over , as would be expected in a high-speed dive. At that point, the tabs would begin to multiply the effort of the pilot's actions. Expert test pilot Ralph Virden was given a specific high-altitude test sequence to follow and was told to restrict his speed and fast maneuvering in denser air at low altitudes, since the new mechanism could exert tremendous leverage under those conditions. A note was taped to the instrument panel of the test craft underscoring this instruction. On 4 November 1941, Virden climbed into YP-38 #1 and completed the test sequence successfully, but 15 minutes later, was seen in a steep dive followed by a high-G pullout. The tail unit of the aircraft failed at about during the high-speed dive recovery; Virden was killed in the subsequent crash. The Lockheed design office was justifiably upset, but their design engineers could only conclude that servo tabs were \"not\" the solution for loss of control in a dive. Lockheed still had to find the problem; the USAAF personnel were sure it was flutter, and ordered Lockheed to look more closely at the tail.\nIn 1941, flutter was a familiar engineering problem related to a too-flexible tail, but the P-38's empennage was completely skinned in aluminum rather than fabric and was quite rigid. At no time did the P-38 suffer from true flutter. To prove a point, one elevator and its vertical stabilizers were skinned with metal 63% thicker than standard, but the increase in rigidity made no difference in vibration. Army Lieutenant Colonel Kenneth B. Wolfe (head of Army Production Engineering) asked Lockheed to try external mass balances above and below the elevator, although the P-38 already had large mass balances elegantly placed within each vertical stabilizer. Various configurations of external mass balances were equipped, and dangerously steep test flights were flown to document their performance. Explaining to Wolfe in Report No. 2414, Kelly Johnson wrote, \"the violence of the vibration was unchanged and the diving tendency was naturally the same for all conditions.\" The external mass balances did not help at all. Nonetheless, at Wolfe's insistence, the additional external balances were a feature of every P-38 built from then on.\nJohnson said in his autobiography that he pleaded with National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics to do model tests in its wind tunnel. They already had experience of models thrashing around violently at speeds approaching those requested and did not want to risk damaging their tunnel. Gen. Arnold, head of USAAF, ordered them to run the tests, which were done up to Mach 0.74. The P-38's dive problem was revealed to be the center of pressure moving back toward the tail when in high-speed flight. The solution was to change the geometry of the wing's lower surface when diving to keep the lift within bounds on the top of the wing. In February 1943, quick-acting dive flaps were tried and proven by Lockheed test pilots. The dive flaps were installed outboard of the engine nacelles, and in action, they extended downward 35\u00b0 in 1.5 seconds. The flaps did not act as a speed brake; they affected the pressure distribution in a way that retained the wing's lift.\nLate in 1943, a few hundred dive flap field-modification kits were assembled to give North African, European, and Pacific P-38s a chance to withstand compressibility and expand their combat tactics. The kits did not always reach their destination. In March 1944, 200 dive flap kits intended for the European Theater of Operations (ETO) P-38Js were destroyed in a mistaken identification incident in which an RAF fighter shot down the Douglas C-54 Skymaster (mistaken for a German Focke-Wulf Fw 200) taking the shipment to England. Back in Burbank, P-38Js coming off the assembly line in spring 1944 were towed out to the ramp and modified in the open air. The flaps were finally incorporated into the production line in June 1944 on the last 210 P-38Js. Despite testing having proved the dive flaps effective in improving tactical maneuvers, a 14-month delay in production limited their implementation, with only the final half of all Lightnings built having the dive flaps installed as an assembly-line sequence.\nJohnson later recalled:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I broke an ulcer over compressibility on the P-38 because we flew into a speed range where no one had ever been before, and we had difficulty convincing people that it wasn't the funny-looking airplane itself, but a fundamental physical problem. We found out what happened when the Lightning shed its tail and we worked during the whole war to get 15 more kn [28\u00a0km/h] of speed out of the P-38. We saw compressibility as a brick wall for a long time. Then we learned how to get through it.\nBuffeting was another early aerodynamic problem. Distinguishing it from compressibility was difficult, as both were reported by test pilots as \"tail shake\". Buffeting came about from airflow disturbances ahead of the tail; the airplane would shake at high speed. Leading-edge wing slots were tried, as were combinations of filleting between the wing, cockpit, and engine nacelles. Air-tunnel test number 15 solved the buffeting completely and its fillet solution was fitted to every subsequent P-38 airframe. Fillet kits were sent out to every squadron flying Lightnings. The problem was traced to a 40% increase in air speed at the wing-fuselage junction where the thickness/chord ratio was highest. An airspeed of at could push airflow at the wing-fuselage junction close to the speed of sound. Filleting solved the buffeting problem for the P-38E and later models.\nAnother issue with the P-38 arose from its unique design feature of outwardly rotating (at the \"tops\" of the propeller arcs) counter-rotating propellers. Losing one of two engines in any twin-engined, non-centerline thrust aircraft on takeoff creates sudden drag, yawing the nose toward the dead engine and rolling the wingtip down on the side of the dead engine. Normal training in flying twin-engined aircraft when losing an engine on takeoff is to push the remaining engine to full throttle to maintain airspeed; if a pilot did that in the P-38, regardless of which engine had failed, the resulting engine torque and p-factor force produced a sudden, uncontrollable yawing roll, and the aircraft would flip over and crash. Eventually, procedures were taught to allow a pilot to deal with the situation by reducing power on the running engine, feathering the prop on the failed engine, and then increasing power gradually until the aircraft was in stable flight. Single-engined takeoffs were possible, though not with a full fuel and ammunition load.\nThe engines were unusually quiet because the exhausts were muffled by the General Electric turbosuperchargers on the twin Allison V-12s. Early problems with cockpit temperature regulation occurred; pilots were often too hot in the tropical sun, as the canopy could not be fully opened without severe buffeting, and were often too cold in Northern Europe and at high altitude, as the distance of the engines from the cockpit prevented easy heat transfer. Later variants received modifications (such as electrically heated flight suits) to solve these problems.\nOn 20 September 1939, before the YP-38s had been built and flight tested, the USAAC ordered 66 initial-production P-38 Lightnings, 30 of which were delivered to the (renamed) USAAF in mid-1941, but not all these aircraft were armed. The unarmed aircraft were subsequently fitted with four .50 in (12.7\u00a0mm) machine guns (instead of the two .50 in/12.7\u00a0mm and two .30 in/7.62\u00a0mm of their predecessors) and a 37\u00a0mm (1.46\u00a0in) cannon. They also had armored glass, cockpit armor, and fluorescent instrument lighting. One was completed with a pressurized cabin on an experimental basis and designated XP-38A. Due to reports the USAAF was receiving from Europe, the remaining 36 in the batch were upgraded with small improvements such as self-sealing fuel tanks and enhanced armor protection to make them combat-capable. The USAAF specified that these 36 aircraft were to be designated P-38D. As a result, no P-38Bs or P-38Cs were designated. The P-38D's main role was to work out bugs and give the USAAF experience with handling the type.\nIn March 1940, the French and British, through the Anglo-French Purchasing Committee, ordered 667 P-38s for US$100M, designated Model 322F for the French and Model 322B for the British. The aircraft was a variant of the P-38E. The overseas Allies wished for complete commonality of Allison engines with the large numbers of Curtiss P-40 Tomahawks both nations had on order, so they ordered the aircraft fitted with two right-handed engines (not counter-rotating) without turbosuperchargers. Performance was supposed to be at . After the fall of France in June 1940, the British took over the entire order and gave the aircraft the service name \"Lightning\". By June 1941, the War Ministry had cause to reconsider their earlier aircraft specifications based on experience gathered in the Battle of Britain and the Blitz. British displeasure with the Lockheed order came to the fore in July, and on 5 August 1941, they modified the contract such that 143 aircraft would be delivered as previously ordered, to be known as \"Lightning (Mark) I\", and 524 would be upgraded to US-standard P-38E specifications with a top speed of at guaranteed, to be called \"Lightning II\", for British service. Later that summer, an RAF test pilot reported back from Burbank with a poor assessment of the \"tail flutter\" situation, and the British cancelled all but three of the 143 Lightning Is. As a loss around US$15M was involved, Lockheed reviewed their contracts and decided to hold the British to the original order. Negotiations grew bitter and stalled. Everything changed after Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941, after which the United States government seized some 40 of the Model 322s for West Coast defense; subsequently, all British Lightnings were delivered to the USAAF starting in January 1942. The USAAF lent the RAF three of the aircraft, which were delivered by sea in March 1942 and were test flown no earlier than May at Cunliffe-Owen Aircraft Swaythling, the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment (A&amp;AEE) and the Royal Aircraft Establishment. The A&amp;AEE example was unarmed, lacked turbochargers, and restricted to , though the undercarriage was praised and flight on one engine described as comfortable. These three were subsequently returned to the USAAF, one in December 1942 and the others in July 1943. Of the remaining 140 Lightning Is, 19 were not modified and were designated by the USAAF as RP-322-I ('R' for 'Restricted', because noncounter-rotating propellers were considered more dangerous on takeoff), while 121 were converted to counter-rotating V-1710F-2 engines without turbosuperchargers and designated P-322-II. All 121 were used as advanced trainers; a few were still serving that role in 1945. A few RP-322s were later used as test-modification platforms such as for smoke-laying canisters. The RP-322 was a fairly fast aircraft below and well-behaved as a trainer.\nMany of the British order of 524 Lightning IIs were fitted with stronger F-10 Allison engines as they became available, and all were given wing pylons for fuel tanks or bombs. The upgraded aircraft were deployed to the Pacific as USAAC F-5A reconnaissance or P-38G fighter models, the latter used with great effect in the operation that shot down Admiral Yamamoto in April 1943. Robert Petit's G model named \"Miss Virginia\" was on that mission, borrowed by Rex Barber, who was later credited with the kill. Petit had already used \"Miss Virginia\" to defeat two Nakajima A6M2-N \"Rufe\" floatplanes in February and to heavily damage a Japanese submarine chaser in March, which he mistakenly claimed as a destroyer sunk. Murray \"Jim\" Shubin used a less-powerful F model he named \"Oriole\" to down five confirmed and possibly six Zeros over Guadalcanal in June 1943 to become ace in a day.\nThe British name was retained over Lockheed's original name \"Atalanta\", the swift-running Greek goddess, following the company tradition of using mythological and celestial figures.\nRange extension.\nThe strategic-bombing proponents within the USAAF, nicknamed the Bomber Mafia by their ideological opponents, had established in the early 1930s a policy against research to create long-range fighters, which they thought would not be practical; this kind of research was not to compete for bomber resources. Aircraft manufacturers understood that they would not be rewarded if they installed subsystems on their fighters to enable them to carry drop tanks to provide more fuel for extended range. Lieutenant Kelsey, acting against this policy, risked his career in late 1941 when he convinced Lockheed to incorporate such subsystems in the P-38E model, without putting his request in writing. Kelsey possibly was responding to Colonel George William Goddard's observation that the US sorely needed a high-speed, long-range photo reconnaissance plane. Along with a change order specifying some P-38Es be produced with guns replaced by photoreconnaissance cameras, to be designated the F-4-1-LO, Lockheed began working out the problems of drop-tank design and incorporation. After the attack on Pearl Harbor, eventually about 100 P-38Es were sent to a modification center near Dallas, Texas, or to the new Lockheed assembly plant B-6 (today the Burbank Airport), to be fitted with four K-17 aerial photography cameras. All of these aircraft were also modified to be able to carry drop tanks. P-38Fs were modified, as well. Every Lightning from the P-38G onward was capable of being fitted with drop tanks straight off the assembly line.\nIn March 1942, General Arnold made an off-hand comment that the US could avoid the German U-boat menace by flying fighters to the UK rather than packing them onto ships. President Roosevelt pressed the point, emphasizing his interest in the solution. Arnold was likely aware of the flying radius extension work being done on the P-38, which by this time had seen success with small drop tanks in the range of , the difference in capacity being the result of subcontractor production variation. Arnold ordered further tests with larger drop tanks in the range of ; the results were reported by Kelsey as providing the P-38 with a ferrying range. Because of available supply, the smaller drop tanks were used to fly Lightnings to the UK, the plan called Operation Bolero.\nLed by two Boeing B-17 Flying Fortresses, the first seven P-38s, each carrying two small drop tanks, left Presque Isle Army Air Field in Maine on 23 June 1942 for RAF Heathfield in Scotland. Their first refueling stop was made in far northeast Canada at Goose Bay. The second stop was a rough airstrip in Greenland called Bluie West One, and the third refueling stop was in Iceland at Keflavik. Other P-38s followed this route, with some lost in mishaps, usually due to poor weather, low visibility, radio difficulties, and navigational errors. Nearly 200 of the P-38Fs (and a few modified Es) were successfully flown across the Atlantic in July\u2013August 1942, making the P-38 the first USAAF fighter to reach Britain and the first fighter ever to be delivered across the Atlantic under its own power. Kelsey himself piloted one of the Lightnings, landing in Scotland on 25 July.\nOperational history.\nThe first unit to receive P-38s was the 1st Fighter Group. After the attack on Pearl Harbor, the unit joined the 14th Pursuit Group in San Diego to provide West Coast defense.\nEntry to the war.\nThe first Lightning to see active service was the F-4 version, a P-38E in which the guns were replaced by four K17 cameras. They joined the 8th Photographic Squadron in Australia on 4 April 1942. Three F-4s were operated by the Royal Australian Air Force in this theater for a short period beginning in September 1942.\nOn 29 May 1942, 25 P-38s began operating in the Aleutian Islands in Alaska. The fighter's long range made it well-suited to the campaign over the almost -long island chain, and it was flown there for the rest of the war. The Aleutians were some of the most rugged environments available for testing the new aircraft under combat conditions. More Lightnings were lost due to severe weather and other conditions than enemy action; cases occurred where Lightning pilots, mesmerized by flying for hours over gray seas under gray skies, simply flew into the water. On 9 August 1942, two P-38Es of the 343rd Fighter Group, 11th Air Force, at the end of a long-range patrol, happened upon a pair of Japanese Kawanishi H6K \"Mavis\" flying boats and destroyed them, making them the first Japanese aircraft to be shot down by Lightnings.\nEuropean theater.\nNorth Africa and Italy.\nAfter the Battle of Midway, the USAAF began redeploying fighter groups to Britain as part of Operation Bolero, and Lightnings of the 1st Fighter Group were flown across the Atlantic via Iceland. On 14 August 1942, Second Lieutenant Elza Shahan of the 27th Fighter Squadron, and Second Lieutenant Joseph Shaffer of the 33rd Squadron operating out of Iceland shot down a Focke-Wulf Fw 200 Condor over the Atlantic. Shaffer, flying either a P-40C or a P-39, scored the first hit, causing a fire on the Condor; Shahan in his P-38F finished it off with a high-speed gunnery pass. This was the first Luftwaffe aircraft destroyed by the USAAF.\nAfter 347 sorties with no enemy contact, the 1st and 14th Fighter Groups transferred from the UK to the 12th Air Force in North Africa as part of the force being built up for Operation Torch. The Lightning's long range allowed the pilots to fly their fighters over the Bay of Biscay, skirting neutral Spain and Portugal to refuel in Morocco. The P-38s were initially based at Tafaroui Airfield in Algeria alongside P-40 Warhawks and the rest of the 12th Air Force. P-38s were first involved in North African combat operations on 11 November 1942. The first North African P-38 kill was on 22 November, when Lieutenant Mark Shipman of the 14th downed an Italian airplane with twin engines. Shipman later made two more kills\u00a0\u2013 a Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighter and a very large Me 323 Gigant transport.\nEarly results in the Mediterranean theater of operations were mixed. Some P-38 pilots scored multiple kills to become aces, while many others were shot down due to inexperience or tactical strictures. Overall, the P-38 suffered its highest losses in the Mediterranean theater. The primary function of the P-38 in North Africa was to escort bombers, but the fighters also targeted transport aircraft, and later in the campaign, they were sometimes given ground-attack missions. When tied to bomber-escort duties, the P-38 squadrons were vulnerable to attack from above by German fighters, which selected the most advantageous position and timing. The initial tactical doctrine of the American units was for the P-38s to fly near the bombers at all times rather than to defend aggressively or to fly ahead and clear the airspace for the bombers, and many American pilots were downed because of this limitation. Losses mounted, and all available P-38s in the UK were flown over to North Africa to restore squadron strength. After this painful experience, the American leadership changed tactics, and in February 1943, the P-38s were given free rein in their battles.\nThe first German success against the P-38 was on 28 November 1942, when Bf 109 pilots of \"Jagdgeschwader\" 53 claimed seven Lightnings for no loss of their own. Further one-sided German victories were noted on several occasions through January 1943. The first P-38 pilots to achieve ace status were Virgil Smith of the 14th FG and Jack Illfrey of the 1st FG, both credited with five wins by 26 December. Smith got a sixth enemy aircraft on 28 December, but was killed two days later in a crash landing, likely after taking fire from \"Oberfeldwebel\" Herbert Rollwage of JG 53, who survived the war with at least 71 kills. This was Rollwage's first victory over a P-38, and his 35th claim at the time.\nThe two squadrons of the 14th Fighter Group were reduced so badly in December 1942 that the 82nd FG was flown from the UK to North Africa to cover the shortage. The first kill by the 82nd was during a bomber-escort mission on 7 January 1943, when William J. \"Dixie\" Sloan broke formation and turned toward six attacking Bf 109s to shoot one of them down. Known for his maverick style, Sloan racked up 12 victories by July 1943. After another heavy toll in January 1943, 14th FG had to be withdrawn from the front to reorganize, with surviving pilots sent home and the few remaining Lightnings transferred to the 82nd. The 14th was out of action for three months, returning in May.\nOn 5 April 1943, 26 P-38Fs of the 82nd claimed 31 enemy aircraft destroyed, helping to establish air superiority in the area and allegedly earning it the German nickname \"der Gabelschwanz Teufel\"\u00a0\u2013 the Fork-tailed Devil, coming from a recently downed German aviator, as described by \"Life\" in August 1943. However, the reliability of this attribution is doubtful, as the clear intent of the article was to rehabilitate the P-38's reputation in the minds of the American public. No earlier independent or German attestation exists for this claim. The P-38s remained active in the Mediterranean for the rest of the war, continuing to deliver and receive damage in combat. On 30 August 1943, 13 P-38s were shot down by German and Italian fighters while escorting B-26 and B-17 bombers on raids against targets in Italy. On 2 September, 10 P-38s were shot down in combat with four Bf 109s of JG 53, including that of 67-victory ace Franz Schie\u00df, who had been the leading \"Lightning killer\" in the Luftwaffe with 17 destroyed.\nThe Mediterranean theater had the first aerial combat between German fighters and P-38s. German fighter-pilot appraisal of the P-38 was mixed. Some observers dismissed the P-38 as an easy kill, while others gave it high praise, a deadly enemy worthy of respect. Johannes Steinhoff, commander of JG 77 in North Africa, said that the unit's old Bf 109s were \"perhaps, a little faster\" than the P-38, but a dogfight with the twin-engined fighter was daunting because its turning radius was much smaller, and it could quickly get on the tail of the Bf 109. Franz Stigler, an ace with 28 kills, flew Bf 109s against the P-38 in North Africa. Stigler said the Lightning \"could turn inside us with ease and they could go from level flight to climb almost instantaneously. We lost quite a few pilots who tried to make an attack and then pull up... One cardinal rule we never forgot was to avoid fighting the P-38 head on. That was suicide.\" Stigler said the best defense was to flick-roll the Bf 109 and dive, as the Lightning was slow in the first 10\u00b0 of roll, and it was not as fast in a dive. Herbert Kaiser, eventually a 68-kill ace, shot down his first P-38 in January 1943. Kaiser said that the P-38 should be respected as a formidable opponent, that it was faster and more maneuverable than the Bf 109G-6 model he flew, especially since the G-6 was slowed by underwing cannon pods. Johann Pichler, another high-scoring ace, said that the P-38 in 1943 was much faster in a climb than the Bf 109. Kurt B\u00fchligen, third-highest scoring German pilot on the Western front with 112 victories, recalled: \"The P-38 fighter (and the B-24) were easy to burn. Once in Africa, we were six, and met eight P-38s and shot down seven. One sees a great distance in Africa and our observers and flak people called in sightings and we could get altitude first and they were low and slow.\" \"General der Jagdflieger\" Adolf Galland was unimpressed with the P-38, declaring, \"it had similar shortcomings in combat to our Bf 110, our fighters were clearly superior to it.\" Heinz B\u00e4r said that P-38s \"were not difficult at all. They were easy to outmaneuver and were generally a sure kill\".\nOn 12 June 1943, a P-38G, while flying a special mission between Gibraltar and Malta, or perhaps, just after strafing the radar station of Capo Pula, landed on the airfield of Capoterra (Cagliari), in Sardinia, from navigation error due to a compass failure. \"Regia Aeronautica\" chief test pilot \"Colonnello\" (Lieutenant Colonel) Angelo Tondi flew the captured aircraft to Guidonia airfield, where the P-38G was evaluated. On 11 August 1943, Tondi took off to intercept a formation of about 50 bombers, returning from the bombing of Terni (Umbria). Tondi attacked B-17G \"Bonny Sue\", 42\u201330307, that fell off the shore of Torvaianica, near Rome, while six airmen parachuted out. According to US sources, he also damaged three more bombers on that occasion. On 4 September, the 301st BG reported the loss of B-17 \"The Lady Evelyn,\" 42\u201330344, downed by \"an enemy P-38\". War missions for that plane were limited, as the Italian petrol was too corrosive for the Lockheed's tanks. Other Lightnings were eventually acquired by Italy for postwar service.\nIn a particular case when faced by more agile fighters at low altitudes in a constricted valley, Lightnings suffered heavy losses. On the morning of 10 June 1944, 96 P-38Js of the 1st and 82nd Fighter Groups took off from Italy for Ploie\u0219ti, the third-most heavily defended target in Europe, after Berlin and Vienna. Instead of bombing from high altitude as had been tried by the Fifteenth Air Force, USAAF planning had determined that a dive-bombing surprise attack, beginning at about with bomb release at or below , performed by 46 82nd Fighter Group P-38s, each carrying one bomb, would yield more accurate results. All of 1st Fighter Group and a few aircraft in 82nd Fighter Group were to fly cover, and all fighters were to strafe targets of opportunity on the return trip, a distance of some , including a circuitous outward route made in an attempt to achieve surprise. Some 85 or 86 fighters arrived in Romania to find enemy airfields alerted, with a wide assortment of aircraft scrambling for safety. P-38s shot down several, including heavy fighters, transports, and observation aircraft. At Ploie\u0219ti, defense forces were fully alert, the target was concealed by smoke screen, and antiaircraft fire was very heavy; seven Lightnings were lost to antiaircraft fire at the target, and two more during strafing attacks on the return flight. German Bf\u00a0109 fighters from I./JG 53 and 2./JG 77 fought the Americans. Sixteen P-38s, called \"Indieni cu dou\u0103 pene\" (Indians with two feathers) by the Romanians, of the 71st Fighter Squadron were challenged by a large formation of Romanian IAR.81C fighters of the 6th Fighter Group. The fight took place below in a narrow valley and lasted 12 minutes. Herbert Hatch saw two IAR\u00a081Cs that he misidentified as Focke-Wulf Fw 190s hit the ground after taking fire from his guns, and his fellow pilots confirmed three more of his kills. Three of his victories were confirmed by gun camera. The outnumbered 71st Fighter Squadron took more damage than it dished out, though, losing nine aircraft. In all, the USAAF lost 22 aircraft on the mission. The Americans claimed 23 aerial victories. The Romanians and Germans lost five Bf 110s, four Ju 52s, and one Savoia-Marchetti SM.79 on the ground, as well as three Focke-Wulf Fw 58s, three IAR 38s, and three IAR.81Cs in the air. Eleven enemy locomotives were strafed and left burning, and flak emplacements were destroyed, along with fuel trucks and other targets. Results of the bombing were not observed by the USAAF pilots because of the smoke. The dive-bombing mission profile was not repeated, though the 82nd Fighter Group was awarded the Presidential Unit Citation for its part.\nWestern Europe.\nExperiences over Germany had shown a need for long-range escort fighters to protect the Eighth Air Force's heavy-bomber operations. The P-38Hs of the 55th Fighter Group were transferred to the Eighth in England in September 1943, and were joined by the 20th Fighter Group, 364th Fighter Group, and 479th Fighter Group soon after. P-38s and Spitfires escorted Flying Fortress raids over Europe.\nBecause its distinctive shape was less prone to cases of mistaken identity and friendly fire, Lieutenant General Jimmy Doolittle, commander of the 8th Air Force, chose to pilot a P-38 during the invasion of Normandy, so he could watch the progress of the air offensive over France. At one point in the mission, Doolittle flick-rolled through a hole in the cloud cover, but his wingman, then\u2013Major General Earle E. Partridge, was looking elsewhere and failed to notice Doolittle's quick maneuver, leaving Doolittle to continue on alone on his survey of the crucial battle. Of the P-38, Doolittle said that it was \"the sweetest-flying plane in the sky\".\nA little-known role of the P-38 in the European theater was that of fighter-bomber during the invasion of Normandy and the Allied advance across France into Germany. Assigned to the IX Tactical Air Command, the 370th Fighter Group and 474th Fighter Group and their P-38s initially flew missions from England, dive-bombing radar installations, enemy armor, troop concentrations, and flak towers, and providing air cover. The 370th's group commander Howard F. Nichols and a squadron of his P-38 Lightnings attacked Field Marshal G\u00fcnther von Kluge's headquarters in July 1944; Nichols himself skipped a bomb through the front door. The 370th later operated from Cardonville, France, and the 474th from various bases in France, flying ground-attack missions against gun emplacements, troops, supply dumps, and tanks near Saint-L\u00f4 in July and in the Falaise\u2013Argentan area in August 1944. The 370th participated in ground-attack missions across Europe until February 1945, when the unit changed over to the P-51 Mustang. The 474th operated out of bases in France, Belgium, and Germany in primarily the ground-attack missions until November\u2013December 1945.\nAfter some disastrous raids in 1944 with B-17s escorted by P-38s and Republic P-47 Thunderbolts, Doolittle, then head of the U.S. Eighth Air Force, went to the Royal Aircraft Establishment, Farnborough, asking for an evaluation of the various American fighters. Test pilot Captain Eric Brown, Fleet Air Arm, recalled:\nWe had found out that the Bf\u00a0109 and the FW\u00a0190 could fight up to a Mach of 0.75, three-quarters the speed of sound. We checked the Lightning and it couldn't fly in combat faster than 0.68. So, it was useless. We told Doolittle that all it was good for was photoreconnaissance and had to be withdrawn from escort duties. And the funny thing is that the Americans had great difficulty understanding this because the Lightning had the two top aces in the Far East.\nAfter evaluation tests at Farnborough, the P-38 was kept in fighting service in Europe for a while longer. Although many failings were remedied with the introduction of the P-38J, by September 1944, all but one of the Lightning groups in the Eighth Air Force had converted to the P-51 Mustang. The Eighth Air Force continued to conduct reconnaissance missions using the F-5 variant.\nPacific theater.\nThe P-38 was used most extensively and successfully in the Pacific theater, where it proved more suited, combining exceptional range with the reliability of two engines for long missions over water. The P-38 was used in a variety of roles, especially escorting bombers at altitudes of . The P-38 was credited with destroying more Japanese aircraft than any other USAAF fighter. Freezing cockpit temperatures were not a problem at low altitude in the tropics. In fact, the cockpit was often too hot, since opening a window while in flight caused buffeting by setting up turbulence through the tailplane. Pilots taking low-altitude assignments often flew stripped down to shorts, tennis shoes, and parachute. While the P-38 could not out-turn the A6M Zero and most other Japanese fighters when flying below , its superior speed coupled with a good rate of climb meant that it could use energy tactics, making multiple high-speed passes at its target. In addition, its tightly grouped guns were even more deadly to lightly armored Japanese warplanes than to German aircraft. The concentrated, parallel stream of bullets allowed aerial victory at much longer distances than fighters carrying wing guns. Dick Bong, the United States' highest-scoring World War II air ace (40 victories in P-38s), flew directly at his targets to ensure he hit them, in some cases flying through the debris of his target (and on one occasion colliding with an enemy aircraft, which was claimed as a \"probable\" victory). The twin Allison engines performed admirably in the Pacific.\nGeneral George C. Kenney, commander of the USAAF 5th Air Force operating in New Guinea, could not get enough P-38s; they had become his favorite fighter in November 1942 when one squadron, the 39th Fighter Squadron of the 35th Fighter Group, joined his assorted P-39s and P-40s. The Lightnings established local air superiority with their first combat action on 27 December 1942. Kenney sent repeated requests to Arnold for more P-38s, and was rewarded with occasional shipments, but Europe was a higher priority in Washington. Despite their small force, Lightning pilots began to compete in racking up scores against Japanese aircraft.\nOn 2\u20134 March 1943, P-38s flew top cover for 5th Air Force and Australian bombers and attack aircraft during the Battle of the Bismarck Sea, in which eight Japanese troop transports and four escorting destroyers were sunk. Two P-38 aces from the 39th Fighter Squadron were killed on the second day of the battle: Bob Faurot and Hoyt \"Curley\" Eason (a veteran with five victories who had trained hundreds of pilots, including Dick Bong). In one notable engagement on 3 March 1943, P-38s escorted 13 B-17s (part of an attack including B-25 Mitchells and Beaufighters) as they bombed the Japanese convoy from a medium altitude of , which dispersed the convoy formation and reduced their concentrated antiaircraft firepower. A B-17 was shot down and when Japanese Zero fighters machine-gunned some of the B-17 crew members who bailed out in parachutes, three P-38s promptly dived into action, claiming five Zeros.\nKilling of Admiral Yamamoto.\nBecause of its ability to fly long distances, the Lightning figured in one of the most significant operations in the Pacific Theater\u00a0\u2013 the interception, on 18 April 1943, of Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, the architect of Japan's naval strategy in the Pacific including the attack on Pearl Harbor. When American codebreakers found out that he was flying to Bougainville Island to conduct a front-line inspection, 16 P-38G Lightnings were sent on a long-range fighter-intercept mission, flying from Guadalcanal at heights of above the ocean to avoid detection. The Lightnings met Yamamoto's two Mitsubishi G4M \"Betty\" fast bomber transports and six escorting Zeros just as they arrived at the island. The first Betty crashed in the jungle and the second ditched near the coast. The Americans lost one P-38. Japanese search parties found Yamamoto's body at the jungle crash site the next day.\nService record.\nThe P-38's service record shows mixed results, which may reflect more on its employment than on flaws with the aircraft. The P-38's engine troubles at high altitudes only occurred with the Eighth Air Force. One reason for this was the inadequate cooling systems of the G and H models; the improved P-38 J and L had tremendous success flying out of Italy into Germany at all altitudes. Until the -J-25 variant, P-38s were easily avoided by German fighters because of the lack of dive flaps to counter compressibility in dives. German fighter pilots not wishing to fight would perform the first half of a Split S and continue into steep dives because they knew the Lightnings would be reluctant to follow.\nOn the positive side, having two engines was a built-in insurance policy. Many pilots arrived safely back to base after having an engine failure en route or in combat. On 3 March 1944, the first Allied fighters reached Berlin on a frustrated escort mission. Lieutenant Colonel Jack Jenkins of 55th Fighter Group led the group of P-38H pilots, arriving with only half his force after flak damage and engine trouble took their toll. On the way into Berlin, Jenkins reported one rough-running engine, causing him to wonder if he would ever make it back. The B-17s he was supposed to escort never showed up, having turned back at Hamburg. Jenkins and his wingman were able to drop tanks and outrun enemy fighters to return home with three good engines between them.\nIn the European theater, P-38s made 130,000 sorties with a loss of 1.3% overall, comparing favorably with P-51s, which posted a 1.1% loss, considering that the P-38s were vastly outnumbered and suffered from poorly thought-out tactics. Most of the P-38 sorties were made in the period prior to Allied air superiority in Europe, when pilots fought against a very determined and skilled enemy. Lieutenant Colonel Mark Hubbard, a vocal critic of the aircraft, rated it the third-best Allied fighter in Europe. The Lightning's greatest virtues were long range, heavy payload, high speed, fast climb, and concentrated firepower. The P-38 was a formidable fighter, interceptor, and attack aircraft.\nIn the Pacific Theater, the P-38 downed over 1,800 Japanese aircraft, with more than 100 pilots becoming aces by downing five or more enemy aircraft. American fuel supplies contributed to a better engine performance and maintenance record, and range was increased with leaner mixtures. In the second half of 1944, the P-38L pilots out of Dutch New Guinea were flying , fighting for 15 minutes and returning to base. Such long legs were invaluable until the P-47N and P-51D entered service.\nPostwar operations.\nThe end of the war left the USAAF with thousands of P-38s rendered obsolete by the jet age. Orders for 1,887 more were cancelled. The last P-38s in service with the United States Air Force were retired in 1949. One-hundred late-model P-38L and F-5 Lightnings were acquired by Italy through an agreement dated April 1946. Delivered, after refurbishing, at the rate of one per month, they finally were all sent to the Aeronautica Militare by 1952. The Lightnings served in the 4\u00b0 \"Stormo\" and other units including 3\u00b0 \"Stormo\", flying reconnaissance over the Balkans, ground attack, naval cooperation, and air-superiority missions. Due to old engines, pilot errors, and lack of experience in operations, large numbers of P-38s were lost in at least 30 accidents, many of them fatal. Despite this, many Italian pilots liked the P-38 because of its excellent visibility on the ground and stability on takeoff. The Italian P-38s were phased out in 1956; none survived the scrapyard.\nSurplus P-38s were also used by other foreign air forces, with 12 sold to Honduras and 15 retained by China. Six F-5s and two unarmed black two-seater P-38s were operated by the Dominican Air Force based in San Isidro Airbase, Dominican Republic, in 1947. Most of the wartime Lightnings present in the continental U.S. at the end of the war were put up for sale for US$1,200 apiece; the rest were scrapped. P-38s in distant theaters of war were bulldozed into piles and abandoned or scrapped; very few avoided that fate.\nThe CIA \"Liberation Air Force\" flew one P-38M to support the 1954 Guatemalan \"coup d'etat\". On 27 June 1954, this aircraft dropped napalm bombs that destroyed the British cargo ship , which was loading Guatemalan cotton and coffee for Grace Line in Puerto San Jos\u00e9. In 1957, five Honduran P-38s bombed and strafed a village occupied by Nicaraguan forces during a border dispute between these two countries concerning part of Gracias a Dios Department.\nP-38s were popular contenders in the air races from 1946 through 1949, with brightly colored Lightnings making screaming turns around the pylons at Reno and Cleveland. Lockheed test pilot Tony LeVier was among those who bought a Lightning, choosing a P-38J model and painting it red to make it stand out as an air racer and stunt flyer. Lefty Gardner, former B-24 and B-17 pilot and associate of the Confederate Air Force, bought a mid-1944 P-38L-1-LO that had been modified into an F-5G. Gardner painted it white with red and blue trim and named it \"White Lightnin'\"; he reworked its turbo systems and intercoolers for optimum low-altitude performance and gave it P-38F-style air intakes for better streamlining. \"White Lightnin'\" was severely damaged in a crash landing following an engine fire on a transit flight, and was bought and restored with a brilliant polished-aluminum finish by the company that owns Red Bull. The aircraft is now located in Austria.\nF-5s were bought by aerial survey companies and employed for mapping. From the 1950s on, the use of the Lightning steadily declined, and only a few more than two dozen still exist, with few still flying. One example is a P-38L owned by the Lone Star Flight Museum in Galveston, Texas, painted in the colors of Charles H. MacDonald's \"Putt Putt Maru\". Two other examples are F-5Gs, which were owned and operated by Kargl Aerial Surveys in 1946, and are now located in Chino, California, at Yanks Air Museum, and in McMinnville, Oregon, at Evergreen Aviation Museum. The earliest-built surviving P-38, \"Glacier Girl\", was recovered from the Greenland ice cap in 1992, 50 years after she crashed there on a ferry flight to the UK, and after a complete restoration, flew once again 10 years after her recovery.\nProduction.\nOver 10,000 Lightnings were manufactured, becoming the only U.S. combat aircraft that remained in continuous production throughout the duration of American participation in World War II. The Lightning had a major effect on other aircraft; its wing, in a scaled-up form, was used on the Lockheed Constellation.\nP-38D and P-38Es.\nDelivered and accepted Lightning production variants began with the P-38D model. The few \"handmade\" YP-38s initially contracted were used as trainers and test aircraft. No Bs or Cs were delivered to the government as the USAAF allocated the 'D' suffix to all aircraft with self-sealing fuel tanks and armor. Many secondary but still initial teething tests were conducted using the earliest D variants.\nThe first combat-capable Lightning was the P-38E (and its photo-recon variant the F-4) which featured improved instruments, electrical, and hydraulic systems. Part-way through production, the older Hamilton Standard Hydromatic hollow steel propellers were replaced by new Curtiss Electric duraluminum propellers. The definitive (and now famous) armament configuration was settled upon, featuring four .50\u00a0in (12.7\u00a0mm) machine guns with 500 rpg, and a 20\u00a0mm (.79\u00a0in) Hispano autocannon with 150 rounds.\nWhile the machine guns had been arranged symmetrically in the nose on the P-38D, they were \"staggered\" in the P-38E and later versions, with the muzzles protruding from the nose in the relative lengths of roughly 1:4:6:2. This was done to ensure a straight ammunition-belt feed into the weapons, as the earlier arrangement led to jamming.\nThe first P-38E rolled out of the factory in October 1941 as the Battle of Moscow filled the news wires of the world. Because of the versatility, redundant engines, and especially high-speed and high-altitude characteristics of the aircraft, as with later variants, over 100 P-38Es were completed in the factory or converted in the field to a photoreconnaissance variant, the F-4, in which the guns were replaced by four cameras. Most of these early reconnaissance Lightnings were retained stateside for training, but the F-4 was the first Lightning to be used in action in April 1942.\nP-38Fs and P-38Gs.\nAfter 210 P-38Es were built, they were followed, starting in February 1942, by the P-38F, which incorporated racks inboard of the engines for fuel tanks or a total of of bombs. Early variants did not have a high reputation for maneuverability, though they could be agile at low altitudes if flown by a capable pilot, using the P-38's forgiving stall characteristics to their best advantage. From the P-38F-15 model onwards, a \"combat maneuver\" setting was added to the P-38's Fowler flaps. When deployed at the 8\u00b0 maneuver setting, the flaps allowed the P-38 to out-turn many contemporary single-engined fighters at the cost of some added drag. However, early variants were hampered by high aileron control forces and a low initial rate of roll, and all such features required a pilot to gain experience with the aircraft, which in part was an additional reason Lockheed sent its representative to England, and later to the Pacific theater.\nThe aircraft was still experiencing extensive teething troubles, as well as being victimized by \"urban legends\", mostly involving inapplicable twin-engined factors which had been designed out of the aircraft by Lockheed. In addition to these, the early versions had a reputation as a \"widow maker\", as they could enter an unrecoverable dive due to a sonic surface effect at high subsonic speeds. The 527 P-38Fs were heavier, with more powerful engines that used more fuel, and were unpopular in the air war in Northern Europe. Since the heavier engines were having reliability problems and with them, without external fuel tanks, the range of the P-38F was reduced, and since drop tanks themselves were in short supply as the fortunes in the Battle of the Atlantic had not yet swung the Allies' way, the aircraft became relatively unpopular in minds of the bomber command planning staffs despite being the longest-ranged fighter first available to the 8th Air Force in sufficient numbers for long-range escort duties. Nonetheless, General Spaatz, then commander of the 8th Air Force in the UK, said of the P-38F: \"I'd rather have an airplane that goes like hell and has a few things wrong with it, than one that won't go like hell and has a few things wrong with it.\"\nThe P-38F was followed in June 1942 by the P-38G, using more powerful Allisons of each and equipped with a better radio. A dozen of the planned P-38G production were set aside to serve as prototypes for what became the P-38J with further uprated Allison V-1710F-17 engines ( each) in redesigned booms, which featured chin-mounted intercoolers in place of the original system in the leading edge of the wings and more efficient radiators. Lockheed subcontractors, however, were initially unable to supply both of Burbank's twin production lines with a sufficient quantity of new core intercoolers and radiators. War Production Board planners were unwilling to sacrifice production, and one of the two remaining prototypes received the new engines, but retained the old leading-edge intercoolers and radiators.\nAs the P-38H, 600 of these stop-gap Lightnings with an improved 20\u00a0mm cannon and a bomb capacity of were produced on one line beginning in May 1943, while the near-definitive P-38J began production on the second line in August 1943. The Eighth Air Force was experiencing high-altitude and cold-weather issues, which while not unique to the aircraft, were perhaps more severe as the turbosuperchargers upgrading the Allisons were having their own reliability issues, making the aircraft more unpopular with senior officers out of the line. This was a situation unduplicated on all other fronts, where the commands were clamoring for as many P-38s as they could get. Both the P-38G and P-38H models' performances were restricted by an intercooler system integral to the wing's leading edge, which had been designed for the YP-38's less powerful engines. At the higher boost levels, the new engine's charge air temperature would increase above the limits recommended by Allison and would be subject to detonation if operated at high power for extended periods of time. Reliability was not the only issue, either. For example, the reduced power settings required by the P-38H did not allow the maneuvering flap to be used to good advantage at high altitude. All these problems really came to a head in the unplanned P-38H and sped the Lightning's eventual replacement in the 8th Air Force; fortunately, the 15th Air Force was glad to get them.\nSome P-38G production was diverted on the assembly line to F-5A reconnaissance aircraft. An F-5A was modified to an experimental two-seat reconnaissance configuration as the XF-5D, with a Plexiglas nose, two machine guns, and additional cameras in the tail booms.\nP-38J, P-38L.\nThe P-38J was introduced in August 1943. The turbosupercharger intercooler system on previous variants had been housed in the leading edges of the wings and had proven vulnerable to combat damage and could burst if the wrong series of controls was mistakenly activated. In the P-38J series, the streamlined engine nacelles of previous Lightnings were changed to fit the intercooler radiator between the oil coolers, forming a \"chin\" that visually distinguished the J model from its predecessors. While the P-38J used the same V-1710-89/91 engines as the H model, the new core-type intercooler more efficiently lowered intake manifold temperatures and permitted a substantial increase in rated power. The leading edge of the outer wing was fitted with fuel tanks, filling the space formerly occupied by intercooler tunnels, but these were omitted on early P-38J blocks due to limited availability.\nThe final 210 J models, designated P-38J-25-LO, alleviated the compressibility problem through the addition of a set of electrically actuated dive recovery flaps just outboard of the engines on the bottom centerline of the wings. With these improvements, a USAAF pilot reported a dive speed of almost , although the indicated air speed was later corrected for compressibility error, and the actual dive speed was lower. Lockheed manufactured over 200 retrofit modification kits to be installed on P-38J-10-LO and J-20-LO already in Europe, but the USAAF C-54 carrying them was shot down by an RAF pilot who mistook the Douglas transport for a German Focke-Wulf Condor. Unfortunately, the loss of the kits came during Lockheed test pilot Tony LeVier's four-month morale-boosting tour of P-38 bases. Flying a new Lightning named \"Snafuperman\", modified to full P-38J-25-LO specifications at Lockheed's modification center near Belfast, LeVier captured the pilots' full attention by routinely performing maneuvers during March 1944 that common 8th Air Force wisdom held to be suicidal. It proved too little, too late, because the decision had already been made to re-equip with Mustangs.\nThe P-38J-25-LO production block also introduced hydraulically boosted ailerons, one of the first times such a system was fitted to a fighter. This significantly improved the Lightning's rate of roll and reduced control forces for the pilot. This production block and the following P-38L model are considered the definitive Lightnings, and Lockheed ramped up production, working with subcontractors across the country to produce hundreds of Lightnings each month.\nThe P-38L was the most numerous variant of the Lightning, with 3,923 built, 113 by Consolidated-Vultee in their Nashville plant. It entered service with the USAAF in June 1944, in time to support the Allied invasion of France on D-Day. Lockheed production of the Lightning was distinguished by a suffix consisting of a production block number followed by \"LO,\" for example \"P-38L-1-LO\", while Consolidated-Vultee production was distinguished by a block number followed by \"VN,\" for example \"P-38L-5-VN.\"\nThe P-38L was the first Lightning fitted with zero-length rocket launchers. Seven high-velocity aircraft rockets (HVARs) on pylons were placed beneath each wing, and later, five HVARs were on each wing on \"Christmas tree\" launch racks, which added to the aircraft. The P-38L also had strengthened stores pylons to allow carriage of bombs or drop tanks.\nLockheed modified 200 P-38J airframes in production to become unarmed F-5B photo-reconnaissance aircraft, while hundreds of other P-38Js and P-38Ls were modified at Lockheed's Dallas Modification Center to become F-5Cs, F-5Es, F-5Fs, or F-5Gs. A few P-38Ls were field modified to become two-seat TP-38L familiarization trainers. During and after June 1948, the remaining J and L variants were designated ZF-38J and ZF-38L, with the \"ZF\" designator (meaning \"obsolete fighter\") replacing the \"P for Pursuit\" category.\nLate-model Lightnings were delivered unpainted, per USAAF policy established in 1944. At first, field units tried to paint them, since pilots worried about being too visible to the enemy, but the reduction in weight and drag turned out to be a minor advantage in combat.\nThe P-38L-5, the most common subvariant of the P-38L, had a modified cockpit heating system consisting of a plug-socket in the cockpit into which the pilot could plug his heat-suit wire for improved comfort. These Lightnings also received the uprated V-1710-112/113 (F30R/L) engines, and this dramatically lowered the number of engine-failure problems experienced at high altitude so commonly associated with European operations.\nP-38K.\nTwo P-38Ks were developed from 1942 to 1943, one official and one an internal Lockheed experiment. The first was actually a battered RP-38E \"piggyback\" test mule previously used by Lockheed to test the P-38J chin intercooler installation, now fitted with paddle-bladed \"high-activity\" Hamilton Standard Hydromatic propellers similar to those used on the P-47. The new propellers required spinners of greater diameter, and the mule's crude, hand-formed sheet steel cowlings were further stretched to blend the spinners into the nacelles. It retained its \"piggyback\" configuration that allowed an observer to ride behind the pilot. With Lockheed's AAF representative as a passenger and the maneuvering flap deployed to offset Army Hot Day conditions, the old \"K-Mule\" still climbed to . With a fresh coat of paint covering its crude, hand-formed steel cowlings, this RP-38E acts as stand-in for the \"P-38K-1-LO\" in the model's only picture.\nThe 12th G model originally set aside as a P-38J prototype was redesignated P-38K-1-LO and fitted with the aforementioned paddle-blade propellers and new Allison V-1710-75/77 (F15R/L) powerplants rated at at War Emergency Power. These engines were geared 2.36 to 1, unlike the standard P-38 ratio of 2 to 1. The AAF took delivery in September 1943, at Eglin Field. In tests, the P-38K-1 achieved at military power and was predicted to exceed at War Emergency Power with a similar increase in load and range. The initial climb rate was /min and the ceiling was . It reached in five minutes flat; this with a coat of camouflage paint, which added weight and drag. Although it was judged superior in climb and speed to the latest and best fighters from all AAF manufacturers, the War Production Board refused to authorize P-38K production due to the two- to three-week interruption in production necessary to implement cowling modifications for the revised spinners and higher thrust line. Some had also doubted Allison's ability to deliver the F15 engine in quantity. As promising as it had looked, the P-38K project came to a halt.\nPathfinders, night-fighter, and other variants.\nThe Lightning was modified for other roles. In addition to the F-4 and F-5 reconnaissance variants, several P-38Js and P-38Ls were field modified as formation bombing \"pathfinders\" or \"droopsnoots\", fitted with a Norden bombsight or an H2X radar system. Such pathfinders would lead a formation of other P-38s, each loaded with two bombs; the entire formation releasing their ordnance when the pathfinder did.\nA number of Lightnings were modified as night fighters. Several field or experimental modifications with different equipment fits finally led to the \"formal\" P-38M night fighter, or \"Night Lightning\". In total, 75 P-38Ls were modified to the Night Lightning configuration, painted flat-black with conical flash hiders on the guns, an AN/APS-6 radar pod below the nose, and a second cockpit with a raised canopy behind the pilot's canopy for the radar operator. The headroom in the rear cockpit was limited, requiring radar operators who were preferably short in stature.\nOne of the initial-production P-38s had its turbosuperchargers removed, with a secondary cockpit placed in one of the booms to examine how flight crews would respond to such an \"asymmetric\" cockpit layout. One P-38E was fitted with an extended central nacelle to accommodate a tandem-seat cockpit with dual controls, and was later fitted with a laminar-flow wing.\nVery early in the Pacific War, a scheme was proposed to fit Lightnings with floats to allow them to make long-range ferry flights. The floats would be removed before the aircraft went into combat. Concerns arose that saltwater spray would corrode the tailplane, so in March 1942, P-38E 41-1986 was modified with a tailplane raised some , booms lengthened by 2\u00a0ft, and a rearward-facing second seat added for an observer to monitor the effectiveness of the new arrangement. A second version was crafted on the same airframe with the twin booms given greater sideplane area to augment the vertical rudders. This arrangement was removed and a final third version was fabricated that had the booms returned to normal length, but the tail raised . All three tail modifications were designed by George H. \"Bert\" Estabrook. The final version was used for a quick series of dive tests on 7 December 1942 in which Milo Burcham performed the test maneuvers and Kelly Johnson observed from the rear seat. Johnson concluded that the raised floatplane tail gave no advantage in solving the problem of compressibility. At no time was this P-38E testbed airframe actually fitted with floats, and the idea was quickly abandoned, as the U.S. Navy proved to have enough sealift capacity to keep up with P-38 deliveries to the South Pacific.\nStill another P-38E was used in 1942 to tow a Waco troop glider as a demonstration. However, there proved to be plenty of other aircraft, such as Douglas C-47 Skytrains, available to tow gliders, and the Lightning was spared this duty.\nStandard Lightnings were used as crew and cargo transports in the South Pacific. They were fitted with pods attached to the underwing pylons, replacing drop tanks or bombs, that could carry a single passenger in a lying-down position, or cargo. This was a very uncomfortable way to fly. Some of the pods were not even fitted with a window to let the passenger see out or bring in light.\nLockheed proposed a carrier-based Model 822 version of the Lightning for the US Navy. The Model 822 would have featured folding wings, an arresting hook, and stronger undercarriage for carrier operations. The Navy was not interested, as they regarded the Lightning as too big for carrier operations and did not like liquid-cooled engines; therefore, the Model 822 never went beyond the paper stage. The Navy did operate, though, four land-based F-5Bs in North Africa, inherited from the USAAF and redesignated FO-1.\nA P-38J was used in experiments with an unusual scheme for midair refueling, in which the fighter snagged a drop tank trailed on a cable from a bomber. The USAAF managed to make this work, but decided it was not practical. A P-38J was also fitted with experimental retractable snow-ski landing gear, but this idea never reached operational service, either.\nAfter the war, a P-38L was experimentally fitted with armament of three .60\u00a0in (15.2\u00a0mm) machine guns. The .60\u00a0in (15.2\u00a0mm) caliber cartridge had been developed early in the war for an infantry antitank rifle, a type of weapon developed by a number of nations in the 1930s when tanks were lighter, but by 1942, armor was too tough for this caliber.\nAnother P-38L was modified after the war as a \"super strafer\", with eight .50\u00a0in (12.7\u00a0mm) machine guns in the nose and a pod under each wing with two .50\u00a0in (12.7\u00a0mm) guns, for a total of 12 machine guns. Nothing came of this conversion, either.\nOperators.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nCivil\nNoted P-38s.\n\"Yippee\".\nThe 5,000th Lightning built, a P-38J-20-LO, \"44-23296\", was painted bright vermilion red, and had the name \"YIPPEE\" painted on the underside of the wings in large white letters, as well as the signatures of hundreds of factory workers. This and other aircraft were used by a handful of Lockheed test pilots including Milo Burcham, Jimmie Mattern, and Tony LeVier in remarkable flight demonstrations, performing such stunts as slow rolls at treetop level with one prop feathered to dispel the myth that the P-38 was unmanageable.\nSurviving aircraft.\nOf the ten thousand aircraft built, there are 26 survivors of which ten are airworthy.\nNoted P-38 pilots.\nRichard Bong and Thomas McGuire.\nThe American ace of aces and his closest competitor both flew Lightnings and tallied 40 and 38 victories, respectively. Majors Richard I. \"Dick\" Bong and Thomas B. \"Tommy\" McGuire of the USAAF competed for the top position. Both men were awarded the Medal of Honor.\nMcGuire was killed in air combat in January 1945 over the Philippines, after accumulating 38 confirmed kills, making him the second-ranking American ace. Bong was rotated back to the United States as America's ace of aces, after making 40 kills, becoming a test pilot. He was killed on 6 August 1945, the day the atomic bomb was dropped on Japan, when his Lockheed P-80 Shooting Star jet fighter flamed out on take-off.\nCharles Lindbergh.\nCharles Lindbergh became famous for his transatlantic solo flight before the war. By WWII he was a civilian working for Vought in the South Pacific area. He received preferential treatment as if a visiting colonel. \nIn Hollandia, Lindbergh attached himself to the 475th Fighter Group which was flying P-38s. Although new to the aircraft, Lindbergh was instrumental in extending the range of the P-38 through improved throttle settings, or engine-leaning techniques, notably by reducing engine speed to 1,600\u00a0rpm, setting the carburetors for auto-lean and flying at indicated airspeed, which reduced fuel consumption to 70\u00a0gal/h, about 2.6\u00a0mpg. This combination of settings had been considered dangerous as it was believed this would upset the fuel mixture, causing an explosion.\nWhile with the 475th, he took part in a number of combat missions. On 28 July 1944, Lindbergh shot down a Mitsubishi Ki-51 \"Sonia\" flown by the veteran commander of the 73rd Independent Flying Chutai of the Imperial Japanese Army Captain Saburo Shimada. In an extended, twisting dogfight in which many of the participants ran out of ammunition, Shimada turned his aircraft directly toward Lindbergh, who was just approaching the combat area. Lindbergh fired in a defensive reaction brought on by Shimada's apparent head-on ramming attack. Hit by cannon and machine-gun fire, the \"Sonia's\" propeller visibly slowed, but Shimada held his course. Lindbergh pulled up at the last moment to avoid collision as the damaged \"Sonia\" went into a steep dive, hit the ocean, and sank. The unofficial kill was not entered in the 475th's war record. On 12 August 1944, Lindbergh left Hollandia to return to the United States.\nCharles MacDonald.\nThe third-ranking American ace of the Pacific theater, Charles H. MacDonald, flew a Lightning against the Japanese and scored 27 kills in his aircraft, the \"Putt Putt Maru\".\nMartin James Monti.\nMartin James Monti was an American pilot who defected to the Axis powers in a stolen F-5E Lightning, which was handed over to the \"Luftwaffe\" \"Zirkus Rosarius\" for testing afterward.\nRobin Olds.\nRobin Olds was the last P-38 ace in the 8th Air Force and the last in the ETO. Flying a P-38J, he downed five German fighters on two separate missions over France and Germany. He subsequently transitioned to P-51s and scored seven more kills. After World War II, he flew F-4 Phantom IIs in Vietnam, ending his career as brigadier general with 16 kills.\nJohn H. Ross.\nRoss is a decorated World War II pilot who flew 96 missions for the U.S. Army Air Forces under the U.S. 8th Air Force's 7th Reconnaissance Group in the 22nd Reconnaissance Squadron. Ross flew the Lockheed P-38 Lightning as a photo-reconnaissance pilot out of RAF Mount Farm in England during the war. He received 11 medals and was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross twice for missions that were integral to Allied victory at the Battle of the Bulge.\nAntoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry.\nAt midday on 31 July 1944, noted aviation pioneer and writer Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry (\"Night Flight\", \"Wind, Sand and Stars\" and \"The Little Prince\") vanished in his P-38 of the French Arm\u00e9e de l'Air's \"Groupe de Chasse II/33\", after departing Borgo-Porreta, Corsica. His health, both physically and mentally, had been deteriorating. Saint-Exup\u00e9ry was said to be intermittently subject to depression and talk had arisen of taking him off flying status. He was on a flight over the Mediterranean, from Corsica to mainland France, in an unarmed F-5B photo-reconnaissance variant of the P-38J, described as being a \"war-weary, nonairworthy craft\".\nIn 2000, a French scuba diver found the partial remnants of a Lightning spread over several thousand square meters of the Mediterranean seabed off the coast of Marseille. In April 2004, the recovered component serial numbers were confirmed as being from Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's F-5B Lightning. Only a small amount of the aircraft's wreckage was recovered. In June 2004, the recovered parts and fragments were given to the Air and Space Museum of France in Le Bourget, Paris, where Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's life is commemorated in a special exhibit.\nIn 1981 and also in 2008, two Luftwaffe fighter pilots, respectively Robert Heichele and Horst Rippert, separately claimed to have shot down Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's P-38. Both claims were unverifiable and possibly self-promotional, as neither of their units' combat records of action from that period made any note of such a shoot-down.\nSpecifications (P-38L).\n\"Data from\" Lockheed P-38H/J/L Pilot's Flight Operating Instructions, P-38H/J/L Pilot's Flight Operating InstructionsGeneral characteristics* Crew: 1* Aspect ratio: 8.26* Airfoil: root: NACA 23016; tip: NACA 4412* Propellers: 3-bladed Curtiss electric constant-speed propellers (LH and RH rotation)\nPerformance* Endurance: * g limits: * Roll rate: * Maximum glide ratio: * Lift-to-drag: 13.5\nArmament\nPopular culture.\nHarley Earl arranged for several of his designers to view a YP-38 prototype shortly before World War II, and its design directly inspired the tail fins of the 1948\u20131949 Cadillac.\nThe P-38 was also the inspiration for Raymond Loewy and his design team at Studebaker for the 1950 and 1951 model-year Studebakers.\nThe whine of the speeder bike engines in \"Return of the Jedi\" was partly achieved by recording the engine noise of a P-38, combined with that of a North American P-51 Mustang.\nThe popular eight-bit video game \"1942\" puts the player in command of a P-38 flying over the Pacific, fighting against Japanese Zeros and the Nakajima G10N bomber.

In the narrow sense, the term refers to an act of supplication or intercession directed towards a deity or a deified ancestor. More generally, prayer can also have the purpose of giving thanks or praise, and in comparative religion is closely associated with more abstract forms of meditation and with charms or spells.\nPrayer can take a variety of forms: it can be part of a set liturgy or ritual, and it can be performed alone or in groups. Prayer may take the form of a hymn, incantation, formal creedal statement, or a spontaneous utterance in the praying person.\nThe act of prayer is attested in written sources as early as five thousand years ago. Today, most major religions involve prayer in one way or another; some ritualize the act, requiring a strict sequence of actions or placing a restriction on who is permitted to pray, while others teach that prayer may be practiced spontaneously by anyone at any time.\nScientific studies regarding the use of prayer have mostly concentrated on its effect on the healing of sick or injured people. The efficacy of prayer in faith healing has been evaluated in numerous studies, with contradictory results.\nEtymology.\nThe English term \"prayer\" is from . The Vulgate Latin is , which translates Greek \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c3\u03b5\u03c5\u03c7\u03ae in turn the Septuagint translation of Biblical Hebrew \"t\u0115phillah\".\nAct of prayer.\nVarious spiritual traditions offer a wide variety of devotional acts. There are morning and evening prayers, grace said over meals, and reverent physical gestures. Some Christians bow their heads and fold their hands. Some Native Americans regard dancing as a form of prayer. Hindus chant mantras. Jewish prayer may involve swaying back and forth and bowing. Muslim prayer involves bowing, kneeling, and prostration, while some Sufis whirl.\nWithin Christian circles, Friedrich Heiler is frequently referenced for his \"Typology of Prayer\", which systematically lists six types of prayer: primitive, ritual, Greek cultural, philosophical, mystical, and prophetic. Some forms of prayer require a prior ritualistic form of cleansing or purification, such as ghusl and wudhu.\nPrayer may occur privately and individually (sometimes called affective prayer), or collectively, shared by or led on behalf of fellow-believers of either a specific faith tradition or a broader grouping of people. Prayer can be incorporated into a daily \"thought life\", in which one is in constant communication with a god. Some people pray throughout all that is happening during the day and seek guidance as the day progresses. This practice is regarded as a requirement in several Christian denominations. There can be many different answers to prayer, just as there are many ways to interpret an answer to a question, if there in fact comes an answer.\nSome traditions distinguish between contemplative and meditative prayer. Contemplation is a foundational type of prayer in the Catholic faith, but it's distinct from other forms of prayer, like meditation. Meditation is the use of the understanding, the reasoning faculty to come to know God's revelation better. Contemplation is the use of the imagination to achieve the same end.\nOutward acts that may accompany prayer include anointing with oil; ringing a bell; burning incense or paper; lighting a candle or candles; facing a specific direction (e.g., towards Mecca or the East);\nand making the sign of the cross. One less noticeable act related to prayer is fasting.\nA variety of body postures may be assumed, often with specific meaning (mainly respect or adoration) associated with prayer: standing; sitting; kneeling; prostrate on the floor; eyes opened; eyes closed; hands folded or clasped; hands upraised; holding hands with others; a laying on of hands and others. Prayers may be recited from memory, read from a book of prayers, or composed spontaneously or \"impromptu\". They may be said, chanted, or sung. They may or may not have a musical accompaniment. There may be a time of outward silence while prayers are offered mentally. Often, there are prayers to fit specific occasions, such as the blessing of a meal, the birth or death of a loved one, other significant events in the life of a believer, or days of the year that have special religious significance. Details corresponding to specific traditions are outlined below.\nOrigins and early history.\nAnthropologically, the concept of prayer is closely related to that of surrender and supplication.\nThe traditional posture of prayer in medieval Europe is kneeling or supine with clasped hands, in antiquity more typically with raised hands. The early Christian prayer posture was standing, looking up to heaven, with outspread arms and bare head. This is the pre-Christian, pagan prayer posture (except for the bare head, which was prescribed for males in I Corinthians 11:4; in Roman paganism, the head had to be covered in prayer). Certain Cretan and Cypriote figures of the Late Bronze Age, with arms raised, have been interpreted as worshippers. Their posture is similar to the \"flight\" posture, a crouching posture with raised hands related to the universal \"hands up\" gesture of surrender. The kneeling posture with clasped hands appears to have been introduced only with the beginning high medieval period, presumably adopted from a gesture of feudal homage.\nAlthough prayer in its literal sense is not used in animism, communication with the spirit world is vital to the animist way of life. This is usually accomplished through a shaman who, through a trance, gains access to the spirit world and then shows the spirits' thoughts to the people. Other ways to receive messages from the spirits include using astrology or contemplating fortune tellers and healers.\nSome of the oldest extant literature, such as the Kesh temple hymn (c. 26th century BC), is liturgy addressed to deities and thus technically \"prayer\". The Egyptian Pyramid Texts of about the same period similarly contain spells or incantations addressed to the gods. In the loosest sense, in the form of magical thinking combined with animism, prayer has been argued as representing a human cultural universal, which would have been present since the emergence of behavioral modernity, by anthropologists such as Sir Edward Burnett Tylor and Sir James George Frazer.\nReliable records are available for the polytheistic religions of the Iron Age, most notably Ancient Greek religion, which strongly influenced Roman religion. These religious traditions were direct developments of the earlier Bronze Age religions.\nCeremonial prayer was highly formulaic and ritualized.\nIn ancient polytheism, ancestor worship is indistinguishable from theistic worship (see also euhemerism).\nVestiges of ancestor worship persist, to a greater or lesser extent, in modern religious traditions throughout the world, most notably in Japanese Shinto, Vietnamese folk religion, and Chinese folk religion. The practices involved in Shinto prayer are heavily influenced by Buddhism; Japanese Buddhism has also been strongly influenced by Shinto in turn. Shinto prayers quite frequently consist of wishes or favors asked of the \"kami\", rather than lengthy praises or devotions. The practice of votive offering is universal and is attested at least since the Bronze Age. In Shinto, this takes the form of a small wooden tablet, called an \"ema\".\nPrayers in Etruscan were used in the Roman world by augurs and other oracles long after Etruscan became a dead language. The Carmen Arvale and the Carmen Saliare are two specimens of partially preserved prayers that seem to have been unintelligible to their scribes and whose language is full of archaisms and difficult passages.\nRoman prayers and sacrifices were envisioned as legal bargains between deity and worshipper. The Roman principle was expressed as \"do ut des\": \"I give, so that you may give.\" Cato the Elder's treatise on agriculture contains many examples of preserved traditional prayers; in one, a farmer addresses the unknown deity of a possibly sacred grove, and sacrifices a pig in order to placate the god or goddess of the place and beseech his or her permission to cut down some trees from the grove.\nCeltic, Germanic and Slavic religions are recorded much later, and much more fragmentarily, than the religions of classical antiquity. Nevertheless, they show substantial parallels to the better-attested religions of the Iron Age. In the case of Germanic religion, the practice of prayer is reliably attested, but no actual liturgy is recorded from the early (Roman era) period. An Old Norse prayer is on record in the form of a dramatization in skaldic poetry. This prayer is recorded in stanzas2 and3 of the poem \"Sigrdr\u00edfum\u00e1l\", compiled in the 13th century \"Poetic Edda\" from earlier traditional sources, where the valkyrie Sigrdr\u00edfa prays to the gods and the earth after being woken by the hero Sigurd.\nA prayer to Odin is mentioned in chapter2 of the \"V\u00f6lsunga saga\" where King Rerir prays for a child. In stanza9 of the poem \"Oddr\u00fanargr\u00e1tr\", a prayer is made to \"kind wights, Frigg and Freyja, and many gods, In chapter 21 of \"J\u00f3msv\u00edkinga saga\", wishing to turn the tide of the Battle of Hj\u00f6rungav\u00e1gr, Haakon Sigurdsson eventually finds his prayers answered by the goddesses \u00deorger\u00f0r H\u00f6lgabr\u00fa\u00f0r and Irpa.\nFolk religion in the medieval period produced syncretisms between pre-Christian and Christian traditions. An example is the 11th-century Anglo-Saxon charm \"\u00c6cerbot\" for the fertility of crops and land, or the medical \"Wi\u00f0 f\u00e6rstice\". The 8th-century Wessobrunn Prayer has been proposed as a Christianized pagan prayer and compared to the pagan \"V\u00f6lusp\u00e1\" and the Merseburg Incantations, the latter recorded in the 9th or 10th century but of much older traditional origins.\nAboriginal Australians.\nIn traditional Australian Aboriginal religion and mythology, cultural values such as connection to country and knowledge of totemic ancestral beings have been essential to human occupation and survival on the continent for over 65,000 years. This knowledge and empowerment is passed down through story-telling, art, performance, and initiation by tribal elders (the most adept of these healers or sorcerers are known respectively as clevermen (and clever women), or \"kurdaitcha\".) Sacred objects believed to give them their powers include tjurunga and maban.). In contemporary Australia, Indigenous connection to country is linked to increasing recognition, respect and protection for sacred sites, repatriation of Indigenous remains held in overseas museums for reburial on country, and finds expression through rituals such as welcome to country and smoking ceremonies often held at the beginning of civic and other public events.\nNorth America.\nThe Pueblo Indians of North America are known to have used prayer sticks, that is, sticks with feathers attached as supplicatory offerings. The Hopi Indians used prayer sticks as well, but they attached to it a small bag of sacred meal.\nApproaches to prayer.\nDirect petitions.\nThere are different forms of prayer. One of them is to directly appeal to a deity to grant one's requests. Some have termed this as the social approach to prayer.\nAtheist arguments against prayer are mostly directed against petitionary prayer in particular. Daniel Dennett argued that petitionary prayer might have the undesirable psychological effect of relieving a person of the need to take active measures.\nThis potential drawback manifests in extreme forms in such cases as Christian Scientists who rely on prayers instead of seeking medical treatment for family members for easily curable conditions which later result in death.\nChristopher Hitchens (2012) argued that praying to a god which is omnipotent and all-knowing would be presumptuous. For example, he interprets Ambrose Bierce's definition of prayer by stating that \"the man who prays is the one who thinks that god has arranged matters all wrong, but who also thinks that he can instruct god how to put them right.\"\nEducational approach.\nIn this view, prayer is not a conversation. Rather, it is meant to inculcate certain attitudes in the one who prays, but not to influence. Among Jews, this has been the approach of Rabbenu Bachya, Rabbi Yehuda Halevi, Joseph Albo, Samson Raphael Hirsch, and Joseph B. Soloveitchik. This view is expressed by Rabbi Nosson Scherman in the overview to the Artscroll Siddur (p.\u00a0XIII).\nAmong Christian theologians, E.M. Bounds stated the educational purpose of prayer in every chapter of his book, \"The Necessity of Prayer\". Prayer books such as the Book of Common Prayer are both a result of this approach and an exhortation to keep it.\nRationalist approach.\nIn this view, the ultimate goal of prayer is to help train a person to focus on divinity through philosophy and intellectual contemplation (meditation). This approach was taken by the Jewish scholar and philosopher Maimonides and the other medieval rationalists. It became popular in Jewish, Christian, and Islamic intellectual circles, but never became the most popular understanding of prayer among the laity in any of these faiths.\nIn a rationalist approach, praying encompasses three aspects. First, 'logos', as the \"idea\" of the sender, secondly 'rhemata' as the words to express the idea, and thirdly 'rhemata' and 'logos', to where the idea is sent (e.g. to God, Allah). Thus praying is not a conversation with God, or Jesus but a one-way direction to the divine. Among the Abrahamic religions, Islam, Orthodox Christianity and Hasidic Judaism are likely most adhering to this concept, also because it does not allow secondary mythologies, and has taken its spiritual roots from Hellenistic philosophy, particularly from Aristotle.\nSimilarly in Hinduism, the different divinities are manifestations of one God with associated prayers. However, many Indians \u2013 particularly Hindus \u2013 believe that God can be manifest in people, including in people of lower castes, such as Sadhus.\nExperiential approach.\nIn this approach, the purpose of prayer is to enable the person praying to gain a direct experience of the recipient of the prayer (or as close to direct as a specific theology permits). This approach is very significant in Christianity and widespread in Judaism (although less popular theologically). In Eastern Orthodoxy, this approach is known as hesychasm. It is also widespread in Sufi Islam, and in some forms of mysticism. It has some similarities with the rationalist approach, since it can also involve contemplation, although the contemplation is not generally viewed as being as rational or intellectual.\nChristian and Roman Catholic traditions also include an experiential approach to prayer within the practice of \"lectio divina\". Historically a Benedictine practice, \"lectio divina\" involves the following steps: a short scripture passage is read aloud; the passage is meditated upon using the mind to place the listener within a relationship or dialogue with the text; recitation of a prayer; and concludes with contemplation. The Catechism of the Catholic Church describes prayer and meditation as follows: Meditation engages thought, imagination, emotion, and desire. This mobilization of faculties is necessary in order to deepen our convictions of faith, prompt the conversion of our heart, and strengthen our will to follow Christ. Christian prayer tries above all to meditate on the mysteries of Christ, as in lectio divina or the rosary. This form of prayerful reflection is of great value, but Christian prayer should go further: to the knowledge of the love of the Lord Jesus, to union with him.\nThe experience of God within Christian mysticism has been contrasted with the concept of experiential religion or mystical experience because of a long history or authors living and writing about experience with the divine in a manner that identifies God as unknowable and ineffable, the language of such ideas could be characterized paradoxically as \"experiential\", as well as without the phenomena of experience.\nIn the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries, several historical figures put forth very influential views that religion and its beliefs can be grounded in experience itself. While Kant held that moral experience justified religious beliefs, John Wesley in addition to stressing individual moral exertion thought that the religious experiences in the Methodist movement (paralleling the Romantic Movement) were foundational to religious commitment as a way of life. According to catholic doctrine, Methodists lack a ritualistic and rational approach to praying but rely on individualistic and moralistic forms of worship in direct conversation with God. This approach is rejected by most Orthodox religions.\nWayne Proudfoot traces the roots of the notion of \"religious experience\" to the German theologian Friedrich Schleiermacher (1768\u20131834), who argued that religion is based on a feeling of the infinite. The notion of \"religious experience\" was used by Schleiermacher and Albert Ritschl to defend religion against the growing scientific and secular critique, and defend the view that human (moral and religious) experience justifies religious beliefs.\nSuch religious empiricism would be later seen as highly problematic and was\u00a0\u2013 during the period in-between world wars\u00a0\u2013 famously rejected by Karl Barth. In the 20th century, religious as well as moral experience as justification for religious beliefs still holds sway. Some influential modern scholars holding this liberal theological view are Charles Raven and the Oxford physicist/theologian Charles Coulson.\nThe notion of \"religious experience\" was adopted by many scholars of religion, of whom William James was the most influential. However, this notion of \"experience\" has been criticized. Robert Sharf points out that \"experience\" is a typical Western term, which has found its way into Asian religiosity via western influences. The notion of \"experience\" introduces a false notion of duality between \"experiencer\" and \"experienced\", whereas the essence of kensho is the realisation of the \"non-duality\" of observer and observed. \"Pure experience\" does not exist; all experience is mediated by intellectual and cognitive activity. The specific teachings and practices of a specific tradition may even determine what \"experience\" someone has, which means that this \"experience\" is not the \"proof\" of the teaching, but a \"result\" of the teaching. A pure consciousness without concepts, reached by \"cleaning the doors of perception\", would be an overwhelming chaos of sensory input without coherence.\nAbrahamic religions.\nHebrew Bible.\nIn the Hebrew Bible, prayer is an evolving means of interacting with God, most frequently through a spontaneous, individual, unorganized form of petitioning and/or thanking. Standardized prayer such as is done today is non-existent, although beginning in Deuteronomy, the Bible lays the groundwork for organized prayer, including basic liturgical guidelines, and by the Bible's later books, prayer has evolved to a more standardized form, although still radically different from the form practiced by modern Jews.\nIndividual prayer is described by the Tanakh in two ways. The first of these is when prayer is described as occurring, and a result is achieved, but no further information regarding a person's prayer is given. In these instances, such as with Isaac, Moses, Samuel, and Job, the act of praying is a method of changing a situation for the better. The second way in which prayer is depicted is through fully fleshed out episodes of prayer, where a person's prayer is related in full. Many famous biblical personalities have such a prayer, including every major character from Hannah to Hezekiah.\nNew Testament.\nIn the New Testament, prayer is presented as a positive command. The People of God are challenged to include Christian prayer in their everyday life, even in the busy struggles of marriage as it brings people closer to God.\nJesus encouraged his disciples to pray in secret in their private rooms, using the Lord's Prayer, as a humble response to the prayer of the Pharisees, whose practices in prayer were regarded as impious by the New Testament writers.\nFor evangelists and other Christian sects, prayer is shown to be God's appointed method by which we obtain what He has to bestow. Further, the Book of James says that the lack of blessings in life results from a failure to pray. Jesus healed through prayer and expected his followers to do so also. The apostle Paul wrote to the churches of Thessalonica to \"Pray continually.\"\nJudaism.\nObservant Jews pray three times a day, Shacharit, Mincha, and Ma'ariv with lengthier prayers on special days, such as the Shabbat and Jewish holidays including Musaf and the reading of the Torah. The siddur is the prayerbook used by Jews all over the world, containing a set order of daily prayers. Jewish prayer is usually described as having two aspects: \"kavanah\" (intention) and \"keva\" (the ritualistic, structured elements).\nCommunal prayer is preferred over solitary prayer, and a quorum of ten adult males (a \"minyan\") is considered by Orthodox Judaism a prerequisite for several communal prayers. There are also many other ritualistic prayers a Jew performs during their day, such as washing before eating bread, washing after one wakes up in the morning, and doing grace after meals.\nRationalist approach.\nIn this view, the ultimate goal of prayer is to help train a person to focus on divinity through philosophy and intellectual contemplation. This approach was taken by Maimonides and the other medieval rationalists. One example of this approach to prayer is noted by Rabbi Steven Weil, who was appointed the Orthodox Union's Executive-Vice President in 2009. He notes that the word \"prayer\" is a derivative of the Latin \"precari\", which means \"to beg\". The Hebrew equivalent \"tefilah\", however, along with its root \"pelel\" or its reflexive \"l'hitpallel\", means the act of self-analysis or self-evaluation. This approach is sometimes described as the person praying having a dialogue or conversation with God.\nEducational approach.\nIn this view, prayer is not a conversation. Rather, it is meant to inculcate certain attitudes in the one who prays, but not to influence. This has been the approach of Rabbenu Bachya, Yehuda Halevy, Joseph Albo, Samson Raphael Hirsch, and Joseph Dov Soloveitchik. This view is expressed by Rabbi Nosson Scherman in the overview to the Artscroll Siddur (p.\u00a0XIII); note that Scherman goes on to also affirm the Kabbalistic view (see below).\nKabbalistic approach.\nKabbalah uses a series of \"kavanot\", directions of intent, to specify the path the prayer ascends in the dialog with God, to increase its chances of being answered favorably. Kabbalists ascribe a higher meaning to the purpose of prayer, which is no less than affecting the very fabric of reality itself, restructuring and repairing the universe in a real fashion. In this view, every word of every prayer, and indeed, even every letter of every word, has a precise meaning and a precise effect. Prayers thus literally affect the mystical forces of the universe, and repair the fabric of creation.\nChristianity.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nOur Father in heaven, hallowed be your name. Your kingdom come. Your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors. And do not bring us to the time of trial, but rescue us from the evil one.\n \u2014known as \"The Lord's Prayer\"\nChristian prayers are quite varied. They can be completely spontaneous, or read entirely from a text, like the Anglican Book of Common Prayer. The most common prayer among Christians is the Lord's Prayer, which according to the gospel accounts (e.g. ) is how Jesus taught his disciples to pray. The Lord's Prayer is a model for prayers of adoration, confession and petition in Christianity.\nIn the second century \"Apostolic Tradition\", Hippolytus instructed Christians to pray at seven fixed prayer times: \"on rising, at the lighting of the evening lamp, at bedtime, at midnight\" and \"the third, sixth and ninth hours of the day, being hours associated with Christ's Passion.\" Breviaries such as the Shehimo and Agpeya are used by Oriental Orthodox Christians to pray these seven canonical hours while facing in the eastward direction of prayer.\nIn medieval England, prayers (particularly the \"paternoster\") were frequently used as a measure of time in medical and culinary recipe books.\nChristians generally pray to God. Some Christians, such as Catholics, Lutherans, Orthodox, and Methodists pray for the dead; Roman Catholics, will also ask the righteous in heaven and \"in Christ,\" such as the Virgin Mary or other saints to intercede by praying on their behalf (intercession of saints). Formulaic closures in many Christian denominations, such as Lutheranism and Catholicism include \"through our Lord Jesus Christ, Your Son, who lives and reigns with You, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, through all the ages of ages,\" and \"in the name of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit.\"\nIt is customary among Christians to end prayers with \"In Jesus' name, Amen\" or more commonly, with the sign of the cross while saying the Trinitarian formula. The most commonly used closure of prayer in Christianity is \"Amen\" (from a Hebrew adverb used as a statement of affirmation or agreement, usually translated as \"so be it\").\nIn the Latin Church of the Catholic Church, probably the most common is the Rosary; in the Eastern Christianity (including the Eastern Catholic Churches of the Catholic Church and Eastern Orthodox Church), the Jesus Prayer. The Jesus Prayer is also often repeated as part of the meditative hesychasm practice in Eastern Christianity.\nLatin Catholic tradition includes specific prayers and devotions as acts of reparation which do not involve a petition for a living or deceased beneficiary, but aim to repair the sins of others, e.g. for the repair of the sin of blasphemy performed by others.\nChristians send prayer requests to the Church of Holy Sepulcher in Jerusalem, where Jesus Christ was crucified, laid to rest, and resurrected. It is significant because of groundbreaking miracles. Miracles witnessed by the faithful, agreed on by historians and archaeologists. The Bible records miracles tied to Jesus\u2019 crucifixion, burial, and resurrection at the site on which the Church of the Holy Sepulcher is built.\nPentecostalism.\nIn Pentecostal congregations, prayer is often accompanied by speaking in an unknown tongue, a practice now known as glossolalia. Practitioners of Pentecostal glossolalia may claim that the languages they speak in prayer are real foreign languages, and that the ability to speak those languages spontaneously is a gift of the Holy Spirit. Some people outside of the movement, however, have offered dissenting views. George Barton Cutten suggested that glossolalia was a sign of mental illness. Felicitas Goodman suggested that tongue speakers were under a form of hypnosis. Others suggest that it is a learned behaviour. Some of these views have allegedly been refuted.\nChristian Science.\nChristian Science teaches that prayer is a spiritualization of thought or an understanding of God and of the nature of the underlying spiritual creation. Adherents believe that this can result in healing, by bringing spiritual reality into clearer focus in the human scene. The world as it appears to the senses is regarded as a distorted version of the world of spiritual ideas. Prayer can heal the distortion. Christian Scientists believe that prayer does not change the spiritual creation but gives a clearer view of it, and the result appears in the human scene as healing: the human picture adjusts to coincide more nearly with the divine reality. Christian Scientists do not practice intercessory prayer as it is commonly understood, and they generally avoid combining prayer with medical treatment in the belief that the two practices tend to work against each other. Prayer works through love: the recognition of God's creation as spiritual, intact, and inherently lovable.\nIslam.\nThe Arabic word for prayer is \"salah\". The daily obligatory prayers collectively form the second of the five pillars in Islam, observed three or five times every day at prescribed times. The command of ritual prayer repeatedly occurs in the Quran. The person performs the prayer while they are facing the Kaaba in Mecca. There is the \"call for prayer\" (\"the adhan\"), where the \"muezzin\" calls for all the followers to stand together for the prayer. The prayer consists of actions such as glorifying and praising God (such as mentioning 'All\u0101hu Akbar' (God is Great)) while standing, recitation of chapters of the Quran (such as the opening chapter of the book (\"Al-Fatiha\")), bowing down then praising God, prostrating (\"sujud\") then again praising God. It ends with the words: \"Peace be with you and God's mercy.\" During the prayer, a Muslim cannot talk or do anything else besides pray. Once the prayer is complete, one can offer personal prayers or supplications to God for their needs, known as \"dua\". There are many standard invocations in Arabic to be recited at various times (\"e.g.\" after the prayer) and for various occasions (\"e.g.\" for one's parents) with manners and etiquette such as before eating. Muslims may also say \"dua\" in their own words and languages for any issue they wish to communicate with God in the hope that God will answer their prayers. Certain Shi'a sects pray the five daily prayers divided into three separate parts of the day, providing several Hadith as supporting evidence; although according to Shi'a Islam, it is also permissible to pray at five times.\nMandaeism.\nDaily prayer in Mandaeism called \"brakha\" consists of a set prayers that are recited three times per day. Mandaeans stand facing north while reciting daily prayers. Unlike in Islam and Coptic Orthodox Christianity, prostration is not practiced.\nMandaean priests recite rahma prayers three times every day, while laypeople also recite the \"Rushuma\" (signing prayer) and \"Asut Malkia\" (\"Healing of Kings\") daily.\nThe three prayer times in Mandaeism are:\nBah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith.\nBah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h, the B\u00e1b, and `Abdu'l-Bah\u00e1 wrote many prayers for general use, and some for specific occasions, including for unity, detachment, spiritual upliftment, and healing among others. Followers of the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith are also required to recite each day one of three obligatory prayers composed by Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h. The believers have been enjoined to face in the direction of the Qiblih when reciting their Obligatory Prayer. The longest obligatory prayer may be recited at any time during the day; another, of medium length, is recited once in the morning, once at midday, and once in the evening; and the shortest can be recited anytime between noon and sunset. Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds also read from and meditate on the scriptures every morning and evening.\nEastern religions.\nIn both Buddhism and Hinduism, the repetition of mantras is closely related to the practice of repetitive prayer in Western religion (rosary, Jesus prayer) but Buddhists do not pray to a higher deity. Many of the most widespread Hindu and Buddhist mantras are in origin invocations of deities, e.g. Gayatri Mantra dedicated to Savitr, Pavamana Mantra to Soma Pavamana, and many of the Buddhist Dh\u0101ra\u1e47\u012b originate as recitations of lists of names or attributes of deities. Most of the shorter Buddhist mantras originate as the invocation of the name of a specific deity or \"bodhisattva\", such as \"Om mani padme hum\" being in origin the invocation of a \"bodhisattva\" called \"Ma\u1e47ipadma\". However, from an early time these mantras were interpreted in the context of mystical sound symbolism. The most extreme example of this is the om syllable, which as early as in the Aitareya Brahmana was claimed as equivalent to the entire Vedas (collection of ritual hymns).\nBuddhism.\nIn the earliest Buddhist tradition, the Theravada, and in the later Mahayana tradition of Zen (or Ch\u00e1n), prayer plays only an ancillary role. It is largely a ritual expression of wishes for success in the practice and in helping all beings.\nThe skillful means (Sanskrit: \"up\u0101ya\") of the transfer of merit (Sanskrit: \"pari\u1e47\u0101man\u0101\") is an evocation and prayer. Moreover, indeterminate buddhas are available for intercession as they reside in awoken-fields (Pure Lands, Sanskrit: \"buddha-kshetra\").\nThe \"nirm\u0101nak\u0101ya\" of an awoken-field is what is generally known and understood as a mandala. The opening and closing of the ring (Sanskrit: \"ma\u1e47\u1e0dala\") is an active prayer. An active prayer is a mindful activity, an activity in which mindfulness is not just cultivated but \"is\". A common prayer is \"May the merit of my practice, adorn Buddhas' Pure Lands, requite the fourfold kindness from above, and relieve the suffering of the three life-journeys below. Universally wishing sentient beings, Friends, foes, and karmic creditors, all to activate the Bodhi mind, and all to be reborn in the Pure Land of Ultimate Bliss.\"\nThe Tibetan Buddhism tradition emphasizes an instructive and devotional relationship to a guru; this may involve devotional practices known as guru yoga which are congruent with prayer. It also appears that Tibetan Buddhism posits the existence of various deities, but the peak view of the tradition is that the deities or \"yidam\" are no more existent or real than the continuity (Sanskrit: \"santana\"; refer mindstream) of the practitioner, environment and activity. But how practitioners engage \"yidam\" or tutelary deities will depend upon the level or more appropriately \"yana\" at which they are practicing. At one level, one may pray to a deity for protection or assistance, taking a more subordinate role. At another level, one may invoke the deity, on a more equal footing. And at a higher level one may deliberately cultivate the idea that one has become the deity, whilst remaining aware that its ultimate nature is \"\u015b\u016bnyat\u0101\". The views of the more esoteric \"yana\" are impenetrable for those without direct experience and empowerment.\nPure Land Buddhism emphasizes the recitation by devotees of prayer-like mantras, a practice often called \"Nembutsu\". On one level it is said that reciting these mantras can ensure rebirth into a \"Sambhogak\u0101ya\" land (Sanskrit: \"buddha-kshetra\") after bodily dissolution, a sheer ball spontaneously co-emergent to a Buddha's enlightened intention. According to Shinran, the founder of the Pure Land Buddhism tradition that is most prevalent in the US, \"for the long haul nothing is as efficacious as the Nembutsu.\" On another, the practice is a form of meditation aimed at achieving realization.\nHinduism.\nHinduism has incorporated many kinds of prayer (Sanskrit: \"pr\u0101rthan\u0101\"), from fire-based rituals to philosophical musings. While chanting involves 'by dictum' recitation of timeless verses or verses with timings and notations, \"dhyanam\" involves deep meditation (however short or long) on the preferred deity/God. These prayers can be directed to fulfilling personal needs or liberation, and also for the benefit of others. Ritual invocation was part and parcel of the Vedic religion and as such permeated their sacred texts. Indeed, the highest sacred texts of the Hindus, the Vedas, are a large collection of mantras and prayer rituals. Hindus in India have numerous devotional movements. Again, the object to which prayers are offered varies: it could be a persons referred as \"devatas\", trinity or incarnation of either \"devtas\" or trinity or simply plain formless meditation as practiced by the ancient sages. Hindus may pray to the highest absolute God Brahman, or more commonly to its three manifestations, a creator god called Brahma, a preserver god called Vishnu and a destroyer god (so that the creation cycle can start afresh) Shiva, and at the next level to Vishnu's avatars (earthly appearances) Rama and Krishna or to many other male or female deities. Typically, Hindus pray with their hands (the palms) joined in \"pranam\".\nSikhism.\nThe \"Ard\u0101s\" (Punjabi: \u0a05\u0a30\u0a26\u0a3e\u0a38) is a Sikh prayer that is done before performing or after undertaking any significant task; after reciting the daily \"Banis\" (prayers); or completion of a service like the \"Paath\" (scripture reading/recitation), \"kirtan\" (hymn-singing) program or any other religious program. In Sikhism, these prayers are also said before and after eating. The prayer is a plea to God to support and help the devotee with whatever he or she is about to undertake or has done.\nThe \"Ardas\" is usually always done standing up with folded hands. The beginning of the \"Ardas\" is strictly set by the tenth Sikh Guru, Guru Gobind Singh. When it comes to conclusion of this prayer, the devotee uses words like \"Waheguru please bless me in the task that I am about to undertake\" when starting a new task or \"Akal Purakh, having completed the hymn-singing, we ask for your continued blessings so that we can continue with your memory and remember you at all times\", etc. The word \"Ard\u0101s\" is derived from Persian word 'Arazdashat', meaning a request, supplication, prayer, petition or an address to a superior authority.\nArd\u0101s is a unique prayer based on the fact that it is one of the few well-known prayers in the Sikh religion that was not written in its entirety by the Gurus. The Ard\u0101s cannot be found within the pages of the Guru Granth Sahib because it is a continually changing devotional text that has evolved over time in order for it to encompass the feats, accomplishments, and feelings of all generations of Sikhs within its lines. Taking the various derivation of the word Ard\u0101s into account, the basic purpose of this prayer is an appeal to Waheguru for his protection and care, as well as being a plea for the welfare and prosperity of all mankind, and a means for the Sikhs to thank Waheguru for all that he has done.\nZoroastrianism.\nZoroastrians believe that the elements are pure and that fire represents God's light or wisdom. Zoroastrian worship practices have evolved from ancient times to the present day. Over time, Zoroastrians developed the concept of worshipping in temples, sometimes called fire temples.\nNew religious movements.\nWiccan prayers can include meditation, rituals and incantations. Wiccans see prayers as a form of communication with the God and Goddess. Such communication may include prayers for \"esbat\" and \"sabbat\" celebrations, for dinner, for pre-dawn times or for one's own or others' safety, for healing or for the dead.\nIn Ra\u00eblism rites and practises vary from initiation ceremonies to sensual meditation. An initiation ceremony usually involves a Raelian putting water on the forehead of a new member. Such ceremonies take place on certain special days on the Raelian calendar. Sensual meditation techniques include breathing exercises and various forms of erotic meditation.\nIn Eckankar, one of the basic forms of prayer includes singing the word \"HU\" (pronounced as \"hue\"), a holy name of God. ECKists may do this with eyes closed or open, aloud or silently. Practitioners may experience the divine ECK or Holy Spirit.\nPractitioners of theurgy and Western esotericism may practice a form of ritual which uses both pre-sanctioned prayers and names of God, and prayers \"from the heart\" that, when combined, allow the participant to ascend spiritually, and in some instances, induce a trance in which God or other spiritual beings may be realized. Very much as in Hermetic Qabalah and orthodox Kabbalah, it is believed that prayer can influence both the physical and non-physical worlds.\nIn Thelema (which includes both theist as well as atheist practitioners) adherents share a number of practices that are forms of individual prayer, including basic yoga; (asana and pranayama); various forms of ritual magick; rituals of one's own devising (often based upon a syncretism of religions, or Western Esotericism, such as the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram and Star Ruby); and performance of Liber Resh vel Helios (aka Liber 200), which consists of four daily adorations to the sun (often consisting of four hand/body positions and recitation of a memorized song, normally spoken, addressing different forms of God identified with the sun).\nWhile no dogma within Thelema expresses the purpose behind any individual aspirant who chooses to perform \"Resh\", note that the practice of \"Resh\" is not a simple petition toward the sun, nor a form of \"worshiping\" the celestial body that we call the Sun, but instead uses the positioning of that source of light, which enables life on our planet, as well as using mythological images of that solar force, so that the individual can perform the prayer, possibly furthering a self-identification with the sun, so \"that repeated application of the Liber Resh adorations expands the consciousness of the individual by compelling him to take a different perspective, by inducing him to 'look at things from the point of view of the Sun' [...]\".\nPrayer healing.\nPrayer is often used as a means of faith healing in an attempt to use religious or spiritual means to prevent illness, cure disease, or improve health.\nScientific studies regarding the use of prayer have mostly concentrated on its effect on the healing of sick or injured people. Meta-studies have been performed showing evidence only for no effect or a potentially small effect. For instance, a 2006 meta analysis on 14 studies concluded that there is \"no discernable effect\" while a 2007 systemic review of studies on intercessory prayer reported inconclusive results, noting that seven of 17 studies had \"small, but significant, effect sizes\" but the review noted that the most methodologically rigorous studies failed to produce significant findings. Some studies have indicated increased medical complications in groups receiving prayer over those without.\nThe efficacy of petition in prayer for physical healing to a deity has been evaluated in numerous other studies, with contradictory results. There has been some criticism of the way the studies were conducted.\nSome attempt to heal by prayer, mental practices, spiritual insights, or other techniques, claiming they can summon divine or supernatural intervention on behalf of the ill. Others advocate that ill people may achieve healing through prayer performed by themselves. According to the varied beliefs of those who practice it, faith healing may be said to afford gradual relief from pain or sickness or to bring about a sudden \"miracle cure\", and it may be used in place of, or in tandem with, conventional medical techniques for alleviating or curing diseases. Faith healing has been criticized on the grounds that those who use it may delay seeking potentially curative conventional medical care. This is particularly problematic when parents use faith healing techniques on children.\nEfficacy of prayer healing.\nIn 1872, Francis Galton conducted a famous statistical experiment to determine whether prayer had a physical effect on the external environment. Galton hypothesized that if prayer was effective, members of the British Royal family would live longer, given that thousands prayed for their wellbeing every Sunday. He therefore compared longevity in the British Royal family with that of the general population, and found no difference. While the experiment was probably intended to satirize, and suffered from a number of confounders, it set the precedent for a number of different studies, the results of which are contradictory.\nTwo studies claimed that patients who are being prayed for recover more quickly or more frequently although critics have claimed that the methodology of such studies are flawed, and the perceived effect disappears when controls are tightened. One such study, with a double-blind design and about 500 subjects per group, was published in 1988; it suggested that intercessory prayer by born again Christians had a statistically significant positive effect on a coronary care unit population. Critics contend that there were severe methodological problems with this study. Another such study was reported by Harris et al. Critics also claim that the 1988 study was not fully double-blinded, and that in the Harris study, patients actually had a longer hospital stay in the prayer group, if one discounts the patients in both groups who left before prayers began, although the Harris study did demonstrate the prayed for patients on average received lower course scores (indicating better recovery).\nOne of the largest randomized, blind clinical trials was a remote \"retroactive\" intercessory prayer study conducted in Israel by Leibovici. This study used 3393 patient records from 1990 to 1996, and blindly assigned some of these to an intercessory prayer group. The prayer group had shorter hospital stays and duration of fever.\nSeveral studies of prayer effectiveness have yielded null results. A 2001 double-blind study of the Mayo Clinic found no significant difference in the recovery rates between people who were (unbeknownst to them) assigned to a group that prayed for them and those who were not. Similarly, the MANTRA study conducted by Duke University found no differences in outcome of cardiac procedures as a result of prayer. In another similar study published in the \"American Heart Journal\" in 2006, Christian intercessory prayer when reading a scripted prayer was found to have no effect on the recovery of heart surgery patients; however, the study found patients who had knowledge of receiving prayer had slightly higher instances of complications than those who did not know if they were being prayed for or those who did not receive prayer. Another 2006 study suggested that prayer actually had a significant negative effect on the recovery of cardiac bypass patients, resulting in more frequent deaths and slower recovery time for those patient who received prayers.\nMany believe that prayer can aid in recovery, not due to divine influence but due to psychological and physical benefits. It has also been suggested that if a person knows that he or she is being prayed for it can be uplifting and increase morale, thus aiding recovery. (See Subject-expectancy effect.) Many studies have suggested that prayer can reduce physical stress, regardless of the god or gods a person prays to, and this may be true for many worldly reasons. According to a study by Centra State Hospital, \"the psychological benefits of prayer may help reduce stress and anxiety, promote a more positive outlook, and strengthen the will to live.\"\nOthers feel that the concept of conducting prayer experiments reflects a misunderstanding of the purpose of prayer. The previously mentioned study published in the \"American Heart Journal\" indicated that some of the intercessors who took part in it complained about the scripted nature of the prayers that were imposed to them, saying that this is not the way they usually conduct prayer: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Prior to the start of this study, intercessors reported that they usually receive information about the patient's age, gender and progress reports on their medical condition; converse with family members or the patient (not by fax from a third party); use individualized prayers of their own choosing; and pray for a variable time period based on patient or family request.\nOne scientific movement attempts to track the physical effects of prayer through neuroscience. Leaders in this movement include Andrew Newberg, an associate professor at the University of Pennsylvania. In Newberg's brain scans, monks, priests, nuns, sisters and gurus alike have exceptionally focused attention and compassion sites. This is a result of the frontal lobe of the brain's engagement (Newberg, 2009). Newburg believes that anybody can connect to the supernatural with practice. Those without religious affiliations benefit from the connection to the metaphysical as well. Newberg also states that further evidence towards humans' need for metaphysical relationships is that as science had increased spirituality has not decreased. Newburg believes that at the end of the 18th century, when the scientific method began to consume the human mind, religion could have vanished. However, two hundred years later, the perception of spirituality, in many instances, appears to be gaining in strength (2009). Newberg's research also provides the connection between prayer and meditation and health. By understanding how the brain works during religious experiences and practices Newberg's research shows that the brain changes during these practices allowing an understanding of how religion affects psychological and physical health (2009). For example, brain activity during meditation indicates that people who frequently practice prayer or meditation experience lower blood-pressure, lower heart rates, decreased anxiety, and decreased depression.\nAnother paradigm of research returns to the Princeton Engineering Anomalies Research (1979-2007) which has provided an explanatory model for mind-matter interactions. Jahn and his colleagues explain the local and nonlocal effects of consciousness by an explanation of the normal pathways, through those intentions life prayer, can change the praying person's emotion and behavior, and anomalous pathways which can affect another one through the unconscious-implicit order trajectory via quantum nonlocality mechanism.\nPrevalence of prayer for health.\nSome modalities of alternative medicine employ prayer. A survey released in May 2004 by the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, part of the National Institutes of Health in the United States, found that in 2002, 43% of Americans pray for their own health, 24% pray for others' health, and 10% participate in a prayer group for their own health.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is one of the most widely spoken native languages in the world, with approximately 150 million native speakers.\nPunjabi is the most widely-spoken first language in Pakistan, with 88.9 million native speakers according to the 2023 Pakistani census, and the 11th most widely-spoken in India, with 31.1 million native speakers, according to the 2011 census. It is spoken among a significant overseas diaspora, particularly in Canada, the United Kingdom, the United States, Australia, and the Gulf states.\nIn Pakistan, Punjabi is written using the Shahmukhi alphabet, based on the Perso-Arabic script; in India, it is written using the Gurmukhi alphabet, based on the Indic scripts. Punjabi is unusual among the Indo-Aryan languages and the broader Indo-European language family in its usage of lexical tone.\nHistory.\nEtymology.\nThe word \"Punjabi\" (sometimes spelled \"Panjabi\") has been derived from the word \"Panj-\u0101b\", Persian for 'Five Waters', referring to the five major eastern tributaries of the Indus River. The name of the region was introduced by the Turko-Persian conquerors of South Asia and was a translation of the Sanskrit name, \"Panchanada\", which means 'Land of the Five Rivers'.\n\"Panj\" is cognate with Sanskrit \"\" (), Greek \"p\u00e9nte\" (), and Lithuanian \"Penki\", all of which meaning 'five'; \"\u0101b\" is cognate with Sanskrit \"\u00e1p\" () and with the of . The historical Punjab region, now divided between India and Pakistan, is defined physiographically by the Indus River and these five tributaries. One of the five, the Beas River, is a tributary of another, the Sutlej.\nOrigin.\nPunjabi developed from Prakrit languages and later (, 'deviated' or 'non-grammatical speech') From 600\u00a0BC, Sanskrit developed as the standard literary and administrative language and Prakrit languages evolved into many regional languages in different parts of India. All these languages are called Prakrit languages (Sanskrit: ) collectively. Paishachi Prakrit was one of these Prakrit languages, which was spoken in north and north-western India and Punjabi developed from this Prakrit. Later in northern India Paishachi Prakrit gave rise to Paishachi Apabhra\u1e43\u015ba, a descendant of Prakrit. Punjabi emerged as an Apabhramsha, a degenerated form of Prakrit, in the 7th century AD and became stable by the 10th century. The earliest writings in Punjabi belong to the Nath Yogi-era from 9th to 14th century. The language of these compositions is morphologically closer to Shauraseni Apbhramsa, though vocabulary and rhythm is surcharged with extreme colloquialism and folklore. Writing in 1317\u20131318, Amir Khusrau referred to the language spoken by locals around the area of Lahore as \"Lahauri\". The precursor stage of Punjabi between the 10th and 16th centuries is termed 'Old Punjabi', whilst the stage between the 16th and 19th centuries is termed as 'Medieval Punjabi'.\nArabic and Persian influences.\nThe Arabic and Modern Persian influence in the historical Punjab region began with the late first millennium Muslim conquests in the Indian subcontinent. Since then, many Persian words have been incorporated into Punjabi (such as \"zam\u012bn\", \"\u015bahir\" etc.) and are used with a liberal approach. Through Persian, Punjabi also absorbed many Arabic-derived words like \"duk\u0101n\", \"\u0121azal\" and more, as well as Turkic words like \"q\u0113nc\u012b\", \"s\u014d\u0121\u0101t\", etc. After the fall of the Sikh empire, Urdu was made the official language of Punjab under the British (in Pakistani Punjab, it is still the primary official language) and influenced the language as well.\nIn the second millennium, Punjabi was lexically influenced by Portuguese (words like \"alm\u0101r\u012b\"), Greek (words like \"d\u0101m\"), Japanese (words like \"rik\u015b\u0101\"), Chinese (words like \"c\u0101h\", \"l\u012bc\u012b\", \"luk\u0101\u1e6dh\") and English (words like \"jajj\", \"ap\u012bl\", \"m\u0101s\u1e6dar\"), though these influences have been minor in comparison to Persian and Arabic. In fact, the sounds // (\u0a1c\u0a3c / ), // (\u0a17\u0a3c / ), // (\u0a15\u0a3c / ), // (\u0a38\u0a3c / ), // (\u0a16\u0a3c / ) and // (\u0a2b\u0a3c / ) are all borrowed from Persian, but in some instances the latter three arise natively. Later, the letters \u0a1c\u0a3c / , \u0a38\u0a3c / and \u0a2b\u0a3c / began being used in English borrowings, with \u0a38\u0a3c / also used in Sanskrit borrowings.\nPunjabi has also had minor influence from and on neighbouring languages such as Sindhi, Haryanvi, Pashto and Hindustani.\nModern times.\nModern Punjabi emerged in the 19th century from the Medieval Punjabi stage. Modern Punjabi has two main varieties, Western Punjabi and Eastern Punjabi, which have many dialects and forms, altogether spoken by over 150 million people. The Majhi dialect, which is transitional between the two main varieties, has been adopted as standard Punjabi in India and Pakistan for education and mass media. The Majhi dialect originated in the Majha region of the Punjab.\nIn India, Punjabi is written in the Gurmukh\u012b script in offices, schools, and media. Gurmukhi is the official standard script for Punjabi, though it is often unofficially written in the Latin scripts due to influence from English, one of India's two primary official languages at the Union-level.\nIn Pakistan, Punjabi is generally written using the Shahmukh\u012b script, which in literary standards, is identical to the Urdu alphabet, however various attempts have been made to create certain, distinct characters from a modification of the Persian Nasta\u02bfl\u012bq characters to represent Punjabi phonology, not already found in the Urdu alphabet. In Pakistan, Punjabi loans technical words from Persian and Arabic, just like Urdu does.\nGeographic distribution.\nPunjabi is the most widely spoken language in Pakistan, the eleventh-most widely spoken in India, and also present in the Punjabi diaspora in various countries.&lt;templatestyles src=\"Pie chart/styles.css\"/&gt;\nPakistan.\nPunjabi is the most widely spoken language in Pakistan, being the native language of 88.9 million people, or approximately 37% of the country's population.\nBeginning with the 1981 and 2017 censuses respectively, speakers of the Western Punjabi's Saraiki and Hindko varieties were no longer included in the total numbers for Punjabi, which explains the apparent decrease. Pothwari speakers however are included in the total numbers for Punjabi.\nIndia.\nPunjabi is the official language of the Indian state of Punjab, and has the status of an additional official language in Haryana and Delhi. Some of its major urban centres in northern India are Amritsar, Ludhiana, Chandigarh, Jalandhar, Ambala, Patiala, Bathinda, Hoshiarpur, Firozpur and Delhi.\nIn the 2011 census of India, million reported their language as Punjabi. The census publications group this with speakers of related \"mother tongues\" like Bagri and Bhateali to arrive at the figure of million.\nPunjabi diaspora.\nPunjabi is also spoken as a minority language in several other countries where Punjabi people have emigrated in large numbers, such as the United States, Australia, the United Kingdom, and Canada.\nThere were 670,000 native Punjabi speakers in Canada in 2021, 300,000 in the United Kingdom in 2011, 280,000 in the United States and smaller numbers in other countries.\nMajor dialects.\nStandard Punjabi.\n\"Standard Punjabi\" (sometimes referred to as Majhi) is the standard form of Punjabi used commonly in education and news broadcasting, and is based on the Majhi dialect. Such as the variety used on Google Translate, Standard Punjabi is also often used in official online services that employ Punjabi. It is widely used in the TV and entertainment industry of Pakistan, which is mainly produced in Lahore.\nThe Standard Punjabi used in India and Pakistan has slight differences. In India, it excludes many of the dialect-specific features of Majhi. In Pakistan, the standard is closer to the Majhi spoken in the urban parts of Lahore.\nEastern Punjabi.\n\"Eastern Punjabi\" refers to the varieties of Punjabi spoken in Pakistani Punjab (specifically Northern Punjabi), most of Indian Punjab, the far-north of Rajasthan and on the northwestern border of Haryana. It includes the dialects of Majhi, Malwai, Doabi, Puadhi and the extinct Lubanki.\nSometimes, Dogri and Kangri are grouped into this category.\nWestern Punjabi.\n\"Western Punjabi\" or \"Lahnda\" (, lit.\u2009'western') is the name given to the diverse group of Punjabi varieties spoken in the majority of Pakistani Punjab, the Hazara region, most of Azad Kashmir and small parts of Indian Punjab such as Fazilka. These include groups of dialects like Saraiki, Pahari-Pothwari, Hindko and the extinct Inku; common dialects like Jhangvi, Shahpuri, Dhanni and Thali which are usually grouped under the term Jatki Punjabi; and the mixed variety of Punjabi and Sindhi called Khetrani.\nDepending on context, the terms Eastern and Western Punjabi can simply refer to all the Punjabi varieties spoken in India and Pakistan respectively, whether or not they are linguistically Eastern/Western.\nPhonology.\nWhile a vowel length distinction between short and long vowels exists, reflected in modern Gurmukhi orthographical conventions, it is secondary to the vowel quality contrast between centralised vowels and peripheral vowels in terms of phonetic significance.\nThe peripheral vowels have nasal analogues. There is a tendency with speakers to insert /\u026a\u032f/ between adjacent \"a\"-vowels as a separator. This usually changes to /\u028a\u032f/ if either vowel is nasalised.\nNote: for the tonal stops, refer to the next section about Tone.\nThe three retroflex consonants do not occur initially, and the nasals most commonly occur as allophones of in clusters with velars and palatals (there are few exceptions). The well-established phoneme may be realised allophonically as the voiceless retroflex fricative in learned clusters with retroflexes. Due to its foreign origin, it is often also realised as , in e.g. \"shalw\u0101r\" . The phonemic status of the consonants varies with familiarity with Hindustani norms, more so with the Gurmukhi script, with the pairs , , , , and systematically distinguished in educated speech, /q/ being the most rarely pronounced. The retroflex lateral is most commonly analysed as an approximant as opposed to a flap. Some speakers soften the voiceless aspirates /t\u0361\u0283\u02b0, p\u02b0, k\u02b0/ into fricatives /\u0255, f, x/ respectively.\nIn rare cases, the /\u0272/ and /\u014b/ phonemes in Shahmukhi may be represented with letters from Sindhi. The /\u0272/ phoneme, which is more common than /\u014b/, is written as or depending on its phonetic preservation, e.g. /\u0272a\u02d0\u0273a\u02d0/ (preserved \"\u00f1\") as opposed to /ki\u0272d\u0361\u0292/ (assimilated into \"nj\"). /\u014b/ is always written as .\nDiphthongs.\nLike Hindustani, the diphthongs /\u0259\u026a/ and /\u0259\u028a/ have mostly disappeared, but are still retained in some dialects.\nPhonotactically, long vowels /a\u02d0, i\u02d0, u\u02d0/ are treated as doubles of their short vowel counterparts /\u0259, \u026a, \u028a/ rather than separate phonemes. Hence, diphthongs like \"ai\" and \"au\" get monophthongised into /e\u02d0/ and /o\u02d0/, and \"\u0101i\" and \"\u0101u\" into /\u025b\u02d0/ and /\u0254\u02d0/ respectively.\nThe phoneme /j/ is very fluid in Punjabi. /j/ is only truly pronounced word-initially (even then it often becomes /d\u0361\u0292/), where it is otherwise /\u026a/ or /i/.\nTone.\nUnusually for an Indo-Aryan language, Punjabi distinguishes lexical tones. Three tones are distinguished in Punjabi (some sources have described these as tone contours, given in parentheses): low (high-falling), high (low-rising), and level (neutral or middle). The transcriptions and tone annotations in the examples below are based on those provided in Punjabi University, Patiala's \"Punjabi-English Dictionary\".\nLevel tone is found in about 75% of words and is described by some as absence of tone. There are also some words which are said to have rising tone in the first syllable and falling in the second. (Some writers describe this as a fourth tone.) However, a recent acoustic study of six Punjabi speakers in the United States found no evidence of a separate falling tone following a medial consonant.\nIt is considered that these tones arose when voiced aspirated consonants () lost their aspiration.\nMechanics.\nIn Punjabi, tone is induced by the loss of [h] in tonal consonants. Tonal consonants are any voiced aspirates /\u02b1/ and the voiced glottal fricative /\u0266/. These include the five voiced aspirated plosives \"bh\", \"dh\", \"\u1e0dh\", \"jh\" and \"gh\" (which are represented by their own letters in Gurmukhi), the \"h\" consonant itself and any voiced consonants appended with [h] (Gurmukhi:\u0a4d\u0a39 \"per\u012b\u0303 h\u0101h\u0101\", Shahmukhi: \u06be \"d\u014d-ca\u015bm\u012b h\u0113\"); usually \"\u1e5bh\", \"mh\", \"nh\", \"rh\" and \"lh\".\nThe five tonal plosives also become voiceless word-initially. E.g. \"ghar\" &gt; \"k\u00e0r\" \"house\", \"\u1e0dh\u014dl\" &gt; \"\u1e6d\u1e51l\" \"drum\" etc.\nTonogenesis in Punjabi forfeits the sound of [h] for tone. Thus, the more [h] is realised, the less \"tonal\" a word will be pronounced, and vice versa. Tone is often reduced or rarely deleted when words are said with emphasis or on their own as a form of more exact identification.\nSequences with the consonant \"h\" have some additional gimmicks:\nThe consonant \"h\" on its own is now silent or very weakly pronounced except word-initially. However, certain dialects which exert stronger tone, particularly more northern Punjabi varieties and Dogri, pronounce \"h\" as very faint (thus tonal) in all cases. E.g. \"hatth\" &gt; \"\u00e0tth\".\nThe Jhangvi and Shahpuri dialects of Punjabi (as they transition into Saraiki) show comparatively less realisation of tone than other Punjabi varieties, and do not induce the devoicing of the main five tonal consonants (\"bh\", \"dh\", \"\u1e0dh\", \"jh\", \"gh\").\nThe Gurmukhi script which was developed in the 16th century has separate letters for voiced aspirated sounds, so it is thought that the change in pronunciation of the consonants and development of tones may have taken place since that time.\nSome other languages in Pakistan have also been found to have tonal distinctions, including Burushaski, Gujari, Hindko, Kalami, Shina, and Torwali, though these (besides Hindko) seem to be independent of Punjabi.\nGemination.\nGemination of a consonant (doubling the letter) is indicated with \"adhak\" in Gurmukhi and \"tashd\u012bd\" in Shahmukhi. Its inscription with a unique diacritic is a distinct feature of Gurmukhi compared to Brahmic scripts.\nAll consonants except six (\"\u1e47\", \"\u1e5b\", \"h\", \"r\", \"v\", \"y\") are regularly geminated. The latter four are only geminated in loan words from other languages.\nThere is a tendency to irregularly geminate consonants which follow long vowels, except in the final syllable of a word, e.g.\"men\u016b\u0303\" &gt; \"menn\u016b\u0303\". It also causes the long vowels to shorten but remain peripheral, distinguishing them from the central vowels /\u0259, \u026a, \u028a/. This gemination is less prominent than the literarily regular gemination represented by the diacritics mentioned above.\nBefore a non-final prenasalised consonant, long vowels undergo the same change but no gemination occurs.\nThe true gemination of a consonant after a long vowel is unheard of but is written in some English loanwords to indicate short /\u025b/ and /\u0254/, e.g. \u0a21\u0a48\u0a71\u0a21 /\u0256\u025b\u0256\u02d0/ \"dead\".\nGrammar.\nPunjabi has a canonical word order of SOV (subject\u2013object\u2013verb). Function words are largely postpositions marking grammatical case on a preceding nominal.\nPunjabi distinguishes two genders, two numbers, and six cases, direct, oblique, vocative, ablative, locative, and instrumental. The ablative occurs only in the singular, in free variation with oblique case plus ablative postposition, and the locative and instrumental are usually confined to set adverbial expressions.\nAdjectives, when declinable, are marked for the gender, number, and case of the nouns they qualify. There is also a T-V distinction.\nUpon the inflectional case is built a system of particles known as postpositions, which parallel English's prepositions. It is their use with a noun or verb that is what necessitates the noun or verb taking the oblique case, and it is with them that the locus of grammatical function or \"case-marking\" then lies. \nThe Punjabi verbal system is largely structured around a combination of aspect and tense/mood. Like the nominal system, the Punjabi verb takes a single inflectional suffix, and is often followed by successive layers of elements like auxiliary verbs and postpositions to the right of the lexical base.\nVocabulary.\nBeing an Indo-Aryan language, the core vocabulary of Punjabi consists of tadbhav words inherited from Sanskrit. It contains many loanwords from Persian and Arabic.\nWriting systems.\nThe Punjabi language is written in multiple scripts (a phenomenon known as synchronic digraphia). Each of the major scripts currently in use is typically associated with a particular religious group, although the association is not absolute or exclusive.\nIn India, Punjabi Sikhs use Gurmukhi, a script of the Brahmic family, which has official status in the state of Punjab. In Pakistan, Punjabi Muslims use Shahmukhi, a variant of the Perso-Arabic script and closely related to the Urdu alphabet. Sometimes Punjabi is recorded in the Devanagari script in India, albeit rarely. The Punjabi Hindus in India had a preference for Devanagari, another Brahmic script also used for Hindi, and in the first decades since independence raised objections to the uniform adoption of Gurmukhi in the state of Punjab, but most have now switched to Gurmukhi and so the use of Devanagari is rare. Often in literature, Pakistani Punjabi (written in Shahmukhi) is referred as Western-Punjabi (or West-Punjabi) and Indian Punjabi (written in Gurmukhi) is referred as Eastern-Punjabi (or East-Punjabi), although the underlying language is the same with a very slight shift in vocabulary towards Islamic and Sikh words respectively.\nThe written standard for Shahmukhi also slightly differs from that of Gurmukhi, as it is used for western dialects, whereas Gurumukhi is used to write eastern dialects.\nHistorically, various local Brahmic scripts including La\u1e47\u1e0d\u0101 and its descendants were also in use.\nThe Punjabi Braille is used by the visually impaired. There is an altered version of IAST often used for Punjabi in which the diphthongs \"ai\" and \"au\" are written as \"e\" and \"o\", and the long vowels \"e\" and \"o\" are written as \"\u0113\" and \"\u014d\".\nSample text.\nThis sample text was adapted from the Punjabi Wikipedia article on Lahore.\nGurmukhi\nShahmukhi\nTransliteration\nIPA\nTranslation\nLahore is the capital city of Pakistani Punjab. After Karachi, Lahore is the second largest city. Lahore is Pakistan's political, cultural, and educational hub, and so it is also said to be the heart of Pakistan. Lahore lies on the bank of the Ravi River. Its population is close to ten million people.\nLiterature development.\nMedieval period.\nThe \"Janamsakhis\", stories on the life and legend of Guru Nanak (1469\u20131539), are early examples of Punjabi prose literature.\nModern period.\nThe Victorian novel, Elizabethan drama, free verse and Modernism entered Punjabi literature through the introduction of British education during the Raj. Nanak Singh (1897\u20131971), Vir Singh, Ishwar Nanda, Amrita Pritam (1919\u20132005), Puran Singh (1881\u20131931), Dhani Ram Chatrik (1876\u20131957), Diwan Singh (1897\u20131944) and Ustad Daman (1911\u20131984), Mohan Singh (1905\u201378) and Shareef Kunjahi are some legendary Punjabi writers of this period.\nAfter independence of Pakistan and India Najm Hossein Syed, Fakhar Zaman and Afzal Ahsan Randhawa, Shafqat Tanvir Mirza, Ahmad Salim, and Najm Hosain Syed, Munir Niazi, Ali Arshad Mir, Pir Hadi Abdul Mannan enriched Punjabi literature in Pakistan, whereas Jaswant Singh Kanwal (1919\u20132020), Amrita Pritam (1919\u20132005), Jaswant Singh Rahi (1930\u20131996), Shiv Kumar Batalvi (1936\u20131973), Surjit Patar (1944\u2013) and Pash (1950\u20131988) are some of the more prominent poets and writers from India.\nStatus.\nDespite Punjabi's rich literary history, it was not until 1947 that it would be recognised as an official language. Previous governments in the area of the Punjab had favoured Persian, Hindustani, or even earlier standardized versions of local registers as the language of the court or government. After the annexation of the Sikh Empire by the British East India Company following the Second Anglo-Sikh War in 1849, the British policy of establishing a uniform language for administration was expanded into the Punjab. The British Empire employed Urdu in its administration of North-Central and Northwestern India, while in the North-East of India, Bengali language was used as the language of administration. Despite its lack of official sanction, the Punjabi language continued to flourish as an instrument of cultural production, with rich literary traditions continuing until modern times. The Sikh religion, with its Gurmukhi script, played a special role in standardising and providing education in the language via gurdwaras, while writers of all religions continued to produce poetry, prose, and literature in the language.\nIn India, Punjabi is one of the 22 scheduled languages of India. It is the first official language of the Indian State of Punjab. Punjabi also has second language official status in Delhi along with Urdu, and in Haryana.\nIn Pakistan, no regional ethnic language has been granted official status at the national level, and as such Punjabi is not an official language at the national level, even though it is the most spoken language in Pakistan. It is widely spoken in Punjab, Pakistan, the second largest and the most populous province of Pakistan, as well as in Islamabad Capital Territory. The only two official languages in Pakistan are Urdu and English.\nIn Pakistan.\nWhen Pakistan was created in 1947, despite Punjabi being the majority language in West Pakistan and Bengali the majority in East Pakistan and Pakistan as whole, English and Urdu were chosen as the official languages. The selection of Urdu was due to its association with South Asian Muslim nationalism and because the leaders of the new nation wanted a unifying national language instead of promoting one ethnic group's language over another, due to this the Punjabi elites started identifying with Urdu more than Punjabi because they saw it as a unifying force on an ethnoreligious perspective. Broadcasting in Punjabi language by Pakistan Broadcasting Corporation decreased on TV and radio after 1947. Article 251 of the Constitution of Pakistan declares that these two languages would be the only official languages at the national level, while provincial governments would be allowed to make provisions for the use of other languages. However, in the 1950s the constitution was amended to include the Bengali language.\nPunjabi is not a language of instruction for primary or secondary school students in Punjab Province (unlike Sindhi and Pashto in other provinces). Pupils in secondary schools can choose the language as an elective, while Punjabi instruction or study remains rare in higher education. One notable example is the teaching of Punjabi language and literature by the University of the Punjab in Lahore which began in 1970 with the establishment of its Punjabi Department.\nIn the cultural sphere, there are many books, plays, and songs being written or produced in the Punjabi-language in Pakistan. Until the 1970s, there were a large number of Punjabi-language films being produced by the Lollywood film industry, however since then Urdu has become a much more dominant language in film production. Additionally, television channels in Punjab Province (centred on the Lahore area) are broadcast in Urdu. The preeminence of Urdu in both broadcasting and the Lollywood film industry is seen by critics as being detrimental to the health of the language.\nThe use of Urdu and English as the near-exclusive languages of broadcasting, the public sector, and formal education have led some to fear that Punjabi in Pakistan is being relegated to a low-status language and that it is being denied an environment where it can flourish. Several prominent educational leaders, researchers, and social commentators have echoed the opinion that the intentional promotion of Urdu and the continued denial of any official sanction or recognition of the Punjabi language amounts to a process of \"Urdu-isation\" that is detrimental to the health of the Punjabi language In August 2015, the Pakistan Academy of Letters, International Writer's Council (IWC) and World Punjabi Congress (WPC) organised the \"Khawaja Farid Conference\" and demanded that a Punjabi-language university should be established in Lahore and that Punjabi language should be declared as the medium of instruction at the primary level. In September 2015, a case was filed in Supreme Court of Pakistan against Government of Punjab, Pakistan as it did not take any step to implement the Punjabi language in the province. Additionally, several thousand Punjabis gather in Lahore every year on International Mother Language Day. Thinktanks, political organisations, cultural projects, and individuals also demand authorities at the national and provincial level to promote the use of the language in the public and official spheres.\nIn India.\nAt the federal level, Punjabi has official status via the Eighth Schedule to the Indian Constitution, earned after the Punjabi Suba movement of the 1950s. At the state level, Punjabi is the sole official language of the state of Punjab, while it has secondary official status in the states of Haryana and Delhi. In 2012, it was also made additional official language of West Bengal in areas where the population exceeds 10% of a particular block, sub-division or district.\nBoth union and state laws specify the use of Punjabi in the field of education. The state of Punjab uses the Three Language Formula, and Punjabi is required to be either the medium of instruction, or one of the three languages learnt in all schools in Punjab. Punjabi is also a compulsory language in Haryana, and other states with a significant Punjabi speaking minority are required to offer Punjabi medium education.\nThere are vibrant Punjabi language movie and news industries in India, however Punjabi serials have had a much smaller presence within the last few decades in television up to 2015 due to market forces. Despite Punjabi having far greater official recognition in India, where the Punjabi language is officially admitted in all necessary social functions, while in Pakistan it is used only in a few radio and TV programs, attitudes of the English-educated elite towards the language are ambivalent as they are in neighbouring Pakistan. There are also claims of state apathy towards the language in non-Punjabi majority areas like Haryana and Delhi.\nAdvocacy.\nGovernmental academies and institutes.\nThe Punjabi Sahit academy, Ludhiana, established in 1954 is supported by the Punjab state government and works exclusively for promotion of the Punjabi language, as does the Punjabi academy in Delhi. The Jammu and Kashmir academy of art, culture and literature in Jammu and Kashmir UT, India works for Punjabi and other regional languages like Urdu, Dogri, Gojri etc. Institutions in neighbouring states as well as in Lahore, Pakistan also advocate for the language.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Concretely, this means that if an element formula_1 is performed an operation formula_2 by itself several times, it doesn't matter in which order the operations are carried out, so for instance formula_3.\nExamples and properties.\nEvery associative algebra is power-associative, but so are all other alternative algebras (like the octonions, which are non-associative) and even non-alternative flexible algebras like the sedenions, trigintaduonions, and Okubo algebras. Any Jordan algebra is power-associative. Any algebra whose elements are idempotent is also power-associative.\nExponentiation to the power of any positive integer can be defined consistently whenever multiplication is power-associative. For example, there is no need to distinguish whether \"x\"3 should be defined as (\"xx\")\"x\" or as \"x\"(\"xx\"), since these are equal. Exponentiation to the power of zero can also be defined if the operation has an identity element, so the existence of identity elements is useful in power-associative contexts.\nOver a field of characteristic 0, an algebra is power-associative if and only if it satisfies formula_4 and formula_5, where formula_6 is the associator (Albert 1948).\nOver an infinite field of prime characteristic formula_7 there is no finite set of identities that characterizes power-associativity, but there are infinite independent sets, as described by Gainov (1970):\nA substitution law holds for real power-associative algebras with unit, which basically asserts that multiplication of polynomials works as expected. For \"f\" a real polynomial in \"x\", and for any \"a\" in such an algebra define \"f\"(\"a\") to be the element of the algebra resulting from the obvious substitution of \"a\" into \"f\". Then for any two such polynomials \"f\" and \"g\", we have that (\"fg\")(\"a\") = \"f\"(\"a\")\"g\"(\"a\")."}

It does not need any parentheses as long as each operator has a fixed number of operands. The description \"Polish\" refers to the nationality of logician Jan \u0141ukasiewicz,2478 who invented Polish notation in 1924.367, Footnote 3180, Footnote 3\nThe term \"Polish notation\" is sometimes taken (as the opposite of \"infix notation\") to also include reverse Polish notation.\nWhen Polish notation is used as a syntax for mathematical expressions by programming language interpreters, it is readily parsed into abstract syntax trees and can, in fact, define a one-to-one representation for the same. Because of this, Lisp (see below) and related programming languages define their entire syntax in prefix notation (and others use postfix notation).\nHistory.\nA quotation from a paper by Jan \u0141ukasiewicz in 1931367, Footnote 3180, Footnote 3 states how the notation was invented:\nI came upon the idea of a parenthesis-free notation in 1924. I used that notation for the first time in my article \u0141ukasiewicz (1), p. 610, footnote.\nThe reference cited by \u0141ukasiewicz, i.e., \u0141ukasiewicz (1), is apparently a lithographed report in Polish. The referring paper by \u0141ukasiewicz was reviewed by Henry A. Pogorzelski in the \"Journal of Symbolic Logic\" in 1965. Heinrich Behmann, editor in 1924 of the article of Moses Sch\u00f6nfinkel, already had the idea of eliminating parentheses in logic formulas. In one of his papers \u0141ukasiewicz stated that his notation is the most compact and the first linearly written parentheses-free notation, but not the first one as Gottlob Frege proposed his parentheses-free Begriffsschrift notation in 1879 already.\nAlonzo Church mentions this notation in his classic book on mathematical logic as worthy of remark in notational systems even contrasted to Alfred Whitehead and Bertrand Russell's logical notational exposition and work in Principia Mathematica.\nIn \u0141ukasiewicz's 1951 book, \"Aristotle's Syllogistic from the Standpoint of Modern Formal Logic\", he mentions that the principle of his notation was to write the functors before the arguments to avoid brackets and that he had employed his notation in his logical papers since 1929.78 He then goes on to cite, as an example, a 1930 paper he wrote with Alfred Tarski on the sentential calculus.\nWhile no longer used much in logic, Polish notation has since found a place in computer science.\nExplanation.\nThe expression for adding the numbers 1 and 2 is written in Polish notation as + 1 2 (prefix), rather than as 1 + 2 (infix). In more complex expressions, the operators still precede their operands, but the operands may themselves be expressions including again operators and their operands. For instance, the expression that would be written in conventional infix notation as\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;(5 \u2212 6) \u00d7 7\ncan be written in Polish notation as\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;\u00d7 (\u2212 5 6) 7\nAssuming a given arity of all involved operators (here the \"\u2212\" denotes the binary operation of subtraction, not the unary function of sign-change), any well-formed prefix representation is unambiguous, and brackets within the prefix expression are unnecessary. As such, the above expression can be further simplified to\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;\u00d7 \u2212 5 6 7\nThe processing of the product is deferred until its two operands are available (i.e., 5 minus 6, and 7). As with \"any\" notation, the innermost expressions are evaluated first, but in Polish notation this \"innermost-ness\" can be conveyed by the sequence of operators and operands rather than by bracketing.\nIn the conventional infix notation, parentheses are required to override the standard precedence rules, since, referring to the above example, moving them\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;5 \u2212 (6 \u00d7 7)\nor removing them\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;5 \u2212 6 \u00d7 7\nchanges the meaning and the result of the expression. This version is written in Polish notation as\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;\u2212 5 \u00d7 6 7.\nWhen dealing with non-commutative operations, like division or subtraction, it is necessary to coordinate the sequential arrangement of the operands with the definition of how the operator takes its arguments, i.e., from left to right. For example, \u00f7 10 5, with 10 to the left of 5, has the meaning of 10 \u00f7 5 (read as \"divide 10 by 5\"), or \u2212 7 6, with 7 left to 6, has the meaning of 7 \u2212 6 (read as \"subtract from 7 the operand 6\").\nEvaluation algorithm.\nPrefix/postfix notation is especially popular for its innate ability to express the intended order of operations without the need for parentheses and other precedence rules, as are usually employed with infix notation. Instead, the notation uniquely indicates which operator to evaluate first. The operators are assumed to have a fixed arity each, and all necessary operands are assumed to be explicitly given. A valid prefix expression always starts with an operator and ends with an operand. Evaluation can either proceed from left to right, or in the opposite direction. Starting at the left, the input string, consisting of tokens denoting operators or operands, is pushed token for token on a stack, until the top entries of the stack contain the number of operands that fits to the top most operator (immediately beneath). This group of tokens at the stacktop (the last stacked operator and the according number of operands) is replaced by the result of executing the operator on these/this operand(s). Then the processing of the input continues in this manner. The rightmost operand in a valid prefix expression thus empties the stack, except for the result of evaluating the whole expression. When starting at the right, the pushing of tokens is performed similarly, just the evaluation is triggered by an operator, finding the appropriate number of operands that fits its arity already at the stacktop. Now the leftmost token of a valid prefix expression must be an operator, fitting to the number of operands in the stack, which again yields the result. As can be seen from the description, a push-down store with no capability of arbitrary stack inspection suffices to implement this parsing.\nThe above sketched stack manipulation works\u2014with mirrored input\u2014also for expressions in reverse Polish notation.\nPolish notation for logic.\nThe table below shows the core of Jan \u0141ukasiewicz's notation in modern logic, which was also used, for instance, in \"Formal Logic\" by Arthur Prior. Some letters in the Polish notation table stand for particular words in Polish, as shown:\nThe quantifiers ranged over propositional values in \u0141ukasiewicz's work on many-valued logics.\nBoche\u0144ski introduced a system of Polish notation that names all 16 binary connectives of classical propositional logic.16 For classical propositional logic, it is a compatible extension of the notation of \u0141ukasiewicz. But the notations are incompatible in the sense that Boche\u0144ski uses formula_1 and formula_2 (for nonimplication and converse nonimplication) in propositional logic and \u0141ukasiewicz uses formula_1 and formula_2 in modal logic.\nImplementations.\nPrefix notation has seen wide application in Lisp S-expressions, where the parentheses are required since the operators in the language are themselves data (first-class functions). Lisp functions may also be variadic. The Tcl programming language, much like Lisp also uses Polish notation through the mathop library. The Ambi programming language uses Polish notation for arithmetic operations and program construction. LDAP filter syntax uses Polish prefix notation.\nPostfix notation is used in many stack-oriented programming languages like PostScript and Forth. CoffeeScript syntax also allows functions to be called using prefix notation, while still supporting the unary postfix syntax common in other languages.\nThe number of return values of an expression equals the difference between the number of operands in an expression and the total arity of the operators minus the total number of return values of the operators.\nPolish notation, usually in postfix form, is the chosen notation of certain calculators, notably from Hewlett-Packard. At a lower level, postfix operators are used by some stack machines such as the Burroughs large systems.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Primary schooling follows preschool and precedes secondary schooling.\nThe International Standard Classification of Education considers primary education as a single phase where programmes are typically designed to provide fundamental skills in reading, writing, and mathematics and to establish a solid foundation for learning. This is ISCED Level 1: Primary education or first stage of basic education.\nTerms.\nThe word phrase \"primary school\" is a calque from French , which was first used in a text of London Times in April 1802.\nPrimary schools.\nIn most parts of the world, primary education is the first stage of compulsory education, and is normally available without charge, but may also be offered by fee-paying independent schools. The term grade school is sometimes used in the US, although both this term and elementary school may refer to the first eight grades, in other words both primary education and lower secondary education.\nIn the United Kingdom, \"elementary education\" was taught in \"elementary schools\" until 1944, when free elementary education was proposed for students over 11: there were to be primary elementary schools and secondary elementary schools; these became known as primary schools and secondary schools.\nElementary schools.\nAlthough often used as a synonym, \"elementary school\" has specific meanings in different locations.\nIn other languages.\nChinese.\nIn Chinese-speaking world except of Taiwan, the Chinese word () is used. is only used in Taiwan.\nIn older texts it can mean linguistics including phonology, grammatology and semantics. \nGerman.\n (lit.\u2009'ground/basic school') is the word in Germany. is used in Liechtenstein and Switzerland. is used in Austria and Switzerland.\nComparison of cohorts.\nWithin the English speaking world, there are three widely-used systems to describe the age of the children in the cohort:\nCanada also follows the American model, although its names for year groups are given as a number after the grade: For instance, \"Grade 1\" in Canada, rather than \"First Grade\" in the United States. This terminology extends into the research literature.\nIn Canada, education is a provincial, not a federal responsibility. For example, the province of Ontario also had a \"Grade 13\", designed to help students enter the workforce or post-secondary education, but this was phased out in the year 2003.\nTheoretical framework of primary school design.\nSchool building design does not happen in isolation. The building (or school campus) needs to accommodate:\nEach country will have a different education system and priorities. Schools need to accommodate students, staff, storage, mechanical and electrical systems, support staff, ancillary staff and administration. The number of rooms required can be determined from the predicted roll of the school and the area needed.\nAccording to standards used in the United Kingdom, a general classroom for 30 reception class or infant (Keystage 1) students needs to be 62\u00a0m2, or 55\u00a0m2 for juniors (Keystage 2). Examples are given on how this can be configured for a 210 place primary with attached 26 place nursery and two-storey 420 place (two form entry) primary school with attached 26 place nursery.\nBuilding design specifications.\nThe building providing the education has to fulfill the needs of: The students, the teachers, the non-teaching support staff, the administrators and the community. It has to meet general government building guidelines, health requirements, minimal functional requirements for classrooms, toilets and showers, electricity and services, preparation and storage of textbooks and basic teaching aids. An optimum school will meet the minimum conditions and will have:\nGovernment accountants having read the advice then publish minimum guidelines on schools. These enable environmental modelling and establishing building costs. Future design plans are audited to ensure that these standards are met but not exceeded. Government ministries continue to press for the 'minimum' space and cost standards to be reduced.\nThe UK government published this downwardly revised space formula for primary schools in 2014. It said the floor area should be 350 m2 + 4.1 m2/pupil place. The external finishes were to be downgraded to meet a build cost of \u00a31113/m2.\nGovernance and funding.\nThere are several main ways of funding a school: by the state through general taxation, by a pressure group such as a mosque or church, by a charity, by contributions from parents, or by a combination of these methods. Day-to-day oversight of the school can through a board of governors, the pressure group, or the owner.\nThe United Kingdom allows elementary education to be delivered in church schools, whereas in France this is illegal as there is strict separation of church and state.\nAccountability.\nThis can be through informal assessment by the staff and governors such as in Finland, or by a state run testing regime such as Ofsted in the United Kingdom.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It borders the Liguria region to the south, the Lombardy and Emilia-Romagna regions to the east, and the Aosta Valley region to the northwest. Piedmont also borders Switzerland to the north and France to the west. \nPiedmont has an area of , making it the second-largest region of Italy after Sicily. It has 4,255,702 inhabitants as of 2025. The capital of Piedmont is Turin. This city was the first capital of the Kingdom of Italy, from 1861 to 1865.\nToponymy.\nThe French \"Piedmont\", the Italian \"Piemonte\", and other variant cognates come from the medieval Latin or , i.e. , meaning \"at the foot of the mountains\" (referring to the Alps), attested in documents from the end of the 12th century.\nGeography.\nPiedmont is surrounded on three sides by the Alps, including Monviso, where the river Po rises, and Monte Rosa. It borders France (Auvergne-Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes and Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te d'Azur), Switzerland (Ticino and Valais), and the Italian regions of Lombardy, Liguria, Aosta Valley, and for a very small part with Emilia Romagna. The geography of Piedmont is 43.3% mountainous, along with extensive areas of hills (30.3%) and plains (26.4%).\nPiedmont is the second largest of Italy's 20 regions, after Sicily. It is broadly coincident with the upper part of the drainage basin of the river Po, which rises from the slopes of Monviso in the west of the region and is Italy's largest river. The Po drains the semicircle formed by the Alps and Apennines, which surround the region on three sides.\nThe countryside is very diverse: from the rugged peaks of the massifs of Monte Rosa and Gran Paradiso to the damp rice paddies of Vercelli and Novara, from the gentle hillsides of the Langhe, Roero, and Montferrat to the plains. 7.6% of the entire territory is considered protected area. There are 56 different national or regional parks; one of the most famous is the Gran Paradiso National Park, between Piedmont and the Aosta Valley.\nPiedmont has a typically temperate climate, which on the Alps becomes progressively temperate-cold and colder as it climbs to altitude. In areas located at low altitudes, winters are relatively cold but not very rainy and often sunny, with the possibility of snowfall, sometimes abundant. Snowfall, on the other hand, is less frequent and occasional in the northeast areas. Summers are hot with local possibilities of strong thunderstorms.\nMajor towns and cities.\nBelow are listed other towns of Piedmont with more than 20,000 inhabitants sorted by population.\nHistory.\nPiedmont was inhabited in early historic times by Celtic-Ligurian tribes such as the Taurini and the Salassi. They were later subdued by the Romans (c.\u2009220 BC), who founded several colonies there including \"Augusta Taurinorum\" (Turin) and \"Eporedia\" (Ivrea). After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, the region was successively invaded by the Burgundians, the Ostrogoths (5th century), East Romans, Lombards (6th century), and Franks (773).\nIn the 9th\u201310th centuries there were further incursions by the Magyars, Saracens and Muslim Moors. At the time Piedmont, as part of the Kingdom of Italy within the Holy Roman Empire, was subdivided into several marches and counties. In 1046, Otto of Savoy added Piedmont to the County of Savoy, with a capital at Chamb\u00e9ry (now in France). Other areas remained independent, such as the powerful \"comuni\" (municipalities) of Asti and Alessandria and the marquisates of Saluzzo and Montferrat. The County of Savoy became the Duchy of Savoy in 1416, and Duke Emanuele Filiberto moved the seat to Turin in 1563. In 1720, the Duke of Savoy became King of Sardinia, founding what evolved into the Kingdom of Sardinia and increasing Turin's importance as a European capital.\nThe Republic of Alba was created in 1796 as a French client republic in Piedmont. A new client republic, the Piedmontese Republic, existed between 1798 and 1799 before it was reoccupied by Austrian and Russian troops. In June 1800, a third client republic, the Subalpine Republic, was established in Piedmont. It fell under full French control in 1801, and France annexed it in September 1802. In the Congress of Vienna, the Kingdom of Sardinia was restored and furthermore received the Republic of Genoa to strengthen it as a barrier against France.\nPiedmont was a springboard for Italian unification in 1859\u20131861, following earlier unsuccessful wars against the Austrian Empire in 1820\u20131821, and 1848\u20131849. This process is sometimes referred to as \"Piedmontisation\". The efforts were later countered by the efforts of rural farmers. The House of Savoy became Kings of Italy, and Turin briefly became the capital of Italy. However, when the Italian capital was moved to Florence, and then to Rome, the administrative and institutional importance of Piedmont was reduced. The only recognition of Piedmont's historical role was that the crown prince of Italy was known as the Prince of Piedmont. After Italian unification, Piedmont was one of the most important regions in the first Italian industrialization.\nEconomy.\nThe gross domestic product (GDP) of the region was 137.4 billion euros in 2018, accounting for 7.8% of Italy's GDP. GDP per capita at purchasing power parity was 31,300 euros or 104% of the EU27 average in the same year. The GDP per employee was 111% of the EU average. Since 2006, the Piemonte Agency for Investments, Export and Tourism began to facilitate outside investment and promote Piedmont's industry and tourism. It was the first Italian institution to combine the activities being carried out by pre-existing local organizations to promote the territory internationally.\nAutomotive.\nThe region contains major industrial centres, the most important of which is Turin, home to the Fiat conglomerate, but mass-market Fiat cars are not produced anymore, only small-scale manufacturing of luxury Maserati cars (36,702 in 2020). Most of the ex-Fiat plants now belong to other companies: aerospace is owned by Leonardo S.p.A., turbo jet engines by General Electric, high-speed trains by Alstom, bearings by SKF. Fiat does not exist anymore as an independent company; car production belongs to Stellantis, and trucks, buses, tractors, agriculture and construction machines are produced by the independent company CNH Industrial (most manufacturing activity takes place in the United States, in Piedmont only the production of New Holland excavators in San Mauro Torinese and Iveco diesel engines in Turin). Neither of them are headquartered in Turin anymore, however, some research and development centres are still working. \nFormerly famous automotive design companies also were sold to global automotive groups: Italdesign Giugiaro to Volkswagen, Ghia to Ford, Pininfarina to Mahindra; Bertone went into bankruptcy in 2014. The massive decline in the automotive industry caused other regions like Veneto (\u20ac163 billion in 2018) and Emilia-Romagna (\u20ac161 billion in 2018) to surpass Piedmont (\u20ac137 billion in 2018) in GDP and led to relative high unemployment. The peak of Italian motor vehicle production is reached in 1989 with 2.22 million units, but in 2019 (before the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy) it was only 0.92 million units. Even existing Italian car production now relocated to Southern Italy, such as in Pomigliano d'Arco (140,478 in 2020), Melfi (229,848 in 2020), and Atessa (257,026 in 2020), because of cost cutting.\nThere are some automotive suppliers of: \nElectronics and industrial equipment.\nThere are some important companies in high-tech manufacturing: Comau (industrial robots) and Prima Industrie (laser equipment). Silicon wafer production is in Novara by MEMC. Olivetti, once a major electronics industry whose plants were in Scarmagno and Ivrea, has now turned into a small-scale computer service company and no longer produces computers. Leonardo Elettronica in Turin-Caselle develops and manufactures airborne mission systems and airborne computers. Machine building has a long tradition in Piedmont with the manufacturing of excavators, telescopic handlers, industrial refrigerators, printing machines, paper machines, packaging machines, glass machines, turbines, and high-speed trains.\nAerospace and defence.\nOne of the most important industries in Piedmont is military aerospace with plants:\nInformation technology.\nPiedmont has several notable IT firms such as Olivetti and Arduino.\nWool textiles.\nItaly is the world's largest exporter of carded (71.8% in 2018) and combed (73.4% in 2018) wool fabrics. These are the only two types of fabrics not dominated by Chinese textile exports. There are three industrial districts that process wool in Italy. One of them, Biella, is located in Piedmont. \nBelow are showed some basic stages of wool processing (not complete).\nJewellery.\nOne of Italy's four industrial jewellery districts is located in Valenza. Large jewellery companies such as Damiani, Bulgari, and Cartier have factories here as do many other smaller companies. \nAgriculture.\nLowland Piedmont is a fertile agricultural region. The main agricultural products in Piedmont are cereals, including rice, representing more than 10% of national production, maize, grapes for wine-making, fruit and milk. With more than 800,000 head of cattle in 2000, livestock production accounts for half of total agricultural production in Piedmont.\nPiedmont is one of the great winegrowing regions in Italy. More than half of its of vineyards are registered with DOC designations. It produces prestigious wines as Barolo and Barbaresco from the Langhe near Alba, and the Moscato d'Asti and sparkling Asti from the vineyards around Asti. The city of Asti is about east of Turin in the plain of the Tanaro River and is one of the most important centres of Montferrat, one of the best known Italian wine districts in the world, declared officially on 22 June 2014 a UNESCO World Heritage site. Indigenous grape varieties include Nebbiolo, Barbera, Dolcetto, Freisa, Grignolino and Brachetto.\nTourism.\nTourism in Piedmont employs 75,534 people and involves 17,367 companies operating in the hospitality and catering sector, with 1,473 hotels and other tourist accommodation. The sector generates a turnover of \u20ac2,671 million, 3.3% of the \u20ac80,196 million total estimated spending on tourism in Italy. The region is popular with both foreign visitors and those from other parts of Italy. In 2002 there were 2,651,068 total arrivals, 1,124,696 (42%) of whom were foreign. The traditional leading areas for tourism in Piedmont are the Lake District (\"Piedmont's riviera\"), which accounts for 32.84% of total overnight stays, and the metropolitan area of Turin, which accounts for 26.51%.\nIn 2006, Turin hosted the XX Olympic Winter Games, and in 2007 it hosted the XXIII Universiade. Alpine tourism tends to concentrate in a few highly developed stations like Alagna Valsesia and Sestriere. Around 1980, the long-distance trail Grande Traversata delle Alpi (GTA) was created to draw more attention to the variety of remote, sparsely inhabited valleys. Within the tourism industry in Piedmont, a reference to the system of Royal Residences has to be made. First of all, it is part of the UNESCO World Heritage Sites since 1997 and, secondly, it represents a peculiarity of the region, since such a network cannot be found elsewhere in Italy. The Residences of the Royal House of Savoy belong to the historical and cultural heritage of Piedmont and nowadays they play a central role in the tourism field. In a reality in which the tourism industry is characterized by an amalgam of several players and stakeholders, the creation of a system or network like that of the Royal Residences represents an added benefit for the whole territory as well as a competitive edge. Therefore, considering that tourism is a key factor in the creation of long-lasting value and working in a cooperative and collaborative perspective is essential, the network of the Royal Residences represents an example worth of notice.\nPiedmont has many small and picturesque villages, 20 of them have been selected by (), a non-profit private association of small Italian towns of strong historical and artistic interest, that was founded on the initiative of the Tourism Council of the National Association of Italian Municipalities. These villages are:\nUnemployment.\nThe unemployment rate stood at 6.2% in 2023.\nTransport.\nAir.\nTurin-Caselle International Airport has domestic and international flights and handled 3,952,158 passengers and 3,334 tons of cargo in 2019 (before the COVID-19 pandemic).\nLand.\nThere are links with neighbouring France via the Fr\u00e9jus and Colle di Tenda tunnels as well as the Montgen\u00e8vre Pass. Piedmont also connects with Switzerland by the Simplon and Great St Bernard passes. It is possible to reach Switzerland via a normal road that crosses eastern Piedmont, starting from Arona and ending in Locarno, on the Swiss border. The region has the longest motorway network amongst the Italian regions, covering approximately . It radiates from Turin, connecting it with the other provinces in the region, as well as with the other regions in Italy. In 2001, the number of passenger cars per 1,000 inhabitants was 623 (above the national average of 575). There is a Turin\u2013Milan high-speed railway; the travel time is only 52 minutes.\nEducation.\nThe economy of Piedmont is anchored on a rich history of state support for higher education, including some of the leading universities in Italy. Piedmont is home to the famous University of Turin, the Polytechnic University of Turin, the University of Eastern Piedmont, and more recently the United Nations Interregional Crime and Justice Research Institute.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nThe population density in Piedmont is lower than the national average. In 2008, it was equal to 174 inhabitants per km2, compared to the national figure of about 200. The Metropolitan City of Turin has 335 inhabitants per km2, whereas Verbano-Cusio-Ossola is the least densely populated province, with 72 inhabitants per km2.\nThe population of Piedmont followed a downward trend throughout the 1980s, a result of the natural negative balance (of some 3 to 4% per year), while the migratory balance since 1986 has again become positive because of immigration. The population remained stable in the 1990s.\nThe Turin metro area grew rapidly in the 1950s and 1960s due to an increase of immigrants from southern Italy and Veneto and today it has a population of approximately two million. As of 2008[ [update]], the Italian national institute of statistics (ISTAT) estimated that 310,543 foreign-born immigrants lived in Piedmont, equal to 7.0% of the total regional population. Most immigrants come from Eastern Europe (mostly from Romania, Albania, and Ukraine) with smaller communities of African immigrants.\nGovernment and politics.\nThe Regional Government (\"Giunta Regionale\") is presided by the president of the region (\"presidente della regione\"), who is elected for a five-year term and is composed of the president and 14 ministers, including a vice president (\"vice presidente\"). In the 2010 Piedmontese regional election, which took place on 29\u201330 March, Roberto Cota of Lega Nord defeated incumbent Mercedes Bresso of the Democratic Party (PD). For the 2014 Piedmontese regional election, Cota chose not to stand again for president and the parties composing his coalition failed to agree on a single candidate, resulting in a landslide victory for Sergio Chiamparino, a member of the PD who had been mayor of Turin from 2001 to 2011. Chiamparino was in charge until the 2019 Piedmontese regional election, when Alberto Cirio of Forza Italia became the new president of the region.\nAdministrative divisions.\nPiedmont is divided into eight provinces.\nCulture.\nLanguages.\nAs in the rest of Italy, Italian is the official national language. The main local languages are Piedmontese, Insubric (spoken in the eastern part of the region), Occitan (spoken by a minority in the Occitan Valleys situated in the Province of Cuneo and the Metropolitan City of Turin), and Franco-Proven\u00e7al (spoken by another minority in the alpine heights of the Metropolitan City of Turin), like in the Susa Valley and Walser (spoken by a minority in the Province of Vercelli and Province of Verbano-Cusio-Ossola).\nCuisine.\nPiedmontese cuisine is the style of cooking in the Northern Italian region of Piedmont. Bordering France and Switzerland, Piedmontese cuisine is partly influenced by French cuisine; this is demonstrated in particular by the importance of appetizers, a set of courses that precede what is traditionally called a first course and aimed at whetting the appetite. In France these courses are fewer and are called \"entr\u00e9e\".\nIt is a region in Italy with the largest number of and wines. The most prestigious Italian culinary school, the University of Gastronomic Sciences, was founded in Piedmont. Similar to other Northern Italian cuisines, veal, wine, and butter are among the main ingredients used in cooking.\nSome well-known dishes include \"agnolotti\", \"vitello tonnato\" (also popular in Argentina), and \"bagna c\u00e0uda\". Piedmont is also credited for the famous pasta dish tagliolini (\"tajarin\" in Piedmontese). \"Tagliolini\" are a type of egg pasta normally made fresh by hand. According to Italian writer and journalist Massimo Alberini, \"tagliolini\" was among King Victor Emmanuel II's preferred dishes.\nCommon in Verbano-Cusio-Ossola area are \"bruscitti\", originating from Alto Milanese, a dish of braised meat cut very thin and cooked in wine and fennel seeds, historically obtained by stripping leftover meat.\nThe Slow Food Movement was started in Piedmont by Carlo Petrini who was from the town of Bra, Piedmont. The movement greatly benefited the region by highlighting Piedmont's diverse cuisine. The Slow Food Movement offices are still headquartered in the town of Bra. \nThe town of Alba is known for its gourmet food. It is also the region where\u00a0Alba white truffles are found.\nSince 2006, the Piedmont region has benefited from the start of the Slow Food movement and Terra Madre, events that highlighted the rich agricultural and viticultural value of the Po Valley and northern Italy. A chain of food halls Eataly works in collaboration with Slow Food. Piedmont is the leading producer of confectionery, coffee, rice, and white truffles in Italy. It is ranked 3 of 20 for the production of quality DOC and DOCG wines with 1,982,718 hl, there are 17 DOCG wines of all possible types (white, red, sweet, sparkling). In 2019, Piedmont accounted for 16.5% of wine exports from Italy, ranking second behind Veneto, with 36%. The typical food industries in Piedmont are:\nSport.\nIn association football, notable clubs in Piedmont include Turin-based Juventus and Torino, who have won 43 official top-flight league championships (as of the 2020\u201321 season) between them (36 titles won by Juventus and seven by Torino), more than any other city in Italy. Juventus is the most successful club in Italy, having won the most league titles (36), Coppa Italia titles (14), and Supercoppa Italiana titles (9) of any team in the country; Juventus Women, established in 2017, also achieved success, immediately becoming one of the country's most successful women's teams. Other smaller teams include the old \"Piedmont Quadrilateral\" components Novara, Alessandria, Casale, and Pro Vercelli. With the pre-World War II success of Pro Vercelli in 1910s and Juventus in 1930s, as well as winning cycles of Torino during the \"Grande Torino\" years and Juventus in different eras since 1950, the region became the most successful in terms of championships won. Casale and Novese contributed with one \"scudetto\" each. Other local teams include volleyball teams Cuneo (male) and AGIL Novara (female), basketball teams Biella Basketball and Junior Casale, ice hockey team Hockey Club Turin, and roller hockey side Amatori Vercelli, who have won three league titles, an Italian Cup, and two CERS Cups. \nTurin hosted the 2006 Winter Olympics. The 2006 Winter Olympics (), officially the XX Olympic Winter Games () and also known as Torino 2006, were a winter multi-sport event held from 10 to 26\u00a0February in Turin, Italy. This marked the second time Italy had hosted the Winter Olympics, the first being in 1956 in Cortina d'Ampezzo; Italy had also hosted the Summer Olympics in 1960 in Rome. Turin was selected as the host city for the 2006 Games in June 1999. The official motto of Torino 2006 was \"Passion lives here\". The Games' logo depicted a stylized profile of the Mole Antonelliana building, drawn in white and blue ice crystals, signifying the snow and the sky. The crystal web was also meant to portray the web of new technologies and the Olympic spirit of community. The 2006 Olympic mascots were Neve (\"snow\" in Italian), a female snowball, and Gliz, a male ice cube.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Some Palestinians accept a two-state solution, with the West Bank and the Gaza Strip forming a distinct Palestinian state, whereas other Palestinians insist on a one-state solution (Palestinian or binational) with equal rights for all citizens whether they are Muslims, Christians or Jews. In this scenario, Palestinian refugees may be allowed to resettle the land they were forced to flee in the 1948 Palestinian expulsion and flight.\nBackground.\nPalestinians have held diverse views and perceptions of the peace process. A key starting point for understanding these views is an awareness of the differing objectives sought by advocates of the Palestinian cause. 'New Historian' Israeli academic Ilan Pappe says the cause of the conflict from a Palestinian point of view dates back to 1948 with the creation of Israel (rather than Israel\u2019s views of 1967 being the crucial point and the return of occupied territories being central to peace negotiations), and that the conflict has been a fight to bring home refugees to a Palestinian state. Therefore, this for some was the ultimate aim of the peace process, and for groups such as Hamas still is. However, Jerome Slater says that this \u2018maximalist\u2019 view of a destruction of Israel in order to regain Palestinian lands, a view held by Arafat and the PLO initially, has steadily moderated from the late 1960s onwards to a preparedness to negotiate and instead seek a two-state solution. The Oslo Accords demonstrated the recognition of this acceptance by the then Palestinian leadership of the State of Israel\u2019s right to exist in return for the withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Gaza Strip and West Bank. However, there are recurrent themes prevalent throughout peace process negotiations including a feeling that Israel offers too little and a mistrust of its actions and motives. Yet, the demand for the Right of Return by descendants of Palestinian refugees to Israel has remained a cornerstone of the Palestinian view and has been repeatedly enunciated by Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas.\nYasser Arafat and the PLO.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Rquote/styles.css\"/&gt;{ class=\"rquote pullquote floatleft\" role=\"presentation\" style=\"display:table; border-collapse:collapse; border-style:none; float:left; margin:0.5em 0.75em; width:33%; \"\nThe PLO has complex, often contradictory attitudes to peace with Israel. Officially, the PLO accepted Israel's right to exist in peace, which was the first of the PLO's obligations under the Oslo Accords. In Yasser Arafat's 9 September 1993 letter to Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, as part of the first Oslo Accord, Arafat stated that \"The PLO recognizes the right of the State of Israel to exist in peace and security.\" These remarks from Arafat were seen as a shift from one of the PLO's previous primary aims\u2014the destruction of Israel.\nHowever, during the 1990s and 2000s the PLO leadership has stated that it considered any peace with Israel was to be temporary until the dream of Israel's destruction could be realized. According to British-Israeli historian Efraim Karsh, Arafat often spoke of the peace process in terms of \"justice\" for the Palestinians; terms Karsh described as \"euphemisms rooted in Islamic and Arabic history for the liberation of the whole of Palestine from 'foreign occupiers.'\" When describing his views of the peace process among Arab leaders and in the media of the Arab world, Arafat's rhetoric became noticeably more bellicose than it was when among Western leaders and media outside of the Arab world according to Karsh. The period saw a disconnect between what the PLO's second in command Abu Iyad referred to as \"the language of peace\" and support of fighting Israel.\nSince the 1990s, there has been a debate within the PLO as to whether to halt fighting with Israel completely or to continue attacking Israel as well as negotiate diplomatically with Israel. In practice, violence was never fully banned. Furthermore, assassination attempts by radical Palestinian factions within the PLO since the early years of the peace process kept Arafat from expressing full, public support of the peace process or condemnation of violence without risking further danger to his own life.\nIn 2000, Arafat participated in the Camp David Summit with Ehud Barak. Arafat rejected Israel's offer because it did not include Palestinian control of East Jerusalem or the right of return of Palestinian refugees. In response, Barak stated that Israel had \"no partner\" in peace, and Israelis increasingly viewed Palestinians as unwilling to make peace. Israeli-British historian Efraim Karsh referred to Arafat's insistence on the right of return as aiming for \"Israel\u2019s destruction through demographic subversion\u201d. Similarly, Alan Dershowitz stated that Arafat put his desire to destroy Israel above his dream of building a Palestinian state.\nIn 2009, chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat pointed to stopping Israeli settlements on Palestinian land and a plan for a Palestinian state on the 1967 borders as the highest Palestinian priorities in peace talks. Peace talks between Israel and Arafat's successor, Mahmoud Abbas, have made little progress due to the continued increase of Israeli settlements in the West Bank.\nHamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad.\nIn 1981, an offshoot of the Palestinian Muslim Brotherhood called Islamic Jihad was founded. Unlike the Muslim Brotherhood, they declined to negotiate with Israel and focused on armed conflict with Israel rather than Islamic education. The Muslim Brotherhood became increasingly supportive of armed resistance and eventually decided to form Hamas.\nEstablished in 1988 during the First Intifada, Hamas's founding charter refers to modern-day Israel and Palestine as \"an Islamic land entrusted to the Muslim generations\". It rejects the validity of the State of Israel and emphasizes the importance of armed resistance for Palestinian liberation. The document is often characterized as calling for the destruction of Israel.\nWhile the PLO pursued the Oslo Accords and other plans for peace with Israel, Hamas opposed them and engaged in suicide attacks on Israelis in the 1990s. The attacks, intended to prevent the peace talks from progressing, contributed to both Israeli disillusionment with the peace process and the election of Benjamin Netanyahu, who also opposed the Oslo Accords. Polling showed that most Palestinians opposed the suicide attacks.\nHamas considered the PLO's strategy of peace talks with Israel to be a \"path of surrender\" that would lead to a \u201clife of humiliation [under] a despicable occupation\" due to the PLO's agreement to adopt responsibility for security in the West Bank under the Palestinian Authority. After the collapse of the 2000 Camp David Summit, Hamas urged the PLO to join their \"jihadist project for our struggle\".\nWhen the Second Intifada broke out, Hamas and Islamic Jihad participated. Hamas viewed violence as a tool for deterring Israeli attacks and gaining concessions from Israel, and many Palestinians saw it as justified due to Israeli actions, including building settlements in the West Bank. Hamas undertook a ceasefire with Israel in August 2004. The Palestinian Islamic Jihad was unhappy with the ceasefire. In September 2005, Hamas was criticized by Islamic Jihad for calling off rocket attacks on Israel from Gaza.\nAccording to a March 2006 poll, 70% of Hamas supporters said they would want peace with Israel if a Palestinian state was established. Beginning in 2006, Hamas has called for a Palestinian state along the 1967 borders. In 2008, Hamas publicly offered a long-term hudna (truce) with Israel if Israel agreed to return to the 1967 borders and to allow the right of return to all Palestinian refugees. In 2010, Hamas Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh announced that Hamas would accept the outcome of a Palestinian referendum on a peace treaty with Israel even if the results were not in line with their ideology. Additionally he said that Hamas would \"accept a Palestinian state on the borders of 1967, with Jerusalem as its capital, the release of Palestinian prisoners, and the resolution of the issue of refugees.\" This represented a departure from Hamas's earlier opposition to ceding any land of historic Palestine to Israel.\nIn 2012, Mousa Abu Marzook, a high-ranking Hamas official in competition with Haniyeh for Hamas' top leadership post, gave an interview in which he expressed a range of opinions, some of which differed from the organisation's actual stance. He said that Hamas will not recognize Israel and will not feel bound to understand a peace treaty negotiated by Fatah as a recognition of Israel, calling instead for a \"hudna\" (temporary truce). Abu Marzook echoed Haniyeh's demand that Palestinians should be given the unconditional right to return into what is now Israel proper.\nProminent Palestinians.\nRashid Abu Shbak, a senior PA security official declared, \"The light which has shone over Gaza and Jericho [when the PA assumed control over those areas] will also reach the Negev and the Galilee [which constitute a large portion of pre-1967 Israel].\"\nThe PA's Voice of Palestine radio station broadcast a Friday prayer sermon by Yusuf Abu Sneineh, official preacher at Jerusalem's Al-Aqsa Mosque, over the radio. In it, he asserted, \"The struggle we are waging is an ideological struggle and the question is: where has the Islamic land of Palestine gone? Where [are] Haifa and Jaffa, Lod and Ramle, Acre, Safed and Tiberias? Where is Hebron and Jerusalem?\"\nPA cabinet minister Abdul Aziz Shaheen told the official PA newspaper, \"Al-Havat Al-Jadida\", on January 4, 1998, \"The Oslo accord was a preface for the Palestinian Authority and the Palestinian Authority will be a preface for the Palestinian state which, in its turn, will be a preface for the liberation of the entire Palestinian land.\"\nFaisal Husseini, former Palestinian Authority Minister for Jerusalem, compared the Al-Aqsa Intifada following the Oslo peace process to the tactic of coming out of the Trojan Horse used by the Greeks in the myth of the Trojan War.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is a direct product in the category of rings.\nSince direct products are defined up to an isomorphism, one says colloquially that a ring is the product of some rings if it is isomorphic to the direct product of these rings. For example, the Chinese remainder theorem may be stated as: if m and n are coprime integers, the quotient ring formula_1 is the product of formula_2 and formula_3\nExamples.\nAn important example is Z/\"n\"Z, the ring of integers modulo \"n\". If \"n\" is written as a product of prime powers (see Fundamental theorem of arithmetic),\nformula_4\nwhere the \"pi\" are distinct primes, then Z/\"n\"Z is naturally isomorphic to the product\nformula_5\nThis follows from the Chinese remainder theorem.\nProperties.\nIf \"R\" = \u03a0\"i\"\u2208\"I\" \"R\"\"i\" is a product of rings, then for every \"i\" in \"I\" we have a surjective ring homomorphism \"pi\" : \"R\" \u2192 \"Ri\" which projects the product on the \"i\"th coordinate. The product \"R\" together with the projections \"pi\" has the following universal property: \nif \"S\" is any ring and \"fi\" : \"S\" \u2192 \"Ri\" is a ring homomorphism for every \"i\" in \"I\", then there exists \"precisely one\" ring homomorphism \"f\" : \"S\" \u2192 \"R\" such that \"pi\"\u2009\u2218\u2009\"f\" = \"fi\" for every \"i\" in \"I\".\nThis shows that the product of rings is an instance of products in the sense of category theory. \nWhen \"I\" is finite, the underlying additive group of \u03a0\"i\"\u2208\"I\" \"R\"\"i\" coincides with the direct sum of the additive groups of the \"R\"\"i\". In this case, some authors call \"R\" the \"direct sum of the rings \"R\"\"i\"\" and write \u2295\"i\"\u2208\"I\" \"R\"\"i\", but this is incorrect from the point of view of category theory, since it is usually not a coproduct in the category of rings (with identity): for example, when two or more of the \"R\"\"i\" are non-trivial, the inclusion map \"Ri\" \u2192 \"R\" fails to map 1 to 1 and hence is not a ring homomorphism.\nDirect products are commutative and associative up to natural isomorphism, meaning that it doesn't matter in which order one forms the direct product.\nIf \"Ai\" is an ideal of \"Ri\" for each \"i\" in \"I\", then \"A\" = \u03a0\"i\"\u2208\"I\" \"Ai\" is an ideal of \"R\". If \"I\" is finite, then the converse is true, i.e., every ideal of \"R\" is of this form. However, if \"I\" is infinite and the rings \"Ri\" are non-trivial, then the converse is false: the set of elements with all but finitely many nonzero coordinates forms an ideal which is not a direct product of ideals of the \"Ri\". The ideal \"A\" is a prime ideal in \"R\" if all but one of the \"Ai\" are equal to \"Ri\" and the remaining \"Ai\" is a prime ideal in \"Ri\". However, the converse is not true when \"I\" is infinite. For example, the direct sum of the \"Ri\" form an ideal not contained in any such \"A\", but the axiom of choice gives that it is contained in some maximal ideal which is a fortiori prime.\nAn element \"x\" in \"R\" is a unit if and only if all of its components are units, i.e., if and only if \"p\"\"i\"(\"x\") is a unit in \"Ri\" for every \"i\" in \"I\". The group of units of \"R\" is the product of the groups of units of the \"Ri\".\nA product of two or more non-trivial rings always has nonzero zero divisors: if \"x\" is an element of the product whose coordinates are all zero except \"p\"\"i\"(\"x\") and \"y\" is an element of the product with all coordinates zero except \"p\"\"j\"(\"y\") where \"i\"\u00a0\u2260\u00a0\"j\", then \"xy\"\u00a0=\u00a00 in the product ring."}

It involves rethinking old ideas about right and wrong (ethics) and core beliefs (philosophy) to recognize that humans are connected to all life and systems, not just other people. \nPosthumanism posits that we must see that humans are tied to the \"nonhuman\";ie, plants and animals. This includes our likewise animal nature (biology), our connection to the environment (ecology), and the tools and extensions we create (technology). It also points out that we need to develop a new sense of care, duty, and modesty because nonhuman elements are increasingly seen as having an active role in the world. Afterall, the aim of posthumanism is not to escape reality in the future or rely only on technology. Instead, it seeks a deeper, more complex understanding of our present situation and where we belong within it.\nPhilosophical posthumanism.\nPhilosopher Theodore Schatzki suggests there are two varieties of posthumanism of the philosophical kind:\nOne, which he calls \"objectivism\", tries to counter the overemphasis of the subjective, or intersubjective, that pervades humanism, and emphasises the role of the nonhuman agents, whether they be animals and plants, or computers or other things, because \"Humans and nonhumans, it [objectivism] proclaims, codetermine one another\", and also claims \"independence of (some) objects from human activity and conceptualization\".\nA second posthumanist agenda is \"the prioritization of practices over individuals (or individual subjects)\", which, they say, constitute the individual.\nThere may be a third kind of posthumanism, propounded by the philosopher Herman Dooyeweerd. Though he did not label it \"posthumanism\", he made an immanent critique of humanism, and then constructed a philosophy that presupposed neither humanist, nor scholastic, nor Greek thought but started with a different religious ground motive. Dooyeweerd prioritized law and meaningfulness as that which enables humanity and all else to exist, behave, live, occur, etc. \"\"Meaning\" is the \"being\" of all that has been \"created\"\", Dooyeweerd wrote, \"and the nature even of our selfhood\". Both human and nonhuman alike function subject to a common \"law-side\", which is diverse, composed of a number of distinct law-spheres or \"aspects\". The temporal being of both human and non-human is multi-aspectual; for example, both plants and humans are bodies, functioning in the biotic aspect, and both computers and humans function in the formative and lingual aspect, but humans function in the aesthetic, juridical, ethical and faith aspects too. The Dooyeweerdian version is able to incorporate and integrate both the objectivist version and the practices version, because it allows nonhuman agents their own subject-functioning in various aspects and places emphasis on aspectual functioning.\nEmergence of philosophical posthumanism.\nIhab Hassan, theorist in the academic study of literature, once stated: \"Humanism may be coming to an end as humanism transforms itself into something one must helplessly call posthumanism.\" This view predates most currents of posthumanism which have developed over the late 20th century in somewhat diverse, but complementary, domains of thought and practice. For example, Hassan is a known scholar whose theoretical writings expressly address postmodernity in society. Beyond postmodernist studies, posthumanism has been developed and deployed by various cultural theorists, often in reaction to problematic inherent assumptions within humanistic thought and Enlightenment thought.\nTheorists who both complement and contrast Hassan include Michel Foucault, Judith Butler, cyberneticists such as Gregory Bateson, Warren McCullouch, Norbert Wiener, and thinkers such as Bruno Latour, Cary Wolfe, Elaine Graham, N. Katherine Hayles, Benjamin H. Bratton, Donna Haraway, Rosi Braidotti, Francesca Ferrando, Peter Sloterdijk, Stefan Lorenz Sorgner, Evan Thompson, Francisco Varela, Humberto Maturana, Timothy Morton, and Douglas Kellner. Among the theorists are philosophers, such as Robert Pepperell, who have written about a \"posthuman condition\", which is often substituted for the term \"posthumanism\".\nPosthumanism differs from classical humanism by relegating humanity back to one of many natural species, thereby rejecting any claims founded on anthropocentric dominance. According to this claim, humans have no inherent rights to destroy nature or set themselves above it in ethical considerations \"a priori\". Human knowledge is also reduced to a less controlling position, previously seen as the defining aspect of the world. Human rights exist on a spectrum with animal rights and posthuman rights. The limitations and fallibility of human intelligence are confessed, even though it does not imply abandoning the rational tradition of humanism.\nProponents of a posthuman discourse, suggest that innovative advancements and emerging technologies have transcended the traditional model of the human, as proposed by Descartes among others associated with philosophy of the Enlightenment. Posthumanistic views were also found in the works of Shakespeare. In contrast to humanism, the discourse of posthumanism seeks to redefine the boundaries surrounding modern philosophical understanding of the human. Posthumanism represents an evolution of thought beyond that of the contemporary social boundaries and is predicated on the seeking of truth within a postmodern context. In so doing, it rejects previous attempts to establish \"anthropological universals\" that are imbued with anthropocentric assumptions. Recently, critics have sought to describe the emergence of posthumanism as a critical moment in modernity, arguing for the origins of key posthuman ideas in modern fiction, in Nietzsche, or in a modernist response to the crisis of historicity.\nAlthough Nietzsche's philosophy has been characterized as posthumanist, Foucault placed posthumanism within a context that differentiated humanism from Enlightenment thought. According to Foucault, the two existed in a state of tension: as humanism sought to establish norms while Enlightenment thought attempted to transcend all that is material, including the boundaries that are constructed by humanistic thought. Drawing on the Enlightenment's challenges to the boundaries of humanism, posthumanism rejects the various assumptions of human dogmas (anthropological, political, scientific) and takes the next step by attempting to change the nature of thought about what it means to be human. This requires not only decentering the human in multiple discourses (evolutionary, ecological and technological) but also examining those discourses to uncover inherent humanistic, anthropocentric, normative notions of humanness and the concept of the human.\nContemporary posthumanist discourse.\nPosthumanistic discourse aims to open up spaces to examine what it means to be human and critically question the concept of \"the human\" in light of current cultural and historical contexts. In her book \"How We Became Posthuman\", N. Katherine Hayles, writes about the struggle between different versions of the posthuman as it continually co-evolves alongside intelligent machines. Such coevolution, according to some strands of the posthuman discourse, allows one to extend their subjective understandings of real experiences beyond the boundaries of embodied existence. According to Hayles's view of posthuman, often referred to as \"technological posthumanism\", visual perception and digital representations thus paradoxically become ever more salient. Even as one seeks to extend knowledge by deconstructing perceived boundaries, it is these same boundaries that make knowledge acquisition possible. The use of technology in a contemporary society is thought to complicate this relationship.\nHayles discusses the translation of human bodies into information (as suggested by Hans Moravec) in order to illuminate how the boundaries of our embodied reality have been compromised in the current age and how narrow definitions of humanness no longer apply. Because of this, according to Hayles, posthumanism is characterized by a loss of subjectivity based on bodily boundaries. This strand of posthumanism, including the changing notion of subjectivity and the disruption of ideas concerning what it means to be human, is often associated with Donna Haraway's concept of the cyborg. However, Haraway has distanced herself from posthumanistic discourse due to other theorists' use of the term to promote utopian views of technological innovation to extend the human biological capacity (even though these notions would more correctly fall into the realm of transhumanism).\nWhile posthumanism is a broad and complex ideology, it has relevant implications today and for the future. It attempts to redefine social structures without inherently humanly or even biological origins, but rather in terms of social and psychological systems where consciousness and communication could potentially exist as unique disembodied entities. Questions subsequently emerge with respect to the current use and the future of technology in shaping human existence, as do new concerns with regards to language, symbolism, subjectivity, phenomenology, ethics, justice and creativity.\nTechnological versus non-technological.\nPosthumanism can be divided into \"non-technological\" and \"technological\" forms.\nNon-technological posthumanism.\nWhile posthumanization has links with the scholarly methodologies of posthumanism, it is a distinct phenomenon. The rise of explicit posthumanism as a scholarly approach is relatively recent, occurring since the late 1970s; however, some of the processes of posthumanization that it studies are ancient. For example, the dynamics of \"non-technological\" posthumanization have existed historically in all societies in which animals were incorporated into families as household pets or in which ghosts, monsters, angels, or semidivine heroes were considered to play some role in the world.\nSuch non-technological posthumanization has been manifested not only in mythological and literary works but also in the construction of temples, cemeteries, zoos, or other physical structures that were considered to be inhabited or used by quasi- or para-human beings who were not natural, living, biological human beings but who nevertheless played some role within a given society, to the extent that, according to philosopher Francesca Ferrando: \"the notion of spirituality dramatically broadens our understanding of the posthuman, allowing us to investigate not only technical technologies (robotics, cybernetics, biotechnology, nanotechnology, among others), but also, technologies of existence.\"\nTechnological posthumanism.\nSome forms of technological posthumanization involve efforts to directly alter the social, psychological, or physical structures and behaviors of the human being through the development and application of technologies relating to genetic engineering or neurocybernetic augmentation; such forms of posthumanization are studied, e.g., by cyborg theory. Other forms of technological posthumanization indirectly \"posthumanize\" human society through the deployment of social robots or attempts to develop artificial general intelligences, sentient networks, or other entities that can collaborate and interact with human beings as members of posthumanized societies. N. Katherine Hayles' \"How We Became Posthuman\", explores the changing perspectives and relationships between technology and information as a discourse on human society.\nThe dynamics of technological posthumanization have long been an important element of science fiction; genres such as cyberpunk take them as a central focus. In recent decades, technological posthumanization has also become the subject of increasing attention by scholars and policymakers. The expanding and accelerating forces of technological posthumanization have generated diverse and conflicting responses, with some researchers viewing the processes of posthumanization as opening the door to a more meaningful and advanced transhumanist future for humanity, while other bioconservative critiques warn that such processes may lead to a fragmentation of human society, loss of meaning, and subjugation to the forces of technology.\nCommon features.\nProcesses of technological and non-technological posthumanization both tend to result in a partial \"de-anthropocentrization\" of human society, as its circle of membership is expanded to include other types of entities and the position of human beings is decentered. A common theme of posthumanist study is the way in which processes of posthumanization challenge or blur simple binaries, such as those of \"human versus non-human\", \"natural versus artificial\", \"alive versus non-alive\", and \"biological versus mechanical\".\nRelationship with transhumanism.\nSociologist James Hughes comments that there is considerable confusion between the two terms. In the introduction to their book on post- and transhumanism, Robert Ranisch and Stefan Sorgner address the source of this confusion, stating that posthumanism is often used as an umbrella term that includes both transhumanism and critical posthumanism.\nAlthough both subjects relate to the future of humanity, they differ in their view of anthropocentrism. Pramod Nayar, author of \"Posthumanism\", states that posthumanism has two main branches: ontological and critical. Ontological posthumanism is synonymous with transhumanism. The subject is regarded as \"an intensification of humanism\". Transhumanist thought suggests that humans are not post human yet, but that human enhancement, often through technological advancement and application, is the passage of becoming post human. Transhumanism retains humanism's focus on the Homo sapiens as the center of the world but also considers technology to be an integral aid to human progression. Critical posthumanism, however, is opposed to these views. Critical posthumanism \"rejects both human exceptionalism (the idea that humans are unique creatures) and human instrumentalism (that humans have a right to control the natural world)\". These contrasting views on the importance of human beings are the main distinctions between the two subjects.\nTranshumanism is also more ingrained in popular culture than critical posthumanism, especially in science fiction. The term is referred to by Pramod Nayar as \"the pop posthumanism of cinema and pop culture\".\nInterdisciplinary.\nPosthumanism encompasses a wide variety of branches, including:\nCriticism.\nSome critics have argued that all forms of posthumanism, including transhumanism, have more in common than their respective proponents realize. Linking these different approaches, Paul James suggests that \"the key political problem is that, in effect, the position allows the human as a category of being to flow down the plughole of history\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;This is ontologically critical. Unlike the naming of 'postmodernism' where the 'post' does not infer the end of what it previously meant to be human (just the passing of the dominance of the modern) the posthumanists are playing a serious game where the human, in all its ontological variability, disappears in the name of saving something unspecified about us as merely a motley co-location of individuals and communities.\nHowever, some posthumanists in the humanities and the arts are critical of transhumanism (the brunt of James's criticism), in part, because they argue that it incorporates and extends many of the values of Enlightenment humanism and classical liberalism, namely scientism, according to performance philosopher Shannon Bell:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWhile many modern leaders of thought are accepting of nature of ideologies described by posthumanism, some are more skeptical of the term. Haraway, the author of \"A Cyborg Manifesto\", has outspokenly rejected the term, though acknowledges a philosophical alignment with posthumanism. Haraway opts instead for the term of companion species, referring to nonhuman entities with which humans coexist.\nQuestions of race, some argue, are suspiciously elided within the \"turn\" to posthumanism. Noting that the terms \"post\" and \"human\" are already loaded with racial meaning, critical theorist Zakiyyah Iman Jackson argues that the impulse to move \"beyond\" the human within posthumanism too often ignores \"praxes of humanity and critiques produced by black people\", including Frantz Fanon, Aime Cesaire, Hortense Spillers and Fred Moten. Interrogating the conceptual grounds in which such a mode of \"beyond\" is rendered legible and viable, Jackson argues that it is important to observe that \"blackness conditions and constitutes the very nonhuman disruption and/or disruption\" which posthumanists invite. In other words, given that race in general and blackness in particular constitute the very terms through which human-nonhuman distinctions are made, for example in enduring legacies of scientific racism, a gesture toward a \"beyond\" actually \"returns us to a Eurocentric transcendentalism long challenged\". Posthumanist scholarship, due to characteristic rhetorical techniques, is also frequently subject to the same critiques commonly made of postmodernist scholarship in the 1980s and 1990s.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "25065", "revid": "49129766", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25065", "title": "Parameter", "text": "Variable used for specification\nA parameter (from grc \" ' ()\"\u00a0'beside, subsidiary' and \" ' ()\"\u00a0'measure'), generally, is any characteristic that can help in defining or classifying a particular system (meaning an event, project, object, situation, etc.). That is, a parameter is an element of a system that is useful, or critical, when identifying the system, or when evaluating its performance, status, condition, etc.\n\"Parameter\" has more specific meanings within various disciplines, including mathematics, computer programming, engineering, statistics, logic, linguistics, and electronic musical composition.\nIn addition to its technical uses, there are also extended uses, especially in non-scientific contexts, where it is used to mean defining characteristics or boundaries, as in the phrases 'test parameters' or 'game play parameters'.\nModelization.\nWhen a system is modeled by equations, the values that describe the system are called \"parameters\". For example, in mechanics, the masses, the dimensions and shapes (for solid bodies), the densities and the viscosities (for fluids), appear as parameters in the equations modeling movements. There are often several choices for the parameters, and choosing a convenient set of parameters is called \"parametrization\".\nFor example, if one were considering the movement of an object on the surface of a sphere much larger than the object (e.g. the Earth), there are two commonly used parametrizations of its position: angular coordinates (like latitude/longitude), which neatly describe large movements along circles on the sphere, and directional distance from a known point (e.g. \"10km NNW of Toronto\" or equivalently \"8km due North, and then 6km due West, from Toronto\" ), which are often simpler for movement confined to a (relatively) small area, like within a particular country or region. Such parametrizations are also relevant to the modelization of geographic areas (i.e. map drawing).\nMathematical functions.\nMathematical functions have one or more arguments that are designated in the definition by variables. A function definition can also contain parameters, but unlike variables, parameters are not listed among the arguments that the function takes. When parameters are present, the definition actually defines a whole family of functions, one for every valid set of values of the parameters. For instance, one could define a general quadratic function by declaring\nformula_1;\nHere, the variable \"x\" designates the function's argument, but \"a\", \"b\", and \"c\" are parameters (in this instance, also called \"coefficients\") that determine which particular quadratic function is being considered. A parameter could be incorporated into the function name to indicate its dependence on the parameter. For instance, one may define the base-\"b\" logarithm by the formula\nformula_2\nwhere \"b\" is a parameter that indicates which logarithmic function is being used. It is not an argument of the function, and will, for instance, be a constant when considering the derivative formula_3.\nIn some informal situations it is a matter of convention (or historical accident) whether some or all of the symbols in a function definition are called parameters. However, changing the status of symbols between parameter and variable changes the function as a mathematical object. For instance, the notation for the falling factorial power\nformula_4,\ndefines a polynomial function of \"n\" (when \"k\" is considered a parameter), but is not a polynomial function of \"k\" (when \"n\" is considered a parameter). Indeed, in the latter case, it is only defined for non-negative integer arguments. More formal presentations of such situations typically start out with a function of several variables (including all those that might sometimes be called \"parameters\") such as\nformula_5\nas the most fundamental object being considered, then defining functions with fewer variables from the main one by means of currying.\nSometimes it is useful to consider all functions with certain parameters as \"parametric family\", i.e. as an indexed family of functions. Examples from probability theory are given further below.\nExamples.\nW.M. Woods ... a mathematician ... writes ... \"... a variable is one of the many things a \"parameter\" is not.\" ... The dependent variable, the speed of the car, depends on the independent variable, the position of the gas pedal.\n[Kilpatrick quoting Woods] \"Now ... the engineers ... change the lever arms of the linkage ... the speed of the car ... will still depend on the pedal position ...\" but in a ... different manner\". You have changed a parameter\"\nMathematical models.\nIn the context of a mathematical model, such as a probability distribution, the distinction between variables and parameters was described by Bard as follows:\nWe refer to the relations which supposedly describe a certain physical situation, as a \"model\". Typically, a model consists of one or more equations. The quantities appearing in the equations we classify into \"variables\" and \"parameters\". The distinction between these is not always clear cut, and it frequently depends on the context in which the variables appear. Usually a model is designed to explain the relationships that exist among quantities which can be measured independently in an experiment; these are the variables of the model. To formulate these relationships, however, one frequently introduces \"constants\" which stand for inherent properties of nature (or of the materials and equipment used in a given experiment). These are the parameters.\nAnalytic geometry.\nIn analytic geometry, a curve can be described as the image of a function whose argument, typically called the \"parameter\", lies in a real interval.\nFor example, the unit circle can be specified in the following two ways:\nMathematical analysis.\nIn mathematical analysis, integrals dependent on a parameter are often considered. These are of the form\nformula_10\nIn this formula, \"t\" is the argument of the function \"F\", and on the right-hand side the \"parameter\" on which the integral depends. When evaluating the integral, \"t\" is held constant, and so it is considered to be a parameter. If we are interested in the value of \"F\" for different values of \"t\", we then consider \"t\" to be a variable. The quantity \"x\" is a \"dummy variable\" or \"variable of integration\" (confusingly, also sometimes called a \"parameter of integration\").\nStatistics and econometrics.\nIn statistics and econometrics, the probability framework above still holds, but attention shifts to estimating the parameters of a distribution based on observed data, or testing hypotheses about them. In frequentist estimation parameters are considered \"fixed but unknown\", whereas in Bayesian estimation they are treated as random variables, and their uncertainty is described as a distribution.\nIn estimation theory of statistics, \"statistic\" or estimator refers to samples, whereas \"parameter\" or estimand refers to populations, where the samples are taken from. A statistic is a numerical characteristic of a sample that can be used as an estimate of the corresponding parameter, the numerical characteristic of the population from which the sample was drawn.\nFor example, the sample mean (estimator), denoted formula_11, can be used as an estimate of the \"mean\" parameter (estimand), denoted \"\u03bc\", of the population from which the sample was drawn. Similarly, the sample variance (estimator), denoted \"S\"2, can be used to estimate the \"variance\" parameter (estimand), denoted \"\u03c3\"2, of the population from which the sample was drawn. (Note that the sample standard deviation (\"S\") is not an unbiased estimate of the population standard deviation (\"\u03c3\"): see Unbiased estimation of standard deviation.)\nIt is possible to make statistical inferences without assuming a particular parametric family of probability distributions. In that case, one speaks of \"non-parametric statistics\" as opposed to the parametric statistics just described. For example, a test based on Spearman's rank correlation coefficient would be called non-parametric since the statistic is computed from the rank-order of the data disregarding their actual values (and thus regardless of the distribution they were sampled from), whereas those based on the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient are parametric tests since it is computed directly from the data values and thus estimates the parameter known as the population correlation.\nProbability theory.\nIn probability theory, one may describe the distribution of a random variable as belonging to a \"family\" of probability distributions, distinguished from each other by the values of a finite number of \"parameters\". For example, one talks about \"a Poisson distribution with mean value \u03bb\". The function defining the distribution (the probability mass function) is:\nformula_12\nThis example nicely illustrates the distinction between constants, parameters, and variables. \"e\" is Euler's number, a fundamental mathematical constant. The parameter \u03bb is the mean number of observations of some phenomenon in question, a property characteristic of the system. \"k\" is a variable, in this case the number of occurrences of the phenomenon actually observed from a particular sample. If we want to know the probability of observing \"k\"1 occurrences, we plug it into the function to get formula_13. Without altering the system, we can take multiple samples, which will have a range of values of \"k\", but the system is always characterized by the same \u03bb.\nFor instance, suppose we have a radioactive sample that emits, on average, five particles every ten minutes. We take measurements of how many particles the sample emits over ten-minute periods. The measurements exhibit different values of \"k\", and if the sample behaves according to Poisson statistics, then each value of \"k\" will come up in a proportion given by the probability mass function above. From measurement to measurement, however, \u03bb remains constant at 5. If we do not alter the system, then the parameter \u03bb is unchanged from measurement to measurement; if, on the other hand, we modulate the system by replacing the sample with a more radioactive one, then the parameter \u03bb would increase.\nAnother common distribution is the normal distribution, which has as parameters the mean \u03bc and the variance \u03c3\u00b2.\nIn these above examples, the distributions of the random variables are completely specified by the type of distribution, i.e. Poisson or normal, and the parameter values, i.e. mean and variance. In such a case, we have a parameterized distribution.\nIt is possible to use the sequence of moments (mean, mean square, ...) or cumulants (mean, variance, ...) as parameters for a probability distribution: see Statistical parameter.\nComputer programming.\nIn computer programming, two notions of parameter are commonly used, and are referred to as parameters and arguments\u2014or more formally as a formal parameter and an actual parameter.\nFor example, in the definition of a function such as\n y = \"f\"(\"x\") = \"x\" + 2,\n\"x\" is the \"formal parameter\" (the \"parameter\") of the defined function.\nWhen the function is evaluated for a given value, as in\n\"f\"(3): or, \"y\" = \"f\"(3) = 3 + 2 = 5,\n3 is the \"actual parameter\" (the \"argument\") for evaluation by the defined function; it is a given value (actual value) that is substituted for the \"formal parameter\" of the defined function. (In casual usage the terms \"parameter\" and \"argument\" might inadvertently be interchanged, and thereby used incorrectly.)\nThese concepts are discussed in a more precise way in functional programming and its foundational disciplines, lambda calculus and combinatory logic. Terminology varies between languages; some computer languages such as C define parameter and argument as given here, while Eiffel uses an alternative convention.\nArtificial intelligence.\nIn artificial intelligence, a model describes the probability that something will occur. Parameters in a model are the weight of the various probabilities. Tiernan Ray, in an article on GPT-3, described parameters this way: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;A parameter is a calculation in a neural network that applies a great or lesser weighting to some aspect of the data, to give that aspect greater or lesser prominence in the overall calculation of the data. It is these weights that give shape to the data, and give the neural network a learned perspective on the data.\nEngineering.\nIn engineering (especially involving data acquisition) the term \"parameter\" sometimes loosely refers to an individual measured item. This usage is not consistent, as sometimes the term \"channel\" refers to an individual measured item, with \"parameter\" referring to the setup information about that channel.\n\"Speaking generally, properties are those physical quantities which directly describe the physical attributes of the system; parameters are those combinations of the properties which suffice to determine the response of the system. Properties can have all sorts of dimensions, depending upon the system being considered; parameters are dimensionless, or have the dimension of time or its reciprocal.\"\nThe term can also be used in engineering contexts, however, as it is typically used in the physical sciences.\nEnvironmental science.\nIn environmental science and particularly in chemistry and microbiology, a parameter is used to describe a discrete chemical or microbiological entity that can be assigned a value: commonly a concentration, but may also be a logical entity (present or absent), a statistical result such as a 95 percentile value or in some cases a subjective value.\nLinguistics.\nWithin linguistics, the word \"parameter\" is almost exclusively used to denote a binary switch in a Universal Grammar within a Principles and Parameters framework.\nLogic.\nIn logic, the parameters passed to (or operated on by) an \"open predicate\" are called \"parameters\" by some authors (e.g., Prawitz's \"Natural Deduction\"; Paulson's \"Designing a theorem prover\"). Parameters locally defined within the predicate are called \"variables\". This extra distinction pays off when defining substitution (without this distinction special provision must be made to avoid variable capture). Others (maybe most) just call parameters passed to (or operated on by) an open predicate \"variables\", and when defining substitution have to distinguish between \"free variables\" and \"bound variables\".\nMusic.\nIn music theory, a parameter denotes an element which may be manipulated (composed), separately from the other elements. The term is used particularly for pitch, loudness, duration, and timbre, though theorists or composers have sometimes considered other musical aspects as parameters. The term is particularly used in serial music, where each parameter may follow some specified series. Paul Lansky and George Perle criticized the extension of the word \"parameter\" to this sense, since it is not closely related to its mathematical sense, but it remains common. The term is also common in music production, as the functions of audio processing units (such as the attack, release, ratio, threshold, and other variables on a compressor) are defined by parameters specific to the type of unit (compressor, equalizer, delay, etc.).\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was called the \"Flying Finn\" because he dominated distance running in the 1920s. Nurmi set 22 official world records at distances between 1,500 metres and 20\u00a0kilometres, and won nine gold and three silver medals in his 12 events in the Summer Olympic Games. At his peak, Nurmi was undefeated for 121 races at distances from 800 m upwards. Throughout his 14-year career, he remained unbeaten in cross country events and the 10,000 metres.\nBorn into a working-class family, Nurmi left school at the age of 12 to provide for his family. In 1912, he was inspired by the Olympic feats of Hannes Kolehmainen and began developing a strict training program. Nurmi started to flourish during his military service, setting Finnish records in athletics en route to his international debut at the 1920 Summer Olympics. After winning a silver medal in the 5,000 m, he won gold in the 10,000 m and the cross country events. In 1923, Nurmi became the first runner to hold simultaneous world records in the mile, the 5,000 m and the 10,000 m races, a feat which has never been repeated. He set new world records for the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m with just an hour between the races, and took gold medals in both distances in less than two hours at the 1924 Summer Olympics. Seemingly unaffected by the Paris heat wave, Nurmi won all his races and returned home with five gold medals, although he was frustrated that Finnish officials had refused to enter him for the 10,000 m.\nStruggling with injuries and motivation issues after his exhaustive U.S. tour in 1925, Nurmi found his long-time rivals compatriot Ville Ritola and Sweden's Edvin Wide ever more serious challengers. At the 1928 Summer Olympics, Nurmi recaptured the 10,000 m title but was beaten for the gold in the 5,000 m and the 3,000 m steeplechase. He then turned his attention to longer distances, breaking the world records for events such as the one hour run and the 25-mile marathon. Nurmi intended to end his career with a marathon gold medal, as his idol Kolehmainen had done. In a controversial case that strained Finland\u2013Sweden relations and sparked an inter-IAAF battle, Nurmi was suspended before the 1932 Games by an IAAF council that questioned his amateur status; two days before the opening ceremonies, the council rejected his entries. Although he was never declared a professional, Nurmi's suspension became definite in 1934 and he retired from running.\nNurmi later coached Finnish runners, raised funds for Finland during the Winter War, and worked as a haberdasher, building contractor, and stock trader, becoming one of the richest people in Finland. In 1952, he was the lighter of the Olympic Flame at the Summer Olympics in Helsinki. Nurmi's running speed and elusive personality spawned nicknames such as the \"Phantom Finn\", while his achievements, training methods and running style influenced future generations of middle- and long-distance runners. Nurmi, who rarely ran without a stopwatch in his hand, has been credited with introducing the \"even pace\" strategy and analytic approach to running, and for making running a major international sport.\nEarly life.\nNurmi was born in Turku, Finland, to carpenter Johan Fredrik Nurmi and his wife Matilda Wilhelmiina Laine. Nurmi's siblings, Siiri, Saara, Martti and Lahja, were born in 1898, 1902, 1905 and 1908, respectively. In 1903, the Nurmi family moved from Raunistula into a 40-square-meter apartment in central Turku, where Paavo Nurmi would live until 1932. The young Nurmi and his friends were inspired by the English long-distance runner Alfred Shrubb. They regularly ran or walked six kilometres (four miles) to swim in Ruissalo, and back, sometimes twice a day. By the age of eleven, Nurmi ran the 1500 metres in 5:02. Nurmi's father Johan died in 1910 and his sister Lahja a year later. The family struggled financially, renting out their kitchen to another family and living in a single room. Nurmi, a talented student, left school to work as an errand boy for a bakery. Although he stopped running actively, he got plenty of exercise pushing heavy carts up the steep slopes in Turku. He later credited these climbs for strengthening his back and leg muscles.\nAt 15, Nurmi rekindled his interest in athletics after being inspired by the performances of Hannes Kolehmainen, who was said to \"have run Finland onto the map of the world\" at the 1912 Summer Olympics. He bought his first pair of sneakers a few days later. Nurmi trained primarily by doing cross country running in the summers and cross country skiing in the winters. In 1914, Nurmi joined the sports club Turun Urheiluliitto and won his first race on the 3000 metres. Two years later, he revised his training program to include walking, sprints and calisthenics. He continued to provide for his family through his new job at the Ab. H. Ahlberg &amp; Co workshop in Turku, where he worked until he started his military service at a machine gun company in the Pori Brigade in April 1919. During the Finnish Civil War in 1918, Nurmi remained politically passive and concentrated on his work and his Olympic ambitions. After the war, he decided not to join the newly founded Finnish Workers' Sports Federation, but wrote articles for the federation's chief organ and criticized the discrimination against many of his fellow workers and athletes.\nIn the army, Nurmi quickly impressed in the athletic competitions: While others marched, Nurmi ran the whole distances with a rifle on his shoulder and a backpack full of sand. Nurmi's stubbornness caused him difficulties with his non-commissioned officers, but he was favoured by the superior officers, despite his refusal to take the military oath even at the threat of a court-martial. As the unit commander Hugo \u00d6sterman was a known sports aficionado, Nurmi and a few other athletes were given free time to practice. Nurmi improvised new training methods in the army barracks; he ran behind trains, holding on to the rear bumper, to stretch his stride, and used heavy iron-clad army boots to strengthen his legs. Nurmi soon began setting personal bests and got close for the Olympic selection. In March 1920, he was promoted to corporal (\"alikersantti\"). On 29 May 1920, he set his first national record in 3,000 m and went on to win the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m at the Olympic trials in July.\nOlympic career.\n1920\u20131924 Olympics.\nNurmi made his international debut in August at the 1920 Summer Olympics in Antwerp, Belgium. He took his first medal by finishing second to Frenchman Joseph Guillemot in the 5000 m. This would remain the only time that Nurmi lost to a non-Finnish runner in the Olympics. He went on to win gold medals in his other three events: the 10,000 m, sprinting past Guillemot on the final curve and improving his personal best by over a minute, the cross country race, beating Sweden's Eric Backman, and the cross country team event where he helped Heikki Liimatainen and Teodor Koskenniemi defeat the British and Swedish teams. Nurmi's success brought electric lighting and running water for his family in Turku. Nurmi, however, was given a scholarship to study at the Teollisuuskoulu industrial school in Helsinki.\nBuoyed by his defeat to Guillemot, Nurmi's races became a series of experiments which he analyzed meticulously. Previously known for his blistering pace on the first few laps, Nurmi started to carry a stopwatch and spread his efforts more uniformly over the distance. He aimed to perfect his technique and tactics to a point where the performances of his rivals would be rendered meaningless. Nurmi set his first world record on the 10,000 m in Stockholm in 1921. In 1922, he broke the world records for the 2000 m, the 3000 m and the 5000 m. A year later, Nurmi added the records for the 1500 m and the mile. His feat of holding the world records for the mile, the 5000 m and the 10,000 m at the same time has not been matched by any other athlete before or since. Nurmi also tested his speed in the 800 m, winning the 1923 Finnish Championships with a new national record. After excelling in mathematics, Nurmi graduated as an engineer in 1923 and returned home to prepare for the upcoming Olympic Games.\nNurmi's trip to the 1924 Summer Olympics was endangered by a knee injury in the spring of 1924, but he recovered and resumed training twice a day. On 19 June, Nurmi tried out the 1924 Olympic schedule at the El\u00e4intarha Stadium in Helsinki by running the 1500 m and the 5000 m inside an hour, setting new world records for both distances. In the 1500 m final at the Olympics in Paris, Nurmi ran the first 800 m almost three seconds faster. His only challenger, Ray Watson of the United States, gave up before the last lap and Nurmi was able to slow down and coast to victory ahead of Willy Sch\u00e4rer, H. B. Stallard and Douglas Lowe, still breaking the Olympic record by three seconds. The 5000 m final started in less than two hours, and Nurmi faced a tough challenge from countryman Ville Ritola, who had already won the 3000 m steeplechase and the 10,000 m. Ritola and Edvin Wide figured that Nurmi must be tired and tried to burn him off by running at world-record pace. Realizing that he was now racing the two men and not the clock, Nurmi tossed his stopwatch onto the grass. The Finns later passed the Swede as his pace faded and continued their duel. On the home straight, Ritola sprinted from the outside but Nurmi increased his pace to keep his rival a metre behind.\nIn the cross country events, the heat of , caused all but 15 of the 38 competitors to abandon the race. Eight finishers were taken away on stretchers. One athlete began to run in tiny circles after reaching the stadium, until setting off into the stands and knocking himself unconscious. Early leader Wide was among those who blacked out along the course, and was incorrectly reported to have died at the hospital. Nurmi exhibited only slight signs of exhaustion after beating Ritola to the win by nearly a minute and a half. As Finland looked to have lost the team medal, the disoriented Liimatainen staggered into the stadium, but was barely moving forward. An athlete ahead of him fainted 50 metres from the finish, and Liimatainen stopped and tried to find his way off the track, thinking he had reached the finish line. After having ignored shouts and kept the spectators in suspense for a while, he turned into the right direction, realised his situation and reached the finish in 12th place and secured team gold. Those present at the stadium were shocked by what they had witnessed, and Olympic officials decided to ban cross country running from future Games.\nIn the 3000 m team race on the next day, Nurmi and Ritola again finished first and second, and Elias Katz secured the gold medal for the Finnish team by finishing fifth. Nurmi had won five gold medals in five events, but he left the Games embittered as the Finnish officials had allocated races between their star runners and prevented him from defending his title in the 10,000 m, the distance that was dearest to him. After returning to Finland, Nurmi set a 10,000 m world record that would last for almost 13\u00a0years. As of July 2024, this is the second-longest-standing world record for the men's\u00a010,000\u00a0metres. Kenenia Bekele's world record set in August\u00a02005 in Brussels stood for over 15\u00a0years. Nurmi now held the 1500\u00a0metres, the mile, the 3,000\u00a0metres, the 5,000\u00a0metres and the 10,000\u00a0metres world records simultaneously.\nU.S. tour and 1928 Olympics.\nIn early 1925, Nurmi embarked on a widely publicised tour of the United States. He competed in 55 events (45 indoors) during a five-month period, starting at a sold-out Madison Square Garden on 6 January. His debut was a copy of his feats in Helsinki and Paris. Nurmi defeated Joie Ray and Lloyd Hahn to win the mile and Ritola to win the 5000 m, again setting new world records for both distances. Nurmi broke ten more indoor world records in regular events and set several new best times for rarer distances. He won 51 of the events, abandoned one race and lost two handicap races along with his final event; a half-mile race at the Yankee Stadium, where he finished second to American track star Alan Helffrich. Helffrich's victory ended Nurmi's 121-race, four-year win streak in individual scratch races at distances from 800 m upwards. Although he hated losing more than anything, Nurmi was the first to congratulate Helffrich. The tour made Nurmi extremely popular in the United States, and the Finn agreed to meet President Calvin Coolidge at the White House. Nurmi left America fearing that he had competed too often and burned himself out.\nNurmi struggled to maintain motivation for running, heightened by his rheumatism and Achilles tendon problems. He quit his job as a machinery draughtsman in 1926 and began studying business intensively. As Nurmi started a new career as a share dealer, his financial advisors included Risto Ryti, director of the Bank of Finland. In 1926, Nurmi broke Wide's world record for the 3000 m in Berlin and then improved the record in Stockholm, despite Nils Ekl\u00f6f repeatedly trying to slow his pace down in an effort to aid Wide. Nurmi was furious at the Swedes and vowed never to race Ekl\u00f6f again. In October 1926, he lost a 1500 m race along with his world record to Germany's Otto Peltzer. This marked the first time in over five years and 133 races that Nurmi had been defeated at a distance over 1000 m. In 1927, Finnish officials barred him from international competition for refusing to run against Ekl\u00f6f at the Finland-Sweden international, cancelling the Peltzer rematch scheduled for Vienna. Nurmi ended his season and threatened, until late November, to withdraw from the 1928 Summer Olympics. At the 1928 Olympic trials, Nurmi was left third in the 1500 m by eventual gold and bronze medalists Harri Larva and Eino Purje, and he decided to concentrate on the longer distances. He added steeplechase to his program, although he had only tried the event twice before, the latest being a two-mile steeplechase victory at the 1922 British Championships.\nAt the 1928 Olympics in Amsterdam, Nurmi competed in three events. He won the 10,000 m by staying right behind Ritola until sprinting past him on the home straight. Before the 5000 m final, Nurmi injured himself in his qualifying heat for the 3000 m steeplechase. He fell on his back at the water jump, spraining his hip and foot. Lucien Duquesne stopped to help him up, and Nurmi thanked the Frenchman by pacing him past the field and offered him the heat win, which Duquesne gracefully refused. In the 5000 m, Nurmi tried to repeat his move on Ritola but had to watch his teammate pull away instead. Nurmi, looking more exhausted than ever before, only barely managed to keep Wide behind and take silver. Nurmi had little time to rest or nurse his injuries as the 3000 m steeplechase started the next day. Struggling with the hurdles, Nurmi let Finland's steeplechase specialist Toivo Loukola escape into the distance. On the final lap, he sprinted clear of the others and finished nine seconds behind the world-record setting Loukola; Nurmi's time also bettered the previous record. Although Ritola did not finish, Ove Andersen completed a Finnish sweep of the medals.\nMove to longer distances.\nNurmi stated to a Swedish newspaper that \"this is absolutely my last season on the track. I am beginning to get old. I have raced for fifteen years and have had enough of it.\" However, Nurmi continued running, turning his attention to longer distances. In October, he broke the world records for the 15\u00a0km, the 10 miles and the one hour run in Berlin. Nurmi's one-hour record stood for 17 years, until Viljo Heino ran 129 metres further in 1945. In January 1929, Nurmi started his second U.S. tour from Brooklyn. He suffered his first-ever defeat in the mile to Ray Conger at the indoor Wanamaker Mile. Nurmi was seven seconds slower than in his world record run in 1925, and it was immediately speculated if the mile had become too short a distance for him. In 1930, he set a new world record for the 20\u00a0km. In July 1931, Nurmi showed he still had pace for the shorter distances by beating Lauri Lehtinen, Lauri Virtanen and Volmari Iso-Hollo, and breaking the world record on the now-rare two miles. He was the first runner to complete the distance in less than nine minutes. Nurmi planned to compete only in the 10,000 m and the marathon in the 1932 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, stating that he \"won't enter the 5000 metres for Finland has at least three excellent men for that event.\"\nIn April 1932, the executive council of the International Amateur Athletics Federation (IAAF) suspended Nurmi from international athletics events pending an investigation into his amateur status by the Finnish Athletics Federation. The Finnish authorities criticized the IAAF for acting without a hearing, but agreed to launch an investigation. It was customary of the IAAF to accept the final decision of its national branch, and the Associated Press wrote that \"there is little doubt that if the Finnish federation clears Nurmi the international body will accept its decision without question.\" A week later, the Finnish Athletics Federation ruled in favor of Nurmi, finding no evidence for the allegations of professionalism. Nurmi was hopeful that his suspension would be lifted in time for the Games.\nOn 26 June 1932 Nurmi started his first marathon at the Olympic trials. Not drinking a drop of liquid, he ran the old-style 'short marathon' of in 2:22:03.8 \u2013 on the pace to finish in about 2:29:00, just under Albert Michelsen's marathon world record of 2:29:01.8. At the time, he led Armas Toivonen, the eventual Olympic bronze medalist, by six minutes. Nurmi's time was the new unofficial world record for the short marathon. Confident that he had done enough, Nurmi stopped and retired from the race owing to problems with his Achilles tendon. The Finnish Olympic Committee entered Nurmi for both the 10,000 m and the marathon. \"The Guardian\" reported that \"some of his trial times were almost unbelievable,\" and Nurmi went on to train at the Olympic Village in Los Angeles despite his injury. Nurmi had set his heart on ending his career with a marathon gold medal, as Kolehmainen had done shortly after the First World War.\n1932 Olympics and later career.\nLess than three days before the 10,000 m, a special commission of the IAAF, consisting of the same seven members that had suspended Nurmi, rejected the Finn's entries and barred him from competing in Los Angeles. Sigfrid Edstr\u00f6m, the Swedish chairman of the Council of the International Association of Athletics Federations (s.o. the board of directors), pushed independently and without receiving the support of the rules of the International Association of Athletics Federations for a decision to ban Nurmi from participating in the Los Angeles Olympics at the IAAF board meeting without consulting the Finnish Sports Federation (SUL) and Nurmi on 3.4. and 30 July 1932. [The rules for disqualification of an athlete were made only after the Olympics at the Congress (General Assembly) of the International Sports Federation (IAAF), where Edstr\u00f6m and Bo Ekelund, secretary of the council, represented Sweden. The report for Nurmi's ban came from Avery Brundage, president of the American Sports Federation.]\nEdstr\u00f6m stated that the full congress of the IAAF, which was scheduled to start the next day, could not reinstate Nurmi for the Olympics but merely review the phases and political angles related to the case. The AP called this \"one of the slickest political maneuvers in international athletic history\", and wrote that the Games would now be \"like Hamlet without the celebrated Dane in the cast.\" Thousands protested against the action in Helsinki. Details of the case were not released to the press, but the evidence against Nurmi was believed be the sworn statements from German race promoters that Nurmi had received $250\u2013500 per race when running in Germany in autumn 1931. The statements were produced by Karl Ritter von Halt, after Edstr\u00f6m had sent him increasingly threatening letters warning that if evidence against Nurmi were not provided he would be \"unfortunately obliged to take stringent action against the German Athletics Association.\" The IOC did not follow their own rules for disqualification for not being a non-amateur Olympic participant. The rulebook for the 1912\u00a0Olympics stated that protests had to be made \"within 30\u00a0days from the closing ceremonies of the games.\"\nOn the eve of the marathon, all the entrants of the race except for the Finns, whose positions were known, filed a petition asking Nurmi's entry to be accepted. Edstr\u00f6m's right-hand man Bo Ekelund, secretary general of the IAAF and head of the Swedish Athletics Federation, approached the Finnish officials and stated that he might be able to arrange for Nurmi to participate in the marathon outside the competition. However, Finland maintained that as long as the athlete is not declared a professional, he must have the right to participate in the race officially. Although he had been diagnosed with a pulled Achilles tendon two weeks earlier, Nurmi stated he would have won the event by five minutes. The congress concluded without Nurmi being declared a professional, but the council's authority to disbar an athlete was upheld on a 13\u201312 vote. However, due to the close vote, the matter was postponed until the 1934 meet in Stockholm. Finns charged that the Swedish officials had used devious tricks in their campaign against Nurmi's amateur status, and ceased all athletic relations with Sweden. A year earlier, controversies on the track and in the press had led Finland to withdraw from the Finland-Sweden athletics international. After Nurmi's suspension, Finland did not agree to return to the event until 1939.\nNurmi refused to turn professional, and continued running as an amateur in Finland. In 1933, he ran his first 1500 m in three years and won the national title with his best time since 1926. At the IAAF meet in August 1934, Finland launched two proposals that lost. The council then brought forward its resolution empowering it to suspend athletes that it finds in violation of the IAAF amateur code. With a 12\u20135 vote, with many not voting, Nurmi's suspension from international amateur athletics became definite. Less than three weeks later, Nurmi retired from running with a 10,000 m victory in Viipuri on 16 September 1934. Nurmi remained undefeated in the distance throughout his 14-year top-level career. In cross country running, his win streak lasted 19 years.\nLater life.\nWhile active as a runner, Nurmi was known to be secretive about his training methods. Always running alone, he upped his pace and quickly exhausted anyone who was bold enough to join him. Even his club mate Harri Larva had learned little from him. After ending his career, Nurmi became a coach for the Finnish Athletics Federation and trained runners for the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin. In 1935, Nurmi along with the entire board of directors quit the federation after a heated 40\u201338 vote to resume athletic relations with Sweden. However, Nurmi returned to coaching three months later and the Finnish distance runners went on to take three gold medals, three silvers and a bronze at the Games. In 1936, Nurmi also opened a men's clothing store (haberdashery) in Helsinki. It became a popular tourist attraction, and Emil Z\u00e1topek was among those who visited the store trying to meet Nurmi. The Finn spent his time in the back room, running another new business venture; construction. As a contractor, Nurmi built forty apartment buildings in Helsinki with about a hundred flats in each. Within five years, he was rated a millionaire. His fiercest rival Ritola ended up living in one of Nurmi's flats, at half price. Nurmi also made money on the stock market, eventually becoming one of Finland's richest people.\nIn February 1940, during the Winter War between Finland and the Soviet Union, Nurmi returned to the United States with his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Taisto M\u00e4ki, who had become the first man to run the 10,000 m under 30 minutes, to raise funds and rally support to the Finnish cause. The relief drive, directed by former president Herbert Hoover, included a coast-to-coast tour by Nurmi and M\u00e4ki. Hoover welcomed the two as \"ambassadors of the greatest sporting nation in the world.\" While in San Francisco, Nurmi received news that one of his apprentices, 1936 Olympic champion Gunnar H\u00f6ckert, had been killed in action. Nurmi left for Finland in late April, and later served in the Continuation War in a delivery company and as a trainer in the military staff. Before he was discharged in January 1942, Nurmi was promoted first to a staff sergeant (\"ylikersantti\") and later to a sergeant first class (\"v\u00e4\u00e4peli\").\nIn 1952, Nurmi was persuaded by Urho Kekkonen, Prime Minister of Finland and former chairman of the Finnish Athletics Federation, to carry the Olympic torch into the Olympic Stadium at the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki. His appearance astonished the spectators, and \"Sports Illustrated\" wrote that \"his celebrated stride was unmistakable to the crowd. When he came into view, waves of sound began to build throughout the stadium, rising to a roar, then to a thunder. When the national teams, assembled in formation on the infield, saw the flowing figure of Nurmi, they broke ranks like excited schoolchildren, dashing toward the edge of the track.\" After lighting the flame in the Olympic Cauldron, Nurmi passed the torch to his idol Kolehmainen, who lighted the beacon in the tower. In the cancelled 1940 Summer Olympics, Nurmi had been planned to lead a group of fifty Finnish gold medal winners.\nNurmi felt that he got too much credit as an athlete and too little as a businessman, but his interest in running never died. He even returned to the track himself a few times. In 1946, he faced his old rival Edvin Wide in Stockholm in a benefit for the victims of the Greek Civil War. Nurmi ran for the last time on 18 February 1966 at the Madison Square Garden, invited by the New York Athletic Club. In 1962, Nurmi predicted that wealthier countries would start to struggle in the distance events: \"The higher the standard of living in a country, the weaker the results often are in the events which call for work and trouble. I would like to warn this new generation: 'Do not let this comfortable life make you lazy. Do not let the new means of transport kill your instinct for physical exercise. Too many young people get used to driving in a car even for small distances.'\" In 1966, he took the microphone in front of 300 sports club guests and criticised the state of distance running in Finland, reproaching the sports executives as publicity seekers and tourists, and demanding athletes sacrifice everything to accomplish something. Nurmi lived to see the renaissance of Finnish running in the 1970s, led by athletes such as the 1972 Olympic gold medalists Lasse Vir\u00e9n and Pekka Vasala. He had complimented the running style of Vir\u00e9n, and advised Vasala to concentrate on Kipchoge Keino.\nAlthough he accepted an invitation from President Lyndon B. Johnson to revisit the White House in 1964, Nurmi lived a very secluded life until the late 1960s when he began granting some press interviews. On his 70th birthday, Nurmi agreed to an interview for Yle, Finland's national public-broadcasting company, only after learning that President Kekkonen would act as the interviewer. Suffering from health problems, with at least one heart attack, a stroke and failing eyesight, Nurmi at times spoke bitterly about sports, calling it a waste of time compared to science and art. He died in 1973 in Helsinki and was given a state funeral. Kekkonen attended the funeral and praised Nurmi: \"People explore the horizons for a successor. But none comes and none will, for his class is extinguished with him.\" At the request of Nurmi, who enjoyed classical music and played the violin, Konsta Jylh\u00e4's \"Vaiennut viulu\" (\"The Silenced Violin\") was played during the ceremony. Nurmi's last record fell in 1996; his 1925 world record for the indoor 2000 m lasted as the Finnish national record for 71 years.\nPersonal life and public image.\nNurmi was married to socialite Sylvi Laaksonen (1907\u20131968) from 1932 to 1935. Laaksonen, who was not interested in athletics, opposed Nurmi raising their newborn son Matti to be a runner and stated to the Associated Press in 1933, \"[H]is concentration on athletics at last forced me to go to the judge for a divorce.\" Matti Nurmi did become a middle-distance runner, and later a \"self-made\" businessman. Nurmi's relationship with his son was termed \"uneasy\". Matti admired his father more as a businessman than as an athlete, and the two never discussed his running career. As a runner, Matti was at his best in the 3000 m, where he equalled his father's time. In the famous race on 11 July 1957 when the \"three Olavis\" (Salsola, Salonen and Vuorisalo) broke the world record for the 1500 m, Matti Nurmi finished a distant ninth with his personal best, 2.2 seconds slower than his father's world record from 1924. Hollywood actress Maila Nurmi, best known as the horror icon \"Vampira\", was often referred to as Paavo Nurmi's niece. However, the kinship is not supported by official documents.\nNurmi enjoyed the Finnish sports massage and sauna-bathing traditions, crediting the Finnish sauna for his performances during the Paris heat wave in 1924. He had a versatile diet, although he had practiced vegetarianism between the ages of 15 and 21. Nurmi, who identified as neurasthenic, was known to be \"taciturn\", \"stony-faced\" and \"stubborn\". He was not believed to have had any close friends, but he had occasionally socialized and showed his \"sarcastic sense of humour\" among the small circles he knew. Acclaimed the biggest sporting figure in the world at his peak, Nurmi was averse to publicity and the media, stating later on his 75th birthday, \"[W]orldly fame and reputation are worth less than a rotten lingonberry.\" French journalist Gabriel Hanot questioned Nurmi's intensive approach to sports and wrote in 1924 that Nurmi \"is ever more serious, reserved, concentrated, pessimistic, fanatic. There is such coldness in him and his self-control is so great that never for a moment does he show his feelings.\" Some contemporary Finns nicknamed him \"Suuri vaikenija\" (The Great Silent One), and Ron Clarke noted that Nurmi's persona remained a mystery even to Finnish runners and journalists: \"Even to them, he was never quite real. He was enigmatic, sphinx-like, a god in a cloud. It was as if he was all the time playing a role in a drama.\"\nNurmi was more responsive to his fellow athletes than to the media. He exchanged ideas with sprinter Charley Paddock and even trained with his rival Otto Peltzer. Nurmi told Peltzer to forget his opponents: \"Conquering yourself is the greatest challenge of an athlete.\" Nurmi was known to emphasize the importance of psychological strength: \"Mind is everything; muscle, pieces of rubber. All that I am, I am because of my mind.\" Regarding Nurmi's conduct on track, Peltzer found that \"in his impenetrability he was a Buddha gliding on the track. Stopwatch in hand, lap after lap, he ran towards the tape, subject only to the laws of a mathematical table.\" Marathoner Johnny Kelley, who first met his idol at the 1936 Olympics, said that while Nurmi appeared cold to him at first, the two chatted for quite a while after Nurmi had asked for his name: \"He grabbed ahold of me\u00a0\u2014 he was so excited. I couldn't believe it!\"\nNurmi's speed and elusive personality led to nicknames such as the \"Phantom Finn\", the \"King of Runners\" and \"Peerless Paavo\", while his mathematical prowess and use of a stopwatch led the press to characterize him as a running machine. One newspaperman dubbed Nurmi \"a mechanical Frankenstein created to annihilate time.\" Phil Cousineau noted that \"his own innovation\u2014the tactic of pacing himself with a stopwatch\u2014both inspired and troubled people in an era when the robot was becoming symbolic of the modern soulless human being.\" Among the popular newspaper rumours about Nurmi was that he had a \"freakish heart\" with a very low pulse rate. During the debate over his amateur status, Nurmi was joked to have \"the lowest heartbeat and the highest asking price of any athlete in the world.\"\nLegacy.\nNurmi broke 22 official world records on distances between 1500 m and 20\u00a0km; a record in running. He also set many more unofficial ones for a total of 58. His indoor world records were all unofficial as the IAAF did not ratify indoor records until the 1980s. Nurmi's record for most Olympic gold medals was matched by gymnast Larisa Latynina in 1964, swimmer Mark Spitz in 1972 and fellow track and field athlete Carl Lewis in 1996, and broken by swimmer Michael Phelps in 2008. Nurmi's record for most medals in the Olympic Games stood until Edoardo Mangiarotti won his 13th medal in fencing in 1960. \"Time\" selected Nurmi as the greatest Olympian of all time in 1996, and IAAF named him among the first twelve athletes to be inducted into the IAAF Hall of Fame in 2012.\nNurmi introduced the \"even pace\" strategy to running, pacing himself with a stopwatch and spreading his energy uniformly over the race. He reasoned that \"when you race against time, you don't have to sprint. Others can't hold the pace if it is steady and hard all through to the tape.\" Archie Macpherson stated that \"with the stopwatch always in his hand, he elevated athletics to a new plane of intelligent application of effort and was the harbinger of the modern scientifically prepared athlete.\" Nurmi was considered a pioneer also in regards to training; he developed a systematic all-year-round training program that included both long-distance work and interval running. Peter Lovesey wrote in \"The Kings of Distance: A Study of Five Great Runners\" that Nurmi \"accelerated the progress of world records; developed and actually came to personify the analytic approach to running; and he was a profound influence not only in Finland, but throughout the world of athletics. Nurmi, his style, technique and tactics were held to be infallible, and really seemed so, as successive imitators in Finland steadily improved the records.\" Cordner Nelson, founder of \"Track &amp; Field News\", credited Nurmi for popularizing running as a spectator sport: \"His imprint on the track world was greater than any man\u2019s before or after. He, more than any man, raised track to the glory of a major sport in the eyes of international fans, and they honored him as one of the truly great athletes of all sports.\"\nNurmi's achievements and training methods inspired future generations of track stars. Emil Z\u00e1topek chanted \"I am Nurmi! I am Nurmi!\" when he trained as a child, and based his training system on what he was able to find out about Nurmi's methods. Lasse Vir\u00e9n idolized Nurmi and was scheduled to meet him for the first time on the day that Nurmi died. Hicham El Guerrouj was inspired to become a runner so that he could \"repeat the achievements of the great man of whom his grandfather spoke.\" He became the first man after Nurmi to win the 1500 m and the 5000 m at the same Games. Nurmi's influence stretched further than running on the Olympic arena. At the 1928 Olympics, Kazimierz Wierzy\u0144ski won the lyric gold medal with his poem \"Olympic Laurel\" that included a verse on Nurmi. In 1936, Ludwig Stubbendorf and his horse \"Nurmi\" won the individual and team gold medals in eventing.\nA bronze statue of Nurmi was sculpted by W\u00e4in\u00f6 Aaltonen in 1925. The original is held at the art museum Ateneum, but copies cast from the original mould exist in Turku, in Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4, in front of the Helsinki Olympic Stadium and at the Olympic Museum in Lausanne, Switzerland. In a widely publicized prank by students of the Helsinki University of Technology, a miniature copy of the statue was discovered in the 300-year-old wreck of the Swedish war ship \"Vasa\" when it was lifted from the bottom of the sea in 1961. Statues of Nurmi were also sculpted by Ren\u00e9e Sintenis in 1926 and by Carl Eldh, whose 1937 work \"L\u00f6pare\" (\"Runners\") depicts a battle between Nurmi and Edvin Wide. \"Boken om Nurmi\" (\"The Book about Nurmi\"), released in Sweden in 1925, was the first biographical book on a Finnish sportsman. Finnish astronomer Yrj\u00f6 V\u00e4is\u00e4l\u00e4 named the main belt asteroid 1740 Paavo Nurmi after Nurmi in 1939, while Finnair named its first DC-8 \"Paavo Nurmi\" in 1969. Nurmi's former rival Ville Ritola boarded the plane when he moved back to Finland in 1970.\nPaavo Nurmi Marathon, held annually since 1969, is the oldest marathon in Wisconsin and the second-oldest in the American Midwest. In Finland, another marathon bearing the name has been held in Nurmi's hometown of Turku since 1992, along with the athletics competition Paavo Nurmi Games that was started in 1957. Finlandia University, an American college with Finnish roots, named their athletic center after Nurmi. A ten-mark bill featuring a portrait of Nurmi was issued by the Bank of Finland in 1987. The other revised bills honored architect Alvar Aalto, composer Jean Sibelius, Enlightenment thinker Anders Chydenius and author Elias L\u00f6nnrot, respectively. The Nurmi bill was replaced by a new 20-mark note featuring V\u00e4in\u00f6 Linna in 1993. In 1997, a historic stadium in Turku was renamed the \"Paavo Nurmi Stadium\". Twenty world records have been set at the stadium, including John Landy's records on the 1500 m and the mile, Nurmi's record on the 3000 m and Z\u00e1topek's record on the 10,000 m. In fiction, Nurmi appears in William Goldman's 1974 novel \"Marathon Man\" as the idol of the protagonist, who aims to become a greater runner than Nurmi. The opera on Nurmi, \"Paavo the Great. Great Race. Great Dream.\", written by Paavo Haavikko and composed by Tuomas Kantelinen, debuted at the Helsinki Olympic Stadium in 2000. In a 2005 episode of \"The Simpsons\", Mr. Burns brags that he once outraced Nurmi in his antique motorcar. The NURMI Study, which aims to compare the athletic performance of vegetarian and vegan athletes to those with omnivorous diets, is named in honour of Paavo Nurmi.\nCareer summary (1920\u201334).\nSeasons.\nThe starts figure excludes heats, handicap races, relays, and events where Nurmi raced alone against relay teams.\nEvents.\nThe starts figure excludes heats, handicap races, relays, and events where Nurmi raced alone against relay teams.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Sister-inline/styles.css\"/&gt; Media related to at Wikimedia Commons"}

With its forerunner, the Badge of Military Merit, which took the form of a heart made of purple cloth, the Purple Heart is the oldest military award still given to U.S. military members. The National Purple Heart Hall of Honor is located in New Windsor, New York.\nHistory.\nThe original Purple Heart, designated as the Badge of Military Merit, was established by George Washington \u2013 then the commander-in-chief of the Continental Army \u2013 by order from his Newburgh, New York, headquarters on 7 August 1782. The Badge of Military Merit was only awarded to three Revolutionary War soldiers by Washington himself. Washington authorized his subordinate officers to issue Badges of Merit as appropriate. Although never abolished, the award of the badge was not proposed again officially until after World War I.\nOn 10 October 1927, Army Chief of Staff General Charles Pelot Summerall directed that a draft bill be sent to Congress \"to revive the Badge of Military Merit\". The bill was withdrawn and action on the case ceased on 3 January 1928, but the office of the Adjutant General was instructed to file all materials collected for possible future use. A number of private interests sought to have the medal re-instituted in the Army; this included the board of directors of the Fort Ticonderoga Museum in Ticonderoga, New York.\nOn 7 January 1931, Summerall's successor, General Douglas MacArthur, confidentially reopened work on a new design, involving the Washington Commission of Fine Arts. Elizabeth Will, an Army heraldic specialist in the Office of the Quartermaster General, was named to redesign the newly revived medal, which became known as the Purple Heart. Using general specifications provided to her, Will created the design sketch for the present medal of the Purple Heart. The new design, which exhibits a bust and profile of George Washington, was issued on the bicentennial of Washington's birth.\nThe Commission of Fine Arts solicited plaster models from three leading sculptors for the medal, selecting that of John R. Sinnock of the Philadelphia Mint in May 1931. By executive order of the president of the United States, the Purple Heart was revived on the 200th anniversary of George Washington's birth, out of respect to his memory and military achievements, by War Department , dated 22 February 1932.\nThe criteria were announced in a War Department circular dated 22 February 1932, and authorized award to soldiers, upon their request, who had been awarded the Meritorious Service Citation Certificate, Army Wound Ribbon, or were authorized to wear Wound Chevrons subsequent to 5 April 1917, the day before the United States entered World War I. The first Purple Heart was awarded to MacArthur. During the early period of American involvement in World War II (8 December 1941 \u2013 22 September 1943), the Purple Heart was awarded both for wounds received in action against the enemy and for meritorious performance of duty. With the establishment of the Legion of Merit, by an Act of Congress, the practice of awarding the Purple Heart for meritorious service was discontinued. By Executive Order , dated 3 December 1942, the decoration was applied to all services; the order required reasonable uniform application of the regulations for each of the Services. This executive order also authorized the award only for wounds received. For both military and civilian personnel during the World War II era, to meet eligibility for the Purple Heart, Army Regulation 600\u201345, dated 22 September 1943, and 3 May 1944, required identification of circumstances.\nAfter the award was re-authorized in 1932 some U.S. Army wounded from conflicts prior to the First World War applied for, and were awarded, the Purple Heart:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;...\u00a0veterans of the Civil War and Indian Wars, as well as the Spanish\u2013American War, China Relief Expedition (Boxer Rebellion), and Philippine Insurrection also were awarded the Purple Heart. This is because the original regulations governing the award of the Purple Heart, published by the Army in 1932, provided that any soldier who had been wounded in any conflict involving U.S. Army personnel might apply for the new medal. There were but two requirements: the applicant had to be alive at the time of application (no posthumous awards were permitted) and he had to prove that he had received a wound that necessitated treatment by a medical officer.\nSubject to the approval of the Secretary of Defense, Executive Order , dated 12 February 1952, revised authorizations to include the Service Secretaries. Dated 25 April 1962, Executive Order , included provisions for the posthumous award of the Purple Heart. Dated 23 February 1984, Executive Order , authorized award of the Purple Heart as a result of terrorist attacks, or while serving as part of a peacekeeping force, subsequent to 28 March 1973.\nOn 13 June 1985, the Senate approved an amendment to the 1985 Defense Authorization Bill, which changed the precedence of the Purple Heart award, from immediately above the Good Conduct Medal to immediately above the Meritorious Service Medals. Public Law 99-145 authorized the award for wounds received as a result of friendly fire. Public Law 104-106 expanded the eligibility date, authorizing the award of the Purple Heart to a former prisoner of war who was wounded after 25 April 1962. The National Defense Authorization Act for the Fiscal Year 1998 (Public Law 105\u201385) changed the criteria to delete authorization for the award of the Purple Heart to any non-military U.S. national serving under competent authority in any capacity with the Armed Forces. This change was effective 18 May 1998.\nDuring World War II, 1,506,000 Purple Heart medals were manufactured, many in anticipation of the estimated casualties resulting from the planned Allied invasion of Japan. By the end of the war, even accounting for medals lost, stolen, or wasted, nearly 500,000 remained. The total combined American military casualties of the seventy years following the end of World War II\u2014including the Korean and Vietnam Wars\u2014did not exceed that number. In 2000, there remained 120,000 Purple Heart medals in stock between all US Armed Forces. The existing surplus allowed combat units in Iraq and Afghanistan to keep Purple Hearts on hand for immediate award to soldiers wounded in the field. The Defense Supply Center in Philadelphia (DSCP), responsible for overseeing the production and distribution of the medals to each branch of the US Military, has ordered the creation of thousands more Purple Hearts since 2000. Identical in specification to those made in the 1940s, these new medals are today interspersed with stocks of the old surplus.\nIn 2009 \"National Geographic\" estimated the number of Purple Hearts given as:\n7 August of every year is recognized as \"National Purple Heart Day\".\nCriteria.\nThe Purple Heart is awarded in the name of the President of the United States to any member of the Armed Forces of the United States who, while serving under competent authority in any capacity with one of the U.S. Armed Services after 5 April 1917, has been wounded or killed. Specific examples of services which warrant the Purple Heart include:\nCriteria (c) and (e) were added by Executive Order on 25 April 1962, as U.S. service personnel were being sent to South Vietnam during the Vietnam War as military advisors rather than combatants. As many were being killed or wounded while serving in that capacity in South Vietnam, and because the United States was not formally a participant of the war (until 1965), there was no \"enemy\" to satisfy the requirement of a wound or death received \"in action against an enemy\". In response, President John F. Kennedy signed the executive order that awarded to any person wounded or killed \"while serving with friendly foreign forces\" or \"as a result of action by a hostile foreign force\".\nAfter 28 March 1973, it may be awarded as a result of an international terrorist attack against the United States or a foreign nation friendly to the United States, recognized as such an attack by the Secretary of the Army, or jointly by the Secretaries of the separate armed services concerned if persons from more than one service are wounded in the attack. Also, it may be awarded as a result of military operations while serving outside the territory of the United States as part of a peacekeeping force.\nThe Purple Heart differs from most other decorations in that an individual is not \"recommended\" for the decoration; rather the service member is entitled to it upon meeting specific criteria. A Purple Heart is awarded for the first wound suffered under conditions indicated above, but for each subsequent award an oak leaf cluster or 5/16 inch star is worn in lieu of another medal. Not more than one award will be made for more than one wound or injury received at the same instant.\nA \"wound\" is defined as an injury to any part of the body from an outside force or agent sustained under one or more of the conditions listed above. A physical lesion is not required; however, the wound for which the award is made must have required treatment by a medical officer and records of medical treatment for wounds or injuries received in action must have been made a matter of official record. When contemplating an award of this decoration, the key issue that commanders must take into consideration is the degree to which the enemy caused the injury. The fact that the proposed recipient was participating in direct or indirect combat operations is a necessary prerequisite, but is not sole justification for award. The Purple Heart is not awarded for non-combat injuries.\nEnemy-related injuries which \"justify\" the award of the Purple Heart include: injury caused by enemy bullet, shrapnel, or other projectile created by enemy action; injury caused by enemy placed land mine, naval mine, or trap; injury caused by enemy released chemical, biological, or nuclear agent; injury caused by vehicle or aircraft accident resulting from enemy fire; and, concussion injuries caused as a result of enemy generated explosions.\nInjuries or wounds which \"do not qualify\" for award of the Purple Heart include frostbite or trench foot injuries; heat stroke; food poisoning not caused by enemy agents; chemical, biological, or nuclear agents not released by the enemy; battle fatigue; disease not directly caused by enemy agents; accidents, to include explosive, aircraft, vehicular, and other accidental wounding not related to or caused by enemy action; self-inflicted wounds (e.g., a soldier accidentally or intentionally fires their own gun and the bullet strikes his or her leg), except when in the heat of battle, and not involving gross negligence; post-traumatic stress disorders; and jump injuries not caused by enemy action.\nIt is not intended that such a strict interpretation of the requirement for the wound or injury to be caused by direct result of hostile action be taken that it would preclude the award being made to deserving personnel. Commanders must also take into consideration the circumstances surrounding an injury, even if it appears to meet the criteria. In the case of an individual injured while making a parachute landing from an aircraft that had been brought down by enemy fire; or, an individual injured as a result of a vehicle accident caused by enemy fire, the decision will be made in favor of the individual and the award will be made. Additionally, individuals wounded or killed as a result of \"friendly fire\" in the \"heat of battle\" will be awarded the Purple Heart as long as the \"friendly\" projectile or agent was released with the full intent of inflicting damage or destroying enemy troops or equipment. Individuals injured as a result of their own negligence, such as by driving or walking through an unauthorized area known to have been mined or placed off limits or searching for or picking up unexploded munitions as war souvenirs, will not be awarded the Purple Heart as they clearly were not injured as a result of enemy action, but rather by their own negligence.\nAnimals are generally not eligible for the Purple Heart; however, there have been rare instances when animals holding military rank were honored with the award. An example includes the horse Sergeant Reckless during the Korean War, and the dog Sergeant Stubby of the 102nd Infantry Regiment during World War 1.\nFormer eligibility.\nFrom 1942 to 1997, non-military personnel serving or closely affiliated with the armed forces\u2014as government employees, Red Cross workers, war correspondents, and various other professions\u2014were eligible to receive the Purple Heart whether in peacetime or armed conflicts. Among the earliest individuals to receive the award were nine Honolulu Fire Department (HFD) firefighters who were killed or wounded in peacetime while fighting fires at Hickam Field during the attack on Pearl Harbor. In total, about 100 men and women who served as non-military personnel received the award, the most famous being newspaperman Ernie Pyle, who was awarded a Purple Heart posthumously by the Army after being killed by Japanese machine gun fire in the Pacific Theater near the end of World War II. Pyle had previously seen and experienced combat in the European Theater while accompanying and writing about infantrymen for readers back home. Those serving in the Merchant Marine are not eligible for the award. During World War II, members of this service who met the Purple Heart criteria received a Merchant Marine Mariner's Medal instead.\nThe most recent Purple Hearts presented to non-military personnel occurred after the terrorist attacks at Khobar Towers, Saudi Arabia, in 1996\u2014for their injuries, about 40 U.S. civil service employees received the award.\nHowever, in 1997, at the urging of the Military Order of the Purple Heart, Congress passed legislation prohibiting future awards of the Purple Heart to non-military personnel. Civilian employees of the U.S. Department of Defense who are killed or wounded as a result of hostile action may receive the new Defense of Freedom Medal. This award was created shortly after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.\nAppearance.\nThe Purple Heart award is a purple- and gold-colored heart-shaped brass-alloy medal containing a profile of General George Washington. Above the heart appears a shield of the coat of arms of George Washington (a white shield with two red bars and three red stars in chief) between sprays of green leaves. The reverse consists of a raised bronze heart with the words below the coat of arms and leaves.\nThe ribbon is wide and consists of the following stripes: white 67101; purple 67115; and white 67101.\nDevices.\nAdditional awards of the Purple Heart are denoted by oak leaf clusters in the Army, Air Force, and Space Force, and additional awards of the Purple Heart Medal are denoted by &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;5\u204416 inch stars in the Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard.\nPresentation.\nCurrent active duty personnel are awarded the Purple Heart upon recommendation from their chain of command, stating the injury that was received and the action in which the service member was wounded. The award authority for the Purple Heart is normally at the level of an Army Brigade, Marine Corps Division, Air Force wing, Space Force delta, or Navy Task Force. While the award of the Purple Heart is considered automatic for all wounds received in combat, each award presentation must still be reviewed to ensure that the wounds received were as a result of enemy action. Modern day Purple Heart presentations are recorded in both hardcopy and electronic service records. The annotation of the Purple Heart is denoted both with the service member's parent command and at the headquarters of the military service department. An original citation and award certificate are presented to the service member and filed in the field service record.\nDuring the Vietnam War, Korean War, and World War II, the Purple Heart was often awarded on the spot, with occasional entries made into service records. In addition, during mass demobilizations following each of America's major wars of the 20th century, it was common occurrence to omit mention from service records of a Purple Heart award. This occurred due to clerical errors, and became problematic once a service record was closed upon discharge. In terms of keeping accurate records, it was commonplace for some field commanders to engage in bedside presentations of the Purple Heart. This typically entailed a general entering a hospital with a box of Purple Hearts, pinning them on the pillows of wounded service members, then departing with no official records kept of the visit, or the award of the Purple Heart. Service members, themselves, complicated matters by unofficially leaving hospitals, hastily returning to their units to rejoin battle so as not to appear a malingerer. In such cases, even if a service member had received actual wounds in combat, both the award of the Purple Heart, as well as the entire visit to the hospital, was unrecorded in official records.\nService members requesting retroactive awards of the Purple Heart must normally apply through the National Personnel Records Center. Following a review of service records, qualified Army members are awarded the Purple Heart by the U.S. Army Human Resources Command in Fort Knox, Kentucky. Air Force veterans are awarded the Purple Heart by the Awards Office of Randolph Air Force Base, while Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard, present Purple Hearts to veterans through the Navy Liaison Officer at the National Personnel Records Center. Simple clerical errors, where a Purple Heart is denoted in military records, but was simply omitted from a WD AGO Form 53-55 (predecessor to the) DD Form 214 (Report of Separation), are corrected on site at the National Personnel Records Center through issuance of a DD-215 document.\nNotable recipients.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nMost Purple Heart awards.\nTen Purple Hearts:\nNine Purple Hearts:\nEight Purple Hearts:\nSeven Purple Hearts:\nThree Purple Hearts:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The term molecule may or may not be used to refer to a polyatomic ion, depending on the definition used. The prefix \"poly-\" carries the meaning \"many\" in Greek, but even ions of two atoms are commonly described as polyatomic. There may be more than one atom in the structure that has non-zero charge, therefore the net charge of the structure may have a cationic (positive) or anionic nature depending on those atomic details. \nIn older literature, a polyatomic ion may instead be referred to as a \"radical\" (or less commonly, as a \"radical group\"). In contemporary usage, the term \"radical\" refers to various free radicals, which are species that have an unpaired electron and need not be charged.\nA simple example of a polyatomic ion is the hydroxide ion, which consists of one oxygen atom and one hydrogen atom, jointly carrying a net charge of \u22121; its chemical formula is . In contrast, an ammonium ion consists of one nitrogen atom and four hydrogen atoms, with a charge of +1; its chemical formula is .\nPolyatomic ions often are useful in the context of acid\u2013base chemistry and in the formation of salts.\nOften, a polyatomic ion can be considered as the conjugate acid or base of a neutral molecule. For example, the conjugate base of sulfuric acid (H2SO4) is the polyatomic hydrogen sulfate anion (). The removal of another hydrogen ion produces the sulfate anion ().\nNomenclature of polyatomic anions.\nThere are several patterns that can be used for learning the nomenclature of polyatomic anions. First, when the prefix \"bi\" is added to a name, a hydrogen is added to the ion's formula and its charge is increased by 1, the latter being a consequence of the hydrogen ion's +1 charge. An alternative to the \"bi-\" prefix is to use the word hydrogen in its place: the anion derived from . For example, let us consider the carbonate() ion:\nwhich is called either bicarbonate or hydrogen carbonate. The process that forms these ions is called protonation.\nNaming oxyanions.\nMost of the common polyatomic anions are oxyanions, conjugate bases of oxyacids (acids derived from the oxides of non-metallic elements). For example, the sulfate anion, , is derived from , which can be regarded as + .\nThe second rule is based on the oxidation state of the central atom in the ion, which in practice is often (but not always) directly related to the number of oxygen atoms in the ion, following the pattern shown below. The following table shows the chlorine oxyanion family:\nAs the number of oxygen atoms bound to chlorine increases, the chlorine's oxidation number becomes more positive. This gives rise to the following common pattern: first, the \"-ate\" ion is considered to be the base name; adding a \"per-\" prefix adds an oxygen (or otherwise increases the oxidation state), while changing the \"-ate\" suffix to \"-ite\" will reduce the oxygens by one, and keeping the suffix \"-ite\" and adding the prefix \"hypo-\" reduces the number of oxygens by one more, all without changing the charge. The naming pattern follows within many different oxyanion series based on a standard root for that particular series. The \"-ite\" has one less oxygen than the \"-ate\", but different \"-ate\" anions might have different numbers of oxygen atoms.\nGenerally, the change in prefix corresponds to a change in oxidation state. The main exception is the \"per-\" prefix, as only halogens and some transition metals can be oxidized to the +7 or greater oxidation states that would normally use \"per-\". For other elements, it is used as shorthand for \"peroxy-\", which has the same oxidation state as the prior \"-ate\" anion, but contains a peroxide group instead of a single oxygen. There are also cases where the oxidation state increases but the number of oxygen atoms does not, such as the oxidation of manganate () to permanganate ().\nSome oxyanions form dimers, usually by losing an equivalent of oxide. These anions are given the prefix \"di-\" or \"pyro-\" (as many can be prepared by heating). These anions contain bonds, and are structurally related to acid anhydrides of the conjugate acid. The \"pyro-\" prefix is only used for these kinds of dimers; others, such as hyponitrite, contain different bond structures despite having a formula that suggests it is \"made\" of two nitroxide units.\nThe following table shows the patterns of ion naming for some common ions and their derivatives. Exceptions to the rules are highlighted in yellow, while anions too unstable to exist are marked out with a red \"none\".\nOther examples of common polyatomic ions.\nThe following tables give additional examples of commonly encountered polyatomic ions in various categories. Only a few representatives are given, as the number of polyatomic ions encountered in practice is very large.\nZwitterion and polycharged polyatomic ions.\nMany polyatomic molecules can carry spatially separated charges, forming polycharged polyatomic ions. An important case of these compounds are zwitterions, which are neutral compounds but have opposing formal charges within the same molecule. A typical example are amino acids, which carry both charged amino and carboxyl groups. These charges can influence the chemical and physical properties of substances.\nMany zwitterions exhibit tautomerism with a \"parent\" molecule without formal charges. For example, glycine reversibly converts between the parent molecule and a zwitterionic form by transfer of a labile hydrogen atom between the protonated amino group and carboxylate group. By contrast, trimethylglycine has three non-labile methyl groups, making quaternary ammonium, so it does not interconvert with the non-zwitterionic isomer (a dimethylglycine ester). These non-tautomeric zwitterions are called betaines.\nApplications.\nPolyatomic ion structure may influence thin film growth. Analyses of polyatomic ion composition is key point in mass-spectrometry.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Christian missionaries and converts to Christianity have both been targeted for persecution, sometimes to the point of being martyred for their faith, ever since the emergence of Christianity.\nEarly Christians were persecuted at the hands of both Jews, from whose religion Christianity arose, and the Romans who controlled many of the early centers of Christianity in the Roman Empire. Since the emergence of Christian states in Late Antiquity, Christians have also been persecuted by other Christians due to differences in doctrine which have been declared heretical. Early in the fourth century, the empire's official persecutions were ended by the Edict of Serdica in 311 and the practice of Christianity legalized by the Edict of Milan in 312. By the year 380, Christians had begun to persecute each other. The schisms of late antiquity and the Middle Ages \u2013 including the Rome\u2013Constantinople schisms and the many Christological controversies \u2013 together with the later Protestant Reformation provoked severe conflicts between Christian denominations. During these conflicts, members of the various denominations frequently persecuted each other and engaged in sectarian violence. \nIn the 20th century, Christian populations were persecuted, sometimes, they were persecuted to the point of genocide, by various states, including the Ottoman Empire and its successor state, the Republic of Turkey, which committed the Hamidian massacres, the late Ottoman genocides (comprising the Armenian, Greek, and Assyrian genocides), and the Diyarbekir genocide, and atheist states such as those of the former Eastern Bloc.\nThe persecution of Christians has continued to occur during the 21st century. Christianity is the largest world religion and its adherents live across the globe. Approximately 10% of the world's Christians are members of minority groups which live in non-Christian-majority states. The contemporary persecution of Christians includes the official state persecution mostly occurring in countries which are located in Africa and Asia because they have state religions or because their governments and societies practice religious favoritism. Such favoritism is frequently accompanied by religious discrimination and religious persecution.\nAccording to the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom's 2020 report, Christians in Burma, China, Eritrea, India, Iran, Nigeria, North Korea, Pakistan, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Syria, and Vietnam are persecuted; these countries are labelled \"countries of particular concern\" by the United States Department of State, because of their governments' engagement in, or toleration of, \"severe violations of religious freedom\". The same report recommends that Afghanistan, Algeria, Azerbaijan, Bahrain, the Central African Republic, Cuba, Egypt, Indonesia, Iraq, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Sudan, and Turkey constitute the US State Department's \"special watchlist\" of countries in which the government allows or engages in \"severe violations of religious freedom\".\nMuch of the persecution of Christians in recent times is perpetrated by non-state actors which are labelled \"entities of particular concern\" by the US State Department, including the Islamist groups Boko Haram in Nigeria, the Houthi movement in Yemen, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant \u2013 Khorasan Province in Pakistan, al-Shabaab in Somalia, the Taliban in Afghanistan, the Islamic State as well as the United Wa State Army and participants in the Kachin conflict in Myanmar.\nAntiquity.\nNew Testament.\nEarly Christianity began as a sect among Second Temple Jews. Inter-communal dissension began almost immediately.\nAccording to the New Testament account, Saul of Tarsus prior to his conversion to Christianity persecuted early Judeo-Christians. \nAccording to the \"Acts of the Apostles\", a year after the Roman crucifixion of Jesus, Stephen was stoned for what the Jews saw as transgressions of the Jewish law. And Saul (also known as \"Paul\") acquiesced, looking on and witnessing Stephen's death. Later, Paul begins a listing of his own sufferings after conversion in 2 Corinthians 11:24 \"Five times I received from the Jews the forty lashes minus one. Three times I was beaten with rods, once I was stoned ...\"\nEarly Judeo-Christian.\nIn 41\u00a0AD, Herod Agrippa, who already possessed the territory of Herod Antipas and Philip (his former colleagues in the Herodian Tetrarchy), obtained the title of \"King of the Jews\", and in a sense, re-formed the Kingdom of Judea of Herod the Great (r.\u200937\u00a0\u2013\u00a04\u00a0BC). Herod Agrippa was reportedly responsible for the persecution in which James the Great lost his life, Saint Peter narrowly escaped and the rest of the apostles took flight. After Agrippa's death in 44, the Roman procuratorship began (before 41 they were Prefects in Iudaea Province) and those leaders maintained a neutral peace, until the procurator Porcius Festus died in 62 and the high priest Ananus ben Ananus took advantage of the power vacuum to execute James the Just, then leader of Jerusalem's Christians.\nAccording to the New Testament, Paul was imprisoned on several occasions by the Roman authorities, stoned by Jews and left for dead on one occasion, and was eventually taken to Rome as a prisoner. Peter and other early Christians were also imprisoned and prosecuted. The First Jewish Rebellion led to the destruction of Jerusalem in 70\u00a0AD, the end of Second Temple Judaism (and the subsequent slow rise of Rabbinic Judaism).\nClaudia Setzer asserts that, \"Jews did not see Christians as clearly separate from their own community until at least the middle of the second century\" but most scholars place the \"parting of the ways\" much earlier, with theological separation occurring immediately. Second Temple Judaism had allowed more than one way to be Jewish. After the fall of the Temple, one way led to rabbinic Judaism, while another way became Christianity; but Christianity was \"molded around the conviction that the Jew, Jesus of Nazareth, was not only the Messiah promised to the Jews, but God's son, offering access to God, and God's blessing to non-Jew as much as, and perhaps eventually more than, to Jews\". While Messianic eschatology had deep roots in Judaism, and the idea of the suffering servant, known as Messiah Ephraim, had been an aspect since the time of Isaiah (7th century BCE), in the first century, this idea was seen as being usurped by the Christians. It was then suppressed, and did not make its way back into rabbinic teaching till the seventh century writings of Pesiqta Rabati.\nThe traditional view of the separation of Judaism and Christianity has Jewish-Christians fleeing, \"en masse\", to Pella (shortly before the fall of the Temple in 70 AD) as a result of persecution. Steven D. Katz says \"there can be no doubt that the post-70 situation witnessed a change in the relations of Jews and Christians\". Judaism sought to reconstitute itself after the disaster which included determining the proper response to Jewish Christianity. The exact shape of this is not directly known but is traditionally alleged to have taken four forms: the circulation of official anti-Christian pronouncements, the issuing of an official ban against Christians attending synagogue, a prohibition against reading heretical writings, and the spreading of the curse against heretics.\nRoman Empire.\nNeronian persecution.\nThe first documented case of imperially supervised persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire begins with Nero (54\u201368). In the \"Annals\", Tacitus states that Nero blamed Christians for the Great Fire of Rome, and while it is generally believed to be authentic and reliable, some modern scholars have cast doubt on this view, largely because there is no further reference to Nero's blaming of Christians for the fire until the late 4th century. Suetonius mentions punishments inflicted on Christians, defined as men following a new and malefic superstition, but does not specify the reasons for the punishment; he simply lists the fact together with other abuses put down by Nero. It is widely agreed on that the Number of the beast in the Book of Revelation, adding up to 666, is derived from a gematria of the name of Nero Caesar, indicating that Nero was viewed as an exceptionally evil figure. Several Christian sources report that Paul the Apostle and Saint Peter both died during the Neronian persecution.\nFrom Nero to Decius.\nIn the first two centuries Christianity was a relatively small sect which was not a significant concern of the Emperor. Rodney Stark estimates there were fewer than 10,000 Christians in the year 100. Christianity grew to about 200,000 by the year 200, which works out to about 0.36% of the population of the empire, and then to almost 2\u00a0million by 250, still making up less than 2% of the empire's overall population. According to Guy Laurie, the Church was not in a struggle for its existence during its first centuries. However, Bernard Green says that, although early persecutions of Christians were generally sporadic, local, and under the direction of regional governors, not emperors, Christians \"were always subject to oppression and at risk of open persecution.\" Trajan's policy towards Christians was no different from the treatment of other sects; that is, they would only be punished if they refused to worship the emperor and the gods, but they were not to be sought out.\nJames L. Papandrea says there are ten emperors generally accepted to have sponsored state-sanctioned persecution of Christians, though the first empire-wide government-sponsored persecution was not until Decius in 249. One early account of a mass killing is the persecution in Lyon in which Christians were purportedly mass-slaughtered by being thrown to wild beasts under the decree of Roman officials for reportedly refusing to renounce their faith according to Irenaeus. In the 3rd century, Emperor Severus Alexander's household contained many Christians, but his successor, Maximinus Thrax, hating this household, ordered that the leaders of the churches should be put to death. According to Eusebius, this persecution sent Hippolytus of Rome and Pope Pontian into exile, but other evidence suggests that the persecutions were local to the provinces where they occurred rather than happening under the direction of the Emperor.\nAccording to two different Christian traditions, Simon bar Kokhba, the leader of the third Jewish revolt against Rome (132\u2013136 AD), who was proclaimed Messiah, persecuted the Christians: Justin Martyr says that Christians were punished if they did not deny and blaspheme Jesus Christ, while Eusebius asserts that Bar Kokhba harassed them because they refused to join his revolt against the Romans.\nVoluntary martyrdom.\nSome early Christians sought out and welcomed martyrdom. According to Droge and Tabor, \"in 185 the proconsul of Asia, Arrius Antoninus, was approached by a group of Christians demanding to be executed. The proconsul obliged some of them and then sent the rest away, saying that if they wanted to kill themselves there was plenty of rope available or cliffs they could jump off.\" Such enthusiasm for death is found in the letters of Saint Ignatius of Antioch, who was arrested and condemned as a criminal before writing his letters while on the way to execution. Ignatius casts his own martyrdom as a voluntary eucharistic sacrifice to be embraced.\n\"Many martyr acts present martyrdom as a sharp choice that cut to the core of Christian identity \u2013 life or death, salvation or damnation, Christ or apostacy...\" Subsequently, the martyr literature has drawn distinctions between those who were enthusiastically pro-voluntary-martyrdom (the Montanists and Donatists), those who occupied a neutral, moderate position (the orthodox), and those who were anti-martyrdom (the Gnostics).\nThe category of voluntary martyr began to emerge only in the third century in the context of efforts to justify flight from persecution. The condemnation of voluntary martyrdom is used to justify Clement fleeing the Severan persecution in Alexandria in 202 AD, and the \"Martyrdom of Polycarp\" justifies Polycarp's flight on the same grounds. \"Voluntary martyrdom is parsed as passionate foolishness\" whereas \"flight from persecution is patience\" and the result a true martyrdom.\nDaniel Boyarin rejects use of the term \"voluntary martyrdom\", saying, \"if martyrdom is not voluntary, it is not martyrdom\". G. E. M. de Ste. Croix adds a category of \"quasi-voluntary martyrdom\": \"martyrs who were not directly responsible for their own arrest but who, after being arrested, behaved with\" a stubborn refusal to obey or comply with authority. Candida Moss asserts that De Ste. Croix's judgment of what values are worth dying for is modern, and does not represent classical values. According to her there was no such concept as \"quasi-volunteer martyrdom\" in ancient times.\nDecian persecution.\nIn the reign of the emperor Decius (r.\u2009249\u00a0\u2013\u00a0251), a decree was issued requiring that all residents of the empire should perform sacrifices, to be enforced by the issuing of each person with a \"libellus\" certifying that they had performed the necessary ritual. It is not known what motivated Decius's decree, or whether it was intended to target Christians, though it is possible the emperor was seeking divine favors in the forthcoming wars with the Carpi and the Goths. Christians that refused to publicly offer sacrifices or burn incense to Roman gods were accused of impiety and punished by arrest, imprisonment, torture or execution. According to Eusebius, bishops Alexander of Jerusalem, Babylas of Antioch, and Fabian of Rome were all imprisoned and killed. The patriarch Dionysius of Alexandria escaped captivity, while the bishop Cyprian of Carthage fled his episcopal see to the countryside. The Christian church, despite no indication in the surviving texts that the edict targeted any specific group, never forgot the reign of Decius whom they labelled as that \"fierce tyrant\". After Decius died, Trebonianus Gallus (r.\u2009251\u00a0\u2013\u00a0253) succeeded him and continued the Decian persecution for the duration of his reign.\nValerianic persecution.\nThe accession of Trebonianus Gallus's successor Valerian (r.\u2009253\u00a0\u2013\u00a0260) ended the Decian persecution. In 257 however, Valerian began to enforce public religion. Cyprian of Carthage was exiled and executed the following year, while Pope Sixtus II was also put to death. Dionysius of Alexandria was tried, urged to recognize \"the natural gods\" in the hope his congregation would imitate him, and exiled when he refused.\nValerian was defeated by the Persians at the Battle of Edessa and himself taken prisoner in 260. According to Eusebius, Valerian's son, co-\"augustus\", and successor Gallienus (r.\u2009253\u00a0\u2013\u00a0268) allowed Christian communities to use again their cemeteries and made restitution of their confiscated buildings. Eusebius wrote that Gallienus allowed the Christians \"freedom of action\".\nLate antiquity.\nRoman Empire.\nThe Great Persecution.\nThe Great Persecution, or Diocletianic Persecution, was begun by the senior \"augustus\" and Roman emperor Diocletian (r.\u2009284\u00a0\u2013\u00a0305) on 23 February 303. In the eastern Roman empire, the official persecution lasted intermittently until 313, while in the Western Roman Empire the persecution went unenforced from 306. According to Lactantius's \"De mortibus persecutorum\" (\"on the deaths of the persecutors\"), Diocletian's junior emperor, the \"caesar\" Galerius (r.\u2009293\u00a0\u2013\u00a0311) pressured the \"augustus\" to begin persecuting Christians. Eusebius of Caesarea's \"Church History\" reports that imperial edicts were promulgated to destroy churches and confiscate scriptures, and to remove Christian occupants of government positions, while Christian priests were to be imprisoned and required to perform sacrifice in ancient Roman religion. In the account of Eusebius, an unnamed Christian man (named by later hagiographers as Euethius of Nicomedia and venerated on 27 February) tore down a public notice of an imperial edict while the emperors Diocletian and Galerius were in Nicomedia (\u0130zmit), one of Diocletian's capitals; according to Lactantius, he was tortured and burned alive. According to Lactantius, the church at Nicomedia (\u0130zmit) was destroyed, while the \"Optatan Appendix\" has an account from the praetorian prefecture of Africa involving the confiscation of written materials which led to the Donatist schism. According to Eusebius's \"Martyrs of Palestine\" and Lactantius's \"De mortibus persecutorum\", a fourth edict in 304 demanded that everyone perform sacrifices, though in the western empire this was not enforced.\nAn \"unusually philosophical\" dialogue is recorded in the trial proceedings of Phileas of Thmuis, bishop of Thmuis in Egypt's Nile Delta, which survive on Greek papyri from the 4th century among the Bodmer Papyri and the Chester Beatty Papyri of the Bodmer and Chester Beatty libraries and in manuscripts in Latin, Ethiopic, and Coptic languages from later centuries, a body of hagiography known as the \"Acts of Phileas\". Phileas was condemned at his fifth trial at Alexandria under Clodius Culcianus, the \"praefectus Aegypti\" on 4 February 305 (the 10th day of \"Mecheir\").\nIn the western empire, the Diocletianic Persecution ceased with the usurpation by two emperors' sons in 306: that of Constantine, who was acclaimed \"augustus\" by the army after his father Constantius I (r.\u2009293\u00a0\u2013\u00a0306) died, and that of Maxentius (r.\u2009306\u00a0\u2013\u00a0312) who was elevated to \"augustus\" by the Roman Senate after the grudging retirement of his father Maximian (r.\u2009285\u00a0\u2013\u00a0305) and his co-\"augustus\" Diocletian in May 305. Of Maxentius, who controlled Italy with his now un-retired father, and Constantine, who controlled Britain, Gaul, and Iberia, neither was inclined to continue the persecution. In the eastern empire however, Galerius, now \"augustus\", continued Diocletian's policy. Eusebius's \"Church History\" and \"Martyrs of Palestine\" both give accounts of martyrdom and persecution of Christians, including Eusebius's own mentor Pamphilus of Caesarea, with whom he was imprisoned during the persecution.\nWhen Galerius died in May 311, he is reported by Lactantius and Eusebius to have composed a deathbed edict \u2013 the Edict of Serdica \u2013 allowing the assembly of Christians in conventicles and explaining the motives for the prior persecution. Eusebius wrote that Easter was celebrated openly. By autumn however, Galerius's nephew, former \"caesar\", and co-\"augustus\" Maximinus Daia (r.\u2009310\u00a0\u2013\u00a0313) was enforcing Diocletian's persecution in his territories in Anatolia and the Diocese of the East in response to petitions from numerous cities and provinces, including Antioch, Tyre, Lycia, and Pisidia. Maximinus was also encouraged to act by an oracular pronouncement made by a statue of Zeus \"Philios\" set up in Antioch by Theotecnus of Antioch, who also organized an anti-Christian petition to be sent from the Antiochenes to Maximinus, requesting that the Christians there be expelled. Among the Christians known to have died in this phase of the persecution are the presbyter Lucian of Antioch, the bishop Methodius of Olympus in Lycia, and Peter, the patriarch of Alexandria. Defeated in a civil war by the \"augustus\" Licinius (r.\u2009308\u00a0\u2013\u00a0324), Maximinus died in 313, ending the systematic persecution of Christianity as a whole in the Roman Empire. Only one martyr is known by name from the reign of Licinius, who issued the Edict of Milan jointly with his ally, co-\"augustus\", and brother-in-law Constantine, which had the effect of resuming the toleration of before the persecution and returning confiscated property to Christian owners.\nThe \"New Catholic Encyclopedia\" states that \"Ancient, medieval and early modern hagiographers were inclined to exaggerate the number of martyrs. Since the title of martyr is the highest title to which a Christian can aspire, this tendency is natural\". Attempts at estimating the numbers involved are inevitably based on inadequate sources.\nConstantinian period.\nThe Christian church marked the conversion of Constantine the Great as the final fulfillment of its heavenly victory over the \"false gods\". The Roman state had always seen itself as divinely directed, now it saw the first great age of persecution, in which the Devil was considered to have used open violence to dissuade the growth of Christianity, at an end. The orthodox catholic Christians close to the Roman state represented imperial persecution as an historical phenomenon, rather than a contemporary one. According to MacMullan, the Christian histories are colored by this \"triumphalism\".\nPeter Leithart says that, \"[Constantine] did not punish pagans for being pagans, or Jews for being Jews, and did not adopt a policy of forced conversion\". Pagans remained in important positions at his court. He outlawed the gladiatorial shows, destroyed some temples and plundered more, and used forceful rhetoric against non-Christians, but he never engaged in a purge. Maxentius' supporters were not slaughtered when Constantine took the capital; Licinius' family and court were not killed. However, followers of doctrines which were seen as heretical or causing schism were persecuted during the reign of Constantine, the first Christian Roman emperor, and they would be persecuted again later in the 4th century. The consequence of Christian doctrinal disputes was generally mutual excommunication, but once Roman government became involved in ecclesiastical politics, rival factions could find themselves subject to \"repression, expulsion, imprisonment or exile\" carried out by the Roman army.\nIn 312, the Christian sect called Donatists appealed to Constantine to solve a dispute. He convened a synod of bishops to hear the case, but the synod sided against them. The Donatists refused to accept the ruling, so a second gathering of 200 at Arles, in 314, was called, but they also ruled against them. The Donatists again refused to accept the ruling, and proceeded to act accordingly by establishing their own bishop, building their own churches, and refusing cooperation. This was a defiance of imperial authority, and it produced the same response Rome had taken in the past against such refusals. For a Roman emperor, \"religion could be tolerated only as long as it contributed to the stability of the state\". Constantine used the army in an effort to compel Donatist' obedience, burning churches and martyring some from 317 \u2013 321. Constantine failed in reaching his goal and ultimately conceded defeat. The schism remained and Donatism continued. After Constantine, his youngest son Flavius Julius Constans, initiated the Macarian campaign against the Donatists from 346 \u2013 348 which only succeeded in renewing sectarian strife and creating more martyrs. Donatism continued.\nThe fourth century was dominated by its many conflicts defining orthodoxy versus heterodoxy and heresy. In the Eastern Roman empire, known as Byzantium, the Arian controversy began with its debate of Trinitarian formulas which lasted 56 years. As it moved into the West, the center of the controversy was the \"champion of orthodoxy\", Athanasius. In 355 Constantius, who supported Arianism, ordered the suppression and exile of Athanasius, expelled the orthodox Pope Liberius from Rome, and exiled bishops who refused to assent to Athanasius's exile. In 355, Dionysius, bishop of Mediolanum (Milan) was expelled from his episcopal see and replaced by the Arian Christian Auxentius of Milan. When Constantius returned to Rome in 357, he consented to allow the return of Liberius to the papacy; the Arian Pope Felix II, who had replaced him, was then driven out along with his followers.\nThe last emperor of the Constantinian dynasty, Constantine's half-brother's son Julian (r.\u2009361\u00a0\u2013\u00a0363) opposed Christianity and sought to restore traditional religion, though he did not arrange a general or official persecution.\nValentinianic\u2013Theodosian period.\nAccording to the \"Collectio Avellana\", on the death of Pope Liberius in 366, Damasus, assisted by hired gangs of \"charioteers\" and men \"from the arena\", broke into the Basilica Julia to violently prevent the election of Pope Ursicinus. The battle lasted three days, \"with great slaughter of the faithful\" and a week later Damasus seized the Lateran Basilica, had himself ordained as Pope Damasus I, and compelled the \"praefectus urbi\" Viventius and the \"praefectus annonae\" to exile Ursicinus. Damasus then had seven Christian priests arrested and awaiting banishment, but they escaped and \"gravediggers\" and minor clergy joined another mob of hippodrome and amphitheatre men assembled by the pope to attack the Liberian Basilica, where Ursacinus's loyalists had taken refuge. According to Ammianus Marcellinus, on 26 October, the pope's mob killed 137 people in the church in just one day, and many more died subsequently. The Roman public frequently enjoined the emperor Valentinian the Great to remove Damasus from the throne of Saint Peter, calling him a murderer for having waged a \"filthy war\" against the Christians.\nIn the 4th century, the Terving king Athanaric in c.\u2009375 ordered the Gothic persecution of Christians. Athanaric was perturbed by the spread of Gothic Christianity among his followers, and feared for the displacement of Gothic paganism.\nIt was not until the later 4th century reigns of the \"augusti\" Gratian (r.\u2009367\u00a0\u2013\u00a0383), Valentinian II (r.\u2009375\u00a0\u2013\u00a0392), and Theodosius I (r.\u2009379\u00a0\u2013\u00a0395) that Christianity would become the official religion of the empire with the joint promulgation of the Edict of Thessalonica, establishing Nicene Christianity as the state religion and as the state church of the Roman Empire on 27 February 380. After this began state persecution of non-Nicene Christians, including Arian and Nontrinitarian devotees.\nWhen Augustine became coadjutor Bishop of Hippo in 395, both Donatist and Catholic parties had, for decades, existed side-by-side, with a double line of bishops for the same cities, all competing for the loyalty of the people. Augustine was distressed by the ongoing schism, but he held the view that belief cannot be compelled, so he appealed to the Donatists using popular propaganda, debate, personal appeal, General Councils, appeals to the emperor and political pressure, but all attempts failed. The Donatists fomented protests and street violence, accosted travelers, attacked random Catholics without warning, often doing serious and unprovoked bodily harm such as beating people with clubs, cutting off their hands and feet, and gouging out eyes while also inviting their own martyrdom. By 408, Augustine supported the state's use of force against them. Historian Frederick Russell says that Augustine did not believe this would \"make the Donatists more virtuous\" but he did believe it would make them \"less vicious\".\nAugustine wrote that there had, in the past, been ten Christian persecutions, beginning with the Neronian persecution, and alleging persecutions by the emperors Domitian, Trajan, \"Antoninus\" (Marcus Aurelius), \"Severus\" (Septimius Severus), and Maximinus (\"Thrax\"), as well as Decian and Valerianic persecutions, and then another by Aurelian as well as by Diocletian and Maximian. These ten persecutions Augustine compared with the 10 Plagues of Egypt in the \"Book of Exodus\". Augustine did not see these early persecutions in the same light as that of fourth century heretics. In Augustine's view, when the purpose of persecution is to \"lovingly correct and instruct\", then it becomes discipline and is just. Augustine wrote that \"coercion cannot transmit the truth to the heretic, but it can prepare them to hear and receive the truth\". He said the church would discipline its people out of a loving desire to heal them, and that, \"once compelled to come in, heretics would gradually give their voluntary assent to the truth of Christian orthodoxy.\" He opposed the severity of Rome and the execution of heretics.\nIt is his teaching on coercion that has literature on Augustine frequently referring to him as \"le prince et patriarche de persecuteurs\" (the prince and patriarch of persecutors). Russell says Augustine's theory of coercion \"was not crafted from dogma, but in response to a unique historical situation\" and is therefore context dependent, while others see it as inconsistent with his other teachings. His authority on the question of coercion was undisputed for over a millennium in Western Christianity, and according to Brown \"it provided the theological foundation for the justification of medieval persecution.\"\nHeraclian period.\nCallinicus I, initially a priest and \"skeuophylax\" in the Church of the Theotokos of Blachernae, became patriarch of Constantinople in 693 or 694. Having refused to consent to the demolition of a chapel in the Great Palace, the \"Theotokos ton Metropolitou\", and having possibly been involved in the deposition and exile of Justinian II (r.\u2009685\u00a0\u2013\u00a0695,\u00a0705\u00a0\u2013\u00a0711), an allegation denied by the \"Synaxarion of Constantinople\", he was himself exiled to Rome on the return of Justinian to power in 705. The emperor had Callinicus immured. He is said to have survived forty days when the wall was opened to check his condition, though he died four days later.\nSassanian Empire.\nViolent persecutions of Christians began in earnest in the long reign of Shapur II (r.\u2009309\u00a0\u2013\u00a0379). A persecution of Christians at Kirkuk is recorded in Shapur's first decade, though most persecution happened after 341. At war with the Roman emperor Constantius II (r.\u2009337\u00a0\u2013\u00a0361), Shapur imposed a tax to cover the war expenditure, and Shemon Bar Sabbae, the Bishop of Seleucia-Ctesiphon, refused to collect it. Often citing collaboration with the Romans, the Persians began persecuting and executing Christians. \"Passio\" narratives describe the fate of some Christians venerated as martyrs; they are of varying historical reliability, some being contemporary records by eyewitnesses, others were reliant on popular tradition at some remove from the events. An appendix to the \"Syriac Martyrology of 411\" lists the Christian martyrs of Persia, but other accounts of martyrs' trials contain important historical details on the workings of the Sassanian Empire's historical geography and judicial and administrative practices. Some were translated into Sogdian and discovered at Turpan.\nUnder Yazdegerd I (r.\u2009399\u00a0\u2013\u00a0420) there were occasional persecutions, including an instance of persecution in reprisal for the burning of a Zoroastrian fire temple by a Christian priest, and further persecutions occurred in the reign of Bahram V (r.\u2009420\u00a0\u2013\u00a0438). Under Yazdegerd II (r.\u2009438\u00a0\u2013\u00a0457) an instance of persecution in 446 is recorded in the Syriac martyrology \"Acts of \u0100dur-hormizd and of An\u0101h\u012bd\". Some individual martyrdoms are recorded from the reign of Khosrow I (r.\u2009531\u00a0\u2013\u00a0579), but there were likely no mass persecutions. While according to a peace treaty of 562 between Khosrow and his Roman counterpart Justinian I (r.\u2009527\u00a0\u2013\u00a0565), Persia's Christians were granted the freedom of religion; proselytism was, however, a capital crime. By this time the Church of the East and its head, the Catholicose of the East, were integrated into the administration of the empire and mass persecution was rare.\nThe Sassanian policy shifted from tolerance of other religions under Shapur I to intolerance under Bahram I and apparently a return to the policy of Shapur until the reign of Shapur II. The persecution at that time was initiated by Constantine's conversion to Christianity which followed that of Armenian king Tiridates in about 301. The Christians were thus viewed with suspicions of secretly being partisans of the Roman Empire. This did not change until the fifth century when the Church of the East broke off from the Church of the West. Zoroastrian elites continued viewing the Christians with enmity and distrust throughout the fifth century with threat of persecution remaining significant, especially during war against the Romans.\nZoroastrian high priest Kartir, refers in his inscription dated about 280 on the Ka'ba-ye Zartosht monument in the Naqsh-e Rostam necropolis near Zangiabad, Fars, to persecution (\"zatan\" \u2013 \"to beat, kill\") of Christians (\"Nazareans \"n'zl'y\" and Christians \"klstyd'n\"\"). Kartir took Christianity as a serious opponent. The use of the double expression may be indicative of the Greek-speaking Christians deported by Shapur I from Antioch and other cities during his war against the Romans. Constantine's efforts to protect the Persian Christians made them a target of accusations of disloyalty to Sasanians. With the resumption of Roman-Sasanian conflict under Constantius II, the Christian position became untenable. Zoroastrian priests targeted clergy and ascetics of local Christians to eliminate the leaders of the church. A Syriac manuscript in Edessa in 411 documents dozens executed in various parts of western Sasanian Empire.\nIn 341, Shapur II ordered the persecution of all Christians. In response to their subversive attitude and support of Romans, Shapur II doubled the tax on Christians. Shemon Bar Sabbae informed him that he could not pay the taxes demanded from him and his community. He was martyred and a forty-year-long period of persecution of Christians began. The Council of Seleucia-Ctesiphon gave up choosing bishops since it would result in death. The local \"mobads\" \u2013 Zoroastrian clerics \u2013 with the help of satraps organized slaughters of Christians in Adiabene, Beth Garmae, Khuzistan and many other provinces.\nYazdegerd I showed tolerance towards Jews and Christians for much of his rule. He allowed Christians to practice their religion freely, demolished monasteries and churches were rebuilt and missionaries were allowed to operate freely. He reversed his policies during the later part of his reign however, suppressing missionary activities. Bahram V continued and intensified their persecution, resulting in many of them fleeing to the eastern Roman empire. Bahram demanded their return, beginning the Roman\u2013Sasanian War of 421\u2013422. The war ended with an agreement of freedom of religion for Christians in Iran with that of Mazdaism in Rome. Meanwhile, Christians suffered destruction of churches, renounced the faith, had their private property confiscated and many were expelled.\nYazdegerd II had ordered all his subjects to embrace Mazdeism in an attempt to unite his empire ideologically. The Caucasus rebelled to defend Christianity which had become integrated in their local culture, with Armenian aristocrats turning to the Romans for help. The rebels were however defeated in a battle on the Avarayr Plain. Yeghishe in his \"The History of Vardan and the Armenian War\", pays a tribute to the battles waged to defend Christianity. Another revolt was waged from 481 to 483 which was suppressed. However, the Armenians succeeded in gaining freedom of religion among other improvements.\nAccounts of executions for apostasy of Zoroastrians who converted to Christianity during Sasanian rule proliferated from the fifth to early seventh century, and continued to be produced even after collapse of Sasanians. The punishment of apostates increased under Yazdegerd I and continued under successive kings. It was normative for apostates who were brought to the notice of authorities to be executed, although the prosecution of apostasy depended on political circumstances and Zoroastrian jurisprudence. Per Richard E. Payne, the executions were meant to create a mutually recognised boundary between interactions of the people of the two religions and preventing one religion challenging another's viability. Although the violence on Christians was selective and especially carried out on elites, it served to keep Christian communities in a subordinate and yet viable position in relation to Zoroastrianism. Christians were allowed to build religious buildings and serve in the government as long as they did not expand their institutions and population at the expense of Zoroastrianism.\nKhosrow I was generally regarded as tolerant of Christians and interested in the philosophical and theological disputes during his reign. Sebeos says he had converted to Christianity on his deathbed. John of Ephesus describes an Armenian revolt where he says that Khusrow had attempted to impose Zoroastrianism in Armenia. The account, however, is very similar to the one of Armenian revolt of 451. In addition, Sebeos does not mention any religious persecution in his account of the revolt of 571. A story about Hormizd IV's tolerance is preserved by the historian al-Tabari. Upon being asked why he tolerated Christians, he replied, \"Just as our royal throne cannot stand upon its front legs without its two back ones, our kingdom cannot stand or endure firmly if we cause the Christians and adherents of other faiths, who differ in belief from ourselves, to become hostile to us.\"\nDuring the Byzantine\u2013Sasanian War of 602\u2013628.\nSeveral months after the Persian conquest in AD 614, a riot occurred in Jerusalem, and the Jewish governor of Jerusalem Nehemiah was killed by a band of young Christians along with his \"council of the righteous\" while he was making plans for the building of the Third Temple. At this time the Christians had allied themselves with the Eastern Roman Empire. Shortly afterward, the events escalated into a full-scale Christian rebellion, resulting in a battle against the Jews and Christians who were living in Jerusalem. In the battle's aftermath, many Jews were killed and the survivors fled to Caesarea, which was still being held by the Persian army.\nThe Judeo-Persian reaction was ruthless \u2013 Persian Sasanian general Xorheam assembled Judeo-Persian troops and went and encamped around Jerusalem and besieged it for 19 days. Eventually, digging beneath the foundations of the Jerusalem, they destroyed the wall and on the 19th day of the siege, the Judeo-Persian forces took Jerusalem.\nAccording to the account of the Armenian ecclesiastic and historian Sebeos, the siege resulted in a total Christian death toll of 17,000, the earliest and thus most commonly accepted figure. Per Strategius, following the conquest between 4,518 to 66,509 Christians were massacred by Jews at the Mamilla Pool. Israeli archaeologist Ronny Reich estimates a death toll of 60,000 people before the Persian authorities put an end to the killing. In 1989, a mass burial grave at Mamilla cave was discovered in by Israeli archeologist Ronny Reich, near the site where Strategius recorded the massacre took place. The human remains were in poor condition containing a minimum of 526 individuals.\nThe eyewitness account of Strategius of St. Sabas narrates: \"Jews ransomed the Christians from the hands of the Persian soldiers for good money, and slaughtered them with great joy at Mamilla Pool, and it ran with blood.\" The \"Sulha al-Quds\", the treaty of Jerusalem's capitulation to Muslim forces in 638, can only be understood in the context of the massacre at Mamilla. In it, the Christian Patriarch Sophronius of Jerusalem required that the Arab ruler Umar protect the people of Jerusalem from the Jews. From the many excavations carried out in the Galilee, it is clear that all churches had been destroyed during the period between the Persian invasion and the Arab conquest in 637. The church at Shave Ziyyon was destroyed and burnt in 614. Similar fate befell churches at Evron, Nahariya, 'Arabe and monastery of Shelomi. The monastery at Kursi was damaged in the invasion.\nPre-Islamic Arabia.\nIn AD 516, tribal unrest broke out in Yemen and several tribal elites fought for power. One of those elites was Joseph Dhu Nuwas or \"Y\u016bsuf As\u02bear Yath\u02bear\", a Jewish king of the Himyarite Kingdom who is mentioned in ancient south Arabian inscriptions. Syriac and Byzantine Greek sources say that he fought his war because Christians in Yemen refused to renounce Christianity. In 2009, a documentary that aired on the BBC defended the statement that the villagers had been offered the choice between conversion to Judaism or death and 20,000 Christians were then massacred by stating that \"The production team spoke to many historians over a period of 18 months, among them Nigel Groom, who was our consultant, and Professor Abdul Rahman Al-Ansary, a former professor of archaeology at the King Saud University in Riyadh.\" \nInscriptions documented by Yousef himself show the great pride that he expressed after killing more than 22,000 Christians in Zafar and Najran. Historian Glen Bowersock described this massacre as a \"savage pogrom that the Jewish king of the Arabs launched against the Christians in the city of Najran. The king himself reported in excruciating detail to his Arab and Persian allies about the massacres that he had inflicted on all Christians who refused to convert to Judaism.\"\nEarly Middle Ages.\nViking invasion of Europe.\nViking invasions of European Anglo-Saxon land resulted in massacres and atrocities made by pagan Vikings against Christians. \nAccording to the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicles\", Viking raiders struck England in 793 and raided Lindisfarne, the monastery that held Saint Cuthbert's relics, killing the monks and capturing the valuables. The raid marked the beginning of the \"Viking Age of Invasion\".\nIn 793, when the monastery at Lindisfarne, an island off England's eastern coast, was sacked by a Viking raiding party on 8 June and Christian priests and monks were killed and massacred by Viking invaders.\"Lo, it is nearly 350 years that we and our fathers have inhabited this most lovely land, and never before has such a terror appeared as we have now suffered from a pagan race, nor was it thought that such an inroad from the sea could be made. Behold the church of St Cuthbert spattered with the blood of the priests of God, despoiled of all its ornaments.\"\nArchbishop Alcuin of York on the sacking of Lindisfarne and massacre of Christians by Viking polytheist pagans.\nChristians of Scotland killed by Vikings.\nThe following year, pagan Vikings sacked the nearby Monkwearmouth\u2013Jarrow Abbey. In 795, they once again attacked, this time raiding Iona Abbey off Scotland's west coast. This Christian monastery was attacked again in 802 and 806, when 68 Christian people living there were killed. After this devastation, the monastic community at Iona abandoned the site and fled to Kells in Ireland.\nCaliphates.\nRashidun Caliphate.\nSince they are considered \"People of the Book\" in the Islamic religion, Christians under Muslim rule were subjected to the status of \"dhimmi\" (along with Jews, Samaritans, Gnostics, Mandeans, and Zoroastrians), which was inferior to the status of Muslims. Christians and other religious minorities thus faced religious discrimination and persecution in that they were banned from proselytising (for Christians, it was forbidden to evangelize or spread Christianity) in the lands invaded by the Arab Muslims on pain of death, they were banned from bearing arms, undertaking certain professions, and were obligated to dress differently in order to distinguish themselves from Arabs. Under the Islamic law (\"shar\u012b\u02bfa\"), Non-Muslims were obligated to pay the \"jizya\" and \"kharaj\" taxes, together with periodic heavy ransom levied upon Christian communities by Muslim rulers in order to fund military campaigns, all of which contributed a significant proportion of income to the Islamic states while conversely reducing many Christians to poverty, and these financial and social hardships forced many Christians to convert to Islam. Christians unable to pay these taxes were forced to surrender their children to the Muslim rulers as payment who would sell them as slaves to Muslim households where they were forced to convert to Islam.\nAccording to the tradition of the Syriac Orthodox Church, the Muslim conquest of the Levant was a relief for Christians oppressed by the Western Roman Empire. Michael the Syrian, patriarch of Antioch, wrote later that the Christian God had \"raised from the south the children of Ishmael to deliver us by them from the hands of the Romans\". Various Christian communities in the regions of Palestine, Syria, Lebanon, and Armenia resented either the governance of the Western Roman Empire or that of the Byzantine Empire, and therefore preferred to live under more favourable economic and political conditions as \"dhimmi\" under the Muslim rulers. However, modern historians also recognize that the Christian populations living in the lands invaded by the Arab Muslim armies between the 7th and 10th centuries AD suffered religious persecution, religious violence, and martyrdom multiple times at the hands of Arab Muslim officials and rulers; many were executed under the Islamic death penalty for defending their Christian faith through dramatic acts of resistance such as refusing to convert to Islam, repudiation of the Islamic religion and subsequent reconversion to Christianity, and blasphemy towards Muslim beliefs.\nWhen Amr ibn al-As conquered Tripoli in 643, he forced the Jewish and Christian Berbers to give their wives and children as slaves to the Arab army as part of their \"jizya\".\nAround the year 666 C.E., Uqba ibn Nafi \u201cconquered the southern Tunisian cities... slaughtering all the Christians living there.\" Muslim sources report him waging countless raids, often ending with the complete ransacking and mass enslavement of cities.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Archaeological evidence from North Africa in the region of Cyrenaica points to the destruction of churches along the route the Islamic conquerors followed in the late seventh century, and the remarkable artistic treasures buried along the routes leading to the North of Spain by fleeing Visigoths and Hispano-Romans during the early eighth century consist largely of religious and dynastic paraphernalia that the Christian inhabitants obviously wanted to protect from Muslim looting and desecration.\nUmayyad Caliphate.\nAccording to the \u1e24anaf\u012b school of Islamic law (\"shar\u012b\u02bfa\"), the testimony of a Non-Muslim (such as a Christian or a Jew) was not considered valid against the testimony of a Muslim in legal or civil matters. Historically, in Islamic culture and traditional Islamic law, Muslim women have been forbidden from marrying Christian or Jewish men, whereas Muslim men have been permitted to marry Christian or Jewish women (\"see\": Interfaith marriage in Islam). Christians under Islamic rule had the right to convert to Islam or any other religion, while conversely a \"murtad\", or an apostate from Islam, faced severe penalties or even \"hadd\", which could include the death penalty.\nIn general, Christians subject to Islamic rule were allowed to practice their religion with some notable limitations stemming from the apocryphal \"Pact of Umar\". This treaty, supposedly enacted in 717 AD, forbade Christians from publicly displaying the cross on church buildings, from summoning congregants to prayer with a bell, from re-building or repairing churches and monasteries after they had been destroyed or damaged, and imposed other restrictions relating to occupations, clothing, and weapons. The Umayyad Caliphate persecuted many Berber Christians in the 7th and 8th centuries AD, who slowly converted to Islam.\nIn Umayyad al-Andalus (the Iberian Peninsula), the M\u0101lik\u012b school of Islamic law was the most prevalent. The martyrdoms of forty-eight Christian martyrs that took place in the Emirate of C\u00f3rdoba between 850 and 859 AD are recorded in the hagiographical treatise written by the Iberian Christian and Latinist scholar Eulogius of C\u00f3rdoba. The Martyrs of C\u00f3rdoba were executed under the rule of Abd al-Rahman II and Muhammad I, and Eulogius' hagiography describes in detail the executions of the martyrs for capital violations of Islamic law, including apostasy and blasphemy.\nAfter the Arab conquests, a number of Christian Arab tribes suffered enslavement and forced conversion. In the early eighth\u00a0century under the Umayyads, 63 out of a group of 70 Christian pilgrims from Iconium were captured, tortured, and executed under the orders of the Arab Governor of Ceaserea for refusing to convert to Islam (seven were forcibly converted to Islam under torture). Soon afterwards, sixty more Christian pilgrims from Amorium were crucified in Jerusalem.\nAlmoravid Caliphate.\nThe Almohads wreaked enormous destruction on the Christian population of Iberia. Tens of thousands of the native Christians in Iberia (Hispania) were deported from their ancestral lands to Africa by the Almoravids and Almohads. They suspected that the Christians could pose as a fifth column that could potentially help their coreligionists in the north of Iberia. Many Christians died en route to north Africa during these expulsions. \nChristians under the Almoravids suffered persecutions and mass expulsions to Africa. In 1099 the Almoravids sacked the great church of the city of Granada. In 1101 Christians fled from the city of Valencia to the Catholic kingdoms. In 1106 the Almoravids deported Christians from Malaga to Africa. In 1126, after a failed Christian rebellion in Granada, the Almoravids expelled the city's entire Christian population to Africa. And in 1138, Ibn Tashufin forcibly took many thousands of Christians with him to Africa.\nThe oppressed Mozarabs sent emissaries to the king of Aragon, Alphonso 1st le Batailleur (1104\u20131134), asking him to come to their rescue and deliver them from the Almoravids. Following the raid the king of Aragon launched in Andalusia in 1125\u201326 in responding to the pleas of Grenada's Mozarabs, the latter were deported en masse to Morocco in the fall of 1126. Another wave of expulsions to Africa took place 11 years later and as a result very very few Christians were left in Andalusia. Whatever was left of the Christian Catholic population in Granada was exterminated in the aftermath of a revolt against the Almohads in 1164. The Caliph Abu Yaqub Yusuf boasted that he had left no church or synagogue standing in al-Andalus.\nMuslim clerics in Al Andalus viewed Christians and Jews as unclean and dirty and feared that too much contact with them would contaminate Muslims. In Seville the faqih Ibn Abdun issued these regulations segregating people of the two faiths:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;A Muslim must not massage a Jew or a Christian nor throw away his refuse nor clean his latrines. The Jew and the Christian are better fitted for such trades, since they are the trades of those who are vile. A Muslim should not attend to the animal of a Jew or of a Christian, nor serve him as a muleteer [neither Catholics nor Jews could ride horses; only Muslims could], nor hold his stirrup. If any Muslim is known to do this, he should be denounced.\u2026 No \u2026 [unconverted] Jew or Christian must be allowed to dress in the costume of people of position, of a jurist, or of a worthy man [this provision echoes the Pact of Umar]. They must on the contrary be abhorred and shunned and should not be greeted with the formula, \u201cPeace be with you,\u201d for the devil has gained mastery over them and has made them forget the name of God. They are the devil's party, \u201cand indeed the devil's party are the losers\u201d (Qur\u2019an 57:22). They must have a distinguishing sign by which they are recognized to their shame [emphasis added].\nAbbasid Caliphate.\nThe Abbasid Caliphate was less tolerant of Christianity than had been the Umayyad caliphs. Nonetheless, Christian officials continued to be employed in the government, and the Christians of the Church of the East were often tasked with the translation of Ancient Greek philosophy and Greek mathematics. The writings of al-Jahiz attacked Christians for being too prosperous, and indicates they were able to ignore even those restrictions placed on them by the state. In the late 9th century, the patriarch of Jerusalem, Theodosius, wrote to his colleague the patriarch of Constantinople Ignatios that \"they are just and do us no wrong nor show us any violence\".\nElias of Heliopolis, having moved to Damascus from Heliopolis (Ba'albek), was accused of apostasy from Christianity after attending a party held by a Muslim Arab, and was forced to flee Damascus for his hometown, returning eight years later, where he was recognized and imprisoned by the \"eparch\", probably the jurist al-Layth ibn Sa'd. After refusing to convert to Islam under torture, he was brought before the Damascene \"emir\" and relative of the caliph al-Mahdi (r.\u2009775\u00a0\u2013\u00a0785), Muhammad ibn-Ibrahim, who promised good treatment if Elias would convert. On his repeated refusal, Elias was tortured and beheaded and his body burnt, cut up, and thrown into the river Chrysorrhoes (the Barada) in 779 AD.\nAccording to the \"Synaxarion of Constantinople\", the \"hegumenos\" Michael of Zobe and thirty-six of his monks at the Monastery of Zobe near Sebasteia (Sivas) were killed by a raid on the community. The perpetrator was the \"\"emir\" of the Hagarenes\", \"Alim\", probably Ali ibn-Sulayman, an Abbasid governor who raided Roman territory in 785 AD. Bacchus the Younger was beheaded in Jerusalem in 786\u2013787 AD. Bacchus was Palestinian, whose family, having been Christian, had been converted to Islam by their father. Bacchus however, remained crypto-Christian and undertook a pilgrimage to Jerusalem, upon which he was baptized and entered the monastery of Mar Saba. Reunion with his family prompted their reconversion to Christianity and Bacchus's trial and execution for apostasy under the governing \"emir\" Harthama ibn A'yan.\nAfter the 838 Sack of Amorium, the hometown of the emperor Theophilos (r.\u2009829\u00a0\u2013\u00a0842) and his Amorian dynasty, the caliph al-Mu'tasim (r.\u2009833\u00a0\u2013\u00a0842) took more than forty Roman prisoners. These were taken to the capital, Samarra, where after seven years of theological debates and repeated refusals to convert to Islam, they were put to death in March 845 under the caliph al-Wathiq (r.\u2009842\u00a0\u2013\u00a0847). Within a generation they were venerated as the 42 Martyrs of Amorium. According to their hagiographer Euodius, probably writing within a generation of the events, the defeat at Amorium was to be blamed on Theophilos and his iconoclasm. According to some later hagiographies, including one by one of several Middle Byzantine writers known as Michael the Synkellos, among the forty-two were Kallistos, the \"doux\" of the Koloneian \"thema\", and the heroic martyr Theodore Karteros.\nDuring the 10th-century phase of the Arab\u2013Byzantine wars, the victories of the Romans over the Arabs resulted in mob attacks on Christians, who were believed to sympathize with the Roman state. According to Bar Hebraeus, the \"catholicus\" of the Church of the East, Abraham III (r.\u2009906\u00a0\u2013\u00a0937), wrote to the grand vizier that \"we Nestorians are the friends of the Arabs and pray for their victories\". The attitude of the Nestorians \"who have no other king but the Arabs\", he contrasted with the Greek Orthodox Church, whose emperors he said \"had never cease to make war against the Arabs. Between 923 and 924, several Orthodox churches were destroyed in mob violence in Ramla, Ascalon, Caesarea Maritima, and Damascus. In each instance, according to the Arab Melkite Christian chronicler Eutychius of Alexandria, the caliph al-Muqtadir (r.\u2009908\u00a0\u2013\u00a0932) contributed to the rebuilding of ecclesiastical property.\nDuring the late 700s in the Abbasid Empire, Muslims destroyed two churches and a monastery near Bethlehem and slaughtered its monks. In 796, Muslims burned another twenty monks to death. In the years 809 and 813 AD, multiple monasteries, convents, and churches were attacked in and around Jerusalem; both male and female Christians were gang raped and massacred. In 929, on Palm Sunday, another wave of atrocities broke out; churches were destroyed and Christians slaughtered. al-Maqrizi records that in the year 936, \u201cthe Muslims in Jerusalem made a rising and burnt down the Church of the Resurrection [the Holy Sepulchre] which they plundered, and destroyed all they could of it\".\nAccording to the \"Synaxarion of Constantinople\", Dounale-Stephen, having journeyed to Jerusalem, continued his pilgrimage to Egypt, where he was arrested by the local \"emir\" and, refusing to relinquish his beliefs, died in jail c.\u2009950.\nWhen Abd Allah ibn Tahir went to besiege Kaisum, the fortress of Nasr: \"There had been great oppression in the whole country because the inhabitants [christian dhimmis] were forced to bring provisions to the camp; and in every place it was a time of famine and a dearth of all sorts of things.\" In order to rotect themselves from their attackers cannons, Nasr ibn Shabath and his Arab troops used a stratagem that had already been tried at the siege of Balis (using Christian women and children as human shields): they forced Christian women and their children to mount the walls so that they were exposed as targets for the Persians. Nasr used the same tactics at the second siege of Kaisum.\nByzantine Empire.\nGeorge Limnaiotes, a monk on Mount Olympus known only from the \"Synaxarion of Constantinople\" and other synaxaria, was supposed to have been 95 years old when he was tortured for his iconodulism. In the reign of Leo III the Isaurian (r.\u2009717\u00a0\u2013\u00a0741), he was mutilated by rhinotomy and his head burnt.\nGermanus I of Constantinople, a son of the \"patrikios\" Justinian, a courtier of the emperor Heraclius (r.\u2009610\u00a0\u2013\u00a0641), having been castrated and enrolled in the cathedral clergy of Hagia Sophia when his father was executed in 669, was later bishop of Cyzicus and then patriarch of Constantinople from 715. In 730, in the reign of Leo III (r.\u2009717\u00a0\u2013\u00a0741), Germanus was deposed and banished, dying in exile at Plantanion (Ak\u00e7aabat). Leo III also exiled the monk John the Psichaites, an iconodule, to Cherson, where he remained until after the emperor's death.\nAccording only to the \"Synaxarion of Constantinople\", the clerics Hypatios and Andrew from the Thracesian \"thema\" were, during the persecution of Leo III, brought to the capital, jailed and tortured. The \"Synaxarion\" says that they had the embers of burnt icons applied to their heads, subjected to other torments, and then dragged though the Byzantine streets to their public execution in the area of the city's VIIth Hill, the so-called near the Forum of Arcadius.\nAndrew of Crete was beaten and imprisoned in Constantinople after having debated with the iconoclast emperor Constantine V (r.\u2009741\u00a0\u2013\u00a0775), possibly in 767 or 768, and then abused by the Byzantines as he was dragged through the city, dying of blood loss when a fisherman cut off his foot in the Forum of the Ox. The church of Saint Andrew in Krisei was named after him, though his existence is doubted by scholars.\nHaving defeated and killed the emperor Nikephoros I (r.\u2009802\u00a0\u2013\u00a0811) at the Battle of Pliska in 811, the First Bulgarian Empire's \"khan\", Krum, also put to death a number of Roman soldiers who refused to renounce Christianity, though these martyrdoms, known only from the \"Synaxarion of Constantinople\", may be entierely legendary. In 813 the Bulgarians invaded the \"thema\" of Thrace, led by Krum, and the city of Adrianople (Edirne) was captured. Krum's successor Dukum died shortly after Krum himself, being succeeded by Ditzevg, who killed Manuel the archbishop of Adrianople in January 815. According to the \"Synaxarion of Constantinople\" and the \"Menologion of Basil II\", Ditzevg's own successor Omurtag killed some 380 Christians later that month. The victims included the archbishop of Develtos, George, and the bishop of Thracian Nicaea, Leo, as well as two \"strategoi\" called John and Leo. Collectively these are known as the Martyrs of Adrianople.\nThe Byzantine monk Makarios, of the Pelekete Monastery in Bithynia, having already refused an enviable position at court offered by the iconoclast emperor Leo IV the Khazar (r.\u2009775\u00a0\u2013\u00a0780) in return for the repudiation of his iconodulism, was expelled from the monastery by Leo V the Armenian (r.\u2009813\u00a0\u2013\u00a0820), who also imprisoned and exiled him. The patriarch Nikephoros I of Constantinople dissented from the iconoclast Council of Constantinople of 815 and was exiled by Leo V as a result. He died in exile in 828.\nIn spring 816, the Constantinopolitan monk Athanasios of Paulopetrion was tortured and exiled for his iconophilism by the emperor Leo V. In 815, during the reign of Leo V, having been appointed \"hegoumenos\" of the Kathara Monastery in Bithynia by the emperor Nikephoros I, John of Kathara was exiled and imprisoned first in Pentadactylon, a stronghold in Phrygia, and then in the fortress of Kriotauros in the Bucellarian \"thema\". In the reign of Michael II he was recalled, but exiled again under Theophilos, being banished to Aphousia (Av\u015fa) where he died, probably in 835.\nEustratios of Agauros, a monk and \"hegumenos\" of the Agauros Monastery at the foot of Mount Trichalikos, near Prusa's Mount Olympus in Bithynia, was forced into exile by the persecutions of Leo V and Theophilos (r.\u2009829\u00a0\u2013\u00a0842). Leo V and Theophilos also persecuted and exiled Hilarion of Dalmatos, the son of Peter the Cappadocian, who had been made \"hegumenos\" of the Dalmatos Monastery by the patriarch Nikephoros I. Hilarion was allowed to return to his post only in the regency of Theodora. The same emperors also persecuted Michael Synkellos, an Arab monk of the Mar Saba monastery in Palestine who, as the \"syncellus\" of the patriarch of Jerusalem, had travelled to Constantinople on behalf of the patriarch Thomas I. On the Triumph of Orthodoxy, Michael declined the ecumenical patriarchate and became instead the \"hegumenos\" of the Chora Monastery.\nAccording to Theophanes \"Continuatus\", the Armenian monk and iconographer of Khazar origin Lazarus Zographos refused to cease painting icons in the second official iconoclast period. Theophilos had him tortured and his hands burned with heated irons, though he was released at the intercession of the empress Theodora and hidden at the Monastery of John the Baptist \"tou Phoberou\", where he was able to paint an image of the patron saint. After the death of Theophilos, and the Triumph of Orthodoxy, Lazarus re-painted the representation of Christ on the Chalke Gate of the Great Palace of Constantinople.\nSymeon Stylites of Lesbos was persecuted for his iconodulism in the second period of official iconoclasm. He was imprisoned and exiled, returning to Lesbos only after the vernation of icons was restored in 842. The bishop George of Mytilene, who may have been Symeon's brother, was exiled from Constantinople in 815 on account of his iconophilia. He spent the last six years of his life in exile on an island, probably one of the Princes' Islands, dying in 820 or 821. George's relics were taken to Mytilene to be venerated after the restoration of iconodulism to orthodoxy under the patriarch Methodios I, during which the hagiography of George was written.\nThe bishop Euthymius of Sardis was the victim of several iconoclast Christian persecutions. Euthymius had previously been exiled to Pantelleria by the emperor Nikephoros I (r.\u2009802\u00a0\u2013\u00a0811), recalled in 806, led the iconodule resistance against Leo V (r.\u2009813\u00a0\u2013\u00a0820), and exiled again to Thasos in 814. After his recall to Constantinople in the reign of Michael II (r.\u2009820\u00a0\u2013\u00a0829), he was again imprisoned and exiled to Saint Andrew's Island, off Cape Akritas (Tuzla, Istanbul). According to the hagiography of by the patriarch Methodios I of Constantinople, who said he shared Euthymius's exile and been present at his death, Theoktistos and two other imperial officials personally whipped Euthymius to death on account of his iconodulism; Theoktistos was active in the persecution of iconodules under the iconoclast emperors, but later championed the iconodule cause. Theoktistos was later venerated as a saint in the Eastern Orthodox Church, listed in the \"Synaxarion of Constantinople\". The last of the iconoclast emperors, Theophilos (r.\u2009829\u00a0\u2013\u00a0842), was posthumously rehabilitated by the iconodule Orthodox Church on the intervention of his wife Theodora, who says he had had a deathbed conversion to iconodulism in the presence of Theoktistos and had given 60 Byzantine pounds of gold to each of his victims in his will. The rehabilitation of the iconoclast emperor was a precondition of his widow for convoking the Council of Constantinople in March 843, at which the veneration of icons was restored to orthodoxy and which became celebrated as the Triumph of Orthodoxy.\nEvaristos, a relative of Theoktistos Bryennios and a monk of the Monastery of Stoudios, was exiled to the Thracian Chersonese (Gallipoli peninsula) for his support of his \"hegumenos\" Nicholas and his patron the patriarch Ignatios of Constantinople when the latter was deposed by Photios I in 858. Both Nicholas and Evaristos went into exile. Only after many years was Evaristos allowed to return to Constantinople to found a monastery of his own. The \"hegumenos\" Nicholas, who had accompanied Evaristos to the Chersonese, was restored to his post at the Stoudios Monastery. A partisan of Ignatios of Constantinople and a refugee from the Muslim conquest of Sicily, the monk Joseph the Hymnographer was banished to Cherson from Constantinople on the elevation of Ignatios's rival Photios in 858. Only after the end of Photios's patriarchate was Joseph allowed to return to the capital and become the cathedral \"skeuophylax\" of Hagia Sophia.\nEuthymius, a monk, senator, and \"synkellos\" favored by Leo VI (r.\u2009870\u00a0\u2013\u00a0912), was first made a \"hegumenos\" and then in 907 patriarch of Constantinople by the emperor. When Leo VI died and Nicholas Mystikos was recalled to the patriarchal throne, Euthymius was exiled.\nHigh Middle Ages (1000\u20131200).\nFatimid Caliphate.\nThe caliph al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah (r.\u2009996\u00a0\u2013\u00a01021) engaged in a persecution of Christians. Al-Hakim was \"half-insane\", and had perpetrated the only general persecution of Christians by Muslims until the Crusades. Al-Hakim's mother was a Christian, and he had been raised mainly by Christians, and even through the persecution al-Hakim employed Christian ministers in his government. Between 1004 and 1014, the caliph produced legislation to confiscate ecclesiastical property and burn crosses; later, he ordered that small mosques be built atop church roofs, and later still decreed that churches were to be burned. The caliph's Jewish and Muslim subjects were subjected to similarly arbitrary treatment. As part of al-Hakim's persecution, thirty thousand churches were reportedly destroyed, and in 1009 the caliph ordered the demolition of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem, on the pretext that the annual Holy Fire miracle on Easter was a fake. The persecution of al-Hakim and the demolition of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre prompted Pope Sergius IV to issue a call for soldiers to expel the Muslims from the Holy Land, while European Christians engaged in a retaliatory persecution of Jews, whom they conjectured were in some way responsible for al-Hakim's actions. In the second half of the eleventh century, pilgrims brought home news of how the rise of the Turks and their conflict with the Egyptians increased the persecution of Christian pilgrims.\nIn 1013, at the intervention of the emperor Basil II (r.\u2009960\u00a0\u2013\u00a01025), Christians were given permission to leave Fatimid territory. In 1016 however, the caliph was proclaimed divine, alienating his Muslim subjects by banning the \"hajj\" and the fast of \"ramadan\", and causing him to again favor the Christians. In 1017, al-Hakim issued an order of toleration regarding Christians and Jews, while the following year confiscated ecclesiastical property was returned to the Church, including the construction materials seized by the authorities from demolished buildings.\nIn 1027, the emperor Constantine VIII (r.\u2009962\u00a0\u2013\u00a01028) concluded a treaty with Salih ibn Mirdas, the emir of Aleppo, allowing the emperor to repair the Church of the Holy Sepulchre and permitting the Christians forced to convert to Islam under al-Hakim to return to Christianity. Though the treaty was re-confirmed in 1036, actual building on the shrine began only in the later 1040s, under the emperor Constantine IX Monomachos (r.\u20091042\u00a0\u2013\u00a01055). According to al-Maqdisi, the Christians seemed largely in control of the Holy Land, and the emperor himself was rumored, according to Nasir Khusraw, to have been among the many Christian pilgrims that came to the Holy Sepulchre.\nSeljuk Empire.\nSultan\u00a0Alp Arslan\u00a0pledged: \u201cI shall consume with the sword all those people who venerate the cross, and all the lands of the Christians shall be enslaved.\u201d Alp Arslan ordered the Turks:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Henceforth all of you be like lion cubs and eagle young, racing through the countryside day and night, slaying the Christians and not sparing any mercy on the Roman nation\nIt was said that \u201cthe emirs spread like locusts, over the face of the land,\u201d invading every corner of Anatolia, sacking some of ancient Christianity's most important cities, including Ephesus, home of Saint John the Evangelist; Nicaea, where Christendom's creed was formulated in 325; and Antioch, the original see of Saint Peter, and enslaved many. \nDestruction and desecration of Churches became very widespread during the Turkic invasions of Anatolia which caused enormous damage to the ecclesiastical foundations throughout Asia minor:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Even before the battle of Manzikert, Turkish raids resulted in the pillaging of the famous churches of St. Basil at caesareia and of the Archangel Michael at Chonae. In the decade following 1071 the destruction of churches and the flight of the clergy became widespread. churches were often pillaged and destroyed. The churches of St. Phocas in Sinope and Nicholas at Myra, both important centers of pilgrimage, were destroyed. The monasteries of Mt. Latrus, Strobilus, and elanoudium on the western coast were sacked and the monks driven out during the early invasions, so that the monastic foundations in this area were completely abandoned until the Byzantine reconquest and the extensive support of successive Byzantine emperors once more reconstituted them. Greeks were forced to surround the church of St. John at Ephesus with walls to protect it from the Turks. The disruption of active religious life in the Cappadocian cave-monastic communies is also indicated for the twelfth century.\nNews of the great tribulation and persecutions of the eastern Christians reached European Christians in the west in the few years after the battle of Manzikert. A Frankish eyewitness says: \"Far and wide they [Muslim Turks] ravaged cities and castles together with their settlements. Churches were razed down to the ground. Of the clergyman and monks whom they captured, some were slaughtered while others were with unspeakable wickedness given up, priests and all, to their dire dominion and nuns\u2014alas for the sorrow of it!\u2014were subjected to their lusts.\" In a letter to count Robert of Flanders, Byzantine emperor Alexios I Komnenos writes:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The holy places are desecrated and destroyed in countless ways. Noble matrons and their daughters, robbed of everything, are violated one after another, like animals. Some [of their attackers] shamelessly place virgins in front of their own mothers and force them to sing wicked and obscene songs until they have finished having their ways with them... men of every age and description, boys, youths, old men, nobles, peasants and what is worse still and yet more distressing, clerics and monks and woe of unprecedented woes, even bishops are defiled with the sin of sodomy and it is now trumpeted abroad that one bishop has succumbed to this abominable sin.\nIn a poem, Malik Danishmend boasts: \"I am Al Ghazi Danishmend, the destroyer of churches and towers\". Destruction and pillaging of churches figure prominently in his poem. Another part of the poem talks about the simultaneous conversion of 5,000 people to Islam and the murder of 5,000 others.\nMichael the Syrian wrote: \u201cAs the Turks were ruling the lands of Syria and Palestine, they inflicted injuries on Christians who went to pray in Jerusalem, beat them, pillaged them, and levied the poll tax [jizya]. Every time they saw a caravan of Christians, particularly of those from Rome and the lands of Italy, they made every effort to cause their death in diverse ways\". Such was the fate German pilgrimage to Jerusalem in 1064. According to one of the surviving pilgrims:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Accompanying this journey was a noble abbess of graceful body and of a religious outlook. Setting aside the cares of the sisters committed to her and against the advice of the wise, she undertook this great and dangerous pilgrimage. The pagans captured her, and the sight of all, these shameless men raped her until she breathed her last, to the dishonor of all Christians. Christ's enemies performed such abuses and others like them on the christians.\nCrusades.\nAfter the Seljuks invaded Anatolia and the Levant, every Anatolian village they controlled along the route to Jerusalem began exacting tolls on Christian pilgrims. In principle the Seljuks allowed Christian pilgrims access to Jerusalem, but they often imposed huge ransoms and condoned local attacks against Christians. Many pilgrims were seized and sold into slavery while others were tortured (seemingly for entertainment). Soon only very large, well-armed and wealthy groups would dare attempt a pilgrimage, and even so, many died and many more turned back. The pilgrims that survived these extremely dangerous journeys, \u201creturned to the West weary and impoverished, with a dreadful tale to tell.\u201d\nIn the year 1064, 7,000 pilgrims led by Bishop Gunther of Bamberg were ambushed by Muslims near Caesarea Maritima, and two-thirds of the pilgrims were slaughtered.\nIn the Middle Ages, the crusades were promoted as defensive response of Christianity against persecution of Eastern Christianity in the Levant. Western Catholic contemporaries believed the First Crusade was a movement against Muslim attacks on Eastern Christians and Christian sites in the Holy Land. In the mid-11th century, relations between the Byzantine Empire and the Fatimid Caliphate and between Christians and Muslims were peaceful, and there had not been persecution of Christians since the death of al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah. As a result of the migration of Turkic peoples into the Levant and the Seljuk Empire's wars with the Fatimid Caliphate in the later 11th century, reports of Christian pilgrims increasingly mentioned persecution of Christians there. Similarly, accounts sent to the West of the Byzantines' medieval wars with various Muslim states alleged persecutions of Christians and atrocities against holy places. Western soldiers were encouraged to take up soldiering against the empire's Muslim enemies; a recruiting bureau was even established in London. After the 1071 Battle of Manzikert, the sense of Byzantine distress increased and Pope Gregory VII suggested that he himself would ride to the rescue at the head of an army, saying Christians were being \"slaughtered like cattle\". In the 1090s, the emperor Alexios I Komnenos (r.\u20091081\u00a0\u2013\u00a01118) issued appeals for help against the Seljuks to western Europe. In 1091 his ambassadors told the king of Croatia Muslims were destroying sacred sites, while his letter to Robert I, Count of Flanders, deliberately described emotively the rape and maltreatment of Christians and the sacrilege of the Jerusalem shrines.\nPope Urban II, who convoked the First Crusade at the 1095 Council of Clermont, spoke of the defense of his co-religionists in the Levant and the protection of the Christian holy places, while ordinary crusaders are also known to have been motivated by the notion of persecution of Christians by Muslims. According to Fulcher of Chartres, the pope described his holy wars as being , while the pope's own letters indicate that the Muslims were barbarians fanatically persecuting Christians. The same idea, expressed in similar language, was evident in the writings of the bishop Gerald of Cahors, the abbot Guibert of Nogent, the priest Peter Tudebode, and the monk Robert of Reims. Outside the clergy, the \"Gesta Francorum\"'s author likewise described the Crusaders' opponents as persecuting barbarians, language not used for non-Muslim non-Christians. These authors, together with Albert of Aix and Baldric of Dol, all referred to the Arabs, Saracens, and Turks as . Peter the Venerable, William of Tyre, and \"The Song of Roland\" all took the view that Muslims were barbarians, and in calling for the Third Crusade, Pope Gregory VIII expounded on the Muslim threat from Saladin, accusing the Muslims of being \"barbarians thirsting for the blood of Christians\". In numerous instances Pope Innocent III called on the Catholics to defend the Holy Land in a holy war against the . Crusaders believed that by fighting off the Muslims, the persecution of Christians would abate, in accordance to their god's will, and this ideology \u2013 much promoted by the Crusader-era propagandists \u2013 was shared at every level of literate medieval western European society.\nAccording to Guibert of Nogent, a Catholic writer, the persecution suffered by the Eastern Christians and the attacks on the empire by the Turks were caused by the Christians' own doctrinal errors. He said that \"Since they deviate from faith in the Trinity, so that hitherto they who are in filth become filthier, gradually they have come to the final degradation of having taken paganism upon themselves as the punishment for the sin proceeding from this, they have lost the soil of their native land to invading foreigners ...\". Western Christians considered the Byzantine position in the filioque controversy to be heresy and akin to Arianism; Guibert said that heresy was an Eastern practice, almost unknown in the Latin West. Further blame was attached to the Eastern Christians by the crusaders for the Crusade of 1101's defeats in Asia Minor; Alexios Komnenos was accused of having collaborated with the Turks to attack the crusaders. The Norman prince Bohemond, citing the supposed transgressions of the emperor and the Eastern Church, which the pope had declared heretic and whose doctrinal errors Bohemond blamed on Alexios, seized the Muslim-held and formerly Byzantine city of Antioch (Antakya) for himself after the Siege of Antioch and subsequent Battle of Antioch left Kerbogha defeated, becoming Bohemond I of the Principality of Antioch. This contravention of the agreement to return conquered lands to the emperor's control, was justified in the crusaders' letter to Pope Urban II by the statement that the Greek Christians were heretics. Later, Bohemond took the opportunity of a crusade to attack Dyrrachium (Durr\u00ebs), justifying his attack on the Christians in a letter to Pope Paschal II enumerating Alexios's faults and blaming him for the East\u2013West Schism and for having taken the imperial throne by force. Besides Guibert, other crusader writers to accuse Eastern Christians of sabotaging the crusade include Raymond of Aguilers, Albert of Aix, Baldric of Dol, and the author of the \"Gesta Francorum\". Alexios's departure from the crusade, followed by the departure of his envoy Tatikios, was seen as proof of the Eastern Christians' treachery. Though Fulcher of Chartres displayed a positive assessment of Eastern Christianity, he too accused the emperor of attacking Christian pilgrims, and of being a \"tyrant\".\nWhen First Crusade's Siege of Jerusalem ended successfully for the crusaders, the patriarchate of Jerusalem was vacant, and the crusaders elevated a Latin patriarch without reference to either the Roman Catholic or the Eastern Orthodox churches. An Orthodox candidate for the patriarchate was forced to flee to Constantinople. Only when Saladin's Siege of Jerusalem was concluded and the city was returned to Muslim control were the Orthodox Christians allowed to practise in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre.\nCrusade scholars continue to debate crusading, its causes, and its effects, so scholarship in this field repeatedly undergoes revision and reconsideration. Many early crusade scholars saw the source-histories as simple recitations of how events actually transpired, but by the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, scholarship was increasingly skeptical of that assumption. By 1935, Carl Erdmann published \"Die Entstehung des Kreuzzugsgedankens\" (The Origin of the Idea of Crusade), changing the direction of crusader studies more than any other single work by focusing on the ideology of crusade. This ideology indicated the crusades were essentially defensive, which meant that soldiers were there to provide protection for pilgrims and fellow Christians in the East and to reclaim formerly Christian lands lost to Islamic expansion and forced conversion. This ideology remained throughout the Middle Ages despite the failure to finalize these goals. Constable adds that those \"scholars who see the crusades as the beginning of European colonialism and expansionism would have surprised people at the time. Crusaders would not have denied some selfish aspects... but the predominant emphasis was on the defense and recovery of lands that had once been Christian and on the self-sacrifice rather than the self-seeking of the participants\".\nHistorian Robert Irwin points out that \u201cChristians living under Muslim rule suffered during the crusading period. They were suspected of acting as spies or fifth columns for the Franks and later the Mongols as well.\u201d According to Coptic chronicles, Saladin had many Christians in Egypt crucified in revenge against his Crusader enemies.\nIn 1951, Steven Runciman, a Byzantinist who saw the crusades in terms of east\u2013west relations, wrote in the conclusion of his crusade history, that the \"Holy War was nothing more than a long act of intolerance\". Giles Constable says it is this view of the crusades that is most common among the populace. The problem with this view, according to political science professor Andrew R. Murphy, is that such concepts as intolerance were not part of eleventh century thinking about relationships for any of the various groups involved in or affected by the crusades, neither the Latins, the Byzantines, the Turks, the Baybars, nor others. Instead, concepts of tolerance began to grow during the crusades from efforts to define legal limits and the nature of co-existence, and these ideas grew among both Christians and Muslims.\nThese wars produced multiple massacres perpetrated by both sides. According to Mary Jane Engh's definition of religious persecution, which identifies it as \"the repressive action initiated or condoned by authorities against their own people on religious grounds,\" it is not possible to term these acts of war as religious persecution.\nAfter the collapse of the Kingdom of Jerusalem and the Fall of Acre, the last of the Crusaders' possessions in Asia in 1291, one of the main Christian military orders was suppressed from 1307 on trumped-up charges by the papacy. The Knights Templar were accused of sodomy, heresy, and corruption and the members were persecuted. In the crusades waged against non-Muslims, including Christians described as heretics, Catholic participants were promised the same spiritual rewards as were believed to be received by those who fought against Muslims in the Holy Land.\nAlbigensian Crusade.\nPope Innocent III, with the king of France, Philip Augustus, began the military campaign known as the Albigensian Crusade between 1209 and 1226 against other Christians known as Cathars. Scholars disagree, using two distinct lines of reasoning, on whether the war that followed was religious persecution from the Pope or a land grab by King Philip. Historian Laurence W. Marvin says the Pope exercised \"little real control over events in Occitania\". Four years after the Massacre at Beziers in 1213, the Pope cancelled crusade indulgences and called for an end to the campaign. The campaign continued anyway. The Pope was not reversed until the Fourth Lateran council re-instituted crusade status two years later in 1215; afterwards, the Pope removed it yet again. The campaign continued in what Marvin refers to as \"an increasingly murky moral atmosphere\" for the next 16 years: there was technically no longer any crusade, no indulgences or dispensational rewards for fighting it, the papal legates exceeded their orders from the Pope, and the army occupied lands of nobles who were in the good graces of the church. The Treaty of Paris that ended the campaign left the Cathars still in existence, but awarded rule of Languedoc to Louis' descendants.\nNorthern (Baltic) crusades.\nThe Northern (or Baltic crusades), went on intermittently from 1147 to 1316, and the primary trigger for these wars was not religious persecution but instead was the noble's desire for territorial expansion and material wealth in the form of land, furs, amber, slaves, and tribute. The princes wanted to subdue these pagan peoples and stop their raiding by conquering and converting them, but ultimately, Iben Fonnesberg-Schmidt says, the princes were motivated by their desire to extend their power and prestige, and conversion was not always an element of their plans. When it was, conversion by these princes was almost always as a result of conquest, either by the direct use of force or indirectly when a leader converted and required it of his followers as well. \"While the theologians maintained that conversion should be voluntary, there was a widespread pragmatic acceptance of conversion obtained through political pressure or military coercion.\" The Church's acceptance of this led some commentators of the time to endorse and approve it, something Christian thought had never done before.\nIlkhanate.\nDuring the Ilkhanate, massacres were perpetrated by Hulagu Khan against the Assyrians, particularly in and around the ancient Assyrian city of Arbela (modern Erbil).\nBar Hebraeus provided this contemporary assessment of the Mongols attitudes toward their Christian subjects after their conversion to Islam: \u201cAnd having seen very much modesty and other habits of this kind among Christian people, certainly the Mongols loved them greatly at the beginning of their kingdom, a time ago somewhat short. But their love hath turned to such intense hatred that they cannot even see them with their eyes approvingly, because they have all alike become Muslims\". Things became worse when the khan, Mahmud Ghazan, (who converted to Islam in 1295) yielded to \u201cpopular pressure which compelled him to persecute Christians,\u201d and culminated in the following ordinance: \u201cThe churches shall be uprooted, and the altars overturned, and the celebrations of the Eucharist shall cease, and the hymns of praise, and the sounds of calls to prayer shall be abolished; and the heads of the Christians, and the heads of the congregations of the Jews, and the great men among them, shall be killed\".\nEmpowered by this ordinance and believing \u201cthat everyone who did not abandon Christianity and deny his faith should be killed,\u201d Muslim mobs ran amok, slaughtering and wreaking havoc among Christian populations. In Armenia, church services were banned and local authorities ordered to tattoo a black mark on the shoulder of every male Christian and to pluck out the beards and inflict other humiliations on every Christian man. \u201cWhen few Christians defected [to Islam] in response to these measures, the Khan then ordered that all Christian men be castrated and have one eye put out which caused many deaths in this era before antibiotics, but did lead to many conversions\u201d to Islam.\nThe consideration which the Mongols bestowed on the Christians (particularly the Nestorians) singled them out for the hatred of the Muslims. In 1261, Muslims of Mosul pillaged and killed all those who did not convert to Islam. Several monks and community leaders and others from the common people recanted. The Kurds then descended from the mountains and attacked the Christians of the region, massacring many of them; they pillaged the convent of Mar Matai, only withdrawing after extorting a heavy ransom from the monks.\nLate Middle Ages.\nWestern Europe.\nAdvocates of lay piety called for church reform and met with persecution from the Popes. John Wycliffe (1320\u20131384) urged the church to give up ownership of property, which produced much of the church's wealth, and to once again embrace poverty and simplicity. He urged the church to stop being subservient to the state and its politics. He denied papal authority. John Wycliff died of a stroke, but his followers, called \"Lollards\", were declared heretics. After the Oldcastle rebellion many were killed.\nJan Hus (1369\u20131415) accepted some of Wycliff's views and aligned with the Bohemian Reform movement which was also rooted in popular piety. In 1415, Hus was called to the Council of Constance where his ideas were condemned as heretical and he was handed over to the state and burned at the stake.\nThe Fraticelli, who were also known as the \"Little Brethren\" or \"Spiritual Franciscans\", were dedicated followers of Saint Francis of Assisi. These Franciscans honored their vow of poverty and saw the wealth of the Church as a contributor to corruption and injustice when so many lived in poverty. They criticized the worldly behavior of many churchmen. Thus, the Brethren were declared heretical by John XXII (1316\u20131334) who was called \"the banker of Avignon\".\nThe leader of these brethren, Bernard D\u00e9licieux (c. 1260\u20131270\u00a0\u2013 1320) was well known as he had spent much of his life battling the Dominican-run inquisitions. He confessed, after torture and threat of excommunication, to the charge of opposing the inquisitions, and was defrocked and sentenced to life in prison, in chains, in solitary confinement, and to receive nothing but bread and water. The judges attempted to ameliorate the harshness of this sentence due to his age and frailty, but Pope John XXII countermanded them and delivered the friar to Inquisitor Jean de Beaune. D\u00e9licieux died shortly thereafter in early 1320.\nMamluk Sultanate.\nwhen Sultan Baybars took Antioch from the Crusaders he wrote a letter to Christians boasting of the atrocities they would have seen his soldiers commit had they been there:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;You would have seen your knights prostrate beneath the horses\u2019 hooves, your houses stormed by pillagers and ransacked by looters, your wealth weighed by the quintal, your women sold four at a time and bought for a dinar of your own money! You would have seen the crosses in your churches smashed, the pages of the false Testaments scattered, the Patriarchs\u2019 tombs overturned. You would have seen your Muslim enemy trampling on the place where you celebrate the Mass, cutting the throats of monks, priests and deacons upon the altars, bringing sudden death to the Patriarchs and slavery to the royal princes. You would have seen fire running through your palaces, your dead burned in this world before going down to the fires of the next, your palace lying unrecognizable, the Church of St. Paul and that of the Cathedral of St. Peter pulled down and destroyed; then you would have said, \u201cWould that I were dust, and that no letter had ever brought me such tidings!\u201d\nTimurid Empire.\nTimur (Tamerlane) instigated large scale massacres of Christians in Mesopotamia, Persia, Asia Minor and Syria in the 14th century AD. Most of the victims were indigenous Assyrians and Armenians, members of the Assyrian Church of the East and Orthodox Churches, which led to the decimation of the hitherto majority Assyrian population in northern Mesopotamia and the abandonment of the ancient Assyrian city of Assur. Tamerlane virtually exterminated the Church of the East, which had previously been a major branch of Christianity but afterwards became largely confined to a small area now known as the Assyrian Triangle.\nEarly modern period.\nProtestant Reformation and Counter-Reformation.\nThe Protestant Reformation and the Roman Catholic Counter-Reformation provoked a number of persecutions of Christians by other Christians and the European wars of religion, including the Eighty Years' War, the French Wars of Religion, the Thirty Years' War, the Wars of the Three Kingdoms, the Savoyard\u2013Waldensian wars, and the Toggenburg War. There were false allegations of witchcraft and numerous witch trials in the early modern period.\nChina.\nBeginning in the late 17th century and for at least a century, Christianity was banned in China by the Kangxi Emperor of the Qing dynasty after Pope Clement XI forbade Chinese Catholics from venerating their relatives, Confucius, the Buddha or Guanyin.\nThe Boxer rebellion targeted foreign and Chinese Christians. Beginning in 1899, Boxers spread violence across Shandong and the North China Plain, attacking or murdering Christian missionaries and Chinese Christians. They decided the \"primary devils\" were the Christian missionaries, and the \"secondary devils\" were the Chinese converts to Christianity. Both had to recant or be driven out or killed. Boxers burned Christian churches, killed Chinese Christians and intimidated Chinese officials who stood in their way. Orthodox, Protestant, and Catholic missionaries and their Chinese parishioners were massacred throughout northern China, some by Boxers and others by government troops and authorities. Yuxian implemented a brutal anti-foreign and anti-Christian policy. The Baptist Missionary Society, based in England, opened its mission in Shanxi in 1877. In 1900 all its missionaries there were killed, along with all 120 converts. By the summer's end, more foreigners and as many as 2,000 Chinese Christians had been put to death in the province. Journalist and historical writer Nat Brandt has called the massacre of Christians in Shanxi \"the greatest single tragedy in the history of Christian evangelicalism.\" During the Boxer Rebellion as a whole, a total of 136 Protestant missionaries and 53 children were killed, and 47 Catholic priests and nuns, 30,000 Chinese Catholics, 2,000 Chinese Protestants, and 200 to 400 of the 700 Russian Orthodox Christians in Beijing were estimated to have been killed. Collectively, the Protestant dead were called the China Martyrs of 1900.\nThe Muslim unit Kansu Braves which was serving in the Chinese army attacked Christians.\nDuring the Northern Expedition, the Kuomintang incited anti-foreign, anti-Western sentiment. Portraits of Sun Yat-sen replaced the crucifix in several churches, KMT posters proclaimed that \"Jesus Christ is dead. Why not worship something alive such as Nationalism?\" Foreign missionaries were attacked and anti-foreign riots broke out. In 1926, Muslim General Bai Chongxi attempted to drive out foreigners in Guangxi, attacking American, European, and other foreigners and missionaries, and generally making the province unsafe for foreigners. Westerners fled from the province, and some Chinese Christians were also attacked as imperialist agents.\nFrom 1894 to 1938, many Uighur Muslims converted to Christianity. They were killed, tortured and jailed. Christian missionaries were expelled.\nFrench Revolution.\nThe dechristianisation of France during the French Revolution is a conventional description of a campaign, conducted by various Robespierre-era governments of France beginning with the start of the French Revolution in 1789, to eliminate any symbol that might be associated with the past, especially the monarchy.\nThe program included the following policies:\nThe climax was reached with the celebration of the Goddess \"Reason\" in Notre-Dame de Paris, the Parisian cathedral, on 10 November.\nUnder threat of death, imprisonment, military conscription or loss of income, about 20,000 constitutional priests were forced to abdicate or hand over their letters of ordination and 6,000\u00a0\u2013 9,000 were coerced to marry, many ceasing their ministerial duties. Some of those who abdicated covertly ministered to the people. By the end of the decade, approximately 30,000 priests were forced to leave France, and thousands who did not leave were executed. Most of France was left without the services of a priest, deprived of the sacraments and any nonjuring priest faced the guillotine or deportation to French Guiana.\nThe March 1793 conscription requiring Vendeans to fill their district's quota of 300,000 enraged the populace, who took up arms as \"The Catholic Army\", \"Royal\" being added later, and fought for \"above all the reopening of their parish churches with their former priests.\" \nWith these massacres came formal orders for forced evacuation; also, a 'scorched earth' policy was initiated: farms were destroyed, crops and forests burned and villages razed. There were many reported atrocities and a campaign of mass killing universally targeted at residents of the Vend\u00e9e regardless of combatant status, political affiliation, age or gender. By July 1796, the estimated Vendean dead numbered between 117,000 and 500,000, out of a population of around 800,000.\nJapan.\nTokugawa Ieyasu assumed control over Japan in 1600. Like Toyotomi Hideyoshi, he disliked Christian activities in Japan. The Tokugawa shogunate finally decided to ban Catholicism in 1614, and in the mid-17th century it demanded the expulsion of all European missionaries and the execution of all converts. This marked the end of open Christianity in Japan. The Shimabara Rebellion, led by a young Japanese Christian boy named Amakusa Shir\u014d Tokisada, took place in 1637. After the Hara Castle fell, the shogunate's forces beheaded an estimated 37,000 rebels and sympathizers. Amakusa Shir\u014d's severed head was taken to Nagasaki for public display, and the entire complex at Hara Castle was burned to the ground and buried together with the bodies of all the dead.\nMany of the Christians in Japan continued for two centuries to maintain their religion as Kakure Kirishitan, or hidden Christians, without any priests or pastors. Some of those who were killed for their Faith are venerated as the Martyrs of Japan.\nChristianity was later allowed during the Meiji era. The Meiji Constitution of 1890 introduced separation of church and state and permitted freedom of religion.\nKingdom of Mysore.\nMuslim Tipu Sultan, the ruler of the Kingdom of Mysore, took action against the Mangalorean Catholic community from Mangalore and the South Canara district on the southwestern coast of India. Tipu was widely reputed to be anti-Christian. He took Mangalorean Catholics into captivity at Seringapatam on 24 February 1784 and released them on 4 May 1799.\nSoon after the Treaty of Mangalore in 1784, Tipu gained control of Canara. He issued orders to seize the Christians in Canara, confiscate their estates, and deport them to Seringapatam, the capital of his empire, through the Jamalabad fort route. There were no priests among the captives. Together with Fr. Miranda, all the 21 arrested priests were issued orders of expulsion to Goa, fined 20,000,000 (2 lakh) rupees, and threatened death by hanging if they ever returned. Tipu ordered the destruction of 27 Catholic churches.\nAccording to Thomas Munro, a Scottish soldier and the first collector of Canara, around 60,000 of them, nearly 92\u00a0percent of the entire Mangalorean Catholic community, were captured. 7,000 escaped. Observer Francis Buchanan reports that 70,000 were captured, from a population of 80,000, with 10,000 escaping. They were forced to climb nearly through the jungles of the Western Ghat mountain ranges. It was from Mangalore to Seringapatam, and the journey took six weeks. According to British Government records, 20,000\u00a0 of them died on the march to Seringapatam. According to James Scurry, a British officer, who was held captive along with Mangalorean Catholics, 30,000\u00a0of them were forcibly converted to Islam. The young women and girls were forcibly made wives of the Muslims living there and later distributed and sold in prostitution. The young men who offered resistance were disfigured by cutting their noses, upper lips, and ears.\nTipu Sultan's invasion of the Malabar Coast had an adverse impact on the Saint Thomas Christian community of the Malabar coast. Many churches in Malabar and Cochin were damaged. The old Syrian Nasrani seminary at Angamaly which had been the center of Catholic religious education for several centuries was razed to the ground by Tipu's soldiers. Many centuries-old religious manuscripts were lost forever. The church was later relocated to Kottayam where it still exists to this date. The Mor Sabor church at Akaparambu and the Martha Mariam Church attached to the seminary were destroyed as well. Tipu's army set fire to the church at Palayoor and attacked the Ollur Church in 1790. Furthernmore, the Arthat church and the Ambazhakkad seminary was also destroyed. Over the course of this invasion, many Saint Thomas Christians were killed or forcibly converted to Islam. Most of the coconut, arecanut, pepper and cashew plantations held by the Saint Thomas Christian farmers were also indiscriminately destroyed by the invading army. As a result, when Tipu's army invaded Guruvayur and adjacent areas, the Syrian Christian community fled Calicut and small towns like Arthat to new centres like Kunnamkulam, Chalakudi, Ennakadu, Cheppadu, Kannankode, Mavelikkara, etc. where there were already Christians. They were given refuge by Sakthan Tamburan, the ruler of Cochin and Karthika Thirunal, the ruler of Travancore, who gave them lands, plantations and encouraged their businesses. Colonel Macqulay, the British resident of Travancore also helped them.\nTipu's persecution of Christians also extended to captured British soldiers. For instance, there were a significant amount of forced conversions of British captives between 1780 and 1784. Following their disastrous defeat at the battle of Pollilur, 7,000 British men along with an unknown number of women were held captive by Tipu in the fortress of Seringapatnam. Of these, over 300 were circumcised and given Muslim names and clothes, and several British regimental drummer boys were made to wear \"ghagra cholis\" and entertain the court as \"nautch\" girls or dancing girls. According to James Scurry, who had been jailed, he gained an inability to use western cutlery, a change in his preferred clothing, a darker skin tone, and having \"\"broken and confused\" English that no longer had \"all its vernacular idiom\". Scurry had a confinement period of 10 years.\nOttoman Empire.\nHistorian Warren Treadgold gives a summary on the historical background highlighting the cumulative effects of the relentless Turkish Muslim depredations against the Byzantine Empire in its Anatolian heartland by the late 14th century:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;As the Turks raided and conquered, they enslaved many Christians, selling some in other Muslim regions and hindering the rest from practicing their faith. Conversions [to islam], Turkish migration, and Greek outmigration increasingly endangered the Greek minority in central Asia Minor. When the Turks overran Western Anatolia, they occupied the countryside first, driving the Greeks into the cities, or away to Europe, or the islands. By the time the Anatolian cities fell, the land around them was already largely Turkish [and Islamic].\nIn accordance with the traditional custom which was practiced at the time, Sultan Mehmed II allowed his troops and his entourage to engage in unbridled pillaging and looting in the city of Constantinople for three full days shortly after it was captured. Once the three days passed, he claimed its remaining contents for himself. However, at the end of the first day, he proclaimed that the looting should cease because he felt profound sadness when he toured the looted and enslaved city. Hagia Sophia was not exempted from the pillage and looting and specifically became its focal point as the invaders believed it to contain the greatest treasures and valuables of the city. Shortly after the defence of the Walls of Constantinople collapsed and the Ottoman troops entered the city victoriously, the pillagers and looters made their way to the Hagia Sophia and battered down its doors before storming in.\nThroughout the period of the siege of Constantinople, the worshippers who were trapped in the city participated in the Divine Liturgy and they also recited the Prayer of the Hours at the Hagia Sophia and the church formed a safe-haven and a refuge for many of those worshippers who were unable to contribute to the city's defence, which comprised women, children, elderly, the sick and the wounded. Being trapped in the church, the many congregants and yet more refugees inside became spoils-of-war to be divided amongst the triumphant invaders. The building was desecrated and looted, with the helpless occupants who sought shelter within the church being enslaved. While most of the elderly and the infirm/wounded and sick were killed, and the remainder (mainly teenage males and young boys) were chained up and sold into slavery.\nThe women of Constantinople also suffered from rape at the hands of Ottoman forces. According to Barbaro, \"all through the day the Turks made a great slaughter of Christians through the city\". According to historian Philip Mansel, widespread persecution of the city's civilian inhabitants took place, resulting in thousands of murders and rapes, and 30,000 civilians being enslaved or forcibly deported. George Sphrantzes says that people of both genders were raped inside Hagia Sophia.\nSince the time of the Austro-Turkish war (1683\u20131699), relations between Muslims and Christians who lived in the European provinces of the Ottoman Empire gradually deteriorated and this deterioration in interfaith relations occasionally resulted in calls for the expulsion or extermination of local Christian communities by some Muslim religious leaders. As a result of Ottoman oppression, the destruction of Churches and Monasteries, and violence against the non-Muslim civilian population, Serbian Christians and their church leaders, headed by Serbian Patriarch Arsenije III, sided with the Austrians in 1689 and again in 1737 under Serbian Patriarch Arsenije IV. In the following punitive campaigns, Ottoman forces conducted systematic atrocities against the Christian population in the Serbian regions, resulted in the Great Migrations of the Serbs.\nOttoman Albania and Kosovo.\nBefore the late 16th century, Albania's population remained overwhelmingly Christian, despite the fact that it was under Ottoman rule, unlike the more diverse populations of other regions of the Ottoman Empire, such as Bosnia, Bulgaria and Northern Greece, the mountainous Albania was a frequent site of revolts against Ottoman rule, often at an enormous human cost, such as the destruction of entire villages. In response, the Ottomans abandoned their usual policy of tolerating Christians in favor of a policy which was aimed at reducing the size of Albania's Christian population through Islamization, beginning in the restive Christian regions of Reka and Elbasan in 1570.\nThe pressures which resulted from this campaign included particularly harsh economic conditions which were imposed on Albania's Christian population; while earlier taxes on the Christians were around 45 \"ak\u00e7es\" a year, by the middle of the 17th century the rate had been multiplied by 27 to 780 \"ak\u00e7es\" a year. Albanian elders often opted to save their clans and villages from hunger and economic ruin by advocating village-wide and region-wide conversions to Islam, with many individuals frequently continuing to practice Christianity in private.\nA failed Catholic rebellion in 1596 and the Albanian population's support of Austro-Hungary during the Great Turkish War, and its support of the Venetians in the 1644 Venetian-Ottoman War as well as the Orlov Revolt were all factors which led to punitive measures in which outright force was accompanied by economic incentives depending on the region, and ended up forcing the conversion of large Christian populations to Islam in Albania. In the aftermath of the Great Turkish War, massive punitive measures were imposed on Kosovo's Catholic Albanian population and as a result of them, most members of it fled to Hungary and settled around Buda, where most of them died of disease and starvation.\nAfter the Orthodox Serbian population's subsequent flight from Kosovo, the pasha of Ipek (Peja/Pec) forced Albanian Catholic mountaineers to repopulate Kosovo by deporting them to Kosovo, and also forced them adopt Islam. In the 17th and 18th centuries, South Albania also saw numerous instances of violence which was directed against those who remained Christian by local newly converted Muslims, ultimately resulting in many more conversions out of fear as well as flight to faraway lands by the Christian population.\nModern era (1815 to 1989).\nCommunist Albania.\nReligion in Albania was subordinated to the interests of Marxism during the rule of the country's communist party when all religions were suppressed. This policy was justified by the communist stance of state atheism from 1967 to 1991. The Agrarian Reform Law of August 1945 nationalized most of the property which belonged to religious institutions, including the estates of mosques, monasteries, religious orders, and dioceses. Many clergy and believers were tried and some of them were executed. All foreign Roman Catholic priests, monks, and nuns were expelled from Albania in 1946. The military seized churches, cathedrals and mosques and converted them into basketball courts, movie theaters, dance halls, and the like; and members of the clergy were stripped of their titles and imprisoned. Around 6,000 Albanians were disappeared and murdered by agents of the Communist government, and their bodies were never found or identified. Albanians continued to be imprisoned, tortured and killed for their religious practices well into 1991.\nReligious communities or branches of them which had their headquarters outside the country, such as the Jesuit and Franciscan orders, were henceforth ordered to terminate their activities in Albania. Religious institutions were forbidden to have anything to do with the education of the young, because that activity had been made the exclusive province of the state. All religious communities were prohibited from owning real estate and they were also prohibited from operating philanthropic and welfare institutions and hospitals. Enver Hoxha's overarching goal was the eventual destruction of all organized religions in Albania, despite some variance in his approach to it.\nIraq.\nThe Assyrians were subjected to another series of persecutions during the Simele massacre of 1933, with the death of approximately 3,000 Assyrian civilians in the Kingdom of Iraq at the hands of the Royal Iraqi Army.\nIn 1987, the last Iraqi census counted 1.4\u00a0million Christians. They were tolerated under the secular regime of Saddam Hussein, who even made one of them, Tariq Aziz his deputy. However, Saddam Hussein's government continued to persecute the Christians on an ethnic, cultural and racial basis, because the vast majority are Mesopotamian Eastern Aramaic-speaking ethnic Assyrians (aka Chaldo-Assyrians). The Assyro-Aramaic language and script was repressed, the giving of Hebraic/Aramaic Christian names or Akkadian/Assyro-Babylonian names was forbidden (for example Tariq Aziz's real name was Michael Youhanna), and Saddam exploited religious differences between Assyrian denominations such as Chaldean Catholics, the Assyrian Church of the East, the Syriac Orthodox Church, the Assyrian Pentecostal Church and the Ancient Church of the East, in an attempt to divide them. Many Assyrians and Armenians were ethnically cleansed from their towns and villages during the al Anfal Campaign in 1988, despite the fact that this campaign was primarily directed against the Kurds.\nMadagascar.\nQueen Ranavalona I (reigned 1828\u20131861) issued a royal edict prohibiting the practice of Christianity in Madagascar, expelled British missionaries from the island, and sought to stem the growth of conversion to Christianity within her realm. Far more, however, were punished in other ways: many were required to undergo the \"tangena\" ordeal, while others were condemned to hard labor or the confiscation of their land and property, and many of these consequently died. The tangena ordeal was commonly administered to determine the guilt or innocence of an accused person for any crime, including the practice of Christianity, and involved ingestion of the poison contained within the nut of the tangena tree (\"Cerbera odollam\"). Survivors were deemed innocent, while those who perished were assumed guilty.\nIn 1838, it was estimated that as many as 100,000 people in Imerina died as a result of the \"tangena\" ordeal, constituting roughly 20% of the population. contributing to a strongly unfavorable view of Ranavalona's rule in historical accounts. Malagasy Christians would remember this period as \"ny tany maizina\", or \"the time when the land was dark\". Persecution of Christians intensified in 1840, 1849 and 1857; in 1849, deemed the worst of these years by British missionary to Madagascar W.E. Cummins (1878), 1,900 people were fined, jailed or otherwise punished in relation to their Christian faith, including 18 executions.\nNazi Germany.\nHitler and the Nazis received some support from certain Christian communities, in particular the German Christian movement within the German Evangelical Church. Once in power, the Nazis moved to consolidate their power over the German churches and bring them in line with Nazi ideals. Some historians say that Hitler had a general covert plan, which some of them say existed even before the Nazis' rise to power, to destroy Christianity within the Reich, which was to be accomplished through Nazi control and subversion of the churches and it would be completed after the war. The Third Reich founded its own version of Christianity which was called Positive Christianity, a Nazi version of Christianity which made major changes in the interpretation of the Bible by arguing that Jesus Christ was the son of God, but he was not a Jew, arguing that Jesus despised Jews and Judaism, and arguing that the Jews were the ones who were solely responsible for Jesus's death.\nOutside mainstream Christianity, the Jehovah's Witnesses were targets of Nazi Persecution, for their refusal to swear allegiance to the Nazi government. In Nazi Germany in the 1930s and early 1940s, Jehovah's Witnesses refused to renounce their political neutrality and as a result, they were imprisoned in concentration camps. The Nazi government gave detained Jehovah's Witnesses the option of release if they signed a document which indicated their renunciation of their faith, their submission to state authority, and their support of the German military. Historian Hans Hesse said, \"Some five thousand Jehovah's Witnesses were sent to concentration camps where they alone were 'voluntary prisoners', so termed because the moment they recanted their views, they could be freed. Some lost their lives in the camps, but few renounced their faith.\"\nOttoman Empire.\nDuring the modern era, relations between Muslims and Christians in the Ottoman Empire were largely shaped by broader dynamics which were related to European colonial and neo-imperialist activities in the region, dynamics which frequently (though by no means always) generated tensions between the two communities. Too often, growing European influence in the region during the nineteenth century seemed to disproportionately benefit Christians, thus, it triggered resentment on the part of many Muslims, likewise, many Muslims suspected that Christians and the European powers were plotting to weaken the Islamic world. Further exacerbating relations was the fact that Christians seemed to disproportionately benefit from efforts at reform (one aspect of which generally sought to elevate the political status of non-Muslims), likewise, the various Christian nationalist uprisings in the Empire's European territories, which often had the support of the European powers. Persecutions and forced migrations of Christian populations were induced by Ottoman forces during the 19th century in the European and Asian provinces of the Ottoman Empire. The Massacres of Badr Khan were conducted by Kurdish and Ottoman forces against the Assyrian Christian population of the Ottoman Empire between 1843 and 1847, resulting in the slaughter of more than 10,000 indigenous Assyrian civilians of the Hakkari region, with many thousands more being sold into slavery.\nOn 17 October 1850 the Muslim majority began rioting against the Uniate Catholics \u2013 a minority that lived in the communities of Judayda, in the city of Aleppo.\nDuring the Bulgarian Uprising against Ottoman rule (1876), and the Russo-Turkish War (1877\u20131878), the persecution of the Bulgarian Christian population was conducted by Ottoman soldiers. The principal locations were Panagurishte, Perushtitza, and Bratzigovo. Over 15,000 non-combatant Bulgarian civilians were killed by the Ottoman army between 1876 and 1878, with the worst single instance being the Batak massacre.\nDuring the war, whole cities including the largest Bulgarian one (Stara Zagora) were destroyed and most of their inhabitants were killed, the rest being expelled or enslaved. The atrocities included impaling and grilling people alive. Similar attacks were undertaken by Ottoman troops against Serbian Christians during the Serbian-Turkish War (1876\u20131878).\nThe abolition of \"jizya\" and emancipation of formerly \"dhimmi\" subjects was one of the most embittering stipulations the Ottoman Empire had to accept to end the Crimean War in 1856. Then, \"for the first time since 1453, church bells were permitted to ring... in Constantinople,\" writes M. J. Akbar. \"Many Muslims declared it a day of mourning.\" Indeed, because superior social standing was from the start one of the advantages of conversion to Islam, resentful Muslim mobs rioted and hounded Christians all over the empire. In 1860 up to 30,000 Christians were massacred in the Levant alone.\nMark Twain recounts what took place in the levant:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Men, women and children were butchered indiscriminately and left to rot by hundreds all through the Christian quarter... the stench was dreadful. All the Christians who could get away fled from the city, and the Mohammedans would not defile their hands by burying the 'infidel dogs.' The thirst for blood extended to the high lands of Hermon and Anti-Lebanon, and in a short time twenty-five thousand more Christians were massacred.\nBetween 1894 and 1896, a series of ethno-religiously motivated anti-Christian pogroms known as the Hamidian massacres were conducted against the ancient Armenian and Assyrian Christian populations by the forces of the Ottoman Empire. The motives for these massacres were an attempt to reassert Pan-Islamism in the Ottoman Empire, resentment of the comparative wealth of the ancient indigenous Christian communities, and a fear that they would attempt to secede from the tottering Ottoman Empire. The massacres mainly took place in what is today southeastern Turkey, northeastern Syria and northern Iraq. Assyrians and Armenians were massacred in Diyarbakir, Hasankeyef, Sivas and other parts of Anatolia and northern Mesopotamia, by Sultan Abdul Hamid II. The death toll is estimated to have been as high as 325,000 people, with a further 546,000 Armenians and Assyrians made destitute by forced deportations of survivors from cities, and the destruction or theft of almost 2500 of their farmsteads towns and villages. Hundreds of churches and monasteries were also destroyed or forcibly converted into mosques. These attacks caused the death of over thousands of Assyrians and the forced \"Ottomanisation\" of the inhabitants of 245 villages. The Ottoman troops looted the remains of the Assyrian settlements and these were later stolen and occupied by south-east Anatolian tribes. Unarmed Assyrian women and children were raped, tortured and murdered. According to H. Aboona, the independence of the Assyrians was destroyed not directly by the Turks but by their neighbours under Ottoman auspices.\nThe Adana massacre occurred in the Adana Vilayet of the Ottoman Empire in April 1909. A massacre of Armenian and Assyrian Christians in the city of Adana and its surrounds amidst the 31 March Incident led to a series of anti-Christian pogroms throughout the province. Reports estimated that the Adana Province massacres resulted in the death of as many as 30,000 Armenians and 1,500 Assyrians.\nBetween 1915 and 1921 the Young Turks government of the collapsing Ottoman Empire persecuted Eastern Christian populations in Anatolia, Persia, Northern Mesopotamia, and The Levant. The onslaught by the late Ottoman army (which included Arab, Kurdish, and Circassian irregulars) resulted in an estimated 3.4\u00a0million deaths, divided between roughly 1.5\u00a0million Armenian Christians, 0.75 million Assyrian Christians, 0.90\u00a0million Greek Orthodox Christians, and 0.25\u00a0million Maronite Christians (see Great Famine of Mount Lebanon); groups of Georgian Christians were also killed. The massive ethno-religious cleansing expelled from the empire or killed the Assyrians, Armenians, Greeks, and Bulgarians who had not converted to Islam, and it came to be known as the Armenian genocide, Assyrian genocide, Greek genocide, and Great Famine of Mount Lebanon. which accounted for the deaths of Armenian, Assyrian, Greek and Maronite Christians, and the deportation and destitution of many more. The Genocide led to the devastation of ancient indigenous Christian populations who had inhabited the Middle East for thousands of years.\nBenny Morris, Dror Ze'evi, U\u011fur \u00dcmit \u00dcng\u00f6r, and several other historians argue that the Armenian genocide, Greek genocide, and Assyrian genocide constitute a series of extermination campaigns, usually referred to as the late Ottoman genocides, that had been carried out by the Ottoman Empire against its Christian subjects.\nIn the aftermath of the Sheikh Said rebellion, the Syriac Orthodox Church, and the Assyrian Church of the East were subjected to harassment by Turkish authorities, on the grounds that some Assyrians allegedly collaborated with the rebelling Kurds. Consequently, mass deportations took place and Assyrian Patriarch Mar Ignatius Elias III was expelled from the Mor Hananyo Monastery which was turned into a Turkish barrack. The patriarchal seat was then temporarily transferred to Homs.\nTurkey.\nThe Republic of Turkey was established in 1923, after the vast majority of Christian inhabitants of Anatolia had been expelled and massacred as a result of the late Ottoman genocides. However, there still remained sizeable Greek and Armenian minorities in Istanbul. Beginning in the 1940s, the Turkish government instituted repressive policies forcing many Christians to emigrate. Examples are the labour battalions drafted among non-Muslims during World War II, as well as the Fortune Tax levied mostly on non-Muslims during the same period. These resulted in financial ruination and death for many Christians. The exodus was given greater impetus with the Istanbul Pogrom of September 1955 and the expulsion of Istanbul Greeks which led to thousands of Greeks fleeing the city, eventually reducing the Greek population from 200,000 in 1924 to about 7,000 by 1978 and to about 2,500 by 2006.\nSoviet Union.\nAfter the Russian Revolution of 1917, the Bolsheviks undertook a massive program to remove the influence of the Russian Orthodox Church from the government, outlawed antisemitism in society, and promoted atheism. Tens of thousands of churches were destroyed or they were converted to buildings which were used for other purposes, and many members of the clergy were murdered, publicly executed and imprisoned for what the government termed \"anti-government activities\". An extensive educational and propaganda campaign was launched to convince people, especially children and youths, to abandon their religious beliefs. This persecution resulted in the intentional murder of 500,000 Orthodox followers by the government of the Soviet Union during the 20th century. In the first five years after the Bolshevik revolution, 28 bishops and 1,200 priests were executed.\nThe state established atheism as the only scientific truth. Soviet authorities forbade the criticism of atheism and agnosticism until 1936 or of the state's anti-religious policies; such criticism could lead to forced retirement. Militant atheism became central to the ideology of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and a high priority policy of all Soviet leaders. Christopher Marsh, a professor at the Baylor University writes that \"Tracing the social nature of religion from Schleiermacher and Feurbach to Marx, Engles, and Lenin...the idea of religion as a social product evolved to the point of policies aimed at the forced conversion of believers to atheism.\"\nUnder the doctrine of state atheism in the Soviet Union, a \"government-sponsored program of forced conversion to atheism\" was conducted by the Communists. The Communist Party destroyed churches, mosques and temples, ridiculed, harassed, incarcerated and executed religious leaders, flooded the schools and media with anti-religious teachings, and it introduced a belief system called \"scientific atheism\", with its own rituals, promises and proselytizers. Many priests were killed and imprisoned; thousands of churches were closed. In 1925 the government founded the League of Militant Atheists to intensify the persecution. The League of Militant Atheists was also a \"nominally independent organization established by the Communist Party to promote atheism\".\nThe Communist regime confiscated church property, ridiculed religion, harassed believers, and propagated atheism in the schools. Actions against particular religions, however, were determined by State interests, and most organized religions were never outlawed. It is estimated that 500,000 Russian Orthodox Christians were martyred in the gulags by the Soviet government, excluding the members of other Christian denominations who were also tortured or killed.\nThe main target of the anti-religious campaign in the 1920s and 1930s was the Russian Orthodox Church, which had the largest number of faithful worshippers. A very large segment of its clergy, and many of its believers, were shot or sent to labor camps. Theological schools were closed, and church publications were prohibited. In the period between 1927 and 1940, the number of Orthodox Churches in the Russian Republic fell from 29,584 to less than 500. Between 1917 and 1940, 130,000 Orthodox priests were arrested. The widespread persecution and internecine disputes within the church hierarchy led to the seat of Patriarch of Moscow being vacant from 1925 to 1943.\nAfter Operation Barbarossa, Nazi Germany's invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941, Joseph Stalin revived the Russian Orthodox Church in order to intensify the Soviet population's patriotic support of the war effort. By 1957, about 22,000 Russian Orthodox churches had become active. But in 1959, Nikita Khrushchev initiated his own campaign against the Russian Orthodox Church and forced about 12,000 churches to close. By 1985, fewer than 7,000 churches remained active.\nIn the Soviet Union, in addition to the methodical closure and destruction of churches, the charitable and social work which was formerly done by ecclesiastical authorities was taken over by the state. As with all private property, Church owned property was confiscated and converted to public use by the state. The few places of worship which were left to the Church were legally viewed as state property which the government permitted the church to use. After the advent of state funded universal education, the Church was not permitted to carry on educational, instructional activity for children. For adults, only training for church-related occupations was allowed. With the exception of sermons which could be delivered during the celebration of the divine liturgy, it could not instruct the faithful nor could it evangelize the youth. Catechism classes, religious schools, study groups, Sunday schools and religious publications were all declared illegal and banned. This caused many religious tracts to be circulated as illegal literature or \"samizdat\". Even after the death of Stalin in 1953, the persecution continued, and it did not end until the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. Since the fall of the Soviet Union, the Russian Orthodox Church has recognized a number of New Martyrs as saints, some of whom were executed during the Mass operations of the NKVD under directives like NKVD Order No. 00447.\nBoth before and after the October Revolution of 7 November 1917 (25 October Old Calendar), there was a movement within the Soviet Union which sought to unite all of the people of the world under Communist rule (see Communist International). This movement spread to the Eastern European bloc countries as well as the Balkan States. Since the populations of some of these Slavic countries tied their ethnic heritages to their ethnic churches, the people and their churches were both targeted for ethnic and political genocide by the Soviets and their form of State atheism. The Soviets' official religious stance was one of \"religious freedom or tolerance\", though the state established atheism as the only scientific truth (see also the Soviet or committee of the All-Union Society for the Dissemination of Scientific and Political Knowledge or Znanie which was until 1947 called The League of the Militant Godless and various Intelligentsia groups). Criticism of atheism was strictly forbidden and sometimes, it resulted in imprisonment. Some of the more high-profile individuals who were executed include Metropolitan Benjamin of Petrograd, priest and scientist Pavel Florensky.\nSpain.\nThe Second Spanish Republic, established in 1931, attempted to establish a regime with separation between State and Church, as had been established in France in 1905. When it was established, the Republic passed legislation which prevented the Church from conducting educational activities. The Spanish Second Republic was characterized by a process of political polarisation, as party divisions became increasingly embittered and questions of religious identity came to assume major political significance. The existence of different Church institutions was an illustration of the situation which resulted from the proclamation which denounced the 2nd Republic as an anti-Catholic, Masonic, Jewish, and Communist internationalist conspiracy which heralded a clash between God and atheism, chaos and harmony, Good and Evil. The Church's high-ranking officials like Isidro Goma, bishop of Tudela, reminded their Christian subjects of their obligation to vote \"for the righteous\", and they also reminded their priests of their obligation to \"educate the consciences.\" In the Asturian miners' strike of 1934, during the Revolution of 1934, 34 Catholic priests were massacred and churches were systematically burned. Anticlerical opinion accused the Catholic priesthood and religious orders of hypocrisy: clerics were guilty of taking up arms against the people, of exploiting others for the sake of wealth, and of sexual immorality all while claiming the moral authority of peacefulness, poverty, and chastity.\nSince the early years of the Second Spanish Republic, far-right forces, which were imbued with an ultra-Catholic spirit, attempted to overthrow the Republic. Carlists, Africanistas, and Catholic theologians fostered an atmosphere of social and racial hatred in their speeches and writings. The Catholic Church endorsed the rebellion which was led by the fascist Francisco Franco, and Pope Pius XI expressed sympathy for the Nationalist side during the Spanish Civil War. The Catholic authorities described Franco's war as a \"crusade\" against the Second Republic, and later the Collective Letter of the Spanish Bishops, 1937 appeared, justifying Franco's attack on the Republic. A similar approach is attested in 1912, when the bishop of Almer\u00eda Jos\u00e9 Ignacio de Urbina (founder of the National Anti-Masonic and Anti-Semitic League) announced \"a decisive battle that must be unleashed\" between the \"light\" and \"darkness\". Though the official declaration of the \"crusade\" followed the Republican persecution of Catholic clerics, the Catholic Church was already predisposed towards Franco's position, because it was seen as the \"perfect ally of fascism\" while it opposed the anticlerical policies of the Second Republic. The 1936 anticlerical persecution has been seen as \"final phase of a long war between clericalism and anticlericalism\" and \"fully consistent with a Spanish history of popular anticlericalism and anticlerical populism\".\nStanley Payne suggested that the persecution of right-wingers and of people who were associated with the Catholic church both before and at the beginning of the Spanish Civil War involved the murder of priests and other clergy, as well as the murder of thousands of lay people, by members of nearly all leftist groups, while a killing spree was also unleashed across the Nationalist zone. During the Spanish Civil War of 1936\u20131939, and especially during the early months of the conflict, individual clergymen and entire religious communities were executed by leftists, some of whom were communists and anarchists. The death toll of the clergy alone included 13 bishops, 4,172 diocesan priests and seminarians, 2,364 monks and friars and 283 nuns, reaching a total of 6,832 clerical victims. The main perpetrators of the Red Terror were members of the anarchist Federaci\u00f3n Anarquista Ib\u00e9rica, the Confederaci\u00f3n Nacional del Trabajo, and the Trotskyist Workers' Party of Marxist Unification. These organizations distanced themselves from the violence, condemned those who were responsible for it or characterized the killings as mob reprisals for acts of violence which had been perpetrated by the clerics themselves, an explanation which was readily accepted by the public.\nIn addition to the murder of both the clergy and the faithful, the destruction of churches and the desecration of sacred sites and objects was also widespread. On the night of 19 July 1936 alone, some fifty churches were burned. In Barcelona, out of the 58 churches, only the cathedral was spared, and similar desecrations occurred almost everywhere in Republican Spain.\nTwo exceptions were Biscay and Gipuzkoa, where the Christian Democratic Basque Nationalist Party, after some hesitation, supported the Republic and halted the persecution of Catholics in areas which were held by the Basque Government. All other Catholic churches which were located in the Republican zone were closed. The desecration was not limited to Catholic churches, because synagogues and Protestant churches were also pillaged and closed, but some small Protestant churches were spared. After Francisco Franco's regime rose to power, it would keep Protestant churches and synagogues closed, because it only legalized the Catholic Church.\nPayne called the terror the \"most extensive and violent persecution of Catholicism in Western History, in some way even more intense than that of the French Revolution.\"\nThe persecution drove Catholics to the side of the Nationalists, even more of them sided with the Nationalists than would have been expected, because they defended their religious interests and survival.\nThe Roman Catholic priests who were killed during the Red Terror are considered \"Martyrs of the Spanish Civil War\", but the priests who were executed by the fascists are not counted among them. A group known as the \"498 Spanish Martyrs\" was beatified by the Roman Catholic Church's Pope Benedict XVI in 2007. The history of the Red Terror has been obscured by the inattention of scholars and the \"embarrassing partiality\" of ecclesiastical historians.\nSome of the numerous non-fascists who were persecuted during Franco's White Terror were Protestants, because the fascists accused them of being associated with Freemasonry, and the persecution which they were subjected to during Franco's White Terror was much more intense than the persecution which they were subjected to during the Red Terror.\nUnited States.\nThe Latter Day Saints, (Mormons) have been persecuted since their founding in the 1830s. The persecution of the Mormons drove them from New York and Ohio to Missouri, where they continued to be subjected to violent attacks. In 1838, Missouri Governor Lilburn Boggs declared that Mormons had made war on the state of Missouri, so they \"must be treated as enemies, and must be exterminated or driven from the State\". At least 10,000 Mormons were expelled from the State. In the most violent altercation which occurred at that time, the Haun's Mill massacre, 17 Mormons were murdered by an anti-Mormon mob and 13 other Mormons were wounded. The Extermination Order which was signed by Governor Boggs was not formally invalidated until 25 June 1976, 137 years after being signed.\nThe Mormons subsequently fled to Nauvoo, Illinois, where hostilities escalated again. In Carthage, Ill., where Joseph Smith was being held on the charge of treason, a mob stormed the jail and killed him. Smith's brother, Hyrum, was also killed. After a succession crisis, most Mormons followed Brigham Young, who organized an evacuation from the United States after the federal government refused to protect them. 70,000 Mormon pioneers crossed the Great Plains to settle in the Salt Lake Valley and surrounding areas. After the Mexican\u2013American War, the area became the US territory of Utah. Over the next 63 years, several actions by the federal government were directed against Mormons in the Mormon Corridor, including the Utah War, the Morrill Anti-Bigamy Act, the Poland Act, \"Reynolds v. United States\", the Edmunds Act, the Edmunds\u2013Tucker Act, and the Reed Smoot hearings.\nThe second iteration of the Ku Klux Klan, founded in 1915 and launched in the 1920s, persecuted Catholics in both the United States and Canada. As stated in its official rhetoric which focused on the threat of the Catholic Church, the Klan was motivated by anti-Catholicism and American nativism. Its appeal was exclusively directed towards white Anglo-Saxon Protestants; it opposed Jews, blacks, Catholics, and newly arriving Southern and Eastern European immigrants such as Italians, Russians, and Lithuanians, many of whom were either Jewish or Catholic.\nWarsaw Pact.\nAcross Eastern Europe following World War II, the parts of the Nazi Empire which were conquered by the Soviet Red Army and Yugoslavia became one-party Communist states and the project of coercive conversion to atheism continued. The Soviet Union ended its war time truce with the Russian Orthodox Church, and extended its persecutions to the newly Communist Eastern bloc: \"In Poland, Hungary, Lithuania and other Eastern European countries, Catholic leaders who were unwilling to be silent were denounced, publicly humiliated or imprisoned by the Communists. Leaders of the national Orthodox Churches in Romania and Bulgaria had to be cautious and submissive\", wrote Geoffrey Blainey. While the churches were generally not persecuted as harshly as they had been in the USSR, nearly all of their schools and many of their churches were closed, and they lost their formally prominent roles in public life. Children were taught atheism, and clergy were imprisoned by the thousands. In the Eastern Bloc, Christian churches, along with Jewish synagogues and Islamic mosques were forcibly \"converted into museums of atheism.\"\nAlong with executions, some other actions which were taken against Orthodox priests and believers included torture, being sent to prison camps, labour camps or mental hospitals.\nCurrent situation (1989 to the present).\nIn 2010, Pope Benedict XVI said that Christians were the most persecuted religious group in the contemporary world. In a speech to the United Nations Human Rights Council's 23rd session in May 2013, then-Permanent Observer of the Holy See to the United Nations in Geneva, Silvano Maria Tomasi said that \"an estimate of more than 100,000 Christians are violently killed because of some relation to their faith every year\". This number was supported by the Center for the Study of Global Christianity at the evangelical Gordon\u2013Conwell Theological Seminary in Massachusetts, which published a statement in December 2016 stating that \"between 2005 and 2015 there were 900,000 Christian martyrs worldwide \u2013 an average of 90,000 per year.\" Tomasi's radio address to the council called the figures both a \"shocking conclusion\" and \"credible research\". The accuracy of this number, based on population estimates in a 1982 edition of the \"World Christian Encyclopedia\", is disputed. Almost all died in wars in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where all sides of the Second Congo War and subsequent conflicts are majority-Christian, and previous years included victims of the Rwandan genocide, an ethnic conflict and a part of the First Congo War where again most belligerents were Christian. As a result, the \"BBC News Magazine\" cautioned that \"when you hear that 100,000 Christians are dying for their faith, you need to keep in mind that the vast majority \u2013 90,000 \u2013 are people who were killed in DR Congo\".\nKlaus Wetzel, a German expert on religious persecution, states that there is a discrepancy in numbers of reported martyrs due to the contradiction between the definition used by Gordon-Conwell defining Christian martyrdom in the widest possible sense, and the more sociological and political definition Wetzel himself, Open Doors, and others such as \"The International Institute for Religious Freedom\" use, which is: \"those who are killed, \"who would not have been killed\", if they had not been Christians\".\nNumbers are affected by several important factors, for example, population distribution is a factor. The United States submits an annual report on religious freedom and persecution to the Congress which recognizes restrictions on religious freedom, ranging from low to very high, in three-quarters of the world's countries including the United States. In approximately one quarter of the world's countries, there are high and very high restrictions and oppression, and some of those countries, such as China and India, Indonesia and Pakistan are among those with the highest populations.\nNumbers of martyrs are especially difficult to accurately identify, because religious persecution often occurs in conjunction with wider conflicts. This fact complicates the identification of acts of persecution because they may be politically rather than religiously motivated. For example, the U.S. Department of State identified 1.4\u00a0million Christians in Iraq in 1991 when the Gulf War began. By 2010, the number of Christians dropped to 700,000 and by 2011 it was estimated that there were between 450,000 and 200,000 Christians left in Iraq. During that period, actions against Christians included the burning and bombing of churches, the bombing of Christian owned businesses and homes, kidnapping, murder, demands for protection money, and anti-Christian rhetoric in the media with those responsible saying that they wanted to rid the country of its Christians.\nIn 2025 the Vatican published a list of over 1600 people who it says were killed for their Christian faith since the year 2000. The list was made public during the Jubilee of the Martyrs, as part of the Catholic Church's 2025 Jubilee of Hope, in a ceremony presided by Pope Leo XIV, who said. \"During this Jubilee Year, we celebrate the hope of these courageous witnesses of the faith. It is a hope filled with immortality because their martyrdom continues to spread the Gospel in a world marked by hatred, violence and war; it is a hope filled with immortality because, even though they have been killed in body, no one can silence their voice or erase the love they have shown; it is a hope filled with immortality because their witness lives on as a prophecy of the victory of good over evil.\u201d\nThe list resulted from extensive research and included people from all confessions recognised as Christian by the Catholic Church, and not just Catholic victims of martyrdom.\nA report which was released by the UK's Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs and prepared by Philip Mounstephen, the Bishop of Truro, in July 2019, and a report on worldwide restrictions on religious freedom by the PEW organization, both stated that the number of countries where Christians were suffering as a result of religious persecution was increasing, rising from 125 in 2015 to 144 as of 2018. PEW has published a caution concerning the interpretation of its numbers: \"The Center's recent report ... does not attempt to estimate the number of victims in each country... it does not speak to the intensity of harassment...\"\nThe Internationale Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Menschenrechte \u2013 the International Society for Human Rights \u2013 in Frankfurt, Germany, is a non-governmental organization with 30,000 members from 38 countries who monitor human rights. In September 2009, then chairman Martin Lessenthin, issued a report estimating that 80% of acts of religious persecution around the world were aimed at Christians at that time.\nW. J. Blumenfeld says that Christianity enjoys dominant group privilege in the US and some other Western societies. Christianity is, numerically, the largest religion in the U.S. according to PEW, with 43% of Americans identifying themselves as Protestants and one in five (20%) of Americans identifying themselves as Catholics. It remains the largest religion in the world. Roughly two-thirds of the world's countries have Christian majorities. Due to the large number of Christian majority countries, differing groups of Christians are harassed and persecuted in Christian countries such as Eritrea and Mexico more often than in most Muslim countries, though not in greater numbers.\nAccording to PEW, the Middle East and North Africa have experienced the highest rates of restrictions on non-favorite religions for the last decade, being higher than any other region, each year, from 2007 to 2017. But it's the gap between this region and other regions where government favoritism is concerned that is particularly large: \"the average country in this region scores nearly twice as high on measures of government favoritism of one religion as the average country in any other region\".\nThe United States Commission on International Religious Freedom, a bipartisan independent federal agency which was created by the United States Congress in 1998, published a study of the predominantly Muslim countries which are located in the Middle Eastern/North African region. It concludes that, of the world's 1.3\u00a0billion Muslims, \"28 percent live in ten countries that declare themselves to be Islamic states. In addition, there are 12 predominantly Muslim countries that have chosen to declare that Islam is the official state religion ... Taken together, the 22 states that declare that Islam is the official religion account for 58 percent \u2013 or just over 600 million \u2013 of the 1 billion Muslims living in 44 predominantly Muslim countries.\n\"Several countries with constitutions establishing Islam as the state religion either do not contain guarantees of the right to freedom of religion or belief, or they contain guarantees that, on their face, do not compare favorably with all aspects of international [human rights] standards.\" All of these countries defer to religious authorities or doctrines on legal issues in some way. For example, \"when one spouse is Muslim and the other has a different religion (such as Coptic Christianity), or if spouses are members of different Christian denominations, courts still defer to Islamic family law.\" Grim and Finke say their studies indicate that: \"When religious freedoms are denied through the regulation of religious profession or practice, violent religious persecution and conflict increase.\" In its annual report, the USCIRF lists 14 \"Countries of Particular Concern\" with regard to religious rights and it also lists 15 additional countries which it has recommended be placed on the U.S. Department of State's Special Watch List (SWL), a lesser category than the CPC designation.\nEleven predominantly Muslim countries are ruled by governments which proclaim that their states are secular. \"These countries account for nearly 140 million Muslims, or 13.5 percent of the 1 billion Muslims living in predominantly Muslim countries. The 11 remaining predominantly Muslim countries have not made any constitutional declaration concerning the Islamic or secular nature of the state, and have not made Islam the official state religion. This group of countries, which includes Indonesia, the world's largest Muslim country, accounts for over 250 million Muslims\". This demonstrates that the majority of the world's Muslim population live in countries that either proclaim the state to be secular, or that make no pronouncements concerning Islam as the official state religion.\nThe rise of Hindutva (Hindu nationalism) in India, led by the Bharatiya Janata Party, has seen increasing persecution and violence against Christians.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "25079", "revid": "20483999", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25079", "title": "Pet", "text": "Animal kept for companionship rather than utility\nA pet, or companion animal, is an animal kept primarily for a person's company or entertainment rather than as a working animal, livestock, or a laboratory animal. Popular pets are often considered to have attractive/cute appearances, intelligence, and relatable personalities, but some pets may be taken in on an altruistic basis (such as a stray animal) and accepted by the owner regardless of these characteristics.\nTwo of the most popular pets are dogs and cats. Other animals commonly kept include rabbits; ferrets; pigs; rodents such as gerbils, hamsters, chinchillas, rats, mice, and guinea pigs; birds such as parrots, passerines, and fowls; reptiles such as turtles, lizards, snakes, and iguanas; aquatic pets such as fish, freshwater snails, and saltwater snails; amphibians such as frogs and salamanders; and arthropod pets such as tarantulas and hermit crabs. Smaller pets include rodents, while the equine and bovine group include the largest companion animals.\nPets provide their owners, or guardians, both physical and emotional benefits. Walking a dog can provide both the human and the dog with exercise, fresh air, and social interaction. Pets can give companionship to people who are living alone or elderly adults who do not have adequate social interaction with other people. There is a medically approved class of therapy animals that are brought to visit confined humans, such as children in hospitals or elders in nursing homes. Pet therapy utilizes trained animals and handlers to achieve specific physical, social, cognitive, or emotional goals with patients.\nPeople most commonly get pets for companionship, to protect a home or property, or because of the perceived beauty or attractiveness of the animals. A 1994 Canadian study found that the most common reasons for not owning a pet were lack of ability to care for the pet when traveling (34.6%), lack of time (28.6%), and lack of suitable housing (28.3%), with dislike of pets being less common (19.6%). Some scholars, ethicists, and animal rights organizations have raised concerns over keeping pets because of the lack of autonomy and the objectification of non-human animals.\nPet popularity.\nIn China, spending on domestic animals has grown from an estimated $3.12 billion in 2010 to $25 billion in 2018. The Chinese people own 51 million dogs and 41 million cats, with pet owners often preferring to source pet food internationally. There are a total of 755 million pets, increased from 389 million in 2013.\nA survey in 2002 found approximately 45 million pets in Italy, including 7 million dogs, 7.5 million cats, 16 million fish, 12 million birds and 10 thousand snakes.\nA 2007 survey by the University of Bristol found that 26% of UK households owned cats and 31% owned dogs, estimating total domestic populations of approximately 10.3 million cats and 10.5 million dogs in 2006. The survey also found that 47.2% of households with a cat had at least one person educated to degree level, compared with 38.4% of homes with dogs.\nThere are approximately 86.4 million pet cats and approximately 78.2 million pet dogs in the United States, and a United States 2007\u20132008 survey showed that dog-owning households outnumbered those owning cats, but that the total number of pet cats was higher than that of dogs. The same was true for 2011. In 2013, pets outnumbered children four to one in the United States.\nEffects on pets' health.\nKeeping animals as pets may be detrimental to their health if certain requirements are not met. An important issue is inappropriate feeding, which may produce clinical effects. The consumption of chocolate or grapes by dogs, for example, may prove fatal. Certain species of houseplants can also prove toxic if consumed by pets. Examples include philodendrons and Easter lilies, which can cause severe kidney damage to cats, and poinsettias, begonia, and aloe vera, which are mildly toxic to dogs. For birds, chocolate can be deadly, and foods intended for human consumption, such as bread, crackers, and dairy items, can potentially cause health problems.\nHouse pets, particularly dogs and cats in industrialized societies, are highly susceptible to obesity. Overweight pets have been shown to be at a higher risk of developing diabetes, liver problems, joint pain, kidney failure, and cancer. Lack of exercise and high-caloric diets are considered to be the primary contributors to pet obesity.\nEffects of pets on their caregivers' health.\nHealth benefits.\nIt is widely believed among the public, and among many scientists, that pets probably bring mental and physical health benefits to their owners; a 1987 NIH statement cautiously argued that existing data was \"suggestive\" of a significant benefit. A recent dissent comes from a 2017 RAND study, which found that at least in the case of children, having a pet \"per se\" failed to improve physical or mental health by a statistically significant amount; instead, the study found children who were already prone to being healthy were more likely to get pets in the first place. Conducting long-term randomized trials to settle the issue would be costly or infeasible.\nObserved correlations.\nPets might have the ability to stimulate their caregivers, in particular the elderly, giving people someone to take care of, someone to exercise with, and someone to help them heal from a physically or psychologically troubled past. Animal company can also help people to preserve acceptable levels of happiness despite the presence of mood symptoms like anxiety or depression. Having a pet may also help people achieve health goals, such as lowered blood pressure, or mental goals, such as decreased stress. There is evidence that having a pet can help a person lead a longer, healthier life. In a 1986 study of 92 people hospitalized for coronary ailments, within a year, 11 of the 29 patients without pets had died, compared to only 3 of the 52 patients who had pets. Having pet(s) was shown to significantly reduce triglycerides, and thus heart disease risk, in the elderly. A study by the National Institute of Health found that people who owned dogs were less likely to die as a result of a heart attack than those who did not own one. There is some evidence that pets may have a therapeutic effect in dementia cases. Other studies have shown that for the elderly, good health may be a requirement for having a pet, and not a result. Dogs trained to be guide dogs can help people with vision impairment. Dogs trained in the field of Animal-Assisted Therapy (AAT) can also benefit people with other disabilities.\nPets in long-term care institutions.\nPeople residing in a long-term care facility, such as a hospice or nursing home, may experience health benefits from pets. Pets help them to cope with the emotional issues related to their illness. They also offer physical contact with another living creature, something that is often missing in an elder's life. Pets for nursing homes are chosen based on the size of the pet, the amount of care that the breed needs, and the population and size of the care institution. Appropriate pets go through a screening process and, if it is a dog, additional training programs to become a therapy dog. There are three types of therapy dogs: facility therapy dogs, animal-assisted therapy dogs, and therapeutic visitation dogs. The most common therapy dogs are therapeutic visitation dogs. These dogs are household pets whose handlers take time to visit hospitals, nursing homes, detention facilities, and rehabilitation facilities. Different pets require varying amounts of attention and care; for example, cats may have lower maintenance requirements than dogs.\nConnection with community.\nIn addition to offering health benefits to their owners, pets also influence their owners' social lives and connections within their communities. Research suggests that pets may facilitate social interactions, fostering communication and engagement among individuals. Assistant Professor of Sociology at the University of Colorado at Boulder, Leslie Irvine has focused her attention on pets of the homeless population. Her studies of pet ownership among the homeless found that many modify their life activities for fear of losing their pets. Pet ownership prompts them to act responsibly, with many making a deliberate choice not to drink or use drugs, and to avoid contact with substance abusers or those involved in any criminal activity for fear of being separated from their pet. Additionally, many refuse to house in shelters if their pet is not allowed to stay with them.\nHealth risks.\nHealth risks that are associated with pets include:\nLegislation.\nTreaties.\nThe European Convention for the Protection of Pet Animals is a 1987 treaty of the Council of Europe \u2013 but accession to the treaty is open to all states in the world \u2013 to promote the welfare of pet animals and ensure minimum standards for their treatment and protection. It went into effect on 1 May 1992, and as of June 2020, it has been ratified by 24 states.\nNational and local laws.\nOwnership or guardianship.\nPets have commonly been considered private property, owned by individual persons. Many legal protections have existed (historically and today) with the intention of safeguarding pets' and other animals' well-being. Since the year 2000, a small but increasing number of jurisdictions in North America have enacted laws redefining pet's \"owners\" as \"guardians\". Intentions have been characterized as simply changing attitudes and perceptions but not legal consequences to working toward legal personhood for pets themselves. Some veterinarians and breeders have opposed these moves. The question of pets' legal status can arise with concern to purchase or adoption, custody, divorce, estate and inheritance, injury, damage, and veterinary malpractice.\nIn the United Kingdom, the minimum age to own a pet is 16.\nLimitations on species.\nStates, cities, and towns in Western countries commonly enact local ordinances to limit the number or kind of pets a person may keep personally or for business purposes. Prohibited pets may be specific to certain breeds such as pit bulls or Rottweilers, they may apply to general categories of animals (such as livestock, exotic animals, wild animals, and canid or felid hybrids), or they may simply be based on the animal's size. Additional or different maintenance rules and regulations may also apply. Condominium associations and owners of rental properties also commonly limit or forbid tenants' keeping of pets.\nIn Belgium and the Netherlands, the government publishes white lists and black lists (called 'positive' and 'negative lists') with animal species that are designated to be appropriate to be kept as pets (positive) or not (negative). The Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy originally established its first positive list (\"positieflijst\") per 1 February 2015 for a set of 100 mammals (including cats, dogs and production animals) deemed appropriate as pets on the recommendations of Wageningen University. Parliamentary debates about such a pet list date back to the 1980s, with continuous disagreements about which species should be included and how the law should be enforced. In January 2017, the white list was expanded to 123 species, while the black list that had been set up was expanded (with animals like the brown bear and two great kangaroo species) to contain 153 species unfit for petting, such as the armadillo, the sloth, the European hare, and the wild boar.\nKilling and eating pets.\nIn January 2011, the Belgian Federal Agency for the Safety of the Food Chain stated that people are not allowed to kill miscellaneous or unknown cats walking in their garden, but \"nowhere in the law does it say that you can't eat your cat, dog, rabbit, fish or whatever. You just have to kill them in an animal-friendly way.\" Since 1 July 2014, it is illegal in the Netherlands for owners to kill their own cats and dogs kept as pets. Parakeets, guinea pigs, hamsters and other animals may still be killed by their owners, but nonetheless when owners mistreat their companion animals (for example, in the process of killing them), the owners can still be prosecuted under Dutch law.\nEnvironmental impact.\nPets have a considerable environmental impact, especially in countries where they are common or held in high densities. For instance, the 163 million dogs and cats kept in the United States consume about 20% of the amount of dietary energy that humans do and an estimated 33% of the animal-derived energy. They produce about 30% \u00b1 13%, by mass, as much feces as Americans, and through their diet, constitute about 25\u201330% of the environmental impacts from animal production in terms of the use of land, water, fossil fuel, phosphate, and biocides. Dog and cat animal product consumption is responsible for the release of up to 64 \u00b1 16 million tons CO2-equivalent methane and nitrous oxide, two powerful greenhouse gasses. Americans are the largest pet owners in the world, but pet ownership in the US has considerable environmental costs.\nTypes.\nWhile many people have kept many different species of animals in captivity over the course of human history, only a relative few have been kept long enough to be considered domesticated. Other types of animal, notably monkeys, have never been domesticated but are still sold and kept as pets. Some wild animals are kept as pets, such as tigers, even though this is illegal. There is a market for illegal pets.\nDomesticated.\nDomesticated pets are the most common. A \"domesticated animal\" is a species that has been made fit for a human environment, by being consistently kept in captivity and selectively bred over a long enough period of time that it exhibits marked differences in behavior and appearance from its wild relatives. Domestication contrasts with taming, which is simply when an un-domesticated, wild animal has become tolerant of human presence, and perhaps even enjoys it.\nLarge mammals that might be kept as pets include alpaca, camel, cattle, donkey, goat, horse, llama, pig, reindeer, sheep and yak. Small mammals that might be kept as pets include: ferret, hedgehog, rabbit, sugar glider, and rodents, including rat, mouse, hamster, guinea pig, gerbil, and chinchilla. Other mammals include cat, dog, monkey, and domesticated silver fox.\nBirds kept as pets include companion parrots like the budgie (parakeet) and cockatiel, fowl such as chickens, turkeys, ducks, geese, and quail, columbines, and passerines, namely finches and canaries.\nFish kept as pets include: goldfish, koi, Siamese fighting fish (Betta), barb, guppy, molly, Japanese rice fish (Medaka), and oscar.\nArthropods kept as pets include bees, such as honey bees and stingless bees, Silk moth, and ant farms.\nReptiles and amphibians kept as pets include snakes, turtles, axolotl, frogs and salamanders.\nWild animals.\nWild animals are kept as pets. The term \"wild\" in this context specifically applies to any species of animal which has not undergone a fundamental change in behavior to facilitate a close co-existence with humans. Some species may have been bred in captivity for a considerable length of time, but are still not recognized as domesticated.\nGenerally, wild animals are recognized as not suitable to keep as pets, and this practice is completely banned in many places. In other areas, certain species are allowed to be kept, and it is usually required for the owner to obtain a permit. It is considered animal cruelty by some, as most often, wild animals require precise and constant care that is very difficult to meet in captive conditions. Many large and instinctively aggressive animals are extremely dangerous, and numerous times have they killed their handlers.\nHistory.\nPrehistory.\nArchaeology suggests that human ownership of dogs as pets may date back to at least 12,000 years ago.\nAncient history.\nAncient Greeks and Romans would openly grieve for the loss of a dog, evidenced by inscriptions left on tombstones commemorating their loss. The surviving epitaphs dedicated to horses are more likely to reference a gratitude for the companionship that had come from war horses rather than race horses. The latter may have chiefly been commemorated as a way to further the owner's fame and glory. In Ancient Egypt, dogs and baboons were kept as pets and buried with their owners. Dogs were given names, which is significant as Egyptians considered names to have magical properties.\nIn the Old Testament passage in 2 Samuel 12, the prophet Nathan, in order to indicate to King David the seriousness of his adulterous and murderous affair with Bathsheba, uses the parable of a poor man's pet lamb being slaughtered by a rich neighbor who uses it to feed a guest. David, who had spent his youth as a shepherd and had compassion and affection for such a creature, becomes enraged at the rich man in the parable, only to be told by Nathan, \"You are the man!\" David, having been thus exposed as a hypocrite, confesses, \"I have sinned.\" This is one of the only instances in Scripture of an animal being kept for companionship rather than for utilitarian purposes, apart from the acquisition of exotic animals by David's son King Solomon for a menagerie (2 Chronicles 9)\nVictorian era: the rise of modern pet keeping.\nThroughout the 17th and 18th-century pet keeping in the modern sense gradually became accepted throughout Britain. Initially, aristocrats kept dogs for both companionship and hunting. Thus, pet keeping was a sign of elitism within society. By the 19th century, the rise of the middle class stimulated the development of pet keeping and it became inscribed within the bourgeois culture.\nEconomy.\nAs the popularity of pet-keeping in the modern sense rose during the Victorian era, animals became a fixture within urban culture as commodities and decorative objects. Pet keeping generated a commercial opportunity for entrepreneurs. By the mid-19th century, nearly twenty thousand street vendors in London dealt with live animals. The popularity of animals also developed a demand for animal goods such as accessories and guides for pet keeping. Pet care developed into a big business by the end of the nineteenth century.\nProfiteers also sought out pet stealing as a means for economic gain. Utilizing the affection that owners had for their pets, professional dog stealers would capture animals and hold them for ransom. The development of dog stealing reflects the increased value of pets. Pets gradually became defined as the property of their owners. Laws were created that punished offenders for their burglary.\nSocial.\nPets and animals also had social and cultural implications throughout the nineteenth century. The categorization of dogs by their breeds reflected the hierarchical, social order of the Victorian era. The pedigree of a dog represented the high status and lineage of their owners and reinforced social stratification. Middle-class owners valued the ability to associate with the upper-class through ownership of their pets. The ability to care for a pet signified respectability and the capability to be self-sufficient. According to Harriet Ritvo, the identification of \"elite animal and elite owner was not a confirmation of the owner's status but a way of redefining it.\"\nEntertainment.\nThe popularity of dog and pet keeping generated animal fancy. Dog fanciers showed enthusiasm for owning pets, breeding dogs, and showing dogs in various shows. The first dog show took place on 28 June 1859 in Newcastle and focused mostly on sporting and hunting dogs. However, pet owners produced an eagerness to demonstrate their pets as well as have an outlet to compete. Thus, pet animals gradually were included within dog shows. The first large show, which would host one thousand entries, took place in Chelsea in 1863. The Kennel Club was created in 1873 to ensure fairness and organization within dog shows. The development of the \"Stud Book\" by the Kennel Club defined policies, presented a national registry system of purebred dogs, and essentially institutionalized dog shows.\nPet ownership by non-humans.\nPet ownership by animals in the wild, as an analogue to the human phenomenon, has not been observed and is likely non-existent in nature. One group of capuchin monkeys was observed appearing to care for a marmoset, a fellow New World monkey species; however, observations of chimpanzees apparently playing with small animals like hyraxes have ended with the chimpanzees killing the animals and tossing the corpses around.\nA 2010 study states that human relationships with animals have an exclusive human cognitive component and that pet-keeping is a fundamental and ancient attribute of the human species. Anthropomorphism, or the projection of human feelings, thoughts and attributes on to animals, is a defining feature of human pet-keeping. The study identifies it as the same trait in evolution responsible for domestication and concern for animal welfare. It is estimated to have arisen at least 100,000 years before present (ybp) in \"Homo sapiens\".\nIt is debated whether this redirection of human nurturing behaviour towards non-human animals, in the form of pet-keeping, was maladaptive, due to being biologically costly, or whether it was positively selected for. Two studies suggest that the human ability to domesticate and keep pets came from the same fundamental evolutionary trait and that this trait provided a material benefit in the form of domestication that was sufficiently adaptive to be positively selected for. A 2011 study suggests that the practical functions that some pets provide, such as assisting hunting or removing pests, could have resulted in enough evolutionary advantage to allow for the persistence of this behaviour in humans and outweigh the economic burden held by pets kept as playthings for immediate emotional rewards. Two other studies suggest that the behaviour constitutes an error, side effect or misapplication of the evolved mechanisms responsible for human empathy and theory of mind to cover non-human animals which has not sufficiently impacted its evolutionary advantage in the long run.\nAnimals in captivity, with the help of caretakers, have been considered to have owned pets. Examples of this include Koko the gorilla who had several pet cats, Tonda the orangutan and a pet cat and Tarra the elephant and a dog named Bella.\nEthics.\nSome scholars, ethicists, and animal rights organizations have raised concerns over keeping pets because of the lack of autonomy and the objectification of non-human animals. By contrast, Ikechukwu Monday Osebor writing in the Aquino Journal from the University of Nigeria argues from a consequentialist perspective that pet ownership can be ethical. Gary Francione and Anna Charlton argue that pet breeding and ownership are unethical because they view it as treating animals as property and commodifying them. Further concerns arise from vegan and vegetarian perspectives with the fact that some pets require the consumption of meat and thus keeping pets may be unethical.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The process and practice of creating such images is called photography.\nMost photographs are now created using a smartphone or camera, which uses a lens to focus the scene's visible wavelengths of light into a reproduction of what the human eye would perceive.\nEtymology.\nThe word \"photograph\" was coined in 1839 by Sir John Herschel and is based on the Greek \u03c6\u1ff6\u03c2 (\"\"), meaning \"light,\" and \u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u03c6\u03ae (\"graph\u00ea\"), meaning \"drawing, writing,\" together meaning \"drawing with light.\"\nHistory.\nThe first permanent photograph, a contact-exposed copy of an engraving, was made in 1822 using the bitumen-based \"heliography\" process developed by Nic\u00e9phore Ni\u00e9pce. The first photographs of a real-world scene, made using a camera obscura, followed a few years later at Le Gras, France, in 1826, but Ni\u00e9pce's process was not sensitive enough to be practical for that application: a camera exposure lasting for hours or days was required. In 1829, Ni\u00e9pce entered into a partnership with Louis Daguerre, and the two collaborated to work out a similar, but more sensitive, and otherwise improved process.\nAfter Ni\u00e9pce's death on the 5th July 1833, Daguerre concentrated on silver halide-based alternatives. He exposed a silver-plated copper sheet to iodine vapor, creating a layer of light-sensitive silver iodide; exposed it in the camera for a few minutes; developed the resulting invisible latent image to visibility with mercury fumes; then bathed the plate in a hot salt solution to remove the remaining silver iodide, making the results light-fast. He named this first practical process for making photographs with a camera, the daguerreotype, after himself. Its existence was announced to the world on 7 January 1839, but working details were not made public until 19 August that year. Other inventors soon made drastic improvements that reduced the required amount of exposure time from a few minutes to just a few seconds, making portrait photography truly practical and widely popular during this time.\nThe daguerreotype had shortcomings, notably the fragility of the mirror-like image surface and the particular viewing conditions required to see the image properly. Each was a unique, opaque positive that could only be duplicated by copying it with a camera. Inventors set about working out improved processes that would be more practical. By the end of the 1850s, the daguerreotype had been replaced by the less expensive and more easily viewed ambrotype and tintype, which made use of the recently introduced collodion process. Glass plate collodion negatives used to make prints on albumen paper soon became the preferred photographic method and held that position for many years, even after the introduction of the more convenient gelatin process in 1871. Refinements of the gelatin process have remained the primary black-and-white photographic process to this day, differing primarily in the sensitivity of the emulsion and the support material used, which was originally glass, then a variety of flexible plastic films, along with various types of paper for the final prints.\nColor photography is almost as old as black-and-white, with early experiments including John Herschel's Anthotype prints in 1842, the pioneering work of Louis Ducos du Hauron in the 1860s, and the Lippmann process unveiled in 1891, but for many years color photography remained little more than a laboratory curiosity. It first became a widespread commercial reality with the introduction of Autochrome plates in 1907, but the plates were very expensive and not suitable for casual snapshot-taking with hand-held cameras. The mid-1930s saw the introduction of Kodachrome and Agfacolor Neu, the first easy-to-use color films of the modern multi-layer chromogenic type. These early processes produced transparencies for use in slide projectors and viewing devices, but color prints became increasingly popular after the introduction of chromogenic color print paper in the 1940s. The needs of the motion picture industry generated a number of special processes and systems, perhaps the best-known being the now-obsolete three-strip Technicolor process.\nTypes of photographs.\nNon-digital photographs are produced with a two-step chemical process. In the two-step process, the light-sensitive film captures a \"negative\" image (colors and lights/darks are inverted). To produce a \"positive\" image, the negative is most commonly transferred ('printed') onto photographic paper. Printing the negative onto transparent film stock is used to manufacture motion picture films.\nAlternatively, the film is processed to invert the \"negative\" image, yielding positive transparency. Such positive images are usually mounted in frames, called slides. Before recent advances in digital photography, transparencies were widely used by professionals because of their sharpness and accuracy of color rendition. Most photographs published in magazines were taken on color transparency film.\nOriginally, all photographs were monochromatic or hand-painted in color. Although methods for developing color photos were available as early as 1861, they did not become widely available until the 1940s or 1950s, and even so, until the 1960s, most photographs were taken in black and white. Since then, color photography has dominated popular photography, although black-and-white is still used, being easier to develop than color.\nPanoramic format images can be taken with cameras like the Hasselblad Xpan on standard film. Since the 1990s, panoramic photos have been available on the Advanced Photo System (APS) film. APS was developed by several of the major film manufacturers to provide a film with different formats and computerized options available, though APS panoramas were created using a mask in panorama-capable cameras, far less desirable than a true panoramic camera, which achieves its effect through a wider film format. APS has become less popular and has been discontinued.\nThe advent of the microcomputer and digital photography has led to the rise of digital prints. These prints are created from stored graphic formats such as JPEG, TIFF, and RAW. The types of printers used include inkjet printers, dye-sublimation printers, laser printers, and thermal printers. Inkjet prints are sometimes given the coined name \"Gicl\u00e9e\".\nThe Web has been a popular medium for storing and sharing photos ever since the first photograph was published on the web by Tim Berners-Lee in 1992 (an image of the CERN house band Les Horribles Cernettes). Today, popular sites such as Flickr, PhotoBucket, and 500px are used by millions of people to share their pictures.\nThe first \"selfie\", or self-portrait, was taken by Robert Cornelious back in 1839. \"Selfies\" have become one of the most common photographs.. Social media has become such a cultural advancement because of photography. People thrive off of the selfies of their favorite celebrities, many receive millions of likes on social media because of one simple selfie.\nPreservation.\nPaper folders.\nIdeal photograph storage involves placing each photo in an individual folder constructed from buffered, or acid-free paper. Buffered paper folders are especially recommended in cases when a photograph was previously mounted onto poor quality material or using an adhesive that will lead to even more acid creation. Store photographs measuring 8x10 inches or smaller vertically along the longer edge of the photo in the buffered paper folder, within a larger archival box, and label each folder with relevant information to identify it. The rigid nature of the folder protects the photo from slumping or creasing, as long as the box is not packed too tightly or under filled. Folder larger photos or brittle photos stacked flat within archival boxes with other materials of comparable size.\nPolyester enclosures.\nThe most stable of plastics used in photo preservation, polyester, does not generate any harmful chemical elements, nor does it have any capability to absorb acids generated by the photograph itself. Polyester sleeves and encapsulation have been praised for their ability to protect the photograph from humidity and environmental pollution, slowing the reaction between the item and the atmosphere. This is true, however the polyester just as frequently traps these elements next to the material it is intended to protect. This is especially risky in a storage environment that experiences drastic fluctuations in humidity or temperature, leading to ferrotyping, or sticking of the photograph to the plastic. Photographs sleeved or encapsulated in polyester cannot be stored vertically in boxes because they will slide down next to each other within the box, bending and folding, nor can the archivist write directly onto the polyester to identify the photograph. Therefore, it is necessary to either stack polyester protected photographs horizontally within a box, or bind them in a three ring binder. Stacking the photos horizontally within a flat box will greatly reduce ease of access, and binders leave three sides of the photo exposed to the effects of light and do not support the photograph evenly on both sides, leading to slumping and bending within the binder. The plastic used for enclosures has been manufactured to be as frictionless as possible to prevent scratching photos during insertion to the sleeves. Unfortunately, the slippery nature of the enclosure generates a build-up of static electricity, which attracts dust and lint particles. The static can attract the dust to the inside of the sleeve, as well, where it can scratch the photograph. Likewise, these components that aid in insertion of the photo, referred to as slip agents, can break down and transfer from the plastic to the photograph, where they deposit as an oily film, attracting further lint and dust. At this time, there is no test to evaluate the long-term effects of these components on photographs. In addition, the plastic sleeves can develop kinks or creases in the surface, which will scratch away at the emulsion during handling.\nHandling and care.\nIt is best to leave photographs lying flat on the table when viewing them. Do not pick it up from a corner, or even from two sides and hold it at eye level. Every time the photograph bends, even a little, this can break down the emulsion. The very nature of enclosing a photograph in plastic encourages users to pick it up; users tend to handle plastic enclosed photographs less gently than non-enclosed photographs, simply because they feel the plastic enclosure makes the photo impervious to all mishandling. As long as a photo is in its folder, there is no need to touch it; simply remove the folder from the box, lay it flat on the table, and open the folder. If for some reason the researchers or archivists do need to handle the actual photo, perhaps to examine the verso for writing, they can use gloves if there appears to be a risk from oils or dirt on the hands.\nMyths and beliefs.\nBecause daguerreotypes were rendered on a mirrored surface, many spiritualists also became practitioners of the new art form. Spiritualists would claim that the human image on the mirrored surface was akin to looking into one's soul. The spiritualists also believed that it would open their souls and let demons in. Among some Muslims, it is makruh (disliked) to perform salah (worship) in a place decorated with photographs. Photography and darkroom anomalies and artifacts sometimes lead viewers to believe that spirits or demons have been captured in photos. Some have made a career out of taking pictures of \"ghosts\" or \"spirits\". There are many instances where people believe photos will bring bad luck either to the person taking the picture or people captured in the photo. For instance, a photograph taken of a pregnant woman will bring bad luck to the baby in the womb and photos taken of dead people will ensure that person is not successful in the afterlife.\nLegality.\nThe production or distribution of certain types of photograph has been forbidden under modern laws, such as those of government buildings, highly classified regions, private property, copyrighted works, children's genitalia, child pornography and less commonly pornography overall. These laws vary greatly between jurisdictions.\nIn some public property owned by government, such as law courts, government buildings, libraries, civic centres and some of the museums in Hong Kong, photography is not allowed without permission from the government. It is illegal to equip or take photographs and recording in a place of public entertainment, such as cinemas and indoor theaters. In Hungary, from 15 March 2014 when the long-awaited Civil Code was published, the law re-stated what had been normal practice, namely, that a person had the right to refuse being photographed. However, implied consent exists: it is not illegal to photograph a person who does not actively object.\nIn South Africa photographing people in public is legal. Reproducing and selling photographs of people is legal for editorial and limited fair use commercial purposes. There exists no case law to define what the limits on commercial use are. In the United Kingdom there are no laws forbidding photography of private property from a public place. Persistent and aggressive photography of a single individual may come under the legal definition of harassment. A right to privacy came into existence in UK law as a consequence of the incorporation of the European Convention on Human Rights into domestic law through the Human Rights Act 1998. This can result in restrictions on the publication of photography.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is a concept in the philosophy of science that was introduced and brought into the common lexicon by the American physicist and philosopher Thomas Kuhn. Even though Kuhn restricted the use of the term to the natural sciences, the concept of a paradigm shift has also been used in numerous non-scientific contexts to describe a profound change in a fundamental model or perception of events.\nKuhn presented his notion of a paradigm shift in his influential book \"The Structure of Scientific Revolutions\" (1962).\nKuhn contrasts paradigm shifts, which characterize a Scientific Revolution, to the activity of normal science, which he describes as scientific work done within a prevailing framework or paradigm. Paradigm shifts arise when the dominant paradigm under which normal science operates is rendered incompatible with new phenomena, facilitating the adoption of a new theory or paradigm.\nAs one commentator summarizes:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Kuhn acknowledges having used the term \"paradigm\" in two different meanings. In the first one, \"paradigm\" designates what the members of a certain scientific community have in common, that is to say, the whole of techniques, patents and values shared by the members of the community. In the second sense, the paradigm is a single element of a whole, say for instance Newton's Principia, which, acting as a common model or an example... stands for the explicit rules and thus defines a coherent tradition of investigation. Thus the question is for Kuhn to investigate by means of the paradigm what makes possible the constitution of what he calls \"normal science\". That is to say, the science which can decide if a certain problem will be considered scientific or not. Normal science does not mean at all a science guided by a coherent system of rules, on the contrary, the rules can be derived from the paradigms, but the paradigms can guide the investigation also in the absence of rules. This is precisely the second meaning of the term \"paradigm\", which Kuhn considered the most new and profound, though it is in truth the oldest.\nHistory.\nThe nature of scientific revolutions has been studied by modern philosophy since Immanuel Kant used the phrase in the preface to the second edition of his \"Critique of Pure Reason\" (1787). Kant used the phrase \"revolution of the way of thinking\" () to refer to Greek mathematics and Newtonian physics. In the 20th century, new developments in the basic concepts of mathematics, physics, and biology revitalized interest in the question among scholars.\nOriginal usage.\nIn his 1962 book \"The Structure of Scientific Revolutions\", Kuhn explains the development of paradigm shifts in science into four stages:\nFeatures.\nParadigm shifts and progress.\nA common misinterpretation of paradigms is the belief that the discovery of paradigm shifts and the dynamic nature of science (with its many opportunities for subjective judgments by scientists) are a case for relativism: the view that all kinds of belief systems are equal. Kuhn vehemently denies this interpretation and states that when a scientific paradigm is replaced by a new one, albeit through a complex social process, the new one is \"always better\", not just different.\nIncommensurability.\nThese claims of relativism are, however, tied to another claim that Kuhn does at least somewhat endorse: that the language and theories of different paradigms cannot be translated into one another or rationally evaluated against one another\u2014that they are \"incommensurable\". This gave rise to much talk of different peoples and cultures having radically different worldviews or conceptual schemes\u2014so different that whether or not one was better, they could not be understood by one another.\nDonald Davidson famously argued against this idea of conceptual relativism, claiming that the notion that any languages or theories could be incommensurable with one another was itself incoherent. If this is correct, Kuhn's claims must be taken in a weaker sense than they often are.\nFurthermore, the hold of the Kuhnian analysis on social science has long been tenuous, with the wide application of multi-paradigmatic approaches in order to understand complex human behaviour.\nGradualism vs. sudden change.\nParadigm shifts tend to be most dramatic in sciences that appear to be stable and mature, as in physics at the end of the 19th century. At that time, physics seemed to be a discipline filling in the last few details of a largely worked-out system.\nIn \"The Structure of Scientific Revolutions\", Kuhn wrote, \"Successive transition from one paradigm to another via revolution is the usual developmental pattern of mature science\" (p.\u00a012). Kuhn's idea was itself revolutionary in its time as it caused a major change in the way that academics talk about science. Thus, it could be argued that it caused or was itself part of a \"paradigm shift\" in the history and sociology of science. However, Kuhn would not recognise such a paradigm shift. In the social sciences, people can still use earlier ideas to discuss the history of science.\nPhilosophers and historians of science, including Kuhn himself, ultimately accepted a modified version of Kuhn's model, which synthesizes his original view with the gradualist model that preceded it.\nExamples.\nNatural sciences.\nSome of the \"classical cases\" of Kuhnian paradigm shifts in science are:\nSocial sciences.\nIn Kuhn's view, the existence of a single reigning paradigm is characteristic of the natural sciences, while philosophy and much of social science were characterized by a \"tradition of claims, counterclaims, and debates over fundamentals.\" Others have applied Kuhn's concept of paradigm shift to the social sciences.\nApplied sciences.\nMore recently, paradigm shifts are also recognisable in applied sciences:\nOther uses.\nThe term \"paradigm shift\" has found uses in other contexts, representing the notion of a major change in a certain thought pattern\u2014a radical change in personal beliefs, complex systems or organizations, replacing the former way of thinking or organizing with a radically different way of thinking or organizing:\nCriticism.\nIn a 2015 retrospective on Kuhn, the philosopher Martin Cohen describes the notion of the paradigm shift as a kind of intellectual virus \u2013 spreading from hard science to social science and on to the arts and even everyday political rhetoric today. Cohen claims that Kuhn had only a very hazy idea of what it might mean and, in line with the Austrian philosopher of science Paul Feyerabend, accuses Kuhn of retreating from the more radical implications of his theory, which are that scientific facts are never really more than opinions whose popularity is transitory and far from conclusive. Cohen says scientific knowledge is less certain than it is usually portrayed, and that science and knowledge generally is not the 'very sensible and reassuringly solid sort of affair' that Kuhn describes, in which progress involves periodic paradigm shifts in which much of the old certainties are abandoned in order to open up new approaches to understanding that scientists would never have considered valid before. He argues that information cascades can distort rational, scientific debate. He has focused on health issues, including the example of highly mediatised 'pandemic' alarms, and why they have turned out eventually to be little more than scares.\nOne of the early critics of Kuhn, Norwood Russell Hanson criticized Kuhn's paradigm shift theory as being conceptually circular and therefore impossible to falsifiable.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt; \nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "25084", "revid": "346308", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25084", "title": "Public speaking", "text": "Performing a speech to a live audience\nPublic speaking is the practice of delivering speeches to a live audience. Throughout history, public speaking has held significant cultural, religious, and political importance, emphasizing the necessity of effective rhetorical skills. It allows individuals to connect with a group of people to discuss any topic. The goal as a public speaker may be to educate, teach, or influence an audience. Public speakers often utilize visual aids like a slideshow, pictures, and short videos to get their point across. \nThe ancient Chinese philosopher Confucius, a key figure in the study of public speaking, advocated for speeches that could profoundly affect individuals, including those not present in the audience. He believed that words possess the power to inspire actions capable of changing the world. In the Western tradition, public speaking was extensively studied in Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome, where it was a fundamental component of rhetoric, analyzed by prominent thinkers.\nAristotle, the ancient Greek philosopher, identified three types of speeches: deliberative (political), forensic (judicial), and epideictic (ceremonial or demonstrative). Similarly, the Roman philosopher and orator Cicero categorized public speaking into three purposes: judicial (courtroom), deliberative (political), and demonstrative (ceremonial), closely aligning with Aristotle's classifications. \nIn modern times, public speaking remains a highly valued skill in various sectors, including government, industry, and advocacy. It has also evolved with the advent of digital technologies, incorporating video conferencing, multimedia presentations, and other innovative forms of communication.\nPurposes.\nThe main objective of public speaking is to inform or change the audience's thoughts and actions. The function of public speaking is determined by the speaker's intent, but it is possible for the same speaker, with the same intent, to deliver substantially different speeches to different audiences.\nPublic speaking is frequently directed at a select and sometimes restricted audience, consisting of individuals who may hold different perspectives. This audience can encompass enthusiastic supporters of the speaker, reluctant attendees with opposing views, or strangers with varying levels of interest in the speaker's topic. Proficient speakers recognize that even a modest-sized audience is not a uniform entity but rather a diverse assembly of individuals.\nPublic speaking aims to either reassure an anxious audience or to alert a complacent audience of something important. Once the speaker has determined which of these approaches is required, they will use a combination of storytelling and informational approaches to achieve their goals.\nThe purposes of speech can vary depending on the targeted audience. Speeches during ceremonies may incorporate humor or stories shared from moments in the life of the person celebrated. Speeches focusing on politics will use persuasion that listeners take a course of action, and forensic speeches are debates in which participants take sides, defend certain beliefs, and are judged on how well they can support their argument.\nPersuasion.\nPersuasion is a term that is derived from the Latin word \"persuadere.\" Persuasive speaking aims to change the audience's beliefs and is commonly used in political debates. Leaders use such public forums in an attempt to persuade their audience, whether they be the general public or government officials.\nPersuasive speaking involves four essential elements: (i) the speaker or persuader; (ii) the audience; (iii) the speaking method; and (iv) the message the speaker is trying to convey. When attempting to persuade an audience to change their opinions, a speaker appeals to their emotions and beliefs.\nVarious techniques exist for speakers to gain audience support. Speakers can demand action from the audience, use inclusive language like 'we' and 'us' to create unity between the speaker and the audience, and choose words with strong connotations to intensify a message's impact. Rhetorical questions, anecdotes, generalizations, exaggerations, metaphors, and irony may be employed to increase the likelihood of persuading an audience.\nThough historically uncommon, speakers today are enabled to utilise statistics, data as well as other sources of information, such as the internet, in order to strengthen their argument, stance or proposal; This has only evolved during the modern era, having been generally unavailable at the current rate in the years beforehand with the exception of media via newspapers, television, although claims given by speakers have often been subject to inaccurate information provided by the aforementioned, often in direct correlation with the big lie means of oratory. This has been further intensified through the recent evolution of mass media in most nations.\nEducation.\nPublic speaking can often take an educational form, where the speaker transfers knowledge to an audience. TED Talks are an example of educational public speaking. The speakers inform their audience about different topics, such as science, technology, religion, economics, human society, and psychology. TED speakers can use the platform to share personal experiences with traumatic events, such as abuse, bullying, grief, assault, suicidal ideation, near-death encounters, and mental illness. They may attempt to raise awareness and acceptance of stigmatizing issues, such as disabilities, racial differences, LGBTQ rights, children's rights, and women's rights.\nTED Conferences, LLC, is a media organization that posts talks online for free distribution under the slogan: \"ideas worth spreading\". TED was originally built by Richard Saul Furman in February 1984 as a conference and has been held annually since 1990. Talks delivered in these conferences are usually posted online. The videos of these recorded speeches and talks inspire native and non-native speakers of English to learn the language and presentation style that is used. As such, TED Talk videos can help improve speaking skills and vocabulary retention. \nThere have been many studies that have proven the benefits of teaching public speaking strategies to students in an academic setting, including a higher level of self-confidence and helping to render community well-being with access to a variety of information. Harvard University offers a range of courses in public speaking, including persuasive communication and personal narratives. With the continued popularity of academic conferences and TED talks taking place worldwide, public speaking has become an essential subject in academia for scholarly and professional advancement. Additionally, work meetings and presentations require proficiency in public speaking to actively formulate ideas and solutions, and modern technology helps companies release information to a wider audience.\nIntervention.\nThe intervention style of speaking is a relatively new method proposed by rhetorical theorist William R. Brown. This style revolves around the theory of idealism, which holds that humans create a symbolic meaning for life and the things around them. Due to this, the symbolic meaning of everything changes based on the way one communicates. When approaching communication with an intervention style, communication is understood to be responsible for the constant changes in society, behaviors, and how one considers the meaning behind objects, ideologies, and everyday life.\nFrom an interventional perspective, when individuals communicate, they are intervening with what is already a reality and might \"shift symbolic reality.\" This approach to communication encompasses the possibility or idea that one may be responsible for unexpected outcomes due to what and how one communicates.\nThis perspective widens the scope of focus from a single speaker who is intervening to a multitude of speakers all communicating and intervening, simultaneously affecting the world around us.\nHistory.\nIndia.\nThe literature of Ancient India is richly endowed with contributions to the development of a \"sui generis\" theory of rhetoric. In ancient India, around 700 BCE, public debates by Indian rhetors on the topic of religion were a popular form of entertainment. The Vedic hymns, composed over three millennia ago, demonstrate a refined sense of rhetoric possessed by the intellectual stratum of the society, as seen in their effective employment of similes.\nThe Ramayana and the Mahabharata, India's iconic epics, provide valuable insights into the country's ancient rhetorical traditions, featuring numerous speeches and debates that employ sophisticated systems of categorization. The Upanishads, a seminal work of Vedic philosophical dialogues, exhibit a thoughtful approach to categorizing technical terms, underscoring the value of clear classification. The famed Hindu discourse known as the Bhagavad Gita (in the Mahabharata) serves as a classic example of deliberative rhetoric.\nThe Buddhist tradition of India places emphasis on the value of engaging in calm and humorous discourse.\nChina.\nIn Ancient China, the use of rhetoric was delayed, largely because the country then lacked rhetoricians who could train students. It was understood that Chinese rhetoric was part of Chinese philosophy, which schools taught focusing on two concepts: \"Wen\" (rhetoric); and \"Zhi\" (thoughtful content). Ancient Chinese rhetoric shows strong connections with modern public speaking, as Chinese rhetoric placed a high value on ethics.\nAncient Chinese rhetoric had three objectives: (i) using language to reflect people's feelings; (ii) using language to be more pointed, effective, and impactful; and (iii) using rhetoric as an \"aesthetic tool.\" Chinese rhetoric traditionally focused more on the written than the spoken word, but both share similar characteristics of construction.\nA unique and key difference between Chinese and Western rhetoric is the audience targeted for persuasion. In Chinese rhetoric, state rulers were the audience, whereas Western rhetoric targets the public. Another difference between Chinese and Western rhetoric practices is how a speaker establishes credibility or Ethos. In Chinese rhetoric, the speaker does not focus on individual credibility, like Western rhetoric. Instead, the speaker focuses on collectivism by sharing personal experiences and establishing a connection between the speaker's concern and the audience's interest.\nChinese employs three standards in assessing public rhetoric:\nGreece.\nAlthough evidence of public speaking training exists in ancient Egypt, the first known writing on oratory is 2,000 years old from ancient Greece. This work elaborates on principles drawn from the practices and experiences of ancient Greek orators.\nAristotle, one of the first oratory teachers to use definitive rules and models, believed that successful speakers combined, to varying degrees, three qualities in their speech: reasoning, which he called Logos; credentials, which he called Ethos; and emotion, which he called Pathos. Aristotle's work became an essential part of a liberal arts education during the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. The classical antiquity works by the ancient Greeks capture how they taught and developed the art of public speaking thousands of years ago.\nIn classical Greece and Rome, rhetoric was the main component of composition and speech delivery, both critical skills for use in public and private life. In ancient Greece, citizens spoke for themselves rather than having professionals, such as modern lawyers, speak for them. Any citizen who wished to succeed in court, politics, or social life had to learn public speaking techniques. Rhetorical tools were first taught by a group of teachers called Sophists, who taught paying students how to speak effectively using their methods.\nSeparately from the Sophists, Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle developed their theories of public speaking, teaching these principles to students interested in learning rhetorical skills. Plato founded The Academy and Aristotle founded The Lyceum to teach these skills.\nDemosthenes was a well-known orator from Athens. After his father died when he was 7, he had three legal guardians: Aphobus, Demophon, and Theryppides. His inspiration for public speaking came from learning that his guardians had robbed him of the money his father left for his education. His first public speech was in the court proceeding he brought against his three guardians. After that, Demosthenes continued to practice public speaking. He is known for sticking pebbles into his mouth to improve his pronunciation, talking while running so that he would not lose his breath, and practicing speaking in front of a mirror to improve his delivery.\nWhen Philip II, the ruler of Macedon, tried to conquer the Greeks, Demosthenes made a speech called \"Kata Philippou A.\" In this speech, he spoke about why he opposed Philip II as a threat to all of Greece. This was the first of several speeches known as the Philippics. He made other speeches known as the Olynthiacs. Both series of speeches favored independence and rallied Athenians against Philip II.\nRome.\nDuring the political rise of the Roman Republic, Roman orators copied and modified the ancient Greek techniques of public speaking. Instruction in rhetoric developed into a full curriculum, including instruction in grammar (study of the poets), preliminary exercises (progymnasmata), and preparation of public speeches (declamation) in both forensic and deliberative genres.\nIn Latin, rhetoric was heavily influenced by Cicero, an orator during the Roman Empire, and emphasized a broad education in all areas of the humanities. Other areas of rhetorical study included the use of wit and humor, the appeal to the listener's emotions, and the use of digressions. Oratory in the Roman Empire, though less central to political life than during the Republic, remained important in law and entertainment. Famous orators were celebrities in ancient Rome, becoming wealthy and prominent in society.\nThe ornate Latin style was the primary form of oration through the mid-20th century. After World War II and the increased use of film and television, the Latin oration style began to fall out of favor. This cultural change likely had to do with the rise of the scientific method and the emphasis on a \"plain\" style of speaking and writing. Even today's formal oratory is much less ornate than in the Classical Era.\nTheorists.\nAristotle's \"Rhetoric\".\nIn one of his most famed writings, \"Rhetoric\", written in 350 BCE, Aristotle described mastering the art of public speaking. In this and other works by Aristotle, rhetoric is the act of publicly persuading an audience. Rhetoric is similar to dialect: he defines both as being acts of persuasion. However, dialect is the act of persuading someone in private, whereas rhetoric is about persuading people in a public setting. Aristotle defines someone who practices rhetoric or a \"rhetorician\" as an individual who can comprehend persuasion and how it is applied.\nAristotle divides rhetoric into three elements: (i) the speaker; (ii) the topic or point of the speech; and (iii) the audience. Aristotle also classifies oration into three types: (i) political, used to convince people to take or not take action; (ii) forensic, usually used in law related to accusing or defending someone; and (iii) ceremonial, which recognizes someone positively or negatively.\nAristotle breaks down the political category into five focuses or themes: \"ways and means, war and peace, national defense, imports and exports, and legislation.\" These focuses are broken down into detail so that the speaker can effectively influence an audience to agree and support the speaker's ideas.\nIn Aristotle's \"Rhetoric\" writing, he mentions three strategies someone can use to try to persuade an audience: Establishing the character of a speaker (Ethos), influencing the emotional element of the audience (Pathos), and focusing on the argument specifically (Logos). Aristotle believes establishing the character of a speaker is effective in persuasion because the audience will believe what the speaker is saying to be true if the speaker is credible and trustworthy. With the audience's emotional state, Aristotle believes that individuals do not make the same decisions when in different moods. Because of this, one needs to try to influence the audience by being in control of one's emotions, making persuasion effective. The argument itself can affect the attempt to persuade by making the argument of the case so clear and valid that the audience will understand and believe that the speaker's point is real.\nIn the last part of \"Rhetoric\", Aristotle mentions that the most critical piece of persuasion is to know in detail what makes up government and to attack what makes it unique: \"customs, institutions, and interest\". Aristotle also states that everyone is persuaded by considering people's interests and how the society in which they live influences their interests.\nCicero's Five Canons of Rhetoric.\nIn his writing \"De Inventione\", Cicero explained the five canons or tenets of rhetoric. The five canons apply to rhetoric and public speaking. The five canons are invention, arrangement, style, memory, and delivery.\nInvention is the process of coming up with what to say to persuade the audience of the key points. Individuals will need to understand their topic, brainstorm their ideas, and discover effective research strategies that they can use to get their point across. Arrangement is the process of structuring ideas together. Cicero and the Roman rhetorician Quintilian identified the structure of a text as Exordium, Narrative, Partition, Confirmation, Refutation, and Peroration (or conclusion). In today's text, the structure has been reduced to introduction, body, and conclusion. Style is the process of choosing language and constructing your presentation to create an emotional response from the audience. Individuals can achieve this by using language and rhetoric devices like analogy, allusion and alliteration.\nMemory is remembering enough so that individuals are able to fully and fluently present without reading off a paper or note cards. This includes figures of speech, which can be used to improve memory. Roman rhetoricians made a distinction between natural memory (an innate ability) and artificial memory (particular techniques that enhanced natural abilities). \u00a0Delivery is the last of the five canons of rhetoric. It Involves using all the tools available to effectively communicate. Methods and tools like tone of voice, change of pace, pauses, volume, body language, positioning and props are all effective in delivering the point. \nGlossophobia.\nThe fear of speaking in public, known as glossophobia or public speaking anxiety, is often mentioned as one of the most common phobias. The reason is uncertain, but it has been speculated that this fear is primal, similar to how animals fear being seen by predators.\nThe apprehension experienced when speaking in public can have several causes, such as social anxiety disorder, or a prior experience of public humiliation. This can be related to stage fright.\nTraining.\nEffective public speaking can be developed by joining a club such as Rostrum, Toastmasters International, Association of Speakers Clubs (ASC), or Speaking Circles, in which members are assigned exercises to improve their speaking skills. Members learn by observation and practice and hone their skills by listening to constructive suggestions, followed by new public speaking exercises.\nTips for improving public speaking:\nToastmasters International.\nToastmasters International is a public speaking organization with over 15,000 clubs worldwide and more than 300,000 members. This organization helps individuals with their public speaking skills, as well as leadership skills necessary to become effective public speakers such as content development, club development, and speech contests. Members of the club meet and work together on their skills; each member practices giving speeches, while the other members evaluate and provide feedback. A typical meeting also includes Table Topics, which refers to impromptu speaking, that is, talking about different topics without having anything planned. Members can volunteer to serve as a meeting functionary to help facilitate the meeting using their public speaking and leadership skills. The functionary roles enable each member the opportunity to speak at least one time at the meetings. Members can participate in a variety of speech contests, in which the winners can compete in the annual World Championship of Public Speaking.\nAustralian Rostrum.\nRostrum is another public speaking organization, founded in Australia, with more than 100 clubs all over the country. This organization aims at helping people become better communicators, no matter the occasion. At the meetings, speakers can gain skills by presenting speeches, while members provide feedback to those presenting. Qualified speaking trainers attend these meetings as well, and provide professional feedback at the end of the meetings. There are competitions that are held for members to participate in. An online club is also available for members, no matter where they live.\nSelf-training solutions.\nThe new millennium has seen a notable increase in the number of training solutions, offered in the form of video and online courses. Videos can provide simulated examples of behaviors to emulate. Professional public speakers often engage in ongoing training and education to refine their craft. This may include seeking guidance to improve their speaking skills, such as learning better storytelling techniques, learning how to use humor as a communication tool effectively, and continuously researching their topic area of focus. They also recognize that content is king and advocate writing as a self-training exercise because it requires a speaker to focus on developing the content, not just speaking techniques.\nProfessional speakers.\nPublic speaking for business and commercial events is often done by professionals, whose expertise is well established. These speakers can be contracted independently, through representation by a speakers bureau, or by other means. Public speaking plays a large role in the professional world. It is believed that 70 percent of all jobs involve some form of public speaking. Most professional roles require some sort of public speaking skills. Individuals will often be expected to perform tasks like training staff, leading meetings, and pitching proposals.\nModern.\nTechnology.\nNew technology has opened different forms of public speaking that are non-traditional such as TED Talks, which are conferences that are broadcast globally. This form of public speaking has created a wider audience base because public speaking can now reach both physical and virtual audiences. These audiences can be watching from all around the world. YouTube is another platform that allows public speaking to reach a larger audience. On YouTube, people can post videos of themselves. Audiences can watch these videos for all types of purposes.\nMultimedia presentations can contain different video clips, sound effects, animation, laser pointers, remote control clickers, and endless bullet points. All adding to the presentation and evolving our traditional views of public speaking.\nPublic speakers may use audience response systems. For large assemblies, the speaker will usually speak with the aid of a public address system or microphone and loudspeaker.\nTelecommunication.\nTelecommunication and videoconferencing are also forms of public speaking.

Fetterman of Stanford University wrote in his 1997 article \"Videoconferencing over the Internet\": \"Videoconferencing technology allows geographically disparate parties to hear and see each other usually through satellite or telephone communication systems.\" This technology is helpful for large conference meetings and face-to-face communication between parties without demanding the inconvenience of travel.\nWomen and public speaking.\nAustralia.\nAn organization called the Penguin Club of Australia was founded in Sydney in 1937 and aimed at developing women's communication skills. Led by Jean Ellis, the organization spread to other territories of Australia and current-day Papua New Guinea over time. A main premise of the organization was that it was created \"for women by women.\" They renamed to \"Speaking Made Easy\" in 2020.\nGreat Britain.\nThe British political activist, Emmeline Pankhurst, founded the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU) on October 10, 1903. The organization was aimed towards fighting for women's right to a parliamentary vote, which only men were granted at the time. Emmeline was known for being a powerful orator, who led many women to rebel through militant forms until the outbreak of World War I in 1914.\nJapan.\nKishida Toshiko (1861\u20131901) was a female speaker during the Meiji era in Japan. In October 1883, she publicly delivered a speech entitled 'Hakoiri Musume' (Daughters Kept in Boxes) in front of approximately 600 people. Presented in Yotsu no Miya Theater in Kyoto, she criticized the action of parents that shelter their daughters from the outside world. Despite her prompt arrest, Kishida demonstrated the ability of Japanese women to evoke women's issues, experiences, and liberation in public spaces, through the use of public speaking.\nPakistan.\nMalala Yousafzai, a public speaker born in the Swat Valley in Pakistan, is an educational activist for women and girls. After the Taliban restricted the educational rights of women in the Swat Valley, Yousafzai presented her first speech, \"How Dare the Taliban Take Away My Basic Right to Education?\", in which she protested the shutdowns of the schools. She presented this speech to the press in Peshawar, bringing more awareness to the situation in Pakistan. She is known for her \"inspiring and passionate speech\" about educational rights given at the United Nations. She is the youngest person ever to receive the Nobel Peace Prize, at the age of 17, which was awarded to her in 2014. Her public speaking has brought worldwide attention to the difficulties of young girls in Pakistan. She continues to advocate for educational rights for women and girls worldwide through the Malala Fund, to help girls around the world receive 12 years of education.\nUnited States.\nDuring the 18th and 19th centuries in the United States, a prohibition was instituted whereby women were precluded from engaging in public discourse within the confines of the courtroom, the Senate floor, and the pulpit. It was deemed improper for a woman to be heard in a public setting. Exceptions existed for women from the Quaker religion, allowing them to speak publicly in meetings of the church.\nFrances Wright was one of the first female public speakers in the United States, advocating equal education for both women and men through large audiences and the press. Maria Stewart, a woman of African American descent, was also one of the first female speakers of the United States, lecturing in Boston in front of both men and women just four years after Wright, in 1832 and 1833, on educational opportunities and abolition for young girls.\nThe first female agents and sisters of the American Anti-Slavery Society Angelina Grimk\u00e9 and Sarah Grimk\u00e9 created a platform for public lectures to women and conducted tours between 1837 and 1839. The sisters advocated that slavery relates to women's rights and that women need equality. They came to a disagreement with churches that did not want the two speaking publicly due to them being women.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The name \"pecorino\" means 'ovine' or 'of sheep' in Italian; the name of the cheese, although protected, is a description rather than a brand: [\"formaggio\"] \"pecorino romano\" means 'sheep's [cheese] of Rome'.\nAlthough this variety of cheese originated in Lazio, nearly all of its actual production has moved to the island of Sardinia. The name \"pecorino romano\" has a protected designation of origin (PDO) by European Union law, meaning all manufacturing processes must take place within either Sardinia, Lazio or the province of Grosseto.\n\"Pecorino romano\" was a staple in the diet of the legionaries of ancient Rome. Today, it is still made according to the original recipe and is one of Italy's oldest cheeses. On the first of May (May Day), Roman families traditionally eat pecorino with fresh fava beans during an excursion in the Roman Campagna. It is mostly used in central and southern Italy.\nAs of 2024[ [update]], it is the fourth most exported Italian cheese, with 22,000 tons exported overseas annually.\nHistory.\nWhat might be considered the earliest form of today's \"pecorino romano\" was first created in the countryside around Rome, whose production methods are described in detail by Latin authors such as Marcus Terentius Varro and Pliny the Elder about 2,000 years ago. Its long-term storage capacity led to it being used for feeding Roman legions. A daily ration of about 27 grams (1 Roman ounce) was allotted to the legionaries in addition to bread and farro soup. The cheese revived strength and vigour since it was a high-energy food that was easy to digest. \n\"Pecorino romano\" was mainly produced in the region surrounding Rome (Lazio) until the end of the 19th century. In 1884, the Roman city council prohibited salting the cheese in the grocers' shops in Rome, but this could not prevent the establishment of salting premises and cheesemaking premises on the outskirts of Rome or elsewhere in the province. Pressure to move production out of Lazio was in fact caused by a great increase in demand for the cheese, which the Lazio flocks could not satisfy. This led several producers to expand their production in Sardinia. Sardinia, which had been experiencing a severe reduction of its forest cover as a direct result of human activity, provided Roman entrepreneurs with a type of soil that was ideal for the promotion of monoculture farming.\nFollowing the 1951 Stresa Convention, which was convened by several European states to address the question of counterfeiting and imitation of traditional food products, and the awarding in 1955 of the first \"denominazione di origine controllata\" (DOC) statuses in the dairy sector, pecorino cheese production was formally protected in Sardinia, Lazio, and Grosseto. \nIn 1979, the Consortium for the Protection of Pecorino Romano Cheese was established with headquarters in Macomer, a \"comune\" with several established cheese factories. In 1981 the Consortium was tasked by the Ministry of Agriculture to supervise the production and trade of \"pecorino romano\", and in 2002 to protect its PDO status.\nProduction.\n\"Pecorino romano\" is a hard, cooked cheese produced exclusively from sheep milk. The milk is coagulated using rennet at a temperature between . Once the curd has hardened, it is broken into smaller curds the size of a grain of rice and cooked at a temperature no higher than . \"Pecorino romano\" must be made with rennet from sheep raised in the same production area, and is consequently not suitable for vegetarians.\nThe wheels are cylindrical with flat faces, with a height of 25\u201340 cm and a diameter of 25\u201335 cm, and weigh . They have a thin ivory-coloured rind which is sometimes covered with substances for food protection. They are stamped with the logo of geographical distinction and an indication of the province of origin.\n40% of produced \"pecorino romano\" is consumed domestically. More than half of international exports are destined for the United States.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

His predecessors had been known as kings of the Franks (Latin: \"rex Francorum\"), but from 1190 onward, Philip became the first French monarch to style himself \"King of France\" (\"rex Francie\"). The son of King Louis VII and his third wife, Adela of Champagne, he was originally nicknamed 'God-given' () because he was a first son and born late in his father's life. Philip was given the epithet \"Augustus\" by the chronicler Rigord for having extended the crown lands of France so remarkably.\nAfter decades of conflicts with the House of Plantagenet, Philip succeeded in putting an end to the Angevin Empire by defeating a coalition of his rivals at the Battle of Bouvines in 1214. This victory would have a lasting impact on western European politics: the authority of the French king became unchallenged, while John, King of England, was forced by his barons to assent to Magna Carta and deal with a rebellion against him aided by Philip's son Louis, the First Barons' War. The military actions surrounding the Albigensian Crusade helped prepare the expansion of France southward. Philip did not participate directly in these actions, but he allowed his vassals and knights to help carry them out.\nPhilip transformed France into the most prosperous and powerful country in Europe. He checked the power of the nobles and helped the towns free themselves from seigneurial authority, granting privileges and liberties to the emergent bourgeoisie. He built a great wall around Paris (\"the Wall of Philip II Augustus\"), re-organised the French government, and brought financial stability to his country.\nEarly years.\nPhilip was born in Gonesse on 21 August 1165, the son of Louis VII and Adela of Champagne. He was nicknamed \"Dieudonn\u00e9\" (God-given) being the first born son, arriving late in his father's life. In 1173, the Emperor Frederick Barbarossa proposed to marry his daughter, Beatrice (born c.\u20091163), to Philip. The proposal was successfully opposed by Pope Alexander III, since at the time Barbarossa recognized a rival pope in Callixtus III.\nLouis intended to make Philip co-ruler with him, in accordance with the traditions of the House of Capet, but these plans were delayed when Philip became ill after a hunting trip. His father went on pilgrimage to the shrine of Thomas Becket in Canterbury Cathedral to pray for Philip's recovery, and was told that his son had indeed recovered. However, on his way back to Paris, the king suffered a stroke.\nIn declining health, Louis VII had 14-year-old Philip crowned and anointed as king at Reims on 1 November 1179 by Archbishop William of the White Hands. Philip was married on 28 April 1180 to Isabella of Hainault, the daughter of Count Baldwin V of Hainaut and Countess Margaret I of Flanders. Isabella brought the County of Artois as her dowry. The marriage was held at Bapaume, with the bishops of Senlis and Laon in attendance.\nFrom the time of his coronation, all real power was transferred to Philip, as his father's health slowly declined. The great nobles were dissatisfied with Philip's advantageous marriage. His mother and four uncles, all of whom exercised enormous influence over Louis, were extremely unhappy with his attainment of the throne since Philip had taken the royal seal from his father. Louis died on 18 September 1180.\nConsolidation of the royal demesne.\nThe royal demesne had increased under Philip I and Louis VI, but had slightly diminished under Louis VII. The first major increase to the royal demesne came in 1185, when Philip acquired the County of Amiens. He purchased the County of Clermont-en-Beauvaisis in 1218, and following the death of Robert I, Count of Alen\u00e7on in 1219, Philip obtained the city and county of Alen\u00e7on. Philip's eldest son, Louis, inherited the County of Artois in 1190 when Queen Isabella died.\nRoyal army.\nThe main source of funding for Philip's army was the royal demesne. In times of conflict, he could immediately call up 250 knights, 250 horse sergeants, 100 mounted crossbowmen, 133 crossbowmen on foot, 2,000 foot sergeants, and 300 mercenaries. Towards the end of his reign, the king could muster some 3,000 knights, 9,000 sergeants, 6,000 urban militiamen, and thousands of foot sergeants. Using his increased revenues, Philip was the first Capetian king to build a French navy actively. By 1215, his fleet could carry a total of 7,000 men. Within two years, his fleet included 10 large ships and many smaller ones.\nExpulsion of Jews.\nReversing his father's tolerance and protection of Jews, Philip in 1180 ordered French Jews to be stripped of their valuables, ransomed and converted to Christianity on pain of further taxation. In April 1182, partially to enrich the French crown, he expelled all Jews from the demesne and confiscated their goods. Philip expelled them from the royal demesne in July 1182 and had Jewish houses in Paris demolished to make way for the Les Halles market. The measures were profitable in the short-term, the ransoms alone bringing in 15,000 marks and enriching Christians at the expense of Jews. Ninety-nine Jews were burned alive in Brie-Comte-Robert. In 1198, Philip allowed Jews to return.\nWars with his vassals.\nIn 1181, a conflict arose between Philip and Count Philip I of Flanders over the Vermandois, which King Philip claimed as his wife's dowry. Finally the Count of Flanders invaded France, ravaging the whole district between the Somme and the Oise before penetrating as far as Dammartin. Notified of Philip's approach with 2,000 knights, he headed back to Flanders. Philip chased him, and the two armies confronted each other near Amiens. By this stage, Philip had managed to counter the ambitions of the count by breaking his alliances with Duke Henry I of Brabant and the Archbishop of Cologne, Philipp von Heinsberg. This, together with an uncertain outcome were he to engage the French in battle, forced the Count to conclude a peace. In July 1185, the Treaty of Boves left the disputed territory partitioned, with Ami\u00e9nois, Artois, and numerous other places passing to the king, and the remainder, with the county of Vermandois proper, left provisionally to the Count of Flanders. It was during this time that Philip II was nicknamed \"Augustus\" by the monk Rigord for augmenting French lands.\nMeanwhile, in 1184, Stephen I, Count of Sancerre, and his Braban\u00e7on mercenaries ravaged the Orl\u00e9anais. Philip defeated him with the aid of the Confr\u00e8res de la Paix.\nWar with Henry II.\nA disagreement arose between Philip and King Henry II of England, who was also Count of Anjou and Duke of Normandy and Aquitaine in France. The death of Henry's eldest son, Henry the Young King, in June 1183, began a dispute over the dowry of Philip's widowed sister Margaret. Philip insisted that the dowry should be returned to France as the marriage did not produce any children, per the betrothal agreement. The two kings would hold conferences at the foot of an elm tree near Gisors, which was so positioned that it would overshadow each monarch's territory, but to no avail. Philip pushed the case further when King B\u00e9la III of Hungary asked for the widow's hand in marriage, and thus her dowry had to be returned, to which Henry finally agreed.\nThe death of Henry's fourth son, Geoffrey II, Duke of Brittany, began a new round of disputes, as Henry insisted that he retain the guardianship of the duchy for his unborn grandson Arthur I, Duke of Brittany. Philip, as Henry's liege lord, objected, stating that he should be the rightful guardian until the birth of the child. Philip then raised the issue of his other sister, Alys, Countess of Vexin, and her delayed betrothal to Henry's son Richard I of England, nicknamed Richard the Lionheart.\nWith these grievances, two years of combat followed (1186\u20131188), but the situation remained unchanged. Philip initially allied with Henry's young sons Richard the Lionheart and John, who were in rebellion against their father. The first attempt to seriously test Henry's resolve came when Philip II launched an attack on Berry in the summer of 1187 and captured the fortress of Issoudun, but by June made a truce with Henry, which left Issoudun in Philip's hands while also granting him Fr\u00e9teval in Vend\u00f4mois. Though the truce was for two years, Philip found grounds for resuming hostilities in the summer of 1188 and succeeded in seizing Ch\u00e2teauroux. He skillfully exploited the estrangement between Henry and Richard, and Richard did homage to him voluntarily at Bonsmoulins in November 1188.\nIn 1189, as Henry's health was failing, Richard openly joined forces with Philip to drive him into submission. They chased him from Le Mans to Saumur, capturing Tours in the process, before forcing him to acknowledge Richard as his heir. Finally, by the Treaty of Azay-le-Rideau (4 July 1189), Henry was forced to renew his own homage, confirm the cession of Issoudun to Philip (along with Gra\u00e7ay), and renounce his claim to suzerainty over Auvergne. Henry died two days later. His death and the news of the fall of Jerusalem to Saladin, diverted attention from the Franco-English war.\nThe Angevin kings of England (the line of rulers to which Henry II belonged), were Philip's most powerful and dangerous vassals as Dukes of Normandy and Aquitaine and Counts of Anjou. Philip made it his life's work to destroy Angevin power in France. One of his most effective tools was to befriend all of Henry's sons and use them to foment rebellion against their father. He maintained friendships with Henry the Young King and Geoffrey, Duke of Brittany until their deaths. Indeed, at Geoffrey's funeral, he was so overcome with grief that he had to be forcibly restrained from casting himself into the grave. He broke off his friendships with Henry's other sons Richard and John as each ascended to the English throne.\nThird Crusade.\nPhilip travelled to the Holy Land to participate in the Third Crusade of 1189\u20131192 with King Richard I of England and Holy Roman Emperor Frederick I Barbarossa, leaving V\u00e9zelay with his army on 4 July 1190. At first, the French and English crusaders travelled together, but the armies split at Lyon after Richard decided to go by sea from Marseille, whereas Philip took the overland route through the Alps to Genoa. The French and English armies were reunited in Messina, where they wintered together. On 30 March 1191, the French set sail for the Holy Land and on 20 April Philip arrived at Acre, which was already under siege by a lesser contingent of crusaders, and he started to construct siege equipment before Richard arrived on 8 June. By the time Acre surrendered on 12 July, Philip was severely ill with dysentery, which reduced his zeal. Ties with Richard were further strained after the latter acted in a haughty manner after Acre fell to the crusaders.\nMore importantly, the siege of Acre resulted in the death of Philip, Count of Flanders, who held the county of Vermandois proper. His death threatened to derail the Treaty of Gisors that Philip had orchestrated to isolate the powerful Blois-Champagne faction. Philip decided to return to France to settle the issue of succession in Flanders, a decision that displeased Richard, who said, \"It is a shame and a disgrace on my lord if he goes away without having finished the business that brought him hither. But still, if he finds himself in bad health, or is afraid lest he should die here, his will be done.\" On 31 July 1191, the French army of 10,000 men (along with 5,000 silver marks to pay the soldiers) remained in Outremer under the command of Duke Hugh III of Burgundy. Philip and his cousin Peter of Courtenay, Count of Nevers, made their way to Rome, where Philip protested to Pope Celestine III (to no avail) of Richard's abusive manner, and from there returned to France. The decision to return was also fuelled by the realization that with Richard campaigning in the Holy Land, English possessions in northern France would be open to attack. After Richard's delayed return home, the war between England and France would ensue over the possession of English-controlled territories.\nConflict with England, Flanders and the Holy Roman Empire.\nConflict with Richard the Lionheart, 1191\u20131199.\nThe immediate cause of Philip's conflict with Richard the Lionheart stemmed from Richard's decision to break his betrothal with Philip's sister Alys at Messina in 1191. Some of Alys's dowry that had been given over to Richard during their engagement was part of the territory of Vexin. This should have reverted to Philip upon the end of the betrothal, but Philip, to prevent the collapse of the Crusade, agreed that this territory was to remain in Richard's hands and would be inherited by his male descendants. Should Richard die without an heir, the territory would return to Philip, and if Philip died without an heir, those lands would be considered a part of Normandy.\nReturning to France in late 1191, Philip began plotting to find a way to have those territories restored to him. He was in a difficult situation, as he had taken an oath not to attack Richard's lands while he was away on a crusade. The Third Crusade ordained territory under the protection of the Church in any event. Philip was unsuccessful in requesting a release from his oath from Pope Celestine III, so he was forced to build his own casus belli.\nOn 20 January 1192, Philip met William FitzRalph, Richard's seneschal for Normandy. Presenting some documents purporting to be from Richard, Philip claimed that the English king had agreed at Messina to hand disputed lands over to France. Not having heard anything directly from their sovereign, FitzRalph and the Norman barons rejected Philip's claim to Vexin. Philip at this time also began spreading rumours about Richard's action in the east to discredit the English king in the eyes of his subjects. Among the stories Philip invented included Richard being involved in treacherous communication with Saladin, alleging he had conspired to cause the fall of Gaza, Jaffa, and Ascalon, and that he had participated in the murder of Conrad of Montferrat. Finally, Philip made contact with John, Richard's brother, whom he convinced to join the conspiracy to overthrow the legitimate king of England.\nAt the start of 1193, John visited Philip in Paris, where he paid homage for Richard's continental lands. When word reached Philip that Richard had finished crusading and had been captured on his way back from the Holy Land, he promptly invaded Vexin. His first target was the fortress of Gisors, commanded by Gilbert de Vascoeuil, which surrendered without putting up a struggle. Philip then penetrated deep into Normandy, reaching as far as Dieppe. To keep the duplicitous John on his side, Philip entrusted him with the defence of the town of \u00c9vreux. Meanwhile, Philip was joined by Count Baldwin IX of Flanders, and together they laid siege to Rouen, the ducal capital of Normandy. Here, Philip's advance was halted by a defence led by the Earl of Leicester. Unable to penetrate this defence, Philip moved on.\nAt Mantes on 9 July 1193, Philip came to terms with Richard's ministers, who agreed that Philip could keep his gains and would be given some extra territories if he ceased all further aggressive actions in Normandy, along with the condition that Philip would hand back the captured territory if Richard would pay homage. To prevent Richard from spoiling their plans, Philip and John attempted to bribe Holy Roman Emperor Henry VI in order to keep the English king captive for a little while longer. Henry refused, and Richard was released from captivity on 4 February 1194. By 13 March Richard had returned to England, and by 12 May he had set sail for Normandy with some 300 ships, eager to engage Philip in war.\nPhilip had spent this time consolidating his territorial gains and by now controlled much of Normandy east of the Seine, while remaining within striking distance of Rouen. His next objective was the castle of Verneuil, which had withstood an earlier siege. Once Richard arrived at Barfleur, he soon marched towards Verneuil. As his forces neared the castle, Philip, who had been unable to break through, decided to strike camp. Leaving a large force behind to prosecute the siege, he moved off towards \u00c9vreux, which John had handed over to his brother to prove his loyalty. Philip retook the town and sacked it, but during this time, his forces at Verneuil abandoned the siege, and Richard entered the castle unopposed on 30 May. Throughout June, while Philip's campaign ground to a halt in the north, Richard was taking a number of important fortresses to the south. Philip, eager to relieve the pressure off his allies in the south, marched to confront Richard's forces at Vend\u00f4me. Refusing to risk everything in a major battle, Philip retreated, only to have his rear guard caught at Fr\u00e9teval on 3 July. This Battle of Fr\u00e9teval turned into a general encounter in which Philip barely managed to avoid capture as his army was put to flight. Fleeing back to Normandy, Philip avenged himself on the English by attacking the forces of John and the Earl of Arundel, seizing their baggage train. By now both sides were tiring, and they agreed to the temporary Truce of Tilli\u00e8res.\nThe war resumed in 1195 when Philip once again besieged Verneuil. He continued the siege in secret as Richard arrived to negotiate in person; when Richard found out, he swore revenge and left. Philip now pressed his advantage in northeastern Normandy, where he conducted a raid at Dieppe, burning the English ships in the harbor while repulsing an attack by Richard at the same time. Philip now marched southward into the Berry region. His primary objective was the fortress of Issoudun, which had just been captured by Richard's mercenary commander, Mercadier. The French king took the town and was besieging the castle when Richard stormed through French lines and made his way in to reinforce the garrison, while at the same time, another army was approaching Philip's supply lines. Philip called off his attack, and another truce was agreed; the Treaty of Louviers.\nThe war slowly turned against Philip over the course of the next three years. Political and military conditions seemed promising at the start of 1196 when Richard's nephew Arthur I, Duke of Brittany ended up in Philip's hands, and he won the Siege of Aumale despite an attempt from Richard to relieve it, but Philip's good fortune did not last. Richard won over a key ally, Baldwin of Flanders, in 1197. The same year, the Holy Roman Emperor Henry VI died and was succeeded by Otto IV, Richard's nephew, who put additional pressure on Philip. Finally, many Norman lords were switching sides and returning to Richard's camp. This was the state of affairs when Philip launched his campaign of 1198 with an attack on Vexin that was pushed back and then compounded by the Flemish invasion of Artois which diverted his attention elsewhere.\nOn 27 September, Richard entered Vexin, taking Courcelles-sur-Seine and Boury-en-Vexin before returning to Dangu. Philip, believing that Courcelles was still holding out, went to its relief. Discovering what was happening, Richard decided to attack the French king's forces, catching Philip by surprise. Philip's forces withdrew and attempted to reach the fortress of Gisors. Bunched together, the French knights with king Philip attempted to cross the Epte River on a bridge that promptly collapsed under their weight, almost drowning Philip in the process. He was dragged out of the river and shut himself up in Gisors, having successfully evaded Richard and reinforced the fortress.\nPhilip soon planned a new offensive, launching destructive raids into Normandy and again targeting \u00c9vreux which he captured and sacked. Richard countered Philip's thrust with a counterattack in Vexin, while Mercadier led a raid on Abbeville. By autumn 1198, Richard had regained almost all that had been lost in 1193. With the warring sides in a deadlock, Philip offered a truce so that discussions could begin towards a more permanent peace, with the offer that he would return all of the territories except for Gisors.\nIn mid-January 1199, the two kings met for a final meeting, Richard standing on the deck of a boat, and Philip standing on the banks of the Seine River. Shouting terms at each other, they could not reach an agreement on the terms of a permanent truce, but they did agree to further mediation, which resulted in a five-year truce that held. Later in 1199, Richard was killed during a siege involving one of his vassals.\nConflict with John of England, 1200\u20131206.\nIn May 1200, Philip signed the Treaty of Le Goulet with Richard's successor John. The treaty was meant to bring peace to Normandy by settling the issue of its much-reduced boundaries. The terms of John's vassalage were not only for Normandy, but also for Anjou, Maine, and Touraine. John agreed to heavy terms, including the abandonment of all the English possessions in Berry and 20,000 marks of silver, while Philip in turn recognized John as king of England, formally abandoning Arthur of Brittany's candidacy, whom he had hitherto supported, recognizing instead John's suzerainty over the Duchy of Brittany. To seal the treaty, a marriage between Blanche of Castile, John's niece, and Louis the Lion, Philip's son, was contracted.\nThis agreement did not bring warfare to an end in France, however, since John's mismanagement of Aquitaine led the province to rebel later in 1200, a disturbance that Philip secretly encouraged. To disguise his ambitions, Philip invited John to a conference at Andely and then entertained him at Paris, and both times he committed to complying with the treaty. In 1202, disaffected patrons petitioned the French king to summon John to answer their charges in his capacity as John's feudal lord in France. John refused to appear, so Philip again took up Arthur of Brittany's claims to the English throne as well as betrothing him to his six-year-old daughter Marie. In retaliation, John crossed over into Normandy and his forces soon captured Arthur, presumably as well as Arthur's sister Eleanor. In 1203, Arthur disappeared, with most people believing that John had had him murdered. The outcry over Arthur's fate saw an increase in local opposition to John, which Philip used to his advantage. He took to the offensive and, apart from a five-month siege of Andely, swept all before him. After Andely surrendered, John fled to England. By the end of 1204, most of Normandy and the Angevin lands, including much of Aquitaine, had fallen into Philip's hands. Philip requested John release Eleanor of Brittany, claiming that she was to be his daughter-in-law, but to no avail.\nWhat Philip had gained through victory in war, he sought to confirm by legal means. Philip, again acting as John's liege lord over his French lands, summoned him to appear before the Court of the Twelve Peers of France to answer for Arthur's murder. John requested safe conduct, but Philip only agreed to allow him to come in peace, while providing for his return only if it were allowed after the judgment of his peers. Not willing to risk his life on such a guarantee, John refused to appear, so Philip summarily dispossessed the English of all lands. Pushed by his barons, John eventually launched an invasion of northern France in 1206, disembarking with his army at La Rochelle during one of Philip's absences, but the campaign ended in disaster. After backing out of a conference that he himself had demanded, John eventually bargained at Thouars for a two-year truce, the price of which was his agreement to the chief provisions of the judgment of the Court of Peers, including a loss of his patrimony.\nAlliances against Philip, 1208\u20131213.\nIn 1208, Philip of Swabia, the successful candidate to become Holy Roman Emperor, was assassinated. As a result, the imperial crown was given to his rival Otto IV, the nephew of King John. Otto, prior to his accession, had promised to help John recover his lost possessions in France, but circumstances prevented him from making good on his promise. By 1212, both John and Otto were engaged in power struggles against Pope Innocent III: John over his refusal to accept the papal nomination for the archbishop of Canterbury, and Otto over his attempt to strip King Frederick II of Germany of the Kingdom of Sicily. Philip decided to take advantage of this situation, first in Germany, where he aided the German noble rebellion in support of the young Frederick. John immediately threw England's weight behind Otto, and Philip now saw his chance to launch a successful invasion of England.\nIn order to secure the cooperation of all his vassals in his plans for the invasion, Philip denounced John as an enemy of the Church, thereby justifying his attack as motivated solely by religious scruples. He summoned an assembly of French barons at Soissons, which was well attended. The only exception was Count Ferdinand of Flanders, who refused out of anger over the loss of the towns of Aire and Saint-Omer that had been captured by Philip's son Louis the Lion. He would not participate in any campaign until he was restored to his ancient lands.\nPhilip was eager to prove his loyalty to Rome and thus secure papal support for his planned invasion, announced at Soissons a reconciliation with his estranged wife Ingeborg of Denmark, which the popes had been promoting. The barons fully supported his plan, and they all gathered their forces and prepared to join with Philip at the agreed rendezvous. Through all of this, Philip remained in constant communication with Pandulf Verraccio, the papal legate, who was encouraging Philip to pursue his objective. Verraccio however was also holding secret discussions with King John. Advising the English king of his precarious predicament, he persuaded John to abandon his opposition to papal investiture and agreed to accept the papal legate's decision in any ecclesiastical disputes as final. In return, the pope agreed to accept the Kingdom of England and the Lordship of Ireland as papal fiefs, which John would rule as the pope's vassal, and for which John would do homage to the pope.\nNo sooner had the treaty between John and the pope been ratified in May 1213 than Verraccio announced to Philip that he would have to abandon his expedition against John, since to attack a faithful vassal of the Holy See would be a mortal sin. Philip argued in vain that his plans had been drawn up with the consent of Rome, that his expedition was in support of papal authority that he only undertook on the understanding that he would gain a plenary indulgence; he had spent a fortune preparing for the expedition. The papal legate remained unmoved, but Verraccio did suggest an alternative. The Count of Flanders had denied Philip's right to declare war on England while King John was still excommunicated, and that his disobedience needed to be punished. Philip eagerly accepted the advice, and quickly marched at the head of his troops into the territory of Flanders.\nBattle of Bouvines, 1214.\nThe French fleet proceeded first to Gravelines and then to the port of Damme. Meanwhile, the army marched by Cassel, Ypres, and Bruges before laying siege to Ghent. Hardly had the siege begun when Philip learnt that the English fleet had captured a number of his ships at Damme and that the rest were so closely blockaded in its harbour that it was impossible for them to escape. He ordered the fleet to be burned to prevent it from falling into enemy hands.\nThe destruction of the French fleet had once again raised John's hopes, so he began preparing for an invasion of France and a reconquest of his lost provinces. The English barons were initially unenthusiastic about the expedition, which delayed his departure, so it was not until February 1214 that he disembarked at La Rochelle. John was to advance from the Loire, while his ally Otto IV made a simultaneous attack from Flanders, together with the Count of Flanders. The three armies did not coordinate their efforts effectively. It was not until John had been disappointed in his hope for an easy victory after being driven from Roche-au-Moine and had retreated to his transports that the Imperial Army, with Otto at its head, assembled in the Low Countries.\nOn 27 July 1214, the opposing armies suddenly discovered that they were quite close to one another, on the banks of a little tributary of the River Lys, near the bridge at Bouvines (near Lille in southern Flanders). It being a Sunday, Philip did not expect the allied army to attack, as it was considered unholy to fight on the Sabbath. Philip's army numbered some 7,000, while the allied forces possessed around 9,000 troops. The armies clashed at what became known as the Battle of Bouvines. Philip was unhorsed by the Flemish pikemen in the heat of battle, and were it not for his mail armor he would have probably been killed. When Otto was carried off the field by his wounded and terrified horse, and the Count of Flanders was severely wounded and taken prisoner, the Flemish and Imperial troops saw that the battle was lost, turned, and fled the field. The French did not pursue as it was late in the day and nearly dark.\nPhilip returned to Paris triumphant, marching his captive prisoners behind him in a long procession, as his grateful subjects came out to greet the victorious king. In the aftermath of the battle, Otto retreated to his castle of Harzburg and was soon overthrown as Holy Roman Emperor, to be replaced by Frederick II. Count Ferdinand remained imprisoned following his defeat, while King John's attempt to rebuild the Angevin Empire ended in complete failure.\nPhilip's decisive victory was crucial in shaping Western European politics in both England and France. In England, the defeated John was so weakened that he was soon required to submit to the demands of his barons and sign Magna Carta, which limited the power of the crown and established the basis for common law. The Battle of Bouvines marked the end of the Angevin Empire.\nMarital problems.\nAfter the early death of Isabella of Hainault in childbirth in 1190, Philip decided to marry again. He decided on Ingeborg, daughter of King Valdemar I of Denmark, who received 10,000 marks of silver as a dowry. Philip met her at Amiens on 14 August 1193 and they were married that same day. At the feast of the Assumption of the Virgin, Archbishop Guillaume of Reims crowned both Philip and Ingeborg. During the ceremony, Philip was pale, nervous, and could not wait for the ceremony to end. Following the ceremony, he had Ingeborg sent to the convent of Saint-Maur-des-Fosses and asked Pope Celestine III for an annulment on the grounds of non-consummation. Philip had not reckoned with Ingeborg, however; she insisted that the marriage had been consummated, and that she was his wife and the rightful queen of France. The Franco-Danish churchman William of \u00c6belholt intervened on Ingeborg's side, drawing up a genealogy of the Danish kings to disprove the alleged impediment of consanguinity.\nIn the meantime, Philip had sought a new bride. Initial agreement had been reached for him to marry Margaret, daughter of Count William I of Geneva, but the young bride's journey to Paris was interrupted by Thomas, Count of Savoy, who kidnapped Philip's intended new wife and married her instead, claiming that Philip was already bound in marriage. Philip finally achieved a third marriage in June 1196, when he was married to Agnes of Merania from Dalmatia. Their children were Marie and Philip, Count of Clermont.\nPope Innocent III declared Philip Augustus' marriage to Agnes of Merania null and void, as he was still married to Ingeborg. He ordered the king to part from Agnes, and when he did not, the pope placed France under an interdict in 1199. This continued until 7 September 1200. Due to pressure from the pope, Ingeborg's brother King Valdemar II of Denmark and ultimately Agnes' death in 1201, Philip finally took Ingeborg back as his wife, but it would not be until 1213 that she would be recognized at court as queen.\nAppearance and personality.\nThe only known description of Philip describes him as \"a handsome, strapping fellow, with a cheerful face of ruddy complexion, and a temperament much inclined towards good-living, wine, and women. He was generous to his friends, stingy towards those who displeased him, well-versed in the art of stratagem, orthodox in belief, prudent and stubborn in his resolves. He made judgments with great speed and exactitude. Fortune's favourite, fearful for his life, easily excited and easily placated, he was very tough with powerful men who resisted him, and took pleasure in provoking discord among them. Never, however, did he cause an adversary to die in prison. He liked to employ humble men, to be the subduer of the proud, the defender of the Church, and feeder of the poor\".\nLater years.\nWhen Pope Innocent III called for a crusade against the \"Albigensians\", or Cathars, in Languedoc in 1208, Philip did nothing to support it, though he did not stop his nobles from joining in. The war against the Cathars did not end until 1244, when their last strongholds were finally captured. The fruits of the victory, the submission of the south of France to the crown, were to be reaped by Philip's son Louis VIII and grandson Louis IX. From 1216 to 1222, Philip also arbitrated in the War of the Succession of Champagne and finally helped the military efforts of Duke Odo III of Burgundy and Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II to bring it to an end.\nPhilip II Augustus played a significant role in one of the greatest centuries of innovation in construction and education in France. With Paris as his capital, he had the main thoroughfares paved, built a central market, Les Halles, continued the construction begun in 1163 of Notre-Dame de Paris, constructed the first incarnation of the Louvre as a fortress, and gave a charter to the University of Paris in 1200. Under his guidance, Paris became the first city of teachers the medieval world knew. In 1224, the French poet Henry d'Andeli wrote of the great wine-tasting competition that Philip II Augustus commissioned, the Battle of the Wines.\nPhilip II fell ill in September 1222 and had a will made, but carried on with his itinerary, but travelling in hot weather the next summer resulted in a fever. The king recovered and felt well enough to resume his restless activity of touring his kingdom. The partial return of his health prompted him to travel to Paris on 13 July 1223, against the advice of his physician. The journey proved too much for him and he died en route the next day, in Mantes-la-Jolie, at the age of 57. His body was carried to Paris on a bier. He was interred in the Basilica of St Denis in the presence of his son and successor, Louis VIII, as well as his illegitimate son Philip I, Count of Boulogne and John of Brienne, the King of Jerusalem.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
