The region of S\u00e1pmi was formerly known as Lapland. Historically, the S\u00e1mi have been known in English as Lapps or Laplanders. However, these terms are regarded as offensive by the S\u00e1mi, who prefer their own endonym, e.g. Northern S\u00e1mi . Their traditional languages are the S\u00e1mi languages, which are classified as a branch of the Uralic language family.\nTraditionally, the S\u00e1mi have pursued a variety of livelihoods, including coastal fishing, fur trapping, and sheep herding. Their best-known means of livelihood is semi-nomadic reindeer herding. As of 2007[ [update]] about 10% of the S\u00e1mi were connected to reindeer herding, which provides them with meat, fur, and transportation; around 2,800 S\u00e1mi people were actively involved in reindeer herding on a full-time basis in Norway. For traditional, environmental, cultural, and political reasons, reindeer herding is legally reserved for only S\u00e1mi in some regions of the Nordic countries.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nEtymologies.\nS\u00e1mi.\nSpeakers of Northern S\u00e1mi refer to themselves as (the S\u00e1mis) or (of S\u00e1mi kin), the word being inflected into various grammatical forms. Other S\u00e1mi languages use cognate words. As of around 2014, the current consensus among specialists was that the word \"S\u00e1mi\" was borrowed from the Proto-Baltic word , meaning 'land' (cognate with Slavic (), of the same meaning).\nThe word \"S\u00e1mi\" has at least one cognate word in Finnish: Proto-Baltic was also borrowed into Proto-Finnic, as . This word became modern Finnish (Finnish for the region of Tavastia; the second \"\u00e4\" of is still found in the adjective ). The Finnish word for Finland, , is also thought probably to derive ultimately from Proto-Baltic , though the precise route is debated and proposals usually involve complex processes of borrowing and reborrowing. and its adjectival form must come from '/'. In one proposal, this Finnish word comes from a Proto-Germanic word , itself from Proto-Baltic , in turn borrowed from Proto-Finnic , which was borrowed from .\nThe S\u00e1mi institutions\u2014notably the parliaments, radio and TV stations, theatres, etc.\u2014all use the term \"S\u00e1mi\", including when addressing outsiders in Norwegian, Swedish, Finnish, or English. In Norwegian and Swedish, the S\u00e1mi are today referred to by the localized form , plural .\n\"Finn\".\nThe first probable historical mention of the S\u00e1mi, naming them , was by Tacitus, about AD\u200998. Variants of \"Finn\" or were in wide use in ancient times, judging from the names and () in classical Roman and Greek works. \"Finn\" (or variants, such as , 'skiing Finn') was the name originally used by Norse speakers (and their proto-Norse speaking ancestors) to refer to the S\u00e1mi, as attested in the Icelandic Eddas and Norse sagas (11th to 14th centuries).\nThe etymology is somewhat uncertain, but the consensus seems to be that it is related to Old Norse , from proto-Germanic ('to find'), the logic being that the S\u00e1mi, as hunter-gatherers, \"found\" their food, rather than grew it. This etymology has superseded older speculations that the word might be related to \"fen\".\nAs Old Norse gradually developed into the separate Scandinavian languages, Swedes apparently took to using \"Finn\" to refer to inhabitants of what is now Finland, while the S\u00e1mi came to be called \"Lapps\". In Norway, however, S\u00e1mi were still called \"Finns\" at least until the modern era (reflected in toponyms like , , and ), and some northern Norwegians will still occasionally use \"Finn\" to refer to S\u00e1mi people, although the S\u00e1mi themselves now consider this to be an inappropriate term. Finnish immigrants to Northern Norway in the 18th and 19th centuries were referred to as Kvens to distinguish them from the S\u00e1mi \"Finns\". Ethnic Finns () are a group related to the S\u00e1mi, but distinct from them.\n\"Lapp\".\nThe word \"Lapp\" can be traced to Old Swedish , Icelandic (plural) perhaps of Finnish origin; compare Finnish \"Lapp\", \"Lapland\" (possibly meaning \"wilderness in the north\"), the original meaning being unknown. It is unknown how the word \"Lapp\" came into the Norse language, but one of the first written mentions of the term is in the by the twelfth-century Danish historian , who referred to 'the two Lappias', although he still referred to the S\u00e1mi as s. In fact, Saxo never explicitly connects the S\u00e1mi with the \"two Laplands\". The term \"Lapp\" was popularized and became the standard terminology by the work of , (1673).\nThe S\u00e1mi are often known in other languages by the exonyms \"Lap\", \"Lapp\", or \"Laplanders\", although these are considered derogatory terms by some, while others accept at least the name \"Lappland\". Variants of the name \"Lapp\" were originally used in Sweden and Finland and, through Swedish, adopted by many major European languages: ; German, ; ; (); ; ; ; ; ; ; . In Russian the corresponding term is () and in Ukrainian ().\nIn Finland and Sweden, \"Lapp\" is common in place names, such as (), (South Karelia) and (North Savo) in Finland; and (Stockholm County), () and () in Sweden. As already mentioned, \"Finn\" is a common element in Norwegian (particularly Northern Norwegian) place names, whereas \"Lapp\" is exceedingly rare.\nTerminological issues in Finnish are somewhat different. Finns living in Finnish Lapland generally call themselves , whereas the similar word for the S\u00e1mi people is . This can be confusing for foreign visitors because of the similar lives Finns and S\u00e1mi people live today in Lapland. is also a common family name in Finland. In Finnish, is the most commonly used word nowadays, especially in official contexts.\nHistory.\nThe western Uralic languages are believed to have spread from the original Proto-Uralic homeland along the Volga, which is the longest river in Europe. These groups presumably started to move to the northwest from the homeland of the early Uralic peoples in the second and third quarters of the 2nd millennium BC. On their journey, they used the ancient river routes of what is now northern Russia. Some of these peoples, who may have originally spoken the same western Uralic language, stopped and stayed in the regions between Karelia, Ladoga and Lake Ilmen, and even further to the east and to the southeast. The groups of these peoples that ended up in the Finnish Lakeland from 1600 to 1500 BC later \"became\" the S\u00e1mi. The S\u00e1mi people arrived in their current homeland some time during the Bronze Age or early Iron Age.\nThe S\u00e1mi language first developed on the southern side of Lake Onega and Lake Ladoga and spread from there. When the speakers of this language extended to the area of modern-day Finland, they encountered groups of peoples who spoke a number of smaller ancient languages (Paleo-Laplandic languages), which later became extinct. However, these languages left traces in the S\u00e1mi language (Pre-Finnic substrate). As the language spread further, it became segmented into dialects. The geographical distribution of the S\u00e1mi has evolved over the course of history. From the Bronze Age, the S\u00e1mi occupied the area along the coast of Finnmark and the Kola Peninsula. This coincides with the arrival of the Siberian genome to Estonia and Finland, which may correspond with the introduction of the Finno-Ugric languages in the region.\nPetroglyphs and archeological findings such as settlements, dating from about 10,000\u00a0BC can be found in Lapland and Finnmark, although these have not been demonstrated to be related to the S\u00e1mi people. These hunter-gatherers of the late Paleolithic and early Mesolithic were named Komsa by the researchers.\nRelationship between the S\u00e1mi and the Scandinavians.\nThe S\u00e1mi have a complex relationship with the Scandinavians (known as Norse people in the medieval era), the dominant peoples of Scandinavia, who speak Scandinavian languages and who founded and thus dominated the kingdoms of Norway and Sweden. The migration of Germanic-speaking peoples to Southern Scandinavia happened independently and separately from the S\u00e1mi migrations into the northern regions. For centuries, the S\u00e1mi and the Scandinavians had relatively little contact; the S\u00e1mi primarily lived in the inland of northern Fennoscandia, while Scandinavians lived in southern Scandinavia and gradually colonised the Norwegian coast; from the 18th and especially the 19th century, the governments of Norway and Sweden started to assert sovereignty more aggressively in the north, and targeted the S\u00e1mi with Scandinavization policies aimed at forced assimilation from the 19th century.\nBefore the era of forced Scandinavization policies, the Norwegian and Swedish authorities had largely ignored the S\u00e1mi and did not interfere much in their way of life. While Norwegians moved north to gradually colonise the coast of modern-day Troms and Finnmark to engage in an export-driven fisheries industry prior to the 19th century, they showed little interest in the harsh and non-arable inland populated by reindeer-herding S\u00e1mi. Unlike the Norwegians on the coast who were strongly dependent on their trade with the south, the S\u00e1mi in the inland lived off the land. From the 19th century Norwegian and Swedish authorities started to regard the S\u00e1mi as a \"backward\" and \"primitive\" people in need of being \"civilized\", imposing the Scandinavian languages as the only valid languages of the kingdoms and effectively banning S\u00e1mi language and culture in many contexts, particularly schools.\nSouthern limits of S\u00e1mi settlement in the past.\nHow far south the S\u00e1mi extended in the past has been debated among historians and archeologists for many years. The Norwegian historian Yngvar Nielsen, commissioned by the Norwegian government in 1889 to determine this question in order to settle contemporary questions of S\u00e1mi land rights, concluded that the S\u00e1mi had lived no farther south than Lierne Municipality in Tr\u00f8ndelag county until around 1500, when they started moving south, reaching the area around Lake Femund in the 18th century. This hypothesis is still accepted among many historians, but has been the subject of scholarly debate in the 21st century. In recent years, several archaeological finds indicate a S\u00e1mi presence in southern Norway in the Middle Ages, and in southern Sweden, including finds in Lesja Municipality, in Vang Municipality, in Valdres and in Hol Municipality and \u00c5l Municipality in Hallingdal. Proponents of the S\u00e1mi interpretations of these finds assume a mixed population of Norse and S\u00e1mi people in the mountainous areas of southern Norway in the Middle Ages.\nIn Finland, a 2022 study said that S\u00e1mi habitation was found in the entirety of continental Finland at least until the 14th century. Toponyms of S\u00e1mi origin are common in the southernmost provinces of Finland Proper and Uusimaa. Etymologies based on S\u00e1mi names have been suggested for Aurajoki and Nuuksio. The S\u00e1mi coexisted with Finns and Swedes and traded squirrel furs with them. The division was based on occupation: unlike Finns and Swedes, the S\u00e1mi did not engage in significant agriculture, relying on fishing, hunting, gathering and fur trapping instead. Complete colonization of the two provinces by Finns and Swedes led to the assimilation and disappearance of a distinct S\u00e1mi population by the 14th century.\nOrigins of the Norwegian Sea S\u00e1mi.\nBubonic plague.\nUntil the arrival of bubonic plague in northern Norway in 1349, the S\u00e1mi and the Norwegians occupied very separate economic niches. The S\u00e1mi hunted reindeer and fished for their livelihood. The Norwegians, who were concentrated on the outer islands and near the mouths of the fjords, had access to the major European trade routes so that, in addition to marginal farming in the Nordland, Troms, and Finnmark counties, they were able to establish commerce, trading fish for products from the south. According to old Nordic texts, the Sea S\u00e1mi and the Mountain S\u00e1mi are two classes of the same people and not two different ethnic groups, as had been erroneously believed.\nThis socioeconomic balance greatly changed when bubonic plague came to northern Norway in December 1349. The Norwegians were closely connected to the greater European trade routes, along which the plague traveled; consequently, they were infected and died at a far higher rate than S\u00e1mi in the interior. Of all the states in the region, Norway suffered the most from this plague. Depending on the parish, 60 to 76 percent of northern Norwegian farms were abandoned following the plague, while land-rents, another measure of population, dropped to 9\u201328% of pre-plague levels. Although the population of northern Norway is sparse compared to southern Europe, the disease spread just as fast. The spread of the plague-carrying flea (\"Xenopsylla cheopsis\") from the south was facilitated by the transport of wooden barrels holding wheat, rye, or wool, where the fleas were able to live, and even reproduce, for several months at a time. The S\u00e1mi lived on fish and reindeer meat, and did not eat wheat or rye. They lived in communities detached from the Norwegians; being only loosely connected to the European trade routes, they fared far better than the Norwegians.\nIndigenous fishing practices.\nTraditionally fishing for the S\u00e1mi was done locally on a small scale. Who could fish depended on the fisher's locality to the sea and their knowledge of the landscape. Fishermen would use common fishing grounds and would have their own personal and secret spots. To navigate to these spots, they did so by naming the spot topographically, relating to costal landmarks and the landscape of the seafloor. Fishermen were able to catch through a knowledge of the local coastal terrain, the landscape of the sea floor, and their ability to predict the tides and fish based on the season. Such knowledge was learned generationally:\"To make a living from fishing in the fjord, you are quite dependent on the knowledge passed on from the earlier generations about what species of fish can be exploited here, tidal currents, fishing spots, how to place nets and so on. This is often a matter of accurate calculation. In periods with a short supply of fish, this kind of knowledge becomes even more important. The young are not interested in learning these things, they depend on the sonar technology, but they don't last very long as fishermen.\"The indigenous knowledge became less used due to colonialism, the replacing of indigenous place names, and the development of modern fishing techniques.\nFishing industry.\nFishing has always been the main livelihood for the many S\u00e1mi living permanently in coastal areas. Archaeological research shows that the S\u00e1mi have lived along the coast and once lived much farther south in the past, and they were also involved in work other than reindeer herding (e.g., fishing, agriculture, iron work). The fishing along the north Norwegian coast, especially in the Lofoten and Vester\u00e5len islands, is quite productive, with a variety of fish; during medieval times, it was a major source of income for both the fishermen and the Norwegian monarchy. With such massive population drops caused by the Black Death, the tax revenues from this industry greatly diminished. Because of the huge profits that could be had from these fisheries, the local authorities offered incentives to the S\u00e1mi\u2014faced with their own population pressures\u2014to settle on the newly vacant farms. This started the economic division between the Sea S\u00e1mi (), who fished extensively off the coast, and the Mountain S\u00e1mi (), who continued to hunt reindeer and small-game animals. They later herded reindeer.\nEven as late as the early 18th century, there were many S\u00e1mi who were still settling on these farms left abandoned from the 1350s. After many years of continuous migration, these Sea S\u00e1mi became far more numerous than the reindeer-herding mountain S\u00e1mi, who today only make up 10% of all S\u00e1mi. In contemporary times, there are also ongoing consultations between the Government of Norway and the S\u00e1mi Parliament regarding the right of the coastal S\u00e1mi to fish in the seas on the basis of historical use and international law. State regulation of sea fisheries underwent drastic change in the late 1980s. The regulation linked quotas to vessels and not to fishers. These newly calculated quotas were distributed free of charge to larger vessels on the basis of the amount of the catch in previous years, resulting in small vessels in S\u00e1mi districts falling outside the new quota system to a large degree.\nMountain S\u00e1mi.\nAs the Sea S\u00e1mi settled along Norway's fjords and inland waterways, pursuing a combination of farming, cattle raising, trapping and fishing, the minority Mountain S\u00e1mi continued to hunt wild reindeer. Around 1500, they started to tame these animals into herding groups, becoming the well-known reindeer nomads, often portrayed by outsiders as following the traditional S\u00e1mi lifestyle. The Mountain S\u00e1mi had to pay taxes to three states, Norway, Sweden and Russia, as they crossed each border while following the annual reindeer migrations; this caused much resentment over the years. Between 1635 and 1659, the Swedish crown forced Swedish conscripts and S\u00e1mi cart drivers to work in the Nasa silver mine, causing many S\u00e1mis to emigrate from the area to avoid forced labour. As a result, the population of Pite- and Lule-speaking S\u00e1mi decreased greatly.\nPost-1800s.\nFor long periods of time, the S\u00e1mi lifestyle thrived because of its adaptation to the Arctic environment. Indeed, throughout the 18th century, as Norwegians of Northern Norway suffered from low fish prices and consequent depopulation, the S\u00e1mi cultural element was strengthened, since the S\u00e1mi were mostly independent of supplies from Southern Norway.\nDuring the 19th century, the pressure of Christianization of the S\u00e1mi increased, with some S\u00e1mi adopting Laestadianism. With the introduction of seven compulsory years of school in 1889, the S\u00e1mi language and traditional way of life came increasingly under pressure from forced cultural normalization. Strong economic development of the north also ensued, giving Norwegian culture and language higher status.\nOn the Swedish and Finnish sides, the authorities were less militant, although the S\u00e1mi language was forbidden in schools and strong economic development in the north led to weakened cultural and economic status for the S\u00e1mi. From 1913 to 1920, the Swedish race-segregation political movement created a race-based biological institute that collected research material from living people and graves. Throughout history, Swedish settlers were encouraged to move to the northern regions through incentives such as land and water rights, tax allowances, and military exemptions.\nThe strongest pressure took place from around 1900 to 1940, when Norway invested considerable money and effort to assimilate S\u00e1mi culture. Anyone who wanted to buy or lease state lands for agriculture in Finnmark had to prove knowledge of the Norwegian language and had to register with a Norwegian name. This partly caused the dislocation of S\u00e1mi people in the 1920s, which increased the gap between local S\u00e1mi groups (something still present today) that sometimes has the character of an internal S\u00e1mi ethnic conflict. Another example of forced displacement occurred between 1919 and 1920 in Norway and Sweden. This has been the topic of a recent work of journalism by S\u00e1mi author Elin Anna Labba, translated into English in 2023 under the title \"The Rocks Will Echo Our Sorrow: The Forced Displacement of the Northern S\u00e1mi\".\nIn 1913, the Norwegian parliament passed a bill on \"native act land\" to allocate the best and most useful lands to Norwegian settlers. Another factor was the scorched earth policy conducted by the German army, resulting in heavy war destruction in northern Finland and northern Norway in 1944\u201345, destroying all existing houses, or \"kota\", and visible traces of S\u00e1mi culture. After World War II, the pressure was relaxed, though the legacy was evident into recent times, such as the 1970s law limiting the size of any house S\u00e1mi people were allowed to build.\nThe controversy over the construction of the hydro-electric power station in Alta Municipality in 1979 brought S\u00e1mi rights onto the political agenda. In August 1986, the national anthem (\"S\u00e1mi soga l\u00e1vlla\") and flag (S\u00e1mi flag) of the S\u00e1mi people were created. In 1989, the first S\u00e1mi parliament in Norway was elected. In 2005, the Finnmark Act was passed in the Norwegian parliament giving the S\u00e1mi parliament and the Finnmark Provincial council a joint responsibility of administering the land areas previously considered state property. These areas (96% of the provincial area), which have always been used primarily by the S\u00e1mi, now belong officially to the people of the province, whether S\u00e1mi or Norwegian, and not to the Norwegian state.\nContemporary issues.\nThe Indigenous S\u00e1mi population is a mostly urbanised demographic, but a substantial number live in villages in the high Arctic. The S\u00e1mi are still coping with the cultural consequences of language and culture loss caused by generations of S\u00e1mi children being taken to missionary or state-run boarding schools and the legacy of laws that were created to deny the S\u00e1mi rights (e.g., to their beliefs, language, land and to the practice of traditional livelihoods). The S\u00e1mi are experiencing cultural and environmental threats, including: oil exploration, mining, dam building, logging, climate change, military bombing ranges, tourism and commercial development.\nNatural resource extraction.\nS\u00e1pmi is rich in precious metals, oil, and natural gas. Mining activities and prospecting to extract these resources from the region often interfere with reindeer grazing and calving areas and other aspects of traditional S\u00e1mi life. Some active mining locations include ancient S\u00e1mi spaces that are designated as ecologically protected areas, such as the Vindelfj\u00e4llen Nature Reserve. The S\u00e1mi Parliament has opposed and rejected mining projects in the Finnmark area, and demanded that resources and mineral exploration benefit local S\u00e1mi communities and populations, as the proposed mines are in S\u00e1mi lands and will affect their ability to maintain their traditional livelihood. In Kallak (S\u00e1mi: \"G\u00e1llok\") a group of Indigenous and non-Indigenous activists protested against the UK-based mining company Beowulf which operated a drilling program in lands used for grazing reindeer during the winter. There is often local opposition to new mining projects where environmental impacts are perceived to be very large, as very few plans for mine reclamation have been made. In Sweden, taxes on minerals are intentionally low in an effort to increase mineral exploration for economic benefit, though this policy is at the expense of S\u00e1mi populations. ILO Convention No. 169 would grant rights to the S\u00e1mi people to their land and give them power in matters that affect their future.\nIn Russia's Kola Peninsula, vast areas have already been destroyed by mining and smelting activities, and further development is imminent. This includes oil and natural gas exploration in the Barents Sea. Oil spills affect fishing and the construction of roads. There is a gas pipeline that stretches across the Kola Peninsula, and power lines cut off access to reindeer calving grounds and sacred sites.\nIn northern Finland, there has been a longstanding dispute over the destruction of forests, which prevents reindeer from migrating between seasonal feeding grounds and destroys supplies of lichen that grow on the upper branches of older trees. This lichen is the reindeer's only source of sustenance during the winter months, when snow is deep. The logging has been under the control of the state-run forest system. Greenpeace, reindeer herders, and S\u00e1mi organisations carried out a historic joint campaign, and in 2010, S\u00e1mi reindeer herders won some time as a result of these court cases. Industrial logging has now been pushed back from the most important forest areas either permanently or for the next 20 years, though there are still threats, such as mining and construction plans of holiday resorts on the protected shorelines of Lake Inari.\nLand rights.\nThe Swedish government has allowed the world's largest onshore wind farm to be built in Pite\u00e5, in the Arctic region where the Eastern Kikkejaure village has its winter reindeer pastures. The wind farm will consist of more than 1,000 wind turbines and an extensive road infrastructure, which means that the feasibility of using the area for winter grazing in practice is impossible. Sweden has received strong international criticism, including by the UN Racial Discrimination Committee and the Human Rights Committee, that Sweden violates S\u00e1mi \"landr\u00e4ttigheter\" (land rights), including by not regulating industry. In Norway some S\u00e1mi politicians (for example\u2014Aili Keskitalo) suggest giving the S\u00e1mi Parliament a special veto right on planned mining projects.\nGovernment authorities and NATO have built bombing-practice ranges in S\u00e1mi areas in northern Norway and Sweden. These regions have served as reindeer calving and summer grounds for thousands of years, and contain many ancient S\u00e1mi sacred sites.\nIn October 2024, the United Nations Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights ruled Finland had violated S\u00e1mi Indigenous people's rights to their land and culture. The decision responded to a petition filed by 17 members of the S\u00e1mi community regarding encroachment on their traditional territories for prospective mining activities. The UNCESCR relied on the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights in recognizing \"Indigenous Peoples' right to land as an indispensable part of their right to take part in cultural life.\" The committee concluded Finland failed to properly consult the S\u00e1mi community, and directed the country to provide complainants with reparations as well as modify legislation regarding environmental, social, and cultural impact assessments. The decision was significant, as it marked the first time European Indigenous peoples were able to defend their land rights without relying on conventional property definitions, instead using concepts like cultural rights and living standards.\nWater rights.\nState regulation of sea fisheries underwent drastic change in the late 1980s. The regulation linked quotas to vessels and not to fishers. These newly calculated quotas were distributed free of cost to larger vessels on the basis of the amount of the catch in previous years, resulting in small vessels in S\u00e1mi districts falling outside the new quota system to a large degree.\nThe S\u00e1mi recently stopped a water-prospecting venture that threatened to turn an ancient sacred site and natural spring called Suttesaja into a large-scale water-bottling plant for the world market\u2014without notification or consultation with the local S\u00e1mi people, who make up 70 percent of the population. The Finnish National Board of Antiquities has registered the area as a heritage site of cultural and historical significance, and the stream itself is part of the Deatnu/Tana watershed, which is home to Europe's largest salmon river, an important source of S\u00e1mi livelihood.\nIn Norway, government plans for the construction of a hydroelectric power plant in the Alta river in Finnmark in northern Norway led to a political controversy and the rallying of the S\u00e1mi popular movement in the late 1970s and early 1980s. As a result, the opposition in the Alta controversy brought attention to not only environmental issues but also the issue of S\u00e1mi rights.\nClimate change and the environment.\nReindeer have major cultural and economic significance for Indigenous peoples of the North. The human-ecological systems in the North, like reindeer pastoralism, are sensitive to change, perhaps more than in virtually any other region of the globe, due in part to the variability of the Arctic climate and ecosystem and the characteristic ways of life of Indigenous Arctic peoples.\nThe 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster caused nuclear fallout in the sensitive Arctic ecosystems and poisoned fish, meat and berries. Lichens and mosses are two of the main forms of vegetation in the Arctic and are highly susceptible to airborne pollutants and heavy metals. Since many do not have roots, they absorb nutrients, and toxic compounds, through their leaves. The lichens accumulated airborne radiation, and 73,000 reindeer had to be killed as \"unfit\" for human consumption in Sweden alone. The government promised S\u00e1mi indemnification but has not followed through on this promise.\nRadioactive wastes and spent nuclear fuel have been stored in the waters off the Kola Peninsula, including locations that are only \"two kilometers\" from places where S\u00e1mi live. There are a minimum of five \"dumps\" where spent nuclear fuel and other radioactive waste are being deposited in the Kola Peninsula, often with little concern for the surrounding environment or population.\nTourism.\nThe tourism industry in Finland has been criticized for turning S\u00e1mi culture into a marketing tool by promoting opportunities to experience \"authentic\" S\u00e1mi ceremonies and lifestyle. At many tourist locales, non-S\u00e1mi dress in inaccurate replicas of S\u00e1mi traditional clothing, and gift shops sell crude reproductions of S\u00e1mi handicraft. One popular \"ceremony\", crossing the Arctic Circle, actually has no significance in S\u00e1mi spirituality. To some S\u00e1mi, this is an insulting display of cultural exploitation.\nRepatriation of objects and human remains to Lapland.\nSince the late 1990s, the S\u00e1mi have occasionally obtained the repatriation of ceremonial or handicraft objects. These had been collected in the 19th century by the Swedes for \"scientific\" reasons and preserved in museums. Similarly, considered valuable for research in racial biology, many S\u00e1mi human remains had been unearthed at the request of universities. At the time, S\u00e1mi were considered inferior to \"the Nordic race\".\nIn 1997, after several refusals, the skulls of the two decapitated leaders of a S\u00e1mi uprising in 1852 were officially reburied. Other small-scale repatriations \u2013 two or three skulls at a time \u2013 followed. In 2019, on the occasion of the International Day of the World's Indigenous Peoples, 25 skulls were reburied in the Swedish municipality of Lycksele.\nIn May 2025, two new skulls were repatriated to the Gammelstad cemetery in Swedish Lapland.\nDiscrimination against the S\u00e1mi.\nThe S\u00e1mi have for centuries, even today, been the subject of discrimination and abuse by the dominant cultures in the nations they have historically inhabited. They have never been a single community in a single region of S\u00e1pmi, which until recently was considered only a cultural region.\nNorway has been criticized internationally for the politics of Norwegianization of and discrimination against the S\u00e1mi. On 8 April 2011, recommendations from the UN Racial Discrimination Committee were delivered to Norway, addressing many issues related to the legacy of Norwegianization policies, including the need for more S\u00e1mi language education, interpreters, and cultural support. One committee recommendation was that discrimination against someone based upon their language be added to Article\u00a01 of the Norwegian Discrimination and Accessibility Act. A new present status report was to have been ready by the end of 2012. In 2018, The Storting commissioned The Truth and Reconciliation Commission to lay the foundation for recognition of the experiences of the S\u00e1mi subject to Norwegianization and the subsequent consequences.\nSweden has faced similar criticism for its Swedification policies, which began in the 1800s and lasted until the 1970s. In 2020, Sweden funded the establishment of an independent truth commission to examine and document past abuse of S\u00e1mi by the Swedish state. In 2021, the Church of Sweden made a formal apology to Sweden's S\u00e1mi population for its role in forced conversions and Swedification efforts, outlining a multiyear reconciliation plan.\nIn Finland, where S\u00e1mi children, like all Finnish children, are entitled to day care and language instruction in their own language, the Finnish government has denied funding for these rights in most of the country, including in Rovaniemi, the largest municipality in Finnish Lapland. S\u00e1mi activists have pushed for nationwide application of these basic rights. The city of Rovaniemi offers day care and preschool education in the S\u00e1mi language, and then as basic education first as supplementary native language education starting from the first grade and as a voluntary subject on its own starting from the fourth grade.\nAs in the other countries claiming sovereignty over S\u00e1mi lands, S\u00e1mi activists' efforts in Finland in the 20th century achieved limited government recognition of the S\u00e1mis' rights as a recognized minority, but the Finnish government has maintained its legally enforced premise that the S\u00e1mi must prove their land ownership, an idea incompatible with and antithetical to the traditional reindeer-herding S\u00e1mi way of life. This has effectively allowed the Finnish government to take without compensation, motivated by economic gain, land occupied by the S\u00e1mi for centuries. Non-S\u00e1mi Finns began to move to Lapland in the 1550s.\nGovernment.\nOfficial S\u00e1mi policies.\nNorway.\nThe S\u00e1mi have been recognized as an Indigenous people in Norway (1990 according to ILO convention 169 as described below), and therefore, according to international law, the S\u00e1mi people in Norway are entitled special protection and rights. The legal foundation of the S\u00e1mi policy is:\nThe constitutional amendment states: \"It is the responsibility of the authorities of the State to create conditions enabling the S\u00e1mi people to preserve and develop its language, culture and way of life.\" This provides a legal and political protection of the S\u00e1mi language, culture and society. In addition the \"amendment implies a legal, political and moral obligation for Norwegian authorities to create an environment conducive to the S\u00e1mis themselves influencing on the development of the S\u00e1mi community\".\nThe S\u00e1mi Act provides special rights for the S\u00e1mi people:\nThe Norwegian S\u00e1mi Parliament also elects 50% of the members to the board of the Finnmark Estate, which controls 95% of the land in the county of Finnmark.\nIn addition, the S\u00e1mi have special rights to reindeer husbandry. In 2007, the Norwegian Parliament passed the new Reindeer Herding Act acknowledging siida as the basic institution regarding land rights, organization, and daily herding management.\nNorway has also accepted international conventions, declarations and agreements applicable to the S\u00e1mi as a minority and Indigenous people including:\nSweden.\nSweden recognised the existence of the \"S\u00e1mi nation\" in 1989, but the ILO Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention, C169 has not been adopted. The Sametingslag was established as the Swedish S\u00e1mi Parliament on 1 January 1993. In 1998, Sweden formally apologized for the wrongs committed against the S\u00e1mi.\nS\u00e1mi is one of five national minority languages recognized by Swedish law. The Compulsory School Ordinance states that S\u00e1mi pupils are entitled to be taught in their native language; however, a municipality is only obliged to arrange mother-tongue teaching in S\u00e1mi if a suitable teacher is available and the pupil has a basic knowledge of S\u00e1mi.\nIn 2010, after 15 years of negotiation, Laponiatjuottjudus, an association with S\u00e1mi majority control, were handed control over the UNESCO World Heritage Site Laponia. The reindeer-herding law will apply in the area as well.\nFinland.\nThe act establishing the Finnish S\u00e1mi Parliament (Finnish: Saamelaisk\u00e4r\u00e4j\u00e4t) was passed on 9 November 1973. S\u00e1mi people have had very little representation in Finnish national politics. In fact, in 2007, Janne Seuruj\u00e4rvi, a Finnish Centre Party representative, became the first S\u00e1mi ever to be elected to the Finnish Parliament.\nFinland ratified the 1966 UN Covenant on Civil and Political Rights though several cases have been brought before the UN Human Rights Committee. Of those, 36 cases involved a determination of the rights of individual S\u00e1mi in Finland and Sweden. The committee decisions clarify that S\u00e1mi are members of a minority within the meaning of Article 27 and that deprivation or erosion of their rights to practice traditional activities that are an essential element of their culture do come within the scope of Article 27. Finland recognized the S\u00e1mi as a \"people\" in 1995, but has yet to ratify ILO Convention 169 Concerning Indigenous and Tribal Peoples.\nS\u00e1mi in Finland have had access to S\u00e1mi language instruction in some schools since the 1970s, and language rights were established in 1992. There are three S\u00e1mi languages spoken in Finland: North S\u00e1mi, Skolt S\u00e1mi and Inari S\u00e1mi. Of these languages, Inari S\u00e1mi, which is spoken by about 350 speakers, is the only one that is used entirely within the borders of Finland, mainly in the municipality of Inari.\nThe case of J. Lansman versus Finland concerned a challenge by S\u00e1mi reindeer herders in northern Finland to the Finnish Central Forestry Board's plans to approve logging and construction of roads in an area used by the herdsmen as winter pasture and spring calving grounds. Finland has denied any aboriginal rights or land rights to the S\u00e1mi people; in Finland, non-S\u00e1mi can herd reindeer.\nRussia.\nThe 1822 Statute of Administration of Non-Russians in Siberia asserted state ownership over all the land in Siberia and then \"granted\" possessory rights to the natives. Governance of Indigenous groups, and especially collection of taxes from them, necessitated protection of Indigenous peoples against exploitation by traders and settlers. During the Soviet era, the inhabitants of the Kola tundra were forcibly relocated to kolkhozes (collective communities) by the state; most S\u00e1mi were settled at Luj\u00e1vri (Lovozero).\nThe 1993 Constitution, Article 69 states, \"The Russian Federation guarantees the rights of small indigenous peoples in accordance with the generally accepted principles and standards of international law and international treaties of the Russian Federation.\" For the first time in Russia, the rights of Indigenous minorities were established in the 1993 Constitution.\nThe Russian Federation ratified the 1966 UN Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; Section\u00a02 explicitly forbids depriving a people of \"its own means of subsistence\". The Russian Duma has adopted partial measures to implement it. The Russian Federation lists distinct Indigenous peoples as having special rights and protections under the Constitution and federal laws and decrees. These rights are linked to the category known since Soviet times as the (\"small-numbered peoples\"), a term that is often translated as \"Indigenous minorities\", which include Arctic peoples such as the S\u00e1mi, Nenets, Evenki, and Chukchi.\nIn April 1999, the Russian Duma passed a law that guarantees socioeconomic and cultural development to all Indigenous minorities, protecting traditional living places and acknowledging some form of limited ownership of territories that have traditionally been used for hunting, herding, fishing, and gathering activities. The law, however, does not anticipate the transfer of title in fee simply to Indigenous minorities. The law does not recognize development rights, some proprietary rights including compensation for damage to the property, and limited exclusionary rights. It is not clear, however, whether protection of nature in the traditional places of inhabitation implies a right to exclude conflicting uses that are destructive to nature or whether they have the right to veto development.\nThe Russian Federation's Land Code reinforces the rights of numerically small peoples (\"Indigenous minorities\") to use places they inhabit and to continue traditional economic activities without being charged rent. Such lands cannot be allocated for unrelated activities (which might include oil, gas, and mineral development or tourism) without the consent of the Indigenous peoples. Furthermore, Indigenous minorities and ethnic groups are allowed to use environmentally protected lands and lands set aside as nature preserves to engage in their traditional modes of land use.\nRegional law, Code of the Murmansk Oblast, calls on the organs of state power of the oblast to facilitate the native peoples of the Kola North, specifically naming the S\u00e1mi, \"in realization of their rights for preservation and development of their native language, national culture, traditions and customs.\" The third section of Article 21 states: \"In historically established areas of habitation, S\u00e1mi enjoy the rights for traditional use of nature and [traditional] activities.\"\nThroughout the Russian North, Indigenous and local people have difficulties with exercising control over resources upon which they and their ancestors have depended for centuries. The failure to protect Indigenous ways, however, stems not from inadequacy of the written law, but rather from the failure to implement existing laws. Violations of the rights of Indigenous peoples continue, and oil, gas, and mineral development and other activities, (mining, timber cutting, commercial fishing, and tourism) that bring foreign currency into the Russian economy. The life ways and economy of Indigenous peoples of the Russian North are based upon reindeer herding, fishing, terrestrial and sea mammal hunting, and trapping. Many groups in the Russian Arctic are semi-nomadic, moving seasonally to different hunting and fishing camps. These groups depend upon different types of environment at differing times of the year, rather than upon exploiting a single commodity to exhaustion. Throughout northwestern Siberia, oil and gas development has disturbed pastureland and undermined the ability of Indigenous peoples to continue hunting, fishing, trapping, and herding activities. Roads constructed in connection with oil and gas exploration and development destroy and degrade pastureland, ancestral burial grounds, and sacred sites and increase hunting by oil workers on the territory used by Indigenous peoples.\nIn the S\u00e1mi homeland on the Kola Peninsula in northwestern Russia, regional authorities closed a fifty-mile (eighty-kilometer) stretch of the Ponoi River (and other rivers) to local fishing and granted exclusive fishing rights to a commercial company offering catch-and-release fishing to sport fishers largely from abroad. This deprived the local S\u00e1mi (see Article 21 of the Code of the Murmansk Oblast) of food for their families and community and of their traditional economic livelihood. Thus, closing the fishery to locals may have violated the test articulated by the U.N. Human Rights Committee and disregarded the Land Code, other legislative acts, and the 1992 Presidential decree. S\u00e1mi are not only forbidden to fish in the eighty-kilometer stretch leased to the Ponoi River Company but are also required by regional laws to pay for licenses to catch a limited number of fish outside the lease area. Residents of remote communities have neither the power nor the resources to demand enforcement of their rights. Here and elsewhere in the circumpolar north, the failure to apply laws for the protection of Indigenous peoples leads to \"criminalization\" of local Indigenous populations who cannot survive without \"poaching\" resources that should be accessible to them legally.\nAlthough Indigenous leaders in Russia have occasionally asserted Indigenous rights to land and resources, to date there has been no serious or sustained discussion of Indigenous group rights to ownership of land. Russia has not adopted the ILO Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention, C169.\nNordic S\u00e1mi Convention.\nOn 16 November 2005 in Helsinki, a group of experts, led by former Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Norway Professor Carsten Smith, submitted a proposal for a Nordic S\u00e1mi Convention to the annual joint meeting of the ministers responsible for S\u00e1mi affairs in Finland, Norway and Sweden and the presidents of the three S\u00e1mi Parliaments from the respective countries. This convention recognizes the S\u00e1mi as one Indigenous people residing across national borders in all three countries. A set of minimum standards is proposed for the rights of developing the S\u00e1mi language and culture and rights to land and water, livelihoods and society. The convention has not yet been ratified in the Nordic countries.\nOrganization.\nS\u00e1pmi demonstrates a distinct semi-national identity that transcends the borders between Norway, Sweden, Finland and Russia. There is no movement for a sovereign state, but they do seek greater autonomy in their respective nation states.\nS\u00e1mi Parliaments.\nThe S\u00e1mi Parliaments (\"S\u00e1mediggi\" in Northern S\u00e1mi, \"S\u00e4mitigge\" in Inari S\u00e1mi, \"S\u00e4\u00e4'mte'\u01e7\u01e7\" in Skolt S\u00e1mi) founded in Finland (1973), Norway (1989) and Sweden (1993) are the representative bodies for peoples of S\u00e1mi heritage. Russia has not recognized the S\u00e1mi as a minority and, as a result, recognizes no S\u00e1mi parliament, even if the S\u00e1mi people there have formed an unrecognised S\u00e1mi Parliament of Russia. There is no single, unified S\u00e1mi parliament that spans across the Nordic countries. Rather, each of the aforementioned three countries has set up its own separate legislatures for S\u00e1mi people, even though the three S\u00e1mi Parliaments often work together on cross-border issues. In all three countries, they act as an institution of cultural autonomy for the Indigenous S\u00e1mi people. The parliaments have very weak political influence, far from autonomy. They are formally public authorities, ruled by the Scandinavian governments, but have democratically elected parliamentarians whose mission is to work for the S\u00e1mi people and culture. Candidates' election promises often conflict with the institutions' submission to their governments, but as authorities, they do have some influence over the government.\nNorwegian organizations.\nThe main organisations for S\u00e1mi representation in Norway are the \"siidas\". They cover northern and central Norway.\nSwedish organizations.\nThe main organisations for S\u00e1mi representation in Sweden are the \"siidas\". They cover northern and central Sweden.\nFinnish organizations.\nIn contrast to Norway and Sweden, in Finland, a \"siida\" (\"paliskunta\" in Finnish) is a reindeer-herding corporation that is not restricted by ethnicity. There are indeed some ethnic Finns who practice reindeer herding, and in principle, all residents of the reindeer herding area (most of Finnish Lapland and parts of Oulu province) who are citizens of EEA countries, i.e., the European Union and Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, are allowed to join a \"paliskunta\".\nRussian organizations.\nIn 2010, the S\u00e1mi Council supported the establishment of a cultural center in Russia for Arctic peoples. The Center for Northern Peoples aims to promote artistic and cultural cooperation between the Arctic peoples of Russia and the Nordic countries, with particular focus on Indigenous peoples and minorities.\nBorder conflicts.\nS\u00e1pmi, the S\u00e1mi traditional lands, cross four national borders. Traditional summer and winter pastures sometimes lie on different sides of the borders of the nation-states. In addition to that, there is a border drawn for modern-day S\u00e1pmi. Some state that the rights (for reindeer herding and, in some parts, even for fishing and hunting) include not only modern S\u00e1pmi but areas that are beyond today's S\u00e1pmi that reflect older territories. Today's \"borders\" originate from the 14th to 16th centuries when land-owning conflicts occurred. The establishment of more stable dwelling places and larger towns originates from the 16th century and was performed for strategic defence and economic reasons, both by peoples from S\u00e1mi groups themselves and more southern immigrants.\nOwning land within the borders or being a member of a \"siida\" (S\u00e1mi corporation) gives rights. A different law enacted in Sweden in the mid-1990s gave the right to anyone to fish and hunt in the region, something that was met with skepticism and anger amongst the \"siidas\".\nCourt proceedings have been common throughout history, and the aim from the S\u00e1mi viewpoint is to reclaim territories used earlier in history. Due to a major defeat in 1996, one \"siida\" has introduced a sponsorship \"Reindeer Godfather\" concept to raise funds for further battles in courts. These \"internal conflicts\" are usually conflicts between non-S\u00e1mi land owners and reindeer owners. Cases question the S\u00e1mi ancient rights to reindeer pastures. In 2010, Sweden was criticized for its relations with the S\u00e1mi in the Universal Periodic Review conducted by the Working Group of the Human Rights Council.\nThe question whether the fjeld's territory is owned by the governments (crown land) or by the S\u00e1mi population is not answered.\nFrom an Indigenous perspective, people \"belong to the land\", the land does not belong to people, but this does not mean that hunters, herders, and fishing people do not know where the borders of their territories are located as well as those of their neighbors.\nCulture.\nTo make up for past suppression, the authorities of Norway, Sweden and Finland now make an effort to build up S\u00e1mi cultural institutions and promote S\u00e1mi culture and language.\nS\u00e1mi identity symbols.\nAlthough the S\u00e1mi have considered themselves to be one people throughout history, the idea of S\u00e1pmi, a S\u00e1mi nation, first gained acceptance among the S\u00e1mi in the 1970s, and even later among the majority population. During the 1980s and 1990s, a S\u00e1mi flag was created, a S\u00e1mi anthem was written, and the date of a national day was established.\nS\u00e1mi flag.\nThe S\u00e1mi flag was inaugurated during the S\u00e1mi Conference in \u00c5re, Sweden, on 15 August 1986. It was the result of a competition for which many suggestions were entered. The winning design was submitted by the artist Astrid B\u00e5hl from Skibotn, Norway.\nThe motif (shown right) was derived from the shaman's drum and the poem \"P\u00e4iven P\u0101rne'\" (\"Sons of the Sun\") by the South S\u00e1mi Anders Fjellner describing the S\u00e1mi as sons and daughters of the sun. The flag has the S\u00e1mi colours, red, green, yellow and blue, and the circle represents the sun (red) and the moon (blue).\nS\u00e1mi People's Day.\nThe S\u00e1mi National Day falls on 6 February as this date was when the first S\u00e1mi congress was held in 1917 in Trondheim, Norway. This congress was the first time that Norwegian and Swedish S\u00e1mi came together across their national borders to work together to find solutions for common problems. The resolution for celebrating on 6 February was passed in 1992 at the 15th S\u00e1mi congress in Helsinki. Since 1993, Norway, Sweden and Finland have recognized 6 February as S\u00e1mi National Day.\n\"Song of the S\u00e1mi People\".\n\"\" (\"Song of the S\u00e1mi People\", lit.\u2009'Song of the S\u00e1mi Family') was originally a poem written by Isak Saba that was published in the newspaper \"Sa\u01e5ai Muittal\u00e6gje\" for the first time on 1 April 1906. In August 1986, it became the S\u00e1mi anthem. Arne S\u00f8rli set the poem to music, which was then approved at the 15th S\u00e1mi Conference in Helsinki in 1992. \"\" has been translated into all of the S\u00e1mi languages.\nReligion.\nMany S\u00e1mi people continued to practice their religion up until the 18th century. Most S\u00e1mi today belong to the state-run Lutheran churches of Norway, Sweden and Finland. Some S\u00e1mi in Russia belong to the Russian Orthodox Church, and similarly, some Skolt S\u00e1mi resettled in Finland are also part of an Eastern Orthodox congregation, with an additional small population in Norway.\nIndigenous S\u00e1mi religion.\nIndigenous S\u00e1mi religion is a type of polytheism. (See S\u00e1mi deities.) There is some diversity due to the wide area that is S\u00e1pmi, allowing for the evolution of variations in beliefs and practices between tribes. The beliefs are closely connected to the land, animism, and the supernatural. S\u00e1mi spirituality is often characterized by pantheism, a strong emphasis on the importance of personal spirituality and its interconnectivity with one's own daily life, and a deep connection between the natural and spiritual \"worlds\". Among other roles, the Noaidi, or S\u00e1mi shaman, enables ritual communication with the supernatural through the use of tools such as drums, Joik, Fadno, chants, sacred objects, and fly agaric. Some practices within the S\u00e1mi religion include natural sacred sites such as mountains, springs, land formations, Sieidi, as well as human-made ones such as petroglyphs and labyrinths.\nS\u00e1mi cosmology divides the universe into three worlds. The upper world is related to the South, warmth, life, and the color white. It is also the dwelling of the gods. The middle world is like the Norse Midgard, it is the dwelling of humans and it is associated with the color red. The third world is the underworld and it is associated with the color black, it represents the north, the cold and it is inhabited by otters, loons, and seals and mythical animals.\nS\u00e1mi religion shares some elements with Norse mythology, possibly from early contacts with trading Vikings (or vice versa). They were the last worshippers of Thor, as late as the 18th century according to contemporary ethnographers. Through a mainly French initiative from Joseph Paul Gaimard as part of his La Recherche Expedition, Lars Levi L\u00e6stadius began research on S\u00e1mi mythology. His work resulted in \"Fragments of Lappish Mythology\", since by his own admission, they contained only a small percentage of what had existed. The fragments were termed \"Theory of Gods\", \"Theory of Sacrifice\", \"Theory of Prophecy, or short reports about rumorous Sami magic\" and \"Sami sagas\". Generally, he claims to have filtered out the Norse influence and derived common elements between the South, North, and Eastern S\u00e1mi groups. The mythology has common elements with other Indigenous religions as well\u2014such as those of Indigenous peoples in Siberia and North America.\nChristian mission.\nThe term \"S\u00e1mi religion\" usually refers to the traditional religion, practiced by most S\u00e1mi until approximately the 18th century. Christianity was introduced by Roman Catholic missionaries as early as the 13th century. Increased pressure came after the Protestant Reformation, and rune drums were burned or sent to museums abroad. In this period, many S\u00e1mi practiced their traditional religion at home, while going to church on Sunday. Since the S\u00e1mi were considered to possess \"witchcraft\" powers, they were often accused of sorcery during the 17th century and were the subjects of witchcraft trials and burnings.\nIn Norway, a major effort to convert the S\u00e1mi was made around 1720, when Thomas von Westen, the \"Apostle of the S\u00e1mi\", burned drums, burned sacred objects, and converted people. Out of the estimated thousands of drums before this period, only about 70 are known to remain today, scattered in museums around Europe. Sacred sites were destroyed, such as sieidi (stones in natural or human-built formations), \u00e1lda and s\u00e1ivu (sacred hills), springs, caves and other natural formations where offerings were made.\nIn the far east of the S\u00e1mi area, the Russian monk Trifon converted the S\u00e1mi in the 16th century. Today, St. George's chapel in Neiden, Norway (1565), testifies to this effort.\nLaestadius.\nAround 1840 Swedish S\u00e1mi Lutheran pastor and administrator Lars Levi Laestadius initiated among the S\u00e1mi a puritanical pietist movement emphasizing complete abstinence from alcohol. This movement is still very dominant in S\u00e1mi-speaking areas. Laestadius spoke many languages, and he became fluent and preached in Finnish and Northern S\u00e1mi in addition to his native Southern S\u00e1mi and Swedish, the language he used for scholarly publications.\nTwo great challenges Laestadius had faced since his early days as a church minister were the indifference of his S\u00e1mi parishioners, who had been forced by the Swedish government to convert from their shamanistic religion to Lutheranism, and the misery alcoholism caused them. The spiritual understanding Laestadius acquired and shared in his new sermons \"filled with vivid metaphors from the lives of the S\u00e1mi that they could understand,\u00a0... about a God who cared about the lives of the people\" had a profound positive effect on both problems. One account from a S\u00e1mi cultural perspective recalls a new desire among the S\u00e1mi to learn to read and a \"bustle and energy in the church, with people confessing their sins, crying and praying for forgiveness\u00a0... [Alcohol abuse] and the theft of [the S\u00e1mis'] reindeer diminished, which had a positive influence on the S\u00e1mi's relationships, finances and family life.\"\nNeo-shamanism and traditional healing.\nToday there are a number of S\u00e1mi who seek to return to the traditional Pagan values of their ancestors. There are also some S\u00e1mi who claim to be \"noaidi\" and offer their services through newspaper advertisements, in New Age arrangements, or for tourist groups. While they practice a religion based on that of their ancestors, widespread anti-pagan prejudice has caused these shamans to be generally not viewed as part of an unbroken S\u00e1mi religious tradition. Traditional S\u00e1mi beliefs are composed of three intertwining elements: animism, shamanism, and polytheism. S\u00e1mi animism is manifested in the S\u00e1mi's belief that all significant natural objects (such as animals, plants, rocks, etc.) possess a soul; and from a polytheistic perspective, traditional S\u00e1mi beliefs include a multitude of spirits. Many contemporary practitioners are compared to practitioners of neo-paganism, as a number of neopagan religions likewise combine elements of ancient pagan religions with more recent revisions or innovations, but others feel they are attempting to revive or reconstruct Indigenous S\u00e1mi religions as found in historic, folkloric sources and oral traditions.\nIn 2012, County Governor of Troms approved Shamanic Association of Troms\u00f8 as a new religion.\nA very different religious idea is represented by the numerous \"wise men\" and \"wise women\" found throughout the S\u00e1mi area. They often offer to heal the sick through rituals and traditional medicines and may also combine traditional elements, such as older S\u00e1mi teachings, with newer monotheistic inventions that Christian missionaries taught their ancestors, such as readings from the Bible.\nDuodji (craft).\nDuodji, the S\u00e1mi handicraft, originates from the time when the S\u00e1mis were self-supporting nomads, believing therefore that an object should first and foremost serve a purpose rather than being primarily decorative. Men mostly use wood, bone, and antlers to make items such as antler-handled scrimshawed S\u00e1mi knives, drums, and guksi (burl cups). Women used leather and roots to make items such as g\u00e1kti (clothing), and birch- and spruce-root woven baskets.\nClothing.\nG\u00e1kti are the traditional clothing worn by the S\u00e1mi people. The g\u00e1kti is worn both in ceremonial contexts and while working, particularly when herding reindeer.\nTraditionally, the g\u00e1kti was made from reindeer leather and sinews, but nowadays, it is more common to use wool, cotton, or silk. Women's g\u00e1kti typically consist of a dress, a fringed shawl that is fastened with 1\u20133 silver brooches, and boots/shoes made of reindeer fur or leather. S\u00e1mi boots (or \"nutukas\") can have pointed or curled toes and often have band-woven ankle wraps. Eastern S\u00e1mi boots have a rounded toe on reindeer-fur boots, lined with felt and with beaded details. There are different g\u00e1kti for women and men; men's g\u00e1kti have a shorter \"jacket-skirt\" than a women's long dress. Traditional g\u00e1kti are most commonly in variations of red, blue, green, white, medium-brown tanned leather, or reindeer fur. In winter, there is the addition of a reindeer fur coat and leggings, and sometimes a poncho (luhkka) and rope/lasso.\nThe colours, patterns and the jewellery of the g\u00e1kti indicate where a person is from, if a person is single or married, and sometimes can even be specific to their family. The collar, sleeves and hem usually have appliqu\u00e9s in the form of geometric shapes. Some regions have ribbonwork, others have tin embroidery, and some Eastern S\u00e1mi have beading on clothing or collar. Hats vary by sex, season, and region. They can be wool, leather, or fur. They can be embroidered, or in the East, they are more like a beaded cloth crown with a shawl. Some traditional shamanic headgear had animal hides, plaits, and feathers, particularly in East S\u00e1pmi.\nThe g\u00e1kti can be worn with a belt; these are sometimes band-woven belts, woven, or beaded. Leather belts can have scrimshawed antler buttons, silver concho-like buttons, tassels, or brass/copper details such as rings. Belts can also have beaded leather pouches, antler needle cases, accessories for a fire, copper rings, amulets, and often a carved or scrimshawed antler-handled knife. Some Eastern S\u00e1mi also have a hooded jumper (\u043c\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0446) from reindeer skins with wool inside and above the knee boots.\nMusic.\nA characteristic feature of S\u00e1mi musical tradition is the singing of \"joik\". Joiks are song-chants and are traditionally sung \"a cappella\", usually sung slowly and deep in the throat with apparent emotional content of sorrow or anger. Joiks can be dedicated to animals and birds in nature, special people or special occasions, and they can be joyous, sad or melancholic. They often are based on syllablic improvisation. In recent years, musical instruments frequently accompany joiks. The only traditional S\u00e1mi instruments that were sometimes used to accompany joik are the \"fadno\" flute (made from reed-like \"Angelica archangelica\" stems) and hand drums (frame drums and bowl drums).\nVisual arts.\nIn addition to Duodji (S\u00e1mi handicraft), there is a developing area of contemporary S\u00e1mi visual art. Galleries such as S\u00e1mi D\u00e1iddaguovdd\u00e1\u0161 (Sami Center for Contemporary Art) are being established.\nDance.\nUnlike many other Indigenous peoples, traditional dance is generally not a visible manifestation of S\u00e1mi identity. This has led to a common misconception that S\u00e1mi, at least in western S\u00e1pmi, have no traditional dance culture.\nThe S\u00e1mi modern dance company Kompani Nomad looked to old descriptions of shamanistic rituals and behaviors to identify \"lost\" S\u00e1mi dances and reimagine them through contemporary dance. An example is the \"lihkadus\" (ecstasy dance) described in sources from the 16th and 17th centuries, but which was adapted by Swedish\u2013S\u00e1mi priest Lars Levi Laestadius, who brought it and other S\u00e1mi traditions into the Church of Sweden as part of the Laestadianism movement.\nPartner and group dancing have been a part of Skolt S\u00e1mi culture and among S\u00e1mi on the Kola Peninsula since at least the second half of the 1800s. These square dances, couple dances, circle dances, and singing games are influenced by Karelian and Northern Russian dance cultures, likely under the influence of Russian traders, military service under the tsar, and the Russian Orthodox Church. This eastern S\u00e1pmi dance tradition has been more continuous and has been adapted by modern S\u00e1mi dance companies such as Johtti Kompani.\nReindeer husbandry.\nReindeer husbandry has been and still is an important aspect of S\u00e1mi culture. Traditionally the S\u00e1mi lived and worked in reindeer herding groups called \"siidat\", which consist of several families and their herds. Members of the \"siida\" helped each other with the management and husbandry of the herds. During the years of forced assimilation, the areas in which reindeer herding was an important livelihood were among the few where the S\u00e1mi culture and language survived.\nToday in Norway and Sweden, reindeer husbandry is legally protected as an exclusive S\u00e1mi livelihood, such that only persons of S\u00e1mi descent with a linkage to a reindeer herding family can own, and hence make a living off, reindeer. Presently, about 2,800 people are engaged in reindeer herding in Norway. In Finland, reindeer husbandry is not exclusive and is also practiced to a limited degree by ethnic Finns. Legally, it is restricted to EU/EEA nationals resident in the area. In the north (Lapland), it plays a major role in the local economy, while its economic impact is lesser in the southern parts of the area (Province of Oulu).\nAmong the reindeer herders in S\u00e1mi villages, the women usually have a higher level of formal education in the area.\nGames.\nThe S\u00e1mi have traditionally played both card games and board games, but few S\u00e1mi games have survived, because Christian missionaries and Laestadianists considered such games sinful. The rules of only three S\u00e1mi board games have been preserved into modern times. \"S\u00e1hkku\" is a running-fight board game where each player controls a set of soldiers (referred to as \"women\" and \"men\") that race across a board in a loop, attempting to eliminate the other player's soldiers. The game is related to South Scandinavian dald\u00f8s, Arabian t\u00e2b and Indian tablan. S\u00e1hkku differs from these games in several respects, most notably the addition of a piece \u2013 \"the king\" \u2013 that changes gameplay radically. \"Tablut\" is a pure strategy game in the tafl family. The game features \"Swedes\" and a \"Swedish king\" whose goal is to escape, and an army of \"Muscovites\" whose goal is to capture the king. Tablut is the only tafl game where a relatively intact set of rules have survived into our time. Hence, all modern versions of tafl (commonly called \"Hnefatafl\" and marketed exclusively as \"Norse\" or \"Viking\" games) are based on the S\u00e1mi game of tablut. \"Dablot Prejjesne\" is a game related to alquerque which differs from most such games (e.g. draughts) by having pieces of three different ranks. The game's two sides are referred to as \"S\u00e1mi\" (king, prince, warriors) and \"Finlenders\" (landowners, landowner's son, farmers).\nCultural region.\nS\u00e1pmi is located in Northern Europe, includes the northern parts of Fennoscandia and spans four countries: Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Russia. Non-S\u00e1mi and many regional maps have often called this same region \"Lapland\" as there is considerable regional overlap between S\u00e1pmi and the provinces of Lappland in Sweden and Lapland in Finland. Much of S\u00e1pmi falls outside of those provinces. Despite the terms use in tourism, \"Lapland\" can be either misleading or offensive, or both, to S\u00e1mi, depending on the context and where this word is used. Among the S\u00e1mi people, \"S\u00e1pmi\" is strictly used and acceptable.\nExtent.\nThere is no official geographic definition for the boundaries of S\u00e1pmi. However, the following counties and provinces are usually included:\nThe municipalities of G\u00e4llivare, Jokkmokk and Arjeplog in Swedish Lappland were designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996 as a \"Laponian Area\".\nThe S\u00e1mi Domicile Area in Finland consists of the municipalities of Enonteki\u00f6, Utsjoki and Inari as well as a part of the municipality of Sodankyl\u00e4. About 3,000 of Finland's about 10,000 S\u00e1mi people speak S\u00e1mi as their mother tongue. Today, a considerable part of the Finnish S\u00e1mi live outside the S\u00e1pmi region, for example in Helsinki there is a relatively large and active S\u00e1mi minority. According to the S\u00e1mi Parliament, the S\u00e1mi live in 230 municipalities out of a total of 336 municipalities in Finland. 75% of S\u00e1mi under the age of 10 live outside the S\u00e1pmi region.\nImportant S\u00e1mi settlements.\nThe following municipalities have a significant S\u00e1mi population or host S\u00e1mi institutions (Norwegian, Swedish, Finnish or Russian name in parentheses):\nDemographics.\nIn the geographical area of S\u00e1pmi, the S\u00e1mi are a small population. According to some, the estimated total S\u00e1mi population is about 70,000. One problem when attempting to count the population of the S\u00e1mi is that there are few common criteria of what \"being a S\u00e1mi\" constitutes. In addition, there are several S\u00e1mi languages and additional dialects, and there are several areas in Sapmi where few of the S\u00e1mi speak their native language due to the forced cultural assimilation, but still consider themselves S\u00e1mi. Other identity markers are kinship (which can be said to, at some level or other, be of high importance for all S\u00e1mi), the geographical region of S\u00e1pmi where their family came from, or protecting or preserving certain aspects of S\u00e1mi culture.\nAll the Nordic S\u00e1mi Parliaments have included as the \"core\" criterion for registering as a S\u00e1mi the identity in itself\u2014one must declare that one truly considers oneself a S\u00e1mi. Objective criteria vary, but are generally related to kinship or language.\nStill, due to the cultural assimilation of the S\u00e1mi people that had occurred in the four countries over the centuries, population estimates are difficult to measure precisely. The population has been estimated to be between 80,000 and 135,000 across the whole Nordic region, including urban areas such as Oslo, Norway, traditionally considered outside S\u00e1pmi. The Norwegian state recognizes any Norwegian as S\u00e1mi if he or she has one great-grandparent whose home language was S\u00e1mi, but there is not, and has never been, any registration of the home language spoken by Norwegian people.\nRoughly half of all S\u00e1mi live in Norway, but many live in Sweden, with smaller groups living in the far north of Finland and the Kola Peninsula of Russia. The S\u00e1mi in Russia were forced by the Soviet authorities to relocate to a collective called Lovozero/Luj\u00e1vri, in the central part of the Kola Peninsula.\nLanguage.\nThere is no single S\u00e1mi language, but a group of ten distinct S\u00e1mi languages. Six of these languages have their own written standards. The S\u00e1mi languages are relatively closely related, but not mutually intelligible; for instance, speakers of Southern S\u00e1mi cannot understand Northern S\u00e1mi. Especially earlier, these distinct languages were referred to as \"dialects\", but today, this is considered misleading due to the deep differences between the varieties. Most S\u00e1mi languages are spoken in several countries, because linguistic borders do not correspond to national borders.\nAll S\u00e1mi languages are at some degree of endangerment, ranging from what UNESCO defines as \"definitely endangered\" to \"extinct\". This is due in part to historic laws prohibiting the use of S\u00e1mi languages in schools and at home in Sweden and Norway. S\u00e1mi languages, and S\u00e1mi song-chants, called joiks, were illegal in Norway from 1773 until 1958. Then, access to S\u00e1mi instruction as part of schooling was not available until 1988. Special residential schools that would assimilate the S\u00e1mi into the dominant culture were established. These were originally run by missionaries, but later, controlled by the government. For example, in Russia, S\u00e1mi children were taken away when aged 1\u20132 and returned when aged 15\u201317 with no knowledge of their language and traditional communities. Not all S\u00e1mi viewed the schools negatively, and not all of the schools were brutal. However, being taken from home and prohibited from speaking S\u00e1mi has resulted in cultural alienation, loss of language, and lowered self-esteem.\nThe S\u00e1mi languages belong to the Uralic language family, linguistically related to Finnish, Estonian, and Hungarian. Due to prolonged contact and import of items foreign to S\u00e1mi culture from neighboring Scandinavians, there are a number of Germanic loanwords in S\u00e1mi, particularly for \"urban\" objects. The majority of the S\u00e1mi now speak the majority languages of the countries they live in, i.e., Swedish, Russian, Finnish and Norwegian. Efforts are being made to further the use of S\u00e1mi languages among S\u00e1mi and persons of S\u00e1mi origin. Despite these changes, the legacy of cultural repression still exists. Many older S\u00e1mi still refuse to speak S\u00e1mi. In addition, S\u00e1mi parents still feel alienated from schools and hence do not participate as much as they could in shaping school curricula and policy.\nIn Norway, the name of the language is \"samisk\", and the name of the people is \"Same\"; in Finland, the name of the language is spelled \"saame\" and the name of the people \"saamelainen\".\nAmerican scientist Michael E. Krauss published in 1997 an estimate of S\u00e1mi population and their languages.\nKemi S\u00e1mi language became extinct in the 19th century.\nMany S\u00e1mi do not speak any of the S\u00e1mi languages any more due to historical assimilation policies, so the number of S\u00e1mi living in each area is much higher.\nDivision by geography.\nS\u00e1pmi is traditionally divided into:\nIt should also be noted that many S\u00e1mi now live outside S\u00e1pmi, in large cities such as Oslo in Norway.\nDivision by occupation.\nA division often used in Northern S\u00e1mi is based on occupation and the area of living. This division is also used in many historical texts:\nDivision by country.\nAccording to the Norwegian S\u00e1mi Parliament, the S\u00e1mi population of Norway is 40,000. If all people who speak S\u00e1mi or have a parent, grandparent, or great-grandparent who speaks or spoke S\u00e1mi are included, the number reaches 70,000. As of 2021, 20,545 people were registered to vote in the election for the S\u00e1mi Parliament in Norway. The bulk of the S\u00e1mi live in Finnmark and Northern Troms, but there are also S\u00e1mi populations in Southern Troms, Nordland and Tr\u00f8ndelag. Due to recent migration, it has also been claimed that Oslo is the municipality with the largest S\u00e1mi population. The S\u00e1mi are in a majority only in Guovdageaidnu Municipality, K\u00e1r\u00e1\u0161johka Municipality, Pors\u00e1\u014bgu Municipality, Deatnu Municipality and Unj\u00e1rga Municipality in Finnmark, and G\u00e1ivuotna Municipality in Northern Troms. This area is also known as the S\u00e1mi core area, and S\u00e1mi and Norwegian are co-equal administrative languages here.\nAccording to the Swedish S\u00e1mi Parliament, estimates of the size of the S\u00e1mi population of Sweden ranges from 20,000 to 40,000. As of 2021, 9,226 people were registered to vote in elections to the Swedish S\u00e1mi Parliament.\nAccording to the Finnish Population Registry Center and the Finnish S\u00e1mi Parliament, the S\u00e1mi population living in Finland was 10,753 in 2019. As of 31 December 2021, only 2,023 people were registered as speaking a S\u00e1mi language as their mother tongue.\nAccording to the 2010 All-Russia Census, the S\u00e1mi population of Russia was 1,771.\nS\u00e1mi diaspora outside of S\u00e1pmi.\nThere are an estimated 30,000 people living in North America who are either S\u00e1mi, or descendants of S\u00e1mi. Most have settled in areas that are known to have Norwegian, Swedish and Finnish immigrants. Some of the concentrated areas of S\u00e1mi Americans are Minnesota, North Dakota, Iowa, Wisconsin, the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, Illinois, California, Washington, Utah and Alaska; and throughout Canada, including Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Northern Ontario, and the Canadian territories of the Northwest Territories, Yukon and Nunavut.\nDescendants of these S\u00e1mi immigrants typically know little of their heritage because their ancestors purposely hid their Indigenous culture to avoid discrimination from the dominating Scandinavian or Nordic culture. Some of these S\u00e1mi are part of a diaspora that moved to North America in order to escape assimilation policies in their home countries. There were also several S\u00e1mi families that were brought to North America with herds of reindeer by the U.S. and Canadian governments as part of the Alaska Reindeer Service designed to teach the Inuit about reindeer herding.\nSome of these S\u00e1mi immigrants and descendants of immigrants are members of the Sami Siida of North America.\nGenetic studies.\nAnthropologists have been studying the S\u00e1mi people for hundreds of years for their assumed physical and cultural differences from the rest of the Europeans. Recent genetic studies have indicated that the two most frequent maternal lineages of the S\u00e1mi people are the haplogroups V (Neolithic in Europe and not found in Finland 1500 years ago) and U5b (ancient in Europe). Y-chromosome haplogroup N-VL29 makes up 20%, came from Siberia 3500 years ago. Y-chromosome N-Z1936 makes up similarly about 20%, and likely came from Siberia with the S\u00e1mi language, but slightly later than N-VL29. This tallies with archeological evidence suggesting that several different cultural groups made their way to the core area of S\u00e1mi from 8000 to 6000\u00a0BC, presumably including some of the ancestors of present-day S\u00e1mi.\nThe S\u00e1mi have been found to be genetically unrelated to people of the Pitted Ware culture. The Pitted Ware culture are in turn genetically continuous with the original Scandinavian Hunter-Gatherers.\nHistory of scientific research carried out on the S\u00e1mi.\nThe genetic makeup of S\u00e1mi people has been extensively studied for as long as such research has been in existence. Ethnographic photography of the S\u00e1mi began with the invention of the camera in the 19th century. This continued on into the 1920s and 1930s, when S\u00e1mi were photographed naked and anatomically measured by scientists, with the help of the local police\u2014sometimes at gunpoint\u2014to collect data that would justify their own racial theories. Thus, there is a degree of distrust by some in the S\u00e1mi community towards genetic research.\nS\u00e1mi graves were plundered to provide research materials, of which their remains and artifacts from this period from across S\u00e1pmi can still be found in various state collections. In the late 19th century, colonial fascination with Arctic peoples led to human beings exhibited in human zoos. S\u00e1mi people were exhibited with their traditional lavvu tents, weapons, and sleds, beside a group of reindeer at Tierpark Hagenbeck and other zoos across the globe.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "27123", "revid": "16795434", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27123", "title": "Saarland", "text": "State in Germany\nSaarland () is a state of Germany in the southwest of the country. With an area of and a population of 990,509 in 2018, it is the smallest German state in area apart from the city-states of Berlin, Bremen, and Hamburg, and the smallest in population apart from Bremen. Saarbr\u00fccken is the state capital and largest city; other cities include Neunkirchen and Saarlouis. Saarland is mainly surrounded by the department of Moselle (Grand Est) in France to the west and south and the neighboring state of Rhineland-Palatinate in Germany to the north and east; it also shares a small border, about long, with the canton of Remich in Luxembourg to the northwest.\nHaving long been a relatively small part of the long-contested territories along the Franco-German linguistic border, Saarland first gained specific economic and strategic importance in the nineteenth century due to the wealth of its coal deposits and the heavy industrialization that grew as a result. Saarland was first established as a distinct political entity in 1920 after World War I as the Territory of the Saar Basin, which was occupied and governed by France under a League of Nations mandate.\nSaarland was returned to Nazi Germany in the 1935 Saar status referendum. Following World War II in Europe, the territory was occupied by France, then became the Saar Protectorate on 17 December 1947. After the 1955 Saar Statute referendum, it joined the Federal Republic of Germany as a state on 1 January 1957. Saarland used its own currency, the Saar franc, and postage stamps issued specially for the territory until 1959.\nHistory.\nBefore World War I.\nThe region of the Saarland was settled by the Celtic tribes of Treveri and Mediomatrici. The most impressive relic of their time is the remains of a fortress of refuge at Otzenhausen in the north of the Saarland. In the 1st century BC, the Roman Empire made the region part of its province of Belgica, and the Celtic population mixed with the Roman conquerors. The region became wealthy, which can still be seen in the remains of Roman villas and villages.\nRoman rule ended in the 5th century, when the Franks conquered the territory. For the next 1,300 years the region shared the history of the Kingdom of the Franks, the Carolingian Empire and the Holy Roman Empire. The region of the Saarland was divided into several small territories, some of which were ruled by sovereigns of adjoining regions. Most important of the local rulers were the counts of Nassau-Saarbr\u00fccken. Within the Holy Roman Empire these territories gained a wide range of independence, threatened, however, by the French kings, who sought from the 17th century onwards to incorporate all the territories on the western side of the river Rhine. They invaded the area in 1635, 1676, 1679, and 1734, extending their realm to the river Saar and establishing the city and stronghold of Saarlouis in 1680.\nIt was not the king of France but the armies of the French Revolution who terminated the independence of the states in the region of the Saarland. After 1792 they conquered the region and made it part of the French Republic. While a strip in the west belonged to the Moselle department, the centre in 1798 became part of the Sarre department, and the east became part of the Mont-Tonnerre department. After the defeat of Napoleon in 1815, the region was divided again. Most of it became part of the Prussian Rhine Province. Another part in the east, corresponding to the present Saarpfalz district, was allocated to the Kingdom of Bavaria. A small part in the northeast was ruled by the Duke of Oldenburg.\nOn 31 July 1870, the French Emperor Napoleon III ordered an invasion across the River Saar to seize Saarbr\u00fccken. The first shots of the Franco-Prussian War of 1870\u201371 were fired on the heights of Spichern during the Battle of Spicheren, south of Saarbr\u00fccken. The Saar region became part of the German Empire which came into existence on 18 January 1871, during the course of the war.\nInterwar history.\nIn 1921, the Saargebiet was occupied by Britain and France under the provisions of the Treaty of Versailles. The occupied area included portions of the Prussian Rhine Province and the Bavarian Rhenish Palatinate. In practice the region was administered by France. In 1920, this was formalized by a 15-year mandate by the League of Nations.\nIn 1933, a considerable number of communists and other political opponents of Nazism fled to the Saar, as it was the only part of Germany that remained outside national administration following the First World War. As a result, anti-Nazi groups agitated for the Saarland to remain under French administration. However, with most of the population being ethnically German, such views were considered suspect or even treasonous, and therefore found little support.\nWhen the original 15-year term was over, a plebiscite was held in the territory on 13 January 1935 in which 90.8 percent of those voting favoured rejoining Germany.\nNazi period.\nFollowing the referendum Josef B\u00fcrckel was appointed on 1 March 1935 as the German Reich's commissioner for reintegration (). Once the reincorporation was accomplished, on 17 June 1936 his title was changed to (Reich Commissioner for the Saarland). In September 1939, in response to the German invasion of Poland, French forces invaded the Saarland in a half-hearted offensive, occupying some villages and meeting little resistance, before withdrawing. After 8 April 1940 B\u00fcrckel's title was changed again to (Reich Commissioner for the Saar Palatinate); finally, after 11 March 1941, B\u00fcrckel was made (Reich Governor of the Western Borderland). He died on 28 September 1944 and was succeeded by Willi St\u00f6hr, who remained in office until the region fell to advancing American forces in March 1945.\nHistory after World War II.\nAfter World War II, the Saarland came under French occupation again and became the Saar Protectorate. France did not annex the Saar or expel the local German population, in contrast to the fate of the territories which were merged by Poland and the USSR. In his speech \"Restatement of Policy on Germany\", made in Stuttgart on 6 September 1946, United States Secretary of State James F. Byrnes stated the U.S. position on detaching the Saar from Germany: \"The United States does not feel that it can deny to France, which has been invaded three times by Germany in 70 years, its claim to the Saar territory\".\nThe Saar and Ruhr areas were historically a central location for coal mining. This attracted the steel industry, which is essential for the production of munitions. The Treaty of Paris (1951) established the European Coal and Steel Community, which led to the termination of the International Authority for the Ruhr (whose purpose was to regulate Ruhr coal and steel production and distribution). However, the Treaty sidestepped the issue of the Saar protectorate: an attached protocol stated Germany and France agreed the Treaty would have no bearing on their views of the status of the Saar.\nIn 1948, the French government established Saarland University under the auspices of the University of Nancy. It is the principal university in the state, the other being Saarland University of Applied Sciences (HTW Saar).\nThe Saarland was headed by a military governor from 30 August 1945: Gilbert Yves Edmond Grandval (1904\u20131981), who remained, on 1 January 1948, as High Commissioner, and from January 1952 \u2013 June 1955 as the first of two French ambassadors, his successor being \u00c9ric de Carbonnel (1910\u20131965) until 1956.\nSaarland, however, was allowed a regional administration very early, consecutively headed by:\nIn 1954, France and the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany) developed a detailed plan called the (Saar Statute) to establish an independent Saarland. It was signed as an agreement between the two countries on 23 October 1954 as one of the Paris Pacts, but a plebiscite held on 23 October 1955 rejected it by 67.7%.\nOn 27 October 1956, the Saar Treaty declared that Saarland should be allowed to join West Germany, which it did on 1 January 1957. This was the last significant international border change in Europe until the fall of Communism over 30 years later.\nThe Saarland's unification with West Germany was sometimes referred to as the ('little reunification', in contrast with the post-Cold War reunification with the GDR). After unification, the Saar franc remained as the territory's currency until West Germany's Deutsche Mark replaced it on 7 July 1959. The Saar Treaty established that French, not English as in the rest of West Germany, should remain the first foreign language taught in Saarland schools; this provision was still largely followed after it was no longer binding.\nSince 1971, Saarland has been a member of SaarLorLux, a euroregion created from Saarland, Lorraine, Luxembourg, Rhineland Palatinate, and Wallonia.\nGeography.\nThe state borders France (department of Moselle, which forms part of the region of Grand Est) to the south and west, Luxembourg (Grevenmacher District) to the west and Rhineland-Palatinate to the north and the east. It is named after the river Saar, a tributary of the Moselle (itself a tributary of the Rhine), which runs through the state from the south to the northwest.\nSaarland is about the same size as neighboring Luxembourg with Luxembourg being 2,586sq km (998 sq mi) and Saarland at 2,570sq km (990sq mi). Within Germany, it is slightly larger than the combined area of the three city-states (Berlin, Bremen, and Hamburg) but is by far the smallest of the \"Fl\u00e4chenl\u00e4nder\" (\"area-states\"). It is less than one sixth the size of Schleswig-Holstein, the next smallest German state. One third of the land area of the Saarland is covered by forest, one of the highest percentages in Germany. The state is generally hilly; the highest mountain is the Dollberg with a height of .\nMost inhabitants live in a city agglomeration on the French border, surrounding the capital of Saarbr\u00fccken.\nSee also List of places in Saarland.\nDistricts.\nSaarland is divided into six districts ():\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nLargest cities.\nThe following table shows the ten largest cities of Saarland:\nReligion.\nSaarland is the most religious state in Germany. The adherents of the Catholic Church comprise 56.8% of the population, organised in the two dioceses of Trier (comprising the formerly Prussian part of Saarland) and Speyer (for the smaller eastern formerly Palatine part). 17.5% of the Saarlandic population adhere to the Protestant Church in Germany (Evangelische Kirche in Deutschland, EKD), organised in the two Landeskirchen named Evangelical Church in the Rhineland and Evangelical Church of the Palatinate, both following the same former territorial partition. 25.7% are not affiliated with one of these churches.\nSaarland has the highest concentration of Roman Catholics of any German state, and is the only state in which Catholics form an absolute majority (over 50%).\nPolitics.\nExcept for the periods between 1985 and 1999, as well as since 2022 \u2013 when the centre-left Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) has held a majority of seats in the Landtag (state diet) \u2013 the centre-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU) has governed the Saarland, either alone or in coalition, since the accession of the state to the Federal Republic of Germany in 1957.\nAfter the 2022 state elections the previous Grand Coalition between the CDU and SPD, the two largest parties in the Landtag, was replaced by an SPD majority government, the only single-party majority government of any German state, led by minister-president Anke Rehlinger.\nEconomy.\nThe gross domestic product (GDP) of the state was \u20ac35.4 billion in 2018, accounting for 1.1% of German economic output. GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was \u20ac32,800 or 109% of the EU27 average in the same year. The GDP per employee was 93% of the EU average. The GDP per capita was the second lowest of all states in West Germany.\nImportant income sources are the automobile industry, steel industry, ceramic industry and computer science and information systems industry. In the past, coal mining was an important branch of industry. However, the last coal mine in Saarland closed in 2012, ending 250 years of coal mining history in the region. The decision to close the mines was motivated by safety concerns about earthquakes in the region.\nThe unemployment rate stood at 5.8% in October 2018 and was higher than the national average but below the EU28 average.\nEducation.\nEducation in Saarland, follows the standard three-tiered structure of the German public system while maintaining strong ties to its cross-border location. After Grundschule (primary school), which typically lasts four years, students move into one of three main secondary tracks: Gymnasium, Gemeinschaftsschule, or Berufsschulen. The Gymnasium track prepares students for academic studies and ends with the Abitur (higher education entrance qualification); in Saarland, it generally runs for eight years (G8). The Gemeinschaftsschule is a comprehensive secondary school offering various certificates, often integrating vocational preparation Berufsschulen are vocational schools central to the Dual System of training, where apprentices combine part-time classroom instruction with practical, on-the-job training at a company.\nSaarland is home to several key institutions that drive regional research and cross-border cooperation, including the administrative headquarters of the Franco-German University (DFH) in Saarbr\u00fccken\nSaarland University (Universit\u00e4t des Saarlandes), located primarily in Saarbr\u00fccken and Homburg, is particularly noted for its excellence in Computer Science and European Law, benefiting from its unique European location. The University of Applied Sciences (Hochschule f\u00fcr Technik und Wirtschaft des Saarlandes - HTW) focuses on practical engineering, economics, and social sciences, maintaining strong links with the region's industrial base. \nA unique feature of higher education in the state is the Franco-German component, as Saarland University runs several integrated Franco-German programs and maintains close partnerships with institutions in neighboring France, fostering strong multilingual academic environments.\nTransport.\nThe region's main airport is Saarbr\u00fccken Airport which provides some domestic and European flights, it is located east of Saarbr\u00fccken. Generally, residents of state would also use Luxembourg Airport and Frankfurt Airport in which both provides more domestic and international flights.\nCulture.\nLocal dialect.\nPeople in the Saarland speak Rhine Franconian (in the southeast, very similar to that dialect spoken in the western part of the Palatinate) and Moselle Franconian (in the northwest, very similar to that dialect spoken along the river Moselle and the cities of Trier or even in Luxembourg). Outside of the Saarland, specifically the Rhine-Franconian variant spoken in the state capital Saarbr\u00fccken is generally considered to be \"the\" Saarland dialect. The two dialect regions are mainly separated by the / isogloss; in the northwestern portion of the state, including cities such as Saarlouis, standard German is pronounced with a final instead of an .\nIn general, both dialects are an integral part of Saarland identity.\nBoth dialects, particularly in their respective Saarland flavour, share many characteristic features, some of which will be explained below.\nWomen and girls are often referred to using the neuter pronoun , with the pronunciation being something like : ('it told me so', instead of 'she told me so'; vs. High German: ). This stems from the word (girl) being neuter ( is correct when referring to words like but would not be used by itself in reference to a woman).\nThe subjunctive in Rhine Franconian is normally composed with the words (High German = \"would do\") or (\"would go\") as auxiliary verbs: (\"I would say that...\") instead of the High German .\nDeclension is rather different:\nDiphthongs are less common than in Standard German. This is because the Standard German diphthongs \"ei\" and \"au\" are each the result of a merger of two Middle High German vowels \u2013 however, these mergers did not take place in the Saarland, and only one of the two merged vowels is pronounced as a diphthong. The front rounded vowels \"\u00f6\", \"\u00fc\", and \"eu\" are replaced by \"e\", \"i\", and \"ei\" respectively.\nBoth the Rhine Franconian and Moselle Franconian dialects (and Luxembourgish) have merged the palatal fricative sound as in with the post-alveolar fricative as in 'fresh', causing High German minimal pairs such as 'church' and 'cherry' to be pronounced in the same way.\nFrench has had a considerable influence on the vocabulary, although the pronunciation of imported French words is usually quite different from their originals. Popular examples include (from ), (from ), and the imperative or greeting (from ).\nThe English sentence \"My house is green\" is pronounced almost the same in the Rhine Franconian variant: . The main difference lies in the pronunciation of the \u27e8r\u27e9 sound.\nRegional beer brewer Karlsberg has taken advantage of the Saarlandish dialect to create clever advertising for its staple product, UrPils. Examples include a trio of men enjoying a beer, flanked by baby carriages, the slogan reading (meaning \"Mum's at work\" in Saarlandish, but plays on the High German word 'motherhood'); another depicts a trio of men at a bar, with one realizing his beer has been drunk by one of the others, the slogan reading (meaning \"It was no one\" [] in Saarlandish, but playing on the High German word 'connoisseur', translating to \"It was a connoisseur\"); a third shows an empty beer crate in outer space, the text reading (meaning \"empty\" in Saarlandish, but playing on the same High German word meaning \"outer space\").\nFrench.\nThe French language has a special standing in Saarland due to its geographical proximity to France. Today, a part of the population is able to speak French, and it is compulsory at many schools. Saarbr\u00fccken is also home to a bilingual (German-French high school). In January 2014 the Saarland state government announced its aim of making the region fully bilingual in German and French by 2043.\nSports.\nThe Saar competed in the qualifying section of the 1954 FIFA World Cup, but failed after coming second to West Germany but ahead of Norway. It also competed as Saar in the 1952 Summer Olympics and the field handball world championships in the beginning of the 1950s.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "27126", "revid": "45957157", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27126", "title": "Schleswig-Holstein", "text": "State in Germany\nSchleswig-Holstein (; ; ; ; ; occasionally in English \"Sleswick-Holsatia\") is the northernmost of the 16 states of Germany, comprising most of the historical Duchy of Holstein and the southern part of the former Duchy of Schleswig. Its capital city is Kiel; other notable cities are L\u00fcbeck and Flensburg. It covers an area of , making it the 5th smallest German federal state by area (including the city-states). Historically, the name can also refer to a larger region, containing both present-day Schleswig-Holstein and the former South Jutland County (Northern Schleswig; now part of the Region of Southern Denmark) in Denmark. \nSchleswig, known as South Jutland at the time, had been under Danish control since the fifth century. In the 12th century, however, it became a duchy within Denmark due to infighting in the Danish royal house. It bordered Holstein, which was a part of the Holy Roman Empire. Beginning in 1460, the King of Denmark ruled both Schleswig and Holstein as their duke. Schleswig was still part of Denmark, while Holstein remained part of the Holy Roman Empire. In the 19th century, both Danes and Germans believed they had a rightful claim to Schleswig-Holstein. While the population of Holstein and Lauenburg was entirely ethnically German, Schleswig had been predominantly Danish until the late 1700s and early 1800s, when extensive German influence led to the Germanization of South Schleswig. The resulting long-term political and territorial dispute was known as the Schleswig-Holstein Question. In 1848, Denmark tried to formally annex the area. Prussia responded by invading, thus beginning the First Schleswig War, which ended in a victory for Denmark. But in the Second Schleswig War (1864), Prussia and Austria won, and the territory was absorbed into Prussia in 1867. After the German defeat in World War I the Allies required that the question of sovereignty over the territory be submitted to plebiscites (the 1920 Schleswig plebiscites). They resulted in the return of the Danish-speaking North Schleswig to Denmark. The area was subsequently renamed South Jutland, restoring the historical name used before it was changed to Schleswig by Gerhard III of the House of Schauenburg. After World War II, Schleswig-Holstein took in over a million refugees.\nToday, Schleswig-Holstein's economy is known for its agriculture, such as its Holstein cows. Its position on the Atlantic Ocean makes it a major trade point and shipbuilding site; it is also the location of the Kiel Canal. Its offshore oil wells and wind farms produce significant amounts of energy. Fishing is a major industry and the basis of its distinctive, unique local cuisine. It is a popular tourist destination for Germans and visitors from across the globe.\nHistory.\nThe term \"Holstein\" derives from Old Saxon \"Holseta Land\" (\"Holz\" means wood in modern Standardized German; \"holt\" is a now-archaic English word for woods.) Originally, the term referred to the central of the three Saxon tribes north of the River Elbe: \"Tedmarsgoi\" (Dithmarschen), Holstein, and \"Sturmarii\" (Stormarn). The area inhabited by the tribe of the Holsts lay between the St\u00f6r River and Hamburg; after Christianization, their main church was in Schenefeld. Saxon Holstein became a part of the Holy Roman Empire after Charlemagne's Saxon campaigns in the late eighth century. Beginning in 811, the northern border of Holstein (and thus of the Empire) was the River Eider.\nThe term \"Schleswig\" originally referred to the city of Schleswig. The word Schleswig is a German transliteration of the Danish word Slesvig, which consists of two words: Schlei and vig. The Schlei refers to the river at which the city lies, and vig means \"inlet\" or bay. Schleswig, therefore, means (in Danish): \"The bay at the river Schlei\". The Schlei is known as Slien in Danish and is believed to have been used only for the inner Slien (the Great and Little Bay near the city of Schleswig). The word is thought to be related to Sl\u00e6, which means reeds and aquatic plants found in this area.\nThe Duchy of Schleswig, or Southern Jutland, was originally an integral part of Denmark, but in medieval times was established as a fief under the control of the Kingdom of Denmark, having the same relationship with the Danish Crown as, for example, Brandenburg or Bavaria had with the Holy Roman Emperor. Around 1100, the Duchy of Saxony gave Holstein to Count Adolf I of Schauenburg.\nThe Migration Period.\nDuring the Migration Period, the Jutland peninsula was home to several tribes. The Jutes inhabited the most northern part of the peninsula from Grenen to Olger's Dyke. This dyke, dating back to around the first century, served as the boundary between the Jutes in the north and the Angles in the south. This dyke lost its relevance in the 200s when the Angles expanded northward, leading to the establishment of a new dyke called the Wendish Dyke. The southern border of the Angles was marked by the marshes surrounding the Eider, that combined with the dense old-growth forest to the south of the river, formed a natural barrier. South of the forest lay the region now known as Holstein, which was divided between the Germanic Saxons, who inhabited the western part, and the Slavic Wagri, who lived in the eastern part. In the 8th century, the Wagri became part of the Slavic tribal confederation known as the Obotrites (also known as the Wends by the Danes and Saxons).\nDuring the 4th and early 5th centuries, a significant migration saw the Jutes, Angles, and Saxons depart from their homelands to settle in the British Isles. This mass exodus left much of the Jutland Peninsula sparsely populated, allowing the Danes from southern Scandinavia and the islands of Zealand, Funen, and other smaller Danish isles to migrate into the peninsula. They gradually settled the region, integrating the remaining Jutes and Angles who had not left for Britain. By the mid-5th century, the Danes had established settlements from Grenen in the north to just north of the Eider River and its marshes. Their southernmost settlements being around Schwansen, Hedeby and Husum, mirroring the same southern border as their Angle predecessors. As raiding was a frequent practice among the Danes, Saxons, and Wagrians, the borderlands was a hostile and unsafe area to inhabit. In response to these threats, the Danes began constructing the Danevirke. Originally built as a dyke, it was gradually expanded into a 30-kilometer earthwork with a palisade fortification, forming a barrier between the Danes and their southern neighbors. The Danevirke was strategically positioned at the narrowest point of the peninsula, with its eastern end beginning at the Treene River and extending to the Schlei Bay. This fortification served to deter Saxon and Wagrian raids while enabling the Danes to launch their own raids into southern territories. It would remain in use until 1864, being expanded and adapted to the changing military needs of the Danes multiple times.\nThe establishment of the Danevirke not only helped to prevent Saxon and Wagrian raids into Danish territory but also served as a toll station. Danish chieftains would collect fees from traders, merchants, and peasants traveling along the H\u00e6rvejen (Heerweg/Armyway), the main trade route running through the peninsula. Saxons, Wagrians, and Danes alike used the H\u00e6rvejen to trade goods such as honey, furs, amber, glass, metalwork, and other commodities, such as livestock, with cattle and oxen being particularly important. Especially the Danes developed a thriving livestock breeding industry, driving large herds along the H\u00e6rvejen to sell on the continent. This trade gave the route its alternative names, such as \"Studevejen\" (Cattle Way) in Danish and \"Ochsenweg\" (Oxen Way) in German. Therefore control of the Danevirke, through which the H\u00e6rvejen ran, was of immense financial significance. Whoever controlled the gates of Danevirke also controlled the trade along the H\u00e6rvejen, giving them access to substantial wealth.\nThe Early Middle Ages.\nAfter approximately 350 to 400 years of Danes being the sole inhabitants north of the Eider, the Frisians arrived in two waves, the first of which occurred in the 800s. They came from Frisia and initially settled on the islands of Heligoland, Sylt, F\u00f6hr, and Amrum in the southwestern part of Jutland. Later, they expanded to Eiderstedt and the Jutish coastline. These areas eventually became known as North Frisia, though historically, the region was referred to as Uthlande (Outland). In these settlements, the Frisians established fishing and trading stations. The local Danes soon became a minority and, over time, assimilated into the Frisian population. The Frisians contributed to the broader H\u00e6rvejen trade network, with sea routes extending along the Frisian and Dutch coasts, supplying high-quality salt, fish, and other maritime goods. Moreover, they were particularly active in trade with East Anglia in England, where pottery was exchanged in large quantities.\nSaxon Wars.\nNormalcy in the area vanished with the expansion of the Frankish Empire into Saxony from 772 to 804, triggering a generational war on an unprecedented scale for the region. Before this, the Franks had spent nearly 20 years, from the late 600s to the early 700s, subjugating and converting the Frisian Kingdom. Their primary opponent was the formidable Frisian king Redbad, who fiercely resisted the Franks until his death. Now, the Frisians' neighbors, the Saxons, faced Frankish expansion. The \"casus belli\" was a Saxon raid on the church in Deventer in January of 772. This conflict, fueled by Charlemagne's desire to conquer the Saxons and convert them from their belief in the Germanic pantheon to Christianity, used the Deventer raid as a pretext to wage a war that would ultimately reshape the political and cultural landscape of what would later become Holstein forever. Throughout 18 campaigns, carried out in three phases over 32 years, Charlemagne aimed to subdue the Saxons and forcibly convert them to Christianity, in what became known as the Saxon Wars. In retaliation for the raid on the church in Deventer, Charlemagne ordered his troops to destroy the holy pillar Irminsul, near Paderborn in either 772 or 773\u2014a notorious act that sent shockwaves throughout the Germanic pagan world. It has been postulated that Irminsul symbolised Yggdrasil Ash - the world tree. Charlemagne then destroyed all Saxon settlements up to the Wesser river. After defeating the Saxons and securing hostages, he turned his attention to northern Italy. \nFor centuries, the Danes and Saxons had regarded each other as kindred peoples, sharing the same belief in the Germanic pantheon and frequently intermarrying, especially among the elite. Thus, the defeated Saxon warleader Widukind sought refuge with his father-in-law, Danish king Sigfred. The \"Royal Frankish Annals\" mentions that Widukind received substantial aid from Sigfred, though the exact nature of this aid is not explicitly stated. However, the chronicles do note that Sigfred and Charlemagne brokered a peace agreement some years later, indicating that Sigfred, upon hearing Widukind's plea, may have mustered his army and joined the war on the side of the Saxons. In response to the Danes' involvement in the war, Charlemagne seems to have recruited the Obotrites by promising them the Saxon portion of Holstein. This alliance with Charlemagne shifted the balance of power in the region. In 782, after another defeat of the Saxons, Charlemagne ordered the mass execution of 4,500 Saxons, an atrocity that became known as the Massacre of Verden. Following this brutal act, Charlemagne was nicknamed the \"Butcher of Saxons\" or \"Saxonslaughterer.\"\nIn 796, despite Saxony being fully under Frankish rule, the Saxons rose once more, supported by the Danes. The rebellion was triggered by the forced conscription of Saxons for the Frankish wars against the Avars. Moreover, Charlemagne, in alliance with the Obotrites, planned to subjugate the Danes, now led by King Gudfred Sigfredson. However, Gudfred struck first. He expanded the Danevirke, assembled a fleet, mustered an army, and launched attacks on the Obotrites and later Frankish Frisia. But he was slain, either by one of his huscarls or possibly his own illegitimate son, on the Frisian campaign. The new Danish king, Hemming, Gudfred's nephew, initiated peace talks, which resulted in the Treaty of Heiligen in 810. The treaty established the Danish border at the Eider River. Charlemagne retained Saxony, including Holstein, and established the Limes Saxoniae as a border with the Obotrites. This agreement established firm boundaries between the Franks, Obotrites, and Danes, securing peace in the region.\nDuchies in the Danish realm.\nBetween 500 and 1200, Schleswig was an integral part of Denmark, but during the 12th century, Duke Abel of Schlewig came into conflict with his brother King Eric IV. Abel managed to gain autonomy from his brother, making Schleswig an autonomous duchy. Later, Abel had Eric assassinated and seized the throne. Despite this, Schleswig remained an autonomous duchy within the Kingdom, setting the stage for future conflicts.\nBeginning in 1460, both the Duchy of Schleswig and Duchy of Holstein were ruled together by the Danish king, who acted as the duke of both regions. Holstein, being a duchy within the Holy Roman Empire, created a situation where the Danish king was sovereign of Denmark but also a duke within the Holy Roman Empire. Both were ruled for several centuries by the kings of Denmark. In 1721, all of Schleswig was united into a single duchy under the king of Denmark, and the great powers of Europe confirmed in an international treaty that all future kings of Denmark should automatically become dukes of Schleswig: consequently, Schleswig would always follow the order of succession that applied in the Kingdom of Denmark. \nAfter the Protestant Reformation, German was established as the language of commerce, administration, education, and clergy in Schleswig despite the population being ethnically Danish. This was because Schleswig was managed by the German Chancellery in Kiel, which was later renamed the Schleswig-Holstein Chancellery in 1806. Therefore, Danes were sent to Kiel for their education instead of Copenhagen, where they received their education in German rather than their native Danish. As a result, Danish students, future administrators, clergy, and educators were taught in German and continued to use the language throughout their professional lives.\nIn 1814, mandatory schooling was instituted, and it was taught in German. This created generations of Danish children who learned German from an early age. Their schooling was conducted in German, they heard sermons in German, and when they grew up, their interactions with the administration and business were conducted in German. Additionally, if Danes didn't learn German, they couldn't communicate with the administration, which often cared little if the citizens were able to understand them. Therefore, if the Danes weren't able to speak German, they were effectively frozen out of any official matters. As a result, a language shift slowly began forming in South Schleswig and gradually spread north, which alarmed Copenhagen. The Danish authorities started taking countermeasures to halt the language shift by banning German in all official matters in Schleswig, which only served to create tensions between Danes and Germans. This language strife significantly contributed to shaping the inhabitants' national sentiments during a time of national unrest in Europe. It is also during this period that we see surname changes, such as from J\u00f8rgensen to J\u00fcrgensen or Nielsen to Nilsen, in South Schleswig. By the time of the First Schleswig War, one-third of Schleswig and half of South Schleswig spoke German as their first language. By the time of the Second Schleswig War in 1864, half of Schleswig and the vast majority of South Schleswig spoke German as their first language.\nSchleswig-Holstein Question.\nIn the 19th century, fueled by nationalism, both Danes and Germans claimed Schleswig-Holstein. The Germans wanted both Schleswig and Holstein to separate from Denmark and join the German Confederation, invoking the Treaty of Ribe stating that the two duchies should stay \"Forever Undivided\". The Danes, on the other hand, furthered the Eider Policy (), stating that the natural Danish border was the Eider (river) as first recognised in the Treaty of Heiligen. Therefore, the Danes sought to reintegrate Schleswig into the Kingdom of Denmark, reversing the separation created by King Abel, while also granting Holstein independence to join the German Confederation as a sovereign entity. The resulting long-term political and territorial dispute was known as the Schleswig-Holstein Question. Holstein was entirely German-speaking, while Schleswig was predominantly Danish-speaking until the late 1700s and early 1800s. During this period, a linguistic shift began in southern Schleswig, transitioning from Danish to German. This meant that Schleswig was linguistically divided with a Danish-speaking north and a German-speaking south.\nIn 1848, King Frederick VII of Denmark declared that he would grant Denmark a liberal constitution and the immediate goal of the Danish national movement was to ensure that this constitution would give rights to all Danes, i.e. not only to those in the Kingdom of Denmark, but also to Danes (and Germans) living in Schleswig. Furthermore, they demanded protection for the Danish language in Schleswig (the dominant language in almost a quarter of Schleswig had changed from Danish to German since the beginning of the 19th century). A liberal constitution for Holstein was not seriously considered in Copenhagen, since it was well known that the political \u00e9lite of Holstein were more conservative than Copenhagen's. Representatives of German-minded Schleswig-Holsteiners demanded that Schleswig and Holstein be unified and allowed its own constitution and that Schleswig join Holstein as a member of the German Confederation. These demands were rejected by the Danish government in 1848, and the Germans of Holstein and Southern Schleswig rebelled. \nFirst Schleswig War.\nThis began the First Schleswig War (1848\u201351). Against unbelievable odds, Denmark emerged victorious, managing to politically outmaneuver the German alliance by garnering support from the British Empire, the Russian Empire and the Second French Empire while defeating the Germans at the Battles of Bov, the Dybb\u00f8l, the Fredericia and Isted. However, under pressure from the Great Powers, led by Tsar Alexander II, who had forced Prussia and Austria out of Denmark, the Danes were not permitted to reintegrate Schleswig into Denmark. Alexander thereby sought to preserve the existing European order, per the principles established by the Concert of Europe. This led to the signing of the 1852 London Protocol, which failed to provide a solution to the issue and merely upheld the status quo.\nSecond Schleswig War.\nIn 1863, conflict broke out again when Frederick VII died without legitimate issue. According to the order of succession of Denmark and Schleswig, the crowns of both Denmark and Schleswig would pass to Duke Christian of Gl\u00fccksburg, who became Christian IX. The transmission of the duchy of Holstein to the head of the (German-oriented) branch of the Danish royal family, the House of Augustenborg, was more controversial. The separation of the two duchies was challenged by the Augustenborg heir, who claimed, as in 1848, to be the rightful heir of both Schleswig and Holstein. A common constitution for Denmark and Schleswig was promulgated in November 1863, which was a breach of the 1852 London Protocol. This left Denmark politically isolated and led to the Second Schleswig War, with Prussia and Austria invading once again. This was the Second War of Schleswig. Denmark achieved some initial victories at the Battles of Mysunde, and Sankelmark, but these successes were short-lived. The Austrians defeated the Danes at the K\u00f6nigsh\u00fcgel and Vejle. However, it was the Prussians who decided the war by decisively winning the pivotal Battles of Dybb\u00f8l and Als. \nBritish attempts to mediate in the London Conference of 1864 failed. With the peace Treaty of Vienna (1864), Denmark was forced to cede Schleswig, Holstein, and Lauenburg to Prussia and Austria. Prussia wished to annex the conquered territories, but Austria insisted they be held as condominiums. This disagreement led to the 1865 Gastein Convention, which, despite its being the defence of the German-speaking Schleswig-Holsteiners' wish to remain unified, granted Schleswig and Lauenburg to Prussia and Holstein to Austria. However, this situation did not last long.\nAustro-Prussian War and Province of Prussia.\nIn 1866, the Austro-Prussian War broke out, in which Prussia quickly defeated Austria and its allies. In the 1866 Peace of Prague, Prussia gained Holstein in addition to Schleswig and Lauenburg. Contrary to the hopes of German Schleswig-Holsteiners, the area did not gain its independence, but was annexed to Prussia, becoming the Province of Schleswig-Holstein in 1868; Lauenburg remained a separate entity until it was incorporated as in 1876. \nThe Peace of Prague also led to the dissolution of the loose (confederal) Austrian-led German Confederation and the establishment of the far more integrated (federal) Prussian-led North German Confederation, of which Schleswig-Holstein was now part as a Prussian Province; the North German Confederation became the German Empire in 1871.\nSection five of the Peace of Prague had also stipulated that the people of Northern Schleswig would be consulted in a referendum on whether to remain under Prussian rule or return to Danish rule. This condition, however, was never fulfilled by Prussia. During the decades of Prussian rule within the German Empire, authorities attempted a Germanisation policy in the northern part of Schleswig, which remained predominantly Danish. The period also meant increased industrialisation of Schleswig-Holstein and the use of Kiel and Flensburg as important Imperial German Navy locations. The northernmost part and the west coast of the province saw a wave of emigration to America, while some Danes of North Schleswig emigrated to Denmark.\nPlebiscite in 1920.\nAfter the defeat of Germany in World War I, the Allied powers arranged a plebiscite in northern and central Schleswig. The plebiscite was conducted under the auspices of an international commission, which designated two voting zones to cover the northern and south-central parts of Schleswig. Steps were taken to also create a third zone covering a southern area, but zone III was cancelled again and never voted, as the Danish government asked the commission not to expand the plebiscite to this area.\nIn zone I covering Northern Schleswig (10 February 1920), 75% voted for reunification with Denmark and 25% voted for Germany. In zone II covering central Schleswig (14 March 1920), the results were reversed; 80% voted for Germany and just 20% for Denmark. Only minor areas on the island of F\u00f6hr showed a Danish majority, and the rest of the Danish vote was primarily in the town of Flensburg. On 15 June 1920, Northern Schleswig officially returned to Danish rule. The Danish/German border was the only one of the borders imposed on Germany by the Treaty of Versailles after World War I that was never challenged by Adolf Hitler.\nIn 1937, the Nazis passed the so-called Greater Hamburg Act (), where the nearby Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg was expanded, to encompass towns that had formerly belonged to the Prussian province of Schleswig-Holstein. To compensate Prussia for these losses (and partly because Hitler had a personal dislike for L\u00fcbeck), the 711-year-long independence of the Hansestadt L\u00fcbeck came to an end, and almost all its territory was incorporated into Schleswig-Holstein, along with the Oldenburg exclave centred on Eutin (for historical reasons known as ).\nState of Federal Germany.\nAfter World War II, the Prussian province of Schleswig-Holstein came under British occupation. On 23 August 1946, the military government abolished the province and reconstituted it as a separate \"Land\".\nOn 9 September 1946, the British and Soviets offered Denmark South Schleswig, in the Septembernote. In this note, they gave Denmark carte blanche on how to deal with the German-speaking South Schleswigers, whether to integrate them into the Danish state or to forcibly expel them from South Schleswig, as was being done to Germans in Eastern Europe. Denmark's then Prime Minister, the Liberal Party's Knud Kristensen, enthusiastically accepted the offer of South Schleswig reunification with Denmark. A survey showed that 75% of the Danish population supported the incorporation, 500,000 signatures had been collected in support of it, and the Danish South Schleswig Association had sent the government a formal request for incorporation. However, the dominating Social Liberal Party feared that Denmark might again face destructive wars like the two Schleswig Wars once Germany recovered from World War II. Given that the Germans had conquered Denmark in six hours during the German invasion of Denmark, they believed Denmark would not stand a chance in such a scenario. Therefore, they pressured the Prime Minister to call for new elections, where the Liberal Party did not secure enough votes to form a government. The Social Democrats won the election with a minority government and could not gather a strong enough mandate for the incorporation of South Schleswig. This outcome created outrage within the Danish population and was considered a scandal. \nDue to the forced migrations of Germans between 1944 and 1950, Schleswig-Holstein took in almost a million refugees after the war, increasing its population by 33%. \nA pro-Danish political movement arose in Schleswig, with transfer of the area to Denmark as an ultimate goal. This was supported neither by the British occupation administration nor the Danish government. In 1955, the German and Danish governments issued the Bonn-Copenhagen Declarations confirming the rights of the ethnic minorities on both sides of the border. Conditions between the nationalities have since been stable and generally respectful.\nGeography.\nSchleswig-Holstein lies on the base of Jutland Peninsula between the North Sea and the Baltic Sea. Strictly speaking, \"Schleswig\" refers to the German Southern Schleswig ( or \"Landesteil Schleswig\", ), whereas Northern Schleswig is in Denmark (South Jutland County, Region of Southern Denmark). The state of Schleswig-Holstein further consists of Holstein, as well as Lauenburg and the formerly independent city of L\u00fcbeck.\nSchleswig-Holstein borders Denmark (Southern Denmark) to the north, the North Sea to the west, the Baltic Sea to the east, and the German states of Lower Saxony, Hamburg, and Mecklenburg-Vorpommern to the south. In the western part of the state, the lowlands have virtually no hills. The North Frisian Islands, as well as almost all of Schleswig-Holstein's North Sea coast, form the Schleswig-Holstein Wadden Sea National Park (\"Nationalpark Schleswig-Holsteinisches Wattenmeer\"), which is the largest national park in Central Europe.\nThe Baltic Sea coast in the east of Schleswig-Holstein is marked by bays, fjords, and cliff lines. Rolling hills (the highest elevation is the Bungsberg at ) and many lakes are found, especially in the eastern part of Holstein called the Holstein Switzerland and the former Duchy of Lauenburg (\"Herzogtum Lauenburg\"). The longest river besides the Elbe is the Eider. Schleswig-Holstein has the lowest quota of forest covered area, it is only 11.0% (national average 32.0%), which is even lower than in the city-states of Hamburg and Bremen.\nThe German Islands of Sylt, F\u00f6hr, Pellworm, Amrum, Heligoland and Fehmarn are part of Schleswig-Holstein, with the latter being the largest and the only Island of Schleswig-Holstein located on the east coast. Heligoland is Germany's only high-sea island.\nAdministration.\nAdministrative Division.\nSchleswig-Holstein is divided into 11 \"Kreise\" (Districts) and four \"Kreisfreie St\u00e4dte\" (Urban Districts).\nLegislature.\nSchleswig-Holstein has its own parliament and government, which are located in the state capital city of Kiel.\nExecutive Branch.\nThe Minister-President of Schleswig-Holstein is elected by the Landtag of Schleswig-Holstein.\nRecent elections.\nState elections were held on 8 May 2022. The current government is a coalition of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and The Greens, led by Minister-President Daniel G\u00fcnther.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nSchleswig-Holstein has an aging population. Since 1972, there has been a decrease in the natural rate of population change. In 2016, the total fertility rate reached 1.61, the highest value in 40 years (the average value being 1.4). In 2016, there were 25,420 births and 33,879 deaths, resulting in a natural decrease of \u22128,459. \nReligion.\nThe region has been strongly Protestant since the time of the Protestant Reformation. It is proportionally the most Protestant of the sixteen modern states. In 2018, members of the Protestant Church in Germany made up 44.6% of the population, while members of the Catholic Church comprised 6.1%.\n49.3% either adhere to other religions or disclaim any practising religious identity.\nForeigners.\nLargest groups of foreign residents by 31 December 2023 \nCulture.\nSchleswig-Holstein combines Danish, Frisian, and German aspects of culture. The castles and manors in the countryside are the best example for this tradition; some dishes like R\u00f8dgr\u00f8d (, literal English \"red grits\" or \"red groats\") are also shared, as well as surnames such as Hansen.\nThe most important festivals are the Kiel Week, Schleswig-Holstein Musik Festival, an annual classic music festival all over the state, and the L\u00fcbeck Nordic Film Days, an annual film festival for movies from Scandinavian countries, held in L\u00fcbeck. The Kiel Week is an annual event, except for 2020 and 2021 due to the COVID19-Pandemic. It took place again in June 2022. The annual Wacken Open Air festival is considered to be the largest heavy metal rock festival in the world.\nSymbols.\nThe coat of arms shows the symbols of the two duchies united in Schleswig-Holstein, i.e., the two lions for Schleswig and the leaf of nettle for Holstein. Supposedly, Otto von Bismarck decreed that the two lions were to face the nettle because of the discomfort to their bottoms, which would have resulted if the lions faced away from it.\nGovernment agencies of Schleswig-Holstein use a logo showing a stylized version of the Schleswig Lions and the Holstein nettle combined with the abbreviation of Schleswig-Holstein, \"SH\". Written either below or to the right of the lion and the nettle is \"Schleswig-Holstein\" below which either the Name of the agency using the logo is shown or the motto \"Der echte Norden\" (Germany's true North).\nThe motto of Schleswig-Holstein is \"Up ewich ungedeelt\" (Middle Low German: \"Forever undivided\", modern High German: \"Auf ewig ungeteilt\"). It goes back to the Treaty of Ribe (Danish: Ribe H\u00e5ndf\u00e6stning German: Handfeste von Ripen) in 1460. Ripen (Ribe) is a historical small town in Northern Schleswig, nowadays Denmark.\nThe anthem from 1844 is called \"Wanke nicht, mein Vaterland\" (\"Don't falter, my fatherland\"), but it is usually referred to with its first line \"Schleswig-Holstein meerumschlungen\" (i.e., \"Schleswig-Holstein embraced by the seas\") or \"Schleswig-Holstein-Lied\" (Schleswig-Holstein song). The old city of L\u00fcbeck is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\nFood and drink.\nThe distinctive point of the cuisine is a combination of sweetness with a taste contrast, like sour or salty. These combinations are also described as \"broken sweetness,\" which is especially present in sweet-sour dishes.\nTypical dishes are:\nLanguages.\nThe official language of Schleswig-Holstein is German. In addition, Low German, Danish and North Frisian are recognized minority languages. Historically, Low German (in Holstein and Southern Schleswig), Danish (in Schleswig), and North Frisian (in Western Schleswig) were widely spoken in Schleswig-Holstein. During the language change in the 19th century some Danish and North Frisian dialects in Southern Schleswig were replaced by Standard German.\nLow German is still used in many parts of the state. Missingsch, a Low German dialect with heavy High German (Standard German) influence, is commonly spoken informally throughout the state, while a mixed language Petuh (mixture of High German and Danish) is used in and around Flensburg. Danish is used by the Danish minority in Southern Schleswig, and North Frisian is spoken by the North Frisians of the North Sea Coast and the Northern Frisian Islands in Southern Schleswig. The North Frisian dialect called Heligolandic (\"Halunder\") is spoken on the island of Heligoland.\nAs is the case throughout Germany, High German, introduced in the 16th century, has come to steadily replace local dialects for official purposes, and is today the predominant language of media, law, and legislature. It is spoken by virtually all inhabitants in formal situations. Since the end of World War II and the widespread adoption of TV, radio, and other mass media, it has gradually come to supplant local dialects in urban areas as well.\nEconomy.\nThe Gross domestic product (GDP) of the state was 62.7 billion euros in 2018, accounting for 1.9% of German economic output. GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was 30,400 euros or 101% of the EU27 average in the same year. The GDP per employee was 95% of the EU average. The GDP per capita was the lowest of all states in West Germany. In 2017, Schleswig-Holstein had an export surplus for the first time since 1989: export 22.6 billion euros/ import 20.8 billion euros.\nEnergy.\nSchleswig-Holstein is a leader in the country's growing renewable energy industry. In 2014, Schleswig-Holstein became the first German state to cover 100% of its electric power demand with renewable energy sources (chiefly wind 70%, solar 3.8%, and biomass 8.3%). By 2023, according to Schleswig-Holstein Netz, renewable energy sources were providing 204% of Schleswig-Holstein's electricity demand (the 104% surplus are exports).\nThe largest German oil field Mittelplate is located in the North Sea off the Dithmarsch coast and connected with a refinery in Hemmingstedt and chemical plants in Brunsb\u00fcttel via pipeline. It produces ca. 1.4 million tonnes of oil annually.\nNuclear power.\nThere were three nuclear power plants in Schleswig-Holstein: Kr\u00fcmmel, Brunsb\u00fcttel, and Brokdorf. The last operating plant in Schleswig-Holstein, the Brokdorf-plant was shut down on new-years eve 2021. There is also a nuclear research center known \"Helmholtz-Zentrum Geesthacht\" (rebranded as Hereon) with 2 research reactors, located right next to the Kr\u00fcmmel plant.\nDuring the 1990s, ten more cases of leukemia among children than were expected were identified in Elbmarsch, near the Kr\u00fcmmel plant. Anti-nuclear activists believed it was due to the nuclear plant, which led to several investigations. The reported discovery of small spherical beads of nuclear material in the area led to further concern, as well as the presence of minute amounts of plutonium in the Elbe. The origins of the nuclear material were disputed, with one report determining them not to be that of the Kr\u00fcmmel plant. Another report claimed that they may have come from an undisclosed fire in 1986, however, this theory has been questioned as it would have required a substantial government cover-up. The Chernobyl disaster has also been suggested as a source, though it is considered unlikely. The probable source of the material, especially in the Elbe, is nuclear reprocessing plants in France. A 2010 report exonerated the nuclear power plants on the Elbe as the cause of contamination. Further doubt was cast on the nature of the supposed beads of nuclear material, with a Federal commission chastising the original commission that claimed to have discovered the beads. The exact cause of the increased leukemia cases remains unknown, and could be due to other environmental factors, or even by chance.\nThe nuclear plants have further been questioned as a source of the cases due to comparison to the Savannah River Site in the United States. Despite the release of radiation at the Savannah River Site, there is no increase in cases of leukemia around it. Alternative hypotheses for the cause of the cases have included electromagnetic fields, parental radiation exposure before conception, other carcinogens, and benzene exposure; however, none have been supported by the existing evidence. Intriguingly, a larger case-control study in Lower Saxony found a correlation between the \"untrained immune system\" (as judged as contact with other children, vaccinations, etc.) and leukemia risk, suggested that an immature immune system that has not been challenged is at greater risk for developing malignancy, possibly secondary to an undetermined environment factor.\nTourism.\nLocated between the North Sea and the Baltic Sea, Schleswig-Holstein is also a popular tourist destination in Germany. Its islands, beaches, and cities attract millions of tourists every year. It has the second highest tourism intensity per local among the German states, after Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, but in absolute value it is rank 6th and only 1/3 of top destination Bavaria. According to a ruling by the Federal Administrative Court, everyone has the right to free access to the beach. Nevertheless, most of the seaside resorts kept cashing in (2-\u20ac3 /day/person).\nAgriculture.\n63% of land in Schleswig-Holstein (990 403 ha) is used for agriculture (national average 47%).\nCultivated crops:\nThere are some special cultivation regions:\nAnimal husbandry.\nThe dairy and cattle farming in connection with fodder cultivation is mainly concentrated on the marshland and the bordering Geest areas. In 2020, around 1 million cattle, including 360,000 dairy cows, were counted in Schleswig-Holstein, ranking 4th among the German states. Livestock is continuously declining.\nSchleswig-Holstein is home to the most productive dairy cattle: Holsteins, which produce an average of per year of milk. It is now the main dairy cow around the world.\nPig breeding is mainly found in the Schleswig-Holstein Uplands. In principle, Schleswig-Holstein is one of the regions with relatively few pigs (a total of around 1.6 million; in comparison, Lower Saxony: over 8 million). Poultry and sheep are also of little importance in animal husbandry. Schleswig-Holstein had Europe's largest snake farm in Uetersen with over 600 venomous reptiles, but it closed in 2019.\nFishing and Aquaculture.\nTotal production from fishing in North and Baltic Seas was 40 780 tonnes in 2019, ca. 1/3 German production. In the Baltic Sea total production amounted to 10377 tonnes (2019), of which 5432 tonnes of sprat, 2568 tonnes of flatfish and 1190 tonnes of cod.\nIn the North Sea the numbers were 19,487 tonnes of mussels, 3560 tonnes of North Sea shrimp, 1166 tonnes of herring and 7062 other fishes. One important aquaculture product is mussels, 16864 tonnes. Inland fishing and aquaculture are not significant, with 221 and 250 tonnes in 2019, respectively.\nCompanies.\nThe largest company headquarters in Schleswig-Holstein with annual sales over 1 billion euros are:\nThe unemployment rate stood at 5.0% in October 2021.\nTransport.\nKiel Canal.\nThe most important transport way in Schleswig-Holstein is Kiel Canal, which connect Brunsb\u00fcttel on North Sea with Kiel on Baltic Sea. Total cargo of ships reach peaks in 2007 and 2012, after that it continuous decline with 73.8 million tonnes in 2020.\nPorts.\nThe state has 46 public ports and landing stages, four of which fulfill international transit functions: Kiel, L\u00fcbeck / Travem\u00fcnde and Puttgarden on the Baltic Sea, Brunsb\u00fcttel on the North Sea. Kiel and L\u00fcbeck are also important for freight traffic to Scandinavia and Eastern Europe. L\u00fcbeck-Travem\u00fcnde and Kiel are also important ferry and cruise ports. Puttgarden is the German port of the Vogelfluglinie to Denmark. Brunsb\u00fcttel is a significant port for bulk goods and also serves as a foundation for the offshore wind energy industry.\nAir.\nL\u00fcbeck Airport and Sylt Airport are currently the only two airports which are operating in Schleswig-Holstein with the nearest international airport being Hamburg Airport which is located 89 km south of Kiel.\nEducation.\nGeneral Education.\nIn Schleswig-Holstein, the school education system begins with a four-year primary school, called \"Grundschule\". Compulsory education applies to all children who turn six years old by June 30th of the current calendar year. In addition to the four-year primary school, the secondary level (grades 5 to 10), equivalent to middle school, consists of a two-tier school system comprising \"Gemeinschaftsschulen\" and \"Gymnasium\". At all \"Gemeinschaftsschulen\", Mittlere Reife can be obtained. Currently, 44 comprehensive schools also offer three additional years of highschool education, where students can complete the Abitur (higher education entrance qualification) after a total of 13 school years.\nMost \"Gymnasium\" in Schleswig-Holstein offer a nine-year educational track, with only one \"Gymnasium\" leading to the Abitur in eight years. Three of the Gymnasien offer both three-year and two-year pathways for the Abitur.\nThe third option to obtain the Abitur is through the '\"Berufliches Gymnasium\"' (vocational gymnasium). At the 28 \"berufliches Gymnasium\" in Schleswig-Holstein, students \u2013 unlike in the profile upper stage of regular \"Gymnasium\" and \"Gemeinschaftsschulen\" \u2013 have the opportunity to choose a specific subject area. The offered disciplines include agricultural economics, nutrition, technology, economics, as well as health and social care. Admission requirements for the \"berufliches Gymnasium\" include above-average completion of the \"Mittlere Reife\".Currently, around one-fifth of the high school graduates in Schleswig-Holstein graduate from \"berufliches Gymnasium\".\nAcademic Education.\nThere are three universities in Kiel (classical, budget 167.1 M\u20ac), L\u00fcbeck (medicine, budget 80.8 M\u20ac) and Flensburg (pedagogical, 37.4 M\u20ac). Six public Universities of Applied Sciences exist in Wedel, Altenholz, Flensburg, Heide, Kiel, and L\u00fcbeck. There is the Conservatory in L\u00fcbeck and the Muthesius Academy of Fine Arts in Kiel. There are also three private institutions of higher learning.\nHonorary citizens.\nAs of 2016, seven persons had been made honorary citizens of Schleswig-Holstein:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is abundant, multivalent and nonmetallic. Under normal conditions, sulfur atoms form cyclic octatomic molecules with the chemical formula S8. Elemental sulfur is a bright yellow, crystalline solid at room temperature.\nSulfur is the tenth most abundant element by mass in the universe and the fifth most common on Earth. Though sometimes found in pure, native form, sulfur on Earth usually occurs as sulfide and sulfate minerals. Being abundant in native form, sulfur was known in ancient times, being mentioned for its uses in ancient India, ancient Greece, China, and ancient Egypt. Historically and in literature sulfur is also called brimstone, which means \"burning stone\". Almost all elemental sulfur is produced as a byproduct of removing sulfur-containing contaminants from natural gas and petroleum. The greatest commercial use of the element is the production of sulfuric acid for sulfate and phosphate fertilizers, and other chemical processes. Sulfur is used in matches, insecticides, and fungicides. Many sulfur compounds are odoriferous, and the smells of odorized natural gas, skunk scent, bad breath, grapefruit, and garlic are due to organosulfur compounds. Hydrogen sulfide gives the characteristic odor to rotting eggs and other biological processes.\nSulfur is an essential element for all life, almost always in the form of organosulfur compounds or metal sulfides. Amino acids (two proteinogenic: cysteine and methionine, and many other non-coded: cystine, taurine, etc.) and two vitamins (biotin and thiamine) are organosulfur compounds crucial for life. Many cofactors also contain sulfur, including glutathione, and iron\u2013sulfur proteins. Disulfides, S\u2013S bonds, confer mechanical strength and insolubility of the (among others) protein keratin, found in outer skin, hair, and feathers. Sulfur is one of the core chemical elements needed for biochemical functioning and is an elemental macronutrient for all living organisms.\nCharacteristics.\nPhysical properties.\nSulfur forms several polyatomic molecules. The best-known allotrope is octasulfur, cyclo-S8. The point group of cyclo-S8 is D4d and its dipole moment is 0 D. Octasulfur is a soft, bright-yellow solid that is odorless. It melts at , and boils at . At , below its melting temperature, cyclo-octasulfur begins slowly changing from \u03b1-octasulfur to the \u03b2-polymorph. The structure of the S8 ring is virtually unchanged by this phase transition, which affects the intermolecular interactions. Cooling molten sulfur freezes at , as it predominantly consists of the \u03b2-S8 molecules. Between its melting and boiling temperatures, octasulfur changes its allotrope again, turning from \u03b2-octasulfur to \u03b3-sulfur, again accompanied by a lower density but increased viscosity due to the formation of polymers. At higher temperatures, the viscosity decreases as depolymerization occurs. Molten sulfur assumes a dark red color above . The density of sulfur is about 2\u00a0g/cm3, depending on the allotrope; all of the stable allotropes are excellent electrical insulators.\nThe sublimation of sulfur becomes noticeable more or less between and , and occurs readily in boiling water at .\nSulfur is insoluble in water but soluble in carbon disulfide and, to a lesser extent, in other nonpolar organic solvents, such as benzene and toluene. Sulfur has been found to be soluble in super-critical carbon dioxide.\nChemical properties.\nUnder normal conditions, sulfur hydrolyzes very slowly to mainly form hydrogen sulfide and sulfuric acid:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;\nThe reaction involves adsorption of protons onto S8 clusters, followed by disproportionation into the reaction products.\nThe second, fourth and sixth ionization energies of sulfur are 2252\u00a0kJ/mol, 4556\u00a0kJ/mol and 8495.8\u00a0kJ/mol, respectively. The composition of reaction products of sulfur with oxidants (and its oxidation state) depends on whether releasing of reaction energy overcomes these thresholds. Applying catalysts and/or supply of external energy may vary sulfur's oxidation state and the composition of reaction products. While reaction between sulfur and oxygen under normal conditions gives sulfur dioxide (oxidation state +4), formation of sulfur trioxide (oxidation state +6) requires a temperature of and presence of a catalyst.\nIn reactions with elements of lesser electronegativity, it reacts as an oxidant and forms sulfides, where it has oxidation state \u22122.\nSulfur reacts with nearly all other elements except noble gases, even with the notoriously unreactive metal iridium (yielding iridium disulfide). Some of those reactions require elevated temperatures.\nAllotropes.\nSulfur forms over 30 solid allotropes, more than any other element. Besides S8, several other rings are known. Removing one atom from the crown gives S7, which is of a deeper yellow than S8. HPLC analysis of \"elemental sulfur\" reveals an equilibrium mixture of mainly S8, but with S7 and small amounts of S6. Larger rings have been prepared, including S12 and S18.\nAmorphous or \"plastic\" sulfur is produced by rapid cooling of molten sulfur\u2014for example, by pouring it into cold water. X-ray crystallography studies show that the amorphous form may have a helical structure with eight atoms per turn. The long coiled polymeric molecules make the brownish substance elastic, and in bulk it has the feel of crude rubber. This form is metastable at room temperature and gradually reverts to the crystalline molecular allotrope, which is no longer elastic. This process happens over a matter of hours to days, but can be rapidly catalyzed.\nIsotopes.\nSulfur has 23 known isotopes, four of which are stable: 32S (), 33S (), 34S (), and 36S (). Other than 35S, with a half-life of 87.37 days, the radioactive isotopes of sulfur have half-lives less than 3\u00a0hours.\nThe preponderance of 32S is explained by its production in the alpha process (one of the main classes of nuclear fusion reactions) in exploding stars. Other stable sulfur isotopes are produced in the bypass processes related with 34Ar , and their composition depends on the type of a stellar explosion. For example, proportionally more 33S comes from novae than from supernovae.\nIt has been found that the proportion of the two most abundant sulfur isotopes 32S and 34S varies in different samples by a surprising large amount. Determination of the isotope ratio (\u03b434S) in the samples indicates their chemical history, and with support of other methods, it allows to age-date the samples, estimate temperature of equilibrium between ore and water, determine pH and oxygen fugacity, identify the activity of sulfate-reducing bacteria in the time of formation of the sample, or suggest the main sources of sulfur in ecosystems. However, there are ongoing discussions over the real reason for the \u03b434S shifts, biological activity or postdeposit alteration.\nFor example, when sulfide minerals are precipitated, isotopic equilibration between solid and liquid may cause small differences in the \u03b434S values of co-genetic minerals. The differences between minerals can be used to estimate the temperature of equilibration. The \u03b413C and \u03b434S of coexisting carbonate minerals and sulfides can be used to determine the pH and oxygen fugacity of the ore-bearing fluid during ore formation.\nScientists measure the sulfur isotopes of minerals in rocks and sediments to study the redox conditions in past oceans. Sulfate-reducing bacteria in marine sediment fractionate sulfur isotopes as they take in sulfate and produce sulfide. Prior to the 2010s, it was thought that sulfate reduction could fractionate sulfur isotopes up to 46 permil and fractionation larger than 46 permil recorded in sediments must be due to disproportionation of sulfur compounds in the sediment. This view has changed since the 2010s as experiments showed that sulfate-reducing bacteria can fractionate to 66 permil. As substrates for disproportionation are limited by the product of sulfate reduction, the isotopic effect of disproportionation should be less than 16 permil in most sedimentary settings.\nIn forest ecosystems, sulfate is derived mostly from the atmosphere; weathering of ore minerals and evaporites contribute some sulfur. Sulfur with a distinctive isotopic composition has been used to identify pollution sources, and enriched sulfur has been added as a tracer in hydrologic studies. Differences in the natural abundances can be used in systems where there is sufficient variation in the 34S of ecosystem components. Rocky Mountain lakes thought to be dominated by atmospheric sources of sulfate have been found to have measurably different 34S values than lakes believed to be dominated by watershed sources of sulfate.\nThe radioactive 35S is formed in cosmic ray spallation of the atmospheric 40Ar. This fact may be used to verify the presence of recent (less than a year old) atmospheric sediments in various materials. This isotope may be obtained artificially in different ways. In practice, the reaction 35Cl + n \u2192 35S + p is used, irradiating potassium chloride with neutrons. The isotope 35S is used in various sulfur-containing compounds as a radioactive tracer for many biological studies, for example, the Hershey-Chase experiment.\nBecause of the weak beta activity of 35S, its compounds are relatively safe as long as they are not ingested or absorbed by the body.\nNatural occurrence.\n32S is created inside massive stars, at a depth where the temperature exceeds 2.5 billion\u00a0K, by the fusion of one nucleus of silicon plus one nucleus of helium. As this nuclear reaction is part of the alpha process that produces elements in abundance, sulfur is the 10th most common element in the universe.\nSulfur, usually as sulfide, is present in many types of meteorites. Ordinary chondrites contain on average 2.1% sulfur, and carbonaceous chondrites may contain as much as 6.6%. It is normally present as troilite (FeS), but there are exceptions, with carbonaceous chondrites containing free sulfur, sulfates and other sulfur compounds. The distinctive colors of Jupiter's volcanic moon Io are attributed to various forms of molten, solid, and gaseous sulfur. In July 2024, elemental sulfur was accidentally discovered to exist on Mars after the Curiosity rover drove over and crushed a rock, revealing sulfur crystals inside it.\nSulfur is the fifth most common element by mass in the Earth. Elemental sulfur can be found near hot springs and volcanic regions in many parts of the world, especially along the Pacific Ring of Fire; such volcanic deposits are mined in Indonesia, Chile, and Japan. These deposits are polycrystalline, with the largest documented single crystal measuring . Historically, Sicily was a major source of sulfur in the Industrial Revolution. Lakes of molten sulfur up to about in diameter have been found on the sea floor, associated with submarine volcanoes, at depths where the boiling point of water is higher than the melting point of sulfur.\nNative sulfur is synthesized by anaerobic bacteria acting on sulfate minerals such as gypsum in salt domes. Significant deposits in salt domes occur along the coast of the Gulf of Mexico, and in evaporites in eastern Europe and western Asia. Native sulfur may be produced by geological processes alone. Fossil-based sulfur deposits from salt domes were once the basis for commercial production in the United States, Russia, Turkmenistan, and Ukraine. Such sources have become of secondary commercial importance, and most are no longer worked but commercial production is still carried out in the Osiek mine in Poland.\nCommon naturally occurring sulfur compounds include the sulfide minerals, such as pyrite (iron sulfide), cinnabar (mercury sulfide), galena (lead sulfide), sphalerite (zinc sulfide), and stibnite (antimony sulfide); and the sulfate minerals, such as gypsum (calcium sulfate), alunite (potassium aluminium sulfate), and barite (barium sulfate). On Earth, just as upon Jupiter's moon Io, elemental sulfur occurs naturally in volcanic emissions, including emissions from hydrothermal vents.\nThe main industrial source of sulfur has become petroleum and natural gas.\nCompounds.\nCommon oxidation states of sulfur range from \u22122 to +6. Sulfur forms stable compounds with all elements except the noble gases.\nElectron transfer reactions.\nSulfur polycations, , and are produced when sulfur is reacted with oxidizing agents in a strongly acidic solution. The colored solutions produced by dissolving sulfur in oleum were first reported as early as 1804 by C.\u00a0F. Bucholz, but the cause of the color and the structure of the polycations involved was only determined in the late 1960s. is deep blue, is yellow and is red.\nReduction of sulfur gives various polysulfides with the formula S\"x\"2-, many of which have been obtained in crystalline form. Illustrative is the production of sodium tetrasulfide:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;\nSome of these dianions dissociate to give radical anions. For instance, gives the blue color of the rock lapis lazuli.\nThis reaction highlights a distinctive property of sulfur: its ability to catenate (bind to itself by formation of chains). Protonation of these polysulfide anions produces the polysulfanes, H2S\"x\", where \"x\" = 2, 3, and 4. Ultimately, reduction of sulfur produces sulfide salts:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;16 Na + S8 \u2192 8 Na2S\nThe interconversion of these species is exploited in the sodium\u2013sulfur battery.\nHydrogenation.\nTreatment of sulfur with hydrogen gives hydrogen sulfide. When dissolved in water, hydrogen sulfide is mildly acidic:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;H2S \u21cc HS\u2212 + H+\nHydrogen sulfide gas and the hydrosulfide anion are extremely toxic to mammals, due to their inhibition of the oxygen-carrying capacity of hemoglobin and certain cytochromes in a manner analogous to cyanide and azide (see below, under \"precautions\").\nCombustion.\nThe two principal sulfur oxides are obtained by burning sulfur:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;S + O2 \u2192 SO2 (sulfur dioxide)\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;2 SO2 + O2 \u2192 2 SO3 (sulfur trioxide)\nMany other sulfur oxides are observed including the sulfur-rich oxides include sulfur monoxide, disulfur monoxide, disulfur dioxides, and higher oxides containing peroxo groups.\nHalogenation.\nSulfur reacts with fluorine to give the highly reactive sulfur tetrafluoride and the highly inert sulfur hexafluoride. Whereas fluorine gives S(IV) and S(VI) compounds, chlorine gives S(II) and S(I) derivatives. Thus, sulfur dichloride, disulfur dichloride, and higher chlorosulfanes arise from the chlorination of sulfur. Sulfuryl chloride and chlorosulfuric acid are derivatives of sulfuric acid; thionyl chloride (SOCl2) is a common reagent in organic synthesis. Bromine also oxidizes sulfur to form sulfur dibromide and disulfur dibromide.\nPseudohalides.\nSulfur oxidizes cyanide and sulfite to give thiocyanate and thiosulfate, respectively.\nMetal sulfides.\nSulfur reacts with many metals. Electropositive metals give polysulfide salts. Copper, zinc, and silver are attacked by sulfur; see tarnishing. Although many metal sulfides are known, most are prepared by high temperature reactions of the elements. Geoscientists also study the isotopes of metal sulfides in rocks and sediment to study environmental conditions in the Earth's past.\nOrganic compounds.\nSome of the main classes of sulfur-containing organic compounds include the following:\nCompounds with carbon\u2013sulfur multiple bonds are uncommon, an exception being carbon disulfide, a volatile colorless liquid that is structurally similar to carbon dioxide. It is used as a reagent to make the polymer rayon and many organosulfur compounds. Unlike carbon monoxide, carbon monosulfide is stable only as an extremely dilute gas, found between solar systems.\nOrganosulfur compounds are responsible for some of the unpleasant odors of decaying organic matter. They are widely known as the odorant in domestic natural gas, garlic odor, and skunk spray, as well as a component of bad breath odor. Not all organic sulfur compounds smell unpleasant at all concentrations: the sulfur-containing monoterpenoid grapefruit mercaptan in small concentrations is the characteristic scent of grapefruit, but has a generic thiol odor at larger concentrations. Sulfur mustard, a potent vesicant, was used in World War\u00a0I as a disabling agent.\nSulfur\u2013sulfur bonds are a structural component used to stiffen rubber, similar to the disulfide bridges that rigidify proteins (see biological below). In the most common type of industrial \"curing\" or hardening and strengthening of natural rubber, elemental sulfur is heated with the rubber to the point that chemical reactions form disulfide bridges between isoprene units of the polymer. This process, patented in 1843, made rubber a major industrial product, especially in automobile tires. Because of the heat and sulfur, the process was named vulcanization, after the Roman god of the forge and volcanism.\nHistory.\nAntiquity.\nAccording to the Ebers Papyrus, a sulfur ointment was used in ancient Egypt to treat granular eyelids. Sulfur was used for fumigation in preclassical Greece; this is mentioned in the \"Odyssey\". Pliny the Elder discusses sulfur in his \"Natural History\", saying that its best-known source is the island of Melos. He mentions its use for fumigation, medicine, and bleaching cloth.\nA natural form of sulfur known as was known in China since the 6th century BC and found in Hanzhong. By the 3rd century, the Chinese had discovered that sulfur could be extracted from pyrite. Chinese Daoists were interested in sulfur's flammability and its reactivity with certain metals, yet its earliest practical uses were found in traditional Chinese medicine. The \"Wujing Zongyao\" of 1044 AD described formulas for Chinese black powder, which is a mixture of potassium nitrate, charcoal, and sulfur.\nEnglish translations of the Christian Bible commonly referred to burning sulfur as \"brimstone\", giving rise to the term \"fire-and-brimstone\" sermons, in which listeners are reminded of the fate of eternal damnation that await the unbelieving and unrepentant. Hell is implied to smell of sulfur.\nIndian alchemists, practitioners of the \"science of chemicals\" (), wrote extensively about the use of sulfur in alchemical operations with mercury, from the eighth century AD onwards. In the tradition, sulfur is called \"the smelly\" (, ).\nEarly European alchemists gave sulfur an alchemical symbol of a triangle atop a cross (\ud83d\udf0d). The variation known as brimstone has a symbol combining a two-barred cross atop a lemniscate (\ud83d\udf0f). In traditional skin treatment, elemental sulfur was used (mainly in creams) to alleviate such conditions as scabies, ringworm, psoriasis, eczema, and acne. The mechanism of action is unknown\u2014though elemental sulfur does oxidize slowly to sulfurous acid, a mild reducing and antibacterial agent.\nModern times.\nSulfur appears in a column of fixed (non-acidic) alkali in a chemical table of 1718. Antoine Lavoisier used sulfur in combustion experiments, writing of some of these in 1777.\nSulfur deposits in Sicily were the dominant source for more than a century. By the late 18th century, about 2,000 tonnes per year of sulfur were imported into Marseille, France, for the production of sulfuric acid for use in the Leblanc process. In industrializing Britain, with the repeal of tariffs on salt in 1824, demand for sulfur from Sicily surged. The increasing British control and exploitation of the mining, refining, and transportation of sulfur, coupled with the failure of this lucrative export to transform Sicily's backward and impoverished economy, led to the Sulfur Crisis of 1840, when King Ferdinand II gave a monopoly of the sulfur industry to a French firm, violating an earlier 1816 trade agreement with Britain. A peaceful solution was eventually negotiated by France.\nIn 1867, elemental sulfur was discovered in underground deposits in Louisiana and Texas. The highly successful Frasch process was developed to extract this resource.\nIn the late 18th century, furniture makers used molten sulfur to produce decorative inlays. Molten sulfur is sometimes still used for setting steel bolts into drilled concrete holes where high shock resistance is desired for floor-mounted equipment attachment points. Pure powdered sulfur was used as a medicinal tonic and laxative.\nSince the advent of the contact process, the majority of sulfur is used to make sulfuric acid for a wide range of uses, particularly fertilizer.\nIn recent times, the main source of sulfur has become petroleum and natural gas. This is due to the requirement to remove sulfur from fuels in order to prevent acid rain, and has resulted in a surplus of sulfur.\nSpelling and etymology.\n\"Sulfur\" is derived from the Latin word ', which was Hellenized to ' in the erroneous belief that the Latin word came from Greek. This spelling was later reinterpreted as representing an /f/ sound and resulted in the spelling \"\", which appears in Latin toward the end of the Classical period. The true Ancient Greek word for sulfur, , \"the\u00eeon\" (from earlier , \"th\u00e9eion\"), is the source of the international chemical prefix \"thio-\". The Modern Standard Greek word for sulfur is \u03b8\u03b5\u03af\u03bf, \"the\u00edo\".\nIn 12th-century Anglo-French, it was '. In the 14th century, the erroneously Hellenized Latin ' was restored in Middle English \"\". By the 15th century, both full Latin spelling variants \"sulfur\" and \"sulphur\" became common in English. The parallel \"f~ph\" spellings continued in Britain until the 19th century, when the word was standardized as \"sulphur\". On the other hand, \"sulfur\" was the form eventually chosen in the United States, though multiple place names (such as White Sulphur Springs) use \"-ph-\". Canada uses both spellings.\nIUPAC adopted the spelling \"sulfur\" in 1990 as did the Nomenclature Committee of the Royal Society of Chemistry in 1992, restoring the spelling \"sulfur\" to Britain. Oxford Dictionaries note that \"in chemistry and other technical uses ... the \"-f-\" spelling is now the standard form for this and related words in British as well as US contexts, and is increasingly used in general contexts as well.\"\nProduction.\nSulfur may be found by itself and historically was usually obtained in this form; pyrite has also been a source of sulfur. In volcanic regions in Sicily, in ancient times, it was found on the surface of the Earth, and the \"Sicilian process\" was used: sulfur deposits were piled and stacked in brick kilns built on sloping hillsides, with airspaces between them. Then, some sulfur was pulverized, spread over the stacked ore and ignited, causing the free sulfur to melt down the hills. Eventually the surface-borne deposits played out, and miners excavated veins that ultimately dotted the Sicilian landscape with labyrinthine mines. Mining was unmechanized and labor-intensive, with pickmen freeing the ore from the rock, and mine-boys or \"carusi\" carrying baskets of ore to the surface, often through a mile or more of tunnels. Once the ore was at the surface, it was reduced and extracted in smelting ovens. The conditions in Sicilian sulfur mines were horrific, prompting Booker T. Washington to write \"I am not prepared just now to say to what extent I believe in a physical hell in the next world, but a sulfur mine in Sicily is about the nearest thing to hell that I expect to see in this life.\" Sulfur is still mined from surface deposits in poorer nations with volcanoes, such as Indonesia, and problems with working conditions still exist.\nElemental sulfur was extracted from salt domes (where it sometimes occurs in nearly pure form) until the late 20th century, when it became a side product of other industrial processes such as in oil refining, in which sulfur is undesirable. As a mineral, native sulfur under salt domes is thought to be a fossil mineral resource, produced by the action of anaerobic bacteria on sulfate deposits. It was removed from such salt-dome mines mainly by the Frasch process. In this method, superheated water was pumped into a native sulfur deposit to melt the sulfur, and then compressed air returned the 99.5% pure melted product to the surface. Throughout the 20th century this procedure produced elemental sulfur that required no further purification. Due to a limited number of such sulfur deposits and the high cost of working them, this process for mining sulfur has not had significant use anywhere in the world since 2002.\nSince then, sulfur has typically been produced from petroleum, natural gas, and related fossil resources, from which it is obtained mainly as hydrogen sulfide. Organosulfur compounds, undesirable impurities in petroleum, may be upgraded by subjecting them to hydrodesulfurization, which cleaves the C\u2013S bonds:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;R-S-R + 2 H2 \u2192 2 RH + H2S\nThe resulting hydrogen sulfide from this process, and also as it occurs in natural gas, is converted into elemental sulfur by the Claus process, which entails oxidation of some hydrogen sulfide to sulfur dioxide and then the comproportionation of the two:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;3 O2 + 2 H2S \u2192 2 SO2 + 2 H2O\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;SO2 + 2 H2S \u2192 3 S + 2 H2O\nDue to the high sulfur content of the Athabasca Oil Sands, stockpiles of elemental sulfur from this process exist throughout Alberta, Canada. Another way of storing sulfur is as a binder for concrete, the resulting product having some desirable properties (see sulfur concrete).\nThe world production of sulfur in 2011 amounted to 69\u00a0million tonnes (Mt), with more than 15 countries contributing more than 1\u00a0Mt each. Countries producing more than 5 Mt are China (9.6), the United States (8.8), Canada (7.1) and Russia (7.1). Production has been slowly increasing from 1900 to 2010; the price was unstable in the 1980s and around 2010.\nApplications.\nSulfuric acid.\nElemental sulfur is used mainly as a precursor to other chemicals. Approximately 85% (1989) is converted to sulfuric acid (H2SO4):\nIn 2010, the United States produced more sulfuric acid than any other inorganic industrial chemical. The principal use for the acid is the extraction of phosphate ores for the production of fertilizer manufacturing. Other applications of sulfuric acid include oil refining, wastewater processing, and mineral extraction.\nOther important sulfur chemistry.\nSulfur reacts directly with methane to give carbon disulfide, which is used to manufacture cellophane and rayon. One of the uses of elemental sulfur is in vulcanization of rubber, where polysulfide chains crosslink organic polymers. Large quantities of sulfites are used to bleach paper and to preserve dried fruit. Many surfactants and detergents (e.g. sodium lauryl sulfate) are sulfate derivatives. Calcium sulfate, gypsum (CaSO4\u00b72H2O) is mined on the scale of 100\u00a0million tonnes each year for use in Portland cement and fertilizers.\nWhen silver-based photography was widespread, sodium and ammonium thiosulfate were widely used as \"fixing agents\". Sulfur is a component of gunpowder (\"black powder\").\nFertilizer.\nAmino acids synthesized by living organisms such as methionine and cysteine contain organosulfur groups (thioester and thiol respectively). The antioxidant glutathione protecting many living organisms against free radicals and oxidative stress also contains organic sulfur. Some crops such as onion and garlic also produce different organosulfur compounds such as \"syn\"-propanethial-\"S\"-oxide responsible of lacrymal irritation (onions), or diallyl disulfide and allicin (garlic). Sulfates, commonly found in soils and groundwaters are often a sufficient natural source of sulfur for plants and bacteria. Atmospheric deposition of sulfur dioxide (SO2) is also a common artificial source (coal combustion) of sulfur for the soils. Under normal circumstances, in most agricultural soils, sulfur is not a limiting nutrient for plants and microorganisms (see Liebig's barrel). However, in some circumstances, soils can be depleted in sulfate, e.g. if this later is leached by meteoric water (rain) or if the requirements in sulfur for some types of crops are high. This explains that sulfur is increasingly recognized and used as a component of fertilizers. The most important form of sulfur for fertilizer is calcium sulfate, commonly found in nature as the mineral gypsum (CaSO4\u00b72H2O). Elemental sulfur is hydrophobic (not soluble in water) and cannot be used directly by plants. Elemental sulfur (ES) is sometimes mixed with bentonite to amend depleted soils for crops with high requirement in organo-sulfur. Over time, oxidation abiotic processes with atmospheric oxygen and soil bacteria can oxidize and convert elemental sulfur to soluble derivatives, which can then be used by microorganisms and plants. Sulfur improves the efficiency of other essential plant nutrients, particularly nitrogen and phosphorus. Biologically produced sulfur particles are naturally hydrophilic due to a biopolymer coating and are easier to disperse over the land in a spray of diluted slurry, resulting in a faster uptake by plants.\nThe plant requirement for sulfur equals or exceeds the requirement for phosphorus. It is an essential nutrient for plant growth, root nodule formation of legumes, and immunity and defense systems. Sulfur deficiency has become widespread in many countries in Europe. Because atmospheric inputs of sulfur continue to decrease, the deficit in the sulfur input/output is likely to increase unless sulfur fertilizers are used. Atmospheric inputs of sulfur decrease because of actions taken to limit acid rains.\nFungicide and pesticide.\nElemental sulfur is one of the oldest fungicides and pesticides. \"Dusting sulfur\", elemental sulfur in powdered form, is a common fungicide for grapes, strawberry, many vegetables and several other crops. It has a good efficacy against a wide range of powdery mildew diseases as well as black spot. In organic production, sulfur is the most important fungicide. It is the only fungicide used in organically farmed apple production against the main disease apple scab under colder conditions. Biosulfur (biologically produced elemental sulfur with hydrophilic characteristics) can also be used for these applications.\nStandard-formulation dusting sulfur is applied to crops with a sulfur duster or from a dusting plane. Wettable sulfur is the commercial name for dusting sulfur formulated with additional ingredients to make it water miscible. It has similar applications and is used as a fungicide against mildew and other mold-related problems with plants and soil.\nElemental sulfur powder is used as an \"organic\" (i.e., \"green\") insecticide (actually an acaricide) against ticks and mites. A common method of application is dusting the clothing or limbs with sulfur powder.\nA diluted solution of lime sulfur (made by combining calcium hydroxide with elemental sulfur in water) is used as a dip for pets to destroy ringworm (fungus), mange, and other dermatoses and parasites.\nSulfur candles of almost pure sulfur were burned to fumigate structures and wine barrels, but are now considered too toxic for residences.\nPharmaceuticals.\nSulfur (specifically octasulfur, S8) is used in pharmaceutical skin preparations for the treatment of acne and other conditions. It acts as a keratolytic agent and also kills bacteria, fungi, scabies mites, and other parasites. Precipitated sulfur and colloidal sulfur are used, in form of lotions, creams, powders, soaps, and bath additives, for the treatment of acne vulgaris, acne rosacea, and seborrhoeic dermatitis.\nMany drugs contain sulfur. Early examples include antibacterial sulfonamides, known as \"sulfa drugs\". A more recent example is mucolytic acetylcysteine. Sulfur is a part of many bacterial defense molecules. Most \u03b2-lactam antibiotics, including the penicillins, cephalosporins and monobactams contain sulfur.\nBatteries.\nDue to their high energy density and the availability of sulfur, there is ongoing research in creating rechargeable lithium\u2013sulfur batteries. Until now, carbonate electrolytes have caused failures in such batteries after a single cycle. In February 2022, researchers at Drexel University have not only created a prototypical battery that lasted 4000 recharge cycles, but also found the first monoclinic gamma sulfur that remained stable below 95 degrees Celsius.\nBiological role.\nSulfur is an essential component of all living cells. It is the eighth most abundant element in the human body by weight, about equal in abundance to potassium, and slightly greater than sodium and chlorine. A human body contains about of sulfur. The main dietary source of sulfur for humans is sulfur-containing amino acids, which can be found in plant and animal proteins.\nTransferring sulfur between inorganic and biomolecules.\nIn the 1880s, while studying \"Beggiatoa\" (a bacterium living in a sulfur rich environment), Sergei Winogradsky found that it oxidized hydrogen sulfide (H2S) as an energy source, forming intracellular sulfur droplets. Winogradsky referred to this form of metabolism as inorgoxidation (oxidation of inorganic compounds). Another contributor, who continued to study it was Selman Waksman. Primitive bacteria that live around deep ocean volcanic vents oxidize hydrogen sulfide for their nutrition, as discovered by Robert Ballard.\nSulfur oxidizers can use as energy sources reduced sulfur compounds, including hydrogen sulfide, elemental sulfur, sulfite, thiosulfate, and various polythionates (e.g., tetrathionate). They depend on enzymes such as sulfur oxygenase and sulfite oxidase to oxidize sulfur to sulfate. Some lithotrophs can even use the energy contained in sulfur compounds to produce sugars, a process known as chemosynthesis. Some bacteria and archaea use hydrogen sulfide in place of water as the electron donor in chemosynthesis, a process similar to photosynthesis that produces sugars and uses oxygen as the electron acceptor. Sulfur-based chemosynthesis may be simplifiedly compared with photosynthesis:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;H2S + CO2 \u2192 sugars + S\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;H2O + CO2 \u2192 sugars + O2\nThere are bacteria combining these two ways of nutrition: green sulfur bacteria and purple sulfur bacteria. Also sulfur-oxidizing bacteria can go into symbiosis with larger organisms, enabling the later to use hydrogen sulfide as food to be oxidized. Example: the giant tube worm.\nThere are sulfate-reducing bacteria, that, by contrast, \"breathe sulfate\" instead of oxygen. They use organic compounds or molecular hydrogen as the energy source. They use sulfur as the electron acceptor, and reduce various oxidized sulfur compounds back into sulfide, often into hydrogen sulfide. They can grow on other partially oxidized sulfur compounds (e.g. thiosulfates, thionates, polysulfides, sulfites).\nThere are studies pointing that many deposits of native sulfur in places that were the bottom of the ancient oceans have biological origin. These studies indicate that this native sulfur have been obtained through biological activity, but what is responsible for that (sulfur-oxidizing bacteria or sulfate-reducing bacteria) is still unknown for sure.\nSulfur is absorbed by plants roots from soil as sulfate and transported as a phosphate ester. Sulfate is reduced to sulfide via sulfite before it is incorporated into cysteine and other organosulfur compounds.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;\u2192 \u2192 \u2192 cysteine (thiol) \u2192 methionine (thioether)\nWhile the plants' role in transferring sulfur to animals by food chains is more or less understood, the role of sulfur bacteria is just getting investigated.\nProtein and organic metabolites.\nIn all forms of life, most of the sulfur is contained in two proteinogenic amino acids (cysteine and methionine), thus the element is present in all proteins that contain these amino acids. Some of the sulfur is present in certain metabolites\u2014many of which are cofactors\u2014and sulfated polysaccharides of connective tissue (chondroitin sulfates, heparin).\nThe functionality of a given protein is heavily dependent on its structure. Proteins reach this structure through the process of protein folding, which is facilitated by a variety of intra- and inter-molecular bonds. While much of the folding is driven by the formation of hydrogen bonds, covalent bonding of cysteine residues into disulfide bridges imposes constraints that stabilize particular conformations while preventing others from forming. As the bond energy of a covalent disulfide bridge is higher than the energy of a coordinate bond or hydrophobic interaction, greater numbers of disulfide bridges lead to higher energies required for protein denaturation. Disulfide bonds often serve to stabilize protein structures in the more oxidizing conditions of the extracellular environment. Within the cytoplasm, disulfide bonds may instead be reduced (i.e. in -SH form) to their constituent cysteine residues by thioredoxins.\nMany important cellular enzymes use prosthetic groups ending with sulfhydryl (-SH) moieties to handle reactions involving acyl-containing biochemicals: two common examples from basic metabolism are coenzyme A and alpha-lipoic acid. Cysteine-related metabolites homocysteine and taurine are other sulfur-containing amino acids that are similar in structure, but not coded by DNA, and are not part of the primary structure of proteins, take part in various locations of mammalian physiology. Two of the 13 classical vitamins, biotin and thiamine, contain sulfur, and serve as cofactors to several enzymes.\nIn intracellular chemistry, sulfur operates as a carrier of reducing hydrogen and its electrons for cellular repair of oxidation. Reduced glutathione, a sulfur-containing tripeptide, is a reducing agent through its sulfhydryl (\u2013SH) moiety derived from cysteine.\nMethanogenesis, the route to most of the world's methane, is a multistep biochemical transformation of carbon dioxide. This conversion requires several organosulfur cofactors. These include coenzyme M, , the immediate precursor to methane.\nMetalloproteins and inorganic cofactors.\nMetalloproteins\u2014in which the active site is a transition metal ion (or metal-sulfide cluster) often coordinated by sulfur atoms of cysteine residues\u2014are essential components of enzymes involved in electron transfer processes. Examples include plastocyanin (Cu2+) and nitrous oxide reductase (Cu\u2013S). The function of these enzymes is dependent on the fact that the transition metal ion can undergo redox reactions. Other examples include many zinc proteins, as well as iron\u2013sulfur clusters. Most pervasive are the ferrodoxins, which serve as electron shuttles in cells. In bacteria, the important nitrogenase enzymes contain an Fe\u2013Mo\u2013S cluster and is a catalyst that performs the important function of nitrogen fixation, converting atmospheric nitrogen to ammonia that can be used by microorganisms and plants to make proteins, DNA, RNA, alkaloids, and the other organic nitrogen compounds necessary for life.\nSulfur is also present in molybdenum cofactor.\nDeficiency.\nIn humans methionine is an essential amino acid; cysteine is conditionally essential and may be synthesized from non-essential serine via sulfur salvaged from methionine. Sulfur deficiency is uncommon due to the ubiquity of cysteine and methionine in food. \nIsolated sulfite oxidase deficiency is a rare, fatal genetic disease caused by mutations to sulfite oxidase, which is needed to metabolize sulfites to sulfates.\nPrecautions.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Chembox/styles.css\"/&gt;\nChemical compound\nThough elemental sulfur is only minimally absorbed through the skin and is of low toxicity to humans, inhalation of sulfur dust or contact with eyes or skin may cause irritation. Excessive ingestion of sulfur can cause a burning sensation or diarrhea, and cases of life-threatening metabolic acidosis have been reported after patients deliberately consumed sulfur as a folk remedy.\nToxicity of sulfur compounds.\nWhen sulfur burns in air, it produces sulfur dioxide. In water, this gas produces sulfurous acid and sulfites; sulfites are antioxidants that inhibit growth of aerobic bacteria and a useful food additive in small amounts. At high concentrations these acids harm the lungs, eyes, or other tissues. In organisms without lungs such as insects, sulfite in high concentration prevents respiration.\nSulfur trioxide (made by catalysis from sulfur dioxide) and sulfuric acid are similarly highly acidic and corrosive in the presence of water. Concentrated sulfuric acid is a strong dehydrating agent that can strip available water molecules and water components from sugar and organic tissue.\nThe burning of coal and/or petroleum by industry and power plants generates sulfur dioxide (SO2) that reacts with atmospheric water and oxygen to produce sulfurous acid (H2SO3). These acids are components of acid rain, lowering the pH of soil and freshwater bodies, sometimes resulting in substantial damage to the environment and chemical weathering of statues and structures. Fuel standards increasingly require that fuel producers extract sulfur from fossil fuels to prevent acid rain formation. This extracted and refined sulfur represents a large portion of sulfur production. In coal-fired power plants, flue gases are sometimes purified. More modern power plants that use synthesis gas extract the sulfur before they burn the gas.\nHydrogen sulfide is about one-half as toxic as hydrogen cyanide, and intoxicates by the same mechanism (inhibition of the respiratory enzyme cytochrome oxidase), though hydrogen sulfide is less likely to cause sudden poisonings from small inhaled amounts (near its permissible exposure limit (PEL) of 20\u00a0ppm) because of its disagreeable odor. However, its presence in ambient air at concentration over 100\u2013150\u00a0ppm quickly deadens the sense of smell, and a victim may breathe increasing quantities without noticing until severe symptoms cause death. Dissolved sulfide and hydrosulfide salts are toxic by the same mechanism.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was originally developed in the late 1980s for six European languages by the EEC ESPRIT information technology research and development program. As many symbols as possible have been taken over from the IPA; where this is not possible, other signs that are available are used, e.g. [codice_1] for schwa (IPA ), [codice_2] for the vowel sound found in French 'two' (IPA ), and [codice_3] for the vowel sound found in French 'nine' (IPA ).\nThe characters [codice_4] represent the pronunciation of the name SAMPA in English, with the initial symbol [\"] indicating primary stress (in IPA, ). Like IPA, SAMPA is usually enclosed in square brackets or slashes, which are not part of the alphabet proper and merely signify that it is phonetic as opposed to regular text.\nLanguages.\nToday, officially, SAMPA has been developed for all the sounds of the following languages:\nFeatures.\nSAMPA was developed in the late 1980s in the European Commission-funded ESPRIT project 2589 \"Speech Assessment Methods\" (SAM)\u2014hence \"SAM Phonetic Alphabet\"\u2014in order to facilitate email data exchange and computational processing of transcriptions in phonetics and speech technology.\nSAMPA is a partial encoding of the IPA. The first version of SAMPA was the union of the sets of phoneme codes for Danish, Dutch, English, French, German and Italian; later versions extended SAMPA to cover other European languages. Since SAMPA is based on phoneme inventories, each SAMPA table is valid only in the language it was created for. In order to make this IPA encoding technique universally applicable, X-SAMPA was created, which provides \"one single table\" without language-specific differences.\nSAMPA was devised as a hack to work around the inability of text encodings to represent IPA symbols. Consequently, as Unicode support for IPA symbols becomes more widespread, the necessity for a separate, computer-readable system for representing the IPA in ASCII decreases. However, text input relies on specific keyboard encodings or input devices. For this reason, SAMPA and X-SAMPA are still widely used in computational phonetics and in speech technology.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"IPA common/styles.css\" /&gt;&lt;templatestyles src=\"IPA pulmonic consonants/styles.css\" /&gt;&lt;templatestyles src=\"IPA co-articulated consonants/styles.css\" /&gt;&lt;templatestyles src=\"IPA vowels/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

She is noted for her optimistic and idealistic subject matter, and incorporation of various genres into her rock-oriented sound, including blues, country, folk, and pop.\nShe has released twelve studio albums, five compilations, and three live albums, and contributed to several film soundtracks. Her most popular songs include \"All I Wanna Do\" (1994), \"Strong Enough\" (1994), \"If It Makes You Happy\" (1996), \"Everyday Is a Winding Road\" (1996), \"Tomorrow Never Dies\" (1997), \"My Favorite Mistake\" (1998), \"Picture\" (2002, duet with Kid Rock), and \"Soak Up the Sun\" (2002).\nCrow has sold over 50 million albums worldwide and has won nine Grammy Awards from 32 nominations. In 2023 she was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\nIn addition to her music career, she has appeared in television series and films, including \"30 Rock\", \"Cop Rock\", \"GCB\", \"Cougar Town\", \"One Tree Hill\", and \"\".\nEarly life and education.\nCrow was born on February 11, 1962, in Kennett, Missouri, the daughter of Bernice (n\u00e9e Cain), a piano teacher, and Wendell Wyatt Crow, a lawyer and trumpet player. Her great-grandfather was Congressman Charles\u00a0A. Crow (1873\u20131938). She has two older sisters, Kathy and Karen, and a younger brother, Steven.\nWhile studying at Kennett High School, Crow was a majorette and an all-state track athlete, winning medals in the 75-meter low hurdles. She also joined the pep club, the National Honor Society, and the National FFA Organization, and was crowned Paperdoll Queen in a celebrity-judged beauty contest during her senior year.\nShe then enrolled at the University of Missouri in Columbia and in 1984 received a BS Ed degree in music education. While at the university, she sang in the local band Cashmere. She was a member of the Kappa Alpha Theta sorority, Sigma Alpha Iota International Music Fraternity for Women, and the Omicron Delta Kappa honor society, as well as working as a summer welcome orientation leader.\nCareer.\n1987\u20131991: Early career.\nAfter graduating from the University of Missouri, Crow worked as a music teacher at Kellison Elementary School in Fenton, Missouri. Teaching during the day gave her the opportunity to sing in bands on the weekends. She was later introduced to local musician and record producer Jay Oliver. He had a studio in the basement of his parents' home in St. Louis and helped her by using her in advertising jingles. Her first jingle was a back-to-school spot for the St. Louis department store Famous-Barr. Soon after, she sang in commercial jingles for McDonald's and Toyota. She was quoted in a \"60 Minutes\" segment as saying she made $40,000 on the McDonald's ad alone.\nCrow toured with Michael Jackson as a backing vocalist during his Bad World Tour 1987\u20131989, and often performed with Jackson on \"I Just Can't Stop Loving You\". She also recorded background vocals for Stevie Wonder, Belinda Carlisle, Jimmy Buffett, Kevin Gilbert and Don Henley. Crow played keyboards and sang backing vocals for Gilbert's band Toy Matinee in the early 1990s.\nIn 1989, Crow contributed backing vocals to the Neal Schon track \"Smoke of the Revolution\" from his album \"Late Nite\".\nCrow also sang in the short-lived Steven Bochco drama \"Cop Rock\" series finale in 1990 and her song \"Heal Somebody\" appeared in the film \"Bright Angel\". In 1991, her recording of \"Welcome to the Real Life\" featured on the soundtrack to the Brian Bosworth action film \"Stone Cold\". Later that year, her performance of \"Hundreds of Tears\" was included on the \"Point Break\" soundtrack and she sang a duet with Kenny Loggins on the track \"I Would Do Anything\", from his album \"Leap of Faith\".\n1992: Scrapped debut album.\nIn 1992, Crow recorded her first attempt at a debut album with Sting's record producer Hugh Padgham. The self-titled debut album was due to be released in September 1992, but Crow and her label mutually decided that the album did not merit release. Crow described it as \"too produced\" and \"slick\". However, a handful of cassette copies of the album were leaked, along with press folders for album publicity. This album has been widely dispersed via file sharing networks and fan trading. In the meantime, Crow's songs were recorded by major artists such as Celine Dion, Tina Turner and Wynonna Judd.\n1994\u20131997: International success.\nCrow began dating Kevin Gilbert and joined him in an ad hoc group of musicians known to themselves as the \"Tuesday Music Club\". The group existed as a casual songwriting collective prior to its association with Crow; however, it rapidly developed into a vehicle for her debut album after Crow's arrival. Group members Gilbert, David Baerwald, and David Ricketts (both formerly of David &amp; David), Bill Bottrell, Brian MacLeod, and Dan Schwartz share songwriting credits with Crow on her debut album, \"Tuesday Night Music Club\", released in 1993. Her relationship with Gilbert became acrimonious soon after the album was released, and disputes arose about songwriting credits. \"Tuesday Night Music Club\" featured many of the songs written by Crow's friends, including the second single, \"Leaving Las Vegas\". The album was slow to garner attention, until \"All I Wanna Do\" became an unexpected smash hit in October 1994. The singles \"Strong Enough\" and \"Can't Cry Anymore\" were also released, with the first song (\"Strong Enough\") charting at No. 5 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 and \"Can't Cry Anymore\" hitting the Top 40. \"Tuesday Night Music Club\" went on to sell more than 7 million copies in the US and UK during the 1990s. The album also won Crow three Grammys at the 37th Annual Grammy Awards in 1995: Record of the Year, Best New Artist and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance.\nCrow performed at the 1994 Woodstock Festival and appeared in the \"New Faces\" section of \"Rolling Stone\" in 1994. She also supplied background vocals to the song \"The Garden of Allah\" from Don Henley's 1995 album \"\".\nIn 1996, Crow released her self-titled second album. She produced the album herself and also played a variety of instruments, from various guitars, bass or pedal steel to various organs and piano. The debut single, \"If It Makes You Happy\", became a radio success and netted her two Grammys for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance and Best Rock Album at the 39th Annual Grammy Awards in 1997. Other singles included \"A Change Would Do You Good\", \"Home\", and \"Everyday Is a Winding Road\". The album was banned from sale at Walmart, because in the lyrics to \"Love Is a Good Thing\" Crow says that Walmart sells guns to children. The album also features a protest song called \"Redemption Day\", which was covered by Johnny Cash on his posthumous album \"\".\nCrow performed at Another Roadside Attraction in 1997. Also in 1997, Crow contributed the theme song to the James Bond film \"Tomorrow Never Dies\". Her song \"Tomorrow Never Dies\" was nominated for a Best Song Written Specifically for a Motion Picture or for Television at the 41st Annual Grammy Awards and Best Original Song at the 55th Golden Globe Awards. \n1998\u20131999: \"The Globe Sessions\" and live album.\nCrow collaborated on Scott Weiland's 1998 album, \"12 Bar Blues\". Also in 1998, Crow released \"The Globe Sessions\". During this period, she discussed in interviews having gone through a deep depression, and there was speculation about a brief affair with Eric Clapton. The debut single from this album, \"My Favorite Mistake\", was rumored to be about Clapton, but Crow says otherwise\u2014that the song is about a philandering ex-boyfriend. Crow has refused to say who the song was about, telling \"Billboard\" magazine on the release of her album, \"Oh, there will be just so much speculation, and because of that there's great safety and protection in the fact that people will be guessing so many different people and I'm the only person who will ever really know. I'm really private about who I've had relationships with, and I don't talk about them in the press. I don't even really talk about them with the people around me.\" Despite the difficulties in recording the album, Crow told the BBC in 2005 that, \"My favorite single is 'My Favorite Mistake'. It was a lot of fun to record and it's still a lot of fun to play.\" The album won Best Rock Album at the 41st Annual Grammy Awards in 1999. It was re-released in 1999, with a bonus track, Crow's cover of the Guns N' Roses song \"Sweet Child o' Mine\", which was included on the soundtrack of the film \"Big Daddy\". The song won a Grammy for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance at the 42nd Annual Grammy Awards in 2000. Other singles included \"There Goes the Neighborhood\", \"Anything but Down\", and \"The Difficult Kind\". Crow's live recording of \"There Goes the Neighborhood\" won a Grammy for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance at the 43rd Annual Grammy Awards in 2001. \"The Globe Sessions\" peaked at No. 5 on the \"Billboard\" 200 chart, achieving US sales of 2 million as of January 2008. Later in 1998, Crow took part in a live concert in tribute to Burt Bacharach, contributing vocals on \"One Less Bell to Answer\".\nIn 1999, Crow also made her acting debut as an ill-fated drifter in the suspense/drama \"The Minus Man\", which starred her then-boyfriend Owen Wilson as a serial killer. Also in 1999, she appeared in Prince's album \"Rave Un2 the Joy Fantastic\", singing backing vocals in the song \"Baby Knows\". Prince included a cover of her \"Everyday Is a Winding Road\" in the album. She also appeared in Zucchero Fornaciari's collection \"Overdose d'amore/The Ballads\" featuring the song \"Blue\" (co-written by Bono).\nShe also released a live album called \"\". The record featured Crow singing many of her hit singles with new musical spins and guest appearances by many other musicians including Sarah McLachlan, Stevie Nicks, the Dixie Chicks, Keith Richards, and Eric Clapton. It included her Grammy winning performance of \"There Goes the Neighborhood\".\n2002\u20132004: \"C'mon, C'mon\" and \"The Very Best of Sheryl Crow\".\nCrow has been involved with the Scleroderma Research Foundation (SRF) since the late 1990s, performing at fund-raisers and befriending Sharon Monsky. In 2002, as a result of her friend Kent Sexton dying from scleroderma, she interrupted work on her new album \"C'mon, C'mon\" to record the traditional hymn \"Be Still, My Soul\", to be played at his funeral. In November of that year it was released as a single, with the proceeds going to SRF.\nHer fourth studio album, \"C'mon, C'mon\", was released in 2002, spawning the hit single \"Soak Up the Sun\". The second single, \"Steve McQueen\", won the Female Rock Vocal Performance Grammy at the 45th Annual Grammy Awards in 2003.\nCrow opposed the 2003 invasion of Iraq, wearing a shirt that read \"I don't believe in your war, Mr. Bush!\" during a performance on \"Good Morning America\" and posting an open letter explaining her opposition on her website. At a performance with Kid Rock at the 45th Annual Grammy Awards, she wore a large peace sign and a guitar strap with the words \"No War\". She showed support for injured soldiers in 2003 by playing her guitar and singing to individual patients at Walter Reed Army Medical Center.\nShe recorded the song \"Kiss That Girl\" for the film \"Bridget Jones's Diary\".

She also assisted him on the track \"Run Off to LA\".\nCrow collaborated with Michelle Branch on the song \"Love Me Like That\" for Branch's second album, \"Hotel Paper\", released in 2003.\nShe was featured on the Johnny Cash album \"\" on the song \"Field of Diamonds\" as a background vocalist, and also played the accordion for the songs \"Wayfaring Stranger\" and \"Mary of the Wild Moor\".\nIn 2003, a greatest hits compilation called \"The Very Best of Sheryl Crow\" was released. It featured many of her hit singles, as well as some new tracks. Among them was the 1960s pop song, \"The First Cut Is the Deepest\" by Cat Stevens, which became her biggest radio hit since \"All I Wanna Do\". She also released the single \"Light in Your Eyes\", which received limited airplay. \"The First Cut Is the Deepest\" earned her two awards for Favorite Pop/Rock Female Artist and Favorite Adult Contemporary Artist at the American Music Awards of 2004.\nIn 2004, Crow appeared as a musical theater performer in the Cole Porter biographical film \"De-Lovely\".\n2005\u20132007: \"Wildflower\".\nHer fifth studio album, \"Wildflower\", was released in September 2005. Although the album debuted at No. 2 on the \"Billboard\" charts, it received mixed reviews and was not as commercially successful as her previous albums. In December 2005, the album was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album, while Crow was nominated for a Best Female Pop Vocal Performance Grammy for the first single \"Good Is Good\" at the 48th Grammy Awards. However, she ultimately lost in both categories to Kelly Clarkson. The album got a new boost in 2006 when the second single was announced as \"Always on Your Side\", re-recorded with British musician Sting and sent off to radio, where it was quickly embraced on Adult Top 40. The collaboration with Sting resulted in a Grammy nomination for Best Pop Collaboration With Vocals at the 49th Grammy Awards. As of January 2008, \"Wildflower\" has sold 949,000 units in the United States.\nAlso in 2005, Crow contributed \"Real Gone\", the opening track to the soundtrack for Disney and Pixar's 2006 animated film \"Cars\". Crow was diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer in mid-February 2006, her doctors stating that, \"Prognosis for a full recovery is excellent.\"\nCrow's first concert after her cancer diagnosis was on May 18 of that year in Orlando, Florida, where she played to over 10,000 information technology professionals at the SAP Sapphire Convention. Her first public appearance was on June 12, when she performed at the Murat Theater in Indianapolis, Indiana. She also appeared on \"Larry King Live\" on CNN on August 23, 2006. In this show, she talked about her comeback, her breakup with Lance Armstrong, her past job as Michael Jackson's backup singer, and her experience as a breast cancer survivor.\nIn late 2006, Crow was nominated for a Best Original Song Golden Globe Award for the song \"Try Not To Remember\" from the film \"Home of the Brave\" at the 64th Golden Globe Awards.\nIn early 2007, Crow was scheduled to sing at an annual benefit concert for the Cardinal Glennon Children's Hospital that sportscaster Bob Costas hosts every year. Her performance was opposed by Catholic Archbishop Raymond Leo Burke due to her position on abortion. Burke resigned as chair of the medical center's board of governors when Crow's appearance was confirmed.\nCrow wrote a foreword for the book \"Crazy Sexy Cancer Tips\", a book written by Kris Carr that was based on her 2007 documentary film \"Crazy Sexy Cancer\". Crow contributed her cover of the Beatles' \"Here Comes the Sun\" on the soundtrack for the DreamWorks animated film \"Bee Movie\" in November 2007. She contributed background vocals to Ryan Adams's song \"Two\" from his album \"Easy Tiger\".\n2008\u20132009: \"Detours\".\nCrow returned with her sixth studio album \"Detours\", which was released on February 5, 2008. \"Detours\" debuted at No. 2 on the US \"Billboard\" 200 chart selling close to 92,000 copies in its first week and an additional 52,000 copies in its second week. In support of the new album, Crow launched a 25-date tour with James Blunt, and the lineup included reggae group Toots and the Maytals after being handpicked by Crow who said they are one of her favorite bands.\n\"Detours\" was recorded at Crow's Nashville, Tennessee farm. Her son, Wyatt, makes an appearance on the song \"Lullaby for Wyatt\", which is featured in the movie \"Grace Is Gone\".\n\"Shine Over Babylon\" was the first promotional single from the album (download only). The first official single released from the album was \"Love Is Free\", followed by \"Out of Our Heads\". As of 2010, \"Detours\" had sold more than 700,000 copies worldwide.\nCrow endorsed Barack Obama in the 2008 United States presidential election and later performed on the fourth and last day of the 2008 Democratic National Convention.\nCrow also recorded a studio version of \"So Glad We Made It\" for the \"AT&amp;T Team USA Soundtrack\", in conjunction with the 2008 US Olympic team sponsors, AT&amp;T.\nA&amp;M Records re-released Crow's debut album, \"Tuesday Night Music Club\", as a deluxe version 2CD/DVD set on November 17, 2009. The released included the single \"Killer Life\", which charted moderately in adult album alternative radio. The bonus CD contains unreleased songs and B-sides, and a new mix of \"I Shall Believe\". The DVD features music videos for each of the album's singles.\nIn August 2008, Crow (in partnership with Western Glove Works) launched a jeans brand, Bootheel Trading Company.\nOn April 4, 2009, Crow, who practices Transcendental Meditation, took part in a benefit concert at the Radio City Music Hall in New York City organized by the David Lynch Foundation supporting the Foundation's goal of teaching one million at-risk students to meditate. She and Ben Harper performed George Harrison's \"My Sweet Lord\". Other performers at the concert included Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr, Mike Love, Moby, Eddie Vedder and Donovan.\n2010\u20132012: \"100 Miles from Memphis\".\nIn 2010, Crow contributed the original spoken-word track \"My Name Is Mwamaroyi\" to the Enough Project and Downtown Records' \"Raise Hope for Congo\" compilation. Proceeds from the compilation fund efforts to make the protection and empowerment of Congo's women a priority, as well as inspire individuals around the world to raise their voice for peace in Congo.\nA&amp;M Records released Crow's seventh studio album, \"100 Miles from Memphis\", on July 20, 2010. The album had a Memphis soul sound and featured the lead single \"Summer Day\".\nLater that year, she joined country singers Loretta Lynn and Miranda Lambert on an update of Lynn's song \"Coal Miner's Daughter\" for the 2010 album \"\". They later performed the song at the 2010 Country Music Association Awards in November.\nIn October 2010, she performed at Jon Stewart's and Stephen Colbert's Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear\nIn July 2011, Crow performed at the opening night of the Cheyenne Frontier Days Rodeo. Animal welfare campaigners had urged her not to, alleging animal cruelty at the event. Almost 13,000 people signed a petition calling on Crow not to perform.\nOn September 20, 2011, it was announced that Crow will write the music and lyrics for \"Diner\", a new musical inspired by the critically acclaimed 1982 film \"Diner\". The show initially had an intended run on Broadway planned for the fall of 2012 though it eventually opened in Arlington County, Virginia in 2014 and was directed and choreographed by Tony Award winner Kathleen Marshall.\nOn October 11, 2011, William Shatner released the album \"Seeking Major Tom\", on which Crow sang the track \"Mrs. Major Tom\" by electronic music artist KIA, released in 2003 on the album \"Adieu Shinjuku Zulu\".\nOn September 21, 2012, Mailboat Records released \"\", an Americana double-CD that tells the life of fellow Missourian Mark Twain in spoken word and song. The project was a benefit for the Mark Twain Boyhood Home &amp; Museum in Hannibal, Missouri. Crow sang the only period piece song on the project, Stephen Foster's \"Beautiful Dreamer\". The song was sung a cappella and accompanied the narrative describing the early days of Mark Twain's young family in Hartford, Connecticut. Other performers that joined the project, produced by Carl Jackson, included Jimmy Buffett, Clint Eastwood, Garrison Keillor, Brad Paisley, Emmylou Harris, Vince Gill, Ricky Skaggs, and others. AirPlay Direct reported the project as its most downloaded Americana album.\nIn September 2012, Crow was featured in a campaign called \"30 Songs/30 Days\" to support \"\", a multi-platform media project inspired by Nicholas Kristof and Sheryl WuDunn's book.\nCrow was invited by journalist Katie Couric to write the theme song for her new talk-show, \"Katie\". The song, titled \"This Day\", was nominated for a Daytime Emmy Award in the category Outstanding Original Song.\nOn November 1, 2012, Crow released an original song she called \"Woman in the White House\" that was made available for a free download. As the title suggests, the country-flavored tune defends the idea of a woman president. Mixed reviews from critics ranged from \"sort of patronizing and gender essentialist\" to \"good-natured and well-intentioned\". The song, praised for its tongue-in-cheek lyrics, was commented on by country singer Brad Paisley, who characterized it as \"all in good fun\". The song was later released for digital download on iTunes and a portion of the proceeds were donated to the American Red Cross to aid in the recovery effort in the wake of Hurricane Sandy.\nAlso in 2012, VH1 ranked Crow at No. 25 as one of the \"100 Greatest Women in Music\".\n2013\u20132015: \"Feels Like Home\".\nIn 2011, Crow separated from her label, A&amp;M Records. The singer followed Nashville neighbor Brad Paisley's advice and, after being introduced to producer Justin Niebank and several Nashville-based songwriters such as Chris DuBois, Luke Laird and Chris Stapleton, she started her first country music project in 2013.\nIn 2013, Crow signed a recording contract with Warner Music Nashville and, a few months later, released \"Easy\", the first single from the upcoming album, which became her first top twenty country radio hit and her highest charting lead single since 2005. \"Feels Like Home\" was released on September 10, 2013, and debuted at number seven on the \"Billboard\" 200 with first-week sales of over 36,000 copies, becoming Crow's ninth top ten album.\nCrow was one of the opening acts for George Strait's 2014 leg of \"The Cowboy Rides Away Tour\". Along with Stevie Nicks, Bonnie Raitt, Emmylou Harris and Carrie Underwood, she made an appearance at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony, paying tribute to Linda Ronstadt, who was one of the inductees of 2014. Crow, along with country band Gloriana, joined Rascal Flatts on their \"Rewind Tour\", which kicked off May 16, 2014.\nThe 40th anniversary celebration benefit concert of the \"Austin City Limits\" television show was held on June 26, 2014, and televised later that year. Crow hosted the event along with Jeff Bridges and performed with Kris Kristofferson, Gary Clark Jr., Alabama Shakes, as well as her former guitarist Doyle Bramhall II. Crow sang on a rendition of \"Baby, It's Cold Outside\" that appeared on Darius Rucker's Christmas album, \"Home for the Holidays\". In December 2015, she covered \"A Hard Day's Night\" at the John Lennon 75th Birthday Concert, and performed \"Two More Bottles of Wine\" with Vince Gill at another tribute concert: \"The Life &amp; Songs of Emmylou Harris\".\n2017\u20132022: \"Be Myself\", \"Threads\" and \"Sheryl\".\nCrow duets with Americana artist Rodney Crowell on the track \"I'm Tied To Ya\" from his album \"Close Ties\" which was released in March 2017. Crow's tenth studio album, \"Be Myself\", was released on April 21, 2017. It was co-produced by Crow, Jeff Trott and Tchad Blake, and is the first time the latter has appeared on one of Crow's studio albums since \"The Globe Sessions\" in 1998. \"Be Myself\" was described by Crow as a return to the sound of her nineties work, and intentionally eschews the country-influenced sound of her previous album. In an interview with \"Rolling Stone\", Crow said that she did not enjoy the country radio promotional process: \"It was more political than I expected... You do lots of free [shows] for radio stations in trade for getting played between three and four in the morning. And that's just not how other formats work, and that goes against my grain. I'm too old to allow that for myself, and to spend any night away from my kid for that is not justified.\"\nCrow's 2019 album \"Threads\" features contributions from, among others, Don Henley, Joe Walsh, Sting, Stevie Nicks, Willie Nelson, and Keith Richards. While promoting her UK tour, Crow released \"Wouldn't Wanna Be Like You\" featuring St. Vincent and revealed that she intended for \"Threads\" to be her final album, citing the impossibility of releasing something that could follow-up such a gathering of artists. She added that she would continue to write and tour and would potentially release short-form music akin to extended plays.\nIn 2019, it was reported that Crow was among hundreds of artists whose material had been destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire. Crow had initially told BBC News that the master and safety back-ups for her first seven albums were lost in the fire. However, in a 2022 interview with \"The Line of Best Fit\", Crow revealed that her masters had in fact not been lost, stating that \"luckily, they found most of mine in a different area.\" In 2022, \"Sheryl\", a Showtime documentary film directed by Amy Scott chronicling her career, premiered at the South by Southwest film festival.\n2023\u2013present: \"Evolution\".\nCrow announced that she recorded a new studio album, her twelfth, \"Evolution\", on November 3, 2023. The news arrived just ahead of her induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame that same day. The album was released March 29, 2024. It was preceded by the single \"Alarm Clock\". Also in 2024, she contributed guitar to a re-release of Mark Knopfler's \"\" in aid of the Teenage Cancer Trust. On October 25, 2024, she released the single \"Light A Candle\", proceeds of which would be donated to the American Red Cross, supporting communities affected by hurricanes and tropical storms in 2024, including Hurricanes Helene and Milton.\nOn May 23, 2025, Crow released the single \"I Know\", in aid of Mental Health Awareness Month.\nMusical style.\nCrow's music has been categorized as rock, country rock, pop rock, and roots rock. Her music also incorporates elements of blues, country, folk, and pop, with an idealistic and optimistic attitude.\nInstruments and signature model guitars.\nEarly in her career, Crow performed extensively with a 1962 Gibson Country Western guitar which was her personal favorite, but she eventually feared that it would not stand up to the rigors of continued touring and stage use, and in 1999 asked Gibson to build her a replica for use on stage. The manufacturer responded by introducing a \"Sheryl Crow\" model in their Signature Artist Series, which is essentially a re-creation of the square-shouldered 1962-era Country Western model. In 2013, Gibson also introduced a limited edition \"Sheryl Crow Southern Jumbo\", a reissue of the slope-shouldered predecessor of the 1962-era Country Western.\nPersonal life.\nRelationships and family.\nCrow has had several high-profile romantic relationships. In the late 1990s, she dated musician Eric Clapton and actor Owen Wilson. The song \"Safe and Sound\" on the album \"C'mon, C'mon\" was dedicated to Wilson and, according to the album's liner notes, was an account of their relationship. Crow began dating cyclist Lance Armstrong in 2003. The couple announced their engagement in September 2005, but jointly announced they had split on February 3, 2006. According to Crow, she has been engaged two other times but never married.\nIn May 2007, Crow announced on her website that she had adopted a boy who was born the month before. In June 2010, Crow announced that she had adopted another boy born the previous April. She and her sons live in West Nashville, Tennessee. She also owns a home in Destin, Florida. She owned a loft apartment in the NoHo neighborhood of Lower Manhattan from 1998 to 2017.\nCrow and her son Levi are diehard Milwaukee Bucks fans, and went to several of their post-season games in 2021 en route to Milwaukee's 2021 NBA Finals victory. Giannis Antetokounmpo and Khris Middleton are her favorite players.\nHealth.\nAfter being diagnosed with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), a non-invasive form of breast cancer, Crow underwent a lumpectomy at a Los Angeles facility on February 22, 2006, followed by seven weeks of radiation therapy. In August 2010, Crow partnered with her surgeon, Kristi Funk, to open the Sheryl Crow Imaging Center at Funk's Pink Lotus Breast Center. Crow had also suffered from depression.\nIn November 2011, Crow was diagnosed with a meningioma, the most common kind of brain tumor, usually benign, for which she continued to have regular follow-up exams.\nViews.\nCrow was raised Presbyterian, but she moved towards a more general affiliation and now describes herself as Christian. She is known for her liberal political point of view, opposing the invasion of Iraq in 2003, supporting gun control measures, opposing military intervention in Syria, and supporting efforts to reduce climate change.\nAwards.\nCrow has been awarded honorary doctorates from the University of Missouri (her alma mater) and Southeast Missouri State University in Cape Girardeau.\nIn 2006, Crow was a recipient of the American Academy of Achievement's Golden Plate Award presented by Awards Council member Steven Spielberg at a ceremony in Los Angeles.\nOn November 3, 2023, Crow was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

However, structuralist film theory differs from linguistic theory in that its codifications include a more apparent temporal aspect. In other words, the site of the study (the film) is moving in time and must be analyzed in a framework which can consider its temporality. To that end, structuralist film theory is dependent on a new kind of sign, first proposed by the Prague linguistic circle, dubbed the ostensive sign.\nTheoreticians.\nFilm theorists associated with structuralism include Peter Wollen, Sol Worth, Calvin Pryluck, Christian Metz. and Will Wright.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

This neurological condition is common, affecting approximately 50 million individuals around the world. \nDepending on the regions of the brain involved, seizures can lead to changes in movement, sensation, behavior, awareness, or consciousness. Symptoms vary widely. Some seizures involve subtle changes, such as brief lapses in attention or awareness (as seen in absence seizures), while others cause generalized convulsions with loss of consciousness (tonic\u2013clonic seizures). Most seizures last less than two minutes and are followed by a postictal period of confusion, fatigue, or other symptoms. Status epilepticus is a medical emergency consisting of a seizure that lasts longer than five minutes, or multiple seizures without full recovery between episodes.\nSeizures are classified as provoked when they are triggered by a known cause such as fever, acute head trauma, or metabolic imbalance. Unprovoked seizures occur when no immediate trigger is identified. Recurrent unprovoked seizures define the neurological condition epilepsy.\nClinical features.\nThe clinical signs and symptoms associated with a seizure are also referred to as seizure semiology. Seizure semiology varies depending on the brain regions involved and the type of seizure. This may affect movement, sensation, autonomic functions, or cognitive and emotional processing. Motor symptoms can include muscle stiffening (tonic activity), rhythmic jerking (clonic activity), sudden muscle jerks (myoclonus), sudden loss of muscle tone (atonia), eye deviation, or other repetitive involuntary movements (automatisms). Sensory disturbances may involve tingling, visual phenomena, or hallucinated sounds. Autonomic features can include changes in heart rate, respiration, or gastrointestinal sensations. Cognitive or emotional symptoms may manifest as confusion, fear, or altered perception.\nSome individuals experience an aura associated with their focal seizures, characterized by subjective sensations such as unusual smells, a sudden emotional shift, or feelings of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu.\nMost seizures last less than two minutes and may be followed by a recovery phase known as the postictal state, which may include confusion, fatigue, or other neurologic symptoms. Seizures lasting more than five minutes, or occurring in rapid succession without recovery, are classified as status epilepticus, a medical emergency that can result in long-term brain injury or death.\nClassification.\nSeizures are classified according to their site of onset in the brain, clinical features, and level of consciousness during the episode. In 2025, the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) released an updated classification to improve clarity, clinical relevance, and global applicability. The system distinguishes four major types: focal, generalized, unknown whether focal or generalized, and unclassified seizures. Seizures are further characterized based on whether consciousness is preserved or impaired, as determined by responsiveness during the event.\nFocal seizures.\nFocal seizures (previously known as partial seizures) originate within a network limited to one hemisphere of the brain. They may arise from the cerebral cortex or subcortical structures. For a given seizure type, seizure usually starts in the same part of the brain each time. Once initiated, the seizure may remain localized or spread to adjacent areas, and in some cases, may travel to the opposite hemisphere (contralateral spread). Despite this potential for spread, the initial focus remains consistent. \nFocal seizures are subdivided based on whether consciousness is preserved or impaired, a classifier defined by awareness and responsiveness during the event. They are also differentiated by the localization or spread of epileptiform activity. The three major classifications of focal seizures are described below: \nFocal seizures can manifest with motor, sensory, autonomic, cognitive, or emotional symptoms, depending on the regions involved. They often present with unilateral symptoms, but bilateral symptoms may also be seen, even when a seizure is not classified as focal-to-bilateral. This is because several structures in the brain have bilateral effects in the body (e.g. primary visual cortex). \nFocal impaired consciousness seizures are the most common type of seizure in individuals older than one year of age, affecting 36% of epilepsy patients overall.\nGeneralized seizures.\nGeneralized seizures originate at a specific point within, and quickly spread across both hemispheres through interconnected brain networks. \nThey can be divided into three broad categories:\nThese categories include several subtypes of seizures, each with their own distinctive symptoms and diagnostic criteria. \nLike focal seizures, generalized seizures can present with asymmetric or bilateral symptoms, so thorough evaluation and history-gathering is necessary for diagnosis. One key difference between generalized and focal seizures is the age at onset, which is significantly lower in patients with generalized seizures.\nGeneralized tonic\u2013clonic seizures, previously known as grand mal seizures, are associated with the highest morbidity and mortality. They are the primary risk factor for sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP).\nUnknown (whether focal or generalized) seizures.\nWhen available information is insufficient to determine whether a seizure is focal or generalized, it is classified as unknown. These seizures can be classified by level of consciousness and observable symptoms when possible.\nUnclassified seizures.\nSeizures are designated as unclassified when they are recognized as epileptic events, but insufficient information is available to assign them to any specific class. This is typically a temporary designation pending further clinical evaluation.\nCauses.\nSeizures can occur for many reasons and are broadly classified based on whether they are provoked (acute symptomatic) or unprovoked. Identifying the underlying cause is critical for guiding treatment and assessing the risk of recurrence.\nProvoked seizures.\nProvoked seizures are also known as acute symptomatic seizures. They are caused by an identifiable, transient condition affecting brain function. The temporal relationship between the cause and the seizure is important, but no single time frame has been established. Proposed criteria for provoked seizures include symptoms within one week of acute brain injury, following subdural hematoma, during central nervous system infection, or within 24 hours of a severe metabolic imbalance. Common causes of acute symptomatic seizures include:\nUnprovoked seizures.\nUnprovoked seizures occur without an immediate precipitating event. These include spontaneous seizures and reflex seizures, which are consistently triggered by specific stimuli (e.g., flashing lights) but arise due to an enduring predisposition, not a transient cause.\nThey typically reflect an underlying neurological predisposition and are associated with a higher risk of recurrence. Diagnostic criteria for epilepsy are met when there are either two or more unprovoked seizures occurring more than 24 hours apart, or one unprovoked seizure with a recurrence risk of at least 60% over the next 10 years based on clinical and diagnostic findings.\nCauses and contexts for unprovoked seizures include:\nMechanism.\nSeizures are the result of neuronal activity in the brain that is abnormal, excessive, and synchronized (also referred to as hypersynchronous). At a cellular level, they reflect a disruption of the normal balance between excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission. Under healthy conditions, excitation (mainly mediated by the neurotransmitter glutamate) and inhibition (primarily via the neurotransmitter GABA) maintain cortical stability. An excess of excitation or a failure of inhibition can tip this balance, promoting hypersynchronous neuronal firing characteristic of seizures. The transition from an interictal state (between seizures) to an ictal state (seizure) is known as ictogenesis. This process involves a cascade of physiological and network-level changes that lead to the sudden onset of pathological activity.\nIn provoked seizures (e.g., due to trauma, metabolic insults, or infections), acute disturbances in ionic gradients, neurotransmitter release, and neuronal membrane stability may temporarily lower the threshold for seizure activity.\nBrief seizures, such as absence seizures lasting 5\u201310 seconds, do not cause observable brain damage. More prolonged seizures have a higher risk of neuronal death. Prolonged and recurrent seizures, such as status epilepticus, typically cause brain damage. Scarring of brain tissue (gliosis), neuronal death, and shrinking of areas of the brain (atrophy) are linked to recurrent seizures. These changes may lead to the development of epilepsy, in a process called epileptogenesis.\nClinical evaluation.\nThe clinical evaluation after a seizure event involves confirming if the episode was epileptic in nature, determining its type and cause, and distinguishing it from other conditions that can mimic seizures. A careful clinical history and targeted investigations are essential.\nThe events preceding seizure onset, clinical signs observed during the episode, and symptoms following the episode are critical for accurately classifying the seizure type. Individuals with focal preserved consciousness seizures may be able to recall detailed information about their seizures. However, many individuals cannot recall the details of their own seizures, so obtaining eyewitness accounts is often essential for an accurate diagnosis. When available, video recordings can provide valuable supplementary information, particularly in distinguishing epileptic seizures from mimics such as psychogenic nonepileptic seizures.\nClinical history.\nA detailed seizure history should include information on pre-ictal, ictal, and post-ictal stages, as described below:\nPre-ictal \nIctal\nPost-ictal\nObtaining medical history is also important, including the following:\nPhysical examination.\nA focused neurological examination can yield additional diagnostic clues, particularly soon after a seizure. Findings may include:\nBetween seizures, the neurological examination is often normal.\nLaboratory tests.\nLaboratory testing is often performed in the evaluation of a new-onset seizure, particularly when a provoked cause is suspected. Common investigations include:\nLaboratory findings can help identify treatable causes of seizures and guide management decisions.\nElectroencephalography (EEG).\nAn electroencephalogram (EEG) records electrical activity in the brain and can help support a diagnosis of epilepsy. Interictal EEG (which can be observed between seizure episodes) may reveal epileptiform abnormalities, such as spikes, sharp waves, or spike-and-wave discharges. However, an unremarkable EEG does not exclude epilepsy.\nIn certain cases, prolonged video EEG monitoring is used to capture seizures in real time and clarify seizure type, localization, or the diagnosis when psychogenic nonepileptic seizures are suspected.\nEEG monitoring is frequently performed in the inpatient setting within a hospital's epilepsy monitoring unit (EMU), but in some cases, portable EEGs may be used in the outpatient setting for seizure monitoring.\nNeuroimaging.\nBrain imaging is recommended in most cases of new-onset unprovoked seizures to identify structural abnormalities that may predispose to epilepsy. Imaging techniques include:\nAdult patients with first-time seizures who have a suspected intracranial lesion or red-flag symptoms (e.g. focal deficits, altered mental status, fever, severe headache) should immediately receive a noncontrast head CT.\nWhen CT findings are normal in patients with a first unprovoked seizure, a follow-up MRI is recommended because it may detect epileptogenic lesions not visible on CT.\nDifferential diagnosis.\nSeveral conditions can mimic epileptic seizures and must be considered, including the following:\nDifferentiating these conditions from epileptic seizures relies on careful history-taking, examination, EEG findings, and, when necessary, additional cardiac, metabolic, or psychiatric evaluations.\nManagement.\nManagement of seizures depends on the clinical context, including whether the seizure is isolated or part of an ongoing epileptic disorder, and whether it is provoked or unprovoked.\nFirst aid during a seizure.\nBasic first aid during a tonic-clonic seizure focuses on ensuring the person's safety and preventing injury:\nEmergency services should also be called if a person has multiple consecutive seizures, has trouble breathing or awakening afterward, becomes injured, is submerged in water, has a first-time seizure, has diabetes, or is pregnant.\nFor nonconvulsive seizures (such as absence seizures or focal impaired consciousness seizures), active physical first aid is often unnecessary. In these cases, observers should ensure the person is safe from harm, gently guide them away from danger if needed, and offer support and reassurance as they regain awareness.\nEmergency medical treatment.\nIf a convulsive seizure lasts longer than five minutes or if repeated seizures occur without full recovery between events, the situation is classified as status epilepticus, a medical emergency requiring rapid intervention. In emergency care, the first-line therapy for status epilepticus is the administration of a benzodiazepine to terminate the seizure, with most guidelines recommending lorazepam, midazolam or diazepam. Early benzodiazepine treatment is associated with better seizure control and improved outcomes. Even in shorter seizures that do not require use of benzodiazepines, intravenous access is usually established in case of multiple seizure episodes or seizure prolongation.\nIf seizures persist despite benzodiazepine administration (second-line therapy), an intravenous antiseizure medication is given. Recommended options include fosphenytoin, valproate, or levetiracetam, depending on patient-specific factors and institutional protocols. In cases of refractory status epilepticus (seizures continuing despite first- and second-line treatments), patients typically require intensive care unit management. This involves continuous EEG monitoring and administration of anesthetic agents such as propofol or continuous infusion of midazolam.\nPrompt recognition and treatment of status epilepticus are critical to prevent permanent neuronal injury, systemic complications, and death.\nManagement of provoked seizures.\nIf a seizure is provoked by an acute reversible cause, treatment focuses on addressing the underlying condition. Long-term antiseizure medications are typically not needed once the acute cause has been resolved, unless seizures recur.\nManagement after unprovoked seizures.\nAfter a first unprovoked seizure, management depends on assessing the risk of recurrence. Antiseizure medication may be considered after a single event if risk factors for epilepsy are identified, such as epileptiform abnormalities on EEG or structural lesions on MRI. In other cases, careful observation may be appropriate.\nLong-term management of epilepsy.\nLong-term management applies to individuals diagnosed with epilepsy. The goals are seizure control, minimizing adverse effects, and optimizing quality of life.\nIt is recommended to start with one anti-seizure medication. Another may be added if one is not enough to control the seizure occurrence. Approximately 70% of people can obtain full control with continuous use of medication. The type of medication used is based on the type of seizure.\nPatients with acute repetitive seizures (also known as \"seizure clusters\") have recurrent seizures within 6-24 hours of the first episode and are at an increased risk of developing status epilepticus. They are often prescribed rescue benzodiazepines in the form of rectal gels or nasal sprays for at-home use during emergencies.\nAnti-seizure medications may be slowly stopped after some time if a person has just experienced one seizure and has not had any more. The decision to stop anti-seizure medications should be discussed between the doctor and patient, weighing the benefits and risks.\nIn severe cases where seizures are uncontrolled by at least two anti-seizure medications, brain surgery can be a treatment option. Epilepsy surgery is especially useful for those with focal seizures, where the seizures are coming from a specific part of the brain. The amount of brain removed during the surgery depends on the extent of the brain involved in the seizures. It can range from just removing one lobe of the brain (temporal lobectomy) to disconnecting an entire side of the brain (hemispherectomy). The procedure can be curative, where seizures are eliminated. However, if it is not curative, it can be palliative, reducing the frequency of seizures but not eliminating them.\nAnother intervention for refractory epilepsy is vagus nerve stimulation (VNS), which involves insertion of an electrical device that stimulates the left vagus nerve. Its mechanism of action is not fully understood. VNS is contraindicated in patients with cardiac conduction problems, sleep apnea, and should be avoided in patients with programmable shunt valves. The most common side effect associated with VNS is hoarseness, and side effects usually improve over time or with decreased levels of stimulation.\nOther.\nHelmets may be used to protect the head during a seizure. Some claim that seizure response dogs, a form of service dog, can predict seizures. Evidence for this, however, is poor. Cannabis has also been used for the management of seizures that do not respond to anti-seizure medications. Research on its effectiveness is ongoing, but current research shows that it does reduce seizure frequency. A ketogenic diet or modified Atkins diet may help in those who have epilepsy who do not improve following typical treatments, with evidence for its effectiveness growing.\nPrognosis.\nThe prognosis after a first seizure depends on the underlying cause, seizure type, and patient-specific factors. In general, individuals who experience a single provoked seizure due to an acute and reversible cause (such as hypoglycemia or head trauma) have a low risk of recurrence once the underlying issue is treated. Following a first unprovoked seizure, the risk of more seizures in the next two years is around 40%. Starting anti-seizure medications reduces the recurrence of seizures by 35% within the first two years. The greatest predictors of more seizures are problems either on the EEG or on imaging of the brain. Those with normal EEG and normal physical exam following a first unprovoked seizure had less risk of recurrence in the next two years, with a risk of 25%. In adults, after 6 months of being seizure-free after a first seizure, the risk of a subsequent seizure in the next year is less than 20% regardless of treatment. The prognosis of epilepsy depends on seizure type, cause, and treatment response. About two-thirds of patients achieve seizure control with medication, while surgery or neuromodulation may help those with drug-resistant epilepsy.\nEpidemiology.\nSeizures are relatively common neurological events, with an estimated lifetime risk of experiencing at least one seizure approaching 8-10% within the general population. However, not all seizures are indicative of epilepsy; numerous episodes are provoked by transient factors such as infections, metabolic abnormalities, or trauma. In adults, the risk of seizure recurrence within the five years following a new-onset seizure is 35%; the risk rises to 75% in persons who have had a second seizure. In children, the risk of seizure recurrence within the five years following a single unprovoked seizure is about 50%; the risk rises to about 80% after two unprovoked seizures. In the United States in 2011, seizures resulted in an estimated 1.6 million emergency department visits; approximately 400,000 of these visits were for new-onset seizures.\nGlobal variations exist, with higher rates of seizures and epilepsy reported in regions with elevated prevalence of risk factors such as central nervous system infections, traumatic brain injury, and limited access to perinatal care. Seizures contribute significantly to the global burden of neurological disease, affecting individuals' quality of life, social participation, and access to education and employment.\nHistory.\nSeizures have been recognized throughout recorded history. Early descriptions date back to ancient Mesopotamia around 2000 BCE, where seizures were often attributed to supernatural causes or demonic possession. Similar beliefs persisted across ancient cultures, including in Egypt, India, and Greece. In the 5th century BCE, the physician Hippocrates challenged supernatural explanations in his treatise \"On the Sacred Disease\", proposing that epilepsy was a disorder of the brain. However, stigma surrounding seizures remained widespread for centuries.\nSociety and culture.\nEconomics.\nSeizures result in direct economic costs of about one billion dollars in the United States. Epilepsy results in economic costs in Europe of around \u20ac15.5\u00a0billion in 2004. In India, epilepsy is estimated to result in costs of US$1.7\u00a0billion or 0.5% of the GDP. They make up about 1% of emergency department visits (2% for emergency departments for children) in the United States.\nResearch.\nMuch of recent epilepsy research has been focused on identifying causes for seizures, predicting them, and preventing their onset. \nSome types of seizures occur due to genetic mutations, such as those found in ion channels. Current genetic epilepsy research is aimed at identifying genetic risk factors, understanding mutations, and developing genetic therapies. The development of next-generation sequencing has significantly advanced the understanding of gene-driven epilepsies. Presently, there are experiments using stem cells for the study and management of genetic epilepsy.\nSeizure prediction is a special case of seizure detection in which the developed systems can issue a warning before the clinical onset of the epileptic seizure. Recently, biomarkers have been used for seizure prediction and prevention. These are methods of measuring changes that occur in patients with seizures to differentiate them from people without seizures. One example of biomarkers is the use of microelectrodes, which can be used to monitor abnormal electrical brain activity. Another example is diffusion tensor imaging MRI, which can show differences in structural connectivity in individuals with epilepsy.\nThere are ongoing investigations to identify mechanisms to treat seizures, with the most promising recent discoveries involving the mTOR pathway and the cytokine IL-1\u00df. Several other structures and cells are also the topic of study, including cellular membrane proteins, components of the blood-brain barrier, glial cells, and antibodies. For treatment of genetic disorders, a process called transfection involves the use of vectors to deliver pieces of genetic material to areas of the brain involved in seizure onset.\nComputational neuroscience has brought a new perspective on seizures by considering the dynamical aspects.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "27155", "revid": "7903804", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27155", "title": "Svenska Akademiens ordlista", "text": "Swedish dictionary\nSvenska Akademiens ordlista (, \"Word list of the Swedish Academy\"), abbreviated SAOL, is a spelling dictionary published every few years by the Swedish Academy. It is a single volume that is considered the final arbiter of Swedish spelling. Traditionally it carries the motto of the Swedish Academy, \"Snille och Smak\" (\"Talent and Taste\"), on its blue cloth cover.\nWhenever a new edition comes out lively discussions about new and changed entries erupt around the country. In some instances the Academy has been ahead of its times and has later had to change entries back to older spellings. \"Jos\" \u2013 \"juice\" is probably the most well-known instance. In 2015, the fourteenth edition (containing entries) was published.\nHistory.\nThe history of SAOL is the history of orthography of the Swedish language. While Swedish spelling was an entirely personal business in the Catholic Middle Ages, its gradual standardization (known as Modern Swedish) started in 1526 with the translation of the New testament of the Bible (\"Gustav Vasa Bible\"), as part of the Lutheran reformation. The edition was revised in 1703, known as the Swedish Bible of Carolus XII. The Swedish Academy was founded in 1786 with the task of caring for Swedish literature and language, including the publication of a grand dictionary. Spelling evolved slowly in the 18th century and was largely based on etymology: for instance, because of its historic relationship to English \"heart\" and German \"Herz\", \"hj\u00e4rta\" was spelled \"hjerta\" in Swedish even though it's pronounced ; the word for \"woman\" (now \"kvinna\") was spelled \"qvinna\", similar to English \"queen\"; the question words \"hvad\", \"hvar\", \"hvilken\" had a silent H, like English \"what\", \"where\", \"which\" still have in most accents. In 1801 the Academy published an official orthography (Carl Gustaf af Leopold, \"Afhandling om svenska stafs\u00e4ttet\", 266 pages). A shorter version for schools was published by Carl Jonas Love Almqvist, \"Svensk R\u00e4ttstafnings-L\u00e4ra\" in 1829.\nAlready in the 1750s, voices had been raised to adapt spelling to pronunciation, but this didn't resonate with the conservatively minded Academy. Public schools were made mandatory in Sweden by law in 1842 and the influence of school teachers increased, as did the pressure to reform Swedish spelling. The most radical reformists wanted to do away with all silent letters and change the remaining ones to a smaller subset of the alphabet. A similar reform movement for Danish, which at this time was the written language also in Norway, was led by Rasmus Rask (1787\u20131832) and his follower Niels Matthias Petersen (1791\u20131862). In 1869 a pan-Scandinavian orthography congress (\"Nordiska r\u00e4ttstavningsm\u00f6tet\") gathered in Stockholm. Secretary for the Swedish section was Artur Hazelius, who in 1871 published the proceedings of the conference. The Academy was not pleased, and as a countermeasure Johan Erik Rydqvist (1800\u20131877) published the first edition of SAOL in 1874, based on the orthography in Leopold's work of 1801. A second edition followed in the same year and new ones in 1875, 1880 and the 5th edition in 1883, without much change.\nTo further reform, a Swedish orthographic society (\"Svenska r\u00e4ttstavningss\u00e4llskapet\") was formed on November 28, 1885, chaired by linguist Adolf Noreen (1854\u20131925), and published a journal \"Nystavaren. Tidskrift f\u00f6r r\u00e4ttskrivningsfr\u00e5gor\" (4 volumes, 1886\u20131898, edited by Otto Hoppe). There was continued opposition, not least from Academy member Esaias Tegn\u00e9r Jr. (1843\u20131928). However, many of the proposed changes, albeit far from all, were introduced in the 6th edition of SAOL in 1889. Many words spelled with E were changed to \u00c4 (\"elf\" \u2192 \"\u00e4lf\", \"hjerta\" \u2192 \"hj\u00e4rta\", \"jern\" \u2192 \"j\u00e4rn\"), and under Q it was stated that Q may at will be replaced with K. By a government resolution on November 16, 1889, the spelling used in this edition of SAOL was to be used for teaching in Swedish high schools (\"allm\u00e4nna l\u00e4roverk\") and teacher colleges (\"seminarier\"). This was a direct blow against the society's own dictionary published in 1886, and reform movement lost much of its momentum. In the 7th edition of SAOL in 1900, many of the old optional forms with Q were dropped.\nIn 1898, school teachers started to sign mass petitions for further reform. In 1903, the association of Swedish public school teachers (\"Sveriges allm\u00e4nna folkskoll\u00e4rarf\u00f6rening\") requested a government ruling that it \"would no longer be considered wrong\" (\"ej m\u00e5tte betraktas som fel\") to write TT instead of DT and V instead of F, FV and HV. More associations joined this petition in 1905. A government proposal to this effect was signed on April 7, 1906, by education minister Fridtjuv Berg (1851\u20131916), and put before the parliament of 1907. A protest against the reform signed by 40,000 concerned citizens was handed to the government in 1908, but had no effect. The liberal Fridtjuv Berg was a former school teacher and one of the founding members of the orthographic society.\nThe reform of 1906 was the most radical in the history of Swedish orthography. Spelling with dt, fv and hv is now commonly known as \"old spelling\" (\"gammalstavning\"). The new spelling was adopted in schools starting in 1907. It was used from the first edition of Selma Lagerl\u00f6f's geography textbook \"Nils Holgerssons underbara resa genom Sverige\" (1906, \"The Wonderful Adventures of Nils\"). The proceedings of the Swedish parliament adopted the new spelling from the year 1913. After endless discussions through the 19th century, a new Swedish Bible translation was finally adopted in 1917, using the new spelling. Sweden's largest printed encyclopedia of all times, the 2nd edition of \"Nordisk familjebok\" was started in 1904 and used the old spelling through all 38 volumes until 1926. The Academy introduced the new spelling in the 8th edition of SAOL in 1923. The 9th edition appeared in 1950.\nIn the 10th edition in 1973, the Academy tried to launch new alternative spellings such as \"jos\" (\"juice\"), without attracting any significant number of followers. The 11th edition of SAOL appeared in 1986 and the 12th edition in 1998. While the letter Q in the 8th edition only listed the letter Q itself, the 11th edition also listed \"quantum satis\", \"quenell\", \"quilt\" and \"quisling\".\nFrom the beginning of times, W had in Swedish been considered as a mere decoration of V. In Swedish typography, blackletter (\"fraktur\") used W where antiqua used V. With orthographic standardization and spelling reform, W was abandoned except for some proper names and a few loan words such as \"whisky\", \"wobbler\" (also spelled \"visky\" and \"vobbler\"), \"whist\" and \"wienerbr\u00f6d\". In Swedish dictionaries and telephone books, V and W have been sorted as one letter. In the 13th edition of SAOL in 2006, the Academy broke with this tradition, listing W as a letter of its own. This change was sparked by a new influx of loan words such as \"webb\" (\"World Wide Web\").\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

SSE offers BSc, MSc and MBA programs, along with PhD- and Executive education programs.\nSSE is accredited by EQUIS and is a member of CEMS. SSE has founded sister organizations: SSE Riga in Riga, Latvia, and SSE Russia in St Petersburg and Moscow, Russia. It also operates \"the European Institute of Japanese Studies \"(Japanese, kanji: \u6b27\u5dde\u65e5\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u6240,\" \"Japanese, romaji: \u014csh\u016b Nihon kenky\u016bjo), a research institute in Tokyo, Japan.\nHistory.\nThe banker Knut Agathon Wallenberg donated 100 000 SEK in 1903 (Equivalent to around 7 million SEK in 2023) to lobby for founding a business school in Stockholm. Wallenberg considered that \"It was important to raise the social status of the merchant class\". Lobbying was necessary because the classical tradition in western thought has a long-standing disdain for commerce, dating back to the ancient Greeks. This disdain was also evident during the Middle Ages, when trade was considered equivalent to theft and seen as a dirty and vulgar occupation. During this time, merchants were known in swedish as: \"Kr\u00e4mare\", from the greek chrema (money), were socially scorned, even by the upper class, and were perceived as unproductive individuals solely interested in \"making money.\". \nContinuing the lobbying the Wallenberg family also financed a study trip where the doctor in philosophy Helmer Keys set out to travel through Europe to collect data that could motivate the decision to establish a business school. This resulted in the report called \"on the centrality of trade-schools (Swedish: Om betydelsen av handelsh\u00f6gskolor\", where Key presented the founding of a business school as both positive and necessary. The report was subsequently used to propagate for the centrality of founding a business school in Stockholm. \nLater on, a circular letter was written where people from the Stockholm Bourgeoisie was offered to pay 400 SEK per year to become initiating members of the school of business association (Handelsh\u00f6gskolef\u00f6reningen). In an appendix to a deed of foundation published by the school of business Association, the founding members up to 28 February 1907 are listed. The founders consisted of 109 merchants, 47 bank directors or similar, 26 mill owners or similar, 9 engineers, 16 other city councillors, barons or similar, and three companies. Most of the members were men, but one person was female. Two families were overrepresented, namely the S\u00f6derberg and Wallenberg families. The founders were predominantly based in Stockholm, Djursholm, or Saltsj\u00f6baden. However, the academic background among the school's founders was almost entirely nonexistent. \nThe name \"handelsh\u00f6gskola\" (roughly \"college of commerce\") was a parallel to the German term \"Handelshochschule\", used by a number of German institutions started in the years before, commencing with Handelshochschule Leipzig in 1898. The term \"h\u00f6gskola\" was at this time also established for specialised higher educational institutions outside the universities, such as the Royal Institute of Technology, \"(Kungl.) Tekniska h\u00f6gskolan\", which bore that name from 1877. The Stockholm School of Economics was formally founded in 1909 on private initiative as a response to rapid industrialization and a growing need for educated businessmen and company managers and has maintained close ties with the business community ever since.\nWhile founded as a business school, the subject of economics featured prominently in the research and curriculum of the school from the beginning.\nThe most well known scholars of the Stockholm School of Economics are arguably the economists Eli Heckscher (professor of economics and statistics 1909\u20131929, professor of economic history 1929\u20131945), and Bertil Ohlin (professors of economics). Heckscher is also known as the founder of economic history as an independent academic discipline and his work \"Svenskt Arbete och Liv\" is a fundamental work within this subject.\nOhlin was also a leading figure within the school of doctrine with the same name, the so-called Stockholm school; a group of leading Scandinavian economists influenced by Knut Wicksell, most of them active in Stockholm, either at the Stockholm School of Economics or the Stockholm University College. This school of doctrine was to have a profound influence on post-WWII Swedish economic policy and the development of the modern Scandinavian welfare state. Heckscher and Ohlin jointly developed the so-called \"Heckscher\u2013Ohlin theory\", the standard international mathematical model of international trade. Bertil Ohlin received the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1977 (shared with British economist James Meade). Other prominent members of the Stockholm school were the Stockholm University professor Gustav Cassel, who developed standard economic theory of Purchasing power parity and economist Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld, Secretary-General of the United Nations in New York City, United States.\nThe school is a full member of the Association of Professional Schools of International Affairs (APSIA), a group of schools of public policy, public administration, and international studies.\nAcademics.\nAdmission.\nFor Master programmes, applicants have to have a GMAT score of over 600 and a TOEFL iBT score of over 100 in order to be considered suitable for applying.\nIn the academic year 2012/2013 the university received 3261 applications for the four Masters programmes which it offered at the time. Therefore, the according acceptance rate would have been low.\nGrading.\nSSE uses a 5-grading scale which includes the following, Excellent (5.0), Very Good (4.0), Good (3.5), Pass (3.0) and Fail (0.0). A Grade Point Average (GPA) is giving between 3.0 and 5.0. There is also a possibility to obtain an award, Outstanding Achievement, which implies that the student gets at least Excellent as final grade, and that it's the first time the student are taking the course. The person responsible for the course have the opportunity to award up to 10% of the students with Outstanding Achievement. The award does not impact the calculation of the student's Grade Point Average (GPA). Furthermore, the 10 percent of students with the highest GPA in the BSc programmes who complete the studies on time, that is, no later than three years after they were enrolled, receive the President's list award. Completion of studies on time entails having completed all courses in connection with the examination retake period in August at the latest.\nProgrammes.\nStockholm School of Economics offers the following programmes:\nThe educational programmes are mostly conducted in English. However, there are some elective courses given in Swedish at bachelor's- and master's programmes as well as the SSE Executive Education.\nBachelor's programmes.\nSSE Bachelor of Science in Business and Economics.\nThe Bachelor of Science in Business and Economics is a three-year program (180 ECTS credits). The BSc in Business and Economics is a program designed for students with an interest in a broad business education, including subjects as economics, finance, accounting, marketing, management, entrepreneurship, data analytics, business law and strategy. The program makes you eligible to study a MSc at the Stockholm School of Economics or another university in Sweden or abroad. Yearly, roughly 300 students are enrolled in the BE programme.\nSSE Bachelor of Science in Retail Management.\nThe Bachelor of Science in Retail Management is a three-year program (180 ECTS credits). The BSc in Retail Management is a specialised program focused mainly on retailing. During the third year of the program students are taking an Applied retail track where theory and practice are combined. BSc in Retail Management makes you eligible to most of the MSc programmes at SSE and also other MSc programmes in Sweden or abroad. Compared to SSE's Business and Economics programme the Retail Management programme offers fewer student places, 60 opposed to 300.\nMaster's programmes.\nSSE Master of Science in Business and Management.\nThe Master of Science in Business and Management is a two-year program (120 ECTS credits). There are offered three specializations: International Business (CEMS), Management and Marketing &amp; Media Management. Within their specialization, students write a Master's thesis worth 30 ECTS credits.\nSSE Master of Science in Economics.\nThe MSc in Economics is a program designed for students with a background in economics or business. As well as the other master programs it is a two-year program with 120 ECTS. There are offered two specializations: Applied Economic Analysis and International Economics.\nSSE Master of Science in Finance.\nThe MSc in Finance is a program designed for students with a background in finance or business.

Students may also apply for a double degree with a CEMS Msc in International Management degree.\nMBA programme.\nSSE Masters of Business Administration (MBA), Executive Format.\nThe SSE EMBA program was launched in 2001. Since 2001, the year the Financial Times began its Executive MBA ranking, the SSE Executive MBA has been the first in the Nordic league. Worldwide its average rank in the last three years was 56.\nPhD programmes.\nSSE PhD in Business Administration, Economics, Finance.\nThe SSE PhD Program was launched more than 60 years ago and has graduated more than 500 PhDs. There are three separate PhD programs at SSE:\nStudent life.\nThe Student Association at the Stockholm School of Economics (SASSE, ; abbreviated HHSS) is the chief organ of student government at SSE. The student association is organized into eight committees with different responsibilities. The committees are the following:\nEach committee is headed by a president, who is also a member of the board of the student association. Moreover, there is a president of the whole SASSE who are elected each year by the students at the school.\nAlumni.\nStockholm School of Economics (SSE) alumni are defined as previous students that have graduated from one of SSE's degree programs. Today, there are some 14 000 alumni in this network. In addition to the alumni are the so-called \"SSE IFL Networkers,\" previous participants at IFL open or custom programs, these sum up to an additional 10 000.\nSSE maintains contacts with its alumni in a number of different ways; both through direct and indirect contacts and through various types of communication channels. Contacts are administered through the \"SSE Alumni Office\".\nToday, many alumni are involved in the school's advisory board, the alumni association's board, the Student Association \"et al.\", all aligned to SSE activities. Even more alumni return to the School as guest lectures, or sponsors of course projects, as suppliers of internship opportunities, or as recruiters from large companies.\nCurrently, if an alumnus wishes to connect with another SSE graduate, they have five primary options:\n1. Attending the alumni events arranged by SSE Alumni Office\n2. Networking through the \"SSE Alumninet,\" a web portal open to holders of an SSE diploma. Alumninet had some 14 000 members as of January 2013, or through the official LinkedIn groups maintained by SSE\n3. Membership in \"the Alumni Association of the Stockholm School of Economics\" \u2013 an alumni association sponsored and organized by alumni for Swedish-speaking graduates of SSE \u2013 or by joining \"the American Friends of SSE\" \u2013 an affiliated alumni group, based in the US.\n4. Joining any of the unofficial alumni groups and networks, maintained by the alumni themselves, e.g. in the UK.\nPartner Universities.\nSSE has about 70 partner universities and each academic year, SSE sends over 180 students abroad on exchange and hosts over 180 exchange students from all over the world. The majority of the exchange places are part of the Master's program, but some places are offered at the Bachelor's level.

With over 33,000 students at four different faculties: law, humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences, it is one of the largest universities in Scandinavia. \nStockholm University was granted university status in 1960, making it the fourth oldest Swedish university. As with other public universities in Sweden, Stockholm University's mission includes teaching and research anchored in society at large.\nHistory.\nThe initiative for the formation of Stockholm University was taken by the Stockholm City Council. The process was completed after a decision in December 1865 regarding the establishment of a fund and a committee to \"establish a higher education institution in the capital\". The nine members of the committee were respected and prominent citizens whose work had helped the evolution of science and society.\nThe next important step was taken in October 1869, when the Stockholm University College Association was established. Several members of the committee became members of the association\u00a0\u2013 including Professor Pehr Henrik Malmsten. The association's mission was to establish a college in Stockholm and would \"not be dissolved until the college came into being and its future could be considered secure.\" The memorandum of the Stockholm University College was adopted in May 1877, and in the autumn semester of the following year, actual operations began.\nIn 1878, the university college \"Stockholms h\u00f6gskola\" started its operations with a series of lectures on natural sciences, open to curious citizens (a tradition still upheld by yearly publicly open lectures). Notable in the university's early history is the appointment of Sofia Kovalevskaya to hold a chair in the mathematics department in 1889, making her the third female professor in Europe. In 1904 the college became an official degree-granting institution.\nIn 1960, the college was granted university status, becoming Sweden's fourth state university. The university premises were situated in central Stockholm at \"Observatorielunden\" but increased enrollment resulted in a lack of space, which required the university campus to be shifted to a bigger facility. Since 1970 most of the university operations are located at the main campus at Frescati north of the city center, the former Experimentalf\u00e4ltet, previously used by the Royal Swedish Academy of Agriculture and Forestry.\nOrganisation.\nStockholm University is a state agency and is governed by decisions taken by the government and parliament. The university has the right, within the limits the government provides, to decide on many issues such as their internal organization, educational provision and the admission of students.\nInternational collaboration.\nThe university is an active member of the University of the Arctic. UArctic is an international cooperative network based in the Circumpolar Arctic region, consisting of more than 200 universities, colleges, and other organizations with an interest in promoting education and research in the Arctic region.\nThe university also participates in UArctic's mobility program north2north. The aim of that program is to enable students of member institutions to study in different parts of the North.\nDepartments, institutes and centers.\nEducation and research at Stockholm University is carried out within the natural sciences and the humanities/social sciences. Within these fields, there are four faculties with 56 departments, institutes and centers within the humanities, law, natural sciences and social sciences. Research and training also takes place at a number of centers and institutes with a separate governing board, but that organisationally belong to a department.\nCourses and programmes.\n Stockholm University offers courses at both undergraduate and advanced level. There are 190 study programmes in total, including 75 master's programmes taught in English, and 1,700 courses to choose from within human science and science. Students can choose between studying one or more free-standing courses, that each may last between five weeks and one semester, or apply for a full study programme. Stockholm university offers 4 Bachelor Programmes taught in English, which are the Bachelor\u00b4s Programme in Business, Ethics and Sustainability; Bachelor Programme in Latin America Studies; Bachelor\u00b4s Programme in International Business and Politics and the Bachelor\u00b4s Programme in Earth Science, Distance Learning.\nBesides the programmes themselves, the university also offers opportunities for foreign exchange studies during the third year of a bachelor's degree programme. The university has cooperative agreements with more than 100 universities worldwide.\nResearch.\nThe university's researchers engage in governmental investigations, are active in the media, provide responses to proposed legislation and are included in several Nobel committees and international expert bodies. \nField stations.\nStockholm University Marine Research center (SMF) provides \"Ask\u00f6 Laboratory\", where Research on ecosystems, ecology and the impact of human interference is carried out. The field station was built in 1961 by Professor Lars Sil\u00e9n, Head of the Department of Zoology, and is now established as a renowned marine research center.\nTarfala research station belongs to the Department of Physical Geography. The station is located 1135 meters above sea level in Tarfaladalen, on the east side of Kebnekaise in arctic / alpine surroundings and conducts glaciological, hydrological, meteorological and climatological research. The station has the capacity to accommodate groups of up to 25 people and the staff consists of 2\u20135 people.\nTovetorp Zoological Research Station belongs to the Department of Zoology, and is located about 95\u00a0km southwest of Stockholm. It conducts research and training activities in ecology and ethology. Every year Tovetorp is visited by up to 600 students who live and study between 2\u201310 days on the station. On the research side, over 20 people work today with different research projects. The number of employees are currently 6 people.\nStudent unions.\nPrior to 2008, Stockholm University had only one student union called Stockholm University Student Union \"(Stockholm universitets studentk\u00e5r, SUS)\". However, since 2008 the computer and system science students and the teacher students have their own, independent, student unions called DISK and \"The Teacher's College's Student Union\" \"(L\u00e4rarh\u00f6gskolans studentk\u00e5r)\". The law students also have their own student union, as do journalism students (\"Studentk\u00e5ren vid JMK\").\nThe future of the Teacher's College's Student Union is however not entirely safe, as Stockholm University's Student Union has declared it will begin talks with the Teacher's College's Student Union on transferring its members to it, as it already has a teacher's division. In contrast to common belief, DISK is not an abbreviation.\nRankings.\nIn the Academic Ranking of World Universities 2020, an annual publication of university rankings by Shanghai Ranking Consultancy/Academic Ranking of World Universities, Stockholm University was placed as the 69th overall best university worldwide.\nThe Times Higher Education (THE) World University Rankings 2018 listed Stockholm University at position 134 on the list of the world's top universities. Times Higher Education World University Rankings are annual university rankings published by British Times Higher Education (THE) magazine.\nIn the QS World University Rankings, Stockholm University was ranked 148 overall in the world in 2021. Its subject rankings were: 23rd in Environmental Sciences, 37th in Sociology, 98th in Natural Sciences, 132nd in Arts &amp; Humanities, 238th in Life Sciences &amp; Medicine, 297th in Engineering and Technology, and 175th in Social Sciences and Management.\nIn the U.S. News &amp; World Report Rankings, Stockholm University was ranked 114 overall in the world in 2021, 4 in Sweden and 43 within Europe.\nIn the CWTS Leiden Ranking 2022, Stockholm University was placed at 343 on the list of universities in the world.\nCampus.\nThe main part of Stockholm University is in the Frescati area, which extends from the Bergius Botanical Garden in the north to Sveaplan in the south. It is located in the world's first national urban park and the area is characterized by nature, architecture and modern art, featuring such notable buildings as the Aula Magna (auditorium). Within Frescati, the areas Albano, the Bergius Botanical Garden, Frescati Backe, Frescati Hage, Kr\u00e4ftriket, Lilla Frescati and Sveaplan are located. The names of many of these areas have a history dating back to the late 1700s. After Gustav III's trip to Italy in 1783\u201384, several places at Brunnsviken were given Italian names. Stockholm University has another campus in Kista, which houses the Department of computer and systems sciences.\nPublic transportation to Stockholm University.\nThere are many ways to get to Stockholm University. The main campus Frescati is located near the underground railway station Universitetet metro station, on the red line of the Stockholm Metro. The commuter train line Roslagsbanan also stop close to the main campus, at Universitetet railway station. SL buses 50, 540, 608, 624C, 628C, 639, 670 676, 680, 690, 691, 696 and 699 can also be used to get to the campus.\nThe Computer Science campus, Kista, also is close to an underground station called Kista. It is also located close to the pendelt\u00e5g station Helenelund, only one or two stops (depending on bus line) from the bus station Torsn\u00e4sgatan located next to the campus area.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Its name derives from the location of the original Metropolitan Police headquarters at 4 Whitehall Place, which had its main public entrance on the Westminster street called Great Scotland Yard. The Scotland Yard entrance became the public entrance, and over time \"Scotland Yard\" came to be used not only as the common name of the headquarters building, but also as a metonym for the Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) itself and police officers, especially detectives, who serve in it. \"The New York Times\" wrote in 1964 that, just as Wall Street gave its name to New York's financial district, Scotland Yard became the name for police activity in London.\nThe force moved from Great Scotland Yard in 1890, to a newly completed building on the Victoria Embankment, and the name \"New Scotland Yard\" was adopted for the new headquarters. An adjacent building was completed in 1906. A third building was added in 1940. In 1967 the MPS consolidated its headquarters from the three-building complex to a tall, newly constructed \"New Scotland Yard\" building on Broadway in nearby Victoria. In 2013, it was announced that the force would move again to the Victoria Embankment at Westminster's Curtis Green Building, which following tradition was renamed \"New Scotland Yard\". This move to the latest New Scotland Yard was completed in 2016.\nHistory.\nThe Metropolitan Police Service is responsible for law enforcement within Greater London, excluding the square mile of the City of London, which is covered by the City of London Police, and also excluding the London Underground and National Rail networks, which are the responsibility of the British Transport Police.\n4 Whitehall Place.\nThe Metropolitan Police was formed by Robert Peel with the implementation of the Metropolitan Police Act, passed by Parliament in 1829. Peel, with the help of Eug\u00e8ne-Fran\u00e7ois Vidocq, selected the original site on Whitehall Place for the new police headquarters. The first two commissioners, Charles Rowan and Richard Mayne, along with various police officers and staff, occupied the building. Previously a private house, 4 Whitehall Place () backed onto a street called Great Scotland Yard. The building now on the site of 4 Whitehall Place (the 1950s rear extension to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food) still has a rear entrance on Great Scotland Yard. \nBy 1887, the Metropolitan Police headquarters had expanded from 4 Whitehall Place into several neighbouring addresses, including 3, 5, 21 and 22 Whitehall Place and several stables, including one at 7 Great Scotland Yard still in use by the mounted branch. These also included buildings which fronted onto the north side of Great Scotland Yard, with the address of 8 and 9 Great Scotland Yard, sometimes shown on maps as a station or \"police office\" on A Division but actually used from 1842 as the central headquarters of the new Detective Branch. Those buildings were damaged in an 1884 Fenian bomb attack and are now lost under the former Central London Recruiting Office, which was acquired by hypermarkets operator Lulu Group International in 2015 and reopened as a Hyatt luxury hotel four years later.\nVictoria Embankment.\nIn the 1880s the force decided that it had outgrown its original site, and moved to a new headquarters designed by architect Richard Norman Shaw () on the Victoria Embankment, overlooking the River Thames, south of what is now the Ministry of Defence's headquarters. In 1888, during the construction of the new building, workers discovered the dismembered torso of a female; the case, known as the 'Whitehall Mystery', was never solved. In 1890, police headquarters moved to the new location, which was named New Scotland Yard. By this time, the Metropolitan Police had grown from its initial 1,000 officers to about 13,000 and needed more administrative staff and a bigger headquarters. Further increases in the size and responsibilities of the force required even more administrators and space. Therefore, new buildings were constructed and completed in 1906 and 1940, so that New Scotland Yard became a three-building complex. (). The first two buildings are now a Grade I listed structure known as the Norman Shaw Buildings.\n10 Broadway.\nThe headquarters of the Metropolitan Police were moved to 8\u201310 Broadway in 1967, in a new building constructed on a site that also bordered onto Victoria Street.\nIn 2008, the Metropolitan Police Authority (MPA) bought the freehold of 10 Broadway for around \u00a3120 million.\n10 Broadway was sold to the Abu Dhabi Financial Group in December 2014 for \u00a3370 million, and redevelopment plans for a six-building, mixed-use development were approved in February 2016. Ownership was officially passed from the MPA to the Abu Dhabi Financial Group when the relocation was completed on 31 October 2016; the building began demolition later that year.\nCurrent location.\nIn May 2013, the Metropolitan Police confirmed that the New Scotland Yard building on Broadway would be sold and the force's headquarters would be moved back to the Curtis Green Building on the Victoria Embankment. A competition was announced for architects to redesign the building prior to the Metropolitan Police moving to it in 2015. This building previously housed the Territorial Policing headquarters and is adjacent to the original New Scotland Yard (Norman Shaw North Building).\nIn December 2015, construction work on the exterior of the Curtis Green building was completed. On 31 October 2016, the Metropolitan Police staff left the building at 10 Broadway and moved to their new headquarters. The new New Scotland Yard building was to have been opened by Queen Elizabeth II on 23 March 2017, but that same day it was announced that the Royal opening would be postponed, due to the preceding day's terrorist attack at Westminster. The opening was re-arranged for 13 July 2017. Like all three of its predecessors it houses the Met's Crime Museum (formerly known as the Black Museum), founded in 1874, a collection of criminal memorabilia not open to the public.\nPopular culture.\nScotland Yard has appeared in books, films, and television since the Victorian era when it featured in the Jack the Ripper cases and the stories of Sherlock Holmes. Wilkie Collins's novel \"The Moonstone\" (1868), a tale of a Scotland Yard Detective investigating the theft of a valuable diamond, has been described as perhaps the earliest clear example of the police procedural genre. In Robert Louis Stevenson's gothic novella \"Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde\" (1886), Inspector Newcomen, a Scotland Yard Detective, explores Hyde's loft in Soho and discovers evidence of his depraved life.\nAlfred Hitchcock's 1929 thriller film \"Blackmail\" (widely considered the first British \"\") features a Scotland Yard Detective Frank Webber (played by John Longden). \nScotland Yard appears in the 1972 episode of Columbo, \"Dagger of the Mind\". Columbo visits Scotland Yard to study the investigative techniques they use in London before becoming involved as a consultant for a murder case.\nIn Monty Python's 1969 comedy sketch \"The Funniest Joke in the World\", Graham Chapman plays a Scotland Yard Inspector who leaves the house with the joke in hand before dying from laughter.\nScotland Yard has also appeared in the Professor Layton series as supporting characters, which Layton helped them in solving many cases. Inspector Chelmey and Constable Barton are the most appearing of Scotland Yard's members.\nA fictional version of New Scotland Yard appears in the film \"V for Vendetta\" and in the video game \"\", where it is depicted as an Albion-controlled site.\nJeffrey Archer's \"William Warwick\" series, starting with \"Nothing Ventured\" in 2019, follows William Warwick, the protagonist's rise from a detective constable to senior ranks within Scotland Yard.\nFurther depictions include:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "27159", "revid": "20536621", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27159", "title": "Sherlock Holmes", "text": "Fictional character created by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle\nSherlock Holmes () is a fictional detective created by British author Arthur Conan Doyle. Referring to himself as a \"consulting detective\" in his stories, Holmes is known for his proficiency with observation, deduction, forensic science and logical reasoning that borders on the fantastic, which he employs when investigating cases for a wide variety of clients, including Scotland Yard.\nThe character Sherlock Holmes first appeared in print in 1887's \"A Study in Scarlet\". His popularity became widespread with the first series of short stories in \"The Strand Magazine\", beginning with \"A Scandal in Bohemia\" in 1891; additional tales appeared from then until 1927, eventually totalling four novels and 56 short stories. All but one are set in the Victorian or Edwardian eras between 1880 and 1914. Most are narrated by the character of Holmes's friend and biographer, Dr. John H. Watson, who usually accompanies Holmes during his investigations and often shares quarters with him at the address of 221B Baker Street, London, where many of the stories begin.\nThough not the first fictional detective, Sherlock Holmes is arguably the best known. By the 1990s, over 25,000 stage adaptations, films, television productions, and publications had featured the detective, and \"Guinness World Records\" lists him as the most portrayed human literary character in film and television history. Holmes's popularity and fame are such that many have believed him to be not a fictional character but an actual person; many literary and fan societies have been founded on this pretence. Avid readers of the Holmes stories helped create the modern practice of fandom, with the Sherlock Holmes fandom being one of the first cohesive fan communities in the world. The character and stories have had a profound and lasting effect on mystery writing and popular culture as a whole, with the original tales, as well as thousands written by authors other than Conan Doyle, being adapted into stage and radio plays, television, films, video games, and other media for over one hundred years.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nInspiration for the character.\nEdgar Allan Poe's C. Auguste Dupin is generally acknowledged as the forerunner of the modern detective story in English fiction and served as the prototype for many later characters, including Holmes. Conan Doyle once wrote, \"Each [of Poe's detective stories] is a root from which a whole literature has developed\u00a0... Where was the detective story until Poe breathed the breath of life into it?\" Similarly, the stories of \u00c9mile Gaboriau's Monsieur Lecoq were extremely popular at the time Conan Doyle began writing Holmes, and Holmes's speech and behaviour sometimes follow those of Lecoq. Doyle has his main characters discuss these literary antecedents near the beginning of \"A Study in Scarlet\", which is set soon after Watson is first introduced to Holmes. Watson attempts to compliment Holmes by comparing him to Dupin, to which Holmes replies that he found Dupin to be \"a very inferior fellow\" and Lecoq to be \"a miserable bungler\".\nConan Doyle repeatedly said that Holmes was inspired by the real-life figure of Joseph Bell, a surgeon at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, whom Conan Doyle met in 1877 and had worked for as a clerk. Like Holmes, Bell was noted for drawing broad conclusions from minute observations. Bell wrote an introduction for a later edition of \"A Study in Scarlet\". Bell also dismissed the idea that he was the character's inspiration, writing to Doyle, \"You are yourself Sherlock Holmes and well you know it\". Sir Henry Littlejohn, Chair of Medical Jurisprudence at the University of Edinburgh Medical School, is also cited as an inspiration for Holmes. Littlejohn, who was also Police Surgeon and Medical Officer of Health in Edinburgh, provided Conan Doyle with a link between medical investigation and the detection of crime.\nOther possible inspirations have been proposed, though never acknowledged by Doyle, such as \"Maximilien Heller\", by French author Henry Cauvain. In this 1871 novel (sixteen years before the first appearance of Sherlock Holmes), Henry Cauvain imagined a depressed, anti-social, opium-smoking polymath detective, operating in Paris. It is not known if Conan Doyle read the novel, but he was fluent in French.\nBiography.\nFamily and early life.\nDetails of Sherlock Holmes' life in Conan Doyle's stories are scarce and often vague. Nevertheless, mentions of his early life and extended family paint a loose biographical picture of the detective.\nA statement of Holmes' age in \"His Last Bow\" places his year of birth at 1853\u20131854; the story, set in August 1914, describes him as sixty years of age. His parents are not mentioned, although Holmes mentions that his \"ancestors\" were \"country squires\". In \"The Adventure of the Greek Interpreter\", he claims that his grandmother was sister to the French artist Vernet, without clarifying whether this was Claude Joseph, Carle, or Horace Vernet. Holmes' brother Mycroft, seven years his senior, is a government official. Mycroft has a unique civil service position as a kind of human database for all aspects of government policy. Sherlock describes his brother as the more intelligent of the two, but notes that Mycroft lacks any interest in physical investigation, preferring to spend his time at the Diogenes Club.\nHolmes says that he first developed his methods of deduction as an undergraduate; his earliest cases, which he pursued as an amateur, came from his fellow university students. A meeting with a classmate's father led him to adopt detection as a profession.\nLife with Watson.\nIn the first tale of Sherlock Holmes, \"A Study in Scarlet\", financial difficulties lead Holmes and Dr. Watson to share rooms together at 221B Baker Street, London. Their residence is maintained by their landlady, Mrs. Hudson. Holmes works as a detective for twenty-three years, with Watson assisting him for seventeen of those years. Most of the stories are frame narratives written from Watson's point of view, as summaries of the detective's most interesting cases. Holmes frequently calls Watson's records of Holmes's cases sensational and populist, suggesting that they fail to accurately and objectively report the \"science\" of his craft:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Detection is, or ought to be, an exact science and should be treated in the same cold and unemotional manner. You have attempted to tinge it [\"A Study in Scarlet\"] with romanticism, which produces much the same effect as if you worked a love-story or an elopement into the fifth proposition of Euclid.\u00a0... Some facts should be suppressed, or, at least, a just sense of proportion should be observed in treating them. The only point in the case which deserved mention was the curious analytical reasoning from effects to causes, by which I succeeded in unravelling it.\nNevertheless, when Holmes recorded a case himself, he was forced to concede that he could more easily understand the need to write it in a manner that would appeal to the public rather than his intention to focus on his own technical skill.\nHolmes's friendship with Watson is his most significant relationship. When Watson is injured by a bullet, although the wound turns out to be \"quite superficial\", Watson is moved by Holmes's reaction:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAfter confirming Watson's assessment of the wound, Holmes makes it clear to their opponent that the man would not have left the room alive if he genuinely had killed Watson.\nPractice.\nHolmes' clients vary from the most powerful monarchs and governments of Europe, to wealthy aristocrats and industrialists, to impoverished pawnbrokers and governesses. He is known only in select professional circles at the beginning of the first story, but is already collaborating with Scotland Yard. However, his continued work and the publication of Watson's stories raise Holmes's profile, and he rapidly becomes well known as a detective; so many clients ask for his help instead of (or in addition to) that of the police that, Watson writes, by 1887 \"Europe was ringing with his name\" and by 1895 Holmes has \"an immense practice\". Police outside London ask Holmes for assistance if he is nearby. A British prime minister and the King of Bohemia visit 221B Baker Street in person to request Holmes's assistance; the President of France awards him the Legion of Honour for capturing an assassin; the King of Scandinavia is a client; and he aids the Vatican at least twice. The detective acts on behalf of the British government in matters of national security several times and declines a knighthood \"for services which may perhaps some day be described\". However, he does not actively seek fame and is usually content to let the police take public credit for his work.\nThe Great Hiatus.\nThe first set of Holmes stories was published between 1887 and 1893. Conan Doyle killed off Holmes in a final battle with the criminal mastermind Professor James Moriarty in \"The Final Problem\" (published 1893, but set in 1891), as Conan Doyle felt that \"my literary energies should not be directed too much into one channel\". However, the reaction of the public surprised him very much. Distressed readers wrote anguished letters to \"The Strand Magazine\", which suffered a terrible blow when 20,000 people cancelled their subscriptions to the magazine in protest. Conan Doyle himself received many protest letters, and one lady even began her letter with \"You brute\". Legend has it that Londoners were so distraught upon hearing the news of Holmes's death that they wore black armbands in mourning, though there is no known contemporaneous source for this; the earliest known reference to such events comes from 1949. However, the recorded public reaction to Holmes's death was unlike anything previously seen for fictional events.\nAfter resisting public pressure for eight years, Conan Doyle wrote \"The Hound of the Baskervilles\" (serialised in 1901\u201302, with an implicit setting before Holmes's death). In 1903, Conan Doyle wrote \"The Adventure of the Empty House\"; set in 1894, Holmes reappears, explaining to a stunned Watson that he had faked his death to fool his enemies. Following \"The Adventure of the Empty House\", Conan Doyle would sporadically write new Holmes stories until 1927.\nHolmes aficionados refer to the period from 1891 to 1894\u2014between his disappearance and presumed death in \"The Final Problem\" and his reappearance in \"The Adventure of the Empty House\"\u2014as the Great Hiatus. The earliest known use of this expression dates to 1946.\nRetirement.\nIn \"His Last Bow\", the reader is told that Holmes has retired to a small farm on the Sussex Downs and taken up beekeeping as his primary occupation. The move is not dated precisely, but can be presumed to be no later than 1904 (since it is referred to retrospectively in \"The Adventure of the Second Stain\", first published that year). The story features Holmes and Watson coming out of retirement to aid the British war effort. Only one other adventure, \"The Adventure of the Lion's Mane\", takes place during the detective's retirement.\nPersonality and habits.\nWatson describes Holmes as \"bohemian\" in his habits and lifestyle. Said to have a \"cat-like\" love of personal cleanliness, at the same time Holmes is an eccentric with no regard for contemporary standards of tidiness or good order. Watson describes him as\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;in his personal habits one of the most untidy men that ever drove a fellow-lodger to distraction. [He] keeps his cigars in the coal-scuttle, his tobacco in the toe end of a Persian slipper, and his unanswered correspondence transfixed by a jack-knife into the very centre of his wooden mantelpiece.\u00a0... He had a horror of destroying documents.\u00a0... Thus month after month his papers accumulated, until every corner of the room was stacked with bundles of manuscript which were on no account to be burned, and which could not be put away save by their owner.\nWhile Holmes is characterised as dispassionate and cold, he can be animated and excitable during an investigation. He has a flair for showmanship, often keeping his methods and evidence hidden until the last possible moment so as to impress observers. Holmes is willing to break the law as a means for righting a wrong, contending that \"there are certain crimes which the law cannot touch, and which therefore, to some extent, justify private revenge.\" His companion condones the detective's willingness to do this on behalf of a client\u2014lying to the police, concealing evidence or breaking into houses\u2014when he also feels it morally justifiable.\nExcept for that of Watson, Holmes avoids casual company. In \"The \"Gloria Scott\"\", he tells the doctor that during two years at college he made only one friend: \"I was never a very sociable fellow, Watson\u00a0... I never mixed much with the men of my year.\" The detective goes without food at times of intense intellectual activity, believing that \"the faculties become refined when you starve them\". At times, Holmes relaxes with music, either playing the violin or enjoying the works of composers such as Wagner and Pablo de Sarasate.\nDrug use.\nHolmes occasionally uses addictive drugs, especially in the absence of stimulating cases. He sometimes uses morphine and sometimes cocaine, the latter of which he injects in a seven-percent solution; both drugs were legal in 19th-century England. As a physician, Watson strongly disapproves of his friend's cocaine habit, describing it as the detective's only vice, and concerned about its effect on Holmes's mental health and intellect. In \"The Adventure of the Missing Three-Quarter\", Watson says that although he has \"weaned\" Holmes from drugs, the detective remains an addict whose habit is \"not dead, but merely sleeping\".\nWatson and Holmes both smoke tobacco, in cigarettes, cigars, and pipes. Although his chronicler does not consider Holmes's smoking a vice \"per se\", Watson\u2014a physician\u2014does criticise the detective for creating a \"poisonous atmosphere\" in their confined quarters.\nFinances.\nHolmes is known to charge clients for his expenses and claim any reward offered for a problem's solution, such as in \"The Adventure of the Speckled Band\", \"The Red-Headed League\", and \"The Adventure of the Beryl Coronet\". The detective states at one point that \"My professional charges are upon a fixed scale. I do not vary them, save when I remit them altogether.\" In this context, a client is offering to double his fee, and it is implied that wealthy clients habitually pay Holmes more than his standard rate. In \"The Adventure of the Priory School\", Holmes earns a \u00a36,000 fee (at a time when annual expenses for a rising young professional were in the area of \u00a3500). However, Watson notes that Holmes would refuse to help even the wealthy and powerful if their cases did not interest him.\nAttitudes towards women.\nAs Conan Doyle wrote to Joseph Bell, \"Holmes is as inhuman as a Babbage's Calculating Machine and just about as likely to fall in love.\" Holmes says of himself that he is \"not a whole-souled admirer of womankind\", and that he finds \"the motives of women\u00a0... inscrutable.\u00a0... How can you build on such quicksand? Their most trivial actions may mean volumes\". In \"The Sign of Four\", he says, \"Women are never to be entirely trusted\u2014not the best of them\", a feeling Watson notes as an \"atrocious sentiment\". In \"The Adventure of the Lion's Mane\", Holmes writes, \"Women have seldom been an attraction to me, for my brain has always governed my heart.\" At the end of \"The Sign of Four\", Holmes states that \"love is an emotional thing, and whatever is emotional is opposed to that true, cold reason which I place above all things. I should never marry myself, lest I bias my judgement.\" Ultimately, Holmes claims outright that \"I have never loved.\"\nBut while Watson says that the detective has an \"aversion to women\", he also notes Holmes as having \"a peculiarly ingratiating way with [them]\". Watson notes that their housekeeper Mrs. Hudson is fond of Holmes because of his \"remarkable gentleness and courtesy in his dealings with women. He disliked and distrusted the sex, but he was always a chivalrous opponent.\" In \"The Adventure of Charles Augustus Milverton\", the detective becomes engaged under false pretenses in order to obtain information about a case, abandoning the woman once he has the information he requires.\nIrene Adler.\nIrene Adler is a retired American opera singer and actress who appears in \"A Scandal in Bohemia\". Although this is her only appearance, she is one of only a handful of people who bests Holmes in a battle of wits, and the only woman. For this reason, Adler is the frequent subject of pastiche writing. The beginning of the story describes the high regard in which Holmes holds her:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;To Sherlock Holmes she is always \"the\" woman. I have seldom heard him mention her under any other name. In his eyes she eclipses and predominates the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt any emotion akin to love for Irene Adler.\u00a0... And yet there was but one woman to him, and that woman was the late Irene Adler, of dubious and questionable memory.\nFive years before the story's events, Adler had a brief liaison with Crown Prince of Bohemia Wilhelm von Ormstein. As the story opens, the Prince is engaged to another. Fearful that the marriage would be called off if his fianc\u00e9e's family learns of this past impropriety, Ormstein hires Holmes to regain a photograph of Adler and himself. Adler slips away before Holmes can succeed. Her memory is kept alive by the photograph of Adler that Holmes received for his part in the case.\nKnowledge and skills.\nShortly after meeting Holmes in the first story, \"A Study in Scarlet\" (generally assumed to be 1881, though the exact date is not given), Watson assesses the detective's abilities:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIn \"A Study in Scarlet\", Holmes claims to be unaware that the Earth revolves around the Sun since such information is irrelevant to his work; after hearing that fact from Watson, he says he will immediately try to forget it. The detective believes that the mind has a finite capacity for information storage, and learning useless things reduces one's ability to learn useful things. The later stories move away from this notion: in \"The Valley of Fear\", he says, \"All knowledge comes useful to the detective\", and in \"The Adventure of the Lion's Mane\", the detective calls himself \"an omnivorous reader with a strangely retentive memory for trifles\". Looking back on the development of the character in 1912, Conan Doyle wrote that \"In the first one, the \"Study in Scarlet\", [Holmes] was a mere calculating machine, but I had to make him more of an educated human being as I went on with him.\"\nDespite Holmes's supposed ignorance of politics, in \"A Scandal in Bohemia\" he immediately recognises the true identity of the disguised \"Count von Kramm\". At the end of \"A Study in Scarlet\", Holmes demonstrates a knowledge of Latin. The detective cites Hafez, Goethe, as well as a letter from Gustave Flaubert to George Sand in the original French. In \"The Hound of the Baskervilles\", the detective recognises works by Godfrey Kneller and Joshua Reynolds: \"Watson won't allow that I know anything of art, but that is mere jealousy since our views upon the subject differ.\" In \"The Adventure of the Bruce-Partington Plans\", Watson says that \"Holmes lost himself in a monograph which he had undertaken upon the Polyphonic Motets of Lassus\", considered \"the last word\" on the subject \u2014 which must have been the result of an intensive and very specialized musicological study with no obvious application to the solution of criminal mysteries.\nHolmes is a cryptanalyst, telling Watson that \"I am fairly familiar with all forms of secret writing, and am myself the author of a trifling monograph upon the subject, in which I analyse one hundred and sixty separate ciphers.\" Holmes also demonstrates a knowledge of psychology in \"A Scandal in Bohemia\", luring Irene Adler into betraying where she hid a photograph based on the premise that a woman will rush to save her most valued possession from a fire. Another example is in \"The Adventure of the Blue Carbuncle\", where Holmes obtains information from a salesman with a wager: \"When you see a man with whiskers of that cut and the 'Pink 'un' protruding out of his pocket, you can always draw him by a bet\u00a0... I daresay that if I had put 100 pounds down in front of him, that man would not have given me such complete information as was drawn from him by the idea that he was doing me on a wager.\"\nMaria Konnikova points out in an interview with D. J. Grothe that Holmes practises what is now called mindfulness, concentrating on one thing at a time, and almost never \"multitasks\". She adds that in this he predates the science showing how helpful this is to the brain.\nHolmesian deduction.\nHolmes observes the dress and attitude of his clients and suspects, noting skin marks (such as tattoos), contamination (such as ink stains or clay on boots), emotional state, and physical condition in order to deduce their origins and recent history. The style and state of wear of a person's clothes and personal items are also commonly relied on; in the stories, Holmes is seen applying his method to items such as walking sticks, pipes, and hats. For example, in \"A Scandal in Bohemia\", Holmes infers that Watson had got wet lately and had \"a most clumsy and careless servant girl\". When Watson asks how Holmes knows this, the detective answers:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;It is simplicity itself\u00a0... my eyes tell me that on the inside of your left shoe, just where the firelight strikes it, the leather is scored by six almost parallel cuts. Obviously they have been caused by someone who has very carelessly scraped round the edges of the sole in order to remove crusted mud from it. Hence, you see, my double deduction that you had been out in vile weather, and that you had a particularly malignant boot-slitting specimen of the London slavey.\nIn the first Holmes story, \"A Study in Scarlet\", Dr. Watson compares Holmes to C. Auguste Dupin, Edgar Allan Poe's fictional detective, who employed a similar methodology. Alluding to an episode in \"The Murders in the Rue Morgue\", where Dupin determines what his friend is thinking despite their having walked together in silence for a quarter of an hour, Holmes remarks: \"That trick of his breaking in on his friend's thoughts with an apropos remark\u00a0... is really very showy and superficial.\" Nevertheless, Holmes later performs the same 'trick' on Watson in \"The Cardboard Box\" and \"The Adventure of the Dancing Men\".\nThough the stories always refer to Holmes's intellectual detection method as \"deduction\", Holmes primarily relies on abduction: inferring an explanation for observed details. \"From a drop of water,\" he writes, \"a logician could infer the possibility of an Atlantic or a Niagara without having seen or heard of one or the other.\" However, Holmes does employ deductive reasoning as well. The detective's guiding principle, as he says in \"The Sign of Four\", is: \"When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.\"\nHolmes follows Sir Isaac Newton's rule of \"hypotheses non fingo\", for instance commenting in \"A Scandal in Bohemia\": \"It is a capital mistake to theorize before one has data. Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of theories to suit facts.\" \nDespite Holmes's remarkable reasoning abilities, Conan Doyle still paints him as fallible in this regard (this being a central theme of \"The Yellow Face\").\nForensic science.\nThough Holmes is famed for his reasoning capabilities, his investigative technique relies heavily on the acquisition of hard evidence. Many of the techniques he employs in the stories were at the time in their infancy.\nThe detective is particularly skilled in the analysis of trace evidence and other physical evidence, including latent prints (such as footprints, hoof prints, and shoe and tire impressions) to identify actions at a crime scene, using tobacco ashes and cigarette butts to identify criminals, utilizing handwriting analysis and graphology, comparing typewritten letters to expose a fraud, using gunpowder residue to expose two murderers, and analyzing small pieces of human remains to expose two murders.\nBecause of the small scale of much of his evidence, the detective often uses a magnifying glass at the scene and an optical microscope at his Baker Street lodgings. He uses analytical chemistry for blood residue analysis and toxicology to detect poisons; Holmes's home chemistry laboratory is mentioned in \"The Naval Treaty\". Ballistics feature in \"The Adventure of the Empty House\" when spent bullets are recovered to be matched with a suspected murder weapon, a practice which became regular police procedure only some fifteen years after the story was published.\nLaura J. Snyder has examined Holmes's methods in the context of mid- to late-19th-century criminology, demonstrating that, while sometimes in advance of what official investigative departments were formally using at the time, they were based upon existing methods and techniques. For example, fingerprints were proposed to be distinct in Conan Doyle's day, and while Holmes used a thumbprint to solve a crime in \"The Adventure of the Norwood Builder\" (generally held to be set in 1895), the story was published in 1903, two years after Scotland Yard's fingerprint bureau opened. Though the effect of the Holmes stories on the development of forensic science has thus often been overstated, Holmes inspired future generations of forensic scientists to think scientifically and analytically.\nDisguises.\nHolmes displays a strong aptitude for acting and disguise. In several stories (\"The Sign of Four\", \"The Adventure of Charles Augustus Milverton\", \"The Man with the Twisted Lip\", \"The Adventure of the Empty House\" and \"A Scandal in Bohemia\"), to gather evidence undercover, he uses disguises so convincing that Watson fails to recognise him. In others (\"The Adventure of the Dying Detective\" and \"A Scandal in Bohemia\"), Holmes feigns injury or illness to incriminate the guilty. In the latter story, Watson says, \"The stage lost a fine actor\u00a0... when [Holmes] became a specialist in crime.\"\nGuy Mankowski has said of Holmes that his ability to change his appearance to blend into any situation \"helped him personify the idea of the English eccentric chameleon, in a way that prefigured the likes of David Bowie\".\nAgents.\nUntil Watson's arrival at Baker Street, Holmes largely worked alone, only occasionally employing agents from the city's underclass. These agents included a variety of informants, such as Langdale Pike, a \"human book of reference upon all matters of social scandal\", and Shinwell Johnson, who acted as Holmes's \"agent in the huge criminal underworld of London\". The best known of Holmes's agents are a group of street children he called \"the Baker Street Irregulars\".\nCombat.\nPistols.\nHolmes and Watson often carry pistols with them to confront criminals\u2014in Watson's case, his old service weapon (probably a Mark III Adams revolver, issued to British troops during the 1870s). Holmes and Watson shoot the eponymous hound in \"The Hound of the Baskervilles\", and in \"The Adventure of the Empty House\", Watson pistol-whips Colonel Sebastian Moran. In \"The Problem of Thor Bridge\", Holmes uses Watson's revolver to solve the case through an experiment.\nOther weapons.\nAs a gentleman, Holmes often carries a stick or cane. He is described by Watson as an expert at singlestick, and uses his cane thrice as a weapon. In \"A Study in Scarlet\", Watson describes Holmes as an expert swordsman, and in \"The \"Gloria Scott\"\", the detective says he practised fencing while at university. In several stories (\"A Case of Identity\", \"The Red-Headed League\", \"The Adventure of the Six Napoleons\"), Holmes wields a riding crop, described in the latter story as his \"favourite weapon\".\nPersonal combat.\nThe detective is described (or demonstrated) as possessing above-average physical strength. In \"The Yellow Face\", Holmes's chronicler says, \"Few men were capable of greater muscular effort.\" In \"The Adventure of the Speckled Band\", Dr. Roylott demonstrates his strength by bending a fire poker in half. Watson describes Holmes as laughing and saying, \"'If he had remained I might have shown him that my grip was not much more feeble than his own.' As he spoke he picked up the steel poker and, with a sudden effort, straightened it out again.\"\nHolmes is an adept bare-knuckle fighter; \"The \"Gloria Scott\"\" mentions that Holmes boxed while at university. In \"The Sign of Four\", he introduces himself to McMurdo, a prize fighter, as \"the amateur who fought three rounds with you at Alison's rooms on the night of your benefit four years back\". McMurdo remembers: \"Ah, you're one that has wasted your gifts, you have! You might have aimed high if you had joined the fancy.\" In \"The Yellow Face\", Watson says: \"He was undoubtedly one of the finest boxers of his weight that I have ever seen.\" In \"The Solitary Cyclist\", Holmes visits a country pub to make enquiries regarding a certain Mr Woodley which results in violence. Mr Woodley, Holmes tells Watson,\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAnother character subsequently refers to Mr Woodley as looking \"much disfigured\" as a result of his encounter with Holmes.\nIn \"The Adventure of the Empty House\", Holmes tells Watson that he used a Japanese martial art known as baritsu to fling Moriarty to his death in the Reichenbach Falls. \"Baritsu\" is Conan Doyle's version of bartitsu, which combines jujitsu with boxing and cane fencing.\nReception.\nPopularity.\nThe first two Sherlock Holmes stories, the novels \"A Study in Scarlet\" (1887) and \"The Sign of the Four\" (1890), were moderately well received, but Holmes first became very popular early in 1891 when the first six short stories featuring the character were published in \"The Strand Magazine\". Holmes became widely known in Britain and America. The character was so well known that in 1893 when Arthur Conan Doyle killed Holmes in the short story \"The Final Problem\", the strongly negative response from readers was unlike any previous public reaction to a fictional event. The \"Strand\" reportedly lost more than 20,000 subscribers as a result of Holmes's death. Public pressure eventually contributed to Conan Doyle writing another Holmes story in 1901 and resurrecting the character in a story published in 1903. In Japan, Sherlock Holmes (and Alice from \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\") became immensely popular in the country in the 1890s as it was opening up to the West, and they are cited as two British fictional Victorians who left an enormous creative and cultural legacy there.\nMany fans of Sherlock Holmes have written letters to Holmes's address, 221B Baker Street. Though the address 221B Baker Street did not exist when the stories were first published, letters began arriving to the large Abbey National building which first encompassed that address almost as soon as it was built in 1932. Fans continue to send letters to Sherlock Holmes; these letters are now delivered to the Sherlock Holmes Museum. Some of the people who have sent letters to 221B Baker Street believe Holmes is real. Members of the general public have also believed Holmes actually existed. In a 2008 survey of British teenagers, 58 per cent of respondents believed that Sherlock Holmes was a real person. \nScholarly discussion of Holmes has occasionally been written (usually facetiously) from the perspective of Holmes and Dr. Watson having existed; an example of this is the five critical essays, \"Studies in Sherlock Holmes\", by the author and essayist Dorothy L. Sayers in her 1946 non-fiction collection, \"Unpopular Opinions\", including an article examining Watson's \"signature\" which was allegedly visible in some original \"Strand\" illustrations.\nThe Sherlock Holmes stories continue to be widely read. Holmes's continuing popularity has led to many reimaginings of the character in adaptations. \"Guinness World Records\", which awarded Sherlock Holmes the title for \"most portrayed literary human character in film &amp; TV\" in 2012, released a statement saying that the title \"reflects his enduring appeal and demonstrates that his detective talents are as compelling today as they were 125 years ago\".\nHonours.\nThe London Metropolitan Railway named one of its twenty electric locomotives deployed in the 1920s for Sherlock Holmes. He was the only fictional character so honoured, along with eminent Britons such as Lord Byron, Benjamin Disraeli, and Florence Nightingale.\nA number of London streets are associated with Holmes. York Mews South, off Crawford Street, was renamed Sherlock Mews, and Watson's Mews is near Crawford Place. The Sherlock Holmes is a public house in Northumberland Street in London which contains a large collection of memorabilia related to Holmes, the original collection having been put together for display in Baker Street during the Festival of Britain in 1951.\nIn 2002, the Royal Society of Chemistry bestowed an honorary fellowship on Holmes for his use of forensic science and analytical chemistry in popular literature, making him (as of 2024) the only fictional character thus honoured. Holmes has been commemorated many times on UK postage stamps issued by the Royal Mail, most recently in their August 2020 series to celebrate the \"Sherlock\" television series.\nThere are multiple statues of Sherlock Holmes around the world. The first, sculpted by John Doubleday, was unveiled in Meiringen, Switzerland, in September 1988. The second was unveiled in October 1988 in Karuizawa, Japan, and was sculpted by Yoshinori Satoh. The third was installed in Edinburgh, Scotland, in 1989, and was sculpted by Gerald Laing. In 1999, a statue of Sherlock Holmes in London, also by John Doubleday, was unveiled near the fictional detective's address, 221B Baker Street. In 2001, a sculpture of Holmes and Arthur Conan Doyle by Irena Sedleck\u00e1 was unveiled in a statue collection in Warwickshire, England. A sculpture depicting both Holmes and Watson was unveiled in 2007 in Moscow, Russia, based partially on Sidney Paget's illustrations and partially on the actors in \"The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson\". In 2015, a sculpture of Holmes by Jane DeDecker was installed in the police headquarters of Edmond, Oklahoma, United States. In 2019, a statue of Holmes was unveiled in Chester, Illinois, United States, as part of a series of statues honouring cartoonist E. C. Segar and his characters. The statue is titled \"Sherlock &amp; Segar\", and the face of the statue was modelled on Segar.\nSocieties.\nIn 1934, the Sherlock Holmes Society (in London) and the Baker Street Irregulars (in New York) were founded. The latter is still active. The Sherlock Holmes Society was dissolved later in the 1930s, but was succeeded by a society with a slightly different name, the Sherlock Holmes Society of London, which was founded in 1951 and remains active. These societies were followed by many more, first in the US (where they are known as \"scion societies\"\u2014offshoots\u2014of the Baker Street Irregulars) and then in England and Denmark. There are at least 250 societies worldwide, including Australia, Canada (such as The Bootmakers of Toronto), India, and Japan. Fans tend to be called \"Holmesians\" in the UK and \"Sherlockians\" in the US, though recently \"Sherlockian\" has also come to refer to fans of the Benedict Cumberbatch-led BBC series regardless of location.\nLegacy.\nThe detective story.\nAlthough Holmes is not the original fictional detective, his name has become synonymous with the role. Doyle's Sherlock Holmes stories introduced multiple literary devices that have become major conventions in detective fiction, such as the companion character who is not as clever as the detective and has solutions explained to him (thus informing the reader as well), as with Dr. Watson in the Holmes stories. Other conventions introduced by Doyle include the arch-criminal who is too clever for the official police to defeat, like Holmes's adversary Professor Moriarty, and the use of forensic science to solve cases.\nThe Sherlock Holmes stories established crime fiction as a respectable genre popular with readers of all backgrounds, and Doyle's success inspired many contemporary detective stories. Holmes influenced the creation of other \"eccentric gentleman detective\" characters, like Agatha Christie's fictional detective Hercule Poirot, introduced in 1920. Holmes also inspired a number of anti-hero characters \"almost as an antidote to the masterful detective\", such as the gentleman thief characters A. J. Raffles (created by E. W. Hornung in 1898) and Ars\u00e8ne Lupin (created by Maurice Leblanc in 1905).\n\"Elementary, my dear Watson\".\nThe phrase \"Elementary, my dear Watson\" has become one of the most quoted and iconic aspects of the character. However, although Holmes often observes that his conclusions are \"elementary\", and occasionally calls Watson \"my dear Watson\", the phrase \"Elementary, my dear Watson\" is never uttered in any of the sixty stories by Conan Doyle. One of the nearest approximations of the phrase appears in \"The Adventure of the Crooked Man\" (1893) when Holmes explains a deduction: \"'I have the advantage of knowing your habits, my dear Watson,' said he [Holmes]. [...] 'Excellent,' I [Watson] cried. 'Elementary,' said he.\"\nWilliam Gillette is widely considered to have originated the phrase with the formulation, \"Oh, this is elementary, my dear fellow\", allegedly in his 1899 play \"Sherlock Holmes\". However, the script was revised many times over the course of some three decades of revivals and publications, and the phrase is present in some versions of the script, but not others. The appearance of the line \"Elementary, my dear Potson\" in a Sherlock Holmes parody from 1901 has led some authors to speculate that, rather than this being an incidental formulation, the parodist drew upon already well-established occurrences of \"Elementary, my dear Watson.\"\nThe exact phrase, as well as close variants, can be seen in newspaper and journal articles as early as 1909. It was also used by P. G. Wodehouse in his novel \"Psmith, Journalist\", which was first serialised in \"The Captain\" magazine between October 1909 and February 1910; the phrase occurred in the January 1910 instalment. The phrase became familiar with the American public in part due to its use in the Rathbone-Bruce series of films from 1939 to 1946.\nThe Great Game.\nConan Doyle's 56 short stories and four novels are known as the \"canon\" by Holmes aficionados. The Great Game (also known as the Holmesian Game, the Sherlockian Game, or simply the Game, also the Higher Criticism) applies the methods of literary and especially Biblical criticism to the canon, operating on the pretense that Holmes and Watson were real people and that Conan Doyle was not the author of the stories but Watson's literary agent. From this basis, it attempts to resolve or explain away contradictions in the canon\u2014such as the location of Watson's war wound, described as being in his shoulder in \"A Study in Scarlet\" and in his leg in \"The Sign of Four\"\u2014and clarify details about Holmes, Watson and their world, such as the exact dates of events in the stories, combining historical research with references from the stories to construct scholarly analyses.\nFor example, one detail analyzed in the Game is Holmes's birth date. The chronology of the stories is notoriously difficult, with many stories lacking dates and many others containing contradictory ones. Christopher Morley and William Baring-Gould contend that the detective was born on 6 January 1854, the year being derived from the statement in \"His Last Bow\" that he was 60 years of age in 1914, while the precise day is derived from broader, non-canonical speculation. This is the date the Baker Street Irregulars work from, with their annual dinner being held each January. Laurie R. King instead argues that details in \"The \"Gloria Scott\"\" (a story with no precise internal date) indicate that Holmes finished his second (and final) year of university in 1880 or 1885. If he began university at age 17, his birth year could be as late as 1868.\nMuseums and special collections.\nFor the 1951 Festival of Britain, Holmes's living room was reconstructed as part of a Sherlock Holmes exhibition, with a collection of original material. After the festival, items were transferred to The Sherlock Holmes (a London pub) and the Conan Doyle collection housed in Lucens, Switzerland, by the author's son, Adrian. Both exhibitions, each with a Baker Street sitting-room reconstruction, are open to the public.\nIn 1969, the Toronto Reference Library began a collection of materials related to Conan Doyle. Stored today in Room 221B, this vast collection is accessible to the public. Similarly, in 1974 the University of Minnesota founded a collection that is now \"the world's largest gathering of material related to Sherlock Holmes and his creator\". Access is closed to the general public, but is occasionally open to tours.\nIn 1990, the Sherlock Holmes Museum opened on Baker Street in London, followed the next year by a museum in Meiringen (near the Reichenbach Falls) dedicated to the detective. A private Conan Doyle collection is a permanent exhibit at the Portsmouth City Museum, where the author lived and worked as a physician.\nPostcolonial criticism.\nThe Sherlock Holmes stories have been scrutinized by a few academics for themes of empire and colonialism.\nSusan Cannon Harris claims that themes of contagion and containment are common in the Holmes series, including the metaphors of Eastern foreigners as the root cause of \"infection\" within and around Europe. Lauren Raheja, writing in the Marxist journal \"Nature, Society, and Thought\", claims that Doyle used these characteristics to paint eastern colonies in a negative light, through their continually being the source of threats. For example, in one story, Doyle makes mention of the Sumatran cannibals (also known as Batak) who throw poisonous darts, and in \"The Speckled Band\", a \"long residence in the tropics\" was a negative influence on one antagonist's bad temper. Yumna Siddiqi argues that Doyle depicted returned colonials as \"marginal, physically ravaged characters that threaten the peace\", while putting non-colonials in a much more positive light.\nAdaptations and derived works.\nThe popularity of Sherlock Holmes has meant that many writers other than Arthur Conan Doyle have created tales of the detective in a wide variety of different media, with varying degrees of fidelity to the original characters, stories, and setting. The first known pastiche dates from 1891. Titled \"My Evening with Sherlock Holmes\", it was written by Conan Doyle's close friend J. M. Barrie.\nAdaptations have seen the character taken in radically different directions or placed in different times or even universes. For example, Holmes falls in love and marries in Laurie R. King's Mary Russell series, is re-animated after his death to fight future crime in the animated series \"Sherlock Holmes in the 22nd Century\", and is meshed with the setting of H. P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos in Neil Gaiman's \"A Study in Emerald\" (which won the 2004 Hugo Award for Best Short Story). An especially influential pastiche was Nicholas Meyer's \"The Seven-Per-Cent Solution\", a 1974 \"New York Times\" bestselling novel (made into the 1976 film of the same name) in which Holmes's cocaine addiction has progressed to the point of endangering his career. It served to popularize the trend of incorporating clearly identified and contemporaneous historical figures (such as Oscar Wilde, Aleister Crowley, Sigmund Freud, or Jack the Ripper) into Holmesian pastiches, something Conan Doyle himself never did. Another common pastiche approach is to create a new story fully detailing an otherwise-passing canonical reference (such as an aside by Conan Doyle mentioning the \"giant rat of Sumatra, a story for which the world is not yet prepared\" in \"The Adventure of the Sussex Vampire\").\nThe first translation of a Sherlock Holmes story into a Chinese variety was done by \"Chinese Progress\" in 1896. That publication rendered the name as \u5475\u723e\u5514\u65af, which would be \u5475\u5c14\u5514\u65af in Simplified Chinese and H\u0113'\u011brw\u00fas\u012b in Modern Standard Mandarin. Shanghai Civilization Books later issued versions rendering Holmes's name differently, as \u798f\u723e\u6469\u65af in Traditional Chinese, which would be \u798f\u5c14\u6469\u65af in Simplified Chinese and F\u00fa'\u011brm\u00f3s\u012b in Modern Standard Mandarin; this version became the common way of rendering \"Holmes\" in Chinese languages.\nRelated and derivative writings.\nIn addition to the Holmes canon, Conan Doyle wrote other material featuring Holmes, especially plays: 1899's \"Sherlock Holmes\" (with William Gillette), 1910's \"The Speckled Band\", and 1921's \"The Crown Diamond\" (the basis for \"The Adventure of the Mazarin Stone\"). These and other Holmes-related but non-canonical works have been collected in several works released since Conan Doyle's death.\nIn terms of writers other than Conan Doyle, authors as diverse as Agatha Christie, Anthony Burgess, Neil Gaiman, Dorothy B. Hughes, Stephen King, Tanith Lee, A. A. Milne, and P. G. Wodehouse have all written Sherlock Holmes pastiches. Contemporary with Conan Doyle, Maurice Leblanc directly featured Holmes in his popular series about the gentleman thief, Ars\u00e8ne Lupin, though legal objections from Conan Doyle forced Leblanc to modify the name to \"Herlock Sholmes\" in reprints and later stories. Mystery writer John Dickson Carr collaborated with Arthur Conan Doyle's son, Adrian Conan Doyle, on \"The Exploits of Sherlock Holmes\", a pastiche collection from 1954. In 2011, Anthony Horowitz published a Sherlock Holmes novel, \"The House of Silk\", presented as a continuation of Conan Doyle's work and with the approval of the Conan Doyle estate; a follow-up, \"Moriarty\", appeared in 2014. The \"MX Book of New Sherlock Holmes Stories\" series of pastiches, edited by David Marcum and published by MX Publishing, contains fifty-two volumes and features hundreds of stories echoing the original canon which were compiled for the restoration of Undershaw and the support of Stepping Stones School, now housed in it.\nIn 1980's \"The Name of the Rose\", Italian author Umberto Eco creates a Sherlock Holmes of the 1320s in the form of a Franciscan friar and main protagonist named Brother William of Baskerville, his name a clear reference to Holmes per \"The Hound of the Baskervilles\". Brother William investigates a series of murders in the abbey alongside his novice Adso of Melk, who acts as his Dr. Watson. Furthermore, Umberto Eco's description of Brother William bears marked similarities in both physique and personality to Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's description of Sherlock Holmes in \"A Study in Scarlet\".\nLaurie R. King recreated Holmes in her Mary Russell series (beginning with 1994's \"The Beekeeper's Apprentice\"), set during the First World War and the 1920s. Her Holmes, semi-retired in Sussex, meets a teenage American girl. Recognising a kindred spirit, he trains her as his apprentice and subsequently marries her. As of 2024, the series includes eighteen base novels and additional writings.\n\"The Final Solution\", a 2004 novella by Michael Chabon, concerns an unnamed but long-retired detective interested in beekeeping who tackles the case of a missing parrot belonging to a Jewish refugee boy. Mitch Cullin's novel \"A Slight Trick of the Mind\" (2005) takes place two years after the end of the Second World War and explores an old and frail Sherlock Holmes (now 93) as he comes to terms with a life spent in emotionless logic; this was also adapted into a film, 2015's \"Mr. Holmes\".\nMinor characters.\nSome authors have written tales centred on characters from the canon other than Holmes. Anthologies edited by Michael Kurland and George Mann are entirely devoted to stories told from the perspective of characters other than Holmes and Watson. John Gardner, Michael Kurland, and Kim Newman, amongst many others, have all written tales in which Holmes's nemesis Professor Moriarty is the main character. Mycroft Holmes has been the subject of several efforts: \"Enter the Lion\" by Michael P. Hodel and Sean M. Wright (1979), a four-book series by Quinn Fawcett, and 2015's \"Mycroft Holmes\", by Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Anna Waterhouse. M. J. Trow has written a series of seventeen books using Inspector Lestrade as the central character, beginning with \"The Adventures of Inspector Lestrade\" in 1985. Carole Nelson Douglas' Irene Adler series is based on \"the woman\" from \"A Scandal in Bohemia\", with the first book (1990's \"Good Night, Mr. Holmes\") retelling that story from Adler's point of view. Martin Davies has written three novels where Baker Street housekeeper Mrs. Hudson is the protagonist.\nParodies.\nA popular form of Holmesian pastiche is the parody. \"My Evening with Sherlock Holmes\", by J. M. Barrie, was released in 1891, four years after Holmes first appearance in print and four months after \"A Scandal in Bohemia\" appeared in \"The Strand\"; it is generally considered a parody. Many others soon followed, with the protagonists often given thinly veiled names such as Sherlaw Kombs (by Robert Barr), Picklock Holes (by R. C. Lehmann), Shamrock Jolnes (by O. Henry), Holmlock Shears, Shylock Homes, and so on.\nConan Doyle himself contributed to this style, with 1898's \"The Lost Special\" featuring an unnamed \"amateur reasoner\" intended to be identified by his readers as Holmes. The author's explanation of a baffling disappearance argued in Holmesian style poked fun at his own creation. Similar Conan Doyle short stories are \"The Field Bazaar\", \"The Man with the Watches\", and 1924's \"How Watson Learned the Trick\", a parody of the Watson\u2013Holmes breakfast-table scenes.\nIn 1944, American mystery writers Frederic Dannay and Manfred B. Lee (writing under their joint pseudonym Ellery Queen) published \"The Misadventures of Sherlock Holmes\", a collection of thirty-three pastiches written by various well-known authors, featuring many parodies.\nScholarly works.\nThere have been many scholarly works dealing with Sherlock Holmes, some working within the bounds of the Great Game, and some written from the perspective that Holmes is a fictional character. In particular, there have been three major annotated editions of the complete series. The first was William Baring-Gould's 1967 \"The Annotated Sherlock Holmes\". This two-volume set was ordered to fit Baring-Gould's preferred chronology, and was written from a Great Game perspective. The second was 1993's \"The Oxford Sherlock Holmes\" (general editor: Owen Dudley Edwards), a nine-volume set written in a straight scholarly manner. The most recent is Leslie Klinger's \"The New Annotated Sherlock Holmes\" (2004\u201305), a three-volume set that returns to a Great Game perspective.\nAdaptations in other media.\nIn 2012, \"Guinness World Records\" listed Holmes as the most portrayed literary human character in film and television history, with more than 75 actors playing the part in over 250 productions.\nThe 1899 play \"Sherlock Holmes\", by Conan Doyle and William Gillette, was a synthesis of several Conan Doyle stories. In addition to its popularity, the play is significant because it, rather than the original stories, introduced one of the key visual qualities commonly associated with Holmes today: his calabash pipe; the play also formed the basis for Gillette's 1916 film, \"Sherlock Holmes\". Gillette performed as Holmes some 1,300 times. In the early 1900s, H. A. Saintsbury took over the role from Gillette for a tour of the play. Between this play and Conan Doyle's own stage adaptation of \"The Adventure of the Speckled Band\", Saintsbury portrayed Holmes over 1,000 times.\nHolmes's first screen appearance was in the 1900 Mutoscope film, \"Sherlock Holmes Baffled\". From 1921 to 1923, Eille Norwood played Holmes in forty-seven silent films (45 shorts and two features), in a series of performances that Conan Doyle spoke highly of. 1929's \"The Return of Sherlock Holmes\" was the first sound title to feature Holmes. From 1939 to 1946, Basil Rathbone played Holmes and Nigel Bruce played Watson in fourteen US films (two for 20th Century Fox and a dozen for Universal Pictures) and in \"The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes\" radio show. While the Fox films were period pieces, the Universal films abandoned Victorian Britain and moved to a then-contemporary setting in which Holmes occasionally battled Nazis.\nThe character has also enjoyed numerous radio adaptations, beginning with Edith Meiser's \"The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes\", which ran from 1930 to 1936. Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce continued with their roles for most of the run of \"The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes\", airing from 1939 to 1950. Bert Coules, having dramatised the entire Holmes canon for BBC Radio Four from 1989 to 1998, penned \"The Further Adventures of Sherlock Holmes\" between 2002 and 2010. This pastiche series also aired on Radio Four and starred Clive Merrison as Holmes and Michael Williams and then Andrew Sachs as Watson.\nThe 1984\u201385 Italian/Japanese anime series \"Sherlock Hound\" adapted the Holmes stories for children, with its characters being anthropomorphic dogs. The series was co-directed by Hayao Miyazaki. Between 1979 and 1986, the Soviet studio Lenfilm produced a series of five television films, \"The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson\". The series were split into eleven episodes and starred Vasily Livanov as Holmes and Vitaly Solomin as Watson. For his performance, in 2006 Livanov was appointed an Honorary Member of the Order of the British Empire.\nJeremy Brett played the detective in \"Sherlock Holmes\" for Granada Television from 1984 to 1994. Watson was played by David Burke (in the first two series) and Edward Hardwicke (in the remainder). Brett and Hardwicke also appeared on stage in 1988\u201389 in \"The Secret of Sherlock Holmes\", directed by Patrick Garland.\nIn the 2004\u20132012 Fox's show \"House\", the titular character Gregory House is an adaptation of Sherlock Holmes in a medical drama setting. The two characters share many parallels and House's name is a play on Holmes' one.\nThe 2009 film \"Sherlock Holmes\" earned Robert Downey Jr. a Golden Globe Award for his portrayal of Holmes and co-starred Jude Law as Watson. Downey and Law returned for a 2011 sequel, \"\".\nBenedict Cumberbatch plays a modern version of the detective and Martin Freeman as a modern version of John Watson in the BBC One TV series \"Sherlock\", which premiered in 2010. In the series, created by Mark Gatiss and Steven Moffat, the stories' original Victorian setting is replaced by present-day London, with Watson a veteran of the modern War in Afghanistan. Similarly, \"Elementary\" premiered on CBS in 2012 and ran for seven seasons until 2019. Set in contemporary New York City, the series stars Jonny Lee Miller as Sherlock Holmes and Lucy Liu as a female Dr. Joan Watson. The series was filmed primarily in\u00a0New York City, and, by the end of season two, Miller became the actor who had portrayed Sherlock Holmes the most in television and/or film.\nThe 2015 film \"Mr. Holmes\" starred Ian McKellen as a retired Sherlock Holmes living in Sussex, in 1947, who grapples with an unsolved case involving a beautiful woman. The film is based on Mitch Cullin's 2005 novel \"A Slight Trick of the Mind\".\nThe 2018 television adaptation, \"Miss Sherlock\", was a Japanese-language production and the first adaptation with a woman (portrayed by Y\u016bko Takeuchi) in the signature role. The episodes were based in modern-day Tokyo, with many references to Conan Doyle's stories.\nHolmes has also appeared in video games, including the \"Sherlock Holmes\" series of eight main titles. According to the publisher, Frogwares, by 2017 the series sold over seven million copies.\nCopyright issues.\nThe copyright for Conan Doyle's works expired in the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia at the end of 1980, fifty years after Conan Doyle's death. In the United Kingdom, it was revived in 1996 due to new provisions harmonising UK law with that of the European Union and expired again at the end of 2000, seventy years after Conan Doyle's death. The author's works are now in the public domain in those countries.\nIn the United States, all works published before 1923 entered public domain by 1998, but since ten Holmes stories were published after that date, the Conan Doyle estate maintained that the Holmes and Watson characters as a whole were still under copyright. In 2013, Leslie S. Klinger (lawyer and editor of \"The New Annotated Sherlock Holmes\") sued the Conan Doyle estate in order to have the characters of Holmes and Watson declared public domain in the United States. Klinger was successful: as a result, the only stories still under copyright in the US due to the ruling, as of that time, were those collected in \"The Case-Book of Sherlock Holmes\" other than \"The Adventure of the Mazarin Stone\" and \"The Problem of Thor Bridge\", a total of ten stories.\nAlthough the United States court ruling and the passage of time meant that most of the Holmes stories and characters were in the public domain in that country, in 2020 the Doyle estate legally challenged the use of Sherlock Holmes in the film \"Enola Holmes\" in a complaint filed in the United States. The Doyle estate alleged that the film depicts Holmes with personality traits that were only exhibited by the character in the stories still under copyright. On 18 December 2020, the lawsuit was dismissed with prejudice by stipulation of all parties.\nThe remaining ten Holmes stories moved out of copyright in the United States between 1 January 2019 and 1 January 2023, leaving the stories and characters completely in the public domain in the US as of the latter date.\nCultural references to Sherlock Holmes.\nBooks.\nOne of the first attempts was made in response to the \"Great Hiatus\" (when Arthur Conan Doyle decided not to write any more Holmes stories, to the dismay of his fans). Stepping into the breach, John Kendrick Bangs wrote Pursuit of the House-Boat (1897) [a sequel to his A House-Boat on the Styx (1895)], in which a deceased gentleman's clubhouse boat is stolen, whereupon Holmes arrives to help his fellow-deceased track down the boat by chartering a ship from Hades to London.\nHowever, in 1894, Conan Doyle decided to return to writing, bringing Holmes back from the dead by claiming he had faked his death in \"The Empty House\". While Bangs' attempt was reverential, Maurice Leblanc decided to write the short story \"Sherlock Holmes arrive trop tard\" (\"Sherlock Holmes Arrives Too Late\"). In it, Holmes meets the young thief Lupin for a brief time, unaware that he is, in fact, Lupin. After legal objections from Conan Doyle, the name was changed to \"Herlock Sholm\u00e8s\" with the pseudonym \"Holmlock Shears\" in the earliest English versions. The character returned in more installments of the Lupin series, starting with both stories of Volume 2, which was titled \"Ars\u00e8ne Lupin contre Herlock Sholm\u00e8s\". One of the more recent parodies in print is \"The Lord Mike Saga\", wherein Mycroft Miles (n\u00e9e Mills) is the Holmes figure, with the titles reflecting the styles: \"A Study in Varlets\", \"The Strange Case of the Moth-Eater of Clapham Common\", \"Happy Times and Places\", and \"A Cameo Broached\".\nFilm.\nIn the science fiction film \"Time After Time\" (1979) written and directed by Nicholas Meyer, H. G. Wells uses a time machine to go to the 1979 United States; he tries to use Sherlock Holmes as a false name, thinking the literary character would be forgotten by then.\nFrom 1984 to 1985, Japan's Tokyo Movie Shinsha and the Italian TV station RAI released 26 episodes of Sherlock Hound, a show featuring anthropomorphic dogs in various roles in the Sherlock Holmes world.\nWalt Disney Pictures released The Great Mouse Detective (July 2, 1986), wherein the character of Holmes is borrowed by a mouse.\nContinuing the print tradition of good-natured irreverence, the comedy film \"Without a Clue\" (1988) presents the premise that Holmes was a fictional creation of John Watson's, who was the true deductive genius. Once the character becomes popular, Watson is forced to hire an out-of-work actor to play Holmes.[12]\nIn the movie \"The Phantom of Baker Street\" (2002), the first film in the animated series written by Hisashi Nozawa, detective Conan goes into a virtual Victorian London where a computer simulated Holmes and Watson do not appear because they are working on another case, but Moriarty and Irene Adler do.\nWorks.\nShort story collections.\nThe short stories, originally published in magazines, were later collected in five anthologies:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The term is taken from the title of Terry Sanders's 1987 film \"Slow Fires: On the preservation of the human record.\"\nSolutions to this problem include the use of acid-free paper stocks, format shifting brittle books by microfilming, photocopying or digitization, and a variety of deacidification techniques.\nHistory.\nMuch of the early paper made from wood pulp contained significant amounts of alum, a variety of aluminium sulfate salt that is significantly acidic. Alum was added to paper to assist in sizing, making it somewhat water resistant so that inks did not \"run\" or spread uncontrollably. Early papermakers did not realize that the alum they added liberally to cure almost every problem encountered in making their product would be eventually detrimental. The cellulose fibres that make up paper are hydrolyzed by acid, and the presence of alum eventually degrades the fibres until the acidic paper disintegrates in a process known as \"slow fire\". Documents written on rag paper are significantly more stable. The use of non-acidic additives to make paper is becoming more prevalent, and the stability of these papers is less of an issue.\nPaper made from mechanical pulp contains significant amounts of lignin, a major component in wood. In the presence of light and oxygen, lignin reacts to give yellow materials, which is why newsprint and other mechanical paper yellows with age. Paper made from bleached kraft or sulfite pulps does not contain significant amounts of lignin and is therefore better suited for books, documents and other applications where whiteness of the paper is essential.\nPaper made from wood pulp is not necessarily less durable than a rag paper. The aging behaviour of a paper is determined by its manufacture, not the original source of the fibres. Furthermore, tests sponsored by the Library of Congress prove that all paper is at risk of acid decay, because cellulose itself produces formic, acetic, lactic and oxalic acids.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is the opposite of random access, the ability to access an arbitrary element of a sequence as easily and efficiently as any other at any time.\nSequential access is sometimes the only way of accessing the data, for example if it is on a tape. It may also be the access method of choice, for example if all that is wanted is to process a sequence of data elements in order.\nDefinition.\nThere is no consistent definition in computer science of sequential access or sequentiality. In fact, different sequentiality definitions can lead to different sequentiality quantification results. In spatial dimension, request size, stride distance, backward accesses, re-accesses can affect sequentiality. For temporal sequentiality, characteristics such as multi-stream and inter-arrival time threshold has impact on the definition of sequentiality.\nIn data structures, a data structure is said to have sequential access if one can only visit the values it contains in one particular order. The canonical example is the linked list. Indexing into a list that has sequential access requires O(\"n\") time, where \"n\" is the index. As a result, many algorithms such as quicksort and binary search degenerate into bad algorithms that are even less efficient than their naive alternatives; these algorithms are impractical without random access. On the other hand, some algorithms, typically those that do not have index, require only sequential access, such as mergesort, and face no penalty.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "27163", "revid": "38516105", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27163", "title": "Sed", "text": "Utility for transforming text\nsed (short for stream editor) is a utility that transforms text via a script written in a relatively simple and compact programming language. It was developed from 1973 to 1974 by Lee E. McMahon of Bell Labs,\nand is available today for most operating systems. The functionality of sed is based on the scripting features of the interactive editor ed (\"editor\", 1971) and the earlier qed (\"quick editor\", 1965\u201366). It was one of the earliest tools to support regular expressions, and remains in use for text processing, most notably with the substitution command. Popular alternative tools for plaintext string manipulation and \"stream editing\" include AWK and Perl. codice_1 is a shell command that runs the sed processor.\nHistory.\nFirst appearing in Version 7 Unix, sed is one of the early Unix utilities built for command line processing of data files. It evolved as the natural successor to the popular grep command. The original motivation was an analogue of grep (g/re/p) for substitution, hence \"g/re/s\". Foreseeing that further special-purpose programs for each command would also arise, such as g/re/d, McMahon wrote a general-purpose line-oriented stream editor, which became sed. The syntax for sed, notably the use of codice_2 for pattern matching, and codice_3 for substitution, originated with ed, the precursor to sed, which was in common use at the time, and the regular expression syntax has influenced other languages, notably ECMAScript and Perl. Later, the more powerful language AWK developed, and these functioned as cousins, allowing powerful text processing to be done by shell scripts. sed and AWK are often cited as progenitors and inspiration for Perl, and influenced Perl's syntax and semantics, notably in the matching and substitution operators.\nGNU sed added several new features, including in-place editing of files. \"Super-sed\" is an extended version of sed that includes regular expressions compatible with Perl. Another variant of sed is \"minised\", originally reverse-engineered from 4.1BSD sed by Eric S. Raymond and currently maintained by Ren\u00e9 Rebe. minised was used by the GNU Project until the GNU Project wrote a new version of sed based on the new GNU regular expression library. The current minised contains some extensions to BSD sed but is not as feature-rich as GNU sed. Its advantage is that it is very fast and uses little memory. It is used on embedded systems and is the version of sed provided with Minix.\nProcessing.\nsed reads text, line by line, from an input stream (such as a file) into an internal buffer called the \"pattern space\". As specified via a script, sed applies commands (called \"actions\" in sed documentation) to the pattern space. Unless directed otherwise, sed then outputs the pattern space (the modified line) and begins the cycle again with the next line. Other end-of-script behaviors are available via command-line options and via script commands such as codice_4 to delete the pattern space, codice_5 to quit, codice_6 to add the next line to the pattern space immediately. Thus, a sed script corresponds to the body of a loop that iterates through the lines of a stream, where the loop itself and the loop variable (the current line number) are implicit and maintained by sed.\nBecause the iteration over input lines, variables (pattern space and hold space), input and output streams, and default actions (copy line to pattern space, print pattern space) are implicit, it is possible to write terse one-liner programs. For example, the script prints the first 10 lines of input, then stops.\nUse.\nThe script can either be specified on the command line (codice_7 option) or read from a separate file (codice_8 option). \nCommands accept an optional \"address\" argument in terms of line numbers or regular expressions. The address determines when the command is run. For example, codice_9 would only run the codice_4 (delete) command on the second input line (printing all lines but the second), while codice_11 would delete all lines beginning with a space. A separate special buffer, the \"hold space\", may be used by a few commands to hold and accumulate text between cycles. The language provides only two variables (the \"hold space\" and the \"pattern space\") and GOTO-like branching functionality; nevertheless, the language is Turing-complete, and esoteric sed scripts exist for games such as sokoban, arkanoid, chess, and tetris.\nsed supports about 25 commands. Commonly-used commands are described below.\nSubstitution command.\nThe following example shows a typical, and the most common, use of sed: substitution. This usage was indeed the original motivation for sed:\nsed 's/regexp/replacement/g' inputFileName &gt; outputFileName\nIn some versions of sed, the expression must be preceded by codice_7 to indicate that an expression follows. The codice_13 stands for substitute, while the codice_14 stands for global, which means that all matching occurrences in the line would be replaced. The regular expression (i.e. pattern) to be searched is placed after the first delimiting symbol (slash here) and the replacement follows the second symbol. Slash (codice_2) is the conventional symbol, originating in the character for \"search\" in ed, but any other could be used to make syntax more readable if it does not occur in the pattern or replacement; this is useful to avoid \"leaning toothpick syndrome\".\nThe substitution command, which originates in search-and-replace in ed, implements simple parsing and templating. The codice_16 provides both pattern matching and saving text via sub-expressions, while the codice_17 can be either literal text, or a format string containing the characters codice_18 for \"entire match\" or the special escape sequences codice_19 to codice_20 for the \"n\"th saved sub-expression. For example, codice_21 replaces all occurrences of \"cat\" or \"dog\" with \"cats\" or \"dogs\", without duplicating an existing \"s\": codice_22 is the 1st (and only) saved sub-expression in the regexp, and codice_19 in the format string substitutes this into the output.\nOther sed commands.\nBesides substitution, other forms of simple processing are possible, using some 25 sed commands. For example, the following uses the \"d\" command to filter out lines that only contain spaces, or only contain the end of line character:\nsed '/^ *$/d' inputFileName\nThis example uses some of the following regular expression metacharacters (sed supports the full range of regular expressions):\nComplex sed constructs are possible, allowing it to serve as a simple, but highly specialized, programming language. Flow of control, for example, can be managed by the use of a label (a colon followed by a string) and the branch instruction codice_30, as well as the conditional branch codice_31. An instruction codice_30 followed by a valid label name will move processing to the command following that label. The codice_31 instruction will only do so if there was a successful substitution since the previous codice_31 (or the start of the program, in case of the first codice_31 encountered). Additionally, the codice_36 instruction starts a subsequence of commands (up to the matching codice_37); in most cases, it will be conditioned by an address pattern.\nsed used as a filter.\nUnder Unix, sed is often used as a filter in a pipeline:\n$ generateData | sed 's/x/y/g'\nThat is, a program such as \"generateData\" generates data, and then sed makes the small change of replacing \"x\" with \"y\". For example:\n$ echo xyz xyz | sed 's/x/y/g'\nyyz yyz\nFile-based sed scripts.\nIt is often useful to put several sed commands, one command per line, into a script file such as codice_38, and then use the codice_8 option to run the commands (such as codice_40) from the file:\nsed -f subst.sed inputFileName &gt; outputFileName\nAny number of commands may be placed into the script file, and using a script file also avoids problems with shell escaping or substitutions.\nSuch a script file may be made directly executable from the command line by prepending it with a \"shebang line\" containing the sed command and assigning the executable permission to the file. For example, a file codice_38 can be created with contents:\ns/x/y/g\nThe file may then be made executable by the current user with the codice_42 command:\nchmod u+x subst.sed\nThe file may then be executed directly from the command line:\nsubst.sed inputFileName &gt; outputFileName\nIn-place editing.\nThe codice_43 option, introduced in GNU sed, allows in-place editing of files (actually, a temporary output file is created in the background, and then the original file is replaced by the temporary file). For example:\nsed -i 's/abc/def/' fileName\nExamples.\nHello, world! example.\ns/.*/Hello, world!/\nq\nThis \"Hello, world!\" script is in a file (e.g., script.txt) and invoked with codice_44, where \"inputFileName\" is the input text file. The script changes \"inputFileName\" line #1 to \"Hello, world!\" and then quits, printing the result before sed exits. Any input lines past line #1 are not read, and not printed. So the sole output is \"Hello, world!\".\nThe example emphasizes many key characteristics of sed:\nOther simple examples.\nBelow follow various sed scripts; these can be executed by passing as an argument to sed, or put in a separate file and executed via codice_8 or by making the script itself executable.\nTo replace any instance of a certain word in a file with \"REDACTED\", such as an IRC password, and save the result:\n$ sed -i \"s/yourpassword/REDACTED/g\" ./status.chat.log\nTo delete any line containing the word \"yourword\" (the \"address\" is '/yourword/'):\n/yourword/ d\nTo delete all instances of the word \"yourword\":\ns/yourword//g\nTo delete two words from a file simultaneously:\ns/firstword//g\ns/secondword//g\nTo express the previous example on one line, such as when entering at the command line, one may join two commands via the semicolon:\n$ sed \"s/firstword//g; s/secondword//g\" inputFileName\nMultiline processing example.\nIn the next example, sed, which usually only works on one line, removes newlines from sentences where the second line starts with one space.\nConsider the following text:\n This is my dog,\n whose name is Frank.\n This is my fish,\n whose name is George.\n This is my goat,\n whose name is Adam.\nThe sed script below will turn the text above into the following text. Note that the script affects only the input lines that start with a space:\n This is my dog, whose name is Frank.\n This is my fish,\n whose name is George.\n This is my goat, whose name is Adam.\nThe script is:\n N\n s/\\n / /\n P\n D\nThis is explained as:\nThis can be expressed on a single line via semicolons:\n sed \" inputFileName\nLimitations and alternatives.\nWhile simple and limited, sed is sufficiently powerful for a large number of purposes. For more sophisticated processing, more powerful languages such as AWK or Perl are used instead. These are particularly used if transforming a line in a way more complicated than a regex extracting and template replacement, though arbitrarily complicated transforms are in principle possible by using the hold buffer.\nConversely, for simpler operations, specialized Unix utilities such as grep (print lines matching a pattern), head (print the first part of a file), tail (print the last part of a file), and tr (translate or delete characters) are often preferable. For the specific tasks they are designed to carry out, such specialized utilities are usually simpler, clearer, and faster than a more general solution such as sed.\nThe ed/sed commands and syntax continue to be used in descendent programs, such as the text editors vi and vim. An analog to ed/sed is sam/ssam, where sam is the Plan 9 editor, and ssam is a stream interface to it, yielding functionality similar to sed.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\nShell and Utilities Reference, The Single UNIX Specification, Version 5 from The Open Group"}

Based in Montgomery, Alabama, it is known for its legal cases against white supremacist groups, for its classification of hate groups and other extremist organizations, and for promoting tolerance education programs. The SPLC was founded by Morris Dees, Joseph J. Levin Jr., and Julian Bond in 1971 as a civil rights law firm in Montgomery.\nIn 1980, the SPLC began a litigation strategy of filing civil suits for monetary damages on behalf of the victims of violence from the Ku Klux Klan. The SPLC also became involved in other civil rights causes, including cases to challenge what it sees as institutional racial segregation and discrimination, inhumane and unconstitutional conditions in prisons and detention centers, discrimination based on sexual orientation, mistreatment of illegal immigrants, and the unconstitutional mixing of church and state. The SPLC has provided information about hate groups to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and other law enforcement agencies. As of October 3, 2025, the FBI has cut ties to the Southern Poverty Law Center. FBI Director Kash Patel said, \"Their so-called 'hate map' has been used to defame mainstream Americans and even inspired violence.\"\nSince the 2000s, the SPLC's classification and listings of hate groups (organizations that \"attack or malign an entire class of people, typically for their immutable characteristics\") and anti-government extremists have been widely relied upon by academic and media sources. The SPLC's listings have also been criticized by those who argue that some of the SPLC's listings are overbroad, politically motivated, or unwarranted. The organization has also been accused of an overindulgent use of funds, leading some employees to call its headquarters \"Poverty Palace\".\nHistory.\nThe Southern Poverty Law Center was founded by civil rights lawyers Morris Dees and Joseph J. Levin Jr. in August 1971 as a law firm originally focused on issues such as fighting poverty, racial discrimination and the death penalty in the US. Dees asked civil rights leader Julian Bond to serve as president, a largely honorary position; he resigned in 1979 but remained on the board of directors until his death in 2015.\nIn 1979, Dees and the SPLC began filing civil lawsuits against Ku Klux Klan chapters and similar organizations for monetary damages on behalf of their victims. The favorable verdicts from these suits served to bankrupt the KKK and other targeted organizations. According to a 1996 article in \"The New York Times\", Dees and the SPLC \"have been credited with devising innovative legal ways to cripple hate groups, including seizing their assets.\" Some civil libertarians said that SPLC's tactics chill free speech and set legal precedents that could be applied against activist groups which are not hate groups.\nIn 1981, the Center began its \"Klanwatch\" project to monitor the activities of the KKK. That project, later called \"Hatewatch\", was later expanded to include seven other types of hate organizations.\nIn 1986, the entire legal staff of the SPLC, excluding Dees, resigned as the organization shifted from traditional civil rights work toward fighting right-wing extremism. In 1989, the Center unveiled its Civil Rights Memorial, which was designed by Maya Lin.\nIn 1995, the \"Montgomery Advertiser\" won a Pulitzer Prize recognition for work that probed management self-interest, questionable practices, and employee racial discrimination allegations in the SPLC.\nThe Center's \"Teaching Tolerance\" project was initiated in 1991.\nIn 2008, the SPLC and Dees were featured on \"National Geographic\"'s \"Inside American Terror\" explaining their litigation strategy against the Ku Klux Klan.\nIn 2011, the SPLC was \"involved in high-profile state fights\", including the battle over the Georgia House Bill 87 (HB 87). The SPLC joined with the ACLU, the Asian Law Caucus, and the National Immigration Law Center in June 2011, to file a lawsuit challenging HB 87. which resulted in a permanent injunction in 2013 blocking multiple provisions of the law.\nIn 2013, \"Teaching Tolerance\" was cited as \"of the most widely read periodicals dedicated to diversity and social justice in education\".\nIn 2016, the SPLC's \"ranks swelled\" and its \"endowment surged\" after U.S. President Donald Trump was elected, resulting in the hiring of 200 new employees.\nIn 2018, The SPLC filed suits related to the conditions of incarceration for adults and juveniles.\nIn March 2019, founder Morris Dees was fired. In April, Karen Baynes-Dunning was named as interim president and CEO. After a \"tumultuous year\", in mid-December 2019, staff at the SPLC voted to unionize, with 142 in favor and 45 against. The SPLC had \"long been dogged by accusations of internal discrimination against minority employees, particularly in the area of promotions.\" A new president and CEO, Margaret Huang, was named in early February 2020. Huang resigned in July 2025 and was replaced by interim CEO Bryan Fair.\nThe SPLC and the ACLU have been involved in \"battles over the treatment of inmates in the state's prisons\", including an emergency request in April 2020 for the \"release of tens of thousands of people in ICE custody\" if ICE cannot provide protection for vulnerable inmates during the COVID-19 pandemic. The federal court injunction was filed as part of an existing class-action lawsuit regarding conditions in ICE facilities.\nIn June 2024, 80 people, representing 25% of the SPLC's workforce, were laid off. In September 2024, 92% of remaining SPLC staffers supported a no-confidence motion on the organization's CEO, Margaret Huang. The workers demanded a reversal of the mass layoff, which they characterized as a union-busting tactic, and the hiring of a new CEO. The chair of the union's bargaining committee called the layoffs \"sloppy, dispassionate, inhumane. It has been the absolute opposite of what the organization says they stand for and absolute chaos since then.\" SPLC leadership dismissed the union's request to remove Huang as CEO. Huang resigned as CEO in July 2025.\nLeadership upheaval amid harassment allegations.\nIn March 2019, the SPLC fired founder Morris Dees for undisclosed reasons and removed his profile from the SPLC website. In a statement regarding the firing, the SPLC announced it would be bringing in an \"outside organization to conduct a comprehensive assessment of our internal climate and workplace practices.\"\nFollowing the dismissal, a letter signed by two dozen SPLC employees was sent to management, expressing concern that \"allegations of mistreatment, sexual harassment, gender discrimination, and racism threaten the moral authority of this organization and our integrity along with it.\" One former employee wrote that the \"unchecked power of lavishly compensated white men at the top\" of the SPLC contributed to a culture which made black and female employees the targets of harassment.\nA week later, President Richard Cohen and legal director Rhonda Brownstein announced their resignations amid the internal upheaval. The associate legal director Meredith Horton quit, alleging concerns regarding workplace culture. Cohen said, \"Whatever problems exist at the SPLC happened on my watch, so I take responsibility for them.\"\nAdministration.\nIn early February 2020, Margaret Huang, who was formerly the chief executive at Amnesty International USA, was named as president and CEO of the SPLC. Huang replaced Karen Baynes-Dunning, a former juvenile court judge, who had served as interim president and CEO since April 2019, after founder Morris Dees was fired in March 2019. The SPLC had appointed Tina Tchen, a former chief of staff for former first lady Michelle Obama, to review and investigate any issues with the organization's workplace environment related to Dees' firing. Huang resigned in July 2025 and was replaced by interim CEO Bryan Fair.\nFundraising and finances.\nThe SPLC's activities, including litigation, are supported by fundraising efforts, and it does not accept any fees or share in legal judgments awarded to clients it represents in court. Starting in 1974, the SPLC set aside money for its endowment stating that it was \"convinced that the day [would] come when non-profit groups [would] no longer be able to rely on support through mail because of posting and printing costs\".\nThe \"Los Angeles Times\" reported that by 2017, the SPLC's financial resources \"nearly totaled half a billion dollars in assets\". In 2023, its endowment was $749 million, its revenue was $170 million, and its expenses totaled $122 million. In 2024, revenue and expenses were both $129 million and the group's endowment grew to $822 million.\nPrior to his departure in 2019, Dees' \"role at the Center was focused on 'donor relations' and 'expanding the Center's financial resources.'\"\nThe SPLC's related 501(c)(4) organization, the SPLC Action Fund, formed two political action committees in 2022: New Southern Leaders federal PAC and the New Southern Majority federal Super PAC. The New Southern Leaders PAC spent more than $21,000 in 2023-24, most going to the SPLC Action Fund, which spent more than $1,000,000 in independent expenditures in the 2019-20 election cycle.https://\nCharity ratings.\nAs of 2023[ [update]], based on figures from Fiscal Year 2022, Charity Navigator rated the SPLC four out of four stars, with an overall score of 99/100 for \"Accountability &amp; Finance\". The missing point was due to SPLC failing to post a \"Donor Privacy Policy\" on its website. SPLC's 2022 revenue totaled $140,350,982, and its expenses amounted to $111,043,025. According to Charity Navigator's Historical Ratings, SPLC has earned four-star ratings since 2019.\nAs of 2023[ [update]], SPLC has earned the GuideStar Gold Seal of Transparency, which is given to organizations that voluntarily share their financials and \"highlight their commitment to inclusivity to gain funders' trust and support.\" SPLC previously earned GuideStar's Platinum Seal of Transparency, but did not retain it.\nIn 2023[ [update]], CharityWatch initially gave SPLC a grade of B based on its 2021 financials. CharityWatch, however, downgrades all charities that \"hoard\" donations, which per CharityWatch's definition occurs whenever \"a charity's available assets in reserve exceeds three years' worth its annual budget.\" In particular, CharityWatch automatically \"downgrades to an F rating any charity holding available assets in reserve equal to 5 years or more of its annual budget.\" In accordance with this policy, on none }} CharityWatch downgraded SPLC from B to F because it had 7.3 years of available assets in reserve, it spent 68% of its funds on programs, and it cost $20 to raise $100.\nThe SPLC declined to submit information or be evaluated by the Charity Accountability section of the Better Business Bureau.\nCriminal attacks and plots against the SPLC.\nIn July 1983, the SPLC headquarters was firebombed, destroying the building and records. In February 1985, Klansmen Joe M. Garner and Roy T. Downs Jr., along with Klan sympathizer Charles Bailey, pleaded guilty to conspiring to intimidate, oppress and threaten members of black organizations represented by SPLC. The SPLC built a new headquarters building from 1999 to 2001.\nIn 1984, Morris Dees became an assassination target of the Order, a revolutionary white supremacist group. By 2007, according to Dees, more than 30 people had been jailed in connection with plots to kill him or to blow up SPLC offices.\nIn 1995, four men were indicted for planning to blow up the SPLC headquarters. In May 1998, three white supremacists were arrested for allegedly planning a nationwide campaign of assassinations and bombings targeting Morris Dees and his Southern Poverty Law Center in Alabama as well as the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles, the Anti-Defamation League in New York, an undisclosed federal judge in Illinois and a black radio show host in Missouri.\nNotable SPLC civil cases on behalf of clients.\nThe Southern Poverty Law Center has initiated a number of civil cases seeking injunctive relief and monetary awards on behalf of its clients. The SPLC has said it does not accept any portion of monetary judgments.\n\"Sims v. Amos\" (1974).\nAn early SPLC case was \"Sims v. Amos\" (consolidated with \"Nixon v. Brewer\") in which the U.S. District Court for the Middle of Alabama ordered the state legislature to reapportion its election system. The result of the decision, which the U.S. Supreme Court affirmed, was that fifteen black legislators were elected in 1974.\n\"Brown v. Invisible Empire, KKK\" (1980).\nIn 1979, the Klan began a summer of attacks against civil rights groups, beginning in Alabama. In Decatur, Alabama, Klan members clashed with a group of civil rights marchers. There were a hundred Klan members carrying \"bats, ax handles and guns\". A black woman, Bernice Brown, was shot and other marchers were violently attacked. In \"Brown v. Invisible Empire, Knights of the Ku Klux Klan\", filed in 1980 in the USDC Northern District of Alabama, the SPLC sued the Invisible Empire, Knights of the Ku Klux Klan on behalf of plaintiffs, Brown and other black marchers. The civil suit was settled in 1990 and \"required Klansmen to pay damages, perform community service, and refrain from white supremacist activity.\" Chalmers wrote in \"Backfire\", that the Klan had been in serious decline since the end of the 1970s. He described the \"Klan summer of 1979\", as a \"catastrophe\" for the Klan, as the SPLC's newly established Klanwatch, which became a \"powerful weapon\" that \"tracked and litigated\" the Klan. According to Chalmers, \"[b]eginning with the Decatur street confrontation, the SPLC's Klanwatch began suing various Klans in federal court for civil rights violations\", and as a result, the Klan lost credibility and its resources were depleted. As a result of the SPLC, the FBI reopen their case against the Klan, and \"nine Klansmen were eventually convicted of criminal charges\" related to the Decatur confrontation of 1979.\nVietnamese fishermen (1981).\nIn 1981, the SPLC took Ku Klux Klan leader Louis Beam's Klan-associated militia, the Texas Emergency Reserve (TER), to court to stop racial harassment and intimidation of Vietnamese shrimpers in and around Galveston Bay. The Klan's actions against approximately 100 Vietnamese shrimpers in the area included a cross burning, sniper fire aimed at them, and arsonists burning their boats.\nIn May 1981, U.S. District Court judge Gabrielle Kirk McDonald issued a preliminary injunction against the Klan, requiring them to cease intimidating, threatening, or harassing the Vietnamese. McDonald eventually found the TER and Beam liable for tortious interference, violations of the Sherman Antitrust Act, and of various civil rights statutes and thus permanently enjoined them against violence, threatening behavior, and other harassment of the Vietnamese shrimpers. The SPLC also uncovered an obscure Texas law \"that forbade private armies in that state\". McDonald found that Beam's organization violated it and hence ordered the TER to close its military training camp.\n\"Person v. Carolina Knights of the Ku Klux Klan\" (1982).\nIn 1982, armed members of the Carolina Knights of the Ku Klux Klan terrorized Bobby Person, a black prison guard, and members of his family. They harassed and threatened others, including a white woman who had befriended blacks. In 1984, Person became the lead plaintiff in \"Person v. Carolina Knights of the Ku Klux Klan\", a lawsuit brought by the SPLC in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina. The harassment and threats continued during litigation and the court issued an order prohibiting any person from interfering with others inside the courthouse. In January 1985, the court issued a consent order that prohibited the group's \"Grand Dragon\", Frazier Glenn Miller Jr., and his followers from operating a paramilitary organization, holding parades in black neighborhoods, and from harassing, threatening or harming any black person or white persons who associated with black persons. Subsequently, the court dismissed the plaintiffs' claim for damages.\nWithin a year, the court found Miller and his followers, now calling themselves the White Patriot Party, in criminal contempt for violating the consent order. Miller was sentenced to six months in prison followed by a three-year probationary period, during which he was banned from associating with members of any racist group such as the White Patriot Party. Miller refused to obey the terms of his probation. He made underground \"declarations of war\" against Jews and the federal government before being arrested again. Found guilty of weapons violations, he went to federal prison for three years.\nUnited Klans of America.\nIn 1987, Dees and Michael Figures won a case against the United Klans of America for the lynching of Michael Donald, a black teenager in Mobile, Alabama. The SPLC used an unprecedented legal strategy of holding an organization responsible for the crimes of individual members to help produce a $7\u00a0million judgment for the victim's mother. The verdict forced United Klans of America into bankruptcy. Its national headquarters was sold for approximately $52,000 to help satisfy the judgment.\nIn 1987, five members of a Klan offshoot, the White Patriot Party, were indicted for stealing military weaponry and plotting to kill Dees. The SPLC has since successfully used this precedent to force numerous Ku Klux Klan and other hate groups into bankruptcy.\nWhite Aryan Resistance.\nOn November 13, 1988, in Portland, Oregon, three white supremacist members of East Side White Pride and White Aryan Resistance (WAR) fatally assaulted Mulugeta Seraw, an Ethiopian man who came to the United States to attend college. In October 1990, the SPLC won a civil case on behalf of Seraw's family against WAR's operator Tom Metzger and his son, John, for a total of $12.5\u00a0million. The Metzgers declared bankruptcy, and WAR went out of business. The cost of work for the trial was absorbed by the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) as well as the SPLC. As of \u00a02007[ [update]], Metzger still makes payments to Seraw's family.\nChurch of the Creator.\nIn May 1991, Harold Mansfield, a black U.S. Navy war veteran, was murdered by George Loeb, a member of the neo-Nazi \"Church of the Creator\" (now called the Creativity Movement). SPLC represented the victim's family in a civil case and won a judgment of $1\u00a0million from the church in March 1994. The church transferred ownership to William Pierce, head of the National Alliance, to avoid paying money to Mansfield's heirs. The SPLC filed suit against Pierce for his role in the fraudulent scheme and won an $85,000 judgment against him in 1995. The amount was upheld on appeal and the money was collected prior to Pierce's death in 2002.\nChristian Knights of the KKK.\nThe SPLC won a $37.8\u00a0million verdict on behalf of Macedonia Baptist Church, a 100-year-old black church in Manning, South Carolina, against two Ku Klux Klan chapters and five Klansmen (Christian Knights of the Ku Klux Klan and Invisible Empire, Inc.) in July 1998. The money was awarded stemming from arson convictions; these Klan units burned down the historic black church in 1995. Morris Dees told the press, \"If we put the Christian Knights out of business, what's that worth? We don't look at what we can collect. It's what the jury thinks this egregious conduct is worth that matters, along with the message it sends.\" According to \"The Washington Post\" the amount is the \"largest-ever civil award for damages in a hate crime case.\"\nAryan Nations.\nIn September 2000, the SPLC won a $6.3\u00a0million judgment against Aryan Nations via an Idaho jury who awarded punitive and compensatory damages to a woman and her son who were attacked by Aryan Nations guards. The lawsuit stemmed from the July 1998 attack when security guards at Aryan Nations compound near Hayden Lake in northern Idaho, shot at Victoria Keenan and her son. Bullets struck their car several times, causing the car to crash. An Aryan Nations member held the Keenans at gunpoint. As a result of the judgment, Richard Butler turned over the compound to the Keenans, who sold the property to a philanthropist. He donated the land to North Idaho College, which designated the area as a \"peace park\".\nTen Commandments monument.\nIn 2002, the SPLC and the American Civil Liberties Union filed suit (\"Glassroth v. Moore\") against Alabama Supreme Court Chief Justice Roy Moore for placing a display of the Ten Commandments in the rotunda of the Alabama Judicial Building. Moore, who had final authority over what decorations were to be placed in the Alabama State Judicial Building's Rotunda, had installed a 5,280\u00a0pound (2,400\u00a0kg) granite block, three feet wide by three feet deep by four feet tall, of the Ten Commandments late at night without the knowledge of any other court justice. After defying several court rulings, Moore was eventually removed from the court and the Supreme Court justices had the monument removed from the building.\n\"Leiva v. Ranch Rescue\".\nIn 2003, the SPLC, the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, and local attorneys filed a civil suit, \"Leiva v. Ranch Rescue\", in Jim Hogg County, Texas, against Ranch Rescue, a vigilante paramilitary group and several of its associates, seeking damages for assault and illegal detention of two illegal immigrants caught near the U.S.-Mexico border. In April 2005, SPLC obtained judgments totaling $1 million against Casey James Nethercott, who was then Ranch Rescue's leader and the owner of an Arizona ranch, Camp Thunderbird, Joe Sutton, who owned the Hebbronville ranch on which two illegal immigrants has been caught trespassing on March 18, 2003, and Jack Foote, the founder of Ranch Rescue. Sutton, who had recruited Ranch Rescue to patrol the U.S.-Mexico border region near his Hebbronville ranch, settled with an $100,000 out-of-court settlement. According to the \"New York Times\", since neither Nethercott or Foote defended themselves, the \"judge issued default judgments of $850,000 against Mr. Nethercott and $500,000 against Mr. Foote. Neither men had \"substantial assets\" so Nethercott's ranch\u2014Camp Thunderbird\u2014which had also served as Ranch Rescue's headquarters\u2014was seized to pay the judgment and surrendered to the two illegal immigrants from El Salvador, Edwin Alfredo Manc\u00eda Gonz\u00e1les and F\u00e1tima del Socorro Leiva Medina. SPLC staff worked also with Texas prosecutors to obtain a conviction against Nethercott for possession of a gun, which was illegal for a felon. Nethercott had served time in California for assault previously. As a result, he was sentenced to serve a five-year sentence in a Texas prison.\nBilly Ray Johnson.\nThe SPLC brought a civil suit on behalf of Billy Ray Johnson, a black, mentally disabled man, who was severely beaten by four white males in Texas and left bleeding in a ditch, suffering permanent injuries. In 2007, Johnson was awarded $9\u00a0million in damages by a Linden, Texas jury. At a criminal trial, the four men were convicted of assault and received sentences of 30 to 60\u00a0days in county jail.\nImperial Klans of America.\nIn November 2008, the SPLC's case against the Imperial Klans of America (IKA), the nation's second-largest Klan organization, went to trial in Meade County, Kentucky. The SPLC had filed suit for damages in July 2007 on behalf of Jordan Gruver and his mother against the IKA in Kentucky. In July 2006, five Klan members went to the Meade County Fairgrounds in Brandenburg, Kentucky, \"to hand out business cards and flyers advertising a 'white-only' IKA function\". Two members of the Klan started calling Gruver, a 16-year-old boy of Panamanian descent, a \"spic\". Subsequently, the boy, ( and weighing ) was beaten and kicked by the Klansmen (one of whom was and ). As a result, the victim received \"two cracked ribs, a broken left forearm, multiple cuts and bruises and jaw injuries requiring extensive dental repair.\"\nIn a related criminal case in February 2007, Jarred Hensley and Andrew Watkins were sentenced to three years in prison for beating Gruver. On November 14, 2008, an all-white jury of seven men and seven women awarded $1.5 million in compensatory damages and $1 million in punitive damages to the plaintiff against Ron Edwards, Imperial Wizard of the group, and Jarred Hensley, who participated in the attack.\nMississippi correctional institutions.\nTogether with the ACLU National Prison Project, the SPLC filed a class-action suit in November 2010 against the owner/operators of the private Walnut Grove Youth Correctional Facility in Leake County, Mississippi, and the Mississippi Department of Corrections (MDC). They charged that conditions, including under-staffing and neglect of medical care, produced numerous and repeated abuses of youthful prisoners, high rates of violence and injury, and that one prisoner suffered brain damage because of inmate-on-inmate attacks. A federal civil rights investigation was undertaken by the United States Department of Justice. In settling the suit, Mississippi ended its contract with GEO Group in 2012. Additionally, under the court decree, the MDC moved the youthful offenders to state-run units. In 2012, Mississippi opened a new youthful offender unit at the Central Mississippi Correctional Facility in Rankin County. The state also agreed to not subject youthful offenders to solitary confinement and a court monitor conducted regular reviews of conditions at the facility.\nAlso with the ACLU Prison Project, the SPLC filed a class-action suit in May 2013 against Management and Training Corporation (MTC), the for-profit operator of the private East Mississippi Correctional Facility, and the MDC. Management and Training Corporation had been awarded a contract for this and two other facilities in Mississippi in 2012 following the removal of GEO Group. The suit charged failure of MTC to make needed improvements, and to maintain proper conditions and treatment for this special needs population of prisoners. In 2015 the court granted the plaintiffs' motion for class certification.\nPolk County, Florida, sheriff.\nIn 2012, the SPLC initiated a class action federal lawsuit against the Polk County, Florida, sheriff, Grady Judd, alleging that seven juveniles confined by the sheriff were suffering in improper conditions. U.S. district court judge Steven D. Merryday found in favor of Judd, who said the SPLC's allegations \"were not supported by the facts or court precedence [\"sic\"].\" The judge wrote that \"the conditions of juvenile detention at (Central County Jail) are not consistent with (Southern Poverty's) dark, grim, and condemning portrayal.\" While the county sheriff's department did not recover an estimated $1 million in attorney's fees defending the case, Judge Merryday did award $103,000 in court costs to Polk County.\nAndrew Anglin and \"The Daily Stormer\".\nIn April 2017, the SPLC filed a federal lawsuit on behalf of Tanya Gersh, accusing Andrew Anglin, publisher of the white supremacist website \"The Daily Stormer\", of instigating an anti-Semitic harassment campaign against Gersh, a Whitefish, Montana, real estate agent. In July 2019, a judge issued a 14 million dollar default judgment against Anglin, who is in hiding and has refused to appear in court.\nLawsuits against and criticism of the SPLC.\nIn October 2014, the SPLC added Ben Carson to its extremist watch list, citing his association with groups it considers extreme, and his \"linking of gays with pedophiles\". Following criticism, the SPLC concluded its profile of Carson did not meet its standards, removed his listing, and apologized to him in February 2015.\nIn October 2016, the SPLC published its \"Field Guide to Anti-Muslim Extremists\", which listed the British activist Maajid Nawaz and a nonprofit group he founded, the Quilliam Foundation. Nawaz, who identifies as a \"liberal, reform Muslim\", denounced the listing as a \"smear\", saying that the SPLC listing had made him a target of jihadists. In June 2018, the SPLC issued an apology, stating:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Given our understanding of the views of Mr. Nawaz and Quilliam, it was our opinion at the time that the \"Field Guide\" was published that their inclusion was warranted. But after getting a deeper understanding of their views and after hearing from others for whom we have great respect, we realize that we were simply wrong to have included Mr. Nawaz and Quilliam in the \"Field Guide\" in the first place.\nAlong with the apology, the SPLC paid US$3.375 million to Nawaz and the Quilliam Foundation in a settlement. Nawaz said about the settlement that Quilliam \"will continue to combat extremists by defying Muslim stereotypes, calling out fundamentalism in our own communities, and speaking out against anti-Muslim hate.\" The SPLC ultimately removed the \"Field Guide\" from its website.\nIn August 2017, a defamation lawsuit was filed against the SPLC by the D. James Kennedy Ministries for describing it as an \"active hate group\" because of their views on LGBT rights. The SPLC lists D. James Kennedy Ministries and its predecessor, Truth in Action, as anti-LGBT hate groups because of what the SPLC describes as the group's history of spreading homophobic propaganda, including D. James Kennedy's false statement that \"homosexuals prey on adolescent boys\", and false claims about the transmission of AIDS. On February 21, 2018, a federal magistrate judge recommended that the suit be dismissed with prejudice, concluding that D. James Kennedy Ministries could not show that it had been libeled. On September 19, 2019, the lawsuit was dismissed by Judge Myron H. Thompson, who ruled that the \"SPLC's labeling of the group as [a hate group] is protected by the First Amendment.\"\nIn March 2018, several journalists, including Max Blumenthal, were mentioned in an article by Alexander Reid Ross which the SPLC retracted after receiving complaints from those journalists that the article falsely portrayed them as \"white supremacists, fascists, anti-Semites, and engaging in a conspiracy with the Putin regime to promote such views\"; the Center's letter explaining its retraction of the article apologizing to Blumenthal and the other journalists who believed they had been falsely portrayed. The SPLC was criticized for taking down this article and was accused of caving in to pressure. The article argued that the dissemination of conspiracy theories around such issues as the Syrian Civil War (about the White Helmets and child refugees) were intended to co-opt leftist anti-imperialism in the service of a fascist agenda. Subsequently, the SPLC retracted two other articles written by Alexander Reid Ross on the topic of Russian campaigns to influence Western public opinion.\nIn 2019, the Center for Immigration Studies (CIS) sued the SPLC for designating the CIS as a hate group, claiming it constituted fraud under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO). The SPLC defended its decision and said the group \"richly deserved\" the designation. Cornell law professor William A. Jacobson, a longtime critic of the SPLC, criticized the listing of the CIS as \"pos[ing] a danger of being exploited as an excuse to silence speech and to skew political debate.\" The lawsuit was dismissed in September 2019 for failure to state a claim; Judge Amy Berman Jackson ruled that the CIS could not show any violations of the RICO statute.\nIn February 2019, several months after resigning as chairman of the Proud Boys, Gavin McInnes filed a defamation lawsuit against the SPLC. The lawsuit was filed in federal court in Alabama over the SPLC's designation of the Proud Boys as a \"general hate\" group. The SPLC took the lawsuit \"as a compliment\" and an indication that \"we're doing our job.\" On its website, SPLC said that \"McInnes plays a duplicitous rhetorical game: rejecting white nationalism and, in particular, the term 'alt-right' while espousing some of its central tenets\" and that the group's \"rank-and-file [members] and leaders regularly spout white nationalist memes and maintain affiliations with known extremists. They are known for anti-Muslim and misogynistic rhetoric. Proud Boys have appeared alongside other hate groups at extremist gatherings like the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville.\" In addition to defamation, McInnes claimed tortious interference with economic advantage, \"false light invasion of privacy\" and \"aiding and abetting employment discrimination\". The day after filing the suit, McInnes announced that he had been re-hired by the Canadian far-right media group The Rebel Media. The SPLC filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit in July 2019.\nFBI Richmond Catholic memo.\nIn January 2023, the FBI Richmond Field Office produced an internal intelligence memo identifying \"radical traditionalist Catholics\" as potential domestic violent extremists, relying on the Southern Poverty Law Center's designation of nine \"radical traditionalist Catholic hate groups\" as a key source. Twenty state attorneys general criticized the FBI for citing the SPLC \"apparently without any independent vetting.\" Attorney General Merrick Garland testified that the FBI \"should not be relying on any single organization without doing its own work.\" The memo's authors told DOJ investigators they knew the SPLC and other sources had political bias but provided no caveats about credibility in the final document. \nRepublican Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley said he found at least 13 FBI documents produced between 2009 and 2023 that used what he called \"anti-Catholic terminology\" and relied on information from the SPLC. He quoted an email from one FBI agent saying that \"our overreliance on the SPLC for hate designation [of traditional Catholics] is... problematic.\" In October 2025, FBI Director Kash Patel announced the bureau was severing all ties with the SPLC, calling it a \"partisan smear machine.\"\nProjects and publishing platforms.\nHate Map.\nIn 1990, the SPLC began to publish an \"annual census of hate groups operating within the United States\".\nClassifications and listings of hate groups.\nOver the years the classifications and listings of hate groups expanded to reflect current social phenomena. By the 2000s, the term \"hate groups\" included organizations it has assessed either \"attack or malign an entire class of people, typically for their immutable characteristics\". The SPLC says that hate group activities may include speeches, marches, rallies, meetings, publishing, and leafleting. While some of these activities may include criminal acts, such as violence, not all the activities tracked by the SPLC are illegal or criminal.\nGroups that have been included as \"hate groups\" by the SPLC who reject that labelling include, for example, self-described men's rights groups A Voice for Men and Return of Kings, which the SPLC had described as \"male supremacist\", according to a 2018 \"Washington Post\" article.\nThe SPLC's identification and listings of hate groups and extremists has been the subject of controversy. The authors of the 2009 book \"The White Separatist Movement in the United States\", sociologists Betty A. Dobratz and Stephanie L. Shanks-Meile, who used the findings of the SPLC and other watchdog groups, said that the SPLC chose its causes with funding and donations in mind. Concerns have been raised that people and groups designated as \"hate groups\" by the SPLC were being targeted by protests or violence that prevent them from speaking. The SPLC stands behind the vast majority of its listings. In 2018, David A. Graham wrote in \"The Atlantic\" that while criticism of the SPLC had long existed, the sources of such criticism have expanded recently to include \"sympathetic observers and fellow researchers on hate groups\" concerned about the organization \"mixing its research and activist strains\".\nLaird Wilcox, an analyst of political fringe movements, has said the SPLC has taken an incautious approach to assigning the labels \"hate group\" and \"extremist\". SPLC spokesman Mark Potok responded that Wilcox \"had an ax to grind for a great many years\" and engaged in name calling against others doing anti-racist work.\nIn 2009, the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) argued that allies of America's Voice and Media Matters had used the SPLC designation of FAIR as a hate group to \"engage in unsubstantiated, invidious name-calling, smearing millions of people in this movement.\" FAIR and its leadership have been criticized by the SPLC as being sympathetic to, or overtly supportive of, white supremacist and identitarian ideologies, as the group's late founder had stated his belief that the United States should remain a majority-white country.\nIn 2010, a group of Republican politicians and conservative organizations criticized the SPLC in full-page advertisements in two Washington, D.C., newspapers for what they described as \"character assassination\" because the SPLC had listed the Family Research Council (FRC) as a hate group for alleged \"defaming of gays and lesbians\".\nIn August 2012, a gunman entered the Washington, D.C. headquarters of the Family Research Council with the intent to kill employees and smear Chick-fil-A sandwiches on the victims' faces. The gunman, Floyd Lee Corkins, stated that he chose FRC as a target because it was listed as an anti-gay group on the SPLC's website. A security guard was wounded but stopped Corkins from shooting anyone else. In the wake of the shooting, the SPLC was again criticized for listing FRC as an anti-gay hate group, including by liberal columnist Dana Milbank, while others defended the categorization. The SPLC defended its listing of anti-gay hate groups, stating that the groups were selected not because of their religious views, but on their \"propagation of known falsehoods about LGBT people... that have been thoroughly discredited by scientific authorities.\"\nSPLC Hatewatch.\nThe Hatewatch blog, created in c.\u20092007, publishes the work of its teams, including investigative journalists who \"monitor and expose\" activities of the \"American radical right\". Initially, its precursor\u2014the \"Klanwatch\" project\u2014which was established in 1981, focused on monitoring KKK activities. The Hatewatch blog, along with the \"Teaching Tolerance\" program and the Intelligence Report, highlights SPLC's work.\"\"\nAn in-depth 2018 Hatewatch report examined the roots and evolution of black-on-white crime rhetoric, from the mid-nineteenth century to the late 2010s. According to the report, \"[m]isrepresented crime statistics\" on \"black-on-white crime\" have become a \"main propaganda point of America's hate movement\". The report described how Dylann Roof, the perpetrator of the June 17, 2015, Charleston church shooting had written in his manifesto about his 2012 Google search for \"black-on-white crime\", which led him to be convinced that black men were a \"physical threat to white people\". One of the first sources was the Council of Conservative Citizens. The report shows that on November 22, 2015, then-Presidential Candidate Donald Trump retweeted a chart that had \"originated from a neo-Nazi account\" which displayed \"bogus crime statistics\". The SPLC report cited a November 23, 2005, \"Washington Post\" article that fact checked the figures in the graph. The tweet said that \"81 percent of whites are killed by black people\", while the FBI says that only 15 percent of white murder victims are killed by a black perpetrator; the large majority of white murder victims are killed by white perpetrators.\nTeaching Tolerance.\nSPLC's projects include the website Tolerance.org, which provides news on tolerance issues, education for children, guidebooks for activists, and resources for parents and teachers. The website received Webby Awards in 2002 and 2004 for Best Activism. Another product of Tolerance.org is the \"10 Ways To Fight Hate on Campus: A Response Guide for College Activists\" booklet.\nAnti-LGBTQ+ hate.\nIn 2023, the SPLC released a report entitled \"Combating Anti-LGBTQ+ Pseudoscience Through Accessible Informative Narratives\" that said \"a large, yet closely-maintained network of far right groups and individuals have increasingly relied on pseudoscience as a tool to advance their cause.\"\nDocumentaries.\nThe SPLC also produces documentary films. Two have won Academy Awards for Documentary Short Subject: \"A Time for Justice\" (1994) and \"\" (2004). In 2017 the SPLC began developing a six-part series with Black Box Management to document \"the normalization of far-right extremism in the age of Donald Trump.\"\nCooperation with law enforcement.\nThe SPLC cooperates with, and offers training to, law enforcement agencies, focusing \"on the history, background, leaders, and activities of far-right extremists in the United States\". The FBI has partnered with the SPLC and many other organizations \"to establish rapport, share information, address concerns, and cooperate in solving problems\" related to hate crimes. In a November 2018 briefing of law enforcement officials in Clark County, Washington, concerning the Proud Boys FBI agents suggested the use of various websites for more information, including that of the SPLC. The organization urged Chicago to fire a policeman who allegedly hid his association with the Proud Boys.\n\"Intelligence Report\".\nSince 1981, the SPLC's Intelligence Project has published a quarterly \"Intelligence Report\" that monitors what the SPLC considers radical right hate groups and extremists in the United States. The \"Intelligence Report\" provides information regarding organizational efforts and tactics of these groups and persons, and has been cited by scholars, including Rory M. McVeigh and David Mark Chalmers, as a reliable and comprehensive source on U.S. right-wing extremism and hate groups. In 2013 the SPLC donated the \"Intelligence Project\"'s documentation to the library of Duke University. The SPLC also publishes \"HateWatch Weekly\", a newsletter that follows racism and extremism, and the \"Hatewatch\" blog, whose subtitle is \"Keeping an Eye on the Radical Right\".\nTwo articles published in \"Intelligence Report\" have won \"Green Eyeshade Excellence in Journalism\" awards from the Society of Professional Journalists. \"Communing with the Council\", written by Heidi Beirich and Bob Moser, took third place for Investigative Journalism in the Magazine Division in 2004, and \"Southern Gothic\", by David Holthouse and Casey Sanchez, took second place for Feature Reporting in the Magazine Division in 2007.\nSince 2001, the SPLC has released an annual issue of the \"Intelligence Project\" called \"Year in Hate\", later renamed \"Year in Hate and Extremism\", in which it presents statistics on the numbers of hate groups in America. The current format of the report covers racial hate groups, nativist hate groups, and other right-wing extremist groups such as groups within the Patriot Movement. Jesse Walker, writing in \"Reason.com\", criticized the 2016 report, questioning whether the count was reliable, as it focused on the number of groups rather than the number of people in those groups or the size of the groups. Walker gives the example that the 2016 report itself concedes an increase in the number of KKK groups could be due to two large groups falling apart, leading to members creating smaller local groups.\nNotable publications and media coverage on the SPLC.\nIn May 1988, journalist John Egerton published his article entitled \"The Klan Basher\" in \"Foundation News\". In July 1988, he published a similar article, entitled \"Poverty Palace: How the Southern Poverty Law Center got rich fighting the Klan\", in \"The Progressive.\" A 1991 book entitled \"Shades of Gray: Dispatches from the Modern South\" included a chapter by Egerton on this theme, entitled \"Morris Dees and the Southern Poverty Law Center\".\nIn 1994, the \"Montgomery Advertiser\" published an eight-part critical report on the SPLC. The series was nominated as one of three finalists for a 1995 Pulitzer Prize in Explanatory Journalism for \"its probe of questionable management practices and self-interest at the Southern Poverty Law Center, the nation's best-endowed civil rights charity.\" According to the series, the SPLC had exaggerated the threat posed by the Klan and similar groups in order to raise money, discriminated against black employees, and used misleading fundraising tactics. From 1984 to 1994, the SPLC raised about $62 million in contributions and spent about $21 million on programs, according to the newspaper. SPLC's co-founder Joe Levin rejected the \"Advertiser's\" claims, saying that the series showed a lack of interest in the center's programs. Levin said that the newspaper had an obsessive interest in the SPLC's financial affairs and Mr. Dees' personal life, in order to smear the center and Mr. Dees.\"\nDavid Mark Chalmers, who is the author of \"Hooded Americanism: The History of the Ku Klux Klan\" published in 1987, also wrote a follow-up, \"Backfire, Backfire: How the Ku Klux Klan Helped the Civil Rights Movement\" in 2003, in which he described the SPLC's role in the decline of the Klan.\nIn 2006, a chapter on the SPLC by was published in the \"Encyclopedia of American civil liberties\" which described the history of the SPLC and its co-founder Morris Dees.\nThe National Geographic Channel television series included the 2008 episode entitled \"Inside American Terror\", which covered the SPLC's successful lawsuit against the Ku Klux Klan\".\"\nIn their 2009 book \"The White Separatist Movement in the United States: 'White Power, White Pride!'\", sociologists Betty A. Dobratz and Stephanie L. Shanks-Meile said that the SPLC's \"Klanwatch Intelligence Reports\" portrayed the KKK as more \"militant and dangerous with higher turnouts\" than what they personally had observed.\nLaurence Leamer's 2016 book, entitled \"The Lynching: The Epic Courtroom Battle That Brought Down the Klan\", centered around the role played by Morris Dees as SPLC's co-founder, who won the case against the Klan which provided the family of teenager Michael Donald, lynched by the Klan in 1981 in Mobile, Alabama with restitution from the Klan.\nIn 2013, J.M. Berger wrote in \"Foreign Policy\" that media organizations should be more cautious when citing the SPLC and ADL, arguing that they are \"not objective purveyors of data\".\nIn their 2015 book \"Culture Wars: An Encyclopedia of Issues, Viewpoints and Voices\", Roger Chapman and James Ciment cited the criticism of SPLC by journalist Ken Silverstein, who said that the SPLC's fundraising appeals and finances were deceptive.\nConservative columnist Marc Thiessen, in a June 2018 column for \"The Washington Post\", said that the SPLC had lost its credibility and \"become a caricature of itself\".\nIn the wake of Morris Dees' dismissal in March 2019, former SPLC staffer Bob Moser published an article in \"The New Yorker\", \"The Reckoning of Morris Dees and the Southern Poverty Law Center\", in which he described his disappointment with what the SPLC had become.\nThe English Wikipedia community considers the Southern Poverty Law Center to be \"generally reliable on topics related to hate groups and extremism in the United States\", but notes that it is \"\" and should be attributed.\nExplanatory notes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Sister-inline/styles.css\"/&gt; Media related to at Wikimedia Commons"}
{"id": "27165", "revid": "22831189", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27165", "title": "Sexism", "text": "Prejudice or discrimination based on a person's sex or gender\nSexism is prejudice or discrimination based on one's sex or gender. Sexism can affect anyone, but primarily affects women and girls. It has been linked to gender roles and stereotypes, and may include the belief that one sex or gender is intrinsically superior to another. Extreme sexism may foster sexual harassment, rape, and other forms of sexual violence. Discrimination in this context is defined as discrimination toward people based on their gender identity or their gender or sex differences. Sexism refers to violation of equal opportunities (formal equality) based on gender or refers to violation of equality of outcomes based on gender, also called substantive equality. Sexism may arise from social or cultural customs and norms.\nEtymology and definitions.\nSexism may be defined as discrimination, prejudice, or stereotyping based on gender, most often expressed toward women and girls.\nSexism may also be defined as an ideology which holds that one sex (usually men) is superior to another (usually women).\nAccording to legal scholar Fred R. Shapiro, the term \"sexism\" was most likely coined on November 18, 1965, by Pauline M. Leet during a \"Student-Faculty Forum\" at Franklin and Marshall College. Specifically, the word \"sexism\" appears in Leet's forum contribution \"Women and the Undergraduate\", and she defines it by comparing it to racism, stating in part: \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAccording to the \"Oxford English Dictionary\", the first appearance in print of the term \"sexism\" was in Caroline Bird's speech \"On Being Born Female\", delivered before the Episcopal Church Executive Council in Greenwich, Connecticut, and published in 1968 in \"Vital Speeches of the Day\".\nSociologists have examined sexism at the level of the individual as well as of social institutions. According to Richard Schaefer, sexism is perpetuated by all major social institutions. Sociologists describe parallels among other ideological systems of oppression such as racism, which also operates at both the individual and institutional level. Early female sociologists Charlotte Perkins Gilman, Ida B. Wells, and Harriet Martineau described systems of gender inequality, but did not use the term \"sexism\", which was coined later. Sociologists who adopted the functionalist paradigm, e.g. Talcott Parsons, understood gender inequality as the natural outcome of a dimorphic model of gender.\nPsychologists Mary Crawford and Rhoda Unger define sexism as prejudice held by individuals that encompasses \"negative attitudes and values about women as a group.\" Peter Glick and Susan Fiske coined the term \"ambivalent sexism\" to describe how stereotypes about women can be both positive and negative, and that individuals compartmentalize the stereotypes they hold into hostile sexism or benevolent sexism.\nFeminist author bell hooks defines sexism as a system of oppression that results in disadvantages for women. Feminist philosopher Marilyn Frye defines sexism as an \"attitudinal-conceptual-cognitive-orientational complex\" of male supremacy, male chauvinism, and misogyny.\nPhilosopher Kate Manne defines sexism as one branch of a patriarchal order. In her definition, sexism rationalizes and justifies patriarchal norms, in contrast with misogyny, the branch which polices and enforces patriarchal norms. Manne says that sexism often attempts to make patriarchal social arrangements seem natural, good, or inevitable so that there appears to be no reason to resist them.\nHistory.\nPre-agricultural world.\nEvidence is lacking to support the idea that many pre-agricultural societies afforded women a higher status than women today, however, historians are reasonably sure that women had roughly equal social power to men in many such societies. \nAncient civilizations.\nAfter the adoption of agriculture and sedentary cultures, the concept that one gender was inferior to the other was established; most often this was imposed upon women and girls. \nThe status of women in ancient Egypt depended on their fathers or husbands, but they had property rights and could attend court, including as plaintiffs. Examples of unequal treatment of women in the ancient world include written laws preventing women from participating in the political process; for instance, women in ancient Rome could not vote or hold political office. Another example is scholarly texts that indoctrinate children in female inferiority; women in ancient China were taught the Confucian principles that a woman should obey her father in childhood, husband in marriage, and son in widowhood. On the other hand, women of the Anglo-Saxon era were commonly afforded equal status.\nWitch hunts and trials.\nSexism may have been the impetus that fueled the witch trials between the 15th and 18th centuries. In early modern Europe, and in the European colonies in North America, claims were made that witches were a threat to Christendom. The misogyny of that period played a role in the persecution of these women.\nIn \"Malleus Maleficarum\" by Heinrich Kramer, the book which played a major role in the witch hunts and trials, the author argues that women are more likely to practice witchcraft than men, and writes that:\n All wickedness is but little to the wickedness of a woman\u00a0... What else is a woman but a foe to friendship, an inescapable punishment, a necessary evil, a natural temptation, a desirable calamity, a domestic danger, a delectable detriment, an evil of nature, painted with fair colors!\nWitchcraft remains illegal in several countries, including Saudi Arabia, where it is punishable by death. In 2011, a woman was beheaded in that country for \"witchcraft and sorcery\". Murders of women after being accused of witchcraft remain common in some parts of the world; for example, in Tanzania, about 500 elderly women are murdered each year following such accusations.\nWhen women are targeted with accusations of witchcraft and subsequent violence, it is often the case that several forms of discrimination interact \u2013 for example, discrimination based on gender with discrimination based on caste, as is the case in India and Nepal, where such crimes are relatively common.\nCoverture and other marriage regulations.\nUntil the 20th century, U.S. and English law observed the system of coverture, where \"by marriage, the husband and wife are one person in law; that is the very being or legal existence of the woman is suspended during the marriage\". U.S. women were not legally defined as \"persons\" until 1875 (\"Minor v. Happersett\", 88 U.S. 162). A similar legal doctrine, called marital power, existed under Roman Dutch law (and is still partially in force in present-day Eswatini).\nRestrictions on married women's rights were common in Western countries until a few decades ago: for instance, French married women obtained the right to work without their husband's permission in 1965, and in West Germany women obtained this right in 1977. During the Franco era, in Spain, a married woman required her husband's consent (called \"permiso marital\") for employment, ownership of property and traveling away from home; the \"permiso marital\" was abolished in 1975. In Australia, until 1983, a married woman's passport application had to be authorized by her husband.\nWomen in parts of the world continue to lose their legal rights in marriage. For example, Yemeni marriage regulations state that a wife must obey her husband and must not leave home without his permission. In Iraq, the law allows husbands to legally \"punish\" their wives. In the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Family Code states that the husband is the head of the household; the wife owes her obedience to her husband; a wife has to live with her husband wherever he chooses to live; and wives must have their husbands' authorization to bring a case in court or initiate other legal proceedings.\nAbuses and discriminatory practices against women in marriage are often rooted in financial payments such as dowry, bride price, and dower. These transactions often serve as legitimizing coercive control of the wife by her husband and in giving him authority over her; for instance Article 13 of the Code of Personal Status (Tunisia) states that, \"The husband shall not, in default of payment of the dower, force the woman to consummate the marriage\", implying that, if the dower is paid, marital rape is permitted. In this regard, critics have questioned the alleged gains of women in Tunisia, and its image as a progressive country in the region, arguing that discrimination against women remains very strong there.\nThe World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT) has recognized the \"independence and ability to leave an abusive husband\" as crucial in stopping mistreatment of women. However, in some parts of the world, once married, women have very little chance of leaving a violent husband: obtaining a divorce is very difficult in many jurisdictions because of the need to prove fault in court. While attempting a \"de facto\" separation (moving away from the marital home) is also impossible because of laws preventing this. For instance, in Afghanistan, a wife who leaves her marital home risks being imprisoned for \"running away\". In addition, many former British colonies, including India, maintain the concept of restitution of conjugal rights, under which a wife may be ordered by court to return to her husband; if she fails to do so, she may be held in contempt of court. Other problems have to do with the payment of the bride price: if the wife wants to leave, her husband may demand the return of the bride price that he had paid to the woman's family; and the woman's family often cannot or does not want to pay it back.\nLaws, regulations, and traditions related to marriage continue to discriminate against women in many parts of the world, and to contribute to the mistreatment of women, in particular in areas related to sexual violence and to self-determination regarding sexuality, the violation of the latter now being acknowledged as a violation of women's rights. In 2012, Navi Pillay, then High Commissioner for Human Rights, stated that:\nWomen are frequently treated as property, they are sold into marriage, into trafficking, into sexual slavery. Violence against women frequently takes the form of sexual violence. Victims of such violence are often accused of promiscuity and held responsible for their fate, while infertile women are rejected by husbands, families and communities. In many countries, married women may not refuse to have sexual relations with their husbands, and often have no say in whether they use contraception... Ensuring that women have full autonomy over their bodies is the first crucial step towards achieving substantive equality between women and men. Personal issues\u2014such as when, how and with whom they choose to have sex, and when, how and with whom they choose to have children\u2014are at the heart of living a life in dignity.\nSuffrage and politics.\nGender has been used as a tool for discrimination against women in the political sphere. Women's suffrage was not achieved until 1893, when New Zealand was the first country to grant women the right to vote. Saudi Arabia is the most recent country, as of August 2015, to extend the right to vote to women in 2011. Some Western countries allowed women the right to vote only relatively recently. Swiss women gained the right to vote in federal elections in 1971, and Appenzell Innerrhoden became the last canton to grant women the right to vote on local issues in 1991, when it was forced to do so by the Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland. French women were granted the right to vote in 1944. In Greece, women obtained the right to vote in 1952. In Liechtenstein, women obtained the right to vote in 1984, through the women's suffrage referendum of 1984.\nWhile almost every woman today has the right to vote, there is still progress to be made for women in politics. Studies have shown that in several democracies including Australia, Canada, and the United States, women are still represented using gender stereotypes in the press. Multiple authors have shown that gender differences in the media are less evident today than they used to be in the 1980s, but are still present. Certain issues (e.g., education) are likely to be linked with female candidates, while other issues (e.g., taxes) are likely to be linked with male candidates. In addition, there is more emphasis on female candidates' personal qualities, such as their appearance and their personality, as females are portrayed as emotional and dependent.\nThere is a widespread imbalance of lawmaking power between men and women. The ratio of women to men in legislatures is used as a measure of gender equality in the United Nations' Gender Empowerment Measure and its newer incarnation the Gender Inequality Index. Speaking about China, Lanyan Chen stated that, since men more than women serve as the gatekeepers of policy making, this may lead to women's needs not being properly represented. In this sense, the inequality in lawmaking power also causes gender discrimination.\nMenus.\nUntil the early 1980s, some high-end restaurants had two menus: a regular menu with the prices listed for men and a second menu for women, which did not have the prices listed (it was called the \"ladies' menu\"), so that the female diner would not know the prices of the items. In 1980, Kathleen Bick took a male business partner out to dinner at L'Orangerie in West Hollywood. After she was given a women's menu without prices and her guest got one with prices, Bick hired lawyer Gloria Allred to file a discrimination lawsuit, on the grounds that the women's menu went against the California Civil Rights Act. Bick stated that getting a women's menu without prices left her feeling \"humiliated and incensed\". The owners of the restaurant defended the practice, saying it was done as a courtesy, like the way men would stand up when a woman enters the room. Even though the lawsuit was dropped, the restaurant ended its gender-based menu policy.\nGender stereotypes.\nGender stereotypes are widely held beliefs about the characteristics and behavior of women and men. Empirical studies have found widely shared cultural beliefs that men are more socially valued and more competent than women in a number of activities. Dustin B. Thoman and others (2008) hypothesize that \"[t]he socio-cultural salience of ability versus other components of the gender-math stereotype may impact women pursuing math\". Through the experiment comparing the math outcomes of women under two various gender-math stereotype components, which are the ability of math and the effort on math respectively, Thoman and others found that women's math performance is more likely to be affected by the negative ability stereotype, which is influenced by sociocultural beliefs in the United States, rather than the effort component. As a result of this experiment and the sociocultural beliefs in the United States, Thoman and others concluded that individuals' academic outcomes can be affected by the gender-math stereotype component that is influenced by the sociocultural beliefs.\nDating.\nIn case of heterosexual dating, sexist social norms are widespread, such as men asking women out on dates or men proposing marriage while women avoid showing overt initiate. Some women reject gender egalitarian dating norms, such as women asking men out on dates, due to fear of rejection and benevolent sexism.\nIn language.\nSexism in language exists when language devalues members of a certain gender. Sexist language, in many instances, promotes male superiority. Sexism in language affects consciousness, perceptions of reality, encoding and transmitting cultural meanings and socialization. Researchers have pointed to the semantic rule in operation in language of the male-as-norm. This results in sexism as the male becomes the standard and those who are not male are relegated to the inferior. Sexism in language is considered a form of indirect sexism because it is not always overt.\nExamples include:\nSexist and gender-neutral language.\nVarious 20th century feminist movements, from liberal feminism and radical feminism to standpoint feminism, postmodern feminism and queer theory, have considered language in their theorizing. Most of these theories have maintained a critical stance on language that calls for a change in the way speakers use their language.\nOne of the most common calls is for gender-neutral language. Many have called attention, however, to the fact that the English language is not inherently sexist in its linguistic system, but the way it is used becomes sexist and gender-neutral language could thus be employed.\nSexism in languages other than English.\nRomanic languages such as French and Spanish may be seen as reinforcing sexism, in that the masculine form is the default. The word \"mademoiselle\", meaning \"miss\", was declared banished from French administrative forms in 2012 by Prime Minister Fran\u00e7ois Fillon. Current pressure calls for the use of the masculine plural pronoun as the default in a mixed-sex group to change. As for Spanish, Mexico's Ministry of the Interior published a guide on how to reduce the use of sexist language.\nGerman speakers have also raised questions about how sexism intersects with grammar. The German language is heavily inflected for gender, number, and case; nearly all nouns denoting the occupations or statuses of human beings are gender-differentiated. For more gender-neutral constructions, gerund nouns are sometimes used instead, as this eliminates the grammatical gender distinction in the plural, and significantly reduces it in the singular. For example, instead of \"die Studenten\" (\"the men students\") or \"die Studentinnen\" (\"the women students\"), one writes \"die Studierenden\" (\"the [people who are] studying\"). However, this approach introduces an element of ambiguity, because gerund nouns more precisely denote one currently engaged in the activity, rather than one who routinely engages in it as their primary occupation.\nIn Chinese, some writers have pointed to sexism inherent in the structure of written characters. For example, the character for man is linked to those for positive qualities like courage and effect while the character for wife is composed of a female part and a broom, considered of low worth.\nGender-specific pejorative terms.\nGender-specific pejorative terms intimidate or harm another person because of their gender. Sexism can be expressed in language with negative gender-oriented implications, such as condescension. For example, one may refer to a female as a \"girl\" rather than a \"woman\", implying that she is subordinate or not fully mature. Other examples include obscene language. Some words are offensive to transgender people, including \"tranny\", \"she-male\", or \"he-she\". Intentional misgendering (assigning the wrong gender to someone) and the pronoun \"it\" are also considered pejorative.\nAt work.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"Calling nurses by their first names\"\n The practice of using first names for individuals from a profession that is predominantly female occurs in health care. Physicians are typically referred to using their last name, but nurses are referred to, even by physicians they do not know, by their first name. According to Suzanne Gordon, a typical conversation between a physician and a nurse is: \"Hello Jane. I'm Dr. Smith. Would you hand me the patient's chart?\"\n\u2013\"Nursing Against the Odds: How Health Care Cost Cutting, Media Stereotypes, and Medical Hubris Undermine Nurses and Patient Care\"\nOccupational sexism refers to discriminatory practices, statements or actions, based on a person's sex, occurring in the workplace. One form of occupational sexism is wage discrimination. In 2008, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) found that while female employment rates have expanded and gender employment and wage gaps have narrowed nearly everywhere, on average women still have 20% less chance to have a job and are paid 17% less than men. The report stated: [In] many countries, labour market discrimination\u2014i.e. the unequal treatment of equally productive individuals only because they belong to a specific group\u2014is still a crucial factor inflating disparities in employment and the quality of job opportunities [...] Evidence presented in this edition of the \"Employment Outlook\" suggests that about 8percent of the variation in gender employment gaps and 30 percent of the variation in gender wage gaps across OECD countries can be explained by discriminatory practices in the labor market.\nIt also found that although almost all OECD countries, including the U.S., have established anti-discrimination laws, these laws are difficult to enforce.\nWomen who enter predominantly male work groups can experience the negative consequences of tokenism: performance pressures, social isolation, and role encapsulation.&lt;!-- Split from \":0\"--&gt; Tokenism could be used to camouflage sexism, to preserve male workers' advantage in the workplace. No link exists between the proportion of women working in an organization/company and the improvement of their working conditions. Ignoring sexist issues may exacerbate women's occupational problems.\nIn the \"World Values Survey\" of 2005, responders were asked if they thought wage work should be restricted to men only. In Iceland, the percentage that agreed was 3.6%, whereas in Egypt it was 94.9%.\nGap in hiring.\nResearch has repeatedly shown that mothers in the United States are less likely to be hired than equally qualified fathers and if hired, receive a lower salary than male applicants with children.\nOne study found that female applicants were favored; however, its results have been met with skepticism from other researchers, since it contradicts most other studies on the issue. Joan C. Williams, a distinguished professor at the University of California's Hastings College of Law, raised issues with its methodology, pointing out that the fictional female candidates it used were unusually well-qualified. Studies using more moderately qualified graduate students have found that male students are much more likely to be hired, offered better salaries, and offered mentorship.\nIn Europe, studies based on field experiments in the labor market, provide evidence for no severe levels of discrimination based on female gender. However, unequal treatment is still measured in particular situations, for instance, when candidates apply for positions at a higher functional level in Belgium, when they apply at their fertile ages in France, and when they apply for male-dominated occupations in Austria.\nEarnings gap.\nStudies have concluded that on average women earn lower wages than men worldwide. Some people argue that this results from widespread gender discrimination in the workplace. Others argue that the wage gap results from different choices by men and women, such as women placing more value than men on having children, and men being more likely than women to choose careers in high paying fields such as business, engineering, and technology.\nEurostat found a persistent, average gender pay gap of 27.5% in the 27 EU member states in 2008. Similarly, the OECD found that female full-time employees earned 27% less than their male counterparts in OECD countries in 2009.\nIn the United States, the female-to-male earnings ratio was 0.77 in 2009; female full-time, year-round (FTYR) workers earned 77% as much as male FTYR workers. Women's earnings relative to men's fell from 1960 to 1980 (56.7\u201354.2%), rose rapidly from 1980 to 1990 (54.2\u201367.6%), leveled off from 1990 to 2000 (67.6\u201371.2%) and rose from 2000 to 2009 (71.2\u201377.0%). As of the late 2010s, it has decreased back to around 1990 to 2000 levels (68.6-71.1%). When the first Equal Pay Act was passed in 1963, female full-time workers earned 48.9% as much as male full-time workers.\nResearch conducted in Czechia and Slovakia shows that, even after the governments passed anti-discrimination legislation, two thirds of the gender gap in wages remained unexplained and segregation continued to \"represent a major source of the gap\".\nThe gender gap can also vary across-occupation and within occupation. In Taiwan, for example, studies show how the bulk of gender wage discrepancies occur within-occupation. In Russia, research shows that the gender wage gap is distributed unevenly across income levels, and that it mainly occurs at the lower end of income distribution. The research also found that \"wage arrears and payment in-kind attenuated wage discrimination, particularly amongst the lowest paid workers, suggesting that Russian enterprise managers assigned lowest importance to equity considerations when allocating these forms of payment\".\nThe gender pay gap has been attributed to differences in personal and workplace characteristics between men and women (such as education, hours worked and occupation), innate behavioral and biological differences between men and women and discrimination in the labor market (such as gender stereotypes and customer and employer bias). Women take significantly more time off to raise children than men. In certain countries such as South Korea, it has also been a long-established practice to lay-off female employees upon marriage. A study by Professor Linda C. Babcock in her book \"Women Don't Ask\" shows that men are eight times more likely to ask for a pay raise, suggesting that pay inequality may be partly a result of behavioral differences between the sexes. However, studies generally find that a portion of the gender pay gap remains unexplained after accounting for factors assumed to influence earnings; the unexplained portion of the wage gap is attributed to gender discrimination.\nEstimates of the discriminatory component of the gender pay gap vary. The OECD estimated that approximately 30% of the gender pay gap across OECD countries is because of discrimination. Australian research shows that discrimination accounts for approximately 60% of the wage differential between men and women. Studies examining the gender pay gap in the United States show that a much of the wage differential remains unexplained, after controlling for factors affecting pay. One study of college graduates found that the portion of the pay gap unexplained after all other factors are taken into account is five percent one year after graduating and 12% a decade after graduation. A study by the American Association of University Women found that women graduates in the United States are paid less than men doing the same work and majoring in the same field.\nWage discrimination is theorized as contradicting the economic concept of supply and demand, which states that if a good or service (in this case, labor) is in demand and has value it will find its price in the market. If a worker offered equal value for less pay, supply and demand would indicate a greater demand for lower-paid workers. If a business hired lower-wage workers for the same work, it would lower its costs and enjoy a competitive advantage. According to supply and demand, if women offered equal value demand (and wages) should rise since they offer a better price (lower wages) for their service than men do.\nResearch at Cornell University and elsewhere indicates that mothers in the United States are less likely to be hired than equally qualified fathers and, if hired, receive a lower salary than male applicants with children. The OECD found that \"a significant impact of children on women's pay is generally found in the United Kingdom and the United States\". Fathers earn $7,500 more, on average, than men without children do.\nThere is research to suggest that the gender wage gap leads to big losses for the economy.\nIn some countries and age groups the gender pay gap has reversed.\nCauses for wage discrimination.\nThe non-adjusted gender pay gap (the difference without taking into account differences in working hours, occupations, education, and work experience) is not itself a measure of discrimination. Rather, it combines differences in the average pay of women and men to serve as a barometer of comparison. Differences in pay are caused by:\nSome variables that help explain the non-adjusted gender pay gap include economic activity, working time, and job tenure. Gender-specific factors, including gender differences in qualifications and discrimination, overall wage structure, and the differences in remuneration across industry sectors all influence the gender pay gap.\nEurostat estimated in 2016 that after allowing for average characteristics of men and women, women still earn 11.5% less than men. Since this estimate accounts for average differences between men and women, it is an estimation of the \"unexplained\" gender pay gap (i.e., that which cannot be accounted for by factors such as differences in profession).\nGlass ceiling effect.\n\"The popular notion of glass ceiling effects implies that gender (or other) disadvantages are stronger at the top of the hierarchy than at lower levels and that these disadvantages become worse later in a person's career.\"\nIn the United States, women account for 52% of the overall labor force, but make up only three percent of corporate CEOs and top executives. Some researchers see the root cause of this situation in the tacit discrimination based on gender, conducted by current top executives and corporate directors (primarily male), and \"the historic absence of women in top positions\", which \"may lead to hysteresis, preventing women from accessing powerful, male-dominated professional networks, or same-sex mentors\". The glass ceiling effect is noted as being especially persistent for women of color. According to a report, \"women of colour perceive a 'concrete ceiling' and not simply a glass ceiling\".\nIn the economics profession, it has been observed that women are more inclined than men to dedicate their time to teaching and service. Since continuous research work is crucial for promotion, \"the cumulative effect of small, contemporaneous differences in research orientation could generate the observed significant gender difference in promotion\". In the high-tech industry, research shows that, regardless of the intra-firm changes, \"extra-organizational pressures will likely contribute to continued gender stratification as firms upgrade, leading to the potential masculinization of skilled high-tech work\".\nThe United Nations asserts that \"progress in bringing women into leadership and decision making positions around the world remains far too slow\".\nPotential remedies.\nResearch by David Matsa and Amalia Miller suggests that a remedy to the glass ceiling could be increasing the number of women on corporate boards, which could lead to increases in the number of women working in top management positions. The same research suggests that this could also result in a \"feedback cycle in which the presence of more female managers increases the qualified pool of potential female board members (for the companies they manage, as well as other companies), leading to greater female board membership and then further increases in female executives\".\nWeight-based sexism.\nA 2009 study found that being overweight harms women's career advancement, but presents no barrier for men. Overweight women were significantly underrepresented among company bosses, making up between five and 22% of female CEOs. However, the proportion of overweight male CEOs was between 45% and 61%, over-representing overweight men. On the other hand, approximately five percent of CEOs were obese among both genders. The author of the study stated that the results suggest that \"the 'glass ceiling effect' on women's advancement may reflect not only general negative stereotypes about the competencies of women but also weight bias that results in the application of stricter appearance standards to women.\"\nTransgender discrimination.\nTransgender people also experience significant workplace discrimination and harassment. Unlike sex-based discrimination, refusing to hire (or firing) a worker for their gender identity or expression is not explicitly illegal in most U.S. states. In June 2020, the United States Supreme Court ruled that federal civil rights law protects gay, lesbian and transgender workers. Writing for the majority, Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote: \"An employer who fires an individual for being homosexual or transgender fires that person for traits or actions it would not have questioned in members of a different sex. Sex plays a necessary and undisguisable role in the decision, exactly what Title VII forbids.\" The ruling however did not protect LGBT employees from being fired based on their sexual orientation or gender identity in businesses of 15 workers or less.\nIn August 1995, Kimberly Nixon filed a complaint with the British Columbia Human Rights Tribunal against Vancouver Rape Relief &amp; Women's Shelter. Nixon, a trans woman, had been interested in volunteering as a counsellor with the shelter. When the shelter learned that she was transsexual, they told Nixon that she would not be allowed to volunteer with the organization. Nixon argued that this constituted illegal discrimination under Section 41 of the British Columbia \"Human Rights Code\". Vancouver Rape Relief countered that individuals are shaped by the socialization and experiences of their formative years, and that Nixon had been socialized as a male growing up, and that, therefore, Nixon would not be able to provide sufficiently effective counselling to the female born women that the shelter served. Nixon took her case to the Supreme Court of Canada, which refused to hear the case.\nObjectification.\nIn social philosophy, objectification is the act of treating a person as an object or thing. Objectification plays a central role in feminist theory, especially sexual objectification. Feminist writer and gender equality activist Joy Goh-Mah argues that by being objectified, a person is denied agency. According to the philosopher Martha Nussbaum, a person might be objectified if one or more of the following properties are applied to them:\nRae Helen Langton, in \"Sexual Solipsism: Philosophical Essays on Pornography and Objectification\", proposed three more properties to be added to Nussbaum's list:\nAccording to objectification theory, objectification can have important repercussions on women, particularly young women, as it can negatively impact their psychological health and lead to the development of mental disorders, such as unipolar depression, sexual dysfunction, and eating disorders.\nIn advertising.\nWhile advertising used to portray women and men in obviously stereotypical roles (e.g., as a housewife, breadwinner), in modern advertisements, they are no longer solely confined to their traditional roles. However, advertising today still stereotypes men and women, albeit in more subtle ways, including by sexually objectifying them. Women are most often targets of sexism in advertising. When in advertisements with men they are often shorter and put in the background of images, shown in more \"feminine\" poses, and generally present a higher degree of \"body display\".\nToday, some countries (for example Norway and Denmark) have laws against sexual objectification in advertising. Nudity is not banned, and nude people can be used to advertise a product if they are relevant to the product advertised. Sol Olving, head of Norway's Kreativt Forum (an association of the country's top advertising agencies) explained, \"You could have a naked person advertising shower gel or a cream, but not a woman in a bikini draped across a car\".\nOther countries continue to ban nudity (on traditional obscenity grounds), but also make explicit reference to sexual objectification, such as Israel's ban of billboards that \"depicts sexual humiliation or abasement, or presents a human being as an object available for sexual use\".\nPornography.\nAnti-pornography feminist Catharine MacKinnon argues that pornography contributes to sexism by objectifying women and portraying them in submissive roles. MacKinnon, along with Andrea Dworkin, argues that pornography reduces women to mere tools, and is a form of sex discrimination. The two scholars highlight the link between objectification and pornography by stating:\nWe define pornography as the graphic sexually explicit subordination of women through pictures and words that also includes (i) women are presented dehumanized as sexual objects, things, or commodities; or (ii) women are presented as sexual objects who enjoy humiliation or pain; or (iii) women are presented as sexual objects experiencing sexual pleasure in rape, incest or other sexual assault; or (iv) women are presented as sexual objects tied up, cut up or mutilated or bruised or physically hurt; or (v) women are presented in postures or positions of sexual submission, servility, or display; or (vi) women's body parts\u2014including but not limited to vaginas, breasts, or buttocks\u2014are exhibited such that women are reduced to those parts; or (vii) women are presented being penetrated by objects or animals; or (viii) women are presented in scenarios of degradation, humiliation, injury, torture, shown as filthy or inferior, bleeding, bruised, or hurt in a context that makes these conditions sexual.\"\nRobin Morgan and Catharine MacKinnon suggest that certain types of pornography also contribute to violence against women by eroticizing scenes in which women are dominated, coerced, humiliated or sexually assaulted.\nSome people opposed to pornography, including MacKinnon, charge that the production of pornography entails physical, psychological, and economic coercion of the women who perform and model in it. Opponents of pornography charge that it presents a distorted image of sexual relations and reinforces sexual myths; it shows women as continually available and willing to engage in sex at any time, with any person, on their terms, responding positively to any requests.\nMacKinnon writes:\nPornography affects people's belief in rape myths. So for example if a woman says \"I didn't consent\" and people have been viewing pornography, they believe rape myths and believe the woman did consent no matter what she said. That when she said no, she meant yes. When she said she didn't want to, that meant more beer. When she said she would prefer to go home, that means she's a lesbian who needs to be given a good corrective experience. Pornography promotes these rape myths and desensitizes people to violence against women so that you need more violence to become sexually aroused if you're a pornography consumer. This is very well documented.\nDefenders of pornography and anti-censorship activists (including sex-positive feminists) argue that pornography does not seriously impact a mentally healthy individual, since the viewer can distinguish between fantasy and reality. Some also contend that both men and women are objectified in pornography, particularly sadistic or masochistic pornography in which men are objectified and sexually used by women.\nProstitution.\nProstitution is the business or practice of engaging in sexual relations for payment. Among sex workers women are generally overrepresented. Sex workers are often objectified and are seen as existing only to serve clients, thus calling their sense of agency into question. There is a prevailing notion that because they sell sex professionally, prostitutes automatically consent to all sexual contact. As a result, sex workers face higher rates of violence and sexual assault. This is often dismissed, ignored and not taken seriously by authorities.\nIn many countries, prostitution is dominated by brothels or pimps, who often claim ownership over sex workers. This sense of ownership furthers the concept that sex workers are void of agency. This is literally the case in instances of sexual slavery.\nVarious authors have argued that female prostitution is based on male sexism that condones the idea that unwanted sex with a woman is acceptable, that men's desires must be satisfied, and that women are coerced into and exist to serve men sexually. The European Women's Lobby condemned prostitution as \"an intolerable form of male violence\".\nCarole Pateman writes that:\nProstitution is the use of a woman's body by a man for his own satisfaction. There is no desire or satisfaction on the part of the prostitute. Prostitution is not mutual, pleasurable exchange of the use of bodies, but the unilateral use of a woman's body by a man in exchange for money.\nMedia portrayals.\nSome scholars believe that media portrayals of demographic groups can both maintain and disrupt attitudes and behaviors toward those groups. According to Susan Douglas: \"Since the early 1990s, much of the media have come to overrepresent women as having made it-completely-in the professions, as having gained sexual equality with men, and having achieved a level of financial success and comfort enjoyed primarily by Tiffany's-encrusted doyennes of Laguna Beach.\" These images may be harmful, particularly to women and racial and ethnic minority groups. For example, a study of African American women found they feel that media portrayals of themselves often reinforce stereotypes of this group as overly sexual and idealize images of lighter-skinned, thinner African American women (images African American women describe as objectifying). In a recent analysis of images of Haitian women in the Associated Press photo archive from 1994 to 2009, several themes emerged emphasizing the \"otherness\" of Haitian women and characterizing them as victims in need of rescue.\nIn an attempt to study the effect of media consumption on males, Samantha and Bridges found an effect on body shame, though not through self-objectification as it was found in comparable studies of women. The authors conclude that the current measures of objectification were designed for women and do not measure men accurately. Another study found a negative effect on eating attitudes and body satisfaction of consumption of beauty and fitness magazines for women and men respectively but again with different mechanisms, namely self-objectification for women and internalization for men.\nSexist jokes.\nFrederick Attenborough argues that sexist jokes can be a form of sexual objectification, which reduce the butt of the joke to an object. They not only objectify women, but can also condone violence or prejudice against women. \"Sexist humor\u2014the denigration of women through humor\u2014for instance, trivializes sex discrimination under the veil of benign amusement, thus precluding challenges or opposition that nonhumorous sexist communication would likely incur.\" A study of 73 male undergraduate students by Ford found that \"sexist humor can promote the behavioral expression of prejudice against women amongst sexist men\". According to the study, when sexism is presented in a humorous manner it is viewed as tolerable and socially acceptable: \"Disparagement of women through humor 'freed' sexist participants from having to conform to the more general and more restrictive norms regarding discrimination against women.\"\nGender identity discrimination.\nGender discrimination is discrimination based on actual or perceived gender identity. Gender identity is \"the gender-related identity, appearance, or mannerisms or other gender-related characteristics of an individual, with or without regard to the individual's designated sex at birth\". Gender discrimination is theoretically different from sexism. Whereas sexism is prejudice based on gender, gender discrimination specifically addresses discrimination towards gender identities, including third gender, genderqueer, and other non-binary identified people. It is especially attributed to how people are treated in the workplace, and banning discrimination on the basis of gender identity and expression has emerged as a subject of contention in the American legal system.\nAccording to a recent report by the Congressional Research Service, \"although the majority of federal courts to consider the issue have concluded that discrimination on the basis of gender identity is not sex discrimination, there have been several courts that have reached the opposite conclusion\". Hurst states that \"[c]ourts often confuse sex, gender and sexual orientation, and confuse them in a way that results in denying the rights not only of gays and lesbians, but also of those who do not present themselves or act in a manner traditionally expected of their sex\".\nOppositional sexism.\nOppositional sexism is a term coined by transfeminist author Julia Serano, who defined oppositional sexism as \"the belief that male and female are rigid, mutually exclusive categories\". Oppositional sexism plays a vital role in a number of social norms, such as cisnormativity and heteronormativity.\nOppositional sexism normalizes masculine expression in males and feminine expression in females while simultaneously demonizing femininity in males and masculinity in females. This concept plays a crucial role in supporting cissexism, the social norm that views cisgender people as both natural and privileged as opposed to transgender people.\nThe idea of having two, opposite genders is tied to sexuality through what gender theorist Judith Butler calls a \"compulsory practice of heterosexuality\". Because oppositional sexism is tied to heteronormativity in this way, non-heterosexuals are seen as breaking gender norms.\nThe concept of opposite genders sets a \"dangerous precedent\", according to Serano, where \"if men are big then women must be small; and if men are strong then women must be weak\". The gender binary and oppositional norms work together to support \"traditional sexism\", the belief that femininity is inferior to and serves masculinity.\nSerano states that oppositional sexism works in tandem with \"traditional sexism\". This ensures that \"those who are masculine have power over those who are feminine, and that only those that are born male will be seen as authentically masculine.\"\nTransgender discrimination.\nTransgender discrimination is discrimination towards peoples whose gender identity differs from the social expectations of the biological sex they were born with. Forms of discrimination include but are not limited to identity documents not reflecting one's gender, sex-segregated public restrooms and other facilities, dress codes according to binary gender codes, and lack of access to and existence of appropriate health care services. In a recent adjudication, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) concluded that discrimination against a transgender person is sex discrimination.\nThe 2008\u201309 National Transgender Discrimination Survey (NTDS)\u2014a U.S. study by the National Center for Transgender Equality and the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force in collaboration with the National Black Justice Coalition that was, at its time, the most extensive survey of transgender discrimination\u2014showed that Black transgender people in the United States suffer \"the combination of anti-transgender bias and persistent, structural and individual racism\" and that \"black transgender people live in extreme poverty that is more than twice the rate for transgender people of all races (15%), four times the general Black population rate (9%) and over eight times the general US population rate (4%)\". Further discrimination is faced by gender nonconforming individuals, whether transitioning or not, because of displacement from societally acceptable gender binaries and visible stigmatization. According to the NTDS, transgender gender nonconforming (TGNC) individuals face between eight percent and 15% higher rates of self and social discrimination and violence than binary transgender individuals. Lisa R. Miller and Eric Anthony Grollman found in their 2015 study that \"gender nonconformity may heighten trans people's exposure to discrimination and health-harming behaviors. Gender nonconforming trans adults reported more events of major and everyday transphobic discrimination than their gender conforming counterparts.\"\nIn another study conducted in collaboration with the League of United Latin American Citizens, Latino/a transgender people who were non-citizens were most vulnerable to harassment, abuse and violence.\nAn updated version of the NTDS survey, called the 2015 U.S. Transgender Survey, was published in December 2016.\nChild and forced marriage.\nA child marriage is a marriage where one or both spouses are under 18, a practice that disproportionately affects women. Child marriages are most common in South Asia, the Middle East and Sub-Saharan Africa, but occur in other parts of the world, too. The practice of marrying young girls is rooted in patriarchal ideologies of control of female behavior and is also sustained by traditional practices such as dowry and bride price. Child marriage is strongly connected with protecting female virginity. UNICEF states that:\nMarrying girls under 18 years old is rooted in gender discrimination, encouraging premature and continuous child bearing and giving preference to boys' education. Child marriage is also a strategy for economic survival as families marry off their daughters at an early age to reduce their economic burden.\nConsequences of child marriage include restricted education and employment prospects, increased risk of domestic violence, child sexual abuse, pregnancy and birth complications, and social isolation. Early and forced marriage are defined as forms of modern-day slavery by the International Labour Organization. In some cases, a woman or girl who has been raped may be forced to marry her rapist to restore the honor of her family; marriage by abduction, a practice in which a man abducts the woman or girl whom he wishes to marry and rapes her to force the marriage is common in Ethiopia.\nClothing.\nFeminists argue that clothing and footwear fashion have been oppressive to women, restricting their movements, increasing their vulnerability, and endangering their health. Using thin models in the fashion industry has encouraged the development of bulimia and anorexia nervosa, as well as locking female consumers into false feminine identities.\nThe assignment of gender-specific baby clothes can instill in children a belief in negative gender stereotypes. One example is the assignment in some countries of the color pink to girls and blue to boys. The fashion is recent one. At the beginning of the 20th century the trend was the opposite: blue for girls and pink for boys. In the early 1900s, \"The Women's Journal\" wrote that \"pink being a more decided and stronger colour, is more suitable for the boy, while blue, which is more delicate and dainty, is prettier for the girl\". \"DressMaker\" magazine also explained that \"[t]he preferred colour to dress young boys in is pink. Blue is reserved for girls as it is considered paler, and the more dainty of the two colours, and pink is thought to be stronger (akin to red)\". Today, in many countries, it is considered inappropriate for boys to wear dresses and skirts, but this is also a relatively recent view. From the mid-16th century until the late 19th or early 20th century, young boys in the Western world were unbreeched and wore gowns or dresses until an age that varied between two and eight.\nLaws that dictate how women must dress are seen by many international human rights organizations, such as Amnesty International, as gender discrimination. In many countries, women face violence for failing to adhere to certain dress codes, whether by the authorities (such as the religious police), family members, or the community. Amnesty International states:\nInterpretations of religion, culture, or tradition cannot justify imposing rules about dress on those who choose to dress differently. States should take measures to protect individuals from being coerced to dress in specific ways by family members, community or religious groups or leaders.\nThe production process also faces criticism for sexist practices. In the garment industry, approximately 80 percent of workers are female. Much garment production is located in Asia because of low labor costs. Women who work in these factories are sexually harassed by managers and male workers, paid low wages, and discriminated against when pregnant.\nConscription.\nConscription of only men in some countries has been criticized as discrimination against men. During the Modern era, prior to the late 20th century, mostly men were subjected to conscription,\nalthough there were several instances of conscription of women in Antiquity and the Middle Ages. Today most countries still require only men to serve in the military.\nIn his book \"The Second Sexism: Discrimination Against Men and Boys\" (2012), philosopher David Benatar states that \"[t]he prevailing assumption is that where conscription is necessary, it is only men who should be conscripted and, similarly, that only males should be forced into combat\". This, he believes, \"is a sexist assumption\". Anthropologist Ayse G\u00fcl Altinay has commented that \"given equal suffrage rights, there is no other citizenship practice that differentiates as radically between men and women as compulsory male conscription\".\nOnly nine countries conscript women into their armed forces: China, Eritrea, Israel, Libya, Malaysia, North Korea, Norway, Peru, and Taiwan. Other countries\u2014such as Finland, Turkey, and Singapore\u2014still use a system of conscription which requires military service from men only, although women may serve voluntarily. In 2014, Norway became the first NATO country to introduce obligatory military service for women as an act of gender equality and in 2015, the Dutch government started preparing a gender-neutral draft law. The gender selective draft has been challenged in the United States.\nConditions in the military have been described as \"sexually abusive\" and the \"sexual persecution\" of women. Relentless sexist ridicule, hostility, and sexual harassment has been frequently reported. Women in the military are more likely to be raped by a male fellow soldier than killed by the enemy. Prosecution of the reported crimes fails to move forward, as the Pentagon claimed it would undermine the leadership of the commanders.\nEducation.\nWomen have traditionally had limited access to higher education. In the past, when women were admitted to higher education, they were encouraged to major in less-scientific subjects; the study of English literature in American and British colleges and universities was instituted as a field considered suitable to women's \"lesser intellects\".\nEducational specialties in higher education produce and perpetuate inequality between men and women. Disparity persists particularly in computer and information science, where in the US women received only 21% of the undergraduate degrees, and in engineering, where women obtained only 19% of the degrees in 2008. Only one out of five of physics doctorates in the US are awarded to women, and only about half those women are American. Of all the physics professors in the country, only 14% are women. As of 2019, women account for just 27% of all workers in STEM fields, and on average earn almost 20% less than men in the same industries.\nWorld literacy is lower for females than for males. Data from \"The World Factbook\" shows that 79.7% of women are literate, compared to 88.6% of men (aged 15 and over). In some parts of the world, girls continue to be excluded from proper public or private education. In parts of Afghanistan, girls who go to school face serious violence from some local community members and religious groups. According to 2010 UN estimates, only Afghanistan, Pakistan and Yemen had less than 90 girls per 100 boys at school. Jayachandran and Lleras-Muney's study of Sri Lankan economic development has suggested that increases in the life expectancy for women encourages educational investment because a longer time horizon increases the value of investments that pay out over time.\nEducational opportunities and outcomes for women have greatly improved in the West. Since 1991, the proportion of women enrolled in college in the United States has exceeded the enrollment rate for men, and the gap has widened over time. As of 2007[ [update]], women made up the majority\u201454%\u2014of the 10.8\u00a0million college students enrolled in the United States. However, research by Diane Halpern has indicated that boys receive more attention, praise, blame and punishment in the grammar-school classroom, and \"this pattern of more active teacher attention directed at male students continues at the postsecondary level\". Over time, female students speak less in a classroom setting. Teachers also tend to spend more time supporting the academic achievements of girls.\nBoys are frequently diagnosed with ADHD, which some see as a result of school systems being more likely to apply these labels to males. A recent study by the OECD in over 60 countries found that teachers give boys lower grades for the same work. The researchers attribute this to stereotypical ideas about boys and recommend teachers to be aware of this gender bias. One study found that students give female professors worse evaluation scores than male professors, even though the students appear to do as well under female professors as male professors.\nGender bias and gender-based discrimination still permeate the education process in many settings. For example, in the teaching and learning process, including differential engagement, expectations and interactions by teachers with their male and female students, as well as gender stereotypes in textbooks and learning materials. There has been a lack in adequate resources and infrastructure to ensure safe and enabling learning environments, and insufficient policy, legal and planning frameworks, that respect, protect and fulfil the right to education.\nA discrimination against men in grading was found by the OECD in 2015.\nFemale genital mutilation.\nFemale genital mutilation is defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) as \"all procedures that involve partial or total removal of the external female genitalia, or other injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons\". The WHO further states, \"The practice has no health benefits for girls and women and [can] cause severe bleeding and problems urinating, and later cysts, infections, as well as complications in childbirth and increased risk of newborn deaths.\" It \"is recognized internationally as a violation of the human rights of girls and women\" and \"constitutes an extreme form of discrimination against women\". The European Parliament stated in a 2014 resolution that the practice \"clearly goes against the European founding value of equality between women and men and maintains traditional values according to which women are seen as the objects and properties of men\".\nLegal.\nIn several Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) countries the legal testimony of a woman is worth legally half of that of a man (see Status of women's testimony in Islam). Such countries include: Algeria (in criminal cases), Bahrain (in Sharia courts), Egypt (in family courts), Iran (in most cases), Iraq (in some cases), Jordan (in Sharia courts), Kuwait (in family courts), Libya (in some cases), Morocco (in family cases), Palestine (in cases related to marriage, divorce and child custody), Qatar (in family law matters), Syria (in Sharia courts), United Arab Emirates (in some civil matters), Yemen (not allowed to testify at all in cases of adultery and retribution), and Saudi Arabia. Such laws have been criticized by Human Rights Watch and Equality Now as being discriminatory towards women.\nSome countries use stoning as a form of capital punishment. According to Amnesty International, the majority of those stoned are women and women are disproportionately affected by stoning because of sexism in the legal system.\nThe criminal justice system in many common law countries has also been accused of discriminating against women. Provocation is, in many common law countries, a partial defense to murder, which converts what would have been murder into manslaughter. It is meant to be applied when a person kills in the \"heat of passion\" upon being \"provoked\" by the behavior of the victim. This defense has been criticized as being gendered, favoring men, because of it being used disproportionately in cases of adultery, and other domestic disputes when women are killed by their partners. As a result of the defense exhibiting a strong gender bias, and being a form of legitimization of male violence against women and minimization of the harm caused by violence against women, it has been abolished or restricted in several jurisdictions.\nThe traditional leniency towards crimes of passion in Latin American countries has been deemed to have its origin in the view that women are property. In 2002, Widney Brown, advocacy director for Human Rights Watch, stated that, \"[S]o-called crimes of passion have a similar dynamic [to honor killings] in that the women are killed by male family members and the crimes are perceived as excusable or understandable.\" The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) has called for \"the elimination of discriminatory provisions in the legislation, including mitigating factors for 'crimes of passion'.\"\nTransgender people face widespread discrimination while incarcerated. They are generally housed according to their legal birth sex, rather than their gender identity. Studies have shown that transgender people are at an increased risk for harassment and sexual assault in this environment. They may also be denied access to medical procedures related to their reassignment.\nSentencing disparity.\nIn the United States, some studies have shown that for identical crimes, men are given harsher sentences than women. Controlling for arrest offense, criminal history, and other pre-charge variables, sentences are over 60% heavier for men. Women are more likely to avoid charges entirely, and to avoid imprisonment if convicted. The gender disparity varies according to the nature of the case. For example, the gender gap is less pronounced in fraud cases than in drug trafficking and firearms. This disparity occurs in US federal courts, despite guidelines designed to avoid differential sentencing. The death penalty may also suffer from gender bias. According to Shatz and Shatz, \"[t]he present study confirms what earlier studies have shown: that the death penalty is imposed on women relatively infrequently and that it is disproportionately imposed for the killing of women\".\nThere have been several reasons postulated for the gender criminal justice disparity in the United States. One of the most common is the expectation that women are predominantly care-givers. Other possible reasons include the \"girlfriend theory\" (whereby women are seen as tools of their boyfriends), the theory that female defendants are more likely to cooperate with authorities, and that women are often successful at turning their violent crime into victimhood by citing defenses such as postpartum depression or battered wife syndrome. However, none of these theories account for the total disparity, and sexism has also been suggested as an underlying cause.\nGender discrimination also helps explain the differences between trial outcomes in which some female defendants are sentenced to death and other female defendants are sentenced to lesser punishments. Phillip Barron argues that female defendants are more likely to be sentenced to death for crimes that violate gender norms, such as killing children or killing strangers.\nOne study found that: [O]n average, women receive lighter sentences in comparison with men... roughly 30% of the gender differences in incarceration cannot be explained by the observed criminal characteristics of offense and offender. We also find evidence of considerable heterogeneity across judges in their treatment of female and male offenders. There is little evidence, however, that tastes for gender discrimination are driving the mean gender disparity or the variance in treatment between judges.\nA 2017 study by Knepper found that \"female plaintiffs filing workplace sex discrimination claims are substantially more likely to settle and win compensation whenever a female judge is assigned to the case. Additionally, female judges are 15 percentage points less likely than male judges to grant motions filed by defendants, which suggests that final negotiations are shaped by the emergence of the bias.\"\nReproduction.\nThe United Nations Population Fund writes that, \"Family planning is central to gender equality and women's empowerment\". Women in many countries around the world are denied medical and informational services related to reproductive health, including access to pregnancy care, family planning, and contraception. In countries with very strict abortion laws (particularly in Latin America) women who suffer miscarriages are often investigated by the police under suspicion of having deliberately provoked the miscarriage and are sometimes jailed, a practice which Amnesty International called a \"ruthless campaign against women's rights\". Doctors may be reluctant to treat pregnant women who are very ill, because they are afraid the treatment may result in fetal loss. According to Amnesty International, \"Discriminatory attitudes towards women and girls also means access to sex education and contraceptives are near impossible [in El Salvador]\". The organization has also criticized laws and policies which require the husband's consent for a woman to use reproductive health services as being discriminatory and dangerous to women's health and life: \"[F]or the woman who needs her husband's consent to get contraception, the consequences of discrimination can be serious\u2014even fatal\".\nGendercide and forced sterilization.\nFemale infanticide is the killing of newborn female children, while female selective abortion is the terminating of a pregnancy based upon the female sex of the fetus. Gendercide is the systematic killing of members of a specific gender and it is an extreme form of gender-based violence. Female infanticide is more common than male infanticide, and is especially prevalent in South Asia, in countries such as China, India and Pakistan. Recent studies suggest that over 90\u00a0million women and girls are missing in China and India as a result of infanticide.\nSex-selective abortion involves terminating a pregnancy based upon the predicted sex of the baby. The abortion of female fetuses is most common in areas where a culture values male children over females, such as parts of East Asia and South Asia (China, India, Korea), the Caucasus (Azerbaijan, Armenia and Georgia), and Western Balkans (Albania, Macedonia, Montenegro, Kosovo). One reason for this preference is that males are seen as generating more income than females. The trend has grown steadily over the previous decade, and may result in a future shortage of women.\nForced sterilization and forced abortion are also forms of gender-based violence. Forced sterilization was practiced during the first half of the 20th century by many Western countries and there are reports of this practice being currently employed in some countries, such as Uzbekistan and China.\nIn China, the one child policy interacting with the low status of women has been deemed responsible for many abuses, such as female infanticide, sex-selective abortion, abandonment of baby girls, forced abortion, and forced sterilization.\nIn India, the custom of dowry is strongly related to female infanticide, sex-selective abortion, abandonment and mistreatment of girls. Such practices are especially present in the northwestern part of the country: Jammu and Kashmir, Haryana, Punjab, Uttarakhand and Delhi. (See Female foeticide in India and Female infanticide in India).\nSexual violence.\nResearch by Lisak and Roth into factors motivating perpetrators of sexual assault, including rape, against women revealed a pattern of hatred towards women and pleasure in inflicting psychological and physical trauma, rather than sexual interest. Mary Odem and Peggy Reeves Sanday posit that rape is the result not of pathology but of systems of male dominance, cultural practices and beliefs.\nOdem, Jody Clay-Warner, and Susan Brownmiller argue that sexist attitudes are propagated by a series of myths about rape and rapists. They state that in contrast to those myths, rapists often plan a rape before they choose a victim and acquaintance rape (not assault by a stranger) is the most common form of rape. Odem also asserts that these rape myths propagate sexist attitudes about men, by perpetuating the belief that men cannot control their sexuality.\nSexism can promote the stigmatization of women and girls who have been raped and inhibit recovery. In many parts of the world, women who have been raped are ostracized, rejected by their families, subjected to violence, and\u2014in extreme cases\u2014may become victims of honor killings because they are deemed to have brought shame upon their families.\nThe criminalization of marital rape is very recent, having occurred during the past few decades; in many countries it is still legal. Several countries in Eastern Europe and Scandinavia made spousal rape illegal before 1970; other European countries and some English-speaking countries outside Europe outlawed it later, mostly in the 1980s and 1990s; some countries outlawed it in the 2000s. The WHO wrote that: \"Marriage is often used to legitimize a range of forms of sexual violence against women. The custom of marrying off young children, particularly girls, is found in many parts of the world. This practice\u2014legal in many countries\u2014is a form of sexual violence, since the children involved are unable to give or withhold their consent\".\nIn countries where fornication or adultery are illegal, victims of rape can be charged criminally.\nWar rape.\nSexism is manifested by the crime of rape targeting women civilians and soldiers, committed by soldiers, combatants or civilians during armed conflict, war or military occupation. This arises from the long tradition of women being seen as sexual booty and from the misogynistic culture of military training.\nViolence.\nDomestic violence.\nAlthough the exact rates are widely disputed, there is a large body of cross-cultural evidence that domestic violence is mostly committed by men against women. In addition, there is a broad consensus that women are more often subjected to severe forms of abuse and are more likely to be injured by an abusive partner. The United Nations recognizes domestic violence as a form of gender-based violence, which it describes as a human rights violation, and the result of sexism.\nDomestic violence is tolerated and even legally accepted in many parts of the world. For instance, in 2010, the United Arab Emirates (UAE)'s Supreme Court ruled that a man has the right to discipline his wife and children physically if he does not leave visible marks. In 2015, Equality Now drew attention to a section of the Penal Code of Northern Nigeria, titled \"Correction of Child, Pupil, Servant or Wife\" which reads: \"(1) Nothing is an offence which does not amount to the infliction of grievous hurt upon any persons which is done:\u00a0(...) (d) by a husband for the purpose of correcting his wife, such husband and wife being subject to any native law or custom in which such correction is recognized as lawful.\"\nHonor killings are another form of domestic violence practiced in several parts of the world, and their victims are predominantly women. Honor killings can occur because of refusal to enter into an arranged marriage, maintaining a relationship relatives disapprove of, extramarital sex, becoming the victim of rape, dress seen as inappropriate, or homosexuality. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime states that, \"[h]onour crimes, including killing, are one of history's oldest forms of gender-based violence\".\nAccording to a report of the Special Rapporteur submitted to the 58th session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights concerning cultural practices in the family that reflect violence against women:\nThe Special Rapporteur indicated that there had been contradictory decisions with regard to the honor defense in Brazil, and that legislative provisions allowing for partial or complete defense in that context could be found in the penal codes of Argentina, Ecuador, Egypt, Guatemala, Iran, Israel, Jordan, Peru, Syria, Venezuela, and the Palestinian National Authority.\nPractices such as honor killings and stoning continue to be supported by mainstream politicians and other officials in some countries. In Pakistan, after the 2008 Balochistan honor killings in which five women were killed by tribesmen of the Umrani Tribe of Balochistan, Pakistani federal minister for Postal Services Israr Ullah Zehri defended the practice: \"These are centuries-old traditions, and I will continue to defend them. Only those who indulge in immoral acts should be afraid.\" Following the 2006 case of Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani (which has placed Iran under international pressure for its stoning sentences), Mohammad-Javad Larijani, a senior envoy and chief of Iran's Human Rights Council, defended the practice of stoning; he claimed it was a \"lesser punishment\" than execution, because it allowed those convicted a chance at survival.\nDowry deaths result from the killing of women who are unable to pay the high dowry price for their marriage. According to Amnesty International, \"the ongoing reality of dowry-related violence is an example of what can happen when women are treated as property\".\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

SS) was a conservative Marathi regionalist Hindutva-based political party in India founded in 1966 by Bal Thackeray, who was later succeeded by Uddhav Thackeray. The party has split into two parties: the Uddhav Thackeray-led Shiv Sena (Uddhav Balasaheb Thackeray) which has a new symbol of \"Mashaal\" (Torch) and Eknath Shinde-led Shiv Sena (2022\u2013present) which has the original party name and the \"bow and arrow\" symbol.\nInitially apolitical, the organisation was patronised by the then Chief Minister Vasantrao Naik who used it for curbing trade unions and maintain stranglehold of the Congress. The organisation at the same time carried out pro-Marathi nativist movement in Mumbai in which it agitated for preferential treatment for the Marathi people over migrants from other parts of India.\nAlthough Shiv Sena's primary base always remained in Maharashtra, it tried to expand to a pan-Indian base. In the 1970s, it gradually moved from advocating a pro-Marathi ideology to supporting a broader Hindu nationalist agenda, and aligned itself with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Shiv Sena took part in Mumbai (BMC) municipal elections for its entire existence. In 1989, it entered into an alliance with the BJP for Lok Sabha as well as Maharashtra Legislative Assembly elections. The alliance in the latter was temporarily broken in the 2014 elections due to seat sharing adjustment, although it was quickly reformed. Shiv Sena was one of the founding members of the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in 1998, and it also participated in Vajpayee Government from 1998 to 2004 and the Narendra Modi Government from 2014 to 2019.\nAfter 2019 Maharashtra Legislative Assembly election, the party left the alliance after disagreements with BJP over the CM post. Under Uddhav Thackeray, Shiv Sena formed an alliance with its historic rivals, the Indian National Congress and Nationalist Congress Party Following the 2022 Maharashtra political crisis, the party split.\nThe party once had a powerful hold over the Hindi film industry. It has been accused of being an \"extremist\", \"chauvinist\"\",\" or \"fascist\" party. Shiv Sena has been allegedly involved in the 1970 communal violence in Bhiwandi, the 1984 Bhiwandi riot, and violence in the 1992\u20131993 Bombay riots.\nHistory.\nOrigins.\nAfter the Independence of India in 1947, regional administrative divisions from the colonial era were gradually changed and states following linguistic borders were created. Within the Bombay Presidency, a massive popular struggle was launched for the creation of a state for the Marathi-speaking people. In 1960, the presidency was divided into two linguistic states: Gujarat and Maharashtra. Moreover, Marathi-speaking areas of the erstwhile Hyderabad state were joined with Maharashtra. Bombay, in many ways the economic capital of India, became the state capital of Maharashtra. On one hand, people belonging to the Gujarati community owned the majority of the industry and trade enterprises in the city.&lt;ref name=\"Public sector, Threats against other communities, businesses owned especially by Gujarati and Marwaris/\"&gt;\n&lt;/ref&gt; There was a steady flow of South Indian migrants to the city leading to fears that they would take many white-collar jobs.\nIn 1960, Bal Thackeray, a Mumbai-based cartoonist, began publishing the satirical cartoon weekly \"Marmik\". Through this publication, he started disseminating anti-migrant sentiments. On 19 June 1966, Thackeray founded the Shiv Sena as a political organisation.\nThe Shiv Sena attracted many unemployed Marathi youth, who were attracted by Thackeray's charged anti-migrant oratory. Shiv Sena cadres became involved in various attacks against the South Indian communities, vandalizing South Indian restaurants and pressuring employers to hire Marathis.&lt;ref name=\"Rediff article: sons of the soil, lungi slogan, shakhas, south Indians in 1970, shift to Hindutva, defeat of communists/\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nInitially apolitical, the organisation was patronised by the then Chief Minister Vasantrao Naik who used it for curbing trade unions and maintain stranglehold of the Congress. Because of its close association with Vasantrao, the organisation was also referred to as \"Vasant Sena\".\nThe Shiv Sena declared support to the Emergency in 1975 and supported the Congress in the 1977 general election. In 1980 Maharashtra Assembly election, the party did not contest from any seat however it campaigned for the Congress.\nAlliance with the Bharatiya Janata Party.\nThe Sena started placing more weight on the Hindutva ideology in the 1970s as the 'sons of the soil' cause was weakening.\nIn the 1984 general election, Shiv Sena formed its first alliance with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Shiv Sena candidates fought on BJP's lotus symbol.\nThe party began a coalition with the BJP for seats in the Lok Sabha and the Maharashtra Assembly from 1989. The two formed a government in Maharashtra between 1995 and 1999. The Sena was the opposition party in the state along with the BJP from 1999 to 2014. However, the 25 year alliance with the BJP was threatened in 2014 Maharashtra Assembly elections over seat sharing and both contested the election independently. With the BJP becoming the largest party following the 2014 election, Sena declared opposition. However, after negotiations, Sena agreed to join the government in Maharashtra. The Shiv Sena-BJP combine governs the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation. Traditionally the main strongholds of Shiv Sena have been Mumbai and the Konkan coastal areas. However, in the 2004 Lok Sabha elections the result was reversed. The Shiv Sena made inroads in the interior parts of the state, while suffering losses in Mumbai.\nFormation of Maharashtra Navanirman Sena.\nIn July 2005, Former Maharashtra Chief Minister and Sena leader Narayan Rane was expelled from the party, which sparked internal conflict in the party. In December the same year Raj Thackeray, Bal Thackeray's nephew, left the party. Raj Thackeray later founded a separate party, Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS). \nAlthough the MNS is a break-away group from the Shiv Sena, the party is still based in Bhumiputra ideology. When unveiling the party in an assembly at Shivaji Park he said, everyone is anxious to see what will happen to Hindutva and, \"I shall elaborate on the party's stance on issues like Hindutva, its agenda for development of Maharashtra and the significance of the party flag colours at the 19 March public meeting.\"\nLeadership change.\nBal Thackeray's son Uddhav Thackeray became the party's leader in 2004, although Bal Thackeray continued to be an important figurehead. After the death of Bal Thackeray on 17 November 2012, Uddhav became the leader of the party but refused to take the title \"Shiv Sena Pramukh\" (Eng : Shiv Sena Supremo).\nIdeology shifts.\nThe Shiv Sena party's ideology has undergone changes since its formation. Initially, it started with the ideology of Marathi regionalism under the leadership of Bal Thackeray. However, the party shifted towards ultranationalism and right-wing populism over time, which helped them form an alliance with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). When Uddhav Thackeray became the party leader, he gradually shifted towards composite nationalism and formed an alliance with the Congress and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP). This shift in ideology was a significant departure from Shiv Sena's traditional stance, as the party had been historically opposed to the Congress and NCP for the majority of its existence.\n2022 political crisis and split in the party.\nIn late June 2022, Eknath Shinde, a senior Shiv Sena leader, and the majority of MLAs from Shiv Sena joined hands with the BJP. Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari called for a trust vote, an action that would later on be described as a \"sad spectacle\" by Supreme Court of India, and draw criticism from Political Observers. Uddhav Thackeray resigned from the post as chief minister well as a MLC member ahead of no-confidence motion on 29 June 2022. Shinde subsequently formed a new coalition with the BJP, and was sworn in as the Chief Minister on 30 June 2022. Uddhav Thackeray filed a lawsuit with the Supreme Court of India claiming that Eknath Shinde and his group's actions meant that they were disqualified under the anti-defection law, with Eknath Shinde claiming that he has not defected, but rather represents the true Shiv Sena party. The case is currently being heard by Supreme Court of India. The parties split into two factions: Balasahebanchi Shiv Sena led by Shinde and Shiv Sena (Uddhav Balasaheb Thackeray) led by Thackeray.\nShinde subsequently filed a petition with the Election Commission of India staking his claim to the 'Shiv Sena' name and the Bow and Arrow symbol. The ECI ruled in favour of Shinde's faction based on the strength of its legislative wing, rather than on the organizational wing. Thackeray appealed against the decision, and the case is currently pending in the Supreme Court.\nParty structure and caste composition.\nStructure.\nThe Shiv Sena (SS) was led by a president, traditionally referred to as the \"Shiv Sena Pramukh\", (transl.\u2009Chief) which translates to \"Shiv Sena Chief\" in English. Bal Thackeray served as the first Shiv Sena \"Pramukh\" and took all major decisions while the activists and members of the Shiv Sena, known as Shiv \"Sainiks\", (transl.\u2009Soldiers) carried out most of the party's grassroots work. During his last days, the day-to-day activities of the party were handled by his youngest son Uddhav Thackeray, who succeeded him as party leader after his death in 2012.\nShiv Sena formed a network of grassroots organizations, known as \"Shiv Sena Shakhas\" (transl.\u2009Branch). The \"Shakhas\" serve as the primary unit of the party, with each \"Shakha\" consisting of 25-50 members. The \"Shakhas\" were responsible for carrying out the party's activities at the grassroots level, such as mobilizing voters during elections, organizing protests and rallies, and engaging in community service activities.\nIn addition to the \"Shakhas\", the party has various other organizational structures, including the \"Yuva Sena\", (transl.\u2009Youth Army) party's youth wing, and the \"Mahila Aghadi\", the party's women's wing. The Shiv Sena is also affiliated with the Sthaniya Lokadhikar Samiti, which advocates for the preservation of employment rights for Maharashtrians in Maharashtra.\nPrior to the rebellion by its prominent leader Eknath Shinde in 2022, the party was in hand of Thackeray family, thus most of the important positions was hold by Bal Thackeray's son and grandson that is Uddhav and Aditya Thackeray respectively. Opposition parties frequently alleged Shiva Sena as a dynastic political party. Bal Thackeray never remained on any elected political position but he never vacated the position of Shiva Sena supremo and ruled as a Godfather or king maker.\nFor the first time ever, Thackeray family directly participated in election when Aditya contested for a seat of MLA in 2019. Later, his father debuted in direct politics and became chief minister of the state. Aditya was the tourism minister his father's cabinet.\nCaste composition.\nPeople of various Maharashtrian castes worked together in the Sena. The party's leaders mostly came from the \"high castes\" that is Brahmins, Chandraseniya Kayastha Prabhu and Pathare Prabhus - Thackerey, Manohar Joshi, Sudhir Joshi, Balwant Mantri, Hemchandra Gupte, Shyam Deshmukh, Madhav Deshpande, Datta Pradhan, Vijay Parvatkar, Madhukar Sarpotdar and Pramod Navalkar.\nOne of the above-mentioned leaders, Hemchandra Gupte, who was Mayor of Bombay in the early 70s and was the former family physician and confidant of Thackeray, quit Shivsena citing flaws such as importance given to money, violence committed by the \"Shivsainiks\" (transl.\u2009Soldiers) and Bal Thackeray's support to then prime minister Indira Gandhi during the 1975 emergency.\nThere were also leaders from other castes such as Dattaji Salvi, Dattaji Nalawade and Wamanrao Mahadik, and those from the lower castes such as Chaggan Bhujbal, Leeladhar Dake, Bhai Shingre and Vijay Gaonkar.\nOver the years, other than the Bal Thackeray, there have been twelve senior leaders in the party, out of these, eight have been from\nupper caste (four were Brahmins, two Chandraseniya Kayastha Prabhu and two Pathare Prabhus). Others have been either Maratha (Dattaji Salvi), Shimpi (Wamanrao Mahadik), Agri (Leeladhar Dake) or Mali (Chaggan Bhujbal). In fact, Bhujbal quit the party accusing the party is biased towards upper caste people.\nThe number of Dalits were also not insignificant and even after the Sena opposed the reservations proposed by the Mandal commission, there was no dent in the percentage of Other Backward Class in the party. In this way, the Sena was successful in uniting all Maharashtrians irrespective of caste under the common \"Marathi umbrella\". The agenda of preferential treatment for the \"sons of the soil\" that is Maharashtrians brought them all together.\nVoter base.\nShiv Sena's strength in the late 1980s and early '90s mainly came from the support of the Maratha caste - which it drew away from the Congress. Citing the large percentage of MLAs elected from Shiv Sena belonging to the Maratha caste, Vora from the University of Pune concludes that the Shiv Sena has been emerging as a \"Maratha Party\".\nHeadquarters.\nShivsena \"Bhavan\" (transl.\u2009House), was the central office of the Shiv Sena, located in \"Ram Ganesh Gadkari Chowk\" and Shivaji Park in Dadar, Mumbai. It was first inaugurated on 19 June 1977, and refurbished and re-inaugurated on 27 July 2006. It has a Copper Statue of Shivaji Maharaj and a large Poster of Bal Thackeray. In the 1993 Bombay bombings, terrorists planted a powerful bomb in Shivsena \"Bhavan;\" it exploded and the building received damage.\n\"Matoshri\", the house of Bal Thackeray and Uddhav Thackeray was an important building in this party. Many high-profile meetings usually held in it. It worked as a command and control centre of the party in Bal\u2013Uddhava's regime.\nList of chief ministers.\nFollowing is the list of the chief ministers of Maharashtra from Shiv Sena.\nActivities.\nThe Sena says it has played a central role in the emancipation of 500,000 slum dwellers in the Dharavi area of Mumbai, the largest slum in Asia. However, the policy of giving free houses to slum dwellers has been controversial since it was introduced by the then Shiv Sena-BJP government.\nIn the 1970s, Shiv Sena was opposed to the Namantar Andolan, a Dalit-led movement to change the name of Marathwada University in Aurangabad to \"Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar University\", and supported views of conservative Marathas.\nIn 1996, Shiv Sena organised the first and only live concert of American pop icon Michael Jackson in India to raise the funds for its business wing and to help create over two-hundred seventy thousand jobs for people of Maharashtra.\nShiv Sena got an entry in Guinness Book of World Records in 2010 for \"collecting maximum blood in a day\". Shiv Sena organized a blood donation camp which collected over 24,000 bottles of blood in a single day. Later this world record was broken by a blood donation camp of HDFC Bank in 2014.\nIn 2015 Shiv Sena announced 10,000 rupees help to each drought-affected farmer of Marathwada region, while they also announced 2 lakh rupees \"reward\" to Hindus family who had 5 children between 2010 and 2015 in Uttar Pradesh. As per Shiv Sena, the reason behind the \"reward\" was \"decline in growth rate of Hindu population compared to Muslim population as per recent census\".\nIn January 2016, the Shiv Sena demanded that the words \"secular\" and \"socialist\" be \"permanently removed\" from the Constitution's Preamble which were added in the 42nd amendment during the emergency. In April 2019, party member Sanjay Raut called for the burqa to be banned.\nControversies and criticism.\nThe Shiv Sena has been involved in several controversies, ranging from hooliganism, criminal activities, spreading religious bigotry, and moral policing.\nIn December 2003, Shiv Sena activists damaged the cricket pitch of the Agra Sport Stadium which was supposed to host the cricket match between Pakistan and India. In April 2005, Bharatiya Vidyarthi Sena, the student wing of Shiv Sena, attempted to prevent the India-Pakistan One-day international match being held in New Delhi. The protester's spokesman demanded:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe Sena acted as a \"moral police\" and opposed Valentine's Day celebrations. On 14 February 2006, Bal Thackeray condemned and apologised for the violent attacks by its Shiv Sainiks on a private celebration in Mumbai. \"It is said that women were beaten up in the Nallasopara incident. If that really happened, then it is a symbol of cowardice. I have always instructed Shiv Sainiks that in any situation women should not be humiliated and harassed.\" Thackeray and the Shiv Sena remained opposed to it, although they indicated support for an \"Indian alternative\".\nOn 20 November 2009, Shiv Sena activists attacked and vandalised the offices of Hindi and Marathi language TV news channels IBN7 and IBN-Lokmat, located in Mumbai and Pune respectively. The Shivsainik slapped IBN7's senior editor Ravindra Ambekar and then attacked IBN-Lokmat's editor Nikhil Wagle. Shiv Sena attributed the attacks to the criticisms of Bal Thackeray by the news channel over his remarks on Sachin Tendulkar. Shiv Sena's Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Raut described the attacks as \"spontaneous\". Shiv Sena spokespersons tried to justify the attacks and refused to apologize for their acts of violence.\nDuring the 2011 Cricket World Cup, Shiv Sena leaders threatened to disrupt the final in Mumbai if the Pakistani team qualified. The Sena has opposed any sporting events between India and Pakistan following the November 2008 terror attacks in Mumbai, which was perpetrated by Pakistan based terrorist group Lashkar-e-Taiba, besides opposing inclusion of Pakistani players in the Indian Premier League. \nOn 18 November 2012, following the death of founder Bal Thackeray, Mumbai Police, under the pressure of Shiv Sena workers and activists, arrested a 21-year-old woman who posted a Facebook comment against him, as well as her friend who \"liked\" the comment. Shiv Sena members, who took it as an insult, vandalised the clinic owned by the woman's relative. The charges were subsequently dropped in January 2013, and in July 2014, the Government of Maharashtra was ordered to pay compensation of Rs 50,000 to each victim after the National Human Rights Commission noted that the detention was illegal and violated rights to freedom of speech and expression.\nOn 2 November 2014, during the Kiss of Love protest against moral policing, members of Shiv Sena, Bajrang Dal, Vishwa Hindu Parishad and many other right wing groups opposed and attacked protestors and threatened to strip protestors for kissing on the streets. These opposing groups claimed that public display of affection is against both Indian culture and the law of the land (under section 294 of the Indian Penal Code), though according to the Supreme Court and the Delhi High Court, kissing in public is not a criminal offence. Police took many of the Kiss of Love protestors into custody to save their lives, but were blamed for giving a free hand to counter protestors of the right wing groups.\nIn October 2015, Shiv Sena issued threats which enforced a ban on a scheduled concert by Pakistani classic singer Ghulam Ali. The move was adopted to appease anti-Pakistan constituents to vote for Sena in coming elections. However, in 2015 Pakistan urged the international community to take note of the activities of Shiv Sena, while Shiv Sena claimed that criticism of Shiv Sena by Pakistan vindicates \"our patriotism\".\nOn 19 October 2015, Shiv Sena activists attacked and vandalised the office of BCCI to stop a meeting between PCB and BCCI officials. The activists shouted anti-Pakistan slogans and held posters that read 'Shahryar Khan go back', determined to stop Manohar from meeting his Pakistani counterpart. Shiv Sena has also threatened to stop Pakistan's Aleem Dar from officiating in the fifth and final ODI between India and South Africa.\nOn 23 March 2017, while travelling to Delhi from Pune, Shiv Sena leader Ravindra Gaikwad was accused of thrashing Air India staff with his shoe, when they tried to make him disembark the plane, after being denied a business class seat because the flight was all-economy. The Delhi Police had charged him with hitting government staff on duty, as well as taking the plane ransom without departing from the plane. The incident led to the creation of No-Fly List in India, and Gaikwad was the first person to be put on the list.\nOn 19 July 2017, Malishka Mendonsa, a popular radio jockey of Red FM, released a parody video on YouTube targeting the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation for incompetence in dealing potholed roads. In response to the video, the BMC and Shiv Sena slammed her and sent a notice imposing a penalty of Rs 10,000 for defamation. As a result of the notice, several political parties criticized the BMC and Shiv Sena for intolerance towards criticism, as 2 Shiv Sena corporators sent a legal notice with a suit of Rs. 500 cr (Rs. 5 billion) against the RJ and Red FM. Malishka made another parody video against the BMC and released it on 17 July 2018, describing the incapability and pathetic conditions of Mumbai's infrastructure in the monsoons.\nDuring the 2018 Maharashtra Council election and the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, many candidates fielded by Shiv Sena had criminal records or had criminal charges pending against them.\nFollowing actress Kangana Ranaut's criticism of Uddhav Thackeray and his Government for mishandling the death of Sushant Singh Rajput in September 2020, Shiv Sena leaders, including Sanjay Raut issued threats to her. On the orders of Shiv Sena leaders, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation demolished a portion of her house. Following the demolition, the Bombay High Court criticized the BMC and ruled in her favour, noting that BMC acted with malice and ordered BMC to pay compensation to Ranaut. Due to the nature of threats, Ranaut was given security from the Central Reserve Police Force from the Central Government.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The 49ers compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member of the National Football Conference (NFC) West division. The team plays its home games at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California, located southeast of San Francisco. The team is named after the prospectors of the California gold rush.\nThe team was founded in 1946 as a charter member of the All-America Football Conference (AAFC) and joined the NFL in 1949 when the leagues merged. The 49ers were the first major professional sports team based in San Francisco. They are the 10th-oldest franchise in the NFL, and have been owned and operated by Italian Americans (Morabito and DeBartolo families) since their inception. The team played at Kezar Stadium in San Francisco before moving to Candlestick Park in 1971 and then to Levi's Stadium in 2014. Since 1988, the 49ers have been headquartered in Santa Clara.\nThe 49ers won five Super Bowl championships between 1981 and 1994. Four of those came in the 1980s, and were led by Hall of Famers Joe Montana, Jerry Rice, Ronnie Lott, Steve Young, Charles Haley, Fred Dean, and coaches Bill Walsh and George Seifert. They were division champions 22 times between 1970 and 2023, making them one of the most successful teams in NFL history. The 49ers sit alone in NFL history for most playoff wins (38), having been in the league playoffs 30 times (29 times in the NFL and one time in the AAFC), and have also played in the most NFC Championship games (19), hosting 11 of them, also an NFC record. The team has set numerous NFL records, including most consecutive away games won (18), most consecutive seasons leading the league in scoring (4), most consecutive games scored (420 games from 1977 to 2004), most field goals in a season (44), most games won in a season (18), and most touchdowns (8) and points scored (55) in a Super Bowl.\nIn 2025, 9.2% of the franchise was sold to various groups in two separate transactions which valued the team at $8.5 billion, the largest valuation in NFL history. The stake was sold to several investors in Atherton and Menlo Park including 3.1% to the family of Vinod Khosla and 3.2% to Pete Briger Jr. of Fortress Investment Group.\nIn June 2023, the enterprise branch of the 49ers bought English soccer club Leeds United; in May 2025, it acquired 51% of Scottish soccer club Rangers F.C.\nHistory.\nMorabito family era (1946\u20131976).\nBuck Shaw years (1946\u20131954).\nThe San Francisco 49ers, an original member of the new All-America Football Conference (AAFC), were the first major league professional sports franchise based in San Francisco, and one of the first major league professional sports teams based on the Pacific Coast. In 1946, the team joined the Los Angeles Dons of the AAFC and the Los Angeles Rams of the rival National Football League as the first three teams playing a \"big four\"-sport in the Western United States, eventually becoming part of the NFL themselves in 1950.\nIn 1957, the 49ers enjoyed their first sustained success as members of the NFL. After losing the opening game of the season, the 49ers won their next three against the Rams, Bears, and Packers before returning home to Kezar Stadium for a game against the Chicago Bears on October 27, 1957. The 49ers fell behind the Bears 17\u20137. 49ers owner Tony Morabito (1910\u20131957) collapsed of a heart attack and died during the game. The 49ers players learned of his death at halftime when coach Frankie Albert was handed a note with two words: \"Tony's gone\". The 49ers scored 14 unanswered points to win the game, 21\u201317. Dicky Moegle's late-game interception in the end zone sealed the victory. After Tony's death, 49er ownership went to Victor Morabito (1919\u20131964) and Tony's widow, Josephine V. Morabito (1910\u20131995). The 49ers' special assistant to the Morabitos, Louis G. Spadia (1921\u20132013) was named general manager.\nDuring the decade of the 1950s, the 49ers were known for their so-called \"Million Dollar Backfield\", consisting of four future Hall of Fame members: quarterback Y. A. Tittle and running backs John Henry Johnson, Hugh McElhenny, and Joe Perry. They became the only full-house backfield inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.\nFor most of the next 13 years, the 49ers hovered around .490, except for 1963 and 1964 when they went 2\u201312 and 4\u201310, respectively. Key players for these 49ers included running back Ken Willard, quarterback John Brodie, and offensive lineman Bruce Bosley. During this time the 49ers became the first NFL team to use the shotgun formation. It was named by the man who devised the formation, San Francisco 49ers' coach Red Hickey, in 1960. The formation, where the quarterback lines up seven yards behind the center, was designed to allow the quarterback extra time to throw. The formation was used for the first time in 1960 and enabled the 49ers to beat the Baltimore Colts, who were not familiar with the formation.\nIn 1961, primarily using the shotgun, the 49ers got off to a fast 4\u20131 start, including two shutouts in back-to-back weeks. In their sixth game they faced the Chicago Bears, who by moving players closer to the line of scrimmage and rushing the quarterback, were able to defeat the shotgun and in fact shut out the 49ers, 31\u20130. Though the 49ers went only 3\u20135\u20131 the rest of the way, the shotgun eventually became a component of most team's offenses and is a formation used by football teams at all levels. In 1962, the 49ers had a frustrating season as they won only 6 games that year. They won only one game at Kezar Stadium while on the road they won five of seven games. After posting a losing record in 1963. Victor Morabito died May 10, 1964, at age 45. The 1964 season was another lost campaign. According to the 1965 49ers Yearbook, the co-owners of the team were: Mrs. Josephine V. Morabito Fox, Mrs. Jane Morabito, Mrs. O.H. Heintzelman, Lawrence J. Purcell, Mrs. William O'Grady, Albert J. Ruffo, Franklin Mieuli, Frankie Albert, Louis G. Spadia and James Ginella. The 1965 49ers rebounded nicely to finish with a 7\u20136\u20131 record. They were led that year by John Brodie, who after being plagued by injuries came back to become one of the NFL's best passers by throwing for 3,112 yards and 30 touchdowns. In 1966, the Morabito widows named Lou Spadia team president.\nDick Nolan years (1968\u20131975).\nFor the 1968 season, the 49ers hired Dick Nolan, who had been Tom Landry's defensive coordinator with the Dallas Cowboys, as their head coach. Nolan's first two seasons with the 49ers had gone much the same as the previous decade, with the 49ers going 7\u20136\u20131 and 4\u20138\u20132.\nThe 49ers started out the 1970 season 7\u20131\u20131, with their only loss a one-point defeat to Atlanta. After losses to Detroit and Los Angeles, the 49ers won their next two games before the season finale against the Oakland Raiders. Going into the game, the 49ers had a half-game lead on the Rams and needed either a win or a Giants victory against the Rams in their finale to give the 49ers their first-ever divisional title.\nIn the early game, the Giants lost to the Rams 31\u20133, thus forcing the 49ers to win their game to clinch the division. In wet, rainy conditions in Oakland, the 49ers won against the Raiders, 38\u20137, giving the 49ers their first divisional title, which made them champions of the NFC West. The 49ers won their divisional playoff game 17\u201314 against the defending conference champion Minnesota Vikings, thus setting up a matchup against the Dallas Cowboys for the NFC Championship. In the final home game for the 49ers at Kezar Stadium, the 49ers kept up with the Cowboys before losing 17\u201310, which resulted in the Cowboys going to Super Bowl V. The 49ers sent five players to the Pro Bowl that season, including MVP veteran quarterback John Brodie, wide receiver Gene Washington, and linebacker Dave Wilcox. Nolan was also named NFL Coach of the Year for 1970. Following the 1970 season, the 49ers moved from Kezar Stadium to Candlestick Park. Despite being located on the outskirts of the city, Candlestick Park gave the 49ers a much more modern facility with more amenities that was easier for fans to access by highway.\nThe 49ers won their second straight divisional title in 1971 with a 9\u20135 record. The 49ers again won their divisional playoff game, this time against the Washington Redskins, by 24\u201320. This set up a rematch against the Dallas Cowboys in the NFC Championship game, this time played in Dallas. Though the defense again held the Cowboys in check, the 49ers offense was ineffective, and the eventual Super Bowl champion Cowboys beat the 49ers again, 14\u20133. In 1971, eight 49ers made the Pro Bowl, including defensive back Jimmy Johnson and Gene Washington, both for the second year in a row, as well as defensive end Cedric Hardman, running back Vic Washington, and offensive lineman Forrest Blue.\nThe 49ers won their third consecutive NFC West title in 1972 with five wins in their last six games, making them the only franchise to win their first three divisional titles after the 1970 AFL\u2013NFL merger. Their opponents in the divisional playoffs were the Dallas Cowboys, making it the third consecutive year the teams faced each other in the playoffs. Vic Washington took the opening kickoff 97 yards for a score, and the 49ers took a 21\u20136 lead in the second quarter. After the 49ers took a 28\u201313 lead in the fourth quarter, Tom Landry sent quarterback Roger Staubach, who was backing up Craig Morton, into the game. Staubach quickly led the Cowboys on a drive to a field goal, bringing the score to within 28\u201316, and as the game wound down it appeared that this would be the last points the Cowboys would get. However, Dallas completed the comeback in the last two minutes. Just after the two-minute warning, Staubach took just four plays to drive 55 yards in only 32 seconds, hitting Billy Parks on a twenty-yard touchdown pass to bring the score to 28\u201323. Cowboys kicker Toni Fritsch then executed a successful onside kick that was recovered by Mel Renfro, giving the Cowboys the ball at midfield with 1:20 left on the clock. With the 49ers on the ropes, Staubach scrambled for 21 yards, then completed a 19-yard sideline pass to Billy Parks who went out of bounds at the 10-yard line to stop the clock. Staubach then completed the comeback with a 10-yard touchdown pass to Ron Sellers with only 52 seconds left, giving the Cowboys a dramatic 30\u201328 victory; it was the third straight season the Cowboys had defeated the 49ers in the postseason. It would also be their last postseason appearance for nine years.\nThe 49ers run at the top of the NFC West ended in 1973 with the 49ers falling to a 5\u20139 record, their worst since 1969. The team lost six of its last eight games, including games to the also-ran New Orleans Saints and Detroit Lions. In the final season of his career, longtime 49ers quarterback John Brodie split playing time with two other quarterbacks, most notably longtime backup Steve Spurrier. The team also suffered from not having a dominant running back, with Vic Washington leading the team with only 534 yards rushing.\nIn 1974, the 49ers drafted Wilbur Jackson from the University of Alabama to be the team's primary back. Jackson enjoyed a fine rookie year, leading the 49ers with 705 yards rushing. He and fellow running back Larry Schreiber combined for over 1,300 yards rushing. With Steve Spurrier injured and missing nearly the entire year, the 49ers did not have a regular quarterback but did put together a respectable 6\u20138 record. Following the season, longtime tight end Ted Kwalick left the 49ers to join the World Football League, then the Oakland Raiders upon the WFL's dissolution.\nThe 49ers dropped to 5\u20139 in what would be Dick Nolan's final season as coach in 1975, losing their final four games of the season. Wilbur Jackson was hurt much of the year and Delvin Williams led the 49ers in rushing with 631 yards rushing. Following the 1975 season the 49ers traded for New England Patriots quarterback Jim Plunkett, former Heisman Trophy winner from nearby Stanford University (which was also the alma mater of John Brodie). Though Plunkett had shown promise with the Patriots, he had not won there, and it was thought that he needed a change of scenery. Monte Clark was also brought on as 49ers head coach.\nThe 49ers featured one of the best running games in the NFL in 1976. Delvin Williams emerged as an elite back, gaining over 1,200 yards rushing and made the Pro Bowl. Wilbur Jackson also enjoyed a resurgence, rushing for 792 yards. Once again Gene Washington was the team's leading receiver with 457 yards receiving and six scores. The 49ers started the season 6\u20131 for their best start since 1970. Most of the wins were against second-tier teams, although the 49ers did shut out the Rams 16\u20130, in Los Angeles on \"Monday Night Football\". In that game the 49ers recorded 10 sacks, including 6 by Tommy Hart. However, the 49ers lost four games in a row, including two against divisional rivals Los Angeles and Atlanta that proved fatal to their playoff hopes.\nEdward DeBartolo era (1977\u20131999).\nLou Spadia retired from the 49ers in 1977 upon the team's sale to the DeBartolo Family. The team was sold to Edward J. DeBartolo Jr. in March 1977, and despite finishing the season with a winning record of 8\u20136, Clark was fired after just one season by newly hired general manager Joe Thomas, who oversaw the worst stretch of football in the team's history.\nUnder coach Ken Meyer the 49ers lost their first five games of the 1977 season, including being shut out twice. Though they won five of their next six, they lost their last three games to finish the season 5\u20139. Playing in San Francisco did not revive Plunkett's career as he had another disappointing season, throwing only 9 touchdown passes. Bright spots for the 49ers included defensive linemen Tommy Hart and Cleveland Elam, who made the Pro Bowl, and running backs Wilbur Jackson and Delvin Williams, who combined for over 1,600 yards rushing. Gene Washington again led the team in receiving in 1977, his final year with the 49ers. The 1977 offseason was marked by a number of questionable moves by Joe Thomas that backfired badly. Thomas's big offseason acquisition was running back O. J. Simpson from the Buffalo Bills. As with Plunkett two years previously, it was thought that rescuing Simpson from a bad situation and bringing him to the west coast where he had been raised would rejuvenate his career. To create playing time for Simpson, Thomas traded Delvin Williams to the Miami Dolphins for wide receiver Freddie Solomon. Thomas also released Jim Plunkett, giving up on him after two seasons. Finally, Thomas fired Meyer after only one season, and replaced him with Pete McCulley, his third coach in three seasons.\nThe 1978 season was a disaster for the 49ers, as they finished 2\u201314, their only wins coming against the Cincinnati Bengals and Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Simpson indeed led the team in rushing, but with less than 600 yards. It became apparent that Simpson's knees and body were worn out, and he was near the end of his career. Wilbur Jackson also missed the entire season due to injury. Even worse for the franchise was that their first pick of the 1979 draft was traded to the Bills as part of the O. J. Simpson deal. Joe Thomas was fired following the season. Some of the key players that became part of the 49ers stunning rise began their 49ers career in 1978. Rookie quarterback Steve DeBerg, Joe Montana's first mentor, was the 49ers' starting quarterback. Running back Paul Hofer and center/guard Randy Cross also started with the 49ers in 1978.\nThe team was led in its turnaround from late 1970s doormat by new owner Edward J. DeBartolo Jr. and head coach Bill Walsh. The former head coach of Stanford University was known for stockpiling draft picks, making excellent draft selections, and patching roster holes by acquiring key free agents.\nBill Walsh years (1979\u20131988).\nBill Walsh was hired to be the 49ers head coach in the 1978 off-season. Walsh was a disciple of Paul Brown, and served as Brown's offensive coordinator with the Cincinnati Bengals from 1968 to 1975. However, Brown did not appoint him as his successor upon his retirement, choosing another assistant, former 49ers center Bill \"Tiger\" Johnson. Walsh was hired by Stanford University in 1977. He went 17\u20137 in two seasons for the Cardinal before being hired by the 49ers in 1979.\nWalsh is given credit for popularizing the 'West Coast offense'. The Bill Walsh offense was actually created and refined while he was an assistant coach with the Bengals. The offense utilizes a short, precise, timed passing game as a replacement/augmentation of the running game. The offense is extremely difficult to defend against as it is content to consistently make 6\u20138-yard gains all the way down the field. (The other West Coast offense\u2014more focused on the vertical, or downfield, passing game\u2014was actually created by 1960s L.A. / San Diego coach Sid Gillman, and San Diego State coach Don Coryell, who also employed a version of it as head coach of the St. Louis (football) Cardinals and San Diego Chargers during a period where it garnered the nickname \"Air Coryell\".)\nIn Walsh's first draft, the 49ers had targeted Notre Dame quarterback Joe Montana as an early-round pick. Montana had enjoyed a storied college career, leading the Fighting Irish to the 1977 national title and a number of dramatic comeback victories, the most stunning of all being his final game, at the 1979 Cotton Bowl Classic. Playing the University of Houston in an ice storm, and with Montana suffering from a bad flu, Notre Dame was down 34\u201310 in the third quarter. However, Montana led a magnificent rally that culminated with him throwing a touchdown pass on the game's final play to give Notre Dame the 35\u201334 win.\nDespite this, most scouts did not peg Montana as a top prospect. Although 6'2\" and 190\u2013200\u00a0lbs., Montana's arm strength was considered suspect as was the consistency of his play. Although he did get his share of the credit, most thought of him as a system player surrounded by a great team.\nIn the 1979 draft, the Dallas Cowboys were placed just ahead of the 49ers. The Cowboys' draft strategy through that time was to take the highest-ranked player on their draft board at the time of their selection, regardless of position. When the Cowboys' turn came up in the third round, the highest-rated player on their board was Montana. However, feeling that the quarterback position was in excellent long-term shape with Roger Staubach and Danny White, and desperately needing a tight end, the Cowboys went off their strategy and drafted Doug Cosbie. The 49ers took Montana. The 49ers' other notable draft choice of the 1979 draft was wide receiver Dwight Clark in the 10th round. Walsh discovered the unheralded Clark while scouting quarterback Steve Fuller of Clemson University as Clark ran routes for Fuller during Walsh's evaluation of the quarterback. Walsh's serendipitous discovery of Clark proved to be an early glimpse into his philosophy for picking talent.\nAs Walsh implemented his strategies and game plan, the 49ers had another year of losing, finishing 2\u201314 like the previous season. There were, however, a number of bright spots. Despite throwing more interceptions (21) than touchdowns (17), Steve DeBerg blossomed under Walsh, throwing for over 3,600 yards and completing 60% of his passes. Freddie Solomon also had a good year, with over 800 yards receiving. The running game was patchwork, with Paul Hofer leading the team with 615 yards and O. J. Simpson, in his final season, rushing for only 460 yards and being sidelined with injuries. The 49ers got off to a strong start in 1980, winning their first three games of the season. However, the team, still maturing, lost their next eight games in a row. Many of those games though were close, and the 49ers acquitted themselves well. During the season Walsh alternated DeBerg and Montana at quarterback. Though DeBerg had played well for the 49ers, Walsh felt the team's best chance to win in the long run was with Montana. He alternated the two quarterbacks, giving Montana some experience while keeping opponents off guard. This strategy of alternating quarterbacks from game to game and during games is rare in football, although it had been employed by other successful teams in the past, specifically the Dallas Cowboys of the early 1970s who alternated Roger Staubach and Craig Morton, and the Los Angeles Rams of the late 1940s alternating Norm Van Brocklin and Bob Waterfield.\nIn all DeBerg started nine games, going 4\u20135 with 1,998 yards, 12 touchdowns and 17 interceptions. Montana started seven games, going 2\u20135 with 1,795 yards, 15 touchdowns, and nine picks; Montana also had a better completion percentage at 64.5 to DeBerg's 57.9.\nThe highlight of the 1980 season, and a sign of good things to come, came in Week 14. The 49ers trailed the New Orleans Saints, who at the time were winless at 0\u201313, 35\u20137 at halftime. However, led by Joe Montana, the 49ers made (what was then) possibly the greatest comeback in NFL history, coming back to tie the score in regulation and winning the game in overtime with a field goal by Ray Wersching to give the 49ers an incredible 38\u201335 victory. It was this game, which marked Montana's first big NFL comeback win, that won Montana the quarterback job full-time. A number of key players emerged for the 49ers in 1980. Among them were Dwight Clark, who led the 49ers with 82 receptions and just under 1,000 yards receiving, and running back Earl Cooper, who ran for over 700 yards.\nSuper Bowl XVI champions (1981).\nWith the offense playing well consistently, Walsh and the 49ers focused on overhauling the defense in 1981. Walsh took the highly unusual step of overhauling his entire secondary with rookies and untested players, bringing on board Ronnie Lott, Eric Wright and Carlton Williamson and giving Dwight Hicks a prominent role. He also acquired veteran linebacker Jack \"Hacksaw\" Reynolds and veteran defensive end and sack specialist Fred Dean. These additions, when added to existing defensive mainstays like Keena Turner, turned the 49ers into an offensively and defensively balanced, dominant team. After a 1\u20132 start, the 49ers won all but one of their remaining games to finish with a 13\u20133 record; at this time, it was the team's best regular-season win\u2013loss record. Dean made the Pro Bowl, as did Lott and Hicks. Led by Montana, the unusual offense was centered on the short passing game, which Walsh used as ball control. Dwight Clark and Freddie Solomon had excellent years receiving; Clark as the possession receiver, and Solomon as more of a deep threat. The 49ers' running game, however, was among the weakest in the league. Ricky Patton led the 49ers with only 543 yards rushing. The 49ers' most valuable running back, however, might have been Earl Cooper, whose strength was as a pass catching back. The 49ers faced the New York Giants in the divisional playoffs and won, 38\u201324. This set up an NFC championship game match-up with the Dallas Cowboys, whom the 49ers historically could not beat during their playoff runs in the early 1970s. The 49ers played the Cowboys tough, but the Cowboys forced six turnovers and held the lead late. The 49ers were down 27\u201321 and on their own 11-yard line with 4:54 remaining. As Montana had done for Notre Dame and the 49ers so many times, he led the 49ers on a sustained final 89-yard drive to the Cowboys' 6-yard line. On a 3rd-and-3 play, with his primary receiver covered, Montana rolled right and threw the ball off balance to Dwight Clark, who leaped in the end zone and caught the ball to tie the game at 27 (\"The Catch\"), with the extra point giving the 49ers the lead. The Cowboys had one last chance to win. On the first play of the next possession, Cowboys receiver Drew Pearson caught a pass from Danny White and reached midfield before he was pulled down by the jersey at the 49ers' 44-yard line by cornerback Eric Wright, who prevented a winning touchdown. On the next play, White was sacked by Lawrence Pillers and fumbled the ball, which was recovered by Jim Stuckey, giving the 49ers the win and a trip to their first-ever Super Bowl, against the Cincinnati Bengals, who were also in their first Super Bowl. In Super Bowl XVI The 49ers took a 20\u20130 halftime lead and held on to win 26\u201321 behind kicker Ray Wersching's four field goals and a key defensive stand. In the '81 season, the defense had been a significant reason for the team's success, despite hiding in the shadow of the then-innovative offense. Montana won MVP honors mostly on the strength of leading the 49ers on a 92-yard, 12-play drive culminating in a touchdown pass to Earl Cooper. The 49ers completed one of the most dramatic and complete turnarounds in NFL history, going from a 2\u201314 season and a 6\u201310 season to a Super Bowl championship.\nThe 1982 season was a retrogression; the team lost all five games at Candlestick Park en route to a 3\u20136 record in a strike-shortened season. This year was the 49ers' last losing season for the next 17 years. Joe Montana was the one highlight, passing for 2,613 yards in just nine games, highlighted by five straight games in which he broke the 300-yard barrier.\nIn 1983, the 49ers won their final three games and finished 10\u20136, winning their second NFC Western Divisional Title in three years. Leading the rebound was Joe Montana with another stellar season; he passed for 3,910 yards and 26 touchdowns. In the NFC Divisional Playoffs, the 49ers hosted the Detroit Lions. The 49ers jumped in front early and led 17\u20139 entering the 4th quarter, but the Lions roared back, scoring two touchdowns to take a 23\u201317 lead. However, Montana led a comeback, hitting wide receiver Freddie Solomon on a game-winning 14-yard touchdown pass with 2:00 on the clock and putting the 49ers ahead 24\u201323. The game ended when Lions placekicker Eddie Murray missed a game-winning FG attempt. The next week, the 49ers came back from a 21\u20130 deficit against the Washington Redskins in the NFC championship game to tie the game, before controversial penalties and a late Mark Moseley field goal sent the Redskins to a 24\u201321 victory and Super Bowl XVIII.\nSuper Bowl XIX champions (1984).\nIn 1984, the 49ers had one of the greatest seasons in team history by finishing the regular season 15\u20131, setting the record for most regular-season wins that was later equaled by the 1985 Chicago Bears, the 1998 Minnesota Vikings, the 2004 Pittsburgh Steelers, the 2011 Green Bay Packers and finally broken by the 2007 New England Patriots (with 16 regular-season victories). Their 18 wins overall is also still a record, tied by the 1985 Bears and the 2007 New England Patriots (who won 18 straight, but lost Super Bowl XLII to the New York Giants). The 49ers' only defeat in the 1984 season was a 20\u201317 loss to the Steelers; a late field goal attempt in that game by San Francisco kicker Ray Wersching went off the uprights and was no good. In the playoffs, they beat the New York Giants 21\u201310, shut out the Chicago Bears 23\u20130 in the NFC championship, and in Super Bowl XIX the 49ers shut down a record-setting year by NFL MVP Dan Marino (and his speedy receivers Mark Clayton and Mark Duper), beating the Miami Dolphins 38\u201316. Their entire defensive backfield (Ronnie Lott, Eric Wright, Dwight Hicks, and Carlton Williamson) was elected to the Pro Bowl\u2014an NFL first.\nIn the 1985 NFL draft, the team received the 28th overall pick after winning the Super Bowl the previous year. On draft day, the 49ers traded its first two picks for New England's first-round choice, the 16th selection overall (the teams also swapped third-round picks as part of the deal), and selected Jerry Rice from Mississippi Valley State. It was reported that the Dallas Cowboys, who had the 17th selection overall, were intending to pick him. In the 1985 season, the 49ers were not as dominant as in 1984, finishing the regular season with a 10\u20136 record and a wild card berth. Jerry Rice struggled at times (dropping numerous passes), but he still impressed the NFL in his rookie season for the 49ers in 1985, especially after a 10-catch, 241-yard game against the Los Angeles Rams in December. Rice was named NFC Offensive Rookie of the Year after recording 49 catches for 927 yards, and averaging 19.9 yards per catch, Roger Craig became the first NFL player to gain 1,000 yards rushing and 1,000 yards receiving in the same season. In the 1985 playoffs, the 49ers were quickly eliminated from the playoffs by the New York Giants 17\u20133.\nIn the 1986 NFL season, the 49ers got off to a quick start after a 31\u20137 win over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on opening day. But the win was costly; Joe Montana injured his back and was out for two months, the injury was to a spinal disc in Montana's lower back and required immediate surgery. The injury was so severe that Montana's doctors suggested that Montana retire. On September 15, 1986, the 49ers placed Montana on the injured reserve list, Jeff Kemp became the starting quarterback, and the 49ers went 4\u20133\u20131 in September and October.\nMontana returned to the team on November 6 of that year. In his first game back from injury, Montana passed for 270 yards and three touchdown passes in a 43\u201317 49er victory against the St. Louis Cardinals. The 49ers caught fire, winning the next 5 of the final 7 games, including a 24\u201314 win over the Los Angeles Rams, to clinch the NFC West title. Jerry Rice continued to show improvement from the previous season catching 86 passes for a league-leading 1,570 yards and 15 touchdowns. Montana was co-recipient of the 1986 NFL Comeback Player of the Year Award, which he shared with Vikings quarterback Tommy Kramer. However, the New York Giants would defeat the 49ers again in the playoffs, 49\u20133 in the team's worst post-season loss to date. Montana was again injured in the first half by a hit from the Giants' Jim Burt.\nIn the off-season, Bill Walsh was concerned about Montana's health going forward, and with no reliable back-up at quarterback he completed a trade for Steve Young, then a quarterback with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. During the strike-shortened 1987 season, the 49ers became one of the NFL's elite teams once again with a league-best 13\u20132 record. Joe Montana had a bounce-back year after his injuries the previous year and being questioned by the media if he could still produce at a high level, by throwing 31 touchdown passes, a career-high. He also set the NFL record for most consecutive pass attempts without an incomplete pass (22), passed for 3,054 yards, and had a passer rating of 102.1. Rice had established himself as an elite receiver, he caught 65 passes for 1,078 yards and a then NFL-record 22 touchdowns in just 12 games. 1987 was the second of six seasons in which Rice would lead the NFL in receiving or touchdown receptions, he was named Offensive Player of the Year. By the end of the regular season the 49ers were ranked No. 1 on both offense and defense and were heavy favorites to win the Super Bowl. However, they were stunned in the , losing 36\u201324 to what was believed to be an inferior Minnesota Vikings team, their third straight playoff loss. Joe Montana had one of the worst post-season games of his career and was eventually benched during the game in favor of Steve Young, who scored a rushing touchdown and threw another. After the game, owner Eddie DeBartolo stripped Walsh of the team president title. Dwight Clark retired that off-season.\nSuper Bowl XXIII champions (1988).\nDuring the off-season, a quarterback controversy between Joe Montana and Steve Young had begun after Montana's poor performance in the playoffs the previous year. Many speculated that the 1988 season would be his last year with the team. In the 1988 NFL season, the 49ers struggled to start the season; Walsh would constantly switch QBs between Montana (who suffered an elbow injury week 1 that would linger for most of the season) and Young. At one point, they were 6\u20135 and the team was in danger of missing the playoffs. Before week 11, Ronnie Lott called a players-only meeting; after the meeting, the team came together and defeated the defending Super Bowl champion Washington Redskins in a Monday night game, Montana had fully recovered from his injury and retook the starting quarterback job as the team eventually finished the season at 10\u20136. They gained a measure of revenge by routing the Minnesota Vikings 34\u20139 in the divisional playoffs. The 49ers then traveled to Chicago's Soldier Field for the NFC championship against the Chicago Bears, where the wind chill factor at game time was \u221226\u00b0. However, despite the weather, Joe Montana picked apart the Bears' top-rated defense by scoring three touchdowns as the 49ers dominated the Bears with a 28\u20133 victory, earning the team's third trip to the Super Bowl, to go against the Cincinnati Bengals. In Super Bowl XXIII, despite numerous trips deep into Cincinnati territory by the 49ers, the game was tied 3\u20133 at halftime. Early in the fourth quarter, Montana tied the score at 13; however, Cincinnati regained the lead on a Jim Breech field goal to put the Bengals ahead 16\u201313 with just over three minutes left on the clock. Following the kickoff, and a holding penalty, the 49ers took over on their 8-yard line with 3:08 left on the clock. Joe Montana began the final drive by stepping into the huddle and remarking to offensive tackle Harris Barton, during a television timeout, \"hey, there's John Candy\", as he pointed to the stands on the other side of the field. His calm demeanor reassured the 49ers, and he then engineered what some consider the greatest drive in Super Bowl history, as he drove the team 92 yards for the winning touchdown on a pass to John Taylor with only 34 seconds left, as they captured their third Super Bowl championship with a score of 20\u201316. Jerry Rice was named Super Bowl MVP.\nGeorge Seifert years (1989\u20131996).\nAfter Super Bowl XXIII, Bill Walsh retired as head coach; his defensive coordinator and handpicked successor, George Seifert, took over as head coach.\nSuper Bowl XXIV champions (1989).\nIn the 1989 NFL season, Joe Montana threw for 3,521 yards and 26 touchdowns, with only 8 interceptions, giving him a 112.4 quarterback rating, which was then the highest single-season passer rating in NFL history, and was named NFL Most Valuable Player. Jerry Rice, in his fifth year in the league, continued to dominate; he led the league with almost 1,490 receiving yards, and 17 touchdowns. The 49ers clinched their fourth straight division title, beating the Los Angeles Rams 30\u201327 after a dramatic second-half comeback; they finished 14\u20132, gaining home-field advantage throughout the playoffs. Their two losses were by a combined five points.\nIn the divisional playoffs, they easily defeated the Vikings, 41\u201313. In the , they played against the Rams for a third time; the previous two games had been decided by a total of 4 points, but they were able to blow out the Rams 30\u20133, earning another trip to the Super Bowl, where they defeated the Denver Broncos in relatively easy fashion by a score of 55\u201310 in Super Bowl XXIV \u2013 setting a record for points scored and widest margin of victory in a Super Bowl. Montana himself set many Super Bowl records (some since tied or surpassed) en route to his third Super Bowl MVP. In winning the Super Bowl, the 49ers became the only team to win back-to-back Super Bowls under different head coaches. This 1989 championship team is often regarded as one of the most dominant teams in NFL history, winning three playoff games by a combined 100 points.\nIn 1990, the 49ers won their first 10 games, and they eventually finished 14\u20132. They ripped through the season, and the coveted third consecutive Super Bowl victory seemed within reach. In the playoffs, the 49ers dispatched the Washington Redskins 28\u201310, setting up a conference championship game with the New York Giants. Despite not scoring a touchdown in the game, the Giants took advantage of a fourth-quarter injury to Montana and converted a faked punt attempt to thwart the 49ers' attempt at a \"three-peat\". The Giants kicked a last-second field goal after recovering a Roger Craig fumble in the final minutes of the game, winning 15\u201313 and going on to win Super Bowl XXV.\nDuring their quest for a \"three-peat\" between 1988 and 1990, the 49ers set a league record with 18 consecutive road victories. Joe Montana missed almost all of the following two seasons with a recurring elbow injury. Following the 1990 season, the 49ers left team stalwarts Roger Craig and Ronnie Lott unprotected and let them go to the Los Angeles Raiders via Plan B free agency.\nIn 1991, Steve Young injured the thumb on his throwing hand and later was sidelined with an injured knee. After 10 games, the 49ers had a record of 4\u20136. Backup quarterback Steve Bono helped the team win its next five games with Young sidelined. In the final game of the season, Monday night versus the NFC's number two seed, Young returned and the 49ers beat the Chicago Bears 52\u201314, finishing 10\u20136. However, the team missed qualifying for the playoffs by virtue of losing the head-to-head tiebreaker to the Atlanta Falcons, which had beaten the 49ers on a last-second Hail Mary pass earlier in the season.\nIn 1992, Joe Montana came back after missing almost two full seasons due to an elbow injury in his throwing arm and started the second half of a Monday night game versus Detroit on December 28, 1992. With the 49ers clinging to a 7\u20136 lead, Montana entered the game and looked as though he had not missed a single snap, completing 15\u201321 for 126 yards and 2 touchdowns, as the 49ers defeated the Lions 24\u20136. The 49ers finished the 1992 season with a 14\u20132 record and home-field advantage in the playoffs. San Francisco defeated the Washington Redskins 20\u201313 in the divisional playoff game but lost to the Dallas Cowboys 30\u201320 in the NFC championship at Candlestick Park.\nAt the end of the 1992 season, partly fueled by media hype, the biggest quarterback controversy in football history was in full swing. After discussions with the owner and the coach, Montana asked for, and was granted, a trade to the Kansas City Chiefs prior to the 1993 season. Despite Eddie DeBartolo wanting Montana to stay and start, Montana realized that he and Young could not stay with the 49ers without a controversy. Montana was later quoted as saying, \"If I had stayed and started, there would have been problems. If I had stayed and Steve Young had started, there would have been problems.\"\nThe 49ers finished the 1993 season, the team's first without Joe Montana on the roster, with a 10\u20136 record and no. 2 seed in the playoffs. San Francisco defeated the New York Giants 44\u20133 in the divisional playoff game but lost to the Dallas Cowboys 38\u201321 in the NFC championship at Texas Stadium.\nSuper Bowl XXIX champions (1994).\nIn 1994, the team spent large amounts of money on the addition of several star free agents from other teams, including Ken Norton Jr., Gary Plummer, Rickey Jackson, Bart Oates, Richard Dent, Charles Mann and Deion Sanders. Additionally, several rookie players made key contributions to the team, some becoming season-long starters such as defensive tackle Bryant Young, fullback William Floyd, and linebacker Lee Woodall. Due to injuries to the offensive line, the 49ers had some tough times early in the season, including a 40\u20138 home loss to the Philadelphia Eagles, and a 24\u201317 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs, led by former 49ers quarterback Joe Montana. Following the Eagles game, a poll conducted on local sports radio station KNBR showed that an overwhelming majority of 49er fans wanted head coach George Seifert fired. The game against the Eagles was a turning point for the 49ers despite the lopsided score. Quarterback Steve Young was benched in the 3rd quarter and was later seen on the sidelines, shouting profanities at Seifert. The following week in Detroit, the 49ers trailed the Lions 7\u20130. After throwing a pass, Young was hit, picked up, and driven into the ground by three Lions defenders. He crawled most of the way off of the field before refusing help from the trainers as he limped the remaining way off the field. He returned to the field two plays later (NFL rules state that after trainers attend to an injured player, that player must leave the field for at least one play) to lead the 49ers to a 27\u201321 victory. The team rallied around Young to win 10 straight games, including a 21\u201314 victory over the two-time defending Super Bowl champion Dallas Cowboys. During that span the 49ers' average margin of victory was nearly 20 points per game, a sustained dominance not seen since the 1985 Chicago Bears. Despite scoring only 8 points in one game and 14 in another, the 49ers set a new record for total regular-season and post-season combined points scored. That record was later broken by the New England Patriots in 2007 (the 1998 Minnesota Vikings scored 556 regular-season points, but only 68 postseason points, for a total of 624 points, while the 1994 49ers scored 495 regular-season points and 131 postseason points for a total of 626, the second-highest mark in NFL history). Even after those initial rough spots early in the season, the 49ers finished the season 13\u20133 and with home-field advantage throughout the playoffs. In their first game, they easily defeated the Chicago Bears, 44\u201315, setting up the third straight . The 49ers took advantage of three early Cowboys turnovers, taking a 21\u20130 lead in the first quarter. Taking a 31\u201314 lead into halftime after a perfect 29-yard pass from Young to Rice in the closing seconds, the game appeared to be far out of reach for the Cowboys. But a 49er fumble on the opening kick of the 3rd quarter led to a Cowboy score, cutting the lead to 31\u201321. Later, the 49ers responded with a Young touchdown run, making it 38\u201321, before the Cowboys scored another touchdown in the final minutes for a final score of 38\u201328. The convincing win qualified the 49ers for their fifth Super Bowl appearance, and the first to be played by two teams from California. The 49ers steamrolled the San Diego Chargers 49\u201326 behind Young's record-setting 6 touchdown passes in Super Bowl XXIX, at the time becoming the first team to win a record five Super Bowls. Finally establishing himself as a worthy successor to Joe Montana, Young was named the game's MVP. The 49ers' run of five Super Bowl wins in 14 seasons (1981\u20131994) solidified them alongside the 1960s Vince Lombardi Green Bay Packers and 1970s Chuck Knoll Pittsburgh Steelers as one of the modern NFL's great dynasties.\nThe 49ers finished with a 11\u20135 record, won the division, and made the playoffs in 1995. The team finished with a 12\u20134 record and made the postseason in 1996. In both 1995 and 1996, they were eliminated by the Green Bay Packers both times in the Divisional Round. On January 17, 1997, George Seifert resigned as 49ers head coach. On the same day as Seifert's resignation, the 49ers hired Cal head coach Steve Mariucci as his replacement. At the time, Mariucci only had one year of head-coaching experience at any level. The first game of the 1997 season against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers was a disaster, as both quarterback Steve Young and receiver Jerry Rice went down with injuries. Rice appeared to be out for the season with a serious knee injury, while Young left the game with one of the many concussions he suffered throughout his career. However, the team overcame adversity: Young returned two weeks later, and with the league's number one defense, the 49ers finished the season with a 13\u20133 record which included an 11-game winning streak which was the longest by a rookie head coach at the time, and the 49ers became the quickest team in NFL history to clinch their division at the time. Rice returned for one and a half quarters in week 16 against the Denver Broncos, before getting another injury to his knee (unrelated to the first one). In the playoffs the 49ers defeated the Minnesota Vikings 38\u201322, advancing to the for the first time since 1994, where they again met the Green Bay Packers at Candlestick Park, but lost 23\u201310.\nDuring that season Eddie DeBartolo Jr. was involved in a corruption investigation regarding Louisiana Governor Edwin Edwards and one of his Mississippi riverboat casinos. DeBartolo later pleaded guilty to a failure to report a felony charge in 1998. He was suspended from active control of the 49ers for one year. His sister, Denise, and her husband, Dr. John York, took over operations of the team.\nIn 1998, Jerry Rice finally returned from his knee injury week 1 against the New York Jets, a game best remembered for running back Garrison Hearst's 96-yard touchdown run in overtime to win the game. The 49ers had the 2nd most productive offense in league history. Young, who was questioned if his concussion history would put an end to his career, had his best season, throwing for 4,170 yards, 36 touchdowns and only 12 interceptions. A healthy Jerry Rice, 3rd-year player Terrell Owens, and 4th-year player J.J. Stokes became the first WR-trio in team history to catch at least 60 passes in the same season, Hearst ran for 1,570 yards and 7 touchdowns while averaging 5.1 yards per carry. The 49ers finished 12\u20134, their 16th straight winning season (all with 10 wins or more), earning a wildcard berth.\nOnce again, the 49ers faced the Green Bay Packers in the playoffs. Things looked bleak when the 49ers trailed 27\u201323 in the waning seconds. However, in the game's final moment, Young hit Terrell Owens (who was having a terrible game up to that point) on a dramatic, game-winning 25-yard touchdown pass, dubbed by many as \"The Catch II\". That put the 49ers ahead 30\u201327 with just three seconds left on the game clock, sealing the win. After finally beating the Packers, the 49ers went on to lose to the eventual NFC champion Atlanta Falcons in the 20\u201318, in a game that was marked by Hearst suffering a gruesome broken ankle on the first play from scrimmage.\nYork family era (2000\u2013present).\nDeBartolo returned from his suspension in 1999, but a series of lawsuits over control of the family's vast holdings led him to surrender controlling interest to the Yorks as part of a 2000 settlement. Denise York became chair of the board, while John York became CEO. On the field, the 1999 49ers got off to a 3\u20131 start, then in a nationally televised \"Monday Night Football\" game against the Arizona Cardinals, Steve Young suffered a blindside hit from cornerback Aeneas Williams that knocked him out of the game and eventually convinced him to retire. At the time it was believed the severe hit ended his career but Young later said in interviews he could have come back to play another season or two. After meeting with then-general manager Bill Walsh and being told about how the salary cap troubles would make the team non-competitive, Young chose to retire rather than risk his long-term health further for a likely losing club. Without their future Hall of Famer, 29-year-old rookie Jeff Garcia took over as starting quarterback, but he would be benched for poor performances in favor of Steve Stenstrom. Garcia would be reinstated as the starting quarterback and in the final 5 games of the regular season. The 49ers lost 11 of their last 12 games and suffered their first losing season in a non-strike year since 1980, which was also the last time that the 49ers did not win at least ten or more games in a season. Bobb McKittrick, 49ers offensive line coach since 1979, also died of cancer following the 1999 season.\nBefore the 2000 season Jeff Garcia was named the starting quarterback despite the 49ers drafting two quarterbacks (Giovanni Carmazzi in the third round and Tim Rattay in the seventh). Garcia kept the starting job throughout the season and showed drastic improvement from the previous year. He broke a franchise record for most passing yards in one season, with 4,278 passing yards and 31 touchdowns and only 10 interceptions. Garcia and Terrell Owens, who established himself as the team's number-one receiver, both earned their first Pro Bowl selections. However, the 49ers finished 6\u201310, missing the playoffs for the second straight season for the first time since 1979 and 1980, due to a defense that gave up 26.4 points per game and a total of 422 points. The 2000 season was Jerry Rice's final year with the 49ers; he played 16 seasons with the team. In the 2001 season the 49ers established themselves as a playoff team once again after two down years. They finished with a 12\u20134 record and a wildcard berth. A quarter of their wins came in 4th-quarter comebacks. Their defense also had a bounce-back year, going from the 28th-ranked defense in 2000, to the 9th-ranked. Terrell Owens had become Jeff Garcia's favorite target. Garrison Hearst, who had been forced to retire from football after breaking his ankle in the 1998 divisional playoffs, finally returned to the line-up after over two years of rehabilitation. He became the first player in NFL history to come back to football after suffering avascular necrosis. He had an excellent season, rushing for 1,206 yards on a 4.8 average. His comeback earned him the NFL Comeback Player of the Year Award. In the final six weeks of the season the 49ers defense shut out three teams (the Buffalo Bills, Miami Dolphins, and New Orleans Saints), and had one of the most stupendous goal-line stands against the Philadelphia Eagles. In the team's first playoff game in 2 years, they played against the Green Bay Packers at Lambeau Field in the , but lost 25\u201315.\nThe 2002 NFL season began with the divisional realignment. The 49ers gained two new divisional rivals, the Seattle Seahawks and Arizona Cardinals, while former divisional foes Atlanta Falcons, New Orleans Saints, and Carolina Panthers moved to the newly formed NFC South. The team's production dropped from the previous year. Jeff Garcia went from having 31 and 32 touchdowns in the previous 2 seasons, to only 21 in 2002. The 49ers defense struggled at times, dropping from the 9th-ranked defense in the previous season to the 19th-ranked. Even though the team did not have the same success as they did in the 2001 regular season, the 49ers won the NFC West for the first time since 1997, with the division-clinching game coming on a last-second touchdown pass to Terrell Owens against the Dallas Cowboys. The 49ers finished 10\u20136. In the 2002\u201303 NFL playoffs they hosted the New York Giants in the . The Giants had a 38\u201314 lead late in the third quarter; however, the Giants defense, which had been highly ranked all year, began to collapse, and by the final minute in the 4th quarter Jeff Garcia had led the team back from the 24-point deficit to take a 1-point lead. Giants quarterback Kerry Collins then led a drive in the game's final minute to put the Giants at the 49ers' 23-yard line with six seconds left for a shot at a game-winning field goal. Long snapper Trey Junkin, who had been signed by the Giants that week, made a bad snap, so holder Matt Allen attempted a desperate pass down the field, which fell incomplete, but there was a flag on the play. The initial thought by spectators and the Giants was that pass interference had clearly been committed by the 49ers defense, but the flag was against the Giants for an ineligible receiver, so the game was over. The next day, the NFL admitted that the referee had blown the call, that the 49ers had indeed committed pass interference, and that the down should have been replayed. A press conference was held, and a reporter asked 49ers head coach Steve Mariucci about his thoughts on the NFL saying they blew the call, and he replied: \"Bummer\". It was the second-biggest comeback victory in NFL playoff history, with the 49ers winning 39\u201338. The 49ers lost the next week to the eventual Super Bowl champion Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the , 31\u20136. This was the last postseason appearance for the 49ers until the 2011\u201312 playoffs. Steve Mariucci, whose published statements about his degree of power in the organization had frayed already-strained relations with management, was fired by John York, despite a winning record in a clash of egos.\nThen-Oregon State head coach Dennis Erickson was signed to a five-year contract to replace Mariucci. The hiring of Erickson was highly criticized by the fans and the media, as Erickson's offensive philosophy was very different from the West Coast offense. The 2003 season was one of turmoil for the 49ers. While the Niners started the season with a 49\u20137 demolishing of Chicago, the team quickly began to unravel afterwards, as the relationship between Garcia and Owens turned sour upon Garcia taking issue with Owens's public praise for the play of backup quarterback Tim Rattay. Garcia responded with a cryptic remark of \"we cannot let the sickness spread\"; in response, Owens wore a surgeon's mask at the following practice. The team was also ravaged by injuries to key players on both sides of the ball; the often reckless play of Jeff Garcia started to take a toll on him, as he was forced to miss 3 games during the season. The 49ers finished 7\u20139 and missed the playoffs. Despite this disappointing result, Erickson was retained as coach for the 2004 season. Owens' on- and off-field antics led to the 49ers trading him to the Philadelphia Eagles during the offseason. Several other key 49er players were released due to salary cap concerns, including Garcia and Hearst. The team finished the 2004 season with a 2\u201314 record, tying a franchise-worst and finishing last in the NFC West for the first time since 1979, ending what had been the NFL's longest active streak for not finishing last in a division. With the worst record in the NFL the team secured the rights to the first pick in the NFL Draft. Dennis Erickson and general manager Terry Donahue were fired.\nAfter an extensive coaching search, the 49ers hired the defensive coordinator of the Baltimore Ravens Mike Nolan as their head coach. Nolan was the son of Dick Nolan, who had led the team to three consecutive playoff appearances from 1970 to 1972. The 49ers did not hire a general manager. In Mike Nolan's first draft as head coach, he selected quarterback Alex Smith from the University of Utah with the first overall pick of the 2005 NFL draft. It was a pick predicted by most, though many thought the 49ers might select local product Aaron Rodgers of the University of California. Alex Smith's rookie season was a disaster, producing only one touchdown against eleven interceptions. The team finished 4th in the NFC West for the second consecutive year, with a 4\u201312 record. This earned the 49ers the 6th pick in the 2006 NFL draft which they used to draft tight end Vernon Davis. Alex Smith and the team improved greatly in 2006, led by second-year player Frank Gore from the University of Miami. Gore ran for a franchise record of 1,695 rushing yards, which led the NFC, along with 8 touchdowns. He was awarded his first Pro Bowl appearance. They also swept division rival and defending NFC Champion, Seattle Seahawks, and kept the Denver Broncos from a playoff berth in the last game of the season. However, the team finished 7\u20139, their fourth consecutive losing season.\nIn the off-season, the 49ers signed cornerback Nate Clements and safety Michael Lewis to improve their secondary. Clement's contract was worth $80 million for eight years, the largest contract given to a defensive player in NFL history at the time. In the NFL draft, the 49ers made another key addition to their defense, selecting middle linebacker Patrick Willis with the 11th overall pick. Willis would eventually be named the 2007 AP NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year. Before the beginning of the 2007 season, Hall of Fame coach Bill Walsh died of complications from leukemia. The 49ers started the season 2\u20130, for the first time since 1998. In the fourth game of the season, against the Seattle Seahawks, Alex Smith suffered a separated shoulder on the third play of the game, an injury that severely hampered his play and ultimately led to an early end to his 2008 campaign after having shoulder surgery. Chiefly due to back-up quarterback Trent Dilfer's struggles and Alex Smith's injury, the 49ers lost eight straight consecutive games from week three through week twelve, ending the year with a disappointing 5\u201311 record. Questions were raised about the future of Alex Smith, whose first three seasons had been plagued by inconsistent play, injuries, and never having had the same offensive coordinator from one year to the next. Head coach Mike Nolan and new offensive coordinator Mike Martz stated that a competition between Smith, Shaun Hill, and NFL journeyman J. T. O'Sullivan would run through the first two preseason games of 2008. O'Sullivan was named the 49ers starter because of his familiarity with the Martz offense and after performing better than Smith or Hill in the first three preseason games. On October 20, 2008, after a 2\u20135 start, Mike Nolan was fired. Assistant head coach Mike Singletary, a Hall of Fame linebacker with the Chicago Bears, was named as the interim head coach. Singletary proved to be a fan favorite when after his first game as head coach he delivered a memorable post-game interview. Singletary said of their loss: \"... right now, we've got to figure out the formula. Our formula. Our formula is this: We go out, we hit people in the mouth.\" The team went 5\u20134 overall under Singletary, winning five of its final seven games and ending the season with a 7\u20139 record. After the last game of the season, Singletary was named permanent head coach by Jed York, who had been appointed as team president just days before. Jed York is the son of John York and Denise DeBartolo York.\nOn April 25, 2009, the 49ers selected Texas Tech wide receiver Michael Crabtree, a player many people thought would go in the top five, with the 10th pick in the first round of the 2009 NFL draft. The 2009 training camp became the first since 2005 that the 49ers failed to have all drafted rookies signed and in training camp on time, as Crabtree held out trying to reach a contract. He finally reached a contract agreement on October 7, 2009, having missed the first four games of the regular season. The 49ers posted an 8\u20138 record after a frustrating season, losing only 2 games by more than a touchdown. Nevertheless, it was the team's first non-losing season since 2002. Despite missing the playoffs for the seventh straight season, several key players showed signs of improvement. Alex Smith regained his role as the 49ers' starting quarterback (after Shaun Hill had won the starting job in training camp), passing for more than 2,000 yards with 19 touchdowns, while Frank Gore collected his fourth consecutive 1,000-yard season, a 49ers record. Safety Dashon Goldson showed signs of potential in his first year as full-time starter, as he tallied 94 tackles, four interceptions, three forced fumbles, and two sacks. Vernon Davis in particular had a breakthrough year at tight end, earning Pro Bowl honors with 965 yards and 13 touchdowns (tying the NFL record for his position). 2010 saw five 49ers go to the Pro Bowl: Patrick Willis, Vernon Davis, Frank Gore, Justin Smith, and punter Andy Lee.\nThe 2010 season started with the 49ers heavy favorites to win the NFC West after Cardinals quarterback Kurt Warner retired early in the offseason, but the season was a disaster. They started 0\u20135, their worst start since the dark days of 1979. In week 3, the 49ers fired offensive coordinator Jimmy Raye, who had been hand-picked by Singletary in the 2009 offseason. Starting safety Michael Lewis demanded to be released after he was demoted in favor of rookie safety Taylor Mays. By mid-season, Singletary was switching quarterbacks between Alex Smith and Troy Smith, who had been picked up in free agency after the preseason, but with little effect. On December 27, 2010, the 49ers fired Mike Singletary as head coach, naming defensive line coach Jim Tomsula as interim head coach for the last game of the season. The 49ers finished 6\u201310 that season.\nJim Harbaugh years (2011\u20132014).\nOn January 4, 2011, Jed York promoted interim General Manager Trent Baalke to be the permanent general manager. Baalke had taken over the role after former general manager Scot McCloughan was relieved of his duties the year before. Two days later, on January 7, 2011, former head coach of Stanford University Jim Harbaugh was named the 49ers new head coach. In the 2011 NFL draft, the 49ers selected defensive end/linebacker Aldon Smith from the University of Missouri with the seventh pick of the first round. The 49ers also selected quarterback Colin Kaepernick from the University of Nevada, Reno with the 36th overall pick in the second round.\nAfter the end of a labor dispute that nearly threatened to postpone or cancel the 2011 season the 49ers made a controversial decision to re-sign Alex Smith to a one-year $4.8 million contract. Because of the decision to retain Smith, and a shortened offseason with an entirely new coaching staff being hired, the team was expected to be among the league's worst by NFL prognosticators. Despite this, Harbaugh's first season was a huge success. After 10 weeks the 49ers were 9\u20131, highlighted by road wins against the Philadelphia Eagles, where the team came back from a 20-point deficit in the second half, and the previously unbeaten Detroit Lions. The 49ers' defense became one of the most intimidating in the league, particularly against the run \u2013 not allowing a 100-yard rusher or a single rushing touchdown until week 16 of the regular season. Alex Smith blossomed in the new system, reviving his career while playing for yet another new offensive coordinator \u2013 his sixth in six years. In week 13 the 49ers won the NFC West with a victory against the St. Louis Rams, finally ending their nine-year playoff drought. The 49ers finished the season with a 13\u20133 record, earning the second overall seed in the NFC Playoffs. In the Divisional Playoffs they defeated the New Orleans Saints 36\u201332 after a touchdown pass from Alex Smith to Vernon Davis in the closing seconds of the game. The team reached the NFC championship for the first time since 1997 and faced the New York Giants. They lost to the Giants with a 20\u201317 score in overtime after two critical fumbles by backup return man Kyle Williams.\nIn 2012, the 49ers were predicted to be the NFC West champions and possibly make a run for the Super Bowl. Starting the season 6\u20132, the 49ers went on to face the rival St. Louis Rams in Week 10. Alex Smith suffered a concussion in the second quarter and exited the game. He was replaced by 2011 second-round pick Colin Kaepernick, who led the 49ers back to tie the game. The next week, Kaepernick and the 49ers blew out the Chicago Bears 32\u20137, and Harbaugh chose Kaepernick as the starter next week against the New Orleans Saints, despite Smith being cleared to play. A quarterback controversy began. Despite Smith leading the NFL in completion percentage (70%) and passer rating (104.1), Kaepernick was considered more dynamic with his scrambling ability and arm strength. Kaepernick eventually started the rest of the season, going 5\u20132. Kaepernick set the record for rushing yards for a quarterback in the playoffs with 181 rushing yds against the Green Bay Packers. The 49ers defeated the Packers and Atlanta Falcons in the playoffs and advanced to Super Bowl XLVII, but were denied their sixth Super Bowl win against the Baltimore Ravens, who were coached by John Harbaugh, 34\u201331.\nAnother storyline towards the end of the 2012 season was the reliability of kicker David Akers. Towards the end of the season, he began to show signs of decline, missing one field goal of 20\u201330 yards, two field goals of 30\u201340 yards, and six field goals of 40\u201350 yards for a below-average conversion percentage of 69%. Akers was released on March 6, 2013. Shortly afterwards, the 49ers signed veteran kicker Phil Dawson. The 49ers would also trade a sixth round draft pick for wide receiver Anquan Boldin from the Baltimore Ravens, the team that had beaten them in the Super Bowl.\nThe 49ers finished 12\u20134 in the 2013 regular season and enter the playoffs as a wildcard, with their first game at Lambeau Field against the Green Bay Packers. On January 5, 2014, San Francisco 49ers defeated Green Bay Packers 23\u201320. On January 12, 2014, the 49ers defeated the Carolina Panthers 23\u201310, thus advancing to their third straight NFC championship game. However, the 49ers' season ended at CenturyLink Field in Seattle, when a pass intended for Michael Crabtree was tipped by cornerback Richard Sherman and intercepted by linebacker Malcolm Smith, losing to the Seattle Seahawks, . After the Niners had their first 8\u20138 season in 4 years, which included losses to the Bay Area rival Oakland Raiders, Chicago Bears, and St. Louis Rams, the collapse of a once-dominant offensive line, failing to reach the playoffs, Harbaugh and the 49ers decided to part ways on December 28, 2014, after the season's final game, against the Arizona Cardinals, which the 49ers won 20\u201317.\nOn November 8, 2006, reports surfaced that the 49ers ended negotiations with the city of San Francisco about building a new stadium and plan to do so in Santa Clara, a suburb of San Jose; Santa Clara already hosts the team's administrative headquarters and training facility. The Yorks and then-San Francisco mayor Gavin Newsom had been talking over the last few months about building a privately financed stadium at Candlestick Point that was intended to be part of the city's bid for the 2016 Summer Olympics. The 49ers' final decision to move the stadium ended the San Francisco bid for the 2016 Summer Olympics. San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Chicago were the three cities competing to be the U.S. Olympic Committee's choice to bid on the 2016 games, with Chicago emerging as the eventual victor.\nThe 49ers sponsored \"Measure J\", which appeared on the June 8, 2010, Santa Clara ballot, to build a new stadium as the future home of the San Francisco 49ers in that city. The measure passed with 58.2% of the total vote. This was seen as the first step for the 49ers' move to a venue to be built in Santa Clara.\nThe 68,490-seat venue, Levi's Stadium, landed rights for its first event. The stadium was home to the Fight Hunger Bowl.\nOn the 49ers website, the team's owner, businessman John York had a letter stating that after a stadium is constructed in Santa Clara, the team would retain its name \"San Francisco\" even though the team would no longer be located within Metro San Francisco.\nUnited States Senator Dianne Feinstein and other leaders threatened an attempt to prevent the team from using \"San Francisco\" or the \"49ers\" in the team name, but probably would not have succeeded without changes to state or federal law.\nYork confirmed in a press conference on November 9, 2011, that the team would build a state-of-the-art stadium in Santa Clara in time for the 2014 season. Ground was broken for the new stadium on April 19, 2012.\nOn May 8, 2013, the 49ers announced that San Francisco-based Levi Strauss &amp; Co. had purchased the naming rights to the new stadium. The deal calls for Levi's to pay $220.3 million to the city of Santa Clara and the 49ers over 20 years, with an option to extend the deal for another five years for around $75 million.\nJim Tomsula was hired on January 14, 2015, to replace Jim Harbaugh. Subsequently, Geep Chryst was promoted to offensive coordinator and Eric Mangini was hired as defensive coordinator. On March 10, 2015, All-Pro linebacker Patrick Willis announced his retirement from the NFL due to repeated injuries to both feet. A week later on March 17, linebacker Chris Borland, Patrick Willis' presumed replacement, announced his retirement from the NFL due to fears of the effects of head trauma. These two retirements left the 49ers linebackers position group weakened as they headed into an offseason under first year head coach Jim Tomsula. Two other developments during the 49ers off season, the retirements of starters defensive end Justin Smith, and right tackle Anthony Davis, and the uncertainty of linebacker Aldon Smith's availability due to his legal issues.\nThe 49ers signed running back Reggie Bush, wide receiver Torrey Smith, and defensive tackle Darnell Dockett.\nTomsula employed new coaching practices, which included giving his players breaks to check social media during meetings, shorter, easier practices, and more days off. The result was one of the worst offenses in team history. Scoring only 238 points, the 49ers struggled to a 5\u201311 season, with Colin Kaepernick ending the season on injured reserve after being benched. The 49ers would ultimately be eliminated from postseason contention in Week 14 of the 2015 regular season. On January 4, 2016, the 49ers fired Tomsula after he led them to a 5\u201311 record.\nOn January 14, 2016, Chip Kelly was hired as head coach. Kelly's tenure began with an emphatic 28\u20130 victory over the Los Angeles Rams on \"Monday Night Football\". However, the team went on to lose a franchise-record 13 straight games until they narrowly defeated the Rams 22\u201321 on December 24, 2016. On October 21, 2016, in an ESPN ranking of professional sports franchises, the 49ers were ranked the worst franchise in North America. The 49ers ended up firing Kelly and Baalke following the conclusion of the regular season, finishing with a 2\u201314 record.\nIn 2016, Kaepernick knelt during the playing of the national anthem as a protest the treatment of minorities in the United States. Others followed suit throughout the NFL, drawing controversy. President Donald Trump spoke out against the protests a number of times, and Vice President Mike Pence walked out of a 49ers game in October 2017 upon seeing players kneel.\nKyle Shanahan years (2017\u2013present).\nAfter hiring John Lynch as general manager and Kyle Shanahan as head coach, the 49ers started the 2017 season with nine consecutive losses. During this time, they traded for New England Patriots backup quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo. After a win over the New York Giants and a loss to the Seattle Seahawks, Garoppolo was named the starter after rookie C. J. Beathard suffered an injury. The 49ers won their last five games with Garoppolo at the helm and finished the season 6\u201310. After the season, the 49ers signed Garoppolo to a five-year, $137.5 million contract extension. This made him the highest-paid player in NFL history on a per-year basis at the time. During the third-week matchup between the 49ers and Kansas City Chiefs, Garoppolo tore his ACL, and was ruled out for the rest of the 2018 season. The 49ers struggled to a 4\u201312 record in the 2018 season.\nThe 49ers started the 2019 season with an 8\u20130 record. This was the first time they had gone 8\u20130 since 1990, where they started the season 10\u20130 and eventually lost in the . In Week 7, the 49ers defeated the Washington Redskins at FedExField in a game referred to as a Mud Bowl with a final score of 9\u20130. This was the first time the 49ers shut out an opponent since Week 1 of the 2016 season, versus the Los Angeles Rams. In Week 8, the 49ers defeated the Carolina Panthers, 51\u201313, making it the 12th time the team has scored 50 points or more against opponents in the regular season. The 49ers' undefeated record was broken in Week 10 with an overtime loss against the Seattle Seahawks, giving them an 8\u20131 record. They went on to beat the Arizona Cardinals, the Green Bay Packers, and the New Orleans Saints, while losing to the Baltimore Ravens by a last-second field goal, dropping them to 11\u20132. The 49ers then lost their next game in the final seconds to the Atlanta Falcons. The 49ers defeated the Los Angeles Rams 34\u201331 and advanced to 12\u20133, eliminating the Rams from playoff contention in the process.\nOn December 29, 2019, the 49ers defeated the Seahawks 26\u201321 in the Week 17 regular-season finale thereby clinching the NFC West in addition to the number one seed for the first time since 1997. In their first playoff game since 2013, against the Minnesota Vikings, they dominated the Vikings, defeating them 27\u201310. This victory ensured them a spot in the NFC Championship game, in Levi's Stadium, where they played the Green Bay Packers. On January 19, 2020, they beat the Packers 37\u201320, advancing to their first Super Bowl since 2012. The 49ers also became the first team to reach the Super Bowl following four straight seasons with 10+ losses. In Super Bowl LIV, the 49ers led the Kansas City Chiefs 20\u201310 with seven minutes remaining in the fourth quarter but lost the game by the final score of 31\u201320, resulting in the Chiefs' first championship victory since 1969.\nThe 49ers had a 6\u201310 record in 2020, usually attributed to the number of injuries on the team.\nIn 2021, they had a 10\u20137 record and advanced to the playoffs as the #6-seed. On January 16, 2022, they defeated the Dallas Cowboys 23\u201317 in the Wild Card Round. The next week, in the Divisional Round, they defeated the Green Bay Packers 13\u201310, the winning margin from a field goal on the game's last play. On January 30, they faced the Los Angeles Rams for the NFC championship, where the Rams overcame a ten-point deficit in the fourth quarter to win 20\u201317, assisted in part by a costly Jimmy Garoppolo interception and a critical interception dropped by Jaquiski Tartt.\nIn 2022, they overcame their 3\u20134 status at the beginning of the season and vaulted into 13\u20134, giving them the division title. Trey Lance, who was the original starter for the Niners, was injured within the first three games and replaced by Garoppolo. However, after an injury during a game against the Miami Dolphins, Garoppolo was replaced by third-string quarterback Brock Purdy, who became a star within the team, winning all of his starts with 13 touchdowns and 4 interceptions in the final 5 games to clinch the NFC 2nd seed and a spot in the playoffs. In the Wild Card Round, the 49ers defeated the Seahawks 41\u201323. In the Divisional Round, they defeated the Dallas Cowboys 19\u201312. However, in the NFC Conference Championship Round, both Purdy and fourth-string quarterback Josh Johnson suffered injuries. The 49ers were mostly unable to acquire offensive points as they lost 31\u20137 to the Philadelphia Eagles, who would move on to lose to the Kansas City Chiefs in Super Bowl LVII.\nThis was the last season for both Trey Lance and Jimmy Garoppolo, who were traded to the Dallas Cowboys and signed by the Las Vegas Raiders, respectively, making Brock Purdy the titular quarterback for the 2023 season. They opened the season with a five-game winning streak, but then lost to the Cleveland Browns off a last-minute missed field goal, setting up a 3-game losing streak heading into the bye week. After the bye week, the team went on a 6-win streak and clinched the NFC West after beating the Arizona Cardinals 45\u201329. Two weeks later, the 49ers clinched the 1st seed in the NFC by beating the Washington Commanders, combined with losses from the Detroit Lions and the Philadelphia Eagles, ending the regular season with a record of 12\u20135.\nIn the postseason, they defeated the Green Bay Packers in a close game 24\u201321 to reach the NFC Championship Game for the third consecutive season, and their fourth in five seasons. In the NFC Championship Game, after being down 24\u20137 at halftime against the Detroit Lions, the 49ers rallied off a 27\u20137 run to win 34\u201331, allowing them to reach Super Bowl LVIII, which was a rematch of Super Bowl LIV with the Chiefs. The 49ers would lose the game 25\u201322 in the second-ever Super Bowl to go into overtime.\nIn March 2024, Jed York acquired enough of his mother's equity in the 49ers to become principal owner, though his parents stayed on as co-chairs. In a 2024 season marred by injuries, the 49ers finished with a 6\u201311 record.\nChampionships.\nSuper Bowls.\nThe 49ers have won five Super Bowls, tied for most of any NFC team, their first three under Bill Walsh. Walsh retired after winning his third in 1988, but first-year head coach George Seifert did not miss a beat, winning the Super Bowl in his first year in 1989. He would also win one more in 1994.\nLogos and uniforms.\nLogo.\nThe original 49ers logo was a mustached 49er gold miner from the 1849 California Gold Rush, dressed in plaid pants and a red shirt, jumping in midair with his hat falling off, and firing pistols in each hand: one nearly shooting his foot, and the other pistol forming the word \"Forty-Niners\" from its smoke. An alternate logo with a shield-shaped crest formed from the number \"49\", with a football in the upper right quadrant and \"SF\" in the lower-left quadrant was created in 1965 and used for marketing purposes until 1972. From 1962, the 49ers' logo has been the iconic \"SF\" within the center of a red oval; throughout the years the logo has had minor modifications, such as a black outlining on the intertwined \"SF\" that was added in 1989 and a gold trimming inside the oval that was added in 1996.\nUniforms.\nThe San Francisco 49ers have two different uniforms: red and gold home uniforms and white, red, and gold road uniforms. However, the 49ers have changed uniform designs and color combinations quite often throughout their history. From the team's inception in 1946, they wore dark or cardinal red, switching to scarlet red jerseys and gold pants for the 1948 season, with a gold helmet with one red stripe, with solid red socks and pants with no stripes. Entering the 1949 season, the first in the NFL, the 49ers adopted three stripes to their red jerseys, wearing gold helmets and pants, with no stripes and red socks with three white stripes. In the 1953, '54, and '55 seasons, the 49ers wore red helmets with a gold stripe in the middle, with silver pants with one single stripe of red. The socks also added the three stripes similar to the jersey's. 1955 was also unique in that the 49ers wore white pants with a black stripe bounded by two red stripes, and shadow drop numbers on their red jerseys, with black shadow drop borders on the white numerals. The following season, 1956, the team wore white helmets with no stripes, and white pants with a red stripe. In 1957 the 49ers wore red jerseys, a gold helmet with no stripes, and gold pants with no stripes; for the first time the 49ers wore white on the road, as dictated by the NFL for all teams, to have at least one team wearing a light-colored jersey during games. The first white jersey had two red stripes with a gold in the middle, as was their road socks: white, with two red stripes and gold in the middle. San Francisco wore red and gold in 1958 as well, with their white jersey having a single shoulder loop stripe, as well as adding TV numbers to the sleeves of their home and away jerseys. And in contrast to the socks at home, red with three red stripes, the away socks were solid red. In 1959 the team switched to red and platinum gold (looking more like silver), and for the next several years afterwards, with their white jerseys having double shoulder loop stripes (mimicking UCLA's), but continuing with the three white stripes on the sleeves above the elbow and below the TV numbers, with the red home jerseys. In 1960, the team added \"Northwestern\" red stripes to their helmets (a thicker middle stripe bordered by two thinner stripes), and that changed in 1962, with the addition of the helmet design the team has mostly worn since: white stripe bounded by two red, with the red oval and SF logo on the sides of the helmet. In 1964 the team's colors then changed again. All silver elements were changed to what was called \"49er Gold;\" helmets were gold. New beige-gold pants with a red-white-red tri-stripe in the same style as the helmet were introduced. Uniform's basic design would be worn for practically the next 30 seasons with only some minor changes and adjustments, such as a gradual change over from sans-serif to serifed block numerals from 1970 to 1974 and a switch from thin stripes to a very thick pant striping in 1976 (during which white jerseys were also worn at home for most of that season). The uniform ensemble of red and white jerseys, and beige-gold pants with thick striping were worn until 1995 with a few minor changes. During the 1994 season, many NFL teams wore \"throwback uniforms\" on occasional games to celebrate the NFL's 75th anniversary (a corresponding diamond-shaped 75th Anniversary patch was also worn by all teams) . The 49ers chose to wear a version of their 1955 uniforms as their throwbacks, with simpler sans-serif block numerals that were outlined and shadowed in black with White pants with thinner red-black-red striping were also worn, along with the old striped red socks. The regular 1989\u201395 design gold helmet was worn with this uniform, as there was no logo on the 1955 helmet.\nIn 1996, the 49ers celebrated their 49th anniversary by designing a commemorative jersey patch based on the earlier shield-crest logo. The team also debuted a substantially new uniform design, most notably changing the shade of red used in their jerseys from bright scarlet to a deeper, cardinal red a black dropshadow effect (along with gold trim) was added to the jersey numerals (which remained in the blocked serif style). As in 1994, the Niners donned white pants full-time for the 1996 season (also wearing them for the 1997 season and 1998 preseason,) though this time the pant stripes were marginally thicker and the colors were reversed to black-cardinal red-black (matching the striping on the helmets). For the 1998 regular-season opener, the team switched back to gold pants, with a more metallic gold rather than the previous beige-matte gold of the past. The striping along the side of the pants remained black-cardinal red-black, though a thin gold trimming was added, along with further oval \"SF\" logos placed on both sides of the hip.\nThe 1996 helmet and jersey design with the 1998 gold pants was worn as the team's regular uniforms until the end of the 2008 season. The 49ers once again changed uniforms in 2009, which are very similar to the classic design, albeit with several significant changes. The sleeve stripes are now set at an angle to accommodate the even shorter sleeves of modern jerseys, (though the stripes appear straight and parallel to the ground when worn by the players themselves). An updated 49ers uniform with improved fit, and more breathable and moisture-resistant fabrics was debuted (alongside the rest of the NFL teams) by new league uniform manufacturer Nike on April 3, 2012.\nOn April 30, 2015, at their NFL draft rally, the team unveiled their first ever alternate uniform (as opposed to a throwback design). The uniform consists of black jerseys and pants with red numerals and striping. Nike logos are in gold, while the standard solid red socks will be worn. These uniforms will be worn a maximum of two games a year, per league rules.\nIn 2018, the 49ers unveiled a new alternate uniform, discarding their all-black alternates in favor of an all-white alternate. It was made in the style of 1994, with the letters and numerals larger and more pronounced shadows. The helmets were the solid gold, but were used with the old 49ers logo (no striping and shadows). They wear the uniforms once every season, normally on Alumni Day.\nHowever, the 49ers wore the uniform once on the road, in their week 17 finale at Seattle in 2019. They also lobbied the NFL to wear them in Super Bowl LIV, but the request was denied. The NFL cited that the teams' uniforms with the patch were already being sold.\nIn 2021, the 49ers unveiled a red version of the 1994 throwback uniforms for use in select home games, with the white version now worn exclusively on the road.\nIn 2022, the 49ers unveiled a new version of the uniforms. This included a saloon font and a 3 stripe jersey.\nIn 2025, the 49ers unveiled a \"Rivalries\" uniform, which they would wear for three seasons at home against each of their NFC West opponents. The design is primarily black with saloon-style numbers in red with gold trim, and red stripes. Helmets are also black with gold facemasks and red stripes.\nCulture.\nCheerleaders.\nThe 49ers' official cheerleading squad is called the Gold Rush.\nStarted in the early 1980s, the first squad consisted of 14 dancers.\nIn November 2018, shortly before the start of a game against the Oakland Raiders, a cheerleader for the San Francisco 49ers appeared to kneel during the US national anthem, becoming the first NFL cheerleader to do so. The act of kneeling during the national anthem began with the quarterback Colin Kaepernick to raise awareness about racism and police brutality.\nMascot.\nThe 49ers' official mascot is Sourdough Sam. He wears jersey number 49.\nFans.\n49er fans often take pride in their longstanding devotion to the franchise; given their extensive franchise success dating back into the early 1980s. The fanbase has spanned multiple generations since the Walsh-Montana/Seifert-Young era teams had won them five championships. Their fans are often referred to as the 49er Faithful, Niner Gang, or utilizing the acronym FTTB an abbreviation of Faithful To The Bay. A common chant utilized by the fans in recent years is the chant of \"Bang! Bang! Niner Gang!\" popularized by Bay Area rapper E-40 in 2019.\nRivalries.\nDivisional.\nLos Angeles Rams.\nThe rivalry between the Los Angeles Rams and the San Francisco 49ers is considered by many to be one of the greatest NFL rivalries ever, placing No. 8 on \"Sports Illustrated\"'s \"Top 10 NFL Rivalries of All Time\" list, compiled in 2008. After the Rams moved to St. Louis, Roger Craig stated in \"Tales from the San Francisco 49ers Sideline\" that the Rams would always remain the team's arch-rival, regardless of location. The Rams are the only team to have played the 49ers twice every season for the last 58 seasons to combine for more than 100 regular season games; the all-time regular season lead is held by the 49ers 72\u201367\u20133. The rivalry regained geographic animosity following their return to Los Angeles in 2016. The rivalry has also regrown a fierce element of animosity between fans, coaches, and players alike. The two teams have met twice in the postseason; in the NFC Championship Game. The first meeting came on January 14, 1990, when the 49ers crushed the Rams 30\u20133 at Candlestick Park to advance to the team's historic victory in Super Bowl XXIV. Both teams later met again on January 30, 2022, when the Rams rallied from a 10-point deficit in the fourth quarter to beat the 49ers 20\u201317 at SoFi Stadium, ending a 6-game loss-streak to the 49ers and ultimately proceeding to win Super Bowl LVI. As of 2024, the 49ers lead the all-time series 78-71-3.\nSeattle Seahawks.\nDuring the 2010s, the Seattle Seahawks quickly grew an intense rivalry with 49ers. The two teams began an exchange of heated regular season matchups following the NFL's realignment in 2002 that relocated both teams into the same division. Prior to 2002, the teams played each other almost every season during the pre-season, but only every three years during the regular season as part of the league scheduling algorithm. The rivalry began to intensify after the 49ers hired Jim Harbaugh out of Stanford in 2011, as he and Seahawks and former USC head coach Pete Carroll had been involved in a lengthy feud. The matchups regularly grew in intensity through the 2010s, culminating in the two teams meeting in the 2013 NFC Championship which saw Seattle advance and ultimately on to win Super Bowl XLVIII. As of the 2023 season, the Seahawks lead the all-time series 31\u201323.\nArizona Cardinals.\nThough the 49ers and Cardinals initially met in 1951 and would meet occasionally until 2000, this would not develop into a full-fledged rivalry until both teams were placed in the NFC West division in 2002. Longtime-Quarterback Steve Young suffered a career-ending concussion in a game against the Cardinals on September 27, 1999, after taking a brutal hit from Arizona cornerback Aeneas Williams. While still a close rivalry in wins; it is often lopsided on both ends. After the 49ers won nine of ten meetings between 2009 and 2013, the Cardinals won eight straight meetings between 2014 and 2018. San Francisco currently leads the series 36\u201331.\nThe two teams have yet to meet in the playoffs.\nConference.\nGreen Bay Packers.\nThe Green Bay Packers rivalry emerged in the mid-1990s when the Packers upset the 49ers in the 1995 NFC Divisional game at Candlestick Park, ending any chance of a Super Bowl repeat. From that point, the Packers beat the 49ers four more times including two post-season games. San Francisco was finally able to exact revenge in the 1998 NFC Wild Card round, a game that is remembered for a 25-yard game-winning touchdown reception by Terrell Owens off a Steve Young pass (referred to by some as \"The Catch II\"), lifting the 49ers over the Packers 30\u201327. Since that game, the Packers had beaten the 49ers eight straight times including once in the 2001 post-season, a streak that came to an end in the 2012 season when the 49ers beat the Packers in Lambeau Field week 1 for the first time since 1990, and again in the NFC Divisional game that same season. In the 2019 season the 49ers and Packers met in the 2020 NFC Championship game at Levi's Stadium where the 49ers won 37\u201320, but went on to lose Super Bowl LIV to the Kansas City Chiefs. The Packers also proceeded to lose to the 49ers in the Divisional Round in the 2021\u20132022 season. The 49ers trail the all-time series with a record of 34\u201339\u20131, though San Francisco holds a 6\u20134 lead in the postseason, winning the last five meetings.\nDallas Cowboys.\nThe rivalry between the Dallas Cowboys and the 49ers has lasted since the 1970s. The NFL Top 10 ranked this rivalry to be the tenth best in NFL history. San Francisco has played Dallas in nine postseason games. The Cowboys defeated the 49ers in the 1970 and 1971 NFC championship games, and again in the 1972 Divisional Playoff Game. The 1981 NFC championship game in San Francisco, which saw the 49ers' Joe Montana complete a game-winning pass to Dwight Clark in the final minute (now known as The Catch), is one of the most famous games in NFL history. The rivalry became even more intense during the 1992\u20131994 seasons. San Francisco and Dallas faced each other in the NFC championship game three separate times. Dallas won the first two match-ups, and San Francisco won the third. In each of these pivotal match-ups, the game's victor went on to win the Super Bowl. Both the Cowboys and the 49ers are third all-time in Super Bowl victories to the Pittsburgh Steelers and New England Patriots with five each. The 49ers\u2013Cowboys rivalry is also part of the larger cultural rivalry between California and Texas. In recent years, this once-great rivalry has greatly softened, with the struggles of both the Cowboys and 49ers. However, in its prime especially in the 1990s, this rivalry was a very bitter one as both teams were the class of the NFL during this time. In what was believed to be the greatest upset in the team's rivalry in the modern era, the 49ers upset the Cowboys in the 2021 Wild Card Round.\nThe 2022 49ers would go on to continue their winning streak against the Cowboys winning the divisional round game 19\u201312. The Cowboys' loss to the 49ers was their seventh straight in the divisional round, which is the longest streak in the second round of the NFL playoffs. In Week 5 of 2023\u201324 season, the 49ers beat the Cowboys 42\u201310, making it the largest win margin for the 49ers in the history of the rivalry. The 49ers lead the all-time series at 21-19-1, although they trail the Cowboys 4\u20135 in the playoffs.\nNew York Giants.\nThe New York Giants have the most playoff meetings versus the 49ers (eight). The playoff series is currently tied at four wins a piece, and in five of their eight meetings, the winning team has gone on to win the Super Bowl. This rivalry is rooted in the 1980s when both teams were on the rise. In the first two playoff meetings between these two teams, the Joe Montana-led 49ers won both meetings, 38\u201324 in 1981 and 21\u201310 in 1984 both in the divisional round at Candlestick Park; the 49ers went on to win their first two Super Bowl championships both seasons. The Giants won the next three playoff meetings, which included a 49\u20133 rout at Giants Stadium in 1986, and the 1990 NFC championship, where they upset the 49ers 15\u201313, ruining the 49ers hopes of a Super Bowl three-peat after Roger Craig lost a fumble late in the fourth quarter and let the Giants score on a last-second field goal. Giants also went on to win their first two Super Bowl championships both seasons. The 49ers defeated the Giants 44\u20133 in 1993 in the divisional round. In the 2002 NFC wildcard game, the Giants were ahead 38\u201314 late in the third quarter; however, the 49ers came back from the 24-point deficit to beat the Giants with a 39\u201338 victory. The teams met again in the 2011 NFC championship at Candlestick Park, and just like the 1990 NFC championship, it was a low-scoring game; the Giants won the game on a Lawrence Tynes 31-yard field goal in overtime, 20\u201317. In an eerie similarity to Roger Craig's fumble 21 years earlier, Kyle Williams fumbled a punt in the crucial minutes of the game, and just like the last two times, the Giants beat the 49ers in the playoffs, they went on to win the Super Bowl. San Francisco leads the all-time series 22\u201321.\nHistoric.\nAtlanta Falcons.\nThe Atlanta Falcons were also division rivals with the 49ers until the Falcons moved to the NFC South in 2002 after the realignment. Just like the Saints, the 49ers had dominated the Falcons when they played in the NFC West, but the Falcons won their first four games (spanning nine seasons) against the 49ers since moving to the NFC South. Both teams met in the divisional round of the 1998 playoffs. Garrison Hearst suffered an ankle break after his foot was caught in the Georgia Dome turf and twisted severely as he tried to spin away from Falcons' defensive end Chuck Smith on the first play from scrimmage; the 49ers lost that game 20\u201318. They met in the 2012 NFC championship, in which the 49ers, led by quarterback Colin Kaepernick, defeated the top-seeded Falcons in Atlanta by a score of 28\u201324. The next year, the Falcons played against the 49ers in the final home game at Candlestick Park ever. The game ended in a dramatic interception return for a touchdown by 49ers linebacker NaVorro Bowman, known as \"The Pick at the 'Stick\". The 49ers maintain an overall 48\u201333\u20131 against the Falcons, but are tied 1\u20131 in the postseason.\nOakland Raiders.\nThe Oakland Raiders were the 49ers' geographic rivals when the Raiders were located in Oakland. As a result, games between the two were referred to as the \"Battle of the Bay\". The first exhibition game played in 1967, ended with the NFL 49ers defeating the AFL Raiders 13\u201310. After the 1970 merger, the 49ers won in Oakland 38\u20137. The rivalry still remained heated when the Raiders moved to Los Angeles, leaving many Raider fans in Northern California bitter over the move, and some of them becoming 49er fans, added with the antagonism between Northern and Southern California. The Raiders notably upset the defending Super Bowl champion 49ers in San Francisco in 1982, winning 23\u201317. In addition, both teams have shared a number of players, most notably Jim Plunkett, Jerry Rice, Ronnie Lott, Michael Crabtree, Tom Rathman, and Charlie Garner.\nOn August 20, 2011, in the third week of the pre-season, the pre-season game between the rivals was marked by fights in restrooms and stands at Candlestick Park including a shooting outside the stadium in which several were injured. The NFL decided to cancel all future pre-season games between the Raiders and 49ers. The final regular season matchup of the \"Battle of the Bay\" was won by San Francisco by a score of 34\u20133 on November 1, 2018, leaving the series tied 7\u20137. In 2020, the Raiders began playing their home games at Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas, effectively ending the geographic rivalry. The San Francisco 49ers would meet with the Raiders for the first time in Las Vegas on January 1, 2023. The 49ers would take a slim overtime win in with a field goal ending the game 37\u201334. The 49ers lead the all-time series 8\u20137.\nCleveland Browns.\nIn the AAFC, the only other competitive team other than the 49ers was the Cleveland Browns, who they played twice each of the four years the league was in service; Cleveland lost four games in the AAFC, and San Francisco was responsible for two of them, including the one that broke a 29-game streak where Cleveland did not lose a game. The final game in AAFC history matched the two for the AAFC Championship, which Cleveland won 21\u20137. The rivalry did not last into the NFL years, particularly after the teams were placed in opposite conferences in 1970. The rivalry has turned into a friendly relationship as many 49ers personnel helped the Browns relaunch in 1999, specifically former 49ers president and CEO Carmen Policy and vice president/director of football operations Dwight Clark, who were hired by the expansion Browns in the same roles. In addition, 49ers owners John York and Denise DeBartolo York reside in Youngstown, southeast of Cleveland. Long-time Browns placekicker and fan favorite Phil Dawson and backup quarterback Colt McCoy signed with the 49ers in 2014. The Browns currently lead the all-time series 20\u201310.\nSeason-by-season records.\nThis is a partial list of the 49ers' last five completed seasons. For the full season-by-season franchise results, see List of San Francisco 49ers seasons.\nPlayers of note.\n49ers Hall of Fame.\nThe Edward J. DeBartolo Sr. 49ers Hall of Fame is the team's official hall of honor for the franchise's greatest players and contributors.\nForty-Niner 10-year club.\nThe 10-year club is a shrine that honors members of the San Francisco 49ers who played 10 or more seasons with the organization, and was started by Bill Walsh to recognize players that have shown longevity, success and consistency. Each member is shown in a black-and-white photo on a scarlet and gold plaque with their name under the photo and the years in which they played. A plaque placed in the center of the photos of club members reads:\n\"Forty-Niners 10-year club. Dedicated to those Forty-Niners who have served 10 or more years proudly wearing the scarlet and gold.\"\nBold indicates those elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAchievements.\nIndividual awards.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\nrole=\"presentation\" class=\"wikitable succession-box noprint\" style=\"margin:0.5em auto; font-size:small;clear:both;\""}
{"id": "27170", "revid": "37371155", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27170", "title": "Los Angeles Chargers", "text": "National Football League team in Inglewood, California\nThe Los Angeles Chargers are a professional American football team based in the Greater Los Angeles area. The Chargers compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member of the American Football Conference (AFC) West division. The team plays its home games at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California, which it shares with the Los Angeles Rams.\nThe Chargers were founded in Los Angeles in 1959, and began play in 1960 as a charter member of the American Football League (AFL). They spent their first season in Los Angeles before moving to San Diego in 1961 to become the San Diego Chargers. The team joined the NFL as a result of the AFL\u2013NFL merger in 1970. In 2017, the Chargers moved back to Los Angeles after 56 seasons in San Diego, a year after the Rams had moved back to the city after spending 21 seasons (1995\u20132015) in St. Louis. The team previously played at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum during their first stint in Los Angeles, Balboa Stadium and San Diego Stadium (also known as Jack Murphy Stadium and Qualcomm Stadium) while in San Diego, and Dignity Health Sports Park (formerly named StubHub Center) from 2017 to 2019, while SoFi Stadium was under construction.\nThe Chargers won the AFL championship in 1963, and reached the AFL playoffs five times and the AFL Championship game four times before joining the NFL. Since then, the Chargers have made 15 trips to the playoffs and made four appearances in the AFC Championship game. In 1994, the Chargers won their first and only AFC championship, and faced the San Francisco 49ers in Super Bowl XXIX, losing 49\u201326. The Chargers have nine players and two coaches enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame: wide receiver Lance Alworth (1962\u20131970), defensive end Fred Dean (1975\u20131981), quarterback Dan Fouts (1973\u20131987), head coach and general manager Sid Gillman (1960\u20131969, 1971), wide receiver Charlie Joiner (1976\u20131986), offensive tackle Ron Mix (1960\u20131969), tight end Kellen Winslow (1979\u20131987), middle linebacker Junior Seau (1990\u20132002), running back LaDainian Tomlinson (2001\u20132009), head coach Don Coryell (1978\u20131986), and tight end Antonio Gates (2003\u20132018).\nAccording to an article in \"Forbes\", the Los Angeles Chargers were worth 5.1 billion dollars in August 2024, putting them at number 20 on the list of the most valuable NFL teams.\nHistory.\nFirst season in Los Angeles (1960).\nThe Chargers were established with seven other American Football League teams in 1959. They began AFL play in Los Angeles the following year in 1960. The Chargers' original owner was hotel heir Barron Hilton, son of Hilton Hotels founder Conrad Hilton. According to the official website of the Pro Football Hall of Fame, Barron Hilton agreed after his general manager, Frank Leahy, picked the Chargers name when he purchased an AFL franchise for Los Angeles: \"I liked it because they were yelling \u2018charge\u2019 and sounding the bugle at Dodger Stadium and at USC games.\"\nSan Diego (1961\u20132016).\nIn December 1960, the Chargers considered a move to Atlanta or Seattle, but ultimately moved to San Diego\u2019s Balboa Stadium in January 1961, due to financial losses in Los Angeles. The city upgraded the stadium, increasing its seating capacity to 34,000. The Chargers\u2019 defense was strong, recording forty-nine interceptions in their first season in San Diego. They won the AFL title against the Boston Patriots in 1963, but lost in the 1964 and 1965 championships to the Buffalo Bills.\nIn the late 1960s, the Chargers faced ownership changes and financial difficulties. In 1966, Hilton sold the team to a group of executives, including Eugene V. Klein and Sam Schulman. The team moved to San Diego Stadium in 1967 and continued to perform well, though not winning any championships. By 1970, they joined the NFL after the AFL-NFL merger. The team struggled in the early 1970s, with coaching changes and a decline in performance, finishing with a 2\u201311\u20131 record in 1973.\nThe Chargers hired Don Coryell as head coach in 1978, introducing the \"Air Coryell\" offense, a pass-heavy strategy that revitalized the team's performance. With quarterback Dan Fouts, the Chargers led the league in passing yards from 1978 to 1983 and again in 1985. The team made four consecutive playoff appearances from 1979 to 1982, winning three AFC West division titles. Despite regular-season success, the Chargers faced challenges in the playoffs, including the \"Epic in Miami\" game in 1981.\nThe 1990s brought further changes, including the hiring of Bobby Ross as head coach in 1992. The Chargers won the AFC West title in 1992 and reached the Super Bowl for the first time in 1994, losing to the San Francisco 49ers 49\u201326.\nMarty Schottenheimer was named as Chargers head coach before the 2002 season. He led the team to an 8\u20138 record in his first season at the helm. The team dropped to a 4\u201312 mark in the 2003 season. The Chargers drafted Eli Manning with the first overall pick in the 2004 NFL Draft. However, Manning did not want to play for the Chargers resulting in a trade with the Giants for quarterback Philip Rivers, who was their first round pick. The Chargers improved to a 12\u20134 record in the 2004 season. They won the AFC West. Their stint in the postseason was short as they dropped the Wild Card Round to the Jets. The Chargers went 9\u20137 but missed the postseason in the 2005 season. Rivers took over as starting quarterback in the 2006 season. Rivers went on to be the franchise quarterback for the Chargers. In the 2006 season, the Chargers won the division and went 14\u20132, the best record in franchise history. The team was eliminated in the Divisional Round by the New England Patriots. Despite the historic season for the Chargers, the team fired Schottenheimer.\nBefore the 2007 season, the Chargers named Norv Turner as head coach. In his first season at the helm, Turner led the Chargers to an AFC West title. The team defeated the Titans in the Wild Card Round and the Colts in the Divisional Round before falling to the Patriots in the AFC Championship. The team regressed to an 8\u20138 record in the 2008 season. However, they still won the division. They defeated the Colts in the Wild Card Round before falling to the Steelers in the Divisional Round. In the 2009 season, the Chargers went 13\u20133 and won the division again. The success was short lived in the postseason with a 17\u201314 loss in the Divisional Round to the Jets. In the 2010 season, the Chargers went 9\u20137 but missed the postseason for the first time under Turner. Five of the Chargers' seven losses were within one possession. In the 2011 season, the team went 8\u20138 and missed the postseason. In the 2012 season, the team went 7\u20139, missed the postseason, and fired Turner after the season.\nBefore the 2013 season, the Chargers hired Mike McCoy to be their new head coach. In the 2013 season, the Chargers went 9\u20137 and made the playoffs despite a 3rd-place finish in the AFC West. The Chargers defeated the Cincinnati Bengals 27\u201310 in the Wild Card Round before falling to the Denver Broncos 24\u201317 in the Divisional Round. In the 2014 season, the Chargers went 9\u20137 again but missed the postseason. In the 2015 season, the Chargers went 4\u201312. In the 2016 season, the Chargers went 5\u201311 and missed the post season for the third consecutive season. The team parted ways with Mike McCoy as head coach after the season. In 2017, the Chargers moved back to Los Angeles.\nReturn to Los Angeles (2017\u2013present).\nChargers owner Dean Spanos announced the move in a letter to the city of San Diego posted to the team's official site on January 12, 2017. The team, which would pay the NFL a $645 million relocation fee announced it would be returning to their birthplace in Los Angeles starting with the 2017 season at Dignity Health Sports Park in Carson, California, despite the stadium's 30,000 seating capacity being well below the 50,000 minimum that the NFL set for temporary homes. The home of Major League Soccer's LA Galaxy served as the Chargers' temporary home field until they joined the Rams at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood starting with the 2020 NFL season. The Chargers became the second former San Diego professional sports franchise to move to Los Angeles, after the Clippers in 1984.\nOne week after the move from San Diego to Los Angeles was announced, ESPN's Adam Schefter reported that the other NFL owners were \"angered\" by the decision, and that \"the NFL wants the Chargers to move back, though nobody believes that possibility is realistic.\"\nAnthony Lynn years (2017\u20132020).\nOn January 13, the Chargers fired defensive coordinator John Pagano. It took the team one week to find a replacement for Pagano, as they hired Gus Bradley on January 20. Bradley was formerly the head coach for the Jacksonville Jaguars, and before landing that head coaching job was the defensive coordinator for the Seattle Seahawks. The Chargers also announced they had hired Anthony Lynn to be their next head coach.\nIn their first game back in Los Angeles at StubHub Center included an announced attendance was just over 25,000, divided \"around 50/50\" between fans of the Chargers and the visiting Miami Dolphins. After the poor response, the NFL was reportedly considering ways to move the Chargers back to San Diego, although that possibility was considered unlikely. The league officially denied that such discussions were happening, as San Diego was stated not to have a usable stadium and that the Spanos family refuses to consider going back to the city; the league did acknowledge that a vote of the owners could change the situation. The team had a 9\u20137 record, but missed the playoffs for the fourth consecutive time.\nAfter a 12\u20134 regular season record, the Chargers qualified for the 2018 playoffs. The team defeated the Baltimore Ravens in the Wild Card round, but lost to the eventual Super Bowl champion New England Patriots in the Divisional round. However, Chargers' attendance problems continued into their second season. For instance, there were so many fans of the visiting Kansas City Chiefs at the Chargers' 2018 home opener that \"USA Today\" remarked it \"was essentially a Chiefs home game\". In December 2018, a \"Los Angeles Times\" columnist asked if the Chargers would receive a parade in the city if they were to win the Super Bowl.\nThe team's struggles to draw fans reportedly led them to lower their initial revenue goal when they moved into the new stadium from $400 million to $150 million, and caused some owners to doubt the Chargers' viability in Los Angeles. Beyond low attendance, the Chargers receive only 18.75% of season ticket revenues through 2040, contributing to the reduced goal.\nIn the 2019 season, the Chargers had a poor 5\u201311 record, and were swept by their division. Rivers entered free agency and ended his long tenure as the Chargers' starting quarterback.\nOn September 13, 2020, Tyrod Taylor became the starting quarterback for the Chargers and the first new quarterback to start since Philip Rivers' starting debut on December 31, 2005. He led them to win 16\u201313 due to a missed field goal by the Bengals. On September 20, 2020, Taylor suffered a punctured lung while receiving a pain-killing injection, forcing rookie quarterback Justin Herbert to start. Herbert led the team to a narrow loss against the Chiefs, 23\u201320, in his first start. In week 13, the Chargers lost to the Patriots, 45\u20130, in the worst blowout loss in team history. The season concluded in a 38\u201321 win over the Chiefs. Justin Herbert broke multiple rookie records throughout the season, but despite his record-breaking season, the Chargers finished the season with a 7\u20139 record. At the conclusion of the 2020 season, the organization announced that Lynn was fired as head coach.\nBrandon Staley years (2021\u20132023).\nThe Chargers signed Rams defensive coordinator Brandon Staley to become their new head coach on January 17, 2021. Brandon Staley brought in Saints quarterbacks coach Joe Lombardi, grandson of Vince Lombardi, as the new offensive coordinator, and Renaldo Hill, Broncos defensive backs coach, as their new defensive coordinator.\nIn the 2021 season, the Chargers' record improved to 9\u20138 (with an extra 17th game added to the NFL regular season). Herbert broke numerous sophomore year records, but despite his and the rest of the team's efforts, the Chargers missed the playoffs in a week 18 win-or-tie-or-go-home overtime loss to the Raiders.\nOn February 3, 2022, the Chargers hired Vikings special teams coordinator Ryan Ficken. In 2022, the Chargers announced the location of a new headquarters in El Segundo, California. The Chargers finished the 2022 NFL season with a 10\u20137 record and the 5th seed in the AFC. They lost in the Wild Card round of the playoffs to the Jacksonville Jaguars after blowing a 27\u20130 lead in the game. Despite the playoff loss, the Chargers were alleviating their attendance issues, with their average attendance during the 2022 season being in the top third of the league for a second consecutive year.\nOn January 17, 2023, the Chargers fired offensive coordinator Joe Lombardi and quarterbacks coach Shane Day. The Chargers hired former Cowboys offensive coordinator Kellen Moore to be their new offensive coordinator on January 31. Chargers defensive coordinator Renaldo Hill unexpectedly left the team on February 20 to join the Miami Dolphins as their secondary coach and passing game coordinator, with the vacancy being filled by the Chargers defensive backs coach Derrick Ansley on the same day.\nOn December 15, 2023, head coach Brandon Staley and general manager Tom Telesco were fired, one day after a 63\u201321 primetime loss to the Las Vegas Raiders. The Chargers finished the remainder of the season with interim head coach Giff Smith. The Chargers finished out the 2023 with a 5\u201312 record.\nJim Harbaugh (2024\u2013present).\nThe Chargers signed former Michigan football coach Jim Harbaugh on January 24, 2024. Harbaugh served as the coach for the San Francisco 49ers from 2011 to 2014. He went to Super Bowl XLVII with the 49ers where he lost to the Baltimore Ravens. He was the Michigan football coach from 2015 to 2024. There, he had a total record of 86\u201325 while reaching the college football playoffs three times, as well as winning the 2024 National Championship. Before his coaching career, Jim Harbaugh was a quarterback for the Chargers from 1999 to 2000.\nThe Chargers finished the 2024 season with an improved record of 11\u20136, securing the 5th seed in the AFC. They lost to the Houston Texans in the Wild Card round of the 2024\u201325 NFL playoffs.\nLogos and uniforms.\nExcept for color changes along the way, the Chargers have essentially used the logo of an arc-shaped lightning bolt since the team debuted in 1960. During its period in the AFL, the club also used a shield logo that featured a horsehead, a lightning bolt, and the word \"Chargers\". The team brought the logo back for on-field design in the 2018 season.\nFrom 1960 to 1973, the colors consisted of various shades of electric blue (\"powder\" blue, but technically called collegiate blue) or white jerseys, both with gold lightning bolts on the shoulders. The helmets were white and had both the arc-shaped lightning bolt logo, in gold or navy depending on the year, and the player's number. At first, the team wore white pants before switching to gold in 1966. In 1973, the numerals on the blue jerseys changed from white to gold.\nIn 1974, the sky blue was changed to dark royal blue. The helmet was also changed to dark blue and the players' numbers were removed. Additionally, the face masks became yellow, thus making them one of the first teams in the NFL (with the Kansas City Chiefs) to use a facemask color other than the then-predominant grey. From 1978 through 1983, the Chargers wore their white jerseys at home, coinciding with the hiring of coach Don Coryell\u00a0\u2013 when Joe Gibbs, a Coryell assistant in 1979\u201380, became head coach of the Washington Redskins in 1981, he did the same, and white at home became a Redskins staple through 2007 \u2013 but Coryell switched the Chargers to their blue jerseys at home starting in 1984. With the exception of the 1991 season and other sporadic home games since, San Diego wears its blue jerseys at home.\nIn 1985, the Chargers started using navy blue jerseys and returned to wearing white pants. The team's uniform design was next revamped in 1988. It featured an even darker shade of navy blue. The lightning bolts on the jerseys and helmets were white, with navy interior trim and gold outlining; the facemasks became navy blue. In 1990, the team started to wear navy pants with their white jerseys. From 1988 to 1991, the team displayed stripes down the pants rather than lightning bolts. The Chargers went with all-white combinations in 1997 and 2001, only to have the blue pants make a comeback. On October 27, 2003, the Chargers wore their navy pants with their navy jersey for a \"Monday Night Football\" game versus the Miami Dolphins that was played at Sun Devil Stadium, then the home of the Arizona Cardinals, due to wildfires in southern California. This was the only game in which the Chargers had worn the all-dark combination until the uniform change in 2020.\nFrom the late 1980s to 2000, the Chargers wore white at home during some preseason games and dark for regular season games. In 2001, the Chargers started wearing their dark uniforms for preseason games and white uniforms in September home games due to the heat before switching back to dark in October.\nIn 1994, as part of the NFL's 75th season throwback uniform program, the Chargers wore uniforms based on their early 1960s look a total of four times (two each for their road whites and home powder blues). In 2000, the powder blue throwbacks were brought back for a Week 9 matchup against the Raiders, and became a regular alternate uniform worn once or twice a season from 2002 through 2006. Many Chargers fans and NFL fans in general clamored for the return of the powder blues full-time.\nIn 2002, the Chargers scrapped the altogether idea of the helmet side profile being used as the team logo, to unveil what's commonly known simply as the bolt logo among Los Angeles and San Diego. The iconic emblem depicted a white leaping thunder bolt curved in the shape of an arch with a blue and thicker yellow outline; until 2007 when they reverted to the yellow thunderbolt used on the helmets in 1976.\nThe bolt \"sparked\" (pun intended) a playful controversy over whether \"Charger\" refers to a shockwave of lightning, as suggested by the logo, or a charging war horse, the literal definition of one in this sense. While the original logo featured a cavalry stallion, opinions are divided on whether it now implies a thunder bolt due to the change, or if the logo simply evolved into one for looks because Charger horses \"charge\".\nIn March 2007, the Chargers unveiled their first uniform redesign since 1988, on the team's official website. The team formally unveiled this new uniform set, which mixes old and new styles, in a private team-only event. Navy blue remains the primary color on the home jersey, but the familiar lightning bolt was reverted to gold, and now has navy outlining and powder blue interior trim. The latter color is a nod to the 1960s uniforms. The redesigned lightning bolt was moved to the sides of the shoulders from the top, and includes a new numbering font and word mark in white, with gold outlining and powder blue interior trim. The pants also have a redesigned lightning bolt in gold, with powder blue trim on a navy stripe. Additionally, the team pays tribute to other uniform features from their history by wearing a metallic white helmet, with a navy face mask, the newly revamped bolt in gold with navy and powder blue trim, and white pants. The road white jerseys with navy pants, as well as the alternate powder blue jerseys with white pants, were also redesigned with the new scheme.\nFrom 2007 to 2018, the Chargers wore the alternate powder blue jerseys twice per season. The alternate powder blue jerseys were also worn in a playoff game against the Indianapolis Colts in 2008.\nIn 2009, in honor of their 50th anniversary as one of the eight original AFL teams, the Chargers once again wore their 1963 throwback uniforms for three games, wearing their powder blues on the road in Oakland and at home against Denver, and their white uniforms in Kansas City.\nFor the 2013 season, the Chargers made minor tweaks to their current uniforms. These include a two-tone nameplate (gold with powder blue trim on home jersey, navy with gold trim on away jersey, and white with navy trim on alternate jersey), collars matching the color of the jersey, and the addition of a gold stripe on the socks.\nOn January 12, 2017, with the announcement that the Chargers were moving to Los Angeles, the team unveiled a new alternate logo incorporating the letters \"LA\" with a lightning bolt shooting through the crossbar of the A. The logo was immediately and widely criticized for its resemblance to the Los Angeles Dodgers logo. The team tried to defuse the controversy by changing the color scheme of the new logo before scrapping it altogether after two days.\nThe team officially announced on April 16, 2019, that it would wear its powder blue jerseys, the same uniforms they wore during their inaugural season in 1960 while in Los Angeles, as its primary home uniform beginning with the 2019 NFL season. The club also announced that the facemask color would change from navy blue to gold, which was previously worn when the team wore its royal blue NFL Color Rush uniforms.\nOn March 24, 2020, the team announced new logos and upcoming new uniforms for the team. Navy blue was no longer a Chargers-used color and was removed from all logos and clothes. The Chargers unveiled a new variation of the thunderbolt with only a powder blue outline and faint white outline for visibility on blue backgrounds. The most significant alteration to the thunderbolt was lessening the curve which made the logo less circular-looking as it looked to many, and rather leaping across something. The Chargers debuted a new script logo featuring powder blue and gold and lightning bolt shooting from the A in Chargers. On April 21, 2020, the team unveiled their new uniforms. Powder blue returned as the primary color. The shoulder bolts were repositioned to go over the shoulders again, in gold with a simple outline contrasting with the jersey's color. TV numbers were removed from the sleeves and placed on the helmets, which remained white with gold bolts outlined in powder blue. Pants options included white with gold bolts or gold with white bolts. The royal blue and navy alternate uniforms were also updated to the new template, with the navy uniform now featuring navy bolts outlined in gold on the helmet, jersey, and pants. For the 2024 season, the Chargers shelved the royal alternates, wearing the navy set just once.\nOn July 15, 2025, the Chargers unveiled an updated version of their all-navy alternate uniform reflecting that of the San Diego/1992 era. Nicknamed the \"Super Chargers\" uniform, this set featured numbers and stylized thunderbolts in white with navy and gold trim, as well as a new navy helmet which paid homage to the navy helmets they wore from 1985 to 2006. They also unveiled an all-gold alternate uniform, nicknamed the \"Charger Power\" uniform, which mirrors the build of their primary white and powder blue uniforms. These are paired with either powder blue or gold socks. In addition, the Chargers added a powder blue pants option which can be worn with either the white or powder blue jersey.\nFollowing the release of the alternate uniforms and pants combinations, the standard uniform combinations would be powder blue-on-yellow at home and white on white as the visitors.\nRivalries.\nOakland/Los Angeles/Las Vegas Raiders.\nThe Chargers\u2013Raiders rivalry dates to the 1963 season, when the Raiders defeated the heavily favored Chargers twice, both come-from-behind fourth quarter victories. One of the most memorable games between these teams was the \"Holy Roller\" game in 1978, in which the Raiders intentionally fumbled in order to score a touchdown. This somewhat controversial play resulted in a rule change the following season. On November 22, 1982, the Raiders hosted their first Monday Night football game in Los Angeles against the Chargers. The Chargers led the game in the 1st half 24\u20130 until the Raiders scored 28 unanswered points in the second half to win 28\u201324. On January 10, 2022, the Raiders defeated the Chargers in overtime, 35\u201332. The winning field goal was unnecessary for the Raiders' playoff chances, and if the game had ended in a tie, both teams would have made the playoffs. With the field goal, the Chargers were eliminated. The Raiders lead the series 69\u201360\u20132 as of the end of the 2024 season, including having won the only playoff game between the two teams, the 1980 AFC Championship game.\nLos Angeles Rams.\nInitially, the Los Angeles Raiders and Rams were considered to be competing in the \"Battle of Los Angeles\" during the Raiders' tenure in Los Angeles from 1982 to 1994. However, the rivalry ended as the Rams moved to St. Louis and the Raiders returned to Oakland in the mid-1990s. The Raiders unsuccessfully attempted to move back to Los Angeles in 2015 after a failed joint stadium project with the then-San Diego Chargers. The intercity rivalry was revived only with the Chargers' move from San Diego in 2017, following the Rams' return to Los Angeles in 2016. Hostility erupted between the two clubs during a 2017 joint scrimmage at the Rams' training camp in Irvine, California. Rams cornerback Nickell Robey-Coleman and Chargers receiver Keenan Allen initiated an altercation and multiple players rushed into the skirmish, creating an uproar from the crowd. After the hiring of coach Sean McVay in 2017, the Rams managed to win back-to-back division titles, including an appearance in Super Bowl LIII during McVay's second season as head coach. The Chargers experienced their own playoff success by boasting a 12\u20134 record in 2018 and making an appearance in the 2018 AFC divisional round but lost to the New England Patriots. The Rams won the first regular season matchup in Los Angeles between the two teams in Week 3 of the 2018 season. The Chargers would win the next meeting in Week 17 of the 2022 season, the first matchup between the two teams at their new stadium. As of the 2023 season, the Rams lead the all-time series 7\u20136.\nThe Chargers and Rams do have an extensive history of playing each other in the preseason, going back to the first AFL-NFL interleague preseason games in 1967. Until the Rams' departure to St. Louis, the Chargers and Rams played in the preseason all but four years (1975, 1976, 1985, and 1989) in that period. The preseason series continued with the Rams in St. Louis through 2008, playing nine times out of fourteen seasons. The teams would not meet in the preseason again until 2017, when both teams were back in Los Angeles, and would resume the preseason series annually in 2021 (with the 2020 game, along with all preseason games, being cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic).\nKansas City Chiefs.\nAs of the 2024 season, the Kansas City Chiefs lead 70\u201358\u20131, but the Chargers won the only playoff meeting between the two teams, a 1992 AFC wild card game.\nDenver Broncos.\nBroncos lead 75\u201355\u20131 as of the end of the 2024 season, including having won the only playoff meeting between the two teams, a 2013 AFC Divisional game.\nSeason-by-season record.\nThe table below shows the five most recent NFL regular season records along with their respective finish in the NFL playoffs. The Los Angeles Chargers appeared in the postseason twice in the five last seasons. Recent notable honors with current members of the Los Angeles Chargers include NFL Rookie of the Year in 2016 for Joey Bosa (Defensive) and in 2020 for Justin Herbert (Offensive) along with NFL Comeback Player of the Year for Keenan Allen in 2017.\n\"Note: GP = Games played, W = Wins, L = Losses, W\u2013L% = Winning percentage\"\nPlayers of note.\nRetired numbers.\nThe Chargers currently have six retired numbers: #14 of Dan Fouts, #18 of Charlie Joiner, #19 of Lance Alworth, #21 of LaDainian Tomlinson, #55 of Junior Seau and #80 of Kellen Winslow. As of 2010, the Chargers' policy was to have the Chargers Hall of Fame committee evaluate candidates for a player's number to retire after the player has retired from the league after five years, Seau was the only exception to this policy. The committee consists of Chargers Executive Vice President Alex Spanos, Chargers public relations director Bill Johnston, San Diego Hall of Champions founder Bob Breitbard, and the presidents of the San Diego Sports Commission and the Chargers Backers Fan Club. There are few recognized guidelines in sports regarding retiring numbers, and the NFL has no specific league policy. \"You have to have enough numbers for players to wear\", said NFL spokesman Greg Aiello. The Chargers have rarely retired numbers. The \"San Diego Union-Tribune\" wrote, \"The [Chargers] tend to honor their heritage haphazardly.\"\nChargers Hall of Fame.\nThe Chargers created their Hall of Fame in 1976. The members of the Hall of Fame are honored at the Chargers Ring of Honor, founded in 2000 and viewable above the visiting team's sideline of Qualcomm Stadium on the press level. Eligible candidates must have been retired for at least four seasons. Selections are made by a five-member committee chaired by Dean Spanos, Chargers vice-chairman. As of 1992[ [update]], other committee members included Bob Breitbard, founder of the San Diego Hall of Champions; Ron Fowler, president of the Greater San Diego Sports Association; Jane Rappoport, president of the Charger Backers; and Bill Johnston, the team's director of public relations. The Chargers in 2012 allowed fans to vote for the newest member.\n50th Anniversary Team.\nThe Chargers announced their 50th Anniversary Team in 2009 to honor the top players and coaches in the team's history. The Chargers were founded in 1959. The team included 53 players and coaches selected from 103 nominees. The Chargers originally stated that only 50 members would be selected. Online voting by fans accounted for 50% of the voting results; votes from Chargers Hall of Famers and five members of the local media made up for the other 50%. Over 400,000\u00a0votes were cast online. Dan Fouts and LaDainian Tomlinson received the first and second most votes, respectively. The team features 7 Pro Football Hall of Fame members and 11 players that were active on the 2009 Chargers team.\nSan Diego Hall of Champions.\nAlworth, Mix, Hadl, Joiner, Coryell, Gillman, Garrison, Fouts, White, Winslow, Faison, Benirschke, Lincoln, Washington, Humphries, Ladd and Wilkerson are also members of the San Diego Hall of Champions, which is open to athletes from the San Diego area as well as those who played for San Diego-based professional and collegiate teams.\nRadio and television.\nThe Chargers' flagship radio station is KYSR-FM Alt 98.7 in Los Angeles, with daily coverage and special programming on KLAC-AM 570 LA Sports Play-by-play voice Matt \"Money\" Smith &amp; NFL Network analyst Daniel Jeremiah comprise the broadcast team. KYSR-FM's iHeartMedia Los Angeles sister-station KFI AM 640 served as the previous flagship station for the team since the Chargers\u2019 return to Los Angeles from 2017 to 2019. Past Chargers radio broadcasters have included Josh Lewin, Ralph Lawler, Stu Nahan, Tom Kelly, Lee \"Hacksaw\" Hamilton, Dan Rowe, Ted Leitner, and Hank Bauer. Bauer served seventeen seasons (1998\u20132014) as the radio color analyst; however, the Chargers and then-flagship KIOZ decided not to renew his contract, and was replaced by Conway starting with the 2015 season. As of 2014, the Chargers also stream their radio broadcasts on their official mobile application (through iOS and Android devices) as well as on their website.\nAs of the 2020 season, Chargers preseason games will be broadcast by KCBS-TV; likewise, in the former San Diego market, KFMB is the local affiliate. As per the NFL's television deals, KCBS also broadcasts CBS coverage of most Chargers regular season games against AFC teams.\nDennis Packer, the public address announcer of all USC football games at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, serves as the public address announcer of all Chargers home games at SoFi Stadium. Packer replaced legendary P.A. announcer Bruce Binkowski, who went on to become the executive director of the Holiday and Poinsettia Bowl games, which were played at their former home, now-defunct SDCCU Stadium. The Holiday Bowl's being played in 2020 &amp; 2021 at Dignity Health Sports Park and will return to Snapdragon Stadium in 2022. Poinsettia Bowl went defunct in 2016.\nWith the Chargers' return to Los Angeles in 2017, the team became a beneficiary of league scheduling policies. Both the Chargers and the Los Angeles Rams share the Los Angeles market, which is on the West Coast of the United States. This means that the Chargers cannot play home games, road division games against the Denver Broncos or Las Vegas Raiders, or interconference road games against the NFC West (in seasons that the AFC West and NFC West meet in interconference play) in the early 10:00\u00a0a.m. Pacific time slot. In addition, they cannot play interconference home games at the same time or network as the Rams. As a result, both teams generally will have more limited scheduling options, and will also benefit by receiving more prime-time games than usual (click here for further information). Thus, regardless of the previous season's record, the Chargers will receive a disproportionate number of \"Sunday Night\", \"Monday Night\" and/or \"Thursday Night\" games, compared to the rest of the league. Additionally, if the Chargers and Rams are both playing at the same time on Sunday afternoons on a certain network (for instance, a Rams road game against an AFC opponent at the same time as a Charger home game with an NFC opponent with both on Fox, or the reverse where the Rams are on the road against an AFC opponent and the Chargers are at home against an AFC opponent on CBS), in the Los Angeles market, Fox and CBS have authorization to carry the extra game on their secondary sister stations; Fox games air on KCOP-TV, while CBS games are aired on KCAL-TV. In 2020, the Chargers signed a multi-year preseason TV deal with KCBS-TV and KCAL-TV and will have a weekly show with the latest team news, replacing KABC-TV after three seasons (2017, 2018 and 2019) of televising Chargers preseason football.\nTheme song.\nThe Chargers' fight song, \"San Diego Super Chargers\", was recorded in 1979 at the height of the team's success with Air Coryell, and has a distinctly disco sound. The team under then-new owner Alex Spanos replaced the song in 1989 with a non-disco cover version, but the original version was revived in 2002. The team played this song at home games after Chargers scores and victories until they departed San Diego.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\nrole=\"presentation\" class=\"wikitable succession-box noprint\" style=\"margin:0.5em auto; font-size:small;clear:both;\""}

Its name in English is \"ess\" (pronounced ), plural \"esses\".\nHistory.\nNorthwest Semitic \u0161\u00een represented a voiceless postalveolar fricative (as in 'ship'). It originated most likely as a pictogram of a tooth () and represented the phoneme via the acrophonic principle.\nAncient Greek did not have a \"sh\" phoneme, so the derived Greek letter Sigma () came to represent the voiceless alveolar sibilant . While the letter shape \u03a3 continues Phoenician \"\u0161\u00een\", its name \"sigma\" is taken from the letter \"Samekh\", while the shape and position of \"samekh\" but name of \"\u0161\u00een\" is continued in the \"xi\". Within Greek, the name of \"sigma\" was influenced by its association with the Greek word (earlier ), \"to hiss\". The original name of the letter \"Sigma\" may have been \"san\", but due to the early history of the Greek epichoric alphabets, \"san\" came to be identified as a separate letter, \u03fa. Herodotus reported that \"san\" was the name given by the Dorians to the same letter called \"Sigma\" by the Ionians.\nThe Western Greek alphabet used in Cumae was adopted by the Etruscans and Latins in the 7th century BC, and over the following centuries, it developed into a range of Old Italic alphabets, including the Etruscan alphabet and the early Latin alphabet. In Etruscan, the value of Greek sigma (\ud800\udf14) was maintained, while san (\ud800\udf11) represented a separate phoneme, most likely \"sh\" (transliterated as \"\u015b\"). The early Latin alphabet adopted sigma, but not san, as Old Latin did not have a \"sh\" phoneme.\nThe shape of Latin S arises from Greek \u03a3 by dropping one out of the four strokes of that letter. The (angular) S-shape composed of three strokes existed as a variant of the four-stroke letter \u03a3 already in the epigraphy of Western Greek alphabets, and the three and four strokes variants existed alongside one another in the classical Etruscan alphabet. In other Italic alphabets (Venetic, Lepontic), the letter could be represented as a zig-zagging line of any number between three and six strokes. The Italic letter was also adopted into Elder Futhark, as \"Sowil\u014d\" (\u16ca), and appears with four to eight strokes in the earliest runic inscriptions, but is occasionally reduced to three strokes (\u16cb) from the later 5th century, and appears regularly with three strokes in Younger Futhark.\nThe \u27e8sh\u27e9 digraph for English arose in Middle English (alongside \u27e8sch\u27e9), replacing the Old English \u27e8sc\u27e9 digraph. Similarly, Old High German \u27e8sc\u27e9 was replaced by \u27e8sch\u27e9 in Early Modern High German orthography.\nLong s.\nThe minuscule form \u017f, called the long \"s\", developed in the early medieval period, within the Visigothic and Carolingian hands, with predecessors in the half-uncial and cursive scripts of Late Antiquity. It remained standard in western writing throughout the medieval period and was adopted in early printing with movable types. It existed alongside minuscule \"round\" or \"short\" \"s\", which were at the time only used at the end of words.\nIn most Western orthographies, the \u017f gradually fell out of use during the second half of the 18th century, although it remained in occasional use into the 19th century. In Spain, the change was mainly accomplished between 1760 and 1766. In France, the change occurred between 1782 and 1793. Printers in the United States stopped using the long \"s\" between 1795 and 1810. In English orthography, the London printer John Bell (1745\u20131831) pioneered the change. His edition of Shakespeare, in 1785, was advertised with the claim that he \"ventured to depart from the common mode by rejecting the long '\u017f' in favor of the round one, as being less liable to error...\" \"The Times\" of London made the switch from the long to the short \"s\" with its issue of 10 September 1803. \"Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica\"'s 5th edition, completed in 1817, was the last edition to use the long \"s\".\nIn German orthography, long \"s\" was retained in Fraktur (Schwabacher) type as well as in standard cursive (S\u00fctterlin) well into the 20th century, until official use of that typeface was abolished in 1941. The ligature of \"\u017fs\" (or \"\u017fz\") was retained; however, it gave rise to the Eszett \u27e8\u00df\u27e9 in contemporary German orthography.\nUse in writing systems.\nEnglish.\nIn English, \u27e8s\u27e9 represents a voiceless alveolar sibilant . It also commonly represents a voiced alveolar sibilant , as in 'rose' and 'bands'. Due to yod-coalescence, it may also represent a voiceless palato-alveolar fricative , as in 'sugar', or a voiced palato-alveolar fricative , as in 'measure'.\nFinal \u27e8s\u27e9 is the usual mark for plural nouns. It is the regular ending of English third person present tense verbs.\nIn some words of French origin, \u27e8s\u27e9 is silent, as in 'isle' or 'debris'.\nThe letter \u27e8s\u27e9 is the seventh most common letter in English and the third-most common consonant after \u27e8t\u27e9 and \u27e8n\u27e9. It is the most common letter for the first letter of a word in the English language.\nGerman.\nIn German, \u27e8s\u27e9 represents:\nWhen doubled (\u27e8ss\u27e9), it represents a voiceless alveolar sibilant , as in 'm\u00fcssen'.\nIn the trigraph \u27e8sch\u27e9, it represents a voiceless palato-alveolar fricative , as in 'schon'.\nOther languages.\nIn most languages that use the Latin alphabet, \u27e8s\u27e9 represents the voiceless alveolar or voiceless dental sibilant .\nIn many Romance languages, it also represents the voiced alveolar or voiced dental sibilant , as in Portuguese \"mesa\" (table).\nIn Portuguese, it may represent the voiceless palato-alveolar fricative in most dialects when syllable-final, and in European Portuguese \"Isl\u00e3o\" (Islam) or, in many sociolects of Brazilian Portuguese, \"esdr\u00faxulo\" (proparoxytone).\nIn some Andalusian dialects of Spanish, it merged with Peninsular Spanish \u27e8c\u27e9 and \u27e8z\u27e9 and is now pronounced .\nIn Hungarian, it represents .\nIn Turkmen, it represents .\nIn several Western Romance languages, like Spanish and French, the final \u27e8s\u27e9 is the usual mark of plural nouns.\nOther systems.\nIn the International Phonetic Alphabet, \u27e8s\u27e9 represents the voiceless alveolar sibilant .\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "27176", "revid": "15817938", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27176", "title": "Ska", "text": "Music genre\nSka (; , ) is a music genre that originated in Jamaica in the late 1950s and was the precursor to rocksteady and reggae. It combined elements of Caribbean mento and calypso with American jazz and rhythm and blues. Ska is characterized by a walking bass line accented with rhythms on the off beat. It was developed in Jamaica in the 1960s when Stranger Cole, Prince Buster, Clement \"Coxsone\" Dodd, and Duke Reid formed sound systems to play American rhythm and blues and then began recording their own songs. In the early 1960s, ska was the dominant music genre of Jamaica and was popular with British mods and with many skinheads.\nMusic historians typically divide the history of ska into three periods: the original Jamaican scene of the 1960s; the 2 tone ska revival of the late 1970s in Britain, which fused Jamaican ska rhythms and melodies with the faster tempos and harder edge of punk rock forming ska-punk; and third-wave ska, which involved bands from a wide range of countries around the world, in the late 1980s and 1990s.\nEtymology.\nThere are multiple theories about the origins of the word \"ska\". Ernest Ranglin claimed that the term was coined by musicians to refer to the \"skat! skat! skat!\" scratching guitar strum. Another explanation is that at a recording session in 1959 produced by Coxsone Dodd, double bassist Cluett Johnson instructed guitarist Ranglin to \"play like ska, ska, ska\", although Ranglin has denied this, stating \"Clue couldn't tell me what to play!\" A further theory is that it derives from Johnson's word \"skavoovie\", with which he was known to greet his friends. Jackie Mittoo insisted that the musicians called the rhythm \"Staya Staya\", and that it was Byron Lee who introduced the term \"ska\". Derrick Morgan said: \"Guitar and piano making a ska sound, like 'ska, ska\".\nHistory.\nJamaican ska.\nAfter World War II, Jamaicans purchased radios in increasing numbers and were able to hear rhythm and blues music from the Southern United States in cities such as New Orleans by artists such as Fats Domino, Barbie Gaye, Rosco Gordon and Louis Jordan whose early recordings all contain the seeds of the \"behind-the-beat\" feel of ska and reggae. The stationing of American military forces during and after the war meant that Jamaicans could listen to military broadcasts of American music, and there was a constant influx of records from the United States. To meet the demand for that music, entrepreneurs such as Prince Buster, Coxsone Dodd, and Duke Reid formed sound systems.\nAs the supply of previously unheard tunes in the jump blues and more traditional R&amp;B genres began to dry up in the late 1950s, Jamaican producers began recording their own version of the genres with local artists. These recordings were initially made to be played on \"soft wax\" (a lacquer on metal disc acetate later to become known as a \"dub plate\"), but as demand for them grew eventually sometime in the second half of 1959 (believed by most to be in the last quarter) producers such as Coxsone Dodd and Duke Reid began to issue these recordings on 45\u00a0rpm 7-inch discs. At this point, the style was a direct copy of the American \"shuffle blues\" style, but within two or three years it had morphed into the more familiar ska style with the off-beat guitar chop that could be heard in some of the more uptempo late-1950s American rhythm and blues recordings such as Domino's \"Be My Guest\" and Barbie Gaye's \"My Boy Lollypop\", both of which were popular on Jamaican sound systems of the late 1950s. Domino's rhythm, accentuating the offbeat, was a particular influence.\nThis \"classic\" ska style was of bars made up of four triplets but was characterized by a guitar chop on the off beat\u2014known as an upstroke or 'skank'\u2014with horns taking the lead and often following the off-beat skank and piano emphasizing the bass line and, again, playing the skank. Drums kept time and the bass drum was accented on the third beat of each four-triplet phrase. The snare would play side stick and accent the third beat of each 4-triplet phrase. The upstroke sound can also be found in other Caribbean forms of music, such as mento and calypso. Ernest Ranglin asserted that the difference between R&amp;B and ska beats is that the former goes \"\"chink\"-ka\" and the latter goes \"ka-\"chink\"\".\nThe Jamaican ska outfit the Skatalites recorded \"Dynamite\", \"Ringo\" and \"Guns of Navarone\". One theory about the origin of ska is that Prince Buster created it during the inaugural recording session for his new record label Wild Bells. The session was financed by Duke Reid, who was supposed to get half of the songs to release. The guitar began emphasizing the second and fourth beats in the bar, giving rise to the new sound. The drums were taken from traditional Jamaican drumming and marching styles. To create the ska beat, Prince Buster essentially flipped the R&amp;B shuffle beat, stressing the offbeats with the help of the guitar. Prince Buster has explicitly cited American rhythm and blues as the origin of ska: specifically, Willis Jackson's song \"Later for the Gator\" (which was Coxsone Dodd's number one selection).\nThe first ska recordings were created at facilities such as Federal Records, Studio One, and WIRL Records in Kingston, Jamaica with producers such as Dodd, Reid, Prince Buster, and Edward Seaga. The ska sound coincided with the celebratory feelings surrounding Jamaica's independence from the UK in 1962; an event commemorated by songs such as Derrick Morgan's \"Forward March\" and the Skatalites' \"Freedom Sound\".\nUntil Jamaica ratified the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works, the country did not honor international music copyright protection. This created many cover songs and reinterpretations. One such cover was Millie Small's version of the R&amp;B/shuffle tune, \"My Boy Lollypop\", first recorded in New York in 1956 by 14-year-old Barbie Gaye. Small's rhythmically similar version, released in 1964, was Jamaica's first commercially successful international hit. With over seven million copies sold, it remains one of the best selling reggae/ska songs of all time. Many other Jamaican artists would have success recording instrumental ska versions of popular American and British music, such as Beatles songs, Motown and Atlantic soul hits, movie theme songs and instrumentals (007, Guns of Navarone). The Wailers covered the Beatles' \"And I Love Her\", and radically reinterpreted Bob Dylan's \"Like a Rolling Stone\". They also created their own versions of Latin-influenced music from artists such as Mongo Santamar\u00eda. The Skatalites, Lord Creator, Laurel Aitken, Roland Alphonso, Tommy McCook, Jackie Mittoo, Desmond Dekker, and Don Drummond also recorded ska.\nByron Lee &amp; the Dragonaires performed ska with Prince Buster, Eric \"Monty\" Morris, and Jimmy Cliff at the 1964 New York World's Fair. As music changed in the United States, so did ska. In 1965 and 1966, when American soul music became slower and smoother, ska changed its sound accordingly and evolved into rocksteady. However, rocksteady's heyday was brief, peaking in 1967. By 1968, ska evolved again into reggae.\n2 tone.\nThe 2 tone genre, which began in the late 1970s in the Coventry area of UK, was a fusion of Jamaican ska rhythms and melodies with punk rock's more aggressive guitar chords and lyrics. Compared to 1960s ska, 2 tone music had faster tempos, fuller instrumentation, and a harder edge. The genre was named after 2 Tone Records, a record label founded by Jerry Dammers of the Specials. In many cases, the reworking of classic ska songs turned the originals into hits again in the United Kingdom. The Specials recorded \"A Message to You Rudy\" in 1979, featuring Rico Rodriguez, who played trombone on both the original Dandy Livingstone recording and the Specials' version.\nThe 2 tone movement promoted racial unity at a time when racial tensions were high in England. There were many Specials songs that raised awareness of the issues of racism, fighting and friendship. Riots in English cities were a feature during the summer that the Specials song \"Ghost Town\" was a hit, although this work was in a slower, reggae beat. Most of the 2 tone bands had multiracial lineups, such as the Beat (known as the English Beat in North America and Australia), the Specials, and the Selecter. Although only on the 2 tone label for one single, Madness was one of the most effective bands at bringing the 2 tone genre into the mainstream, with hits such as \"One Step Beyond\", \"Night Boat to Cairo\", and \"Our House\". The music of this era resonated with white working class youth and West Indian immigrants who experienced the struggles addressed in the lyrics.\nThird-wave ska.\nSka historian Albino Brown (of the radio program \"The Ska Parade\") coined the term \"third-wave ska\" in 1989 and helped to catalyze such multi-platinum bands as No Doubt and Sublime. Third-wave ska originated in the punk scene in the late 1980s and became commercially successful in the 1990s. Although some third-wave ska has a traditional 1960s sound, most third-wave ska is characterized by dominating guitar riffs and large horn sections.\nUnited Kingdom.\nBy the late 1980s, ska had experienced a minor resurgence of popularity in the United Kingdom, due to bands such as the Burial and the Hotknives. The 1980s and 1990s also heralded many ska festivals, and a re-emergence of the traditional skinhead subculture.\nEurope.\nThe early 1980s saw a massive surge in ska's popularity in Germany, leading to the founding of many German ska bands like the Busters, record labels and festivals.\nIn Spain, ska gained relevance in the 80s, first in some songs by groups like Ejecutivos agresivos and Los Cardiacos, but where it really gained strength was in the Basque Country due to the influence of Basque Radical Rock, with Kortatu and Potato being the most representatives bands. Skalariak and Betagarri followed in the early 1990s and their influence is visible outside the Basque Country in punk-rock bands like Ska-P, Boikot and many others that have gained importance in the Spanish rock and punk rock scene and festivals.\nAustralia.\nThe Australian ska scene flourished in the mid-1980s, following the musical precedents set by 2 tone, and spearheaded by bands such as the Porkers. Some of the Australian ska revival bands found success on the national music charts, most notably Allniters, who had a number 10 hit with a ska cover of \"Montego Bay\" in 1983. The 30 piece Melbourne Ska Orchestra has enjoyed success in recent years, touring internationally, including sets at Glastonbury and Montreux Jazz Festival.\nRussia and Japan.\nA Russian (then-Soviet) ska scene was established in the mid-1980s in Saint Petersburg as a kind of anglophone opposition to more traditional Russian rock music. Strannye Igry, AVIA and N.O.M. were among the first bands of genre. Then bands like Spitfire, Distemper, Leningrad and Markscheider Kunst became popular and commercially successful in Russia and abroad in the late 1990s.\nJapan established its own ska scene, colloquially referred to as \"J-ska\", in the mid-1980s. The Tokyo Ska Paradise Orchestra, formed in 1985, have been one of the most commercially successful progenitors of Japanese ska.\nThe Americas.\nLatin America's ska scene started developing in the mid-1980s. Latin American ska bands typically play traditional ska rhythms blended with strong influences from Latin music and rock en Espa\u00f1ol. The most prominent bands include the Grammy nominated Desorden P\u00fablico from Venezuela and Grammy awarded Los Fabulosos Cadillacs from Argentina, who scored an international hit single with \"El Matador\" in 1994.\nBy the early 1980s, 2 tone\u2013influenced ska bands began forming throughout the United States. The Uptones from Berkeley, California, and the Toasters from New York City\u2014both formed in 1981\u2014were among the first active ska bands in North America. They are both credited with laying the groundwork for American ska and establishing scenes in their respective regions. In Los Angeles around the same time, the Untouchables also formed. While many of the early American ska bands continued in the musical traditions set by 2 tone and the mod revival, bands such as Fishbone, the Mighty Mighty Bosstones and Operation Ivy pioneered the American ska punk subgenre, a fusion of ska and punk rock that typically downplayed ska's R&amp;B influence in favor of faster tempos and guitar distortion. In 1986, No Doubt, a ska punk band was formed. They were one of the more mainstream ska bands that set the stage for many up and coming bands.\nTwo hotspots for the United States' burgeoning ska scenes were New York City and Orange County, California. In New York, Toasters frontman Robert \"Bucket\" Hingley formed the independent record label Moon Ska Records in 1983. The label quickly became the largest independent ska label in the United States. The Orange County ska scene was a major breeding ground for ska punk and more contemporary pop-influenced ska music, personified by bands such as Reel Big Fish and Sublime. It was here that the term \"third-wave ska\" was coined and popularized by Albino Brown and Tazy Phyllipz (hosts of the \"Ska Parade\" radio show) to describe the new wave of ska-influenced bands which were steadily gaining notoriety; and Brown wrote the first treatise on ska's third wave in 1994. The San Francisco Bay Area also contributed to ska's growing popularity, with Skankin' Pickle, Let's Go Bowling and the Dance Hall Crashers becoming known on the touring circuit.\nThe mid-1990s saw a considerable rise in ska music's underground popularity, marked by the formation of many ska-based record labels, booking organizations and indie zines. While Moon Ska was still the largest of the United States' ska labels, other notable labels included Jump Up Records of Chicago, which covered the thriving midwest scene, and Steady Beat Recordings of Los Angeles, which covered Southern California's traditional ska revival. Stomp Records of Montreal was Canada's primary producer and distributor of ska music. Additionally, many punk and indie rock labels, such as Hellcat Records and Fueled by Ramen, broadened their scope to include both ska and ska punk bands. Asian Man Records (formerly Dill Records), founded in 1996, started out primarily releasing ska punk albums before branching out to other music styles.\nIn 1993, the Mighty Mighty Bosstones signed with Mercury Records, becoming the first American ska punk band to find mainstream commercial success, with their 1994 album \"Question the Answers\" achieving gold record status and peaking at number 138 on the \"Billboard\" 200. In 1995, punk band Rancid, featuring former members of Operation Ivy, released the ska punk single \"Time Bomb\", which reached number 8 on the \"Billboard\" Modern Rock Tracks, becoming the first major ska punk hit of the 1990s and launching the genre into the public eye. Over the next few years, a string of notable ska and ska-influenced singles became hits on mainstream radio, including \"Sell Out\" by Reel Big Fish and \"The Impression That I Get\" by the Mighty Mighty Bosstones, all of whom would reach platinum status with each of their respective albums. By 1996, third-wave ska was one of the most popular forms of alternative music in the United States.\nBy the late 1990s, mainstream interest in third-wave ska bands waned as other music genres gained momentum. Moon Ska Records folded in 2000, but Moon Ska Europe, a licensed affiliate based in Europe, continued operating in the 2000s and was later relaunched as Moon Ska World. In 2003, Hingley launched a new ska record label, Megalith Records.\nPost\u2013third-wave ska.\nIn the early 21st century, ska was mostly absent from the radio, though there were exceptions. In 2017, Captain SKA reached number 4 on the UK Singles Chart with \"Liar Liar GE2017\". In 2018, the Interrupters broke into the U.S. charts with their single \"She's Kerosene\". By 2019, several publications started speculating about whether a \"fourth wave\" of ska was about to emerge.\nThe term New Tone to describe a fourth wave of ska has started to pick up traction. The term New Tone originates from new ska band Bad Operation, to describe their two-tone sound and their city of New Orleans. The term has been popularized by the record label Bad Time Records due to their movie This Is New Tone. New Tone now has a vague definition and is used to describe the modern ska scene in general.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "27178", "revid": "7611264", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27178", "title": "Shoe", "text": "Footwear\nA shoe is an item of footwear intended to protect and comfort the human foot. Though the human foot can adapt to varied terrains and climate conditions, it is vulnerable, and shoes provide protection. Form was originally tied to function, but over time, shoes also became fashion items. Some shoes are worn as safety equipment, such as steel-toe boots, which are required footwear at industrial worksites.\nAdditionally, shoes have often evolved into many different designs; high heels, for instance, are most commonly worn by women during fancy occasions. Contemporary footwear varies vastly in style, complexity and cost. Basic sandals may consist of only a thin sole and simple strap and be sold for a low cost. High fashion shoes made by famous designers may be made of expensive materials, use complex construction and sell for large sums of money. Some shoes are designed for specific purposes, such as boots designed specifically for mountaineering or skiing, while others have more generalized usage such as sneakers which have transformed from a special purpose sport shoe into a general use shoe.\nTraditionally, shoes have been made from leather, wood or canvas, but are increasingly being made from rubber, plastics, and other petrochemical-derived materials. Globally, the shoe industry is a $200 billion a year industry. 90% of shoes end up in landfills, because the materials are hard to separate, recycle or otherwise reuse.\nHistory.\nAntiquity.\nEarliest evidence.\nThe earliest known shoes are sagebrush bark sandals dating from approximately 7000 or 8000 BC, found in the Fort Rock Cave in the US state of Oregon in 1938. The world's oldest leather shoe, made from a single piece of cowhide laced with a leather cord along seams at the front and back, was found in the Areni-1 cave complex in Armenia in 2008 and is believed to date to 3500 BC. \u00d6tzi the Iceman's shoes, dating to 3300 BC, featured brown bearskin bases, deerskin side panels, and a bark-string net, which pulled tight around the foot. The Jotunheimen shoe was discovered in August 2006: archaeologists estimate that this leather shoe was made between 1800 and 1100 BC, making it the oldest article of clothing discovered in Scandinavia. Sandals and other plant fiber based tools were found in Cueva de los Murci\u00e9lagos in Albu\u00f1ol in southern Spain in 2023, dating to approximately 7500 to 4200 BC, making them what are believed to be the oldest shoes found in Europe.\nIt is thought that shoes may have been used long before this, but because the materials used were highly perishable, it is difficult to find evidence of the earliest footwear.\nFootprints suggestive of shoes or sandals due to having crisp edges, no signs of toes found and three\u00a0small divots where leather tying laces/straps would have been attached have been at Garden Route National Park, Addo Elephant National Park and Goukamma Nature Reserve in South Africa. These date back to between 73,000 and 136,000 BP. Consistent with the existence of such shoe is the finding of bone awls dating back to this period that could have made simple footwear.\nAnother source of evidence is the study of the bones of the smaller toes (as opposed to the big toe); it was observed that their thickness decreased approximately 40,000 to 26,000 years ago. This led archaeologists to deduce the existence of common rather than an occasional wearing of shoes as this would lead to less bone growth, resulting in shorter, thinner toes. These earliest designs were very simple, often mere \"foot bags\" of leather to protect the feet from rocks, debris, and cold.\nAmericas.\nMany early natives in North America wore a similar type of footwear, known as the moccasin. These are tight-fitting, soft-soled shoes typically made out of leather or bison hides. Many moccasins were also decorated with various beads and other adornments. Moccasins were not designed to be waterproof, and in wet weather and warm summer months, most Native Americans went barefoot. The leaves of the sisal plant were used to make twine for sandals in South America while the natives of Mexico used the Yucca plant.\nAfrica and Middle East.\nAs civilizations began to develop, thong sandals (precursors to the modern flip-flop) were worn. This practice dates back to pictures of them in ancient Egyptian murals from 4000 BC. \"Thebet\" may have been the term used to describe these sandals in Egyptian times, possibly from the city Thebes. The Middle Kingdom is when the first of these thebets were found, but it is possible that it debuted in the Early Dynastic Period. One pair found in Europe was made of papyrus leaves and dated to be approximately 1,500 years old. They were also worn in Jerusalem during the first century of the Christian era. Thong sandals were worn by many civilizations and made from a vast variety of materials. Ancient Egyptian sandals were made from papyrus and palm leaves. The Masai of Africa made them out of rawhide. In India they were made from wood.\nWhile thong sandals were commonly worn, many people in ancient times, such as the Egyptians, Hindus and Greeks, saw little need for footwear, and most of the time, preferred being barefoot. The Egyptians and Hindus made some use of ornamental footwear, such as a soleless sandal known as a \"Cleopatra\", which did not provide any practical protection for the foot.\nAsia and Europe.\nThe ancient Greeks largely viewed footwear as self-indulgent, unaesthetic and unnecessary. They typically preferred to go barefoot, with shoes primarily worn in the theater, as a means of increasing stature. Athletes in the Ancient Olympic Games participated barefoot and naked. The ancient Greek gods and heroes were primarily depicted barefoot, as well as the hoplite warriors. They fought battles in bare feet; Alexander the Great led barefoot armies in military campaigns. The runners of ancient Greece are also believed to have run barefoot.\nThe Romans did not accept the Greek perception of footwear and clothing, despite having adopted much else of their culture. Clothing in ancient Rome signified power and footwear was seen as a civilizational necessity, although the slaves and paupers usually went barefoot. Roman soldiers were issued with chiral (left and right shoe different) footwear. Shoes for soldiers had riveted insoles to extend the life of the leather, increase comfort, and provide better traction. The design of these shoes also designated the rank of the officers. The more intricate the insignia and the higher up the boot went on the leg, the higher the rank of the soldier. There are references to shoes being worn in the Bible. In China and Japan, rice straws were used.\nStarting around 4 BC, the Greeks began wearing symbolic footwear. These were heavily decorated to clearly indicate the status of the wearer. Courtesans wore leather shoes colored with white, green, lemon or yellow dyes, and young woman betrothed or newly married wore pure white shoes. Because of the cost to lighten leather, shoes of a paler shade were a symbol of wealth in the upper class. Often, the soles would be carved with a message so it would imprint on the ground. Cobblers became a notable profession around this time, with Greek shoemakers becoming famed in the Roman Empire.\nMiddle Ages and early modern period.\nAsia and Europe.\nA common casual shoe in the Pyrenees during the Middle Ages was the espadrille. This is a sandal with braided jute soles and a fabric upper portion, and often includes fabric laces that tie around the ankle. The term is French and comes from the esparto grass. The shoe originated in the Catalonian region of Spain as early as the 13th century, and was commonly worn by peasants in the farming communities in the area.\nNew styles began to develop during the Song dynasty in China, some of them resulting from the binding of women's feet, first used by the noble Han classes, but soon spreading throughout Chinese society. The practice allegedly started during the Shang dynasty, but it grew popular by c.\u2009AD 960.\nWhen the Mongols conquered China, they dissolved the practice in 1279, and the Manchus banned foot binding in 1644. The Han people, however, continued the practice without much government intervention.\nIn medieval times shoes could be up to long, with their toes sometimes filled with hair, wool, moss, or grass. Many medieval shoes were made using the turnshoe method of construction, in which the upper was turned flesh side out, and was lasted onto the sole and joined to the edge by a seam. The shoe was then turned inside-out so that the grain was outside. Some shoes were developed with toggled flaps or drawstrings to tighten the leather around the foot for a better fit. Surviving medieval turnshoes often fit the foot closely, with the right and left shoe being mirror images. Around 1500, the turnshoe method was largely replaced by the welted rand method (where the uppers are sewn to a much stiffer sole and the shoe cannot be turned inside-out). The turn shoe method is still used for some dance and specialty shoes.\nBy the 15th century, pattens became popular by both men and women in Europe. These are commonly seen as the predecessor of the modern high-heeled shoe, while the poor and lower classes in Europe, as well as slaves in the New World, were barefoot. In the 15th century, the Crakow was fashionable in Europe. This style of shoe is named because it is thought to have originated in Krak\u00f3w, the capital of Poland. The style is characterized by the point of the shoe, known as the \"polaine\", which often was supported by a whalebone tied to the knee to prevent the point getting in the way while walking. Also during the 15th century, chopines were created in Spain, and were usually high. These shoes became popular in Venice and throughout Europe, as a status symbol revealing wealth and social standing. During the 16th century, royalty, such as Catherine de Medici or Mary I of England, started wearing high-heeled shoes to make them look taller or larger than life. By 1580, even men wore them, and a person with authority or wealth was often referred to as, \"well-heeled\". In 17th century France, heels were exclusively worn by aristocrats. King Louis XIV outlawed anybody from wearing red high heels except for himself and his royal court.\nEventually the modern shoe, with a sewn-on sole, was devised. Since the 17th century, most leather shoes have used a sewn-on sole. This remains the standard for finer-quality dress shoes today. Until around 1800, welted rand shoes were commonly made without differentiation for the left or right foot. Such shoes are now referred to as \"straights\". Only gradually did the modern foot-specific shoe become standard.\nIndustrial era.\nAsia and Europe.\nShoemaking became more commercialized in the mid-18th century, as it expanded as a cottage industry. Large warehouses began to stock footwear, made by many small manufacturers from the area.\nUntil the 19th century, shoemaking was a traditional handicraft, but by the century's end, the process had been almost completely mechanized, with production occurring in large factories. Despite the obvious economic gains of mass production, the factory system produced shoes without the individual differentiation that the traditional shoemaker was able to provide.\nIn the 19th century Chinese feminists called for an end to foot binding, and a ban in 1902 was implemented. The ban was soon repealed, but it was banned again in 1911 by the new Nationalist government. It was effective in coastal cities, but countryside cities continued without much regulation. Mao Zedong enforced the rule in 1949 and the practice is still forbidden. A number of women still have bound feet today.\nThe first steps towards mechanisation were taken during the Napoleonic Wars by the engineer, Marc Brunel. He developed machinery for the mass production of boots for the soldiers of the British Army. In 1812, he devised a scheme for making nailed-boot-making machinery that automatically fastened soles to uppers by means of metallic pins or nails. With the support of the Duke of York, the shoes were manufactured, and, due to their strength, cheapness, and durability, were introduced for the use of the army. In the same year, the use of screws and staples was patented by Richard Woodman. Brunel's system was described by Sir Richard Phillips as a visitor to his factory in Battersea as follows:\nIn another building I was shown his manufactory of shoes, which, like the other, is full of ingenuity, and, in regard to subdivision of labour, brings this fabric on a level with the oft-admired manufactory of pins. Every step in it is affected by the most elegant and precise machinery; while, as each operation is performed by one hand, so each shoe passes through twenty-five hands, who complete from the hide, as supplied by the currier, a hundred pairs of strong and well-finished shoes per day. All the details are performed by the ingenious application of the mechanic powers; and all the parts are characterised by precision, uniformity, and accuracy. As each man performs but one step in the process, which implies no knowledge of what is done by those who go before or follow him, so the persons employed are not shoemakers, but wounded soldiers, who are able to learn their respective duties in a few hours. The contract at which these shoes are delivered to Government is 6s. 6d. per pair, being at least 2s. less than what was paid previously for an unequal and cobbled article.\nHowever, when the war ended in 1815, manual labour became much cheaper, and the demand for military equipment subsided. As a consequence, Brunel's system was no longer profitable and it soon ceased business.\nAmericas.\nSimilar exigencies at the time of the Crimean War stimulated a renewed interest in methods of mechanization and mass-production, which proved longer lasting. A shoemaker in Leicester, Tomas Crick, patented the design for a riveting machine in 1853. His machine used an iron plate to push iron rivets into the sole. The process greatly increased the speed and efficiency of production. He also introduced the use of steam-powered rolling-machines for hardening leather and cutting-machines, in the mid-1850s.\nThe sewing machine was introduced in 1846, and provided an alternative method for the mechanization of shoemaking. By the late 1850s, the industry was beginning to shift towards the modern factory, mainly in the US and areas of England. A shoe-stitching machine was invented by the American Lyman Blake in 1856 and perfected by 1864. Entering into a partnership with McKay, his device became known as the McKay stitching machine and was quickly adopted by manufacturers throughout New England. As bottlenecks opened up in the production line due to these innovations, more and more of the manufacturing stages, such as pegging and finishing, became automated. By the 1890s, the process of mechanisation was largely complete.\nOn January 24, 1899, Humphrey O'Sullivan of Lowell, Massachusetts, was awarded a patent for a rubber heel for boots and shoes.\nBy the 20th century, the United States had become the largest manufacturer of shoes worldwide.\nGlobalization.\nIn 1910, the AGO system of stitchless, glued shoes was developed. Since the mid-20th century, advances in rubber, plastics, synthetic cloth, and industrial adhesives have allowed manufacturers to create shoes that stray considerably from traditional crafting techniques. Leather, which had been the primary material in earlier styles, has remained standard in expensive dress shoes, but athletic shoes often have little or no real leather. Soles, which were once laboriously hand-stitched on, are now more often machine stitched or simply glued on. Many of these newer materials, such as rubber and plastics, have made shoes less biodegradable. It is estimated that most mass-produced shoes require 1000 years to degrade in a landfill. In the late 2000s, some shoemakers picked up on the issue and began to produce shoes made entirely from degradable materials, such as the Nike Considered.\nAs a result of globalization, share of shoe imports in the United States rose from 4% in 1960 to 89% by 1995. In the Philippines, the town of Marikina produced 70% of the shoes sold domestically in the 1970s and 1980s, but after the country joined the World Trade Organization in 1995 for the economy's liberalization, a large influx of cheaply-produced shoes from China, Taiwan and other Asian countries made a sizable negative effect on its shoe industry.\nIn 2007, the global shoe industry had an overall market of $107.4 billion, in terms of revenue, and is expected to grow to $122.9 billion by the end of 2012. Shoe manufacturers in the People's Republic of China account for 63% of production, 40.5% of global exports and 55% of industry revenue. However, many manufacturers in Europe dominate the higher-priced, higher value-added end of the market.\nCulture and folklore.\nAs an integral part of human culture and civilization, shoes have found their way into culture, folklore, and art. A popular 18th-century nursery rhyme is \"There was an Old Woman Who Lived in a Shoe\". In 1948, Mahlon Haines, a shoe salesman in Hallam, Pennsylvania, built an actual house shaped like a work boot as a form of advertisement; the Haines Shoe House still stands today and is a popular roadside attraction.\nShoes also play an important role in the fairy tales \"Cinderella\" and \"The Red Shoes\". In the movie adaption of the children's book \"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\", a pair of red ruby slippers play a key role in the plot. The 1985 comedy \"The Man with One Red Shoe\" features an eccentric man wearing one normal business shoe and one red shoe that becomes central to the plot.\nAthletic sneaker collection has also existed as a part of urban subculture in the United States for several decades. Recent decades have seen this trend spread to European nations such as the Czech Republic. A Sneakerhead is a person who owns multiple pairs of shoes as a form of collection and fashion.\nIn the Bible's Old Testament, the shoe is used to symbolize something that is worthless or of little value. In the New Testament, the act of removing one's shoes symbolizes servitude. Ancient Semitic-speaking peoples regarded the act of removing their shoes as a mark of reverence when approaching a sacred person or place. The removal of the shoe also symbolizes the act of giving up a legal right. In Hebrew custom, if a man chose not to marry his childless brother's widow, the widow removed her brother-in-law's shoe to symbolize that he had abandoned his duty. In Arab custom, the removal of one's shoe also symbolized the dissolution of marriage.\nIn Arab culture, showing the sole of one's shoe is considered an insult, and to throw a shoe and hit someone with it is considered an even greater insult. Shoes are considered to be dirty as they frequently touch the ground, and are associated with the lowest part of the body\u2014the foot. As such, shoes are forbidden in mosques, and it is also considered unmannerly to cross the legs and display the soles of one's shoes during conversation. This insult was demonstrated in Iraq, first when Saddam Hussein's statue was toppled in 2003, Iraqis gathered around it and struck the statue with their shoes. In 2008, United States President George W. Bush had a shoe thrown at him by a journalist as a statement against the war in Iraq. More generally, shoe-throwing or shoeing, showing the sole of one's shoe or using shoes to insult are forms of protest in many parts of the world.\nEmpty shoes may also symbolize death. In Greek culture, empty shoes are the equivalent of the American funeral wreath. For example, empty shoes placed outside of a Greek home would tell others that the family's son has died in battle. The Shoes on the Danube Bank is a memorial in Budapest, Hungary, to honor the Jews who were killed by fascist Arrow Cross militiamen in Budapest during World War II.\nConstruction.\nThe basic anatomy of a shoe is recognizable, regardless of the specific style of footwear.\nSole.\nAll shoes have a &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;sole, which is the bottom of a shoe, in contact with the ground. Soles can be made from a variety of materials, although most modern shoes have soles made from natural rubber, polyurethane, or polyvinyl chloride (PVC) compounds. Soles can be simple\u2014a single material in a single layer\u2014or they can be complex, with multiple structures or layers and materials. When various layers are used, soles may consist of an insole, midsole, and an outsole.\nInsole.\nThe &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;insole is the interior bottom of a shoe, which sits directly beneath the foot under the footbed (also known as sock liner). The purpose of the insole is to attach to the lasting margin of the upper, which is wrapped around the last during the closing of the shoe during the lasting operation. Insoles are usually made of cellulosic paper board or synthetic non woven insole board. Many shoes have removable and replaceable footbeds. Extra cushioning is often added for comfort (to control the shape, moisture, or smell of the shoe) or health reasons (to help deal with differences in the natural shape of the foot or positioning of the foot during standing or walking).\nOutsole.\nThe &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;outsole is the layer in direct contact with the ground. Dress shoes often have leather or resin rubber outsoles; casual or work-oriented shoes have outsoles made of natural rubber or a synthetic material like polyurethane. The outsole may comprise a single piece or may be an assembly of separate pieces, often of different materials. On some shoes, the heel of the sole has a rubber plate for durability and traction, while the front is leather for style. Specialized shoes will often have modifications on this design: athletic or so-called cleated shoes like soccer, rugby, baseball and golf shoes have spikes embedded in the outsole to improve traction.\nMidsole.\nThe &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;midsole is the layer in between the outsole and the insole, typically there for shock absorption. Some types of shoes, like running shoes, have additional material for shock absorption, usually beneath the heel of the foot, where one puts the most pressure down. Some shoes may not have a midsole at all.\nThe heel is the bottom rear part of a shoe. Its function is to support the heel of the foot. They are often made of the same material as the sole of the shoe. This part can be high for fashion or to make the person look taller, or flat for more practical and comfortable use. On some shoes the inner forward point of the heel is chiselled off, a feature known as a \"gentleman's corner\". This piece of design is intended to alleviate the problem of the points catching the bottom of trousers and was first observed in the 1930s. A heel is the projection at the back of a shoe which rests below the heel bone. The shoe heel is used to improve the balance of the shoe, increase the height of the wearer, alter posture or other decorative purposes. Sometimes raised, the high heel is common to a form of shoe often worn by women, but sometimes by men too. See also stiletto heel.\nUpper.\nThe &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;upper helps hold the shoe onto the foot. In the simplest cases, such as sandals or flip-flops, this may be nothing more than a few straps for holding the sole in place. Closed footwear, such as boots, trainers and most men's shoes, will have a more complex upper. This part is often decorated or is made in a certain style to look attractive. The upper is connected to the sole by a strip of leather, rubber, or plastic that is stitched between it and the sole, known as a welt.\nMost uppers have a mechanism, such as laces, straps with buckles, zippers, elastic, velcro straps, buttons, or snaps, for tightening the upper on the foot. Uppers with laces usually have a tongue that helps seal the laced opening and protect the foot from abrasion by the laces. Uppers with laces also have eyelets or hooks to make it easier to tighten and loosen the laces and to prevent the lace from tearing through the upper material. An aglet is the protective wrapping on the end of the lace.\nVamp.\nThe &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;vamp is the front part of the shoe, starting behind the toe, extending around the eyelets and tongue and towards back part of the shoe.\nMedial.\nThe &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;medial is the part of the shoe closest to a person's center of symmetry, and the lateral is on the opposite side, away from their center of symmetry. This can be in reference to either the outsole or the vamp. Most shoes have shoelaces on the upper, connecting the medial and lateral parts after one puts their shoes on and aiding in keeping their shoes on their feet. In 1968, Puma SE introduced the first pair of sneakers with Velcro straps in lieu of shoelaces, and these became popular by the 1980s, especially among children and the elderly.\nThe &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;toe box is the part that covers and protects the toes. People with toe deformities, or individuals who experience toe swelling (such as long-distance runners) usually require a larger toe box.\nTypes.\nMost types of shoes are designed for specific activities. For example, boots are typically designed for work or heavy outdoor use. Athletic shoes are designed for particular sports such as running, walking, or other sports. Some shoes are designed to be worn at more formal occasions, and others are designed for casual wear. There are also a vast variety of shoes designed for different types of dancing. Orthopedic shoes are special types of footwear designed for individuals with particular foot problems or special needs. Clinicians evaluate patient's footwear as a part of their clinical examination. However, it is often based on each individual's needs, with attention to the choice of footwear worn and if the shoe is adequate for the purpose of completing their activities of daily living. Other animals, such as dogs and horses, may also wear special shoes to protect their feet as well.\nDepending on the activity for which they are designed, some types of footwear may fit into multiple categories. For example, Cowboy boots are considered boots, but may also be worn in more formal occasions and used as dress shoes. Hiking boots incorporate many of the protective features of boots, but also provide the extra flexibility and comfort of many athletic shoes. Flip-flops are considered casual footwear, but have also been worn in formal occasions, such as visits to the White House.\nAthletic.\nAthletic shoes are designed for various sports activities, focusing on maximizing friction between the foot and the ground. These shoes often utilize materials like rubber to achieve this purpose. The earliest athletic shoes, dating to the mid-19th century, were track spikes with metal cleats for increased traction. Over time, athletic shoe design evolved, with companies like Reebok and Adidas contributing to the development of modern athletic shoes. Notable innovations include rubber-soled athletic shoes and the introduction of specialized shoes for different sports, such as basketball and golf. More recently, minimalist shoes have gained popularity as barefoot running became popular by the late 20th and early 21st century, maintaining optimum flexibility and natural walking while also providing some degree of protection. Their purpose is to allow one's feet and legs to feel more subtly the impacts and forces involved in running, allowing finer adjustments in running style.\nThe earliest rubber-soled athletic shoes date back to 1876 in the United Kingdom, when the New Liverpool Rubber Company made plimsolls, or sandshoes, designed for the sport of croquet. Similar rubber-soled shoes were made in 1892 in the United States by Humphrey O'Sullivan, based on Charles Goodyear's technology. The United States Rubber Company was founded the same year and produced rubber-soled and heeled shoes under a variety of brand names, which were later consolidated in 1916 under the name, Keds. These shoes became known as, \"sneakers\", because the rubber sole allowed the wearer to sneak up on another person. In 1964, the founding of Nike by Phil Knight and Bill Bowerman of the University of Oregon introduced many new improvements common in modern running shoes, such as rubber waffle soles, breathable nylon uppers, and cushioning in the mid-sole and heel. During the 1970s, the expertise of podiatrists also became important in athletic shoe design, to implement new design features based on how feet reacted to specific actions, such as running, jumping, or side-to-side movement for men and women.\nShoes specific to the sport of basketball were developed by Chuck Taylor, and are popularly known as Chuck Taylor All-Stars. In 1969, Taylor was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in recognition of this development, and in the 1970s, other shoe manufacturers, such as Nike, Adidas, Reebok, and others began imitating this style of athletic shoe. In April 1985, Nike introduced its own brand of basketball shoe which would become popular in its own right, the Air Jordan, named after the then-rookie Chicago Bulls basketball player, Michael Jordan. The Air Jordan line of shoes sold $100 million in their first year.\nAs barefoot running became popular by the late 20th and early 21st century, many modern shoe manufacturers have recently designed footwear that mimic this experience, maintaining optimum flexibility and natural walking while also providing some degree of protection. Some of these shoes include the Vibram FiveFingers, Nike Free, and Saucony's Kinvara and Hattori. Mexican huaraches are also very simple running shoes, similar to the shoes worn by the Tarahumara people of northern Mexico, who are known for their distance running abilities. Wrestling shoes are also very light and flexible shoes that are designed to mimic bare feet while providing additional traction and protection.\nMany athletic shoes are designed with specific features for specific activities. One of these includes roller skates, which have metal or plastic wheels on the bottom specific for the sport of roller skating. Similarly, ice skates have a metal blade attached to the bottom for locomotion across ice. Skate shoes have also been designed to provide a comfortable, flexible and durable shoe for the sport of skateboarding. Climbing shoes are rubber-soled, tight-fitting shoes designed to fit in the small cracks and crevices for rock climbing. Cycling shoes are similarly designed with rubber soles and a tight fit, but also are equipped with a metal or plastic cleat to interface with clipless pedals, as well as a stiff sole to maximize power transfer and support the foot. Some shoes are made specifically to improve a person's ability to weight train. Sneakers that are a mix between an activity-centered and a more standard design have also been produced: examples include roller shoes, which feature wheels that can be used to roll on hard ground, and Soap shoes, which feature a hard plastic sole that can be used for grinding.\nBoot.\nBoots are a specialized type of footwear that covers the foot and extends up the leg. They serve both functional and fashion purposes, offering protection from elements like water, snow, and mud while also being a fashion statement.\nCowboy boots, for instance, are known for their distinctive style and are popular among cowboys in the western United States. Hiking boots, on the other hand, are designed for comfort and support during long walks in rough terrains. Snow boots are ideal for wet or snowy weather, providing warmth and protection against the elements. Additionally, boots are used in specialized activities like skiing, ice skating, and climbing due to their unique features tailored to these activities.\nBoots may also be attached to snowshoes to increase the distribution of weight over a larger surface area for walking in snow. Ski boots are a specialized snow boot which are used in alpine or cross-country skiing and designed to provide a way to attach the skier to his/her skis using ski bindings. The ski/boot/binding combination is used to effectively transmit control inputs from the skier's legs to the snow. Ice skates are another specialized boot with a metal blade attached to the bottom which is used to propel the wearer across a sheet of ice. Inline skates are similar to ice skates but with a set of three to four wheels in lieu of the blade, which are designed to mimic ice skating on solid surfaces such as wood or concrete.\nBoots are designed to withstand heavy wear to protect the wearer and provide good traction. They are generally made from sturdy leather uppers and non-leather outsoles. They may be used for uniforms of the police or military, as well as for protection in industrial settings such as mining and construction. Protective features may include steel-tipped toes and soles or ankle guards.\nDress and casual.\nDress shoes are characterized by their smooth leather uppers, leather soles, and sleek design, suitable for formal occasions. In contrast, casual shoes have sturdier leather uppers, non-leather outsoles, and a wider profile for everyday wear. Some dress shoe designs are unisex, while others are specific to men or women.\nMen's.\nMen's dress shoes include styles like Oxfords, Derbies, Monk-straps, and Slip-ons, each with its unique characteristics in terms of lacing, decoration, and formality.\nWomen's.\nWomen's shoes cover a wide range of styles, including high heels, mules, slingbacks, ballet flats, and court shoes, with high-heeled footwear being a popular choice for formal occasions.\nDance.\nDancers use a variety of footwear depending on the style of dance and the surface they will be dancing on. Pointe shoes, for instance, are designed for ballet dancing, featuring a stiffened toe box and hardened sole to allow dancers to stand on the tips of their toes. Ballet shoes, on the other hand, are soft, pliable shoes made of canvas or leather, providing flexibility and comfort for ballet dancing. Other dance shoe types include jazz shoes, tango, and flamenco shoes, ballroom shoes, tap shoes, character shoes, and foot thongs, each designed to meet the specific needs of different dance styles.\nOrthopedic.\nOrthopedic shoes are specially designed to alleviate discomfort associated with various foot and ankle disorders, such as blisters, bunions, calluses, and plantar fasciitis. They are also used by individuals with diabetes, unequal leg length, or children with mobility issues. These shoes typically feature a low heel, wide toe box, and firm heel for added support. Some orthopedic shoes come with removable insoles or orthotics to provide extra arch support.\nMeasures and sizes.\nShoe sizes are indicated by a numerical value representing the length of the shoe, with different systems used globally. European sizes are measured in Paris Points, while the UK and American units are based on whole-number sizes spaced at one barleycorn (1/3 inch) with UK adult sizes starting at size 1 = . In the US, this is size 2. Men's and women's shoe sizes often use different scales, and some systems are measured using a Brannock Device which considers the width and length size values of the feet. The Mondopoint system, introduced in the 1970s by International Standard ISO 2816:1973 \"Fundamental characteristics of a system of shoe sizing to be known as Mondopoint\" and ISO 3355:1975 \"Shoe sizes \u2013 System of length grading (for use in the Mondopoint system)\" includes measurements of both length and width of the foot.\nAccessories.\nVarious accessories are used to enhance the functionality and comfort of shoes. Crampons provide traction on icy terrain, foam taps adjust shoe fit, heel grips prevent slipping, and ice cleats enhance stability on slippery surfaces. Overshoes protect shoes from rain and snow, while shoe bags are used for storage. Shoe brushes and polishing cloths maintain shoe appearance, while shoe inserts offer additional comfort.\nRemoval of shoes.\nIn many places in the world, shoes are removed when moving from exteriors to interiors, particularly in homes and religious buildings. In many Asian countries, outdoor shoes are exchanged for indoor shoes or slippers. Fitness center etiquette encourages the exchange of outdoor shoes for indoor shoes, both to prevent dirt and grime from being transferred to the equipment and to ensure that participants are wearing the right shoes for their activities.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "27181", "revid": "13286072", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27181", "title": "Slang", "text": "Vocabulary of an informal register\nA slang is a vocabulary (words, phrases, and linguistic usages) of an informal register, common in everyday conversation but avoided in formal writing and speech. It also often refers to the language exclusively used by the members of particular in-groups in order to establish group identity, exclude outsiders, or both. The word itself came about in the 18th century and has been defined in multiple ways since its conception, with no single technical usage in linguistics.\nEtymology of the word \"slang\".\nIn its earliest attested use (1756), the word \"slang\" referred to the vocabulary of \"low\" or \"disreputable\" people. By the early nineteenth century, it was no longer exclusively associated with disreputable people, but continued to be applied to usages below the level of standard educated speech. In Scots dialect it meant \"talk, chat, gossip\", as used by Aberdeen poet William Scott in 1832: \"The slang gaed on aboot their war'ly care.\"\n In northern English dialect it meant \"impertinence, abusive language\".\nThe origin of the word \"slang\" is unclear. It was first used in print around 1800 to refer to the language of the disreputable and criminal classes in London, though its usage likely dates back further. A Scandinavian origin has been proposed (compare, for example, Norwegian , which means \"nickname\"), but based on \"date and early associations\" is discounted by the Oxford English Dictionary. Jonathon Green, however, agrees with the possibility of a Scandinavian origin, suggesting the same root as that of \"sling\", which means \"to throw\", and noting that slang is thrown language \u2013 a quick and honest way to make your point.\nDefining slang.\nLinguists have no simple and clear definition of slang but agree that it is a constantly changing linguistic phenomenon present in every subculture worldwide. Some argue that slang exists because we must come up with ways to define new experiences that have surfaced with time and modernity. Attempting to remedy the lack of a clear definition, however, Bethany K. Dumas and Jonathan Lighter argue that an expression should be considered \"true slang\" if it meets at least two of the following criteria:\nMichael Adams remarks that \"[Slang] is liminal language... it is often impossible to tell, even in context, which interests and motives it serves... slang is on the edge.\" Slang dictionaries, collecting thousands of slang entries, offer a broad, empirical window into the motivating forces behind slang.\nWhile many forms of lexicon may be considered low-register or \"sub-standard\", slang remains distinct from colloquial and jargon terms because of its specific social contexts. While viewed as inappropriate in formal usage, colloquial terms are typically considered acceptable in speech across a wide range of contexts, whereas slang tends to be perceived as inappropriate in many common communication situations. Jargon refers to language used by personnel in a particular field or to language used to represent specific terms within a field to those with a particular interest. Although jargon and slang can both be used to exclude non-group members from the conversation, slang tends to emphasize social and contextual understanding whereas the main purpose of jargon is to optimize communication using terms that imply technical understanding.\nWhile colloquialisms and jargon may seem like slang because they reference a particular group, they do not necessarily fit the same definition because they do not represent a particular effort to replace the general lexicon of a standard language. Colloquialisms are considered more acceptable and more expected in standard usage than slang is, and jargon is often created to talk about aspects of a particular field that are not accounted for in the general lexicon. However, this differentiation is not consistently applied by linguists; the terms \"slang\" and \"jargon\" are sometimes treated as synonymous, and the scope of \"jargon\" is at times extended to mean all forms of socially-restricted language.\nIt is often difficult to differentiate slang from colloquialisms and even high-register lexicon, because slang terms that do not fall out of usage generally become accepted into common vocabulary over time. Words such as \"spurious\" and \"strenuous\" were once perceived as slang, but they are now considered general, even high-register words. Some literature on slang even says that mainstream acceptance of a slang term removes its status as true slang because it is then accepted by the media and is thus no longer the special insider speech of a particular group. For example, Black American music frequently uses AAVE slang, and many of its frequently used terms have subsequently been taken up by vernacular English in a broader context. Some say that slang is whatever would not be acceptable in academic or legal writing, but this fails to distinguish slang from language which is simply informal. Others say that a word is slang only until it has been entered in the Oxford English Dictionary, at which point its status changes.\nExamples of slang (cross-linguistic).\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nFormation of slang.\nIt is often difficult to collect etymologies for slang terms, largely because slang is a phenomenon of speech, rather than written language and etymologies which are typically traced via corpus.\nEric Partridge, cited as the first to report on the phenomenon of slang in a systematic and linguistic way, postulated that a term would likely be in circulation for a decade before it would be written down. Nevertheless, it seems that slang generally forms via deviation from a standard form. This \"spawning\" of slang occurs in much the same way that any general semantic change might occur. The difference here is that the slang term's new meaning takes on a specific social significance having to do with the group the term indexes.\nColeman also suggests that slang is differentiated within more general semantic change in that it typically has to do with a certain degree of \"playfulness\". The development of slang is considered to be a largely \"spontaneous, lively, and creative\" speech process.\nStill, while a great deal of slang takes off, even becoming accepted into the standard lexicon, much slang dies out, sometimes only referencing a group. An example of this is the term \"groovy\" which is a relic of 1960s and 70s American hippie slang. Nevertheless, for a slang term to become a slang term, people must use it, at some point in time, as a way to flout standard language. Additionally, slang terms may be borrowed between groups, such as the term \"gig\" which was originally coined by jazz musicians in the 1930s and then borrowed into the same hippie slang of the 1960s. 'The word \"groovy\" has remained a part of subculture lexicon since its popularization. It is still in common use today by a significant population. The word \"gig\" to refer to a performance very likely originated well before the 1930s, and remained a common term throughout the 1940s and 1950s before becoming vaguely associated with the hippie slang of the 1960s. The word \"gig\" is now a widely accepted synonym for a concert, recital, or performance of any type.\nGenerally, slang terms undergo the same processes of semantic change that words in the regular lexicon do.\nSlang often forms from words with previously differing meanings, one example is the often used and popular slang word \"lit\", which was created by a generation labeled \"Generation Z\". The word itself used to be associated with something being on fire or being \"lit\" up until 1988 when it was first used in writing to indicate a person who was drunk in the book \"Warbirds: Diary of an Unknown Aviator\". Since this time \"lit\" has gained popularity through Rap songs such as ASAP Rocky's \"Get Lit\" in 2011. As the popularity of the word has increased so too has the number of different meanings associated with the word. Now \"lit\" describes a person who is drunk and/or high, as well as an event that is especially awesome and \"hype\".\nWords and phrases from popular Hollywood films and television series frequently become slang.\nEarly history.\nOne early slang-like code, thieves' cant, was first used in England in around the year 1600 as a way of law-breakers to communicate without the authorities knowing of what they were saying.\nSocial implications.\nIndexicality.\nSlang is usually associated with a particular social group and plays a role in constructing identity. While slang outlines social space, attitudes about slang partly construct group identity and identify individuals as members of groups. Therefore, using the slang of a particular group associates an individual with that group. Michael Silverstein's orders of indexicality can be employed to assign a slang term as a second-order index to that particular group. Using a slang term, however, can also give an individual the qualities associated with the term's group of origin, whether or not the individual is trying to identify as a member of the group. This allocation of qualities based on abstract group association is known as third-order indexicality.\nAs outlined in Elisa Mattiello's book \"An Introduction to English Slang\", a slang term can assume several levels of meaning and can be used for many reasons connected with identity. For example, male adolescents use the terms \"foxy\" and \"shagadelic\" to \"show their belonging to a band, to stress their virility or their age, to reinforce connection with their peer group and to exclude outsiders, to show off, etc.\" These two examples use both traditional and nontraditional methods of word formation to create words with more meaning and expressiveness than the more direct and traditional words \"sexy\" and \"beautiful\": \nFrom the semantic point of view, slangy \"foxy\" is more loaded than neutral \"sexy\" in terms of information provided. That is, for young people \"foxy\" means having the quality of: (1) attracting interest, attention, affection, (2) causing desire, (3) excellent or admirable in appearance, and (4) sexually provocative, exciting, etc., whereas \"sexy\" only refers to the quality indicated in point (4).\nMatiello stresses that those agents who identify themselves as \"young men\" have \"genuinely coined\" these terms and choose to use them over \"canonical\" terms \u2014like beautiful or sexy\u2014because of the indexicalized social identifications the former convey.\nFirst and second order indexicality.\nIn terms of first and second order indexicality, the usage of speaker-oriented terms by male adolescents indicated their membership to their age group, to reinforce connection to their peer group, and to exclude outsiders.\nHigher-order indexicality.\nIn terms of higher order indexicality, anyone using these terms may desire to appear fresher, undoubtedly more playful, faddish, and colourful than someone who employs the standard English term \"beautiful\". This appearance relies heavily on the hearer's third-order understanding of the term's associated social nuances and presupposed use-cases.\nSubculture associations.\nOften, distinct subcultures will create slang that members will use in order to associate themselves with the group, or to delineate outsiders.\nSlang terms are often known only within a clique or ingroup. For example, Leet (\"Leetspeak\" or \"1337\") was originally popular only among certain internet subcultures such as software crackers and online video gamers. During the 1990s, and into the early 21st century, however, Leet became increasingly commonplace on the internet, and it has spread outside internet-based communication and into spoken languages. Other types of slang include SMS language used on mobile phones, and \"chatspeak\", (e.g., \"LOL\", an acronym meaning \"laughing out loud\" or \"laugh out loud\" or ROFL, \"rolling on the floor laughing\"), which are widely used in instant messaging on the internet.\nAs subcultures are often forms of counterculture, which is understood to oppose the norm, it follows that slang has come to be associated with counterculture.\nSocial media and internet slang.\nSlang is often adopted from social media as a sign of social awareness and shared knowledge of popular culture. This type known as internet slang has become prevalent since the early 2000s along with the rise in popularity of social networking services, including Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. This has spawned new vocabularies associated with each new social media venue, such as the use of the term \"friending\" on Facebook, which is a verbification of \"friend\" used to describe the process of adding a new person to one's group of friends on the website, despite the existence of an analogous term \"befriend\". This term is much older than Facebook, but has only recently entered the popular lexicon. Other examples of slang in social media demonstrate a proclivity toward shortened words or acronyms. These are especially associated with services such as Twitter, which () has a 280-character limit for each message and therefore requires a relatively brief mode of expression. This includes the use of hashtags which explicitly state the main content of a message or image, such as #food or #photography.\nDebates about slang.\nSome critics believe that when slang becomes more commonplace it effectively eradicates the \"proper\" use of a certain language. However, academic (descriptive) linguists believe that language is not static but ever-changing and that slang terms are valid words within a language's lexicon. While prescriptivists study and promote the socially preferable or \"correct\" ways to speak, according to a language's normative grammar and syntactical words, descriptivists focus on studying language to further understand the subconscious rules of how individuals speak, which makes slang important in understanding such rules. Noam Chomsky, a founder of anthropological linguistic thought, challenged structural and prescriptive grammar and began to study sounds and morphemes functionally, as well as their changes within a language over time.\nIn popular culture.\nThe 1941 film, \"Ball of Fire\", portrays a professor played by Gary Cooper who is researching and writing an encyclopedia article about slang.\nThe 2006 film, \"Idiocracy\", portrays a less intelligent society in the year 2505 that has people who use all various sorts of aggressive slang. These slang phrases sound very foreign and alienating to the protagonist of the movie, a US Army librarian.\nIn the 2013 song, \"Fire\", Big Sean says \"Was in Japan so long, I almost learn to speak. Had to leave back to the hood, where they don't understand unless you speak in Trapanese.\" Not only was Sean trying to rhyme with the word \u201cJapanese\u201d, but he's jokingly combining it with the word \"trap\" (slang for a house used to sell drugs or the hood in general. This humorous bar coins the term \"trapanese\" as another way to say \"slang.\"\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It soon spread to other parts of the United Kingdom, with a second working-class skinhead movement emerging worldwide in the late 1970s. Motivated by social alienation and working-class solidarity, skinheads are defined by their close-cropped or shaven heads and working-class clothing such as Dr. Martens and steel toe work boots, braces, high rise and varying length straight-leg jeans, and button-down collar shirts, usually slim fitting in check or plain. The movement reached a peak at the end of the 1960s, experienced a revival in the 1980s, and, since then, has endured in multiple contexts worldwide.\nThe rise to prominence of skinheads came in two waves, with the first wave taking place in the late 1960s in the UK. The first skinheads were working class youths motivated by an expression of alternative values and working class pride, rejecting both the austerity and conservatism of the 1950s\u2013early 1960s and the more middle class or bourgeois hippie movement and peace and love ethos of the mid to late 1960s. Skinheads were instead drawn towards more working class outsider subcultures, incorporating elements of early working class mod fashion and Jamaican music and fashion, especially from Jamaican rude boys. In the earlier stages of the movement, a considerable overlap existed between early skinhead subculture, mod subculture, and the rude boy subculture found among Jamaican British and Jamaican immigrant youth, as these three groups interacted and fraternized with each other within the same working class and poor neighbourhoods in Britain. As skinheads adopted elements of mod subculture and Jamaican British and Jamaican immigrant rude boy subculture, both first and second generation skins were influenced by the rhythms of Jamaican music genres such as ska, rocksteady, and reggae, as well as sometimes African-American soul and rhythm and blues.\nThe late 1970s and early 1980s saw a revival or second wave of the skinhead subculture, with increasing interaction between its adherents and the emerging punk movement. Oi!, a working class offshoot of punk rock, soon became a vital component of skinhead culture, while the Jamaican genres beloved by first generation skinheads were filtered through punk and new wave in a style known as 2 Tone. Within these new musical movements, the skinhead subculture diversified, and contemporary skinhead fashions ranged from the original clean-cut 1960s mod- and rude boy-influenced styles to less-strict punk-influenced styles.\nDuring the early 1980s, political affiliations grew in significance and split the subculture, demarcating the far-right and far-left strands, although many skins described themselves as apolitical. In Great Britain, the skinhead subculture became associated in the public eye with membership of groups such as the far-right National Front and British Movement. By the 1990s, neo-Nazi skinhead movements existed across all of Europe and North America, but were counterbalanced by the presence of groups such as Skinheads Against Racial Prejudice (SHARP) which sprung up in response. To this day, the skinhead subculture reflects a broad spectrum of political beliefs, even as many continue to embrace it as a largely apolitical working class movement.\nHistory.\nOrigins and first wave.\nIn the late 1950s the post-war economic boom led to an increase in disposable income among many young people. Some of those youths spent that income on new fashions; they wore ripped clothes and would use pieces of material to patch them up as popularised by American soul groups, British R&amp;B bands, certain film actors, and Carnaby Street clothing merchants. These youths became known as mods, a youth subculture noted for its consumerism and devotion to fashion, music, and scooters.\nWorking class mods chose practical clothing styles that suited their lifestyle and employment circumstances: work boots or army boots, straight-leg jeans or Sta-Prest trousers, button-down shirts, and braces. When possible, these working class mods spent their money on suits and other sharp outfits to wear at dancehalls, where they enjoyed soul, ska, and rocksteady music.\nAround 1966, a schism developed between the \"peacock mods\" (also known as \"smooth mods\"), who were less violent and always wore the latest expensive clothes, and the \"hard mods\" (also known as \"gang mods\", \"lemonheads\" or \"peanuts\"), who were identified by their shorter hair and more working class image. \"Hard mods\" became commonly known as skinheads by about 1968. Their short hair may have come about for practical reasons, since long hair could be a liability in industrial jobs and streetfights. Skinheads may also have cut their hair short in defiance of the more middle class hippie culture.\nIn addition to retaining many mod influences, early skinheads were very interested in Jamaican rude boy styles and culture, especially the music: ska, rocksteady, and early reggae (before the tempo slowed down and lyrics became focused on topics like black nationalism and the Rastafari movement).\nSkinhead culture became so popular by 1969 that even the rock band Slade temporarily adopted the look as a marketing strategy. The subculture gained wider notice because of a series of violent and sexually explicit novels by Richard Allen, notably \"Skinhead\" and \"Skinhead Escapes\". Due to largescale British migration to Perth, Western Australia, many British youths in that city joined skinhead/sharpies gangs in the late 1960s and developed their own Australian style.\nBy the early 1970s, the skinhead subculture started to fade from popular culture, and some of the original skins dropped into new categories, such as the \"suedeheads\" (defined by the ability to manipulate one's hair with a comb), \"smoothies\" (often with shoulder-length hairstyles), and \"bootboys\" (with mod-length hair; associated with gangs and football hooliganism). Some fashion trends returned to the mod roots, with brogues, loafers, suits, and the slacks-and-sweater look making a comeback.\nSecond wave.\nIn the late 1970s, the skinhead subculture was revived to a notable extent after the introduction of punk rock. Most of these revivalist skinheads reacted to the commercialism of punk by adopting a look that was in line with the original 1969 skinhead style. This revival included Gary Hodges and Hoxton Tom McCourt (both later of the band the 4-Skins) and Suggs, later of the band Madness. Around this time, some skinheads became affiliated with far right groups such as the National Front and the British Movement. From 1979 onwards, punk-influenced skinheads with shorter hair, higher boots and less emphasis on traditional styles grew in numbers and grabbed media attention, mostly due to football hooliganism. There still remained, however, skinheads who preferred the original mod-inspired styles.\nEventually different interpretations of the skinhead subculture expanded beyond Britain and continental Europe. In the United States, certain segments of the hardcore punk scene embraced skinhead styles and developed their own version of the subculture.\nBill Osgerby has argued that skinhead culture more broadly grows strength from specific economic circumstances. In a BBC interview, he remarked \"In the late 70s and early 80s, working class culture was disintegrating through unemployment and inner city decay and there was an attempt to recapture a sense of working class solidarity and identity in the face of a tide of social change.\"\nGermany.\nBy the 1980s street fights regularly broke out in West Germany between skinheads and members of the anti-fascist, and left wing youth movements. German neo-nazis, led among others by Michael K\u00fchnen, sought to expand their ranks with new young members from the burgeoning skinhead scene. On the other side of the Berlin Wall, in East Germany, the skinhead youth movement had developed two different styles: one was more focused on rebellious youth fashion styles while the other camp often dressed in regular clothes and focused more heavily on political activity. These groups were infiltrated by agents of the Stasi and did not last long in East Germany. After a group of skinheads attacked a punk concert at Zion's Church (East Berlin) in 1987, many skinhead leaders fled to West Germany to avoid arrest.\nStyle.\nClothing.\nSkinheads wore long-sleeve or short-sleeve button-down shirts or polo shirts by brands such as Ben Sherman, Muses Cuya, Fred Perry, Brutus, Warrior or Jaytex; Lonsdale or Everlast shirts or sweatshirts; Grandfather shirts; V-neck sweaters; sleeveless sweaters (known in the UK as a \"tank top\"); cardigan sweaters or T-shirts (plain or with text or designs related to the skinhead subculture). They might wear fitted blazers, Harrington jackets, bomber jackets, denim jackets (usually blue, sometimes spattered with bleach), donkey jackets, Crombie-style overcoats, sheepskin \u00be-length coats, short macs, monkey jackets or parkas. Traditional (\"hard mod\") skinheads sometimes wore suits, often of two-tone 'Tonik' fabric (shiny mohair-like material that changes colour in different light and angles), or in a Prince of Wales or houndstooth check pattern.\nMany skinheads wore Sta-Prest flat-fronted slacks or other dress trousers; jeans (normally Levi's, Lee or Wrangler); or combat trousers (plain or camouflage). Jeans and slacks were worn deliberately short (either hemmed, rolled or tucked) to show off boots, or to show off bright coloured socks when wearing loafers or brogues. Jeans were often blue, with a parallel leg design, hemmed or with clean and thin rolled cuffs (turn-ups), and were sometimes splattered with bleach to resemble camouflage trousers (a style popular among Oi! skinheads).\nMany traditionalist skinheads wore braces (suspenders), in various colours, usually no more than 1\" in width, clipped to the trouser waistband. In some areas, braces much wider than that may identify a skinhead as either unfashionable or as a white power skinhead. Traditionally, braces were worn up in an X shape at the back, but some Oi!-oriented skinheads wore their braces hanging down. Patterned braces \u2013 often black and white check, or vertical stripes \u2013 were sometimes worn by traditional skinheads. In a few cases, the colour of braces or flight jackets were used to signify affiliations. The particular colours chosen have varied regionally, and had totally different meanings in different areas and time periods. Only skinheads from the same area and time period are likely to interpret the colour significations accurately. The practice of using the colour clothing items to indicate affiliations became less common, particularly among traditionalist skinheads, who were more likely to choose their colours simply for fashion.\nHats common among skinheads include: Trilby hats; pork pie hats; flat caps (\"Scally caps\" or \"driver caps\"), winter woollen hats (without a bobble). Less common have been bowler hats (mostly among suedeheads and those influenced by the film \"A Clockwork Orange\").\nTraditionalist skinheads sometimes wore a silk handkerchief in the breast pocket of a Crombie-style overcoat or tonic suit jacket, in some cases fastened with an ornate stud. Some wore pocket flashes instead. These are pieces of silk in contrasting colours, mounted on a piece of cardboard and designed to look like an elaborately folded handkerchief. It was common to choose the colours based on one's favourite football club. Some skinheads wore button badges or sewn-on fabric patches with designs related to affiliations, interests or beliefs. Also popular were woollen or printed rayon scarves in football club colours, worn knotted at the neck, wrist, or hanging from a belt loop at the waist. Silk or faux-silk scarves (especially Tootal brand) with paisley patterns were also sometimes worn. Some suedeheads carried closed umbrellas with sharpened tips, or a handle with a pull-out blade. This led to the nickname \"brollie boys\".\nFemale skinheads, (who are sometimes called skinbyrds or skingirls,) generally wore the same clothing items as men, with addition of skirts, stockings, or dress suits composed of a three-quarter-length jacket and matching short skirt. Some skingirls wore fishnet stockings and mini-skirts, a style introduced during the punk-influenced skinhead revival.\nFootwear.\nMost skinheads wear boots; in the 1960s army surplus or generic workboots, later Dr. Martens boots and shoes. In 1960s Britain, steel-toe boots worn by skinheads and hooligans were called bovver boots; whence skinheads have themselves sometimes been called \"bovver boys\". Skinheads have also been known to wear brogues, loafers or Dr. Martens (or similarly styled) low shoes.\nIn recent years, other brands of boots, such as Solovair, Tredair Grinders, and Gripfast have become popular among skinheads, partly because most Dr. Martens are no longer made in England. Football-style athletic shoes, by brands such as Adidas or Gola, have become popular with many skinheads. Female or child skinheads generally wear the same footwear as men, with the addition of monkey boots. The traditional brand for monkey boots was Grafters, but nowadays they are also made by Dr. Martens and Solovair.\nIn the early days of the skinhead subculture, some skinheads chose boot lace colours based on the football team they supported. Later, some skinheads (particularly highly political ones) began to use lace colour to indicate beliefs or affiliations. The particular colours chosen have varied regionally, and have had totally different meanings in different areas and time periods. Only skinheads from the same area and time period are likely to interpret the colour significations accurately. This practice has become less common, particularly among traditionalist skinheads, who are more likely to choose their colours simply for fashion purposes.\nSuedeheads sometimes wore coloured socks (for example, red or blue rather than black or white).\nMusic.\nThe skinhead subculture was originally associated with black music genres such as soul, ska, R&amp;B, rocksteady, and early reggae. The link between skinheads and Jamaican music led to the UK popularity of groups such as Desmond Dekker, Derrick Morgan, Laurel Aitken, Symarip and The Pioneers. In the early 1970s, some reggae songs began to feature themes of black nationalism, which many white skinheads could not relate to. This shift in reggae's lyrical themes created some tension between black and white skinheads, who otherwise got along fairly well. Around this time, some suedeheads (an offshoot of the skinhead subculture) started listening to British glam rock bands such as Sweet, Slade and Mott the Hoople.\nThe most popular music style for late-1970s skinheads was 2 Tone, a fusion of ska, rocksteady, reggae, pop and punk rock. The 2 Tone genre was named after 2 Tone Records, a Coventry record label that featured bands such as The Specials, Madness and The Selecter. Some late-1970s skinheads also liked certain punk rock bands, such as Sham 69 and Menace.\nIn the late 1970s, after the first wave of punk rock, many skinheads embraced Oi!, a working class punk subgenre. Musically, Oi! combines standard punk with elements of football chants, pub rock and British glam rock. The Oi! scene was partly a response to a sense that many participants in the early punk scene were, in the words of The Business guitarist Steve Kent, \"trendy university people using long words, trying to be artistic ... and losing touch\". The term Oi! as a musical genre is said to come from the band Cockney Rejects and journalist Garry Bushell, who championed the genre in \"Sounds\" magazine. Not exclusively a skinhead genre, many Oi! bands included skins, punks and people who fit into neither category. Notable Oi! bands of the late 1970s and early 1980s include Angelic Upstarts, Blitz, the Business, Last Resort, The Burial, Combat 84 and the 4-Skins.\nAmerican Oi! began in the 1980s, with bands such as U.S. Chaos, The Press, Iron Cross, The Bruisers and Anti-Heros. American skinheads created a link between their subculture and hardcore punk music, with bands such as Warzone, Agnostic Front, and Cro-Mags. The Oi! style has also spread to other parts of the world, and remains popular with many skinheads. Many later Oi! bands have combined influences from early American hardcore and 1970s British streetpunk.\nAmong some skinheads, heavy metal is popular. Bands such as the Canadian act Blasphemy, whose guitarist is Black, has been known to popularise and merchandise the phrase \"black metal skinheads\". As the group's vocalist recounts, \"a lot of black metal skinheads from the other side of Canada\" would join in on the British Columbian black metal underground. \"I remember one guy... who had 'Black Metal Skins' tattooed on his forehead. We didn't hang out with white power skinheads, but there were some Oi skinheads who wanted to hang out with us.\" National Socialist black metal has an audience among white power skinheads. Black metal pioneer and right-wing extremist Varg Vikernes was known to adopt a skinhead look and wear a belt with the SS insignia while serving time in prison for the arson of several stave churches and the murder of \u00d8ystein Aarseth.\nAlthough many white power skinheads listened to Oi! music, they developed a separate genre more in line with their politics: Rock Against Communism (RAC). The most notable RAC band was Skrewdriver, which started out as a non-political punk band but evolved into a neo-Nazi band after the first lineup broke up and a new lineup was formed. RAC started out musically similar to Oi! and punk, but has since adopted elements from other genres. White power music that draws inspiration from hardcore punk is sometimes called hatecore.\nRacism, anti-racism, and politics.\nThe early skinheads were not necessarily part of any political movement, but as the 1970s progressed, many skinheads became more politically active and acts of racially-motivated skinhead violence began to occur in the United Kingdom. As a result of this change within the skinheads, far right groups such as the National Front and the British Movement saw a rise in the number of white power skinheads among their ranks. By the late 1970s, the mass media, and subsequently the general public, had largely come to view the skinhead subculture as one that promotes racism and neo-Nazism. The white power and neo-Nazi skinhead subculture eventually spread to North America, Europe and other areas of the world. The mainstream media started using the term \"skinhead\" in reports of racist violence (regardless of whether the perpetrator was actually a skinhead); this has played a large role in skewing public perceptions about the subculture. Three notable groups that formed in the 1980s and which later became associated with white power skinheads are White Aryan Resistance, Blood and Honour and Hammerskins.\nDuring the late 1970s and early 1980s, however, many skinheads and suedeheads in the United Kingdom rejected both the far left and the far right. This attitude was musically typified by Oi! bands such as Cockney Rejects, The 4-Skins, Toy Dolls, and The Business. Two notable groups of skinheads that spoke out against neo-Nazism and political extremism\u2014and instead spoke out in support of traditional skinhead culture\u2014were the Glasgow Spy Kids in Scotland (who coined the phrase \"Spirit of '69\"), and the publishers of the \"Hard As Nails\" zine in England.\nIn the late 1960s, some skinheads in the United Kingdom (including black skinheads) engaged in violence against South Asian immigrants (an act known as \"Paki bashing\" in common slang). There had, however, also been anti-racist skinheads since the beginning of the subculture, especially in Scotland and Northern England.\nOn the far left of the skinhead subculture, redskins and anarchist skinheads take a militant anti-fascist and pro-working class stance. The phrase \"all cops are bastards\" was popularized among some skinheads by The 4-Skins's 1982 song \"A.C.A.B.\" In the United Kingdom, two groups with significant numbers of leftist skinhead members were Red Action, which started in 1981, and Anti-Fascist Action, which started in 1985. Internationally, the most notable skinhead organization is Skinheads Against Racial Prejudice, which formed in the New York City area in 1987 and then spread to other countries.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Other names for sorrel include spinach dock and narrow-leaved dock (\"dock\" being a common name for the genus \"Rumex\").\nSorrel is native to Eurasia and a common plant in grassland habitats. It is often cultivated as a leaf vegetable or herb.\nDescription.\nSorrel is a slender herbaceous perennial plant about high, with roots that run deep into the ground, as well as juicy stems and arrow-shaped (sagittate) leaves which grow from a rosette. The lower leaves are in length with long petioles and a membranous ocrea formed of fused, sheathing stipules. The upper leaves are sessile, (growing directly from the stem without a petiole) and frequently become crimson. It has whorled spikes of reddish-green flowers, which bloom in early summer, becoming purplish. The species is dioecious, with stamens and pistils on different plants.\nSubspecies.\nSeveral subspecies have been named. Not all are cultivated.\nDistribution and habitat.\n\"Rumex acetosa\" occurs in grassland habitats throughout Europe from the northern Mediterranean coast to the north of Scandinavia and in parts of Central Asia. It occurs as an introduced species in parts of New Zealand, Australia, and North America. It can grow in poor soil.\nEcology.\nThe leaves are eaten by the larvae of several species of Lepidoptera (butterfly and moth) including the blood-vein moth, aphids and by non-specialized snails and slugs.\nUses.\nCommon sorrel has been cultivated for centuries. The leaves are edible when young but toughen with age; they may be pur\u00e9ed in soups and sauces or added to salad. The young shoots are edible as well, these and the leaves both being high in vitamin C and having a lemony flavor.\nIn India, the leaves are used in soups or curries made with yellow lentils and peanuts. In Afghanistan, the leaves are coated in a wet batter and deep fried, then served as an appetizer or if in season during Ramadan, for breaking the fast. In Armenia, the leaves are collected in spring, woven into braids, and dried for use during winter. The most common preparation is \"aveluk\" soup, where the leaves are rehydrated and rinsed to reduce bitterness, then stewed with onions, potatoes, walnuts, garlic and bulgur wheat or lentils, and sometimes sour plums.\nThroughout eastern Europe, wild or garden sorrel is used to make sour soups, stewed with vegetables or herbs, meat or eggs. In rural Greece, it is used with spinach, leeks, and chard in spanakopita.\n\"Escalope de saumon \u00e0 l'oseille\" (salmon escalope in sorrel sauce), invented in 1962 by the Troisgros brothers, is an emblematic dish of French nouvelle cuisine. French cuisine traditionally cooks fish with sorrel because its acidity dissolves thin fish bones.\nIn the Caribbean, the term \"sorrel\" refers to a type of sweet hibiscus tea commonly made from the African roselle flower, unrelated to the Eurasian sorrel herb.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "27184", "revid": "29997566", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27184", "title": "Swiss German", "text": "Alemannic dialects spoken in Switzerland\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Infobox/styles-images.css\" /&gt;\nSwiss German (Standard German: , , and others; ) is any of the Alemannic dialects spoken in the German-speaking part of Switzerland, and in some Alpine communities in Northern Italy bordering Switzerland. Occasionally, the Alemannic dialects spoken in other countries are grouped together with Swiss German as well, especially the dialects of Liechtenstein and Austrian Vorarlberg, which are closely associated to Switzerland's.\nLinguistically, Alemannic is divided into Low, High and Highest Alemannic, varieties all of which are spoken both inside and outside Switzerland. The only exception within German-speaking Switzerland is the municipality of Samnaun, where a Bavarian dialect is spoken. The reason Swiss German dialects constitute a special group is their almost unrestricted use as a spoken language in practically all situations of daily life, whereas the use of the Alemannic dialects in other countries is restricted or even endangered.\nThe dialects that comprise Swiss German must not be confused with Swiss Standard German, the variety of Standard German used in Switzerland. Swiss Standard German is fully intelligible to all speakers of Standard German, and is one of three major standards of German today. While Swiss Standard German is internationally easily intelligible, many people in Germany \u2013 especially in the north \u2013 do not understand non-standard Swiss German. An interview with a Swiss German speaker, when shown on television in Germany, generally requires subtitles. Although Swiss German is the native language in the German-speaking part of Switzerland, Swiss school students are taught Swiss Standard German from the age of six. They are thus capable of understanding, writing and speaking Standard German, with varying abilities.\nUse.\nUnlike most regional languages in modern Europe, Swiss German is the everyday spoken language for the majority of the population, in all social strata, from urban centers to the countryside. Using Swiss German conveys neither social nor educational inferiority and is done with pride. There are a few settings where speaking Standard German is demanded or polite, e.g., in education (but not during breaks in school lessons, where the teachers will speak with students in Swiss German), in multilingual parliaments (the federal parliaments and a few cantonal and municipal ones), in the main news broadcast or in the presence of non-Alemannic speakers. This situation has been called a \"medial diglossia\", since the spoken language is mainly Swiss German, whereas the written language is mainly (the Swiss variety of) Standard German.\nIn 2014, about 87% of the people living in the German-speaking portion of Switzerland were using Swiss German in their everyday lives.\nSwiss German is intelligible to speakers of other Alemannic dialects, but largely unintelligible to speakers of Standard German who lack adequate prior exposure. This is also a challenge for French- or Italian-speaking Swiss who learn Standard German at school. In the rare cases that Swiss German is heard on TV in Germany and Austria, the speaker is most likely to be dubbed or subtitled. More commonly, a Swiss speaker will speak Standard German on non-Swiss media.\n\"Dialect rock\" is a music genre using the language; many Swiss rock bands, however, sing in English instead.\nThe Swiss Amish of Adams County, Indiana, and their daughter settlements also use a form of Swiss German.\nVariation and distribution.\nSwiss German is a regional or political umbrella term, not a linguistic unity. For all Swiss-German dialects, there are idioms spoken outside Switzerland that are more closely related to them than to some other Swiss-German dialects. The main linguistic divisions within Swiss German are those of Low, High and Highest Alemannic, and mutual intelligibility across those groups is almost fully seamless, despite some differences in vocabulary. Low Alemannic is only spoken in the northernmost parts of Switzerland, in Basel and around Lake Constance. High Alemannic is spoken in most of the Swiss Plateau, and is divided into an eastern and a western group. Highest Alemannic is spoken in the Alps.\nOne can separate each dialect into numerous local subdialects, sometimes down to a resolution of individual villages. Speaking the dialect is an important part of regional, cantonal and national identities. In the more urban areas of the Swiss plateau, regional differences are fading due to increasing mobility and to a growing population of non-Alemannic background. Despite the varied dialects, the Swiss can still understand one another, but may particularly have trouble understanding Walliser dialects.\nHistory.\nMost Swiss German dialects have completed the High German consonant shift; exceptions are all \"Highest Alemanic\" dialects. Unlike Standard German, which has only shifted \"t\" to or and \"p\" to or , they have also shifted \"k\" to or ; the dialects of Chur and Basel are exceptions to this particular difference. Basel German is a \"Low Alemannic\" dialect (mostly spoken in Germany near the Swiss border), and Chur German is basically \"High Alemannic\" without initial or .\nExamples:\nThe High German consonant shift occurred between the 4th and 9th centuries south of the Benrath line, separating High German from Low German (where \"high\" refers to areas of greater altitude). It combines Upper German and Central German varieties - also referring to their geographical locations.\nThe Walser migration, which took place in the 12th and 13th centuries, spread varieties from upper Valais to the east and south, into Grisons and to modern western Austria and northern Italy. Informally, a distinction is made between the German-speaking people living in Valais, the \"Walliser\", and those who have migrated, the \"Walsers\". The latter can mainly be found in Grisons and Ticino in Switzerland, Vorarlberg in Austria, south of the Monte Rosa mountain chain in Italy (e.g. in Issime in Valle d'Aosta), South Tyrol in northern Italy, and the Allg\u00e4u in Bavaria).\nGenerally, the Walser communities were situated on higher alpine regions, so were able to stay independent of the ruling forces of those days, who did not or were not able to oversee them all the time in these hostile environments. Hence the Walsers were pioneers of the liberation from serfdom and feudalism. In addition, Walser villages are easily distinguishable from Grisonian ones, as Walser houses are made of wood rather than stone.\nPhonology.\nConsonants.\nLike most other Southern German dialects, Swiss German dialects have no voiced obstruents. The voiceless lenis obstruents are often marked with the IPA diacritic for voicelessness as . Swiss German are not aspirated. Nonetheless, there is an opposition of consonant pairs such as and or and . Traditionally, it has been described as a distinction of fortis and lenis in the original sense, that is, distinguished by articulatory strength or tenseness. Alternatively, it has been claimed to be a distinction of quantity.\nAspirated have secondarily developed by combinations of prefixes with word-initial or by borrowings from other languages (mainly Standard German): 'keep' (standard German ); 'tea' (standard German ); 'salary' (standard German ). In the dialects of Basel and Chur, aspirated is also present in native words, corresponding to the affricate of the other dialects, which does not occur in Basel or Chur.\nSwiss German keeps the fortis\u2013lenis opposition at the end of words. There can be minimal pairs such as 'straight' and 'ar\u00eate' or \"bis\" 'be (imp.)' and 'bite'. That distinguishes Swiss German and Swiss Standard German from German Standard German, which neutralizes the fortis\u2013lenis opposition at the ends of words. The phenomenon is usually called final-obstruent devoicing even though, in the case of German, phonetic voice may not be involved.\nUnlike Standard German, Swiss German does not have the allophone but is typically , with allophones . The typical Swiss shibboleth features this sound: ('kitchen cupboard'), pronounced .\nMost Swiss German dialects have gone through the Alemannic \"n\"-apocope, which has led to the loss of final \"-n\" in words such as 'garden' (standard German ) or 'to make' (standard German ). In some Highest Alemannic dialects, the \"n\"-apocope has also been effective in consonant clusters, for instance in 'horn' (High Alemannic ) or 'to think' (High Alemannic ). Only the Highest Alemannic dialects of the L\u00f6tschental and of the Haslital have preserved the -\"n\".\nThe phoneme is pronounced as an alveolar trill in many dialects, but some dialects, especially in the Northeast or in the Basel region, have a uvular trill , and other allophones resulting in fricatives and an approximant as [] like in many German varieties of Germany.\nIn many varieties of Bernese German and adjacent dialects, an at the syllable coda and intervocalic are pronounced as a or respectively.\nA labiodental approximant is used instead of the Northern Standard German fricative as the reflex of Middle High German . In Walser German, the fricative is used instead.\nVowels.\nMost Swiss German dialects have rounded front vowels, unlike other High German dialects. Only in Low Alemannic dialects of northwestern Switzerland (mainly Basel) and in Walliser dialects have rounded front vowels been unrounded. In Basel, rounding is being reintroduced because of the influence of other Swiss German dialects.\nLike Bavarian dialects, Swiss German dialects have preserved the opening diphthongs of Middle High German: : in 'lovely' (standard German but pronounced ); 'hat' (standard German ); 'cool' (Standard German ). Some diphthongs have become unrounded in several dialects. In the Z\u00fcrich dialect, there traditionally exists a separate \"phonemic\" series of near-close vowels /\u026a/, /\u028f/ and /\u028a/ contrasting with /i/, /y/ and /u/ (as shown by minimal pairs such as [t\u028f:r] 'dry' vs [ty:r] 'expensive'), but this contrast is in the process of being lost. Short pronunciations of // are realized slightly more openly than the long ones, but the difference is so small that it is appropriate to indicate it only in narrow transcription and only with an opening diacritic rather than by separate symbols such as [\u026a], [\u028f], [\u028a]. Sounds like the monophthong can frequently become unrounded to among many speakers of the Z\u00fcrich dialect. Vowels such as a centralized [] and an open-mid [] only occur in the Bernese dialect.\nLike in Low German, most Swiss German dialects have preserved the old West-Germanic monophthongs : 'arrow' (Standard German ); 'belly' (Standard German ); 'pillar' (Standard German ). A few Alpine dialects show diphthongization, like in Standard German, especially some dialects of Unterwalden and Schanfigg (Graub\u00fcnden) and the dialect of Issime (Piedmont).\nSome Western Swiss German dialects like Bernese German have preserved the old diphthongs , but the other dialects have like Standard German or . Z\u00fcrich German, and some other dialects distinguish primary diphthongs from secondary ones that arose in hiatus: Z\u00fcrich German from Middle High German versus Z\u00fcrich German from Middle High German ; Z\u00fcrich German 'leg, woman' from Middle High German \",\" versus Z\u00fcrich German 'free, building' from Middle High German \",\" .\nSuprasegmentals.\nIn many Swiss German dialects, consonant length and vowel length are independent from each other, unlike other modern Germanic languages. Here are examples from Bernese German:\nLexical stress is more often on the first syllable than in Standard German, even in French loans like or 'thanks' (despite stress falling on the final syllable in French). However, there are many different stress patterns, even within dialects. Bernese German has many words that are stressed on the first syllable: 'casino' while Standard German has . However, no Swiss German dialect is as consistent as Icelandic in that respect.\nGrammar.\nThe grammar of Swiss dialects has some idiosyncratic features in comparison to Standard German:\nReduplication verbs.\nOverview.\nIn Swiss German, a small number of verbs reduplicate in a reduced infinitival form, i.e. unstressed shorter form, when used in their finite form governing the infinitive of another verb. The reduced and reduplicated part of the verb in question is normally put in front of the infinitive of the second verb. This is the case for the motion verbs 'to go' and 'to come' when used in the meaning of 'go (to) do something', 'come (to) do something', as well as the verbs 'to let' and in certain dialects 'to start, to begin' when used in the meaning of 'let do something', or 'start doing something'. Most affected by this phenomenon is the verb , followed by '. Both ' and \" are less affected and only when used in present tense declarative main clauses.\nDeclarative sentence examples: \nAs the examples show, all verbs are reduplicated with a reduced infinitival form when used in a declarative main clause. This is especially interesting as it stands in contrast to the standard variety of German and other varieties of the same, where such doubling effects are not found as outlined in the examples.\n: weakest doubling effects.\nReduplication effects are weaker in the verbs 'to let' and 'to start, to begin' than they are in 'to go' and 'to come'. This means that \" is most likely to be used without its reduplicated and reduced form while retaining grammaticality, whereas utterances with \"goo\" are least likely to remain grammatical without the reduplicated part.\nBetween ' and ', these effects are weakest in '. This means that while reduplication is mandatory for ' in declarative main clauses almost everywhere in the country, this is the case for fewer varieties of Swiss German with '. The reason for this is unknown, but it has been hypothesized that the fact that \"afaa\" has a separable prefix (\"a\"-) might weaken its doubling capacity. The presence of this separable prefix also makes the boundaries between the reduced infinitival reduplication form and the prefix hard if not impossible to determine. Thus, in the example above for ', an argument could be made that the prefix a- is left off, while the full reduplicated form is used:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIn this case, the prefix would be omitted, which is normally not permissible for separable prefixes, and in its place, the reduplication form is used.\nMeanwhile, \"\" is not reduplicated when used in a subordinate clause or in the past tense. In such instances, doubling would result in ungrammaticality:\nPast tense example with :\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe same is true for subordinate clauses and the verb \"\":\nSubordinate clause examples with :\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIn order to achieve grammaticality in both instances, the reduced doubling part would have to be taken out.\nand optionality of reduplication.\nWhile ' 'to start, to begin' is quite restricted when it comes to reduplication effects, the phenomenon is more permissive, but not mandatory in the verb 'to let'. While present tense declarative sentences are generally ungrammatical when ' remains unduplicated, this is not true for past tense and subordinate clauses, where doubling effects are optional at best:\nPast tense example with \"\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSubordinate clause example with \"\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIn the use of this form, there are both geographical and age differences. Reduplication is found more often in the western part of Switzerland than in the eastern part, while younger generations are much more inclined to leave out reduplication, which means that the phenomenon is more widespread in older generations.\nand : stronger reduplication.\nUngrammaticality in reduplication of 'to start, to begin' in the past tense and in subordinate clauses as well as the somewhat more lenient use of reduplication with ' 'to let' stand in contrast to doubling effects of the motion verbs ' 'to go' and 'to come'. When the latter two verbs are used in other utterances other than a declarative main clause, where the finite verb traditionally is in second position, their use might not be mandatory; however, it is correct and grammatical to double them both in the past tense and in subordinate clauses:\nPast tense example with and :\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAs outlined in both examples, the reduplicated form of both and can but does not have to be used in order for the past tense sentences to be grammatical.Notably, it is the reduced form of both verbs that is necessary, not the full participle form.\nSubordinate clause examples for and :\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIn subordinate clauses, the reduplicated part is needed as the sentence would otherwise be ungrammatical in both ' and '.\nThe same is true for the past tense. Since there is only one past tense in Swiss German and since this is formed using an auxiliary verb \u2013 'to be' or 'to have', depending on the main verb \u2013 reduplication seems to be affected and therefore, less strictly enforced for ' and ', while it is completely ungrammatical for and optional for respectively.\nQuestions.\nQuestions behave a lot like their declarative counterparts, and reduplication is therefore mandatory for both motion verbs ' 'to go' and ' 'to come', while ' 'to let' and ' 'to start, to begin' show weaker doubling effects and more optionality. Furthermore, this is the case for both open and close (yes/no) questions. Consider the following examples:\n in open and close questions:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\nJust like in declarative forms, could be reduced to \"a-\" and thus be considered the detachable prefix. In this case, \"\" would no longer be a reduplicated verb, and that is where the language development seems to move towards.\n in open and close questions: \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\n and especially , however, do not allow for their reduced doubling part to be left out in questions, irrespective of the fact whether they are open or close:\n in open and close questions:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\n in open and close questions:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\nImperative mood.\nIn the imperative mood, just like in questions, 'to go' and 'come' are very strict in their demand for doubling. The same is true for 'to let'; it is ungrammatical to use it in imperative mood undoubled. On the other hand, leaves a lot more room for the speaker to play with. Speakers accept both sentences with only the detachable prefix and no doubling, and sentences with the full doubled form.\nImperative mood: \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\nImperative mood: \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\nImperative mood: \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\nImperative mood: \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCross-doubling with and.\nIn the case of the verb 'to come', there are situations when instead of it being reduplicated with its reduced form , the doubled short form of 'to go', , is used instead. This is possible in almost all instances of ', regardless of mood or tense. The examples below outline ' reduplicated with both its reduced form ' and the reduced form of ', \"\", in different sentence forms.\nDeclarative main clause, present tense\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\nDeclarative main clause past tense\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSubordinate clause\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\nImperative mood\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\nMultiple reduplication with and.\nWith the motion verbs 'to go' and 'to come', where reduplication effects are strongest, there is some variation regarding their reduplicated or reduced forms. Thus, in some Swiss German dialects, ' will be doubled as , while will be doubled as . In some analyses, this is described as a multiple reduplication phenomenon in that the reduced infinitives or part is repeated as , providing the forms ' and \". However, these forms are used less frequently than their shorter counterparts and seem to be concentrated into a small geographic area of Switzerland.\nVocabulary.\nThe vocabulary is varied, especially in rural areas: many specialized terms have been retained, e.g., regarding cattle or weather. In the cities, much of the rural vocabulary has been lost. A Swiss German greeting is , from (Standard German \" ), loosely meaning 'God bless you'.\nMost word adoptions come from Standard German. Many of these are now so common that they have totally replaced the original Swiss German words, e.g. the words 'hill' (instead of \",\" ), 'lip' (instead of ). Others have replaced the original words only in parts of Switzerland, e.g., 'butter' (originally called in most of Switzerland). Virtually any Swiss Standard German word can be borrowed into Swiss German, always adapted to Swiss German phonology. However, certain Standard German words are never used in Swiss German, for instance 'breakfast', 'cute' or 'at home'; instead, the native words , and are used.\nSwiss dialects have quite a few words from French and Italian, which are perfectly assimilated. (ice cream) for example is pronounced in French but or in many Swiss German dialects. The French word for 'thank you', , is also used as in (lit.\u2009'thanks many times', cf. Standard German's and ). Possibly, these words are not direct adoptions from French but survivors of the once more numerous French loanwords in Standard German, many of which have fallen out of use in Germany.\nIn recent years, Swiss dialects have also taken some English words which already sound very Swiss, e.g., ('to eat', from 'food'), ('to play computer games', from \"game\") or or \u2013 ('to snowboard', from \"snowboard\"). These words are probably not direct loanwords from English but have been adopted through standard German intermediation. While most of those loanwords are of recent origin, some have been in use for decades, e.g. ('to play football', from \"shoot\").\nThere are also a few English words which are modern adoptions from Swiss German. The dishes \"m\u00fcesli\", and \"r\u00f6sti\" have become English words, as did \"loess\" (fine grain), \"flysch\" (sandstone formation), \"kepi\", \"landammann\", \"kilch\", \"schiffli\", and \"putsch\" in a political sense. The term \"bivouac\" is sometimes explained as originating from Swiss German, while printed etymological dictionaries (e.g. the German \"Kluge\" or \"Knaurs Etymological Dictionary\") derive it from Low German instead.\nOrthography.\nHistory.\nWritten forms that were mostly based on the local Alemannic varieties, thus similar to Middle High German, were only gradually replaced by the forms of New High German. This replacement took from the 15th to 18th centuries to complete. In the 16th century, the Alemannic forms of writing were considered the original, truly Swiss forms, whereas the New High German forms were perceived as foreign innovations. The innovations were brought about by the printing press and were also associated with Lutheranism. An example of the language shift is the Froschauer Bible: Its first impressions after 1524 were largely written in an Alemannic language, but since 1527, the New High German forms were gradually adopted. The Alemannic forms were longest preserved in the chancelleries, with the chancellery of Bern being the last to adopt New High German in the second half of the 18th century.\nToday all formal writing, newspapers, books and much informal writing is done in Swiss Standard German, which is usually called (written German). Certain dialectal words are accepted regionalisms in Swiss Standard German and are also sanctioned by the Duden, e.g., (afternoon snack). Swiss Standard German is virtually identical to Standard German as used in Germany, with most differences in pronunciation, vocabulary, and orthography. For example, Swiss Standard German always uses a double s (\"ss\") instead of the eszett (\"\u00df\").\nThere are no official rules of Swiss German orthography. The orthographies used in the Swiss-German literature can be roughly divided into two systems: Those that try to stay as close to standard German spelling as possible and those that try to represent the sounds as well as possible. The so-called was developed by Eugen Dieth, but knowledge of these guidelines is limited mostly to language experts. Furthermore, the spellings originally proposed by Dieth included some special signs not found on a normal keyboard, such as \u27e8\u0283\u27e9 instead of \u27e8sch\u27e9 for or \u27e8\u01dc\u27e9 instead of \u27e8\u00fc\u27e9 for . In 1986, a revised version of the \"Dieth-Schreibung\" was published, designed to be typed with a regular typewriter.\nConventions.\nA few letters are used differently from the Standard German rules:\nLiterature.\nSince the 19th century, a considerable body of Swiss German literature has accumulated. The earliest works were in Lucerne German (Jost Bernhard H\u00e4fliger, Josef Felix Ineichen), in Bernese German (Gottlieb Jakob Kuhn), in Glarus German (Cosimus Freuler) and in Z\u00fcrich German (Johann Martin Usteri, Jakob Stutz); the works of Jeremias Gotthelf which were published at the same time are in Swiss Standard German, but use many expressions of Bernese German. Some of the more important dialect writing authors and their works are:\nParts of the Bible were translated in different Swiss German dialects, e.g.:\nCinema and television.\nMany films and TV series produced in German-speaking Switzerland are filmed in Swiss German, although these are sometimes re-dubbed into Standard German for broadcast or when shown in cinemas. For instance, \"Swiss Tatort\" episodes are originally re-recorded with dialogue in dialects, usually various Swiss German dialects, or for example French or Italian, as required by the corresponding role, for broadcasting on German Swiss channels (SRF), and dubbed in Standard German spoken with a Swiss accent to preserve the local colour of the setting for broadcasting on German and Austrian channels.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;section begin=\"list-of-glossing-abbreviations\"/&gt;\nPREF:prefix\n&lt;section end=\"list-of-glossing-abbreviations\"/&gt;"}
{"id": "27188", "revid": "46850707", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27188", "title": "Snare drum", "text": "Type of percussion instrument\nThe snare drum (or side drum) is a percussion instrument that produces a sharp staccato sound when the head is struck with a drum stick, due to the use of a series of stiff wires held under tension against the lower skin. Snare drums are often used in orchestras, concert bands, marching bands, parades, drumlines, drum corps, and more. It is one of the central pieces in a drum set, a collection of percussion instruments designed to be played by a seated drummer and used in many genres of music. Because basic rhythms are very easy to learn to play on a snare drum even for children, the instrument is also suitable for the music education for young children and a rhythm band.\nSnare drums are usually played with drum sticks, but other beaters such as the brush or the rute can be used to achieve different tones. The snare drum is a versatile and expressive percussion instrument due to its sensitivity and responsiveness. The sensitivity of the snare drum allows it to respond audibly to the softest strokes, even with a wire brush. It can be used for complex rhythmic patterns and engaging solos at moderate volumes. Its high dynamic range allows the player to produce powerful accents with vigorous strokes and a loud metallic click when rimshots are used.\nThe snare drum originates from the tabor, a drum first used to accompany the flute. The tabor evolved into more modern versions, such as the kit snare (the type usually included in a drum kit), marching snare, tarol snare, and piccolo snare. Each type is a different size, and there are different playing styles associated with each of them. The snare drum that one might see in a popular music concert is usually used in a backbeat style. In marching bands, it can do the same but is used mostly for a front beat. In comparison with the marching snare, the kit snare is generally smaller in length, while the piccolo is the smallest of the three. The snare drum is easily recognizable by its loud cracking sound when struck firmly with a drumstick or mallet. The depth of the sound varies from one drum to another because of the different techniques and construction qualities of the drum. Some of these qualities are head material and tension, dimensions, and rim and drum shell materials and construction.\nThe snare drum is constructed of two heads\u2014both usually made of Mylar plastic in modern drums but historically made from calf or goat skin\u2014along with a rattle of beads (metal, plastic, nylon, or gut) called \"snares\" in close contact with it, on the bottom head, which vibrate when the drum is struck. The snares can also be on the top, as in the tarol snare drum, or on both heads as in the case of the Highland snare drum. The top head is typically called the batter head because that is where the drummer strikes it; the bottom head can also be called the snare head (if the snares are located there). The tension of each head is held constant by tension rods. Tension rod adjustment allows the pitch and tonal character of the drum to be customized by the player. Most snare drums have a lever (the strainer) to engage or disengage contact between the snares and the head, and which also permits adjustment of the snare tension. When the snares are disengaged, the sound of the drum resembles a Floor tom. The rim is the metal or wooden ring around the batter head that holds the head onto the drum and provides tension to the head; the rim can also be used in some playing techniques, notably the rimshot, in which the head and rim are struck together with a single stick to create a clicking, or tapping sound.\nPlaying.\nWhen the top head is struck, the bottom (resonant) head vibrates in tandem, which in turn stimulates the snares and produces a cracking sound.\nThe drum can be played by striking it with a drum stick or any other form of beater, including brushes, rute and hands, all of which produce a softer-sounding vibration from the snare wires. When using a stick, the drummer may strike the head of the drum, the rim (counterhoop), or the shell.\nThe snares can be thrown off (disengaged) with a lever on the strainer so that the drum produces a sound reminiscent of a tom-tom. Rimshots are a technique associated with snare drums in which the head and rim are struck simultaneously with one stick (or in orchestral concert playing, a stick placed on the head and the rim struck by the opposite stick). In contemporary and/or pop and rock music, where the snare drum is used as a part of a drum kit, many of the backbeats and accented notes on the snare drum are played as rimshots, due to the ever-increasing demand for their typical sharp and high-volume sound.\nA commonly used alternative way to play the snare drum is known as \"cross-stick\", \"rim click\", or \"side-stick\". This is done by holding the tip of the drumstick against the drum head and striking the stick's other end (the butt) against the rim, using the hand to mute the head. This produces a dry high-pitched click, similar to a set of claves, and is especially common in Latin and jazz music. So-called \"ghost notes\" are very light \"filler notes\" played in between the backbeats in genres such as funk and rhythm and blues. The iconic drum roll is produced by alternately bouncing the sticks on the drum head, striving for a controlled rebound. A similar effect can be achieved by playing alternating double strokes on the drum, creating a double stroke roll, or very fast single strokes, creating a single stroke roll. The snares are a fundamental ingredient in the pressed (buzz) drum roll, as they help to blend together distinct strokes that are then perceived as a single, sustained sound. The snare drum is the first instrument to learn in preparing to play a full drum kit. Rudiments are sets of basic patterns often played on a snare drum.\nConstruction.\nSnare drums may be made from various wood, metal, acrylic, or composite, e.g., fiberglass materials. A typical diameter for snare drums is . Marching snare drums are deeper (taller) in size than snare drums normally used for orchestral or drum kit purposes, often measuring 12 in deep (tall). Orchestral and drum kit snare drum shells are about deep. Piccolo snare drums are even shallower at about deep. Soprano, popcorn, and firecracker snare drums have diameters as small as and are often used for higher-pitched special effects.\nMost wooden snare drum shells are constructed in plies (layers) that are heat- and compression-moulded into a cylinder. Steam-bent shells consist of one ply of wood that is gradually rounded into a cylinder and glued at one seam. Reinforcement rings, so-called \"re-rings\", are often incorporated on the inside surface of the drum shell to keep it perfectly round. Segment shells are made of multiple stacks of segmented wood rings. The segments are glued together and rounded out by a lathe. Similarly, stave shells are constructed of vertically glued pieces of wood into a cylinder (much like a barrel) that is also rounded out by a lathe. Solid shells are constructed of one solid piece of hollowed wood.\nThe heads or skins used are a batter head (the playing surface on the top of the drum) and a resonant (bottom) head. The resonant head is usually much thinner than the batter head and is not beaten while playing. Rather than calfskin, most modern drums use plastic (Mylar) skins of around 10 mils thickness, sometimes with multiple plies (usually two) of around 7 mils for the batter head. In addition, tone control rings or dots can be applied, either on the outer or inner surface of the head, to control overtones and ringing, and can be found positioned in the centre or close to the edge hoops or both. Resonant heads are usually only a few mils thick, to enable them to respond to the movement of the batter head as it is played. Pipe band requirements have led to the development of a Kevlar-based head, enabling very high tuning, thus producing a very high-pitched cracking snare sound.\nA new technique used to improve the sound quality during snare drum construction is symmetrical venting. In contrast to a standard single vent hole, air can easily travel through and around the instrument without getting caught. This rapid movement creates a smoother, stronger sound.\nHistory.\nThe snare drum seems to have descended from a medieval drum called the tabor, which was a drum with a single-gut snare strung across the bottom. It is a little bigger than a medium tom and was first used in war, often played with a fife (pipe); the player would play both the fife and drum (see also Pipe and tabor). Tabors were not always double-headed and not all may have had snares. By the 15th century, the size of the snare drum had increased and had a cylindrical shape. This simple drum with a simple snare became popular with the Swiss mercenary troops who used the fife and drum from the 15th to 16th centuries. The drum was made deeper and carried along the side of the body. Further developments appeared in the 17th century, with the use of screws to hold down the snares, giving a brighter sound than the rattle of a loose snare. During the 18th century, the snare drum underwent changes which improved its characteristic sound. Metal snares appeared in the 20th century. Today the snare drum is used in jazz, pop music and modern orchestral music.\nMuch of the development of the snare drum and its rudiments is closely tied to the use of the snare drum in the military. In his book, \"The Art of Snare Drumming\", Sanford A. Moeller (of the \"Moeller Method\" of drumming) states, \"To acquire a knowledge of the true nature of the [snare] drum, it is absolutely necessary to study military drumming, for it is essentially a military instrument and its true character cannot be brought out with an incorrect method. When a composer wants a martial effect, he instinctively turns to the drums.\"\nBefore the advent of radio and electronic communications, the snare drum was often used to communicate orders to soldiers. American troops were woken up by drum and fife playing about five minutes of music, for example, the well-known \"Three Camps\". Troops were called for meals by certain drum pieces, such as \"Peas on a Trencher\" or \"Roast Beef\". A piece called the \"Tattoo\" was used to signal that all soldiers should be in their tent, and the \"Fatigue Call\" was used to police the quarters or drum unruly women out of the camp.\nMany of these military pieces required a thorough grounding in rudimental drumming; indeed Moeller states that: \"They [the rudimental drummers] were the only ones who could do it [play the military camp duty pieces]\". Moeller furthermore states that \"No matter how well a drummer can read, if he does not know the rudimental system of drumming, it is impossible for him to play 'The Three Camps', 'Breakfast Call', or in fact any of the Duty except the simple beats such as 'The Troop'.\"\nDuring the late 18th and 19th century, the military bugle largely supplanted the snare and fife for signals. Most modern militaries and scouting groups use the bugle alone to make bugle calls that announce scheduled and unscheduled events of the organization (from First Call to Taps). While most modern military signals use only the bugle, the snare is still retained for some signals, for example, the Adjutant's Call.\nSnare drumheads were originally made from calfskin. The invention of the plastic (Mylar) drumhead is credited to a drummer named Marion \"Chick\" Evans, who made the first plastic drumhead in 1956.\nDrum rudiments seem to have developed with the snare drum; the Swiss fife and drum groups are sometimes credited with their invention. The first written rudiment was drawn up in Basel, Switzerland in 1610. Rudiments with familiar names\u2014such as the single paradiddle, flam, drag, ratamacue, and double stroke roll, also called the \"ma-ma da-da\" roll\u2014are listed in Charles Ashworth's book in 1812.\nTypes.\nThere are many types of snare drums, for example:\nMarching snares are typically deep and wide. The larger design allows for a deeper-sounding tone, one that is effective for marching bands. Many marching snares are built to withstand high amounts of tension, tightened by a drum key. They are often played with a heavier and thicker stick, more commonly referred to as \"marching sticks\". Snares are often nylon or gut.\nSimilar to a marching snare, pipe band snares are deep and tuned quite tightly. The major difference is that they feature a second set of snare wires beneath the batter head, along with the normal set on the resonant head. This gives them an even more crisp and snappy sound. \nSnare drummers form an integral part of pipe bands, accompanying the bagpipes, and playing music written to fit the pipe tunes. A bass drummer and several tenor drummers, who also perform visual representations of the music, known as flourishing, add to the percussion section of a pipe band. The music played by pipe band snare drummers can be technically difficult, and requires a high degree of rudimental ability, similar to that of marching bands. Pipe Band snare normally use the traditional grip.\nDrum kit snares are usually about a third to half the depth of a marching snare. They are typically in diameter and , with depths also available. Typically uses coiled metal snare wires.\nThe piccolo snare is a type of snare used by drummers seeking a higher-pitched sound from their snare. Because the piccolo snare has a narrower depth than that of the marching snare or set snare, a higher-pitched \"pop\" is more widely associated with it. Although the piccolo snare has a more distinctive, unique sound, it has some downsides. Because of the \"sharper\" sound of the piccolo, its sound travels further and is picked up by microphones further away during recording, making it difficult to record effectively. There are many kinds of piccolo snare which can be piccolos, including the popcorn, soprano and standard snares. Popcorn snares typically have a diameter of , sopranos , and standard piccolos . A well-known user of the piccolo snare was Neil Peart, the drummer of Rush, who used a X Shell Series Piccolo.\nOrchestral snare drums usually conform to the dimensions of drum kit snares, but often have a calf skin head or a synthetic approximation of a natural head material. They also typically use snares made of metal cable, gut, synthetic cord, or nylon, with some orchestral snare strainers supporting 3 different materials simultaneously and the ability to tune each bundle of snare material independently.\nThe tabor snare dates back to around the 14th century, and was used for marching beats in wars. It is a double-headed drum with a single snare strand, and was often played along with the three-holed pipe flute. The dimensions vary with the different types of tabor. It is typically wide and around in diameter.\nThe tarol snare has similar dimensions to the kit snare. The major distinction is that the snares in this type are on the top head rather than the bottom one.\n\"Caixa\" meaning \"box\". This is a simple diameter, deep snare typical of Samba played in Southern Brasil. Made from aluminum or steel with the snare wires on top, it can be played from a sling or \"em cima\" \u2013 on the shoulder to project the sound.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "27189", "revid": "14604687", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27189", "title": "History of Saint Helena", "text": "Saint Helena has a known history of over 500 years since its recorded discovery by the Portuguese in 1502. Claiming to be Britain's second oldest colony, after Bermuda, this is one of the most remote settlements in the world and was for several centuries of vital strategic importance to ships sailing to Europe from Asia and South Africa. Since the early 19th century, the British occasionally used the island as a place of exile, most notably for Napoleon Bonaparte, Dinuzulu kaCetshwayo and over 5,000 Boer prisoners.\nDiscovery and early years, 1502\u20131658.\nBy long tradition the island was sighted on 21 May 1502 by the four ships of the 3rd Portuguese Armada commanded by Galician navigator Jo\u00e3o da Nova during the return voyage to Lisbon, and that he named it Santa Helena after Saint Helena of Constantinople. This tradition has been reviewed by a 2022 paper which concluded the Portuguese chronicles published at least 50 years later, are the sole primary source to the discovery. Although contradictory in describing other events, these chronicles almost unanimously claim Jo\u00e3o da Nova found St Helena sometime in 1502, although none quote the precise date.\nHowever, there are several reasons for doubting da Nova made this discovery. First, given that da Nova either returned on 11 September or 13 September 1502 it is usually assumed the Cantino planisphere completed by the following November includes his discovery of Ascension Island (shown as an archipelago with one of six islands marked as \"ilha achada e chamada Ascenssam\"), yet this map fails to show St Helena. Second, when a section of the Fourth Armada under the command of Est\u00eav\u00e3o da Gama sighted and landed at St Helena the following year on 30 July 1503 its scrivener Thom\u00e9 Lopes regarded it as an unknown island yet named Ascension as one of five reference points to the new island\u2019s location. On 12 July 1502, nearly three weeks before reaching St Helena, Lopes described how Est\u00eav\u00e3o da Gama\u2019s ships met up with a section of the Fifth Armada led by Afonso de Albuquerque off the Cape of Good Hope. The latter left Lisbon about six months after Jo\u00e3o da Nova\u2019s return so Albuquerque and his captains should all have known whether Jo\u00e3o da Nova had indeed found St Helena. An anonymous Flemish traveler on one of da Gama's ships reporting that bread and victuals were running short by the time they reached the Cape, so from da Gama's perspective there was a pressing need that he be told water and meat could be found at St Helena. The fact that nothing seems to have been said about the island, da Gama's scrivener Lopes regarding the island as unknown, again implies da Nova found Ascension but not St Helena. The 2022 paper also reviews cartographic evidence that St Helena and Ascension were known to the Spanish in 1500, before either Jo\u00e3o da Nova or Est\u00eav\u00e3o da Gama sailed for India. The suggestion that Jo\u00e3o da Nova discovered Tristan da Cunha naming it St Helena is discounted.\nIf Jo\u00e3o da Nova indeed found St Helena, a separate 2015 paper has reviewed another tradition that he did so on 21 May 1502. This date appears to have first been suggested by Jan Huyghen van Linschoten in a book published in Holland in 1596. This described how his ships left St Helena on 21 May 1589, this being both the feast of Saint Helena and Whitsunday. At first sight, this statement seems to be a contradiction - the Roman Catholic Church certainly celebrated Whitsunday that day but their feast-day of Saint Helena was on 18 August. Linschoten's statement did not fit in with the Eastern Orthodox Church either - this faith certainly marked Saint Helena on 21 May but in 1589 celebrated Whitsun a week later, on 28 May. The paper suggested the solution to this apparent paradox was the fact that by the time his book was published in 1596 Linschoten had converted to the Protestant Dutch Reformed Church. This faith celebrated Whitsunday on the same day as Catholics while Saint Helena was marked on 21 May, the same day as the Orthodox Church. Quite apart from the fact that the discoverers were Catholics, Linschoten failed to realise the impossibility that the island was named after a Protestant feast-day, it being found more than a decade before the Reformation and start of Protestantism. An alternative discovery date of 3 May on the Catholic feast-day celebrating the finding of the True Cross by Saint Helena in Jerusalem, as quoted by Odoardo Duarte Lopes in 1591 and by Sir Thomas Herbert in 1638, is suggested as historically more credible than the Protestant date of 21 May. The paper observes that if da Nova made the discovery on 3 May 1502, he may have been inhibited from naming the island Ilha de Vera Cruz (Island of the True Cross) because Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral had already assigned that same name to the Brazilian coastline, which he thought to be a large island, on 3 May 1500. News of Cabral's discovery reached Lisbon directly from South America before da Nova's fleet set off on the voyage to India in 1501. If da Nova knew the True Cross name had already been assigned, the most obvious and plausible alternative name for him to give the island was \"Santa Helena\".\nThe long tradition that Jo\u00e3o da Nova built a chapel from one of his wrecked carracks has been shown to be based on a misreading of the records.\nThe Portuguese found it uninhabited, with an abundance of trees and fresh water. They imported livestock (mainly goats), fruit trees, and vegetables, built a chapel and one or two houses, and left their sick, suffering from scurvy and other ailments, to be taken home, if they recovered, by the next ship, but they formed no permanent settlement. The island thereby became crucially important for the collection of food and as a rendezvous point for homebound voyages from Asia. The island was directly in line with the Trade Winds which took ships rounding the Cape of Good Hope into the South Atlantic. St\u00a0Helena was much less frequently visited by Asia-bound ships, the northern trade winds taking ships towards the South American continent rather than the island. An analysis has been published of the Portuguese ships arriving at St Helena in the period 1502\u20131613.\nIt is a popular belief that the Portuguese managed to keep the location of this remote island a secret until almost the end of the 16th century. However, both the location of the island and its name were quoted in a Dutch book in 1508, which described a 1505 Portuguese expedition led by Francisco de Almeida from the East Indies: \"\"[o]n the twenty-first day of July we saw land, and it was an island lyng six hundred and fifty miles from the Cape, and called Saint Helena, howbeit we could not land there. [...] And after we left the island of Saint Helena, we saw another island two hundred miles from there, which is called Ascension\".\" Additional references to Saint Helena as a rendezvous point were publicly documented in the early 16th century, such as the account of D\u00fcrer's Rhinoceros's voyage to Portugal in 1515.\nAlso, Lopo Homem-Reineis published the \"Atlas Universal\" about 1519 which clearly showed the locations of St\u00a0Helena and Ascension. The first residents all arrived on Portuguese vessels. Its first known permanent resident was Portuguese, Fern\u00e3o Lopes (also \"Fernando Lopes\") who had turned traitor in India and had been mutilated by order of Alphonso d'Albuquerque, the Governor of Goa. Fern\u00e3o Lopes preferred being marooned to returning to Portugal in his maimed condition, and lived on Saint Helena from about 1516. By royal command, Lopes returned to Portugal about 1526 and then travelled to Rome, where Pope Clement VII granted him an audience. Lopes returned to Saint Helena, where he died in 1545.\nWhen the island was discovered, it was covered with unique indigenous vegetation. Claims that on discovery the island \"was entirely covered with forests, the trees drooping over the tremendous precipices that overhang the sea\" have been questioned. It is argued that the presence of an endemic plover and several endemic insects adapted to the barren and arid coastal portions of the island are strong indications that these conditions existed before the island was discovered. Also, the earliest description of the island by Thome Lopez, who sighted the island on 3 July 1503, specifically states that coastal trees were absent: \". . . nor did we see any kind of trees, but it was completely green . . .\" Rather than trees, this eyewitness account suggests the presence of low-height scrub adapted to the coastal desert conditions. Nevertheless, St\u00a0Helena certainly once had a rich and dense inland forest. The loss of endemic vegetation, birds and other fauna, much of it within the first 50 years of discovery, can be attributed to the impact of humans and their introduction of goats, pigs, dogs, cats, rats as well as the introduction of non-endemic birds and vegetation into the island.\nSometime before 1557 five people (two male slaves from Mozambique, one from Java and two women) escaped from a ship and remained hidden on the island for many years, long enough for their numbers to rise to twenty. Bermudez, the Patriarch of Abyssinia landed at St\u00a0Helena in 1557 on a voyage to Portugal, remaining on the island for a year. Three Japanese ambassadors on an embassy to the Pope also visited St\u00a0Helena in 1583.\nStrong circumstantial evidence supports the idea that Sir Francis Drake located the island on the final lap of his circumnavigation of the world (1577\u20131580). It is suspected this explains how the location of the island was certainly known to the English only a few years later, for example, William Barrett (who died in 1584 as English consul at Aleppo, Syria) stated the island was \"sixteen degrees to the South\", which is precisely the correct latitude. Again, it is also clear that the Elizabethan adventurer Edward Fenton at the very least knew the approximate location of the island in 1582.\nIt therefore seems unlikely that when Thomas Cavendish arrived in 1588 during his first attempt to circumnavigate the world, he was the first Englishman to land at the island. He stayed for 12 days and described the valley (initially called Chapel Valley) where Jamestown is situated as \"\"a marvellous fair and pleasant valley, wherein divers handsome buildings and houses were set up, and especially one which was a church, which was tiled, and whitened on the outside very fair, and made with a porch, and within the church at the upper end was set an alter... This valley is the fairest and largest low plot in all the island, and it is marvellous sweet and pleasant, and planted in every place with fruit trees or with herbs... There are on this island thousands of goats, which the Spaniards call cabritos, which are very wild: you shall sometimes see one or two hundred of them together, and sometimes you may behold them going in a flock almost a mile long.\"\nAnother English seaman, Captain Abraham Kendall, visited Saint Helena in 1591, and in 1593 Sir James Lancaster stopped at the island on his way home from the East. Once St\u00a0Helena's location was more widely known, English ships of war began to lie in wait in the area to attack Portuguese India carracks on their way home. As a result, in 1592 Philip II of Spain and I of Portugal (1581\u20131598) ordered the annual fleet returning from Goa on no account to touch at St\u00a0Helena. In developing their Far East trade, the Dutch also began to frequent the island. One of their first visits was in 1598 when an expedition of two vessels piloted by John Davis (English explorer) attacked a large Spanish Caravel, only to be beaten off and forced to retreat to Ascension Island for repairs. The Italian merchant Francesco Carletti claimed in his autobiography he was robbed by the Dutch when sailing on a Portuguese ship in 1602.\nThe Portuguese and Spanish soon gave up regularly calling at the island, partly because they used ports along the West African coast, but also because of attacks on their shipping, desecration to their chapel and images, destruction of their livestock and destruction of plantations by Dutch and English sailors. In 1603 Lancaster again visited Saint Helena on his return from the first voyage equipped by the British East India Company. In 1610, by which time most Dutch and English ships visited the island on their home voyage, Fran\u00e7ois Pyrard de Laval deplored the deterioration since his last visit in 1601, describing damage to the chapel and destruction of fruit trees by cutting down trees to pick the fruit. While Thomas Best, commander of the tenth British East India Company expedition reported plentiful supplies of lemons in 1614, only 40 lemon trees were observed by the traveller Peter Mundy in 1634.\nThe Dutch Republic formally made claim to St\u00a0Helena in 1633, although there is no evidence that they ever occupied, colonised or fortified it. A Dutch territorial stone, undated but certainly later than 1633, is presently kept in the island's archive office. By 1651, the Dutch had mainly abandoned the island in favour of their colony founded at the Cape of Good Hope.\nEast India Company, 1658\u20131815.\nThe idea for the English to make claim to the island was first made in a 1644 pamphlet by Richard Boothby. By 1649, the East India Company (EIC) ordered all homeward-bound vessels to wait for one another at St\u00a0Helena and in 1656 onward the Company petitioned the government to send a man-of-war to convoy the fleet home from there. Having been granted a charter to govern the island by the Lord Protector of the Commonwealth Oliver Cromwell in 1657, the following year the Company decided to fortify and colonise St\u00a0Helena with planters. A fleet commanded by Captain John Dutton (first governor, 1659\u20131661) in the \"Marmaduke\" arrived at St\u00a0Helena in 1659. It is from this date that St\u00a0Helena claims to be Britain's second oldest colony (after Bermuda). A fort, originally named the Castle of St John, was completed within a month and further houses were built further up the valley. It soon became obvious that the island could not be made self-sufficient and in early 1658, the East India Company ordered all homecoming ships to provide one ton of rice on their arrival at the island.\nWith the restoration of the monarchy in 1660, the fort was renamed James Fort, the town Jamestown and the valley James Valley, all in honour of the Duke of York, later James II of England. The East India Company immediately sought a Royal Charter, possibly to give their occupation of St\u00a0Helena legitimacy. This was issued in 1661 and gave the Company the sole right to fortify and colonise the island \"in such legal and reasonable manner the said Governor and Company should see fit\". Each planter was allocated one of 130 pieces of land, but the Company had great difficulty attracting new immigrants, the population falling to only 66, including 18 slaves, by 1670. The long tradition that the early settlers included many who had lost their home in the 1666 Great Fire of London has been shown to be a myth. John Dutton's successors as governor, Robert Stringer (1661\u20131670) and Richard Coney (1671\u20131672), repeatedly warned the Company of unrest amongst the inhabitants, Coney complaining the inhabitants were drunks and ne\u2019er-do-wells. In 1672 Coney was seized by rebellious members of the island's council and shipped back to England. Coincidentally, the Company had already sent a replacement governor, Anthony Beale (1672\u20131673).\nFinding that the cape was not the ideal harbour they originally envisaged, the Dutch East India Company launched an armed invasion of St\u00a0Helena from the Cape colony over Christmas 1672. Governor Beale was forced to abandon the island in a Company ship, sailing to Brazil where he hired a fast ship. This he used to locate an East India Company flotilla sent to reinforce St\u00a0Helena with fresh troops. The Company retook the island in May 1673 without loss of life and reinforced it with 250 troops. The same year the Company petitioned a new Charter from Charles II of England and this granted the island free title as though it was a part of England \"in the same manner as East Greenwich in the County of Kent\". Acknowledging that St\u00a0Helena was a place where there was no trade, the Company was permitted to send from England any provisions free of Customs and to convey as many settlers as required.\nIn 1674 discontented settlers and troops seized Richard Keigwin (1673\u20131674), the next acting governor; it was only the lucky arrival of an East India Company fleet under the command of Captain William Basse that freed Keigwin. By 1675, the part-time recruitment of settlers in a Militia enabled the permanent garrison to be reduced to 50 troops. On leaving the University of Oxford, in 1676, Edmond Halley visited Saint Helena and set up an observatory with a aerial telescope and observed the positions of 341 stars in the Southern Hemisphere. His observation site is near St Mathew's Church in Hutt's Gate, in the Longwood district. The 680m high hill there is named for him and is called Halley's Mount. Amongst the most significant taxes levied on imports was a requirement for all ships trading with Madagascar to deliver one slave. Slaves were also brought from Asia by incoming shipping. Thus, most slaves came from Madagascar and Asia rather than the African mainland. By 1679, the number of slaves had risen to about 80. An uprising by soldiers and planters in 1684 during the governorship of John Blackmore (1678\u20131689) led to the death of three mutineers in an attack on Fort James and the later execution of four others. The formation of the Grand Alliance and outbreak of war against France in 1689 meant that for several years ships from Asia avoided the island for fear of being attacked by French men-of-war. Soldiers at the end of their service thereby had restricted opportunities to obtain a passage back to Britain. Governor Joshua Johnson (1690\u20131693) also prevented soldiers smuggling themselves aboard ships by ordering all outgoing ships to leave only during daylight hours. This led to a mutiny in 1693 in which a group of mutineer soldiers seized a ship and made their escape, during the course of which Governor Johnson was killed. Meanwhile, savage punishment was meted out to slaves during this period, some being burnt alive and others starved to death. Rumours of an uprising by slaves in 1694 led to the gruesome execution of three slaves and cruel punishment of many others.\nThe clearance of the indigenous forest for the distillation of spirits, tanning and agricultural development began to lead to shortage of wood by the 1680s. The numbers of rats and goats had reached plague proportions by the 1690s, leading to the destruction of food crops and young tree shoots. Neither an increase on duty on the locally produced arrack nor a duty on all firewood helped reduce the deforestation while attempts to reforest the island by governor John Roberts (1708\u20131711) were not followed up by his immediate successors. The Great Wood, which once extended from Deadwood Plain to Prosperous Bay Plain, was reported in 1710 as not having a single tree left standing. An early mention of the problems of soil erosion was made in 1718 when a waterspout broke over Sandy Bay, on the southern coast. Against the background of this erosion, several years of drought and the general dependency of St\u00a0Helena, in 1715 governor Isaac Pyke (1714\u20131719) made the serious suggestion to the Company that appreciable savings could be made by moving the population to Mauritius, evacuated by the French in 1710. However, with the outbreak of war with other European countries, the Company continued to subsidise the island because of its strategic location. An ordinance was passed in 1731 to preserve the woodlands through the reduction in the goat population. Despite the clear connection between deforestation and the increasing number of floods (in 1732, 1734, 1736, 1747, 1756 and 1787) the East India Company's Court of Directors gave little support to efforts by governors to eradicate the goat problem. Rats were observed in 1731 building nests in trees two feet across, a visitor in 1717 commenting that the vast number of wild cats preferred to live off young partridges than the rats. An outbreak of plague in 1743 was attributed to the release of infected rats from ships arriving from India. By 1757, soldiers were employed in killing the wild cats.\nWilliam Dampier called into St\u00a0Helena in 1691 at the end of his first of three circumnavigations of the world and stated Jamestown comprised 20\u201330 small houses built with rough stones furnished with mean furniture. These houses were only occupied when ships called at the island because their owners were all employed on their plantations further in the island. He described how women born on the island \"very earnestly desired to be released from that Prison, having no other way to compass this but by marrying Seamen of Passengers that touch here\"\". Dampier described the island, which he called 'Santa Hellena', in his book \"A New Voyage Round The World\", published in 1697.\nFollowing commercial rivalries between the original English East India Company and a New East India Company created in 1698, a new Company was formed in 1708 by amalgamation, and entitled the \"United Company of Merchants of England, trading to the East Indies\". St\u00a0Helena was then transferred to this new United East India Company. The same year, extensive work began to build the present Castle. Because of a lack of cement, mud was used as the mortar for many buildings, most of which had deteriorated into a state of ruin. In a search for lime on the island, a soldier in 1709 claimed to have discovered gold and silver deposits in Breakneck Valley. For a short period, it is believed that almost every able-bodied man was employed in prospecting for these precious metals. The short-lived Breakneck Valley Gold Rush ended with the results of an assay of the deposits in London, showing that they were iron pyrites.\nA census in 1723 showed that out of a total population 1,110, some 610 were slaves. In 1731, a majority of tenant planters successfully petitioned governor Edward Byfield (1727\u20131731) for the reduction of the goat population. The next governor, Isaac Pyke (1731\u20131738), had a tyrannical reputation but successfully extended tree plantations, improved fortifications and transformed the garrison and militia into a reliable force for the first time. In 1733 Green Tipped Bourbon Coffee seeds were brought from the coffee port of Mocha in Yemen, on a Company ship \"The Houghton\" and were planted at various locations around the Island where the plants flourished, despite general neglect.\nRobert Jenkins, of \"Jenkins' Ear\" fame (governor 1740\u20131742) embarked on a programme of eliminating corruption and improving the defences. The island's first hospital was built on its present site in 1742. Governor Charles Hutchinson (1747\u20131764) tackled the neglect of crops and livestock and also brought the laws of the island closer to those in England. Nevertheless, racial discrimination continued and it was not until 1787 that the black population were allowed to give evidence against whites. In 1758 three French warships were seen lying off the island in wait for the Company's India fleet. In an inconclusive battle, these were engaged by warships from the Company's China fleet. Nevil Maskelyne and Robert Waddington set up an observatory in 1761 to observe the transit of Venus, following a suggestion first made by Halley. In the event, observations were obscured by cloud. Most of the cattle were destroyed this year through an unidentified sickness.\nIn the peak era, a thousands ships per year stopped there leaving the governor to try to police the numerous visitors and to limit the consumption of arrack, made from potatoes. (The mutinies may have been fueled by alcohol.) Because Jamestown was \"too raucous with its taverns and brothels\", St Paul\u2019s Cathedral was built outside the town.\nAttempts by governor John Skottowe (1764\u20131782) to regularise the sale of arrack and punch led to some hostility and desertions by a number of troops who stole boats and were probably mostly lost at sea\u00a0\u2014 however, at least one group of seven soldiers and a slave succeeded in escaping to Brazil in 1770. It was from about this date that the island began, for the first time, to enjoy a prolonged period of prosperity. The first Parish Church in Jamestown had been showing signs of decay for many years, and finally a new building was erected in 1774. St James' is now the oldest Anglican church south of the Equator. Captain James Cook visited the island in 1775 on the final leg of his second circumnavigation of the world.\nAn order by governor Daniel Corneille (1782\u20131787) banning garrison troops and sailors from punch-taverns, only allowing them to drink at army canteens, led to a mutiny over Christmas 1783 when some 200 troops skirmished with loyal troops over a three-day period. Courts martial condemned 99 mutineers to death. These mutineers were then decimated; lots were drawn, with one in every ten being shot and executed.\nSaul Solomon is believed to have arrived at the island about 1790, where he eventually formed the Solomon's company, initially based at an emporium. Today the Rose and Crown shop occupies the building. Captain Bligh arrived at St\u00a0Helena in 1792 during his second attempt to ship a cargo of breadfruit trees to Jamaica. That same year saw the importation of slaves made illegal.\nIn 1795 governor Robert Brooke (1787\u20131801) was alerted that the French had overrun the Netherlands, forcing the Dutch to become their allies. Some 411 troops were sent from the garrison to support General Sir James Craig in his successful capture of the Dutch colony at the Cape of Good Hope. Fortifications were improved and a new system of visual signalling introduced. Brooke had a battery built at Ladder Hill, and a tower to protect its rearward approaches, known as High Knoll Fort.\nAs a result of a policy of recruiting time-expired soldiers calling at the island on their voyage home from India, the St\u00a0Helena Regiment was built up to 1,000 men by 1800. At the same time, every able-bodied man joined the island's militia.\nThe arrival of a fleet of ships in January 1807 caused an outbreak of measles. The outbreak led to the death of 102 \"Blacks\" (probably under-reported in church records), and 58 \"whites\" in the two months to May. With the importation of slaves no longer being legal, Governor Robert Patton (1802\u20131807) recommended that Company import Chinese labour to grow the rural workforce. The first Chinese labourers arrived in 1810, and the total number rose to about 600 by 1818. After 1836, many were allowed to stay on and their descendants became integrated into the population.\nGovernor Alexander Beatson (1808\u20131813) took action to reduce drunkenness by prohibiting the public sale of spirits and the importation of cheap Indian spirits. As in 1787, these actions resulted in a mutiny by about 250 troops in December 1811. After the mutineers surrendered to loyal troops, nine of the mutineers' leaders were executed. Under the aegis of the next governor, Mark Wilks (1813\u20131816) farming methods were improved, a rebuilding programme initiated, and the first public library opened. A census in 1814 showed the number of inhabitants was 3,507.\n\"Main text: Napoleon I of France: Exile on Saint Helena\"\nBritish rule 1815\u20131821, and Napoleon's exile.\nIn 1815 the British government selected Saint Helena as the place of detention of Napoleon Bonaparte. He was brought to the island in October 1815 and lodged at Longwood, where he died on 5 May 1821.\nDuring this period the island was strongly garrisoned by regular British regimental troops and by the local St Helena Regiment, with Royal Navy ships circling the island. Agreement was reached that St Helena would be placed in the hands of a general officer of His Majesty's service during Napoleon's confinement. The British government would meet all expenses relating to the prisoner and would be responsible for both his and the island's security. Sir Hudson Lowe (1816\u20131821), was duly appointed reporting to Lord Bathurst, the Secretary of State for War and the Colonies through the East India Company\u2019s Secret Committee in London. Brisk business was enjoyed catering for the additional 2,000 troops and personnel on the island over the six-year period, although restrictions placed against ships landing during this period posed a challenge for local traders to import the necessary goods.\nThe 1817 census recorded 821 white inhabitants, a garrison of 820 men, 618 Chinese indentured labourers, 500 free blacks and 1,540 slaves. In 1818, while admitting that nowhere in the world did slavery exist in a milder form than on St\u00a0Helena, Lowe initiated the first step in emancipating the slaves by persuading slave owners to give all slave children born after Christmas of that year their freedom once they had reached their late teens. Solomon Dickson &amp; Taylor issued \u00a3147-worth of copper halfpenny tokens sometime before 1821 to enhance local trade.\nBritish East India Company, 1821\u20131834.\nAfter Napoleon's death the large number of temporary residents, such as military personnel, were soon withdrawn. The East India Company resumed full control of Saint Helena and life returned to the pre-1815 standards, the fall in population causing a sharp change in the economy. The next governors, Thomas Brooke (temporary governor, 1821\u20131823) and Alexander Walker (1823\u20131828), successfully brought the island through this post-Napoleonic period with the opening of a new farmer's market in Jamestown, the foundation of an Agricultural and Horticultural Society and improvements in education. The importation of slaves was banned in 1792, but the phased emancipation of over 800 resident slaves did not take place until 1827, some six years before legislation to ban slavery in the colonies was passed by the British Parliament. An abortive attempt was made to set up a whaling industry in 1830 (also in 1875). Following praise of St\u00a0Helena's coffee given by Napoleon during his exile on the island, the product enjoyed a brief popularity in Paris during the years after his death.\nBritish rule, a Crown colony, 1834\u20131981.\nThe Parliament of the United Kingdom passed the Saint Helena Act in 1833, a provision of which transferred control of St\u00a0Helena from the East India Company to the Crown with effect from 2 April 1834. In practice, the transfer did not take effect until 24 February 1836 when Major-General George Middlemore (1836\u20131842), the first governor appointed by the British government, arrived with 91st Regiment troops. He summarily dismissed St\u00a0Helena Regiment and, following orders from London, embarked on a savage drive to cut administrative costs, dismissing most officers previously in the Company employ. This triggered the start of a long-term pattern whereby those who could afford to do so tended to leave the island for better fortunes and opportunities elsewhere. The population was to fall gradually from 6,150 in 1817 to less than 4,000 by 1890. Charles Darwin spent six days of observation on the island in 1836 during his return journey on HMS \"Beagle\". Controversial figure, Dr. James Barry, also arrived that year as principal medical officer (1836\u20131837). In addition to reorganising the hospital, Barry highlighted the heavy incidence of venereal diseases in the civilian population, blaming the government for the removal of the St\u00a0Helena Regiment, which resulted in destitute females resorting to prostitution.\nFollowing the conquest of Aden in January 1839 and the establishment of a coal station there, the journey time to the Far East (via the Mediterranean, the Alexandria to Cairo overland crossing and the Red Sea) was roughly halved compared with the traditional South Atlantic route. This precursor to the effects of the Suez Canal (1869), coupled with the advent of steam shipping that was not dependent on trade winds led to a gradual reduction in the number of ships calling at St\u00a0Helena and to a decline in its strategic importance to Britain and economic fortunes. (A 2020 report adds that the island's prosperity ended after 1860 when \"the Suez Canal shifted trade routes north\"/) The number of ships calling at the island fell from 1,100 in 1855; to 853 in 1869; to 603 in 1879 and to only 288 in 1889.\nIn 1839, London coffee merchants Wm Burnie &amp; Co described St\u00a0Helena coffee as being of \"very superior quality and flavour\". In 1840 the British Government deployed a naval station to suppress the African slave trade. The squadron was based at St\u00a0Helena and a Vice Admiralty Court was based at Jamestown to try the crews of the slave ships. Most of these were broken up and used for salvage. Between 1840 and 1849, 15,076 freed slaves, known as \"Liberated Africans\" were landed at Rupert's Bay on the island, of which number over 5,000 were dead or died there. The final number up to the 1870s when the depot was finally closed has not yet been accurately determined, but would be over 20,000. Surviving freed slaves lived at Lemon Valley \u2013 originally the quarantine area, later for women and children, Rupert's and High Knoll, and only when numbers became too great were they sent to Cape Town and the British West Indies as labourers. About 500 remained on St Helena, where they were employed. In later years, some were sent to Sierra Leone.\nIt was also in 1840 that the British government acceded to a French request for Napoleon's body to be returned to France in what became known as the retour des cendres. The body, in excellent state of preservation, was exhumed on 15 October 1840 and ceremonially handed over to the Prince de Joinville in the French ship \"Belle Poule\".\nA European Regiment, called the St\u00a0Helena Regiment, comprising five companies was formed in 1842 for the purpose of garrisoning the island. William A Thorpe, the founder of the Thorpe business, was born on the island the same year. There was another outbreak of measles in 1843 and it was noted that none of those who survived the 1807 outbreak contracted the disease a second time. The first Baptist minister arrived from Cape Town in 1845. The same year, St\u00a0Helena coffee was sold in London at 1d per pound, making it the most expensive and exclusive in the world. In 1846, St James' church was considerably repaired, a steeple replacing the old tower. The same year, huge waves, or \"rollers\", hit the island causing 13 ships anchored off Jamestown bay to be wrecked. The foundation stone for St Paul's country church, also known as \"The Cathedral\", was laid in 1850. Following instructions from London to achieve economies, Governor Thomas Gore Brown (1851\u20131856) further reduced the civil establishment. He also tackled the problems of overpopulation of Jamestown posed by the restrictions of the valley terrain by establishing a village at Rupert's Bay. A census in 1851 showed a total of 6,914 inhabitants living on the island. In 1859 the Diocese of St Helena was set up for St\u00a0Helena, including Ascension Island and Tristan da Cunha (initially also including the Falkland Islands, Rio de Janeiro and other towns along the east coast of South America), the first Bishop of St\u00a0Helena arriving on the island that year. Islanders later complained that succeeding governors were mainly retired senior military officers with an undynamic approach to the job. St John's church was built in upper Jamestown in 1857, one motivation being to counter the levels of vice and prostitution at that end of the town.\nThe following year, the lands forming the sites of Napoleon's burial and of his home at Longwood House were vested in Napoleon III and his heirs and a French representative or consul has lived on the island ever since, the French flag now flying over these areas. The title deeds of Briars Pavilion, where Napoleon lived during his earliest period of exile, were much later given to the French Government in 1959. Coincidentally the Duke of Wellington had also stayed at the property prior to Napoleon, when he was en route home from India.\nSt\u00a0Helena coffee grown on the Bamboo Hedge Estate at Sandy Bay won a premier award at the Great Exhibition at the Crystal Palace in 1851. Saul Solomon was buried at St\u00a0Helena in 1853. The first postage stamp was issued for the island in 1856, the six-pence blue, marking the start of considerable philatelic interest in the island.\nBy the 1860s it was apparent that wood sourced from some condemned slave ships (possibly a Brazilian ship) from the 1840s were infested by termites (\"white ants\"). Eating their way through house timbers (also documents) the termites caused the collapse of a number of buildings and considerable economic damage over several decades. Extensive reconstruction made use of iron rails and termite-proof timbers. The termite problem persists to the present day. The cornerstone for St Matthew's church at Hutt's Gate was laid in 1861.\nThe withdrawal of the British naval station in 1864 and closure of the Liberated African Station ten years later (several hundred Africans were deported to Lagos and other places on the West African coast) resulted in a further deterioration in the economy. A small earthquake was recorded the same year. The gaol in Rupert's Bay was destroyed and the Castle and Supreme Court were reconstructed in 1867. Cinchona plants were introduced in 1868 by Charles Elliot (1863\u20131870) with a view to exporting quinine but the experiment was abandoned by his successor Governor C. G. E. Patey (1870\u20131873), who also embarked on a programme of reducing the civil establishment. The latter action led to another phase of emigration from the island. An experiment in 1874 to produce flax from Phomium Tenax (New Zealand flax) failed (the cultivation of flax recommenced in 1907 and eventually became the island's largest export). In 1871, the Royal Engineers constructed Jacob's Ladder up the steep side of the valley from Jamestown to Knoll Mount Fort, with 700 steps, one step being covered over in later repairs. A census in 1881 showed 5,059 inhabitants lived on the island. Jonathan, claimed to be the world's oldest tortoise, is thought to have arrived on the island in 1882.\nAn outbreak of measles in 1886 resulted in 113 cases and 8 deaths. Jamestown was lighted for the first time in 1888, the initial cost being borne by the inhabitants. Dinuzulu kaCetshwayo, son of the Zulu king Cetshwayo, was exiled at St\u00a0Helena between 1890 and 1897. Diphtheria broke out in 1887 and also in 1893 which, with an additional outbreak of whooping cough, led to the death of 31 children under 10. In 1890 a great fall of rock killed nine people in Jamestown, a fountain being erected in Main Street in their memory. A census in 1891 showed 4,116 inhabitants lived on the island. A submarine cable en route to Britain from Cape Town was landed in November 1899 and extended to Ascension by December and was operated by the Eastern Telegraph Company. For the next two years over six thousand Boer prisoners were imprisoned at Deadwood and Broadbottom. The population reached its all-time record of 9,850 in 1901. Although a number of prisoners died, being buried at Knollcombes, the islanders and Boers developed a relationship of mutual respect and trust, a few Boers choosing to remain on the island when the war ended in 1902. A severe outbreak of influenza in 1900 led to the death of 3.3% of the population, although it affected neither the Boer prisoners nor the troops guarding them. An outbreak of whooping cough in 1903 infected most children on the island, although only one died as a result.\nThe departure of the Boers and later removal of the remaining garrison in 1906 (with the disbandment of the St\u00a0Helena Volunteers, this was the first time the island was left without a garrison) both impacted on the island economy, which was only slightly offset by growing philatelic sales. The successful reestablishment of the flax industry in 1907 did much to counter these problems, generating considerable income during the war years. Lace making was encouraged as an island-industry during the pre-war period, initiated by Emily Jackson in 1890 and a lace-making school was opened in 1908. Two men, known as the Prosperous Bay Murderers, were hanged in 1905. A paper published in 2017 has proved that reports of a fish-canning factory opening and closing in 1909 because of an unusual shortage of fish are incorrect. The diamond merchant and philanthropist Alfred Mosely funded cured mackerel production in 1910. Packed in barrels, the product sold at a loss in New York and the industry was therefore ended. Governor Gallwey used the word \"factory\" in an unusual form, referring a team of workers working in the open on Jamestown's wharf. Fish catches were greater than in 1909. It has also been shown that in 1912, Mosely also unsuccessfully petitioned authorities to allow most of St Helena's population to emigrate to Coronado, California. \"S.S. Papanui\", en route from Britain to Australia with emigrants, arrived in James Bay in 1911 on fire, possibly due to spontaneous combustion of coal stored in a thermally-insulated hold. The ship burned out and sank, but its 364 passengers and crew were rescued and looked after on the island. A census in 1911 showed the population had fallen from its peak in 1901 to only 3,520 inhabitants. Some 4,800 rats tails were presented to the Government in 1913, who paid a penny per tail.\nA review has been published of St Helena's wartime period. Islanders were made aware of their vulnerability to naval attack, despite extensive fortifications, following a visit by a fleet of three German super-dreadnoughts in January 1914. With the outbreak of World War I, the defunct St\u00a0Helena Volunteer Corps was re-established. In the absence of infantry forces, a policy of defensive strongholds was adopted in the event of an invasion. Considerable pressure was put on islanders to volunteer to serve in the overseas forces, but this was always on a voluntary basis. Some 46 islanders volunteered to fight abroad, the war memorials on the wharf and at St Paul's Church (which differ in detail) showing some eight men lost their lives during the conflict. The self-proclaimed Sultan of Zanzibar, Seyyid Khalid Bin Barghash, was exiled in St\u00a0Helena from 1917 to 1921 before being transferred to the Seychelles. Parliamentary criticism was voiced when Governor Cordeaux took a 31-month leave of absence from March 1917. A petition for the replacement of Acting Governor Dixon was raised in 1918. This followed a period of food shortages. The 1918 world pandemic of influenza bypassed St\u00a0Helena.\nWilliam A. Thorpe was killed in an accident in 1918, his business continuing to operate on the island to the present day. In 1920 the Norwegian ship Spangereid caught fire and sank at her mooring at James Bay, depositing quantities of coal on the beach below the wharf. A census in 1921 showed the islands population was 3,747. The first islanders left to work at Ascension Island in 1921, which was made a dependency of St\u00a0Helena in 1922. Thomas R. Bruce (postmaster 1898\u20131928) was the first islander to design a postage stamp, the 1922\u20131937 George V ship-design\u2014this significantly contributed to island revenues for several years. South African coinage became legal tender in 1923, reflecting the high level of trade with that country. There were nine deaths from whooping cough between 1920 and 1929 and 2,200 cases of measles in 1932. The first car, an Austin 7, was imported into the island in 1929. A census in 1931 showed a population of 3,995 (and a goat population of nearly 1,500). Cable and Wireless absorbed the Eastern Telegraph Company in 1934. Tristan da Cunha was made a dependency of St\u00a0Helena in 1938.\nSome six islanders gave their lives during World War II. The German battle cruiser \"Admiral Graf Spee\" was observed passing the island in 1939 and the British oil tanker RFA \"Darkdale\" was torpedoed off Jamestown bay in October 1941. As part of the Lend-Lease agreement, America built Wideawake airport on Ascension in 1942, but no military use was made of St\u00a0Helena. As in the previous war, the island enjoyed increased revenues through the sale of flax.\nThere were 217 cases of polio, including 11 deaths, in 1945. A census in 1946 showed 4,748 inhabitants lived on the island. In 1948 there were seven deaths from whooping cough and 77 hospital admissions from acute nephritis. In 1951, mumps attacked 90% of the population. Solomon's became a limited company the same year. Flax prices continued to rise after the war, rising to their zenith in 1951. However, this St\u00a0Helena staple industry fell into decline because of competition from synthetic fibres and also because the delivered price of the island's flax was substantially higher than world prices. The decision by a major buyer, the British Post Office, to use synthetic fibres for their mailbags was a major blow, all of which contributed in the closure of the island's flax mills in 1965. Many acres of land are still covered with flax plants. A census in 1956 showed the population had fallen only slightly, to 4,642. 1957 witnessed the arrival of three Bahrain princes as prisoners of Britain, who remained until released by a writ of habeas corpus in 1960. Another attempt to operate a fish cannery led to closure in 1957. From 1958, the Union Castle shipping line gradually reduced their service calls to the island. The same year, there were 36 cases of poliomyelitis. A census in 1966 showed a relatively unchanged population of 4,649 inhabitants.\nA South African company (The South Atlantic Trading and Investment Corporation, SATIC) bought a majority share in Solomon and Company in 1968. Following several years of losses and to avoid the economic effects of a closure of the company, the St\u00a0Helena government eventually bought a majority share in the company in 1974. In 1969 the first elections were held under the new constitution for twelve-member Legislative Council. By 1976, the population had grown slightly to 5,147 inhabitants. Based from Avonmouth, Curnow Shipping replaced the Union-Castle Line mailship service in 1977, using the RMS \"St\u00a0Helena\", a coastal passenger and cargo vessel that had been used between Vancouver and Alaska. Due to structural weakness, the spire of St James' church was demolished in 1980. The endemic flowering shrub, the St\u00a0Helena Ebony, believed to have been extinct for over a century, was rediscovered on the island in 1981.\n1981 to present.\nThe British Nationality Act 1981 reclassified St\u00a0Helena and the other crown colonies as British Dependent Territories. The islanders lost their status as 'Citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies' (as defined in the British Nationality Act 1948) and were stripped of their right of abode in Britain. For the next 20 years, many could find only low-paid work with the island government and the only available employment overseas for the islanders was restricted to the Falkland Islands and Ascension Island, a period during which the island was often referred to as the \"South Atlantic Alcatraz\".\nThe RMS \"St\u00a0Helena\" was requisitioned in 1982 by the Ministry of Defence to help in support of the Falklands Conflict, and sailed south with the entire crew volunteering for duty. The ship was involved in supporting minesweeper operations but the volunteers were refused South Atlantic Medals. The then Prince Andrew (later Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor) began his relationship with St\u00a0Helena in 1984 with a visit to the island as a member of the armed forces.\nThe 1987 census showed that the island population stood at 5,644. The Development &amp; Economic Planning Department, which still operates, was formed in 1988 to contribute to raising the living standards of the people of St\u00a0Helena by planning and managing sustainable economic development through education, participation and planning, improving decision making by providing statistical information and by improving the safety and operation of the wharf and harbour operations. After decades of planning, the realisation of the three-tier school system began in 1988 under the aegis of the Head of Education, Basil George, when the Prince Andrew School was opened for all pupils of 12 onwards. Middle schools would take the 8- to 12-year-old children and the First schools from 5-year-olds.\nThe then Prince Andrew launched the replacement RMS \"St\u00a0Helena\" in 1989 at Aberdeen. The vessel was specially built for the Cardiff\u2013Cape Town route, and featured a mixed cargo/passenger layout. At the same time, a shuttle service between St\u00a0Helena and Ascension was planned, for the many Saint Helenians working there and on the Falklands. In 1995 the decision was made to base the ship from Cape Town and limit the number of trips to the UK to just four a year.\nThe 1988 St\u00a0Helena Constitution took effect in 1989 and provided that the island would be governed by a Governor and Commander-in-Chief, and an Executive and Legislative Council. The Executive Council members would be elected for nomination by the elected members of the Legislative Council, and subsequently appointed by the Governor and could only be removed from office by the votes of a majority of the five members of the Legislative Council. The Legislative Council Members would be re-elected by the voters every four years. With few exceptions the Governor would be obliged to abide by the advice given to him by the Executive Council. Five Council Committees would be made up from the membership of the Legislative Council and civil servants so that at any time there would always be a majority of elected members. The five Chairpersons of these committees would comprise the elected membership of the Executive Council.\nThe Bishop's Commission on Citizenship was established at the Fifteenth Session of Diocesan Synod in 1992 with the aim of restoring full citizenship of the islanders and restore the right of abode in the UK. Research began (Prof. T. Charlton) in 1993, two years before its introduction on the island and five years after, to measure the influence that television has on the behaviour of children in classrooms and school playgrounds. This concluded that the island children continued to be hard working and very well behaved and that family and community social controls were more important in shaping children's behaviour than exposure to television. The Island of St\u00a0Helena Coffee Company was founded in 1994 by David Henry. Using Green Tipped Bourbon Coffee plants imported in 1733, crops were grown on several sites, including the Bamboo Hedge Estate Sandy Bay estate used for the 1851 Great Exhibition entry. In 1997, the acute employment problem at St\u00a0Helena was brought to the attention of the British public following reports in the tabloid press of a \"riot\" following an article in the Financial Times describing how the Governor, David Smallman (1995\u20131999), was jostled by a small crowd who believed he and the Foreign Office had rejected plans to build an airport on the island.\nHong Kong was handed back to China in 1997, and the same year the British government published a review of the Dependent Territories. This included a commitment to restore the pre-1981 status for citizenship. This was effected by the British Overseas Territories Act 2002, which restored full passports to the islanders, and renamed the Dependent Territories the British Overseas Territories. The St\u00a0Helena National Trust was also formed the same year with the aim of promoting the island's unique environmental and culture heritage. A full census in February 1998 showed the total population (including the RMS) was 5,157 persons.\nIn a vote held in January 2002, a majority of islanders (at home and abroad) voted in favour for an airport to be built. The island's two-floor museum situated in a building near the base of Jacob's Ladder was opened the same year and is operated by the St\u00a0Helena Heritage Society. The Bank of St\u00a0Helena, located next to the Post Office, commenced operations in 2004, inheriting the assets and accounts of the former St\u00a0Helena Government Savings and the Ascension Island Savings Banks, both of which then ceased to exist. In April 2005 the British Government announced plans to construct an airport on Saint Helena to bolster the Island's economy, and reduce the dependence on boats to supply the Island. Impregilo S.p.A. of Milan were selected as the preferred tender to design, build and operate the airport, which was expected to be open in 2012/13, although final UK ministerial approval had still not been given. The following December, DfID announced they and the \"Treasury are in continuing discussions about issues of concern regarding access to St Helena. As a result, there will be a pause in negotiations over the St Helena airport contract\". This was widely interpreted as meaning the project was in abeyance, probably for a number of years until the UK's economy recovers. In March 2009, DfID announced the launch of a new consultation on options for access to the island. In a parliamentary debate in which DfID were accused of delaying tactics, the ministry accepted the conclusion in their 2005 Access document but argued good fiscal management required this to be re-reviewed. In December 2008, the British Government decided not to go ahead at that time with the long-promised airport.\n When the airport eventually opens, the Royal Mail ship will cease operations soon after flights begin. Saint Helena Airport was finally completed on Prosperous Bay Plain in 2016, but its opening was delayed by concerns regarding wind shear. The first scheduled commercial airline flight landed on 14 October 2017.\nA census held in February 2008 showed the population (including the RMS) had fallen to 4,255. In the first half of 2008, areas of the cliff above the wharf were stabilised from rock falls with netting at a cost of approximately \u00a33 million. On 14 August, about 200 tons of rock fell from the west side of Jamestown severely damaging the Baptist chapel and surrounding buildings. Plans are in hand to net the most dangerous sections of the mountains either side of Jamestown over the period to 2015 at an estimated cost of about \u00a315 million.\nA comparative review of the different sources for the history of St\u00a0Helena has been published on the St\u00a0Helena Institute web site.\nUntil 2017, travel to the island required a long trip by boat. An airport was constructed and the first flight arrived in October 2017. Because of \"dangerous wind conditions\" that made landing large aircraft unsafe, only smaller aircraft are used for the five hour trip from South Africa. Passenger service on the Royal Mail ship was discontinued in 2018.\nThe travel restrictions imposed due to the COVID-19 pandemic had a very negative effect on tourism in 2020 and extending into 2021. One news report in August 2020 stated that the costs imposed by the pandemic led to the \"collapse of the island\u2019s tourism sector, which was meant to drive its economic development\".\nHistory of British and other Royal visitors.\nOne commentator has observed that, notwithstanding the high unemployment resulting from the loss of full passports during 1981\u20132002, the level of loyalty to the British monarchy by the St\u00a0Helena population is probably not exceeded in any other part of the world.\nThe first royal visit is speculated to have been by Prince Rupert of the Rhine (1619\u20131682), probably on his voyage home in India. No contemporary documents exist, but no other explanation has been given for naming Rupert's Bay, adjacent to Jamestown.\nThe Prince de Joinville arrived in 1840 to return the body of Napoleon I to France. The Prince Alfred visited the island in 1860 en route to Tristan Da Cunha. Empress Eug\u00e9nie (widow of Napoleon III) arrived in 1880 and the same year Prince Henry of Prussia arrived in a German frigate. The Duke of Connaught arrived in 1911 on his journey back from Cape Town. The Prince of Wales (later Edward VIII) visited in 1925.\nGeorge VI is the only reigning monarch to visit the island. This was in 1947 when the King, accompanied by Queen Elizabeth (later Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother), Princess Elizabeth (later Elizabeth II) and Princess Margaret were travelling from South Africa.\nThe Duke of Edinburgh arrived at St\u00a0Helena in 1957 and then his son Prince Andrew visited as a member of the armed forces in 1984. His sister the Princess Royal arrived in 2002.\nThe last serving British Ministerial visit was in 1699.\nHistory of the media in St Helena.\nThe St\u00a0Helena Press was set up by Saul Soloman in 1806 and produced a number of publications including the \"Government Gazette\" (from 1807) and the \"St\u00a0Helena Monthly Register\" (from 1809), both government funded publications. The press was taken over after the departure of governor Alexander Beatson (1808\u201313), and was mainly used for government notices and regulations. The first of an occasional series \"St\u00a0Helena Almanack and Annual Registers\" was published with the press in 1842 (the last and most comprehensive edition being published in 1913).\nThe \"St\u00a0Helena Advocate and Weekly Journal of News\", published in 1851, was the first island newspaper, but closed two years later mainly due to competition from the government-funded St \"Helena Chronicle\" (1852). This short publication period was a fate suffered by most island newspapers. The \"St\u00a0Helena Herald\" was published from 1853 but ceased publication in 1860 when the editor launched a new paper, the \"St\u00a0Helena Record\". This closed in 1861 and was immediately replaced by the longest running paper, the \"St\u00a0Helena Guardian\" (weekly, 1861\u20131925). The proprietor of the latter, Benjamin Grant, also published the St\u00a0Helena Advertiser (1865\u20131866).\nTwo other newspapers published about this time, the \"St\u00a0Helena Advertiser\", the \"St\u00a0Helena Star\" (1866\u20131867) and \"St\u00a0Helena Spectator\" (1866\u20131868) both closed because of the lack of printing facilities. Two humorous papers, The Bug (1888) and the Mosquito (1888) were similarly short-lived. Several short-lived papers also appeared a few years later \u2013 \"the St\u00a0Helena Times\" (1889), the \"Monthly Critic\" and \"Flashman\" (1895) and the \"St\u00a0Helena Observer\". \"De Krisgsgevangenewas\", a censored Dutch newspaper, was published for Boer prisoners from 1901.\nThe \"St\u00a0Helena Church News\" was published from 1888, the \"Parish Magazine\" from 1889, the \"Diocesan Magazine\" from 1901 and the \"Jamestown Monthly\" from 1912 The latter was renamed the \"St\u00a0Helena Church Magazine\" and was published until 1945 by Canon Wallcot, who extended news coverage from church matters to also include island news after the closure of the \"St\u00a0Helena Guardian\". The government-funded \"St\u00a0Helena Wirebird\" was published in the early 1960s, closing in 1965. The government-funded \"St\u00a0Helena News Review\" and the \"St\u00a0Helena News\" followed this. Between 1990 and 1991, the \"New Wirebird\" was published independently.\nRadio St\u00a0Helena started operations on Christmas Day 1967, transmissions being limited to the island apart from occasional short-wave broadcasts. The station presented news, features and music in collaboration with its sister newspaper, the \"St\u00a0Helena Herald\", published by the partially publicly funded St\u00a0Helena News Media Services (SHNMS) since 2000. The non-government funded Saint FM Radio officially launched in January 2005. The station currently broadcasts news, features and music across the island, Ascension, the Falklands and worldwide over the internet in collaboration with its sister newspaper, the \"St\u00a0Helena Independent\" (published since November 2005). Both the Herald and Independent can be read worldwide via the internet. Cable and Wireless currently rebroadcast television throughout the island via three DStv channels of entertainment.\nIn October 2008, the St\u00a0Helena Government announced that island's media must choose whether they obtained revenue from government subsidies or from advertising. They could not do both. On this basis, the partly publicly subsidised Media Services, which publish the St\u00a0Helena Herald and broadcast on Radio St Helena, would no longer be allowed to run advertisements. Simultaneously, the St\u00a0Helena Independent and Saint FM announced that they would need to increase advertising rates, which barely covered the cost of producing adverts.\nThe St. Helena Herald closed down in 2012, its last edition being on Friday 9 March.\nSaintFM closed down on Friday 21 December 2012. The reasons for its closure can be read on its page: Saint FM.\nRadio St. Helena closed down at Midnight on Christmas Day, 25 December 2012. This left the island with no broadcast radio.\nSaintFM Community Radio launched at 8am on 10 March 2013, taking over the studios and frequencies of the former Saint FM. See Saint fm community radio. The station is also available via the TuneIn app. https://\nAs of October 2020, the Saint Helena Island Info website listed three active stations, two operated by South Atlantic Media Services: S.A.M.S. Radio 1 (news, features and entertainment), S.A.M.S. Radio 2 (relay of the BBC World Service) and the SaintFM Community Radio.\nCommunications and television.\nOne company, Sure South Atlantic, provides \"broadband, mobile phone, national &amp; international telephone, public Internet and television re-broadcast services\" for the island.\nIn December 2019, the government signed a contract with Google to connect St Helena Island to the Equiano Subsea Fibre Optic Cable. The project was financed by the European Development Fund. The first branch of the Equiano Subsea Cable was landed in August 2021 on Ruperts Beach. Since September 2023 the island is connected to it.\nEcological significance.\nSaint Helena has been a very integral part of man's exploration of the Earth and development of sciences, especially ecological sciences. When the island was first discovered, it was one of the most isolated and pristine piece of land ever encountered by humans. This, along with its relatively small size, allowed ecologists to study the effects of man and time with limited variables. Richard Grove, Author of \"Green Imperialism,\" among other works, explains how imperialist deforestation of Saint Helena made apparent for the first time the devastating effects humans can have on the world around them. Saint Helena Island was famous for the work that Georg Forster and Johann Reinhold Forster performed on the famous Cook Voyage aboard HMS \"Resolution\" in 1775. This voyage was the beginning of ecological conservatism. Before any ideas of conservatism, there were economic factors causing the destruction of Saint Helena, but also colonial ideology behind the mass destruction of tropical landscapes throughout the last 400 years. The deforestation of Saint Helena by European East India Companies in the 15th and 16th centuries led to one of the first ecological legislation, the Forest Act of Saint Helena.\nThe Forsters' \"Resolution\" voyage with Captain James Cook was motivated to discover a connection between nature and human development. At first, they believed that nature must have some sort of effect on human development which could answer why there are different levels of development throughout the world. However, their discoveries on Saint Helena Island were to the contrary, they found that man has more effect on nature than they originally believed. After allowing human destructive power to reach Saint Helena, the Forsters noticed flooding from the removal of vegetation and mass slaughter of the turtle population. The consequence of the imperial destruction was a fundamental understanding of the importance of vegetal cover in the tropical environment. Other writers, such as Peter Kalm who wrote about deforestation and draught in North America without connecting the two phenomena, influenced the Forsters' theories on the importance of vegetation.\nThe Forster expedition started the ecological study of Saint Helena, but others have been studying the island since then. Because the island has been extremely affected by human interaction and destruction, scientists have attempted to discern the original vegetal makeup of the island. A scientific study is the only way to determine the original vegetation because there is no direct evidence of plant life from when the island was discovered. One study determined that because the island is volcanic in nature, any plant life existing on the island would have travelled there from elsewhere. It is most likely that the original plant life would have travelled from southern Africa because of the south-easterly prevailing winds and currents.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

St Helena has a land area of 122 square kilometres and is part of the territory of Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha which includes Ascension Island and the island group of Tristan da Cunha.\nPhysical geography.\nClimate.\nThe climate of Saint Helena island can be described as tropical, marine and mild, tempered by the Benguela Current and trade winds which blow almost continuously. Similarly, the climate of Tristan da Cunha is marine, mild and also tempered by trade winds, although the climate is temperate in nature. Ascension Island is warmer and wetter than St Helena.\nTerrain.\nSaint Helena has a rugged, volcanic terrain, with small scattered plateaus and plains, with the largest area of level ground on the island being Prosperous Bay Plain in the eastern arid area. The other islands of the group have a volcanic origin. The highest point on the island is Diana's Peak at 818 metres (2,684\u00a0ft), though Queen Mary's Peak on Tristan da Cunha is the highest in the British territory at 2,062 m.\nA natural hazard on Tristan da Cunha is active volcanism, though this is not the case on St Helena itself.\nGeology.\nSt. Helena exists because of the St. Helena hotspot which began to produce basaltic lava about 145 million years ago when it was near the constructive plate margin of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. The movement of the African Plate away from the hotspot has left the chain of the St. Helena seamounts, which may connect with the Cameroon Volcanic Line. St. Helena, the most south westerly point on the chain, is close to the plate margin, but the last volcanic eruptions occurred about 7 million years ago.\nThe first investigations of St. Helena geology were made when Charles Darwin visited the island on the voyage of H.M.S. Beagle in July 1836. He \"used the observations on St Helena to formulate an intermediate hypothesis (published in 1844 in his book \"Geological Observations on the volcanic islands and parts of South America visited during the Voyage of H.M.S. \"Beagle\") - volcanoes rise by slow, gradual and episodic events\".\nGeological features.\nThe Barn is a capping of younger lavas upon weaker rocks. The Barn features cliffs on the side that faces the sea. It overlooks the pyroclasts and weak flows of Turk's Cap Valley to the south.\nTaking their names from the story of Lot in the Book of Genesis, \"Lot\" and \"Lot's Wife\" are two solitary pillars of rock topping two valleys near Sandy Bay. The pillars are phonolitic intrusions, which are more resistant to erosion than surrounding volcanic features which have, in time, eroded away.\nNatural resources.\nSaint Helena possesses fish as a main natural resource. Land use in the island group is divided between arable land (with 12.9% of the area given to this) and other uses, which occupy the remaining 87.1%.\nIn terms of maritime claims, St Helena has an exclusive fishing zone of 200 nautical miles, and a territorial sea of twelve nautical miles.\nIslands.\nJust off the coast of St Helena island itself are numerous small islands. Starting from the north and running clockwise, these are: Shore Island, George Island, Rough Rock Island, Flat Rock, The Buoys, Sandy Bay Island, Black Horse Island, White Bird Island, Frightus Island, Jar Rock, Castle Point Rock, Robert Rock, Salt Rock, Speery Island, Flat Rock, The Needle, Lower and Upper Black Rock, Bird Island, Black Rock, Thompson's Valley Island, Peaked Island, Egg Island, Lady's Chair, Lighter Rock, Long Ledge, and Red Rock.\nEcology.\nSaint Helena harbours at least 40 species of plants unknown anywhere else in the world, and Ascension is a breeding ground for sea turtles and sooty terns.\nDistricts.\nThe island of St Helena is divided into 8 districts, which are used for electoral and administrative purposes.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

With almost 10,000 inhabitants at the 1901 census, the highest number of residents was reached. However, this number included almost 6,000 Boer prisoners of war. Excluding the prisoners of war (who were on the island during 1900-1902), the highest population in the twentieth century was reached in 1987. The population gradually decreased thereafter and reached 4,000 in 2024, mainly descended from Africans, Mixed race African and Europeans, British settlers, East India Company employees and indentured labourers from the South Asian sub-Continent, East Indies, Madagascar and China.\nThe language spoken in Saint Helena is English.\nThe people of Saint Helena are \"Saint Helenians\" (though locally they are known as \"Saints\"); the demonym being \"Saint Helenian\".\nA census in February 2016 recorded a population of 4,534 on the island. This compares with a figure of 4,257 recorded in 2008 and a figure of 5,157 recorded in 1998. The fall between 1998 and 2008 can be explained mostly by emigration, especially since 2002 when the islanders were granted full British citizenship. The main diasporas are to the United Kingdom, South Africa and more recently to the Falkland Islands, as well as on Ascension Island. The population density, based on the 2016 figure, is 37.3 persons per km2, or 95.3 per sq mile.\nThe island of Saint Helena is administratively divided into eight districts, each with a community centre. The districts also serve as statistical subdivisions. The island is a single electoral area, sending twelve representatives to the Legislative Council.\nAge structure.\nPopulation by Sex and Age Group (Census 07.II.2021) (Data refer to resident population.):\nVital statistics.\nLife expectancy.\nBy 2010 estimates, life expectancy at birth for the total population is 78.6 years (for males it is 75.68; for females it is 81.67).\nInfant mortality.\nThe infant mortality rate is 16.98 deaths per 1,000 live births.\nEthnicity.\nAccording to the CIA World Factbook, 50% of the population of Saint Helena Island are African Saint Helenians, while Chinese Saint Helenians and White Saint Helenians make up 25% each. However, the possibility of clear-cut categorical divisions between ethnicities on present day St Helena, as reflected by these statistics, is disputed. Most Saint Helenians today are multiracial, similar to the Cape Coloureds.\nAscension has no civilian population, while Tristan da Cunha has a white population descended primarily from the British Isles or from the Falkland Islands.\nReligion.\nThe majority of St. Helenians are Anglican. Other religions in St. Helena include (\"in alphabetic order\"): the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith, the Baptist church, Buddhism, Roman Catholicism, and Seventh-day Adventism.\nAccording to the statistics in the 2014 Yearbook of Jehovah's Witnesses, Saint Helena has the highest proportion of Jehovah's Witnesses of any country or territory in the world: one person in thirty-five, using an estimated population of 4,000 for St Helena and a count of 118 members.\nIn Tristan da Cunha, Christianity is the main religion, with the largest denominations being Anglican and Roman Catholic.\nAscension Island and Tristan da Cunha.\nAscension Island has a population of around eight hundred inhabitants, with the majority being Saint Helenians, located in Georgetown on the west coast of the island, with another small settlement, Two Boats, located in Ascension's interior.\nTristan da Cunha has a population of about three hundred inhabitants, mainly located in the Edinburgh of the Seven Seas settlement on Tristan's North Coast.\nNationality.\nThe citizens of Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha hold British Overseas Territories citizenship. On 21 May 2002 they were granted access to full British citizenship by the British Overseas Territories Act 2002, and there is a special Saint Helena passport issued to them.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

This supplements the \u00a312.6 million raised from local tax revenues.\nThe international airport has been open for private jets and Medivac services since 2016. A scheduled commercial air service began in October 2017. With a total investment of \u00a3285m the airport is the largest single investment ever made in the island. Until 2016, the only way to reach the island was by boat. The last working Royal Mail Ship made its final voyage serving St Helena in 2018.\nSaint Helena's gross domestic product (GDP) for the 2018\u201319 financial year was \u00a338.5 million and GDP per capita was \u00a37,392 and GNP per capita was \u00a38,230. In 2019, there was an annual rate of inflation of 3.3%, and a median employment income was \u00a38,410.\nThe major private sector employers of the islands are Solomons and Co and Thorpes, both providing services in almost all sectors.\nThe government's economic development priorities are developing a sustainable tourism industry and reducing dependency on imports.\nIndustry.\nSaint Helena has several sectors in its economy: fisheries, agriculture (including coffee), construction, retail, and accommodation and food service industries. \nWorkforce.\nIn 2016, Saint Helena had a workforce of 2,539. Many St Helenians take up jobs in Ascension Island, the Falklands and the UK.\nElectricity.\n75% of St Helena's power currently comes from 6 diesel generators, but the island is working towards a 100% renewable energy target. There are currently 12 wind turbines grouped on the Deadwood Plain in Longwood, which generate approximately 20% of the island's needs and several photovoltaic arrays which provide the balance. The rifle range solar farm in Half Tree Hollow currently has the largest output of the solar systems with 500 kWh.\nAgriculture.\nThe main agricultural products of Saint Helena are: coffee, fish (predominantly tuna), Timber, and vegetables such as potatoes.\nTourism.\nSince the opening of the airport to regular commercial air traffic in 2017, the tourism sector has seen growth. There were 1,350 tourists visiting the island in 2017 and 2,485 in 2019, an increase of over 80% with almost all of the visitors arriving by air. There has been a corresponding steady increase of tourist rooms and other tourism-related infrastructure. Tourism is the largest export sector, valued at 5 to 6 million a year. In 2020, the international closures resulting from COVID-19 pandemic halted tourism at end of the high season.\nExports.\nThe 2019\u201320 customs data shows the following exports:\nIn 2019, export of products totalled \u00a3354,000.\nImports.\nFood and other goods are imported from Cape Town, South Africa and the UK (via Ascension). Shipping is run by AW Ship Management Ltd. Packages can be sent via Rich James International or by Royal H.M. Mail (by Royal Mail anything under 2kg will go by air). Wharf services are provided by Solomons. The trade deficit is significant. In 2019\u201320 St Helena imported \u00a319.8m in goods, mostly purchased from South Africa (46%) and the United Kingdom (41%).\nCurrency.\nThe local currency is the Saint Helena pound, which is at a par with the British Pound. The government issues its own coins and banknotes. British pounds are accepted in Saint Helena. \nBanking services on Saint Helena are provided by the Bank of St. Helena, which delivers a retail banking service to individuals and business in, and trading with, Saint Helena.\nThere is no ATM on the island, so cash must be withdrawn from the Bank of Saint Helena cashiers in Jamestown (Monday-Saturday) or at Customs at the wharf (Thursday-Friday). Trials of local debit cards by the bank of Saint Helena began in 2016.\nHistory.\nIn 1957 the price of land on the island was thought to be between \u00a310 and \u00a315 an acre. Eggs were 3 shillings a dozen and bread was 6d for a 1 1/2lb loaf. \nExternal links.\nhttp://"}

Most roads are single-lane, and uphill traffic has a right of way. A general speed limit of applies to the entire island. On Saint Helena there is a public bus network that in January 2015 served five routes, but was expanded in September 2015, March 2016 and October 2017.\nShipping.\nThe M/V \"Helena\" serves the island from Cape Town on a monthly basis. The ship was built in 1998 in China and can take of cargo, or 218 TEU.\nThe M/V \"Helena\" previously carried passengers.\nSaint Helena has a feeder and a harbour:\nBetween 1990, and the opening of airport to commercial passenger traffic, RMS \"St Helena\" (1989) provided passenger travel service.\nSaint Helena was previously served by ships on the Union Castle Line, and by a previous RMS \"St Helena\" (1963) from 1978 to 1990.\nAir traffic.\nWith the opening of Saint Helena Airport, scheduled flights have been operated since 14 October 2017, twelve years after the British government agreed to fund it in order to encourage tourism to the island. \nThe new airport is served weekly from Johannesburg (South Africa). During the pandemic 2020-2021 this service were temporarily cancelled and instead monthly flights operated from London (UK), but from 2022 there were flights from Johannesburg again, and by 2023 the flights came twice weekly in the summer season.\nRail traffic.\nIn 1829, the Saint Helena Railway Company opened a horse-drawn railway from Jamestown to Half Tree Hollow, which was also known as Ladder Hill Railway, or Jacob's Ladder. The main purpose was to transport goods from the port of Jamestown to the higher houses. The service was discontinued in 1871 because it was damaged by termites.\nAnother small rail network was built for the seawater desalination plant in Ruperts. Details of the track are not known.\nAscension.\nRoad traffic.\nOn Ascension there is a road network of , which is continuously paved. The public bus transport network has four stops (as of 2014).\nShipping.\nAscension has a feeder in the island's capital Georgetown. The port was modernized in 2011 with a new crane, among other things.\nAir traffic.\nWith Wideawake Airfield, Ascension has had an airport since 1943. It is primarily used for military purposes, but is also served by monthly scheduled services from Saint Helena.\nPreviously civilian passengers were permitted on flights to and from RAF Brize Norton in England.\nTristan da Cunha.\nRoad traffic.\nTristan da Cunha has a road network of , half of which is paved or half unpaved. The island has probably the smallest public bus network in the world. The fleet of minibuses is available to pensioners free of charge.\nShipping.\nThe shipping traffic is of outstanding importance for Tristan da Cunha, which has no airfield. All goods and travellers can only reach the island by sea. Tristan da Cunha is approached irregularly from Cape Town by MFV Edinburgh, M/V Baltic Trader, and S. A. Agulhas II.\nTristan da Cunha has with the Calshot Harbour a port in Edinburgh of the Seven Seas. The port was comprehensively renovated at the beginning of 2017. It is 2 meters deep and takes only smaller boats. All larger ships have to stay offshore and both passengers and cargo have to be transferred to small boats.\nAir traffic.\nTristan da Cunha has no airport or airstrip of any kind.\nThe S.A Agulhas II has a helicopter which is used for transport between the ship and land. The other ships regularly visiting Tristan da Cunha do not have that, and transport ashore is done with small boats which requires waves not to be too large.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

With of territory, and roughly 48,000 inhabitants, it is the smallest sovereign state in the Western Hemisphere, in both area and population, as well as the world's smallest sovereign federation. The country is a Commonwealth realm, with Charles III as king and head of state.\nThe capital city is Basseterre, located on the larger island of Saint Kitts. Basseterre is also the main port for passenger entry (via cruise ships) and cargo. The smaller island of Nevis lies approximately to the southeast of Saint Kitts, across a shallow channel called The Narrows.\nThe British dependency of Anguilla was historically also a part of this union, which was known collectively as Saint Christopher-Nevis-Anguilla. However, Anguilla chose to secede from the union in 1967, and remains a British overseas territory.\nSaint Kitts and Nevis were among the first islands in the Caribbean to be colonised by Europeans. Saint Kitts was home to the first British and French Caribbean colonies, and thus has also been titled \"The Mother Colony of the West Indies\". It is also the most recent British territory in the Caribbean to become independent, gaining independence in 1983.\nEtymology.\nThe Kalinago, the pre-European inhabitants of Saint Kitts, called the island , roughly translating as 'fertile land'.\nIt is thought that Christopher Columbus, the first European to see the islands in 1493, named the larger island , after Saint Christopher, his patron saint and that of travellers. New studies suggest that Columbus named the island (Saint James), and that the name was in fact given by Columbus to the island now known as Saba, northwest. Saint Kitts was well documented as by the 17th century. The first English colonists kept the English translation of this name, and dubbed it \"St. Christopher's Island\". In the 17th century, a common nickname for Christopher was \"Kit\"; in consequence, the island came to be informally referred to as \"Saint Kitt's Island\", later further shortened to \"Saint Kitts\".\nColumbus gave Nevis the name (Saint Martin). The current name \"Nevis\" is derived from a Spanish name , meaning \"Our Lady of the Snows\", a reference to the 4th-century Catholic miracle of a summertime snowfall on the Esquiline Hill in Rome. It is not known who chose this name for the island, but it is thought that white clouds which usually wreath the top of Nevis Peak reminded someone of the miracle.\nToday, the Constitution refers to the state as both \"Saint Kitts and Nevis\" and \"Saint Christopher and Nevis\"; the former is the one most commonly used, but the latter is generally used for diplomatic relations. Passports list the nationality of citizens as \"St. Kitts and Nevis\".\nHistory.\nPre-colonial period.\nThe earliest known inhabitants of Saint Kitts and Nevis were pre-ceramic, pre-agricultural peoples who arrived as early as 3000 BCE. These groups, often referred to as \"Archaic people,\" were hunter-gatherers who migrated down the archipelago from Florida. Due to the absence of pottery and other durable artifacts, their cultural affiliations remain uncertain. Around 100 BCE, the islands saw the arrival of the Saladoid people, a ceramic-using, agricultural society that migrated northward from the Orinoco River region in present-day Venezuela. They introduced agriculture and pottery to the islands and established settled communities.\nBy approximately 800 CE, the Igneri people, associated with the Arawak linguistic group, had settled on the islands. The Igneri were known for their peaceful nature and religious practices, and they continued the agricultural traditions of their predecessors.\nAround 1300 CE, the Kalinago people, also known as the Island Caribs, migrated to Saint Kitts and Nevis. Renowned for their seafaring skills and warrior culture, the Kalinago displaced the Igneri and established dominance over the islands. They named Saint Kitts \"Liamuiga,\" meaning \"fertile land,\" and Nevis \"Oualie,\" meaning \"land of beautiful waters.\"\nEuropean arrival and early colonial period (1493\u20131700).\nChristopher Columbus was the first European to sight the islands in 1493. The first settlers were the English in 1623, led by Thomas Warner, who established a settlement at Old Road Town on the west coast of St Kitts after achieving an agreement with the Carib chief Ouboutou Tegremante. The French later also settled on St Kitts in 1625 under Pierre Belain d'Esnambuc. As a result, both parties agreed to partition the island into French and English sectors. From 1628 onward the English also began settling on Nevis.\nThe French and English, intent on exploitation of the island's resources, encountered resistance from the native Caribs (Kalinago), who waged war during the first three years of the settlements' existence. The Europeans resolved to rid themselves of this problem. An ideological campaign was waged by colonial chroniclers, dating back to the Spanish, as they produced literature which denied the Kalinagos' humanity (a literary tradition carried through the late-seventeenth century by such authors as Jean-Baptiste du Tertre and Pere Labat). In 1626 the Anglo-French settlers joined forces to massacre the Kalinago at a place that became known as Bloody Point, allegedly to preempt a Carib plan to expel or kill all European settlers. Thereafter, the English and French established large sugar plantations which were worked by imported African slaves. This made the planter-colonists rich, but drastically altered the islands' demographics as black slaves soon came to outnumber Europeans.\nA Spanish expedition of 1629 sent to enforce Spanish claims destroyed the English and French colonies and deported the settlers back to their respective countries. As part of the war settlement in 1630, the Spanish permitted the re-establishment of the English and French colonies. Spain later formally recognised Britain's claim to St Kitts with the Treaty of Madrid (1670), in return for British cooperation in the fight against piracy.&lt;ref name=\"SP 108/470\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nAs Spanish power declined, Saint Kitts became a key base for English and French expansion in the Caribbean. From St Kitts the British settled the islands of Antigua, Montserrat, Anguilla and Tortola, and the French settled Martinique, the Guadeloupe archipelago and Saint Barth\u00e9lemy. During the late 17th century, France and England fought for control over St Kitts and Nevis, fighting wars in 1667, 1689\u201390 and 1701\u201313. The French renounced their claim to the islands with the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713. The islands' economy, already shattered by war, was further harmed by natural disasters: In 1690 an earthquake destroyed Jamestown, capital of Nevis, forcing the construction of a new capital at Charlestown. Further damage was caused by a hurricane in 1707.\nBritish colonial period (1700\u20131983).\nThe colony had recovered by the turn of the 18th century, and St Kitts had become the richest British Crown Colony per capita in the Caribbean as result of its slave-based sugar industry by the close of the 1700s. The 18th century also saw Nevis, formerly the richer of the two islands, being eclipsed by St Kitts in economic importance. Alexander Hamilton, the future U.S. secretary of the Treasury, was born on Nevis in 1755 or 1757.\nAs Britain became embroiled in war with its American colonies, the French decided to use the opportunity to re-capture St Kitts in 1782; however St Kitts was given back and recognised as British territory in the Treaty of Versailles (1783).\nThe African slave trade was terminated within the British Empire in 1807, and slavery outlawed completely in 1834. A four-year \"apprenticeship\" period followed for each slave, in which they worked for their former owners for wages. On Nevis 8,815 slaves were freed, while St Kitts freed 19,780.\nSaint Kitts and Nevis, along with Anguilla, were federated in 1882. In the first few decades of the 20th century economic hardship and lack of opportunities led to the growth of a labour movement; the Great Depression prompted sugar workers to go on strike in 1935. The 1940s saw the founding of the St Kitts-Nevis-Anguilla Labour Party (later renamed the Saint Kitts and Nevis Labour Party, or SKNLP) under Robert Llewellyn Bradshaw. Bradshaw later became Chief Minister and then Premier of the colony from 1966 to 1978; he sought to gradually bring the sugar-based economy under greater state control. The more conservative-leaning People's Action Movement party (PAM) was founded in 1965.\nAfter a brief period as part of the West Indies Federation (1958\u201362), the islands became an associated state with full internal autonomy in 1967. Residents of Nevis and Anguilla were unhappy with St Kitts's domination of the federation, and Anguilla unilaterally declared independence in 1967. In 1971 Britain resumed full control of Anguilla, but it was formally separated in 1980. Attention then focused on Nevis, with the Nevis Reformation Party seeking to safeguard the smaller island's interests in any future independent state. Eventually it was agreed that the island would have a degree of autonomy with its own Premier and Assembly, as well as the constitutionally-protected right to unilaterally secede if a referendum on independence resulted in a two-thirds majority in favour.\nPost independence era (1983\u2013present).\nSt Kitts and Nevis achieved full independence on 19 September 1983. Kennedy Simmonds of the PAM, Premier since 1980, duly became the country's first Prime Minister. St Kitts and Nevis opted to remain within the British Commonwealth, at that time retaining Queen Elizabeth as Monarch, represented locally by a Governor-General.\nKennedy Simmonds went on to win elections in 1984, 1989 and 1993, before being unseated when the SKNLP returned to power in 1995 under Denzil Douglas.\nIn Nevis, growing discontent with their perceived marginalisation within the federation led to a referendum to separate from St Kitts in 1998, which though resulting a 62% vote to secede, fell short of the required two-thirds majority to be legally enacted.\nIn late-September 1998, Hurricane Georges caused approximately $458,000,000 in damages and limited GDP growth for the year and beyond. Meanwhile, the sugar industry, in decline for years and propped up only by government subsidies, was closed completely in 2005.\nIn 2012, Saint Kitts and Nevis was declared free of malaria, according to the World Health Organization.\nThe 2015 Saint Kitts and Nevis general election was won by Timothy Harris and his recently formed People's Labour Party, with backing from the PAM and the Nevis-based Concerned Citizens' Movement under the 'Team Unity' banner.\nIn June 2020, Team Unity coalition of the incumbent government, led by Prime Minister Timothy Harris, won general elections by defeating Saint Kitts and Nevis Labour Party (SKNLP).\nIn snap general elections held in August 2022, the SKNLP again won, and Terrance Drew became the fourth prime minister of Saint Kitts and Nevis.\nPolitics.\nSaint Kitts and Nevis is a sovereign, democratic, and federal state. It is a Commonwealth realm, a constitutional monarchy with the king of Saint Christopher and Nevis, Charles III, as its head of state. The King is represented in the country by a governor-general, who acts on the advice of the prime minister and the Cabinet. The prime minister is the leader of the majority party of the House, and the cabinet conducts affairs of state.\nSt. Kitts and Nevis has a unicameral legislature, known as the National Assembly. It is composed of fourteen members: eleven elected representatives (three from the island of Nevis) and three senators, who are appointed by the Governor-General. Two of the senators are appointed on the advice of the Prime Minister, and one, on the advice of the leader of the opposition. Unlike in other countries, the senators do not constitute a separate senate or upper house of parliament, but sit in the National Assembly alongside representatives. All members serve five-year terms. The Prime Minister and the Cabinet answer to the Parliament. Nevis also maintains its own semi-autonomous assembly.\nForeign relations.\nSaint Kitts and Nevis has no major international disputes. Saint Kitts and Nevis is a full and participating member of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS), and the Organisation of American States (OAS).\nSt Kitts &amp; Nevis entered the OAS system on 16 September 1984.\nAgreements which impact on financial relationships.\nDouble Taxation Relief (CARICOM) Treaty 1994.\nAt a CARICOM meeting, representative of St. Kitts and Nevis Kennedy Simmonds signed the Double Taxation Relief (CARICOM) Treaty 1994, on 6 July 1994.\nThe representatives of seven CARICOM countries signed similar agreements at Sherbourne Conference Centre, St. Michael, Barbados. The countries whose representatives signed the treaties in Barbados were: Antigua &amp; Barbuda, Belize, Grenada, Jamaica, St. Lucia, St. Vincent &amp; the Grenadines and Trinidad and Tobago. This treaty covered income, residence, tax jurisdictions, capital gains, business profits, interest, dividends, royalties and other areas.\nFATCA.\nOn 30 June 2014, St. Kitts and Nevis signed a Model 1 agreement with the United States of America in relation to Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA).\nMilitary.\nSaint Kitts and Nevis has a defence force of 300 personnel. It is mostly involved in policing and drug trade interception.\nHuman rights.\nMale homosexuality has been legal in St. Kitts and Nevis since 29 August 2022. In 2011, the Government of St. Kitts and Nevis said it had \"no mandate from the people\" to abolish the criminalisation of homosexuality among consenting adults.\nAdministrative divisions.\nThe federation of Saint Kitts and Nevis is divided into fourteen parishes, nine of them on Saint Kitts and five on Nevis.\nGeography.\nThe capital city is Basseterre, located on the larger island of Saint Kitts. Basseterre is also the main port for passenger entry (via cruise ships) and cargo. The smaller island of Nevis lies approximately to the southeast of Saint Kitts, across a shallow channel called The Narrows.\nThe islands of Sint Eustatius, Saba, Saint Barth\u00e9lemy, Saint-Martin/Sint Maarten and Anguilla lie to the north-northwest of the country. To the east and northeast are Antigua and Barbuda, and to the southeast is the small uninhabited island of Redonda (part of Antigua and Barbuda) and the island of Montserrat.\nThe country consists of two main islands, Saint Kitts and Nevis, separated at a distance of 2 miles (3\u00a0km) by The Narrows strait. Both are of volcanic origin, with large central peaks covered in tropical rainforest. The majority of the population live along the flatter coastal areas. St Kitts contains several mountain ranges (the North West Range, Central Range and South-West Range) in its centre, where the highest peak of the country, Mount Liamuiga can be found. Along the east coast can be found the Canada Hills and Conaree Hills. The land narrows considerably in the south-east, forming a much flatter peninsula which contains the largest body of water, the Great Salt Pond. To the southeast, in The Narrows, lies the small isle of Booby Island. There are numerous rivers descending from the mountains of both islands, which provide fresh water to the local population. Nevis, the smaller of the two main islands and roughly circular in shape, is dominated by Nevis Peak .\nSaint Kitts and Nevis contains two terrestrial ecoregions: Leeward Islands moist forests and Leeward Islands dry forests. The country had a 2019 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 4.55/10, ranking it 121st globally out of 172 countries.\nFlora and fauna.\nThe national flower is \"Delonix regia\". Common plants include palmetto, hibiscus, bougainvillea, and tamarind. \"Pinus\" species are common in the dense forests of islands, and are usually covered by various species of ferns.\nThe national bird is the brown pelican. 176 species of bird have been reported from the country.\nClimate.\nBy the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, St Kitts has a tropical savanna climate (K\u00f6ppen \"Aw\") and Nevis has a tropical monsoon climate (K\u00f6ppen \"Am\"). Mean monthly temperatures in Basseterre varies little from to . Yearly rainfall is approximately , although it has varied from to in the period 1901\u20132015.\nNational parks.\nSt. Kitts and Nevis have two national parks: Brimstone Hill Fortress National Park and Central Forest Reserve National Park. Brimstone Hills Fortress was officially designated a National Park in 1985, and it was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1999. Central Forest Reserve was designated a National Park by the government on 23 October 2006, and officially gazetted on 29 March 2007.\nDemographics.\nPopulation.\nThe population of Saint Kitts and Nevis is around 53,000 (July 2019 est.) and has remained relatively constant for many years. At the end of the nineteenth century there were 42,600 residents, the number slowly rising to a little over 50,000 by the mid-twentieth century. Between 1960 and 1990, the population dropped from 50,000 to 40,000, before rising again to its current level. Approximately three-quarters of the population live on Saint Kitts, 15,500 of them in Basseterre. Other large settlements include Cayon (population 3,000) and Sandy Point Town (3,000), both on Saint Kitts, and Gingerland (2,500) and Charlestown (1,900), both on Nevis. It ranks number 209 on the list of countries and dependencies by population.\nRacial and ethnic groups.\nThe population is primarily Afro-Caribbean (92.5%), with significant minorities of European (2.1%) and Indian (1.5%) descent (2001 estimate).\nEmigration.\nAs of [ [update]], there were inhabitants; their average life expectancy is 76.9 years. Emigration has historically been very high, so high that the total estimated population in 2007 was little changed from that in 1961.\nEmigration from St Kitts and Nevis to the United States:\nLanguages.\nEnglish is the sole official language. Saint Kitts Creole is also widely spoken.\nReligion.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Pie chart/styles.css\"/&gt;\nMost inhabitants (82%) are Christians, most of whom belong to Anglican, Methodist, and other Protestant denominations. Roman Catholics are pastorally served by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Saint John's\u2013Basseterre, and Anglicans by the Diocese of the North East Caribbean and Aruba.\nHinduism is the largest non-Christian religion, followed by 1.82% of the population; these are primarily Indo-Kittitians and Indo-Nevisians.\nAccording to the 2011 census, 17 per cent of the population is Anglican, 16 per cent Methodist, 11 per cent Pentecostal, 7 per cent Church of God, 6 per cent Roman Catholic, 5 per cent each Baptist, Moravian, Seventh-day Adventist, and Wesleyan Holiness, 4 per cent \"Other\", and 2 per cent each Brethren, evangelical Christian, and Hindu.\nCulture.\nMusic and festivals.\nSaint Kitts and Nevis is known for a number of musical celebrations including Carnival (18 December to 3 January on Saint Kitts). The last week in June features the St Kitts Music Festival, while the week-long Culturama on Nevis lasts from the end of July into early August.\nAdditional festivals on the island of Saint Kitts include Inner City Fest, in February in Molineaux; Green Valley Festival, usually around Whit Monday in village of Cayon; Easterama, around Easter in village of Sandy Point; Fest-Tab, in July or August in the village of Tabernacle; and La festival de Capisterre, around Independence Day in Saint Kitts and Nevis (19 September), in the Capisterre region. These celebrations typically feature parades, street dances and salsa, jazz, soca, calypso and steelpan music.\nThe 1985 film \"\" was filmed in Saint Kitts.\nSports.\nCricket is common in Saint Kitts and Nevis. Top players can be selected for the West Indies cricket team. The late Runako Morton was from Nevis. Saint Kitts and Nevis was the smallest country to host 2007 Cricket World Cup matches, which were played at the Warner Park Stadium.\nRugby and netball are also common in Saint Kitts and Nevis as well.\nThe St Kitts and Nevis national football team, also known as the \"Sugar Boyz\", has experienced some international success in recent years, progressing to the semi-final round of qualification for the 2006 FIFA World Cup in the CONCACAF region. Led by Glence Glasgow, they defeated the US Virgin Islands and Barbados before they were outmatched by Mexico, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, and Trinidad and Tobago. Atiba Harris is the first footballer from the country to play in Major League Soccer and arguably the most famous footballer from the country. He is the current President of the SKNFA. Despite not representing the country, Marcus Rashford is of descent, as is Cole Palmer.\nThe national team achieved its greatest success of the modern era when it qualified for the 2023 CONCACAF Gold Cup defeating the Cura\u00e7ao national football team and the French Guiana national football team in a penalty shootout in the preliminary round. It was drawn into Group A with Jamaica, the United States, and Trinidad &amp; Tobago, but lost all three games.\nThe St Kitts and Nevis Billiard Federation, SKNBF, is the governing body for cue sports across the two islands. The SKNBF is a member of the Caribbean Billiards Union (CBU) with the SKNBF President Ste Williams holding the post of CBU Vice-president.\nKim Collins is the country's foremost track and field athlete. He has won gold medals in the 100\u00a0metres at both the World Championships in Athletics and Commonwealth Games, and at the 2000 Sydney Olympics he was the country's first athlete to reach an Olympic final. He and three other athletes represented St Kitts and Nevis at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. The four by one hundred metre relay team won a bronze medal at the 2011 world championships. Jason Rogers, Antoine Adams, and Brijesh Lawrence ran the other three relay legs with Collins.\nAmerican writer and former figure skater and triathlete Kathryn Bertine was granted dual citizenship in an attempt to make the 2008 Summer Olympics representing St Kitts and Nevis in women's cycling. Her story was chronicled online at ESPN.com as a part of its E-Ticket feature entitled \"So You Wanna Be An Olympian?\" She ultimately failed to earn the necessary points for Olympic qualification.\nSt Kitts and Nevis had two athletes ride in the time trial at the 2010 UCI Road World Championships: Reginald Douglas and James Weekes.\nEconomy.\nSaint Kitts and Nevis is a twin-island federation whose economy is characterised by its dominant tourism, agriculture, and light manufacturing industries. Sugar was the primary export from the 1940s on, but rising production costs, low world market prices, and the government's efforts to reduce dependence on it have led to a growing diversification of the agricultural sector. In 2005, the government decided to close down the state-owned sugar company, which had experienced losses and was a significant contributor to the fiscal deficit. In the 21st century, the government has sought to diversify the economy via agriculture, tourism, export-oriented manufacturing, and offshore banking.\nIn July 2015, St Kitts &amp; Nevis and the Republic of Ireland signed a tax agreement to \"promote international co-operation in tax matters through exchange of information.\" The agreement was developed by the OECD Global Forum Working Group on Effective Exchange of Information, which consisted of representatives from OECD member countries and 11 other countries in the Caribbean and other parts of the world.\nTourism.\nSt Kitts and Nevis is heavily dependent upon tourism to drive its economy, a sector which has expanded significantly since the 1970s. In 2009 there were 587,479 arrivals to Saint Kitts compared to 379,473 in 2007, an increase of just under 40% in a two-year period; however, the tourist sector declined during the Great Recession and then rebounded slowly.\nTransport.\nSaint Kitts and Nevis has two international airports. The larger one is Robert L. Bradshaw International Airport on the island of Saint Kitts with service outside to the Caribbean, North America, and Europe. The other airport, Vance W. Amory International Airport, is located on the island of Nevis and has flights to other parts of the Caribbean.\nThe St Kitts Scenic Railway is the last remaining running railroad in the Lesser Antilles.\nEconomic citizenship by investment.\nSt. Kitts and Nevis allows foreigners to obtain the status of St. Kitts and Nevis citizen by means of a government sponsored investment programme called Citizenship-by-Investment. Established in 1984, St. Kitts and Nevis's citizenship programme is the oldest prevailing economic citizenship programme of this kind in the world. However, while the programme is the oldest in the world, it only catapulted in 2006 when Henley &amp; Partners, a global citizenship advisory firm, became involved in the restructuring of the programme to incorporate donations to the country's sugar industry.\nCitizenship-by-Investment Programmes have been criticised by some researchers due to the risks of corruption, money laundering and tax evasion. According to the official website of St. Kitts and Nevis's Citizenship-by-Investment Programme, they offer multiple benefits, including citizenship for life that can be passed down for generations, no residency or language requirements, and citizenship in a financially favourable country. Applicants who are vetted and successfully attain citizenship are eligible to apply for a Saint Kitts and Nevis passport.\nTo qualify for citizenship under the investment programme, each candidate must complete a vetting process which includes several background and due diligence checks, an interview, and other various legal requirements. This is followed by a qualifying investment into the country. The applicant must make at least a minimum investment in either approved real estate; or a donation, known as the \"Sustainable Island State Contribution (SISC)\" into the Federal Consolidated Fund; or a donation to an Approved Public Benefactor.\nThe official website of St. Kitts and Nevis's Citizenship-by-Investment Programme lists the following investment options:\nEducation.\nThere are eight publicly administered high and secondary level schools in St. Kitts and Nevis, and several private secondary schools. Education is compulsory between the ages of 5 and 16.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Despite being only two miles apart and quite diminutive in size, Saint Kitts and Nevis were widely recognized as being separate entities with distinct identities until they were forcibly united in the late 19th century.\nPre-Columbian Period (2900 BC \u2013 1493 AD).\nThe first natives to live on the islands, as early as 3,000 years ago, were called Ciboney. However, the lack of pottery makes their origin and timeline uncertain. They were followed by the Arawak peoples, or Taino in 800 AD.\nThe warlike Island Caribs followed and had expanded north of St. Kitts by the time of the Spanish conquest. Peak native populations occurred between 500 and 600 AD.\nThe First Europeans (1493\u20131623).\nThe first Europeans to see and name the islands were the Spanish under Christopher Columbus, who sighted the islands on 11 and 13 November 1493 during his second voyage. He named Saint Kitts San Jorge (Saint George) and Nevis San Martin (sighted on Saint Martin's Day). By 1540, Nieves was used by the Spanish, an abbreviation of Santa Maria de las Nieves, a reference to its cloud cover resembling snow.\nPrivateer Francis Drake mentions visiting Saint Christophers Island in 1585 during Christmas.\nThe next European encounter occurred in June 1603, when Bartholomew Gilbert gathered Lignum vitae on Nevis before stopping at St. Kitts. In 1607, Captain John Smith stopped at Nevis for five days on his way to founding the first successful settlement in Virginia. Smith documented the many hot springs in Nevis, whose waters had remarkable curative abilities against skin ailments and bad health. Robert Harcourt stopped at Nevis in 1608.\nSaint Kitts and Nevis (1623\u20131700).\nIn 1620, Ralph Merifield and Sir Thomas Warner received from King James I, a Royal Patent to colonize the Leeward Islands, but with overall authority through James Hay, 1st Earl of Carlisle. Merifield and Warner formed the company Merwars Hope, which was renamed Society of Adventurers, which merged into the Royal African Company in 1664. Warner arrived on St. Kitts on 7 February 1624 (N.S., \"28 January 1623\" or 1623/4 O.S.; with 15 settlers and came to terms with the Carib Chief Ouboutou Tegremante. Three Frenchmen were already on the island, either Huguenot refugees, pirates, or castaways. The Hurricane of September 1623 wiped out their tobacco and vegetable crop, yet the colony survived and grew. \"Hopewell\" arrived in 1624, and included Warner's friend Colonel John Jaeffreson, who built Wingfield Manor. This Jaeffreson may have been an ancestor of Thomas Jefferson's.\nIn 1625, a French captain, Pierre Belain d'Esnambuc, arrived on St. Kitts aboard his 14-gun brigantine and a crew of 40. He had escaped a three-hour battle with a 35-gun Spanish warship near the Cayman Islands. In 1627, Warner and d'Esnambuc split the island in four quarters, with the English controlling the middle half and the French the end quarters. Cardinal Richelieu formed the Compagnie de Saint-Christophe in 1626, and 40 slaves were purchased from Senegal. By 1635, the number of slaves on St. Kitts had grown to 500\u2013600, and by 1665 the French West India Company replaced the Compagnie.\nAs the European population on Saint Kitts continued to increase, Chief Tegremond grew hostile to the foreigners in 1626, and plotted their elimination with the help of other Island Caribs. However, a native woman named Barbe informed Warner and d'Esnambuc of the plot and they decided to take action. The Europeans acted by getting the Indians intoxicated at a party before returning to their village, where 120 were killed in their sleep. The following day, at a site now called Bloody Point, with a ravine known as Bloody River, over 2,000 Caribs were massacred. By 1640, the remaining Caribs not enslaved on St. Kitts, Nevis, and Antigua, were removed to Dominica.\nIn 1628, Warner allowed Anthony Hilton to settle Nevis, along with 80 others from St. Kitts. Hilton had recently escaped murder by his indentured servant, and decided to sell his St. Kitts' plantation. Hilton's 80 were joined by 100 other settlers, originally bound for Barbuda.\nThe 1629 English colonization was led by George Donne. Both powers then proceeded to colonise neighbouring islands from their bases. The English settled Nevis (1628), Antigua (1632), Montserrat (1632) and later Anguilla (1650) and Tortola (1672). The French colonised Martinique (1635), the Guadeloupe archipelago (1635), St Martin (1648), St Barths (1648), and Saint Croix (1650).\nSaint Kitts and Nevis suffered heavily from a Spanish raid in 1629, led by Fadrique de Toledo, 1st Marquis of Villanueva de Valdueza. All settlements were destroyed, nine hostages taken back to Spain, and 600 men taken to work the mines in Spanish America. Four ships were supposed to carry the rest back to England, but they returned to the islands soon after the Spanish departed. This was the only Spanish attempt to keep the English and French out of the Leeward Islands.\nDuring the Battle of the Fig Tree in 1635, the French forcefully removed English settlers who had encroached into the French portion of St. Kitts. The French used 250 armed slaves in the conflict.\nThe islands' earliest cash crop was tobacco, along with ginger and indigo dye. However, production from the Caribbean and North American colonies deflated the price resulting in an 18-month moratorium on St. Kitts tobacco farming in 1639. This prompted the production of sugar from sugar cane on St. Kitts in 1643, and on Nevis in 1648. Windmills were built to crush the canes and extract the juice. The planters grew prosperous and even rich, where Nevis became the richest British colony in the western hemisphere by 1652. By 1776, St. Kitts was the richest British colony per capita. Though indentured servants were common amongst the islands, fewer than half survived their servitude, and field work required African slaves. There were twice the number of slaves to Europeans on St. Kitts by the end of the 17th century. In 1675, the population on Nevis was about 8,000, half black. By 1780, the Nevis population had grown to 10,000, 90% black. The slaves had very harsh living and working conditions, only lasting eight to twelve years in the fields, and by the 18th century, two-fifths died within a year of arrival. About 22% died on the Middle Passage.\nWith the death of d'Esnambuc in 1635, Phillippe de Longvilliers de Poincy became Lieutenant General of the Isles of America and Captain-General of St. Christopher on 20 February 1639. The King of France had sold the French portion of the island to the Order of Saint John. Dissatisfied with the independence of de Poincy, the King of France sent Noel de Patrocles de Thoisy to replace him. However, De Thoisy was repulsed, captured and sent back to France, along with his allies the Capuchin monks. De Poincy started construction of his Ch\u00e2teau de la Montagne in 1642, where he resided until his death in 1650. He was succeeded by Governor de Sales.\nIn 1652, Prince Rupert's squadron visited Nevis and exchanged fire with the Pelican Point Fort, following the Royalist defeat in the English Civil War.\nDuring the Second Anglo-Dutch War, the relationship between the French and English settlers soured, as their home countries warred. On 21 April 1666, French Governor Charles de Sales gathered 800 troops and 150\u2013200 slaves at Palmetto Point. As the French advanced towards Sandy Point, where English Governor William Watts waited, the French were ambushed by 400 English troops and de Sales was killed. Claude de Roux de Saint-Laurent took over command as the French counter-attacked, forcing the English to retreat. On 22 April, during the Battle of Sandy Point, 1,400 English troops under the command of Governor Watts, which included 260 of Colonel Morgan's buccaneers, failed to stop 350 French. Governor Watts was killed, and the English spiked their guns at Fort Charles before fleeing to Old Road Town. Many of the English then fled to Nevis as the French took control of St. Kitts. The French then tried to take Nevis, but were turned back by the English at Pinney's Beach. English reinforcements to Nevis failed to arrive when Willoughby's fleet sank in the 15 August 1666 hurricane. \"Armes d'Angleterre\" set out from Basseterre in April 1667 with Joseph-Antoine de La Barre aboard. The French ship encountered HMS \"Winchester\", the start of an English blockade, and engaged in a long running battle before sinking her and eventually returning to St. Kitts. Finally, the English turned back an attempted invasion of Nevis in May 1667 during the Battle of Nevis. However, the Treaty of Breda restored the status quo.\nThe 1670 Treaty of Madrid meant the recognition of English colonies in the Caribbean by Spain in return for the curtailment of pirate attacks. England established the Admiralty Court in Nevis as a consequence. Those found guilty of piracy were hanged at Gallows Bay.\nIn 1689, during the War of the Grand Alliance, French Governor de Salnave sent troops to plunder the English side, with Irish assistance, while Count de Blanc's fleet arrived in Basseterre with 1,200 troops. The French sieged English Governor Thomas Hill's troops at Fort Charles, forcing their surrender on 15 August 1689. The English were once again sent to Nevis while the Irish took over their plantations. On 24 June 1690, Leeward Islands Governor Sir Christopher Codrington and Sir Timothy Thornhill, operating from Nevis, landed an English force of 3,000 men on St. Kitts. Operating from Timothy's Beach and Frigate Bay, they march into Basseterre and then sieged the French at Fort Charles. The French surrendered on 16 July and were deported to Santo Domingo. The French had used cannon on Brimstone Hill in their 1689 siege, and in 1690 the British began construction on Brimstone Hill Fortress. The Treaty of Rijswijk in 1697 restored the status quo. An interesting side note is that Capt. William Kidd's privateer \"Blessed William\" assisted Codrington during this war.\nIn 1690, a massive earthquake and tsunami destroyed the city of Jamestown, then the capital of Nevis. So much damage was done to it that the city was completely abandoned. It is reputed that the whole city sank into the sea, but since then, the land has moved over at least to the west. That means that anything left of Jamestown would now be underground, near where Fort Ashby was built in 1701. The capital was moved south to the town of Charlestown.\nSaint Kitts and Nevis (1700\u20131883).\nSaint Kitts and Nevis were to face more devastation during the War of the Spanish Succession, though the local impact of that conflict started with the French Governor of St. Christopher, Count Jean-Baptiste de Gennes, surrendering the island without a fight to Sir Christopher Codrington, governor of the English Leewards, and Colonel Walter Hamilton in 1702. The French inhabitants of St. Kitts were peacefully removed to other islands. The French retaliated in 1705 with a five-day bombardment of Nevis by Admiral Count Louis-Henri de Chavagnac before he proceeded to St. Kitts. There the French pillaged the English quarter after landing on Frigate Bay, carrying off 600\u2013700 slaves. Then on Good Friday 1706, the French under the command of Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville attacked Nevis, capturing Fort Charles then looting and burning Charlestown. Once again, 3,400 slaves were taken, though several more escaped to Maroon Hill and formed a slave army, which effectively resisted a French attack. Before departing Nevis, the French left Nevis in ruins, including its sugar works. The 1707 hurricane did further damage to Nevis. It would be 80 years before sugar production on Nevis reached the level achieved in 1704. The Treaty of Utrecht was signed in 1713, in which the French ceded their portion of St Kitts to the British.\nBy 1720, the population of St. Kitts exceeded that of Nevis for the first time. In 1724, the population of Saint Kitts consisted of 4000 whites and 11,500 blacks, while Nevis had 1,100 whites and 4,400 blacks. By 1774, the population on St. Kitts was 1,900 white and 23,462 black, while Nevis had 1,000 whites and 10,000 blacks.\nUpon gaining control of the whole island in 1713, the British soon moved the island's capital to the town of Basseterre in 1727, and St Kitts quickly took off as a leader in sugar production in the Caribbean. Whilst conditions on St Kitts improved, Nevis was seeing a decline. The years of monocrop cultivation, as well as heavy amounts of soil erosion due to the high slope grade on the island, caused its sugar production to continuously decrease.\nAlexander Hamilton, the first United States Secretary of the Treasury, was born in Nevis; he spent his childhood there and on St. Croix, then belonging to Denmark, and now one of the United States Virgin Islands.\nJames Ramsay (abolitionist) was ordained a priest at Saint John Capisterre Parish in 1762. He continued his abolitionist activities and concern for the welfare of slaves until he left the island in 1781.\nJohn Huggins built the first Caribbean resort hotel in 1778. The Bath Hotel was constructed over the site of one of the island's famous hot springs, Bath Spring. The island thus became the first place in the Americas to officially practice tourism. Nevis's popularity as a destination grew, and it continued to be in the favour of the British upper classes, including Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Lord Nelson, and Prince William Henry, until it closed in the 1870s. The hotel opened briefly from 1910 to the 1930s, after refurbishment by the Gillespie Brothers. It housed troops in World War II, and the Police Department and Magistrate's Court from 1995 to 1999.\nBy 1776, Saint Kitts had become the richest British colony in the Caribbean, per capita. Attacks by the French occurred at the end of the throughout the 18th century, including the Siege of Brimstone Hill and the Battle of Saint Kitts in 1782. The consolidation of British rule was recognized finally under the Treaty of Versailles in 1783.\nOn 11 March 1787, Captain Nelson was married to Frances Woolward Nisbet, niece of John Herbert, President of the Nevis Council. They were married at Montpelier Plantation, with Prince William Henry acting as best man.\nIn 1799, USS \"Constellation\" engaged the French commerce raider \"L'Insurgent\" off Nevis during the Quasi-War. The American vessel won a first victory for the United States Navy, bringing the captured French commerce raider back to St. Kitts.\nIn 1804, the French Admiral \u00c9douard Thomas Burgues de Missiessy and General La Grange forced Nevis and St. Kitts to pay ransoms of 4,000 and 18,000 pounds respectively. This was followed by J\u00e9r\u00f4me Bonaparte's raid in 1806.\nIn 1806, the Leeward Islands Caribee government was split into two groups, with Antigua, Barbuda, Redonda and Montserrat in one group, and St Kitts, Nevis, Anguilla and the British Virgin Islands in the other. The islands in the new grouping however, were able to keep their great degrees of autonomy. The grouping then split entirely in 1816.\nLord Combermere bought Russell's Rest Plantation following the defeat of France in the Battle of Waterloo. Combermere Village and School are named after him.\nThe Roman Catholic religion was practiced by the French, and the Church of England by the English, yet a Jewish synagogue existed on Nevis since 1684. The Moravian Church was established on St. Kitts in 1777, and numbered 2,500 by 1790. Bishop Thomas Coke paid his first of three visits to Nevis and St. Kitts in 1788, establishing the Methodist Church on the island. Membership grew to 1,800 on Nevis and 1,400 on St. Kitts by 1789.\nIn 1824, the Cottle Church was established on Nevis, welcoming slaves and masters alike.\nAbolition of slave trade and slavery.\nThe African slave trade was terminated within the British Empire in 1807.\nThen, the great slave revolt in Jamaica precipitated the abolition of slavery in the British colonies, proclaimed on 1 August 1834. A four-year \"apprenticeship\" period followed for each slave, in which they worked for their former owners for wages. On Nevis 8,815 slaves were freed in this way, while St. Kitts had 19,780 freed.\nHowever, the British Crown accompanied this abolition with substantial compensation for the planters for the loss of their slaves. Compensation was calculated according to the number of people enslaved, their age, their sex, and their position. To finance compensation in all its slave colonies, the British government negotiated a colossal loan of 15 million pounds sterling (equivalent to approximately \u00a320bn in 2020) with financiers Nathan Mayer Rothschild and Moses Montefiore on 3 August 1835. The repayment of this debt was not completed until 2015, almost two centuries later.\nThe 1835 hurricane, followed by the drought of 1836\u20131838 and the fire of 1837, devastated Nevis. Sugar prices continued their decline due to production in other parts of the world where costs were cheaper, so that by 1842, Nevis saw a decline in its population as workers fled the island, if unwilling to stay and make a living sharecropping in Nevis' increasingly less fertile soil. St. Kitts' soil was not so depleted. Then several earthquakes struck in 1843, followed by a cholera epidemic in 1853\u201354, killing more than 800 on Nevis and 3920 on St. Kitts.\nIn 1872, St. Kitts was connected to the international telegraph system. However, the connection did not extend to Nevis until 1925.\nThe Federation of the Leeward Islands Colony of 1871 meant the end of elected Assemblies, but were instead appointed. In 1883, the governments of St Kitts, Nevis and Anguilla were combined into the St. Kitts Assembly. Of the ten seats in the Assembly, Nevis had two while Anguilla had one.\nSaint Kitts and Nevis (1883 \u2013 present).\nSubsidized beet sugar production put wage pressures on the islands, which resulted in the Portuguese Riots of 1896. It took marines from to restore order. By 1900 there were 61 estates on Nevis utilizing the sharecropping system, while St. Kitts only had 2.\nThe 1899 San Ciriaco hurricane left 27 dead on Nevis and 2 on St. Kitts. The Nevis hospital was destroyed and 8,000 left homeless.\nThe St. Kitts Sugar Producers Association built a central factory for sugar refining and a railway for transportation in 1912. The London Electric Theatre opened on St. Kitts in 1917. A telephone system was built on St. Kitts in 1896 and included Nevis by 1913. Nevis' first automobile arrived in 1912, a Ford Model T.\nTheodore Roosevelt and his wife Edith Roosevelt visited St. Kitts in 1916.\nCotton production supplemented sugar during World War I, but declined in 1922 after the boll weevil appeared. The Great Depression meant the government became the largest landowner on Nevis as estates were abandoned or were requisitioned for failure to pay taxes. From 1900 to 1929, the population on St. Kitts declined by 43%, while on Nevis it declined by 9%.\nIn 1951, the islands were granted the right to vote, with the first election held in 1952.\nSugar production continued to dominate the lives of the islanders. The dominance by estate owners of the island's only and extremely limited natural resource, the land, and the single-minded application of that resource to one industry precluded the development of a stable peasant class. Instead, the system produced a large class of wage labourers generally resentful of foreign influence. The nature of the sugar industry itself\u2014the production of a nonstaple and essentially nonnutritive commodity for a widely fluctuating world market\u2014only served to deepen this hostility and to motivate Kittitian labourers to seek greater control over their working lives and their political situation. The collapse of sugar prices brought on by the Great Depression precipitated the birth of the organized labour movement in St. Kitts and Nevis. The Workers League, organized by Thomas Manchester of Sandy Point in 1932, tapped the popular frustration that fueled the labor riots of 1935\u201336. Rechristened the St. Kitts and Nevis Trades and Labour Union in 1940 and under the new leadership of Robert Llewellyn Bradshaw, the union established a political arm, the St. Kitts and Nevis Labour Party, which put Bradshaw in the Legislative Council in 1946. The Labour Party would go on to dominate political life in the twin-island state for more than thirty years.\nElectricity first came to Nevis in 1954.\nThe islands remained in the Leeward Islands Federation until they joined the failed West Indies Federation from 1958 to 1962, in which Saint Christopher-Nevis-Anguilla was a separate state. Robert Bradshaw was the Minister of Finance for the short-lived country.\nIn 1967, the islands became an Associated State of Britain.\nIn the same year Anguilla had a major secession movement supported by St. Kitts' political opposition party, The People's Action Movement (PAM). Both forces, working together, invaded the island from an Anguillian base in an attempted coup d'\u00e9tat. Anguilla was able to successfully break away from the union in 1971.\nIn 1970 there was a serious maritime incident, the \"Christena\" disaster, the sinking of an overloaded ferry boat, with much loss of life.\nDuring Bradshaw's long tenure, his government slowly moved into a statist approach to economic development in 1972. All sugar lands were bought by the government, as well as the nationalization of the sugar factory in 1976.\nOpposition to Bradshaw's rule began to build, especially by the families and supporters of former estate owners, who founded the People's Action Movement party in 1964, after frustration over a failed demonstration against a raise in electricity rates. Opposition was especially great in Nevis, who felt that their island was being neglected and unfairly deprived of revenue, investment and services by its larger neighbour. Bradshaw mainly ignored Nevis' complaints, but Nevisian disenchantment with the Labour Party proved a key factor in the party's eventual fall from power.\nIn 1978 Bradshaw died of prostate cancer. He was succeeded by his former deputy, Paul Southwell, but in 1979, Southwell himself died (under mysterious circumstances) in St. Lucia. Accompanying Interim Premier Caleb Azariah Paul Southwell, was Lee Llewellyn Moore the Attorney General, and next in seniority of the St. Kitts Labour Party. The Political organization eventually fell into a crisis of leadership, but Lee Moore was selected. Regardless, many Labour Supporters had their suspicions about Southwell's death, and many chose to vote \"PAM\" the following year in the General Elections.\nTaking advantage of the Labour Party's confusion, the PAM party was very successful in the 1980 elections, winning three seats on St. Kitts, compared to the Labour Party's four. The Nevis Reformation Party, under the leadership of Simeon Daniel, won two of the three seats on Nevis. PAM and NRP then formed a coalition government, naming Kennedy Simmonds, a medical doctor and one of the founders of the PAM, premier (Simmonds had won Bradshaw's former seat in a 1979 by-election). The change in government reduced the demand for Nevis' secession.\nIndependence since 1983.\nIn 1983, the federation was granted independence from Britain, with a constitution that granted Nevis a large degree of autonomy as well as the guaranteed right of secession. To take advantage of this landmark, early elections were called in 1984, in which the NRP captured all three seats on Nevis, and the PAM party capturing six seats on St. Kitts, compared to the Labour Party's two, despite overall the Labour Party winning the nationwide popular vote. The new coalition government now had a strong 9 to 2 mandate in parliament.\nEconomic improvement for St. Kitts followed, with the PAM party shifting focus from the sugar industry to tourism. However, much of the island's poorest people, mainly the sugar workers, were neglected. Opposition to PAM began to build from this, as well as on accusations of corruption. In the 1993 elections, both PAM and Labour took four seats each, whilst on Nevis, a new party, the Concerned Citizens Movement, took two seats, beating the NRP's one. The stalemate on St. Kitts proved unresolvable when the CCM in Nevis refused to form a coalition with PAM. Rioting soon followed on the islands, which was finally resolved in a special set of elections held in 1995, in which the Labour Party overwhelmingly defeated the PAM party, winning seven seats compared to PAM's one. Dr. Denzil Douglas became the new prime minister of the federation.\nOn 21 September 1998, Hurricane Georges severely damaged the islands, leaving nearly $500 million of damage to property. Georges was the worst hurricane to hit the region in the 20th century.\nIn 2005, St. Kitts saw the closure of its sugar industry by the Douglas administration, after 365 years in the monoculture. This was explained as due to the industry's huge losses, as well as to market threats by the European Union, which had plans to cut sugar prices greatly in the near future. Since that time tourism has been the main focus of the economy.\nThe 2015 Saint Kitts and Nevis general election was won by Timothy Harris and his recently formed People's Labour Party, with backing from the PAM and the Nevis-based Concerned Citizens' Movement under the 'Team Unity' banner.\nIn June 2020, Team Unity coalition of the incumbent government, led by Prime Minister Timothy Harris, won general elections by defeating St. Kitts and Nevis Labour Party (SKNLP).\nIn the general election on 5 August 2022, Terrance Drew was elected as the fourth and current prime minister of Saint Kitts and Nevis after his St. Kitts-Nevis Labour Party (SKNLP) won snap general election.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;*British colonization of the Americas\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nhttps://"}

The island of St. Kitts, the larger of the two, is in size and is located at latitude 17.30 N, and longitude 62.80 W. Nevis is and located at latitude 17.10 N, longitude 62.35 W, approximately 3\u00a0km south-east of St. Kitts. The islands are about one-third of the way from Puerto Rico to Trinidad and Tobago. The islands are volcanic and mountainous.\nGeology.\nThe island of St. Kitts is composed almost exclusively of volcanic rocks of andesite or dacite mineralogy. Its geology is similar to that of other volcanic islands in the Lesser Antillean Archipelago. The islands are the summits of a submerged mountain range which forms the eastern boundary of what is known as the Caribbean Tectonic Plate. St. Kitts is oriented northwest\u2013southeast, about 80\u00a0km long and 16\u00a0km wide. The entire island archipelago is geologically young, having begun to form probably less than 50 million years ago, during the Miocene era. Volcanic activity occurred along the ridges of this arc during the Miocene era and has continued since.\nNevis is a volcanic island that began its formation in mid-Pliocene times (approximately 3.45 million years ago). However, the island comprises a number of discrete eruptive centers that range in age from mid-Pliocene to Pleistocene, these prevent any single model of the island's geological evolution. The geology of Nevis can be subdivided into four informal units: Volcanic of the eruptive centers, volcanogenic rocks - pyroclastics and lahars, fluviatile and lacustrine deposits, and raised beaches.\nStatistics.\nMap references:\nCentral America and the Caribbean\nArea:\n\"total:\"\n261\u00a0km2 (Saint Kitts 168\u00a0km2; Nevis 93\u00a0km2)\n\"land:\"\n261\u00a0km2\n\"water:\"\n0\u00a0km2\nArea - comparative:\ntwo thirds the size of the island of Barbados\nCoastline:\n135\u00a0km\nMaritime claims:\n\"continental shelf:\"\n200 nautical miles (370\u00a0km) or to the edge of the continental margin\n\"territorial sea:\"\n12 nautical miles (22\u00a0km)\n\"contiguous zone:\"\n24 nautical miles (44\u00a0km)\n\"exclusive economic zone:\"\n200 nautical miles (370\u00a0km)\nClimate:\ntropical tempered by constant sea breezes; little seasonal temperature variation; rainy season (May to November)\nExtreme points:\nNorthernmost point: Unnamed headland at Dieppe Bay Town, Saint Kitts\nSouthernmost point: Devil's Cave, Saint John Figtree Parish, Nevis\nWesternmost point: Western cape of Saint Kitts, Saint Anne Sandy Point Parish\nEasternmost point: Eastern cape of Nevis, Saint James Windward Parish\nlowest point:\nCaribbean Sea 0 m\nhighest point:\nMount Liamuiga 1,156 m\nNatural resources:\narable land\nLand use:\n\"arable land:\"\n19.44%\n\"permanent crops:\"\n2.78%\n\"other:\"\n77.78% (2005)\nNatural hazards:\nhurricanes (July to October)\nEnvironment - international agreements:\n\"party to:\"\nBiodiversity, Climate Change, Desertification, Endangered Species, Hazardous Wastes, Law of the Sea, Ozone Layer Protection, Ship Pollution, Whaling\nClimate.\nBy the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, St. Kitts has a tropical savanna climate (K\u00f6ppen \"Aw\") and Nevis has a tropical monsoon climate (K\u00f6ppen \"Am\").

It is an independent Commonwealth realm with Charles III as its king, viceregally represented by a governor-general. He acts on the advice of the prime minister, who is the majority party leader in the National Assembly, and who, with a cabinet, conducts affairs of state.\nGeneral aspects.\nSt Kitts and Nevis has a single National Assembly responsible for making laws, and comprising 14 or 15 members depending upon circumstances. 11 of these are directly elected \"representatives\" whilst three are \"senators\" appointed by the governor-general (two on the advice of the prime minister and the third on the advice of the leader of the opposition). If the attorney general isn't appointed as a senator then he automatically gets a seat as one, increasing the number of senators to four. Of the 11 elected members, eight represent constituencies in St Kitts and the remaining three represent Nevis seats.\nThe prime minister in this system is appointed by the governor-general from among the representatives, with the constitutional duty of selecting someone likely to command the support of the majority of representatives. Typically, this means the leader of the majority party or coalition. If no suitable candidate is identified, the governor-general has the authority to dissolve the assembly, triggering a general election. Other ministers are also appointed by the governor-general, based on the advice of the prime minister. The prime minister can be removed from office either by the assembly or by the governor-general if the prime minister loses the support of the majority of representatives. The assembly is elected every five years unless the governor-general dissolves it earlier, which can be done on the advice of the prime minister.\nSt Kitts and Nevis has enjoyed a long history of free and fair elections, although the outcome of elections in 1993 was strongly protested by the opposition and the Regional Security System (RSS) was briefly deployed to restore order. The elections in 1995 were contested by the two major parties, the ruling People's Action Movement (PAM) and the St Kitts and Nevis Labour Party. Labour won seven of the 11 seats, with Dr Denzil Douglas becoming prime minister. In the March 2000 elections, Denzil Douglas and the Labour Party were returned to power, winning eight of the 11 seats in the House. The Nevis-based Concerned Citizens Movement (CCM) won two seats and the Nevis Reformation Party (NRP) won one seat. The PAM party was unable to obtain a seat.\nThe 2015 Saint Kitts and Nevis general election was won by Timothy Harris and his recently formed People's Labour Party, with backing from the PAM and the Nevis-based Concerned Citizens' Movement under the 'Team Unity' banner. \nIn June 2020, Team Unity coalition of the incumbent government, led by Prime Minister Timothy Harris, won general elections by defeating St Kitts and Nevis Labour Party (SKNLP). In the general election on 5 August 2022, Terrance Drew was elected as the fourth and current prime minister of Saint Kitts and Nevis after his St. Kitts-Nevis Labour Party (SKNLP) won snap general election.\nUnder the constitution, Nevis has considerable autonomy and has an island assembly, a premier, and a deputy governor-general. Under certain specified conditions, it may secede from the federation. In accordance with its rights under the Constitution, in 1996 the Nevis Island Administration under the Concerned Citizens' Movement (CCM) of Premier Vance Amory initiated steps towards secession from the Federation, the most recent being a referendum in 1998 that failed to secure the required two-thirds majority for secession. The March 2000 election results placed Vance Armory, as head of the CCM, the leader of the country's opposition party. In the September 7, 2001 elections in Nevis for the Nevis Island Administration, the CCM won four of the five seats available, while the NRP won one. In 2003, the Nevis Island Administration again proposed secession and initiated formal constitutional procedures to hold a referendum on the issue, which was held in early 2004. While opposing secession, the Government acknowledged the constitutional rights of Nevisians to determine their future independence. Constitutional safeguards include freedom of speech, press, worship, movement, and association. The most recent elections in Nevis took place on July 10, 2006. Amory's CCM was defeated by the NRP of Joseph Parry, winning only two out of the five elective seats. Parry was sworn in as the third Premier of Nevis a day later.\nIts judicial system is modelled on British practice and procedure and its jurisprudence on English common law. The Royal St Kitts and Nevis Police Force has about 370 members.\nExecutive branch.\nAs head of state, King Charles III is vice-regally represented by a Governor-General who acts on the advice of the prime minister. Following legislative elections, the leader of the majority party or leader of a majority coalition is usually appointed prime minister by the governor-general. All other ministerial appointments, including that of deputy prime minister, are made by the governor-general, but acting upon the advice of the prime minister.\nJudicial branch.\nEastern Caribbean Supreme Court (based on Saint Lucia); one judge of the Supreme Court resides in Saint Kitts.\nThe Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in London is the highest appellate court.\nAdministrative divisions.\nThe country is divided in 14 parishes: Christ Church Nichola Town, Saint Anne Sandy Point, Saint George Basseterre, Saint George Gingerland, Saint James Windward, Saint John Capisterre, Saint John Figtree, Saint Mary Cayon, Saint Paul Capisterre, Saint Paul Charlestown, Saint Peter Basseterre, Saint Thomas Lowland, Saint Thomas Middle Island, Trinity Palmetto Point.\nInternational organisation participation.\nACP, Caricom, CDB, Commonwealth of Nations ECLAC, FAO, G-77, IBRD, ICFTU, ICRM, IDA, IFAD, IFC, IFRCS, ILO, IMF, Interpol, IOC, NAM OAS, OECS, OPANAL, OPCW, UN, UNCTAD, UNESCO, UNIDO, UPU, WCL, WHO, WIPO, WTrO\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Charlestown, Nevis is the equivalent hub in Nevis. Driving is on the left.\nThe speed limit in settled areas is 40\u00a0km/h, with special caution to be taken around school zones. In rural areas the speed limit is 60\u00a0km/h.\nThe total length of roads in Saint Christopher and Nevis is 320\u00a0km. In 1999 it was estimated that 136\u00a0km were paved, and 184\u00a0km were unpaved.\nPublic buses.\nThe public buses are privately owned, but government-licensed, vans. They sometimes have a decorative name on the front, and they all have a \"green\" licence plate where the number starts with the letter \"H\" or \"HA\".\nA bus may be flagged down anywhere along its route (not just at bus stop shelters), and the bus will also stop anywhere along its route (on request) to let off a passenger.\nAll bus fees (in Eastern Caribbean or EC dollars) are $2.50 for a trip of 5 miles or under, $3.00 for a trip of 5 to 10 miles, and $3.75 for a trip over 10 miles. ($1 US = $2.7 EC)\nDestinations off of the main route are often possible on request, at the discretion of the driver, on payment of a small extra charge.\nSt. Kitts.\nThere are 5 main bus routes on St. Kitts:\nNevis.\nOn Nevis, buses run both ways along the main ring-road around the island. All buses start off, and eventually finish up, in the capital of Nevis, Charlestown. Buses that will be travelling north out of Charlestown wait to leave from the southwest end of D. R. Walwyn Plaza. Buses travelling south from Charlestown wait to leave from the northern end of Memorial Square. At the termination points you can board a bus and wait for it to fill up before it leaves. If you are not sure you are climbing into the right bus, ask the driver if he goes to your destination.\nTaxis.\nTaxis are privately owned, but government licensed, vans. These vans usually have a name, and they all have \"yellow\" license plates where the number starts with the letter \"T\" or \"TA\".\nThe main taxi stand on St. Kitts is in Basseterre, on The Circus, phone number 466 6999, and there is a taxi stand at the airport too.\nThe main taxi stand on Nevis is in Charlestown, on the west side of D.R. Walwyn Plaza, and there is also a taxi stand at the airport.\nA taxi can traverse any accessible area on the islands, including even dirt roads and trails, if the driver agrees.\nHarbours and ferries.\nSt. Kitts.\nBasseterre is the location of all official harbouring services on Saint Kitts, though Coast Guard stations exist at Sandy Point Town and Dieppe Bay Town. The Deep Water Harbour at Basseterre is capable of both hosting and berthing of cruise ships or the handling of cargos. It is located to the extreme East of Basseterre Bay.\nPort Zante, in the centre of Basseterre Bay, is for use of docking cruise ships only. The Port can accommodate the largest cruise ships in the world. It also has a marina facility.\nThe bay is also home to the popular ferry connection between Basseterre, St. Kitts and Charlestown, Nevis. There are several trips daily. On rare occasions there is a special ferry day trip from Basseterre to Oranjestad, St Eustatius and back again.\nA relatively new (started in 2007) car ferry, which can take up to 35 cars and also takes pedestrian passengers, is called the \"Sea Bridge\" ferry, and is in operation between the two islands. This ferry traverses the narrow, 2-mile wide straight named 'The Narrows' between the two islands in 25 minutes, from Major's Bay in St. Kitts (at the tip of the southeastern peninsula), to Cades Bay in Nevis. Cars can also be carried by the \"Sea Hustler\" ferry, which operates out of Basseterre.\nNevis.\nCharlestown is the harbour for the government ferries which run between Charlestown and Basseterre on St. Kitts http:// . There is a deep water port on the southern coast of Nevis for cargo ships.\nThe \"Sea Bridge\" ferry, which takes cars (and also pedestrians), docks in the northwest part of Nevis at Cades Bay, and runs between there and Majors Bay on St. Kitts. The Sea Bridge ferry runs six times a day in each direction http:// . For pedestrians there are no facilities of any kind at Majors Bay (no houses, no businesses, etc.), only a small wooden gazebo as shelter from sun or rain, and so, if you have not already arranged to be met at Majors Bay by car or taxi, you will have to enjoy Majors Bay for a couple of hours in its more or less wild state before taking the ferry back to Nevis.\nAirports.\nSt. Kitts.\nThe Robert L. Bradshaw International Airport (IATA airport code SKB/TKPK) serves the city of Basseterre, and by extension the island of Saint Kitts. The airport is located in the south of the parish of Saint Peter Basseterre on the north-eastern periphery of the city of Basseterre. The 8001-foot runway airport has direct flights to London, New York and Miami, and seasonal flights to Charlotte, NC, and Philadelphia, PA, in addition to other major cities in the US and Canada during the tourist season.\nNevis.\nThe Vance W. Amory International Airport (IATA airport code NEV/TKPN) serves the island of Nevis. The airport runway is 4002 feet in length. Many flights connect from here to other Caribbean islands, including Puerto Rico.\nRailway.\nSt. Kitts has a narrow-gauge railway, which centres in the capital, Basseterre, and circles the island. The railway line was originally built between 1912 and 1926 to transport sugar cane to the central sugar factory in Basseterre. The last sugar cane load was delivered to the now-defunct factory in 2005. Since 2003 the railway has offered a circle tour of the island aboard specially designed open-air, double-decker coaches primarily for tourists. The \"St. Kitts Scenic Railway\" train currently runs from Sandy Point to Basseterre, travelling east.\nReferences.\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Part of the Windward Islands of the Lesser Antilles, it is located north/northeast of the island of Saint Vincent, northwest of Barbados and south of Martinique. It covers a land area of with an estimated population of over 180,000 people as of 2018. The nation's capital and largest city is Castries.\nThe first proven inhabitants of the island, the Arawaks, are believed to have been the first to settle on the island in 200\u2013400 AD. In 800 AD, the island was taken over by the Kalinago. The French were the first European colonists to settle on the island, and they signed a treaty with the native Caribs in 1660. The English took control of the island in 1663. In ensuing years, England and France fought 14 times for control of the island; consequently control over this immensely valuable geopolitical position changed frequently. Eventually, the British took complete control in 1814, shortly after the victory over French Emperor Napoleon I. Because the island switched so often between British and French control, Saint Lucia was also known as the \"Helen of the West\" after the Greek mythological character, Helen of Troy.\nRepresentative government was introduced in 1924 with universal suffrage being established in 1951. From 1958 to 1962, the island was a member of the West Indies Federation. On 22 February 1979, Saint Lucia became an independent state, while remaining as a Commonwealth realm.\nSaint Lucia is a member of the United Nations, the Organization of American States, the World Trade Organization, CARICOM and the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS). It is also a member of .\nEtymology.\nSaint Lucia is named after Saint Lucy of Syracuse (AD 283 \u2013 304). Saint Lucia is one of two sovereign states in the world named after a female and is the only one named after a woman (Ireland is named after a goddess). Legend states that French sailors were shipwrecked on the island on 13 December, the feast day of St. Lucy, and therefore named the island in her honour. \nA globe in the Vatican from 1520 shows the island as Sancta Lucia, indicating that the island was instead named by early Spanish explorers. Saint Lucia was first known as \"Louanalao\" by the Arawak Indians in 200 AD, meaning \"Island of the Iguanas,\" and then as \"Hewanorra\", in 800 AD, meaning \"there where iguanas are found,\" when the Carib Indians arrived and assimilated their culture into Saint Lucia.\nHistory.\nPre-Columbian.\nThe first proven inhabitants of Saint Lucia were the Arawaks, though there may have been other native peoples prior to them. The Arawaks are believed to have come from northern South America, sometime around AD 200\u2013400, as there are numerous archaeological sites on the island where specimens of their pottery have been found.\nThe Kalinago (Island Caribs) arrived around AD 800, and seized control from the Arawaks by killing their men and assimilating the women into their own society. \nEarly European exploration and colonization.\nIt is possible that Christopher Columbus may have sighted the island during his fourth voyage in 1502, but he does not mention the island in his log. Juan de la Cosa noted the island on his map of 1500, calling it \"El Falcon\", and another island to the south \"Las Agujas\". A Spanish c\u00e9dula from 1511 mentions the island within the Spanish domain, and a globe in the Vatican made in 1520, shows the island as Sancta Lucia.\nIn the late 1550s, the French pirate Fran\u00e7ois le Clerc (known as \"Jambe de Bois\", due to his wooden leg) set up a camp on Pigeon Island, from where he attacked passing Spanish ships. In 1605, an English vessel called the \"Oliphe Blossome\" was blown off-course on its way to Guyana, and the 67 colonists started a settlement on Saint Lucia, after initially being welcomed by the Carib chief Anthonie. By 26 September 1605, only 19 survived following continued attacks by the Carib chief Augraumart, so the settlers fled the island. The English tried to settle the island again in 1638, but the Caribs continued to be hostile. Eventually, the French successfully claimed the island in 1650 and they signed a treaty with the Caribs in 1660. In 1664, Thomas Warner (son of Sir Thomas Warner, the governor of St Kitts) claimed Saint Lucia for England but the English fled again in 1666, with the French gaining full control of the island after the signing of the Treaty of Breda. Saint Lucia was made an official French crown colony in 1674, as a dependency of Martinique.\n18th and 19th centuries.\nAfter the slave-based sugar industry developed, both the British and the French found the island attractive. During the 18th century, the island changed ownership, or was declared neutral territory, a dozen times, although the French settlements remained and the island was a de facto French colony well into the eighteenth century.\nIn 1722, George I of Great Britain granted both Saint Lucia and Saint Vincent to the 2nd Duke of Montagu. Montague appointed Nathaniel Uring, a merchant sea captain and adventurer, as deputy-governor. Uring went to the islands with a group of seven ships, and established settlement at Petit Carenage. Unable to get enough support from British warships, he and the new colonists were quickly run off by the French.\nDuring the Seven Years' War, Britain occupied Saint Lucia for a year, but handed the island back to the French in 1763, under the Treaty of Paris. Like the English and Dutch on other islands, in 1765, the French began to develop the land for the cultivation of sugar cane as a commodity crop on large plantations. The British occupied the island again in 1778.\nFrom 1782 to 1803, control of the island switched multiple times. In January 1791, during the French Revolution, the National Assembly sent four \"commissaires\" to St Lucia to spread the revolutionary philosophy. By August 1791, slaves began to abandon their estates and Governor Jean-Joseph Sourbader de Gimat fled. In December 1792, Lt. Jean-Baptiste Raymond de Lacrosse arrived with revolutionary pamphlets, and the impoverished whites and free people of colour began to arm themselves as \"patriots\". On 1 February 1793, France declared war on England and Holland, and General Nicolas Xavier de Ricard took over as Governor. The National Convention abolished enslavement on 4 February 1794. On 1 April 1794, St. Lucia was captured by a British expeditionary force led by Vice Admiral John Jervis. Morne Fortune was renamed \"Fort Charlotte\". Soon, a combined force of French Revolutionary Army soldiers and maroons, \"L'Armee Fran\u00e7aise dans les Bois\", began to fight back, starting the First Brigand War.\nA short time later, the British invaded the island as a part of the war with France that had recently broken out. On 21 February 1795, French forces under the nominal control of Victor Hugues, defeated a battalion of British troops at Vieux Fort and Rabot. In 1796, Castries was burned as part of the conflict. Leading the 27th (Inniskilling) Regiment, General John Moore retook Fort Charlotte in 1796, after two days of bitter fighting. As an honour, the Fusiliers' regimental colour was displayed on the flagstaff of the captured fortress at Morne Fortune for an hour before being replaced by the Union Jack. Upon the capture of the fort, Moore's superior, Ralph Abercromby, departed the island and placed Moore in charge of the British garrison. Moore remained at this post until falling ill with yellow fever, leading to his return to Britain before 1798.\nIn 1803, the British regained control of the island. Many members of the \"L'Armee Fran\u00e7aise dans les Bois\" escaped into the thick rainforest where they evaded capture and established maroon communities.\nSlavery on the island continued for a short time, but anti-slavery sentiment was rising in Britain. The British stopped the import of slaves by anyone, white or coloured, when they abolished the slave trade in 1807.\nFrance and Great Britain continued to contest Saint Lucia until the British secured it in 1814, as part of the Treaty of Paris, ending the Napoleonic Wars. Thereafter, Saint Lucia was considered one of the British Windward Islands colonies.\nThe institution of slavery was abolished on the island in 1834, as it was throughout the British Empire. After abolition, all former slaves had to serve a four-year \"apprenticeship\", to accustom them to the idea of freedom. During that period, they worked for their former masters for at least three-quarters of the work week. Full freedom was duly granted by the British in 1838. By that time, people of African ethnicity greatly outnumbered those of ethnic European background. People of Carib descent also comprised a minority on the island.\n20th century.\nSaint Lucia's first representative government was introduced in 1924, with the first election taking place in 1925. Many Saint Lucians served during the Second World War, and the conflict visited the island directly during the Battle of the Caribbean, when a German U-boat attacked and sank two British ships in Castries harbour on 9 March 1942. The United States used the island as a military hub during the war, including setting up a secondary naval base in Gros Islet and using what is now the island's international airport as an air force base.\nUniversal suffrage was introduced in 1951 and elections were held the same year. In 1958, Saint Lucia joined the West Indies Federation, although the federation was dissolved just a few years later in 1962. In 1967, Saint Lucia became one of the six members of the West Indies Associated States, with internal self-government. Independence was peacefully gained in 1979 under Sir John Compton of United Workers Party, with the island remaining within the British Commonwealth, keeping then-Queen Elizabeth II as Monarch, represented locally by a Governor-General.\nPost-independence era.\nDespite leading the country to independence, Compton's initial term as prime minister lasted only a few months, being defeated by the Saint Lucia Labour Party (SLP) under Allan Louisy in the 1979 Saint Lucian general election. In 1980, Hurricane Allen struck the island, destroying much of its infrastructure and reducing economic growth. Compton returned to power after the 1982 Saint Lucian general election after much instability during the labour government's term. During Compton's second term as the island's leader, banana exports significantly increased and became the nation's main source of revenue. There were improvements to infrastructure, and education was expanded to rural areas. Saint Lucia was key to the US invasion of Grenada. During the 1990s and 2000s, the nation's economy began shifting from agriculture to tourism under the leadership of Kenny Anthony. The 9/11 attacks in the United States in 2001 killed two Saint Lucians, and caused an economic slowdown, although moderate growth continued until the Great Recession. The recession, as well as the landfall of Hurricane Tomas in 2010, led to slow economic growth during the early 2010s, although the economy picked up during the later part of the decade and avoided contraction until 2020, after the COVID-19 pandemic caused major economic issues globally.\nIn June 2016, the United Workers Party (UWP), led by Allen Michael Chastanet, won 11 of the 17 seats in the general election, ousting the St Lucia Labour Party (SLP) of the incumbent Prime Minister Kenny Anthony. However, Saint Lucia Labour Party won the next election in July 2021, meaning its leader Philip J Pierre became the ninth Prime Minister of Saint Lucia since independence.\nGeography.\nSaint Lucia has a total area of 617 square kilometers (238 sq mi). As a volcanic island, Saint Lucia is very mountainous, with its highest point being Mount Gimie, at above sea level. The Pitons, two mountainous volcanic plugs, form the island's most famous landmark. Saint Lucia is also home to the world's only drive-in volcano, the Sulphur Springs. There are a number of small islands off the coast, the largest of which are the Maria Islands, located in the south-east of the island.\nSaint Lucia lies at latitude 14\u00b0 N and longitude 61\u00b0 W. The population tends to be concentrated around the coast, with the interior more sparsely populated, due to the presence of dense forests. \nFlora and fauna.\nMany species are endemic to the island, including \"Anolis luciae\", a species of lizard, and \"Boa orophias\", a species of boid snake.\nEcoregions.\nSaint Lucia has five terrestrial ecoregions: Windward Islands moist forests, Leeward Islands dry forests, Windward Islands dry forests, Windward Islands xeric scrub, and Lesser Antilles mangroves. The country had a 2019 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 6.17/10, ranking it 84th globally out of 172 countries.\nClimate.\nSaint Lucia has a tropical climate, specifically a tropical rainforest climate (Af), moderated by northeast trade winds, with a dry season from 1 December to 31 May, and a wet/rainy season from 1 June to 30 November.\nAverage daytime and nighttime temperatures are around , and respectively. Being fairly close to the equator, the island's temperature does not fluctuate much between winter and summer.\nGeology.\nThe geology of St. Lucia can be described as composing three main areas. The oldest, 16\u201318 Ma, volcanic rocks are exposed from Castries northward and consist of eroded basalt and andesite centres. The middle, central highlands, portion of the island consists of dissected andesite centres, 10.4 to 1 Mya, while the lower southwest portion of the island contains recent activity from the Soufriere Volcanic Centre (SVC). This SVC, centred about the Qualibou depression, contains pyroclastic flow deposits, lava flows, domes, block and ash flow deposits, and explosion craters. This depression's perimeter includes the town of Soufriere, Mount Tabac, Mt. Gimie, Morne Bonin, and Gros Piton. At in diameter, though the western portion is open towards the Grenada basin, the depression formed as recently as 100 kya. The depression is noted for its geothermal activity, especially at Sulphur Springs and Soufri\u00e8re Estates, a phreatic eruption in 1776, and recent seismic activity (2000\u20132001).\nEroded andesitic stratovolcanoes to the north east of the depression include Mt. Gimie, Piton St Esprit, and Mt. Grand Magazin, all greater than 1 Ma in age. Andesitic and dacite pyroclastic flows from these volcanoes are found at Morne Tabac dome (532 ka), Morne Bonin dome (273 kya), and Bellevue (264 kya). Avalanche deposits from the formation of the Qualibou depression are found offshore, and in the massive blocks of Rabot, Pleisance, and Coubaril. The dacitic domes of Petit Piton (109 kya) and Gros Piton (71 kya) were then extruded onto the depression floor accompanied by the Anse John (104 kya) and La Pointe (59.8 kya) pyroclastic flows. Later, pyroclastic flows include pumice-rich Belfond and Anse Noir (20 kya). Finally, the dacitic domes of Terre Blanche (15.3 kya) and Belfond (13.6 kya) formed within the depression.\nGovernment.\nLike most Caribbean countries, Saint Lucia is a unitary state with a parliamentary system. It is a Commonwealth realm and a constitutional monarchy, with the current monarch being Charles III, who is represented on the island by a governor-general, currently Errol Charles. The prime minister (currently Philip J. Pierre) is the head of government, the head of the cabinet, and is normally the leader of the largest party in the House of Assembly. The house has 17 seats, with each member being elected via a plurality of votes in their constituency. The upper chamber of Parliament is the Senate which has 11 appointed members, the majority of which are appointed by the prime minister.\nAdministrative divisions.\nSaint Lucia is made up of 10 districts. The districts were created and named by French colonials, and the British chose to keep the names in an anglicised form. The largest district in both size and population is Castries, where the nation's capital of the same name is located. The following are the 10 districts placed in alphabetical order:\nLaw and crime.\nSaint Lucia is a mixed jurisdiction, meaning that it has a legal system based in part on both civil law and English common law. The Civil Code of St. Lucia of 1867 was based on the Quebec Civil Code of 1866, as supplemented by English common law-style legislation. The Judicial Committee of the Privy Council was Saint Lucia's final court of appeal until 2023, when a constitutional amendment transferred this to the Caribbean Court of Justice.\nSaint Lucia's homicide rate has hit record highs in recent years. There were 75 homicides in 2021, a 34.5% increase compared with 55 homicides in 2020. 2021 saw the island record the most homicides in its history, and also its highest murder rate in its history, at 40 murders per 100,000 people.\nForeign relations.\nSaint Lucia is a member of the Caribbean Community, Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States, the Organization of American States and Organisation internationale de la Francophonie. As a Commonwealth Realm, Saint Lucia has relatively friendly relations with United Kingdom and Canada. France is also a major ally, in part due to Saint Lucia's border with Martinique. The United States is the island's largest trading partner, and Saint Lucia was key to the US invasion of Grenada in 1983, and voted against condemning the invasion. Saint Lucia became the 152nd member of the United Nations on 18 September 1979.\nSaint Lucia does not have a military although the Royal Saint Lucia Police Force has a Special Service Unit (SSU) and a Coast Guard. The island signed the UN Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in 2018.\nEconomy.\nSaint Lucia is a Small Island Developing State, a designation similar to a developing country with a few substantial differences due to Saint Lucia's island nature. The service sector is the largest sector of the economy, accounting for 86.9% of GDP in 2020, followed by industrial and agricultural sectors at 10.9% and 2.2%, respectively.\nSaint Lucia has been able to attract foreign business and investment due to its educated workforce and improvements in roads, communications, water supply, sewerage, and port facilities. Like most small islands, tourism and offshore banking are Saint Lucia's main sources of revenue. Agriculture, specifically the banana industry, was previously the largest sector of the economy, although its importance has declined significantly. The island's manufacturing sector has been called the most diverse in the Eastern Caribbean, with goods such as plastic being produced on a large scale.\nSaint Lucia's currency is the Eastern Caribbean Dollar (EC$), a regional currency shared among members of the Eastern Caribbean Currency Union (ECU). The country's main trade partners are the US, UK, EU and other CARICOM countries.\nTourism.\nTourism is the largest contributor to Saint Lucia's economy. Tourist numbers tend to be more substantial during the dry season (January to April), often referred to as the tourist season. Saint Lucia's tropical weather, scenery, beaches and resorts have made it a popular tourist destination, with 1.29\u00a0million visitors arriving in 2019.\nSome of Saint Lucia's tourist attractions include the Sulphur Springs, the Botanical Gardens, Pigeon Island and The Pitons.\nAgriculture.\nThe agricultural sector was once the main contributor to Saint Lucia's economy. This was especially thanks to the exporting of bananas. However, its importance to the economy has declined significantly, in part due to increased competition from South American countries in the banana industry. Nevertheless, agriculture is still an important part of the country's economy, providing 7.9% of jobs and contributing to 2.2% of the GDP in 2021.\nAbout 18% of land is used for agricultural practices. Bananas remain the main agricultural product grown in Saint Lucia, as well as coconuts, cocoa beans, mangoes, avocados, vegetables, citrus fruits, and root crops, such as yams and sweet potatoes.\nSaint Lucia also has a small livestock sector, which is dominated by poultry. The island is self-sufficient in egg production and production of poultry and pork has increased in recent years. Fishing has also been of considerable importance to the nation's economy.\nInfrastructure.\nSaint Lucia has a wide-ranging public bus network which covers most of the island. Busses are owned by private individuals, whilst the government is responsible for setting up routes and hubs. The road network covers most of the island, although some rural areas still lack access to proper roads.\nThe island has two airports, including the Hewanorra International Airport. Cruising and yachting are very important to the country's economy, with the main sea port being located in Castries, while the main marina is located in Rodney Bay which is also home to the St. Lucia Yacht Club. Meanwhile, the nation's main oil refinery is located in Bexon.\nThe main source of electricity in Saint Lucia is oil through its sole power station, the Cul De Sac Power Station, although solar energy is also a major source. There have also been attempts to introduce geothermal and wind energy to the island.\nDemographics.\nA census is normally held in Saint Lucia every 10 years. In the 2010 census, Saint Lucia reported a population of 165,595 in 58,920 households. This was a 5.1% increase from the 157,490 recorded at the previous census in 2001. Ages 0\u201314 made up 24.1% of the population whilst those 65 and over made up 8.6%. Nearly 40% of the island's population lived in the District of Castries, where the nation's capital of the same name is located.\nSaint Lucia had a fertility rate of 1.4 children per woman in 2021, the lowest in the Americas. This is much lower than in 1990, when the birth rate was 3.4 children per woman, and significantly lower than in 1959, when the birth rate peaked at 6.98 children per woman. Most emigration from Saint Lucia is primarily to Anglophone countries, with the United Kingdom having almost 10,000 Saint Lucian-born citizens, and over 30,000 of Saint Lucian heritage. The United States is home to many Saint Lucians, especially areas such as Miami and New York City. Canada is also home to many Saint Lucians, and especially the city of Montr\u00e9al in the French-speaking province of Quebec. The median age of Saint Lucians was 33.1 years in 2021.\nEthnic groups.\nSaint Lucia was originally populated by Amerindian peoples. However, European colonisation led to a significant drop in the indigenous populations. Most residents of the island were white planters, but African slaves and indentured servants brought by the Europeans eventually came to outnumber them. Because of this, Saint Lucia's population is predominantly of African and mixed descent. As of 2010, 85.3% of the population are black and 10.9% are of multiracial descent. Other groups include Indo-Caribbean persons (2.2%), whites (0.6%), and Indigenous Persons (0.6%). A small number of Kalinago live in the Choiseul region and in other towns on the western coast. There is also a small population of Lebanese and Syrians.\nLanguages.\nThe official language of Saint Lucia is English, though Saint Lucian French Creole (Kw\u00e9y\u00f2l) is widely spoken. Referred to colloquially as \"Patois\" (\"Patwa\"), it is spoken by a majority of the population. It is a dialect of Antillean Creole and is also related to Haitian Creole, though it nonetheless has a number of distinctive features from the latter. The Creole language developed during the early period of French colonisation and is derived chiefly from French and West African languages. There have been some attempts to make the language official, but they have not yet been successful.\nReligion.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Pie chart/styles.css\"/&gt;\nIn the 2022 census, a majority of Saint Lucians identified as Christians. This can be traced back to the nation's colonization by French and British settlers. Due to heavy French influence, most Christians on the island are Catholics, with 50.6% of the island's residents identifying as such. The remaining population identifies mostly with Protestant denominations like Seventh-day Adventist and Pentecostal churches. About 1.9% of the population identified as members of the Rastafari movement. The number of residents claiming no religion stood at 14.1% in 2022 up from 5.9% in the 2011 Census.\nThere is no state religion in Saint Lucia. The nation's constitution guarantees freedom of religion and prohibits forcing persons to take oath to any religion in which they do not follow. Religious groups are also guaranteed the freedom to establish places of education.\nEducation.\nMost primary and secondary schools in Saint Lucia are operated by the government. Education is free and compulsory for children aged five to fifteen. This includes seven years of primary school and three to five years of secondary school. In the last two years of secondary school, students are allowed to choose the subjects that they would like to do, in preparation for regional CSEC examinations. In 2020, public spending on education was at 3.6%.\nTertiary educational facilities on the island are normally private institutions. These include Monroe University and International American University. However, there are still a few public institutions, including the Sir Arthur Lewis Community College and the University of the West Indies.\nHealthcare.\nHealth services in Saint Lucia are split between the government and private institutions. The island is served by 2 public hospitals and multiple health centers, although most dental and vision services are private. Public expenditure on healthcare stood at 2.1% in 2019.\nIn 2021, life expectancy was at 71.1 years (67.8 for men and 74.7 for women). This was compared to 73.4 years in 2019. The drop in life expectancy was largely attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nCulture.\nThe culture of Saint Lucia has been influenced by African, East Indian, French, and English heritage. The main secondary language of the island is Saint Lucian Creole (Kw\u00e9y\u00f2l), a French-based creole spoken by most of the population. The island boasts the highest ratio of Nobel laureates produced with respect to the total population of any sovereign country in the world. Two winners have come from Saint Lucia: Sir Arthur Lewis, who won the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1979, and the poet Derek Walcott, who received the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1992.\nSaint Lucia has two flower festivals, the La Rose festival, celebrated on 30 August, and the La Marguerite festival, celebrated on 17 October. Every summer, the island hosts a carnival as a way to present the country's culture and music. Annually, there are normally many festivals, most of them being music-related.\nMusic.\nSaint Lucian music is heavily influenced by elements of African music, especially rhythmically. The most popular music genres in Saint Lucia are calypso, soca, dancehall, reggae, zouk, and folk music. Dennery Segment, a genre influenced by Angolan Kuduro, Saint Lucian Solo music and Dancehall was developed on the island. The internationally renowned Saint Lucia Jazz Festival is held annually, and the festival is a major source of revenue for the country's economy.\nFood.\nSaint Lucian cuisine is a mix of African, European, Indian and Caribbean dishes. Some common dishes include macaroni pie, stewed chicken, rice and peas, roti (Indian flatbreads) and soups made with fresh locally produced vegetables. All mainstream meat and poultry are eaten in St. Lucia; meat and seafood are normally stewed and browned to create a rich gravy sometimes served over \"ground provisions\" (vegetables) or rice. Johnny cakes (known as bakes) are also common, and are served with different side dishes, such as saltfish. The national dish of Saint Lucia is green figs and saltfish.\nSports.\nAs with most Caribbean islands, cricket is the most popular sport in Saint Lucia. The Windward Islands cricket team includes players from Saint Lucia and plays in the West Indies regional tournament. Daren Sammy became the first Saint Lucian to represent the West Indies on his debut in 2007, and was made captain in 2010. The Saint Lucia Kings is a T20 franchise playing in the Caribbean Premier League based in this said island nation. Sailing is also a major sport in Saint Lucia, with the Atlantic Rally for Cruisers (ARC) race beginning in the Canary Islands and ending on the island. Other sports that are popular on the island include football, basketball, tennis, golf and volleyball. Karate and boxing have also seen increased popularity in recent years. \nJulien Alfred won the nation's first-ever Olympic medal, when she won the women's 100 meters event in 10.72 seconds at the 2024 Summer Olympics held in Paris, France.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "27209", "revid": "23316696", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27209", "title": "History of Saint Lucia", "text": "Saint Lucia was inhabited by the Arawak and Kalinago Caribs before European contact in the early 16th century. It was colonized by the British and French in the 17th century and was the subject of several possession changes until 1814, when it was ceded to the British by France for the final time. In 1958, St. Lucia joined the short-lived semi-autonomous West Indies Federation. Saint Lucia was an associated state of the United Kingdom from 1967 to 1979 and then gained full independence on February 22, 1979.\nPre-colonial period.\nSaint Lucia was first inhabited sometime between 1000 and 500 BC by the Ciboney, but there is not much evidence of their presence on the island. The first proven inhabitants were the peaceful Arawaks, believed to have come from northern South America around 200-400 AD, as there are numerous archaeological sites on the island where specimens of the Arawaks' well-developed pottery have been found. There is evidence to suggest that these first inhabitants called the island \"Iouanalao\", which meant 'Land of the Iguanas', due to the island's high number of iguanas.\nThe more aggressive Caribs arrived around 800 AD, and seized control from the Arawaks by killing their men and assimilating the women into their own society. They called the island \"Hewanarau\", and later \"Hewanorra\" (Io\u00fcanalao, or \"there where iguanas are found\"). This is the origin of the name of the Hewanorra International Airport in Vieux Fort. The Caribs had a complex society, with hereditary kings and shamans. Their war canoes could hold more than 100 men and were fast enough to catch a sailing ship. They were later feared by the invading Europeans for their ferocity in battle.\n16th century.\nChristopher Columbus may have sighted the island during his fourth voyage in 1502, since he made landfall on Martinique, yet he does not mention the island in his log. Juan de la Cosa noted the island on his map of 1500, calling it \"El Falcon\", and another island to the south \"Las Agujas\". A Spanish Cedula from 1511 mentions the island within the Spanish domain, and a globe in the Vatican made in 1502, shows the island as \"Santa Lucia\". A 1529 Spanish map shows \"S. Luzia\".\nIn the late 1550s the French pirate Fran\u00e7ois le Clerc (known as \"Jambe de Bois\", due to his wooden leg) set up a camp on Pigeon Island, from where he attacked passing Spanish ships.\n17th century.\nIn 1605, an English vessel called the \"Oliphe Blossome\" was blown off-course on its way to Guyana, and the 67 colonists started a settlement on Saint Lucia, after initially being welcomed by the Carib chief Anthonie. By 26 Sept. 1605, only 19 survived, after continued attacks by the Carib chief Augraumart, so they fled the island. In 1626, the Compagnie de Saint-Christophe was chartered by Cardinal Richelieu, chief minister of Louis XIII, to colonise the Lesser Antilles, between the eleventh and eighteenth parallels. The following year, a royal patent was issued to James Hay, 1st Earl of Carlisle by Charles I of England granting rights over the Caribbean islands situated between 10\u00b0 and 20\u00b0 north latitude, creating a competing claim. In 1635, the Compagnie de Saint-Christophe was reorganized under a new patent for the Compagnie des \u00celes de l'Am\u00e9rique, which gave the company all the properties and administration of the former company and the rights to continue colonizing neighboring vacant islands.\nEnglish documents claim colonists from Bermuda settled the island in 1635, while a French letter of patent claims settlement on 8 March 1635 by a Pierre Belain d'Esnambuc, who was succeeded by his nephew, Jacques Dyel du Parquet. Thomas Warner sent Capt. Judlee with 300-400 Englishmen to establish a settlement at Praslin Bay but they were attacked over three weeks by Caribs, until the few remaining colonists fled on 12 October 1640. In 1642, Louis XIII extended the charter of the Compagnie des \u00celes de l'Am\u00e9rique for twenty years. The following year, du Parquet, who had become Governor of Martinique, noted that the British had abandoned Saint Lucia and he began making plans for a settlement. In June 1650, he sent Louis de Kerengoan, Sieur de Rousselan and 40 Frenchmen to establish a fort at the mouth of the Rivi\u00e8re du Carenage, near present day Castries. As the Compagnie was facing bankruptcy, du Parquet sailed to France in September 1650 and purchased the sole proprietorship for Grenada, the Grenadines, Martinique and Sainte-Lucie for \u20a341,500. The French drove off an attempted English invasion in 1659, but allowed the Dutch to build a redoubt near Vieux Fort Bay in 1654. On 6 April 1663, the Caribs sold St. Lucia to Francis Willoughby, 5th Baron Willoughby of Parham, English governor of the Caribbean. He invaded the island with 1100 Englishmen and 600 Amerindians in 5 ships-of-war and 17 pirogues forcing the 14 French defenders to flee.\nHowever, the English colony succumbed to disease. The French took over again, but the English came back in June 1664 and retained possession until 20 Oct. 1665 when diplomacy gave the island back to the French. The English invaded again in 1665, but disease, famine and the Caribs forced their fleeing in Jan. 1666. The Treaty of Breda (1667) gave control of the island back to the French. The English raided the island in 1686, but relinquished all claims in a 1687 treaty and the 1697 Treaty of Ryswick.\n18th century.\nBoth the British, with their headquarters in Barbados, and the French, centered on Martinique, found Saint Lucia attractive after the slave-based sugar industry developed in 1763, and during the 18th century the island changed ownership or was declared neutral territory a dozen times, although the French settlements remained and the island was a de facto a French colony well into the 18th century.\nIn 1722, the George I of Great Britain granted both Saint Lucia and Saint Vincent to John Montagu, 2nd Duke of Montagu. He in turn appointed Nathaniel Uring, a merchant sea captain and adventurer, as deputy-governor. Uring went to the islands with a group of seven ships, and established settlement at Petit Carenage. Unable to get enough support from British warships, he and the new colonists were quickly run off by the French.\nThe 1730 census showed 463 occupants of the island, which included just 125 whites, 37 Caribs, 175 slaves, and 126 free blacks or mixed race. The French took control of the island in 1744, and by 1745, the island had a population of 3455, including 2573 slaves.\nDuring the Seven Years' War Britain occupied Saint Lucia in 1762, but gave the island back at the Treaty of Paris on 10 February 1763. Britain occupied the island again in 1778 after the Grand Battle of Cul de Sac during the American Revolutionary War. British Admiral George Rodney then built Fort Rodney from 1779 to 1782.\nBy 1779, the island's population had increased to 19,230, which included 16,003 slaves working 44 sugar plantations. Yet, the Great Hurricane of 1780 killed about 800. By the time the island was restored to French rule in 1784, as a consequence of the Peace of Paris (1783), 300 plantations had been abandoned and some thousand maroons lived in the interior.\nIn Jan. 1791, during the French Revolution, the National Assembly sent four \"Commissaries\" to St. Lucia to spread the revolution philosophy. By August, slaves began to abandon their estates and Governor de Gimat fled. In Dec. 1792, Lt. Jean-Baptiste Raymond de Lacrosse arrived with revolutionary pamphlets, and the poor whites and free people of color began to arm themselves as \"patriots\". On 1 Feb. 1793, France declared war on England and Holland, and General Nicolas Xavier de Ricard took over as Governor. The National Convention abolished enslavement on 4 Feb. 1794, but St. Lucia fell to a British invasion led by Vice Admiral John Jervis on 1 April 1794. Morne Fortune became \"Fort Charlotte\". Soon, a patriot army of resistance, \"L'Armee Francaise dans les Bois\", began to fight back. Thus started the First Brigand War.\nA short time later, the British invaded in response to the concerns of the wealthy plantation owners, who wanted to keep sugar production going. On 21 February 1795, a group of rebels, led by Victor Hugues, defeated a battalion of British troops. For the next four months, a group of recently freed slaves known as the Brigands forced out not only the British army, but every white slave-owner from the island (coloured slave owners were left alone, as in Haiti). The English were eventually defeated on June 19, and fled from the island. The Royalist planters fled with them, leaving the remaining Saint Lucians to enjoy \u201cl\u2019Ann\u00e9e de la Libert\u00e9\u201d, \u201ca year of freedom from slavery\u2026\u201d. Gaspard Goyrand, a Frenchman who was Saint Lucia's Commissary later became Governor of Saint Lucia, and proclaimed the abolition of slavery. Goyrand brought the aristocratic planters to trial. Several lost their heads on the guillotine, which had been brought to Saint Lucia with the troops. He then proceeded to re-organize the island.\nThe British continued to harbor hopes of recapturing the island and in April 1796 Sir Ralph Abercrombie and his troops attempted to do so. Castries was burned as part of the conflict, and after approximately one month of bitter fighting the French surrendered at Morne Fortune on 25 May. General Moore was elevated to the position of Governor of Saint Lucia by Abercrombie and was left with 5,000 troops to complete the task of subduing the entire island.\nBritish Brig. Gen. John Moore was appointed Military Governor on 25 May 1796, and engaged in the Second Brigand War. Some \"Brigands\" began to surrender in 1797, when promised they would not be returned to slavery. Final freedom and the end to hostilities came with Emancipation in 1838.\n19th century.\nThe 1802 Treaty of Amiens restored the island to French control, and Napoleon Bonaparte reinstated slavery. The British regained the island in June 1803, when Commodore Samuel Hood defeated French Governor Brig. Gen. Antoine Nogu\u00e8s. The island was officially ceded to Britain in 1814.\nAlso in 1838, Saint Lucia was incorporated into the British Windward Islands administration, headquartered in Barbados. This lasted until 1885, when the capital was moved to Grenada.\n20th century to 21st century.\nIncreasing self-government has marked St Lucia's 20th-century history. A 1924 constitution gave the island its first form of representative government, with a minority of elected members in the previously all-nominated legislative council.\nDuring the Battle of the Caribbean, a German U-boat attacked and sank two British ships in Castries harbour on 9 March 1942.\nUniversal adult suffrage was introduced in 1951, and elected members became a majority of the council. Ministerial government was introduced in 1956, and in 1958 St. Lucia joined the short-lived West Indies Federation, a semi-autonomous dependency of the United Kingdom. When the federation collapsed in 1962, following Jamaica's withdrawal, a smaller federation was briefly attempted. After the second failure, the United Kingdom and the six windward and leeward islands\u2014Grenada, St. Vincent, Dominica, Antigua, St. Kitts and Nevis and Anguilla, and St. Lucia\u2014developed a novel form of cooperation called associated statehood.\nBy 1957, bananas exceed sugar as the major export crop.\nAs an associated state of the United Kingdom from 1967 to 1979, St. Lucia had full responsibility for internal self-government but left its external affairs and defence responsibilities to the United Kingdom. This interim arrangement ended on 22 February 1979, when St. Lucia achieved complete independence. St. Lucia is a constitutional monarchy with King Charles III as King of St. Lucia and is an active member of the Commonwealth of Nations. The island continues to cooperate with its neighbours through the Caribbean community and common market (CARICOM), the East Caribbean Common Market (ECCM), and the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS).\nIn June 2016, the United Workers Party (UWP), led by Allen Michael Chastanet, won 11 of the 17 seats in the general election, ousting the St Lucia Labour Party (SLP) of the incumbent Prime Minister Kenny Anthony. However, Saint Lucia Labour Party won the next election in July 2021, meaning its leader Philip J Pierre became the ninth Prime Minister of Saint Lucia since the independence.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "27210", "revid": "173030", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27210", "title": "Geography of Saint Lucia", "text": " \nSaint Lucia is one of many small land masses composing the insular group known as the Windward Islands. Unlike large limestone areas such as Florida, Cuba, and the Yucatan Peninsula, or the Bahamas, which is a small island group composed of coral and sand, Saint Lucia is a typical Windward Island formation of volcanic rock that came into existence long after much of the region had already been formed.\nSaint Lucia's physical features are notable. Dominated by high peaks and rain forests in the interior, the island is known for the twin peaks of Gros Piton () and Petit Piton () on the southwestern coast, its soft sandy beaches, and its magnificent natural harbours. Mount Gimie, the highest peak, is located in the central mountain range and rises to above sea level, a contrast that is also evident in the abrupt climatic transition from coastal to inland areas. The steep terrain also accentuates the many rivers that flow from central Saint Lucia to the Caribbean. Fertile land holdings, which support banana farming, are scattered throughout the island.\nSaint Lucia has a tropical, humid climate moderated by northeast trade winds that allow for pleasant year-round conditions. Mean annual temperatures range from to at sea level and drop to an average of in the mountain peaks. The abundant annual rainfall accumulates to approximately , with most precipitation occurring during the June to December wet season. Hurricanes are the most severe climatic disturbance in this area and have been known to cause extensive damage. Although Saint Lucia has historically been spared from serious hurricane destruction, Hurricane Allen decimated the agricultural sector and claimed nine lives in 1980. More recently, in 2010, Hurricane Tomas claimed seven lives and also caused extensive agricultural damage, particularly to the island's burgeoning cocoa crop.\nGeneral.\nSaint Lucia is in the Caribbean, an island between the Caribbean Sea and North Atlantic Ocean, north of Saint Vincent and north-west of Barbados. The capital city of Saint Lucia is Castries, where about one third of the population lives. Major towns include Gros Islet, Soufri\u00e8re and Vieux Fort.\nClimate.\nSaint Lucia is in the tropical zone, although its climate is moderated by northeast trade winds. Since it is fairly close to the equator, and the surrounding sea surface temperature only fluctuates 3\u00b0C (25-28\u00b0C) the coastal air temperature does not fluctuate much between winter and summer. The dry season is from December to June, and the rainy season is from June to November. Average daytime temperatures are around , and average night time temperatures are around . Average annual rainfall ranges from on the coast to in the mountain rainforests.\nTerrain.\nVolcanic and mountainous with some broad, fertile valleys.\nNatural resources.\nSaint Lucia has forests, sandy beaches, minerals (pumice), mineral springs, and a geothermal potential.\nLand use.\nAbout 18% of the land is used for agricultural practices. Most farms consist of less than 5 acres of land. The main agricultural products grown in Saint Lucia are bananas, coconuts, cocoa beans, mangoes, avocados, vegetables, citrus fruits, and root crops such as yams and sweet potatoes. Most of these agricultural products are grown for local consumption, but bananas and coconuts are mainly grown for export, with some vegetables. Bananas occupy about 14,826 acres of the agricultural land, while coconuts occupy 12,400 acres.\nForest reserves and botanical gardens in Saint Lucia:\nIslands.\nThe island of the island nation of Saint Lucia include the following:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nDistricts.\nThe island of Saint Lucia is divided into 10 Districts and the Forest Reserve:\nNatural hazards.\nThe island country of Saint Lucia is effected by hurricanes and volcanic activity. The island was severely affected by Hurricane Allen in 1980 and Hurricane Tomas in 2010, causing agricultural damage and a drop in visitor arrivals, but Saint Lucia has generally had fewer hurricanes than many other Caribbean islands, due to its southerly location. Hurricanes and volcanoes would both damage the coral.\nEnvironment.\nCurrent issues include deforestation and soil erosion, particularly in the northern region.\nSaint Lucia is party to the following treaties and conventions:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "27212", "revid": "5795946", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27212", "title": "Politics of Saint Lucia", "text": " \nPolitics of Saint Lucia takes place in the framework of an independent parliamentary democratic constitutional monarchy, with King Charles III as its head of state, represented by a Governor General, who acts on the advice of the prime minister and the cabinet. The prime minister is the leader of the majority party of the house, and the cabinet conducts affairs of state. The Governor General exercises basically ceremonial functions, but residual powers, under the constitution, can be used at the governor general's discretion. The actual power in St. Lucia lies with the prime minister and the cabinet, usually representing the majority party in parliament.\nHistory.\nPolitics in St. Lucia was once dominated by the United Workers' Party (UWP), which, until 1997 had governed the country for all but three years since independence. John Compton was premier of St. Lucia from 1964 until independence in February 1979.\nThe Saint Lucia Labour Party (SLP) won the first post-independence elections in July 1979, taking 12 of 17 seats in parliament. A period squabbling within the party ensued, which led to several changes of prime minister. Pressure from the private sector and the unions forced the government to resign in 1982. New elections were then called and were won resoundingly by Compton's UWP, which took 14 of 17 seats.\nThe UWP was elected for a second time on 16 April 1987, but with only nine of 17 seats. Seeking to increase his slim margin, Prime Minister Compton suspended parliament and called new elections on 30 April. This unprecedented snap election, however, gave the same results as before\u2014the UWP retained nine seats and the SLP eight. In April 1992, Prime Minister Compton's government again defeated the SLP, but this time increased its majority in parliament to 11 of 17 seats.\nIn 1996, Compton announced his resignation as prime minister in favor of his chosen successor Dr. Vaughan Lewis, former director-general of the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS). Dr. Lewis became prime minister and minister of finance, planning and development on 2 April 1996. The SLP also had a change of leadership with former CARICOM official Dr. Kenny Anthony succeeding businessman Julian Hunte.\nIn elections held 23 May 1997, the St. Lucia Labour Party won all but one of the 17 seats in Parliament, and Dr. Kenny Anthony became Prime Minister and Minister of Finance, Planning and Development on 24 May 1997.\nIn elections of 3 December 2001 the St. Lucia Labour Party won 14 of the 17 available seats. The leader of the UWP, Dr. Morella Joseph failed to win a seat. Arsene James was appointed the Leader of the Opposition.\nIn the general elections held on 11 December 2006 the UWP, once again led by Sir John Compton, defeated the SLP, winning 11 of the 17 seats. The next elections in St Lucia are constitutionally due in December 2011. The governing United Workers Party, and the opposition St Lucia Labour Party, along with the newly formed Lucian People's Movement, are expected to contest the next elections.\nIn June 2016, the United Workers Party (UWP), led by Allen Michael Chastanet, won 11 of the 17 seats in the general election, ousting the St Lucia Labour Party (SLP) of the incumbent Prime Minister Kenny Anthony. \nOn 29 July 2021, Philip Joseph Pierre was sworn in as the 12th Prime Minister of St Lucia since independence in 1979. St Lucia Labour Party (SLP), led by Pierre, reached a clear victory in general election. The previous SLP administration, led by Kenny Anthony, was during the period 2011-16. The United Workers Party (UWP) governed during the period 2016-21. \nExecutive branch.\nAs head of state, King Charles III is represented by a governor general who acts on the advice of the prime minister and the cabinet. Following legislative elections, the leader of the majority party or leader of a majority coalition is usually appointed prime minister by the governor general; the deputy prime minister and other ministers is appointed by the governor general.\nLegislative branch.\nThe Legislature has two chambers. The House of Assembly has 17 members, elected by universal adult suffrage for a five-year term in single-seat constituencies. The Senate has 11 members appointed by the governor general. \nThe parliament may be dissolved by the governor general at any point during its five-year term, either at the request of the prime minister\u2014in order to take the nation into early elections\u2014or at the governor general's own discretion, if the house passes a vote of no-confidence in the government.\nJudicial branch.\nSt. Lucia has an independent judiciary composed of district courts and a high court. Cases may be appealed to the Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court and, ultimately, to the Caribbean Court of Justice in Port of Spain. The island is divided into 10 administrative divisions, including the capital, Castries. Popularly elected local governments in most towns and villages perform such tasks as regulation of sanitation and markets and maintenance of cemeteries and secondary roads. St. Lucia has no army but maintains a paramilitary Special Service Unit within its police force and a coast guard.\nElectoral boundaries.\nSaint Lucia's electoral boundaries are based, generally, on the 10 districts of Saint Lucia. There are 17 constituencies in Saint Lucia.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "27213", "revid": "15881234", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27213", "title": "Economy of Saint Lucia", "text": "Once a single-crop agricultural economy, Saint Lucia has shifted to a tourism and banking serviced-based economy. Tourism, the island's biggest industry and main source of jobs, income and foreign exchange, accounts for 65% of its GDP. Agriculture, which was once the biggest industry, now contributes to less than 3% of GDP, but still accounts for 20% of jobs. The banana industry is now on a decline due to strong competition from low-cost Latin American producers and reduced European trade preferences, but the government has helped revitalize the industry, with 13,734 tonnes exported in 2018. Agricultural crops grown for export are bananas, mangoes, and avocados. The island is considered to have the most diverse and well-developed manufacturing industry in the eastern Caribbean.\nSaint Lucia has been able to attract many foreign businesses and investors.\nEconomic history.\nThe island's banana output was heavily impacted in 2007 by Hurricane Dean. In 2006, the governor stated:\nWhile living standards have improved for many, a large number of people have been pushed to the margin of economic activity, especially in the areas which once depended heavily on the banana industry for a livelihood.\nSectors.\nAgriculture.\nAgriculture is the second-largest industry in Saint Lucia. In 2020, agriculture only contributed 2.2% to Saint Lucia's GDP, but still accounts for a significant number of jobs - some 10% of the employed population. As of the 2010 census, the roughly 10,000 agricultural holdings covered an area of 30,204 acres, an average of 3.0 acres per agricultural holding.\nAbout 18% of the land is used for agricultural practices. Most farms consist of less than 5 acres of land. The main agricultural products grown in Saint Lucia are bananas, coconuts, cocoa beans, mangoes, avocados, vegetables, citrus fruits, and root crops such as yams and sweet potatoes. Most of these agricultural products are grown for local consumption, but bananas and coconuts are mainly grown for export, with some vegetables. Bananas occupy about 14,826 acres of the agricultural land, while coconuts occupy 12,400 acres.\nSaint Lucia has a small livestock sector, which is dominated by poultry and pork. The island is self-sufficient in egg production and is trying to become self-sufficient in poultry and pork production. The Ministry of Agriculture is encouraging farmers to raise sheep and goats to reduce the island's importation of frozen meats, and has helped by providing support to farmers, importing bloodlines of livestock to increase the productivity of animals, and providing subsidies on animal feed.\nHelp is also being given to revitalize the local dairy and beef industries through the introduction of efficient cattle breeds, training of farmers to care properly for livestock, and establishing funds for the construction of dairy units and abattoirs.\nThe island is also looking to expand its exports under the Taste of Saint Lucia brand sponsored by Export Saint Lucia. Products that are being promoted include Saint Lucia Honey, rum, chocolate, coconut oil, granola, and insect repellent.\nTourism.\nThe island currently attracts over 900,000 visitors annually. St Lucia has been able to attract foreign businesses and investment, especially in its offshore banking and tourism industries. Tourism is St Lucia's main source of jobs and income, accounting for 65% of GDP, and the island's main source of foreign exchange earnings. The northern end of St Lucia is tourism's most urbanized area, with a fair number of hotels and resorts located along beaches, or with seaside views. This is also home to many of the island's large, all-inclusive resorts.\nEconomic trends.\nThe level of island households living at or below the poverty level increased from 18.7 to 21.4% from 1995 to 2005. As of 2006, another 16.2% of the island's population are vulnerable to economic shocks that could easily push them below the poverty line. One rural district had 44.9% of households living below the poverty line (2005).\nTo broaden the island's economic base, the government added small, computer-driven information technology and financial services as development objectives.\nSt. Lucia's leading revenue producers\u2014agriculture, tourism, and small-scale manufacturing\u2014benefited from a focus on infrastructure improvements in roads, communications, water supply, sewerage, and port facilities. Foreign investors also have been attracted by the infrastructure improvements and by the educated and skilled work force and relatively stable political conditions. The largest investment is in a petroleum storage and transshipment terminal built by Hess Oil. The Caribbean Development Bank funded an airport expansion project.\nUntil the events of 11 September 2001, the tourism sector had made significant gains, experiencing a boom despite some untimely and destructive hurricanes. Stay-over visitors and cruise arrivals declined in 2001, and several hotels declared bankruptcy, including the Hyatt. The development of the tourism sector remains a priority, and the government is committed to providing a favourable investment environment. Incentives are available for building and upgrading tourism facilities. Use of public funds to improve the physical infrastructure of the island has been liberal, and the government has made efforts to attract cultural and sporting events and develop historical sites.\nOverview.\nSt. Lucia's economy depends primarily on revenue from tourism and banana production, with some contribution from small-scale manufacturing.\nAlthough banana revenues have helped fund the country's development since the 1960s, the industry is now in a terminal decline, due to reduced European Union trade preferences and competition from lower-cost Latin American banana producers. The country is encouraging farmers to plant crops such as cocoa, mangoes, and avocados to diversify its agricultural production and provide jobs for displaced banana workers.\nTourism recovered in 2004, following the post-11 September 2001 recession, and continued to grow in 2005, making up more than 48% of St. Lucia's GDP. The hotel and restaurant industry grew by 6.3% during 2005. Stay-over arrivals increased by 6.5%, and the United States remained the most important market, accounting for 35.4% of these arrivals. Yacht passengers rose by 21.9%. Redeployment of cruise ships, remedial berth construction, and high fuel costs prevented higher growth rates. However, several investors have planned new tourism projects for the island, including a large hotel and resort in the southern part of the island. The global recession has caused a reduction in tourist revenue and foreign investment, significantly slowing growth rates.\nSt. Lucia's currency is the Eastern Caribbean Dollar (EC$), a regional currency shared among members of the Eastern Caribbean Currency Union (ECCU). The Eastern Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB) issues the EC$, manages monetary policy, and regulates and supervises commercial banking activities in its member countries. The ECCB has kept the EC$ pegged at EC$2.7 = US$1.\nSt. Lucia is a beneficiary of the U.S. Caribbean Basin Initiative and is a member of the Caribbean Community and Common Market. The country hosts the executive secretariat of the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States.\nSt. Lucia is the headquarters of the Eastern Caribbean Telecommunications authority, which is developing the regulations to liberalize the telecommunications sector in the region by 2004.\nEconomic statistics.\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $1,667 billion (2016 est.)\nGDP - real growth rate: 3.5% (2012 est.)\nGDP - per capita: purchasing power parity - $12,952 (2016 est.)\nGDP - composition by sector:\nPopulation below poverty line: 21.4% (2005)\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\n&lt;BR&gt;\"lowest 10%:\"\nNA%\n&lt;BR&gt;\"highest 10%:\"\nNA%\nInflation rate (consumer prices): -0.934% (2016 est.)\nLabour force: 50,300 (2011)\nLabour force - by occupation:\nUnemployment rate: 15% (2013 est.)\nPay:\nbest is $350 a week\nBudget:\n&lt;BR&gt;\"revenues:\"\n$141.2 million\n&lt;BR&gt;\"expenditures:\"\n$146.7 million, including capital expenditures of $25.1 million (2000 estimate)\nIndustries:\nclothing, assembly of electronic components, beverages, corrugated cardboard boxes, tourism, lime processing, coconut processing\nIndustrial production growth rate:\nElectricity - production: 281 GWh (2003)\nElectricity - production by source:\n&lt;BR&gt;\"fossil fuel:\"\n100%\n&lt;BR&gt;\"hydro:\"\n0%\n&lt;BR&gt;\"nuclear:\"\n0%\n&lt;BR&gt;\"other:\"\n0% (1998)\nElectricity - consumption: 102 KWh (1998)\nAgriculture - products:&lt;BR&gt;\nbananas, coconuts, vegetables, citrus, root crops, cocoa\nExports: $82 million (2004)\nExports - commodities:&lt;BR&gt;\nbananas 41%, clothing, cocoa, vegetables, fruits, coconut oil\nExports - partners:&lt;BR&gt;\nFrance 25%, United States 18.3%, United Kingdom 14.5%, Brazil 6.8% (2005)\nImports:\n$410 million (2004)\nImports - commodities:&lt;BR&gt;\nfood 23%, manufactured goods 21%, machinery and transportation equipment 19%, chemicals, fuels\nImports - partners:\nUnited States 23.8%, Trinidad and Tobago 16%, Netherlands 11.1%, Venezuela 6.3%, Finland 6.2%, United Kingdom 5.7%, France 4.7% (2005)\nDebt - external:\nEconomic aid - recipient: $51.8 million (1995)\nCurrency: 1 East Caribbean dollar (EC$) = 100 cents\nExchange rates: East Caribbean dollars (EC$) per US$1 \u2013 2.7000 (fixed rate since 1976)\nFiscal year: 1 April \u2013 31 March\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
